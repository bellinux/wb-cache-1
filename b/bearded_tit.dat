500|$|The {{committee}} {{keeps the}} list of species it considers under review and, from time to time, makes changes. These are usually because species have increased in frequency and no longer meet the numerical criteria for inclusion. A species is removed if {{it has more than}} 150 records in the preceding ten years, with ten or more in at least eight of those years. Different criteria were used in a review in 2006 (see below). [...] There have been three major [...] "purges" [...] of species since the committee's formation. The first was soon after the committee's formation, in 1963, when 16 species were removed: red-crested pochard, snow goose, pectoral sandpiper, Mediterranean gull, Sabine's gull, melodious warbler, icterine warbler, yellow-browed warbler, northern goshawk, golden eagle, red kite, Kentish plover, crested tit, <b>bearded</b> <b>tit,</b> marsh warbler and Dartford warbler. Records of the last eight species had been considered only outside their [...] "normal" [...] British range (e.g. crested tits outside Scotland, and red kites outside Wales). The second was in 1982, when ten further species were removed: Cory's shearwater, purple heron, white stork, buff-breasted sandpiper, Richard's pipit, tawny pipit, Savi's warbler, aquatic warbler, serin and common rosefinch. Savi's warbler was re-admitted to the committee's list in 1998, due to declining numbers of occurrences. Thirdly, in 2006, a further 17 species were dropped from the list: ferruginous duck, Wilson’s petrel, great white egret, black kite, red-footed falcon, American golden plover, white-rumped sandpiper, white-winged black tern, alpine swift, red-rumped swallow, red-throated pipit, subalpine warbler, greenish warbler, dusky warbler, Radde's warbler, Arctic redpoll and rustic bunting. Their selection was based on different criteria from those previously used: more than 200 records in Britain ever, and more than 100 occasions in the last decade.|$|E
60|$|There {{was nothing}} new to me in all this: {{it was an old}} {{familiar}} story; I have given it fully, simply because it is an accurate statement of what is being done all over the country. There is not a county in the kingdom where you may not hear of important members of the community who are collectors of birds and their eggs, and law-breakers, both directly and indirectly, every day of their lives. They all take, and pay for, every rare visitant that comes in their way, and also require an unlimited supply of the rarer resident species for the purpose of exchange with other private collectors in distant counties. In this way our finest species are gradually being extirpated. Within the last few years we have seen the disappearance (as breeding species) of the ruff and reeve, marsh harrier, and honey buzzard; and the species now on the verge of extinction, which will soon follow these and others that have gone before, if indeed some of them have not already gone, are the sea-eagle, osprey, kite, hen harrier, Montagu's harrier, stone curlew, Kentish plover, dotterel, red-necked phalarope, roseate tern, <b>bearded</b> <b>tit,</b> grey-lag goose, and great skua. These in their turn will be followed by the chough, hobby, great black-backed gull, furze wren, crested tit, and others. These are the species which, as things are going, will absolutely and for ever disappear, as residents and breeders, from off the British Islands. Meanwhile other species that, although comparatively rare, are less local in their distribution, are being annually exterminated {{in some parts of the}} country: it is poor comfort to the bird lover in southern England to know that many species that formerly gave life and interest to the scene, and have lately been done to death there, may still be met with in the wilder districts of Scotland, or in some forest in the north of Wales. Finally, we have among our annual visitants a considerable number of species which have either bred in these islands in past times (some quite recently), or else would probably remain to breed if they were not immediately killed on arrival--bittern, little bittern, night heron, spoonbill, stork, avocet, black tern, hoopoe, golden oriole, and many others of less well-known names.|$|E
50|$|The alder carr and willow carr {{support the}} {{swallowtail}} butterfly and the Norfolk hawker dragonfly Aeshna isosceles, {{as well as}} marsh harriers, <b>bearded</b> <b>tits</b> {{and most of the}} country's Cetti's warblers.|$|R
50|$|Species seen: red squirrel, {{mushrooms}} (razorstrop, Jew's ear, puff ball (also {{known as}} the devils snuff box), fly agaric and dead man's fingers), <b>bearded</b> <b>tits,</b> red deer, medicinal leech, white-clawed crayfish, bats (Daubenton's bat, noctule) and whooper swans.|$|R
50|$|Notable {{amongst the}} {{breeding}} birds are gadwall, shovellers, and reed, sedge, grasshopper and Cetti's warblers. Marsh harriers are regular visitors and occasionally breed. Migrants include Jack snipe and green sandpiper, and winter visitors include hen harriers and <b>bearded</b> <b>tits.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{bearded reedling}} (Panurus biarmicus) is a small, sexually dimorphic reed-bed {{passerine}} bird. It is frequently {{known as the}} <b>bearded</b> <b>tit,</b> due to some similarities to the long-tailed tit, or the bearded parrotbill.|$|E
50|$|This former gravel quarry is {{bisected}} by the River Hassenbrook. It {{has one of}} {{the largest}} reedbeds in the county, together with rough grassland and marshes. The bird life is diverse, including water rails, grey wagtails and <b>bearded</b> <b>tits.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{reserve is}} a mix of wetland habitats, {{including}} reedbeds, fens, dykes and pools. It was designed to provide a breeding site for bitterns. Other key species seen at the site include marsh harriers, herons, <b>bearded</b> <b>tits,</b> four-spotted chaser dragonflies and hairy dragonflies as well as mammals including otters and water voles. Large roosts of starlings have been common at the reserve during autumn since 2003.|$|R
50|$|The site is {{important}} for wintering waders and wildfowl which feed on the mudflats. Reed warblers, sedge warblers and <b>bearded</b> <b>tits</b> breed on reed beds in the lagoon, and teals and grey herons roost on the shallow waters and grassy islands. Stone Ness saltings is a large area of salt marsh dominated by sea club-rush. The conservation charity Buglife fought to prevent development of the site, and succeeded in 2014.|$|R

40|$|International audienceAims To {{describe}} the first reported infestation by the skin-dweller mite Harpirhynchus nidulans in <b>Bearded</b> <b>Tits</b> Panurus biarmicus {{and for the}} Timaliidae family, to detect possible fitness costs for the host and to determine {{the distribution of the}} parasite within the distribution range of the host. Methods Parasites were identified using a microscope. Wing-length and body mass were recorded on both uninfected and infected birds captured at different times during the year. We also considered historical data, and contact was made with 32 European ringing stations to identify the distribution range of the parasite. Results Subcutaneous reproduction of the mite Harpirhynchus nidulans induced the development of voluminous dermal nodules in Panurus biarmicus. There were no differences in body mass or wing-length with respect to infestation. In the south of France, prevalence changed from 10. 6 % in spring to 4. 7 % in autumn. Both sexes are equally parasitized. Occurrence of dermal cysts is reported from several southern European populations of <b>Bearded</b> <b>Tits,</b> whereas it seems to be absent from northern latitudes. Conclusion The occurrence of a Harpirhynchus mite in wild bird populations is reported for the first time. We consider aspects of its biology, host–parasite system, host-specificity, co-adaptation of the mite reproductive cycle to the social dynamics of its host and metapopulational host–parasite dynamics...|$|R
40|$|Sexual {{dimorphism}} {{in color}} and pattern of contour feathers is rare in juvenile songbirds. We describe how captive-bred juvenile males of Scottish Crossbill (Loxia scotica) and nominate Red Crossbill (L. curvirostra curvirostra) can be differentiated from females prior to prebasic molt by an unstreaked patch on the males' upper breast. There may be a functional relationship between sexual dimorphism {{and the formation of}} pair bonds or breeding while the birds are still in juvenile plumage. Sexually dimorphic Red Crossbills and <b>Bearded</b> <b>Tits</b> (Panurus biarmicus) are known to form pair bonds, and even breed successfully, while still in juvenile plumage...|$|R
50|$|This new wetland habitat {{has been}} {{established}} from old peat diggings and now consists of areas of reedbed, wet scrub, open water and peripheral grassland and woodland. Many bird species live on or visit the site including the <b>bearded</b> <b>tit,</b> bittern, Cetti's warbler, hobby and starling.|$|E
50|$|The {{reserve is}} {{a haven for}} birds. Predatory {{visitors}} like the hen harrier, buzzard, hobby and the occasional marsh harrier visit the site regularly.

50|$|The Ham Wall National Nature Reserve, 4 km west of Glastonbury, {{is managed}} by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. This new wetland habitat has been {{established}} from out peat diggings and now consists of areas of reedbed, wet scrub, open water and peripheral grassland and woodland. Bird species living on the site include the <b>bearded</b> <b>tit</b> and the bittern.|$|E
50|$|The marshes {{include a}} mixture of coastal and {{freshwater}} wetland habitats, including brackish pools. These provide breeding habitats for birds such as bitterns, marsh harriers and <b>bearded</b> <b>tits</b> as well as mammals such as otters and water vole and over-wintering locations for species such as avocets, white-fronted geese, lapwings and redshanks. The site is an internationally important habitat of the starlet sea anemone, the rarest sea anemone in Britain. The reserve is bordered by heathland and forest on the landward side and includes a vegetated shingle bank on the seaward side. Little terns often nest along the bank.|$|R
50|$|The RSPB's Blacktoft Sands {{nature reserve}} lies {{immediately}} upstream of the Falls, {{on the south}} bank of the Ouse. It is formed from the largest tidal reedbed in England, and is visited by 270 species of birds, including breeding pairs of <b>bearded</b> <b>tits,</b> bitterns and marsh harriers, {{for which it is}} of national importance. Overlooking Trent Falls from a hill a mile away to the east is Julian's Bower, an ancient turf maze {{on the edge of the}} Lincolnshire village of Alkborough. It dates from at least 1697, when Abraham de la Pryme recorded it, although the reasons for its creation are now uncertain.|$|R
5000|$|Occasionally, {{more unusual}} {{locations}} are used. One pair in Scotland nested {{in the open}} {{by the side of}} a road, and when an English nature reserve installed nest boxes for <b>bearded</b> <b>tits</b> (reed [...] "wigwams" [...] with a wooden floor), rails nested both in the boxes and under the wooden floor, in the latter case sometimes with the tits in residence above. Although mainly a lowland species, the water rail breeds at 1240 m in the Alps and 2000 m in Armenia. An Italian study suggested that reed bed birds need a minimum area of wetland for breeding, which for the water rail is about 1 ha, although the highest densities are in marshes of 10 ha or more.|$|R
5000|$|Errol {{is known}} for its reeds, which used to be {{collected}} up to a few years ago to make thatched roofs. These reeds grow in the banks of the River Tay and act as home to a fairly uncommon bird called the <b>bearded</b> <b>tit.</b> Errol has a large church, built in 1831, known as the [...] "Cathedral of The Carse" [...] which can be seen from most parts of the village and from far around.|$|E
50|$|Nakskov fjord is a Natura 2000 {{protected}} bird habitat since May, 1983. The total {{surface area}} of the protected habitat is 85 km2. Many species of birds {{are found in the}} fjord and the inner fjord area including mute swan, crested grebe, gadwall, shoveler, pochard, tufted duck and the beautiful <b>bearded</b> <b>tit.</b> During the migration season such species as little gull and black tern can also be seen. The fjord is also a protected habitat for dolphins and porpoises.|$|E
50|$|The lake is {{the site}} of a nature reserve, and since 1977 has been {{designated}} a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve and a Ramsar site, in view of its importance as a breeding ground for water birds such as grebe, rail, moorhen, grey heron, <b>bearded</b> <b>tit,</b> white-tailed eagle, osprey, rust-coloured kite, cormorant and black tern. The lake is known since many decades as the habitat of the mute swan (Cygnus olor) - nesting there every year from a dozen to tens of dozen of pairs, and in time of moult arriving in numbers reaching up to 2,000 birds. The lake is part of the larger protected area known as Masurian Landscape Park.|$|E
50|$|Despite {{being created}} recently, Lakenheath Fen is {{a haven for}} wildlife, {{and the number of}} birds seen at the reserve has {{increased}} significantly. The number of Eurasian reed warblers rose from four pairs in 1995 to 355 pairs in 2002. Reed buntings have increased from 6 to 87 pairs during the same period. Two pairs of western marsh harriers nested {{for the first time in}} newly created reed in 2002. Great crested grebes and little grebes are breeding on the meres, and water rails have nested in the new reeds. <b>Bearded</b> <b>tits</b> have stayed on the reserve throughout the winter, as have bitterns. Common cranes have been found to be breeding at the fen for what is believed to be the first time in 400 years. The reserve is also notable for its breeding golden orioles.|$|R
50|$|While parental-care {{parasitism}} {{significantly increased}} the breeding {{number of the}} parasite, {{only about half of}} the parasite eggs survived. Parasitism for the individual (the brood parasite) also has significant drawbacks. As an example, the parasitic offspring of the <b>bearded</b> <b>tits,</b> Panurus biarmicus, compared to the offspring in non-parasitic nests, tend to develop much more slowly and often don’t reach full maturity. Parasitic females however can adopt either floater traits or nesting traits. Floater females are entirely dependent on others to raise their eggs because they do not have their own nests. Hence, they reproduce significantly less because the hosts reject their ‘intruder’ eggs or they may just miss the egg-laying period of the bird they are trying to pass their eggs to. Nesting females who have their own nests may also be parasitic due to temporary situations like sudden loss of nests, or they lay surplus eggs, which overload their parental care ability.|$|R
5|$|Blakeney Point {{has been}} {{designated}} {{as one of the}} most important sites in Europe for nesting terns by the government's Joint Nature Conservation Committee. In the early 1900s, the small colonies of common and little terns were badly affected by egg-taking, disturbance and shooting, but as protection improved the common terns population rose to 2,000 pairs by mid-century, although it subsequently declined to no more than 165 pairs by 2000, perhaps due to predation. Sandwich terns were a scarce breeder until the 1970s, but there were 4,000 pairs by 1992. Blakeney is the most important site in Britain for both Sandwich and little terns, the roughly 200 pairs of the latter species amounting to eightper cent of the British population. The 2,000 pairs of black-headed gulls sharing the breeding area with the terns are believed to protect the colony as a whole from predators like red foxes. Other nesting birds include about 20 pairs of Arctic terns and a few Mediterranean gulls in the tern colony, ringed plovers and oystercatchers on the shingle and common redshanks on the salt marsh. The waders' breeding success has been compromised by human disturbance and predation by gulls, weasels and stoats, with ringed plovers particularly affected, declining to 12 pairs in 2012 compared to 100 pairs twenty years previously. The pastures contain breeding northern lapwings, and species such as sedge and reed warblers and <b>bearded</b> <b>tits</b> are found in patches of common reed.|$|R
50|$|The {{island is}} known for being {{possibly}} the most important breeding area for the aquatic warbler. OTOP, the Polish Society for the Protection of Birds bought 1.8 square kilometres of the island. The whole island covers some 3 km2 {{and is the only}} reserve owned by OTOP. The number of aquatic warblers on the island depends on the water level and the available vegetation. There were between 55 singing males in the late 1990s. The island consists of large meadows, pastures, and it has large reed beds. Numerous other breeding birds include: marsh and Montagu's harriers, Eurasian curlew, common redshank and <b>bearded</b> <b>tit.</b> Other species include white-tailed eagle, black kite and lesser spotted eagle. On passage there are numerous flocks of geese, waterfowl, cranes and waders. The other forms of wildlife include wild boar and occasionally otter. The site is frequented by birders and is placed ideally for those driving to Poland via Germany.|$|E
50|$|The marshes around Cley are internationally {{important}} for their populations of rare breeding and visiting birds. Cley Marshes bird reserve {{has been in}} the care of the Norfolk Wildlife Trust since 1926, making it the oldest county Wildlife Trust reserve in Britain. Among resident breeding birds are avocet, <b>bearded</b> <b>tit,</b> bittern, marsh harrier and spoonbill. Winter visitors include brent geese, wigeon, pintail and many species of wading birds. Cley, like neighbouring Salthouse is ideally situated at the apex of the North Norfolk coast as a staging ground for passage migrants, vagrants and rareties of all kinds. A new eco-friendly visitor centre opened in 2007 containing a café, shop, viewing areas (including viewing from a camera on the reserve), exhibition area, interpretation and toilets. The view from the visitor centre across the marsh to the sea is breathtaking. Cley Marshes is the home of the Bird Information Service, publishers of Birding World.The shingle bank holds large numbers of yellow horned poppy.|$|E

40|$|This bird report {{covers the}} years 1986 - 1987 {{and is a}} sequel to the bi-annual reports begun in the 1930 's of the maj or ornithological events {{recorded}} in the Camargue and neighbouring Crau and Alpilles. Several researchers present the results of long-term monitoring programmes and there are observations of rare species (but only those accepted by the Rareties Committee) or the more regular ones recorded in unusual numbers, or outside the normal dates of presence in the region. There were spells of severely cold weather in February 1986 and again, for the 3 rd consecutive winter, in January 1987, this latter being the more severe of the two. Flamingos and egrets suffered less than in January 1985 but passerines were hard hit, particularly Cetti's and Fan-tailed warblers and <b>Bearded</b> <b>Tits.</b> Rainfall over the two years was quite high {{and as a result}} the salinity of the Vaccarès lagoon dropped from 33 g/l to only 20 g/l by the end of 1987. All european grebes have been recorded in the delta and their numbers have increased on the Vaccarès where 1 000 or more Great-crested and around 3 000 Black-necked were censused both years. The Grey Heron breeding population continues to increase and there were a record 891 pairs censused in the Camargue area in 1986. In winter the Great White Heron is now a regular visitor with up to 35 individuals. Storks are still regular on migration with 8 Black and 43 White in autumn 1987. Record numbers of flamingos were again breeding in 1986 and 1987 with 20 000 and 17 500 pairs respectively and a record 8 590 chicks raised in 1986. In 1987, only 2 200 chicks were raised because of disturbance caused by a child's balloon blown onto the breeding island during hatching. The banding programme continues and 600 chicks were marked each year. During the cold spell of January 1987 about 100 flamingos died, one of the victims being marked with an Iranian ring from Lake Rezaiyeh. Waterfowl counts revealed record numbers of Shelducks in February, with 2 745 in 1986 and 3 590 in 1987. The Mute Swan breeding population continues to increase in the area and the Bewick's peaked at 105 in January 1986. A small flock of Grey-lag Geese now winters in the Camargue and one bird has been seen wearing a Swedish ring. Midwinter counts of ducks and coots have now been made over 24 consecutive seasons. Although Gadwall and Shoveler numbers have increased in recent years the overall numbers of ducks have decreased for the thirteenth consecutive winter. This decline is attributed mainly to excessive hunting and an increase in the salinity of Camargue lagoons. Other notorious winter visitors to the delta have been Sea and Booted Eagles in 1986 and 1987, and 7 cranes in 1986. Amongst the rarer waders is the 4 th record of a Pectoral Sandpiper, a spring report of Buff-breasted Sandpiper and several observations of Wilson's Phalarope, Terek Sandpjper and Black-winged Pratincole. Finally, a record 193 pairs of Slender-billed Gulls bred in 1987 and 35 pairs of Mediterranean gulls in 1986...|$|R
40|$|The <b>Bearded</b> <b>Tit</b> (Panurus biarmicus) {{is a small}} {{passerine}} bird occurring only in wetland habitats. Three subspecies of the <b>Bearded</b> <b>Tit</b> {{are known}} from Turkey. The endemic subspecies Panurus biarmicus kosswigi has only been recorded from Amik Lake in Turkey. This subspecies is now considered extinct; the apparent cause of this extinction was the drought affecting the lake. Other subpopulations might be similarly threatened by habitat loss. Therefore, {{it is important to}} investigate the morphometric characteristics and genetic variation of these local subpopulations. In this study, body weights and 12 morphometric characters were measured for <b>Bearded</b> <b>Tit</b> individuals in the Eber Lake and Behi?bey reedbed subpopulations. Statistically significant differences were found in extended wing length, maximum wing chord, and weight between the 2 subpopulations. Allozymic variation was also studied in the 2 subpopulations. Genetic variation was assessed using isozyme systems, and 8 of 21 loci (Pgm, Me-I, Me-II, Fum, Est, Mpi, Pgd, and Acon-M) were found to be polymorphic. The percentage of polymorphic loci was higher at Eber Lake (P 95 % = 38. 1 %) than in the Behi?bey reedbed (P 95 % = 33. 3 %). The mean FST (0. 048) and Nm (5. 0) values showed high levels of gene flow between these subpopulations...|$|E
