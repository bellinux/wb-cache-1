25|$|The local dialect of Lowland Scots {{is often}} known as Doric, and is spoken {{not just in}} the city, <b>but</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> {{north-east}} of Scotland.

25|$|The Panic of 1873 (a depression) hit the Southern economy {{hard and}} disillusioned many Republicans who had gambled that railroads would pull the South {{out of its}} poverty. The price of cotton fell by half; many small landowners, local merchants and cotton factors (wholesalers) went bankrupt. Sharecropping for black and white farmers became more common {{as a way to}} spread the risk of owning land. The old {{abolitionist}} element in the North was aging away, or had lost interest, and was not replenished. Many carpetbaggers returned to the North or joined the Redeemers. Blacks had an increased voice in the Republican Party, <b>but</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> South it was divided by internal bickering and was rapidly losing its cohesion. Many local black leaders started emphasizing individual economic progress in cooperation with white elites, rather than racial political progress in opposition to them, a conservative attitude that foreshadowed Booker T. Washington.|$|E
25|$|The fall {{came when}} Fratianno became the second American Mafioso to turn state's {{evidence}} and testify against the Mafia in court. He made this decision upon {{learning from the}} F.B.I. that Dominic Brooklier ordered his death. Brooklier, who didn't trust Fratianno, ordered the hit because Fratianno was presenting himself as boss {{of the family and}} felt {{that he was trying to}} usurp him. Fratianno testified against mobsters not only in Los Angeles, <b>but</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> country. Although the Justice Department thought it finally crippled the Mafia in Los Angeles, a Federal Judge gave Brooklier, Sciortino, Michael Rizzitello, Dragna, and Jack LoCicero light sentences ranging from two to five years in 1981 for racketeering and extortion. Brooklier still ran the family from his prison cell until he died of a heart attack in 1984. With Brooklier's imprisonment, capo Peter Milano quickly stepped up and began running the family in 1981.|$|E

25|$|The {{concept of}} {{religion}} is a social construct, since in other eras, religion, culture, and even national identity were often inseparable. And as for spirituality, {{this is an old}} concept with a new usage. Previous to today’s era, what people today call spirituality was often called piety. Professor of Theology, Linda Mercadante sees religion as a complex adaptive network of myths, symbols, rituals and concepts that simultaneously figure patterns of feeling, thinking, and acting and disrupt stable structures of meaning and purpose. When understood in that way, religion not only involves ideas and practices that are manifestly religious but also includes a broad range of cultural phenomena not ordinarily associated with religion. Many people use spirituality to refer to their interior life of faith and religion to mean the necessary communal and/or organizational part. Mercadante sees both spirituality and religion as consisting of four basic components: beliefs, desire, rituals, and behavioural expectations, <b>but</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> field of Religious Studies the definitions vary. When Mercadante has spoken with SBNRs, they take a decidedly anti-dogmatic stance against religious belief in general. They claim not only that belief is non-essential, but that it is potentially harmful or at least a hindrance to spirituality.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} month Ferrarin and del Prete did indeed cross the Atlantic in the S.64, not to New York, <b>but</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> South Atlantic to Brazil. Departing Montecelio {{on the evening}} of 3 July, they flew over Sardinia overnight, and then Gibraltar early the next morning. During 4 July their course covered Casablanca and Villa Cisneros, and by that evening they were over the Cape Verde islands and headed for Brazil. On the morning of 5 July, they were within radio range of Pernambuco. Crossing the Brazilian coast near Natal, they continued south, hoping to reach Rio de Janeiro. However, poor weather forced the aviators to turn back towards Natal. Now running low on fuel and with the weather still against them, they were forced to abandon landing there as well, since the aerodrome lay behind a row of hills. Instead, they continued north for another 160km (100mi) and made a forced landing on a beach at Touros. A Brazilian mail plane conveyed Ferrarin and del Prete first to Natal and then to Rio de Janeiro, where in both cities they were given a heroes' welcome. The S.64 suffered structural damage during its landing on the sand, and was brought to Rio de Janeiro by ship. When it arrived in the city, it was donated to Brazil. During the flight from Italy, the S.64 had covered 8,100km (5,030mi) in 48 hours, 14 minutes. The FAI officially recognised this as a flight of 7,188km (4,500mi) – the orthodromic distance between Montecelio and Natal – and a new world straight-line distance record. The festivities in Rio de Janeiro continued for weeks, but came to an end when Ferrarin and del Prete crashed during a demonstration flight in a S.62 on 11 August. Del Prete died from his injuries five days later.|$|E

500|$|While it is {{sometimes}} assumed, particularly in the United States, to have been borrowed from Arabic political discourse, its evolution has followed a circular course from Arabic to English and then back.
