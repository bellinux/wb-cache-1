5|$|At Emerson Park, {{a public}} park {{situated}} near {{the midpoint of the}} northern lakeshore, the highway turns back to the north to access Melrose Park, a community built up just north of the lake around the Owasco Outlet. Here, NY38A meets NY437, a short connector highway linking NY38A to its parent, NY38. North of Melrose Park, the route becomes known as Owasco Street as it follows the Owasco Outlet into the city of Auburn. At the city line, ownership and maintenance of the route shifts from the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) to Auburn. The route heads northeastward through the densely populated city to Walnut Street, where it splits into a one-way couplet along Fulton Street (northbound) and John and Owasco Streets (southbound). One <b>block</b> <b>to</b> the north, NY38A intersects US20 at Genesee Street. US20 joins NY38A for one <b>block</b> <b>to</b> the Auburn Arterial (NY5), where NY38A comes to an end.|$|E
