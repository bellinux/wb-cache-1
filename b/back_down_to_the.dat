5|$|Polonium-210 is {{widespread}} in the biosphere, including in human tissues, because of {{its position in the}} uranium-238 decay chain. Natural uranium-238 in the Earth's crust decays through a series of solid radioactive intermediates including radium-226 to the radioactive noble gas radon-222, some of which, during its 3.8-day half-life, diffuses into the atmosphere. There it decays through several more steps to polonium-210, much of which, during its 138-day half-life, is washed <b>back</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Earth's surface, thus entering the biosphere, before finally decaying to stable lead-206.|$|E

Formerly based at Elm Park, the club plays at the 24,161 capacity Madejski Stadium, named after chairman Sir John Madejski, and which opened in 1998. After winning the 2005–06 Football League Championship with a record of 106 points, Reading F.C. spent two seasons in the Premier League before being relegated to The Championship. For the 2012–2013 season, the club again competed in the Premier League, after securing first place in the Championship in the 2011–2012 season, but were relegated <b>back</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Championship at season's end.|$|E

5|$|Brimsek {{started the}} 1938–39 {{season with the}} Reds, {{but he would not}} stay long with them. During an NHL {{exhibition}} game, Thompson got injured and it was unlikely that Thompson would recuperate in time for the beginning of the regular season. Needing a replacement, Brimsek was called up by the Bruins. In his NHL debut, Brimsek helped his team defeat the Toronto Maple Leafs by a score of 3–2. He started in net for one more game, a 4–1 victory against the Red Wings, before being sent <b>back</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Reds as Thompson recovered. Art Ross, the Bruins' coach and general manager, had seen enough of Brimsek during his two stints in Boston to contemplate promoting Brimsek full-time with the Bruins. Thompson was traded to the Detroit Red Wings for goaltender Normie Smith and $15,000.00 U.S. cash on November 16, 1938, after playing only five games with the Bruins. Ross then proceeded to promote Brimsek as the team's new starting goalie. This did not sit well with Bruins fans as Thompson was a favorite and he was the reigning Vezina Trophy winner.|$|E
5|$|Malhotra {{suffered}} an ankle injury in November that sidelined him for four games. Upon his recovery, his play was judged by team management to have {{suffered an}}d he began to be benched. Meanwhile, the Canadian national junior team wanted the Rangers to loan him to them for the 2000 World Junior Championships. On December 12, 1999, general manager Neil Smith obliged and assigned Malhotra for the international tournament. He was then sent for a two-week conditioning assignment with the Rangers' American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Hartford Wolf Pack. On March 14, 2000, he was sent <b>back</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> OHL in order to retain his eligibility for later AHL assignment in the season. Malhotra had dressed for only four games in the two months between his return from the World Junior Championships in early-January and his junior reassignment. He was pointless in the 27 games total he played with the Rangers that season.|$|E
5|$|Marriages among ruling dynasties {{and their}} {{subjects}} have at times been common, with the marriages {{such as that}} of Edward the Confessor, King of England with Edith of Wessex and Władysław II Jagiełło, King of Poland with Elizabeth Granowska being far from unheard of in medieval Europe. However, as dynasties approached absolutism and sought to preserve loyalty among competing members of the nobility, most eventually distanced themselves from kinship ties to local nobles by marrying abroad. Marriages with subjects brought the king <b>back</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> level of those he ruled, often stimulating the ambition of his consort's family and evoking jealousy—or disdain—from the nobility. The notion that monarchs should marry into the dynasties of other monarchs to end or prevent war was, at first, a policy driven by pragmatism. During the era of absolutism, this practice contributed to the notion that it was socially, as well as politically, disadvantageous for members of ruling families to intermarry with their subjects and pass over the opportunity for marriage into a foreign dynasty.|$|E

In principle, water was available from a system of elm pipes which supplied 30,000 houses via a high water tower at Cornhill, filled from the river at high tide, and also via a reservoir of Hertfordshire spring water in Islington. It was often possible to open a pipe near a burning building and connect it to a hose to play on a fire or fill buckets. Further, Pudding Lane {{was close to the}} river. Theoretically, all the lanes from the river up to the bakery and adjoining buildings should have been manned with double rows of firefighters passing full buckets up to the fire and empty buckets <b>back</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> river.|$|E

5|$|When sandhoppers (such as Talitrus saltator) {{are taken}} up a beach, they easily {{find their way}} <b>back</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sea.

A group of sandhoppers were acclimatised to a day/night cycle under artificial lighting, whose timing was gradually changed until it was 12 hours out of phase with the natural cycle. Then, the sandhoppers were placed on the beach in natural sunlight. They moved away from the sea, up the beach. The experiment implied that the sandhoppers use the sun and their internal clock to determine their heading, and that they had learnt the actual direction down to the sea on their particular beach.|$|E
5|$|After {{the train}} departs from the station, it {{immediately}} begins {{to climb the}} vertical (90 degree) lift hill. Upon reaching {{the top of the}} lift, the train turns 45 degrees backwards putting the train and its riders in an upside down position. Then, as the train exits the lift, it goes through a heartline roll before going down the only drop in the layout of the roller coaster. The train speeds through the station going back up the lift. Once it loses momentum the train then returns down passing through the station again. It then proceeds back up the drop and partially into the heartline roll before once again losing momentum and returning to the ground. After passing the station for the third time, the train is stopped {{near the top of the}} lift hill. It is then lowered <b>back</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> station where the next riders board the train. The XT 150 has the option of sending riders around a second cycle at the operator's discretion. When the train stops on the lift hill at the end of the ride, instead of lowering slowly back to the station, the chain will raise the car up and send it through the ride again.|$|E

Two of the games were against Brazil's U-21 team and the two others were against Santos FC and Saad FC. Harris {{was one of the}} two players on the roster that were not yet in college. Following the training camp, Harris moved <b>back</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> U-19 team, where {{she was a member of}} the roster for the USYS Cup in late May. Harris started in goal during the first match of the tournament against Canada on May 27 in a 6–1 win. After her appearance in the tournament, Harris once again joined the U-21 team. On July 9, she was named to the 18-player team that would represent the United States at the Nordic Cup in Denmark. She started the team's first match against Denmark on July 21 and recorded a shut out for a 1–0 victory for the United States. She also appeared in the final game of the tournament on July 27 against Sweden. She allowed one goal during the match and the United States won 2–1, taking the Nordic Cup.|$|E

5|$|The {{main event}} was a Biker Chain {{match for the}} WWE Championship between Brock Lesnar and The Undertaker. During the match, a chain was hung on a pole above the ring, and once it was {{retrieved}} {{it could be used}} as a legal weapon. After enduring a series of punches from Lesnar, Undertaker attempted to take the chain down, but the lights in the arena went out and he climbed <b>back</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ring. Taker then executed a piledriver on Lesnar onto the ring steps. Taker put Lesnar in a dragon sleeper. After getting out of the hold, Lesnar executed a F-5 to Taker. Lesnar made an attempt to go for the chain, but Taker performed a chokeslam off the top rope. Following this, The Full Blooded Italians interfered in the match, trying to attack Taker. Taker threw them out of the ring and did a suicide dive onto them after performing a Last Ride on Lesnar. He then retrieved the chain off the pole and wrapped it around it his fist, planning to strike Lesnar with it. Vince McMahon interfered and pushed Taker off the top rope. Lesnar then punched Taker with the chain to retain the title.|$|E
5|$|The {{technique}} of flight among procellariids depends on foraging methods. Compared {{to an average}} bird, all procellariids have a high aspect ratio (meaning their wings are long and narrow) and a heavy wing loading. Therefore, they must maintain a high speed {{in order to remain}} in the air. Most procellariids use two techniques to do this, namely, dynamic soaring and slope soaring. Dynamic soaring involves gliding across wave fronts, thus taking advantage of the vertical wind gradient and minimising the effort required to stay in the air. Slope soaring is more straightforward: the procellariid turns to the wind, gaining height, from where it can then glide <b>back</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sea. Most procellariids aid their flight by means of flap-glides, where bursts of flapping are followed by a period of gliding; the amount of flapping dependent on the strength of the wind and the choppiness of the water. Shearwaters and other larger petrels, which have lower aspect ratio, must make more use of flapping to remain airborne than gadfly petrels. Because of the high speeds required for flight, procellariids need to either run or face into a strong wind in order to take off.|$|E
