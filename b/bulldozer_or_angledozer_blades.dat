Despite having a visibly grainy nature, these kinds of flowing granular matter are described surprisingly well (as...|$|R
50|$|The {{ground was}} cleared and, if swampy, {{a layer of}} coir (also known as Coco Peat) or coconut matting laid down. The Sommerfeld track was {{unrolled}} over the ground, pulled tight by a tractor, <b>bulldozer,</b> <b>or</b> similar vehicle, then fastened {{to the ground with}} angle-iron pickets. A typical runway made of Sommerfeld tracking was 3000 ft by 156 ft.|$|R

5000|$|Rabin later {{recounted the}} horror of seeing art crushed and artists arrested: [...] "It was very {{frightening}} … The bulldozer {{was a symbol of}} an authoritarian regime just like the Soviet tanks in Prague." [...] Two of his own paintings - a landscape and a still life - were among those flattened by <b>bulldozers</b> <b>or</b> burned by the invading KGB.|$|R
50|$|Prolonged use places {{enormous}} {{strain on}} the drive transmission and {{the mechanics of the}} tracks, which must be overhauled or replaced regularly. It is common to see tracked vehicles such as <b>bulldozers</b> <b>or</b> tanks transported long distances by a wheeled carrier such as a tank transporter or train, though technological advances have made this practice less common among tracked military vehicles than it once was.|$|R
5000|$|The term is {{also used}} for a carrier with a scraperlike self-loading device drawn by a tractor, pushed by a <b>bulldozer</b> <b>or</b> self-propelled. It is used {{especially}} for hauling earth and crushed rock [...] Similarly in agricultural parlance it {{is often used to}} describe a platform device mounted to the rear three point linkage of smaller tractors for carrying materials particularly tools or stock feed.|$|R
50|$|Today’s bermed earth {{structures}} are built quite differently {{from those of}} the past. Common construction employs large amounts of steel reinforced concrete acting as structural support and building shell. <b>Bulldozers</b> <b>or</b> bobcats are used to pile earth around the building and on the roof instead of stacking earth in place. One modern example of bermed earth structures is the Hockerton Housing Project, a community of 5 homes in Nottinghamshire, England.|$|R
5000|$|Jägerbomb, <b>or</b> <b>Bulldozer,</b> <b>or</b> Blaster: a shot {{glass with}} Jägermeister {{dropped into a}} glass of half a can of Red Bull. In German {{speaking}} countries this drink is called Fliegender Hirsch (Flying Deer). It can also be made by filling a shot glass with half Jägermeister and half Red Bull or by placing a shot glass full of Jägermeister {{at the bottom of}} a glass and filling with Red Bull.|$|R
5|$|Military winter service {{vehicles}} are heavily armoured {{to allow for}} their use in combat zones, especially in Arctic and mountain warfare, and often based on combat <b>bulldozers</b> <b>or</b> Humvees. Military winter {{service vehicles}} {{have been used by}} the United Nations, Kosovo Force, and the US Army in Central Europe during the Kosovo War, while during the Cold War, the Royal Marines and Royal Corps of Signals deployed a number of tracked vehicles in Norway to patrol the NATO border with the Soviet Union.|$|R
50|$|Environmental {{restoration}} involves {{many different}} approaches and technologies {{depending on the}} requirements of the situation. It can involve heavy equipment like cranes, graders, <b>bulldozers,</b> <b>or</b> excavators, and also hand processes like the planting of trees and other vegetation. It can involve high-tech processes such as those applied in the careful environmental control required in fish-hatchery procedures. Today, computerized regulation is often being utilized in these processes. Computer-based mapping has also become an important dimension of restorative work, as has computer modeling.|$|R

50|$|In modern {{military}} engineering, a berm is the earthen or sod wall or parapet itself, {{especially a}} low earthen wall {{adjacent to a}} ditch. The digging of the ditch (often by a <b>bulldozer</b> <b>or</b> military engineering vehicle) can provide the soil from which the berm is constructed. Walls constructed in this manner are an effective obstacle to vehicles, including most armoured fighting vehicles, but are easily crossed by infantry. Because of the ease of construction, such walls can be made {{hundreds or thousands of}} kilometres long.|$|R
5000|$|Two months later: [...] "It's {{not that}} they're coming here with <b>bulldozers</b> <b>or</b> getting {{the army to}} move us. It's that they're trying to starve us out of our home. … They won't support us {{becoming}} sustainable in our own right. If you're made to feel a second-class humanity, if it's not ethnic cleansing, please {{let me know what}} is." [...] Utopia, which is world-famous for its dot paintings, was trying to start its own cattle business and wanted to be a cultural centre, she said.|$|R
50|$|Roller-compacted {{concrete}} - (RCC) or rolled concrete is {{a special}} blend of concrete that has the same ingredients as conventional concrete but in different ratios. It has cement, water, and aggregates, but RCC is much drier and essentially has no slump. RCC is placed {{in a manner similar}} to paving, often by dump trucks or conveyors, spread by <b>bulldozers</b> <b>or</b> special modified asphalt pavers. After placement it is compacted by vibratory rollers. The “stiff” nature of RCC may require a paddle type pugmill to force the materials to mix completely and discharge easily.|$|R
5000|$|Nicolai Ouroussoff, the {{architecture}} critic of The New York Times, {{published an article}} asking whether Niemeyer's last work had been affected by advanced age. Ouroussoff found the [...] "Niterói Contemporary Art Museum" [...] to be of significantly lower quality than the architect's earlier works. He argued that [...] "the greatest threat to Mr. Niemeyer's remarkable legacy {{may not be the}} developer's <b>bulldozer</b> <b>or</b> insensitive city planners, but Mr. Niemeyer himself." [...] He considers iconic works at [...] "Esplanada dos Ministérios" [...] to [...] "have been marred by the architect's own hand." ...|$|R
5000|$|Roller-compacted {{concrete}} (RCC) or rolled concrete (rollcrete) is {{a special}} blend of concrete that has essentially the same ingredients as conventional concrete but in different ratios, and increasingly with partial substitution of fly ash for Portland cement. [...] RCC {{is a mix of}} cement/fly ash, water, sand, aggregate and common additives, but contains much less water. The produced mix is drier and essentially has no slump. RCC is placed {{in a manner similar to}} paving; the material is delivered by dump trucks or conveyors, spread by small <b>bulldozers</b> <b>or</b> specially modified asphalt pavers, and then compacted by vibratory rollers.|$|R
2500|$|After the BLM {{announced}} that it would release the gathered cattle, Bundy demanded that the county sheriff disarm the National Park Service [...] "at Lake Mead and Red Rock park and all other parks where the federal government claims they have jurisdiction over." [...] He requested that the arms be delivered within one hour. Bundy further demanded that county <b>bulldozers</b> <b>or</b> loaders be used to [...] "tear down that entrance places where they ticket us and where they injure us and make us citizens pay their fees." [...] The demands, which he described as a [...] "mandate from we the people", were not met.|$|R

25|$|In many conflicts, {{demolition}} frequently {{is carried}} out by using fire—often set {{with the aid of}} accelerants—as a simple but very effective means of quickly rendering a property uninhabitable. Armored <b>bulldozers</b> <b>or</b> tanks may be used to knock out the walls of a building, causing it to collapse. Combat engineering forces may use explosives to demolish a building, or it may simply be destroyed through direct bombardment by aircraft or artillery. The end result is not always the total demolition of a building—the walls may remain standing {{in the event of a}} fire, for instance—but it does achieve the main objective of making the building unfit for habitation. However, when the Israeli military demolishes a house using armored bulldozers, it totally flattens the structure to eliminate possible hideouts for snipers and booby traps.|$|R
50|$|Stockpiles provide surge {{capacity}} to {{various parts of}} the CPP. ROM coal is delivered with large variations in production rate of tonnes per hour (tph). A ROM stockpile is used to allow the washplant to be fed coal at lower, constant rate. A simple stockpile is formed by machinery dumping coal into a pile, either from dump trucks, pushed into heaps with <b>bulldozers</b> <b>or</b> from conveyor booms. More controlled stockpiles are formed using stackers to form piles along the length of a conveyor, and reclaimers to retrieve the coal when required for product loading, etc. Taller and wider stockpiles reduce the land area required to store a set tonnage of coal. Larger coal stockpiles have a reduced rate of heat loss, leading to a higher risk of spontaneous combustion.|$|R
