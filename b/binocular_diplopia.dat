40|$|Abstract: To {{evaluate}} the phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation {{in patients with}} sensory exotropia subsequent to senile cataract. The authors prospectively studied the role of phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation on 25 patients by observing visual acuity, ocular alignment, <b>binocular</b> vision and <b>diplopia</b> pre-, 1 month post- and 3 months post-operation. The patients underwent follow-up for three months. Postoperatively, one patient had a corrected visual acuity of 20 / 50, and 24 patients had 20 / 40 or better.

50|$|<b>Binocular</b> <b>diplopia</b> is double vision arising as {{a result}} of {{strabismus}} (in layman's terms cross-eyed), the misalignment of the two eyes relative to each other either esotropia (inward) or exotropia (outward). In such a case while the fovea of one eye is directed at the object of regard, the fovea of the other is directed elsewhere, and the image of the object of regard falls on an extra-foveal area of the retina.|$|E
50|$|Middle lesions {{affecting}} the uncrossed temporal fibers are rare. These {{can result in}} a nasal or binasal hemianopia. Lesions {{in the body of the}} chiasm most commonly disrupt the crossing nasal retinal fibers. This leads to a bitemporal hemianopia. The field of vision may still be full when both eyes are open but stereovision will not be possible. However, if fusion of the images is lost, perhaps due to a preexisting phoria, <b>binocular</b> <b>diplopia</b> may result.|$|E
50|$|This {{correlation}} of particular {{areas of the}} retina in one eye with the same areas in the other is known as retinal correspondence. This relationship also gives rise to an associated phenomenon of <b>binocular</b> <b>diplopia,</b> although one that is rarely noted by those experiencing diplopia: Because the fovea of one eye corresponds to the fovea of the other, images falling on the two foveas are 'projected' to the same point in space. Thus, when the eyes are misaligned, two different objects will be perceived as superimposed in the same space. This phenomenon is known as 'visual confusion'.|$|E

40|$|A {{disparity}} gradient limit {{explains why}} the maximum amplitude of sinusoidal disparity gratings increases with decreasing disparity spatial frequency. It also {{explains why the}} largest disparity for <b>binocular</b> fusion (<b>diplopia</b> threshold) varies directly with stimulus element separation. Does a disparity gradient limit also apply to the detection of cyclopean shape? A previous study addressed this question and concluded that it does not. We examined this question by measuring the largest disparity amplitude (dmax) at which observers could judge the shape of cyclopean disparity gratings. We used trapezoidal, triangular, sinusoidal, and square wave gratings in order to dissociate the effects of disparity gradient and disparity spatial frequency. Gabor micropatterns were used to minimize potential scale-dependent interactions with luminance processing. Our results support a disparity gradient limit for cyclopean shape perception, with additional factors being involved at high disparity spatial frequencies. Combining the gradient limit hypothesis with lowpass disparity filtering describes the pattern of dmax for both smooth and discontinuous surfac...|$|R

50|$|Diplopia {{can also}} occur when viewing {{with only one}} eye; this is called monocular diplopia, or, where the patient {{perceives}} more than two images, monocular polyopia. While there rarely may be serious causes behind monocular diplopia symptoms, this is much less often the case than with <b>binocular</b> <b>diplopia.</b> The differential diagnosis of multiple image perception includes the consideration of such conditions as corneal surface keratoconus, subluxation of the lens, a structural defect within the eye, a lesion in the anterior visual cortex or non-organic conditions, however diffraction-based (rather than geometrical) optical models have shown that common optical conditions, especially astigmatism, can also produce this symptom.|$|E
50|$|Temporary <b>binocular</b> <b>diplopia</b> can {{be caused}} by alcohol {{intoxication}} or head injuries, such as concussion (if temporary double vision does not resolve quickly, one should see an optometrist or ophthalmologist immediately). It can also be a side effect of benzodiazepines or opioids, particularly if used in larger doses for recreation, the anti-epileptic drugs Phenytoin and Zonisamide, and the anti-convulsant drug Lamotrigine, as well as the hypnotic drug Zolpidem and the dissociative drugs Ketamine and Dextromethorphan. Temporary diplopia can also be caused by tired and/or strained eye muscles or voluntarily. If diplopia appears with other symptoms such as fatigue and acute or chronic pain, the patient should see an ophthalmologist immediately.|$|E
50|$|Epiretinal {{membrane}} is {{a disease}} of the eye in response {{to changes in the}} vitreous humor or more rarely, diabetes. It is also called macular pucker. Sometimes, as a result of immune system response to protect the retina, cells converge in the macular area as the vitreous ages and pulls away in posterior vitreous detachment (PVD). PVD can create minor damage to the retina, stimulating exudate, inflammation, and leucocyte response. These cells can form a transparent layer gradually and, like all scar tissue, tighten to create tension on the retina which may bulge and pucker (e.g., macular pucker), or even cause swelling or macular edema. Often this results in distortions of vision that are clearly visible as bowing ←→ when looking at lines on chart paper (or an Amsler grid) within the macular area, or central 1.0 degree of visual arc. Usually it occurs in one eye first, and may cause <b>binocular</b> <b>diplopia</b> or double vision if the image from one eye is too different from the image of the other eye. The distortions can make objects look different in size (usually larger = macropsia), especially in the central portion of the visual field, creating a localized or field dependent aniseikonia that cannot be fully corrected optically with glasses. Partial correction often improves the binocular vision considerably though. In the young (under 50 years of age), these cells occasionally pull free and disintegrate on their own; but in the majority of sufferers (over 60 years of age) the condition is permanent. The underlying photoreceptor cells, rod cells and cone cells, are usually not damaged unless the membrane becomes quite thick and hard; so usually there is no macular degeneration.|$|E

Complete bilateral sixth cranial nerve and partial left third cranial nerve palsies were noted. Brain computed tomography and cerebral angiography revealed a Barrow Type C dural arteriovenous fistula. The patient underwent gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) at a dose of 18 Gy and a target volume of 3. 3  mL. Within 1 month of GKRS, the patient reported an improvement in diplopia, but 4 months following the procedure, he experienced micropsia, metamorphopsia, and darkness in his left eye. Prominent flame-shaped hemorrhages and retinal edema, the typical picture of central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO), developed in his left eye. Intraocular pressure in this eye was controlled with antiglaucoma topical medication. 5 months later, the left retina had appeared normal.

40|$|Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a rare, {{autoimmune}} {{neuromuscular junction}} disorder. Contemporary prevalence rates approach 1 / 5, 000. MG presents with painless, fluctuating, fatigable weakness involving specific muscle groups. Ocular weakness with asymmetric ptosis and <b>binocular</b> <b>diplopia</b> {{is the most}} typical initial presentation, while early or isolated oropharyngeal or limb weakness is less common. The course is variable, and most patients with initial ocular weakness develop bulbar or limb weakness within three years of initial symptom onset. MG results from antibody-mediated, T cell-dependent immunologic attack on the endplate region of the postsynaptic membrane. In patients with fatigable muscle weakness, the diagnosis of MG is supported by: 1. pharmacologic testing with edrophonium chloride that elicits unequivocal improvement in strength; 2. electrophysiologic testing with repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS) studies and/or single-fiber electromyography (SFEMG) that demonstrates a primary postsynaptic neuromuscular junctional disorder; and 3. serologic demonstration of acetylcholine receptor (AChR) or muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK) antibodies. Differential diagnosis includes congenital myasthenic syndromes, Lambert Eaton syndrome, botulism, organophosphate intoxication, mitochondrial disorders involving progressive external ophthalmoplegia, acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (AIDP), motor neuron disease, and brainstem ischemia.

40|$|Purpose: To {{describe}} a complication of retrobulbar amphotericin B injections {{in the treatment}} of invasive rhino-orbital asperigillosis. Observations: 27 year-old renal transplant recipient presented with a two-week history of headache, <b>binocular</b> <b>diplopia</b> and proptosis of the left eye. Endonasal biopsy on hospital day 3 confirmed the diagnosis of rhino-orbital invasive Aspergillus fumigatus involving the left orbital apex. In addition to systemic antifungal treatment and cessation of immunosuppression, retrobulbar amphotericin B injections (3. 5  mg/ 1  ml) combined with endoscopic local debridement were initiated when the patient developed progressive visual loss. Retrobulbar injections were administered on hospital days 8, 10, 14, 17, and 20. Endoscopic debridement occurred on hospital days 10 and 16. After the fifth retrobulbar amphotericin B injection, the patient developed acute orbital compartment syndrome with intraocular pressures ranging from 47 to 86  mmHg and vision declined to 20 / 200, requiring emergent lateral canthotomy and superior and inferior cantholysis. Close observation without further intervention resulted in return of vision to 20 / 20 and normalization of intraocular pressure. Conclusion and importance: Retrobulbar amphotericin B in combination with local debridement may be considered an alternative to exenteration for invasive aspergillosis secondary to reversible immunosuppression. To the authors' knowledge, orbital compartment syndrome secondary to retrobulbar amphotericin B administration has not previously been reported. Patients should be counseled on the risk of severe local inflammation due to amphotericin B. More research is needed to establish the most appropriate dosing, frequency, and duration of retrobulbar amphotericin B injections {{in the treatment of}} life-threatening Aspergillus infections...|$|E

40|$|To {{investigate}} the factors affecting recovery of diplopia and limited ocular motility in pediatric patients who underwent surgery for orbital wall fracture. Retrospective observational case series. In this retrospective observational case series, 150 pediatric patients (1 - 18 years old) who {{were diagnosed with}} orbital medial wall or floor fracture and underwent corrective surgery between 2004 and 2016 at Seoul National University Bundang Hospital were included. The medical records of patients with orbital medial wall or floor fracture were reviewed, including sex, age, diplopia, ocular motility, preoperative computed tomographic finding, and surgical outcomes. Factors affecting recovery of diplopia and ocular motility limitation were analyzed. Of the 150 patients (134 boys; mean age, 14. 4 years) who underwent corrective surgery for orbital wall fracture, preoperative <b>binocular</b> <b>diplopia</b> was found in 76 (50. 7 %) patients and limited ocular motility in 81 (54. 0 %). Presence of muscle incarceration or severe supraduction limitation delayed the recovery of diplopia. In case of ocular motility limitation, presence of muscle incarceration and retrobulbar hemorrhage were related with the delayed resolution. Multivariate analysis revealed supraduction limitation (Hazard ratio [HR] = 1. 74, 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 1. 19 - 2. 55), larger horizontal orbital floor defects (HR = 1. 22, 95 % CI = 1. 07 - 1. 38), and shorter time interval to first visit (HR = 0. 73) as negative prognostic factors for the recovery of diplopia. In addition, muscle incarceration (HR = 3. 53, 95 % CI = 1. 54 - 8. 07) and retrobulbar hemorrhage (HR = 3. 77, 95 % CI = 1. 45 - 9. 82) were found as negative prognostic factors for the recovery of motility limitation. Presence of muscle incarceration and retrobulbar hemorrhage, horizontal length of floor fracture, supraduction limitation, and time interval from trauma to first visit were correlated with the surgical outcomes in pediatric orbital wall fracture patients. These results strengthen that the soft tissue damage associated with bony fracture affects the orbital functional unit. When managing children with orbital wall fracture, meticulous physical examination and thorough preoperative computed tomography based evaluation will help physicians to identify damage of orbital functional unit...|$|E
