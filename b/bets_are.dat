5|$|Director Jewison can put {{his cards}} on the table, let his camera cut suspensefully to the players' intent faces, but a pool shark sinking a tricky shot into a side pocket {{undoubtedly}} offers more range. Kid also has a less compelling subplot. Away from the table, McQueen gambles on a blonde (Tuesday Weld) and on the integrity of his dealer pal, Karl Malden. Pressure comes from a conventionally vicious Southern gentleman (Rip Torn), whose pleasures include a Negro mistress, a pistol range adjacent to his parlor, and fixed card games. As Malden's wife, Ann-Margret spells trouble of another kind, though her naive impersonation of a wicked, wicked woman recalls the era when the femme fatale wore breastplates lashed together with spider web. By the time all the <b>bets</b> <b>are</b> in, Cincinnati Kid appears to hold a losing hand.|$|E

50|$|The utility {{function}} for perceived gains has two key properties: an upward slope, and concavity. (i) The upward slope {{implies that the}} person feels that more is better: a larger amount received yields greater utility, and for risky bets the person would prefer a <b>bet</b> which <b>is</b> first-order stochastically dominant over an alternative <b>bet</b> (that <b>is,</b> if the probability mass of the second <b>bet</b> <b>is</b> pushed {{to the right to}} form the first bet, then the first <b>bet</b> <b>is</b> preferred). (ii) The concavity of the {{utility function}} implies that the person is risk averse: a sure amount would always be preferred over a risky bet having the same expected value; moreover, for risky bets the person would prefer a <b>bet</b> which <b>is</b> a mean-preserving contraction of an alternative <b>bet</b> (that <b>is,</b> if some of the probability mass of the first <b>bet</b> <b>is</b> spread out without altering the mean to form the second bet, then the first <b>bet</b> <b>is</b> preferred).|$|R

500|$|Professor Ernst Lodz is a blind mentalist. As {{revealed}} both in {{the show}} and in his original biography, he {{has a long history}} with the Carnivàle. Lodz's character arc starts with Ben joining the carnival. Lodz unsuccessfully hassles the boy to work with him and to listen to his dreams. He later initiates Ruthie's death with Management's blessing to get his sight back. Upon finding out these circumstances, Ben strangles Lodz to death, reviving Ruthie in the process. Nevertheless, Lodz repeatedly appears to Ruthie and leaves her the message [...] "Sofie is the Omega" [...] on a mirror. Using Ruthie's body, Lodz also visits his lover Lila and informs her about the events leading to his death and [...] "you'll be seeing me soon [...] in the flesh." [...] Lodz's final appearance as Ruthie was not supposed to be his last. According to Clancy Brown (Brother Justin), the writers had originally planned Lodz's return as a mummy after a man sold his desiccated body to the carnies. Lodz's demise in season 1 however was planned from the beginning. Besides serving a purpose to the story, it should indicate all <b>bets</b> <b>are</b> off for the other characters.|$|E
500|$|Stephen Thomas Erlewine {{wrote that}} prior to Nirvana, [...] "alternative music was {{consigned}} to specialty sections of record stores, and major labels considered it to be, at the very most, a tax write-off". Following the release of Nevermind, [...] "nothing was ever quite the same, for better and for worse". The success of Nevermind not only popularized grunge, but also established [...] "the cultural and commercial viability of alternative rock in general". While other alternative bands had hits before, Nirvana [...] "broke down the doors forever", according to Erlewine. Erlewine further stated that Nirvana's breakthrough [...] "didn't eliminate the underground", but rather [...] "just gave it more exposure". In 1992, Jon Pareles of The New York Times reported that Nirvana's breakthrough had made others in the alternative scene impatient for achieving similar success, noting, [...] "Suddenly, all <b>bets</b> <b>are</b> off. No one has the inside track on which of dozens, perhaps hundreds, of ornery, obstreperous, unkempt bands might next appeal to the mall-walking millions".

I'm going to use it in a way where it actually says 'missing reel' for 10 seconds, and then when we come back, you're arriving in the third act. [...] The late second acts in movies are usually the most predictable and the most boring, that's where the good guy really turns out to be the bad guy, and the bad guy is really good, and the couple becomes friends.

500|$|Nevermind {{not only}} popularized the Seattle grunge {{movement}} but also brought alternative rock {{as a whole}} into the mainstream, establishing its commercial and cultural viability. Neverminds success surprised Nirvana's contemporaries, who felt dwarfed by its impact. Fugazi's Guy Picciotto later commented: [...] "It was like our record {{could have been a}} hobo pissing in the forest for the amount of impact it had. [...] It felt like we were playing ukuleles all of a sudden because of the disparity of the impact of what they did". Karen Schoemer of the New York Times added that [...] "What's unusual about Nirvana's [...] "Nevermind" [...] is that it caters to neither a mainstream audience nor the indie rock fans who supported the group's debut album." [...] In 1992, Jon Pareles of The New York Times described that {{in the aftermath of the}} album's breakthrough, [...] "Suddenly, all <b>bets</b> <b>are</b> off.

2500|$|The players' {{object is}} to win money by {{creating}} card totals that {{turn out to be}} higher than the dealer's hand but do not exceed 21 ("busting"/"breaking"), or alternatively by allowing the dealer to take additional cards until he/she busts. On their turn, players must choose whether to [...] "hit" [...] (take a card), [...] "stand" [...] (end their turn), [...] "double" [...] (double wager, take a single card and finish), [...] "split" [...] (if the two cards have the same value, separate them to make two hands) or [...] "surrender" [...] (give up a half-bet and retire from the game). Number cards count as their natural value; the jack, queen, and king (also known as [...] "face cards" [...] or [...] "pictures") count as 10; aces are valued as either 1 or 11 according to the player's choice. If the hand value exceeds 21 points, it busts, and all bets on it are immediately forfeit. After all boxes have finished playing, the dealer's hand is resolved by drawing cards until the hand busts or achieves a value of 17 or higher (a dealer total of 17 including an ace, or [...] "soft 17", must be drawn to in some games and must stand in others). The dealer never doubles, splits, or surrenders. If the dealer busts, all remaining player hands win. If the dealer does not bust, each remaining bet wins if its hand is higher than the dealer's, and loses if it is lower. If a player receives 21 on the 1st and 2nd card it is considered a [...] "natural" [...] or [...] "blackjack" [...] and the player is paid out immediately unless dealer also has a natural, in which case the hand ties. In the case of a tied score, known as [...] "push" [...] or [...] "standoff", [...] <b>bets</b> <b>are</b> normally returned without adjustment; however, a blackjack beats any hand that is not a blackjack, even one with a value of 21. Wins are paid out at 1:1, or equal to the wager, except for winning, player blackjacks, which are traditionally paid at 3:2 (meaning the player receives three dollars for every two bet), or one-and-a-half times the wager. Many casinos today pay blackjacks at less than 3:2 at some tables; for instance, single-deck blackjack tables often pay 6:5 for a blackjack instead of 3:2.|$|E
