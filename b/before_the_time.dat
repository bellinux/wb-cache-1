5|$|The {{third stage}} is the {{transfer}} of memory and personality from the original person to the mature clone. For the process to maintain one branch for personality and memory, as opposed to two, a recording of the individual's mind would be required <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> of death, and would be transferred to an adult clone body after the original has died.|$|E
5|$|In around 180, Clement reached Alexandria, {{where he}} met Pantaenus, who taught at the Catechetical School of Alexandria. Eusebius {{suggests}} that Pantaenus {{was the head of}} the school, but it is controversial whether the institutions of the school were formalized in this way <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> of Origen. Clement studied under Pantaenus, and was ordained to the priesthood by Pope Julian before 189. Otherwise, virtually nothing is known of Clement's life in Alexandria. He may have been married, a conjecture supported by his writings.|$|E

5|$|Lady Gaga Live at Roseland Ballroom was {{the first}} concert {{residency}} by American singer Lady Gaga. Performed at the Roseland Ballroom in Manhattan, New York, the residency began on March 28 and concluded on April 7, 2014, after completing seven shows. It was the final event hosted by the venue after {{it was announced that}} it was being closed down and being replaced with a 42-story skyscraper. Gaga revealed that Roseland was the only venue in New York City that she had never played, although she had visited there previously to watch shows. A poster announcing the event was released, showing an old image of Gaga taken <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> she became successful as a recording artist.|$|E
5|$|The Southern Pacific Railroad from Los Angeles reached Yuma, Arizona, in 1877, Tucson in March 1880, El Paso in May 1881, {{and thus}} {{completed}} the second transcontinental railroad in December 1881. The portion in Arizona was originally {{largely in the}} Gadsden Purchase but the western part was later rerouted north of the Gila River to serve the city of Phoenix. The portion in New Mexico runs largely through the territory that had been disputed between Mexico and the United States after the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo had gone into effect, and <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> of the Gadsden Purchase. The Santa Fe Railroad Company also completed a railroad across Northern Arizona, via Prescott, Winslow, Flagstaff and Kingman in August 1883.|$|E
5|$|The {{game is a}} side-scrolling shoot 'em up and {{revolves}} around the protagonist, Lieutenant Dale Hawkins, recovering caches of hidden Stinger missiles from Arab terrorists in Oman. The game features {{a total of five}} levels with varying locations and begins with allocating five lives to the player. The main objective of the game is to locate and place time bombs on boxes containing Stinger missiles, in which the player is required to escape <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> runs out. The enemies featured in the game are Arab terrorists; the player must neutralise them by shooting them with their selected weapon, which is a handgun by default. Other weapons available in the game include machine guns, rocket launchers, and a flamethrower, which are only accessible through finding hidden crates.|$|E
50|$|A {{program with}} a similar name was also launched, much <b>before</b> <b>The</b> <b>Times</b> of Indias Lead India campaign, by Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam, the then President of India, in the early 2000s.|$|R
50|$|If the {{defrosting}} system melts all <b>the</b> ice <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>timed</b> defrosting period ends, then a small device (called a defrost limiter) {{acts like}} a thermostat and shuts off the heating element to prevent too large a temperature fluctuation, it also prevents hot blasts of air when the system starts again, should it finish defrosting early. On some early frost-free models, the defrost limiter also sends {{a signal to the}} defrost timer to start the compressor and fan as soon as it shuts off <b>the</b> heating element <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>timed</b> defrost cycle ends. When the defrost cycle is completed, the compressor and fan are allowed to cycle back on.|$|R

5|$|During the Kingdom, the Senate {{consisted}} of persons selected {{to the position}} by the King, a power which the consuls inherited {{after the end of}} the monarchy. In the very early republic, senators were primarily chosen due to their birth, but by the late Republic, and especially after Sulla, membership in the Senate became predicated on having previously held a magistracy. In the late 4th century BC, the consul's power to control Senate membership was transferred to the censor, exercised with considerable discretion, until laws passed in the late Republic formalised some kind of hearing before censorial decisions. In line with the censor's duty to protect morals, senators were required to be of good character, not have been found guilty of a criminal offence, and not be a person tainted with ignominy (e.g. bankrupts, former gladiators, prostitutes, or deserters). <b>Before</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> of Augustus, there is no evidence of any kind of property qualification. The Senate {{consisted of}} around 300 prior to the dictatorship of Sulla, but after his dictatorship, it consisted of somewhere over 500 men.|$|E
5|$|In Cuvier's {{landmark}} 1796 {{paper on}} living and fossil elephants, {{he referred to}} a single catastrophe that destroyed life {{to be replaced by}} the current forms. As a result of his studies of extinct mammals, he realized that animals such as Palaeotherium had lived <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> of the mammoths, which led him to write in terms of multiple geological catastrophes that had wiped out a series of successive faunas. By 1830, a scientific consensus had formed around his ideas as a result of paleobotany and the dinosaur and marine reptile discoveries in Britain. In Great Britain, where natural theology was very influential in the early 19th century, a group of geologists that included Buckland, and Robert Jameson insisted on explicitly linking the most recent of Cuvier's catastrophes to the biblical flood. Catastrophism had a religious overtone in Britain that was absent elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|In the Catch 'Em Mode, players must {{reveal a}} {{silhouette}} of a Pokémon by hitting bumpers. Once it is revealed, players must hit the Pokémon that appears three times with the ball as it sits in one spot <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> runs out. Egg Mode is a similar concept, though the baby Pokémon roam around the board as opposed to standard Pokémon, which stand still. As opposed to being timed, players must capture it before it returns from whence it came. Evolution Mode is also similar, requiring players to hit all of the evolution item markers in order to evolve their Pokémon that they have caught or hatched. These include several traditional means of evolution in the Pokémon series, such as stones and experience points. Lastly, Travel Mode allows players to leave the current location on their pinball board, allowing them to capture more kinds of Pokémon {{not found in the}} current area. Ruby & Sapphire featured additional bonus modes that often diverge from the standard gameplay. These modes sometimes feature rare Pokémon such as Groudon, Kyogre, and Rayquaza, and take place on separate fields. Outside of the gameplay, players may also view the Pokémon they have caught, listen to sound effects and music from the game, and view their high scores for each board.|$|E

5|$|St Mary's Church is {{an active}} Anglican parish church located in Monk's Lane, Acton, a village {{to the west of}} Nantwich, Cheshire, England. Since 1967 it has been {{designated}} a GradeI listed building. A church has been present on this site since <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> of the Domesday Survey. The tower is the oldest in Cheshire, although it had to be largely rebuilt after it fell in 1757. One unusual feature of the interior of the church is that the old stone seating around its sides has been retained. In the south aisle are some ancient carved stones dating back to the Norman era. The architectural historian Alec Clifton-Taylor includes the church in his list of 'best' English parish churches. In the churchyard is a tall 17th-century sundial. The church {{is an active}} Anglican parish church in the diocese of Chester, the archdeaconry of Macclesfield and the deanery of Nantwich. Its benefice is united with those of StDavid, Wettenhall, StOswald, Worleston, and StBartholomew, Church Minshull.|$|E

50|$|It is {{difficult}} to define <b>the</b> <b>time</b> when a cult to Zalmoxis may have existed. It is only certain that it antecedes Herodotus.
