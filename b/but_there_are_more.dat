[...] Methanol can be produced industrially from nearly any biomass, including animal waste, or from carbon dioxide and water or steam by first converting the biomass to synthesis gas in a gasifier. It can also be produced in a laboratory using electrolysis or enzymes.|$|E
2500|$|For Barbara Brend: Superficially the {{illustrations}} to Jami's stories {{are very similar}} to those of works for Tahmasp; they are complex compositions of a high level of finish, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> figures which are slightly grotesque, more youths with a slightly louche, pussycat smile, and a palette which admits more brown and purple tertiary colours. [...] The eye is pulled restlessly over the page from detail to detail. It is as though the painters had lost confidence {{in the power of the}} ostensible narrative subject to interest the viewer, and were searching for other means to hold the attention. [...] Innocence had been lost; the classic works would continue to be illustrated, but only as a vehicle for the painters' skill; they seem no longer to have a mythic hold on the imagination. [...] The future of painting was to lie in more realistic subjects, though their treatment often disguises that realism from us.|$|E
2500|$|In 1991, Jonathan Alter {{wrote in}} Newsweek {{that the book}} Generations was a [...] "provocative, erudite and {{engaging}} analysis of the rhythms of American life". However, he believed it was also [...] "an elaborate historical horoscope that will never withstand scholarly scrutiny." [...] He continued, [...] "these sequential 'peer personalities' are often silly, but the book provides reams of fresh evidence that American history is indeed cyclical, as Arthur Schlesinger Jr. and others have long argued." [...] But he complained, [...] "The generational boundaries are plainly arbitrary. The authors lump together everyone born from 1943 {{through the end of}} 1960 (Baby Boomers), a group whose two extremes have little in common. And the predictions are facile and reckless." [...] He concluded: [...] "However fun and informative, the truth about generational generalizations is that they're generally unsatisfactory." [...] Arthur E. Levine, {{a former president of the}} Teachers College of Columbia University said [...] "Generational images are stereotypes. There are some differences that stand out, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> similarities between students of the past and the present.

2500|$|Korean {{nationalist}} historiography {{has dominated}} the field of Korean studies in the Republic of Korea (South Korea) since 1945. From 1945 to the late 1960s, South Korean national historiography began {{to move away from}} biographies of heroic figures in the Korean independence movement towards analyzing nationalist incidents such as the March 1st Movement. Still, South Korean nationalist historiography aims to refute what historian Lee Ki-baek called a [...] "colonial view of Korean history", to which Japanese and foreign scholars supposedly still subscribed. One such [...] "colonial view" [...] was that the Goryeo dynasty (918–1392) was stagnant, which nationalist historians studied Goryeo institutions to try to refute with evidence of dynamism and change. <b>But</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> than twice the number of articles and monographs on the Joseon than there are for Goryeo, since South Korean historians assume that there was a potential fundamental, irreversible change from traditionalism to modernism during that time. This change, so say historians like Choe Yŏng-hŭi, which inhibited by the various Japanese invasions from the 16th century and ultimate annexation, which they blame for social instability and armed banditry. Kim Chol-choon, writing in 1970, evaluated the state of South Korean historiography as lacking a [...] "critical spirit". In 1978, nationalist historian Kang Man'gil challenged the existing periodization of South Korean history into [...] "colonial" [...] and [...] "postliberation" [...] blocs, instead suggesting that {{the second half of the}} 20th century should be characterized as one of [...] "division", preceding the creation of a unified, ethnic Korean state. His attack on the [...] "colonial" [...] Korean historiography proposed a new [...] "self-determining historiography" [...] (chuch'ejŏk sagwan). Since the 1970s, fringe elements in the South Korean historical community have also tried to resurrect Shin's irredentist focus on Manchuria. The normalization of China–South Korea relations and visits to Koreans in China have increased interest in the region, although efforts at [...] "Recovering the Ancient Lands", as one irredentist author puts it, are marginal in the public sphere.|$|E
