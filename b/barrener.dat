40|$|The grass-dwelling beetle fauna of five Pennsylvania and Maryland {{serpentine}} <b>barrens</b> {{of varying}} sizes was sampled in effort {{to assess whether}} these areas serve as refugia for rare beetle species. A number of serpentine <b>barrens</b> species show an unusual disjunct distribution, with populations in Eastern serpentine <b>barrens</b> and Midwestern prairies, and {{it was hypothesized that}} serpentine beetle species would possess a similar distribution. The number of beetle species found in each <b>barrens</b> was compared with the number of serpentine-restricted plant species in the <b>barrens</b> and the <b>barrens</b> size. The distribution of the beetles captured was analyzed using detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) to search for patterns in the distribution. A total of 13 families and 44 species were collected, of which 27 were fully identified to species. Three rare beetle species new to Pennsylvania, Longitarsus arenaceus, Graphops varians, and Cephaloscymnus z. zimmermani were found in serpentine <b>barrens.</b> Of the 27 identified species, three possessed a disjunct distribution between Eastern serpentine <b>barrens</b> and the Midwest. The number of serpentine-restricted plant in each <b>barrens</b> did not exhibit a significant relationship with the number of beetle species in each <b>barrens</b> when examined using correlation analysis. A linear regression comparing <b>barrens</b> size and the number of beetle species captured, however, was positive and marginally significant, suggesting that the size of a <b>barrens</b> is the most important predictor of the number of beetle species present. DCA showed a close relationship between the three rare species new to Pennsylvania and two of the five serpentine <b>barrens</b> sampled, New Texas and Pilot <b>barrens,</b> suggesting that these <b>barrens</b> should receive priority for conservation purposes.

40|$|To compare {{adjacent}} post oak flatwoods and <b>barrens</b> {{communities in}} south-western Indiana, we used vegetational, environmental and fire history data in multivariate analyses. <b>Barrens</b> had greater dominance by post oak and lower tree species richness, but variation in tree species composition was not {{strongly related to}} soil moisture, litter depth or other environmental gradients measured. Tree growth has been slow and variable, with little difference between the <b>barrens</b> and flatwoods. <b>Barrens</b> and flatwoods differ in herb species composition, but with considerable overlap. In the <b>barrens,</b> herbaceous vegetation composition was correlated with tree basal area, litter depth and soil moisture; in the flatwoods, it was correlated with soil moisture and microelevation. The <b>barrens</b> and flatwoods differed only slightly but significantly in environment: <b>barrens</b> soils were drier in June 1986 than flatwoods soils. Data from fire-scarred trees show no clear evidence of differences in frequency or extent of fire between the flatwoods and <b>barrens.</b> Multistemmed post oaks in the <b>barrens</b> indicate that past cutting {{may have contributed to}} these openings within the closed canopy flatwoods matrix...|$|R

40|$|The {{butterfly}} reintroduction {{project was}} proposed in a biological {{assessment of the}} Shale <b>Barren</b> Rock Cress (Nott 2006) and other species endemic to the rare shale <b>barren</b> habitats of the Appalachians. Since {{the mid to late}} 1980 ’s two species of butterfly, the Grizzled Skipper (Pyrgus Wyandot) and Olympia Marble (Euchloe olympia) have been extirpated from many West Virginia shale <b>barrens,</b> including the Little Fork shale <b>barren</b> that lies within the stewardship of NIOC Sugar Grove, West Virginia. The report, submitted to NIOC Sugar Grove and the West Virginia Department of Natural Resources, concluded that these two species should be reintroduced to the shale <b>barrens,</b> and that the use of pesticides to control Gypsy Moth eruptions should not be permitted in the vicinity of shale <b>barrens.</b> The Little Fork shale <b>barren</b> provides an ideal location for reintroduction because a) access to high security DoD installations is extremely limited, b) Grizzled Skipper larvae feed exclusively on Canada Cinquefoil (Potentilla canadiensis) which appears to benefit from minimally invasive management of the trails and open clearings adjacent to the <b>barren,</b> and c) Forest Service pesticide spraying can be controlled not to impact the <b>barren</b> and adjacent habitat. 2008 Field Seaso...|$|R

40|$|Time domain {{reflectometry}} (TDR) {{was used}} during summer 1997 {{to determine whether}} vegetation patterns follow predicted soil moisture gradients in the Pocono till <b>barrens,</b> a rare species-rich assemblage of pine <b>barrens</b> in northeastern Pennsylvania that occurs disproportionately on deposits of Illinoisan glacial till. The results provide insights into {{the relative importance of}} disturbance and abiotic factors in determining vegetation patterns and dynamics and have implications for <b>barrens</b> protection and management. Soils of <b>barrens</b> and adjacent forests did not differ in water content over all depths and drought conditions, and in the upper 15 cm of soil <b>barrens</b> on bedrock had slightly higher water contents than <b>barrens</b> on Illinoisan till. It can be inferred from these results, contrary to prevailing views, that xeric soil conditions do not maintain the barrens/forest distinction on the southern Pocono Plateau. Vegetation-driven processes that encourage wildfire and restrict nitrogen availability may instead be responsible for <b>barrens</b> maintenance. Relatively mesic conditions could explain the rapid succession of Pocono <b>barrens</b> into woodlands that has occurred since fire suppression [...] particularly in areas over bedrock. Furthermore, soils of distinct <b>barrens</b> types that were thought previously to follow moisture gradients did not differ in water content, although the abundance and diversity of wetland indicator plant species does vary between <b>barrens</b> types. Frost pockets may favor the persistence of heathlands in topographic depressions, with rhodora <b>barrens,</b> which support a greater abundance and diversity of wetland indicator species, occurring in areas subject to periodic flooding not apparent during summer 1997. Mesic soils and the historical importance of wildfire in the Pocono till <b>barrens</b> make prescribed burning a particularly appropriate management strategy for biodiversity conservation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Ear {{differentiation}} of different shade-resistance maize were studied under the shade stress using paired near isogenic, easy barren-stalk and not easy barren-stalk hybrids and inbred lines as test materials. The test verified {{the phenomenon of}} genetic defective <b>barren</b> stalk of maize preliminarily, revealed the relationship between <b>barren</b> stalk under the shade stress and ear differentiation and light intensity range inducing maize genetic defective <b>barren</b> stalk. Low light stress would make different varieties cause <b>barren</b> stalk and differences among varieties were obvious; easy <b>barren</b> stalk near-isogenic Shennong 98 A was the most sensitive to low light stress and the stress intensity should be below 38 % shade. Shade resistance of non-barren stalk near-isogenic Shennong 98 B was close to normal inbred line Chang 7 - 2 and its intensity range of light stress were between 38 %~ 60 % shade; {{there were significant differences}} between hybrids of easy <b>barren</b> stalk D 90, D 80 and non-easy <b>barren</b> stalk Zheng Dan 958 under the 75 % shade; shade stress could make young female ear short, grains per panicle reduce, the number of abortive grain increase and rates of <b>barren</b> stalk increase, which would aggravate with the increase of shade intensity and the reactions of easy <b>barren</b> stalk varieties were much more obvious, even caused 100 % <b>barren</b> stalk led by female ear agenesis...|$|R

40|$|Distinct <b>barrens</b> {{and forest}} {{vegetation}} types grow {{in close proximity}} on the Pocono Plateau of northeastern Pennsylvania. This study investigated whether organic chemicals produced by ericaceous shrubs in the <b>barrens</b> inhibit the growth of forest tree species. Germination of Betula populifolia (Gray birch, Marshall, Betulaceae) and Tsuga canadensis, (Eastern hemlock, L., Pinaceae) were not inhibited by aqueous extracts of <b>barrens</b> leaf litter or organic soil. Activated carbon applied to tree seedlings planted in the <b>barrens</b> and forest reduced mortality of Acer rubrum (Red maple, L., Aceraceae), Prunus serotina (Black cherry, Ehrh., Rosaceae), and Betula lenta (Sweet birch, L., Betulaceae) in the <b>barrens</b> {{but not in the}} forest. It increased the growth of Acer and Prunus seedlings in the <b>barrens,</b> but did not increase their growth in the forest. Organic chemicals that were absorbed by activated carbon in this experiment may contribute to the persistence of distinct forest and <b>barrens</b> vegetation types.

40|$|In vitro {{studies suggest}} that the <b>Barren</b> protein may {{function}} as an activator of DNA topoisomerase II and/or as a component of the Xenopus condensin complex. To better understand the role of <b>Barren</b> in vivo, we generated conditional alleles of the structural gene for <b>Barren</b> (BRN 1) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We show that <b>Barren</b> is an essential protein required for chromosome condensation in vivo and that it is likely to function as an intrinsic component of the yeast condensation machinery. Consistent with this view, we show that <b>Barren</b> performs an essential function during a period of the cell cycle when chromosome condensation is established and maintained. In contrast, <b>Barren</b> does not serve as an essential activator of DNA topoisomerase II in vivo. Finally, brn 1 mutants display additional phenotypes such as stretched chromosomes, aberrant anaphase spindles, and the accumulation of cells with > 2 C DNA content, suggesting that <b>Barren</b> function influences multiple aspects of chromosome transmission and dynamics...|$|R
