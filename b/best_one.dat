5|$|Gaara has ranked highly in the {{popularity}} polls for the series, continuously placing {{in the top}} ten. The last such poll was in 2011, in which Gaara was in 4th place. Several pieces of Gaara merchandise has been released; including key chains, plush dolls and action figures of his Part I and Part II appearance. AnimeCentral listed him as eighth best villain in anime with comments focused on how flashbacks made him a tragic character {{and at the same}} time similar to Naruto Uzumaki. Additionally, his fight against Rock Lee was listed as the second <b>best</b> <b>one</b> in anime for exchanges in moves and its conclusion. In 2014, IGN listed him as the third best Naruto character when the series ended.|$|E
5|$|To the north, {{from the}} Masan–Chinju highway to the Nam River, {{there were several}} easily {{defensible}} positions. The <b>best</b> <b>one</b> was the high ground near Chungam-ni, which controlled the important road junction connecting the Masan road with the one over the Nam River to Uiryong. It was essential for the 25th Infantry Division's right flank connect with the left flank of the 24th Infantry Division at {{the confluence of the}} Nam and the Naktong Rivers. Therefore, the 25th Infantry Division also moved to protect the Komam-ni road intersection where the Chindong-ni–Haman road met the Masan–Chinju highway.|$|E
5|$|With 4...Bb4+ 5.Nbd2 d6 (see diagram at right) Black {{wants to}} open the {{diagonal}} a1–h8 for his queen. After 6.exd6 Qf6 White can react to the attack on his Bf4 in several ways, the <b>best</b> <b>one</b> being 7.Nh3 to develop a piece and protect both the Bf4 and the f2-pawn. It also helps that the Bf4 is still guarding the Nd2, so that after 7...Qxb2? {{there is not the}} threat of winning the exchange (8...Bxd2+ would be answered by 9.Bxd2) and White can repel Black's attack with 8.Rb1 Qa3 9.Rb3 Qa5 10.dxc7 Nc6 11.a3! Be7 12.e3. Instead, Black must play energetically with 7...Nxf2 8.Kxf2 Bxh3 9.g3 Bxf1 10.dxc7!? Nc6 11.Rxf1 and here Lalic recommends 11...0-0 12.Kg2 Rfe8.|$|E

5|$|Ælfric died on 16 November 1005 and {{was buried}} in Abingdon Abbey, later being {{translated}} to Canterbury Cathedral. His will survives and in it he left ships {{to the people of}} Wiltshire and Kent, with his <b>best</b> <b>one,</b> equipped for sixty men, going to King Æthelred.

5|$|Back in England, Trescothick {{was called}} upon to captain England after Michael Vaughan {{sustained}} a knee injury. Although other England captains had seemed to suffer a lack of batting form, the extra authority did not affect Trescothick, and he forged a good partnership with debutant Andrew Strauss against New Zealand. This understanding developed in the second Test with a first-wicket partnership of 153; Trescothick went on to score 132, his sixth Test century. Trescothick's partnerships with Strauss were to average 52.35 in 52 innings. His first century against the West Indies followed in the second Test, and Trescothick became {{the first player to}} make centuries in both innings of a Test match at Edgbaston, and the ninth England player to score a century in each innings of a Test match. Trescothick was again England's <b>best</b> <b>One</b> Day International batsman in the 2004 ICC Champions Trophy, scoring 261 runs in just four innings, including a century in the final; he also took his fourth ODI wicket.|$|E
5|$|The {{only major}} hype related to {{commercials}} {{in the months}} leading up to Super Bowl XLI involved various campaigns to allow consumers to be involved in the creation of Super Bowl ads, inspired by consumer-generated content sites like YouTube. Frito-Lay announced a campaign in September 2006 to allow the public to submit ads for their Doritos brand and vote on the <b>best</b> <b>one,</b> which aired during the Super Bowl. Doritos actually aired two of the ads due to a close voting margin; the winning ad (featuring a chance meeting with a man and a woman that feature the qualities of Doritos) aired in the first quarter, while a second (with a checkout lady overly enamored with the product) aired in the second quarter. The five finalists each received $10,000 in this contest. General Motors announced a similar contest, open only to college students, for their Chevrolet brand; however, the ad would be produced professionally based on ideas suggested by the public. The winning ad featured men gathering around an HHR model with women in it and stripping off their clothes and giving it a car wash. The NFL itself advertised a similar contest to generate suggestions for a commercial promoting the league, with the winning concept featuring fans' disappointment that their teams' season was over.|$|E

It doesn't take account of whether the inputs are the <b>best</b> <b>ones</b> to be using, or whether the outputs are the <b>best</b> <b>ones</b> to be producing. For example, a firm that employs brain surgeons to dig ditches might still be X-efficient, even though reallocating the brain surgeons to curing the sick would be more efficient for society overall. In this sense, X-inefficiency focuses on productive efficiency and minimising costs rather than allocative efficiency and maximising welfare.|$|R

Vinet’s measure is used as an objective function to compare the behavior of the different criteria.
