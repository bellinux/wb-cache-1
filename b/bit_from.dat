5|$|From {{the advent}} of very-large-scale {{integration}} (VLSI) computer-chip fabrication technology in the 1970s until about 1986, speed-up in computer architecture was driven by doubling computer word size—the amount of information the processor can manipulate per cycle. Increasing the word size reduces the number of instructions the processor must execute to perform an operation on variables whose sizes are greater than {{the length of the}} word. For example, where an 8-bit processor must add two 16-bit integers, the processor must first add the 8 lower-order bits from each integer using the standard addition instruction, then add the 8 higher-order bits using an add-with-carry instruction and the carry <b>bit</b> <b>from</b> the lower order addition; thus, an 8-bit processor requires two instructions to complete a single operation, where a 16-bit processor would be able to complete the operation with a single instruction.|$|E

Thus the valid data range is from 0x0 to 0x03FFFFFF. The least significant bit (the right most bit) represents drive A, and the 26th <b>bit</b> <b>from</b> the right represents drive Z.|$|E
25|$|In July 2003 the Vandals filmed a live concert {{album and}} DVD at the House of Blues in Anaheim {{as part of}} Kung Fu's The Show Must Go Off! series. It was {{released}} the following year and featured mostly songs written from 1995 to 2002. 2003 also saw the release of Hollywood Potato Chip, which strayed a <b>bit</b> <b>from</b> the pop-punk formula of their 1990s work.|$|E
25|$|A Forstner bit could {{bore the}} {{mounting}} hole for the hinge, but particle board and MDF are very abrasive materials, and steel cutting edges soon wear. A tungsten carbide cutter is needed, but the complex {{shape of a}} forstner bit is difficult to manufacture in carbide, so this special drill bit with a simpler shape is commonly used. It has cutting edges of tungsten carbide brazed to a steel body; a center spur keeps the <b>bit</b> <b>from</b> wandering.|$|E

25|$|KOI8-R – 8-bit native Russian {{character}} encoding. Invented in the USSR {{for use on}} Soviet clones of American IBM and DEC computers. The Cyrillic characters go in {{the order}} of their Latin counterparts, which allowed the text to remain readable after transmission via a 7-bit line that removed the most significant <b>bit</b> <b>from</b> each byte—the result became a very rough, but readable, Latin transliteration of Cyrillic. Standard encoding of early 1990s for Unix systems and the first Russian Internet encoding.|$|E
25|$|A {{step drill}} bit is a drill bit {{that has the}} tip ground down to a {{different}} diameter. The transition between this ground diameter and the original diameter is either straight, to form a counterbore, or angled, to form a countersink. The advantage to this style is that both diameters have the same flute characteristics, which keeps the <b>bit</b> <b>from</b> clogging when drilling in softer materials, such as aluminum; in contrast, a drill bit with a slip-on collar {{does not have the}} same benefit. Most of these bits are custom-made for each application, which makes them more expensive.|$|E
25|$|The {{center of}} the bit is a tapered screw thread. This screws into the wood as the bit is turned, and pulls the bit into the wood. There {{is no need for}} any force to push the bit into the workpiece, only the torque to turn the bit. This is ideal for a bit for a hand tool. The radial cutting edges remove a slice of wood of {{thickness}} equal to the pitch of the central screw for each rotation of the bit. To pull the <b>bit</b> <b>from</b> the hole, either the female thread in the wood workpiece must be stripped, or the rotation of the bit must be reversed.|$|E

25|$|The {{next day}} {{was the first of}} three {{consecutive}} summit finishes that preceded the second rest day. Contador, alongside José Rujano, took the opportunity to further stamp his authority on the race, taking another minute and a half out of the race's other top riders. Sivtsov lost two minutes and 42 seconds to Contador, and more significantly a little over a minute to the race's other leading riders. This dropped him to sixth place overall. He lost more time on the Zoncolan the next day, though his overall position remained unchanged. Stage 15 was the first time no HTC-Highroad rider occupied a position in the top ten, as Sivtsov dropped to 12th overall by losing close to seven minutes in the Giro's queen stage. Pinotti rebounded a <b>bit</b> <b>from</b> a disappointing second half of the Giro to ride to eighth place in the stage 16 individual time trial.|$|E
25|$|The stage version {{differed}} quite a <b>bit</b> <b>from</b> the book, and {{was aimed}} primarily at adults. Toto {{was replaced with}} Imogene the Cow, and Tryxie Tryfle (a waitress) and Pastoria (a streetcar operator) were added as fellow cyclone victims. The Wicked Witch of the West was eliminated entirely in the script, and the plot became about how the four friends were allied with the usurping Wizard and were hunted as traitors to Pastoria II, the rightful King of Oz. It is unclear how much control or influence Baum had on the script; it appears {{that many of the}} changes were written by Baum against his wishes due to contractual requirements with Hamlin. Jokes in the script, mostly written by Glen MacDonough, called for explicit references to President Theodore Roosevelt, Senator Mark Hanna, Rev. Andrew Danquer, and oil magnate John D. Rockefeller. Although use of the script was rather free-form, the line about Hanna was ordered dropped as soon as Hamlin got word of his death in 1904.|$|E
25|$|Kademlia {{routing tables}} {{consist of a}} list for each bit of the node ID. (e.g. if a node ID {{consists}} of 128 bits, a node will keep 128 such lists.) A list has many entries. Every entry in a list holds the necessary data to locate another node. The data in each list entry is typically the IP address, port, and node ID of another node. Every list corresponds to a specific distance from the node. Nodes that can go in the nth list must have a differing nth <b>bit</b> <b>from</b> the node's ID; the first n-1 bits of the candidate ID must match those of the node's ID. This means {{that it is very}} easy to populate the first list as 1/2 of the nodes in the network are far away candidates. The next list can use only 1/4 of the nodes in the network (one bit closer than the first), etc.|$|E

25|$|Achieving city {{status in}} 1484, Galway celebrated its quincentenary in 1984. Galway {{in itself is}} not {{particularly}} known for its attractions, but rather for its lively atmosphere and entertainment scene. This is partly because 25% {{of the population of}} Galway (75,529 in 2011) is made up of students primarily from NUI Galway and GMIT, two third level institutes in the city. Galway is particularly popular with American tourists as Galway {{is said to be the}} most 'Irish' of Ireland's cities, and is one of the few urban areas where you are likely to hear Irish spoken, due to the fact the Gaeltacht area of Connemara is only a few kilometres away. The biggest lake in the country, Lough Corrib, is situated north of the city. The ferry to the Aran Islands is located about 40 minutes away and departs from the village of Rossaveal regularly. The Aran Islands are located in Galway Bay, and the Irish Language is by far the most used language on the islands, with the vast majority using the language regularly. As the islands are quite a <b>bit</b> <b>from</b> the mainland, cars are quite rare and the main form of transport is the bicycle.|$|E

[...] He has resisted the label of 'storyteller' and insists that his songs are not strictly autobiographical; [...] "they come from imagining someone in a particular situation. Sometimes a sequence of events happens which makes it more a story, but other times it's just that situation".

500|$|Noel Gallagher {{began working}} on [...] "Live Forever" [...] in 1991, while working for a {{building}} company {{in his hometown of}} Manchester. After his foot was crushed by a pipe in an accident, he was given a less-strenuous job working in the storeroom, allowing him more time to write songs. One night, he was listening to the Rolling Stones' album Exile on Main St.; while playing one of his own chord progressions, Gallagher noted that it sounded good against one of the vocal melodies from the album: [...] "It was the <b>bit</b> <b>from</b> [...] "Shine a Light" [...] that goes , [...] "May the good Lord shine a light on you"", Gallagher recalled. Gallagher incorporated the melody, changing the line to [...] "Maybe I don't really want to know". For a period afterwards, that was {{the only part of the}} song Gallagher had completed.|$|E

He thought the performances were fairly solid and that the overall message about the ozone layer was [...] "unsubtle but not too sledgehammery". DeCandido praised Patrick Stewart's performance of Captain Picard, noting that his [...] "anger and outrage and justified self-righteousness at the kidnapping of children modulates nicely into diplomacy when negotiating with the Aldeans and amusingly into total discomfort when he has to actually deal directly with the children". He gave the episode a score of six out of ten. James Hunt, writing for Den of Geek, said that it was [...] "a decent enough story, but not in a way that makes you want to watch it". He also felt that it was [...] "a complete throwaway episode and contains almost nothing unique to the franchise".|$|E
