25|$|Meanwhile Valdobrev {{attended}} the High School for Foreign Languages in Stara Zagora. For a Communist country behind the Iron Curtain which Bulgaria {{was at that}} time, this school was like a <b>breath</b> <b>of</b> <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> – with a discipline not so strict and teachers being lenient and having a personal approach {{to each of the}} students. They soon noticed Valdobrev's wandering mind and lack of concentration in class and created a system which tried to help him study the English language better. They gave him constant tasks to listen to and write down lyrics of new songs, perform them with his guitar in the lessons and translate the words for his classmates. These everyday concerts were the real productive education for him and later, when he was traveling over the Black Sea resorts and Germany as a street musician, he already had a set-list of 300 prepared and well-rehearsed world hit songs of any genre.|$|E

The incomes obtained from the privatisation processes represented real <b>breaths</b> <b>of</b> <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> for the economy. Today we notice the existence of hundreds of minority interests that are still waiting for a method of trading. The goal of the present study is to substantiate a solution to capitalize these minority packages of shares interests starting with the analysis of the current situation. The idea we try to develop refers to an indirect privatisation by creating a company listed on a regulated market, which will manage and trade the minoritypackages of shares in a transparent and competitive way, thus bringing added value in the economy...|$|R

500|$|Released on November 16, 2012, Omen {{was well}} {{received}} by music critics. They highlighted the drumming on the album, remarking on how Børven {{was able to}} match the skill and intensity of Blomberg. Steven Ecott of Cross Rhythms praised the drumming, guitar work, and harsh vocals. He concluded that [...] "'Omen' is a <b>breath</b> <b>of</b> <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> in the rather stale and stuffy room that black metal finds itself resting." [...] Scott Waters of HM wrote that [...] "the musicianship is beyond reproach. To simply play that fast and accurate, even for four-minute spurts, requires more than just talent.

Monfette wrote that Arizona's ultimate contribution to the season was [...] "introducing the element of childcare to Seattle Grace", which in turn gave Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) [...] "a great arc".

[...] Ben Ratliff of The New York Times described the album as possessing [...] "a kind of demented gravity, and the music bears it out: {{it is the most}} concentrated, focused Slayer record in 20 years." [...] PopMatters critic Adrien Begrand called it [...] "Slayer's best album in sixteen years and their most thought-provoking work to date", and the album was placed at number 15 on PopMatters' list of The Best Metal Albums of 2006.|$|E

Even while she wondered what it could be, the Ork plunged boldly into the mist and the other birds followed.

It also takes itself seriously, which came as a <b>breath</b> <b>of</b> <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> following the trend of wimpy tongue-in-cheek horror that had dominated the multiplexes post-Scream.

McLevy felt the introduction of Mace and the surprise twist of his Inhumanity were handled fine, but was even more pleased with the twist of [...] "having the director being a really personable, self-deprecating dork" [...] and O'Mara's performance as such. Joseph McCabe at Nerdist praised O'Mara for [...] "keeping his gravitas a safe distance below the surface", which McCabe found to be a <b>breath</b> <b>of</b> <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> from previous big introductions to the series.|$|E

[...] The columnist also enjoyed Naomi's feud with her mother, as it led to some strong scenes between the two women. However, they criticised Naomi's attempts to seduce Toadie, believing that it was not well executed and for a character [...] "designed to be a husband-stealing minx" [...] her pursuit was [...] "tepid at best".
