40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to give an {{overview}} of the access network independent <b>service</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> that can be used to order stream based services for a number of terminals with different capabilities. A <b>control</b> <b>system</b> is needed to handle the parameter negotiation and service initiation between the client and the server system. The stream based service is adapted to different access networks via the <b>control</b> <b>system's</b> parameter negotiation procedure. The stream application may also dynamically change the service parameters like bandwidth. In addition, the <b>control</b> <b>system</b> allows us to separate the <b>service</b> <b>control</b> entity from the entities involved in the service contents (e. g. playing a media stream) ...|$|R

40|$|We define {{building}} {{systems as}} systems {{that not only}} consist of the load bearing building structure and its environment, the service systems (installations), and the <b>control</b> <b>systems,</b> but also include building usage and users. Our ultimate goal is a virtual building labo-ratory for the concurrent simulation of all components of such building systems. This will be an extension of performance simulators. In this paper we focus on an efficient modeling process for deriving object-orient-ed structural models for virtual building laboratories, with the specialization towards the development, test, and maintenance of integrated <b>control</b> <b>systems.</b> We also focus on <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> that support individual user environments and that can easily be adapted {{to changes in the}} use of building systems. For the pur-pose of efficient modeling, we divide the building sys-tem domain into five domains, called <b>building,</b> <b>service,</b> <b>control,</b> functional unit, and user role domain. We present corresponding domain models that pre-define domain dependent modeling primitives for project specific building system models. All models are based on the notion of space and matter. In each domain, spaces have special semantics and build ag-gregation hierarchies, which we call “backbones”. The backbones of the domain models are linked by require-ment and spatial relations, thus composing one inte-grated building system model...|$|R

40|$|As an {{increasing}} number of people work in office buildings and new sophisticated sensor technologies become available there is, both, a need and potential, to develop more complex <b>building</b> <b>service</b> <b>controls</b> that increase the energy efficiency of buildings as well as the well-being of employees. The data required for the testing and evaluation of such <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> is usually in the form of movements and locations of office building occupants collected over long periods of time. However, such data is generally difficult to obtain for reasons ranging from the need to evaluate un-commissioned buildings to privacy concerns related to data sharing. Therefore, this study develops a pedestrian behaviour model that can simulate office occupants’ movements and locations thereby acting as a research platform that produces data for external applications. The model is integrated as it simulates not only the movements of occupants between different locations in the building but also decisions that drive the movements such as which activities occupants want to carry out throughout the day, and when and where they want to perform these activities. Furthermore, the model is based on the guidelines of (i) flexibility – the model is able to simulate movements in different building plans and represent movement patterns of different organizations; (ii) extensibility – the model uses a modular framework that enables easy adoption of more complex components and integration with other workplace related studies as and when required; and (iii) data parsimony – the model has low and simple data requirements itself...|$|R
