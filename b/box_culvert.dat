40|$|<b>Box</b> <b>culverts</b> are {{types of}} bridges used when the {{discharge}} {{in a natural}} stream crossing a road is small, and where the waterway is on relatively high embankment. They are generally cheaper than bridges, which make them the best solution when the natural streams intersect roadways.

Additionally, about 31,000customers were left without electricity. The winds downed approximately 1,000pecans trees, leaving about $3million in damage to the pecan crop.

500|$|A bypass of Clackline {{was also}} constructed, {{realigning}} [...] of Great Eastern Highway [...] {{north of the}} town. Works began in January 2007, and were completed in February 2008. The project also involved constructing overtaking lanes between Clackline and Bakers Hill, upgrading intersections in Clackline, and constructing a pedestrian underpass for a heritage trail. Clackline Brook was realigned through a large <b>box</b> <b>culvert,</b> allowing a safer crossing than the narrow Clackline Bridge on the original alignment. The bypass was originally allocated $2.4million of funding in 2006, but by January 2007 it was expected to cost almost $11million. The final project value was $9.2million. Issues and challenges in the project's design and construction included extensive rock protection requirements for the Clackline Brook culvert, drilling and blasting close to the existing highway, and protecting heritage and environmentally sensitive areas. The Clackline community welcomed the bypass, but there were concerns that the historic Clackline Bridge would be lost. The bridge has since received a permanent entry on the Heritage Council of Western Australia's Register of Heritage Places, in November 2008.|$|E

500|$|In {{the wake}} of the {{accidents}} of the 1970s and 1980s, replacement of Clackline Bridge seemed inevitable; however, both Main Roads and the Shire of Northam received letters from residents asking for the bridge to be kept. In 1988, the Shire requested that Main Roads note the preservation value of the bridge, and retain it in any plans for road realignment. A decade later, in 1998, the bridge was placed on the Northam Municipal Heritage Inventory, in categoryC – [...] "conserve if possible". In that same year, it was included in an Institute of Engineers survey of the state's large timber structures, as a current structure with [...] "very high heritage value". By this time Great Eastern Highway's bypass of Clackline was being planned, but maintenance works continued to be undertaken as needed. The bypass was eventually constructed, with works beginning in January 2007, and the project completed in February 2008. The Clackline community welcomed the bypass, but there were still concerns that the historic Clackline Bridge would be lost. The bridge has since received a permanent entry on the Heritage Council of Western Australia's Register of Heritage Places, in November 2008.

40|$|A {{renewable}} granular iron-based {{technology for}} hydrogen sulfide removal from sediment {{and water in}} <b>box</b> <b>culverts</b> and storm drains is discussed. Iron granules, including granular ferric hydroxide (GFH), granular ferric oxide (GFO) and rusted waste iron crusts (RWIC) embedded in the sediment phase removed aqueous hydrogen sulfide formed from sedimentary biological sulfate reduction. The exhausted iron granules were exposed to dissolved oxygen and this regeneration process recovered the sulfide removal capacities of the granules. The recovery is likely attributable to the oxidation of the ferrous iron precipitates film {{and the formation of}} new reactive ferric iron surface sites on the iron granules and sand particles. GFH and RWIC showed larger sulfide removal capacities in the sediment phase than GFO, likely due to the less ordered crystal structures on their surfaces.
