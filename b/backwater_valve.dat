5000|$|A <b>backwater</b> <b>valve</b> is a {{backflow}} prevention device used {{to prevent}} outbound water through a dwelling's drain pipes from re-entering -- [...] "back flowing"—into a home. The valve contains a flap that allows water to exit the home, but closes to prevent the back flow into the home.|$|E
5000|$|There {{is a big}} {{difference}} between <b>backwater</b> <b>valves</b> and backflow preventers: ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Backwater</b> <b>valves</b> {{commonly}} activate when a city's sewer {{lines are}} unable to handle {{a large amount of}} falling precipitation; this puts homes that are tied into the storm lines at risk of having water back flow into them.|$|R
50|$|The Plumbing & Drainage Institute (PDI) is an {{association}} of American manufacturers of engineered plumbing drainage specialty products. Such products include floor drains, roof drains, sanitary floor drains, cleanouts, water hammer arresters, swimming pool drains, <b>backwater</b> <b>valves,</b> grease interceptors, fixture supports, and other drainage specialties. It is located in North Andover, Massachusetts.|$|R
50|$|A {{swing check}} valve or tilting disc check valve is a check valve in which the disc, the movable part to block the flow, swings on a hinge or trunnion, either onto the seat to block reverse flow or off the seat to allow forward flow. The seat opening {{cross-section}} may be perpendicular to the centerline between the two ports or at an angle. Although {{swing check valve}}s can come in various sizes, large check valves are often swing check valves. The flapper valve in a flush-toilet mechanism {{is an example of}} this type of valve. Tank pressure holding it closed is overcome by manual lift of the flapper. It then remains open until the tank drains and the flapper falls due to gravity. Another variation of this mechanism is the clapper valve, used in applications such firefighting and fire life safety systems. A hinged gate only remains open in the inflowing direction. The clapper valve often also has a spring that keeps the gate shut when there is no forward pressure. Another example is the <b>backwater</b> <b>valve</b> (for sanitary drainage system) that protects against flooding caused by return flow of sewage waters. Such risk occurs most often in sanitary drainage systems connected to combined sewerage systems and in rainwater drainage systems. It may be caused by intense rainfall, thaw or flood.|$|E
40|$|In {{the paper}} I propose a {{decision}} {{opportunity for the}} problem of basement flooding caused by heavy precipitation: property owners can mitigate this risk before it materializes. Implementing the decision opportunity requires an active choice. Social science findings suggest comprehensive and pervasive information processing deficiencies together with contextual influences strongly affect decision behavior. Presenting the decision opportunity {{in a way that}} limits negative interference from these behavioral problems is therefore a key theme of the paper. I adopt the PrOACT approach to analyze and resolve these distinct problems. This involves exploring relevant objectives for property owners and for the presentation of the decision opportunity. I consider several technical as well as behavioral alternatives. Backwater valves represent the main group of the former and choice architectural tool sets the latter. Backwater valves block sewage backflow while choice architecture concerns how to present a choice given behavioral problems. By considering the consequences of these alternatives on the relevant objectives the process of eliminating dominated alternatives is pursued, followed by making tradeoffs which enable the identification of suggested choices. Subsequently, I propose that the mechanical <b>backwater</b> <b>valve</b> is preferable for implementing the decision opportunity. This alternative scored well on providing protection, being relatively cheap and involved few additional inconveniences relative to doing nothing about the risk. For presenting the decision opportunity the paper suggests the choice architectural tool set of customization and technology. This alternative scored well on promoting an active choice, promoting welfare increasing choices and providing guidance to property owners. However, its shortcoming is found in its limited capacity to reach all relevant property owners. The paper identifies a need for experimental evidence on the effects of these suggested measures. The starting point for such experimental explorations is further proposed to originate from the paper’s suggested choices...|$|E
30|$|Since the {{criteria}} were all spatially-explicit, a {{geographic information system}} (GIS) was used to map and quantify the number of residential buildings at risk of flooding. The spatial analysis did not, however, incorporate specific property characteristics that could reduce flood damages {{due to lack of}} available data, including property-level flood protections (e.g., <b>backwater</b> <b>valves).</b>|$|R
50|$|Stormwater is a {{major cause}} of urban {{flooding}}. Urban flooding is the inundation of land or property in a built-up environment caused by stormwater overwhelming the capacity of drainage systems, such as storm sewers. Although triggered by single events such as flash flooding or snow melt, urban flooding is a condition, characterized by its repetitive, costly and systemic impacts on communities. In areas susceptible to urban flooding, <b>backwater</b> <b>valves</b> and other infrastructure may be installed to mitigate losses.|$|R
50|$|Basement {{floor drains}} that connect to {{sanitary}} sewers {{need to be}} filled regularly to prevent the trap from drying out and sewer gas from escaping into the basement. The drain trap can be topped up automatically by the condensation from air conditioners or high-efficiency furnaces. A small tube from another downpipe is sometimes used to keep the trap from drying out. Health Canada advocates the use of special radon gas traps for floor drains that lead to soil or to a sealed sump pump. In areas where storm and sanitary sewers are combined, {{and there is the}} risk of flooding and sewage backing up, <b>backwater</b> <b>valves</b> in all basement drains may be mandated by code and definitely are recommended even if not mandated.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Backwater</b> {{sanitary}} <b>valves</b> (also {{known as}} [...] "check valves" [...] or [...] "backwater valves") are also {{often referred to}} as [...] "backflow preventers" [...] They are intended to prevent backflow of sewage on the sanitary sewer line during a flood or sewer blockage, and have no connection with potable water.|$|R
5000|$|The Institute for Catastrophic Loss Reduction (ICLR) ’s mission [...] "is {{to reduce}} {{the loss of life}} and {{property}} caused by severe weather and earthquakes through the identification and support of sustained actions that improve society’s capacity to adapt to, anticipate, mitigate, withstand and recover from natural disasters. ICLR is achieving its mission through {{the development and implementation of}} its programs Open for business, to increase the disaster resilience of small businesses, Designed for safer living, which increases the disaster resilience of homes, and RSVP cities, to increase the disaster resilience of communities." [...] In their February 2013 report, ICLR offered a number of adaptive proactive measures that municipalities could undertake to mitigate damage from sewer backup, which is a serious problem across Canada, for homeowners, municipalities and insurers. During regional sewer backup events, at the lot-side, foundation drainage could be disconnected and eavestrough downspouts angled, to limit inflow of excess water into municipal sanitary sewer systems. <b>Backwater</b> <b>valves</b> reduce the [...] "risk of sewer backup through isolation of homes from underground municipal sewers systems during sewer system surcharge." ...|$|R
