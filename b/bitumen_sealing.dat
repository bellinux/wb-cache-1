40|$|AbstractConcrete and {{reinforcement}} {{used for}} making of reinforced concrete foundations, can {{be exposed to}} different aggressive impacts of the environment. As a consequence, reinforced concrete material deteriorates in time. There is a number of methods, i. e. ways to prevent the damage of reinforced concrete foundations. In the paper are mentioned some of the methods such as: proper selection of foundation depth, construction of the gravel layer below the foundations, construction of the proper drainage and construction of adequate moist and water insulation, proper placing and curing of concrete. In additions, during design of concrete mixes, one must {{take into consideration the}} degree of exposure of concrete to the external impacts. In the design of the concrete mix, various admixtures are used, providing appropriate water-tightness of concrete and frost resistance. Also various coating chemical can be used as the additional protection of the concrete surface, such as: hydrophobic silicon impregnation chemical, epoxy resins, <b>bitumen</b> <b>sealing</b> strips or self-adhesive strips, bitumen emulsions, synthetic foils (membranes), hydro-insulation cement masses, bentonite barriers, studded foils (membranes) HDPE, bathtub –like structures [...] . A special attention must be paid to the thickness of the protective layer of the concrete, as well as (when needed) to the choice of reinforcement resistant to corrosion...|$|E

40|$|<b>Bitumen</b> sprayed <b>seals</b> are an {{effective}} and economical road surfacing technique utilised widely across the world. The premature failure of road surfacing can be detrimental to road user safety with some surfacing failures causing a reduction in skid resistance, large profile irregularity and loose stone on the road surface. This research project was commissioned by the Department of Transport and Main Roads, Queensland. The objective of this dissertation is {{to develop and implement}} an evaluation system to ensure effective investigation, design, application and evaluation of <b>bitumen</b> <b>seals.</b> The objectives are focused on roads in the Far North region of Queensland, Australia. Premature flushing of sprayed seals has been identified as the failure mode of greatest consequence. Flushing causes a reduction in skid resistance and the increased propensity for road crashes. The New Zealand TNZ P 17 Performance specification predicts the premature flushing based on texture depth measurements one (1) year after the seal is constructed. The specification has been successfully implemented in New Zealand and America. The TNZ P 17 specification has been adapted to the Far North region road network. However, due to inaccurate data used to modify the specification models the predictions may not reflect the actual seal behaviour in the Far North region. Further data collection and refinement is required. This dissertation details the process for adapting the TNZ P 17 performance specification to any region in the world, provided that accurate seal data exist...|$|R

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 26 th Annual Southern African Transport Conference 9 - 12 July 2007 "The challenges of implementing policy?", CSIR International Convention Centre, Pretoria, South Africa. ABSTRACT:Bitumen rubber chip and spray seals have been used successfully in South Africa since 1982 and mostly on road rehabilitation projects. The main advantage of <b>bitumen</b> rubber <b>seals</b> extra over a standard binder is its superior waterproofing {{as well as its}} ability to prevent reflective cracks breaking through the newly placed chip seals or asphalt overlays and its longevity. The higher spray rates together with the better rheological properties of bitumen rubber modified binders provide the following additional benefits. •Widening of working temperature range (Fraass freezing point up to softening point). •Reducing temperature sensitivity. •Longevity due to anti-oxidants in tyre buffings. •Better adhesion. •Stress absorbing qualities. •Better Average Least Dimension (ALD) aggregate stands because of high B-R stiffness. •Lesser stone embedment because of higher softening point. •Resistance to binder absorption. •Lesser pre-treatments. •Superior elasticity and fatigue. The aim {{of this paper is to}} present the South African design and construction procedures which have had widespread success. This paper describes the latest design methods as well as construction procedures of bitumen rubber chip and spray seals. Case studies are presented to describe the performance history. It is concluded that <b>bitumen</b> rubber chip <b>seals</b> are a viable and successful option on especially badly deteriorated roads where normal binders are ineffective.

40|$|Abstract. The 5. 6 km long Yellow River Bridge is {{the control}} {{engineering}} of the Baoshu highway. Design documents {{indicate that the}} adhesive layer uses modified emulsified asphalt and the spray waterproof layer is over the adhesive layer. Because the Yellow River Bridge’s single-span is too large the bridge deck is too longer, the design of waterproof bonding layer s can easily lead to the early destruction of deck. Based on the careful analysis and investigation, project and the technical advisory group decided to adopt SBS modified <b>bitumen</b> Synchronous Chip <b>Seal</b> instead of modified asphalt emulsion waterproof bonding layer. And the engineering project controls the construction process to control construction effects. This method effectively solves the phenomenon of sticking wheel. After construction, the synchronization gravel seal bond strength test, {{the results show that}} average bond strength is 0. 58 MPa at 22 ˚C, greater than the standard specification’s requirement.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} limits of spatial {{representation}} for understanding historic mobilities in a rural Australian setting. For this research, an historical GIS was populated from paper map archives denoting where and when <b>bitumen</b> roads were <b>sealed</b> in the Bega Valley, NSW. Using existing geospatial methods, a temporally sensitive network analysis was conducted, revealing a picture of regional mobility reshaped by modernist infrastructure improvements. Yet a straightforward binary pitting sealed roads as 2 ̆ 7 good 2 ̆ 7 vs unsealed roads as 2 ̆ 7 bad 2 ̆ 7 was challenged in subsequent qualitative interviews with long-time residents. Instead, a range of opinions emerged about the role that differing road surfaces played in everyday and historic mobilities. A fuller picture of the motivations and cultural associations of bitumen vs dirt road driving resulted from deploying humanities research methods of interviewing and discourse analysis. Such an approach revealed preferences and motivations that sometimes challenged inferences gained from mapping results alone. There are limits then in relying solely on historical cartographic data to produce maps and spatial representations and existing humanities techniques may hold, in some instances, greater explanatory power...|$|R
40|$|The Australian Department of Defence manages, {{maintains}} {{and operates}} twenty-four airfields around Australia. These airfields range in their size, infrastructure provisions, operational capability and environment. Over {{the last ten}} years, the management of maintenance at these airfields has uncovered unique problems, allowed trials of various maintenance approaches to be conducted and presented many opportunities to learn valuable lessons for the future. Surface enrichment of asphalt using both tar-based and bitumen-based materials has been performed on many pavements. This {{has proven to be}} an effective means of increasing the period between asphalt overlays. Such treatments require careful attention to the application rates and selection of the enrichment product. The interface between concrete and asphalt surfaced pavements presents a design challenge. If not detailed appropriately, differential thermal expansion and contraction can lead to shoving and cracking of asphalt as well as spalling of concrete. In extreme conditions, it is possible to retrofit an isolation joint to these interfaces to improve their condition. Hot <b>bitumen</b> sprayed <b>seals</b> can provide an appropriate surfacing for the operation of non-jet aircraft. While the materials and equipment are generally the same as for road pavements, the subtle design and specification differences are not commonly understood by contractors. Careful design and construction management is required to obtain the optimum sealed surface for an aircraft pavement. The repair of minor concrete spalling is likely to be required on many aircraft parking aprons. A range of materials have been trial tested with varying degrees of success. A proprietary semi-rigid epoxy {{has been found to be}} the most reliable and durable product for concrete spall repairs, with trenches of asphalt suitable for cracked slabs. Asphalt surfacings will unavoidably be segregated in isolated areas and over time aggregate will erode from the surface. Use of 14 mm asphalt surfacing, in lieu of the traditional 20 mm asphalt mix, requires grooving of the surface to achieve the required skid resistance but significantly reduces built-in segregation. Polymer modified bitumen emulsion slurries effectively treat remaining areas of segregated and eroded asphalt...|$|R
