5|$|A special <b>Ballon</b> d'Or, {{under the}} name Super <b>Ballon</b> d'Or, was awarded to Alfredo Di Stéfano in 1989, after he surpassed Johan Cruyff and Michel Platini in France Footballs voting. A decade later, France Football elected Pelé the Football Player of the Century after {{consulting}} their former <b>Ballon</b> d'Or recipients. Among the 34 previous winners, 30 cast their votes; Stanley Matthews, Omar Sívori and George Best abstained, and Lev Yashin had died. Each voter was allotted five votes worth up to five points; however, Di Stéfano only chose a first place, Platini a first and second place, and George Weah two players for fifth place. Pelé was named the greatest by 17 voters, receiving almost {{double the number of}} points earned by the runner-up, Diego Maradona.|$|E

5|$|As Messi {{developed}} into {{a combination of a}} number 8 (a creator), a 9 (scorer), and a 10 (assistant), he scored an unprecedented 73 goals and provided 29 assists in all club competitions during the 2011–12 season, producing a hat-trick or more on 10 occasions. He began the campaign by helping Barcelona win both the Spanish and European Super Cups; in the Supercopa de España, he scored three times to achieve a 5–4 aggregate victory over Real Madrid, overtaking Raúl as the competition's all-time top scorer with eight goals. At the close of the year, on 18 December, he scored twice in the FIFA Club World Cup final, a 4–0 victory over Santos, earning the Golden Ball as the best player of the tournament, as he had done two years previously. For his efforts in 2011, he again received the FIFA <b>Ballon</b> d'Or, becoming only the fourth player in history to win the <b>Ballon</b> d'Or three times, after Johan Cruyff, Michel Platini, and Marco van Basten. Additionally, he won the inaugural UEFA Best Player in Europe Award, a revival of the old-style <b>Ballon</b> d'Or. By then, Messi was already widely considered one of the best footballers in history, alongside players like Diego Maradona and Pelé.|$|E

During the time the club played in regional competitions {{until the end of}} the Catalan championship in 1940, it won a record 23 titles from a possible 38. In 2009, Barcelona became the first Spanish club to win the treble consisting of La Liga, the Copa del Rey and the UEFA Champions League, and in 2015 it became the first club in Europe to win a second treble. Barcelona has signed several high-profile players, setting the world record in transfer fees on three occasions with the purchase of Johan Cruyff in 1973, Diego Maradona in 1982 and Ronaldo in 1996. The club's players have received seven FIFA World Player of the Year awards, seven <b>Ballon</b> d'Or awards, four FIFA <b>Ballon</b> d'Ors, 3 UEFA Best Player in Europe awards and 6 European Golden Shoe awards, more than those of any other club.|$|E
5|$|Born {{and raised}} in central Argentina, Messi was {{diagnosed}} with a growth hormone deficiency as a child. At age 13, he relocated to Spain to join Barcelona, who agreed to pay for his medical treatment. After a fast progression through Barcelona's youth academy, Messi made his competitive debut aged 17 in October 2004. Despite being injury-prone during his early career, he established himself as an integral player for the club within the next three years, finishing 2007 as a finalist for both the <b>Ballon</b> d'Or and FIFA World Player of the Year award, a feat he repeated the following year. His first uninterrupted campaign came in the 2008–09 season, during which he helped Barcelona achieve the first treble in Spanish football. At 22 years old, Messi won the <b>Ballon</b> d'Or and FIFA World Player of the Year award by record voting margins.|$|E

5|$|Messi secured Barcelona's first trophy of the 2010–11 campaign, the Supercopa de España, {{by scoring}} a hat-trick in his side's second-leg 4–0 victory over Sevilla, after a first-leg defeat. Assuming a playmaking role, he was again {{instrumental}} in a Clásico on 29 November 2010, the first with José Mourinho {{in charge of}} Real Madrid, as Barcelona defeated their rivals 5–0. Messi helped the team achieve 16 consecutive league victories, a record in Spanish football, concluding with another hat-trick against Atlético Madrid on 5 February 2011. His club performances in 2010 earned him the inaugural FIFA <b>Ballon</b> d'Or, an amalgamation of the <b>Ballon</b> d'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year award, though his win was met with some criticism due to his lack of success with Argentina at the 2010 FIFA World Cup. Under the award's old format, he would have placed just outside the top three, owing his win to the votes from the international coaches and captains.|$|E
5|$|On 23 May, in {{the final}} fixture of the season, he made his debut for Real Madrid, coming-on as a 58th-minute {{substitute}} for hat-trick scorer and then-reigning FIFA <b>Ballon</b> d'Or Cristiano Ronaldo in an eventual 7–3 home win over Getafe CF. He became the youngest debutant {{in the history of}} the club at 16 years and 157 days old.|$|E
