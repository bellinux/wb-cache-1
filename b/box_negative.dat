This spillover effect of the foreign tax cut raises domestic R&D investment. We test this mechanism by combining information on patents, firm ownership and specific characteristics of patent box regimes. Empirical results from a micro-level analysis suggest that patent box regimes without a nexus requirement (patent havens) induce positive cross-border externalities on R&D activity within multinational groups.

40|$|Packing fragile {{heritage}} artefacts is {{a challenge}} almost all heritage organisations {{have to deal with}} when faced with the task of transporting or storing the artefacts. The packaging solution requires fitting the artefact correctly in order to ensure the protection and safety of the item; but also to be easy and cost effective to produce. Different techniques have been traditionally used, such as double <b>boxing,</b> padding <b>negative</b> spaces and cushioning braces. However, the introduction of 3 D technologies for documenting these artefacts enables innovative uses of this data for packaging purposes. Hence, this paper proposes the use of the generative modelling language in order to produce unique 3 D-fitted containers for packaging heritage artefacts which fit tightly the artefact, and can be made to be reusable and more durable than traditional packaging solutions. We propose to adopt an octet lattice as a low density internal structure to the proposed container. By combining the parametric package design, 3 D meshes acquisition and 3 D printing techniques, we present a technology based solution to the traditional problem of protecting these valuable artefacts for transportation and/or storing purposes...|$|R

40|$|Among {{the items}} that came to the University of Glasgow Library in 1953 from Robert O. Dougan were twenty-three <b>boxes</b> of glass <b>negatives.</b> While much {{work has been done}} on other items that came from Dougan, which {{includes}} much outstanding material of early Scottish photography, little has been done with the glass negatives. These glass negatives are the purpose of this thesis and to provide the basic context there is a description of the life and career of Robert O. Dougan and his collecting of historic photographic material and how the Dougan Collection came to the University of Glasgow Library. The twenty-three <b>boxes</b> of glass <b>negatives</b> were bought by Dougan from Rock House, Edinburgh, in the 1940 s. This had been the studio of the pioneering Scottish Photographers, David Octavius Hill and Robert Adamson in the 1840 s and had continued to be used by successive photographers until the 1940 s. Much of what comprises the Dougan Collection came from Rock House. To provide the historical context, the use of Rock House as a photographic studio, from Hill and Adamson’s time to the last main photographer there, Francis Caird Inglis, will be described. The glass negatives also link Hill and Adamson and Inglis because it was the latter who made them and most of the negatives are copies of Hill and Adamson photographs. There will be a full catalogue of the total of 328 glass negatives with positive images of each {{for the first time and}} the content analysed. The catalogue cross references the Hill and Adamson images to major collections of their work and in particular the University of Glasgow Library and the Scottish National Portrait Gallery. The circumstances of why and when the negatives were made and for what purpose will be investigated and there will be an indication of the sources of the photographs copied in the glass negatives. In conclusion any images that may only be known to survive because they were copied in the glass negatives will be highlighted...|$|R

40|$|AbstractRecently a {{uniqueness}} {{condition for}} Gibbs measures {{in terms of}} disagreement percolation (a type of dependent percolation involving two realizations) has been obtained. In general this condition is sufficient but not necessary for uniqueness. In the present paper we study the hard-core lattice gas model which we abbreviate as hard-core model. This model is not only relevant in Statistical Physics, but was recently rediscovered in Operations Research {{in the context of}} certain communication networks. First we show that the uniqueness result mentioned above implies that the critical activity for the hard-core model on a graph is at least Pc(1 − Pc), where Pc is the critical probability for site percolation on that graph. Then, for the hard-core model on bi-partite graphs, we study the probability that a given vertex v is occupied under the two extreme boundary conditions, and show that the difference can be written in terms of the probability of having a ‘path of disagreement’ from v to the boundary. This is the key to a proof that, for this case, the uniqueness condition mentioned above is also necessary, i. e. roughly speaking, phase transition is equivalent with disagreement percolation in the product space. Finally, we discuss the hard-core model on Zd with two different values of the activity, one for the even, and one for the odd vertices. It appears that the question whether this model has a unique Gibbs measure, can, in analogy with the standard ferromagnetic Ising model, be reduced to the question whether the third central moment of the surplus of odd occupied vertices for a certain class of finite <b>boxes</b> is <b>negative...</b>|$|R
