5|$|Ampelosaurus {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{completely}} known titanosaurian sauropods from Europe. Since 1989, over 500 bones discovered at the Upper Cretaceous Bellevue locality of southern France have been assigned to A. atacis. An abundant amount of well-preserved elements have been uncovered at Bellevue. In the original description, only a tooth and some vertebrae were examined. In 2005, a complete description was made by Le Loueff of all known material, allowing Ampelosaurus to <b>be</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> understood. All the material has been assigned to the species, and even though there are some differences in limb proportions, it has all been linked to individual variation.|$|E
5|$|Football on the Pacific Coast {{had been}} on the rise since the late 1910s. Early in 1922, Warner signed a {{contract}} with Stanford University in which he would begin coaching in 1924 (after his contract with Pitt expired). Health concerns, a significant pay raise and the rising status of Pacific Coast football made Warner make the big change. Years later, he wrote:I felt my health would be better on the Pacific coast. Weather conditions at Pittsburgh during the football season are rather disagreeable, and much of the late season work had to be done upon a field which was ankle deep in mud. At the close of every season I would be in poor physical condition, twice being rendered incapable of coaching while I recuperated in a hospital. Doctors advised me that the climate of the Pacific coast would <b>be</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> for a man of my age and in the work in which I was engaged.|$|E

However, in New York, she {{was not able to}} get a teacher's license because, at that time, {{bilingualism}} was considered a handicap. Therefore, her mother had to take in boarders in order to meet her financial needs and to pay the rent. After Rodriguez-Trias graduated from high school, she decided that she would like to study medicine and that her chances would <b>be</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> in Puerto Rico, because the island had a good scholarship system.|$|E

25|$|By the Middle Ages, the town's Latin {{name had}} mutated to Noviomum. The town was {{strongly}} fortified; some {{sections of the}} Roman walls still remained in late antiquity. This may explain why, around the year 531, bishop Medardus moved his seat from Vermand in the Vermandois to Noyon. (Another option was to move his seat to Saint-Quentin but the wine produced in Noyon was thought to <b>be</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> than that produced in Saint-Quentin. Other explanations are that Medardus was born near the town, at Salency, or that the place is nearer to Soissons, {{which was one of}} the royal capitals of the Merovingians.) The bishop of Noyon was also bishop of Tournai from the seventh century until Tournai was raised to a separate diocese 1146.|$|E
25|$|Having {{previously}} {{worked as a}} professional goldsmith, Gutenberg made skillful use of the knowledge of metals he had learned as a craftsman. He {{was the first to}} make type from an alloy of lead, tin, and antimony, which was critical for producing durable type that produced high-quality printed books and proved to <b>be</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> suited for printing than all other known materials. To create these lead types, Gutenberg used what is considered one of his most ingenious inventions, a special matrix enabling the quick and precise molding of new type blocks from a uniform template. His type case is estimated to have contained around 290 separate letter boxes, most of which were required for special characters, ligatures, punctuation marks, and so forth.|$|E
25|$|Actuarial science, of {{the kind}} used to project the future {{solvency}} of social security, is by nature subject to uncertainty. The SSA actually makes three predictions: optimistic, midline, and pessimistic (until the late 1980s it made 4 projections). The Social Security crisis that was developing prior to the 1983 reforms resulted from midline projections {{that turned out to}} be too optimistic. It has been argued that the overly pessimistic projections of the mid to late 1990s were partly the result of the low economic growth (according to actuary David Langer) assumptions that resulted in pushing back the projected exhaustion date (from 2028 to 2042) with each successive Trustee's report. During the heavy-boom years of the 1990s, the midline projections were too pessimistic. Obviously, projecting out 75 years is a significant challenge and, as such, the actual situation might <b>be</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> or much worse than predicted.|$|E

25|$|James Swan (as Jimmy Barnes {{was known}} for the {{earliest}} years of his life) was born in Glasgow, Scotland. He arrived in Adelaide, South Australia as a 5-year-old on 21 January 1962 with his parents Jim and Dorothy Swan and siblings John, Dorothy, Linda and Alan. Another sister, Lisa, was born in 1962 and the family eventually settled in Elizabeth. His father, Jim Swan, was a prizefighter {{and his older brother}} John Swan also works as a rock singer. John encouraged and taught Jim how to sing as he wasn't really interested initially. Shortly afterward, Barnes' parents divorced. His mother Dorothy soon remarried, to a clerk named Reg Barnes (died 3 September 2013). After her daughter Lisa was teased by a schoolmate about being adopted, Dorothy encouraged her children to change their surname to Barnes. All of them did except for the eldest brother, John, who would go on to <b>be</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> known as Swanee, eventually recording a series of albums under that name from the 1980s. This would later cause confusion about Jimmy Barnes and Swan; many thought them to be half- or stepbrothers.|$|E
25|$|Hubert {{made his}} first Winston Cup race in his first attempt with Jim Wilson's #78 team at Sears Point during the 1997 season. He would bring the #78 Hanes / Diamond Rio Ford home in the 28th position, one lap down. His next start would come in 1998 with the #19 team owned by Kurt Roehrig. He {{qualified}} an impressive 10th in his second race at Sears Point, however the #19 Bradford White Ford would finish 41st after a transmission failure 78 laps into the race. His second start during the 1998 season would come at Watkins Glen with Dan Marino and Bill Elliott's #13 team. Hubert drove the #13 FirstPlus Financial Ford to a 36th-place finish. He would return to Roehrig's team in 1999 for three races. His first start would come at Las Vegas where he qualified fourth, finishing in the 28th position. Again, Hubert raced at Sears Point where he would finish in the 33rd position, one lap down. He also attempted the Pepsi 400 at Michigan, however {{he was unable to}} qualify. In 2000, he would make one start with Penske Racing and the #12 Mobil 1 Ford. He would finish the Global Crossing @ The Glen in 33rd place after starting 16th. In 2001, Hubert qualified Buckshot Jones' #44 Georgia Pacific Dodge for the Dodge/Save Mart 350. In 2002, he would race the Sirius Satellite Radio at the Glen for Bill Davis Racing. Hubert finished the #23 Hills Brothers Coffee Dodge in the 24th position after starting 40th. He would return to the series in 2004 with Kirk Shelmerdine Racing, driving each of the road courses. At the newly renamed Infineon Raceway (formerly Sears Point Raceway) he would finish 43rd in the #72 Freddie B's Ford after running five laps at too slow of a pace for NASCAR. The Watkins Glen would <b>be</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> for Hubert as he would finish in the 29th position just one lap down. He would return to Shelmerdine's team for 2005 and attempt each of the road courses. He would make the race at Infineon, however he finished 43rd after oil pressure problems. Hubert would not make the Sirius at The Glen after qualifying was rained out. Hubert again raced for Shelmerdine in 2006 for the Dodge/Save Mart 350, but was swept up in a crash on the opening lap and once more finished last.|$|E

She followed that up in 2002, by starring in the straight-to-DVD horror film American Psycho 2 alongside William Shatner, a sequel to the 2000 film American Psycho. American Psycho 2 was panned by critics, and later, Kunis herself expressed embarrassment over the film. In 2004, Kunis starred in the film adaptation Tony n' Tina's Wedding. Although the film was shot in 2004, {{it did not have}} a theatrical release until 2007. Most critics did not like the film, which mustered a 25% approval from Rotten Tomatoes.

500|$|The National Congress of Brazil {{passed a}} large naval {{acquisition}} program on 14 December 1904, {{but it was}} two years before any ships were ordered or purchased, and while Rio Branco suggested purchasing used warships to fill the gap, nothing came of it. By 1906, two factions had developed over which types of ships should be ordered. One, supported by the British armament company Armstrong Whitworth (which eventually received the order), favored a navy centered on a small number of large warships. The other, supported by Rio Branco, preferred a larger navy composed of smaller warships. Rio Branco, in support of this measure, stated that [...] "with six small battleships we would <b>be</b> <b>much</b> <b>better.</b> If we lost one or two in combat, there would be still four or five left to fight with.

500|$|M. G. Ramachandran {{was cast}} in the title role, this being the final film of his three-film {{contract}} with Modern Theatres, following Manthiri Kumari (1950) and Sarvadhikari (1951). He was paid [...] for acting in the film. The screenplay was written {{in a way that}} would suit his then [...] "swashbucking" [...] image, as opposed to the original story where Ali Baba was a [...] "gullible simpleton". P. S. Veerappa was cast as Abu Hussain, the leader of the forty thieves. Padmini was initially given the role of the female lead Marziana, but she was replaced subsequently by Bhanumathi Ramakrishna. Bhanumathi liked the film, one of her earliest in Tamil, because she found the character a [...] "go-getter". In her autobiography, Bhanumathi noted that after she heard the story, she considered her role to <b>be</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> than that in Missamma (1955), from which she was fired after filming only four reels, adding that after she accepted to work on this film, she got more acting offers from Tamil film producers.|$|E
500|$|.....Thirteen Years Later" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. The A.V. Club Todd VanDerWerff rated the episode a [...] "B". VanDerWerff {{felt that the}} episode's comedic slant was necessary within the wider series, as he considered Millennium dark tone {{to be prone to}} unintentional comedy and that a comic episode provided an outlet for this. VanDerWerff found the script to be at its strongest when satirizing the character of Frank Black, but admitted that it [...] "falls apart" [...] when attempting to send up other subjects; he also felt that the guest appearance by Kiss felt unnecessary and contrived. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated [...] "...Thirteen Years Later" [...] one star out of five. Shearman felt that the episode had the potential to <b>be</b> <b>much</b> <b>better,</b> but that [...] "the whole concept drowns in overkill". He considered the episode's characters to too shallow and its commentary to be too heavy-handed to fully execute anything meaningful; criticism was also levelled at the guest roles by the members of Kiss.|$|E

Ramsey Isler from IGN rated the episode 8.6/10, as he thought it [...] "delivered action, suspense, mystery, and the final climax" [...] to Peter discovering his origins, and it was [...] "a great achievement that marks a big turning point for the series". Like other critics, Isler also praised Jackson and Noble's acting. Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly lauded Noble and Jackson's performances, calling Peter's change back to [...] "the secretive, bitter, scurrilous character he was before the series started" [...] a [...] "wrenching daring move {{on the part of}} the show".
