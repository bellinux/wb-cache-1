40|$|OBJECTIVE: Nowadays, capsule {{endoscopy}} (CE) is the first-line procedure after negative {{upper and}} lower gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy for obscure gastrointestinal bleeding (OGIB). Approximately, two-thirds of patients undergoing CE for OGIB will have a small-bowel abnormality. However, several patients who underwent CE for OGIB had {{the source of their}} blood loss in the stomach or in the colon. The aim of the present study is to determine the incidence of bleeding lesions missed by the previous gastroscopy/colonoscopy with CE and to evaluate the indication to repeat a new complete endoscopic workup in subjects related to a tertiary center for obscure bleeding before CE. METHODS AND METHODS: We prospectively reviewed data from 637 / 1008 patients underwent to CE for obscure bleeding in our tertiary center after performing negative gastroscopy and colonoscopy. RESULTS: CE revealed a definite or likely cause of <b>bleeding</b> <b>in</b> <b>stomach</b> in 138 / 637 patients (yield 21. 7...|$|E
40|$|A {{live animal}} model of major {{haemorrhage}} using an implanted short gastric artery was devised {{to test the}} efficacy and safety of these endo-suture devices in vivo. Pulsatile arterial bleeding was successfully reproduced in eight pigs' stomachs through incision of the pre-buried vessels. Endoscopic suturing controlled the bleeding in all animals without obvious complications. The mean operating time with the Eagle Claw V was statistically shorter than that with the Eagle Claw II machine (3. 6 verse 13. 8 minutes, p< 0. 001). A vessel-perfusion-manometry system was first established incorporating porcine stomach and splenic artery with the Erlangen model. From these investigations, it is concluded that (1) Both the vessel-perfusion-manometry system and the animal arterial haemorrhage model are reliable, reproducible and realistic methods suitable for endoscopic experiment in the laboratory settings. (2) Either three-throw knot tied endoscopically or intracorporeal endo-loop ligation can secure vessels as large as 2 mm in diameter enduring flow pressure greater than 200 mmHg. (3) It is possible to control massive arterial <b>bleeding</b> <b>in</b> <b>stomach</b> with endoscopic suturing using the novel apparatus with a curved needle. (4) The Eagle Claw V represents significant improvement over previous version, and is associated with ease of operation and higher security, which brings the technique closer to clinical applications. (Abstract shortened by UMI.) Peptic ulcer remains {{the most common cause}} of upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage. Existing endoscopic haemostatic modalities cannot securely control massive ulcer bleeding from large eroded vessels. A well-designed endoscopic suturing device has the possibility to plicate large artery. In addition, it may provide enormous potential in other forms of endo-surgery. A novel suturing device using a curved needle, the Eagle Claw, was developed. The aims of this thesis were to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the Eagle Claw II and V in arresting artificial gastric bleeding from large vessel in a laboratory setting. These devices were tested both in vitro on the bench and in vivo in live animal models. Hu Bing. "August 2005. "Adviser: Ng Ekw.

40|$|Abstract Background Lymphoma-associated hemophagocytic {{syndrome}} (LAHS) {{occurs in}} mostly extra nodal non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. LAHS arising from gastrointestinal lymphoma {{has never been}} reported. Here we report a case of gastric T-cell lymphoma-associated hemophagocytic syndrome. Case presentation A 51 -year-old woman presented with pain, redness of breasts, fever and hematemesis. Hematological examination revealed anemia. Gastroscopy revealed small <b>bleeding</b> ulcers <b>in</b> the <b>stomach</b> and the computed tomography scan showed liver tumor. She underwent total gastrectomy for gastrointestinal bleeding and the histopathology revealed gastric T-cell lymphoma. She continued to bleed from the anastomosis and died on the 8 th postoperative day. Autopsy revealed {{it to be a}} LAHS. Conclusions If Hemophagocytic syndrome (HPS) occurs in lymphoma of the gastrointestinal tract, bleeding from the primary lesion might be uncontrollable.

A routine blood test revealed that he had severe anaemia. Upper and lower endoscopy revealed no evidence of <b>bleeding</b> <b>in</b> the oesophagus, <b>stomach,</b> duodenum, terminal ileum or colorectum. He was diagnosed as having obscure gastroin-testinal bleeding. 1 Capsule endoscopy (CE) was performed and dark-bluish areas with whitish villi were detected in the jejunum (figure 1). Subsequently, double-balloon endoscopy (DBE) was performed orally and multiple dark-bluish areas coated with whitish villi were found at the distal jejunum (figure 2 A), and white debris also oozed from the lesion after a target biopsy was obtained (figure 2 B). CT revealed the main trunk of the supra-mesenteric vein to have narrowed, and the distal jejunum was not evenly enhanced (figure 3 AeD). QUESTION What is the diagnosis of the lesion...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} a surgical emergency due to GI-bleeding caused by gastrointestinal autonomic nerve tumours (GANT's) {{in a patient}} with von Recklinghausen's disease. A 72 year old female patient with von Recklinghausen's disease was admitted with maelena. Endoscopy showed no active <b>bleeding</b> <b>in</b> the <b>stomach</b> and the colon. Therefore an angio-CT-scan was performed which revealed masses of the proximal jejunum as source of bleeding. Laparotomy was indicated and a 20 cm segment of jejunum which carried multiple extraluminal tumours was resected. The source of the bleeding was a 2 cm tumour which had eroded the mucosal surface. Immunohistologically, evidence of neuronal differentiation could be shown in the spindle-formed cells with positive staining for C-Kit (CD 117), CD 34, and a locally positive staining for synaptophysine and S 100. This case report illustrates the association between neurofibromatosis and stromal tumours and should alert surgeons and gastroenterologist about gastrointestinal manifestations in patients with von Recklinghausen's disease. Se describe una urgencia quirúrgica por sangrado intestinal debido a tumor gastrointestinal de nervios autónomos (GANT) asociado a enfermedad de von Recklinghausen. Una mujer de 72 años con neurofibromatosis fue ingresada con signos de melena. La endoscopia digestiva alta y baja fue negativa. Se indicó TAC con contraste que advirtió tumores yeyunales como causa del sangrado. Se realizó laparotomía y resección de un segmento de 20 cm de yeyuno que incluía varios tumores. La causa del sangrado activo fue lesión en mucosa intestinal por erosión tumoral. El análisis por inmunohistoquímica de la pieza mostró diferenciación neuronal, con células fusiformes con tinción positiva para el C-Kit (CD 117), CD 34. Esta nota clínica pone de manifiesto la asociación entre la neurofibromatosis y los tumores estromales y debe alertar a gastroenterólogos y cirujanos sobre las posibles manifestaciones intestinales en pacientes con enfermedad de von Recklinghausen...|$|R
40|$|Acquired immune {{deficiency}} syndrome (AIDS) -related lymphoma (ARL) {{remains the}} main cause of AIDS-related deaths in the highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) era. Recently, rearrangement of MYC is associated with poor prognosis in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Here, we report a rare case of gastrointestinal (GI) -ARL with MYC rearrangements and coinfected with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection presenting with various endoscopic findings. A 38 -year-old homosexual man who presented with anemia and was diagnosed with an human immunodeficiency virus infection for the first time. GI endoscopy revealed multiple dish-like lesions, ulcerations, bloody spots, nodular masses with active <b>bleeding</b> <b>in</b> the <b>stomach,</b> erythematous flat lesions in the duodenum, and multiple nodular masses in the colon and rectum. Magnified endoscopy with narrow band imaging showed a honeycomb-like pattern without irregular microvessels in the dish-like lesions of the stomach. Biopsy specimens from the stomach, duodenum, colon, and rectum revealed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma concomitant with EBV infection that was detected by high tissue EBV-polymerase chain reaction levels and Epstein-Barr virus small RNAs in situ hybridization. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis revealed a fusion between the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) and c-MYC genes, but not between the IgH and BCL 2 loci. After 1 -mo of treatment with HAART and R-CHOP, endoscopic appearance improved remarkably, and the histological features of the biopsy specimens revealed no evidence of lymphoma. However, he died from multiple organ failure on the 139 th day after diagnosis. The cause of his poor outcome may be related to MYC rearrangement. The GI tract involvement in ARL is rarely reported, and its endoscopic findings are various and may be different from those in non-AIDS GI lymphoma; thus, we also conducted a literature review of GI-ARL cases...|$|R

The {{aim of this}} one-way blind prospective study was to evaluate {{the efficiency of the}} two-week triple therapy for Helicobacter pylori eradication <b>in</b> preventing renewed <b>bleeding</b> <b>in</b> patients with <b>stomach</b> ulcer within one year. This research included 60 hospitalized patients with bleeding stomach ulcer and positive Helicobacter pylori infection, 34 men and 26 women (average age 59. 7 years). The patients were given therapeutic scheme of omeprazol – amoxicilin – metrodinazol (OAM) eradication for 14 days. Eradication of H. pylori infection was defined as lack of proof of the infection one month or several months after therapy suspension. By applying triple OAM therapy within two weeks the eradication was successful in 72 %. In the group of 17 H. pylori positive patients there were 8 patients (47. 6 %) with repeated stomach ulcer and 3 patients (18 %) with bleeding. Within the group of 43 H. pylori negative patients there were only 2 patients (4. 65 %) with repeated stomach ulcer and 1 patient (2 %) with bleeding, during the observed period of 12 months.

30|$|So why are our {{patients}} bleeding more? Sepsis-induced coagulopathy causes <b>bleeding</b> <b>in</b> ICU patients [33], so {{the risk of}} bleeding {{is likely to be}} increased in leukaemia patients with sepsis and a large proportion of {{our patients}} indeed had sepsis at ICU admission.
