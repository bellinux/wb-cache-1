5|$|All around are pubs and brothels. The Earl of Cardigan tavern is on {{one side}} of the street, and {{opposite}} is the Rummer, whose sign shows a rummer (a short wide-brimmed glass) with a <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> <b>grapes</b> on the pole. Masonic lodges met in both taverns during the 1730s, and the Lodge at the Rummer and Grapes in nearby Channel Row was the smartest of the four founders of the Grand Lodge. The publican is adulterating a hogshead of wine, a practice recalled in the poetry of Matthew Prior who lived with his uncle Samuel Prior, the Landlord successively of both the Rummer and Grapes and the Rummer".|$|E
5|$|The {{town centre}} was {{extensively}} remodelled in the 1970s, a scheme {{financed by the}} Showering family who owned the town's cider manufactories. The scheme included a new library (in a faithful copy of a former inn, The <b>Bunch</b> <b>of</b> <b>Grapes,</b> which had been demolished), and a new entertainment complex called The Centre, entirely in concrete, {{on the eastern side}} of the market square. When the allegedly Roman Chi Rho amulet was found in the Fosse Lane excavations in the 1990s, the complex was renamed The Amulet in honour of the find. It has recently been renamed again as The Academy.|$|E

25|$|A {{very rare}} type of {{parasitic}} twinning {{is one where}} a single viable twin is endangered when the other zygote becomes cancerous, or molar. This means that the molar zygote's cellular division continues unchecked, resulting in a cancerous growth that overtakes the viable fetus. Typically, this results when one twin has either triploidy or complete paternal uniparental disomy, resulting in little or no fetus and a cancerous, overgrown placenta, resembling a <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> <b>grapes.</b>|$|E
25|$|On the {{southern}} {{portion of the}} cloister terrace is {{an image of the}} Virgin and Child. The statue of the Virgin of Belém, also referred to as Nossa Senhora de Bom Successo (Our Lady of Good Success), Nossa Senhora das Uvas (Our Lady of the Grapes) or the Virgem da Boa Viagem (Virgin of Safe Homecoming) is depicted holding a child in her right hand and a <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> <b>grapes</b> in her left.|$|E
25|$|The most known molly-house in 18th century London {{was the one}} {{owned by}} Mother Clap, which had been open from 1724 until 1726, when a raid {{sustained}} by the Societies for the Reformation of Manners had it dismantled. It was located in Field Lane, near to another tavern The <b>Bunch</b> <b>of</b> <b>Grapes</b> in Holborn, a suburban parish of Middlesex {{a short distance from}} the City of London. This area came to be renowned as a rookery in the next decades, and described as a sort of distinct town, or district calculated for the reception of the darkest and most dangerous enemies to society; in which when pursued for the commission of crimes they easily conceal themselves and readily escape. A literary example can be interpreted as a sort of confirmation of the reputation of this lane, since Charles Dickens placed here Fagin's den, an old Jewish man earning a living as a fence, in his 1837 novel Oliver Twist. This peculiar homosexual meeting place, however, became well known to the public during the 1720s through the trial of its keeper, Margaret Clap, indicted for keeping a disorderly house and for encouraging her customers to commit sodomy; and, particularly, through the account given by an agent provocateur, Samuel Stevens.|$|E

2500|$|The chancel, {{which is}} deep and quite high, {{is covered by}} a false barrel vault with six carved coffers, forming a rosetta, while the side walls are covered by {{woodwork}} and azulejos depicting two scenes: the [...] "Transportation of the <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> <b>grapes</b> from the Promised Land" [...] (Gospel) and [...] "fall of Manna and harvesting by Moses" [...] (Epistle); these scenes are separated by two doors. The altar, surmounted by a concave vault, [...] is defined by four twisted columns decorated by acanthus, and in the center, a perfect round podium adorned with carved acanthus. [...] The set is topped by bulbous canopy, that allows the hanging of drapery between the proscenium arch, supported by angels and cherubs. Along the lateral axes of the tabernacle are awnings and drapes in semi-circular pediments, adorned with acanthus and feathers. Laterally, along the church, are corridors united at the chancel. The vestry walls are covered by azulejos.|$|E

2500|$|The gold belt-buckle is {{an unusual}} find, {{and would have been}} worn by a man; we know that belts {{decorated}} in various forms were important symbols of office or status in late Roman times, though few elements of them have survived. [...] Its decoration, of a satyr carrying a pedum (shepherd's crook) and a <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> <b>grapes,</b> accords with other hints at Bacchic imagery throughout the assemblage, in both the jewellery and the tableware. For example, the running feline animal on spoon (cochlear) no.66, originally identified as a panther or leopard, and referred to as the 'panther spoon', is certainly a reference to Bacchus, who was regularly accompanied by a panther or leopard (Panthera pardus), or by a tiger (Panthera tigris). [...] In fact, the animal on Thetford spoon no.66 is probably a tiger: [...] the rendering of the stripes as very short curved lines, easily mistaken for spots, was common in Roman art.|$|E
2500|$|In 1972, Trevor Nunn {{directed}} an RSC {{production at}} the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, {{as part of a}} presentation of the four Roman plays, starring Colin Blakely as Titus, Margaret Tyzack as Tamora, Calvin Lockhart as Aaron and Janet Suzman as Lavinia. Colin Blakely and John Wood as a vicious and maniacal Saturninus received particularly positive reviews. This production took the realistic approach and did not shirk from the more specific aspects of the violence; for example, Lavinia has trouble walking after the rape, which, it is implied, was anal rape. Nunn believed the play asked profound questions about the sustainability of Elizabethan society, and as such, he linked the play to the contemporary period to ask the same questions of late twentieth-century England; he was [...] "less concerned with the condition of ancient Rome than with the morality of contemporary life." [...] In his program notes, Nunn famously wrote [...] "Shakespeare's Elizabethan nightmare has become ours." [...] He was especially interested in the theory that decadence had led to the collapse of Rome. At the end of 4.2, for example, there was an on-stage orgy, and throughout the play, supporting actors appeared in the backgrounds dancing, eating, drinking and behaving outrageously. Also in this vein, the play opened with a group of people paying homage to a waxwork of an obese emperor reclining on a couch and clutching a <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> <b>grapes.</b>|$|E
