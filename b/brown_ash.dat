40|$|The {{present study}} evaluates {{potential}} re-use options for {{two different types}} of <b>brown</b> coal fly <b>ash</b> (class C) sourced from Australia as feedstock for geopolymer binder systems. The study covers analysis of fundamental material and mix-design requirements for geopolymer binders as a basis to achieve durable <b>brown</b> coal <b>ash</b> geopolymer matrices. The study established that reference unblended 100 % <b>brown</b> coal <b>ash</b> geopolymer mortar samples yielded low strength, typically below 5 MPa and poor durability. However, appropriate blends of <b>brown</b> coal <b>ash</b> with selected black coal fly ash (class F) and blast furnace slag to achieve target Si/Al ratios significantly enhanced both setting characteristics, as well as early age compressive strength development (25 - 35 MPa) while improving overall durability performance compared to reference mixes. Moreover, lagoon fly ash blended geopolymer shows better durability while dry precipitator fails to perform well. The discussion also focuses on key source material parameters and reaction processes that influence compressive strength and durability behaviour of marginal <b>brown</b> coal <b>ash</b> sources during geopolymerisation reactions...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} evaluates the {{potential}} re-use options for {{a suite of}} low rank <b>brown</b> coal fly <b>ashes</b> (ASTM class C fly ash) as feedstock for geopolymer binder synthesis. Ash suitability was evaluated using a number of conventional characterisation tools including XRF, calorimetric and microscopy to analyse solid phase distribution in relation to compositional differences derived from ternary diagram analogues. Blends of <b>brown</b> coal <b>ash</b> with selected black coal fly ash (class F) and blast furnace slag were developed for compressive strength and durability tests. The study show that <b>brown</b> coal fly <b>ash</b> with higher Al content improved the rate of reaction of blended binders and that observed high contents of sulphate and magnesium oxides available in some <b>brown</b> coal fly <b>ashes</b> induced accelerated decomposition in high moist environments. Overall, it was evident from both microscopy and mineralogical analysis of binder mixtures that <b>brown</b> coal fly <b>ash</b> participate in geopolymer network formation rather than act as filler material. Factors influencing <b>brown</b> coal <b>ash</b> reactivity {{and the potential for}} incorporating this class of ash in developing stable and usable geopolymer binder systems are discussed...|$|R

30|$|Both {{the black}} and <b>brown</b> <b>ashes</b> do not show a reddish color, {{suggesting}} limited oxidation conditions. This may be because, in the vent area, the entrainment of atmospheric air is low. Even if once the ash is exposed to the atmospheric environment, the timescale must be too short to cause oxidation. In addition, the high temperature in the vent area can obliterate the record {{of exposure to the}} atmospheric environment. At a high temperature, the ash changes its texture and color (D’Oriano et al. 2013, 2014). This must be a mechanism for generating the black ash (Toma et al. 2017).|$|R

30|$|We thus infer the {{sequence}} of an eruption as follows. There exists high-porosity magma foam in the conduit. Cooling of the uppermost part of the foam causes fracturing of the magma foam, which creates the glassy <b>brown</b> <b>ash.</b> Some part of the <b>brown</b> <b>ash</b> erupts, and some may fall back into the conduit. If the recycled <b>brown</b> <b>ash</b> remains {{at the top of}} the high-temperature foam for long time, it is altered to black ash. The ash particles are initially mobile, and the ash layer has a large permeability. Ultimately, the bottom of the ash layer sinters, and its permeability is reduced. The underlying foam layer is pressurized and ash eruption occurs. Once the debris layer {{at the top of the}} magma foam is removed, the underlying magma foam erupts as scoriae.|$|E

40|$|The use of {{industrial}} by-products to totally substitute Ordinary Portland cement (OPC) {{has become a}} major research area of late due to the environmental impact caused the production of CO 2 in the manufacture of cement. The use {{of industrial}} by-products as partial replacements for OPC is well established, with Class F Fly Ash and Ground Granulated Blastfurnace Slag being the most widely used. Recent research has also shown that concrete with similar strengths to both OP and blended cements can be achieved using Class F Fly Ash as a 100 % replacement material with a suitable alkali activator. This material is known as geoploymer concrete. However, much of the Fly Ash produced in Australia is <b>Brown</b> Coal Fly <b>Ash</b> (Class C), which cannot be used as a replacement material for OPC due to the chemical composition adversely affecting the properties of the concrete produced. The reaction to form geopolymer concrete is different to that when the Fly Ash is used as a partial replacement material. As such the possibility exists to use <b>Brown</b> Coal Fly <b>Ash</b> to make geopolymer concrete. This paper reports on a research project investigating the development of Victoria <b>Brown</b> Coal Fly <b>Ash</b> for geopolymer concrete and the properties of the material produced...|$|R

Granulated powders were pressed and pellets were sintered at 700 – 1400 C range. Phase-formation behavior, densification characteristics, and mechanical strength of ceramics were investigated and correlated with micro-structural features. Ceramics made of SG showed the highest density and mechanical strength among all. All the ceramics were initially amorphous and transformed into crystalline silica above a specific sintering temperature. Microstructure shows the formation of cracks in the ceramics when they contain cristobalite phases. Amorphous-to-crystalline phase transformation temperature in different types of silica source was dependent {{on the amount of}} impurity and residual hydroxyl group content...|$|E

40|$|International audiencePiton de la Fournaise (La Réunion Island) {{is a very}} active, {{primarily}} effusive ocean-island volcano. The Bellecombe Tephra represents {{at least}} three explosive eruptions that occurred between about 5465 and 2971 calendar years BP. Near {{the margin of the}} present-day Enclos Fouqué caldera margin, two Bellecombe eruptions produced a sequence of two tuff breccias interbedded with tuff. The tuff breccias only reach a few hundred meters outside the current caldera margin. At Petite Carrière, an old scoria cone ~ 1 km from the Enclos Fouqué margin, these two deposits (the Blower Bellecombe Tephra^) are represented by two tuffs with incipient soil formation at the top of each. They are overlain by a third unit (the upper Bellecombe Tephra) made of bedded lapilli tuff and tuff, some reworked in small debris flows off the scoria cone. The lapilli increase in size and the beds in thickness southeastward, toward Chisny volcano and away from the Enclos Fouqué caldera. Deposits from the upper Bellecombe tephra are correlated to sites 5 km northwest of Petite Carrière and 6 km north of a postulated vent location {{on the north side of}} Chisny volcano. Distribution patterns of all Bellecombe tephra are consistent with eruption columns that did not rise above 8 km asl. The ash fraction of the Bellecombe Tephra contains three juvenile components: a dominant gray vitric basaltic ash, an oceanitic (olivine-rich basalt) ash, and pyroxene-bearing gabbro with a few percent glass. It also contains doubly terminated clear quartz grains, and olivine and rarer clinopyroxene crystals. The lower Bellecombe Tephra contains an altered <b>brown</b> <b>ash,</b> whereas a tan-yellow clay-rich ash is common in the upper unit. Lava flows of gray aphyric basalt and oceanite are exposed at the surface and preceded the Bellecombe eruptions, but the gab-bro, quartz crystals, and hydrothermally altered grains indicate the involvement of the magma/hydrothermal system from 0. 5 -to 2 -km depth. We propose that the three eruptions of the Bellecombe tephra were preceded by voluminous eruptions of lava flows that led to seaward-sliding mass movement of the volcano. This opened fractures that explosively depressurized the hydrothermal system and incorporated magma and gabbro, from the magma system and probably from rock along the fissure, in the ejecta. This model is consistent with the small erupted volume (150 Mm 3 for the lower two combined and about the same for the upper tephra) and presence of components from a variety of depths. If the eruption had excavated downward, more surficial components would be expected. Instead, the fissures allowed material from many depths to erupt simultaneously. Similar eruptions may occur after voluminous eruptions and/or when lateral seaward sliding of the volcano occurs...|$|E
