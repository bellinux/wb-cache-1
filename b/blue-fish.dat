6000|$|The {{ocean is}} but a larger lake. At midsummer you may {{sometimes}} see a strip of glassy smoothness on it, a few rods in width and many miles long, as if the surface there were covered with a thin pellicle of oil, just as on a country pond; a sort of stand-still, you would say, at the meeting or parting of two currents of air (if it does not rather mark the unrippled steadiness of a current of water beneath), for sailors tell {{of the ocean and}} land breeze meeting between the fore and aft sails of a vessel, while the latter are full, the former being suddenly taken aback. Daniel Webster, in one of his letters describing blue-fishing off Martha's Vineyard, referring to those smooth places, which fishermen and sailors call [...] "slicks," [...] says: [...] "We met with them yesterday, and our boatman made for them, whenever discovered. He said they were caused by the <b>blue-fish</b> chopping up their prey. That is to say, those voracious fellows get into a school of menhaden, which are too large to swallow whole, and they bite them into pieces to suit their tastes. And the oil from this butchery, rising to the surface, makes the 'slick.'" ...|$|E

I've been to No Man's Land many a time <b>blue-fishing</b> with him; must ask after him," [...] said an elderly gentleman who was pacing {{to and fro}} yearning for the morning papers.|$|R
60|$|One day, when {{tired of}} {{struggling}} with gamy <b>blue-fish</b> and powerful cavalios (if {{that is the}} way to spell it), I wound up my line, and looked about to see what the others were doing. The Paying Teller stood near, on tiptoe, as usual, with his legs wide apart, his hat thrown back, his eyes flashing over the water, and his right arm stretched far out, ready for a jerk. Quee was farther along the beach. He had just landed a fish, and was standing gazing meditatively upon it as it lay upon the sand. The hook was still in its mouth, {{and every now and then}} he would give the line a little pull, as if to see if there really was a connection between it and the fish. Then he would stand a little longer, and meditate a little more, still looking alternately at the line and the fish. Having made up his mind, at last, that the two things must be separated, he kneeled down upon his flopping prize and proceeded meditatively to extract the hook. The teacher was struggling at her line. Hand over hand she pulled it in. As it came nearer and nearer, her fish swam wildly from side to side, making the tightened line fairly hiss as it swept through the water. But still she pulled and pulled, until, red and breathless, she landed her prize upon the sand.|$|E

50|$|Almost without exception, blue-backed {{fish are}} salt water fish that travel in schools {{close to the}} surface of the water, have wide migratory {{patterns}} and are relatively low on the food chain so feed on plankton, etc. Their appearance, as is indicated by their name, is a dark blue dorsal with a nearly white under belly. Further, <b>blue-fish</b> are generally fairly small in size and caught in large quantities resulting in low market price, so are thought of as mass-market fish for general consumption and are distinguished from larger, specialty fish caught in smaller quantities, even if they share other qualities.|$|E
40|$|Know how {{consumer}} chooses and perceives different seafood in {{the market}} is a fundamental information to develop appropriate marketing strategies and, in case, to draw plans in favour of fisheries operators. This work is aimed at revealing consumer perception of some attributes related to a particular fish group called "blue-fish". Survey’s target has been chosen observing some critical commercial issues related to this products, which is affordable and has a good nutritional and dietetic value, {{but it does not}} gain the expected market success. Contemporaneously, the <b>blue-fish</b> is the first group of seafood caught in Mediterranean Sea, representing {{one of the most important}} economic resource for Italian fishery sector and an element of territorial distinction. Especially, the research evaluates how consumers perceives the different <b>blue-fish</b> products and their competitors in the fish market, investigating both positive and negative nutritional, commercial and sensorial attributes. Through the correspondence analysis, it has been possible to create a perceptual map synthesizing the complexity of qualitative factors that explain the purchase/not purchase event of the different type of <b>blue-fish</b> products and to compare them with their main competitors. The choice of this analysis is due to the lack of information in the literature about conditions and motivations of <b>blue-fish</b> consumers/nonconsumers, so, the research has mostly explorative purposes and it may offer useful information for further studies. ...|$|E

40|$|Non Technical Summary A 1 -page {{summary in}} layman’s language. Co. Pro. Mar S. R. L. of Bisceglie (Bari) have been {{established}} since 1991 and has 1 marine site with an output of approximately 600 tonnes per annum and provides employment for 15 full time staff (4 professional scuba divers). Bisceglie fish farm is situated on open sea 3, 200 meters North-East of Bisceglie harbor (Puglia, Italy), 1, 700 meters from the nearest coast (Fig. 1). The area is not sheltered and the sea bottom is flat and predominantly composed of mixed sand-mud. Water depths range from 20 to 28 meters. Salinity is 36 - 38 PSU. Near the fish farm are not present protected areas. The Bisceglie site is a marine eurytherm fish farm, mainly European seabass Dicentrarchus labrax, L.) and seabream (Sparus aurata, L.) and has a total of 24 cages with a diameter of 15 m and an height of 7 or 10 m, depending on the reared biomass, and a consequent capacity of 1750 or 1250 m 3. The feed, certified and coming from sustainable sources, is given by hand. The Bisceglie city has about 51, 000 inhabitants. During summer it is a tourist place even if the beaches are few and mainly artificial (stones, cobblestones). The port has an important fishing fleet specialized in <b>blue-fish</b> (anchovies, European pilchard, mackerels…). The surrounding land use i...|$|E
40|$|Young-of-year (YOY) <b>blue-fish</b> (Pomatomus saltatrix) {{along the}} U. S. east coast are often assumed to use {{estuaries}} almost exclusively during the summer. Here we present data from 1995 to 1998 indicating that YOY (30 – 260 mm FL) also use ocean habitats {{along the coast}} of New Jersey. An analysis of historical and recent data on northern and southern ocean beaches (0. 1 – 2 m) and the inner continental shelf (5 – 27 m) during extensive sampling in New Jersey waters from 1995 to 1998 indicated that multiple cohorts occurred (June–August) in every year. When comparable collections of YOY were made in the ocean and in an adjacent estuary, the abundance was 1 – 2 orders of magnitude greater on ocean beaches during the summer. The YOY were even more abundant in ocean habitats in the fall (September–October), presumably as a result of YOY leaving estuaries to join the coastal migration south. During 1999 and 2000, YOY bluefish were tagged with internal sequential coded wire microtags in order to refine our under-standing of habitat use and movement. Few (0. 04 %) of the fish tagged on ocean beaches were recaptured; however, 2. 2 % of the fish tagged in the estuary were recaptured from 2 to 27 days after tagging. Recaptured fish grew quickly (average 1. 37 mm FL/d). On ocean beaches YOY fed on a variety of invertebrates and fishes but their diet changed with size. By approximately 80 – 100 mm FL, they were piscivorous and fed primarily on engraulids, a pattern similar to that reported in estuaries. Based on distribution, abundance, and feeding, both spring- and summer-spawned cohorts of YOY bluefish commonly use ocean habitats. Therefore, attempts to determine factors affecting recruitment success based solely on estuarine sampling may be inadequate and further examination, especially of the contribution of the summer-spawned cohort in ocean habitats, appears warranted...|$|E
