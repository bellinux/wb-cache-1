25|$|Coelacanths are {{opportunistic}} feeders, hunting cuttlefish, squid, snipe eels, small sharks, {{and other}} fish {{found in their}} deep reef and volcanic slope habitats. Coelacanths are also known to swim head down, backwards or <b>belly</b> <b>up</b> to locate their prey, presumably using their rostral glands. Scientists suspect one reason this fish has been so successful is that specimens are able to slow down their metabolisms at will, sinking into the less-inhabited depths and minimizing their nutritional requirements {{in a sort of}} hibernation mode.|$|E
25|$|The band {{performed}} at a fundraiser event at The <b>Belly</b> <b>Up</b> Tavern in Solana Beach on September 27, 2015. The set featured {{a mixture of}} songs from the band's more recent albums and older songs {{that have not been}} performed in over 15 years. The band previously {{performed at}} the 600 capacity venue in 1986. The Fundraiser was in support of the nonprofit San Diego Foundation and tickets for the 21 and over show cost $1,000 of which $750 is tax deductible).

25|$|Coelacanth {{locomotion}} is unique. To {{move around}} they most commonly {{take advantage of}} up- or down-wellings of current and drift. Their paired fins stabilize movement through the water. While on the ocean floor, they do not use the paired fins {{for any kind of}} movement. Coelacanths create thrust with their caudal fins for quick starts. Due to the abundance of its fins, the coelacanth has high maneuverability and can orient its body in almost any direction in the water. They have been seen doing headstands as well as swimming <b>belly</b> <b>up.</b> It is thought that the rostral organ helps give the coelacanth electroperception, which aids in movement around obstacles.|$|E
500|$|In 2010, {{the team}} also played in bouts in Wollongong, Sydney and Melbourne. The October 2010 match in Sydney against the SydneyCity Assassins {{featured}} a Star Wars theme.

50|$|Teddy Stanzo {{suffers from}} a rare {{disorder}} called mercantilism. This disorder causes him to think that feeding the good dog, and <b>bellying</b> <b>up</b> to the educational trough, are alllllright. Ted Constanzo was a star quarterback at Churchill High School in San Antonio. He quarterbacked his team for two years, earning player-of-the-week, all-district and, in 1974, all state honors. He was also the team's punter. He played in the 1974 Texas High School Coaches Association All-Star game and won the Thom McAn award as the city's outstanding high school football player. He had a strong arm and was a blue-chip college recruit for his passing. Constanzo was an all-around athlete, {{who was also a}} star of the track and field team where he competed in, among other things, the pole vault, and he lettered in both baseball and basketball.|$|R
2500|$|In 1973 all was {{not well}} for Haffkine and Dr. Hook & The Medicine Show, David left the band in and was {{replaced}} by John Wolters. The group had a difficult time meeting the high expectations created by Sloppy Seconds, and the result was <b>Belly</b> <b>Up,</b> which Huey noted [...] "was unfortunately prophetic." [...] "Belly Up" [...] included Acapulco Goldie, Penicillin Penny, Life Ain't Easy, When Lily Was Queen, Monterey, Jack, You Ain't Got The Right, Put A Little Bit On Me, Ballad Of...., Roland The Roadie Gertrude The Groupie, Come On In, The Wonderful Soup Stone. The album was sold in the US, UK, Europe and Canada. Dr. Hook was just as famed for their crazed stage antics, which ranged from surreal banter to impersonating their own opening acts, but it was the group's nonchalance about business matters that led to bankruptcy."If we were in the black when we finished a tour, we'd party into the red," [...] says Locorriere. They were forced to file bankruptcy in 1974, although they continued to tour incessantly.|$|E
2500|$|John {{traveled}} to Encintas, California after high school, {{where he spent}} two years with his brother Jim and began his music career in a band called Vitamin. John Butler's first gig was 9 September 1994 at the Metaphor Cafe in Escondido, California. There Vitamin was written up and reviewed in [...] "Go" [...] magazine they performed all around the San Diego area and played one show in Houston, Texas opening for Dive, who later became Osmant between in 1995. Vitamin recorded two tracks, [...] "Deadhorse" [...] and [...] "Mary Jane" [...] in the <b>Belly</b> <b>Up</b> Studios in Solana Beach, California in 1994. Vitamin bandmate Ozzie Rea fronted Perth funk band, Proton. The two {{can be found on}} The Live at Mojo's CD and performed together on New Years Ever Y2K. [...] John Butler was a busker on the streets of Fremantle playing his own compositions. In mid-1996, he released a self-recorded cassette of his instrumentals, Searching for Heritage, which sold 3,000 copies. He played different styles of music including [...] "Indian, Celtic, bluegrass and folk". Butler had his first paid performance in 1997 at the Seaview Hotel in Fremantle. In 1998, North Fremantle, Mojos club owner, Phil Stevens, hired Butler as a regular performer. Stevens became his manager and later his business partner.|$|E
60|$|All at {{once the}} struggles ceased. The great carcass rolled over <b>belly</b> <b>up,</b> and lay {{extended}} on the sea in death. To me {{it seemed as if}} a dead calm had suddenly fallen around us, after a long and furious storm, so great was the change when that whale at length parted with its huge life. The silence was suddenly broken by three hearty cheers, and then, fastening a rope to our prize, we commenced towing it to the ship, which operation occupied us the greater part of the night, for we had no fewer than eight miles to pull.|$|E
2500|$|A [...] {{was later}} built in Aspen itself, the {{beginnings}} of today's ski resort. The outbreak of World War II put further skiing development on hold, but not skiing itself as the U.S. Army's Tenth Mountain Division's [...] "soldiers on skis" [...] began training at nearby Camp Hale. After one long cross-country skiing exercise over the mountains the soldiers went, still on skis, straight to the Jerome where Laurence Elisha, then the owner, let them spend the night and offered them free drinks. Many were struck by the vintage decor. [...] "The only thing missing {{was a bunch of}} trail-worn cowboys or dirt-stained miners <b>bellied</b> <b>up</b> to the bar", one observed. Throughout their training, Elisha offered them a room and a steak dinner for a dollar a night. It became a popular for the Tenth's trainees [...] on weekend leave, since Leadville was off-limits and Denver was a lot farther away.|$|R
5000|$|O’Donovan {{also writes}} in his O.S. Letters of 1835- [...] "The {{original}} site {{of the church is}} still occupied by the Protestant one, and there is a holy well not far from it called Tobar Nuadhain, which {{is said to have been}} blessed by a monastic old gentleman of the name of Noone (a surname numerous in this country of Moylurg) but at what period no one remembers. This well is fast losing its sanctity and is now but seldom resorted to for cure. When it was in vogue it was visited by great numbers, and when the patient was not to recover from his malady, when he came to drink of its water, the blessed trouts of the well turned their <b>bellies</b> <b>up,</b> and seemed to be sickish and languid, but when he was to recover through the blessed waters of the well, they looked healthy and swam about briskly". The cave beside the well was where Nuadu lived as an anchorite and is marked as [...] "Issertnowe" [...] on the Ordnance Survey maps of the townland.|$|R
60|$|The Abbot, hastily ridding {{himself of}} the false nose which mystified his physiognomy, and the {{supplementary}} <b>belly</b> which made <b>up</b> his disguise, stood before his master in his real character, of Adam Woodcock, the falconer of Avenel.|$|R
60|$|The man who {{was most}} {{affected}} by his death was the captain; but we were not prepared for the great change that soon appeared in his manner and conduct. After a time he laughed {{with the rest of}} us at a good joke, and cheered as loud as the best when a big fish turned <b>belly</b> <b>up,</b> but his behaviour to us became more gentle and kind, and he entirely gave up the habit of swearing. He also forbade working on Sunday. Many a whale have I seen sporting and spouting near us on that day, but never did we lower a boat or touch a harpoon on Sunday. Some of the men grumbled at this, and complained of it to each other, but they never spoke so as to let the captain hear, and they soon gave up their grumbling, for the most of us were well pleased with the change, and all of us had agreed to it.|$|E
60|$|When the {{fishermen}} hove into sight, and their eager pipings came faintly up the lake ahead of them, I paddled hastily out and turned loose a half-dozen chub {{in the shallow}} water. I had kept them alive {{as long as possible}} in a big pail, and they still had life enough to fin about near the surface. When {{the fishermen}} arrived I was sitting among the rocks as usual, and turned to acknowledge the mother bird's Ch'wee? But my deep-laid scheme to find out their method accomplished nothing; except, perhaps, to spoil the day's lesson. They saw my bait on the instant. One of the youngsters dove headlong without poising, went under, missed his fish, rose, plunged again. He got him that time and went away sputtering. The second took his time, came down on a long swift slant, and got his fish without going under. Almost before the lesson began it was over. The mother circled about for a few moments in a puzzled sort of way, watching the young fishermen flapping up the slope to their nest. Something was wrong. She had fished enough to know that success means something more than good luck; and this morning success had come too easily. She wheeled slowly over the shallows, noting the fish there, where they plainly did not belong, and dropping to examine with suspicion one big chub that was floating, <b>belly</b> <b>up,</b> on the water. Then she went under with a rush, where I could not see, came out again with a fish for herself, and followed her little ones to the nest.|$|E

5000|$|Clyburn {{was officially}} neutral during the primary battle between Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, however former President Bill Clinton blamed Clyburn for Hillary's 29-point {{defeat in the}} South Carolina primary {{and the two of}} them had a heated {{telephone}} conversation. Clyburn himself had voted for Obama, saying [...] "How could I ever look in the faces of our children and grandchildren had I not voted for Barack Obama?" [...] Clyburn negatively viewed Bill Clinton's remarks regarding Barack Obama winning the South Carolina primary. Clinton had compared Obama's victory to Rev. Jesse Jackson's win in the 1988 primary election."Black people are incensed all over this," [...] said Clyburn. Clinton responded that the campaign [...] "played the race card on me," [...] denying any racial tone in the comment. [...] Speaking with the New York Times, Clyburn said such actions could lead to a longtime division between the former president and his once most reliable constituency."When he was going through his impeachment problems, it was the black community that <b>bellied</b> <b>up</b> to the bar," [...] Clyburn said. [...] "I think black folks feel strongly that this is a strange way for President Clinton to show his appreciation." ...|$|R

50|$|People {{who wish}} to look pregnant, {{generally}} for social, sexual, entertainment, or psychological purposes, {{have the option of}} body suits and the like to wear under their clothes. It can be done by using pillows or pads, or light-weighing, small balls with a round shape to simulate a pregnant abdomen. A common practice is to place a form replicating a <b>belly</b> (rolled <b>up</b> clothes, deflated ball, etc) under a skin colored, tight bodysuit. This creates a realistic color and shape.|$|R

The sprawl is a forward movement with the belly making contact with the ground and is used to transition to [...] "high walk" [...] or to slither over wet substrate into water. The high walk is an up on four limbs forward motion used for overland travel with the <b>belly</b> well <b>up</b> from the ground.

40|$|There’s an old library {{story about}} oranges and peaches that goes like this: a guy <b>bellies</b> <b>up</b> to the {{reference}} desk {{looking for the}} book, The Oranges and Peaches. He’s in a hurry. The librarian searches the catalog—fruitlessly—for the title. The man is incredulous. “I have to read it by Monday! It’s a classic!” The librarian asks if he knows the author. He’s indignant. “Charles-something-orother!” With that, {{she goes to the}} shelves and plucks off Darwin’s On the Origins of Species. “Yep, that’s it,” he says, “now, do you have the movie?” It is the happy job of the reference librarian to assist researchers in making reference to the whole of recorded knowledge, in the myriad formats by which it is presented. In the library, communication accidents of the oranges and peaches variety happen all the time; but in the digital domain, the human ability to repair such accidents by means of adaptation is supplanted by prescriptive language and pre-programmed approximations. In innumerable ways, the Internet environment is a major evolutionary development. The World Wide Web, in branching patterns of common descent, has given way to a kind of mechanical consciousness to which researchers—of all ages, abilities, and proclivities—are apt to become either unwittingly submissive or utterly defiant. This essay will provide a framework for effective research in honors {{in and out of the}} library, with tips and tricks along the way. It will introduce the common characteristics of knowledge organization systems; highlight the library resources that feature honors scholarship and open-source repositories that aggregate scholarly material; introduce a toolbox for accessing the NCHC e-sources that allow for collaboration and exchange; and briefly discuss changes in the fair use covenant for teaching and scholarship that the millennial age brings...|$|R
