5|$|Although {{the filmmakers}} put {{considerable}} effort into historical accuracy, particularly in details, {{the film is}} known for some key distortions of history. An entirely fictional sequence was added in which Truman agonizes over whether to authorize the attack; anti-aircraft shells are shown bursting around the Enola Gay on its <b>bombing</b> <b>run</b> over Hiroshima; and {{it is said that}} leaflets were dropped on Hiroshima for ten days in advance of the mission warning the citizens of the forthcoming raid. The film received generally mixed reviews, and was a box office disappointment.|$|E
5|$|In 1965, Jabara {{was given}} {{command of the}} 31st Tactical Fighter Wing at Homestead Air Force Base, Florida. By 1966 Jabara had risen {{to the rank of}} colonel—the {{youngest}} at that rank at the time, and he volunteered to fly combat missions for the Vietnam War. He flew his first mission in July 1966, joining a F-100 Super Sabre flight group for a <b>bombing</b> <b>run</b> that damaged several buildings held by the Viet Cong in South Vietnam. He returned on leave to Homestead about a week after the mission.|$|E
5|$|Loring AFB {{was named}} in 1954 for Major Charles J. Loring, Jr., USAF, a Medal of Honor {{recipient}} during the Korean War. During {{the morning of}} 22 November 1952, he led a flight of F-80 Shooting Stars on patrol over Kunwha. After beginning a dive <b>bombing</b> <b>run</b> and getting hit, he entered into a controlled dive and destroyed a Chinese gun emplacement on Sniper Ridge that was harassing United Nations troops. Limestone Air Force Base was renamed in his honor.|$|E

5|$|The {{attack was}} universally {{condemned}} by Australian servicemen, who commonly {{believed that the}} attack on Centaur had been carried out deliberately and in full knowledge of her status. Similar reactions were expressed by other Allied personnel; United States Army Air Forces General George Kenney recalled having to talk a sergeant bombardier out of organising a retaliatory <b>bombing</b> <b>run</b> on a Japanese hospital ship known {{to be in their}} area.|$|E
5|$|The game {{features}} a changing weather system, which will vary from every hour and will provide obstructions for various forces and installations. For example, fog will close runways whereas storms will temporarily disrupt bombing runs and dogfights. Over time, RAF squadrons {{will run out}} of ammunition or fuel, and thus must replenish at the nearest RAF station, which will render them vulnerable to a Luftwaffe <b>bombing</b> <b>run.</b> In between turns, the player {{has the opportunity to}} request reinforcements from RAF reserves, however the longer the campaign progresses, the quality of the reserves will diminish.|$|E
5|$|Armstrong {{first saw}} {{action in the}} Korean War on August 29, 1951, as an escort for a photo {{reconnaissance}} plane over Songjin. Five days later on September 3, he flew armed reconnaissance over the primary transportation and storage facilities south of the village of Majon-ni, west of Wonsan. While making a low <b>bombing</b> <b>run</b> at about , Armstrong's F9F Panther was hit by anti-aircraft fire. While trying to regain control, he collided with a pole at a height of about , which sliced off about three feet (1 m) of the Panther's right wing. Armstrong flew the plane back to friendly territory, but due {{to the loss of}} the aileron, ejection was his only safe option. He planned to eject over water and await rescue by Navy helicopters, and therefore flew to an airfield near Pohang, but his ejection seat was blown back over land. A jeep driven by a roommate from flight school picked Armstrong up; it is unknown what happened to the wreckage of No. 125122 F9F-2.|$|E

5|$|Beginning {{with the}} July 5 Battle of Osan, US troops began a {{continuous}} and unsuccessful ground {{campaign against the}} North Koreans, {{and many of the}} US air assets were used in close air support and airstrike roles to aid the faltering ground troops. From this point on bombers mounted strategic bombing missions against military targets of all types supporting the North Korean ground troops, including ports, armor concentrations and supply stockpiles. A massive interdiction campaign ensued which would have implications for the upcoming conflicts. As more US Air Force, US Navy and US Marine Corps aviation assets arrived in the country, they increased their interdiction campaigns for several days striking bridges and strategic areas though going mostly unthreatened by the North Korean Air Force, though at least one F-80 was lost when it hit power lines during a <b>bombing</b> <b>run.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{landings}} were overwhelmingly successful. On Delta and Alpha beaches, German {{resistance was}} low. The Osttruppen surrendered quickly, {{and the biggest}} threat to the Allies were the mines. A single German gun as well as a mortar position were silenced by destroyer fire. The Allied units in this sector were able to secure a bridgehead and quickly linked up with the paratroopers, capturing Saint-Tropez as well LeMuy. The most serious fighting was on Camel Beach near the town of Saint-Raphaël. This beach was secured by several well-emplaced coastal guns as well as flak batteries. Through heavy German fire the Allies attempted to land at the shore. However, at sector Red of the Camel Beach landing zone the Allies were not able to succeed. A <b>bombing</b> <b>run</b> of 90Allied B-24 bombers was called in against a German strongpoint here. Even with the assistance of naval fire, the Allies were not able to bring the landing ships close to the shore. They decided to avoid Camel Red and land only at the sectors of Camel Blue and Camel Green, which was successful.|$|E
5|$|Late in {{the morning}} of November 22, 1952, Loring led a flight of four F-80s on patrol over Kunwha. Upon radioing a forward air controller, he was told a T-6 Texan flying over Sniper Ridge had spotted a {{concentration}} of artillery near the ridge which was pinning down UN ground troops on the ridge. He was also told the artillery concentration was surrounded by a heavy presence of anti-aircraft guns. Loring ordered the flight to the location, spotting the artillery concentration. Immediately after Loring began his dive <b>bombing</b> <b>run,</b> he was spotted by the anti-aircraft batteries. The Chinese crews operating them were highly skilled, and even at a distance, the batteries fired an extremely accurate barrage which struck Loring's aircraft several times on the nose and fuselage. The fire disabled the aircraft. His wingmen, noting the damage, suggested he abort the bombing mission, as the flight was not far behind the lines and Loring's aircraft could have attempted the return trip. Instead, Loring ceased radio contact, and resumed {{what appeared to be the}} standard bombing mission. At , however, Loring accelerated his aircraft at a 40-degree angle in what appeared to be a controlled maneuver, lining up the Chinese batteries. The other pilots reported they watched, stunned, as Loring dove his damaged aircraft into the battery position. Loring was killed instantly in the impact, but his action resulted in the complete destruction of the battery position.|$|E

25|$|On March 10, 1967, the sky {{was clear}} for a <b>bombing</b> <b>run,</b> but both F-4 Phantom IIs were hit by {{anti-aircraft}} fire. Aman's plane took the worst damage; his fuel tank had been hit, and he quickly lost most of his fuel. He {{did not have enough}} fuel to make it to a KC-135 tanker aircraft over Laos.|$|E
25|$|In the afternoon, the Germans {{breached}} {{the perimeter}} near the canal at Bulskamp but the boggy {{ground on the}} far side of the canal and sporadic fire from the Durham Light Infantry, halted them.

25|$|There {{is also a}} small lake, {{known as}} 'The Trap', which is stocked with coarse fish. A German Messerschmitt bomber crashed into the Trap during World War II, shot down by {{anti-aircraft}} fire after going off course following a <b>bombing</b> <b>run</b> over Liverpool. The land is primarily heavy clay soil. Etna Park, {{which is just a}} short walk from the town centre, is part of the Heritage Trail walk in the area.|$|E
25|$|The aerial {{fire-fighting}} operation {{consisted of}} two aircraft; the bird dog aircraft, a Rockwell Turbo Commander 690, and the tanker aircraft, Flight 448. The bird dog aircraft directed the tanker aircraft to {{the area where the}} fire retardant was to be released. On 31 July 2010 both of these aircraft took off from Kamloops Airport and proceeded to the wildfire. While making a <b>bombing</b> <b>run,</b> the tanker aircraft suddenly lost height and hit the trees, crashing into a ravine.|$|E
25|$|Burbridge {{also said}} that the {{collision}} occurred when the bomber group was returning to base after having dropped its bombs on target, so that the aircraft did not complete a <b>bombing</b> <b>run</b> after being damaged as had been incorrectly recounted.

25|$|Commissioned 1st Lieutenant on May 30, 1918, he was {{assigned}} to the American 148th Aero Squadron and reported for duty on the British front in France July 4, 1918. Curtis’ first attack on enemy targets was a <b>bombing</b> <b>run</b> over Croisilles, France, on August 22, 1918. From his open cockpit biplane, he dropped 4 bombs and fired 200 rounds at enemy targets. During the Second Battle of Bapaume, he undertook a similar mission over Bapaume, France, dropping 4 bombs and returning safely to base on August 23.|$|E
25|$|Price {{agrees to}} help Task Force 141 but insists that {{ending the war}} is his priority. After raiding a Russian port, Price {{launches}} a ballistic missile towards Washington, D.C. and detonates it in the upper atmosphere. The resulting EMP blast disables all electronic devices across the eastern seaboard, causing both factions to suffer but giving the Americans a much-needed advantage. Soldiers fighting in D.C. narrowly avoid a <b>bombing</b> <b>run</b> of Russian-occupied strategic structures by the United States Air Force, lighting green flares atop the White House {{to show that the}} city remains in American hands.|$|E
25|$|Based on the {{aircraft}} type, Syrian pilots use different attack techniques for unguided munitions. L-39s attack in a dive, fast jets usually attacked {{in a low}} to medium altitude <b>bombing</b> <b>run</b> at high speed, firing thermal decoy flares against IR homing missiles and zooming after the attack. Later, fast jets added rocket and gun diving attacks. Helicopters were seen flying at unusually high altitudes which minimized their accuracy and increased collateral damage, but reduced losses since {{they did not have}} the high speed and acceleration of jet fighters; the altitude putting them out of range of most of the ground threats. Mi-24/25 gunships were observed delivering decoy flares as well.|$|E
