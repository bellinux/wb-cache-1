50|$|<b>Boldo</b> oil {{should not}} be used {{internally}} or externally. Where <b>boldo</b> leaf is used, the total exposure to ascaridole should be considered from a safety standpoint.

The use of ethanolic extracts of <b>boldo</b> leaf is not considered acceptable for traditional herbal medicinal products in view of the potentially higher levels of the toxic ascaridole constituent.|$|E
