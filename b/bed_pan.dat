50|$|Several {{methods have}} been tested for their {{effectiveness}} at improving thorough intensive-care unit environmental hygiene. A study conducted in 2010 across 3532 high risk environmental surfaces in 260 intensive care unit rooms in 27 acute-care hospitals (ICUs) assessed the consistency at which these surfaces met base line cleaning standards. Only 49.5% of the high-risk object surfaces were found to meet this baseline criterion. The least-cleaned objects were bathroom light switches, room door knobs, and <b>bed</b> <b>pan</b> cleaners. Significant improvements in ICU room cleaning was achieved through a structured approach that incorporated a simple, highly objective surface targeting method and repeated performance feedback to environmental surface personnel. Specific methods included implementing an objective evaluation process, environmental surfaces staff education, programmatic feedback, and continuous training to minimize the spread of hospital-associated infections. The authors noted an improvement in the thoroughness of cleaning at 71% from baseline for the entire group of hospitals involved.|$|E

5000|$|Victor and Danny met {{in prison}} and hatched a plan to kidnap and demand ransom for {{the only child of}} a rich family. The film opens with scenes in which they make meticulous {{preparations}} to carry out the kidnap. They take their victim, Alice, her head hooded, to a soundproofed room. They cut off her clothing and tie her to a bed with a ball-gag buckled into her mouth. They force her to look at a camera as she is photographed naked. They then dress her in a tracksuit, put a hood on her head and leave her. They bag up both her clothes and theirs for disposal and Vic sends the pictures to her father as first step towards making the ransom demand. In continuing graphic scenes, they explain to Alice that she needs to sign when she needs the toilet and strip her lower half in order that she use a <b>bed</b> <b>pan</b> whilst still tied up. Neither shows any emotion during her humiliation but Vic, who is dominant, questions Danny's resolve now that the formerly 'hypothetical girl' has become real.|$|E
5000|$|Java makes {{appearance}} in the two-part Justice League episode [...] "Metamorphosis," [...] voiced by Richard Moll. Like the comics, Java serves as Stagg's assistant. After an unsuccessful presentation of his new [...] "Metamorpho" [...] project, Stagg ordered Java to transport valuable mutagen samples by train. He was told {{not to let the}} briefcase out of his sight, but one of the attendants checked it into the luggage compartment, citing regulations. One of the vials broke, damaging the carriage and causing it to derail until the train was stopped by Green Lantern. Stagg reprimanded Java for this failure, as it drew unwarranted attention to his operations. True enough, Stagg hadn't finished when Rex Mason inquired about Java's presence on the train. This and the fact that Mason was seeing Stagg's daughter Sapphire led him to test out the Metamorpho project on Mason. The morning after, Java accompanied Stagg to Mason's hospital room. After learning what had happened, Rex went mad, but Java could not stop him. He was knocked out with a <b>bed</b> <b>pan.</b> Following Mason's trail, Stagg was eager to get pictures of everything. He used it to pit Mason against his old friend John Stewart. After reviewing the success of his designs in battle, he sat back to consider the military applications. But Mason caught on to him and easily dispatched Java. Down but not out, Java reached for a canister of liquid nitrogen and froze him. Java oversaw Stagg's attempts to refine the Metamorpho mutagen when Metamorpho barged into the lab. This time, Mason went straight for the nitrogen. He knocked Java into a cabinet. In Mason's fight with Stagg, a giant synthetic creature was released, which destroyed half the laboratory. Java was able to get out before Green Lantern and Batman investigated the place.|$|E
50|$|Vic {{is the one}} {{who leaves}} the place where they are holding Alice in order to make {{preparations}} to obtain the ransom, whilst Danny is left guarding Alice. In his absence, Alice, signing that she needs to do a 'number two'. persuades Danny to untie her and turn his back. She attacks him with her <b>bed</b> <b>pan</b> and grabs his pistol, which she fires during the struggle between them, hitting the wall. Believing he is about to die, Danny reveals his identity to Alice. They were lovers before his time in jail and he says he met Vic while in jail and chose her as the kidnap victim with a view to getting money from the father she had told him she hated. He says his plan was to double cross Vic and to start a new life, sharing the money with Alice. They hear Vic returning and Danny points out that even if she were to shoot him she would not get past Vic. Alice agrees to play along with Danny's plan and lets him tie her back up. Later, while Vic is away again, Alice gets Danny to untie her and seduces him, managing to handcuff Danny to the bed. She tries to leave but finds the front door bolted from the inside and can't get out. She sees a mobile phone on the table and dials 999 but cannot tell the operator where she is. She then notices Danny's gun and decides to use it to get him to tell her where the keys to the front door are. Danny tells her they are in his trouser pocket, which is close enough to the bed for him to overpower her whilst she is attempting to retrieve them. He reties the unconscious Alice to the bed. Vic returns and says the exchange is on. Vic is left alone with Alice while Danny prepares the van. As Vic starts to get Alice ready for the trip, the mobile phone she managed to obtain falls out of her pocket onto the bed. Vic checks it and finds it shows a 999 call. Then he spots the bullet in the wall, ungags Alice and threatens her. She screams for Danny, proving she knows him. She then tells Vic that Danny intended to double cross him and that she had done a deal with Danny to play along as kidnap victim in exchange for a share of the money.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: The {{aim of this}} {{dissertation}} was {{to determine}} the in vivo loads acting in hip joints and lumbar vertebral bodies during post-operative physiotherapeutic activities. Three studies were conducted: The loading of a total hip endoprosthesis was investigated during physiotherapeutic exercises (study 1) and walking with crutches (study 2), and the loads on a vertebral body replacement (VBR) were measured during position changes (study 3). Methods: 12 patients with instrumented implants (7 xhip/ 5 xVBR, mean age 59 / 66 years, mean body mass 86 / 65 kg) were investigated. The implants measure in vivo the forces and moments in 3 planes. For study 1, 6 hip patients performed 13 physiotherapeutic exercises. The peak loads were compared to those during walking with full and half weight bearing. For study 2, 7 hip patients walked with crutches using 3 -point-, 4 -point, and 2 -point-gait, and were compared to gait without crutches as a reference. For study 3, changes in position (e. g. from supine position to sitting) of 5 patients with VBR were analyzed and compared to upright standing. The resultant force Fres was computed from the force components and averaged. For the hip measurements, the torque Mtors around the implant stem axis and the bending moment Mbend in the implant neck were additionally computed in percent of the patient’s bodyweight times meter (%BW*m). Results: Study 1 : Lifting the pelvis in supine position, supported by only one leg, caused forces and moments higher than during unaided walking. Isometric contractions can potentially cause a high Fres; however, the maximum values varied strongly between 56 - 232 % body weight (=BW), depending on the contraction intensity. Study 2 : The 3 -point-gait strategy reduced Fres most effectively. However, the effects varied among subjects. Study 3 : Changes in position without physiotherapeutic instructions caused 15 160 % higher loads than with instructions. The use of a trapeze bar did not cause higher peak loads. Hand support on thighs or arm rests during rising from and sitting down on a chair reduced Fres by approximately 25 %. Conclusions: After surgical interventions, the clinician has to decide whether the primary stability of the implant requires avoidance of high loads. If so, body weight exercises and maximum voluntary contractions should be removed from the rehabilitation protocol. However, some exercises, such as lifting the pelvis shown in study 1, are also necessary in daily living when e. g. using a <b>bed</b> <b>pan.</b> Furthermore, the patients should follow the instructions of physiotherapists when changing positions and walking with crutches. Walking with 3 -point-gait requires both coordination and strength and it is questionable if elderly or weak patients are capable to perform this properly. The surgeon should therefore relate the loads on hip joint and vertebral body to those during activities of daily living and should decide individually, if unloading of the implant is necessary and feasible...|$|E

40|$|Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) are infections {{related to}} {{receiving}} medical care. HAIs {{are responsible for}} an excess {{of morbidity and mortality}} among hospitalized patients. Though most HAIs rates are on the decline, Clostridium difficile infection rates are at an all-time high, primarily due to the persistence of C. difficile spores in the environment. In the United States, Clostridium difficile-related mortality rates per million have increased from 5. 7 in 1999 to 23. 7 in 2004, with an estimated 26, 642 deaths due to Clostridium difficile infections (CDIs). Clostridium difficile is transmitted via the fecal-oral route or aerosolized endospores, {{but it can also be}} transmitted from high touch surfaces in healthcare facilities, such as door handles, bed rails, and <b>bed</b> <b>pans</b> contaminated with C. difficile spores. Various methods of detection have been established since the 1970 s, but they have limitations, such as cost, time, and availability. The use of a molecular method of detection, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), could provide more rapid and sensitive results for the detection of Clostridium difficile. The objective of this study was to determine the presence of Clostridium difficile pre- and post-decontamination of patients’ rooms in a healthcare facility environment using culture and PCR analysis of surface samples. No culturable C. difficile were detected; however, the culture analysis results showed a significant difference between the number of facultative and anaerobic bacteria in pre-decontamination samples and post-decontamination samples (Z = - 5. 852, p = 0. 000). Of the 128 samples tested using PCR analysis, five samples were positive for Clostridium difficile DNA (3. 9 %); three were from pre-decontamination samples and two were from post-decontamination samples. Reducing the rate of transmission of Clostridium difficile infections in hospitals is dependent on a number of factors (e. g., proper use of antibiotics, environmental decontamination, and proper hand-hygiene). The results of this study indicate decontamination methods used at these facilities were effective in preventing environmental contamination of hospital rooms with facultative and anaerobic bacteria such as, C. difficile...|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the requisite ability and intelligence, Kmenta’s success {{is a testament to}} drive and perseverance. [...] He was a student of statistics at the Czech Technical University in Prague during the 1948 communist coup in Czechoslovakia. After an adventurous escape in September 1949 he spent more than a year in various refugee camps in West Germany before managing to emigrate to Australia in December 1950. Australia was in search of people who would commit to “indentured labour” for two years. The Munich immigration office featured a large poster showing a husky man carrying a bundle of sugar cane with the proclamation “Australia: there is a man’s job for you” thus making it clear that what was wanted were muscles and not brains. Kmenta was assigned to breaking rocks in a stone quarry in Picton (near Sydney). This was a task at which he excelled, managing to get himself fired even in a time of extreme labor shortage so that he could attempt to continue his education. He went to Sydney and met a professor at the Technical College in Ultimo who tested Kmenta’s statistics training and immediately hired him to do statistical calculations. But the employment officer in Sydney would not allow an emigrant to have a job like that and instead sent him to a metal-stamping plant in Balmain. After learning English {{in less than a year}} by listening to the radio and puzzling through newspapers with an English/Czech dictionary Kmenta succeeded in obtaining a job emptying and steam-boiling <b>bed</b> <b>pans</b> in a tuberculosis hospital in Randwick. Sydney University was offering evening courses mainly but not exclusively for servicemen in which Kmenta managed to enroll.

There were several Czechs taking classes, all working during the day to survive. Professor Charles Birch made them feel welcome and advised them regarding administrative procedures for admission to the university and similar matters.|$|R
40|$|The U. S. {{health care}} system is at a turning point, and no more so than in the nation's hospitals. They face {{increasing}} pressures to provide more and better care at lower cost. At the same time, revenue streams [...] from Medicare and other sources [...] are uncertain, as is the future of health insurance reform. New models are emerging for coordinating care and delivering it in a patient-centered way, as are new technologies, from new diagnostic and treatment methods to electronic health records. And the emphasis on demonstrated, measurable evidence of hospital performance has rarely been greater. Yet one thing is constant: health care is a distinctly high-touch, labor-intensive enterprise. And it depends in part on workers at the front lines of care: nursing assistants, housekeepers, medical assistants, unit secretaries, dietary service workers, and a host of others who work 24 / 7 to answer call lights, empty <b>bed</b> <b>pans,</b> pass trays, or draw blood. Today, some health care providers are discovering that investing in the education, training, and career advancement of these frontline workers pays off not only in dollars and cents but also in less measurable ways, including enhanced worker performance and skill, better functioning patient care teams, expanded pipelines for filling positions, and improved morale. The concept of investing in the frontline health care workforce is in good currency, but translating that into wider practice is not simple. At times, it requires overcoming the skepticism of decision makers, both private and public, about the value of long-term investments in human capital. It requires clear models, compelling arguments, and evidence to back them up. But in all cases, it requires engaging the leaders in the "C-Suite" [...] chief executive officers, operating officers, financial officers, human resources officers, nursing officers [...] in bringing the case to their peers in other institutions.

The gross revenue was found to be about £340 – a little more than in 1538, when the Lilleshall estate itself had been omitted.

40|$|The {{conventional}} {{coating of}} pharmaceutical pellets {{is achieved by}} liquid-based coating techniques using a fluidized <b>bed</b> or a <b>pan</b> coater. However, many restrictions and drawbacks such as long processing time and large energy consumption exist in the above method. Dry powder coating technique is a novel solventless coating technique that is able to mitigate the problems of liquid-based coating. In this study, a newly invented coating apparatus called rotary fluidized bed (RFB), was applied for the coating of pharmaceutical pellets by a dry powder coating process. The RFB has a unique structure where the hot fluidizing air is further aided by the rotation to ensure a uniform coating. Results of SEM micrographs indicated the piroxicam pellets formed continuous and dense coating film in the RFB. In-vitro drug release tests confirmed that the dry powder coated pellets successfully achieved immediate release, sustained release and delayed release with Eudragit® EPO, Eudragit® RS/RL and Acryl-EZE, respectively. The optimal operation conditions were as follows: curing temperature 2 h, curing temperature 50 oC, RFB rotating speed ~ 20 rpm, liquid plasticizer spraying rate ~ 0. 25 g/min and fluidizing air flowrate ~ 35 L/min. The RFB demonstrated a comparable film formation quality and coating efficiency with the pan coater, while superior to the fluidized bed. For the more difficult-to-coat micronized pellets (0. 1 - 0. 3 mm), the RFB presented better applicable potential {{than the other two}} apparatus.

Wodrow, later (1701-1731), compiled the marvels of his Analecta. In spite of the cold common-sense of the eighteenth century, sporadic outbreaks of rappings and feats of impulsive pots, <b>pans,</b> <b>beds</b> and chairs insisted on making themselves notorious. The Wesley case {{would never have been}} celebrated if the sons of Samuel Wesley had not become prominent. John Wesley and the Methodists revelled in such narratives, and so the catena of testimonies was lengthened till Mesmer came, and, with Mesmer, the hypothesis of a 'fluidic force' which in various shapes has endured, and is not, even now, wholly extinct. Finally Modern Spiritualism arrived, and was, for the most part, an organised and fraudulent copy of the old popular phenomena, with a few cheap and vulgar variations on the theme.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effects of particle shape on the movement of particles in a pan-coating device using novel video-imaging techniques. An area scan CCD camera was installed inside a 24 -in pan coater at the same location as that of a spray nozzle, and the movement of particle was tracked using machine vision. A white tracer particle was introduced inside a bed of black-coated particles. The effects of pan loading, pan speed, and particle shape on the movement of particles was studied. The response variables were circulation time, surface time, projected area of particle per pass, dynamic angle of repose, cascading velocity, and dispersion coefficient. Experiments were conducted at 3 different pan speeds, 6, 9, and 12 rpm, and 2 fill levels (ratio of <b>bed</b> depth to <b>pan</b> diameter), one eighth and one quarter, and data were collected over a 30 -minute time period. The differences in circulation times of spheres and tablets, with similar volume equivalent diameter as that of the sphere, were found to be insignificant at the 95 % confidence interval. The circulation time ranged from 2. 8 to 10. 8 seconds depending on the operating condition and increased with increasing pan load and decreasing pan speed. The distributions of circulation time, surface time, and projected surface area were found to be nonnormal. The dynamic angle of repose for tablets was higher than for spheres. Also, the bed surface for spheres was much flatter in comparison with tablets where the bed shape attained a “wave-like” form. The average velocity of tablets in the cascading layer was found to be significantly higher than spheres. A linear model (R 2 > 0. 98) best described the variation of velocity as a function of pan speed for all of the operating conditions...|$|R
