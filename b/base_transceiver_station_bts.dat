50|$|A Tower Mounted Amplifier or Mast Head Amplifier is a low-noise {{amplifier}} (LNA) mounted {{as close as}} practical to the antenna in mobile masts or <b>base</b> <b>transceiver</b> <b>stations.</b> A TMA reduces the <b>base</b> <b>transceiver</b> <b>station</b> noise figure (NF) and therefore improves its overall sensitivity; in other words the mobile mast is able to receive weaker signals.|$|R

50|$|BTSM is the Base <b>Station</b> Controller to <b>Base</b> <b>Transceiver</b> <b>Station</b> (BSC - BTS) {{interface}} protocol (the A-bis interface). BTSM allows sending messages {{between the}} Base Station Controller and the <b>Base</b> <b>Transceiver</b> <b>Station.</b> Protocol messages {{consist of a}} series of information elements.

50|$|The Broadcast Control Channel is {{transmitted}} by the <b>base</b> <b>transceiver</b> <b>station</b> (<b>BTS)</b> at all times. The RF carrier used to transmit the BCCH {{is referred to}} as the BCCH carrier. The MS monitors the information carried on the BCCH periodically (at least every 30 secs), when it is switched on and not in a call.|$|E
50|$|E-UTRAN Node B, {{also known}} as Evolved Node B (abbreviated as eNodeB or eNB), is the element in E-UTRA of LTE that is the {{evolution}} of the element Node B in UTRA of UMTS. It is the hardware that is connected to the mobile phone network that communicates directly wirelessly with mobile handsets (UEs), like a <b>base</b> <b>transceiver</b> <b>station</b> (<b>BTS)</b> in GSM networks.|$|E
50|$|The Um {{interface}} is the {{air interface}} for the GSM mobile telephone standard. It is {{the interface between}} the mobile station (MS) and the <b>Base</b> <b>transceiver</b> <b>station</b> (<b>BTS).</b> It is called Um {{because it is the}} mobile analog to the U interface of ISDN. Um is defined in the GSM 04.xx and 05.xx series of specifications. Um can also support GPRS packet-oriented communication.|$|E
30|$|Lastly, not {{too many}} {{research}} papers in the literature targeted on power saving {{at the side of}} eNB in LTE. Authors in [33] showed that energy consumption can be significantly reduced by introducing discontinuous transmission (DTX) at eNB, and up to 61  % of the energy can be saved in a realistic traffic scenario. A distributed wake-up scheduling algorithm for the <b>base</b> <b>transceiver</b> <b>stations</b> in a cellular network was proposed in [34], in which a <b>base</b> <b>transceiver</b> <b>station</b> dynamically decides on its operation mode (off, sleep, or active) according to the measured traffic load of itself and its neighbors in a distributed manner.|$|R

5000|$|A <b>base</b> <b>transceiver</b> <b>station</b> (<b>BTS)</b> is a {{piece of}} {{equipment}} that facilitates wireless communication between user equipment (UE) and a network. UEs are devices like mobile phones (handsets), WLL phones, computers with wireless Internet connectivity. The network can be that of any of the wireless communication technologies like GSM, CDMA, wireless local loop, Wi-Fi, WiMAX or other wide area network (WAN) technology.|$|E

5000|$|In Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) networks, {{the correct}} term is <b>Base</b> <b>Transceiver</b> <b>Station</b> (<b>BTS),</b> and colloquial {{synonyms}} are [...] "mobile phone mast" [...] or [...] "base station". The term [...] "base station site" [...] might better reflect the increasing co-location of multiple mobile operators, and therefore multiple base stations, {{at a single}} site. Depending on an operator's technology, even a site hosting just a single mobile operator may house multiple base stations, each to serve a different air interface technology (CDMA2000 or GSM, for example).|$|E
50|$|Since U-TDOA {{requires}} physical {{access to}} the cellular network's cell towers (<b>base</b> <b>transceiver</b> <b>stations</b> or BTS), it is only available to {{the owner of the}} sensor network, which is typically the carrier. Therefore, the solution is generally not available when roaming.|$|R

50|$|A {{broadcast}} {{control channel}} (BCCH) {{is a point}} to multipoint, unidirectional (downlink) channel used in the Um interface of the GSM cellular standard.The BCCH carries a repeating pattern of system information messages that describe the identity, configuration and available features of the <b>base</b> <b>transceiver</b> <b>station</b> (<b>BTS).</b> These messages also provide a list of absolute radio-frequency channel numbers (ARFCNs) used by neighboring BTSs. This message pattern is synchronized to the BTS frame clock. The minimum BCCH message set is system information messages 2-4, although other messages are normally present. The messages themselves are described in 3GPP Technical Specification 44.018.|$|E
5000|$|In {{order to}} {{efficiently}} transport slowly varying channel associated signalling bits, second order structures known as multiframes or superframes are defined. For example, for E1 trunks the CAS signaling bits are updated once per multiframe of 16 frames (every 2 milliseconds) while for T1 ESF trunks the superframe is 24 frames (3 milliseconds). Other types of second order structures {{are also in}} common use. In GSM cellular networks, the Abis channel that connects the <b>Base</b> <b>Transceiver</b> <b>Station</b> (<b>BTS)</b> and Base Station Controller (BSC) is an E1 link with several framing alternatives, {{all of which have}} a basic superframe duration of 20 milliseconds.|$|E
5000|$|In GSM {{cellular}} networks, {{the base}} station {{is aware of the}} distance (but not direction) of a mobile phone by use of a technique called [...] "timing advance" [...] (TA). The <b>base</b> <b>transceiver</b> <b>station</b> (<b>BTS)</b> can determine how far the mobile station (MS) is by interpreting the reported TA. This information, along with other parameters, can then be used to power down the BTS or MS, if a power control feature is implemented in the network. The power control in either BTS or MS is implemented in most modern networks, especially on the MS, as this ensures a better battery life for the MS. This is also why having a BTS close to the user results in less exposure to electromagnetic radiation.|$|E
25|$|As a {{fallback}} to ETCS, an intermittent {{train control}} system (Punktförmige Zugbeeinflussung) was modelled, which would allow operations outside of stations with turnouts at speeds of up 160km/h. Procedures were also developed for dealing with a malfunctioning GSM-R <b>Base</b> <b>transceiver</b> <b>station,</b> so that trains can be run through.|$|R
50|$|DPCCH, Dedicated Physical Control CHannel, {{is a term}} from UMTS. This is the {{physical}} channel on which the signalling is transmitted, both on the uplink by the UE (user equipment) to the Node B (the <b>base</b> <b>transceiver</b> <b>station)</b> and on the downlink by the Node B to the UE.|$|R
50|$|LAPDm is a {{data link}} layer {{protocol}} used in GSM cellular networks. LAPDm forms Layer 2 of the Um interface between the <b>Base</b> <b>Transceiver</b> <b>Station</b> and Mobile station, {{which is to say}} that it is used in the radio link between the cellular network and the subscriber handset.|$|R
