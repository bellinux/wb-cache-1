In April 2015, the appeal court partially upheld the trial court's verdict, ordering that the Watch Tower Society pay compensatory damages amounting to US$2.8 million, but concluded that the congregation had no duty to warn the parents or members about the child abuse history of other members. The case was settled for an undisclosed sum while on appeal {{to the supreme court}} of California. In 2016 a UK judge upheld a ruling against the Jehovah's Witnesses for failing to protect a victim of child sexual abuse, and the supreme court rejected an attempt by the Watch Tower Society to block a Charity Commission inquiry into how the organisation's charity handles allegations of abuse.

30|$|Greater {{understanding}} of plant invasions and the invasibility of plant communities is needed, and this understanding needs {{to cover a}} large portion of the invasive species’ range. More applied research is needed on plant invasions (Baskin 1997, Moss 2008, Esler et al. 2010), and our analysis suggests that the need is especially great with regard to fire relationships. Studies on fire should consistently report burning conditions and fire behavior using standard terminology (e.g., National Wildfire Coordinating Group, Incident Operations Standards Working Team 1996). Whenever possible, studies should examine the effects of varying fire severity, season, and frequency. Statistical comparisons of invasive plant abundance data from before and after fire or on burned and unburned plots are needed, and long-term studies, extending over decades rather than months or years, are badly needed. Finally, research publications need to clearly articulate the <b>basis</b> <b>and</b> <b>scope</b> of inference for the information reported. To apply this information appropriately, managers need to know if it is based on field observation, years of accumulated experience, speculation, or inference.|$|E

Accepting that the most probable and most beneficial possibility for Ukraine is to conclude an association agreement with the EU {{on the basis of}} Article 310 EC Treaty (EC), it is argued that the objectives of the enhanced co-operation between the EU and Ukraine - as expected and desired by the Ukrainian political élite - could be achieved by a partnership agreement concluded on the basis of Article 181 a EC. Furthermore, if the new enhanced EU-Ukraine agreement were concluded as a partnership agreement, it might be better suited for the solving of certain political and legal challenges in contemporary EU-Ukraine relations. First, a new enhanced agreement concluded on the basis of Article 181 a EC would not entail unjustified political expectations - on the part of Ukraine - of obtaining the perspective of full EU-membership in the near future. Second, a future EU-Ukraine partnership agreement would be the best option for a “transitional” enhanced agreement before the Treaty of Lisbon enters into force. Third, a future partnership agreement between the EU and Ukraine will not undermine the fundamentals of the evolving strategic partnership between the EU and Russia...|$|E

40|$|The {{absence of}} {{protection}} from persecution is a precondition to qualifying as a refugee. However, protection is not solely provided by states and {{may stem from}} non-state actors (NSAs) such as international organizations.

30|$|Face is a self-image {{a person}} forms {{in terms of}} their {{interest}} in being favorably or appropriately regarded or judged by others. It is a social representation of a person reflecting the respect, regard or confidence others have in them which they both possess or are consciousness of themselves and of which others are aware (Goffman 1972, p. 5; Qi 2011, p. 287). The evaluations of self which are constitutive of a face-state are thus necessarily socially current and never merely personal or idiosyncratic. It is often noticed that in societies influenced by Protestant culture, individuals are presumed to be autonomous and to behave on the basis of decisions determined by their individual will (Hamilton & Wang, 1992, pp. 25 – 26). In these societies, individual autonomy is mediated primarily by subjection to a providential God, at least until the late eighteenth century, or since that time through {{the rule of law and}} related abstract rational constructions. Individual autonomy in these societies is limited by individual rights, religious or legal, which specify its <b>basis</b> <b>and</b> <b>scope.</b> In this context, an individual’s face-state is assumed to depend on how they represent themselves or behave in a way that produces social acceptance or respect. In Chinese society, on the other hand, individuals are embedded in social relationships in which there are obligations defined by the roles through which social engagements occur. This entails that a person’s face-state shall depend not only on their own behavior but also on the behavior of other persons with whom they are socially connected. This entails another side of face, in which a person’s face is also a consequence of the behavior of face-related persons. Such face-related persons may include family members, but also persons in teacher-student, employer-employee and other individual-group relationships. This issue is more or less ignored in the literature on face, but has relevance for a comprehensive understanding of face. Conceptualization of it can help fill gaps left by the current conventional theorization of face.|$|E
40|$|A stock {{appreciation}} rights (SARs) {{program is}} a form of deferred incentive compensation. Grantees are awarded SAR-units representing an equal number of the grantor’s equity shares currently being traded in public markets. SARs provide grantees the benefit of stock ownership without equity interest, investment, or risk of loss. Stock appreciation rights programs offer various advantages over other forms of executive compensation and have grown rapidly in number. These advantages include the availability of benefits without the requirement of monetary payments, the utilization of SARs as an interest-free form of financing the purchase of stock under tandem stock option programs, the job performance incentive created by the correlation of earnings and market appreciation is measured over a longer time span than is generally used for stock option plans, thus better serving the corporate purpose of retained employment. Additionally, paired with the elimination of the preferential tax treatment of qualified stock options in the Tax Reform Act of 1976, SARs have become increasingly popular. However, despite the attractiveness of SAR programs, recently adopted amendments to the Security Exchange Commission’s rule 16 b- 3 have substantially chilled the continued growth of SARs. This Article will discuss the issues raised by the Commission 2 ̆ 7 s adoption of the amendments to rule 16 b- 3. After briefly describing the most important features of SAR programs, it will consider the question which the Commission did not choose to answer-whether section 16 (b) applies to transactions in SARs.

40|$|This study investigates an {{instance}} of a service which attempts to meet significantly varying demand {{in an environment where}} the service is provided free at the point of delivery. This is a not unconimon scenario within the public sector. The example chosen is that of the computer network at the University of Central Lancashire. This example has the advantages to the author of being based in his own institution, and until 1991 he was involved in the initial development of the system. The investigation is founded on three theoretical research areas: the working methods and findings of previous authors are examined by literature review; microeconomic theory is deployed by explaining the operation of relevant models and their applicability to the study; the wider educational issues are explored through further literature review, guided by the development of a reference model. The literature search and review reported in chapter 3 focuses on the working methods and findings used by previous authors researching into student use of networked computer workstations in higher education. It is found that authors have used a variety of techniques. In many cases, usage data - collected from system logs, diaries or questionnaires - is compared with attitudinal or demographic data in order to account for differing patterns of use. A number of authors, however, express disquiet at an apparent lack of theoretical underpinning in the relevant literature. In an effort to make a contribution towards addressing this, chapter 4 examines the possible role of microeconomics. It reviews two microeconomic approaches: the 'characteristics approach' to consumer demand normally attributed to K. J. Lancaster, and then the 'club goods' world of J. M. Buchanan. Both sections review the literature citing the relevant work and hence explain the theories together with their possible application in the student use of networked computer workstations. Both models are found to be relevant and helpful in providing a <b>basis</b> <b>and</b> <b>scope</b> for the further literature survey in chapterS, and the empirical work with usage and demographic data reported in chapters 6 and 7. In conclusion, chapter 8 shows that this thesis does provide a contribution in supporting the information gathering phase of developing a new system. It could, for example, be used directly as 'scaffolding' in the design of instruments for the elicitation of user requirements and in the setting of agendas for discussing the results. Chapter 8 also shows that this thesis gives rise to a number of further opportunities for focused research...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} ethics and norms associated with contracting in Ptolemaic and Roman Egypt as {{a contribution to}} the institutional study of ancient contract and its relationship to the economic history of the Roman world. Although ancient contracts in the Hellenistic tradition (i. e., non-Roman law contracts) have been studied rigorously from a legal perspective, there has been no systematic study of contract as an economic institution in the eastern half of the ancient Mediterranean. The first three chapters argue that such a study is a historical desideratum and seek to establish the theoretical and methodological <b>basis</b> <b>and</b> <b>scope</b> of such a project. Theoretically, the most decisive factor in determining the nature, extent, and success of contract as an economic institution is actual enforcement, as opposed to mere legal "enforceability. " While the modern (Western) state has been justly credited with having had a transformative effect on contract by publishing clear rules (i. e., contract law) and providing effective "third-party" enforcement, even modern contracts depend on the enforcement activities of the individual parties and the power of social norms. Historically, {{there is no question that}} the ancient state, Rome included, was less invested and less effective in its support and promotion of private contracting than its modern counterparts. Ethics and norms therefore played a larger and more important role in ancient contracting than they have in the last century and as such need to be studied in their own right. The nature of the project also argues for Egypt being the primary locus of study, since the papyri afford us the most complete access to ancient individuals and organizations using contracts to organize transactions. After the theoretical and methodological discussion, there follow explorations of several important social values and norms with respect to contracting in Graeco-Roman Egypt, including trust (pistis), "respect" (eugnōmosynē), and "breach. " The results show how "personal" contracting was and reveal some of the ways in which individuals bridged the inevitable "trust gaps" in their efforts to build credible commitments with those outside the immediate circle of their trusted intimates. It also illuminates the discourse of reputation, a key lever in ancient contract formation and enforcement. Finally, the notion of breach is shown to have become both more common and to have evolved conceptually in written contracts over time. It is argued that these changes in the idea and drafting of breach should be interpreted in light of a larger pattern of historical and legal development spanning the second century BCE to the second century CE, a period which witnessed an increasing "moralization" of contract, itself an adaptation to an enforcement regime heavily dependent on ethics and norms. The last chapter offers a synthesis of the findings and a prospectus of the next phase of the project, which turns to the role of the state, arguing that it was generally more effective and activist than the current opinion allows...|$|E
40|$|EU merger {{regulations}} {{rely on the}} “significant {{impediment to}} effective competition ” substantive test. However, the clause that incorporates these tests is not clear regarding implementation criteria. As a result, in many cases assessment and decisions about Mergers and Acquisitions are adopted in an uncertain legal context. Often this situation is justified for two reasons: first, the need to incorporate the economic complexity into the decision; and second, the prospective nature of merger assessment. Nevertheless, {{from the perspective of}} Law many questions arise. Prospective decisions are unsuitable to deal with classic theories of regulation and judicial review. As we explain in this paper, the European Commission adopts its decision based on the foreseeable behaviour of an undertaking. European Courts recognize the Commission’s ample discretion to assess merger on a case-by-case <b>basis</b> <b>and</b> limit the <b>scope</b> of judicial review. As a result, commentators have criticized the EC merger regulation. In this paper these issues are considered.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that many governments have resorted {{to a wide range of}} constructions to justify, under {{international}} law, their unilateral exceptions to human rights in the name of countering terrorism. This paper seeks to take stock of a range of arguments, doctrines or constructions that states may resort to when seeking to justify their unilateral exceptions to human rights norms in the fight against terrorism. Many constructions have a valid legal <b>basis</b> <b>and</b> a proper <b>scope</b> of application. However, they also have limitations and often relate to a specific treaty, or the availability of a procedure, but do not alter the substantive obligations of the state in question under international law. In many cases, this results from the overlap of treaty law and customary norms of international law. Some of the constructions are open to abuse, i. e. bad faith efforts to distort international law to the detriment of human rights. Because the combined effect of the various excuses and exceptions are complex, there is a need for a holistic approach which seeks to address the combined effect of various constructions of unilateral exceptions.
