5|$|Evans {{frequently}} quarrelled {{with fellow}} inventors and engineering peers over steam {{technology in the}} mid-1800s. His increasing frustration led to his premature publication {{of what he had}} hoped would be the equivalent of his earlier manual for millers—the petulantly titled The Abortion of the Young Steam Engineer's Guide. The Steam Engineer's Guide was significantly shorter than this first book and less structured in its approach. A third of the book is devoted to an ongoing argument between Evans and John Stevens (another prominent steam engineer of the day), much of which had previously appeared in the journal The Medical Repository and to which now Evans added various additional criticisms of Stevens' contentions. Evans concludes his book by renouncing inventing and any further work on his designs, complaining of the ingratitude of the public and the unprofitability of the endeavour, although this would prove to <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> of many such assertions by Evans over the coming years. Regardless, the Steam Engineer's Guide proved to be a popular work, though not on the same scale as his guide to milling, however it was the first book in the United States to make accessible to anyone ideas and techniques for steam engineering.|$|E
25|$|The TSPC {{was opposed}} to the new plan. Its commissioners feared that their {{greatest}} work would pass to the control of an agency for which it would <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> of many responsibilities, {{and that it would}} be necessary to make the Taconic a toll road in order to pay for the improvements planned. When the bill passed and the EHPA was created, with most of its members from Westchester, Columbia County residents feared the road would never be completed. The TSPC was allowed to operate the Taconic through 1962, by agreement with the EHPA, since the former's budget was already in place.|$|E

25|$|E. japonica {{is a very}} large, thickset baleen whale. It {{very closely}} resembles the North Atlantic right whale (E. glacialis) the {{southern}} right whale (E. australis), so much so they were long thought to <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> species. Indeed, without knowing which ocean an individual came from, the physical similarities are so extensive that individuals can only be identified to species by genetic analysis. Relative to the other right whale species, E. japonica may be slightly larger. Like other baleen whales, female North Pacific right whales are larger than males. Also, North Pacific brindle-colored individuals are less common than they are among southern right whales.|$|E

25|$|The first {{hearing was}} held with the Shafii {{scholars}} who accused Ibn Taymiyyah of anthropomorphism. At the time Ibn Taymiyyah was 42 years old. He {{was protected by}} the then Governor of Damascus, Aqqush al-Afram, during the proceedings. The scholars suggested that he accept that his creed was simply that of the Hanbalites and offered this as {{a way out of}} the charge. The issue being, if Ibn Taymiyyah ascribed his creed to the Hanbali school of law then it would <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> view out of the four schools which one could follow rather than a creed everybody must adhere to. Ibn Taymiyyah was uncompromising and maintained that it was obligatory for all scholars to adhere to his creed.|$|E

25|$|Engaging this dialogical {{process of}} {{communicating}} is how human beings {{come to be}} composed of multiple voices (which constitute their horizons) that are in constant flux and always incomplete. This implies that Dasein's self-interpretations are never complete; ergo, the establishing of Dasein's identity is never finished and {{his knowledge of the}} world and others is never complete. If Dasein's identity and knowledge is never complete, then human beings are never complete. Bakhtin referred to this as human beings always being unfinalized. In other words, Dasein is never complete because his understanding of himself (i.e. his self-interpretations) remains open to future re-interpretation as his knowledge increases via ongoing dialogue with others and the world. Furthermore, the number of possibilities of who Dasein may become is infinite so long as Dasein remains unfinalized. And, who Dasein is at any given moment may <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> voice, or may be one temporarily aligned hierarchy of voices (dialogical positions) that will realign the next moment. More to the point, Dasein’s identity never exists as an immaterial entity in his mind, rather it emerges through his embodied acts while relating to others. Philosophers and hermeneutic psychotherapists who reject the mind-body dualism state that is another significant contrast between ontological hermeneutics and mainstream counseling.|$|E
500|$|Historical {{circumstances}} and values in India have caused feminists {{to develop a}} feminism that differs from Western feminism. For example, the idea of women as [...] "powerful" [...] is accommodated into patriarchal culture through religion, which has retained visibility in all sections of society.

[...] Furthermore, in the West the notion of [...] "self" [...] rests in competitive individualism where people are described as [...] "born free yet everywhere in chains." [...] In India the individual is usually considered to <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> {{part of the larger}} social collective. Survival of the individual is dependent upon cooperation, and self-denial for the greater good is valued.|$|E

[...] Electronic Gaming Monthly's three reviewers gave it a 9, 9.5, and 9 out of ten, one saying: [...] "I'll be surprised if you can find a better game on any system this fall." [...] Newtype USA named Ōkami its Game of the Month for October 2006, heralded the pacing as [...] "nearly flawless" [...] and proclaimed [...] "Ōkami is that rarest of beasts: a game without any obvious flaws. Clover's creativity and attention to detail are on full display here. Shame on any gamer who passes up this divine adventure." [...] Eurogamer scored the game 10/10 saying [...] "Right from the start it conjures an atmosphere of being something special, but to keep that level of quality up consistently over 60 hours ensures that this will be a game that will be talked about for years to come". In 2007, Ōkami was named eighteenth best PlayStation 2 game of all time in IGN's feature reflecting on the PlayStation 2's long lifespan. Famitsu gave the game a near perfect score of 39 out of 40, the 15th game to date to receive this score from the publication.|$|E

2500|$|In addition, Newton {{would spend}} {{much of his life}} seeking and {{revealing}} what could be considered a Bible Code. He placed a great deal of emphasis upon the interpretation of the Book of Revelation, writing generously upon this book and authoring several manuscripts detailing his interpretations. Unlike a prophet in the true sense of the word, Newton relied upon existing Scripture to prophesy for him, believing his interpretations would set the record straight {{in the face of what}} he considered to be [...] "so little understood". [...] In 1754, 27 years after his death, Isaac Newton's treatise, An Historical Account of Two Notable Corruptions of Scripture would be published, and though it does not argue any prophetic meaning, it does exemplify what Newton considered to <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> popular misunderstanding of Scripture.|$|E

2500|$|Scientific [...] "Materialism" [...] {{is often}} synonymous with, and {{has so far}} been described, as being a reductive materialism. In recent years, Paul and Patricia Churchland have {{advocated}} a radically contrasting position (at least, in regards to certain hypotheses); eliminativist materialism holds that some mental phenomena simply do not exist at all, and that talk of those mental phenomena reflects a totally spurious [...] "folk psychology" [...] and introspection illusion. That is, an eliminative materialist might believe that a concept like [...] "belief" [...] simply has no basis in fact—the way folk science speaks of demon-caused illnesses would <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> obvious example.
