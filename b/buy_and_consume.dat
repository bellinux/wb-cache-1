40|$|European {{consumers}} {{have been in}} sombre mood as they battle {{to make ends meet}} in an economic recession. Yet, for many countries, the past 50 years or so has been a halcyon period of economic growth and, in real terms, declining food prices. Apart from lower food prices, attributes of convenience, health, pleasure and more esoteric social elements such as animal welfare-friendliness and environmental sustainability are increasingly important to consumers in their food choices. With higher household incomes has come an increasingly segmented food market, as businesses seek to differentiate their products from competitors to earn a premium above the basic commodity price. In an increasingly competitive European and global market, whether the firm is small or large, the first step in successful product differentiation requires an insightful understanding of the drivers of consumer purchase and consumption behaviour. These have fundamental commercial importance in the marketing strategy of any business. Yet, a surprising number of businesses in the food and beverage industry know very little about who <b>buys</b> <b>and</b> <b>consumes</b> their products. In the 21 -super-st century, the primacy of consumers and citizens will be substantially more 'front and centre' than in the previous 50 years of production-driven agricultural and food policy.

Estas tintas são preparadas com uma emulsão de copolímero acrílico e aplicadas para pinturas internas em paredes. O procedimento de otimização foi realizado tendo como base um desenho experimental por um método de mistura nomeado de Simplex segundo Monte-Carlo. Amostras de tinta foram preparadas por reposição de massa da carga original com a mesma massa de três diferentes minerais. Cada uma variou de 0 % a 100 %. Dois de nove minerais testados são normalmente usados em formulações de tintas no Brasil. Elas são Carbonato de Cálcio Precipitado (PCC) e Carbonato de Cálcio Natural (GCC). A terceira carga foi selecionada entre Caulins (C, SB, PA) Dolomitas (DR,DM), Agalmatolito (A) e Filito (F). Os resultados obtidos mostraram que os três tipos de caulins testados se mostraram mais eficiêntes em relação ao poder de cobertura do que as dolomitas.
