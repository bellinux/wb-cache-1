The vowel inventory has also been attributed {{to the fact that}} unlike other American pioneers, the Mormon pioneers were from New England as opposed to the American South. As such, many of the vowels in the Deseret alphabet have since merged in the modern era: they are no longer distinguished in many dialects of English.|$|E

25|$|Лоза (The Vine, 1923) {{contained}} 23 poems, which trace Parnok's {{life from}} her physical {{birth to her}} spiritual rebirth in Sudak. The poems trace her first awakening to poetry, her frustration at being unable to express herself as she wanted, the new ideas planted by Tsvetaeva, her failure to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> seriously without being distracted by love interests and life, and finally her recognition and acknowledgement that poetry was her true vocation. Her poems, were like her children, her legacy, requiring spiritual nurturing, rather than purely words inspired by sexual passion.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to fiction writing, Kawabata also {{worked as a}} reporter, most notably for the Mainichi Shimbun. Although he refused {{to participate in the}} militaristic fervor that accompanied World War II, he also demonstrated little interest in postwar political reforms. Along with the death of all his family while he was young, Kawabata suggested that the War {{was one of the greatest}} influences on his work, stating he would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> only elegies in postwar Japan. Still, many commentators detect little thematic change between Kawabata's prewar and postwar writings.|$|E

He decided to stop writing until he had made enough money to support himself through other means, {{so that he would}} <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> when and as he pleased. He wrote no fiction for more than a decade, until the late 1920s, when he had saved substantial money through his school banking system. Ironically, just as Stout was starting to write fiction again, he lost most of the money that he had made as a businessman in the Depression of 1929.|$|E

He believes that {{the treatment of the}} language should be taken {{out of the hands of}} Greek philologists who are currently destroying it. He defends the continued use of polytonic Greek, traditional spelling and the freedom to write in any literary tone. He regards as erroneous only the implementation of a Greek form not used from the time of Homer to today.|$|E

500|$|Laundry Service (...) is {{the fifth}} studio album by Colombian singer and {{songwriter}} Shakira, globally released on 13 November 2001 by Epic Records. It is her first album to be primarily recorded in English. After the release of her fourth studio album Dónde Están los Ladrones?, which became a success in Latin America, Shakira was encouraged by American singer Gloria Estefan to record songs in English as she believed the singer {{had the potential to}} crossover into the English-language pop market. Shakira was initially hesitant to undertake the project, but later decided to learn English well enough to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> songs in the language herself. The title of the album was chosen to reflect Shakira's views on love and music. It was also released as Servicio de Lavandería in Hispanic regions in January 2002. Musically, Laundry Service is primarily a pop rock record but it also experiments with a variety of other musical styles, including Andean music, dance-pop, Middle Eastern music, rock and roll and tango. The lyrical theme of the album is mostly based around love and romance. Every song on the album was written and produced by Shakira.|$|E
500|$|The {{role was}} the most {{difficult}} to cast, and eventually the filmmakers decided to approach Cleese, noting [...] "Who would you rather make the argument [...] for mankind than John Cleese?" [...] Stoff, a producer, had met Cleese a few times beforehand and had noted his intellect. The actor was surprised the filmmakers were interested in him, and decided playing a dramatic role would be easier than to play a comedic one at his age. He was often reminded to speed up his dialogue so that Reeves would not appear in synchronity with normal human speech patterns. Cleese said he is not interested in extraterrestrial life because he often philosophizes about the purpose of life and why humans are distracted by trivial matters. Cleese spoke about portraying abilities outside his own experience in the scene in which Klaatu corrects a formula Barnhardt has written on a blackboard: [...] "The trouble is, I had to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> the equation, because Barnhardt has been working on it for 60 years. I learned to carefully copy things down that mean nothing to me at all. In A Fish Called Wanda, I spoke a lot of Russian without having any idea what it means." ...|$|E

Loud's pen had a small rotating steel ball, {{held in place by}} a socket.

With no commercial viability, its potential went unexploited and the patent eventually lapsed.|$|E

Many of the main characters take the opportunity to depart and return home; Socrates, however, stays awake until dawn. As Aristodemus wakes up and leaves the house, Socrates is proclaiming to Agathon and Aristophanes that a skilful playwright should <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> comedy as well as tragedy (223d).

2500|$|Traditional {{education}} was largely biblical. It {{began with the}} learning of the alphabet, or more properly, syllabary... The student's second grade comprised the memorization of {{the first chapter of}} the first Epistle General of St. John in Geez. The study of writing would probably also begin at this time, and particularly in more modern times some arithmetic might be added. In the third stage the Acts of the Apostles were studied, while certain prayers were also learnt, and writing and arithmetic continued. ... The fourth stage began with the study of the Psalms of David and was considered an important landmark in a child's education, being celebrated by the parents with a feast to which the teacher, father confessor, relatives and neighbours were invited. A boy who had reached this stage would moreover usually <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>write,</b> and might act as a letter writer.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{recorded}} {{invasion of the}} Magyars (or Hungarians) from the Pontic steppes to Central Europe occurred in 861. The Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin started around 894. The contemporaneous Regino of Prüm recorded that the Magyars [...] "attacked the lands of the Carinthians, Moravians and Bulgars" [...] shortly after their arrival. The first extant Hungarian chronicle, the Gesta Hungarorum, which was written centuries after the events, contains a more detailed narration of the Hungarian Conquest. The chronicle wrote of one Duke Glad, who had come [...] "from the castle of Vidin" [...] in Bulgaria and ruled Banat {{at the time of}} the arrival of the Hungarians. Glad's army was [...] "supported by Cumans, Bulgarians and Vlachs", according to the same source.

2500|$|A subset Y of X can be {{identified}} with an indexed family of bits with index set X, with the bit indexed by x ∈ X being 1 or 0 according {{to whether or not}} x ∈ Y. (This is the so-called characteristic function notion of a subset.) [...] For example, a 32-bit computer word consists of 32 bits indexed by the set {0,1,2,…,31}, with 0 and 31 indexing the low and high order bits respectively. For a smaller example, if X = {a,b,c} where a, b, c are viewed as bit positions in that order from left to right, the eight subsets {}, {c}, {b}, {b,c}, {a}, {a,c}, {a,b}, and {a,b,c} of X can {{be identified}} with the respective bit vectors 000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, and 111.

2500|$|Although {{there is}} {{agreement}} among the band that [...] "Fairytale of New York" [...] was first written in 1985, {{the origins of the}} song are disputed: MacGowan insisted that it arose {{as a result of a}} wager made by The Pogues' producer at the time, Elvis Costello, that the band would not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> a Christmas hit single; The Pogues' manager Frank Murray has stated that it was originally his idea that the band should try and write a Christmas song as he thought it would be [...] "interesting". It was banjo player Finer who came up with the melody and the original concept for the song, which involved a sailor looking out over the ocean. Finer's wife Marcia did not like the original story, and suggested new lyrics regarding a conversation between a couple at Christmas. Finer told NME, [...] "I had written two songs complete with tunes, one had a good tune and crap lyrics, the other had the idea for 'Fairytale' but the tune was poxy, I gave them both to Shane and he gave it a Broadway melody, and there it was".|$|E
