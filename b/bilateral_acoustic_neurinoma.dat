40|$|To {{the best}} of our {{knowledge}} this is the first description of a choroidal melanoma with documented growth in neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF 2). A 20 -year-old patient with NF 2 presenting deafness due to <b>bilateral</b> <b>acoustic</b> <b>neurinomas</b> and unilateral amaurosis due to a meningioma of the optic nerve developed a pigmented parapapillary choroidal tumor. Despite signs indicating the diagnosis of a melanoma, periodic observation was chosen in order to postpone functional amputation following optic nerve irradiation. The tumor growth was slow during the 5 years that followed, and once progression became rapid, the tumor was treated by accelerated proton beam radiotherapy. One year later, visual acuity diminished due to actinic optic neuropathy and was stabilized at 0. 3 for the 2 following years. The tumor presented objective signs of regression, and no sign of metastatic disease was observed. The therapeutic approach in this case provided local control of the tumor while preserving useful visual function...|$|R

40|$|CSF {{rhinorrhea}} is {{a common}} complication of <b>acoustic</b> <b>neurinoma</b> surgery via the suboccipital route. In this paper we present our incidence of CSF rhinorrhea and our surgical techniques for {{reducing the risk of}} this post-surgical complication. Following removal of the <b>acoustic</b> <b>neurinoma,</b> the drilled posterior wall of the internal auditory canal is covered with bonewax, muscle or fat pieces, and fibrin-glue, while the previously reflected dura is sutured in place keeping the packing material in position. Bone chips removed during the craniectomy are then mixed with fibric glue and are used for a cranioplasty. Although we routinely perform aggressive drilling of internal auditory canal to facilitate total removal of the <b>acoustic</b> <b>neurinoma,</b> only 1 out of 94 consecutive cases (1 %) showed postoperative CSF rhinorrhea. Since previous reports mention the rate of this complication following <b>acoustic</b> <b>neurinoma</b> surgery varies between 4 % and 27 %, we believe that our methods may be useful in helping reduce the incidence of postoperative rhinorrhea...|$|R

40|$|We present our {{experience}} with 83 patients with <b>acoustic</b> <b>neurinomas</b> (January 1988 to November 1996); 81 patients underwent surgery and 2 patients with intracanalicular neurinomas received conservative therapy {{due to their}} advanced age (1 case) and patient's option (1 case). The surgical approach was retrosigmoid/ trasmeatal and the goal was total removal in one procedure with preservation of facial and cochlear nerves. Radical removal of lesion was attempted in 79 cases and it was possible in 77 patients. Subtotal tumor resection was planned in 2 cases. Facial nerve function (grades 1 to III, House and Brackman) was preseved in 90 % and hearing in 58 % of those with preoperative hearing. Three patients died due to postoperative complications. Early diagnosis of <b>acoustic</b> <b>neurinomas</b> {{is the most important}} factor in the prognosis and is one of the most important conquest of neurophysiology and modern neuroimaging.

40|$|AbstractAn {{autoimmune}} hypothesis for {{the etiology}} of Meniere’s disease has been proposed. In this study, we focused on gangliosides as potential antigens for autoantibodies in Meniere’s disease patients. In an attempt to investigate ganglioside antigens which respond to the serum of patients with Meniere’s disease, we analyzed gangliosides of human <b>acoustic</b> <b>neurinomas,</b> and used them as antigens to broadly explore gangliosides that react to serum. All the <b>acoustic</b> <b>neurinoma</b> samples {{used in the present}} study showed a similar ganglioside profile on TLC (thin-layer chromatography). For the microscale ganglioside analysis, a newly developed TLC blotting/secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) system together with TLC immunostaining method was employed. Most of the ganglioside bands could be analyzed, and they were identified as GM 3, GM 2, SPG, GM 1 a, GD 3, S-i (sialyl-i ganglioside) and GD 1 a. GD 1 a was the predominant ganglioside and many neolactoseries gangliosides were recognized by immunological analysis. Next, the immune reactivity of serum samples, from patients with Meniere’s disease, with the <b>acoustic</b> <b>neurinoma</b> gangliosides was studied by TLC immunostaining. The result showed that five of 11 patients with Meniere’s disease and one of eight normal subjects reacted with a specific band, which was identified as S-i by the TLC blotting/SIMS system. The findings of the present study indicate that S-i ganglioside is an autoantigen and possibly involved in the pathogenesis of Meniere’s disease...|$|R
