5|$|The Lady Vols {{were awarded}} the No. 1 {{seed in the}} Mideast Regional where their {{opponent}} was, oddly enough, also undefeated. The 28–0 Lady Flames of Liberty were the champions of the Big South conference, giving them a berth in the tournament as a No. 16 seed. The usual #1-#16 <b>blowout</b> occurred, with Tennessee winning 102–58, although in another region this <b>blowout</b> did not occur: No. 16 seed Harvard upset injury-depleted No. 1 seed Stanford 71–67 in the West regional. This {{is the only time}} that a 16-seed has beaten a 1-seed in the NCAA tournament— men's or women's.|$|E

40|$|WELL CONTROL OPERATIONS are {{critical}} in pro-tecting {{the safety of}} the employees and the environment. Loss of well control incidents (<b>blowouts)</b> are known to be expensive and cause delays in bringing important production online. <b>Blowouts</b> may also lead to fires, explosions, injuries, property damage and pollution. It is important for industry to minimize the occurrence of these events by implementing safety pro-grams and procedures that will prevent and reduce the sever-ity of <b>blowouts</b> during drilling operations. This article summarizes information about <b>blowouts</b> that occurred during drilling operations on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) from 1992 through 2006 and compares this infor-mation with the previous study conducted for drilling <b>blowouts</b> that occurred from 1971 through 1991.

30|$|The {{investigation}} {{showed that}} boards blow out {{due to a}} rise in vapor pressure inside the board. Isocyanate resin is known to produce carbon dioxide during its curing and {{is believed to be}} more vulnerable to <b>blowouts</b> than urea–formaldehyde resin [7]. However, this study showed that the high bonding strength of isocyanate resin prevented <b>blowouts.</b> On the other hand, the board inside during hot pressing is a high-temperature and high-pressure vapor atmosphere, which may inhibit the curing of urea–formaldehyde resin. This reduces bonding strength [5, 12] and causes <b>blowouts.</b> However, the curing of isocyanate resin is hardly affected by high-temperature and high-pressure vapor, and so the bonding strength remains strong [4, 12]. Therefore, isocyanate resin may not be vulnerable to <b>blowouts.</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{two touchdowns}} gave Virginia Tech a 28–13 halftime lead, and Indiana never seriously {{challenged}} the Hokies afterward. Both teams failed to {{score in the}} third quarter, but Virginia Tech added 17points {{in the fourth quarter}} to make the game a <b>blowout.</b> Indiana managed a touchdown {{toward the end of the}} game, but the end result had already been decided. Virginia Tech won the 1993 Independence Bowl, 45–20.|$|E
5|$|After the BCA Classic was canceled, Virginia Tech {{opened the}} regular season with a 5223 <b>blowout</b> win over Akron. This was {{followed}} by a 4528 win over East Carolina and a 490 shutout of Rutgers. The three wins typified the early part of Virginia Tech's schedule, which also featured wins against Boston College, Temple, West Virginia, Syracuse, and Pittsburgh. By virtue of winning its first eight games of the season, Tech rose to a No. 2 national ranking prior to facing No. 3 Miami on November 4.|$|E

50|$|Barren ground {{consists}} of open sand {{on the beaches}} and <b>blowouts.</b> Barren grounds are about 4% of the dunes areas and occur mostly along the beaches. Because of the scarcity of plants there are no permanent mammals living in the area. The normal process is for animals hunt {{on the beach at}} night. Some animals will live in the scattered clumps of plants that may remain or return to the <b>blowouts.</b> Evidence of animals in the barren areas is usually done through their tracks. Animals appear to go to the beach to feed and/or drink. In the <b>blowouts,</b> evidence of mammals is found near the clumps of grass (marrain grass and sea rocket).|$|R

30|$|Since {{isocyanate}} resin is expensive, {{the total}} cost of board production must be reduced. When using an air-injection press, {{it is not necessary to}} dry particles in advance, thereby reducing the cost [1]. Moreover, isocyanate resin releases carbon dioxide during hot pressing [6] and is more prone to <b>blowouts</b> than urea–formaldehyde resin [7]. Therefore, the air-injection press should also prove effective in preventing the <b>blowouts</b> of isocyanate resin bonded boards.|$|R

Against the Angels he threw his fastball as high as 88 miles per hour, threw a slider in the high 70s, and threw a cutter.

5|$|One of {{the keys}} to the game, {{according}} to ESPN.com blogger Matt Fortuna, was to stop the run. Both teams had 1,000+ yard rushers (Zach Line for SMU, Robbie Rouse for Fresno State), but SMU's rush defense (24th in FBS) was better than Fresno State's (73rd in FBS). Many analysts predicted that Fresno State would emerge victorious, some going as far as to predict a <b>blowout,</b> but said that for SMU to emerge victorious, they would have to win the field position battle as well as create turnovers.|$|E
5|$|Sanchez {{once again}} {{put up the}} only points for the offense in another humiliating <b>blowout,</b> this time a 45-14 loss to the Detroit Lions. Sanchez played {{relatively}} well, avoiding a 3-and-out on the first drive with a 5-yard scramble and managing {{to tie the game}} 7-7 with a touchdown pass to Brent Celek, but a defensive meltdown and lack of offensive momentum left the Eagles hopeless, and Sanchez finished his Eagles record with an 0-2 record as starter. Sanchez finished 19/27 for 199 yards with 2 touchdowns and no interceptions, which translated into a passer rating of 116.1.|$|E
5|$|Several Michigan {{school records}} were broken or tied in the <b>blowout</b> win.

Their 57-point win tied the second-biggest margin of victory for them since 1950, and tied for the eighth-largest margin of victory in school history. The 49 first half points was the team's second highest ever. The 28 point first quarter also tied a school record.
