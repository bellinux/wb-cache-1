30|$|In sum, our paper shows that, {{despite being}} {{associated}} with higher birth rates among relatively older women and with a higher prevalence of multiple <b>births,</b> infertility <b>insurance</b> {{does not have a}} statistically significant effect on women’s fertility {{at the end of their}} reproductive lives. The reason lies, as we further show, in the fact that infertility insurance mandates also appear to delay motherhood among relatively younger women and, hence, make conception more difficult because fecundity decreases with age.|$|R

We instrument education with a rich set of education policy variables. We find that mothers who complete high school {{are more likely to}} report their child was ill enough to need a doctor, that their child was ill more times, and that their child was more likely to have fractured or dislocated a bone in the past 12 months that required medical attention or treatment. Across samples of mothers who {{dropped out of high school}} and who completed high school, we find no difference in the date of their children’s last routine health checkup, percentiles for weight-for-age, height-for-age, BMI-for-age, or in the probability of children at risk of overweight and of being overweight. When we examined the possible mechanisms, we found that mother’s high school education increases mother’s age at child’s <b>birth,</b> health <b>insurance</b> coverage and child care use. We also find suggestive evidence of a much more complex set of behaviors that are causally related to education (child care use, health insurance status, fertility decisions) and that likely affect child health. This preliminary evidence suggests that much more work needs to be done before one can strongly conclude that child health does or does not systematically vary with differences in maternal education on the margin we study. ...|$|R
40|$|Background: Micro health {{insurance}} schemes {{have been implemented}} across developing countries {{as a means of}} facilitating access to modern medical care, with the ultimate aim of improving health. This effect, however, has not been explored sufficiently. Objective: We investigated the effect of enrolment into community-based {{health insurance}} on mortality in children under 5 years of age in a health and demographic surveillance system in Nouna, Burkina Faso. Design: We analysed the effect of health insurance enrolment on child mortality with a Cox regression model. We adjusted for variables that we found {{to be related to the}} enrolment in health insurance in a preceding analysis. Results: Based on the analysis of 33, 500 children, the risk of mortality was 46 % lower in children enrolled in health insurance as compared to the non-enrolled children (HR 0. 54, 95 % CI 0. 430. 68) after adjustment for possible confounders. We identified socioeconomic status, father’s education, distance to the health facility, year of <b>birth,</b> and <b>insurance</b> status of the mother at time of birth as the major determinants of health insurance enrolment. Conclusions: The strong effect of health insurance enrolment on child mortality may be explained by increased utilisation of health services by enrolled children; however, other non-observed factors cannot be excluded. Because malaria is a main cause of death in the study area, early consultation of health services in case of infection could prevent many deaths.

40|$|We {{study the}} effects of {{prenatal}} receipt of nutritional and educational services provided by the Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) on birth outcomes. Our identification strategy consists of two elements: (1) identifying families in a very tight income range surrounding the WIC eligibility threshold; and (2) exploiting a policy change that differentially influenced the WIC takeup rates of the families {{on each side of the}} eligibility threshold. We conduct this analysis by merging three large statewide administrative datasets from Florida concerning all births during the period 1997 - 2001. We match the birth records of infants and the school records of their older siblings in order to relatively precisely identify "marginally eligible" and "marginally ineligible" families that are very similar in their observable characteristics.

40|$|This paper views {{abortion}} {{access as}} {{an insurance policy}} that protects women from unwanted pregnancies. Within this framework, we present a theoretical model where greater access provides value {{in the form of}} <b>insurance</b> against unwanted <b>births</b> and also reduces the incentive to avoid pregnancy. This model predicts that legalized abortion should lead to a reduction in the likelihood of giving birth. It also predicts that if abortion access becomes relatively inexpensive (including both monetary and psychic costs), then pregnancies would rise and births would remain unchanged or may even rise as well. We review the evidence on the impact of changes in abortion policy mainly from the United States and find support for both predictions. Then we test these hypotheses using recent changes in abortion policy in several Eastern European countries. We find that countries which changed from very restrictive to liberal abortion laws experienced a large reduction in <b>births,</b> highlighting the <b>insurance</b> value. Changes from modest restrictions to abortion available upon request, however, led to no such change in births despite large increases in abortions, indicating that pregnancies rose as well.

We conducted a systematic review to identify neonatal databases, and define their characteristics. Methods We followed a preregistered protocol using MesH terms to search MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science and OVID Maternity and Infant Care Databases for articles identifying patient level databases covering more than one neonatal unit. Full-text articles were reviewed and information extracted on geographic coverage, criteria for inclusion, data source, and maternal and infant characteristics. Results We identified 82 databases from 2, 037 publications. Of the country specific databases there were 39 regional and 39 national. Sixty databases restricted entries to neonatal unit admissions by <b>birth</b> characteristic or <b>insurance</b> cover; 22 had no restrictions. Data were captured specifically for 53 databases; 21 administrative sources; 8 clinical sources. Two clinical databases hold the largest range of data on patient characteristics, USA’s Pediatrix BabySteps Clinical Data Warehouse and UK’s National Neonatal Research Database. Conclusion A number of neonatal databases exist that have potential to contribute to evaluating neonatal care. The majority are created by entering data specifically for the database, duplicating information likely already captured in other administrative and clinical patient records.

Methods: A cross-sectional survey of {{a random sample of}} 884 Queenslanders aged 40 - 80 years was conducted using a computer-assisted telephone interviewing system. The factors measured included socio-demographic characteristics, personal history of CRC, knowledge of others with CRC and perceived symptom status. Chi-squared and Monte Carlo estimates of Fisher Exact Tests were performed to determine the associations between socio-demographic factors and screening intention. In multivariate analyses, multinomial logistic regression (MNLR) was utilised to examine potential determinants of screening intention. Results: 77. 5 % (95 % CI 74. 0 %- 80. 7 %) of the respondents indicated their intention to participate in CRC screening if it were recommended by their doctor or health authorities. The likelihood ratio chi-squared tests in the MNLR analyses show that age (X= 15. 0; p= 0. 02), education (X= 19. 4; p= 0. 01), perceived symptom status (X= 22. 9; p= 0. 00), sex (X= 4. 5; p= 0. 11), income (X= 19. 6; p= 0. 14) and personal history of CRC (X= 4. 3; p= 0. 12) were potential determinants of screening intention. Other socio-demographic factors, including country of <b>birth,</b> private health <b>insurance</b> status, Socio-economic Index for Areas, and Rural and Remote Areas Classification codes, were not associated with screening intention. Conclusions and implications: The results indicate that a variety of socio-demographic factors are associated with screening intention and need to be considered in the future development of a population-based screening program for CRC...|$|R
40|$|Part 3 : What New Educational Management Information Systems Are Being Developed?International audienceThe Online Free School Meals (OFSM) project [1] is {{an example}} of {{transformation}} through information technology (IT) in local and central government. It brings together several central government departments in England, removes a bureaucratic process for the citizen, speeds up the process significantly, saves money, removes the stigma of benefit claim, and enables automatic audit and renewal [2]. The OFSM project was led by Connect Digitally, the team that introduced online school admissions across England [3]. The project brief was to develop a solution which would check parent/carer eligibility based on minimal criteria across the three central government databases which held the essential data, namely, Her Majesty’s Revenues and Customs (HMRC), the Home Office (HO) and the Department for Work and Pension (DWP). The project resulted in the Eligibility Checking Service (ECS, previously called the Hub) [4] which from three key data items – family name, date of <b>birth,</b> and National <b>Insurance</b> number (NINO) or National Asylum Support Service (NAAS) registration number - can deliver an immediate eligibility response in over 90 % [5] of applications via a web interface.

40|$|To {{assess the}} {{validity}} of self-reported maternal and infant health indicators reported by mothers an average of 4 months after delivery. Three validity measures-sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value (PPV) -were calculated for pregnancy history, pregnancy complications, health care utilization, and infant health indicators self-reported on the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) questionnaire by {{a representative sample of}} mothers delivering live births in New York City (NYC) (n = 603) and Vermont (n = 664) in 2009. Data abstracted from hospital records served as gold standards. All data were weighted to be representative of women delivering live births in NYC or Vermont during the study period. Most PRAMS indicators had > 90 % specificity. Indicators with > 90 % sensitivity and PPV for both sites included prior live birth, any diabetes, and Medicaid insurance at delivery, and for Vermont only, infant admission to the NICU and breastfeeding in the hospital. Indicators with poor sensitivity and PPV (< 70 %) for both sites (i. e., NYC and Vermont) included placenta previa and/or placental abruption, urinary tract infection or kidney infection, and for NYC only, preterm labor, prior low-birth-weight birth, and prior preterm birth. For Vermont only, receipt of an HIV test during pregnancy had poor sensitivity and PPV. Mothers accurately reported information on prior live <b>births</b> and Medicaid <b>insurance</b> at delivery; however, mothers' recall of certain pregnancy complications and pregnancy history was poor.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine {{attention}} in a large, representative, contemporary cohort of children born extremely preterm (EP) and/or extremely low birth weight (ELBW). Participants included 189 of 201 surviving children born EP (28 weeks' gestation) or ELBW (1, 000 g) in 1997 in the state of Victoria, Australia. A comparison group of 173 of 199 children born full term and normal birth weight (FT/NBW) were randomly selected matching for birth hospital, expected due date, gender, mother's country of <b>birth,</b> and health <b>insurance</b> status. Participants were assessed at 8 years of age on subtests from the Test of Everyday Attention for Children (TEA-Ch) and the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children- 4 th Edition (WISC-IV). Measures of selective attention, sustained attention, attention encoding, and executive attention (inhibition, shifting attention, and divided attention) were administered. To assess behavioral elements of inattention, the primary caregiver completed the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) and the Conners' ADHD/DSM-IV Scale (CADS-P). The EP/ELBW group performed more poorly across all cognitive and behavioral measures than the FT/NBW group, with the exception of inhibition. The EP/ELBW group also had significantly elevated rates of impairment in selective, sustained, shifting and divided attention, as well as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms. No significant gender or gradient effects (e. g., 26 weeks' gestation vs. epsilon 26 weeks' gestation) were identified. Neonatal medical factors were not strong predictors of attention, although necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and cystic periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) were independent predictors of selective attention. In conclusion, our comprehensive assessment of attention provides strong evidence that children born EP/ELBW are at increased risk for attentional impairments, and as such, this population should be monitored closely during early and middle childhood with a focus on attention functioning...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Up to 5 % of {{patients}} presenting {{to the emergency}} department (ED) four or more times within a 12 month period represent 21 % of total ED visits. In this study we sought to characterize social and medical vulnerability factors of ED frequent users (FUs) and to explore if these factors hold simultaneously. METHODS: We performed a case-control study at Lausanne University Hospital, Switzerland. Patients over 18 years presenting to the ED at least once within the study period (April 2008 toMarch 2009) were included. FUs were defined as patients with four or more ED visits within the previous 12 months. Outcome data were extracted from medical records of the first ED attendance within the study period. Outcomes included basic demographics and social variables, ED admission diagnosis, somatic and psychiatric days hospitalized over 12 months, and having a primary care physician. We calculated the percentage of FUs and non-FUs having at least one social and one medical vulnerability factor. The four chosen social factors included: unemployed and/or dependence on government welfare, institutionalized and/or without fixed residence, either separated, divorced or widowed, and under guardianship. The fourmedical vulnerability factors were: ≥ 6 somatic days hospitalized, ≥ 1 psychiatric days hospitalized, ≥ 5 clinical departments used (all three factors measured over 12 months), and ED admission diagnosis of alcohol and/or drug abuse. Univariate and multivariate logistical regression analyses allowed comparison of two JGIM ABSTRACTS S 391 random samples of 354 FUs and 354 non-FUs (statistical power 0. 9, alpha 0. 05 for all outcomes except gender, country of <b>birth,</b> and <b>insurance</b> type). RESULTS: FUs accounted for 7. 7 % of ED patients and 24. 9 % of ED visits. Univariate logistic regression showed that FUs were older (mean age 49. 8 vs. 45. 2 yrs, p= 0. 003),more often separated and/or divorced (17. 5 %vs. 13. 9 %, p= 0. 029) or widowed (13. 8 % vs. 8. 8 %, p= 0. 029), and either unemployed or dependent on government welfare (31. 3 % vs. 13. 3 %, p< 0. 001), compared to non-FUs. FUs cumulated more days hospitalized over 12 months (mean number of somatic days per patient 1. 0 vs. 0. 3, p< 0. 001; mean number of psychiatric days per patient 0. 12 vs. 0. 03, p< 0. 001). The two groups were similar regarding gender distribution (females 51. 7 % vs. 48. 3 %).

FUs were more likely to need medical care, as indicated by involvement of≥ 5 clinical departments over 12 months (OR 6. 2; 95 %CI, 3. 74 to 10. 15), having an ED admission diagnosis of substance abuse (OR 3. 23; 95 % CI, 1. 23 to 8. 46) and having a primary care physician (OR 1. 70; 95 %CI, 1. 13 to 2. 56); however, they were less likely to present with an admission diagnosis of injury (OR 0. 64; 95 % CI, 0. 40 to 1. 00) compared to non-FUs.

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} ADRN {{and data}} collection copyright owner. Background Supporting People is a local implemented programme with funding provided via top tier local authorities Formula Grant allocation from April 2011. Supporting People enables vulnerable people to live independently through the provision of housing related support. Each top-tier local authority in England (of which there are 152) is responsible for commissioning any Supporting People services in their area and it is delivered largely by the voluntary and community sector and housing associations. Providers of housing related support are requested to complete a Client Record form every time a client starts to receive their service. Supporting People helps around one million people at any one time, including people who are homeless, with mental health problems, leaving care, at risk of domestic violence, or older with support needs. Data is recorded about clients who use housing-related support services to help understand the impact that it makes. &# 160; There are three separate Supporting People datasets in total. The Client Records dataset records information about the client {{at the point of}} starting housing related support. The Outcomes for Short-term services dataset records information about the client when they leave short-term support services (defined as less than two years in duration). The Outcomes for Long-term services dataset records information about the client who is receiving support services for two or more years in duration and it is collected on a sample basis. The Client Records & Outcomes Office has a dedicated website where anyone can log on as a visitor and use the web reporting facility to analyse data, as well as being able to view publications and articles that have used the Supporting People data. The Dataset The Supporting People Client Records dataset records information about the client at the point that they start using a Supporting People service. Information is collected by the service provider about both the nature of the service that they provide and the client receiving the support. Client information includes economic status, ethnicity, religion, client group, homelessness status, accommodation, National Insurance Number and if they are subject to requirements under an Anti-Social Behaviour Order. Whilst completion of the Client Record Forms is not mandatory, service providers may be required to complete them as part of contractual arrangements with their commissioning Administering Authority. Data was collected across all Administering Authority areas in England from 2003 / 4 to 2010 / 11, providing on average 200, 000 Client Records per year to the Supporting People Client Record and Outcomes Office; and from April 2011 includes information only from participating Administering Authorities that contracted directly with the Centre for Housing Research at the University of St Andrews, e. g. 145, 000 records in 2011 / 12. &# 160; Data derived from Client Records provide information to authorities, locating the routes by which Supporting People services are being accessed and the personal characteristics of service users. This information is essential for monitoring, reviewing and planning services in order to extend and refine the range of support provision {{to meet the needs of}} vulnerable groups and widen access. Each participating Administering Authority receives a complete dataset of Client Record information about their service providers. This enables them to analyse data from individual services. Central funding from the DCLG for the collection of Supporting People data ceased on the 31 st March 2011. From the 1 st April 2011 individual Administering Authorities have responsibility for the collection of data. The Centre for Housing Research continues to collect data from those authorities who wish to record this information with them. The Supporting People Client Records dataset started on the 1 st April 2003. People who started receiving support before this date are not included in the dataset. Data is provided by support providers throughout the year (1 st April to 31 st March) to the Client Record & Outcomes Office. The information is validated and processed and data updates are released on an annual basis (provisionally October). The dataset covers support providers in local authorities in England. A different system is operated in Scotland, which is administered by the Scottish Government, in Wales, which is administered by the Welsh Government, and also in Northern Ireland, which is administered by the Northern Ireland Housing Executive. Client Records data is based on the number of forms received from service providers and does not necessarily correspond to the total number of clients accessing Supporting People services within any given period. Data is checked and validated by quality assessors. Validation is carried out according to a set list of detectable errors. Error rates are monitored and where problems with the data are detected this is handled accordingly upon publication. Appropriate caution should be used when analysing this information and researchers should consult the Client Records Guidance Manual. For example, the Client Records form allows a client to be classified using one primary group and up to three secondary groups. The primary client group should describe what is identified by the service provider as the predominant need or circumstances of the client. There have been changes to the information recorded in the form over time, including the addition of new questions. In some cases categories within existing questions have been added, amended or removed. The question that has been altered most often is the one about the homeless status of the client. Please note that the Client Record dataset does not record any personal identifiers, such as the client’s name or date of <b>birth.</b> Although National <b>Insurance</b> Number information is collected, it is not available under the existing conditions of data collection agreed by the Department for Work and Pensions. Its purpose is to enable the Client Records and Outcomes Office to perform analysis on patterns of service use over time and across services and geographical areas. A new Client Records form is completed each time a person enters a housing-related support service. Therefore please be aware that someone can access several services or one service several times in any given period. The client records dataset covers people who receive the following support services&# 58; Supported housing Residential care homes (in receipt of SP / housing related support funding) Adult placements Supported lodgings Women’s refuge Foyer Teenage parent accommodation Direct access accommodation Floating support services Outreach services Resettlement services. It does not cover the following support services&# 58; Very sheltered housing Sheltered housing with warden support Alms-house Peripatetic warden services Leasehold scheme Home Improvement Agencies (HIA) Community alarm services. Anonymised data has been deposited at the UK Data Archive for 2003 / 4 to 2010 / 11 data. There is a web reporting facility freely available to all users on the Supporting People project website – this provides access to data from 2003 onwards. Research Usage and Linkage The main use of the Client Records data is to monitor access and effectiveness of Supporting People services and to examine whether the range of support needs in a particular area are being met. It can also be used by Administering Authorities working together to coordinate services regionally. The Department for Communities and Local Government used the data to report nationally on access to Supporting People services and assist in the on-going evidence base to demonstrate the value of housing related support services. And local government continues to use this data for monitoring and planning. A variety of research publications are available on the Client Record and Outcomes website covering different client groups, employment, geographical movement of clients and successful outcomes. The Supporting People Outcomes for Short-term services dataset can be linked to the Supporting People Client Records dataset using unique identifiers and other variables. This analysis at two different points in time can investigate the effectiveness and influence of support on a person’s wellbeing. </div...|$|R
