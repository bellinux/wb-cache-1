500|$|The match {{attracted}} fervent debate amongst journalists, pundits {{and football}} players alike. Former referee Jeff Winter defended Riley's performance and described fixtures between Manchester United and Arsenal as [...] "impossible" [...] to manage. Premier League refereeing chief Keith Hackett added: [...] "We {{know this is}} one of the tough encounters of the season. Mike clearly had a game plan to try not to suppress the match. He wanted it to breathe and perhaps went in with the intention of getting through the game without having to dismiss any players. In the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> was trying to get through a game without having a blow-up and I think Mike did extremely well to keep a lid on things." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the liner}} notes to the 2003 remastered {{version of the}} album, lead singer Ian McCulloch said that he {{constantly}} had the American rock band The Velvet Underground's song [...] "What Goes On" [...] in the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind.</b> He also stated that the band wanted to record a soul album. In the same liner notes, bassist Les Pattinson said that the band was often lazy and hence had hired rehearsal space at the Ministry in Liverpool. He said this made them work harder and develop [...] "language" [...] in the rhythm. According to guitarist Will Sergeant, McCulloch considers Heaven Up Here to be Sergeant's album because he was bossy and a control freak during the recording.|$|E
500|$|Mahone's {{anxiety is}} evident when {{he reaches for}} the varatril pills hidden inside his pen. When Mahone runs out of pills, he is tense and easily agitated. Fichtner notes the erratic {{behavior}} of his character, commenting, [...] "The more twisted the better! Who wants to play a straight-away FBI guy?" [...] He says that the actions that Mahone takes are affected by [...] "some of the things that Mahone has {{in the back of his}} closet—and in the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind,</b> the voices he is hearing about his own life." [...] Andy Dehnart of MSNBC observes that Mahone, [...] "as played by William Fichtner, always seemed to be on the edge of a nervous breakdown." ...|$|E

500|$|In a 1980 {{interview}} with Playboy magazine, John Lennon expressed his {{doubts about the}} notion of [...] "subconscious" [...] plagiarism, saying: [...] "He must have known, you know. He's smarter than that... He could have changed a couple of bars in that song and nobody could ever have touched him, but he {{just let it go}} and paid the price. Maybe he thought God would just sort of let him off." [...] Ringo Starr's reaction was more charitable: [...] "There's no doubt that the tune is similar but how many songs have been written with other melodies in mind? George's version is much heavier than The Chiffons – he might have done it with the original in the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind,</b> but he's just very unlucky that someone wanted to make it a test case in court." ...|$|E
500|$|Although Scott had {{accepted}} the job Demme had rejected, he said: [...] "My first question was: 'What about Jonathan?' and they said: 'The original team said it's too violent.' I said, 'Okay. I'll do it.'" [...] Scott did, himself, have some uncertainty with the source material. In particular, he had difficulties with {{the ending of the}} novel, in which Lecter and Starling become lovers: [...] "I couldn't take that quantum leap emotionally on behalf of Starling. Certainly, on behalf of Hannibal—I'm sure that's been in the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> for a number of years. But for Starling, no. I think one of the attractions about Starling to Hannibal is what a straight arrow she is." [...] He also [...] "didn't buy the book from the opera scene onwards, which became like a vampire movie." [...] He asked Harris if he was [...] "married to his ending". Harris said he was not, so Scott changed it.|$|E
500|$|Although {{this was}} his 12th {{published}} novel, Irving said that Last Night in Twisted River was [...] "20 years in the making". The idea for a novel about a cook and his son on the run {{had been in the}} <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> for as long ago as 1986. Irving, who likes to start his novels with the last sentence, {{said in an interview with}} The Independent in October 2009: [...] "For the longest time the last sentence eluded me, but 20 years ago I imagined a novel about a cook and his young son who become fugitives; who have to run from some violent act that will follow them. And it was always in a kind of frontier town — a place where there was one law, and it was one man, who was single-minded and bad." [...] Irving did not start writing the novel until 2005. Speaking to the BBC World Service in October 2009, Irving explained that he found that last sentence on his way to a doctor's appointment. He said an old Bob Dylan CD was playing [...] "Tangled Up in Blue" [...] in his car, and when he heard the lyrics: ...|$|E
5000|$|Jim Carrey portrays The Riddler in the 1995 filmBatman Forever. In this version, Edward Nygma is an {{employee}} of Wayne Enterprises who invents a device called [...] "The Box", that transmits images directly into the user's mind. Nygma sees it as {{the next generation of}} television, but Bruce Wayne rejects the idea, as mental manipulation raises [...] "too many questions". Nygma ultimately discovers that his device can drain people of their intellect to increase his own intelligence. After killing his supervisor, he dons the [...] "Riddler" [...] identity, allies himself with Two-Face and steals vast amounts of money and jewels to fund his own company, Nygmatech, and mass-produce his invention. The devices transfer the stolen information to a gigantic Mother Box on Claw Island, where it is planted in the Riddler's mind. In the process, he learns that Wayne is Batman. He and Two-Face raid Wayne Manor, destroy the Batcave, and kidnap Batman's love interest, Dr. Chase Meridian, and his new crimefighting partner Robin. In the film's climactic scene, Batman destroys the Mother Box causing the intelligence Riddler stole and even the intelligence he originally had to be siphoned <b>back</b> out <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> driving him insane. Riddler is locked up in Arkham Asylum where he believes that he himself is Batman when visited by Dr. Meridian.|$|R
6000|$|Cyril Waring, thus dismissed, and as in honour bound, hurried up to London with a mind preoccupied by many {{pressing}} {{doubts and}} misgivings. He thought much of Elma, {{but he thought}} much, too, of sundry strange events that had happened <b>of</b> late to <b>his</b> own private fortunes. For one thing he had sold, and sold mysteriously, at a very good price, the picture of Sardanapalus in the glade at Chetwood. A well-known London dealer had written down to him at Tilgate making an excellent offer for the unfinished work, {{as soon as it}} should be ready, on behalf of a customer whose name he didn't happen to mention. And who could that customer be, Cyril thought to himself, but Colonel Kelmscott? But that wasn't all. The dealer who had offered him a round sum down for [...] "The Rajah's Rest" [...] had also at the same time commissioned him to go over to the Belgian Ardennes to paint a picture or two, at a specified price, of certain selected scenes upon the Meuse and its tributaries. The price offered for the work was a very respectable one, and yet--he had some internal misgivings, somehow, about this mysterious commission. Could it be to get rid of him? He had an uncomfortable suspicion in the <b>back</b> chambers <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind,</b> that whoever had commissioned the pictures might be more anxious to send him well away from Tilgate than to possess a series of picturesque sketches on the Meuse and its tributaries.|$|R
60|$|Up to {{this point}} he had behaved not only with so much spirit, but with so much reason, that his wife began to hope that the {{importance}} of the occasion had brought <b>back</b> the clearness <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind,</b> and that he would, even now, be able to place himself right as the inquiry went on. Then it was explained that Mr. Crawley had stated that the cheque had been given to him by Dean Arabin, {{as soon as it was}} shown that it could not have been given to him by Mr. Soames. In reference to this, Mr. Walker was obliged to explain that application had been made to the dean, who was abroad, and that the dean had stated that he had given fifty pounds to his friend. Mr. Walker explained also that the very notes of which this fifty pounds had consisted had been traced back to Mr. Crawley, and that they had had no connection with the cheque or with the money which had been given for the cheque at the bank.|$|R
500|$|Over {{the course}} of the show (roughly 8 years), Monk overcomes many of his phobias and some aspects of his OCD. Though he hasn't been cured of many of them, if any at all, {{he has been able to}} put them in the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> when {{involved}} in case work. His most notable breakthrough is shown in the season 8 episode [...] "Mr. Monk Goes to Group Therapy", when Adrian is locked in a car trunk with his fellow OCD patient and personal rival, Harold Krenshaw. During the terrifying trip, both men overcome their longstanding case of claustrophobia (fear of small spaces), as well as their own differences, resulting in them becoming friends. Possibly due to this, as well as the many cases Monk has solved over the years, he is reinstated as detective first class by Stottlemeyer in the season 8 episode [...] "Mr. Monk and the Badge". Though he is very excited about his reinstatement initially, Monk realizes that becoming a detective again didn't mean that he would be happier. In a session with Dr. Bell, Monk realizes he was always happy as a private detective and consultant to the SFPD as his own boss. After overcoming his fear of heights and singlehandedly capturing a killer window-washer, Monk turns in his badge. In the series finale, he learns that his late wife, Trudy, had given birth to a daughter before they had met. The knowledge and events of the episode lead to positive changes in his personality.|$|E
