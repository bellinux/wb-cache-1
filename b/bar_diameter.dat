50|$|With the {{exception}} of the “BUR Quick Change” set, standard plate sizing was the norm. BUR did not manufacture Olympic bars or Olympic-sized plates. The original BUR-BEL plates had a center hole diameter of 1-1/4” and were designed to fit a 1-1/16” bar.

40|$|The force {{transfer}} between concrete and reinforcement {{depends on the}} bond characteristics between the two materials. Bond influences crack widths and the deflections of RC members and also determines anchorage and splice lengths. Self-compacting concrete (SCC) {{is characterized by a}} smaller amount of coarse aggregates when compared to conventional vibrated concrete. To investigate whether this change in mix design has a significant influence on the bond behaviour, a series of beam tests (according to RILEM recommendation RC 6) was performed. A total of 36 specimens were cast using 3 different concrete types: one conventional vibrated concrete (CVC) and two powder-type SCC's. The bond stress-slip behaviour of reinforcing <b>bars</b> with <b>diameters</b> ranging from 12 to 40 mm has been recorded. From these tests, it can be concluded that the bond strength of SCC is even higher than it is for CVC for small <b>bar</b> <b>diameters,</b> but the difference becomes smaller for larger <b>bar</b> <b>diameters...</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{reinforced}} concrete structures, understanding the bond mechanism {{is of great}} importance for the design (anchorage lengths, load bearing capacity, crack width, [...] .). Therefore this phenomenon has widely been studied for conventional vibrated concrete. For self-compacting concrete (SCC) however few test results are available and in practice the standards for conventional vibrated concrete (CVC) are applied to self-compacting concrete as well. To fill in this lack of knowledge and to develop adapted standards for predicting the bond of reinforcement in SCC, an experimental program has been set up. The bond strength of reinforcement <b>bars</b> with different <b>diameters</b> has been tested for 1 conventional vibrated concrete and 2 self-compacting concretes. The testing method, by means of "beam-test" specimen, was based on RILEM RC 6 part 1. During testing the free end slip of the bars and the applied load were recorded. The <b>bar</b> <b>diameters</b> ranged from 12 mm tot 40 mm. From the test results {{it can be seen}} that the maximum and characteristic bond strength of self-compacting concrete is as high as for conventional vibrated concrete, or even slightly higher. The bond strength decreases however for increasing <b>bar</b> <b>diameters,</b> and the decrease seems to be a little larger for specimen made of SCC. The slip corresponding with the maximum bond strength increases for increasing <b>bar</b> <b>diameters...</b>|$|R

The {{objective of this}} work is to study columns exposed to fire under axial load and to evaluate reduction in column compressive capacity after fire. The {{first part of this}} research is experimental investigation of fifteen-column specimens (15 × 15 × 100) cm exposed except one specimen to (600 °C) fire. The second part is a theoretical analysis performed using three-dimensional nonlinear finite element program.

5000|$|Ford {{celebrated the}} Mustang's 20th Anniversary in 1984 by issuing a limited-edition GT model under the {{designation}} GT-350. The GT-350 name {{had not been}} used since the last Shelby Mustang was produced in 1970. The GT-350 could be ordered in either a hatchback or convertible body style driven by either the high-performance 302cid V8 or the 140cid Turbo four. All came in white with special stripes and lettering while inside, SVO style seats were {{a feature of the}} all red interior. The 1984 20th anniversary edition GT sported a whole new look for Mustang, including the white monochromatic paint scheme and bold [...] "GT-350" [...] Striping. These Stripes are very reminiscent of the classic Shelby Mustangs Produced in the 1960s.One big mechanical revision for the Anniversary Mustang involved the GT's suspension. This revision was introduced as a running change early in 1984 to ALL GT Mustangs. The rear control arm pivot points were lowered 1/2-inch on the upper end and 1/4-inch on the lower end for improved suspension geometry. In addition, quad shocks replaced the old-style traction bars and the rear anti-roll <b>bar</b> <b>diameter</b> increased to 0.79 in compared to 0.67 in in 1983.Another newcomer in 1984 was the introduction of an Automatic Over Drive (AOD) Transmission. This combination could only be purchased with a 302 utilizing a Throttle Body Fuel Injection (TBI) system, also called Central Fuel Injection(CFI). The optional 165 horsepower (123 kW) 5.0L engine with CFI and the 4-speed AOD transmission package was offered with a 3.27:1 axle ratio. The [...] 4V version carried over from 1983 was available only with a T-5 manual transmission. The 4V 5-speed was available with a 3.08:1 axle ratio.
