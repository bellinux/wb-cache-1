5|$|A {{second phase}} of {{building}} and upgrades started in 1908 {{which resulted in the}} prominent architecture visible at Fort Yellowstone in the 21st century. Built from locally quarried sandstone, these buildings defined Fort Yellowstone. The most prominent of the structures built in the later period is the Horace Albright Visitor Center which was originally the bachelor officers' quarters (Bldg 1). Each historic building in the fort and the park was assigned an official number, with the original bachelor officers' quarters being <b>building</b> <b>number</b> 1. Architects Reed and Stem and Robert Reamer along with the U.S. Army Office of the Chief Quartermaster, Department of Dakota participated in the design of many of the facilities. Engineer facilities and landscaping were designed by Captain Hiram M. Chittenden of the U.S. Corps of Engineers.|$|E
5|$|The {{plant was}} laid out roughly north to south {{orientation}} along the Thames River. The plant itself {{is a mixture of}} interconnected buildings and stand-alone structures. The stand-alone structures included three propane sheds (Buildings 63, 64 and 65) that were located near the Human Resources building (Building 86) and its storage shed (Building 30). The main structure of the plant was a string of connecting buildings that were erected and integrated into the production and operation of the plant. At {{the north end of the}} plant was the Research and Development building (Building 87), it was located connected to two large storage buildings (Building 1 and 2). On the front of Building 2 was the main offices (Building 85). Building 2 is connected to the largest building, the Manufacturing Building (Building 3), which is connected to the Manufacturing Glass House (Building 5) and Glass House 2 (Building 32). Building 32 also served as storage building. Connected to Building 5 is the Glass House Cullet & Mix House (Number 7) and the Compressor & Auxiliary Generator <b>building</b> (<b>Number</b> 9) at the southern end.|$|E
25|$|Buildings at OCAD are {{referred}} to by their street addresses. Some buildings are also assigned a <b>building</b> <b>number</b> that is encoded as the first digit in 4-digit room numbers.|$|E
50|$|One {{aspect of}} Rockville Pike that confuses many motorists {{is the system}} of {{assigning}} <b>building</b> <b>numbers.</b> In unincorporated areas of the county, <b>building</b> <b>numbers</b> are assigned according to the addressing system in use in Montgomery County, a Cartesian coordinate plane with its origin at the United States Capitol. Within the city limits of Rockville, however, {{the origin of the}} numbering system {{is at the center of}} Rockville. Thus, someone driving north on the Pike sees <b>building</b> <b>numbers</b> above 12000 and rising, which suddenly give way to <b>building</b> <b>numbers</b> below 2000 and falling.|$|R
25|$|The {{addressing}} system in Alexandria is not uniform and reflects {{the consolidation of}} several originally separate communities into a single city. In Old Town Alexandria, <b>building</b> <b>numbers</b> are assigned north and south from King Street and west (only) from the Potomac River. In the areas formerly {{in the town of}} Potomac, such as Del Ray and St. Elmo, <b>building</b> <b>numbers</b> are assigned east and west from Commonwealth Avenue and north (only) from King Street. In the western parts of the city, <b>building</b> <b>numbers</b> are assigned north and south from Duke Street.|$|R

25|$|Residents and {{businesses}} identify their locations mostly by <b>building</b> <b>number,</b> and occasionally {{by the name}} of a prominent structure. Residents know where in the city certain series of building numbers are located; numbers tend to be aggregated in blocks, so someone might say that they live in the 2600s. Around 2003, street names were developed, although there were delays in finalizing them and posting the signs. Street numbers have not been assigned, and building numbers continue to be used. Iqaluit is the only Canadian capital city not to have traffic signals.|$|E
25|$|On September 4, 1956 {{the base}} high school officially opened in <b>building</b> <b>number</b> T-394, the old {{elementary}} school building. In 1958, {{the same year}} that Stephenville received its first traffic light and television celebrated its first birthday, Harmon High established its own newspaper, The Harmon Highlight. In June 1960 the elementary school was located to a building with large play areas for the children. There were 29 elementary teachers and Mrs. Anna Barnett was the secretary. Joseph C. McCormack was the high school principal in 1961 and Mr. Harvey Bodiford was the superintendent of both Harmon and Goose Bay US military schools with his main office at Goose Bay.|$|E

She was launched on 5 June 1909, and after fitting-out was completed, she was commissioned into the fleet on 16 June 1911. Augsburg was ordered as Ersatz [...] from the Kaiserliche Werft shipyard in Kiel. Her keel was laid in 1908 under <b>building</b> <b>number</b> 34. She was launched on 10 July 1909 and was commissioned into the fleet on 1 October 1910. She returned to the Kaiserliche Werft shipyard in Kiel for her modernization in 19161917.|$|E
500|$|During {{the design}} process, the ship's weight {{continued}} to grow due {{to the increase in}} the size of the citadel, armor thickness, the additions to the ammunition stores, and the rearrangement of the boiler system. The naval arms race between Germany and Britain put a great deal of stress on the Navy design staff, and prompted the decision to build two ships of the new design. They were assigned under the contract names of [...] "Cruiser G" [...] and [...] "Cruiser H." [...] Blohm & Voss received both contracts in 1908; [...] "Cruiser G" [...] was assigned to the 1908–1909 building year, while [...] "Cruiser H" [...] was assigned to 1909–1910. The contract for [...] "Cruiser G" [...] was awarded on 17 September 1908, under <b>building</b> <b>number</b> 200. The keel was laid on 7 December 1908, and the ship was launched on 7 April 1910.

500|$|Numbers 22–25 Regency Square—at the {{northwest}} corner of the square on a short road leading to Preston Street—include the <b>building</b> (<b>number</b> 67) on the corner of that street, which absorbed the house built as number 21 Regency Square. [...] Attributed to Amon and Amon Henry Wilds, these bow-fronted terraced houses were built in about 1818. [...] Number 67 Preston Street is of three storeys and has a shopfront facing west into that street; alongside that is a porch with rusticated decoration and an arched doorway. [...] The Regency Square (south) façade has blocked windows at first- and second-floor level. [...] The four houses facing Regency Square are of three storeys, except number 25 which also has an attic storey. [...] They are of brick faced with painted stucco. [...] Each house has a chimney on its slate roof. [...] Each has an entrance staircase with iron railings, a rusticated ground floor, a single bay window to each storey, an iron balcony at first-floor level, a cornice and a parapet in front of the roof. [...] At numbers 22 to 24, dormer windows cut through the parapet.|$|E

2500|$|To {{identify}} a particular room within a building, the room number is simply appended to the <b>building</b> <b>number,</b> using a [...] "-" [...] (e.g. Room 26–100, [...] a large first-floor auditorium in Building 26). [...] The floor number is {{indicated in the}} usual way, by the leading digit(s) of the room number, with a leading digit 0 indicating a basement location.|$|E
25|$|The slash is {{sometimes}} {{used as an}} abbreviation for <b>building</b> <b>numbers.</b> For example, in some contexts, 8/A Evergreen Gardens specifies Apartment 8 in Building A of the residential complex Evergreen Gardens. In the United States, however, such an address refers to the first division of Apartment 8 and is simply a variant of Apartment 8A or 8-A. Similarly in the United Kingdom, an address such as 12/2 Anywhere Road means flat (or apartment) 2 in the <b>building</b> <b>numbered</b> 12 on Anywhere Road.|$|R

2500|$|The {{practice}} of identifying buildings by number is a long-standing tradition at MIT. [...] Although sometimes ridiculed {{as evidence of}} an [...] "engineering mindset", and referred to as [...] "a system that disorients outsiders", this system is somewhat logical, and allows members of the MIT community to quickly locate a room they may never have seen before. [...] This numbering system contrasts with the building identification at other nearby colleges. [...] For example, at Harvard University, knowing the location of [...] "Maxwell-Dworkin" [...] will not help in locating [...] "Claverson" [...] or [...] "Larsen" [...] — {{no matter how many}} years of experience one may have, one either knows these locations or has no idea where they may be. [...] Under the MIT numbering scheme, community members will know approximately where Building NW95 must be, even if they have never been near there. [...] Using the MIT <b>building</b> <b>number</b> system, students can even extrapolate a <b>building</b> <b>number</b> for a fanciful future annexation of Cambridge City Hall.|$|E
