5|$|By early 1916, the British {{blockade}} of Germany was <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{an effect on}} Germany and her imports. The Royal Navy had stopped and seized more cargo destined for Germany than the quantity of cargo sunk by German U-boats in the first submarine offensive. As a result, the German Imperial Navy began a second offensive against merchant shipping on 29 February. The final ground rules agreed upon by the German Admiralstab were that all enemy vessels in Germany's self-proclaimed war zone would be destroyed without warning, that enemy vessels outside the war zone would be destroyed only if armed, and—to avoid antagonizing the United States—that enemy passenger steamers {{were not to be}} attacked, regardless of whether in the war zone or not.|$|E
5|$|Richardson's Pamela, the {{prototype}} for the sentimental novel, is a didactic love {{story with a}} happy ending, written at a time women were <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{the right to choose}} husbands and yet were restricted by social conventions. Austen attempted Richardson's epistolary style, but found the flexibility of narrative more conducive to her realism, a realism in which each conversation and gesture carries a weight of significance. The narrative style utilises free indirect speech – she was the first English novelist to do so extensively – through which she had the ability to present a character's thoughts directly to the reader and yet still retain narrative control. The style allows an author to vary discourse between the narrator's voice and values and those of the characters.|$|E
5|$|To the Milanese, Sforza's victory {{now seemed}} certain, {{but he found}} his Venetian allies <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> doubts about their Captain-General. They decided that Milan run by Sforza {{would be far more}} {{dangerous}} and detrimental to their interests than if it were run by a weak Republic. The last of the territory claimed by Venice, namely Crema, was now captured. Venice went behind Sforza's back and signed a peace treaty with the Republic. They conceded conquered land to the Republic in return for peace, and let Sforza keep only Pavia, Cremona, Piacenza, and a narrow strip of land. They ordered him to accept the treaty or find Venice his enemy. The Republic rejoiced, and the citizens were confident the war was over and their future was secured. But Sforza could not accept the conditions of the treaty, and decided to persevere in the struggle. He was already very powerful, and moreover was close to Milan. The Milanese in their assurance of peace had nearly exhausted their resources to plant crops and return to the old way of life. He was confident that Milan would quickly fall to him. After reinforcing his peace with Savoy with the concession of a few unimportant castles, he defeated the Venetians under his rival Sigismondo Malatesta and continued the siege.|$|E

25|$|At {{the same}} time of Eysenck's work, B. F. Skinner and his {{associates}} were <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> an impact with their work on operant conditioning. Skinner's work {{was referred to as}} radical behaviorism and avoided anything related to cognition. However, Julian Rotter, in 1954, and Albert Bandura, in 1969, contributed behavior therapy with their respective work on social learning theory, by demonstrating the effects of cognition on learning and behavior modification.|$|E
25|$|The Liberal {{government}} {{came close}} to falling when testimony from the Gomery Commission caused public opinion to move sharply against the government. The Bloc Québécois were eager from the <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> an early election. The Conservatives announced they had also lost confidence in the government's moral authority. Thus, during much of spring 2005, there was a widespread belief that the Liberals would lose a confidence vote, prompting an election {{taking place in the}} spring or summer of 2005.|$|E

25|$|The vast wealth {{generated}} by oil revenues was <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{an even greater}} impact on Saudi society. It led to rapid technological (but not cultural) modernisation, urbanization, mass public education {{and the creation of}} new media. This and the presence of increasingly large numbers of foreign workers greatly affected traditional Saudi norms and values. Although there was dramatic change in the social and economic life of the country, political power continued to be monopolized by the royal family leading to discontent among many Saudis who began to look for wider participation in government.|$|E
25|$|During the 1920s {{complaints}} about {{the performance of the}} gun started coming in to the authorities. Wear and tear was <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> an effect on the guns, and soon people were suggesting that the type should be replaced with a new field gun model. The demands for a new artillery system was rejected, and instead the old guns were sent to a full maintenance overhaul. The maintenance solved the problems with the Model 1901, some guns also being fitted with rubber tires and rebuilt for motor transport during the 1930s. By 1940 at least 12 artillery pieces had been modified for motor transport. Until 9 April 1940 German invasion of Norway the gun remained the main field gun of the Norwegian Army.|$|E
25|$|In 971 the new Fatimid Caliphate {{entered the}} scene. With newly found zeal, the Fatimids took Egypt, Palestine, {{and much of}} Syria from the {{powerless}} Abbasids, who were <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> their own Turkic problems. Having defeated their Islamic opponents, the Fatimids {{saw no reason to}} stop at Antioch and Aleppo, cities {{in the hands of the}} Christian Byzantines, making their conquest more important. A failed attack on Antioch in 971 was followed up by a Byzantine defeat outside of Amida. However, John I Tzimiskes would prove to be a greater foe than Nikephoros. With 10,000 Armenian troops and other levies he pushed south, relieving the Imperial possessions there and threatening Baghdad with an invasion. His reluctance to invade the Abbasid Capital, though poorly defended and demoralized, remains a mystery.|$|E

The movement spread over Pomerania and, via immigration, to the United States, where it developed {{into what is}} now the Pentecostal movement.|$|R
25|$|For the 2004 season, Carr {{turned to}} highly rated recruit Chad Henne {{to lead the}} Wolverines at quarterback. Michigan went 9–3 to tie for another Big Ten {{championship}} and earn {{a trip to the}} 2005 Rose Bowl, but the season again included a loss to Ohio State, who only went 8–4 on the season. Carr, who had started off with a stellar record against Cooper's Ohio State, seemed to have much more trouble beating Tressel's version of the Buckeyes. In addition, Michigan was <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a reputation for struggling with the spread offense, with teams such as the Purdue Boilermakers led by Drew Brees in 2000, the Oregon Ducks in 2003, and the Texas Longhorns led by Vince Young in the 2005 Rose Bowl all putting many points on Lloyd Carr's defense.|$|E
25|$|Andromeda is {{put to work}} {{developing}} a program to enable Britain to intercept orbital missiles which a foreign power is firing over British airspace as a demonstration of power. Using the missiles designed by Andromeda, they are successful in destroying one of the missiles. The Government is now determined to make full use of Andromeda, not just for defence but also to aid industry. Fleming continues to make trouble and has his access to the computer revoked. He is horrified {{to discover that the}} Government has made a trade deal with Kaufmann and Intel for the rights to a new enzyme that Andromeda has developed that heals injured cells. By this stage, Dawnay is also <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> doubts about Andromeda – she agrees to aid Fleming by entering a program into the computer to convince it Andromeda is dead. The program is quickly discovered and reversed by Andromeda. However, the computer soon exacts its revenge – it corrupts the formula for the enzyme, making Dawnay and her assistants sick.|$|E

500|$|Taking heavy {{fire from}} both the front and flanks, Williams {{had little choice but}} to withdraw. With the Viet Cong moving rapidly to {{encircle}} them, and unable to move forward, the Australians had to fight using small arms fire and grenades to extract themselves back to company headquarters without further casualties. However, by this time the artillery was <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> an impact as A Company's forward observer, Captain Bruce Murphy, a New Zealander, directed the fires. The Australians had unavoidably been placed in the worst possible position to their supporting artillery, with 105 Battery firing on a line directly towards them from their gun-line [...] on the other side of the Gang Toi plateau. Consequently, Murphy was unable to observe the fall of shot, and had to walk the rounds onto target by sound. A slight miscalculation could have sent a round over the hill into the Australian positions, regardless, and despite persistent rifle and machine-gun fire, Murphy calmly directed the artillery throughout the battle. For his skill and bravery he was later awarded the Military Cross.|$|E

500|$|During {{the time}} the United States was the most {{dominant}} in all areas like military, energy, exports, etc. Food Power was not really thought about. [...] However, since some of those powers have since diminished, the power of food {{has come to the}} surface. In the realm of food, The United States remains at the top, unchallenged. The United States has the position of being the largest producer and exporter of food. [...] While others nations, predominantly developing nations but even some of the richest oil-exporting nations, are <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> food shortages and becoming more and more dependent on imported food from the United States, giving it more and more power. This allows the United States to expect friendly behavior from the countries that import American food. [...] It is also likely that the United States would have some form of influence over these countries. Even some of the poorest OPEC countries have become dependent on U.S. wheat. Therefore, {{there is a possibility that}} the United States could restrict its food exports for political purposes. [...] The United States could use this Food power as a means of exerting pressure on OPEC countries. [...] Food power will be most effective in times of food shortage or famine because this is when those countries that have some dependence on the United States are most desperate.|$|E
