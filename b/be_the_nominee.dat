5|$|In 1829, Crittenden {{was elected}} to the Kentucky House via a special election. He served as Speaker of the House for his entire term. In 1830, he was the Whig nominee to replace John Rowan in the Senate. Secretly, the party wished to {{nominate}} Henry Clay, giving him a springboard from which to launch another presidential campaign, but it was unknown whether {{he would be able to}} secure enough votes for confirmation; it was decided that Crittenden would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>nominee,</b> and if the voting favored the Whigs by a large enough margin, Crittenden would withdraw and allow them to confirm Clay instead. The Democrats countered successively with Richard Mentor Johnson, John Rowan, Charles A. Wickliffe, and John Breathitt. None of them polled more than sixty-four of the sixty-nine votes needed for confirmation. Crittenden garnered sixty-eight votes on fourteen different ballots, but he refused to vote for himself because he wanted Clay to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>nominee.</b> Some of Crittenden's supporters, however, refused to vote for Clay, and the seat was left vacant.|$|E
5|$|During the campaign, Kemp's {{endorsement}} {{was highly}} coveted. Forbes {{had tried to}} get Kemp {{to run in the}} 1996 campaign, but Kemp declined and in fact endorsed Forbes just as Dole was closing in on the nomination, and just after Dole gained the endorsements of former contenders Lamar Alexander and Richard Lugar. Some feel the primary reason for the endorsement was to keep the flat tax idea and other supply-side views alive. Many thought Kemp had destroyed his own political future with the endorsement, and Kemp profusely apologized to Dole's campaign offices. After it became clear Dole would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>nominee,</b> Kemp attempted to form a bipartisan seminar with Felix Rohatyn to produce a fiscal plan that could be endorsed by both parties.|$|E
500|$|Regarding {{candidates}} for the 2012 Republican primaries, Savage said that Ron Paul had [...] "great ideas" [...] but expressed hope that Rick Perry would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>nominee.</b> On December 12, 2011, he offered Newt Gingrich [...] "1 million dollars" [...] {{to withdraw from the}} United States Presidential contest. He stated that only Mitt Romney had a chance to beat Barack Obama, a man he had previously described as a [...] "quasi-pseudo-crypto Marxist" [...] and a possible foreign usurper, in the 2012 election.|$|E

500|$|McKinley {{expected}} {{the election to}} be fought {{on the issue of}} tariffs; he was a well-known protectionist. The Democrats met in convention in July in Chicago; former Missouri congressman Richard P. Bland was deemed likely to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>nominee.</b> [...] As McKinley awaited his opponent, he privately commented on the nationwide debate over silver, stating to his Canton crony, Judge Day, that [...] "This money matter is unduly prominent. [...] In thirty days you won't hear anything about it." [...] The future Secretary of State and Supreme Court justice responded: [...] "In my opinion in thirty days you won't hear of anything else." ...|$|E
500|$|Harrison and his adherents were unimpressed by McKinley's conduct, {{recalling that}} he had cut off talk of a {{candidacy}} in 1888, but had not done so in 1892. Nevertheless, Hanna {{wrote in a letter}} that [...] "I do not consider that Governor McKinley was placed in any false position by what was done ... Governor McKinley's position today as a result of all that transpired at Minneapolis is in the best possible shape for his future. [...] His bearing and conduct and personal magnetism won the hearts and respect of everybody." [...] McKinley campaigned loyally for President Harrison, who was defeated by former president Cleveland in the November election, and according to the governor's secretary, Charles Bawsel, [...] " [...] is bound to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>nominee</b> for the presidency, and the very fact of the defeat this year will elect him the next time." ...|$|E
500|$|Following his {{nomination}} in June, McKinley's team had {{believed that the}} election would be fought {{on the issue of}} the protective tariff. [...] Chicago banker Charles G. Dawes, a McKinley advisor who had known Bryan when both lived in Lincoln, had predicted to McKinley and his friend and campaign manager, Mark Hanna, that if Bryan had the chance to speak to the convention, he would be its choice. [...] McKinley and Hanna gently mocked Dawes, telling him that Bland would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>nominee.</b> [...] In the three weeks between the two conventions, McKinley spoke only on the tariff question, and when journalist Murat Halstead telephoned him from Chicago to inform him that Bryan would be nominated, he responded dismissively and hung up the phone. [...] When Bryan was nominated on a silver platform, the Republicans were briefly gratified, believing that Bryan's selection would result in an easy victory for McKinley.|$|E

500|$|Both Hanna and Foraker {{had been}} spoken of as {{possible}} Republican presidential candidates in 1904; with President Roosevelt now likely to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>nominee,</b> both men's presidential ambitions were pushed back four years. [...] Hanna {{in particular was}} reluctant to publicly put aside his presidential candidacy, believing that keeping it alive would help assure his re-election by the legislature in 1904. [...] In 1903, Foraker saw an opportunity to embarrass Hanna and boost his own chances for 1908 by getting the Republican state convention to pass a resolution endorsing Roosevelt for re-election. [...] If Hanna supported the resolution, {{he made it clear}} he would not be a candidate; if he opposed it, he risked Roosevelt's wrath. [...] Hanna sent Roosevelt a telegram that he would oppose the resolution; Roosevelt replied that he expected his administration's supporters to vote for such a resolution, and Hanna gave in.|$|E
500|$|When McKinley {{heard that}} Bryan {{was likely to}} <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>nominee,</b> he called the report [...] "rot" [...] and hung up the phone. The Republican nominee was slow to realize the surge of support for Bryan after the nomination, stating his view that the silver {{sentiment}} would be gone in a month. When McKinley and his advisers, such as industrialist and future senator Mark Hanna, realized that the views were more than transitory, they began intensive fundraising from corporations and the wealthy. The money went for speakers, pamphlets, and other means of conveying their [...] "sound money" [...] campaign to the voter. With far less money than McKinley, Bryan embarked on a nationwide campaign tour by train on a then-unprecedented scale. [...] McKinley on the other hand, opted for a front porch campaign. Both men spoke {{to hundreds of thousands}} of people from their chosen venues.|$|E
500|$|As the {{campaign}} got underway, Humphrey tried to position {{himself as the}} conservative Democrat in the race, hoping to appeal to Southern delegates. Republicans, feeling that the Vice President may <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>nominee,</b> began to attack him, describing his positions as socialistic and reminding voters that Southern Democrats once considered him a [...] "wild-eyed liberal." [...] Democrats conceded this point but argued that compared to McCarthy and Kennedy, Humphrey was conservative. He immediately made {{an impact on the}} polls, rocketing to number one among Democrats in the beginning of May with 38%, ahead of both McCarthy and Kennedy. An internal struggle within {{the campaign}} between the new politics of Mondale and Harris, and the old politics of Connell, Kampelman and Maguire, sometimes disrupted the organization of staffers in different states. Humphrey ordered Connell to not circumvent Mondale and Harris on campaign decisions, but the clashing continued throughout the campaign. The older faction referred to Mondale and Harris as [...] "boy scouts".|$|E

500|$|After announcing {{he would}} not run in the 2004 U.S. presidential election, Gore {{endorsed}} Vermont governor Howard Dean in December 2003, weeks before the first primary of the election cycle. He was criticized for this endorsement by eight Democratic contenders particularly since he did not endorse his former running mate Joe Lieberman (Gore preferred Dean over Lieberman because Lieberman supported the Iraq War and Gore did not). Dean's campaign soon became a target of attacks and eventually failed, with Gore's early endorsement being credited as a factor. In The New York Times, Dean stated: [...] "I actually do think the endorsement of Al Gore began the decline." [...] The Times further noted that [...] "Dean instantly amplified his statement {{to indicate that the}} endorsement from Mr. Gore, a powerhouse of the establishment, so threatened the other Democratic candidates that they began the attacks on his candidacy that helped derail it." [...] Dean's former campaign manager, Joe Trippi, also stated that after Gore's endorsement of Dean, [...] "alarm bells went off in every newsroom in the country, in every other campaign in the country", indicating that if something did not change, Dean would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>nominee.</b> Later, in March 2004, Gore endorsed John Kerry and gave Kerry $6 million in funds left over from his own unsuccessful 2000 bid. Gore also opened the 2004 Democratic National Convention.|$|E
2500|$|Roosevelt {{began to}} {{envision}} {{himself as the}} savior of the Republican Party from defeat in the upcoming presidential election. In February 1912, Roosevelt announced in Boston, [...] "I will accept the nomination for president if it is tendered to me. I hope that so far as possible the people may be given the chance through direct primaries to express who shall <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>nominee.</b> Elihu Root and Henry Cabot Lodge thought that division of the party would lead to its defeat in the next election, while Taft believed {{that he would be}} defeated either in the Republican primary or in the general election.|$|E
2500|$|By December 2007, the Clinton {{campaign}} {{charged that}} Obama's campaign was getting much more favorable media treatment than their own, especially once their campaign began faltering. [...] Washington Post media analyst Howard Kurtz found {{a number of}} journalists who agreed with the claim, with Mark Halperin, Time magazine's editor-at-large for political news, saying, [...] "Your typical reporter has a thinly disguised preference that Barack Obama <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>nominee.</b> The narrative of him beating her is better than her beating him, in part because she's a Clinton {{and in part because}} he's a young African American. ... There's no one rooting for her to come back." ...|$|E

2500|$|Pitted against Francis Shunk Brown, the {{candidate}} of Vare's Philadelphia machine, and Thomas Phillips, a former two-term congressman from western Pennsylvania, who was enthusiastically supported by the state's [...] "wet" [...] forces, Pinchot overcame a deficit of nearly 200,000 votes in traditionally Republican Philadelphia to pull into a 12,000-vote lead on election night. The 281,000 votes cast for former congressman Phillips, most of which came at Brown's expense, appeared to have given Pinchot a narrow victory in the primary. Brown's attorneys immediately challenged the results, contending that some 60,000 ballots in Luzerne County should be tossed out {{because they had been}} perforated beforehand by county election officials in an attempt to prevent fraud. The legal battle ensued throughout the summer and nobody knew for sure who the Republican candidate for governor would be, especially since both men periodically claimed to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>nominee.</b> Ending four months of litigation and political turmoil on August 20, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, while castigating the Luzerne Common Pleas Court for marking (perforating) the ballots in the first place, upheld an earlier lower court ruling and declared that all 60,000 perforated ballots were valid, thereby certifying Pinchot as the winner of the May 20 Republican primary.|$|E
60|$|I {{have this}} moment {{received}} your very short note {{asking me if}} old Taylor {{is to be used}} up, and who will <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>nominee.</b> My hope of Taylor's nomination is as high--a little higher than it was when you left. Still, the case is by no means out of doubt. Mr. Clay's letter has not advanced his interests any here. Several who were against Taylor, but not for anybody particularly, before, are since taking ground, some for Scott and some for McLean. Who will be nominated neither I nor any one else can tell. Now, let me pray to you in turn. My prayer is that you let nothing discourage or baffle you, but that, in spite of every difficulty, you send us a good Taylor delegate from your circuit. Make Baker, who is now with you, I suppose, help about it. He is a good hand to raise a breeze.|$|E
