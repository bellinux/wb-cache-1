Particularly, dual mode trailer (DMT) systems are significantly focused as a new transportation alternative which basically provides integrating {{of the land and}} railroad services. Recently, a new type DMT system was suggested in the country, namely the horizontal transfer system (HTS) which lifts the <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>container</b> up and transfers it horizontally. In this paper we dealt with the structural design and analysis of this horizontal transfer system. First we analyze the conditions for design of the system, next we design the driving system and the lifting system to satisfy these conditions...|$|E
40|$|Feeding {{preferences}} of larval container-dwelling mosquitoes {{are not well}} understood. Primary production is often absent in container systems and external inputs of animal and plant detritus supply the energy <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>container</b> food webs by supporting microorganism prey for mosquitoes. We quantified the feeding {{preferences of}} Aedes albopictus (Skuse), a non-native invasive mosquito, and Ochlerotahts triseriatus (Say), a native mosquito, when given a choice of animal and plant detritus. We tested for interpopulational (Illinois versus Florida) differences in feeding preferences, and quantified each species 2 ̆ 7 performance on these two detritus types. When given a choice, both species spent significantly more time feeding at an animal detritus patch. The Illinois populations of both species spent more time feeding at animal detritus patches than did the Florida populations, which spent more time feeding at leaf detritus than did Illinois populations. Both species reached a later instar and had higher survival when reared with animal versus leaf detritus. Ae. albopictus spent more time feeding at animal detritus and had higher survival when reared on either detritus type compared with Oc. triseriatus. Greater preference for and better performance exhibited by Ae. albopictus in high-quality food (animal detritus) may result in preemption of high quality food and {{may contribute to the}} superior competitive ability of Ae. albopictus relative to Oc. triseriatus...|$|E

50|$|Granulation {{is carried}} out for various reasons, {{one of which is}} to prevent the {{segregation}} of the constituents of powder mix. Segregation is due to differences in the size or density of the component of the mix.

An ideal granulation will contain all the constituents of the mix in the correct proportion in each granule and segregation of granules will not occur.|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{container}} loading {{problem has}} important industrial and commercial applications. Anincrease {{in the number}} of items in a container leads to a decrease in cost. For this reason the related optimization problem is of economic importance. In this work, a procedure based ona nonlinear decision problem to solve the cylinder packing problem with identical diameters is presented. This formulation is {{based on the fact that}} the centers of the cylinders have to beinside the rectangular box defined by the <b>base</b> <b>of</b> the <b>container</b> (a radius far from the frontier) and far from each other at least one diameter.

40|$|The {{difficulties}} {{associated with}} instrumenting earthquake sites {{in order to}} record pore pressure changes in a future event led {{to the use of}} scaled model tests performed in a centrifuge. Both dry and saturated sands were employed, contained in a box constructed of aluminium laminae designed to move freely on each other. This would result in shearing distortions developing in the soil unimpeded by the container. Accelerometers, displacement transducers and pore pressure sensors were attached to the box and embedded in the soil at various elevations so as to record the response of the soil to an earthquake-like excitation supplied to the <b>base</b> <b>of</b> the <b>container.</b> A special apparatus was constructed to imitate earthquake motion. In some tests on saturated sand, the soil profile was liquefied. Test results of accelerations, lateral and vertical displacements and pore pressures against time for typical earthquake inputs are given. The data, obtained under controlled conditions, can be compared with the various calculation methods for dynamically generated pore pressures...|$|R

40|$|The load {{suspension}} device is for placing in storage racks storage containers which it grabs on the floor. Part {{of the load}} {{suspension device}} is located on a carriage which can be extended to either side, on which two chain drives are mounted, said chain drives guiding two carriers. For loading purposes, the carriage drives out until {{the ends of the}} chain drive are suituated at both sides <b>of</b> the storage <b>container.</b> As a result of the movement of the chains, the carriers are introduced in succession into transverse slots on the <b>base</b> <b>of</b> the storage <b>container</b> and the carriage is retracted so that the container is pulled onto the load suspension device. By suitably synchronizing the carrier and carriage movements, the minimum vertical spacing <b>of</b> the storage <b>container</b> is only limited by the thickness of the carrier. Several load suspension devices can be arranged in a stacked order to save space, whereby the resulting vertical pitch corresponds to that of the racks...|$|R
40|$|Chains are {{frequently}} used {{to tie the}} shipping <b>containers</b> <b>of</b> hazardous material to a truck bed. The tie-down system is nonlinear when the container is subjected to a triaxial force during transit. It is nonlinear because chains cannot carry compressive force, and the <b>base</b> <b>of</b> the <b>container</b> may partially lift off from the truck bed. A method was developed to calculate the amount of tension in the chains. This methodology includes three assumptions: (1) No friction exists between the container and the truck bed; (2) The container and the truck bed are rigid; and (3) All chains are properly tightened (i. e., no slacks) during preparation for shipment. The methodology employs an iterative process of a linear tie-down system. This linear system {{is derived from the}} nonlinear system with two additional assumptions: (a) All chains can carry compression as well as tension; and (b) There is a point contact between the container and the truck bed. This linear system has a closed-form solution. After the first solution of the linear system is obtained, the unreasonable, or physically impossible, rotational degree of freedom <b>of</b> the <b>container</b> and the chains with compressive force are eliminated in the follow-up iterative calculations using the same linear system. Unreasonable rotation is detected when the results indicate a rotation <b>of</b> the <b>container</b> into the truck bed. Zero rotational value is assigned to this degree of freedom in the follow-up iterations. For chains under compression, the chain length is replaced with a fictitiously large value because a long chain carries essentially no load. This process usually needs only two or three iterations and can easily be carried out in a spread sheet using such programs as Microsoft Excel or LOTUS 123...|$|R
