25|$|Locomotive : This {{pattern is}} {{produced}} {{when all the}} planets are contained within 240 degrees or nine signs of the zodiac, so that a whole 120 degrees is completely unoccupied. The planet that rises clockwise following the empty space will significantly influence {{the life of the}} person with this pattern, no matter what is indicated by the sun sign. It will act as the 'locomotive' of the natal chart, driving the individual to achieve goals through determined and unrelenting effort, with an exceptional drive and fund of energy at their disposal. Such a person will often be a loner, waiting for the public to discover the truth of what they have <b>been</b> <b>saying</b> <b>all</b> along.|$|E
500|$|Stanley was a {{powerful}} orator who used dramatic flourishes to emphasize his points. He would often loosen his tie before he ever started speaking, {{and by the end}} of his speech have thrown off his vest and coat. In one instance, the candidates debated a tax on dog owners of one dollar per dog. Stanley favored the tax, while Morrow contended that everyone should be allowed one dog tax-free. Stanley ridiculed the idea as [...] "Free Old Dog Ring," [...] and sometimes howled like a dog in speeches deriding the proposal. On another occasion Stanley, who had too much to drink, vomited in front of the audience as Morrow spoke. When Stanley took the podium, he remarked, [...] "That just goes to show you what I have <b>been</b> <b>saying</b> <b>all</b> over Kentucky. Ed Morrow plain makes me sick to my stomach." ...|$|E
500|$|Wolf of Anime UK News {{originally}} said of {{the scene}} that: [...] "I'm 99.999% sure the kiss did occur, but that 0.001% is horribly getting to me. I don't want to go by what everyone else sees – I {{want to see what}} is actually going on, and share in the reaction of the characters {{at the same time as}} them". However, by the twelfth episode, he said that the scene in which Victor cries was the proof he wanted: [...] "If the kiss is the initial spark, and the rings the visible sign of love, then the tears are proof that you don't want it to end. I have <b>been</b> <b>saying</b> <b>all</b> the time that what I wanted was text rather than subtext – but in end, I think the subtext did actually pay off." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I can't stand it--I can't bear {{to realize}} that they've <b>been</b> <b>saying</b> <b>all</b> these things while I've been going about so happily and liking them. I wonder if {{you ought to have}} told me? It will make me self-conscious." ...|$|E

6000|$|There was {{no mistaking}} the sincerity and {{determination}} of Kelley's tone, and the young man, so far from resenting these qualities, replied, meekly: [...] "I {{want to get out}} of it, Ed. I've <b>been</b> <b>saying</b> <b>all</b> day that I must quit it. But what can I do?" ...|$|E

Every one has <b>been</b> <b>saying</b> <b>all</b> sorts of unkind things about that charming Mr. Lessingham, and there you are--Major Felstead's friend and a Guardsman! Somehow or other, I felt that he belonged to one of the crack regiments. I shall certainly ask him to dinner one night next week." ...|$|E

But it made him almost sick to hear his engagement spoken of as a curious and ambiguous phenomenon. He might have his own ideas about it—one always had about one’s engagement; but the ideas that appeared to have peopled the imagination of his friends ended by kindling a small hot expanse in each of his cheeks. “I’d rather not talk any more about my little plans,” he added to his host. “I’ve <b>been</b> <b>saying</b> <b>all</b> sorts of absurd things to Mrs. Freer.” ...|$|E

"Only this,--that {{people had}} <b>been</b> <b>saying</b> <b>all</b> about Exeter {{that he was}} going to be married to a young lady, and that as the report was incorrect, and as he had never had the remotest idea in his mind of making the young lady his wife,--" [...] Camilla, as she said this, spoke with a great deal of emphasis, putting forward her chin and shaking her head,--"and as he thought it was uncomfortable both for the young lady and for himself, and as there was nothing in it the least in the world,--nothing at all, no glimmer of a {{foundation}} for the report, it would be better to have it denied everywhere. That is what I said; and we had authority from the gentleman himself. Arabella can say the same, and so can mamma;--only mamma did not hear him." [...] Nor had Camilla heard him, but that incident she did not mention.|$|E
6000|$|... "It'll {{be better}} for me to speak plain," [...] he said, with evident effort, [...] "though it's hard work. You see, sir, this isn't a trifle to me, {{whatever}} it may be to you. I'm none o' them men as can go making love first to one woman and then t' another, and don't think it much odds which of 'em I take. What I feel for Hetty's a different sort o' love, such as I believe nobody can know much about but them as feel it and God as has given it to 'em. She's more nor everything else to me, all but my conscience and my good name. And if it's true what you've <b>been</b> <b>saying</b> <b>all</b> along--and if it's only been trifling and flirting as you call it, as 'll be put an end to by your going away--why, then, I'd wait, and hope her heart 'ud turn to me after all. I'm loath to think you'd speak false to me, and I'll believe your word, however things may look." ...|$|E

50|$|One of {{the main}} debate around the new {{commission}} was the recommendation of amnesties for crimes under international law within the Act itself. Many victims’ groups were against {{this part of the}} Act. That is why five experts for the UN Human Rights Council examined the TRC Act passed by Nepal’s Constituent Assembly. According to Richard Bennett, Asia director at Amnesty International, “the UN’s findings are consistent with what human rights groups have <b>been</b> <b>saying</b> <b>all</b> along - Nepal’s TRC Act is fundamentally flawed and could leave thousands of victims of conflict-related violations without access to the justice they deserve”. Under international pressure, the Supreme Court annulled the amnesty provision saying it was against constitutional provisions and international laws.|$|E
