40|$|Background and {{objective}} Distant metastasis was common in lung cancer, especially patients with <b>bone</b> marrow <b>metastasis</b> had poor prognosis {{and there were}} few effective methods. Crizotinib had been confirmed {{to be used in}} anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) positive lung adenocarcinoma, but the efficacy in lung cancer with <b>bone</b> marrow <b>metastasis</b> was unknown. In the present study, we reported one case of ALK-positive lung adenocarcinoma with bone marrow matastasis given crizotinib treatment, the safety and efficacy was summarized. Methods ALK fusion was tested by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Crizotinib was given with dose of 250 mg, bid. Objective response was evaluated by Response Evaluation Criteriation in Solid Tumours (RECIST) v 1. 1 and bone marrow response was evaluated by bone marrow puncture and biopsy. Adeverse events were evaluated according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTC AE) v 4. 0. Results The patient achieved partial response (PR) after 6 weeks of crizotinib, especially the objective response of <b>bone</b> marrow <b>metastasis</b> was complete response (CR). The patient stopped crizotinib because of pneumonia. The progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) was 20 weeks and 22 weeks respectively. Conclusion Crizotinib could be an effective method for ALK-positive lung cancer with <b>bone</b> marrow <b>metastasis</b> and showed good tolerance...|$|R

40|$|Sho Nakamura, Tadahisa Fukui, Shuhei Suzuki, Hiroyuki Takeda, Kaname Watanabe, Takashi Yoshioka Department of Clinical Oncology, Yamagata University Faculty of Medicine, Yamagata, Japan Abstract: <b>Bone</b> marrow <b>metastasis</b> {{is a rare}} {{consequence}} of colorectal cancer that results in a poor prognosis; few reports describe a favorable response to doublet chemotherapy combined with targeted therapy, which is currently the standard treatment. We experienced a case where anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibody produced a marked anti-tumor response to <b>bone</b> marrow <b>metastasis</b> that led to long-term survival. A 51 -year-old man {{was diagnosed with a}} primary KRAS-wildtype rectal cancer with multiple metastases, including the bone marrow. Disease control was achieved for 10. 8 months following chemotherapy with a modified FOLFOX 6 regimen combined with an anti-EGFR antibody. He died of cancer 22. 7 and 16. 6 months after disease onset and first-line chemotherapy, respectively. This case shows that early tumor shrinkage and deepness of response to the anti-EGFR antibody were observed even in a patient with <b>bone</b> marrow <b>metastasis.</b> Anti-EGFR antibody therapy should therefore be considered even when a patientâ€™s medical condition appears to be poor owing to <b>bone</b> marrow <b>metastasis.</b> Moreover, tumors that are likely to be sensitive to chemotherapy, such as RAS-wildtype colorectal cancers, can be considered for anti-EGFR antibody therapy even if the patient is considered unfit for chemotherapy.

2500|$|Palliative {{care for}} {{advanced}} stage prostate cancer focuses on extending life and relieving {{the symptoms of}} metastatic disease. As noted above, abiraterone is showing some promise in treating advance-stage prostate cancer. [...] It causes a dramatic reduction in PSA levels and tumor sizes in aggressive advanced-stage prostate cancer for 70% of patients. [...] Chemotherapy may be offered to slow disease progression and postpone symptoms. The most commonly used regimen combines the chemotherapeutic drug docetaxel with a corticosteroid such as prednisone. One study showed that treatment with docetaxel with prednisone prolonged life from 16.5 months for those taking mitoxantrone and prednisone to 18.9 months for those taking docetaxel + prednisone.

There was no evidence of skeletal metastasis. The clinical course was extremely aggressive and the patient succumbed ten days after admission, finally being diagnosed in the postmortem examination.

40|$|Introduction: Gastric cancer {{notoriously}} recurs post curative surgical resection. While {{there may}} be visceral metastasis to peritoneal surfaces, bone marrow involvement may also occur although with rarity. We present a case report of recurrent gastric cancer with <b>bone</b> marrow <b>metastasis</b> in a patient with no evidence of systemic disease on follow-up for two years post surgical resection. This case demonstrates the need of heightened clinical suspicion in these patients. Methods: We reviewed the medical records of a patient who presented with metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma to the bone marrow two years post R 0 subtotal gastrectomy with Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy without evidence of systemic disease on follow up for two years. Results: Laboratory and imaging studies of the patient on presentation two years post R 0 subtotal gastrectomy with Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy is as follows; elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) of 472 U/L, CT chest/abdomen/pelvis that showed multiple new sclerotic lesions throughout osseous structures suspicious for metastasis, PET/CT that showed many sclerotic lesions throughout the axial and appendicular skeleton, some FDG-avid and suspicious for active osseous <b>metastasis.</b> <b>Bone</b> marrow biopsy showed metastatic poorly differentiated carcinoma consisted with known history of gastric cancer.

40|$|Background: Bone marrow biopsy {{is widely}} used method for diagnosis, {{follow-up}} and staging of hemato-oncologic diseases. This procedure is also used for determining the <b>bone</b> marrow <b>metastasis</b> in patients with solid tumors. In this study, clinical, hematological, and pathological features of 58 patients with bone marrow metastases diagnosed by bone marrow biopsies were examined retrospectively Materials and Methods: Among 3345 bone marrow biopsies performed in our hospital between January 2006 and August 2013, 58 cases with solid tumor metastasized to bone marrow were included in this study. Results: Among 58 cases with solid organ carcinoma <b>metastasis</b> in <b>bone</b> marrow, mean age was 59. 9. Thirty-nine cases {{were found to have}} a known primary tumor focus. The most common tumors metastasized to bone marrow were breast carcinomas (23 patients, 59 %), gastric carcinomas (6 patients, 15. 3 %), prostate carcinomas (4 patients, 10, 2 %), and lung carcinomas (3 patients, 7. 7 %), respectively. Nineteen patients were firstly diagnosed from bone marrow biopsies as metastatic carcinomas. The median overall survival after <b>bone</b> marrow <b>metastasis</b> was 28 days (95 % confidence interval: 7. 5 - 48. 4). The median overall survival difference was not statistically significant between patients with primary known and unknown tumor (P = 0. 973). Statistically significant difference was observed between the survival of breast cancer and gastric cancer (P = 0. 028). The most common hematologic symptom was the coexistence of anemia and thrombocytopenia (31 %), thrombocytopenia (27. 6 %) and anemia (20. 7 %) alone. The median overall survival difference was statistically significant between patients who have anemia and thrombocytopenia (P < 0. 005). Conclusion: Bone marrow biopsy is an easily accessible, easily applied, a useful procedure for diagnosing metastatic diseases in patients with hematologic symptoms such as anemia and thrombocytopenia besides being an uncomfortable procedure for patients.
