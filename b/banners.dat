5|$|During royal coronations, however, {{separate}} <b>banners</b> {{for each}} of the two constituent nations of the Commonwealth were still used. Crown (i.e., Polish) and Lithuanian standard-bearers carried the furled <b>banners</b> in a procession to the royal cathedral where, shortly after the anointment and just before the crowning of the king-elect, they handed the <b>banners</b> to the primate who unfurled them and handed them to the kneeling king. The king would then stand up and give the unfurled <b>banners</b> back to the standard-bearers.|$|E
5|$|Hanging scroll: Hanging scrolls {{originated}} in their earliest form from literature and other texts written on bamboo strips and silk <b>banners</b> in ancient China. The earliest hanging scrolls {{are related to}} and developed from silk <b>banners</b> in early Chinese history. These <b>banners</b> were long and hung vertically on walls. Such silk <b>banners</b> and hanging scroll paintings were found at Mawangdui {{dating back to the}} Han Dynasty (206 BCE – 220 CE). By the time of the Tang Dynasty (618–907), the aesthetic and structural objectives for hanging scrolls were summarized, which are still followed to this day. During the early Song Dynasty (960–1279), the scrolls became well suited to the art styles of the artists, consequently hanging scrolls were made in many different sizes and proportions.|$|E

5|$|The Order {{was without}} a {{ceremonial}} home until 1881 when arrangements {{were made to}} display <b>banners,</b> helms and hatchment plates (the equivalent of stall plates, {{in the absence of}} stalls) in the Great Hall, officially called St. Patrick's Hall, in Dublin Castle. On the establishment of the Irish Free State the <b>banners</b> of the living knights were removed. When the Hall was redecorated in 1962 it was decided that it should be hung with the <b>banners</b> {{of the members of the}} Order in 1922. The existing <b>banners</b> were repaired or new ones made; it is these <b>banners</b> which can be seen today. The Hall, which was renamed St Patrick's Hall from its association with the Order, also served as the Chancery of the Order. Installation ceremonies, and later investitures, were held here, often on St Patrick's Day, until they were discontinued. A banquet for the Knights was often held in the Hall on the occasion of an installation. St Patrick's Hall now serves as the location for the inauguration of the President of Ireland. If an incumbent Irish president dies in office (such as Erskine Hamilton Childers in 1974), he lies in state in the hall.|$|E

Chronicler Jan Długosz praised the Smolensk <b>banners,</b> who fought bravely and were the only <b>banners</b> from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania not to retreat. In Soviet historiography, the Battle of Grunwald was styled as a racial struggle between Slavs and Germanics. The Teutonic Knights were portrayed as the medieval forerunners of Hitler's armies, while the battle itself was seen as the medieval counterpart to the Battle of Stalingrad.|$|E
