5|$|In July, Carlsen and Berge Østenstad (then {{the reigning}} Norwegian champion) tied for {{first in the}} Norwegian Chess Championship, each scoring 7/9. A two-game match <b>between</b> <b>them</b> <b>was</b> {{arranged}} to decide the title. Both games were drawn, which left Østenstad the champion because he had superior tiebreaks in the tournament.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{proximity}} of the two schools, the 2009 Chick-fil-A Bowl was only their eighth football meeting. Tennessee held a 5-2 advantage in the series, but before 1994, the last meeting <b>between</b> <b>them</b> <b>was</b> in 1937. The 1994 meeting was in the 1994 Gator Bowl, which the Volunteers won 45-23. Each school rapidly sold its allotment of 17,000 tickets, and publicly available tickets were sold out before the matchup was announced. This gave the Chick-fil-A Bowl its 13th consecutive sellout.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Seljuks were {{advancing}} towards al-Jazira, and {{the descendants}} of Qatada ibn Idris fought with their Ayyubid overlords over control of Mecca. The conflict <b>between</b> <b>them</b> <b>was</b> taken advantage of by the Rasulids of Yemen who attempted to end Ayyubid suzerainty in the Hejaz and bring the region under their control which they accomplished in 1238 when Nur al-Din Umar captured Mecca.|$|E

Cheques with the denomination expressed as '10000' or '100000' bear serial numbers with the (scarce) prefix AA, while notes with prefixes AB onwards is expressed as '10000' or '100000'.|$|E
5|$|From 2012 to 2015, the {{two teams}} competed in the I-40 Cup Series, a season-long, 16-game series between the clubs. Whichever of the two won the most games played <b>between</b> <b>them</b> <b>was</b> {{declared}} the winner and received a trophy cup to keep until the next season. The losing team donated game tickets to a charity selected by the winner. The Sounds won the inaugural 2012 contest (9–7), and Memphis won the 2013 series (7–9). The teams tied the 2014 and 2015 series (both 8–8); the Redbirds retained the title in both instances. The teams discontinued the trophy cup, friendly wager, and promotional references to the Series after 2015.|$|E
5|$|In the Norwegian Chess Championship, Carlsen again {{finished}} in shared first place, {{this time with}} his mentor Simen Agdestein. A playoff <b>between</b> <b>them</b> <b>was</b> played between 7 and 10 November. This time, Carlsen had the better tiebreaks, but the rule giving the title to the player with better tiebreak scores {{in the event of}} a 1–1 draw had been revoked previously. The match was closely fought—Agdestein won the first game, Carlsen the second—so the match went into a series of two-game rapid matches until there was a winner. Carlsen won the first rapid game, Agdestein the second. Then followed three draws until Agdestein won the championship title with a victory in the sixth rapid game.|$|E

5|$|Iraq {{achieved}} {{their second}} Gulf Cup of Nations in the 1984 edition in Muscat, with Ammo Baba as the team's manager. Saeed scored the two Iraqi goals in Iraq's first match in a 2–1 victory, scored a hat-trick in Iraq's 4–0 win over Saudi Arabia, and also scored two goals in Iraq's fifth match against Kuwait in a 3–1 win. Iraq were a match away from winning the cup but, unfortunately, Iraq lost against Qatar in a 1–2 defeat. Iraq and Qatar had {{an equal amount}} of points which led them to having a final decisive match. On 28 March, a final match <b>between</b> <b>them</b> <b>was</b> played. The two teams drew in the whole 90 minutes of the game. In extra time, Iraq scored a goal and Qatar leveled, taking the match to penalties where Iraq defeated Qatar 4–3. Saeed was the top goalscorer of the tournament with 7 goals and had received the Best Player of the Tournament award along with Oman's Ghulam Khamis.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{parts of}} the present structure are the nave and the chancel, which are 13th-century. The church shows signs of alterations and additions in subsequent centuries. A transept or chapel {{was added to the}} south side of the chancel in the late 13th or early 14th century. The arch <b>between</b> <b>them</b> <b>was</b> once the archway between the chancel and the nave but was later moved. The bellcote at the west end of the roof was added in the 14th century. The porch on {{the south side of the}} nave was built in about 1500, and was re-roofed in 1725. A doorway in the north wall of the nave was inserted in the late 15th or early 16th century, and now leads into a vestry added in the 19th century. The main roof is largely 17th-century. Some repairs were carried out in the 1840s, with further repairs in 1854 under the supervision of the diocesan architect, Henry Kennedy.|$|E
5|$|Parlett {{included}} an extensive discography in his 1999 A Catalogue of the Works of Sir Arnold Bax, later expanded and updated in a website. At 2015 the latter lists more than 250 works by Bax {{that have been}} recorded and published. The discography includes three complete cycles of Bax's symphonies released on CD, two by Chandos Records, the first conducted by Bryden Thomson (recorded 1983–88) and the second by Handley (2003); <b>between</b> <b>them</b> <b>was</b> a cycle issued by Naxos Records conducted by David Lloyd-Jones (recorded 1997–2001). The major tone poems and other orchestral works have been recorded, {{many of them in}} several different versions. Bax's chamber music is well represented on disc, with recordings of most of the works, and multiple versions of many, including the Elegiac Trio, the Clarinet Sonata and the Fantasy Sonata. Much of the piano music has been recorded by pianists including Iris Loveridge, John McCabe, Ashley Wass and Michael Endres, though by 2015 no integral survey had yet been recorded. Of the vocal works, by far the most often recorded is Mater ora Filium, but other choral works, and a representative selection of the songs are on disc.|$|E

The primary difference <b>between</b> <b>them</b> <b>was</b> in equipment; the Yak-200 lacked all of the specialized navigation and bombardier gear.|$|E
25|$|Bujor {{remained}} on the editorial staff until April 1907, when Stere objected to his ideological vacillation—a dispute <b>between</b> <b>them</b> <b>was</b> aired in the daily Opinia, and Ioan Cantacuzino took his place. For his part, Bujor, who now shunned the PNL, depicted Viața Românească as a National Liberal mouthpiece.

25|$|Inscriptions on Roman triumphal arches were {{works of}} art in themselves, with very finely cut, {{sometimes}} gilded letters.

This conception of what later became the art of typography remains of fundamental importance down to the present day.|$|E
