5|$|With {{river traffic}} increasing, damage from barge {{collisions}} increased. By 1972, the Greenville Bridge was hit more times by barges {{than any other}} bridge on the Mississippi. The bridge was located close to a sharp bend in the Mississippi; towboats and barges had difficulty making the sharp turn and regaining their course in time to avoid a collision with the bridge. Over the years many have not <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the turn quickly and have hit it. The bridge had become a danger to river traffic.|$|E

25|$|Today, the {{composition}} and yields of such fish catches are virtually negligible. Extensive fish kills, Nile perch, loss of habitat and overfishing have caused many fisheries to collapse and many protein sources to be unavailable at the market for local consumption.

25|$|Following this defeat McCarthy's two-year {{contract}} {{came to an}} end and it was expected that he would be replaced as manager, however, he was later re-appointed for a further two-year term by the Cork County Board, in spite {{of the majority of the}} players not wanting him to stay on. The players on the 2008 panel led by Donal Óg Cusack then refused to play or train under McCarthy. (see 2008-2009 Cork players strike). McCarthy accordingly began the 2009 league campaign with a new squad, none of whom had <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the previous year's panel.|$|E

25|$|A {{frequent}} {{criticism of}} Resnais's films among English-language commentators {{has been that}} they are emotionally cold; {{that they are all}} about technique without grasp of character or subject, that his understanding of beauty is compromised by a lack of sensuousness, and that his seriousness of intent fails to communicate itself to audiences. Elsewhere however it is suggested that such views are partly based on a misreading of the films, especially his earlier ones, which has impeded an appreciation of the humour and irony which pervade his work; and other viewers have <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the connection between the film's form and its human dimension.|$|E

Shapiro also {{observed}} an empty P2P bottle at the house. Two days later, he returned with 100 g of P2P. While he mostly watched as the trio made their meth, at one point, according to later court testimony, he and Russell helped pick up some pieces of dropped aluminum foil {{and put it into}} a flask. Patrick Connolly finished the rest of the process, and Shapiro stopped by the next morning to pick up his half of the meth. He also bought a portion of the remainder for $60.|$|E

However, not-for-profit housing co-operatives {{are committed to the}} mixed-income concept and have not <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> much use of the few opportunities that have come available in recent years. Also, the term of many of the government agreements concerning funding for housing subsidies are coming to an end, provoking a debate in individual co-ops and the co-op movement {{on the extent to which}} co-ops should continue to be mixed-income forms of housing.|$|E

25|$|I {{think every}} {{director}} {{thinks that he}} hasn't been allowed to make the films he wanted to make. I certainly haven't <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> as many Westerns as I've wanted. (But) sometimes staying alive in a career sense is very important, and you think, 'Maybe I'll do this, which will do well and allow me to do that.' It's very easy to miscalculate. It's a dangerous game. But I think in the end, none of us have anybody to blame except ourselves. It can be very hard. The {{kinds of things that}} directors most want to do are usually not things the studio perceives to be commercially viable. It really is that simple. Is that true of me? Sure. Absolutely. But it's no more true of me than 50 other people I know.|$|E
25|$|While Commodore Jones and Captain Landais were {{fighting}} their unexpectedly separate battles, Captains Cottineau of the Pallas and Ricot of Vengeance were left {{wondering what to}} do. In a well-organised formation, they might have <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a contribution, but to intervene in a ship-to-ship duel would be very dangerous. In theory, they could {{have taken advantage of}} the confusion to sail off after the stragglers of the convoy, but night had now fallen, and until the moon rose, they {{would not be able to}} see their prey. Also, it quickly became clear that Bonhomme Richard would need help. Therefore, they waited until they could be useful. About this time, the little schooner caught up with them, but there was no way to transfer the potentially very useful boarding team to Bonhomme Richard or Alliance.|$|E
25|$|Norwegian {{contributions}} to international crisis management have been generated from {{a system that}} is first and foremost geared towards the rapid activation of mobilization units armed and trained for territorial defence. As a consequence, Norwegian {{contributions to}} international military operations have a high degree of sustainability, as they have a substantial number of reserve units on which to draw. However, without adaptation this force posture is to a lesser extent able to generate forces rapidly and flexibly in response to international crises. Moreover, the contributions that Norway has <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> to international operations have tended to consist of lightly armoured mechanized infantry, well-suited for more traditional peacekeeping tasks (UNIFIL in southern Lebanon to which Norway contributed a sizable unit for over twenty years) but not sufficiently robust for missions which might entail enforcement tasks.|$|E

25|$|The charioteer {{would have}} had to use great skill to ensure that the radius of each turn of the chariot was correct to make one of the wheels exactly stop rotating. Unless he did this correctly, the {{pointing}} doll would not have kept aiming to the south. He {{would have been able to}} adjust the direction in which it aimed by making turns that were more or less sharp. This would sometimes have given him opportunities to use the chariot dishonestly. If it was being demonstrated to spectators, for example, and was being driven around in front of them, making many turns, the charioteer, who would have known which way was south, would have <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the chariot appear to work extremely accurately as a compass for long periods. The spectators could have been shown the machinery, and would have seen that the charioteer could not manipulate the doll. They would presumably have been impressed by the apparent accuracy of the mechanism. It is possible that this type of chariot was sometimes constructed with the prime purpose of fraudulently impressing spectators. Possibly, people who built these chariots deceived their own employers with them, which could have gained them fame and fortune provided nobody tried using the chariots for real navigation.|$|E
25|$|The {{peoples of}} the region were notable for their number and variety, as {{classical}} sources testify. Herodotus, Strabo, and Pliny appreciate the multitude of languages spoken in Dioscurias and other towns. The mountainous terrain tended to separate and isolate local peoples from one another and encouraged the development of dozens of separate languages and dialects complicating the ethnic makeup of the region. Even the most well-informed contemporary authors are very confused when naming and locating these peoples and provide only very limited information about the geography and population of the hinterland. Furthermore, some classic ethnic names were presumably collective terms and supposed considerable migrations also took place around the region. Various {{attempts have been made}} to identify these peoples with the ethnic terms employed by classical authors. Some scholars identify Pliny the Elder’s Apsilae of the 1st century and Arrian’s Abasgoi of the 2nd century with the probable proto-Abkhaz- and Abaza-speakers respectively, while others consider them proto-Kartvelian tribal designations. The identity and origin of other peoples (e.g., Heniochi, Sanigae) dwelling in the area are also disputed. Archaeology has seldom <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> strong connections between the remains of material culture and the opaque names of peoples mentioned by classical writers. Thus, controversies still continue and a series of questions remain open.|$|E
