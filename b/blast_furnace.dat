5|$|The first <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> in Russia {{opened in}} 1637 near Tula and {{was called the}} Gorodishche Works. The <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> spread from here to the central Russia and then finally to the Urals.|$|E
5|$|A <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> {{is a type}} of {{metallurgical}} furnace {{used for}} smelting to produce industrial metals and its alloys, generally iron, but also others such as lead or copper.|$|E
5|$|An {{endless rope}} or cord {{may have been}} used in Du Shi's device of waterwheels that powered bellows of the <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> in the 1st century (see Wind Power below).|$|E
5|$|<b>Blast</b> <b>furnaces</b> are {{currently}} rarely used in copper smelting, but modern lead smelting <b>blast</b> <b>furnaces</b> are much shorter than iron <b>blast</b> <b>furnaces</b> and are rectangular in shape. The overall shaft height is around 5 to 6 m. Modern lead <b>blast</b> <b>furnaces</b> {{are constructed using}} water-cooled steel or copper jackets for the walls, and have no refractory linings in the side walls. The base of the furnace is a hearth of refractory material (bricks or castable refractory). Lead <b>blast</b> <b>furnaces</b> are often open-topped rather than having the charging bell used in iron <b>blast</b> <b>furnaces.</b>|$|R

5|$|<b>Blast</b> <b>furnaces</b> {{used in the}} ISP have a {{more intense}} {{operation}} than standard lead <b>blast</b> <b>furnaces,</b> with higher air blast rates per m2 of hearth area and a higher coke consumption.|$|R
5|$|The Chinese <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> {{remained}} in use well until the 20th century. The backyard furnaces favoured by Mao Zedong during the Great Leap Forward were of this type. In the regions with strong traditions of metallurgy, the steel production actually increased during this period. In the regions {{where there was}} no tradition of steelmaking or where the ironmasters knowing the traditional skills or the scientific principles of the <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> process had been killed, the results were less than satisfactory.|$|E
5|$|Since the 17th {{century the}} first step in European steel {{production}} has been the smelting of iron ore into pig iron in a <b>blast</b> <b>furnace.</b> Originally employing charcoal, modern methods use coke, which has proven more economical.|$|E
5|$|The {{products}} of the above-mentioned processes are transformed into the cobalt oxide (Co3O4). This oxide is reduced to the metal by the aluminothermic reaction or reduction with carbon in a <b>blast</b> <b>furnace.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Edward Alfred Cowper {{applied the}} {{regeneration}} principle to <b>blast</b> <b>furnaces,</b> {{in the form}} of the [...] "Cowper stove", patented in 1857. This is almost invariably used with <b>blast</b> <b>furnaces</b> to this day.|$|R

50|$|Water powered bellows for <b>blast</b> <b>furnaces,</b> used in China {{in ancient}} times, were {{in use in}} Europe by the 15th century. De re Metallica {{contains}} drawings related to bellows for <b>blast</b> <b>furnaces</b> including a fabrication drawing.|$|R
5|$|While {{acting as}} {{administrator}} of Nanyang in 31 CE, Du Shi (d. 38 CE) invented a water-powered reciprocator which worked the bellows of the <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> and cupola furnace in smelting iron; before this invention, intensive manual labor {{was required to}} work the bellows.|$|E
5|$|Cahya Mata Sarawak Berhad (CMSB), one of {{the largest}} {{publicly}} traded companies in Sarawak, set up a cement plant in Bintulu at Kidurong Industrial Estate. The plant, manned by 40 people, produces ordinary Portland cement and Portland <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> cement. It currently has a combined production capacity of 2.75 million MT (million tonnes).|$|E
5|$|Cupola furnace: American {{anthropologist}} Vincent C. Pigott of the University of Pennsylvania {{states that}} the cupola furnace existed in China at least by the Warring States period (403–221 BC), while Donald B. Wagner writes that some iron ore melted in the <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> may have been cast directly into molds, but most, if not all, iron smelted in the <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> during the Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD) was remelted in a cupola furnace; it was designed so that a cold blast injected at the bottom traveled through tuyere pipes across the top where the charge (i.e. of charcoal and scrap or pig iron) was dumped, the air becoming a hot blast before reaching {{the bottom of the}} furnace where the iron was melted and then drained into appropriate molds for casting.|$|E
50|$|The plant {{opened in}} 1866 with two <b>blast</b> <b>furnaces</b> in {{operation}} by 1867 with capacities of 60 and 80 tonnes per day. The works expanded {{with a third}} <b>blast</b> <b>furnaces</b> in 1871, a Gilchrist-Thomas converter in 1911, fourth, fifth and sixth <b>blast</b> <b>furnaces</b> in 1922, 1930 and 1949. After the merger with Cockerill-Ougrée the factory was transferred to Usinor in 1979, and in 1984 became part of Unimétal, before closing in 1987.|$|R
40|$|Aluminosilicate {{refractory}} grog {{are being}} manufactured by firing refractory clays, claystone and shale. Firing takes place mainly in rotary or <b>blast</b> <b>furnaces.</b> However, when adjusting {{the raw material}} before firing in <b>blast</b> <b>furnaces,</b> {{the formation of the}} fine clay particles takes place. It is not possible to fire the fine particles in <b>blast</b> <b>furnaces</b> the usual way, which leads to the generation of waste. There is a possibility, however, to form briquettes of these particles, which can be fired in <b>blast</b> <b>furnaces.</b> This solution also brings the possibility of adjusting the mixture by using correction raw materials or other types of clay. Using this method, it is possible to produce a special refractory grog with specific properties...|$|R
50|$|In 1920 the new Pâtural <b>blast</b> <b>furnaces</b> at Hayange were {{equipped}} with McKee revolving distributors.From 1919 to 1928 the old <b>blast</b> <b>furnaces</b> at Hayange were completely rebuilt to modern plans.Four <b>blast</b> <b>furnaces</b> were rebuilt, {{two of them}} 300 tons.From 1927 to 1930 the Fenderie factory was rebuilt, with the Martin furnaces expanded.Several times de Wendel sent teams of engineers to the US and Canada to observe the experiments with new processes for continuous strip rolling, and the solutions that were eventually adopted.|$|R

5|$|The blast {{furnaces}} {{used in the}} Imperial Smelting Process ("ISP") were developed from the standard lead <b>blast</b> <b>furnace,</b> but are fully sealed. This is because the zinc produced by these furnaces is recovered as metal from the vapor phase, {{and the presence of}} oxygen in the off-gas would result in the formation of zinc oxide.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> {{still stands}} in Lake Oswego's George Rogers Park along the Willamette River, the only extant iron furnace {{west of the}} Rocky Mountains. It {{was placed on the}} National Register of Historic Places in 1974. In 2010, a seven-year restoration of the furnace was completed.|$|E
50|$|Wendel {{undertook}} considerable {{development of}} the metallurgical facilities.He was {{particularly interested in the}} mines and <b>blast</b> <b>furnaces,</b> but made sure that all aspects were considered.Between 1908 and 1913 he built the new Pâtural plant at Hayange using American concepts such as <b>blast</b> <b>furnaces</b> with armoured shafts and skip chargers.|$|R

5|$|The {{production}} of iron or steel {{is a process}} consisting of two main stages. In the first stage pig iron is produced in a <b>blast</b> <b>furnace.</b> Alternatively, it may be directly reduced. In the second stage, pig iron is converted to wrought iron, steel, or cast iron.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two main}} ways of doing this: a {{two-stage}} process involving roasting followed by <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> extraction, carried out in separate vessels; or a direct {{process in which the}} extraction of the concentrate occurs in a single vessel. The latter has become the most common route, though the former is still significant.|$|E
5|$|At the Jock River, {{southwest}} of Barrhaven, deposits of sensitive leda clay presented {{a challenge in}} designing the crossing for the freeway {{as well as the}} Canadian National Railway overpass to the north. It was feared that the weight of these structures could destabilize the clay deposits beneath and lead to landslides. In place of the standard heavier aggregate, lighter <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> slag, at half the weight, was substituted.|$|E

50|$|In the 1970s as {{a result}} of the steel crisis the mines and many of the <b>blast</b> <b>furnaces</b> were shut down, the last one, in Esch-Belval, {{definitely}} halting its operations in 1997. The <b>blast</b> <b>furnaces</b> were replaced by an electric furnace that is fed with scrap metal rather than iron ore.|$|R
5|$|For the {{production}} of ferromanganese, the manganese ore is mixed with iron ore and carbon, and then reduced either in a <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> or in an electric arc furnace. The resulting ferromanganese has a manganese content of 30 to 80%. Pure manganese used for {{the production}} of iron-free alloys is produced by leaching manganese ore with sulfuric acid and a subsequent electrowinning process.|$|E
5|$|Recent evidence,shows that bloomeries {{were used}} in China, {{migrating}} in from the west as early as 800 BC, before being supplanted by the locally developed <b>blast</b> <b>furnace.</b> Supporting this theory was the discovery of 'more than ten' iron digging implements found in the tomb of Duke Jing of Qin (d. 537 BCE), whose tomb is located in Fengxiang County, Shaanxi (a museum exists on the site today).|$|E
5|$|Stone wool or {{rock wool}} is a spun mineral fibre {{used as an}} {{insulation}} product and in hydroponics. It is manufactured in a <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> fed with diabase rock which contains very low levels of metal oxides. The resultant slag is drawn off and spun to form the rock wool product. Very small amounts of metals are also produced which are an unwanted by-product and run to waste.|$|E
