The Beatles included his face on the cover of Sgt.

Stockhausen's name, and the perceived strangeness and supposed unlistenability of his music, was even a punchline in cartoons, as documented on a page on the official Stockhausen web site (...)

New Year's Day 1835, Andersen wrote to a friend: [...] "I am now starting on some 'fairy tales for children.'

[...] Andersen had finished the tales by March 1835 and told Admiral Wulff's daughter, Henriette: [...] "I have also written some fairy tales for children; Ørsted says about them that if The Improvisatore makes me famous then these will make me immortal, for they are the most perfect things I have written; but I myself do not think so."

500|$|The trial {{issues of}} Science Fiction Stories in 1953 and 1954 were {{competent}} but unremarkable, with stories by some popular writers, such as Poul Anderson, Algis Budrys, and Philip K.

[...] During the period when Science Fiction Stories was monthly, it carried serialized novels, including de Camp's The Tower of Zanid and Ward Moore and Robert Bradford's Caduceus Wild. [...] It also published [...] "Genius Loci", described by Ashley as one of Thomas N. Scortia's best short stories. [...] Some well-received stories did appear in Future {{towards the end of}} the decade, including [...] "Vulcan's Hammer", an early novella version of Philip K. Dick's novel of the same name; Clifford D. Simak's [...] "Worlds Without End"; and Judith Merril's [...] "Homecalling", reprinted in the 1960s in SF Impulse, whose editor, Kyril Bonfiglioli, commented [...] "I don't <b>believe</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> ever read a more successful attempt to imagine an utterly alien way of thought." [...] Lowndes did what he could to provide interesting non-fiction departments: a book review column was started in the early 1950s, and the end of the decade saw a series of science articles written by Isaac Asimov, and critical articles on science fiction history, written by Lowndes himself. [...] R.A. Lafferty's first story appeared in Science Fiction Stories in the January 1960 issue, shortly before the magazine was closed down. [...] The budget for both magazines, never very great, shrank even further towards the end, so that Lowndes had to fill space with reprints and re-use old illustrations to avoid paying for new stories and artwork.|$|E
