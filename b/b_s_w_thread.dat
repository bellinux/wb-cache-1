In the <b>B.</b> <b>S.</b> <b>W.</b> - nozzle system, the dissociation of CO 2 or N 2 molecules of the gas is suppressed even if the gas behind the <b>B.</b> <b>S.</b> <b>W.</b> is heated up to 2, 000 - 5, 000 K, since the gas is cooled rapidly, expanding through the nozzle. Numerical calculations for such flow fields lead us to the estimation of the capability and the optimum conditions of such G. D. Ls [...] It is turned out in our system that the mole-fractions of CO 2 can be elevated to 20 %, and the small signal gain coefficients increase more than four or five times (3. 8 m- 1) than those of conventional G. D. Ls [...] Numerical estimations of the laser power output are also examined for both cases of CW and Q-switch operations...|$|R

The many interesting features connected with the mineralization and the geology of the mine, and the possibility of this type of deposit becoming of economic importance due to the increased value of gold, led the writer to undertake an extensive study of the area. During the winter, 1934 - 1935, laboratory work was carried out at McGill University. To collect additional data a month was spent in the area during the autumn of 1935. Parts of the mine workings and surface outcrops were re-examined, and much of the diamond drill core was re-logged at that time. In addition observations were made over about 30 square miles of the surrounding area...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} {{the reliability and validity}} of a rating checklist for student process-recorded interviews in an effort to provide field education with an empirically sound feedback and evaluation tool. A stratified, nonproportional sample of practitioner-field instructors (n = 57) from <b>B.</b> <b>S.</b> <b>W.,</b> first- and second-year M. <b>S.</b> <b>W.</b> field programs at three universities evaluated process-recorded interviews of their own students, as well as anonymous student work. The checklist was a highly consistent (r =. 96) and unbiased measurement tool. The checklist also was shown to have content, concurrent, and predictive validity. A rationale and suggestions for its use in field education is presented. Field-based instruction in social work is a key component of curriculum and is identified by students as a powerful learning experience. Yet development of specific educational technology for field instruction has lagged behind that for the classroom. An example is the continued requirement as a part of practicum for process recordings of student-conducted interviews as evi-dence of performance and a basis for teaching-learning exchanges, with no demonstrably reliable or valid evaluation tool accompanying such use. Such a tool could enhance field teaching by providing a common framework for evaluation and feedback concerning selected aspects of performance, and a more objective basis for reaching conclusions about demonstrated level o...|$|R

Supervisory variables such as administrative capability, effective use of time, and relationships were positively correlated with work environment variables such as order and organization, clarity, cohesiveness and support, and with treatment environment variables such as innovation, spontaneity, anger -and aggression. Conflicts in the supervisory relationship were correlated with a controlling and unsupportive work environment. The use of technology was perceived as limiting the clients 2 ̆ 7 autonomy. While some logical influences were drawn concerning the direction of these correlations and the possible paths these create, {{further research is needed}} in order to address the direction of these correlations.
