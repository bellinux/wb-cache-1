25|$|On {{the morning}} of 20 May, Gamelin ordered the armies trapped in Belgium and {{northern}} France to fight their way south and link up with French forces attacking northwards from the Somme river. On the evening of 19 May, the French Prime Minister, Paul Reynaud had sacked Gamelin and replaced him with Maxime Weygand, who claimed his first mission as Commander-in-Chief would <b>be</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a good night's sleep. Gamelin's orders were cancelled and Weygand took several days during the crisis, to make courtesy visits in Paris. Weygand proposed a counter-offensive by the armies trapped in the north combined with an attack by French forces on the Somme front, the new French 3rd Army Group (General Antoine-Marie-Benoît Besson).|$|E
500|$|Stewart felt betrayed: [...] "It {{has been}} my fight ever since I became a {{minister}} {{to see that the}} farmers of the province were having a square deal," [...] he remarked, [...] "and I think I have done this with some success." [...] Despite his general sympathy with the aims of the UFA, he could not support their transition into a political party. For one, he disagreed with the UFA's belief that politics should be conducted along class, rather than ideological, lines. [...] Stewart believed that [...] "the more strongly armed the classes become the harder will it <b>be</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the things we really need in our government" [...] and asserted that [...] "I never did and never will have any desire to form a coalition with anybody except with men who think the same as I do." ...|$|E
500|$|Bush {{was fond}} of saying that [...] "if he made any {{important}} contribution {{to the war effort}} at all, it would <b>be</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the Army and Navy to tell each other what they were doing." [...] He established a cordial relationship with Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson, and Stimson's assistant, Harvey H. Bundy, who found Bush [...] "impatient" [...] and [...] "vain", but said he was [...] "one of the most important, able men I ever knew". Bush's relationship with the navy was more turbulent. Bowen, the director of the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL), saw the NDRC as a bureaucratic rival, and recommended abolishing it. A series of bureaucratic battles ended with the NRL placed under the Bureau of Ships, and Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox placing an unsatisfactory fitness report in Bowen's personnel file. After the war, Bowen would again try to create a rival to the NDRC inside the navy.|$|E

500|$|The Boston Globe {{believed}} that a ruling on the legality of DFS in New York State would have industry-wide implications, as {{it is one of}} the largest markets for these services. Writing for The New Yorker, James Surowiecki {{believed that}} it was hypocritical for the state of New York to campaign against daily fantasy sports—which, in an op-ed, the Attorney General classified as a [...] "particularly pernicious" [...] activity, as the state already sponsors and/or endorses other forms of legal gambling based purely on chance rather than a mix of chance and skill, such as the state lottery, casinos, and horse racing. Surowiecki argued that [...] "given the absence of a good argument for why daily fantasy should be illegal in New York, while the lottery and racetrack betting and casinos are not, the best strategy that DraftKings and FanDuel could pursue might <b>be</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the State Legislature to eliminate the inconsistency and explicitly legalize them." ...|$|E
500|$|Although Churchill's, {{described}} by Lewington as [...] "the worst club {{that has ever}} been in Reading", tolerated such behaviour, the town's fashionable Sindlesham Mill nightclub did not, regularly barring Friday for his bizarre activities, including a dance he invented called [...] "the elephant" [...] which consisted of turning {{the pockets of his}} jeans inside out and undoing his flies to expose himself. He and his friends would regularly drink all day, though he was able to exert some self-control; according to his friend Syd Simmonds, Friday would obey Hurley's instruction not to drink for 48 hours before each game. However, he would play his prized heavy metal records very loudly at any time of the day or night and take LSD with casual indifference. Hurley attempted to calm Friday down by moving him into an apartment above the football club's elderly ex-groundsman, but to no avail: [...] "Even if it was three in the morning, the first thing would <b>be</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the music playing", Simmonds later said. [...] "We had an old boy living below us ... the ex-groundsman at Reading. He was coming up to 80 and he had a dog's life in the flat. Pounding music, people knocking on the door, girls throwing stones at the windows. Poor old sod." ...|$|E

On the other hand, our preference would <b>be</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a shelter dog, but, obviously, a lot of shelter dogs are mutts like me.

Griffin reassured newsmen {{that there was no}} indication of any unusual activity {{on the part of the}} Chinese Communists, but added that the motto of the Fleet was readiness and in the event of any threat the Fleet was ready to strike; in particular, should any submarine make any hostile move against the President and his escort force, he would do his best to destroy it.

2500|$|The Port Authority {{commissioned}} the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (CoE) {{to conduct a}} study of the question, which was completed in 2009, and authorized up to $10 million for planning and engineering services to develop options to deal with the bridge's low clearance. The CoE study looked at three options for the bridge, besides the no-build option. The quickest option they identified, and the one ultimately chosen, was a $1.32 billion project to raise the bridge's roadway to increase its height by 40 percent, which could be accomplished by 2019 at the earliest. It would need a clearance of [...] to handle the new ships. Another option presented was to build a new cable-stayed bridge, which would have cost $2.15 billion and taken until 2022. The most expensive option would <b>be</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> rid of the bridge altogether and replace it with either a bored tunnel or a immersed tunnel through which traffic would traverse under the Kill Van Kull. This option would have taken the longest, being complete in 2024 and costing $2.2 to $3 billion. In initial planning documents, a vertical-lift bridge was also considered, but this was not investigated further in the CoE study.|$|E
