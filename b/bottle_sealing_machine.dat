40|$|We {{describe}} a laser-based, non-contact sealing technique for thin, polyester-based lidding films, used in PET containers for food packaging. The method uses a beam-steered laser {{to seal the}} container, thereby enabling virtually instant change over from one product line to another. Unlike conventional sealing PET film processes, no bespoke tooling is required to hold the package components in close proximity and under pressure whilst the seal is formed. This greatly reduces <b>sealing</b> <b>machine</b> tooling costs and potential downtime at product changeovers. Results are presented that show that the process is able to produce seals of higher strength using thin (26 µm) polyester film than those from the conventional thermal/mechanical process. This provides a potential for increased production flexibility, reduction in product wastage, and for reducing the cost and embodied energy in construction of a less massive <b>sealing</b> <b>machine...</b>|$|R

40|$|This work {{studied the}} {{volatile}} composition and sensory properties of red wines after packaging under different configurations: bag-in-box (BIB) and glass <b>bottles</b> <b>sealed</b> with natural cork stoppers. The experiments {{were carried out}} {{over a period of}} 12 months and analysis were performed at initial time (just before packaging) and after 3, 6 and 12 months of storage. Volatile compounds composition was determined by two different analytical techniques which combined headspace solid-phase micro- extraction (HS-SPME) with gas chromatography-ion trap/mass spectrometry (GC-IT/MS). Sensory analysis and other enological parameters, such as free and total SO 2 and color intensity, were also monitored. Results showed that, after one year of storage, BIB wines were characterized by higher levels of several carbonyl compounds when compared to bottled wines. Moreover, <b>bottled</b> wines <b>sealed</b> with cork stoppers retained much more free and total SO 2 than wines in BIB. In addition, the premature wine development under BIB was confirmed by sensory analyses. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

5000|$|Oronamin C was {{introduced}} in February 1965 and was initially sold in a 120 ml glass <b>bottle</b> <b>sealed</b> with a <b>bottle</b> cap.

It is not only available in supermarkets and convenience stores in Japan, but also in Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co. vending machines as well. The bottle cap was briefly replaced with a screw bottle cap, but following a nationwide scare during the 1980s regarding a large number of poisoned <b>sealed</b> <b>bottled</b> beverages, this screw cap was replaced with a one-time [...] "pull-cap," [...] which cannot be re-sealed after opening.

What unfolds in this paper is a fascinating story of a product that on many performance attributes outperforms the cork seal, but has so far failed to gain mainstream market acceptance from retailers and end consumers. Although there have been scores of articles in wine and food magazines that have discussed the merits of cork versus alternative seals, we are not aware of any literature that has evaluated the contest through the lenses of innovation theory. In so doing this paper analyses why the initial product launch of the screw top was unsuccessful and why the recent second attempt may indeed be a turning point for the screw top wine <b>bottle</b> <b>seal.</b> The paper is divided into five sections. Section one provides a brief overview of the nature and history of cork as a wine seal. The growing dissatisfaction with cork as a wine seal is outlined in section two. Section three provides the background to the development of the screw top wine seal and its launch in Australia. In section four we explore with the aid of technology adoption innovation theory why the launch was a failure. We then outline in section five the second recent attempt by Australian wine makers to gain market acceptance for the screw top. We will see in this section there are a number of factors that have changed between the first launch and the second launch. Section six focuses on the question as to whether the second attack on {{the industry standard}} will be successful. We conclude that innovation theory can both explain why the first launch failed and why the second launch may indeed be successful in the long run. In particular, Moore's (2001) adaptation of the technology adoption life cycle model, although originally developed from experience in hi-tech industries, aided in understanding the key reasons for the initial failure of the screw cap and also in predicting the early success of the screw cap's second attack...|$|R
