However, under Grainge v Wilberforce, such a sub-trust will only be held to be valid if there is some difference between the trust and sub-trust, and if the trustee-beneficiary has some duties to perform.|$|E
25|$|Following his judgment, Richard Mawrey ordered Lutfur Rahman {{to pay the}} petitioners' {{costs to}} be {{assessed}} on the standard basis if not agreed between the parties. An order for an interim payment of £250,000 to be paid within 14 days was also made pending agreement or assessment of costs, estimated at £500,000. Rahman was also ordered to pay the costs of John Williams, the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Metropolitan Police, and expenses incurred in the hosting of the election court. As {{a result of the}} cost order, Andy Erlam obtained interim charging orders on two investment properties registered solely in Rahman's name as security for the judgment debt. Rahman's wife Ayesha Farid filed objection to the charging orders claiming absolute <b>beneficial</b> <b>interest</b> on one of the two property, and 74% <b>beneficial</b> <b>interest</b> in the other. Despite the objection, Erlam was able to obtain a final charging order on the second property on 29 June 2015. Additionally, an interim charging order was then secured against a property registered solely in Farid's name on the argument that Rahman has a <b>beneficial</b> <b>interest</b> in it.|$|E

500|$|For {{disposing}} of existing equitable interests, the Law of Property Act 1925 provides in Section 53(1)(c) that: [...] Much {{of the debate}} {{in this area is}} over the definition of [...] "disposition", and unsurprisingly almost all of the cases involve people trying to avoid tax.

5000|$|In the United States and England, a {{practice}} developed whereby trust settlors {{began to use}} [...] "spendthrift" [...] clauses to prevent trust beneficiaries from alienating their <b>beneficial</b> <b>interests</b> to creditors. Over time, courts were asked to determine the efficacy of spendthrift clauses as against the trust beneficiaries seeking to engage in such assignments, and the creditors of those beneficiaries seeking to reach trust assets. A case law doctrine developed whereby courts may generally recognize the efficacy of spendthrift clauses as against trust beneficiaries and their creditors, but not against creditors of a settlor.|$|R
2500|$|A {{constructive}} trust is a trust which is {{imposed by the}} courts whenever the defendant knows that he has dealt with property in an [...] "unconscionable manner", such as stealing it, possessing it via fraud, and accepting a bribe while in occupation of a fiduciary office. The {{constructive trust}} is intended to take the property from the defendant's control, preventing them from causing additional harm with it. It thus acts regardless of the parties' intentions. In Paragon Finance plc v DB Thakerar & Co, Millet LJ defined a constructive trust as a trust which [...] "arises by operation of law whenever the circumstances are such {{that it would be}} unconscionable for the owner of property (usually but not necessarily the legal estate) to assert his own <b>beneficial</b> <b>interest</b> in the property and deny the <b>beneficial</b> <b>interest</b> of another". Essentially, a constructive trust will arise whenever an owner either ignores, or interferes, with the rights of another person with an interest in that property. There is a distinction between personal and proprietary rights to property. A constructive trust normally gives a proprietary right to the beneficiary that can be enforced on any other person. The alternative (a personal right) merely gives the beneficiary the right to recover money equivalent to the value of the property.|$|E
2500|$|The {{theoretical}} {{justification for}} resolving trusts was discussed by the Privy Council, in Air Jamaica v Charlton, where Lord Millet said that [...] "Like a constructive trust, a resulting trust arises by operation of law, though unlike a constructive trust it gives effect to intention. But it arises {{whether or not}} the transferor intended to retain a <b>beneficial</b> <b>interest</b> - he almost always does not - since it responds to the absence of any intention on his part to pass a <b>beneficial</b> <b>interest</b> to the recipient". Resulting trusts were intended to fill in the gap left by a veiled transfer, obeying the equitable maxim that [...] "equity will not suffer a wrong to be without a remedy". In Westdeutsche Landesbank, Browne-Wilkinson stated that resulting trusts [...] "are traditionally regarded as examples of trusts giving effect to the common intention of the parties. A resulting trust is not imposed by law against the intentions of the trustee (as in a constructive trust) but gives effect to his presumed intention". Alastair Hudson, Professor of Equity and Law at Queen Mary, University of London, argues that Browne-Wilkinson's theory is flawed, primarily because if the trust can not be enforced against the trustee's wishes, it is a form of constructive trust. Much of the case law is instead based on Megarry's classification.|$|E
2500|$|In common-law countries, {{equitable}} liens {{give rise}} to unique and difficult issues. [...] An equitable lien is a non-possessory security right conferred by operation of law, which is similar in effect to an equitable charge. [...] It differs from a charge {{in that it is}} non-consensual. [...] It is conferred only in very limited circumstances, the most common (and least ambiguous) of which is in relation to the sale of land; an unpaid vendor has an equitable lien over the land for the purchase price, notwithstanding that the purchaser has gone into occupation of the property. [...] It is seen as a counterweight to the equitable rule which confers a <b>beneficial</b> <b>interest</b> in the land on the purchaser once contracts are exchanged for purchase.|$|E

2500|$|Most {{states have}} {{property}} laws that allow a trust agreement {{to contain a}} legally enforceable restriction on the transfer of a <b>beneficial</b> <b>interest</b> in the trust (sometimes known as an [...] "anti-alienation provision"). The anti-alienation provision generally prevents creditors of a beneficiary from acquiring the beneficiary's share of the trust. Such a trust is sometimes called a spendthrift trust. To prevent fraud, most states allow this protection {{only to the extent}} that the beneficiary did not transfer property to the trust. Also, such provisions do not protect cash or other property once it has been transferred from the trust to the beneficiary. Under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, an anti-alienation provision in a spendthrift trust is recognized. This means that the beneficiary's share of the trust generally does not become property of the bankruptcy estate.|$|E
