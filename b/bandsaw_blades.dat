30|$|The {{validity}} of a bandsaw roll-tensioning theory {{developed by the}} author is verified based on a model experiment. It is shown that the actual roll-tensioning process can be clearly explained by this theory. Roll-stretching force transmission coefficients are introduced in this theory. These coefficients, which indicate {{the magnitude of the}} compression force parallel to the bandsaw surface at the roll-stretching position, are affected by the thickness of the <b>bandsaw</b> <b>blade,</b> the radius of the <b>bandsaw</b> <b>blade</b> vent at the measurement of tension, and the straightness of the <b>bandsaw</b> <b>blade</b> at the measurement of crown back, among others. For the practical use of this theory, therefore, it is necessary to determine the proper magnitude of these coefficients based on tensioning experiments.|$|R
30|$|Bandsaw roll-tensioning was {{theoretically}} {{analyzed by}} amplifying Aoyama's fundamental equations. In the analysis the accumulated amount of tension after several roll-stretching passes was expressed as the linear accumulation {{of the amount}} of tension at each roll-stretching pass. The same condition was applied for the expression of the accumulated amount of crown back. The relations between the distance from the gullet in the transverse direction of the <b>bandsaw</b> <b>blade</b> to the roll-stretching point and the distance from the gullet in the transverse direction of the <b>bandsaw</b> <b>blade</b> at which the amount of tension becomes maximum, minimum, or zero were clarified. To meet the requisites to adjust the amount of tension at an arbitrary distance in the transverse direction of the <b>bandsaw</b> <b>blade</b> or the amount of crown back, an adjusting procedure was developed. The process of bandsaw roll-tensioning can theoretically be controlled by this procedure.|$|R

5000|$|Wider {{material}} can be flat rolled with the rolls tilting {{such that the}} [...] "short" [...] edge is lengthened, with thickness slightly reduced, to equal the [...] "long" [...] edge. The material is then straight if properly processed. Several different types of these machines are available, ranging from position controlled to pressure controlled machines. Also, machines are available with automatic self checking features. If the material has residual stress as in toothed <b>bandsaw</b> <b>blades,</b> the rolls must not uniformly apply cross strain, as the inherent strain will distort the strip. In these cases, rolls exert corrective strain in a linear narrow strip inboard of the edge each side. In the case of sawblades with teeth on, the corrective squeezed strip on the toothed edge is located along the tooth gullet, and corrective squeeze on the toothed side must be about 2.5 times the corrective force on the plain edge.|$|E

Mershon and Company in Saginaw that {{manufactured}} <b>bandsaw</b> <b>blades</b> which his father was attributed with inventing. Mershon {{was a member of}} the national guard, the parks and recreation committee and was mayor of Saginaw in 1894/5. For two years he was a state forester and he was an associate life member of the American Ornithologists' Union and here his interests enabled him to gather together the material from a number of sources to publish a volume on the passenger pigeon in 1907. The book on the passenger pigeon was published several years after the last of this once endemic bird was last killed (in 1900) and before the last died in captivity in an American zoo. In 1909, the American Ornithologist's Union offered a prize for any wild bird or nest found but to no avail. The book contains contributions by a number of writers.|$|E

50|$|Many {{makers of}} ringsaws offer a similar <b>blade</b> as a <b>bandsaw</b> too. The ringsaw blade in {{comparison}} {{may be made}} rigid, thus stronger and less flexible under cutting loads, giving a more accurate cut. Some make a particular feature of the ring saw's ability to cut forwards, backwards and sideways. As the <b>bandsaw</b> <b>blade</b> must be flexible enough to pass around the wheels, its blades are limited to cutting on the forward edge. The oblong <b>bandsaw</b> has a <b>blade</b> that is supported on two large wheels. The interval between the two wheels is supported by blade guides immediately behind the cutting zone. Ring saws {{do not have the}} same straight run of blade, nor the opportunity to support much of the blade as with the wheels of a bandsaw. A ring saw is thus a somewhat fragile machine and excess pressure on a thin blade is likely to damage it.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this mechanical design project was to improve the current design of large and heavy solar concentrators. The three main design goals were: making the system compact, making the system lightweight, and minimizing expenses. The main approach to achieving these design parameters was to use the plastic film Mylar in its aluminized form to create a paraboloid serving as a solar concentrator. The scope of design was limited to designing and prototyping the solar concentrator, and neglecting to design and prototype the container in which it should be kept while in its compact form. Two designs-the tube design and the rim design-are examined, although the rim design is emphasized because of its advantages over the tube design. The tube design included a bicycle tire tube serving as the structural element of the solar concentrator, while the rim design utilized a <b>bandsaw</b> <b>blade</b> (without teeth) as the structural element of the solar concentrator. The prototype of the rim design proved to work well as a mirror, although further work, such as improving the seal around the rim, must still be done due to the time frame and resources allowed for this project. by Gabriel J Gonz√°lez.

40|$|Bandsawing is a {{preferred}} method used by steel stockholders and steel users in industry for cutting-off to {{size in the}} primary and secondary processes. The state-of- the-art features in current industrial bandsaw machines have transformed this method for cutting-off stock to size into a hi-tech operation capable of storage and handling. This method is particularly suitable for use in engineering factories involved in fast, highly automated mass-production techniques, providing the user with continuous batches of cut-to-length materials. Bandsaw machines have now superseded power hacksaws and circular saws in cutting rate and lower kerf loss due to better computer- controlled saw machines and improved blade designs (bi-metal HSS, carbide tipped). Although, {{there have been some}} new developments in <b>bandsaw</b> <b>blades</b> (tooth geometry, band material etc.) there are continuous new demands made on the <b>bandsaw</b> <b>blades</b> by materials engineers, challenged with introducing new materials to satisfy the needs of the design engineers, e. g. aerospace industry. There is therefore a need to improve the bandsaw blade. In order to do this we need to have an understanding of the mechanics of the cutting process associated with bandsawing and the various parameters affecting cutting forces, specific cutting energy, metal removal rates etc. One of the primary problems in evaluating metal bandsaws and developing newer variants, including new saw tooth materials, their heat treatment, or special tooth forms and quality, has been the use of costly and time consuming sawing tests. Furthermore, there are no simple ways of quantitatively evaluating the performance and life of these bands during sawing. Traditional method used by machine operators to assess the performance of blades only give global data, which is difficult to apply to individual teeth. Therefore {{there is a need to}} develop "time compression" test methods for evaluating the performance of <b>bandsaw</b> <b>blades</b> to replace full bandsaw blade testing. The work presented in this thesis is on the development of a single tooth testing method to simulate the intermittent cutting action of a bandsaw blade. Cutting tests have been performed to assess the testing method by comparing single tooth test results to full bandsaw blade test results. The test method developed is capable of producing scientific data for bandsawing associated with forces, metal removal rate and specific cutting energy when cutting a variety of workpiece materials at different speeds and feeds. Thus, it can be used as a substitute to full bandsaw blade testing. The cutting data for the workpiece materials tested using the single tooth test method was obtained in 25 % of the full bandsaw blade evaluation time. This represents a significant saving in time and cost, which should prove useful to design engineers when designing and testing new prototype <b>bandsaw</b> <b>blades</b> for the future needs of the steel and manufacturing industry involved in metal cutting.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} {{experimental}} data associated with forces, power and specific cutting energy associated with wear of high-speed steel bimetal <b>bandsaw</b> <b>blades</b> cutting 17 - 7 {{austenitic stainless steel}} bars. Several different methods of assessing the wear modes and mechanisms have been previously reported, further work has been undertaken in the above area to relate wear with quantified parameters of forces and specific cutting energy. For bandsawing of austenitic stainless steel, the major wear mode {{is associated with the}} rounding of the cutting edge and forming of a worn flank. The change in cutting edge geometry leads to an increase in cutting forces and hence changes to the specific cutting energy. Furthermore, the cutting edge radius increases as the wear progresses causing metal removal to take place by a combination of ploughing and discontinuous chip formation. The wear modes are reflected in the cutting force ratio which approaches ‚àº 1 for full ploughing and an increasing specific cutting energy...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{investigate}} the vibrational characteristics of wide band bandsaws. Firstly, the vibration of bandsaw structures was considered. A computer program was developed to predict the natural frequencies and mode shapes of three dimensional structures, consisting of beams, springs, viscous dampers, concentrated masses, and gyroscopic rotors. The method used was the dynamic stiffness method. Some of the vibrational characteristics of the bandsaw structure were then established from experimental results and results obtained from the computer program. The gyroscopic effects on the bandsaw structure due to rotating pulleys were also examined. Secondly, the dynamic stiffness method was used to solve the moving beam problem. The moving beam had been used previously to model the bandsaw blade. The dynamic stiffness method allowed complex problems to be analysed in a systematic manner. A moving beam proved to be too crude a representation of a wide bandsaw blade at the level of detail being investigated. Therefore, attempts were made to model the dynamic behaviour of wide <b>bandsaw</b> <b>blades</b> with moving plates. A general approach to the solution of the moving plate problem is presented in this thesis, it uses the extended Galerkin method to discretise the partial differential equation of motion and the boundary conditions into a quadratic eigenvalue problem. The solutions for this problem were obtained by using a linearisation technique. The effects of in-plane stresses on <b>bandsaw</b> <b>blades</b> are considered in this thesis. Three cases are examined; a linearly distributed stress across the width of the blade due to wheel-tilting and/or backcrowning, a parabolic distributed stress across the width of the blade due to prestressing, and stresses induced by tangential cutting forces. Parametric instabilities due to fluctuating tension, and due to periodic tangential cutting forces were investigated. The harmonic balance method was used on the discretised form of the moving plate equation to obtain the required instability regions. Finally, the dynamic instability of a moving plate due to a nonconservative component of the tangential cutting force was considered. The method of solving this nonconservative problem was the same as that used to solve the conservative case...|$|E
50|$|Power tools, {{machinery}} and other potentially dangerous equipment is typically manufactured with the right-handed user in mind. Common {{problems faced by}} left-handed operators include the inability to keep materials steady, and difficulty reaching the on/off switch, especially in emergency situations. Table saws, whose blades protrude {{from the top of}} a table and pose the risk of losing fingers or hands, have their cutting area on the right side. This makes it difficult for a left-handed operator to guide the material being cut, as it must be pushed to the right side to align with the fence to avoid kickback. On <b>bandsaws,</b> the <b>blade</b> teeth are {{on the left side of}} the blade, necessitating the material being cut to be pushed from the left side of the machine. However, at this angle, the casing of the machine containing the rest of the blade is on the operator's left side, making it extremely difficult to guide the wood with their left hand.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{high-carbon}} steel strips {{are one of}} the most widely used base materials of bandsaw blade manufacturing. These materials have sufficient strength and ductility to cope with the high fatigue load of the <b>bandsaw</b> <b>blades.</b> These endless strips are produced by welding, and therefore the weld and the heat affected zone have different mechanical properties, like tensile strength and fatigue resistance, than the base material. These properties of the weld can be influenced by preheat and post weld heat treatment. Regarding to the latest industrial requirements, the application of laserbeam welding was examined to produce higher standard bandsaw blade. The laserbeam welded joints has lower heat input and narrower heat affected zone compared to metal inert gas (MIG) welding, which is currently used in bandsaw blade manufacturing. To assure the proper mechanical properties and sufficient resistance to fatigue, an examination was carried out to determine the effect of preheat temperature and post weld heat treatment time on the mechanical properties and fatigue behaviour of the laserbeam welded joint...|$|E
40|$|<b>Bandsaw</b> <b>blades</b> {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{commonly}} used tools of the wood cutting industry. Their base materials are mostly unalloyed or poorly Cr-alloyed tool steels. After the review of the handsaw blade's cyclic load characteristics, we present the typical failures, which can be, originate in it's cracking. With the use of these information an overall systematization has been set up by the bandsaw blade cracking types and its root causes. The main place of the failure is the weld and the heat-affected zone's area where the welding can failure or the lack of toughness can produce cracking. An other zone, where cracking may appear is the bandsaw blade's tooth gullet because it raises the stress intensity factor. Special material testing methods have been made to investigate the tooth gullet's notch sensitivity from the test results that a comparison of several bandsaw blade base material, are reviewed. With the use of the results a notch sensitivity rating system has been worked out, which can be used to rate different handsaw blade base material's notch sensitivity...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper reports {{experimental}} {{data on the}} wear of high-speed steel bimetal <b>bandsaw</b> <b>blades</b> cutting austenitic 17 - 7 stainless steel bars. Several different methods of assessing the wear modes and mechanisms are evaluated; Cutting and thrust force components, Set width, Kerf width, ‚ÄúOut-of-square ‚Äù cutting, Wear modes and mechanisms and Chip characteristics. The wear mode established in the current work when bandsawing austenitic stainless steel with a bimetal blade is flank and corner wear together with formation of a cutting edge radius. The cutting edge radius increases as the wear progresses, reaching 25 - 50 mm after 300 cut sections. The established wear mechanism for {{the initial stages of}} wear is mild adhesive wear of the flank surface together with built-up edge formation and break-down. As the wear reaches steady-state the mechanism is adhesive wear of the flank surface with tempering/softening of high-speed steel layers. When the wear reached the steady-state region the level of thrust and cutting force were equal and relatively high. The kerf width appears to be less than the total set width of the blade, meaning that there is compression of the set teeth as they pass through the kerf. There is segmented chip formation with an increasing amount of vibration as the teeth wear, probably due to the increasing size of cutting edge radius. This work should be of great interest to the tool designer and user associated with bandsaws...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{modelling}} and active control of narrow and wide <b>bandsaw</b> <b>blades,</b> with {{application to the}} sawmilling industry. Strings, beams and plates are considered in the modelling work, with advances made in the modelling of exogenous influences and multispan saw blades. Beams and plates are considered in the control work, with classical and optimal controllers considered. Importance is placed on closed-loop robustness with respect to parametric variation, closed-loop performance in vibration suppression and in providing a physically realisable solution to the control problem. In the string and beam work exogenous influences are modelled by pointwise and distributed forces, including; lateral stiffness, lateral damping and a "follower" force that comprises an in-line and a lateral component. Pointwise actuation and arbitrary disturbance forces as well as pointwise sensing are also included. Successful comparison with results of other contributors, as well as comprehensive experimental work, validates the modelling. The experimental validation also concentrates on system damping and the integration of sensing and actuation. The plate work considers the single-span cutting blade presented by other contributors, and extends it to include saw guides and partial-span cutting forces. These cutting forces include damping, stiffness and follower loads, and act over a partial length of the cutting edge. While this three span model is not experimentally verified, it is shown to produce credible results. The control work is in two parts. A comprehensive study of the robustness of various controllers with respect to translation speed and band tension is performed for the beam; theoretically and experimentally. The theory-practice gap was small regarding trends in robustness, but unmodelled effects such as the band weld degraded the agreement of absolute values at higher band speeds. Classical controllers were abandoned due to high frequency noise amplification, and a near optimal H‚àû loop shaping controller {{was found to be}} superior to others of its type and various H‚ÇÇ formulations. The plate work is entirely theoretical, but uses the same actuator and sensor dynamics that were successful in the beam work to maintain the physical feasability of the controllers. Both single span and multispan systems are considered, with the central cutting span of the blade being controlled via actuation and sensing of the upstream and downstream noncutting spans. Robustness studies were conducted, with satisfactory robustness achieved with respect to a large number of parameters. Furthermore, substantial increases in maximum allowable cutting loads were achieved, as well as reduced vibration energy. The control actuation used in this work is electromagnetic force, with eddy current sensors used to sense the blade position. A noncontacting collocated actuatorsensor was developed that, with appropriate control of the winding current, performed excellently in both the validation and control work. Further development of this could lead to a versatile tool in experimental vibration analysis and distributed systems control research and applications...|$|E
