25|$|Ecutek tuning on {{the other}} hand was the first company to {{manipulate}} and change shift points on the GTR in the TCM (Transmission Control Module) on automatic mode. This can be done at will by the driver. Ecutek also allows the driver to adjust launch control on the fly available with a wrap around boost gauge that can read over 20 PSI. Like COBB Tuning, Ecutek currently offers engine tuning on the ECU and TCM with different launch control software from LC1 up to LC5. Ecutek's RACEROM offers in addition Valet Mode, Per-Cylinder Fueling, RaceRom Launch Control, Speed Density, Map Switching, Enhanced Targeted <b>Boost</b> <b>Control,</b> Upshift boostspike prevention, Per-gear <b>boost</b> <b>control</b> limit, per-gear rev limits, RACEROM <b>Boost</b> <b>control,</b> MAF Left-Right Swap for Custom Intercoolers, Large Fuel Injector Support and Visual Knock Warning.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of their {{investigation}} of the accident, the CAB urged the FAA to mandate a redesign of the elevator <b>boost</b> <b>control,</b> so that the shift to manual mode could be easily carried out by the pilots, even when applying nose down pressure. The FAA replied that they had asked the manufacturer to incorporate procedural changes in the aircraft's flight manual, but did not require any design changes.|$|E
25|$|The Jupiter was {{designed}} during World War I by Roy Fedden of Cosmos Engineering. During the rapid downscaling of military spending after the war, Cosmos became bankrupt in 1920, and was eventually {{purchased by the}} Bristol Aeroplane Company on {{the strengths of the}} Jupiter design and the encouragement of the Air Ministry. The engine matured {{into one of the most}} reliable on the market. It was the first air-cooled engine to pass the Air Ministry full-throttle test, the first to be equipped with automatic <b>boost</b> <b>control,</b> and the first to be fitted to airliners.|$|E

50|$|High-pressure {{systems were}} further {{shaped by the}} aviation, automotive, and oil industries. Aircraft {{manufacturers}} such as Boeing developed seals for hydraulically <b>boosted</b> <b>control</b> systems in the 1940s, while automotive designers followed similar research for hydraulic suspension systems.

25|$|The first version, the Gladiator Mk I, was {{delivered}} from July 1936, becoming operational in January 1937. The Mk II soon followed, the main differences being {{a slightly more}} powerful Mercury VIIIAS engine with Hobson mixture control boxes and a partly automatic <b>boost</b> <b>control</b> carburettor, driving a Fairey fixed-pitch three-blade metal propeller, instead of the two-blade wooden one of the Mark I. All MK II Gladiators also carried Browning 0.303-inch machine guns (licence-manufactured by the BSA company in Birmingham) {{in place of the}} Vickers-Lewis combination of the MK I. A modified Mk II, the Sea Gladiator, was developed for the Fleet Air Arm (FAA), with an arrestor hook, catapult attachment points, a strengthened airframe and an underbelly fairing for a dinghy lifeboat, all for operations aboard aircraft carriers. Of the 98 aircraft built as, or converted to, Sea Gladiators, 54 were still in service by the outbreak of the Second World War.|$|E
2500|$|The P-51H {{used the}} new V-1650-9 engine, {{a version of}} the Merlin that {{included}} Simmons automatic supercharger <b>boost</b> <b>control</b> with water injection, allowing War Emergency Power as high as 2,218hp (1,500kW). Differences between the P-51D included lengthening the fuselage and increasing the height of the tailfin, which reduced the tendency to yaw. The canopy resembled the P-51D style, over a raised pilot's position. Service access to the guns and ammunition was also improved. With a new airframe several hundred pounds lighter, extra power, and a more streamlined radiator, the P-51H was faster than the P-51D, able to reach [...] at [...]|$|E
2500|$|The RB26DETT engine {{actually}} produced ~320PS, {{but it was}} unstated due to the Japanese car makers' [...] "gentlemen's agreement" [...] not {{to exceed}} 280PS (276hp). The engine was designed for ~500hp in racing trim, and then muzzled by the exhaust, boost restriction, and ECU. The electronic <b>boost</b> <b>control</b> had a small physical restriction in the control lines. It was marked in yellow so the new owner could remove it and enjoy a safe factory boost increase. After this increase the car would put out ~310hp (~230kW) and could do 0–100km/h in 4.7 seconds and quarter mile in 12.8 seconds.|$|E
50|$|This Paul Rivera-specified Fender guitar {{amplifier}} {{was introduced}} in 1982 to replace the Princeton Reverb. It was a completely different and significantly more powerful amplifier. Designed by Ed Jahns, it featured a built-in reverb, treble boost and mid <b>boost</b> <b>controls,</b> and a switchable lead (overdrive) effect. The Princeton Reverb II {{was removed from the}} Fender pricelist in 1986.|$|R
50|$|Mixer {{controls}} {{are similar to}} that of a mixing console. They consist of volume sliders or rotary controls that represent each individual source, which may be accompanied by balance and mute controls. Most interfaces provide a method of switching between playback (output) sources and recording (input) sources. Additional hardware or software may add other effects such as low-pass filters, distortion and <b>boost</b> <b>controls.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The Constellation's wing {{design was}} close {{to that of the}} P-38 Lightning, differing mostly in size. The triple tail kept the aircraft's height low enough to fit in {{existing}} hangars, while features included hydraulically <b>boosted</b> <b>controls</b> and a de-icing system used on wing and tail leading edges.

2500|$|The final {{production}} Mustang, the P-51H, embodied the experience gained {{in the development}} of the lightweight XP-51F and XP-51G aircraft. This aircraft, model NA-126, and, with minor differences, NA-129, came too late to participate in World War II, but it brought the development of the Mustang to a peak and was one of the fastest production piston-engine fighters to see service. The P-51H used the Merlin V-1650-9 engine, equipped with Simmons automatic <b>boost</b> <b>control</b> and water injection, allowing War Emergency Power as high as [...] Some of the weight savings inherited from the XP-51F and XP-51G were invested in lengthening the fuselage and increasing the height of the tailfin, greatly reducing the tendency to yaw, and in restoring the fuselage fuel tank. The canopy was changed back to more nearly resemble the P-51D style, over a somewhat raised pilot's position. Service access to the guns and ammunition was improved. The P-51H was designed to complement the P-47N as the primary aircraft for the invasion of Japan, and 2,000 were ordered to be built at the Inglewood plant. With the solution to the problem of yaw control, the P-51H was now considered a suitable candidate for testing as an aircraft carrier-based fighter; but with the end of the war, the testing was cut short, and production was halted after 555 aircraft were built. Although some P-51Hs were issued to operational units, none saw combat. One aircraft was given to the RAF for testing and evaluation. Serial number 44-64192 was re-serialed as BuNo 09064 and used by the U.S. Navy to test transonic airfoil designs, then returned to the Air National Guard in 1952. The P-51H was not used for combat in the Korean War despite its improved handling characteristics, due to the lack of experience with durability of the lighter airframe under combat conditions as well as limited numbers in the USAF inventory.|$|E
50|$|Standard wastegates {{have one}} port for {{attaching}} the <b>boost</b> <b>control</b> {{line from the}} charge air supply line or <b>boost</b> <b>control</b> solenoid. Recent advances in internal wastegate actuators bring dual port control.|$|E
5000|$|Also to {{be noted}} {{is the way}} in which <b>boost</b> <b>control</b> is achieved, {{depending}} on the type of wastegate used. Typically manual [...] "bleed type" [...] boost controllers are only used on swing type (single port) wastegate actuators. To increase boost, pressure is taken away from the actuator control line, therefore increasing boost. Dual port swing type wastegate actuators and external wastegates generally require electronic <b>boost</b> <b>control</b> although adjustable <b>boost</b> <b>control</b> can also be achieved on both of these with an air pressure regulator, this is not the same as a bleed type boost controller. To increase boost with an external or dual port wastegate, pressure is added to the top control port to increase boost. When <b>boost</b> <b>control</b> is not fitted, this control port is open to the atmosphere.|$|E

50|$|On 14 May 1953, after Joseph Stalin's death, the Sukhoi OKB was reopened {{and by the}} summer, {{it began}} work on a swept-wing front-line fighter. The first prototype, {{designated}} S-1, was designed {{to use the new}} Lyulka AL-7 turbojet engine. It was the first Soviet aircraft to utilize the all-moving tailplane and a translating centerbody, a movable inlet cone in the air intake for managing airflow to the engine at supersonic speeds. The aircraft also had a dramatic wing sweep of 60°, irreversible hydraulically <b>boosted</b> <b>controls,</b> and an ejection seat of OKB's own design.|$|R
50|$|The Su-17 was {{designed}} to closely match the theoretical TsAGI calculations for supersonic performance. The aircraft had a 50° swept wing fitted with air brakes and <b>boosted</b> <b>controls.</b> A unique feature was {{that in addition to}} an ejection seat, the entire nose section of the aircraft could separate {{from the rest of the}} airframe. The project was canceled with no flights due to problems with wing structure, ongoing difficulties with the development of the TR-3 engine, and the closure of the Sukhoi OKB. The only example was eventually used as a gunfire target.|$|R
50|$|The {{turbocharger}} is an all new Garrett GT35 unit featuring {{roller bearings}} for improved response, with an external wastegate with high speed closed loop pneumatic valve <b>boost</b> <b>control</b> for absolutely precise automatic <b>boost</b> <b>control.</b> The {{engine management system}} is a Pi Research Pectel electronic engine control unit (ECU), the MQ12, which has more capability than the unit in FPA.|$|E
50|$|In {{turbocharged}} vehicles, a <b>boost</b> <b>control</b> solenoid {{is actuated}} to reduce boost and therefore engine power.|$|E
5000|$|The {{electronic}} systems, extra hoses, solenoids and soforth add complexity to the turbocharger system. This {{runs counter}} to the [...] "keep it simple" [...] principle as there are more things that can go wrong. It {{is worth noting that}} virtually all modern factory turbocharged cars, the same cars with long warranty periods, implement electronic <b>boost</b> <b>control.</b> Manufacturers such as Subaru, Mitsubishi and Saab integrate electronic <b>boost</b> <b>control</b> in all turbo model cars.|$|E

5000|$|ECU <b>controlled</b> <b>boost</b> levels {{will enable}} tighter {{predictive}} control of in-cylinder combustion.|$|R
50|$|A {{dual port}} {{wastegate}} adds a second port {{on the opposite}} side of the actuator. Air pressure allowed to enter this second port aids the spring to push harder in the direction of closing the wastegate. This is exactly the opposite of the first port. The ability to help the wastegate remain closed as boost pressure builds can be increased. This also adds further complexity to <b>boost</b> <b>control,</b> requiring more control ports on the solenoid or possibly a complete second <b>boost</b> <b>control</b> system with its own separate solenoid. Use of the second port is not necessary. Secondary ports, unlike primary ports, cannot be simply attached to a <b>boost</b> <b>control</b> line and require electronic or manual control to be useful. CO2 can also be used to apply pressure to the second port, to control boost on a much finer level.|$|E
5000|$|Automatic Performance Control (APC) was {{the first}} engine knock and <b>boost</b> <b>control</b> system that was {{introduced}} on turbo charged Saab H engines in 1982 and was fitted to all subsequent 900 Turbos through 1993 (and 1994 convertibles), as well as 9000 Turbos through 1989.|$|E
