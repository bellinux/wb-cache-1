By February 1983, consulting engineers Mott Hay and Anderson had submitted a recommendation to complete the M3 through Twyford Down.

25|$|For the 1888–89 season, the Saints {{continued}} to play most of their home matches on the common, although some more prestigious friendly matches were played at the County Ground. After a 5–0 victory in the Hampshire Junior Cup first round over Havant at the Antelope Ground in November and a bye in the second, the third round draw gave the Saints a home match with the Fordingbridge Turks. The match was scheduled for 12 January when the Saints had four players (including captain George Carter) selected for a Hampshire FA game; the Saints' tried to have the cup game rescheduled but the Turks refused. On {{the morning of the}} game, no venue had been arranged but an agreement was reached with the Woolston Works side, who were now tenants at the Antelope Ground, to use their facilities. The Saints won 3–2 earning them a semi-final appearance against Cowes, which the Saints eventually won after a third replay. The final against Christchurch was played at <b>Bar</b> <b>End,</b> Winchester with the Saints winning 3–0. The crowd at the County Ground for the third replay was reported to be in excess of 5,000, although the actual crowd was probably less than half this, but nonetheless the level of support demonstrated that football had now become well-established {{in the eyes of the}} Southampton public.|$|E

25|$|The first match, {{played at}} Northwood Park in Cowes, {{ended in a}} 1–1 draw; the Cowes captain {{requested}} extra time but Carter refused, claiming that the team would miss their ferry home from the Isle of Wight. The replay at the County Ground was also drawn, thus requiring a third match. The sides had each scored once by half-time and the scores were level when a shot from M. Warn was caught well behind the line by the Cowes goalkeeper who quickly threw the ball out. After claims and counter-claims from both teams, the referee awarded a goal to St. Mary's. After the match, Cowes lodged a formal written protest with the Hampshire F.A. which was initially rejected but this was overturned after an appeal from Cowes, who claimed that the linesman had stopped the ball with his flag {{while it was still}} in play. The third replay, also at the County Ground, was a heated affair watched by a crowd estimated at 7,000 but St. Mary's won 4–1 to earn their place in the final. This was played at <b>Bar</b> <b>End,</b> Winchester against Christchurch on 6 April and was rather an anti-climax, with St. Mary's winning 3–0 to retain the trophy. In 1891, St. Mary's had a relatively straightforward passage to the final of the Hampshire Junior Cup, where they defeated Lymington 2–0. Having won the cup for three consecutive years, the Saints retained the trophy permanently.|$|E
500|$|As a 1930s road {{construction}} project, the bypass {{was built to}} then-contemporary standards, including at-grade crossings at <b>Bar</b> <b>End</b> and at Hockley. As time progressed, the bypass {{became more and more}} of a bottleneck as roads around it were improved to higher standards, particularly after the opening of the A33 Chandler's Ford Bypass in 1968 and the A34 King's Worthy Link the following year, which meant all long distance traffic, as opposed to merely that from London to Southampton, was using the bypass. Morgan Morgan-Giles described the bypass as [...] "utterly inadequate and dangerous, as everybody who lives in or near Winchester will agree. The accident figures are appalling. Therefore, a new motorway somewhere to relieve the traffic is urgently needed." [...] The crossing at <b>Bar</b> <b>End</b> was grade separated in 1973, but the junction at Hockley remained a key point of congestion.|$|E

5000|$|In cycling, <b>bar</b> <b>ends</b> are {{extensions}} typically {{fitted to}} the ends of straight handlebars. [...] They extend away from the handlebars and allow the rider to vary the type of grip and posture that they use during a ride. They are especially effective when climbing out of the saddle, because they increase leverage. <b>Bar</b> <b>ends</b> can also improve comfort for the rider due to the neutral position of the hands (palms inward) which places marginally less stress upon the musculature, and by providing more than one place to rest hands on a long journey.|$|R

40|$|We compare stellar orbits in {{an early}} (NGC 4314) and a late-type barred galaxy (NGC 1073). We find that these bars are cold {{in the sense that}} the {{majority}} of stars can be described as being nearby to periodic orbits. We place limits of (65 km/s) ^ 2 and (50 km/s) ^ 2 on the components of the diagonalized velocity dispersion ellipsoid matrix for stars in the bars of NGC 4314 and NGC 1073 respectively. Both <b>bars</b> <b>end</b> near the inner 4 : 1 Lindblad (ultraharmonic) resonance. We conjecture that a large class of <b>bars</b> <b>end</b> near this resonance. The morphology of the bars depends on the strength of the 4 : 1 resonance, which is strong in the early-type barred galaxy and weak in the other. This results in a flat bar major axis surface brightness profile for the early-type bar and an exponential profile for the late-type bar.
