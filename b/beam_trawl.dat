25|$|Outrigger {{trawlers}} – use outriggers to tow the trawl. These {{are commonly}} used to catch shrimp. One or two otter trawls can be towed from each side. Beam trawlers, employed in the North sea for catching flatfish, are another form of outrigger trawler. Medium-sized and high powered vessels, these tow a <b>beam</b> <b>trawl</b> on each side at speeds up to 8 knots.|$|E
25|$|Beam {{trawlers}} are {{a type of}} {{outrigger trawler}} (above), with the superstructure aft and the working deck amidships. They use a very strong outrigger boom on each side, each towing a <b>beam</b> <b>trawl,</b> with the warps going through blocks {{at the end of}} the boom. This arrangement makes it easier to stow and handle the large beams. The outriggers are controlled from a midship A-frame or mast. The towing winch is forward of the superstructure, with the towing warps passed through deck bollards and then out to the towing blocks on the booms.|$|E
40|$|Annual length {{increments}} {{of female}} North Sea plaice were back-calculated from distances between rings in otoliths. Growth {{of the smaller}} size classes ( 35 cm) increased from 1970. Growth changes of the smaller size classes were significantly correlated with indices of plaice density, eutrophication, and seabed disturbance by <b>beam</b> <b>trawling.</b> Moreover, they {{could be related to}} spatial and temporal patterns in variations in eutrophication and <b>beam</b> <b>trawling.</b> No correlation was observed with temperature. The analysis led to a consistent interpretation suggesting that eutrophication and <b>beam</b> <b>trawling</b> have both affected the growth rate of plaice. The contributions of these factors differed in space.

40|$|Since the 1980 s, shrimp <b>beam</b> <b>trawling</b> has {{flourished in}} inshore {{waters of the}} East China Sea (ECS) off Zhejiang Province. By 2000, {{there were more than}} 10 000 beam {{trawlers}} operating in the area. The fishery targets several species of shrimp, including Parapenaeopsis hardwickii, Solenocera crassicornis, Parapenaeus fissuroides, and Trachypenaeus curvirostris. In the early 1990 s, electrical <b>beam</b> <b>trawls</b> using pulse generators, powered either from the vessel or from underwater battery packs, became popular in the fishery. As a result of this new technology, the catch rates of shrimp, especially the burrowing shrimp species, increased. At its peak usage, there were more than 3000 vessels using electrical <b>beam</b> <b>trawls</b> in Zhejiang Province and another 500 or more in the adjacent pro-vinces of Jiangsu and Fujian. This technology was also widespread along the Chinese coast, but a lack of regulation resulted in the misuse of electrical pulse parameters that caused damage to juvenile shrimps and other benthic species. In 2001, this fishing method was banned from the waters off Zhejiang Province, and subsequently {{in other parts of the}} ECS.

2500|$|Political {{opposition}} to the fishery began in 1885, {{based on the assumption}} that bycatch in the Chinese nets was killing large numbers of desirable young fish, especially salmon and striped bass. The opposition was exacerbated by the prevalent anti-Chinese sentiment in California in the late 19th century. Studies showed that the concerns were greatly exaggerated, and that the fishermen ate or gave away the edible fish. A 1932 report concluded that [...] "the average striped bass is too spry to be taken in any such rig." [...] Restrictive regulations were implemented, beginning in 1901 with an annual four-month closure of the fishery during the height of the season, a ban on the export of dried shrimp in 1905, followed by a ban on Chinese nets in 1911, forcing a switch to <b>beam</b> <b>trawl</b> nets, which required motorized boats. Arrests of Chinese fishing crews were common in the first decade of the 20th century. The ban on exports was lifted in 1919, leading to a tripling in production in the 1920s.|$|E

Grampus also was to demonstrate the method of <b>beam</b> <b>trawling</b> used by European fishermen in the North Sea but not in the United States at the time to catch groundfish, and to spur the use of <b>beam</b> <b>trawling</b> by American commercial fishermen in the hope of increasing the monetary value of the American catch and to provide additional employment for men aboard American fishing vessels. The Fish Commission believed that groundfish species native to the waters off North America could be profitably fished even though they differed from the species found in European waters, and Grampus was to use <b>beam</b> <b>trawling</b> to test this idea.|$|R

40|$|Cod, haddock, whiting, saithe, plaice, sole and Norway lobster are 7 main {{target species}} of the {{demersal}} mixed fisheries in the North Sea, Skagerrak and Eastern Channel. Gadoids and Norway lobsters are mainly taken in the nor-thern North Sea by towed gears except <b>beam</b> <b>trawls</b> while the flatfish fisheries are conducted in the southern North Sea mainly using <b>beam</b> <b>trawls.</b> Recently, the central North Sea appears less fished by demersal gears. Towed nets including seines and <b>beam</b> <b>trawls</b> equipped with meshes of more than 100 mm resp. more than 80 mm were identified as the main gears effecting the depleted cod and reduced plaice stocks. The saithe sector, using towed nets with meshes of more than 110 mm, longlines, gill nets and others, appears to affect the 7 species to a lesser extend. These results support the interim effort limitations by gear types, vessel and month as enforced by the European Commission since 2003. TAC regulations alone are considered inefficient to sustainably harvest stocks by mixed fisheries. A fleet-effort management method is developed estimating the fleets’ effects based on the sum of partial exploitation rates of the species in mixed fisheries weighted by {{the ratio of the}} precautionary reference Bpa and the actual SSB size as ecological quality objective. Applying such fleet effort management could result in increased catch possibilities of some stocks by fleets selecting mainly few and non-overexploited stocks while respecting precautionary management constraints in minimum SSB or maximum exploitation rates at the same time...|$|R

50|$|Electric {{pulse fishing}} is a fishing {{technique}} sometimes used in trawl fisheries which produces a limited electric field above the seabed to catch fish.
