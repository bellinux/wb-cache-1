5|$|Model {{chose to}} make his initial attacks using {{infantry}} divisions reinforced with assault guns and heavy tanks, and supported by artillery and the Luftwaffe. In doing so he sought to maintain the armoured strength of his panzer divisions {{to be used for}} exploitation once the Red Army defences were breached. Once a <b>breakthrough</b> had been achieved the panzer forces would move through and advance towards Kursk. Jan Möschen, a major in Model's staff, later commented that Model expected a <b>breakthrough</b> on the second day. If a <b>breakthrough</b> did occur the briefest delay in bringing up the panzer divisions would give the Red Army time to react. His corps commanders thought a <b>breakthrough</b> extremely unlikely.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{lacking the}} {{resources}} to defeat the US <b>breakthrough</b> and simultaneous British and Canadian offensives south of Caumont and Caen, Field Marshal Günther von Kluge, the commander of Army Group B, was not permitted by Hitler to withdraw but was ordered to conduct a counter-offensive at Mortain against the US <b>breakthrough.</b> Four depleted panzer divisions were not enough to defeat the First US Army. The disastrous Operation Lüttich drove the Germans deeper into the Allied envelopment.|$|E

40|$|Digital {{games are}} rich {{learning}} environments that require players {{to engage with}} challenging situations in order to progress. Recent research indicates that game-play involves overcoming breakdowns and achieving <b>breakthroughs</b> in relation to player action, understanding and involvement. In particular, <b>breakthroughs</b> involve moments of insight where learning occurs which, in turn, can help increase involvement. However, {{little is known about}} how players actually achieve <b>breakthroughs.</b> We applied the breakdown/breakthrough “lens” to explore how players attempt to achieve <b>breakthroughs</b> in relation to two single player games. We identified a finite number of strategies that illustrate how players learn in games. These strategies are considered in relation to producing playable and engaging games...|$|R

5|$|Combined {{hormonal}} contraceptives {{include both}} an estrogen and a progestogen. Estrogen negative {{feedback on the}} anterior pituitary greatly decreases the release of FSH, which makes combined hormonal contraceptives more effective at inhibiting follicular development and preventing ovulation. Estrogen also reduces the incidence of irregular <b>breakthrough</b> bleeding. Several combined hormonal contraceptives—the pill, NuvaRing, and the contraceptive patch—are usually used {{in a way that}} causes regular withdrawal bleeding. In a normal cycle, menstruation occurs when estrogen and progesterone levels drop rapidly. Temporarily discontinuing use of combined hormonal contraceptives (a placebo week, not using patch or ring for a week) has a similar effect of causing the uterine lining to shed. If withdrawal bleeding is not desired, combined hormonal contraceptives may be taken continuously, although this increases the risk of <b>breakthrough</b> bleeding.|$|E
