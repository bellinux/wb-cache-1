60|$|He was <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> {{with a big}} dipperful {{of stale}} brown water which tasted like nectar, and loosed the jaws of Disko and Tom Platt.|$|E
60|$|And, {{putting the}} {{child on the}} bench, he told her he'd be <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute,</b> and hurried after Pomona, to give a hasty look for the desired American.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{think very}} well of it,' said Somerset. 'But I leave to-morrow morning, {{which makes it}} {{necessary}} that I turn <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> or two from walking with you.' ...|$|E
60|$|Coming <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> few <b>minutes</b> with <b>a</b> jug, he {{sat down}} on the stern-gratings.|$|R
60|$|The {{man went}} off noiselessly and swiftly, but was <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> few <b>minutes</b> with <b>a</b> flat brown basket.|$|R
60|$|DAISY. How {{tiresome}} of you. Harry {{ought to}} be <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> few <b>minutes.</b> He'll be disappointed not to have seen you.|$|R
60|$|A {{moment later}} {{there was a}} tramp of feet outside, and the major, who passed into the outer room, came <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> or two. He smiled at Ingleby {{somewhat}} drily.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing very dreadful has happened, and I am coming <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> or two, but {{whatever}} you do don't come down," [...] she said authoritatively, and Brooke heard a door swing to above.|$|E
6000|$|... "''Is lordship didn't seem at all pleased,' said Mr. Chipps {{with much}} guarded dignity; 'but finally he said: [...] "Show {{him into the}} library, Chipps, I'll see him," [...] and he {{got up from the}} card table, saying to the gentlemen: [...] "Go on without me; I'll be <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> or two." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{shall be}} going <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> few <b>minutes.</b> <b>As</b> I {{pass through the}} {{corridor}} do not let them try and lift my mask.|$|R
60|$|The clerk came <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> few <b>minutes,</b> and Keller {{pulled himself}} {{together}} {{when he had}} drained the glass, though his forehead was damp with sweat.|$|R
60|$|He {{hammered}} loudly at the knocker {{and pulled}} at the bell, but without any success. Holmes had slipped away, but he came <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> few <b>minutes.</b>|$|R
60|$|In {{a voyage}} to America, some nine years since, {{on the seventh}} or eighth day out from Liverpool, Captain L---- came to dinner at eight bells as usual, talked {{a little to the}} persons right and left of him, and helped the soup with his {{accustomed}} politeness. Then he went on deck, and was <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute,</b> and operated on the fish, looking rather grave the while.|$|E
6000|$|... (Standing up.) I've {{had enough}} of this. The thing must be settled, and I leave it to you, Knox. Go on with your love-making. But I won't be a witness to it. Perhaps I--er--retard the--er--the flame process. You two must make up your minds, {{and you can do}} it better without me. I am going to get a drink and settle my nerves. I'll be <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Arriving at the door, the Frenchman bethought {{himself of}} his {{travelling}} companion. 'My scene-painter {{is here with}} me,' he said, 'on the look-out for materials. An excellent fellow, who will {{take it as a}} kindness if we ask him to join us. I'll tell the porter to send him up when he comes in.' He handed the key of his room to Francis. 'I will be <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute.</b> It's {{at the end of the}} corridor--13 A.' ...|$|E
60|$|The trooper came <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> few <b>minutes</b> with <b>a</b> garment {{which he}} had found under a bed, and Curtis bade him {{put it on the}} prisoner.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, undress {{as quick}} {{as you can and}} go to bed. I'll come <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> few <b>minutes</b> for the candle. I daren't trust you to put it out yourself. You'd likely set the place on fire." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{young man}} came <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> few <b>minutes,</b> {{and by that}} time there were a few plates upon the table. He sat down, and then stood up once more when he saw the girl {{standing}} close by with a tray.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mighty frightened {{the monk}} looked, I can tell you, {{as he went}} off to give the message, and came <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute,</b> asking Thompson to follow him. We all dismounted. Two of the troopers stopped to look after the horses, and the others with drawn swords {{followed}} Thompson and me. We were shown into the prior's room, which was fit for a prince. The prior looked mighty pale, and so did two or three other chaps who were with him.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, ma'am," [...] said Pomona, [...] "not long. When I {{thought of}} Mrs. General Jackson and Tom Thumb, I couldn't help thinkin' that I {{must have looked}} {{pretty much the same}} to my husband, who, I knowed now, had only been makin'-believe to make-believe. An' besides, I couldn't be angry very long for laughin, for when he come <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute,</b> as mad as a March hare, an' said they wouldn't let me out nor him nuther, I fell to laughin' ready to crack my sides.|$|E
6000|$|... "Shouldn't {{you like}} a turn?" [...] said the Prince of Fairoaks. [...] "What fun it would be! Mrs. Bolton, ma'am, do let me take her once round." [...] Upon which Mr. Costigan said, [...] "Off wid you!" [...] and Mrs. Bolton not refusing (indeed, she was an old war-horse, and would have liked, at the trumpet's sound, to have entered the arena herself), Fanny's shawl was off her <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute,</b> and she and Arthur were {{whirling}} round in a waltz {{in the midst of}} a great deal of queer, but exceedingly joyful company.|$|E
6000|$|... "I expect I {{shall be}} <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> few <b>minutes,</b> Ciceley, so don't you wander away till I come. It is too hot today to be hunting for you, {{all over the}} garden, as I did when you hid {{yourself}} last week." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{expected}} keen joy in new {{fields and}} hills. Yet {{all the way}} north {{he was trying to}} hold the train <b>back.</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> few <b>minutes,</b> now, he would see Ruth. And at this hour he did not even know definitely that he liked her.|$|R
60|$|Dick, however, was not {{satisfied}} with this {{way of looking at}} it. Saying that he would be <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> few <b>minutes</b> he re-loaded his rifle, and calling Crusoe to his side, walked quickly after the wounded bull, which was now hid from view <b>in</b> <b>a</b> hollow of the plain.|$|R
6000|$|... "Lemonade!" [...] exclaimed Miss Bingham, {{catching}} {{sight of}} the glasses and saucers {{on the corner of}} the piano, where Miss Simpson had allowed Langbourne to put them. [...] "Has Aunt Elmira been giving you lemonade while I was gone? I will just see about that!" [...] She whipped out of the room, and was <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> with a glass in one hand and a bit of sponge-cake between the fingers of the other. [...] "She had kept some for me! Have you sung Paloma for Mr. Langbourne, Barbara?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My God, he's off!" [...] cried Jim. [...] "Here, {{run to the}} burn. Jock, for a hatful of water. Quick, man, or he's gone! I'll loosen {{his things}} the while." [...] Away I tore, and was <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> with as much water as would Stay in my Glengarry. Jim had pulled open the man's coat and shirt, and we doused the water over him, and forced some between his lips. It had a good effect; for after a gasp or two {{he sat up and}} rubbed his eyes slowly, like a man who is waking from a deep sleep. But neither Jim nor I were looking at his face now, for our eyes were fixed upon his {{uncovered}} chest.|$|E
60|$|The {{shoemaker}} did jump up, and {{we helped}} him move the bench, {{and had the}} trap-door open in no time. By this, {{the rest of the}} party had come back, and when Mrs. Chipperton saw the well open and no Mr. Chipperton about, she turned as white as a sheet. We could hardly wait for the man to light his lamp, {{and as soon as he}} started down the winding stairs, Rectus and I followed him. I called back to Mrs. Chipperton and the others that they need not come; we would be <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> and let them know. But it was of no use; they all came. We hurried on after the man with the light, and passed straight ahead through the narrow passage to the very end of it.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{exceedingly}} {{obliged to}} you, Mr. Garth," [...] he said, {{in his usual}} tone of politeness. [...] "My servant will be <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> few <b>minutes,</b> and I shall then go myself to see {{what can be done}} for this unfortunate man. Perhaps you had some other business with me? If so, pray be seated." ...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Hartley, {{with much}} concern, began to cite {{a long list}} of things {{responsible}} for what he freely admitted was an unfortunate mistake on his part. His daughter listened with growing impatience and confusion, and, as he showed no signs of nearing the end, rose <b>in</b> <b>a</b> dignified fashion and quitted the room. She was <b>back,</b> however, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> or two, and, putting her arm on his shoulder, bent down and kissed him.|$|R
60|$|Thus it {{was that}} when Mr. Blyth left Zack's friend {{to see what was}} going on near the door, he found Madonna in the painting-room, {{surrounded}} by sympathizing and admiring ladies. The first words of explanation by which Lady Brambledown answered his mute look of inquiry, reminded him of the anxiety and alarm that his wife must have suffered; and he ran up-stairs directly, promising to be <b>back</b> again <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> or two.|$|R
6000|$|... "Are you {{capable of}} the very great {{kindness}} of going to relieve Newsome, for a few minutes, of the rather crushing responsibility of Madame Gloriani, while I say a word, if he'll allow me, to Mr. Strether, of whom I've a question to ask? Our host ought to talk a bit to those other ladies, and I'll come <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> to your rescue." [...] She made this proposal to Miss Barrace as if her consciousness of a special duty had just flickered-up, but that lady's recognition of Strether's little start at it--as at a betrayal on the speaker's part of a domesticated state--was as mute as his own comment; and after an instant, when their fellow guest had good-naturedly left them, {{he had been given}} something else to think of. [...] "Why has Maria so suddenly gone? Do you know?" [...] That was the question Madame de Vionnet had brought with her.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{wonder how}} it feels. Most men {{go into this}} without knowing of the change that hangs over them. But I am older. It would not be nice for a {{caterpillar}} if {{he knew he was}} going to rip up all along his <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> or so. Yet I could sympathise with such a caterpillar now. Anyhow, George, I hope the change will be complete. I would not like to undergo only a partial metamorphosis, and become a queer speckled monster all spotted with bachelor habits. Yet I sometimes think I am beyond the adolescent stage, and my habits rather deeply rooted. Hitherto, I have always damned a little at braces and collars and things like that. I wish I knew where one could pick up a few admissible expletives. And I loaf about London all day sometimes without any very clear idea of what I am after, telling chaps in studios how to paint, and talking to leisurely barristers, and all that kind of thing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How infernally hot {{you have}} it in here!" [...] He {{went to the window}} and threw it up; and then did not sit down again, but {{continued}} to walk back and forth as he talked. [...] "She didn't seem to know who they were at first, and when I made her understand she hung back, and said, 'Those showy things?' and I must say I think she was wrong; they were dressed as quietly as nine-tenths of the people there; only they are rather large, handsome women. I said I thought we ought to go and speak to them, they seemed stranded there; but she didn't seem to see it; and, when I persisted, she said, 'Well, you go if you think best; but take me to mamma.' And I supposed it was all right; and I told Mrs. Pasmer I'd be <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute,</b> and then I went off to those women. And after I'd talked with them a while I saw Mrs. Brinkley sitting with old Bromfield Corey in another corner, and I got them across and introduced them; after I'd explained to Mrs. Brinkley who they were; and they began to have a good time, and I--didn't." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Iduna! {{thou art}} safe," [...] exclaimed Iskander. [...] "Now for Epirus!" [...] So saying, he seized the black mare, renovated by her bath and pasture, and {{vaulting}} on her <b>back,</b> was <b>in</b> <b>a</b> few <b>minutes</b> bounding over his native hills.|$|R
60|$|It was {{too dark}} to see his companion's face clearly, but Drakesford {{appeared}} to smile <b>in</b> <b>a</b> manner that suggested comprehension, and they strolled a little nearer the corporal, who had just sent for the cook. The corporal explained that he had ridden a long way since his dinner, and asked for a can of coffee and some eatables, and the cook proceeded dubiously toward the shed. He came <b>back</b> empty-handed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> or two.|$|R
60|$|The man leaped {{almost to}} his feet, then fell <b>back</b> <b>in</b> another spasm. <b>A</b> <b>minute</b> {{later he was}} dead. With {{tenderness}} mother and son cared for the body. In one of the seaman's pockets was found a packet of papers yellow with age.|$|R
