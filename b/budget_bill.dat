5|$|The 2011 Minnesota state {{government}} shutdown was a government shutdown affecting the U.S. state of Minnesota. The shutdown {{was the result}} of a fiscal dispute between the Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party (DFL) Governor Mark Dayton and the Republican-majority Minnesota Legislature, that was not resolved by the constitutional deadline on June 30. The Republican caucuses and their leaders demanded bigger spending cuts, and for the budget shortfall to be met without tax increases, while Dayton demanded some tax increases. The shutdown started at midnight on July 1, and ended after a <b>budget</b> <b>bill</b> was passed and signed on July 20.|$|E
5|$|Once {{passed by}} the Senate, a bill {{is sent to the}} House of Delegates for consideration. If the House also approves the bill without amendment, it is sent to the Governor. If there is amendment, however, the Senate may either reconsider the bill with {{amendments}} or ask {{for the establishment of a}} conference committee to work out differences in the versions of the bill passed by each chamber. Once a piece of legislation approved by both houses is forwarded to the Governor, it may either be signed or vetoed. If it is signed, it takes effect on the effective date of the legislation, usually October 1 of that year. If it is vetoed, both the Senate and the House of Delegates must vote by a three-fifths majority to overturn the veto. They may not, however, overturn a veto in the first year of a new term, since the bill would have been passed during the previous session. Additionally, joint resolutions and the <b>budget</b> <b>bill</b> may not be vetoed, although the General Assembly is constitutionally limited in the extent to which it may influence the latter; it may only decrease the Governor's budget proposal, not increase it.|$|E
5|$|Rodríguez Saá {{prepared}} a <b>budget</b> <b>bill</b> for 2002, which {{was sent to}} the Congress. It included an important decrease in the deficits, as requested by Anne Krueger from the International Monetary Fund. Krueger also requested a new coparticipation law, to determine the way the nation and the provinces manage tax revenues. Rodríguez Saá called for a meeting with governors in Chapadmalal, but only six governors out of twenty-three attended: Carlos Ruckauf, Juan Carlos Romero, Gildo Insfrán, Ángel Mazza, Carlos Rovira and Alicia Lemme. José Manuel de la Sota, governor of Córdoba, withdrew his support, suspecting that Rodríguez Saá had plans to cancel the elections and stay as president up to 2003. On December 30, he returned to San Luis with Daniel Scioli and resigned, alleging lack of support {{from the rest of the}} Justicialist Party. Insfrán, Maza and minister Rodolfo Gabrielli tried to convince him to stay as president; his brother Alberto Rodríguez Saá supported his decision. In announcing his resignation in a Cadena nacional, he recounted the achievements of his one-week administration and accused Justicialist governors and legislators of meanness and shortsightedness. He dispatched his resignation from San Luis to Buenos Aires, and the Congress accepted it on January 1, 2002. The Senate chairman Ramón Puerta would have been the interim president, but resigned as well, so Eduardo Camaño, president of the Chamber of Deputies, was appointed interim president instead. After new deliberations, they elected Eduardo Duhalde as president, this time with a mandate that would fill the remaining time of delaRúa's mandate.|$|E

50|$|It is of {{particular}} importance that <b>budget</b> <b>bills</b> should be voted in a timely manner, since they authorize taxes and spending. For this reason, the Government can adopt the budget by ordonnances if Parliament {{has not been able}} to agree on it within 70 days after the proposal of the budget (Constitution, article 47). The same applies for social security <b>budget</b> <b>bills,</b> but with a 50-day period (Constitution, article 47-1).|$|R

25|$|Governor's action. All passed bills, {{except the}} <b>budget</b> <b>bill</b> and {{constitutional}} amendments, must {{be presented to}} the Governor within twenty days following adjournment of a session. The Governor may veto bills within thirty days after presentation. If a passed bill is not vetoed, it becomes law. The <b>budget</b> <b>bill,</b> however, becomes law upon its final passage and cannot be vetoed. Constitutional amendments also cannot be vetoed; they become law only upon their ratification by the voters at the next general election.|$|E
25|$|The first budget enacted {{under the}} McDonnell {{administration}} took effect on July 1, 2010. Two of McDonnell's legislative initiatives increased the surplus for the 2009–2010 fiscal year. First, the <b>budget</b> <b>bill</b> accelerated {{the payment of}} state sales taxes resulting in a one-time shift of revenues to be collected in July 2010 into the previous fiscal year. Second, the <b>budget</b> <b>bill</b> deferred a $620 million payment to the Virginia Retirement System to future years. The end of year surplus triggered the payment of a 3% bonus to state employees in December 2010. Members of both parties called on McDonnell to use the surplus to reverse the Virginia Retirement System deferral.|$|E
25|$|The 2014 <b>budget</b> <b>bill</b> {{included}} $2.5 {{million in}} {{funding for a}} future vote in Puerto Rico's political status. This referendum could be held at any time, as there was no deadline attached to the funds.|$|E

25|$|After Citizens United and SpeechNow.org {{numerous}} {{state legislatures}} raised their limits on contributions to candidates and parties. At the federal level, lawmakers substantially increased contribution limits to political parties {{as part of}} the 2014 <b>budget</b> <b>bill.</b> Such changes are widely perceived as efforts to place candidates and parties on something closer to equal footing with organizations making independent expenditures.|$|E
25|$|On July 10, 2013, A U.S. House {{subcommittee}} {{approved a}} <b>budget</b> <b>bill</b> which includes Obama's requested $2.5 {{million for a}} new Puerto Rican plebiscite, though the bill’s ultimate fate is unclear because the Senate is pushing for a related yet different bill. One week later, on July 17, 2013, the House Appropriations Committee also approved the bill.|$|E
25|$|Also, the Detainee Treatment Act's anti-torture {{provisions}} were {{modified by}} the Graham-Levin Amendment, which {{was attached to}} the $453-billion 2006 Defense <b>Budget</b> <b>Bill.</b> The Graham-Levin Amendment permits the Department of Defense to consider evidence obtained through torture of Guantanamo Bay detainees, and expands the prohibition of habeas corpus for redetainees, which subsequently leaves detainees no legal recourse if they are tortured.|$|E

25|$|Overall, Nunn was a moderate-to-conservative Democrat {{who often}} broke with his party {{on a host}} of social and {{economic}} issues. He opposed the <b>budget</b> <b>bill</b> of 1993, which included provisions to raise taxes {{in order to reduce the}} budget deficit. He neither supported nor opposed Hillary Clinton's attempt to nationalize health care, though he spoke out very strongly against the proposed insurance mandate.|$|E
25|$|In March 2011, Cravaack {{came under}} {{criticism}} by Duluth students {{and community leaders}} for his {{vote in favor of}} a <b>budget</b> <b>bill</b> made cuts to increased federal spending on federal Pell Grant program that provides financial aid to college students, including 30 percent of the students at the University of Minnesota Duluth. He also came to press attention for implying during a House Homeland Security Committee hearing that Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca was furthering the goals of a terrorist organization.|$|E
25|$|West Virginia Governor Tomblin's {{proposed}} 2014–15 budget submitted in January 2014 had {{an estimated}} budget gap of $146–$265 million, and {{halfway through the}} 2013–14 fiscal year, tax revenues were $82 million short. The West Virginia Legislature in March 2014 passed its <b>budget</b> <b>bill,</b> taking $147 million from the Rainy Day Fund to balance the 2015 budget. Governor Tomblin's Deputy Chief of Staff Jason Pizatella, after the state legislature passed the budget, said that West Virginia is expecting another dismal budget in 2016 and could need $150–170 million to balance the next year's budget.|$|E
50|$|Two special {{sessions}} were held. The first {{was held on}} July 19-20, 2011, to complete the passage of <b>budget</b> <b>bills.</b> The second was held on August 24, 2012, to provide disaster assistance for the flooded areas of Duluth.|$|R
50|$|Smith {{argued that}} both the 2008 and 2009 <b>budget</b> <b>bills</b> {{contained}} overly optimistic revenue projections and opposed both bills. Actual revenue for 2008 and 2009 {{failed to meet the}} projections and necessitated Governor Tim Kaine to reduce state funding of transportation, higher education, and other services.|$|R
50|$|The {{governor}} {{has the power}} to veto <b>bills.</b> For <b>budget</b> <b>bills</b> or supplementary appropriations bills, two-thirds of the members elected to each house are required to override the governor's veto of a bill or line-item veto.

25|$|June 23, 2005 - Traditionally, it {{is around}} this date that the House of Commons closes. But with Bill C-38 in the process, MPs of the Liberal, Bloc and NDP parties vote {{to extend the}} sitting time through the {{following}} week to pass Bill C-38 in third and final reading. The same night, the <b>budget</b> <b>bill</b> (Bill C-48) passes after a late night snap vote is called, ending the threat by Bill C-38 opponents to derail the bill by defeating the budget thereby bringing down the government and forcing a general election.|$|E
25|$|None {{of these}} bills were {{important}} enough to dissolve parliament and seek a new mandate at a general election. Asquith and Lloyd George believed the peers would back down if presented with Liberal objectives contained within a finance bill—the Lords had not obstructed a money bill since the 17th century, and after initially blocking Gladstone's attempt (as chancellor) to repeal Paper Duties, had yielded in 1861 when it was submitted again in a finance bill. Accordingly, the Liberal leadership expected that after much objection from the Tory peers, the Lords would yield to policy changes wrapped within a <b>budget</b> <b>bill.</b>|$|E
25|$|On February 25, in {{response}} to the accusation from the students, Khin Maung Yi, the chairperson of Joint Bill Committee, stated that the committee was not just buying time. He also claimed that the committee was putting all necessary effort to finalize the bill in the current parliamentary session amidst other important bills such as the <b>budget</b> <b>bill,</b> the taxation bill and the national planning bill. Moreover, since the education bill is not under the category of bills that will go directly to the Union of Parliament, it has to go through the Lower House and the Upper House before it could be passed.|$|E
5000|$|May 19 [...] - [...] The {{government}} {{passes the}} first of two <b>budget</b> <b>bills</b> easily after the Conservatives promise support, but the second bill with the NDP concessions ends as a cliffhanger. Speaker Peter Milliken breaks a 152-152 tie in favour of the bill, keeping the government alive.|$|R
5000|$|President Obama promised {{during his}} State of the Union address in January 2011 to veto any bill that {{contained}} earmarks.

5000|$|The Line Item Veto Act of 1996 [...] was {{a federal}} law of the United States that granted the President the power to line-item veto <b>budget</b> <b>bills</b> passed by Congress, but its effect was brief as the act was soon ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in Clinton v.

25|$|In 2007, Boeing {{proposed}} additional F/A-18E/Fs to the U.S. Navy in a multi-year contract. As of October 2008, Boeing {{had delivered}} 367 Super Hornets to the U.S. Navy. On 6 April 2009, Defense Secretary Gates {{announced that the}} Department of Defense intended to acquire 31 F/A-18s in FY2010. Congress requested the DoD study a further multi-year contract so that a projected fighter shortfall could be averted; in 2006, the Navy was 60 fighters below its validated aircraft requirement. The FY2010 <b>budget</b> <b>bill</b> authorized a multiyear purchase agreement for additional Super Hornets. A multi-year contract was finalized on 28 September 2010, reported as saving $600million over individual yearly contracts, for 66 Super Hornets and 58 Growlers to mitigate a four-year delay in the F-35 program.|$|E
25|$|The deal {{turned out}} to be rather unnecessary, as the Conservatives opted to ensure the government's {{survival}} on the motion of confidence surrounding the original budget, expressing support to the tax cuts and defence spending therein. When Parliament voted on second reading and referral of the budget and the amendment on May 19, the previous events kept the government alive. The original <b>budget</b> <b>bill,</b> C-43, passed easily, as expected, but the amendment bill, C-48, resulted in an equality of votes, and the Speaker of the House broke the tie to continue the parliament. The government never got as close to falling after that date. Third reading of Bill C-48 was held late at night on an unexpected day, and several Conservatives being absent, the motion passed easily, guaranteeing there would be no election in the near future.|$|E
25|$|Churchill also {{assisted}} in passing the People's Budget, becoming President of the Budget League, an organisation {{set up in}} response to the opposition's Budget Protest League. The budget included the introduction of new taxes on the wealthy to allow for the creation of new social welfare programmes. After the <b>budget</b> <b>bill</b> was passed by the Commons in 1909 it was vetoed by the House of Lords. The Liberals then fought and won two general elections in January and December 1910 to gain a mandate for their reforms. The budget was passed after the first election, and after the second election the Parliament Act 1911, for which Churchill also campaigned, was passed. In 1910, he was promoted to Home Secretary. His term was controversial after his responses to the Cambrian Colliery dispute, the Siege of Sidney Street and the suffragettes. The People's Budget attempted to introduce a heavy tax on land value, inspired by the economist and philosopher Henry George.|$|E
50|$|Grant {{worked as}} the {{general counsel for the}} Democratic Senate Budget Committee from 1994 to 1997.

50|$|Chafee opposes {{eliminating}} the federal estate tax. Chafee also voted against both the 2001 and 2003 congressional <b>budget</b> <b>bills</b> that cut and/or rebated individuals' federal income taxes. He asserted that tax cuts reduce revenue {{to the federal}} government, thereby worsening {{the federal budget deficit}} and increasing the amount of money it has to borrow in order to operate.|$|R
