50|$|In volume two of Das Antlitz der Erde Suess set out {{his belief}} that across {{geologic}} time, {{the rise and fall}} of sea levels were mappable across the earth, that is, that the periods of ocean transgression and regression were correlatable from one continent to another. Suess postulated that as sediments filled the ocean basins the sea levels gradually rose, and periodically there were events of rapid ocean <b>bottom</b> <b>subsidence</b> that increased the ocean's capacity and caused the regressions. Chamberlin proposed that instead of a thermal contraction, diastrophic movement was caused by gravitational contraction. In the United States, it was not until the late 1960s that thermal convection replaced the shrinking Earth theories.|$|E
40|$|It is {{the policy}} of the Dutch {{government}} to aim at the extraction of gas from the smaller gas fields in The Netherlands to spare the large Slochteren field in Groningen. The gas reservoirs below the Wadden Sea are counted among the smaller fields. Their capacity is estimated to 200 thousand million cubic metres, and their economic value is equal to about 20 thousand million guilder. Extraction will disturb the morphologic equilibrium. At the commission of the NAM it is investigated to what extent gas extraction affects the morphology of the Wadden Sea. These effects are studied for combinations of three sea level rise scenarios and three scenarios of <b>bottom</b> <b>subsidence.</b> The sea level rise scenarios consist of the recent scenario (0. 18 m/century), the expected scenario (average 0. 60 m/century) and the high scenario (average 1. 00 m/century). The <b>bottom</b> <b>subsidence</b> scenarios consist of no subsidence, minimum subsidence and maximum subsidence. The effects are studied for the flats, channels, deltas and adjacent coasts of the Friesche Zeegat. To study these effects, the model ASMITA is used. ASMITA is an acronym for: "Aggregated Scale Morphological Interaction between a Tidal inlet system and the Adjacent coast". ASMITA is an aggregated-scale behaviour-model of a tidal inlet system, which can be used for long-term modelling. The model consists of three major morphological elements, i. e. the tidal basin, the ebb-tidal delta and the directly adjacent coast. Each of these elements is primarily influenced by the basin-related tidal prism flow and secondarily by the by wave-related hydrodynamics. From each element the equilibrium state is known. In this equilibrium state each element has the same constant overall equilibrium concentration. Disturbance of this equilibrium (e. g. change in volume) results in an exchange of sediment between the various elements until the former equilibrium state is reached again. The exchange is mainly based on diffusion. The basic model consists of five elements: one coastal element at both sides of the delta, an ebb-tidal delta, a channel and a flat. To study the effects for the coast, the model is extended with three extra coastal elements at both sides ofthe delta. At both sides, the coast now consists of two elements which are placed {{at the side of the}} coast, and two elements which are placed seawards. The elements farther away from the inlet have a lower equilibrium concentration because the influence of the waves and/or tides is smaller. Due to the differences in equilibrium concentrations diffusive transports are generated. To create an equilibrium the net transport between the elements should equal zero. In long shore direction the diffusive transport is compensated for with a wave-generated sediment transport, which depends on the curvature of the island head and on the littoral transport. And in cross-shore direction the diffusive transport is compensated for with a slopegenerated transport. The model is also adjusted for sea level rise. As regards the coast one can distinguish two effects of sea level rise: an overall and a local effect. The overall effect comprises the structural erosion of the upstream coast due to the sand demand from the tidal basin, and the local effect comprise the "Bruun-effect" and the "island-head effect". The last effect represents the curvature of the island head due to stronger influence of the tides. Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
40|$|Coal {{deposits}} {{in the adjacent}} regions of Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Inner Mongolia province (SSI) account for approximately two-thirds of coal in China; therefore, the SSI region has become the frontier of coal mining and its westward movement. Numerous adverse impacts to land and environment have arisen in these sandy, arid, and ecologically fragile areas. Underground coal mining activities cause land to subside and subsequent soil erosion, with slope length and slope steepness (LS) as the key influential factor. In this investigation, an SSI mining site was chosen {{as a case study}} area, and 1) the pre-mining LS factor was obtained using a digital elevation model (DEM) dataset; 2) a mining subsidence prediction was implemented with revised subsidence prediction factors; and 3) the post-mining LS factor was calculated by integrating the pre-mining DEM dataset and coal mining subsidence prediction data. The results revealed that the LS factor leads to some changes in the <b>bottom</b> of <b>subsidence</b> basin and considerable alterations at the basin’s edges of basin. Moreover, the LS factor became larger in the steeper terrain under subsidence impacts. This integrated method could quantitatively analyse LS changes and spatial distribution under mining impacts, which will benefit and provide references for soil erosion evaluations in this regio...|$|R
40|$|Copyrighted by American Geophysical Union. The Queen Charlotte Fault is a transpressive {{transform}} {{plate boundary}} between the Pacific and North American plates offshore western Canada. Previous models for the accommodation of transpression include internal deformation of both plates adjacent to the plate boundary or oblique subduction of the oceanic plate; the latter has been the preferred model. Both plates are warm and mafic and have similar mechanical structures. New multichannel seismic reflection data show a near-vertical Queen Charlotte Fault down to the first water <b>bottom</b> multiple, significant <b>subsidence</b> east of the Queen Charlotte Fault, a large melange where the fault is in a compressive left step, and faulting which involves oceanic basement. Gravity modeling of profiles indicates that the Pacific plate is flexed downward adjacent to the Queen Charlotte Fault. Upward flexure of North America along with crust thickened relative to crust in the adjacent basin creates topography known as the Queen Charlotte Islands. Combined with other regional studies, these observations suggest that the plate boundary is a vertical strike-slip fault and that transpression is taken up within each plate...|$|R
40|$|Geophysical {{investigations}} {{reveal that}} many granitoid plutons possess a tabular shape: either laccolithic, lopolithic or phacolithic. In this study, {{the results of}} a centrifuge experiment are used to understand the formation mechanisms of these features. The model was build of a sequence of 14 differently coloured plasticine layers. Two buoyant layers - with a volume of c. 40 cm 3 each - were incorporated into the model stratigraphy at different depths to investigate, whether the rise and emplacement of buoyant material at different levels results in different intrusion structures. After centrifuging for 30 min at 700 G, both the buoyant layers had formed two lenticular sills (phacoliths) with aspect ratios (length/thickness) of 6 and 3. 4 for the upper and lower phacoliths, respectively, directly above both pre-existing perturbations in the buoyant layers. During their movement, the buoyant phacoliths had pushed their roof plasticine upward. Simultaneously, their floor plasticine had subsided (<b>bottom</b> sinking). <b>Subsidence</b> of the floor material had choked the inflow of further buoyant material into the feeder channel of the developing sills and inhibited their further lateral growth. The observed forced downward movement of the plasticine floor of the forming PDMS (polydimethylsiloxane) phacoliths resembles the so-called Ã¢Â€Âœfloor depressionÃ¢Â€Â of host rock material around an emplacing tabular pluton. Floor depression {{is supposed to be a}} very important vertical material transfer process, which provides space for the construction of lopo- and phacoliths. The subsidence of host material made space for the developing buoyant phacoliths, but also restricted their growth to a certain time slot before the influx of new buoyant material into the feeder dyke of the tabular intrusive body was shut off. Similarly, in nature, the growth of a tabular pluton might be limited not only by the rate of magma ascent and its physical properties, but also by the emplacement processes of the evolving pluton...|$|R
