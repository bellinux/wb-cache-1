Wilhelm Reich also highlighted the principal support of the rise of fascism in Germany given by the petite bourgeoisie and middle-class in The Mass Psychology of Fascism. He claimed that the middle classes were a hotbed for political reaction due to their reliance on the patriarchal family (small businesses, according to Reich, are often self-exploiting enterprises of families headed by the father, whose morality <b>binds</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> together in their somewhat precarious economic position), and the sexual repression that underlies it.|$|E

40|$|The {{identity}} of a given cell type {{is determined by the}} expression of a set of genes sharing common cis-regulatory motifs and being regulated by shared transcription factors. Here, we identify cis and trans regulatory elements that drive gene expression in the bilateral sensory neuron ASJ, located in the head of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. For this purpose, we have dissected the promoters of the only two genes so far reported to be exclusively expressed in ASJ, trx- 1 and ssu- 1. We hereby identify the ASJ motif, a functional cis-regulatory bipartite promoter region composed of two individual 6 bp elements separated by a 3 bp linker.

40|$|The {{chemokine}} RANTES {{is produced}} {{by a variety of}} tissues, including cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage. RANTES expression is rapidly and transiently up-regulated in primary monocytes and the monocytic cell line Mono Mac 6 in response to stimulation by the bacterial product lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Transient transfection of Mono Mac 6 cells with RANTES reporter-promoter deletion constructs, in conjunction with DNase I footprinting and heterologous reporter gene assays, allowed identification of an LPS-responsive region within the RANTES promoter. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA), methylation interference and EMSA supershift experiments were used to characterize sequences and transcription factors responsible for this LPS inducibility. The region, termed RANTES site G [R(G) ], contains consensus sites for Ets and CRE/AP- 1 -like elements. Site-directed mutagenesis of the Ets site resulted in a loss of only 15 % of promoter activity, while mutation of the CRE/AP- 1 site led to a loss of 40 % of LPS-induced promoter activity. The Ets site constitutively <b>binds</b> <b>the</b> Ets <b>family</b> member PU. 1. LPS stimulation leads to an induction of ATF- 3 and JunD factor binding to the CRE/AP- 1 site.

40|$|Cadherins are calcium-dependent {{adhesion}} molecules {{responsible for}} the establishment of tight cell–cell contacts. p 120 catenin (p 120 ctn) <b>binds</b> to <b>the</b> cytoplasmic domain of cadherins in the juxtamembrane region, which has been implicated in regulating cell motility. It has previously been shown that overexpression of p 120 ctn induces a dendritic morphology in fibroblasts (Reynolds, A. B., J. Daniel, Y. Mo, J. Wu, and Z. Zhang. 1996. Exp. Cell Res. 225 : 328 – 337.). We show here that this phenotype is suppressed by coexpression of cadherin constructs that contain the juxtamembrane region, but not by constructs lacking this domain. Overexpression of p 120 ctn disrupts stress fibers and focal adhesions and results in a decrease in RhoA activity. The p 120 ctn-induced phenotype is blocked by dominant negative Cdc 42 and Rac 1 and by constitutively active Rho-kinase, but is enhanced by dominant negative RhoA. p 120 ctn overexpression increased the activity of endogenous Cdc 42 and Rac 1. Exploring how p 120 ctn may regulate Rho family GTPases, we find that p 120 ctn <b>binds</b> <b>the</b> Rho <b>family</b> exchange factor Vav 2. The behavior of p 120 ctn suggests that it is a vehicle for cross-talk between cell–cell junctions and the motile machinery of cells. We propose a model in which p 120 ctn can shuttle between a cadherin-bound state and a cytoplasmic pool in which it can interact with regulators of Rho family GTPases. Factors that perturb cell–cell junctions, such that the cytoplasmic pool of p 120 ctn is increased, are predicted to decrease RhoA activity but to elevate active Rac 1 and Cdc 42, thereby promoting cell migration...|$|R

TNKS 1 and TNKS 2 bound to EBNA 1 in coimmunoprecipitation experiments with transfected cell lysates and with purified recombinant proteins in vitro. Two RXXPDG-like TNKS-interacting motifs in the EBNA 1 amino-terminal domain mediated binding with the ankyrin repeat domain of TNKS. Mutations of both motifs at EBNA 1 G 81 and G 425 abrogated TNKS binding and enhanced EBNA 1 -dependent replication of OriP. Small hairpin RNA targeted knock-down of TNKS 1 enhanced OriP-dependent DNA replication. Overexpression of TNKS 1 or TNKS 2 inhibited OriP-dependent DNA replication, while a PARP-inactive form of TNKS 2 (M 1045 V) was compromised for this inhibition. We show that EBNA 1 is subject to PAR modification in vivo and to TNKS 1 -mediated PAR modification in vitro. These results indicate that TNKS proteins can interact directly with the EBNA 1 protein, associate with the FR region of OriP in vivo, and inhibit OriP replication in a PARP-dependent manner...|$|R
