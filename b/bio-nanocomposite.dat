40|$|This {{study was}} {{aimed to develop}} <b>bio-nanocomposite</b> films of {{carboxymethyl}} cellulose (CMC) /starch (ST) polysaccharide matrix reinforced with cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) using the solution casting method. The CNC were extracted at the nanometric scale from sugarcane bagasse via sulfuric acid hydrolysis and used as reinforcing phase to produce CMC/ST-CNC <b>bio-nanocomposite</b> films at different CNC loading levels (0. 5 – 5. 0 wt%). Steady shear viscosity and dynamic viscoelastic measurements of film-forming solution (FFS) of neat CMC, CMC/ST blend and CMC/ST-CNC bio-nanocomposites were evaluated. Viscosity measurements revealed that a transition from Newtonian behavior to shear thinning occurred when CNC were added. The dynamic tests confirmed that all FFS have a viscoelastic behavior with an entanglement network structure, induced by the hydrogen bonding. In regard to the cast film quality, the rheological data showed that all FFS were suitable for casting of films at ambient temperature. The effect of CNC addition on the optical transparency, water vapor permeability (WVP) and tensile properties of <b>bio-nanocomposite</b> films was studied. It was found that <b>bio-nanocomposite</b> films remain transparent due to CNC dispersion at the nanoscale.

40|$|A novel {{method for}} polyamide/clay <b>bio-nanocomposites</b> {{fabrication}} {{was developed in}} an attempt to facilitate ?extensive delamination? of clay stacks in polyamide matrices. The method, the so-called ?surfactant-free organo-modification approach? did not employ any surfactants for the matrix-clay compatibilisation. The idea was to exploit the use of dimer fatty acid polyamides with protonated amine end groups as clay surface modifiers of the clay previously dispersed in a liquid medium. The clays of choice in the study were the standard smectite clays commonly used to prepare polymer-clay nanocomposites and vermiculite. They were ultimately chosen {{on the basis of their}} ability to exfoliate into nano-thick sheets. Dimer fatty acid polyamide/clay <b>bio-nanocomposites</b> containing either montmorillonite or vermiculite were successfully prepared using the ?surfactant-free organo-modification approach?. <b>Bio-nanocomposites</b> containing as much as 28 wt. % montmorillonite and 30 wt. % vermiculite were obtained. In both cases, the composites featured a mixed morphology containing some exfoliated clay sheets together with nano-sized clay tactoids. At these filler loadings, the melt viscosity, tensile strength and Young?s modulus increased. Dynamic mechanical analysis showed that the glass transition temperature of the polymer increased by as much as 5 ?C when 27. 5 wt. % montmorillonite was added and 10 ?C when 30 wt. % vermiculite was added. This indicates that the high interfacial surface area, presented by the clay platelets dispersed in the matrix, significantly impaired the polymer chain mobility. A further goal of the research was to extend the application of organo-modified vermiculite to the semi-crystalline polyamide- 11. In this particular case, organomodified- and unmodified vermiculite and commercial sepiolite (Pangel S 9) were considered. The clays were melt-compounded into the polyamide- 11 to form products that contained either no filler, i. e. neat polyamide- 11 or 10 wt. % clay. The aspects that were addressed included the effect of vermiculite organomodification, the effect of the shape of the clays, the aspect ratio of the particles, and the degree of dispersion that was achieved on properties of the generated polyamide- 11 /bio-nanocomposites. The emphasis was given to the mechanical and flame retardant properties. Polyamide- 11 /clay <b>bio-nanocomposites</b> were successfully prepared. Tensile properties results showed improvements in tensile strength and Young?s modulus increased with the presence of the nano-fillers. Young?s modulus of the <b>bio-nanocomposites</b> was almost the double of that of the neat polymer. Thermo-mechanical results also showed improvements in storage modulus with the addition of all particles, especially in the temperature range corresponding to the rubbery plateau (above the glass transition temperature). Cone calorimeter test results showed that the peak heat release rate and smoke production rate values of the polyamide- 11 /clays significantly decreased compared with those of neat polymer. This indicates that the addition of clays not only decreased the flammability of polyamide but also effectively reduced smoke production. The key findings of the thesis are: ? The ?surfactant-free organo-modification approach? offers an alternative to conventional clay modification routes based on cationic surfactants. It provides additives suitable for the improvement of the properties of amorphous polyamide matrices. ? The solution casting route allows the preparation of amorphous polyamide/clay nanocomposites with a very high clay content, i. e. approaching 30 wt. %. ? There are at least three stiffening mechanisms operating in amorphous polyamide/clay <b>bio-nanocomposites.</b> The reinforcing effect of the high stiffness inorganic flakes is the primary contributor. Together with the chain confinement effect, that expresses itself in an apparent increase in the glass transition temperature, this provided an adequate rationalisation of the stiffness variation below the glass transition temperature. However, an additional stiffening effect is indicated at temperatures above the glass transition temperature. The mechanism may involve dynamic network formation based on fluctuating hydrogen bonding interactions between the matrix polymer chains and the filler particles. ? From an engineering viewpoint, the good mechanical and fire retardant properties obtained with the vermiculite samples are very encouraging considering the inexpensive nature of this filler. ? The organo-modification of vermiculite and sepiolite is not necessary for the preparation of polyamide- 11 /clay <b>bio-nanocomposites</b> with excellent mechanical and thermal properties.

40|$|The {{development}} of green nanocomposites based on biopolymers and bio-based nanofillers has attracted over the {{recent years the}} attention of academic and industrial research. Indeed, these nanocomposites could replace some oil-derived polymers and thus helping to overcome environmental problems. In this regard, PLA as matrix and polysaccharide nanocrystals as fillers are the most promising components to obtain high-performance green <b>bio-nanocomposites</b> suitable for different applications, particularly for packaging and biomedical applications. Indeed, at present, due to its processability, mechanical and biological properties, {{as well as its}} commercial availability, poly(lactic acid) (PLA) possesses one of the highest potentials among biopolymers whereas polysaccharide nanocrystals can be considered the most promising bio-based reinforcements due to their availability, renewability, versatility, biodegradability and high aspect ratio. Aim of this review is to give an overview on the preparation routes and main properties of PLA/polysaccharide nanocomposites highlighting the main differences among the three main polysaccharide nanocrystals, i. e. cellulose, chitin, and starch...|$|R
40|$|The {{management}} {{of solid waste}} {{is a growing concern}} in many countries. Municipal solid waste is a major component of the total solid waste generated by society, and the composting of municipal solid waste has gained some attention even though a composting treatment for it is not yet widespread. It may not be realistic to replace large portions of these plastics with biodegradable materials, and it may be more important to separate plastics unsuitable for the composting process at the generating spots. However, for food packaging, there is still a great deal of interest in using biodegradable plastics that are difficult to sort at the generation spots. Under these circumstances, nanocomposites of biodegradable polymers as matrix and nanoparticles, that can be degraded along with organic wastes during composting could be a solution. Therefore, this chapter aims to give an overview on the biodegradability studies of <b>bio-nanocomposites.</b> It will focus on different polymers, nanocomposites containing different clay types and inorganic particles exposed under different environments...|$|R
