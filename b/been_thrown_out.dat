5|$|On July 11, Kinsler stole {{third base}} for the 21st time in his career, {{building}} on his team record, without ever having <b>been</b> <b>thrown</b> <b>out.</b> On July 19, he led off {{the bottom of the}} first inning with a home run, and 12 innings later he broke a 3–3 tie with a two-run, walk-off home run. Only four times before in major league history had the same batter led off the bottom of the first inning with a home run, and ended the game with another homer. Kinsler suffered a strained left hamstring on July 28, and missed 11 games while on the disabled list.|$|E
5|$|The {{national}} spotlight shone {{briefly on}} Feldman on August 16, 2006, when he sparked a violent bench-clearing brawl {{in the ninth}} inning of a game between the Rangers and the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. Tensions between the two division rivals were already high after two Ranger starting pitchers — Adam Eaton and Vicente Padilla — had been ejected in previous games that month for throwing at Angel hitters, along with Texas manager Buck Showalter. Before Feldman took the mound in relief, on a night with a game-time temperature of 101 degrees, two Angel pitchers (Kevin Gregg and Brendan Donnelly) had already <b>been</b> <b>thrown</b> <b>out</b> of the game for hitting Ranger batters, and Angel manager Mike Scioscia and acting manager/bench coach Ron Roenicke had been ejected as well.|$|E
5|$|On 22 December 2010, a {{week after}} the ICC Prosecutor {{announced}} the individuals he was seeking to prosecute, the Kenyan National Assembly passed a motion seeking to withdraw Kenya as a State Party to the Rome Statute, the treaty which established the International Criminal Court. The motion, which was introduced by Assembly Member Isaac Ruto had previously <b>been</b> <b>thrown</b> <b>out</b> of the National Assembly by Deputy Speaker Farah Maalim who ruled it was unconstitutional; however an amended version was introduced the following day and passed. During the debate, the Minister for Energy Kiraitu Murungi claimed the ICC was a colonialist, imperialist court. This motion did not itself affect Kenya's status as a State Party to the Rome Statute, but rather obliges ministers to move to repeal Kenya's International Crimes Act which ratified the Rome Statute and made necessarily changes to Kenyan's criminal code. In February 2011, Kenya appealed to the United Nations Security Council, asking it to defer the trials at The Hague. Some critics in Kenya have also questioned the constitutionality of the Rome Statute, arguing that it is incompatible with the Constitution of Kenya, which was passed by a referendum in 2010.|$|E

5|$|The {{mutilated}} body of {{the fourth}} woman, prostitute Annie Chapman, was discovered at about 6:00am on Saturday 8 September on the ground near a doorway {{in the back yard}} of 29 Hanbury Street, Spitalfields. Chapman had left her lodgings at 2am on the day she was murdered, with the intention of getting money from a client to pay her rent. Her throat was cut from left to right. She had been disembowelled, and her intestines had <b>been</b> <b>thrown</b> <b>out</b> of her abdomen over each of her shoulders. The morgue examination revealed that part of her uterus was missing. The pathologist, George Bagster Phillips, was of the opinion that the murderer must have possessed anatomical knowledge to have sliced out the reproductive organs in a single movement with a blade about 6–8inches (15–20cm) long. However, the idea that the murderer possessed surgical skill was dismissed by other experts. As the bodies were not examined extensively at the scene, it has also been suggested that the organs were actually removed by mortuary staff, who took advantage of bodies that had already been opened to extract organs that they could sell as surgical specimens.|$|E

25|$|Aiming to {{increase}} sales, Alexander P. de Seversky personally took a demonstrator {{on a tour}} of Europe in early 1939. As a result of this demonstration, Sweden ordered 15 EP-106 fighters on 29 June 1939, a development of the P-35 powered by a 1,050hp (783kW) R-1830-45, which improved performance by over 25mph (40km/h) and armed with two 7.9mm (.311in) machine guns in the cowl and two 13.2mm (.52in) machine guns in the wings. A second order for 45 EP-106s was placed on 11 October 1939, with a third order for 60 aircraft, placed on 6 January 1940, although by this time Seversky had <b>been</b> <b>thrown</b> <b>out</b> of the company bearing his name by the board of directors, with the company renaming itself Republic Aviation.

Widfara, one of Harding's men from the Wold, is a sole survivor of his attack, and believes everyone else, including Harding's son Leodwig, killed.|$|E
500|$|The {{reaction}} {{of the public and}} the press was that the case had <b>been</b> <b>thrown</b> <b>out</b> because of direct pressure from the government, and that this had happened behind closed doors. MacDonald was [...] "furious", and the opinion of the Liberal and Conservative parties was that the government was attempting to pervert the course of justice. On 30 September Sir Kingsley Wood, a Conservative MP, asked the Prime Minister in Parliament whether he had instructed the Director of Public Prosecutions to withdraw the case. MacDonald replied that [...] "I was not consulted regarding either the institution or the subsequent withdrawal of these proceedings".|$|E

Producer Nigel Godrich made his name with Radiohead, working as an audio engineer on The Bends and as their producer on every studio album since. He has been dubbed the [...] "sixth member" [...] of the band, in an allusion to George Martin being called the [...] "Fifth Beatle". In 2016, Godrich said of the collaboration: [...] "I can only ever have one band like Radiohead who I've worked with for this many years. That's a very deep and profound relationship. The Beatles could only have ever had one George Martin; they couldn't have switched producers halfway through their career.

500|$|Bilson and DeMeo then {{submitted}} their seven-page film {{treatment to}} Disney, but the studio put their script through an endless series of revisions. Over five years, Disney fired and rehired Bilson and DeMeo three times. DeMeo explained that [...] "Disney {{felt that they}} needed {{a different approach to}} the script, which meant bringing in someone else. But those scripts were thrown out and we were always brought back on". They found the studio's constant tinkering with the screenplay to be a frustrating process as [...] "executives would like previously excised dialogue three months later. Scenes that had <b>been</b> <b>thrown</b> <b>out</b> two years ago were put back in. What was the point"? DeMeo said. One of Bilson and De Meo's significant revisions to the script over the years was to make Cliff and Jenny's romance more believable and avoid cliché aspects that would stereotype Jenny as a damsel in distress. The numerous project delays forced Dear to drop out as director. Joe Johnston, a fan of the comic book, immediately offered his services as director when he found out Disney owned the film rights. Johnston was quickly hired and pre-production started in early 1990. After Bilson and De Meo's third major rewrite, Disney finally greenlighted The Rocketeer.|$|E
500|$|Between January 1, 2008 and mid-October 2008, over 666,000 Ohioans {{registered}} to vote either {{for the first time}} or with updated voter information, and over 200,000 of them provided driver's licenses or Social Security numbers that do not match government records. [...] Over 20% of these voters are from Cuyahoga County, which is heavily Democratic. [...] Also, many of the newly registered voters were the result of voter registration drives to register voters for Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton for the March 4, 2008 Ohio Democratic primary. The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, in a 9-6 decision, ruled against Brunner on October 14, 2008 in deciding that extra steps must be taken to authenticate these registrants and Jeffrey Sutton's majority opinion suggested that these misregistered voters cast provisional ballots. [...] Historically, 20% of provisional ballots have <b>been</b> <b>thrown</b> <b>out.</b> [...] As a result of the ruling, Brunner's Office of the Ohio Secretary of State must provide each county with a list of registrants with mismatching information and provide direction on a proper course of action. [...] There are federal laws barring purging voters from the election rolls within 90 days of an election. [...] This issue {{is considered to be a}} partisan one with Republicans favoring greater scrutiny, and the justices voted almost along party lines based on the United States President that appointed them.|$|E
500|$|Pressure {{to reverse}} the {{restrictions}} grew after the statutory instruments of Section 31 of the Irish government's Broadcasting Authority Act 1960 lapsed in January 1994. These had prohibited radio and television interviews with representatives of paramilitary groups and Sinn Féin. From that point, anyone in Northern Ireland {{with access to the}} Republic of Ireland's state broadcaster, RTÉ, could hear the voices of anyone still banned from the airwaves by the UK regulations. Responding to the Dublin government's decision, Gerry Adams said, [...] "Over 20 years of political censorship has served to stunt any hopes of a resolution of the conflict. It has denied the right of information. Good riddance." [...] The regulations particularly came under the spotlight during a visit Adams made to the United States in 1994, where he gave a speech that was widely broadcast around the world, but had to be dubbed in the UK because of the ban. In May 1994 the National Union of Journalists launched a legal challenge with the European Commission of Human Rights, seeking to take the British government to court for breach of freedom of expression under the European Convention of Human Rights, but the case was rejected. A similar challenge brought against the Irish government in 1991 over its broadcast ban had also <b>been</b> <b>thrown</b> <b>out.</b>|$|E

500|$|Newspapers also reported, in July 1829, {{that the}} Duke had <b>been</b> <b>thrown</b> <b>out</b> of Lord Lyndhurst's house for assaulting his wife Sarah, Lady Lyndhurst. In early 1830, {{a number of}} {{newspapers}} printed articles hinting that Ernest {{was having an affair}} with Lady Graves, a mother of fifteen now past fifty. In February 1830, Lord Graves wrote a note to his wife expressing his confidence in her innocence, then cut his own throat. Two days after Lord Graves's death (and the day after the inquest), The Times printed an article connecting Lord Graves's death with Sellis's. After being shown the suicide note, The Times withdrew its implication there might be a connection between the two deaths. Nonetheless, many believed the Duke responsible for the suicide—or guilty of a second murder. The Duke later stated that he had been [...] "accused of every crime in the decalogue". Ernest's biographer, Anthony Bird, states that while there is no proof, he has no doubt that the rumours against the Duke were spread by the Whigs for political ends. Another biographer, Geoffrey Willis, pointed out that no scandal had attached itself to the Duke during the period of over a decade when he resided in Germany; it was only when he announced his intent to return to Britain that [...] "a campaign of unparalleled viciousness" [...] began against him. The Duke of Wellington once told Charles Greville that George IV had said of Ernest's unpopularity, [...] "there was never a father well with his son, or husband with his wife, or lover with his mistress, or a friend with his friend, that he did not try to make mischief between them." [...] According to Bird, Ernest was the most unpopular man in England.|$|E
500|$|Years later, after {{consulting}} with another lawyer, Selletti made another attempt at suing Carey and Sony. His lawyer, Jeffrey Levitt, had uncovered {{the fact that}} the film was released in October 1992, a full six weeks prior to the November 22 dating in Carey's notebook. Additionally, [...] "Heart of a Hero", which was written by Luther Vandross for the film, was submitted in January 1992, making it impossible for [...] "Hero" [...] to have been the original choice of song for the soundtrack. After uncovering further tapes from the studio dating to the summer of 1992, recordings provided evidence that Carey and Afansieff had indeed discussed and had parts of the song completed well before the film's October release. Following the evidence from both parties, the judge dismissed the case, ruling in Carey's favor for the second time. Following the dismissal of the case, Rhonda Dimmie, another songwriter and an independent singer, filed a lawsuit against Carey, this time claiming the song to have borrowed heavily from her song [...] "Be Your Own Hero". During the short deposition made by Carey, Afanasieff revealed that they had written the song in two days during the summer of 1992, [...] "within a matter of hours." [...] Soon after, the case was dismissed, with the judge claiming there to not be sufficient evidence on Dimmie's behalf. Following the lawsuits, in 2001 Selletti made further hints to plan another lawsuit, as well as a forensic team of specialists to conduct research on the incident. Following the suits, Cindy Berger, Carey's publicist released the following statement: [...] "This case has <b>been</b> <b>thrown</b> <b>out</b> of court three times. The federal judge after hearing Selletti's story and considering all the evidence ruled the case was a 'complete fabrication' and that it was filed 'to extort a settlement from deep-pocket defendants." ...|$|E
