However, salaries have risen sharply in recent years, and many players prefer to hunt for a better salary rather than stay where {{they are in the}} hope of being awarded a benefit at some point.

The U.S. Railroad Retirement Board (or [...] "RRB") is an independent agency {{in the executive branch}} of the United States government created in 1935 to administer a social insurance program providing retirement benefits to the country's railroad workers. Railroad retirement Tier I payroll taxes are coordinated with social security taxes so that employees and employers pay Tier I taxes {{at the same rate as}} social security taxes and have the same benefits. In addition, both workers and employers pay Tier II taxes (about 6.2% in 2005), which are used to finance railroad retirement and disability benefit payments that are over and above social security levels.

The methodology permits to assess different dimensions of unemployment <b>benefit</b> <b>systems</b> and to consider alternative relevant benchmarks. Looking at all relevant dimensions allows to better gauge how unemployment <b>benefit</b> <b>systems</b> perform in terms of their multi-faceted objectives (such as income support and stabilisation, incentives to take up work) and to have a more thorough assessment of each objective. Comparisons with alternative benchmarks offer the possibility of assessing against more meaningful country comparators, which take into account similarities in terms of economic fundamentals, institutions and policy settings. The methodology is applied to EU countries and results are discussed...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss the role of tax and <b>benefit</b> <b>systems</b> {{in the context of}} the {{functioning}} of the labour markets and review recent progress made by EU Member States in reforming tax and <b>benefit</b> <b>systems</b> with a view to increasing economic incentives for higher employment and job creation. On the basis of the most recent comparable data and indicators, we try to assess whether concrete measures are being taken by Member States to alleviate the tax pressure on labour and especially on the low paid. We also examine <b>benefit</b> <b>systems</b> (especially unemployment <b>benefit</b> <b>systems)</b> with a view to evaluating recent reforms to increase employment incentives. Our main conclusions are that while Member States have started to ease the tax burden on labour, progress on reforms has been unequal between tax and benefit systems: the emphasis has clearly been on the tax side while benefit reforms have mostly been relatively minor, and without adequate attention to the interaction between tax and benefit schemes. In view of the goal of full employment, to which the Union and the Member States are committed, it has become more urgent to speed up reforms of tax and <b>benefit</b> <b>systems</b> in order to increase labour supply and reduce structural unemployment. Further reforms aimed at making work pay should take a more comprehensive approach, including a review of the interaction between tax and <b>benefit</b> <b>systems</b> and their joint incentives to work. In general, further efforts are needed to reduce the overall generosity of benefit schemes, including eligibility rules, and to strengthen their interaction with active labour market policies in order to enhance the efficiency of active policies. This strategy could help to move people from benefit dependency to work, while preserving an adequate level of social protection for those in need. effects of taxation, labour supply, labour demand, tax reforms, benefits,...|$|R

5000|$|China is also {{experiencing}} {{a gap between}} housing price and affordability as it moves away from an in-kind welfare <b>benefit</b> <b>system</b> to a market-oriented allocation system (Hui et al. 2007). Most urban housing prior to 1978 in the planned-economy era consisted of nearly free dwellings produced and allocated by the unsustainable single-channel state-funded system. The goal of China's housing reform started in 1978 was to gradually transform housing from a [...] "free good" [...] to a [...] "subsidized good" [...] and eventually to a [...] "commodity", the price of which reflects true production costs and a market profit margin. In 1998 China accelerated its urban housing reform further moving away from an in-kind welfare <b>benefit</b> <b>system</b> to a market-oriented allocation system, with the state reducing its role in housing provision. The reform is followed by increasing home ownership, housing consumption, real estate investment, as well as skyrocketing housing price.|$|E
