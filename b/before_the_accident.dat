5|$|LeMond {{was in a}} {{car crash}} on the morning of January 30, 2013. He was driving through wintery and icy {{conditions}} to his dentist in Wayzata, Minnesota, when he lost control of his car. LeMond suffered a concussion and was left with no memory of the incident. According to Associated Press, a Plymouth police report says LeMond left the road, hit a fence and shrubs, and then hit an embankment before ending up in the backyard of a home. LeMond may have lost consciousness <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>accident,</b> according to his wife Kathy, and he suffered a compression fracture in his back and would have to wear a brace for three months. The accident curtailed LeMond's public appearances {{in the first half of}} 2013, but he made a full recovery.|$|E

5|$|On April 4, 1955, a United Airlines check captain, Stanley C. Hoyt, age 45, was {{carrying}} out instrument rating checks {{on two of}} the airline's pilots. Hoyt had been employed by United Airlines since 1937, and had 9,763 flying hours experience, 549 of which were in a DC-6. He was training the two pilots, Henry M. Dozier, age 40, and Vernis H. Webb, age 35, so {{they would be able to}} retain an instrument rating qualification, allowing them to fly under instrument flight rules. The aircraft was a Douglas DC-6, registration N37512, serial number 43001. The airframe had flown 22,068 flying hours, and had undergone an inspection 105 hours <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>accident.</b> The aircraft was powered by four Pratt & Whitney R2800-CB16 engines, fitted with Hamilton Standard 43E60-317 propellers.|$|E
5|$|The third {{practice}} session on Saturday saw limited running as well, as training was halted {{due to a}} massive crash by Carlos Sainz Jr.. The Spaniard lost control of his car going into turn 13, hit a wall {{and went on to}} crash into the safety barriers, burying the nose of his car in the process. The session was stopped while Sainz was taken {{out of the car and}} transported to hospital, albeit uninjured. Practice was not resumed afterwards and the time of 1:38.561 set by Nico Rosberg <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>accident</b> remained the fastest lap of the session. He was more than seven-tenths of a second faster than Valtteri Bottas in second, with Lewis Hamilton another tenth behind. Sainz's teammate Max Verstappen finished the session 17th fastest after spinning in the final corner.|$|E
5|$|In October 1932, Ravel {{suffered}} {{a blow to}} the head in a taxi accident. The injury was not thought serious at the time, but in a study for the British Medical Journal in 1988 the neurologist R. A. Henson concludes that it may have exacerbated an existing cerebral condition. As early as 1927 close friends had been concerned at Ravel's growing absent-mindedness, and within a year of the accident he started to experience symptoms suggesting aphasia. <b>Before</b> <b>the</b> <b>accident</b> he had begun work on music for a film, Don Quixote (1933), but he was unable to meet the production schedule, and Jacques Ibert wrote most of the score. Ravel completed three songs for baritone and orchestra intended for the film; they were published as Don Quichotte à Dulcinée. The manuscript orchestral score is in Ravel's hand, but Lucien Garban and Manuel Rosenthal helped in transcription. Ravel composed no more after this. The exact nature of his illness is unknown. Experts have ruled out the possibility of a tumour, and have variously suggested frontotemporal dementia, Alzheimer's disease and Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease. Though no longer able to write music or perform, Ravel remained physically and socially active until his last months. Henson notes that Ravel preserved most or all his auditory imagery and could still hear music in his head.|$|E
25|$|<b>Before</b> {{releasing}} <b>the</b> <b>accident</b> {{scene and}} allowing restoration of service, the NTSB also conducted a final sight distance test. An identical Metrolink train and pair of Union Pacific locomotives were brought {{together at the}} point of impact and slowly backed away from each other. The test showed that the trains' engineers could not see each other until less than five seconds <b>before</b> <b>the</b> collision.|$|R

5|$|Polish {{studies found}} that {{although}} the mushroom bioaccumulates mercury and cobalt from the soil, occasional consumption of mushrooms should not cause maximum allowable intake doses to be exceeded. Similar conclusions about safety were made in a Polish study of the mushroom's ability to accumulate organochlorine compounds. Different methods of preparation for consumption affect the leaching rate of cadmium, lead, and mercury. After the 1986 Chernobyl disaster, several studies showed I.badia bioaccumulates radioactive caesium, 137Cs. 137Cs is produced in nuclear power plants following the chain decay of 235U to 137Te, and has a half-life of thirty years. A German study showed that mushrooms collected from 1986 to 1988 had radiocaesium contents that were 8.3 to 13.6 times greater than mushrooms collected <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>accident</b> in 1985. This caesium-sequestering effect {{is caused by a}} brown pigment, the polyphenol compound norbadione A, which is related to a family of mushroom pigments known as pulvinic acids. Norbadione A has been investigated for its ability to provide a protective effect against the damaging effects of ionizing radiation. Tests with cell cultures and mice show that although it has some protective effect, it is toxic to cells in higher doses. A new series of alkali chelators based on the structure of norbadione A has been reported. The mushroom may have potential as a bioremediation agent to clean up contaminated sites.|$|E
