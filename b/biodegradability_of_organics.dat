40|$|Municipal {{solid waste}} (MSW) is slow to {{stabilize}} under conventional anaerobic landfill conditions, demanding long-term monitoring and pollution control. Provision of aerobic conditions offers several advantages including accelerated leachate stabilization, increased landfill airspace recovery {{and a reduction}} in greenhouse gas emissions. Air injection was applied over 130 days to bench-scale bioreactors containing fresh and aged MSW representative of newly constructed and pre-existing landfill conditions. In the fresh MSW simulation bioreactors, aeration reduced the aver-age time to stabilization of leachate pH by 46 days, TSS by 42 days, TDS by 84 days, BOD 5 by 46 days and COD by 32 days. In addition, final leachate concentrations were consistently lower in aerated test cells. There was no indication of a gradual decrease in the concentration of ammonia, and it is likely this high ammonia concentration would continue to be problematic in bioreactor landfill applications. This study focussed only on <b>biodegradability</b> <b>of</b> <b>organics</b> in the solid waste. The concentrations of the nonreactive or conservative substances such as chloride and/or heavy metals remain in the bioreactor landfills due to the continuous recir-culation of leachate. The results of this study demonstrate the potential for air injection to accelerate stabilization of municipal solid waste, with greatest influence on fresh waste with a high biodegradable organic fraction.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the fate and toxicity of total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH), polyacrylamide and acrylamide monomer in soil under aerobic conditions for mixtures of commercially available products that have application as an anti traction material (ATM) (Southwest Research Institute patent pending for ATM). The aerobic biodegradability of petroleum hydrocarbons in several formulations was determined using a simple microcosm/respirometric method based on carbon dioxide production and TPH depletion. The microcosms consisted of 1 L mason jars fitted with sealed rubber caps that allowed headspace gas samples to be collected in a sealed system. The analytical procedure included the detection of peaks for the compounds in TPH by gas chromatography and identification of peaks with a mass spectrometer (GCMS). Mole fractions of the major components in TPH (undecane, dodecane, tridecane and tetradecane) were calculated from the detected peaks. The extracted soil was analyzed for total organic carbon (TOC) content in order to examine the carbon balance. The method described here provides a simple and inexpensive method for determining the aerobic <b>biodegradability</b> <b>of</b> <b>organics</b> in soil. Results indicated that, for the polyacrylamide (PAM) treatments in soil, there was no significant CO 2 production in the headspace of the microcosm within the experimental time period. Total organic carbon values obtained for the initial and final soil showed no significant PAM biodegradation within a time period of 161 days. This confirms that PAM biodegradation is a slow process and may take several years...|$|E

40|$|The high {{pollution}} load in wastewater {{at the beginning}} of a rain event is commonly known to originate from the erosion of sewer sediments due to the increased flow rate under storm weather conditions. It is essential to characterize the <b>biodegradability</b> <b>of</b> <b>organic</b> matter during a storm event in order to quantify the effect it can have further downstream to the receiving water via discharges from Combined Sewer Overflow (CSO). The approach is to characterize the pollutograph during first flush. The pollutograph shows the variation in COD and TSS during a first flush event. These parameters measure the quantity <b>of</b> <b>organic</b> matter present. However these parameters do not indicate detailed information on the <b>biodegradability</b> <b>of</b> the <b>organic</b> matter. Such detailed knowledge can be obtained by dividing the total COD into fractions with different microbial properties. To do so oxygen uptake rate (OUR) measurements on batches of wastewater have shown itself to be a versatile technique. Together with a conceptual understanding of the microbial transformation taking place, OUR measurements lead to the desired fractionation of the COD. OUR results indicated that the highest biodegradability is associated with the initial part of a storm event. The information on physical and biological processes in the sewer can be used to better manage sediment in sewers which can otherwise result in depletion of dissolved oxygen in receiving waters via discharges from CSOs...|$|R

When poplar leaf was used as a sole substrate, the cumulative biogas yield was low, about 163 mL (g volatile solid (VS)) (- 1) after 45 days of digestion with a substrate/inoculum ratio of 2. 5 and a total solid (TS) of 22 %. Under the same condition, the cumulative biogas yield of poplar leaf reached 321 mL (g VS) (- 1) when SM/poplar leaf ratio was 2 : 5 (based on VS). The SM/poplar leaf ratio can determine C/N ratio of the cosubstrate and thus has significant influence on biogas yield.

Based on literature data the model method for anaerobic <b>biodegradability</b> testing <b>of</b> <b>organic</b> compounds was proposed. According to the application, tests were divided into three groups: a) the degradability tests used for the examination of tested material biodegradability; b) the anaerobic biomass activity tests which describe the condition of all fundamental groups of the anaerobic polyculture; and c) the technology tests used for checking and controlling anaerobic processes in the waste treatment plants. Applicability and reliability of the method was verified by many performed experiments. Several samples have been selected for this thesis in order to demonstrate to what degree the tests are representative and the range of their application. By means of the developed method the stimulation effect of the cell lysate to anaerobic biomass, manifested by the acceleration and intensification of the degradation process, was proven. It was found that the effects of lysates prepared from different materials differ and that they also depend on the preparation. The generation of the lysate in the thickening centrifuge, which was proven in our laboratory, has a particularly significant technological impact.

Under these conditions, the chlorophenols were photodegraded {{in the following order}} of removal rate: PCP > TCP > DCP > CP with only CP and DCP remaining after 40 h of irradiation. The remaining CP (41 mg lâ 1) and DCP (13 mg lâ 1) were then completely removed by biological treatment with an activated sludge mixed culture. Biodegradation did not occur in similar tests conducted with a non-irradiated mixture due to the high microbial toxicity of the solution. UV treatment lead to a significant reduction of the phytotoxicity to Lipedium sativum but no further reduction of phytotoxicity was observed after biological treatment. Evidence was found that the pollutants were partially photodegraded into toxic and non-biodegradable products.

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this paper}} is to {{understand}} the temporal changes in planktonic populations and to highlight some important factors that control the biological functioning and evolution of a recently flooded reservoir, the Sep reservoir (Massif Central, France). To achieve this objective, a 1 D vertical coupled physical-biological model was used and developed. It couples relevant physical processes (dispersion, advection and convection) with biological processes taking into account the complexity of interactions within the microbial food web, including the conventional grazing food chain with a microbial loop. Based on numerous data collected in the field over three summers (1996, 1997, and 1998) since the flooding of the reservoir, the model was applied over this period to investigate the evolution of the biological structure over these 3 years. Two main assumptions were tested: (1) <b>biodegradability</b> <b>of</b> <b>organic</b> matter (OM) increases over time leading to easier assimilation by heterotrophic and mixotrophic organisms; and (2) bioavailability of phosphorus increases over time leading to easier uptake by organisms. Based on an accurate description of the physical behavior of the water column and on numerous physical and biological available data, the evolution of the microbial food web structure was correctly simulated. During the first year of the study, the plankton community was dominated by mixotrophic organisms and bacteria followed by strictly autotrophic plankton. Then, during the second and third years, autotrophic organism biomass became dominant and reached around 64 % of the total biomass in 1998. The results of this study support the hypothesis that the initial allochthonous dissolved organic matter (DOM) strongly influenced the structure and the functioning of the microbial food web in the reservoir...|$|R
40|$|Moisture {{affects the}} {{physical}} and biological properties of compost and other solid state fermentation matrices. Aerobic microbial systems experience different respiration rates (oxygen uptake and CO 2 evolution) {{as a function of}} moisture content and material type. In this study the microbial respiration rates of 13 compost-bulking materials were measured by a pressure sensor method at 6 different moisture levels. The experimentally determined respiration quotient (RQ) values were used to calculate CO 2 respiration rates from O 2 consumption. The RQ values of all materials were around 1. 0 except for silage, oat straw and leaves which were about 1. 5. A wide range of respiration and heat production rates were observed for different materials, with alfalfa hay, silage, oat straw, and turkey litter having the highest values. These four compost-bulking agents may be particularly suitable for improving internal temperature and pathogen destruction rates for disease-related mortality composting. Optimum moisture content was determined based on measurements across a range that spans the maximum respiration rate. A mechanistic model of moisture kinetics was also used to predict the optimum moisture levels. There was good agreement between experimental observations and modeled optimum moisture content. The optimum moisture content of each material was observed near WHC, which ranged from near 65 to over 85 % on a wet basis for all materials except a highly stabilized yard waste compost (optimum around 30 % w. b.). This study demonstrates the importance of moisture content on the <b>biodegradability</b> <b>of</b> <b>organic</b> materials and specific respiration rates of each material. The results can be used to develop moisture management and process control strategies to maintain compost and cover materials in an acceptable range...|$|R
40|$|International audienceOur {{aim was to}} {{establish}} {{the long-term effects of}} repeated applications after 20 y <b>of</b> <b>organic</b> amendments (farmyard manure at 10 t/ha/y,and urban sewage sludge at two different rates, 10 t/ha/y and 100 t/ha every 2 y) on the quality of a sandy and poorly bufferedsoil (Fluvisol, pH 6). Chemical characteristics and <b>biodegradability</b> <b>of</b> the labile <b>organic</b> matter, which is mainly derived from microbialbiomass and biodegradation products <b>of</b> <b>organic</b> residues, were chosen as indicators for soil quality. The organic C content had reached amaximal value (30. 6 g C/kg in the 100 t sludge-treated soil), i. e. about 2. 5 times that in the control. Six years after the last application,the organic C content and the microbial biomass content remained higher in sludge-treated soils than in the control. In contrast, theproportion <b>of</b> labile <b>organic</b> matter was significantly lower in sludge-treated soils than in manure-treated and control soils. The labileorganic matter of sludge extracts appeared less humified than that of manure-treated and control soils...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the use of ultraviolet (UV) and fluorescence spectroscopy to monitor the changes in <b>biodegradability</b> <b>of</b> dissolved <b>organic</b> matter (DOM) in landfill leachates. Experiments to investigate aerobic biodegradation of leachate DOM were carried out using untreated and treated leachate samples collected from two UK municipal solid waste landfills, L 1 and L 2. Leachate samples collected {{at different stages of}} the aerobic treatment processes were characterized by conventional methods (chemical oxygen demand (COD) and dissolved organic carbon content (DOC)) and also by UV spectroscopy and fluorescence excitation-emission matrix. The laboratory-scale aerobic treatment system achieved reductions in COD and DOC in all of the leachates. Results obtained from UV spectrophotometry indicated that the aromatic character of the leachate decreased during aerobic biodegradation. Additionally, the fluorescence intensity of the leachates decreased to various extents, suggesting degradation of humic, fulvic or protein-like structures during biodegradation. Initial results showed strong relations between fluorescent DOC and fluorescent COD and suggest that the strength of these correlations could be a useful tool in distinguishing sources and <b>biodegradability</b> <b>of</b> DOC cheaply and quickly, although further research using different types of leachates is required...|$|R
40|$|Problem Statement: Oil palm {{production}} {{is a major}} agricultural industry in Malaysia. In 2006, palm oil mills in Malaysia produced more than 58 million tonnes of Palm Oil Mill Effluent (POME). Existing treatment {{in a series of}} open lagoons at high ambient temperatures, results in the uncontrolled production of methane and carbon dioxide, which are both green house gases (GHGs). With the increased worldwide concern on environmentally friendly production processes particularly the emission of methane, it is important to develop an alternative concept for POME treatment. This study elucidates the effects of pre-treatment of palm oil mill effluent by microwave irradiation and ultrasonic on anaerobic digestion. Approach: Effects of pre-treatment on sludge characterisation parameters were monitored. The Soluble Chemical Oxygen Demand (SCOD) /total COD ratio and <b>biodegradability</b> <b>of</b> soluble <b>organic</b> matter increased significantly after both the pre-treatments which indicated an increase in disintegration of the floc structure of the sludge. Three identical bioreactors with working volume of 5 litres were used as anaerobic digesters at 32 - 35 Â°C. The reactors were separately fed with pre-treated sludge (microwave, ultrasonic and combination of microwave and ultrasonic) and control sludge at different Hydraulic Retention Times (HRT) to check for the production of methane. Results: The maximum SCOD/TCOD ratio reached almost 29 % after 30 min of ultrasonic treatment, while it was 45 % after 7 min of microwave irradiation. The BOD 5 /SCOD ratio also increased after the pre-treatments suggesting the <b>biodegradability</b> <b>of</b> the soluble <b>organic</b> material increased during the treatment. It was observed that TVFA released was increased after both the treatments, with microwave treatment showing a higher yield of TVFA. Greatest enhancement in methane production was shown by the 3 min microwave plus 10 min ultrasonic treatment. Conclusion: The microwave in combination with ultrasonic would be a rapid and economical method for sludge pre-treatment for enhancement of biogas production...|$|R
40|$|This study aims {{to compare}} the {{efficiency}} of sonolysis and ozonation in improving anaerobic <b>biodegradability</b> <b>of</b> source sorted <b>organic</b> fraction <b>of</b> municipal solid waste, for the enhancing of biogas production and energy recovery as well. The methane yield <b>of</b> solid <b>organic</b> material anaerobic digestion is significantly affected by substrate availability, which can be favoured by pretreatments. In this investigation, both sonolysis and ozonation effects on substrate solubilisation and anaerobic biodegradability were evaluated under different treatment conditions. Results show that both pretreatments can significantly improve the solubilisation <b>of</b> <b>organic</b> solid waste. However, during ozonation experiments, no correlation was observed between increased solubilisation and biogas production: the application of higher ozone doses {{led to the formation}} of by-products less biodegradable than untreated substrate. This evidence makes the ultrasound process more efficient than ozonation and addresses further studies for sonolysis optimisation as pretreatment for solid waste anaerobic digestion...|$|R
40|$|A new {{inorganic-organic}} hybrid material, {{known as}} ceramer, has been {{prepared by the}} sol-gel process. Î±,Ï-Hydroxyl poly(Îµ-caprolactone) (PCL) {{has been used as}} an organic reagent, as such or after conversion of the hydroxyl end-groups into triethoxysilane end-groups. The novelty has {{to be found in the}} biocompatibility and <b>biodegradability</b> <b>of</b> the <b>organic</b> constitutive component. Since the hydroxyl end-groups of PCL are less reactive than the triethoxysilane counterparts, the preliminary reaction of the hydroxyl end-groups with 3 -isocyanatopropyltriethoxysilane is recommended for decreasing the gelation time and the amount of PCL extractable from the final hybrid material. In this respect, it has been observed that the amount of PCL incorporated into the network is limited by the early vitrification of the reactive system. This drawback can be alleviated by curing the sample at a high enough temperature (100 Â°C). TEM observations have shown that the organic and inorganic phases are intimately mixed when the weight composition in SiO 2 and PCL is close to 50 %. Peer reviewe...|$|R
