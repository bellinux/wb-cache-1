60|$|The two {{men stood}} {{side by side}} upon the grassy bank, Mannering broad-shouldered and vigorous, his clean, hard-cut {{features}} tanned with wind and sun, his eyes bright and vigorous with health; Leslie Borrowdean, once his greatest friend, a man of almost similar physique, but with the <b>bent</b> <b>frame</b> and listless pallor of a dweller in the crowded places of life. Without enthusiasm his tired eyes followed the sweep of Mannering's arm.|$|E
60|$|The guards laid {{their hands}} upon the old man's shoulders, {{and he turned}} and went with them without a word. Through her crack in the wall Bessie watched him go till the dear old head with its fringe of white hairs and the <b>bent</b> <b>frame</b> were no more visible. Then at last, benumbed and {{exhausted}} by the horrors she was passing through, her faculties failed her, and she fell forward in a faint there upon the sacks.|$|E
50|$|For most people, wearing glasses is a {{necessity}} for clear sight, but for four young girls, their spectacles mean so much more. From a teenage girl wearing her glasses with pride and a top idol who uses hers to disguise herself as a regular person, to a couple whose <b>bent</b> <b>frames</b> bring them closer together, a good pair of glasses can not only open your eyes, but also open your heart.|$|R

5|$|The main barn is {{oriented}} on a northâ€“south axis and has {{a conventional}} <b>bent</b> <b>framing</b> and sheathed with vertical boards. It is believed that {{the addition of a}} cupola with a hip roof may have been a later addition to the barn. Photos dating from 1870 confirm its age, but the date of construction for the barn cannot be determined, but it may date from the 18th century. The former ell of the house was converted in a shed and dates to around 1780.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah," [...] replied Silas Croft calmly, [...] "is it so? Then {{she shows}} very good taste, for John Niel is an honest man, Frank Muller, {{and you are}} not. Listen to me," [...] he went on, with a sudden {{outburst}} of passion; [...] "I {{tell you that you}} are a dishonourable man and a villain. I tell you that you murdered the Hottentot Jantje's father, mother, and uncle in cold blood when you were yet a lad. I tell you that the other day you tried to murder John Niel, pretending to mistake him for a buck! And now you, who petitioned for this country to be taken over by the Queen, and have gone round singing out your loyalty {{at the top of your}} voice, come and tell me that you are plotting to bring about an insurrection, and to plunge the land into war, and ask me for Bessie as the price of your protection! But I will tell you something in answer, Frank Muller," [...] and the old man rose up, his keen eyes flashing in wrath, and, straightening his <b>bent</b> <b>frame,</b> he pointed towards the door. [...] "Go out of that door and never come through it again. I rely upon God and the English nation to protect me, and not on such as you, and I would rather see my dear Bessie dead in her coffin than married to a knave and traitor and a murderer like Frank Muller. Go!" ...|$|E
60|$|About {{a quarter}} of an hour before the second ringing of the bell {{individuals}} of the congregation begin to appear. The earliest is invariably an old woman in black whose <b>bent</b> <b>frame</b> and rounded shoulders are evidently laden with some heavy affliction which she is eager to rest upon the altar. Would that the Sabbath came twice as often, for the sake of that sorrowful old soul! There is an elderly man, also, who arrives in good season and leans against the corner of the tower, just within the line of its shadow, looking downward with a darksome brow. I sometimes fancy that the old woman is the happier of the two. After these, others drop in singly and by twos and threes, either disappearing through the doorway or taking their stand in its vicinity. At last, and always with an unexpected sensation, the bell turns in the steeple overhead and throws out an irregular clangor, jarring the tower to its foundation. As if there were magic in the sound, the sidewalks of the street, both up and down along, are immediately thronged with two long lines of people, all converging hitherward and streaming into the church. Perhaps the far-off roar of a coach draws nearer--a deeper thunder by its contrast with the surrounding stillness--until it sets down the wealthy worshippers at the portal among their humblest brethren. Beyond that entrance--in theory, at least--there are no distinctions of earthly rank; nor, indeed, by the goodly apparel which is flaunting in the sun would there seem to be such on the hither side. Those pretty girls! Why will they disturb my pious meditations? Of all days in the week, they should strive to look least fascinating on the Sabbath, instead of heightening their mortal loveliness, as if to rival the blessed angels and keep our thoughts from heaven. Were I the minister himself, I must needs look. One girl is white muslin from the waist upward and black silk downward to her slippers; a second blushes from top-knot to shoe-tie, one universal scarlet; another shines of a pervading yellow, as if she had made a garment of the sunshine. The greater part, however, have adopted a milder cheerfulness of hue. Their veils, especially when the wind raises them, give a lightness to the general effect and make them appear like airy phantoms as they flit up the steps and vanish into the sombre doorway. Nearly all--though it is very strange that I should know it--wear white stockings, white as snow, and neat slippers laced crosswise with black ribbon pretty high above the ankles. A white stocking is infinitely more effective than a black one.|$|E
50|$|In October 1971, McCulloch played {{guitar in}} concert with John Mayall and the Bluesbreakers in England and Germany. On 31 October 1971 McCulloch's band <b>Bent</b> <b>Frame</b> made its {{performance}} debut in London. The band subsequently renamed itself the Jimmy McCulloch Band and toured England and Scotland in support of Leslie West's Mountain in February 1972. By then, McCulloch had done session work for Klaus Voorman, Harry Nilsson, Steve Ellis, John Entwistle, and others.|$|E
5000|$|The first flying 18 footers {{were either}} carvel or clinker built clinker planked with {{multiple}} steam <b>bent</b> <b>frames.</b> Cotton sails were used and spars were solid wood. The crew number varied {{according to the}} wind strength, often with a boy carried to bail out water. Initial designs were conventional displacement shapes with emphasis on narrow waterlines. In the early 1950s The Sydney boats put emphasis on carrying large extra sails down wind called ringtails. These were set outside the main with light spars top and bottom. They were carried in addition to spinnakers. In very light conditions watersails were carried under the main boom.|$|R
50|$|The Dutch barn design {{reflects}} a pre-industrial era of agriculture. They {{were used by}} farmers whose main product was grain, primarily wheat, with a central threshing floor and side aisles to serve as small granaries. The <b>bent</b> <b>framing</b> system is its most distinctively Dutch aspect, in direct contrast to the more box-like approach to framing preferred by builders working from English traditions, which began to predominate in the region over the later 18th century. This lent them their distinctive one-and-a-half-story front-gabled appearance. Later, when farmers began to expand into dairy and other products requiring more complex techniques, the early Dutch barns were often expanded along English lines, their framing subsumed into larger buildings and their large front entrances replaced by smaller side doors.|$|R

50|$|The {{interurban}} car Sacramento Northern 1005 (originally Oakland, Antioch and Eastern 1005) {{has been}} a focus of restoration activity in the last 10 years. The BAERA operated many excursions in its early years, and this car was used quite frequently. It was often hauled around in freight trains to reach an excursion site, and sometimes suffered damage in these trips, including a badly <b>bent</b> <b>frame</b> in June 1962. The damage has been repaired and the car has been restored to its 1934 configuration.|$|E
30|$|Curved wood {{can be used}} in many ways, but {{deforming}} {{process of}} wood is difficult. Deforming of wood is easier when the wood is thin, so that the defects of curved wood can be prevented. In a uniform thickness such as chair legs, <b>bent</b> <b>frame</b> with two layers is of low cost and less equipment when compared with <b>bent</b> <b>frame</b> with multi-layers. Timber from small-diameter log such as poplar wood can be used for this process. Deforming and bending can be operated with various treatment methods. The treatment methods include the thermal treatment (hot water and steam), chemical materials, treatments through the combination of materials, pressure, and high temperature. Wood texture, its deformation characteristics, elastic or plastic behavior, and thermal treatment affect the efficacy of wood forming [1 â€“ 3]. A lot of research have been presented in this area.|$|E

5000|$|When Alden {{achieved}} {{his great}} {{success in the}} 1932 Bermuda race, the yachting world was already beginning to see changes in boat design. Olin Stephens' yawl Dorade, which had already won the Transatlantic and Fastnet races in 1931, was the winner in Class B. Stephens followed this with another winner, Stormy Weather which won the 1936 Transatlantic Race to Norway by a wide margin. This began a long-running rivalry between the two designers. Alden's designs depended on {{a certain amount of}} inside ballast, where Stephens' adopted the idea of all-outside ballast. Stephens' boats were of lighter construction, using steam <b>bent</b> <b>frames,</b> rather than the sawn frames favored by Alden. Over the next thirty years, Alden designed over 1,000 boats, including the 63.5' schooner [...] "When and If" [...] for General Patton, though of them all the 744 Rena series have been considered the most admired. Eric Hiscock, a leading yachtsman of the time, said [...] "I considered her {{to be one of the}} most beautiful yachts I had ever seen, â€¦quite perfect in (her) sea-kindly grace and harmony".|$|R

50|$|The oldest type of {{engineered}} {{boats are}} dugout canoes, which were built by hollowing out a log. These designs generally had rounded bottoms, which made {{best use of}} the round shape of the logs. Traditional planked hulls in most cultures are built by placing wooden planks oriented parallel to the waterflow and attached to <b>bent</b> wooden <b>frames.</b> This also produced a rounded hull, generally with a sharp bottom edge to form the keel. Planked boats were built in this manner for most of history.|$|R
25|$|Despite the {{increasing}} popularity of contact lenses and laser corrective eye surgery, glasses remain very common, as their technology has improved. For instance, {{it is now}} possible to purchase frames made of special memory metal alloys that return to their correct shape after being <b>bent.</b> Other <b>frames</b> have spring-loaded hinges. Either of these designs offers dramatically better ability to withstand the stresses of daily wear and the occasional accident. Modern frames are also often made from strong, light-weight materials such as titanium alloys, which were not available in earlier times.|$|R

40|$|In {{the early}} Middle Ages, ships {{could be built}} {{wherever}} a limited range of wood types (primarily oak) was available on the coast. The larger ships of later centuries, however, ideally required the wood of several different types of trees. The hulls were built of oak; the crooked oak wood used in constructing the <b>bent</b> <b>frames</b> of the hulls was increasingly obtainable from the copses that grew near the large cities and on the rivers of Central Europe. Due to its much lower volumetric weight, coniferous wood was much better suited for masts. This wood can be more easily transported by floating, and ships built in part with coniferous wood are lighter and easier to maneuver. Coniferous wood was not uniformly available to the shipyards in the various port cities of Central Europe. Pine, spruce and fir trees in Southern Germany provided the softwood that was floated {{to the mouth of}} the Rhine. Shipbuilders on the mouth of the Elbe imported it from Bohemia and the pine forests of Eastern Central Europe. It was also possible to transport the wood of pines and spruces on the rivers flowing into the Baltic Sea further east. ln the Baltic Provinces, Finland and Scandinavia, spruce and pine wood grew quite near the coast. On the other hand, little or no coniferous wood could be floated down the rivers Ems and Weser. Scotland was the only area of the British lsles with a natural supply of pine wood. The discrepancies in the availability of wood were most apparent during the High and Late Middle Ages, a period when the volume of wood trade by sea was still limited. At that time, the shipyards of the Netherlands were thus clearly at an advantage with regard to wood supply. ln later times the differences in wood availability on the coast were compensated by seaborne wood trade.

50|$|Despite the {{appearance}} of being a huge, solid building, it consists of long, narrow, multi-storey workshops only 16 ft wide, surrounding an open courtyard. This was a common arrangement at the time allowing natural light to reach workbenches from two sides. With floors constructed of hollow bricks tied with wrought iron, it was fireproof, removing the need for insurance. The multicoloured brickwork decorates a design reminiscent of renaissance Florence. Recycled steam from the works engines went to a Turkish bath in {{the northern end of}} the building; visitors to the Turkish Baths, also indulged in other leisure activities there, such as chess, fencing and billiards. Now flat-roofed, it originally had pyramids on each corner tower. A bomb dropped into the courtyard at some time during the Birmingham Blitz of World War II, and the <b>bent</b> window <b>frames</b> were visible at least till the mid-1980s.|$|R
