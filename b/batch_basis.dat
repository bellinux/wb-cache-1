50|$|Electric arc {{furnaces}} {{are also}} used for production of calcium carbide, ferroalloys and other non-ferrous alloys, and for production of phosphorus. Furnaces for these services are physically different from steel-making furnaces and may operate on a continuous, rather than <b>batch,</b> <b>basis.</b> Continuous process furnaces may also use paste-type, Søderberg electrodes to prevent interruptions due to electrode changes. Such a furnace {{is known as a}} submerged arc furnace because the electrode tips are buried in the slag/charge, and arcing occurs through the slag, between the matte and the electrode. A steelmaking arc furnace, by comparison, arcs in the open. The key is the electrical resistance, which is what generates the heat required: the resistance in a steelmaking furnace is the atmosphere, while in a submerged-arc furnace the slag or charge forms the resistance. The liquid metal formed in either furnace is too conductive to form an effective heat-generating resistance.|$|E

To assess the reversibility of copper uptake by spent bleaching earth, the kinetics of copper recovery from regenerated spent bleaching earth (RSBE) was studied on a <b>batch</b> <b>basis</b> in H SO, and CaCl. The acid showed superior 2 4 2 desorption efficiency than competitive effects of Ca ions. The initial solid-phase Cu concentration and 2 + desorption resident time were most important factors affecting copper release from RSBE.

40|$|Many estimation, prediction, and {{learning}} applications have a dynamic nature. One {{of the most}} important chal-lenges in machine learning is dealing with concept changes. Underlying changes may make the model designed on old data, inconsistent with new data. Also, algorithms usually specialize in one type of change. Other chal-lenge is reusing previously acquired information in scenarios where changes may recur. This strategy improves the learning accuracy and reduces the processing time. Unfortunately, most existing learning algorithms to deal with changes are adapted on a <b>batch</b> <b>basis.</b> This process usually requires a long time, and such data may not reflect {{the current state of the}} system. However, even if the system is adapted on a sample basis, existing algorithms may adapt slowly to changes and cannot conciliate old and new information. This paper proposes an On-line Weighted Ensemble (OWE) of regressor models which is able to learn incrementally sample by sample in the presence of several types of changes and simultaneously retain old information in recurring scenarios. The key idea is to keep a moving window that slides when a new sample is available. The error of each model on the current window is determined using a boosting strategy that assigns small errors to the models that predict accurately the samples predicted poorly by the ensemble. To handle recurring and non-recurring changes, OWE uses a new assignment of models ’ weights that takes into account the models ’ errors on the past and current windows using a discounting factor that decreases or increases the contribution of old windows. In addition, OWE launches new models if the system’s accuracy is decreasing, and it can exclude inaccurate models over time.

Interactions of arsenate ions with sulfate and chloride anions in aqueous solutions containing various amounts of activated alumina were studied in the laboratory on a <b>batch</b> mode <b>basis</b> with the goal of understanding the competition of the anions for adsorption sites on the activated alumina. The results of this study showed that the presence of 15 meq/L chloride anion depresses the ability of the arsenate to be adsorbed by F- 1 activated alumina initial liquid phase arsenate ion concentration of 5 mg/L at pH 6. Alternatively, 30 meq/L sulfate anion caused an increase in the arsenate ion adsorption. Additionally, the arsenate ion loading capacity of the activated alumina was lower with the presence of 15 meq/L chloride anion than with the presence of 30 meq/L sulfate anion. In tests with no added anions, arsenate ion loading capacity was only slightly lower than tests with 30 meq/L sulfate anion. It is also clearly shown that the ability of activated alumina to adsorb arsenate ion is affected by the presence of chloride and sulfate anions, but the effects are not noticeable when the initial arsenate concentration to activated alumina ratio is less than 25 mg arsenate anion to 1 g activated alumina.

40|$|On-line {{learning}} in environments and applications with time-varying behavior pose serious challenges. Changes may lead the learning model designed with old data, to become {{inconsistent with the}} new data, so that adaptation strategies are necessary. Unfortunately, most adaptation strategies are performed only on a <b>batch</b> <b>basis,</b> i. e. after accumulating certain number of samples. This process usually requires a long time, and thus such data may not reflect {{the current state of}} the system. However, even the learning system is adapted on a sample basis, most existing on-line learning algorithms adapt slowly to the abrupt changes. To overcome these drawbacks, a new dynamic and on-line ensemble regression (DOER) with fast adaptation capability for on-line prediction of variables given on a sample basis is proposed in this paper. DOER brings together desired properties which are not given by the previous works on on-line ensemble for regression: (1) on-line inclusion and removal of models to keep only the most accurate models with respect to {{the current state of the}} system; (2) dynamic adaptation of the models ’ weights based on their on-line predictions on the recent samples; and (3) on-line adaptation of the models ’ parameters. The accuracy of each model is obtained using a sliding window that is filled with the predictive errors of the most recent samples. Based on the model’s accuracies, weights are dynamically assigned, where accurate models are heavily weighted. When a new sample is available, all the models are retrained, and a new model may be included if the ensemble’s performance is not satisfactory. Inaccurate models can be removed for reducing the computational costs. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data sets are reported to evaluate the effectiveness of the DOER. Results show that DOER offers faster adaptation capability when compared to the state-of-the-art approaches...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1966 The {{degradation}} of kraft pulping wastes in estuarine waters {{was measured in}} terms of the following parameters: five-day 20 °C B. O. D., the Pearl-Benson Index, and toxicity to the bay mussel (Mytilus edulis L.). The waste tested was the total effluent from a combined pulp and paper mill producing 430 tons of kraft paper products per day. Samples of this waste were mixed with sea water to establish the desired test conditions. The degradation was evaluated at waste concentrations of three percent, seven percent, and ten percent by volume. These concentrations were tested in duplicate at salinity levels of 25 and 15 ppt. A constant amount of acclimated seed was used for all tests. The tests were conducted on a <b>batch</b> <b>basis</b> in large open plastic containers immersed in a constant temperature water bath. Stirring was provided to promote mixing and surface reaeration. Three 15 day test runs were conducted at 20 °C and two at 12 °C. The following conclusions were drawn {{based on the results of}} these experiments: 1. The {{degradation of}} kraft pulping wastes, as measured by the rate of change of five-day 20 °C B. O. D, follows first-order kinetics. 2. The degradation of kraft waste proceeds at a faster rate in more dilute concentrations. 3. The degradation rate of the five-day B. O. D. appears to be independent of salinity, and thus nutrient concentration, for a given waste level. The ratio of B. O. D. to salinity, however, has an apparent correlation with the degradation rate at 20 °C. 4. The toxicity of kraft waste, as measured by bioassays on the bay mussel, is biologically degradable. 5. There is no apparent correlation between the degradation of B. O. D., P. B. I., and toxicity...|$|E
40|$|Safeguarding the {{plutonium}} {{passing through a}} large-scale reprocessing plant (such as one with 800 t of uranium per year) involves nondestructive assay measurements for plutonium at key points. The gamma-ray and neutron signals from {{the plutonium}} are generally hidden by the much larger backgrounds from fission products and actinides, so indirect measurements are routinely used. The intense neutron emission rate from spent fuel is from curium. In a spent fuel assembly at the head-end of a plant, the curium neutrons are used to deduce the amount of plutonium present. Coincidence and multiplicity counting are alternative ways to measure neutrons from spent fuel; they have advantages over total neutron counting in certain conditions and offer new opportunities for examining assemblies. New uses for measurements of curium`s neutrons are proposed to safeguard waste streams. From a year`s work at a large-scale plant, 4 to 7 kg of plutonium can remain in leached hulls and 4 to 22 kg of plutonium can remain in the vitrified high-level liquid waste. While the plutonium in these wastes has the safeguards advantage of being dilute, {{it is important to}} verify (a) that the many kilograms involved are in fact present and (b) that the declared masses are not higher than the actual amounts so that more concentrated plutonium cannot pass through the plant by masquerading as waste. Curium measurements on spent fuel assemblies, the accountability tank, and leached hulls would form a safeguards system around all the inputs and outputs of a plant`s head-end where the plutonium is always intimately mixed with the curium. A neutron measurement of the vitrified waste would help identify the presence of a diversion path upstream because essentially all of the curium measured in the spent fuel assemblies should also be found in the vitrified waste (on a <b>batch</b> <b>basis).</b> 7 refs., 4 figs...|$|E
40|$|Traditionally {{pharmaceutical}} manufacture {{is conducted}} on a <b>batch</b> <b>basis</b> but significant resources are being invested into {{the use of}} intensified continuous processes. This dissertation evaluates {{the use of a}} combined twin screw and segmented fluid bed drying process to produce granules on a continuous basis. The experimental program was conducted using structured Design of Experiments in three stages. • Wet granulation only: Investigated the initial relationships between liquid/solid ratio and power required for wet granulation, as well as granule structure using SEM Imaging. • Wet granulation and fluid bed drying: Concluded that the biggest control over, the measured mean granule size (d 50) produced from the combined system was still the ratio of water to dry powder in the wet granulation. • Wet granulation through to compression: The effects of changes in the granulation process were not statically relevant on the final tablet for the process set up. The study also used PEPT data to assess motion within the TSG. The studies showed: • The time spent in the kneading zone directly after the liquid addition in relation to the overall time spent in the granulation process appears independent of the process j. set up at 32 % ± 2 %. • As the barrel speed of the granulator increases the relative time spent in the final ' breakage zone' of the TSG increases, therefore increasing breakage. Using the findings from the literature, the results of the experimental program were used to define the mechanisms occurring within the TSG. The experimental findings were input into a model to predict the outcome of collisions between particles. The model predicts agglomeration of the smaller particles to the larger ones and by calculating changes in the viscosity of the binder the subsequent secondary agglomeration of these granules can also be shown using this model The model is limited due to assumptions in deriving it. The model excludes capillary forces that if given sufficient time to form could have the same order of magnitude strength as other forces.

40|$|E-, P- and L-selectin {{belong to}} the C-type lectin family of cell {{adhesion}} molecules that initiate inflammatory response. Infammation per se is a physiologocal defense mechanism, but excessive leukcyte extravasation leads to numerous pathoIogical and disease states, as well as metastatic cancer spread. Leukocyte tethering and rolling toward inflammatory site start with the interaction of selectins and the carbohydrate epitope of their glycoprotein ligands, sialyl Lewisx. Therefore inhibitors of selectin-ligand interaction are of high pharmaceutical interest as potent anti-inflammatory agents. Tetrasaccharide sialyl Lewisx serves as a lead strucure in chemical and computational search for selectin antagonists. Structural NMR and X-ray studies indicated binding mode of sialyl Lewisx with E-, and P-selectin, but improved structural studies with {{the second and third}} generation antagonists is missing. We expressed recombinant human E-, P- and L-selectin/IgG as secreted proteins in mammalian expression system and purified them to homogniety. Acitivity of the proteins was confirmed with blocking monoclonal antibodies and ligand binding confirmed by NMR. Bioassays were developed in cell-free and cell-based formats with E-selectin/IgG to evaluate inhibitory potencies of in-house synthesized selectin antagonists. Due to variation and instabilities on day-to-day and batch-to-batch basis, assays were used only for preliminary antagonists screen. To enhance further structural studies, we developed a new system for the expression of truncated form of human E-selectin (lectin and EGF-like domains). Initialy we tried to express these two domains in E. coli, but refolding of expressed inclusion bodies was inefficient. Therefore lectin and EGF-like domains of human E-selectin were expressed as secreted form in baculovirus-infeced insect cells with a flag-epitope on its C-terminus. Expressed protein (LecEGFFlag) was monomeric in solution, correctly folded and active, as confirmed in the reaction with monoclonal blocking antibodies, and NMR studies. Protein was expressed in two distinct glycosylation forms, with apparent molecular weigts of 19. 96 kDa and 21. 15 kDa. In addition, we developed {{for the first time a}} cell-free assay with truncated form of Eselectin (aforementioned LecEGFFlag) for the evaluation of of E-selectin inhibitors. In a proof-of-concept manner, three different E-selectin antagonists were tested and obtained IC 50 values were in close agreement with published results. Reproducibility and stability of the assay on day-to-day and batch-to <b>batch</b> <b>basis</b> make it suitable not only for the preliminary screening, but also to quantify inhibitory potencies of E-selectin antagonists. Developed system is suitable for expression and similar characterization of P- and Lselectin as well...|$|E
40|$|Dosators (and other {{machines}} operating on generally similar principles) {{are widely used}} in the pharmaceutical industry for dosing products that are delivered to the customer in powder form (i. e. capsules and dry inhaled powder applications). However a significant problem for this technology {{is the ability to}} predict how accurately and reliably, new formulations can be dosed from these machines prior to scale-up for manufacture. Dosator filling machines have been on the market for over forty years, and their mechanisms have been refined over the time; in parallel with development work of formulation scientists. Despite the work that has progressed in both of these important fields, there has been only a limited improvement in the understanding of how the formulations behave when introduced into production line equipment. Typical problems include variation in potency and manufacturing dose weight – both being issues that can be difficult to predict and counter (especially where mainly the manufacturing process is undertaken on a <b>batch</b> <b>basis).</b> Many manufacturing problems {{can be traced back to}} an inadequate understanding of the bulk properties of the powders at the formulation stage. Common issues encountered during full scale production include extended commissioning; high levels of out of specification materials (specifically through dose weight variation). The project aims to provide a predictive tool to industry, the use of which can improve manufacturing efficiency, minimise costs and risk when launching new products. The approach proposed focuses on the development of an analytical model for the pick up and discharge of powder into and out of dosators, based upon established particle/powder characterisation techniques combined with an improved understanding of dosator machine factors, constitutive models and geometry of the machine. The model will be used to predict fill dose weights and filling/discharge behaviour of new products in dosator fillings systems; likewise, to investigate what changes in powder flow properties mean to dosator operation. Recommendations for the practical use of flow property measurement techniques in conjunction with the model are also outputs from this project. To simulate the process and (very importantly) validate the model, a dosator single shot testrig was engineered at The Wolfson Centre to measure forces acting on the dosator during the filling stage, the force required to eject the dose and the dose weight. In addition other important aids, such as a dosator demonstrator and an ultimate bearing application of soil mechanics, are key in the understanding of the process and estimate the stress distribution occurring in the stages of the operation. In addition, the development of this research provides a better understanding of the compaction phenomena in dosator operation, and more importantly, critical flow properties and machine settings factors compromising the uniformity of the fill dose weight in production lines using dosator filling machines not mentioned in the literature yet. Although this project has focussed on dosators, the general concept could be applicable to other volumetric powder filling systems...|$|E
