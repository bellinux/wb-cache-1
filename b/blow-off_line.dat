40|$|Turbo-compressors require {{protection}} against dangerous unstable operating conditions {{that might lead}} to considerable engine damage during practical operation. For this purpose, different forms of surge protection control systems are used in industrial systems. The objective of the present study is to optimize digital surge control systems so that maximum safety is ensured for the engine under all operating conditions with a minimum penalty to the useful performance map range resulting from the advance <b>blow-off</b> <b>line.</b> The surge protection strategies developed are designed and tested using the digital simulation of a real existing compressor system. As far as the development of this simulation is concerned, firstly one addresses the mathematical modelling of the most common components of compressor systems. Then the one-dimensional model modules obtained are used to model the compressor system under consideration. (orig.)
