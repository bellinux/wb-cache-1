2500|$|Cupola is a seven-window observatory, used to view Earth and docking spacecraft. Its name {{derives from}} the Italian word cupola, which means [...] "dome". The Cupola project was started by NASA and Boeing, but {{cancelled}} due to budget cuts. A <b>barter</b> <b>agreement</b> between NASA and ESA led to ESA resuming development of Cupola in 1998. It was built by Thales Alenia Space in Turin, Italy. The module comes equipped with robotic workstations for operating the station's main robotic arm and shutters to protect its windows from damage caused by micrometeorites. It features 7 windows, with an [...] round window, the largest window on the station (and the largest flown in space to date).

Today’s amount of software applications bringing together advanced mobile services and literature of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is quite remarkable and worth investigating. In our research, soft-ware agents of BarterCell can operate in wireless networks on behalf of nomadic users, cooperate to resolve complex tasks and negotiate to reach mutually beneficial <b>bartering</b> <b>agreements.</b> In this paper, we in-troduce BarterCell that is an agent-based service application for users of pocket computing devices. We introduce new negotiation algorithms dedicated to bartering services in specific. We examine our approach in a scenario wherein {{it is essential for}} a multi-agent system to establish a chain of mutually attracted agents seeking to fulfill different bartering desires. And, we demonstrate and analyze the obtained results. ...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 92 - 96). This thesis spotlights {{the travel}} and leisure magazine industry within South Africa. It {{contends that the}} travel writing genre is susceptible {{to a number of}} biases, both past and present, which ultimately affect the way its overall content is produced and presented to the public. This work was substantiated through a set of qualitative interviews with key professionals within the South African travel and leisure magazine industry, as well as through a theme- based content analysis of a number of local travel writing publications. This study adds to a rather extensive line of research written on the topic of travel writing regarding a number of older criticisms of bias including 'othering', escapism, and gendering. However, it also focuses on a number of more modem biases such as direct advertising, advertorial usage, as well as the acceptance of 'freebies' and <b>barter</b> <b>agreements,</b> none of which has been given much attention in previous research. The sheer existence of these and other biases within the modem South African travel and leisure magazine industry exhibits an absolute necessity of examination into such a topic, especially given the importance and overall influence that the travel writing industry has on a country's economic standing and overall image...|$|R
40|$|The author dwells on {{the causes}} of the {{growling}} importance of bilateral <b>barter</b> <b>agreements</b> in East-Wiest tirade. To the principle clauses in the development of barter trade belong: the economic recession in the capitalist countries the rampant inflation in the western world and last but mot least the depreciation of western currencies. The said factors reawakened interest in barter transactions. The bilateral barter arrangements, of course, have always been broadly practised in trade transactions between socialist countries and in trade relations of the latter with Third World countries. The paper contains a few examples of the numerous barter arrangements with western countries. The author next proceeds to describe and analyse the main types of barter deals, that is to say clearing, switch operations, compensatiom and buy back barter. Finally, tine author drawls attention to the fact, that barter arrangements are being not only commonly used in foreign trade but also — as the American practice shows it — in purely internal trade transactions. The big concerns are switching to barter in order to secure for themselves regular and big supplies of rare raw materials and semi-finished goods, thus depriving small and medium enterprises access to needed vital supplies.

50|$|Once new {{supplies}} of oil, rubber, and tungsten began {{flowing from the}} newly occupied Far East, mutually beneficial <b>barter</b> <b>agreements</b> were agreed whereby the Germans would acquire these vital commodities {{in exchange for the}} precision tools, blue prints and ball bearings which Japan badly needed. There had already been some trading of silk products early in the European war. Despite the 5600 mi and the land barrier of Russia separating Berlin from Tokyo, by mid-1942 a system of fast blockade runners was set up, the freighters traveling non-stop without showing lights or using their radio to avoid detection. The MEW believed that the first Japanese shipment of rubber reached Germany during the summer of 1942, having initially sailed from Indo-China to West Africa. From there it was transferred to small coastal vessels and ran the blockade to French Mediterranean ports by night. The MEW became concerned at the 'steady trickle' of Japanese blockade runners reaching Europe, which one estimate put at 15 ships by the end of 1942, and on the anniversary of the German and Italian declarations of war on the US, General Tojo expressed his pleasure that Japan was able to contribute the resources captured in the South Pacific to the Axis cause.|$|R

Four were built and were used by Airbus to carry aircraft parts between its factories. In the 1990s Airbus retired them due to rising operational costs and they have been replaced with Airbus Belugas. Three of the former Airbus Industrie Super Guppys remain in the U.K., Germany, and France, while the fourth aircraft was acquired by NASA as part of a <b>barter</b> <b>agreement</b> with ESA for its role as a partner with the International Space Station.|$|E

Harmony arrived on June 1, 2003 at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida after its flight in an Airbus Beluga oversize cargo vehicle. Following post transportation inspection, the Italian Space Agency formally handed over Harmony to the European Space Agency (ESA). From there, ESA formally transferred ownership of Harmony to NASA on June 18, 2003, {{taking place in the}} Space Station Processing Facility of the Kennedy Space Center. The handover of Harmony completed a major element of the <b>barter</b> <b>agreement,</b> between ESA and NASA, that was signed in Turin on October 8, 1997.|$|E
50|$|The {{initially}} 12.8 {{meters long}} Columbus Module - ESA's main {{contribution to the}} ISS - was for cost reasons gradually reduced to half - 6.4 meters. In addition a <b>barter</b> <b>agreement</b> with NASA maintained 51% of Columbus resources for ESA, the rest to be available for NASA use, under the utilisation agreement. The effect of these measures was that ESA could place four microgravity dedicated facilities in Columbus, the Microgravity Facilities for Columbus or MFC. The MFC programme was approved together with the Columbus Programme in September 1995, and provided a suite of Columbus research facilities, Biolab, Fluid Science Laboratory (FLS), Material Science Laboratory (MSL), together with the first batch of experiments.|$|E
5000|$|In February 1940 Karl Ritter, who had {{brokered}} huge pre-war <b>barter</b> <b>agreements</b> with Brazil, visited Moscow and, despite finding Stalin {{an incredibly}} fierce negotiator, an increased trade deal was eventually signed between Germany and Russia. It was valued at 640 million Reichmarks {{in addition to}} that previously agreed, for which Germany would supply heavy naval guns, thirty of her latest aircraft including the Messerschmitt 109, Messerschmitt 110 and Junkers 88, locomotives, turbines, generators, the unfinished cruiser [...] and the plans to the battleship [...] In return Russia supplied in the first year one million tons of cereal, ½ million tons of wheat, 900,000 tons of oil, 100,000 tons of cotton, ½ million tons of phosphates, one million tons of soya beans and other goods. Although the Germans had been able to find numerous ways of beating the blockade, shortages were now so severe that on 30 March 1940, when he was gearing up for his renewed Blitzkrieg in the west, Hitler ordered that delivery of goods in payment to Russia should take priority even over those to his own armed forces. After the fall of France Hitler, intending to invade Russia the following year, declared that the trade need continue only until the spring of 1941, after which the Nazis intended to take all they needed.|$|R
50|$|More than {{ninety percent}} of {{electricity}} produced is hydroelectric and the country could produce much more of such clean energy and export to its neighbors and the region. Even though Kyrgyzstan has abundant hydro resources, only less than ten percent of its potential has been developed so far. It has limited deposits of fossil fuels and most of natural gas imports come from Uzbekistan, with which Kyrgyzstan has {{had a series of}} imperfect <b>barter</b> <b>agreements.</b> Per capita energy consumption is high considering average income, and the government has no comprehensive plan to reduce demand. Up to 45 percent of electricity generated, especially in winter time, is diverted illegally or leaks from the distribution system. Hydroelectric plants generate some 92.5 percent of domestically consumed electricity, and three commercial thermoelectric plants are in operation. Because of its rich supply of hydroelectric power, Kyrgyzstan sends electricity to Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan before in return for fossil fuels. A new hydroelectric plant on the Naryn River at Kambar-Ata would supply power to parts of China and Russia, improving Kyrgyzstan’s export situation and domestic energy supply. The plant was completed in August 30, 2010. An antiquated infrastructure and poor management make Kyrgyzstan more dependent on foreign energy in winter when water levels are low. In the early 2000s, Kyrgyzstan was exploiting only an estimated 10 percent of its hydroelectric power potential. In 2001 Kyrgyzstan had about 70,000 kilometers of power transmission lines served by about 500 substations. Kyrgyzstan would {{be a member of the}} Shanghai Cooperation Organization’s Asian Energy Club, which Russia proposed in 2006 to unify oil, gas, and electricity producers, consumers, and transit countries in the Central Asian region in a bloc that is self-sufficient in energy.

5000|$|Officially, {{the last}} words of King Aleksandar had been [...] "Save Yugoslavia, and the {{friendship}} with France". His successors {{were well aware of}} the need to try and do the first, but the second, maintaining close ties with France, was increasingly difficult. There were several reasons for this. By the mid-1930s, France, internally divided, was increasingly unable {{to play an important role}} in Eastern Europe and support its allies, many of whom had suffered badly from the economic crisis of that period. By contrast, Germany was increasingly willing to get into <b>barter</b> <b>agreements</b> with the countries of south east Europe. In the process those countries felt it was against their interests to closely follow France. An additional motive to improve relations with Italy and Germany was the fact that Italy supported the Ustase movement. As Maček intimated Italy would support Croatian secession from Yugoslavia, First Regent Prince Paul judged closer relations with Italy were inevitable. In an effort to rob the HSS from potential Italian support, a treaty of friendship was signed between the two countries in 1937. This in fact diminished the Ustasa threat somewhat since Mussolini jailed some of their leaders and temporarily withdrew financial support. In 1938, Germany, annexing Austria, became a neighbour of Yugoslavia. The feeble reaction of France and Britain, later that year, during the Sudeten Crisis convinced Belgrade that a European war was inevitable and that it would be unwise to support France and Britain. Instead, Yugoslavia tried to stay aloof, this in spite of Paul's personal sympathies for Britain and Serbia's establishment's predilections for France. In the meantime, Germany and Italy tried to exploit Yugoslavia's domestic problems, and so did Maček. In the end, the regency agreed to the formation of the Banovina hrvatska in August 1939. This did not put an end to the pressures from Germany and Italy, while Yugoslavia's strategic position deteriorated by the day. It was increasingly dependent on the German market (about 90% of its exports went to Germany), while in April 1939 Italy invaded and annexed Albania. In October 1940 it attacked Greece. by that time, France had already been eliminated from the scene, leaving Britain as Yugoslavia's only potential ally - given that Belgrade had not recognized the Soviet Union. London however wanted to involve Yugoslavia in the war, which it rejected.|$|R

5000|$|In addition, with German help, China {{would have}} to build up its own defence {{industry}} because it could not rely on buying arms from abroad much longer. The first step toward efficient industrialisation was the centralisation of both the Chinese and German reconstruction agencies. In January 1934, the Handelsgesellschaft für industrielle Produkte, or Hapro, was created to unify all German industrial interests in China. Hapro was nominally a private company to avoid oppositions from other foreign countries. In August 1934, [...] "Treaty for the Exchange of Chinese Raw Materials and Agricultural Products of German Industrial and Other Products" [...] was signed in which China would send strategically important raw material in exchange for German industrial products and development. This <b>barter</b> <b>agreement</b> was beneficial to Sino-German cooperation since China was unable to secure external monetary loans due to high budget deficit from military expenditure. This agreement allowed Germany to become independent of the international raw material market. The agreement specified that China and Germany were equal partners.

Many foreign governments closed their markets to Mexican oil, hoping that PEMEX would drown in its own oil.
