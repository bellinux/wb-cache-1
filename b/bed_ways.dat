50|$|The Child Poverty Monitor is a {{partnership}} between the New Zealand Childrens Commissioner, the JR McKenzie Trust and the University of Otago who measures and reports on New Zealand child poverty annually. According to them, 265,000 kids live in poverty in New Zealand. 17% of New Zealand kids live in material hardship (where at least six out of sixteen predefined items and services like fresh fruit and vegetables, meat, a good <b>bed,</b> <b>ways</b> to keep warm, electricity bills etc. are not affordable) while 3 out of 5 kids already living in poverty have lived like that (with their income under the poverty line) for seven years or more.|$|E

Jerry Muskrat had felt the spring fever in his bones and had gone up and down the Laughing Brook, poking into all kinds of places just for the fun of seeing new things. Little Joe Otter had been more full of fun than ever, if that were possible. Mr. and Mrs. Redwing had come back to the bulrushes from their winter home way down in the warm Southland. Everybody was happy, just as happy as could be.|$|R

The grain size that is normally held in the suspended load ranges from very fine to fine; clays and silts.|$|R

It must be considered how this historical, cultural and political process and periods have affected the way of talking, the words of their language, now mixed with the Spanish, and the new ways of life after the assimilation was underway.|$|R

25|$|There were {{delays and}} cost overruns {{in the tunnel}} {{construction}}. The plan was to open it in 1993, giving the trains a head start of three years over road traffic, but train traffic started in 1997 and road traffic in 1998. During construction the sea <b>bed</b> gave <b>way</b> {{and one of the}} tunnels was flooded. The water continued to rise and reached the end at Sprogø, where it continued into the (still dry) other tunnel. The water damaged two of the four tunnel boring machines, but no workers were injured. Only by placing a clay blanket on the sea bed was it possible to dry out the tunnels. The two damaged machines were repaired and the majority of the tunnelling was undertaken from the Sprogø side. The machines on the Zealand side tunnelled through difficult ground and made little progress. A major fire on one of the Zealand machines in June 1994 stopped these drives and the tunnels were completed by the two Sprogø machines.|$|R

Osorio integrated performance and dance into his work as a way to more clearly portray the Latino body. In his piece La Cama there was an implied but physically absent body.|$|R
6000|$|... § 22. Detailed {{accounts}} of the Rossberg Fall {{may be found in}} any ordinary Swiss Guide; the only points we have to notice respecting it are, that the mountain was composed of an indurated gravel, disposed in oblique beds sloping towards the valley. A portion of one of these <b>beds</b> gave <b>way,</b> and half filled the valley beneath, burying five villages, together with the principal one of Goldau, and partially choking up a little lake, the streamlets which supplied it now forming irregular pools among the fallen fragments. I call the rock, and accurately, indurated gravel; but the induration is so complete that the mass breaks through the rolled pebbles chiefly composing it, and may be considered as a true rock, only always in its blocks rugged and formless when compared with the crystalline formations. Turner has chosen his position on some of the higher heaps of ruin, looking down towards the Lake of Zug, which is seen under the sunset, the spire of the tower of Aart on its shore just relieved against the light of the waves.|$|R
50|$|In {{the craft}} of woodturning, a banjo is a common term for a fixture on the wood lathe, mounted on the lathe's bed, for holding the toolrest.

The chosen position of the fixture can be locked in place on the lathe's <b>bed</b> in various <b>ways,</b> the most common method being a lever at the forward end of the fixture which acts upon an eccentric shaft with an attached clamp to secure the fixture to the lathe's bed.|$|R

Clothes are unwholesome superfluities not contemplated in the system of Nature. When we are exhausted, there is no such thing as true repose for us until we are freed from our dress. Men subjected to any excessive exertion--fighting, rowing, walking, working--must strip their bodies as completely as possible, or they are nor equal to the call on them. Ovid's knowledge of his own temperament told him that sleep was not to be hoped for, that night. But the <b>way</b> to <b>bed</b> was the <b>way</b> to rest notwithstanding, by getting rid of his clothes.|$|R

Part I presents observations on the coupling between subglacial channel flow and groundwater flow in determining subglacial hydraulic regime and creating eskers from an Icelandic glacier that is suggested as an analogue for many parts of Pleistocene ice sheets. Part II develops a theory of perennial subglacial stream flow and the origin of esker systems, and models the evolution of the subglacial stream system and associated groundwater flow in a glacier of the type described in Part I. It is suggested that groundwater flow may be the predominant mechanism whereby meltwater at the glacier <b>bed</b> finds its <b>way</b> to the major subglacial streams that discharge water to glacier margins...|$|R

60|$|The {{outer edge}} of the reef on the western or leeward side of the island is tolerably well defined, and is a little higher than any other part. It chiefly {{consists}} of large strongly branched corals, of the genus Madrepora, which also form a sloping <b>bed</b> some <b>way</b> out to sea: the kinds of coral growing in this part will be described in the ensuing chapter. Between the outer margin and the beach, there is a flat space with a sandy bottom and a few tufts of living coral; in some parts it is so shallow, that people, by avoiding the deeper holes and gullies, can wade across it at low water; in other parts it is deeper, seldom however exceeding ten or twelve feet, so that it offers a safe coasting channel for boats. On the eastern and windward side of the island, which is exposed to a heavy surf, the reef was described to me as having a hard smooth surface, very slightly inclined inwards, just covered at low-water, and traversed by gullies; it appears to be quite similar in structure to the reefs of the barrier and atoll classes.|$|R
40|$|Incineration, {{in spite}} of being a costly option, is widely used for the {{treatment}} and disposal of solid, liquid, and gaseous wastes. Use of fluidized <b>beds</b> paved the <b>way</b> for less polluting incinerators. Circulating fluidized bed systems can burn low-heat-content watery wastes without (or with minimum) auxiliary fuel. Equations of hunt transfer and heat balance for different zones of a recirculating fluidized bed (RCFB) incineration system are presented along with a computational procedure to predict the performance details of the system. The method presented is applied to compute the performance of an RCFB incineration system burning distillery spent wash. Results show that RCFB incinerators are capable of burning a spent wash of solids content considerably lower than 60 %. The incineration units in operation at present concentrate spent wash to about 60 % solids content in external evaporators for autogenous burning. This costly and difficult operation can be minimized {{by the use of}} RCFB for incineration...|$|R
