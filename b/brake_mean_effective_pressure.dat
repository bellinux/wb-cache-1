40|$|Small, {{high power}} density {{turbocharged}} engines coupled to {{kinetic energy recovery}} systems {{are one of the}} key areas of development for both passenger and racing cars. In passenger cars, the KERS may reduce the amount of thermal energy needed to reaccelerate the car following a deceleration recovering part of the braking energy. This translates in a first, significant fuel energy saving. Also considering the KERS torque boost increasing the total torque available to accelerate the car, large engines working at very low <b>brake</b> <b>mean</b> <b>effective</b> <b>pressures</b> and efficiencies over driving cycles may also be replaced by small higher power density engines working at much higher <b>brake</b> <b>mean</b> <b>effective</b> <b>pressures</b> and therefore much higher part load efficiencies.

The actual fuel saving is therefore only the one of the smaller thermal engine having less thermal power.

The test fuels were denoted as ULSD (ultra low sulfur diesel), BD 20 (20 % canola oil blended with 80 % ULSD by volume), and PCO (pure canola oil), respectively. These three fuels were tested under an engine speed of 1500 rpm with various <b>brake</b> <b>mean</b> <b>effective</b> <b>pressures</b> (BMEPs).

In addition, at low engine loads (0. 13 MPa and 0. 26 MPa), the combustion pressure of PCO is the smallest, compared with BD 20 and ULSD, because the lower calorific value of PCO is lower than that of ULSD. However, at high engine loads (0. 39 MPa and 0. 52 MPa), the rate of heat release (ROHR) of BD 20 is the highest because the canola oil biodiesel is an oxygenated fuel that promotes combustion, shortening the ignition delay period. For exhaust emissions, by using canola oil biodiesel, the particulate matter (PM) and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions were considerably reduced with increased BMEP.

The model of a 6 -cylinder turbocharged engine (Holset HDX 55 V) was calibrated using an experimental BSFC map to predict engine exhaust thermodynamic conditions such as exhaust mass flow rate and exhaust temperature under various operating conditions. These engine exhaust conditions were then utilized to feed the inlet conditions for both the ORC and turbocompounding models, evaluating the available exhaust energy to be recovered by each technology. Firstly the ORC system model was simulated to obtain the power that can be generated from the system. Having this additional power converted to useful work, the BSFC was observed to reduce around 2 – 5 % depending upon engine’s speed and BMEP. The initial model of the engine was then modified by considering a second turbine representing turbocompounding heat recovery system. The BSFC was increased due to the back-pressure from the second turbine, but the energy generated from the turbine was sufficient to reduce the BSFC further. However, by application of turbocompounding no improvement in BSFC was achieved at low engine’s speeds. It is concluded that ORC heat recovery system produces a satisfactory results at low engine speeds with both low and high loads whereas at medium and high engine speeds turbocompounding heat recovery system causes higher BSFC reduction...|$|R

The objective of this project is to investigate and analysis the performance of two-stroke engine using a 1 -Dimensional (engine gas dynamic) software. From this objective, the outcome of the project can be determined by using the 1 -Dimensional software. The outcomes that need to be determined from this project are the performances of the engine.

50|$|Much of the time, {{automobile}} engines {{operate at}} {{only a fraction}} of their maximal efficiency, resulting in lower fuel efficiency (or what is the same thing, higher specific fuel consumption (SFC)). Charts that show the SFC for every feasible combination of torque (or <b>Brake</b> <b>Mean</b> <b>Effective</b> <b>Pressure)</b> and RPM are called Brake specific fuel consumption maps. Using such a map, one can find the efficiency of the engine at various combinations of rpm, torque, etc. During the pulse (acceleration) phase of pulse and glide, the efficiency is near maximal due to the high torque and much of this energy is stored as kinetic energy of the moving vehicle. This efficiently-obtained kinetic energy is then used in the glide phase to overcome rolling resistance and aerodynamic drag. In other words, going between periods of very efficient acceleration and gliding gives an overall efficiency that is usually significantly higher than just cruising at a constant speed. Computer calculations have predicted that in rare cases (at low speeds where the torque required for cruising at steady speed is low) it's possible to double (or even triple) fuel economy. More realistic simulations that account for other traffic suggest improvements of 20% are more likely. In other words, in the real world one is unlikely to see fuel efficiency double or triple. Such a failure is due to signals, stop signs, and considerations for other traffic; all of these factors interfering with the pulse and glide technique. But improvements in fuel economy of 20% or so are still feasible.|$|E

40|$|AbstractCombustion {{control is}} {{assuming}} {{a crucial role}} in reducing engine tailpipe emissions while maximizing performance. The effort in the calibration of control parameters affecting the combustion development can be very demanding. One of the most effective factors influencing performance and efficiency is the combustion phasing: in Spark Ignition (SI) engines it is affected by factors such as Spark Advance (SA), Air-Fuel Ratio (AFR), Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR), Variable Valve Timing (VVT). SA optimal values are usually determined by means of calibration procedures carried out in steady state conditions on the test bench by changing SA values while monitoring performance indicators, such as <b>Brake</b> and Indicated <b>Mean</b> <b>Effective</b> <b>Pressure</b> (BMEP, IMEP), <b>Brake</b> Specific Fuel Consumption (BSFC) and pollutant emissions. The effect of SA on combustion is stochastic, due to the cycle-to-cycle variation: the analysis of mean values requires many engine cycles to be significant of the performance obtained with the given control setting. Moreover, often the effect of SA on engine performance must be investigated for different settings of other control parameters (EGR, VVT, AFR). The calibration process is time consuming involving exhaustive tests followed by off-line data analysis. This paper presents the application of a dynamic calibration methodology, with the objective of reducing the calibration duration. The proposed approach is based on transient tests, coupled with a statistical investigation, allowing reliable performance analysis even with a low number of engine cycles.

30|$|The {{effect of}} varying {{compression}} ratio and other parameters such as injection timing, engine load, and fuel {{on the performance}} of diesel engine was recently studied experimentally [17, 18, 19, 20]. Raheman and Ghadge [17] studied the performance of a Ricardo EG engine using biofuel and its blend with high-speed diesel fuel at varying compression ratio, injection timing, and engine load. They concluded that the performance of the engine reduced with the increase in the percentage of biofuel in the blend above 20 % compared to that of conventional engine. This reduction in engine performance can be overcome by increasing the compression ratio and injection timing. Jindal et al. [18] investigated the effect of compression ratio and injection pressure {{on the performance of}} DI diesel engine running on Jatropha methyl ester. They demonstrated that an increase in compression ratio associated with an increase in injection pressure improves the performance of the engine in terms of brake-specific fuel consumption, brake thermal efficiency, and emissions (i.e., hydrocarbon, NOx, and smoke opacity). They concluded that for fuelling the engine with bio-diesel, one should go for higher compression ratio associated with higher injection pressure. Muralidharan et al. [19] estimated the performance, emission, and combustion characteristics of a single-cylinder, four-stroke, VCR, multi-fuel engine fuelled with waste cooking oil methyl ester and its blends with standard diesel. The performance parameters include brake thermal efficiency, brake-specific fuel consumption, <b>brake</b> power, indicated <b>mean</b> <b>effective</b> <b>pressure,</b> mechanical efficiency, and exhaust gas temperature. They compared and analyzed their results with standard diesel, and a considerable improvement in the performance parameters as well as exhaust emissions was observed especially at full load. Gandure and Ketlogetswe [20] carried out their work to compare the performance of variable compression engine fuelled with native marula seed oil and petrodiesel fuels. The results indicated that engine performance when powered with marula oil as fuel was very close to that when powered with petrodiesel and at an 80 % load, the compression ratio of 16 : 1 yields optimum performance in terms of engine torque and brake power for both petrodiesel and marula oil fuels.|$|R

Of particular importance is the high flash point which makes it a suitable fuel for military applications and use in underground mines...|$|E
