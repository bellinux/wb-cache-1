25|$|When attacked, slugs can {{contract}} their body, making themselves {{harder and}} more compact and more still and round. By doing this, they become firmly {{attached to the}} substrate. This, combined with the slippery mucus they produce, makes slugs more difficult for predators to grasp. The unpleasant taste of the mucus is also a deterrent. Some species present different response behaviors when attacked, such as the Kerry slug. In contrast to the general <b>behavioral</b> <b>pattern,</b> the Kerry slug retracts its head, lets go of the substrate, rolls up completely, and stays contracted in a ball-like shape. This is a unique feature among all the Arionidae, and among most other slugs. Some slugs can self-amputate (autotomy) {{a portion of their}} tail to help the slug escape from a predator. Some slug species hibernate underground during the winter in temperate climates, but in other species, the adults die in the autumn.|$|E

40|$|Studies {{in culture}} are {{becoming}} more and more popular among economists. In this paper, culture is mainly considered in the framework of Original (Old) Institutional Economics. Basically, actors comprehend culture through <b>behavioral</b> <b>patterns</b> that are available to them. Social values correlate behaviors within and among various <b>behavioral</b> <b>patterns</b> in different cultural contexts. That is why culture is regarded as a bunch of social values, institutions and <b>behavioral</b> <b>patterns</b> associated with specific historical features of social evolution. The identification of <b>behavioral</b> <b>patterns</b> implies analyzing historical facts, actors’ discourses and narratives. That enables us to reflect on how well we understand manifold social values and specific cultural features. We may face difficulties comparing <b>behavioral</b> <b>patterns</b> embedded in different cultures. These difficulties lie in interpreting and understanding dominant institutions and values. Examining various available <b>behavioral</b> <b>patterns</b> does not enable us to develop a reliable deductive model that can be used for making predictions, because such a model fails to take into account the time and cultural contexts. While analyzing real economic processes, we have to take into consideration the fact that complex adaptive systems are constantly evolving. In the process of social and economic exchanges, actors choose relevant <b>behavioral</b> <b>patterns</b> simultaneously analyzing other individuals’ reaction. The regularity of social interactions entails that involved actors gain experience. In complex adaptive systems, actors use inductive reasoning to comprehend their experience in the context of culture and prescribed social values...|$|R

2500|$|Sexual narcissism {{has been}} {{described}} as an egocentric pattern of sexual behavior that involves an inflated sense of sexual ability and sexual entitlement. [...] In addition, sexual narcissism is the erotic preoccupation with oneself as a superb lover through a desire to merge sexually with a mirror image of oneself. [...] Sexual narcissism is an intimacy dysfunction in which sexual exploits are pursued, generally in the form of extramarital affairs, to overcompensate for low self-esteem and an inability to experience true intimacy. This <b>behavioral</b> <b>pattern</b> is believed to be more common in men than in women and has been tied to domestic violence in men and sexual coercion in couples. Hurlbert argues that sex is a natural biological given and therefore cannot be deemed as an addiction. [...] He and his colleagues assert that any sexual addiction {{is nothing more than a}} misnomer for what is actually sexual narcissism or sexual compulsivity. While Hurlbert writes mainly of sexual narcissism in men, Schoenewolf (2013) describes what he calls [...] "gender narcissism" [...] which occurs in both males and females who compensate for feelings of sexual inadequacy by becoming overly proud and obsessed with their masculinity or femininity.|$|E

40|$|Besides {{providing}} functional support, socially assistive robots {{can provide}} social {{support in the}} form of entertainment. Previous studies have shown that this type of social support improves elderly people’s well-being significantly. But it is still far from clear what underlying causes drive people’s judgment of entertainment value. Showing emotionally expressive behaviors seems to raise entertainment value, but what if these behaviors are not truly embodied, i. e., tied to processes in the environment? It would seem that it is important that expressive behaviors are tied to the proper events. In this study, we investigated whether multimodal <b>behavioral</b> <b>patterns</b> (i. e., combinations of gestures, eye LED patterns, and verbal expressions) based on the developments within a game aids the entertainment value. We chose a gaming situation where the robot plays Mastermind with a human, in which the robot could show no <b>behavioral</b> <b>patterns,</b> <b>behavioral</b> <b>patterns</b> tied to game progress, or randomly selected <b>behavioral</b> <b>patterns</b> from the same set. The <b>behavioral</b> <b>patterns</b> were designed to imitate four basic emotions (neutral, happy, angry, sad) in combination with five levels of surprise and five levels of confidence.

40|$|Abstract — In general, it is {{possible}} to find certain <b>behavioral</b> <b>patterns</b> in human daily activity. Such patterns are called as daily <b>behavioral</b> <b>patterns.</b> The purpose of this research is to learn and recognize <b>behavioral</b> <b>patterns.</b> In the previous methods, it is difficult to recognize in detail how a person acts in a room because the methods recognize only a sequence of existing position of human by using the information of infrared sensors or of switching on/off of electrical appliances. On the other hand, many have proposed the methods recognizing human motions from sequential images, in most of which motion models must be prepared in advance. In this paper, we propose a method for learning and recognizing motions of human without any motion models. In addition, we also propose perceptive methods of recognizing <b>behavioral</b> <b>patterns</b> by taking not only the sequence of position but also the sequence of motion into consideration. Experiments show that our approach is able to learn and recognize human behavior and confirm effectiveness of our method. I...|$|R
40|$|The {{national}} health insurance system in Australia records details on medical services and claims provided to its population. An effective method {{to the discovery of}} temporal <b>behavioral</b> <b>patterns</b> in the data set is proposed in this paper. The method consists of a two step approach which is applied recursively to the data set. First, a clustering algorithm is used to segment the data into classes. Then, hidden Markov models are employed to find the underlying temporal <b>behavioral</b> <b>patterns.</b> These steps are applied recursively to features extracted from the dataset until convergence. The main objective is to minimize the misclassification of patient profiles into various classes. This results in a hierarchical tree model consisting of a number of classes; each class groups similar patient temporal <b>behavioral</b> <b>patterns</b> together. The capabilities of the proposed method are demonstrated through the application to a subset of the Australian {{national health}} insurance data set. It is shown that the proposed method not only clusters data into various categories of interest, but it also automatically marks the periods in which similar temporal <b>behavioral</b> <b>patterns</b> occurred...|$|R
