5|$|Despite the {{violence}} of the suppression, the government and local lords were relatively circumspect in restoring order after the revolt, and continued to <b>be</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> fresh revolts for several decades. Few lords took revenge on their peasants except through the legal processes of the courts. Low-level unrest continued for several more years. In September 1382 there was trouble in Norfolk, involving an apparent plot against the Bishop of Norwich, and in March the following year there was an investigation into a plot to kill the sheriff of Devon. When negotiating rents with their landlords, peasants alluded to the memory of the revolt and the threat of violence.|$|E
5|$|Accompanied by Brady, Hindley {{approached}} 12-year-old John Kilbride in {{the early}} evening of 23 November 1963, at a market in Ashton-under-Lyne and offered him a lift home on the pretext that his parents would <b>be</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> him being out so late. With the added inducement of a bottle of sherry, Kilbride readily agreed to get into the Ford Anglia car that Hindley had hired. Brady told Kilbride that the sherry was at their home, and they would have to make a detour to collect it. On the way he suggested that they take another detour, to search for a glove he said that Hindley had lost on the moor. When they reached the moor Brady took the child with him while Hindley waited in the car. Brady sexually assaulted Kilbride and attempted to slit his throat with a six-inch serrated blade before fatally strangling him with a piece of string, possibly a shoelace.|$|E

We feel that Phil's decline will highlight the destructive nature of drugs, and rather than encourage drug use, will act as a deterrent." [...] A former cocaine addict, Sarah Graham, agreed with the BBC, saying [...] "I think it's really important that a mainstream character like Phil Mitchell is doing this storyline. [...] I'm not surprised {{that there have been}} so many complaints about seeing this on one of our favourite soaps. The episode showed the brutal reality of addiction.

2500|$|Memoirs Illustrating the History of Jacobinism {{has also}} {{been seen as a}} primary source {{that can be used to}} examine freemasonry in Europe. Even though Freemasonry became a target in the {{paranoid}} literature that blamed the revolution partly on the activities of Masons, the work still had some historical value in regards to the group. Margaret Jacob argues that Barruels writings [...] "offer a point of departure for understanding the relationship between the Continental Enlightenment, as it was lived in the clubs, societies, and lodges of the eighteenth century, and the outbreak of the democratic revolutions in the late 1780s in Amsterdam, Brussels, and most important, Paris." [...] She believes that if readers can look past the paranoia within the text, it can provide information about how Freemasons were treated during the revolution. Jacob also sees value in the text because Barruel argued for a distinction between English Freemasonry and its Continental counterpart. Barruel believed that his allegations against the Continental Freemasons did not apply to the respectable English Freemasons. The activities of the English Freemasons were not the things that needed to <b>be</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about.</b> He distinguishes between the circumstances of the French and the English and shows that the language used in each situation was important. He believes that the Masonic language about equality, liberty, and fraternity bears relation to the radical and democratic phase of the French Revolution and to Jacobin language. From the book, Margaret Jacob salvages the realization that language is important and that it can have a social force all of its own.|$|E

2500|$|Earl Scruggs did not invent three-finger banjo playing; in fact, he {{said the}} three-finger style {{was the most common}} way to play the five-string banjo in his {{hometown}} in western North Carolina. An early influence was a local banjoist, DeWitt [...] "Snuffy" [...] Jenkins, who plucked in a finger style. According to banjoist and historian Tony Trischka, [...] "Jenkins came about as close as one could to Scruggs style without actually playing it". At age ten, when Scruggs first learned the technique, he recalled that he was at home in his room after a quarrel with his brother. He was idly playing a song called [...] "Reuben" [...] and suddenly realized that he was playing with three fingers, not two. [...] "That excited me to no end", he later recalled, and said he ran through the house repeatedly yelling [...] "I've got it". From there he devoted all his free time to perfecting his timing and to adding syncopation and variations to it. Controversy exists as to the actual origin of three-finger picking style. Don Reno, an eminent banjo player who also played this style and who knew Scruggs at that young age, described Scruggs' early playing as similar to that of Snuffy Jenkins. Scruggs, however, consistently referred to it as his own, saying that he adapted to it [...] "a syncopated roll that was quite different." [...] On the subject, John Hartford said, [...] "Here's the way I feel about it. Everybody's all worried about who invented the style and it's obvious that three finger banjo pickers have been around a long time— maybe since 1840. But it's my feeling that if it wasn't for Earl Scruggs, you wouldn't <b>be</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> who invented it." ...|$|E
