25|$|Microsoft Word {{supports}} bullet {{lists and}} numbered lists. It {{also features a}} numbering system that helps add correct numbers to pages, chapters, headers, footnotes, and entries of tables of content; these numbers automatically change to correct ones as new items are added or existing items are deleted. <b>Bullets</b> <b>and</b> <b>numbering</b> can be applied directly to paragraphs and convert them to lists. Word 97 through 2003, however, had problems adding correct numbers to numbered lists. In particular, a second irrelevant numbered list might have not started with number one, but instead resumed numbering after the last numbered list. Although Word 97 supported a hidden marker that said the list numbering must restart afterwards, the command to insert this marker (Restart Numbering command) was only added in Word 2003. However, if one cut the first item of the listed and pasted it as another item, e.g. fifth, the restart marker would have moved with it and the list would have restarted in the middle instead of at the top.|$|E

50|$|According to Dr. Martin Fackler and the International Wound Ballistics Association (IWBA), between 12.5 and 14 inches (318 and 356 mm) of {{penetration}} in calibrated tissue simulant is optimal {{performance for}} a bullet which {{is meant to}} be used defensively, against a human adversary. They also believe that penetration {{is one of the most}} important factors when choosing a <b>bullet</b> (<b>and</b> that the <b>number</b> one factor is shot placement). If the bullet penetrates less than their guidelines, it is inadequate, and if it penetrates more, it is still satisfactory though not optimal. The FBI's penetration requirement is very similar at 12 to 18 inches (305 to 457 mm).|$|R

5000|$|In a {{comparison}} between Dropbox Paper and Evernote, PC Worlds Michael Ansaldo wrote that [...] "With its emphasis on document creation, you might expect formatting to be front and center in Dropbox Paper. Thats not the case." [...] Ansaldo noted {{the lack of a}} [...] "fixed formatting toolbar as youd find in Evernote or a word processor like Google Docs or Microsoft Word. Instead, the text editor appears as a floating ribbon only when you highlight selected text." [...] The only formatting options available for emphasis were bolding, strikethrough, <b>bulleted</b> <b>and</b> <b>numbered</b> lists, <b>and</b> H1 and H2 tags. Users can also add links, convert text to checklists, and add comments. Ansaldo wrote that [...] "Both Evernote and Dropbox Paper make it easy to add images to a document", but also noted that [...] "Dropbox Paper doesnt support any image editing". Paper supports rich media, and users can [...] "add rich content to your document just by pasting a link to the file. In addition to Dropbox, Paper supports media from a variety of popular services including YouTube, Spotify, Vimeo, SoundCloud, Facebook, and Googles productivity suite. Once the file appears, you can delete the link for a cleaner display." [...] To start working with other people, Paper [...] "allows you to invite people via email from within a document", with sharing options for who can view the link (anyone with the link or just the invited person), and action permissions (edit or only comment). Regarding collaboration, Ansaldo wrote that [...] "Creative collaboration is Paper’s marquee feature, and it provides a variety of ways to work effectively with others in real time". Users can [...] "make any content immediately visible and accessible to a specific collaborator with [...] "@mentions"", and [...] "You can also use @mentions to create and assign task lists within a document." [...] Paper also [...] "boasts essential collaboration tools including comments, editing attribution, and revision history." ...|$|R
