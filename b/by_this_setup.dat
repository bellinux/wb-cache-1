When the distance of the transceiver is large, how to improve the system performance becomes an important problem to be solved. As we know, if the PD inclines its orientation toward the LED, the received SNR will be enhanced observably. Therefore, to obtain better system performance, the optimal tilting angle of the PD should also be investigated.|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} particle transport {{under the}} influence of time-varying driving forces, where fluctuation relations connect the statistics of pairs of time reversed evolutions of physical observables. In many "mesoscopic" transport processes, the effective many-particle dynamics is dominantly classical, while the microscopic rates governing particle motion are of quantum-mechanical origin. We here employ the stochastic path integral approach as an optimal tool to probe the fluctuation statistics in such applications. Describing the classical limit of the Keldysh quantum nonequilibrium field theory, the stochastic path integral encapsulates the quantum origin of microscopic particle exchange rates. Dynamically, it is equivalent to a transport master equation which is a formalism general enough to describe many applications of practical interest. We apply the stochastic path integral to derive general functional fluctuation relations for current flow induced by time-varying forces. We show that the successive measurement processes implied <b>by</b> <b>this</b> <b>setup</b> do not put the derivation of quantum fluctuation relations in jeopardy. While in many cases the fluctuation relation for a full time-dependent current profile may contain excessive information, we formulate a number of reduced relations, and demonstrate their application to mesoscopic transport.

40|$|In {{order to}} assess to what extent {{regional}} climate models (RCMs) yield better representations of climatic states than general circulation models (GCMs), the output of each is usually directly compared with observations. RCM output is often bias corrected, {{and in some cases}} correction methods can also be applied to GCMs. This leads {{to the question of whether}} bias-corrected RCMs perform better than bias-corrected GCMs. Here the first results from such a comparison are presented, followed by discussion of the value added <b>by</b> RCMs in <b>this</b> <b>setup.</b> Stochastic postprocessing, based on Model Output Statistics (MOS), is used to estimate daily precipitation at 465 stations across the United Kingdom between 1961 and 2000 using simulated precipitation from two RCMs (RACMO 2 and CCLM) and, for the first time, a GCM (ECHAM 5) as predictors. The large-scale weather states in each simulation are forced toward observations. The MOS method uses logistic regression to model precipitation occurrence and a Gamma distribution for the wet day distribution, and is cross validated based on Brier and quantile skill scores. A major outcome of the study is that the corrected GCM-simulated precipitation yields consistently higher validation scores than the corrected RCM-simulated precipitation. This seems to suggest that, in a setup with postprocessing, there is no clear added value by RCMs with respect to downscaling individual weather states. However, due to the different ways of controlling the atmospheric circulation in the RCM and the GCM simulations, such a strong conclusion cannot be drawn. Yet the study demonstrates how challenging it is to demonstrate the value added <b>by</b> RCMs in <b>this</b> <b>setup...</b>|$|R

Synchrotron bending magnets provide X-ray beams of sufficiently high brightness and cross section for spatially resolved measurements of birefringence. The recently developed X-ray Birefringence Imaging (XBI) technique has been successfully applied {{for the first time}} using the versatile test beamline B 16 at Diamond Light Source. Orientational distributions of the C–Br bonds of brominated “guest” molecules within crystalline “host” tunnel structures (in thiourea or urea inclusion compounds) have been studied using linearly polarized incident X-rays near the Br K-edge. Imaging of domain structures, changes in C–Br bond orientations associated with order-disorder phase transitions, and the effects of dynamic averaging of C–Br bond orientations have been demonstrated. The XBI setup uses a vertically deflecting high-resolution double-crystal monochromator upstream from the sample and a horizontally deflecting single-crystal polarization analyzer downstream, with a Bragg angle {{as close as possible to}} 45 °. In this way, the ellipticity and rotation angle of the polarization of the beam transmitted through the sample is measured as in polarizing optical microscopy. The theoretical instrumental background calculated from the elliptical polarization of the bending-magnet X-rays, the imperfect polarization discrimination of the analyzer, and the correlation between vertical position and photon energy introduced by the monochromator agrees well with experimental observations.

However, on November 22, 2013, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) halted the sale of genetic health testing, {{on the grounds that}} 23 andMe was not acting in accordance with federal law, by selling tests of undemonstrated reliability as predictive tests for medical risk factors. Consumers could still obtain the genetic ancestry report, but they no longer had access to the genetic health report in the United States (US). However, this did not prevent the company from continuing its health research, with previously obtained and future samples, provided that consent had been obtained from the consumers concerned, or with health reports for individuals from other countries. Furthermore, 23 andMe was granted FDA authorization on February 19, 2015, first to provide reports about Bloom syndrome carrier status, and, more recently, to provide consumers with “carrier status” information for 35 genes known (with high levels of confidence) to cause disease. DiscussionIn this Debate, we highlight the likelihood that the primary objective of the company was probably two-fold: promoting itself within the market for predictive testing for human genetic diseases and ancestry at a low cost to consumers, and establishing a high-value database/biobank for research (one of the largest biobanks of human deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and personal information).

40|$|In {{the first}} part of this work, {{magnetized}} nanoporous silica based microparticles (MMPs) are used for horseradish peroxidase (HRP) immobilization and applied in amperometric peroxidase-based biosensors. A homemade magnetized carbon paste electrode permits the MMPs attraction close to the electrode surface. The resulting original biosensor is applied to the investigation of enzymatic oxidation of model drug compounds namely, clozapine (CLZ) and acetaminophen (APAP) by HRP in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. The biosensor operates at a low applied potential and the signal corresponds to the electro-reduction of electroactive species enzymatically generated. The biosensor allows performing the quantitation of the two drug compounds in the micromolar concentration range. It allows also the study of thiol compounds based on the inhibition of the biosensor response. Interestingly, distinct inhibition results are observed for HRP entrapped in the silica microparticles compared to the soluble HRP. We expect that this type of biosensors holds high promise in quantitative analysis and in biotransformation studies of drug compounds. In the second part of this thesis work, HRP immobilized magnetic nanoparticles are injected on-line and magnetically retained, as a microreactor, in the capillary of a CE setup. The purpose of such a configuration is to develop an analytical tool for studying “in vitro” drug biotransformation. The advantages expected are (i) minimum sample (drug compound) and biocomponent (enzyme) consumption, (ii) high analysis throughput, (iii) selectivity and sensitivity. In order to illustrate the potential of such an instrumental configuration, it has been applied to study acetaminophen as model drug compound. The mechanistic information obtained by the HRP/H 2 O 2 system is in agreement with literature data on acetaminophen metabolization. Horseradish peroxidase kinetic studies are realized <b>by</b> <b>this</b> <b>setup</b> and the apparent Michaelis constant is determined.
