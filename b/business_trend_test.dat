40|$|In rodent cancer bioassays, {{groups of}} animals {{are exposed to}} {{different}} doses of a chemical of interest and followed for tumor occurrence. The resulting tumor rates are commonly analyzed using a survival-adjusted Cochran-Armitage (CA) <b>trend</b> <b>test.</b> The CA <b>trend</b> <b>test</b> has reasonable power when the tumor-response curve is linear in dose, {{but it may be}} underpowered for a nonlinear response. An alternative survival-adjusted test procedure based on isotonic regression methodology has previously been proposed. Although this alternative procedure performs well when the tumor response is nonlinear in dose, it has less power than the CA <b>trend</b> <b>test</b> when the response is linear in dose. Here, we introduce a new survival-adjusted test procedure that makes use of both the CA <b>trend</b> <b>test</b> and the isotonic regression-based <b>trend</b> <b>test.</b> Using a broad range of experimental conditions typical of National Toxicology Program (NTP) bioassays, we conducted extensive computer simulations to compare the false-positive error rate and power of the proposed procedure with the survival-adjusted CA <b>trend</b> <b>test.</b> The new procedure competes well with the survival-adjusted CA <b>trend</b> <b>test</b> when observed tumor rates are linear in dose and performs substantially better when observed tumor rates are nonlinear in dose. Further, the proposed <b>trend</b> <b>test</b> almost always has a smaller false-positive rate than does the survival-adjusted CA <b>trend</b> <b>test.</b> We also developed an order-restricted inference-based procedure for performing multiple pairwise comparisons between each of the dose groups and the control group. The <b>trend</b> <b>test</b> and the multiple pairwise comparisons test are demonstrated using an example from a study conducted by the NTP.

40|$|In the {{analysis}} of case‐control genetic association, the <b>trend</b> <b>test</b> and Pearson’s test {{are the two most}} commonly used tests. In genome‐wide association studies (GWAS), Bayes factor (BF) is a useful tool to support significant ‐values, and a better measure than ‐value when results are compared across studies with different sample sizes. When reporting the ‐value of the <b>trend</b> <b>test,</b> we propose a BF directly based on the <b>trend</b> <b>test.</b> To improve the power to detect association under recessive or dominant genetic models, we propose a BF based on the <b>trend</b> <b>test</b> and incorporating Hardy–Weinberg disequilibrium in cases. When the true model is unknown, or both the <b>trend</b> <b>test</b> and Pearson’s test or other robust tests are applied in genome‐wide scans, we propose a joint BF, combining the previous two BFs. All three BFs studied in this paper have closed forms and are easy to compute without integrations, so they can be reported along with ‐values, especially in GWAS. We discuss how to use each of them and how to specify priors. Simulation studies and applications to three GWAS are provided to illustrate their usefulness to detect nonadditive gene susceptibility in practice...|$|R

The risk was reduced with increasing intake of dark green/dark yellow vegetables (<b>trend</b> <b>test,</b> P= 0. 02), fresh legumes (<b>trend</b> <b>test,</b> P< 0. 01), and allium vegetables (<b>trend</b> <b>test,</b> P= 0. 04).

40|$|Abstract: Proper {{statistical}} analysis of data from subchronic and chronic stud-ies is a key aspect of their data analysis and interpretation. We discuss the motivation and illustrate the use of <b>trend</b> <b>tests</b> for continuous quantitative data from such studies. Because responses are often more severe (increase or de-crease) with increasing dose, <b>trend</b> <b>tests</b> are the most appropriate statistical procedures to apply. Several parametric and nonparametric <b>trend</b> <b>tests</b> are defined and applied to a small set of male liver weight data from a 14 -day rat study. Shortcomings of more standard statistical procedures applied to data from such studies are discussed as well. We recommend the use of <b>trend</b> <b>tests</b> as the customary method for analyzing data from these studies. Key Words: Statistical methods-Data analysis-Subchronic study-Chronic study-Safety testing. Statistical analyses of data from animal safety studies have commonly {{been part of the}} routine data analysis and interpretation in such studies for many years.

40|$|Repairable systems {{reliability}} <b>trend</b> <b>tests</b> are reviewed, extensively {{tested and}} compared {{to evaluate their}} effectiveness over diverse data patterns. A repairable system is often modeled as a counting failure process. For a counting failure process, successive inter-arrival failure times will tend to become larger (smaller) for an improving (deteriorating) system. During testing and development of new systems, reliability trend analysis is needed to evaluate {{the progress of the}} design development and improvement process. Often a program of testing and modification, followed by more testing and modification, is required to achieve a desired system reliability goal. Reliability <b>trend</b> <b>tests</b> can be an important part of this program. The objective of system reliability <b>trend</b> <b>tests</b> is to determine whether and how the pattern of failures is significantly changing with time. This paper reviews the following four trend tests: (1) Crow/AMSAA Test, (2) PCNT (pairwise comparison nonparametric test), (3) Laplace Test, and (4) Lewis-Robinson Test. These tests are extensively tested, evaluated and compared for diverse repairable system reliability trends. Particular emphasis focused on comparisons with low sample sizes. Simulation models for <b>trend</b> <b>tests</b> are presented and discussed; and simulation results are summarized and compared. Based on these comparisons, it is concluded that the Crow/AMSAA test is the most robust <b>trend</b> <b>test...</b>|$|R
