5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1993, Evan Chandler accused Michael Jackson of sexually abusing his 13-year-old son, Jordan. The {{relationship}} between Jackson and Jordan had begun in May 1992; Chandler initially welcomed and encouraged the friendship, and <b>bragged</b> <b>about</b> his connection to a celebrity. The friendship became well known as the tabloid media reported that Jackson {{became a member of}} the Chandler family.|$|E
5|$|After {{being shot}} in the head during the {{previous}} episode, Officer Thormann (Lee Tergesen) has had a miraculous recovery and will live, although doctors say he will be blind all his life. Crosetti (Jon Polito) and Lewis (Clark Johnson) question prime suspect Alfred Smith (Mojo Gentry), who was identified by eyewitness Charles Flavin (Larry Hull) as the shooter. Crosetti, a close personal friend of Thormann, is convinced Smith is the shooter, but Lewis insists on further investigation. Lewis later learns Flavin <b>bragged</b> <b>about</b> shooting a cop the day Thormann was shot. Crosetti confronts Flavin, who nonchalantly admits to shooting Thormann in frustration because Flavin was suffering a migraine. Although the police celebrate finding Thormann's shooter, Lewis comforts a guilt-stricken Crosetti, who feels he took the case too personally and almost let the true shooter go free.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, Bure {{sued the}} Russian {{newspaper}} the eXile for publishing an article stating he {{broke up with}} Kournikova because she had two vaginas. Although the newspapers' editorial staff claimed the story was a mere joke, the court ruled in favour of Bure {{in the amount of}} 500,000 rubles (US$17,770), and ordered a retraction to be printed. Two years later, on December 27, 2004, the Russian cosmetics chain Arbat Prestige published a story in their free promotional paper that Bure had <b>bragged</b> <b>about</b> Kournikova losing her virginity to him. Shortly thereafter, on January 31, 2005, Bure sued Arbat Prestige for 300million rubles (US$10.65million) in a court in Moscow. He also demanded the company print a retraction and apology in a future paper. The court ruled in favour of Bure in November 2005. However, the amount was reduced from 300million to approximately 320,000 rubles.|$|E

5|$|A former {{employee}} of Chandler's {{testified that he}} <b>bragged</b> <b>about</b> dating three women on the bay that night, and that {{the next morning he}} arrived and delivered materials for a job by boat and immediately set out again. In an attempt to establish Chandler's whereabouts {{on the night of the}} murders, investigators found records of several ship-to-shore telephone calls made from his boat to his home between 1:00am and 5:00am, which may have been attempts to explain his absence to his wife, and to provide himself with an alibi for the time of the murders. Chandler's daughter, Kristal May Sue, testified that her father had talked about killing three women, and that he was afraid of returning to Tampa. A maid, who worked at the motel where the Rogers women stayed, testified that she walked past Chandler on June 1 as she was heading for the Rogers' room for room service. She said that she did not realize the significance of this sighting until Chandler's arrest in 1992; the sighting has never been confirmed. Michelle's boyfriend and Hal Rogers also took the stand during trial.|$|E

40|$|People often <b>brag</b> <b>about,</b> or advertise, {{their good}} deeds to others. Seven studies {{investigate}} how <b>bragging</b> <b>about</b> prosocial behavior affects perceived generosity. The authors propose that <b>bragging</b> conveys information <b>about</b> an actor's good deeds, {{leading to an}} attribution of generosity. However, bragging also signals a selfish motivation (a desire for credit) that undermines the attribution of generosity. Thus, bragging has a positive effect when prosocialbehavior is unknown because it informs others that an actor has behaved generously. However, bragging does not help - and often hurts - when prosocial behavior is already known, because it signals a selfish motive. Additionally, the authors demonstrate that conspicuous cause marketingproducts have effects akin to bragging by signaling an impure motive for doing good deeds. Finally, {{the authors argue that}} <b>bragging</b> <b>about</b> prosocial behavior is unique because it undermines the precise information that the braggart is trying to convey (generosity). In contrast, <b>bragging</b> <b>about</b> personal achievements does not affect perceptions of the focal trait conveyed in the brag. These findings underscore the strategic considerations inherent in signaling altruism...|$|R

Upon being deported, Saenz <b>bragged</b> <b>about</b> his time on the run and even told authorities he had attended Los Angeles Lakers basketball games while on the run.|$|E
25|$|Pamela Clark {{regularly}} exercised at the Miramar Road {{health club}} before noon, and {{a swimming pool}} attendance log placed Prince {{in the vicinity of}} Holly Tarr. Prince struck when he knew his victims would be showering and thus be less attentive to their surroundings. He later <b>bragged</b> <b>about</b> the killings to a friend and took to wearing the dead woman’s wedding ring on a chain around his neck. He gave another ring to his girlfriend as a Christmas present after taking it from Tarr.|$|E

Hans Gerd Techow was arrested the following day, Ernst Werner Techow, who was visiting his uncle, three days later. Fischer and Kern, however, remained on the loose. After a daring flight, which kept Germany in suspense {{for more than two}} weeks, they were finally spotted at Saaleck Castle in Thuringia, whose owner was himself a secret member of the Organisation Consul. On 17 July, they were confronted by two police detectives. While waiting for reinforcements during the stand-off, one of the detectives fired at a window, unknowingly killing Kern by a bullet in the head. Fischer then took his own life.|$|E
25|$|Gravano {{has been}} the object of many {{unproven}} charges. Federal inmates who served time with Gravano claimed that he privately admitted to {{a role in the}} 1980 killing of a New York cop. Inmates also claimed that Gravano <b>bragged</b> <b>about</b> killing many more than 19 people. Lynda Milito claimed in her book Mafia Wife she had heard Gravano had smothered an elderly woman to death during a botched robbery. Milito also claimed that Gravano's former crew members told her that Gravano had shot her husband Louie Milito twice {{in the back of the}} head and once under the chin. In his court testimony, Gravano had claimed to be a bystander when Milito was shot. John Gotti's lawyers also accused Gravano of being involved in two other murders that were not disclosed by the FBI.|$|E
25|$|Lessons were learned however, in {{particular}} at Falmouth, where Mountjoy's consultant military engineer Paul Ivey {{was responsible for}} strengthening the castles at St Mawes and Pendennis.
