5|$|Because PGAD is {{relatively}} rare and, {{as its own}} concept apart from clitoral priapism, has only been researched since 2001, there is little research into what may cure or remedy the disorder.

5|$|By the 21st century {{many of the}} Device Forts {{had been}} damaged <b>by,</b> <b>or</b> in some cases lost entirely, to coastal erosion; the problem had existed at some {{locations}} since the 16th century and still persists, for example at Hurst. East Cowes Castle and East Tilbury Fort have been entirely lost, while the East Blockhouse, Mersea and Sandsfoot have been badly damaged, a third of Sandgate and most of St Andrews have been washed away. Other sites were demolished, built upon or simply eroded over time; almost no trace remains of the bulwarks along the Downs, for example. The remaining sites are protected by UK conservation law, either as scheduled monuments or listed buildings.|$|E
5|$|Bynesian decay usually starts when {{specimens}} {{are stored}} or displayed for considerable {{periods of time}} in an enclosed space.

60|$|Much mighty speech-making {{there has}} been, {{both in and}} out of Parliament, {{concerning}} Tom, and much wrathful disputation how Tom shall be got right.

In the midst of which dust and noise there is but one thing perfectly clear, to wit, that Tom only may and can, or shall and will, be reclaimed according to somebody's theory but nobody's practice. And in the hopeful meantime, Tom goes to perdition head foremost in his old determined spirit.|$|R

5|$|During the study, various {{accusations of}} foul play <b>by</b> <b>or</b> unsuitability of both {{submarine}} designers were made by Australian politicians and the media. These included claims that the similar left-wing political leanings of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Swedish Social Democratic Party, both in power at the time, {{would lead to a}} pro-Kockums bias, investigations into perceived coaching of IDL/HDW representatives in the questions to be asked at an ALP Caucus briefing session on the project, and public emphasis on security incidents in both Sweden and West Germany. These incidents either lacked supporting evidence or were proven false, and were the result of the Liberal Party attempting to discredit the Labor government, or pro-British politicians and organisations who believed both submarines were inferior to the Vickers Type 2400offering.|$|E

5|$|Malaysia's {{legal system}} {{is based on}} English Common Law. Although the {{judiciary}} is theoretically independent, its independence has been called into question and the appointment of judges lacks accountability and transparency. The highest court in the judicial system is the Federal Court, followed by the Court of Appeal and two high courts, one for Peninsular Malaysia and one for East Malaysia. Malaysia also has a special court to hear cases brought <b>by</b> <b>or</b> against royalty. The death penalty is in use for serious crimes such as murder, terrorism, drug trafficking, and kidnapping. Separate from and running parallel to the civil courts are the Syariah Courts, which apply Shariah law to Muslims {{in the areas of}} family law and religious observances. Homosexuality is illegal in Malaysia.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the most}} renowned works he ordered was the raising of the Sigismund's Column in Warsaw. The column, {{dedicated}} to his father, was designed by the Italian-born architect Constantino Tencalla and the sculptor Clemente Molli, and cast by Daniel Tym. He was less interested in decorative architecture; he supported the construction of two palaces in Warsaw – Kazanowski Palace and Villa Regia. Among other works sponsored <b>by</b> <b>or</b> dedicated to him is Guido Reni's The Rape of Europa.|$|E
5|$|The Chronicle of Mann, {{the only}} {{narrative}} {{source for the}} dynasty's realm, was compiled on Mann during Magnús' reign. Analysis of the document reveals that the main scribe's last entry dates to 1257, in an account which records {{the dedication of the}} Abbey of St Mary of Rushen in the presence of Magnús and Richard, Bishop of the Isles. The chronicle thus appears to have been commissioned <b>by,</b> <b>or</b> on behalf of, Magnús himself. The chronicle is somewhat biased in favour of one line of the dynasty over anotherthe line of Magnús's father, Óláfr, over that of Óláfr's rival half-brother Rǫgnvaldr. For example, Haraldr Guðrøðarson is depicted as a usurper and tyrant, in contrast to the legitimate kingship of his cousin, Magnús. In fact, one reason for the chronicle's composition may have been to legitimise the line of Óláfr which, {{at the time of the}} chronicle's compilation, was then represented by Magnús himself.|$|E
5|$|The {{court was}} unwilling to extend the {{traditional}} defence of qualified privilege as it was {{of the opinion that}} Parliament's intention in enacting section 14 was clear: it is wholly untenable that the speech made at an election rally is privileged when the same speech published <b>by</b> <b>or</b> on behalf of a candidate for the election is not.|$|E

5|$|The new {{ideals of}} humanism, {{although}} more secular in some aspects, developed against a Christian backdrop, {{especially in the}} Northern Renaissance. Much, if not most, of the new art was commissioned <b>by</b> <b>or</b> in dedication to the Church. However, the Renaissance {{had a profound effect}} on contemporary theology, particularly in the way people perceived the relationship between man and God. Many of the period's foremost theologians were followers of the humanist method, including Erasmus, Zwingli, Thomas More, Martin Luther, and John Calvin.|$|E
5|$|The offensive, {{together}} with Operation Sana, caused controversy among military analysts regarding {{the issue of}} whether NATO airstrikes or the two ground offensives contributed more towards the resolution of the Bosnian War, and to what extent ARBiH, HVO and HV advances were helped <b>by,</b> <b>or</b> conversely the VRS hampered by, NATO bombing. In 2011, five former Croatian military personnel were convicted of war crimes for the summary execution of five Bosnian Serb soldiers and an unknown civilian during the offensive.|$|E
