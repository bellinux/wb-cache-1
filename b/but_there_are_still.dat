5|$|Many {{thousands}} of religious objects and artefacts were destroyed, including paintings, sculptures, altarpieces, stained glass, and crucifixes, and the survival rate {{of works by}} the major artists is low – even Jan van Eyck has only some 24 extant works confidently attributed to him. The number grows with later artists, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> anomalies; Petrus Christus is considered a major artist, but is given {{a smaller number of}} works than van Eyck. In general the later 15th-century works exported to southern Europe have a much higher survival rate.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the Second World War, many shophouses, usually {{two stories}} with {{functional}} shops {{on the ground}} floor and separate residential spaces upstairs, were built around the old city centre. These shop-houses drew inspiration from Straits Chinese and European traditions. Some of these shophouses have made way for new developments <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> many standing today around Medan Pasar (Old Market Square), Chinatown, Jalan Tuanku Abdul Rahman, Jalan Doraisamy, Bukit Bintang and Tengkat Tong Shin areas.|$|E

5|$|Lakes in the {{watershed}} of Leggetts Creek include the Griffin Reservoir, Maple Lake, and Summit Lake. These {{bodies of water}} are in South Abington Township and Scott Township. The Griffin Reservoir supplies water {{to people in the}} Leggetts Creek watershed. The creek and the reservoir serve as a supplemental drinking water supply for more than 100,000 people as of the late 20th century. A spring known as Fountain Springs is in {{the watershed}} in South Abington Township. The Justus Meadows are in the watershed in Scott Township. Most of the watershed is developed, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> a few undeveloped reaches of the creek.|$|E
5|$|The {{attribution}} {{of the panel}} reflects the progression and trends of 19th and 20th-century scholarship on Early Netherlandish art. It is now {{thought to have been}} completed c. 1438–40, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> arguments for dates as early as 1424–29. As with the pages ascribed to Hand G in the Turin-Milan Hours manuscript, the panel was attributed to Jan's brother Hubert van Eyck in the 1875 Gemäldegalerie catalogue, and by a 1911 claim by art historian Georges Hulin de Loo. This is no longer considered credible and Hubert, today, is credited with very few works. By 1912 the painting had been definitively attributed to Jan in the museum catalogue.|$|E
5|$|The {{observed}} {{relationship between}} the luminosity of the hydroxyl line and the far infrared suggests that hydroxyl megamasers are radiatively pumped. Initial VLBI measurements of nearby hydroxyl megamasers seemed to present {{a problem with this}} model for compact emission components of hydroxyl megamasers, as they required a very high fraction of infrared photons to be absorbed by hydroxyl and lead to a maser photon being emitted, making collisional excitation a more plausible pumping mechanism. However, a model of maser emission with a clumpy masing medium appear to be able to reproduce the observed properties of compact and diffuse hydroxyl emission. A recent detailed treatment finds that photons with a wavelength of 53 micrometres are the primary pump for main line maser emission, and applies to all hydroxyl masers. In order to provide enough photons at this wavelength, the interstellar dust that reprocesses stellar radiation to infrared wavelengths must have a temperature of at least 45 kelvins. Recent observations with the Spitzer Space Telescope confirm this basic picture, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> some discrepancies between details of the model and observations of hydroxyl megamaser host galaxies such as the required dust opacity for megamaser emission.|$|E

They view the abandonment of the traditionally practised doctrine of Headship as evidence of an overall apostasy (or moral deterioration) within Christendom and as leading to disorder and eventual anarchy within their fellowships.|$|E

25|$|Protestantism {{arrived to}} Ukraine {{together}} with German {{immigrants in the}} 18th and 19th centuries.

While some were Catholic, the majority were either Evangelical (in North America known as Lutheran) or Mennonite (Anabaptist). Of the 200,000 or so Germans in Volhynia c.1900, some 90% or so were Lutheran. Lutheranism went into a major decline with the emigration {{of most of the}} Germans out of the region during the World Wars <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> small remnants today (2006) in the Odessa and Kiev regions.|$|E
