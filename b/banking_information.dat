The foundation is registered {{in the name of}} a Liechtensteiner, often a lawyer. [...] This set of laws used to make Liechtenstein a popular tax haven for extremely wealthy individuals and businesses attempting to avoid or evade taxes in their home countries. In recent years, Liechtenstein has displayed a stronger determination to prosecute international money-launderers and has worked to promote the country's image as a legitimate finance center. In February 2008, the country's LGT Bank was implicated in a tax-fraud scandal in Germany, which strained the ruling family's relationship with the German government. Crown Prince Alois has accused the German government of trafficking in stolen goods, referring to its $7.3 million purchase of private <b>banking</b> <b>information</b> offered by a former employee of LGT Group. However, the United States Senate's subcommittee on tax haven banks said that the LGT bank, which is owned by the princely family, and on whose board they serve, [...] "is a willing partner, and an aider and abettor to clients trying to evade taxes, dodge creditors or defy court orders".|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} {{efforts to increase}} taxation of highly concentrated, undertapped income and profits in Latin America {{in the aftermath of}} structural adjustment. Argentina has advanced further than Chile in two policy areas: corporate taxation, which taps firm-level profits; and tax agency access to <b>bank</b> <b>information,</b> which helps reduce income tax evasion. These outcomes are explained by drawing on the classic concepts of business instrumental power, which entails political actions, and structural power, which arises from investment decisions. In Chile, strong instrumental power removed reforms in both areas from the policy agenda. In Argentina, much weaker instrumental power at the cross-sectoral level facilitated corporate tax increases. <b>Bank</b> <b>information</b> access was expanded after Argentina's 2001 crisis weakened the financial sector's instrumental power and reduced structural power...|$|R

The larger <b>banks</b> exploit this <b>information</b> advantage in placing limit orders as well as market orders. We also show that the <b>bank’s</b> private <b>information</b> {{does not come from}} their corporate or government customers or from some asset managers. Instead, the <b>bank’s</b> private <b>information</b> appears to come from other asset managers, including hedge funds, and from the bank’s own analysis...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWe empirically {{study the}} asset side of market {{discipline}} in the banking system of the Kyrgyz Republic, examining whether borrowers {{are willing to pay}} higher interest rates to high-quality banks. Based on dynamic panel models and a dataset with <b>bank</b> <b>information</b> from 23 <b>banks</b> over the period 2010 – 2012, our findings suggest the presence of market discipline induced by borrowers. In other words, banks with higher capital ratios and liquidity charge higher interest rates on loans. This result has several implications for the banking policy in Kyrgyzstan, where we can recommend to policymakers a disclosure policy following the Third Pillar of Basel III, because not only can the bank's creditors use <b>bank</b> <b>information</b> to penalize the excessive bank risk, but borrowers can also use this information to discipline their banks...|$|R
