The buckling curves are evaluated according to the statistical procedure given in Annex D of EN 1990 using finite element analyses. The residual stress model as described in a related paper was used to define the initial stress state of the column in the finite element model. A large database was created containing the ratio between the elastic–plastic buckling resistance obtained from finite element analysis and the buckling resistance obtained from the proposed <b>buckling</b> <b>curve</b> for a wide set of column configurations from which a partial factor ¿Rd was deduced.

40|$|Current design {{standards}} do not appropriately recognise the characteristic nonlinear stress-strain behaviour with significant strain hardening offered by stainless steel. Loss of effectiveness due to local buckling is dealt with effective width method, which is unjustified for stainless steel {{as there is}} no obvious yield plateau. With recent developments, the continuous strength method (CSM) was shown to accurately predict cross-section resistances of stocky sections exploiting the benefit of strain hardening. The current research extended the scope of CSM for slender sections retaining the same base curve, and also develop CSM based design guidelines for predicting the buckling resistance of stainless steel columns. A new concept of using the equivalent elastic deformation capacity, defined as the elastic strain at ultimate load, was proposed for slender sections. A comprehensive FE study was carried out to establish relationships between the equivalent elastic deformation capacity and buckling strain of CSM. Proposed relationships allowed using the same CSM base curve for both stocky and slender sections, and hence, cross-section resistances could be directly determined using CSM buckling stress and gross cross-sectional properties. Once CSM was successfully implemented for all cross-section types, the current study extended its scope to the member level.

40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} {{buckling}} behavior of I-shaped steel columns under {{the effect of}} thermal gradients. The mechanical properties of steel decay signicantly with increasing temperature. Therefore, {{in case of a}} re, the buckling resistance of steel columns is considerably reduced due to the decrease in the modulus of elasticity and yield strength. Furthermore, in a realistic re scenario, temperature gradients develop throughout the cross-section and throughout the column's length. However, the design guidelines in Eurocode 1993 - 1 - 2, as well as in other leading construction codes, specify {{that in the case of}} a non-uniform temperature distribution the column's buckling resistance must be determined by considering a uniform temperature distribution considering the maximum temperature in the cross-section. The objective of this thesis is to assess the reliability of the provisions given by the Eurocode for elevated temperature design in the presence of temperature gradients. A series of finite element models were created for five different cross-sections and analyzed at room temperature, uniform elevated temperature and non-uniform temperature along the cross-section. From the uniform elevated temperature analysis, a <b>buckling</b> <b>curve</b> for elevated temperature was derived.

40|$|Cold-formed {{stainless}} steel oval hollow sections (OHS) offer the combined aesthetic appeal of circular hollow sections and {{stainless steel}}, {{together with the}} structural efficiency associated with cross-sections of differing geometric properties about their two principal axes. To date, no structural design guidance exists for these cross-sections, principally due to their relatively recent introduction {{and a lack of}} fundamental structural test data. This paper examines the structural response of stainless steel OHS compression members and presents design recommendations. A series of laboratory tests was carried out to generate fundamental structural performance data. Tensile coupon tests were initially performed to establish the basic material stress-strain characteristics of the sections. These were followed by stub column tests to determine the average compressive response of the cross-sections and flexural buckling tests to obtain ultimate load carrying capacity data for use in the determination of a suitable <b>buckling</b> <b>curve</b> for stainless steel OHS. Measurements of the geometric properties of the test specimens including initial imperfections were carried out. The full load-displacement responses of the specimens were recorded and have been presented herein. A finite element (FE) modelling programme was performed in parallel with the experimental study. Once the FE models had been validated against the test results, parametric studies were carried out to further investigate the influence of individual key parameters, including the aspect ratio and local slenderness of the cross-sections as well as the member slenderness. Based on the obtained experimental and numerical results, a class 3 limit for stainless steel OHS in compression and a suitable <b>buckling</b> <b>curve</b> for OHS columns have been proposed.

40|$|Cold roller bending is {{commonly}} used for bending straight members with hot rolled wide-flange sections to create arches. This process induces plastic deformations along the member, {{so that it can}} acquire the desired curvature. The resulting residual stress distribution is different from the well-known residual stress pattern due to hot rolling. Extensive {{studies have shown that the}} influence of residual stresses due to hot rolling on the resistance of wide-flange steel sections is non negligible. On the contrary, the residual stress pattern due to roller bending has been only recently clearly identified and its effects on the elasto-plastic behavior of curved members have not been studied sufficiently.

40|$|Stability of load {{carrying}} elements in glass The increasing demand in modern architecture for more slender and lighter structures requires {{the use of}} new construction materials. Glass, a material that has been used {{for a long time in}} windows as a filling material, has much to offer in this regard due to its very high compressive strength and transparency. For this reason, there is a growing trend to extend the use of glass sheets to {{load carrying}} elements such as columns, beams and panels. Due to their high slenderness and high compressive strength, such elements tend to fail because of instability (i. e. column buckling, lateral torsional buckling or plate buckling). At the moment little knowledge exists about the load carrying behaviour of glass structural elements, and existing design methods for other materials (i. e. steel) have been found to be unsuitable for direct transfer to the design of glass panels. With this in mind, the main objectives of the current thesis are: The study of the load carrying behaviour of glass elements which may fail due to lack of stability by means of laboratory tests and analytical and numerical models, as well as the study of the main influencing parameters. Discussion of possible design methods for glass elements which may fail due to lack of stability for the three main stability problems (column buckling, lateral torsional buckling and plate buckling) and proposition of possible aids for design such as <b>buckling</b> <b>curves.</b> The main influencing parameters (dispersion of the glass thickness, initial deformation) on the load carrying behaviour of glass elements which may fail due to lack of stability have been measured and are evaluated herein using statistical methods. The breakage stress, the thermal prestress and the effective tensile strength are defined and explained. Existing models to determine the tensile strength of glass are discussed. The column buckling behaviour of single layer and laminated safety glass is studied by means of column buckling tests, which are compared to analytical and numerical models. The models are used to study the influence of the main parameters, particularly the shear connection due to the interlayer (PVB) in laminated safety glass, on the load carrying behaviour and buckling strength of glass elements. On the basis of this study different possible design methods for column buckling of glass elements in compression are proposed and discussed. It is shown that a second order stress analysis is the most appropriate method for glass. As a further simplification, the cross section of a laminated safety glass structural element can be modelled as a monolithic cross section with an effective thickness. Analytical and numerical models for the lateral torsional buckling of glass beams are also verified by a comparison to test results. Along with a study of the main parameters, different methods to determine the lateral torsional buckling strength are discussed, and it is shown that <b>buckling</b> <b>curves</b> for lateral torsional buckling should be developed for glass beams using a slenderness ratio based on effective tensile strength. As a result of numerical simulations, recommendations for the future development of lateral torsional <b>buckling</b> <b>curves</b> of glass beams are given. The column buckling behaviour of single layer and laminated safety glass is also studied by means of column buckling tests, analytical and numerical models. It is shown that glass panels have a large post critical load carrying capacity but the way the loads are introduced into the panels, as well as the buckling shape, have an important influence on the plate buckling capacity.

40|$|The {{existing}} design expressions for the {{lateral-torsional buckling}} behavior of castellated beams conflict. Furthermore, {{they do not}} take into account the detrimental effect of the residual stress modification attributable to the fabrication process, which was only recently demonstrated by the authors.

In this paper, the lateral-torsional buckling behavior of doubly symmetric castellated beams loaded by a constant bending moment is investigated numerically. The numerical model, including the modified residual stresses, was validated by comparing its results with experimental results. A preliminary design approach is proposed based on the current European guidelines for the calculation of the lateral-torsional buckling resistance of I-section beams. According to the proposed approach, the lateral-torsional buckling resistance of castellated beams can be determined using the cross-sectional properties calculated at the center of the web opening.

To study the overall buckling behavior of high-strength steel columns, an experimental investigation on the ultimate bearing capacity of weld box and H columns with a nominal yield stress of 690 MPa subjected to axial compression was carried out. Twelve columns with slenderness ratios ranging from 30 to 70 were comprised in the experiment.

40|$|Vibration {{frequencies}} in {{the presence}} of geometrical effects, and buckling loads of FRP pultruded portal frames were determined for different restraint and load conditions. The kinematical model adopted is based on a second-order approximation of the displacement field and accounts for shear strain effects due to non-uniform bending and torsion. The seven unknown displacement functions were interpolated by a set of locking-free “modified” Hermitian polynomials. <b>Buckling</b> <b>curves</b> for one- and three-bay frames were determined, showing the influence of shear deformations and the stiffening effect of warping constraints. The role played by participant masses and external load second-order effects in dynamic response was pointed out. Frequency crossing between in-plane and out-of-plane fundamental vibration modes was observe...|$|R
40|$|The current {{practice}} of ultimate limit state design for steel structures involves an elastic [...] perfectly plastic material {{model and the}} classification of cross-sections into discrete behavioural classes. This leads to a design philosophy which is simple, but generally over-conservative. The Continuous Strength Method is a strain based design approach which allows for the beneficial influence of strain hardening. At {{the core of the}} method is a base curve which relates the deformation capacity of a cross-section to its cross-section slenderness. Deformation capacity is defined through a strain ratio, which is the ratio of the maximum strain that a cross-section can endure to its yield strain. The formulation for the base curve was derived by means of stub column and bending tests collected from the literature. Knowing the limiting strain and assuming plane sections remain plane, the resistance of cross-sections to combinations of axial load and bending moments can be calculated by integrating the stresses arising from a suitable strain hardening material model over the area of the cross-section. Analytical and design expressions have been developed, and the resistance predictions for open and closed cross-section shapes have been compared with existing collated test data, and shown to give additional capacity over current design approaches, with a reduction in scatter and a more consistent method. Beyond the analysis of the cross-section, the method has been extended to the global instability of pin-ended columns by utilising moment [...] curvature [...] thrust curves. The curves were paired with an assumed buckled displacement shape to find applicable equilibrium configurations, and to extract the peak axial loads for producing <b>buckling</b> <b>curves.</b> The column <b>buckling</b> <b>curves</b> showed two distinct regions based on the global slenderness of the column. Firstly a region of global-dominated failure, where the columns failed by a loss of overall flexural rigidity, and secondly a local-dominated failure region, where the mid-height cross-sections failed by local buckling. The local cross-section failure mode allowed for axial loads greater than the cross-section yield loads. The column <b>buckling</b> <b>curves</b> were found to be dependent on the initial out-of-straightness, the cross-section geometry and the material yield stress. An experimental program provided insight into the cross-section resistance of hot-rolled rectangular hollow sections (RHS). The experiments included 32 material tensile coupon tests, eight stub column tests and four simply supported beam tests, and exhibited little strain hardening. Overall, a series of developments to a strain based approach for steel structures has been presented, and areas for future developments have also been highlighted. Open Acces...|$|R
