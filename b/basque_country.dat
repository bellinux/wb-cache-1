5|$|There are {{currently}} an estimated 500 speakers in the Southern <b>Basque</b> <b>Country</b> in Spain, approximately 2% {{of a population}} of 21,000 Romanis, and another estimated 500 in France. In Spain the remaining fluent speakers are elderly people mostly {{over the age of}} 80; some are equally fluent in Spanish, Basque, or Caló. Middle-aged Erromintxela are mostly passive bilinguals, and the youngest speak only Basque or Spanish. In the Northern <b>Basque</b> <b>Country,</b> however, the language is still being passed on to children. The percentage of speakers among Spanish Erromintxela are higher than 2%, as large numbers of Caló-speaking Romanis moved to the <b>Basque</b> <b>Country</b> in the intense period of industrialisation in the 20th century.|$|E

5|$|Erromintxela {{is a mixed}} {{language}} (referred to as Para-Romani in Romani linguistics), deriving most of its vocabulary from Kalderash Romani {{but using}} Basque grammar, {{similar to the way}} the Angloromani language of the Roma in England mixes Romani vocabulary and English grammar. The development of the mixed language was facilitated by the unusually-deep integration of the Erromintxela people into Basque society and the resultant bilingualism in Basque. The language is in decline; most of the perhaps 1000 remaining speakers live on the coast of Labourd and in the mountainous regions of Soule, Navarre, Gipuzkoa and Biscay. The Erromintxela are the descendants of a 15th-century wave of Kalderash Roma, who entered the <b>Basque</b> <b>Country</b> via France. Both ethnically and linguistically, they are distinct from the Caló-speaking Romani people in Spain and the Cascarot Romani people of the Northern <b>Basque</b> <b>Country.</b>|$|E

50|$|From 1784 onwards, {{after the}} French Revolution, taking a bath {{at the sea}} {{was no longer a}} {{behaviour}} of those who were fools; sea-baths were fashionable. In 1808, Napoleon himself broke prejudices and took a bath on the <b>Basque</b> <b>Country’s</b> coastal water.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} 80s, the VII Assembly was held, which sought {{a way out}} of armed struggle. ETA(pm) - VII Assembly, through the {{mediation}} of its political alter ego, the party Euskadiko Ezkerra (<b>Basque</b> <b>Country's</b> Left), accepted a policy of individual pardons to all members who publicly renounced violence. Many of its former members integrated into Euskadiko Ezkerra, which later fused with the Socialist Party of the <b>Basque</b> Country-Basque <b>Country</b> Left (PSE), the Basque affiliate of the national Spanish Socialist Workers' Party.|$|R
5|$|The oldest {{account of}} the {{language}} dates to 1855, when the French ethnographer Justin Cenac-Moncaut located the Erromintxela primarily in the Northern <b>Basque</b> <b>Country.</b> The oldest coherent Erromintxela text, a poem entitled Kama-goli, published by Basque writer Jon Mirande {{in a collection of}} Basque poetry, only dates to ca. 1960.|$|E
5|$|As one of {{the larger}} towns in the French <b>Basque</b> <b>Country,</b> Bayonne had been {{one of the}} main bases of ETA {{organisation}} there. From 1975 onwards this had prompted a reaction from anti-ETA groups. In April 1975, Mugalde, a Basque bookshop in the town, was bombed, though no one was injured. On 25 June 1979, Enrique Gómez Álvarez, an alleged ETA member, was killed by the Batallón Vasco Español (BVE), a right-wing paramilitary group active since 1975.|$|E
5|$|Euskadiko Ezkerra, the Communist Party of Spain and the People's Alliance also issued {{statements}} {{condemning the}} attack.

50|$|The Basque Autonomous Community ranks {{first in}} Spain {{in terms of}} per capita income, with gross {{domestic}} product (GDP) per capita being 40% {{higher than that of}} the European Union and 33.8% higher than Spain's average in 2010, at €31,314. Industrial activities were traditionally centered on steel and shipbuilding, mainly due to the rich iron ore resources found during the 19th century around Bilbao. The Estuary of Bilbao {{was the center of the}} <b>Basque</b> <b>Country's</b> industrial revolution during the 19th and the first half of the 20th century. These activities decayed during the economic crisis of the 1970s and 1980s, giving ground for the development of the services sector and new technologies.Today, the strongest industrial sectors of the <b>Basque</b> <b>Country's</b> economy are machine tool, present in the valleys of Biscay and Gipuzkoa; aeronautics in Vitoria-Gasteiz; and energy, in Bilbao.|$|R

5|$|St. John's {{is one of}} North America's oldest European settlements, with {{fishermen}} {{setting up}} seasonal camps in the early 16th century. Sebastian Cabot declares in a handwritten Latin text in his original 1545 map, that St. John's earned its name {{when he and his}} father, the Venetian explorer John Cabot became the first Europeans to sail into the harbour, in the morning of 24 June 1494 (against British and French historians stating 1497), the feast day of Saint John the Baptist. However, the locations of Cabot's landfalls are disputed. A series of expeditions to St. John's by Portuguese from the Azores took place in the early 16th century, and by 1540 French, Spanish and Portuguese ships crossed the Atlantic annually to fish the waters off the Avalon Peninsula. In the <b>Basque</b> <b>Country,</b> it is a common belief the name of St. John's was given by Basque fishermen because the bay of St. John's is very similar to the Bay of Pasaia in the <b>Basque</b> <b>Country,</b> where one of the fishing towns is called St. John (in Spanish, San Juan, and in Basque, Donibane).|$|E
5|$|The {{team also}} sent squads to the Tour Down Under, the Tour of Qatar, the Tour of Oman, the Giro di Sardegna, Paris–Nice, the Volta a Catalunya, the Tour of the <b>Basque</b> <b>Country,</b> the Giro del Trentino, the Tour de Suisse, the Tour of Utah, Circuit Franco-Belge, and the Tour of Beijing, {{but did not}} achieve a stage win, {{classification}} win, or podium finish in any of them.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Basque</b> <b>Country's</b> flag, the Ikurriña, is also {{loosely based}} on the Union Jack, {{reflecting}} the significant commercial ties between Bilbao and Britain {{at the time the}} Ikurriña was designed in 1894. The Miskito people sometimes use a similar flag that also incorporates the Union Jack in its canton, due to long periods of contact in the Mosquito Coast.|$|R
50|$|While it {{may seem}} {{surprising}} for a Basque to have been sympathetic to the forces that leveled his hometown of Eibar, and for a Generalissimo that for years suppressed the teaching of Basque language in Spain, however, the <b>Basque</b> <b>countries</b> was also home to supporters of Carlism and their militia, the Requetés, who formed an uneasy alliance with the Falange.|$|R
50|$|Galicia is {{a center}} of Druidry (Galician: Druidaria) due to its strong Celtic heritage; the Pan-Galician Druidic Order (Galician: Irmandade Druídica Galaica) is {{specific}} to Galicia. In Basqueland, traditional Basque Gentility (Basque: Jentiltasuna) and Sorginkery (Basque: Sorginkeria), Basque witchcraft, have been revived and have ties with Basque nationalism. Sorginkoba Elkartea is a Basque Neopagan organisation active in the <b>Basque</b> <b>countries.</b>|$|R
5|$|Boletus aereus, {{the dark}} cep or bronze bolete, {{is a highly}} prized and much sought-after edible {{mushroom}} in the family Boletaceae. The bolete is widely consumed in Spain (<b>Basque</b> <b>Country</b> and Navarre), France, Italy, Greece, and generally throughout the Mediterranean. Described as a new species in 1789 by French mycologist Pierre Bulliard, it {{is closely related to}} several other European boletes, including B.reticulatus, B.pinophilus, and the popular B.edulis. Some populations in North Africa have been classified as a separate species, B.mamorensis, although they are phylogenetically very close.|$|E
5|$|Manchester City won the 1969 FA Cup Final {{to earn a}} {{place in}} the 1969–70 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup. Their first tie was against Atletico of Bilbao, in Spain's <b>Basque</b> <b>Country.</b> Atletico were {{themselves}} managed by an Englishman, Ronnie Allen. In the first leg, City recovered from a two-goal deficit to secure a 3–3 draw. The home leg was a routine 3–0 win. Post-match reports alleged that a scuffle had taken place at half-time between Mike Doyle and José Ramón Betzuen, The referee spoke to both managers, but did not take any further action.|$|E
5|$|The Erromintxela {{arrived in}} the <b>Basque</b> <b>Country</b> in the 15th century {{speaking}} Kalderash Romani. They integrated much more deeply into Basque society than other Romani groups. In the process, they acquired the Basque language and adopted aspects of Basque culture such as increased rights of women and important traditions such as bertsolaritza (extemporaneous poetic song) and pelota (the national Basque ballgame). Muñoz and Lopez de Mungia suspect that the morphological and phonological similarities between Romani and Basque facilitated the adoption of Basque grammar by the bilingual Romanis.|$|E
5000|$|The Mendoza {{family was}} a {{powerful}} line of Spanish nobles. Members of the family wielded considerable power, especially from the 14th to the 17th centuries in Castile.

50|$|Luis Aranberri (Eibar, 1945), {{better known}} as “Amatiño”, {{is one of the}} media {{professionals}} that best represents the new school of journalism in the Basque language, or Euskara, which emerged around 1970 and which, in step with the creation of the <b>Basque</b> <b>Country’s</b> own institutions, was accompanied by the development and consolidation of a Basque news arena that was practically non-existent up to barely one generation ago.|$|R
5|$|The French <b>Basque</b> <b>Country</b> {{had been}} a {{favourite}} haven of ETA. Since mid-1968 most of ETA's leadership had lived there and {{used it as a}} base for training, infrastructure and planning attacks. ETA commandos also operated from there, crossing the border into Spain to carry out attacks before fleeing back to France. This led to complaints in Spain that French authorities were not doing enough to tackle ETA activity, preferring to leave the Basque conflict to the Spanish to deal with.|$|E
5|$|The French {{sociologist}} Victor de Rochas {{refers to}} the Romani in the Northern <b>Basque</b> <b>Country</b> speaking Basque, rather than French, in his 1876 Les Parias de France et d'Espagne (cagots et bohémiens). The Canon Jean-Baptiste Daranatz published a wordlist in the periodical Eskualdun Ona in 1906 and in 1921 Berraondo and Oyarbide carried out some research. Although labelled gitano (Spanish for 'gypsy') or bohémien / gitan (French for 'gypsy'), some data {{can also be found}} in Azkue's 1905 dictionary and Pierre Lhande's 1926 dictionary, both of which list a number of words identifiable as Erromintxela.|$|E
5|$|The most traditionalist {{sectors of}} the {{political}} sphere systematically tried to prevent liberal reforms and to sustain the patrilineal monarchy. The Carlists – supporters of Infante Carlos and his descendants – fought to promote Spanish tradition and Catholicism against the liberalism of successive Spanish governments. The Carlists attempted to restore the historic liberties and broad regional autonomy granted to the <b>Basque</b> <b>Country</b> and Catalonia by their fueros (regional charters). At times they allied with nationalists (separate from the National Faction {{during the civil war}} itself), including during the Carlist Wars.|$|E
50|$|In 1999, {{together}} with Basque intellectuals such as Fernando Savater, citizens and politicians, she {{took part in}} the founding of ¡Basta Ya!.

5000|$|According to the Minister of Grace and Justice Lorenzo de Arrazola {{the phrase}} meant [...] "unity {{in all the}} big bonds", but would involve for {{instance}} {{the establishment of a}} Spanish governmental deputy in each district, as well as leaving lesser matters to the different Basque institutions. The wording was regarded by the pro-fueros personalities as being at odds with the authority of the <b>Basque</b> <b>Country's</b> own constitutional foundations, an oxymoron.|$|R
50|$|In 1932, a <b>Basque</b> <b>Country's</b> {{separate}} statute {{failed to}} take off over disagreements on the centrality of Catholicism, a scene of political radicalization ensued dividing the leftist and rightist forces during the 2nd Spanish Republic (1931-1939). Thousands of landless labourers occupied properties of wealthy landowners in October 1933, leaving the latter eager for revenge. The most reactionary and clerical Carlists came to prominence, ideologues such as Víctor Pradera, and an understanding with General Mola paved {{the way to the}} Spanish Nationalist uprising in Pamplona (18 July 1936).|$|R
