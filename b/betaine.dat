25|$|The major {{limitation}} of the traditional Wittig reaction is that the reaction proceeds mainly via the erythro <b>betaine</b> intermediate, {{which leads to the}} Z-alkene. The erythro <b>betaine</b> can be converted to the threo <b>betaine</b> using phenyllithium at low temperature. This modification affords the E-alkene.|$|E
25|$|The {{addition}} of <b>betaine</b> to polymerase chain reactions improves the amplification of DNA {{by reducing the}} formation of secondary structure in GC-rich regions.

25|$|In {{biological}} systems, many {{naturally occurring}} <b>betaines</b> serve as organic osmolytes, substances synthesized or taken {{up from the}} environment by cells for protection against osmotic stress, drought, high salinity or high temperature. Intracellular accumulation of <b>betaines,</b> non-perturbing to enzyme function, protein structure and membrane integrity, permits water retention in cells, thus protecting {{from the effects of}} dehydration.

40|$|A {{new series}} of {{conjugated}} mesomeric <b>betaines</b> have been synthesized from the reaction of various aminoheterocycles with 2 -methylthio- 4 -oxo- 3 -phenylpyrido[2, 1 -φ][1, 2, 4]triazinium iodide, itself prepared from 2 -ethoxycarbonylpyridinium N-aminide. Some of the heterobetaines and salts obtained have been studied by 1 H-NMR, and their structures have been confirmed by X-ray analysis. The crystal structures reveal unexpected complementary stabilizing interactions between some <b>betaines</b> and their salts.

25|$|The {{original}} <b>betaine,</b> N,N,N-trimethylglycine, {{was named}} after its discovery in sugar beet (Beta vulgaris subsp. vulgaris) in the 19th century. It is a small N-trimethylated amino acid, existing in zwitterionic form at neutral pH. This substance is now often called glycine <b>betaine</b> to distinguish it from other betaines that are widely distributed in microorganisms, plants and animals.|$|E

40|$|<b>Betaines</b> {{and similar}} {{zwitterionic}} compounds are widely distributed in terrestrial plants and algae, {{as well as}} in marine invertebrates. In biological systems, these highly soluble dipolar molecules serve as organic osmolytes (osmoprotectants). Example of <b>betaines</b> isolated from marine invertebrates are homarine, nor- and aminozooanemonin, pyridinebetaines A and B. Most of these compounds are amphoteric low-molecular weight quaternary ammonium compounds deriving from proteinogenic or non- proteinogenic amino acids in which the nitrogen atom is fully methylated. Within a recent investigation of alkaloids from Axinella sponges, we have examined specimens of Axinella polypoides collected along Sardinian coasts and we have isolated three novel unique compounds, polyaxibetaines A-C (1 - 3), whose structure elucidations are the subjects of this paper...|$|R
25|$|Carbon-carbon bond {{rotation}} {{gives the}} <b>betaine</b> 4, which then forms the oxaphosphetane 5. Elimination gives the desired Z-alkene 7 and triphenylphosphine oxide 6. With simple Wittig reagents, {{the first step}} occurs easily with both aldehydes and ketones, and the decomposition of the <b>betaine</b> (to form 5) is the rate-determining step. However, with stabilised ylides (where R1 stabilises the negative charge) {{the first step is}} the slowest step, so the overall rate of alkene formation decreases and a bigger proportion of the alkene product is the E-isomer. This also explains why stabilised reagents fail to react well with sterically hindered ketones.|$|E
25|$|Choline and its {{metabolites}} {{are needed}} for three main physiological purposes: structural integrity and signaling roles for cell membranes, cholinergic neurotransmission (acetylcholine synthesis), and a major source for methyl groups via its metabolite, trimethylglycine (<b>betaine),</b> which participates in the S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) synthesis pathways.|$|E

40|$|Polymeric <b>betaines</b> gain {{considerable}} attention for their interesting solution properties, {{but even more}} so, for their favorable bio- and haemocompatible properties. When incorporated into materials or used as surface coatings, some of these zwitterionic polymers strongly resist protein absorption due to their hygroscopic nature, making <b>betaines</b> promising candidates for medical diagnostics, drug delivery, and tissue engineering applications. This dissertation introduces novel norbornene-based polybetaines as foundational materials for biological applications, including non-fouling coatings and antimicrobial macromolecules. Sulfo- and carboxybetaines, composed of backbones that do not contain hydrolyzable units under physiological conditions, {{as well as new}} polymers that carry a dual functionality at the repeat unit level, coupling a zwitterionic functionality with an alkyl moiety varied to adjust the amphiphilicity of the overall system, are introduced. How structural changes, backbone chemistry, hydrophilicity/amphiphilicity, and coating surface roughness impact their non-fouling properties is investigated. ...|$|R
50|$|Mesoionic {{compounds}} are dipolar five membered heterocyclic {{compounds in}} which both the negative and the positive charges are delocalized. A completely uncharged structure cannot be written and mesoionic compounds cannot be represented satisfactorily by any one mesomeric structure. Mesoionic compounds are a subclass of <b>betaines.</b> Examples are sydnones and sydnone imines (e.g. the stimulant mesocarb), münchnones. and mesoionic carbenes.|$|R
25|$|To begin with, {{methionine}} can {{be formed}} two ways, either from methyl groups derived from folate, or from methyl groups derived from <b>betaine</b> (which gets its methyl groups from choline). Changes {{in one of}} these pathways is compensated for by the other, and if these pathways do not adequately supply methyl groups to produce methionine, the precursor to methionine, homocysteine, rises.|$|E
25|$|Phenazines are redox-active {{pigments}} {{produced by}} P. aeruginosa. These pigments {{are involved in}} quorum sensing, virulence, and iron acquisition. P. aeruginosa produces several pigments all produced via a biosynthetic pathway. Pyocyanin, 1-Hydroxyphenazine, Phenazine-1-Carboxamide, 5-methylphenazine-1-carboxylic acid <b>betaine,</b> and Aeruginosin A. Two operons are involved in phenazine biosynthesis: phzA1B1C1D1E1F1G1 and phzA2B2C2D2E2F2G2. These operons convert a chorismic acid to the phenazines mentioned above. Three key genes, phzH, phzM, and phzS convert phenazine-1-carboxylic acid to the phenazines mentioned above. Though phenazine biosynthesis is well studied, questions remain as to the final structure of the brown phenazine pyomelanin.|$|E
25|$|The {{second class}} of {{non-toxic}} anti-fouling coatings are hydrophilic coatings. They rely on high amounts of hydration {{in order to}} increase the energetic penalty of removing water for proteins and microorganisms to attach. The most common examples of these coatings are based on highly hydrated zwitterions, such as glycine <b>betaine</b> and sulfobetaine. These coatings are also low-friction, but are considered by some to be superior to hydrophobic surfaces because they prevent bacteria attachment, preventing biofilm formation. These coatings are not yet commercially available and are being designed {{as part of a larger}} effort by the Office of Naval Research to develop environmentally safe biomimetic ship coatings.|$|E

40|$|N-Heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) form stable {{zwitterionic}} adducts with a {{range of}} heteroallenes, ketenes, and allenes. Although the first representatives of this class of inner salts were first investigated {{as far back as the}} 1960 s, they have enjoyed a sustained interest from the chemical community over the years. Depending on the nature of their anionic moiety, NHC <b>betaines</b> display a very broad palette of reactivities and have found applications in various fields of organic synthesis and catalysis. In this Microreview, the synthesis, properties, and reactivity of NHC <b>betaines</b> are surveyed. The NHCs under consideration include ylidenes derived from imidazole, benzimidazole, imidazoline, thiazole, or triazole, and the heteroallenes investigated so far are carbon dioxide, carbon disulfide, isocyanates, isothiocyanates, and their selenium analogues. A historical background is provided for each type of adduct under consideration, but emphasis is placed mainly on developments that have appeared in the literature within the past few years.

2500|$|A <b>betaine</b> (BEET-ah-een, [...] ) in {{chemistry}} is any neutral chemical compound with a positively charged cationic functional group {{such as a}} quaternary ammonium or phosphonium cation (generally: onium ions) which bears no hydrogen atom and with a negatively charged functional group such as a carboxylate group {{which may not be}} adjacent to the cationic site. A <b>betaine</b> thus may be a specific type of zwitterion. Historically the term was reserved for TMG (trimethylglycine) only.

50|$|Many zwitterions contain {{quaternary}} ammonium cations. Since it lacks N-H bonds, the ammonium center cannot participate in tautomerization. Zwitterions containing quaternary-ammonium centers {{are common in}} biology, a common example are the <b>betaines,</b> which serve as electrolytes in fish. The membrane-forming phospholipids are also commonly zwitterions.

In this state the cytosol and osmoprotectants become a glass-like solid that helps stabilize proteins and cell membranes from the damaging effects of desiccation.|$|R
