Based on a recommendation by the International Monetary Fund to establish an integrated financial supervisory body, the National Assembly passed the bill on December 29, 1997. On April 1, 1998, the Financial Supervisory Commission (the predecessor to the Financial Services Commission) was launched as the FSS’s supreme decision-making body, {{laying the groundwork for}} the consolidation of the four supervisory bodies (the <b>Banking</b> <b>Supervisory</b> <b>Authority,</b> Securities Supervisory Board, Insurance Supervisory Board, and the Non-bank Deposit Insurance Corporation.

The draft has the following core elements: 1. Banks (or financial holdings or their subsidiaries) may establish a special purpose vehicle (SPV) to which they can transfer structured assets – such as asset backed securities (ABS), collateral debt obligations (CDO) or collateralized loan obligations (CLO). These assets must have been acquired before Jan. 1, 2009. 2. In exchange, the transferring bank (from now on just “bank”) receives securities of the SPV which are guaranteed by the German state through the Financial Market Stabilisation Fund (“SoFFin”). The bank pays a guarantee fee to SoFFin. 3. As a rule, the transfer of assets is {{made on the basis}} of 90 per cent of the book value in the bank’s balance sheet. 4.

40|$|Formulating {{international}} standards on banking supervision {{is one of}} the most important topics of international financial law. The recent international financial crisis is another striking example on the significance and relevance of this subject. This thesis attempts to evaluate the impact of {{international standards}} of banking supervision aimed at the creation of a "safe and sound" banking system on Jordanian legislation at two levels: to what extent international standards set out by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision ("BCBS") have influenced Jordanian law; and how these standards can assist in improving the Jordanian law as well as direct new policy reforms. The first finding of the thesis is that Jordanian law is significantly compliant with international standards. The second main finding is that soft law, as opposed to hard law, is the optimal form of setting international banking supervisory standards. The thesis also finds that the BCBS standards do not provide adequate guidance on the structure of the <b>banking</b> <b>supervisory</b> <b>authority.</b> The thesis concludes with recommendations on how to enhance international banking supervisory standards as well as the structure and substantive law of banking supervision in Jordan in light of international standards and with occasional reference to the UK Law.

40|$|Abstract: Ongoing {{changes in}} the {{structure}} and nature of banking, as well as banking crises across the globe have focused the attention of policy makers on the appropriate structure, scope, and degree of independence of banking supervision. Key issues for banking supervision structure are whether there should be one or multiple <b>supervisory</b> <b>authorities,</b> and whether the central bank {{should be involved in}} bank supervision. The issue pertaining to the scope of supervision is whether <b>bank</b> <b>supervisory</b> <b>authorities</b> should supervise other financial service industries, including in particular securities and insurance. Finally, the issue regarding the independence of <b>supervisory</b> <b>authorities</b> {{is the degree to which}} bank supervisors should be subject to political and economic policy pressure and influence. How these issues are addressed is important, because policies that fail to provide for an appropriate <b>bank</b> <b>supervisory</b> framework may undermine bank performance and even lead to full-scale banking crises. The intense interest policy makers have shown in these issues has not been matched, however, by researchers. In particular, there is very little systematic empirical evidence on how, or indeed whether, the structure, scope, or independence of bank supervision affects the banking industry. This paper addresses this gap in three respects. First, drawing on the existing literature, w...|$|R
