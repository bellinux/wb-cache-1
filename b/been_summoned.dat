5|$|The Privy Council {{is one of}} {{the four}} {{principal}} councils of the sovereign. The other three are the courts of law, the Commune Concilium (Common Council, or Parliament) and the Magnum Concilium (Great Council, or the assembly of all the Peers of the Realm). All are still in existence, or at least have never been formally abolished, but the Magnum Concilium has not <b>been</b> <b>summoned</b> since 1640 and was considered defunct even then.|$|E
5|$|Globocnik and I {{were talking}} about Operation Reinhard, which was in full effect {{following}} Heydrich's murder, and also the construction of Sobibor and Treblinka. I know I asked him about Höss, who was also standing there and had <b>been</b> <b>summoned</b> by Himmler regarding logistics or something regarding the new camp (Auschwitz). Then Globocnik mentioned to me and Kaltenbrunner that Lidice had been cleared, and all the Jews and Czechs had been dealt with. I noticed that this young pilot, who I later learned was Marseille, must have overheard, and I debated whether I should go over and say something to him. I decided against it.|$|E
5|$|The Federation {{starship}} Enterprise {{arrives at}} the planet Haven, where the ship's Betazoid Counselor Deanna Troi has <b>been</b> <b>summoned</b> by her mother Lwaxana. Troi had previously been set into an arranged marriage to the young human doctor, Wyatt Miller (Robert Knepper), and his parents have since tracked down Lwaxana to enforce the marriage. After Lwaxana and the Millers are welcomed aboard the Enterprise, the parents argue over whose cultural traditions will be honored at the ceremony. Troi and Wyatt attempt {{to get to know}} each other but find it difficult, as Troi is still in love with Commander William Riker (Jonathan Frakes). Wyatt has had numerous dreams of another woman with whom he has fallen in love, and had initially believed her to be Troi communicating telepathically with him.|$|E
50|$|A {{powerful}} summon {{that appears}} as a black-winged ghoul wielding a large sword. Wraiths specialized in fighting infantry, as a few attacks can destroy entire troops. They move slightly slower than infantry, making them vulnerable to fast-moving knights; however, their attacks deal significant damage to knights as well. Only one may <b>be</b> <b>summoned</b> at a time. Requires 50 crystals to <b>be</b> <b>summoned</b> and <b>are</b> <b>summoned</b> from a Gates of Hades.|$|R
50|$|He <b>was</b> <b>summoned</b> to Parliament on 15 December 1357, by writs {{directed}} to Gerardo de Insula or de L'Isle, whereby he is held {{to have become}} Baron Lisle. He <b>was</b> <b>summoned</b> to a Council 20 June 1358.|$|R
5000|$|He {{married a}} woman named Elizabeth. [...] He <b>was</b> <b>summoned</b> to Parliament in 1400, and died on 4 August 1401. [...] Any {{hereditary}} title later held to have <b>been</b> created by <b>summons</b> to Parliament would have passed to his son, Philip le Despenser, though none of his descendants <b>were</b> <b>summoned</b> as Barons le Despencer.|$|R
5|$|The {{removal of}} the sword from the coinage hub, which had already been {{produced}} by reduction from the plaster models, was accomplished by painstaking work by Mint Chief Engraver Morgan, using extremely fine engraving tools under magnification. Morgan did the work on December 23 {{in the presence of}} de Francisci, who had <b>been</b> <b>summoned</b> to the Philadelphia Mint to ensure the work met with his approval. It was insufficient merely to remove the sword, {{as the rest of the}} design had to be adjusted. Morgan had to hide the excision; he did so by extending the olive branch, previously half-hidden by the sword, but had to remove a small length of stem that showed to the left of the eagle's talons. Morgan also strengthened the rays, and sharpened the appearance of the eagle's leg. The chief engraver did his work with such skill that the work on the dollar was not known for over 85years.|$|E
5|$|Edward IV died {{suddenly}} in April 1483, leaving his young son, Edward his heir and the Duke of Gloucester Lord Protector {{of the new}} king and the country. Although he had <b>been</b> <b>summoned</b> to the parliament of January 1483, {{it is unlikely that}} Suffolk was in attendance at court at the time. Nor did he attend the dead king's funeral or interment. By July, the young king had been declared illegitimate; Suffolk was at Westminster Hall on 26 June 1483 when Gloucester claimed the throne, and he carried the royal sceptre at Richard's coronation. Suffolk's son, the Earl of Lincoln, was named as Richard III's heir to the throne when the king's own son, Edward of Middleham died in 1484. However, Suffolk did lose the Constableship of Wallinford and the Chiltern Hundreds to Lovell. In fact, Suffolk seems to have been no more favoured by Richard than he had been by Edward. In December 1483 Suffolk was summoned to the parliament which confirmed Richrd III's right to the throne, and the following year he undertook commissions of array in both Norfolk and Suffolk, as well as being part of the oyer and terminer which condemned the treasons of William Collingbourne in London.|$|E
5|$|In the 5th century, {{after the}} {{withdrawal}} of the Roman legions, Saint Illtud came to the Hodnant valley from Brittany and founded the monastery of Illtud on the Ogney Brook, and a college, close to the current St Illtyd's Church, about a mile from the sea. The exact date of its founding is unknown, but some sources indicate around the year 500; the blue plaque on the church today also gives this date. Because of its monastery and teaching centre it became a major centre for education and Celtic Church evangelism, attracting scholars from across Wales, Devon, Cornwall and Brittany and the wider world. The college of Llantwit, known as the College or Seminary of Theodosius (Cor Tewdws in Welsh) or College of St. Illtyd, at its peak reputedly had seven halls, over 400 houses and over 2000 students, including seven sons of British princes, and scholars such as St. Patrick, St. Paul Aurelian, the bard Taliesin, Gildas the historian, Samson of Dol, Paulinus, Bishop of Leon; St. David is believed to have spent some time there. Samson was known to have <b>been</b> <b>summoned</b> by Dyfrig to join the monastery in 521 and he was briefly elected abbot before leaving for Cornwall. King Hywel ap Rhys (d. 886) was buried at the monastery.|$|E
5000|$|He <b>was</b> <b>summoned</b> to Parliament from 1295 to 1307 [...] The king demanded his {{presence}} at the English victory over the Scots at the Battle of Falkirk. His younger grandson Roger de Grey <b>was</b> <b>summoned</b> to Parliament thus becoming Baron Grey de Ruthyn.|$|R
50|$|Later in 1322 he <b>was</b> <b>summoned</b> {{to serve}} against the Scots and against Lancaster's rebels. He <b>was</b> <b>summoned</b> to defend Aquitane in 1324, which was lost under the poor {{leadership}} of Hugh le Despenser, 1st Earl of Winchester, {{and to go}} to Gascony in 1325.|$|R
50|$|Two {{members of}} his family <b>were</b> <b>summoned</b> and sat in Parliament in his lifetime: his eldest son, another William, and his nephew Thomas. The younger Sir William Latimer <b>was</b> <b>summoned</b> to, and sat in, the Parliament of Candlemas, 1299, ten months before his father, and {{continued}} to <b>be</b> <b>summoned</b> {{for the rest of his}} life. By modern law, this would create a separate Barony of Latimer, although the two have been held by the same people since the elder Sir William's death in 1305.|$|R
5|$|The New Laws {{were finally}} {{repealed}} on October 20, 1545, and riots broke out against Las Casas, with shots being fired against him by angry colonists. After a year {{he had made}} himself so unpopular among the Spaniards of the area {{that he had to}} leave. Having <b>been</b> <b>summoned</b> to a meeting among the bishops of New Spain to be held in Mexico City on January 12, 1546, he left his diocese, never to return. At the meeting, probably after lengthy reflection, and realizing that the New Laws were lost in Mexico, Las Casas presented a moderated view on the problems of confession and restitution of property, Archbishop Juan de Zumárraga of Mexico and Bishop Julián Garcés of Puebla agreed completely with his new moderate stance, Bishop Vasco de Quiroga of Michoacán had minor reservations, and Bishops Francisco Marroquín of Guatemala and Juan Lopez de Zárate of Oaxaca did not object. This resulted in a new resolution to be presented to viceroy Mendoza. His last act as Bishop of Chiapas was writing a confesionario, a manual for the administration of the sacrament of confession in his diocese, still refusing absolution to unrepentant encomenderos. Las Casas appointed a vicar for his diocese and set out for Europe in December 1546, arriving in Lisbon in April 1547 and in Spain on November 1547.|$|E

50|$|In 1324, Sir Ralph de Cobham <b>was</b> <b>summoned</b> to {{parliament}} as Baron Cobham, {{but this}} creation became extinct roughly {{a year later}} on his death. In 1326, Sir Stephen de Cobham <b>was</b> <b>summoned</b> to parliament, again as Baron Cobham. This Cobham came from Rundale, and was apparently of no relation to Sir Ralph. This creation became abeyant no later than 1429. A further creation came in 1342, when Reginald de Cobham <b>was</b> <b>summoned</b> to parliament. However, this creation became extinct {{on the death of}} the second baron in 1403.|$|R

25|$|In June 1459 a Great Council {{was summoned}} to meet at Coventry. York, the Nevilles and some other lords refused to appear, fearing that the armed forces that had been {{commanded}} to assemble the previous month had <b>been</b> <b>summoned</b> to arrest them. Instead, York and Salisbury recruited in their strongholds and met Warwick, who had brought with him his troops from Calais, at Worcester. Parliament {{was summoned to}} meet at Coventry in November, but without York and the Nevilles. This could only mean {{that they were to}} be accused of treason.|$|E
