5|$|The {{reason for}} the Czech {{invasion}} in 1919 was primarily the organisation of elections to the Sejm (parliament) of Poland in the disputed area. The elections were to <b>be</b> <b>held</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> whole of Cieszyn Silesia. The Czechs claimed that the polls must not <b>be</b> <b>held</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> disputed area as the delimitation was only interim and no sovereign rule should be executed there by any party. When the Czech demand {{was rejected by the}} Poles, the Czechs decided to resolve the issue by force.|$|E

Guthrie increased oversight of Treasury employees and tariff collectors, {{many of whom}} were withholding money from the government.

Guthrie reclaimed these funds and sought to prosecute corrupt officials, with mixed success.|$|E

5|$|All {{apprentices}} were to {{be educated}} in reading, writing and arithmetic {{for the first four}} years of their apprenticeship. The Act specified that this should be done every working day within usual working hours but did not state how much time should be set aside for it. Educational classes should be held {{in a part of the}} mill or factory designed for the purpose. Every Sunday, for one hour, apprentices {{were to be}} taught the Christian religion; every other Sunday, a divine service should <b>be</b> <b>held</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> factory, and every month the apprentices should visit a church. They should be prepared for confirmation in the Church of England between the ages of 14 and 18 and must be examined by a clergyman at least once a year.

5|$|Although the 2012 Olympic men's {{basketball}} tournament was then {{more than a}} year away, qualifying tournaments in all five of FIBA's continental zones were to <b>be</b> <b>held</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Northern Hemisphere summer of 2011 (the traditional basketball offseason throughout the world). The lockout resulted in the suspension of an agreement between the NBA and FIBA by which the NBA would take on most of the costs for insuring the value of its players' contracts in the event they were injured during international competition. As a result, national federations that wish to have NBA players on their squads must now provide full coverage instead of supplemental insurance.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, the Sugar Bowl {{was held}} {{under the rules}} of the Bowl Alliance. The Alliance, {{predecessor}} to the modern Bowl Championship Series, was intended to match the champions of the Southeastern Conference, Big East Conference, Atlantic Coast Conference, Big 12, Southwest Conference, and one at-large team against each other in the Sugar Bowl, Orange Bowl, and Fiesta Bowl. Each year, the two highest-ranked teams would play in a National Championship Game held in place of one of the bowl games. The site of the national championship game rotated among the three bowl games, as did the date of each game. Following the 1995 college football season, the Sugar Bowl was designated for December 31, marking the first time two Sugar Bowls would <b>be</b> <b>held</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same calendar year.|$|E
5|$|In January 1999, President Bill Clinton eased travel {{restrictions}} and increased cultural exchange between the United States and Cuba, leading Angelos to again seek permission {{to play an}} exhibition game in Cuba. Angelos met with Sandy Berger, Clinton's National Security Advisor, to discuss a potential exhibition. Bud Selig, the MLB Commissioner, allowed for {{the exploration of the}} series, though it still required the approval of MLB owners and the MLBPA. The MLBPA insisted on a second game to <b>be</b> <b>held</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States.

5|$|In January 2008, city {{officials}} {{announced that the}} Peachtree Road Race, Atlanta Pride Festival, the Atlanta Jazz Festival, and the Dogwood Festival would not <b>be</b> <b>held</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> park due to extreme drought. Some festivals which don't make use of green space were still allowed in the park. The Atlanta Arts Festival ran from September 12–14, 2008, and utilized only paved areas. Other festivals were temporarily moved to alternate venues, such as Centennial Olympic Park. The drought in Atlanta ended by late 2009. In 2010, several events returned to Piedmont Park, including the Dogwood Festival, the Jazz Festival, and Screen on the Green.|$|E
5|$|In Pune, {{where the}} {{construction}} industry was badly hit, some local organisations, working for porters, construction workers and casual labourers, {{tried to stop the}} exodus. These organisations set up a National Integration Committee (NIC) and charted out confidence-building measures among the migrants in the city. One of the resolutions passed at the meeting was to encourage participation of the North Indians in all festivities in the near future. In fact, ninety percent of the labour force in Pune consists of migrants; 60percent of these come from Bihar and UP. It was also feared that the stoppage of construction activities would adversely affect the plans of hosting certain events of the 2008 Commonwealth Youth Games to <b>be</b> <b>held</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> city.|$|E
5|$|On 10 April 2005 an {{aftershock}} measuring 6.7 on the Richter scale {{struck the}} west coast of Sumatra two weeks after a larger earthquake struck Nias. This caused crackage to the columns supporting the mosque's roof. Three years later, the Ganting Grand Mosque was one of 608 places of worship severely damaged when another large earthquake struck the area on 30 September 2009. The earthquake collapsed part of the mosque's façade and caused severe structural damage to the interior columns; as a result, the community feared that the mosque would collapse. Before renovations were completed in 2010, prayers had to <b>be</b> <b>held</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> yard. In 2011 the Ganting Grand Mosque was listed as one of Indonesia's 100 most beautiful mosques in a book compiled by Andalan Media. The only other mosque from West Sumatra included was Raya Bayur Mosque, Agam Regency.|$|E

5|$|On {{the morning}} of 14 July around 900 people formed outside the Bastille, {{primarily}} working-class members of the nearby faubourg Saint-Antoine, but also including some mutinous soldiers and local traders. The crowd had gathered {{in an attempt to}} commandeer the gunpowder stocks known to <b>be</b> <b>held</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Bastille, and at 10:00 am de Launay let in two of their leaders to negotiate with him. Just after midday, another negotiator was let in to discuss the situation, but no compromise could be reached: the revolutionary representatives now wanted both the guns and the gunpowder in the Bastille to be handed over, but de Launay refused to do so unless he received authorisation from his leadership in Versailles. By this point {{it was clear that the}} governor lacked the experience or the skills to defuse the situation.|$|E
5|$|Rio de Janeiro {{planned to}} {{organize}} the Games {{at a cost of}} USD 14.4billion, being able to hold all sport events (excepting football) inside the city. There will be 30 competition venues in four Olympic zones—Barra, Copacabana, Deodoro, and Maracanã—apart from venues for golf and rugby union, which were added to the Olympic program after the election. Football matches will <b>be</b> <b>held</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cities of Belo Horizonte, Brasília, Salvador and São Paulo. The proposed dates range from August 5 to 21 for the Olympic Games, and September 7 to 18 for the Paralympic Games.|$|E
5|$|The British {{decision}} to strike Kaafjord {{was motivated by}} fears that the battleship, upon re-entering service, would attack strategically important convoys carrying supplies to the Soviet Union. Removing {{the threat posed by}} Tirpitz would also allow the Allies to redeploy the capital ships which had to <b>be</b> <b>held</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> North Sea to counter her. After four months of training and preparations, the British Home Fleet sailed on 30 March 1944 and aircraft launched from five aircraft carriers struck Kaafjord on 3 April. The raid achieved surprise, and the British aircraft met little opposition. Fifteen bombs hit the battleship, and strafing by fighter aircraft inflicted heavy casualties on her gun crews. Four British aircraft and nine airmen were lost during the operation.|$|E
