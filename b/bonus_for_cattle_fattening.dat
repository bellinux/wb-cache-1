40|$|Beef cattle {{have high}} market demand in Vietnam and the Dak Lak local {{government}} encourages {{the development of}} beef value chains. Household surveys were carried out in Cu Jut and Ea Kar districts and farming systems and production specialization were found to differ in each district. Ea Kar farmers were more specialized in livestock production while Cu Jut farmers were more focused on cash crop production. The FarmDESIGN bio-economic model allowed us to study two representative farms, one from Ea Kar and one from Cu Jut district. The Ea Kar farm had a more integrated livestock production system, providing manure to the fields that produced feed for the livestock. Both farms had high farm-level nitrogen balances due to high feed and fertilizer imports. The soil organic matter (SOM) balance in Cu Jut was negative (- 48 kg/ha) because of its manure management strategy. On both farms, the residues {{were removed from the}} fields, providing no input to SOM and were fed to livestock (Ea Kar) or burnt (Cu Jut). Livestock intensification scenarios that were implemented for the Ea Kar case study farm showed two possible pathways – forage-based and grain-based <b>cattle</b> <b>fattening.</b> Both strategies could lead to higher operating profits (+ 35 % <b>for</b> forage-based <b>cattle</b> <b>fattening</b> and + 59 % <b>for</b> grain-based <b>cattle</b> <b>fattening)</b> and lower labor demands if they were skillfully implemented for the latter scenario. However, grain-based fattening negatively affected SOM balance, in contrast to forage-based fattening. The optimization of the current Ea Kar farm with FarmDESIGN indicated that there are options to change the farm setup in order to increase profitability and reduce family labor demands. However there are some trade-offs to consider. If reducing environmental impact is a priority, there are alternative farm configurations that will produce lower greenhouse gas emissions while increasing SOM and increasing overall farm profitability. These should be assessed along with the farmers’ interests and priorities. Quantitative farm modeling of complex mixed farming systems can assess potential impact and support decision-making, targeting, prioritization and program design for sustainable intensification of livestock systems...|$|R

Results: As expected, the main isoforms involved in PB induction were CYP 2 B, CYP 2 C and CYP 3 A, showing 1. 5 to 15 fold increase in enzyme activity and 2 to 3 fold increase in protein levels. Incubations with 17 β-Bol revealed ADD as the major biotransformation product in both C and PB subfractions. Moreover, three hydroxylated metabolites (OH-Bol) were identified {{and the amount of}} one of them was 4 times higher in PB than in C group.

This study, which objective was to find out the socio-economic factors that may affect the usage of these resources, permitted to show, through interviews and surveys, that more than 8, 200 t of agro-industrial by-products (maize and wheat bran, soybean seed and maize seed cake) useable <b>for</b> <b>cattle</b> feeding were produced annually in Adamawa and that only 16 % of this production were used by livestock farmers. Among the {{factors affecting}} the effective use of these by-products, prices were the most determinant. The herds size and the number of sedentary animals had also shown a significant positive effect. On the other hand, livestock farming experience and the farmer’s age had instead shown a strong negative correlation with the use of by-products; same was the level of farmer’s education which showed positive correlation only with respect to cotton seed cake use. The distance from the livestock farming sites to the by-products production/distribution centre and/or difficult access to the sites had strong positive correlations with the by-products’ prices. The problem of supplies as a result of long distance or of difficult access to cattle production sites, the high and unstable prices of agro-industrial by-products and poor awareness of the different types of by-products produced in the Adamawa, were noted as major constraints for their use as cattle feed.

40|$|The {{study was}} carried out in Bonke Woreda of Gamo Gofa Zone, {{southern}} Ethiopia, with the objectives of assessment of fattening and marketing system, and effect of concentrate supplementation with locally available feeds on fattening performance of indigenous cattle. The study involved survey to assess <b>cattle</b> <b>fattening</b> and marketing practices, and action research to evaluate the effect of homemade concentrate from locally available feed resources on fattening performance and economic return of indigenous cattle. The survey part involved interviewing 120 households purposively selected from six kebeles in three agro ecologies. Focus group discussions and key informants have been employed to enrich the data. The feeding trial was conducted in Danible Ottora Kebele,with 18 (9 castrate and 9 non – castrate) indigenous <b>cattle</b> <b>for</b> 70 days excluding adaptation period of 15 days. Treatments included farmer’s practices alone (T 1); T 1 + concentrate supplementation at 1 % of body weight (T 2); and T 1 + concentrate supplementation at 1. 5 % of body weight (T 3). Maize stover and stubble grazing was provided as a basic ration which was the farmers feeding practice. Experimental animals were blocked by farms/households and randomly assigned to three feeding treatments separately. Heart girth and body condition score were recorded while body weight was estimated from heart girth using regression equation developed <b>for</b> zebu <b>cattle.</b> The data were analyzed using the General Linear Model Procedure of statistical package for Social Science (SPSS 16). The result showed that the most dominant <b>cattle</b> breed used <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> in the study area was indigenous. The major source of <b>cattle</b> <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> was through purchasing from market (69. 1 %) followed by raising at home (24. 2 %). Almost all fatteners in highland (95 %) and mid-altitude (100 %) were engaged in fattening castrate. Concerning physiological stage of the fattening animals, most of the producers (83 %) use matured & old oxen. In highland, majority of the farmers <b>fatten</b> <b>cattle</b> once within a year (60 %), while it was three times per year for mid-altitude (42. 5 %) and two times per year for lowland (70 %) agro-ecologies. The majority (90 %) {{of the respondents indicated that}} the most common criteria used to decide fattening period was body condition of the animals. Majority of the respondents in the highland, mid altitude and lowland <b>fatten</b> <b>cattle</b> <b>for</b> six months, three months and five months, respectively. The major types of feed resources for the fattening animal were natural pasture, crop residues, stubble grazing, grass hay and feed supplements. The major criteria used while purchasing <b>fattening</b> <b>cattle</b> included frame size, heath, body condition, coat color and price of animals. The experience in <b>cattle</b> <b>fattening,</b> large <b>cattle</b> population, diverse & suitable agroecology, availability of crop residues, high irrigation potential, initiation of the introduction of improved forage species and cheap labor force reveals the potential of the area <b>for</b> improved <b>cattle</b> <b>fattening.</b> However, feed shortage, shortage of land, prevalence of disease, poor access for credit service and marketing information, and underdeveloped cattle marketing were the major constraints that hinder the performance of <b>cattle</b> <b>fattening.</b> The feeding trial showed that average daily gain were highest (p< 0. 05) for animals supplemented with T 3 followed by T 2 and T 1. Similarly, the net return was higher (P< 0. 05) for the supplemented group (T 2 & T 3) compared to non-supplemented group kept under farmers management (T 1). Among the supplemented groups, marginal rate of return was higher for animals supplemented with T 2 compared to T 3. Thus, it can be concluded that when resources are not meager smallholders producers could use supplementation at 1. 5 % of body weight for higher return. However, when resources are limited producers are advised to supplement at 1 % of body weight for higher marginal rate of return. Detail research work on availability, nutrient composition and digestibility of the major feed resource are recommended for further work. Global Affairs Canad...|$|R

Parameters measured included: area of rice paddy where sesbania could be planted; forage establishment, harvesting and feeding practices; cattle purchases and sales; and monthly liveweight gain. Farmers planted an average of 406 sesbania trees on bunds surrounding 0. 6 ha of rice paddy. The median values for the main forages fed (dry matter offered) were harvested elephant grass (78 % of diet), sesbania (12 % of diet) and other feeds (mainly rice bran) (5 % of diet). Sesbania was harvested by lopping the lower side branches of similar to 6 trees per bull per day and never completely defoliating single trees. The farmers fattened an average of 1. 6 bulls at a time achieving a yearly mean liveweight gain of 0. 41 kg/bull. day. New bulls were purchased with an average liveweight of 203 kg while the average sale weight was 260 kg. Purchase and sale prices were high at A$ 3. 27 and A$ 3. 29, respectively, while the average fattening period was 5 months. Bull liveweight gains were related to total amount of forage fed. No direct statistically significant link between liveweight gains and amount of sesbania fed was obtained due to the multiple factors that influenced forage and bull management.

The beef <b>cattle</b> <b>fattening</b> in Indonesia is financially and economically beneficial, {{even though the}} production process is in an economical condition with various trading policies with others countries. Those including the policies of import tarrif and quota on input that are aimed {{to have a more}} expensive price of import input, hence giving the chance for domestic input to compete. These will be an advantage for domestic feedloter, however the result of governmental policy are often far from expectation. Research conducted in West Java. This research used the survey method, with multistage random sampling and analyzed by using the Policy Analysis Matrix model to measure the efficiency of the business performance of beef <b>cattle</b> <b>fattening.</b> Result of the research shows that beef <b>cattle</b> <b>fattening</b> reached financial and economical benefits. Feedloters of local and imported cows in west Java has competitive advantage, local cows is more competitive than imported cows.

40|$|The study {{investigated}} the factors affecting Agro-pastoralists and Pastoralists willingness to adopt beef <b>cattle</b> <b>fattening</b> technology in Shinyanga and Mwanza regions of the lake zone in Tanzania. Data were collected from Agro-pastoralist and Pastoralist using structured questionnaire administered to 401 randomly selected cattle keepers. Eight districts were involved; five in Shinyanga region (Kahama, Kishapu, Meatu, Bariadi, Maswa) and three in Mwanza region (Nyamagana, Sengerema, Magu). Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and binary logistic regression model. Results from this analysis indicate that 93. 5 % {{of the respondents were}} willing to <b>fatten</b> their <b>cattle</b> if given an opportunity, while 14. 7 % had already started to <b>fatten</b> their <b>cattle</b> ranging from 30 to 100 animals per fattening cycle of three to four months. The results further indicated that the major factors influencing adoption of beef <b>cattle</b> <b>fattening</b> were marital status (p< 0. 1), awareness (p< 0. 05) and attitude towards the technology (p< 0. 01). Being married and being aware of the fattening technology increased the likelihood of adoption by 6. 3 % and 11. 3 % respectively. Mean while, a one unit change in attitude towards beef <b>cattle</b> <b>fattening</b> increased the likelihood of adoption by 0. 3 %.

This supplement contains soya bean meal (SBM) and has been developed using different protein sources, such as Enterolobium cyclocarpum (Ec), soya bean waste sauce (SBWs), wheat pollard (WP) and WP bypass protein (WPBp). It has also been developed using medicated block (MB). The objective is to introduce the P- 32 tracer for obtaining a new feed supplement, to apply UMMB-SBM on beef <b>cattle</b> <b>for</b> <b>fattening,</b> and to test UMMB-MB on cows in the field. Parameters measured include microbial protein synthesis (MPS) in rumen liquid, daily live weight gain (DLWG), milk production and total count of worm in feces. Statistical analysis used were Latin squares, Student 2 ̆ 7 s t-test, and completely randomized design. The UMMB-SBM was better than UMMB-Ec, UMMB-SBWs, and UMMB-WP, because it was able to increase MPS by up to 205. 67...|$|R
