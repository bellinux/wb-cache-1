Over the next 48 hours the system quickly developed further and was classified as subtropical, as it developed a <b>banding</b> <b>structure</b> and deep convection near its warm core. On March 29, a north-westerly flow encroached on the systems environment, which caused the system to rapidly move towards 40S and the cold waters that were present to the south of 40°S.

Tensile testing of these specimens revealed that the failure occured by a transverse cleavage of CuAl₂ platelets and a shear fracture of the matrix between cracks on adjacent CuAl₂ platelets.

Age is often estimated using the <b>banding</b> <b>structure</b> in otoliths, but the technique used can influence the estimate, especially in slow-growing, long-lived species. Counts of translucent bands from both whole and thin-sectioned Arctic grayling (Thymallus arcticus) otoliths from the Kuparuk River, Alaska, gave similar age estimates. Age estimates from whole otoliths were less variable, particularly for older age groups, and were much easier to prepare and read than thin-sections. Comparison of growth of individual tagged fish to a von Bertalanffy growth model revealed that the translucent rings are true annuli. This approach to validation may be most useful in northern latitudes where other techniques are impractical.

The mechanical signature of these processes has been indentified in the time series of the shear stress. The interface instability occurs all along the stress plateau, the asymptotic wavelength of the patterns increasing with the control parameter typically from a fraction of the gap width to about four times the gap width. Three main regimes of dynamics are highlighted : a spatially stable oscillating mode approximately at the middle of the coexistence region flanked by two ranges where the dynamics appears more exotic with propagative and chaotic events respectively at low and high shear rates. The distribution of small particles seeded in the solution strongly suggests that the flow is three-dimensional.

One of the possible routes is severe plasticdeformation. The efficiency of the grain size reduction during severe plasticdeformation is associated with grain fragmentation process which is also ofinterest in the field of crystallographic textures. An accurate textureprediction requires a deep understanding of the grain scale microstructureevolution. Therefore, it is significant to investigate the process of grainfragmentation and its influencing factors such as the intrinsic orientationeffect and the extrinsic grain-grain interaction. The aimof this study is to use electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) to characterizethe microstructure and texture evolution in niobium single and polycrystalsupon cold plastic deformation up to large strains, in order to betterunderstand the mechanisms of grain fragmentation on the grain-scale. Specialattention is paid to the interpretation of the deformation structures on themesoscopic level, i. e. orientation gradients and mesoscopic bands. A niobiumpolycrystal is subjected to successive uniaxial compression tests at roomtemperature up to 30 % reduction. After each deformation step, EBSD is used toscan the local orientations and the microstructure on one and the samelongitudinal section for comparison. Grains with an inner orientation gradientare characterized by a moving fragmentation boundary. Its alignment andmobility are associated with the dislocation activities on both sides. On thecontrary, one grain with a similar orientation shows a mesoscopic bandingstructure as a result of continuous splitting. With a detailed comparison of thegrain subdivision behavior in both grains, a deformation mechanism of themesoscopic <b>banding</b> <b>structure</b> is proposed in terms of the arrangement of excessdislocations. Three niobium singlecrystals with different orientations are processed by equal channel angularpressing (ECAP) at room temperature for a single pass. EBSD is used tocharacterize the evolution of the microstructures and the local orientations onboth the transversal and the longitudinal cross sections. The influence ofgrain orientation is manifested by the extent of grain splitting on both the micronand the mesoscopic level. Two of the crystals with mesoscopic bandingstructures have been studied with respect to the slip activity, orientationevolution, their alignment and the sequence in time of their formation. Finally, a deformation mechanism for the <b>banding</b> <b>structure</b> in ECAP is proposed. /* Style Definitions */ table.

Post-processing of the ultrasound signal was used to generate images of the acoustic impedance of the coral—a quantity that is related to the density of the coral. The ultrasound images were qualitatively consistent with X-ray images of the coral samples—X-ray absorption is also related to coral density. Both images showed a <b>banding</b> <b>structure</b> related to the annual growth cycle of the coral.
