5|$|Chabaneau {{was able}} to easily remove most of platinum's natural impurities, {{including}} gold, mercury, lead, copper, and iron, leading him to <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> working with pure platinum. However, the metal displayed inconsistent characteristics. At times it was malleable, yet at times it was highly brittle. Sometimes it was entirely incombustible, yet sometimes it burned readily. These inconsistencies were a result of various impurities: rhodium, palladium, osmium, iridium, and ruthenium. These elements would later {{come to be known}} as the platinum group metals, but at the time of Chabaneau's research, they had not yet been discovered.|$|E

The United States Department of State was offering up to US$5 million for information leading to his arrest and conviction.

Stephen Bartowski created the original Intersect prototype and first used it on Hartley, which was updated with the personality, knowledge and identity of Volkoff, a manufactured identity. However, the Intersect was so unstable that it plagued Hartley's mind and deleting his personality as Hartley Winterbottom, instead he started to <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> Alexei Volkoff, an international arms dealer, and as such he established the Volkoff Industries and became an international terrorist and gun manufacturer.|$|E

5|$|The {{episode was}} written by {{consulting}} producer Jane Espenson and directed by Milan Cheylov. It featured the first appearance of de Ravin, who was cast as Belle in November 2011 after being approached by series co-creators Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz. Espenson created a love-themed episode; initially its main theme was to focus on Rumpelstiltskin choosing power over love, but {{during the writing process}} Espenson decided to make him instead <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> not worthy of love at all.|$|E
5|$|Nosanchuk then {{considered}} {{whether or}} not to call Lamb to the stand on his own behalf at the trial. He already had a strong defence, with five psychiatrists firmly behind him as well as George Scott of Kingston Penitentiary, who had agreed to testify on his behalf. The lawyer considered the boy's probable reaction to a cross-examination by the prosecution in court. Lamb appeared calm and collected on the surface, and had so far answered questions about right and wrong in a somewhat rational way. Although the doctors had been able to see Lamb's answers for what they really were, Nosanchuk feared that Lamb's appearance could actually lead the jury to <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> sane, which might lead to a guilty verdict and the gallows. He therefore did not call Lamb to the stand.|$|E
5|$|Some of the Kentish crowds now dispersed, {{but others}} continued. From this point, {{they appear to}} have been led by Wat Tyler, whom the Anonimalle Chronicle {{suggests}} was elected their leader at a large gathering at Maidstone on 7 June. Relatively little is known about Tyler's former life; chroniclers suggest that he was from Essex, had served in France as an archer and was a charismatic and capable leader. Several chroniclers <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> responsible for shaping the political aims of the revolt. Some also mention a Jack Straw as a leader among the Kentish rebels during this phase in the revolt, but it is uncertain if this was a real person, or a pseudonym for Wat Tyler or John Wrawe.|$|E

5|$|Even though Johnson {{had been}} given a mandate to take {{military}} action against North Vietnam and their Viet Cong allies in South Vietnam, he hesitated to take further steps to retaliate against North Vietnam. Towards the end of 1964, Johnson {{was in the midst of}} a presidential election and he did not want the U.S. public to <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> leading their country into war. Therefore, Johnson decided to wait until after the election, when his presidency was assured, that he would decide on other military moves. Meanwhile, the political situation in South Vietnam continued to worsen; in August 1964, South Vietnamese General Lan Van Phat tried to overthrow General Nguyễn Khánh, but the coup was aborted and Phat handed power to Air Marshal Nguyễn Cao Kỳ, and Generals Nguyễn Chánh Thi and Nguyễn Văn Thiệu. However, on 20 December 1964, Khánh formed a new military junta with Kỳ and Thi and the civilian-led High National Council was subsequently dissolved. Thus, the South Vietnamese Government was once again plunged into chaos.|$|E
5|$|Sam {{died while}} him, Nathan and their {{associate}} Rafe Adler attempted {{to find the}} whereabouts of Henry Avery's Gunsway haul in a Panamanian prison. Nathan and Rafe escaped, while Sam is shot 'dead'. In reality, he was imprisoned once again after his wounds were tended to,a distraught Nate did attempt to find him, still thinking he was alive but was lead to <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> dead by the guards who wanted Sam to rot in prison as revenge for them indirectly killing a guard. 15 years later, he tracks down a retired Nathan and convinces him {{to pick up where}} they left off in the search for the Gunsway haul by feeding Nathan a false breakout story. The story involves Hector Alcazar, who broke Sam free and demands half of the treasure of the Gunsway. These events kick off the main story of Uncharted 4: A Thief's End. It is later revealed that Rafe bribed the prison to release Sam, and that Sam double crossed Rafe to resume the search with Nathan.|$|E

25|$|Much of what {{is known}} about Lord Chunshen comes from his {{biography}} in the Records of the Grand Historian (Shiji), written by the great Han Dynasty historian Sima Qian.

However, the younger Lepidus was probably involved in a conspiracy in 39 AD, along with the emperor's sisters Agrippina the Younger and Julia Livilla.
