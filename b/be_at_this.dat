Tabitha greets Katy at the door and {{explains}} that the house is always kept at −3°C as Hector and Tabitha's disabled brother, Andras, needs the air to <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> temperature. The paintings on the house's walls depict the Harrowing of Hell. After meeting Hector, Katy is disturbed by Tabitha's descriptions of Andras, who, it is claimed, does not have a mouth. He instead keeps a bell, which he never uses, beside his bed. Katy is told not to go upstairs.|$|E

25|$|In 1934, Mark Oliphant, Paul Harteck and Ernest Rutherford {{were the}} first to achieve fusion on Earth, using a {{particle}} accelerator to shoot deuterium nuclei into a metal foil containing deuterium, lithium or other elements. This allowed them to measure the nuclear cross section of various fusion reactions, and determined that the deuterium-deuterium reaction occurred at a lower energy than other reactions, peaking at about 100,000electronvolts (100keV). This would be the energy of particles heated to thousands of millions of kelvins, but because the reaction releases so much energy, only a small proportion of particles need to <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> level to keep the reaction going. Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics suggest this would be true at much lower temperatures; in 1944, Enrico Fermi calculated the reaction would be self-sustaining at about 50,000,000 K.|$|E

500|$|By late 1944, {{both the}} Red Army and the Western Allies were {{advancing}} into Germany. Recognising {{the strength and}} determination of the Red Army, Hitler decided to use his remaining mobile reserves against the American and British troops, which he perceived as far weaker. On 16 December, he launched the Ardennes Offensive to incite disunity among the Western Allies and perhaps convince them to join his fight against the Soviets. The offensive failed after some temporary successes. With much of Germany in ruins in January 1945, Hitler spoke on the radio: [...] "However grave as the crisis may <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> moment, it will, despite everything, be mastered by our unalterable will." [...] Hitler's hope to negotiate peace with the United States and Britain was encouraged {{by the death of}} Franklin D. Roosevelt on 12 April 1945, but contrary to his expectations, this caused no rift among the Allies. Acting on his view that Germany's military failures meant it had forfeited its right to survive as a nation, Hitler ordered the destruction of all German industrial infrastructure before it could fall into Allied hands. Minister for Armaments Albert Speer was entrusted with executing this scorched earth policy, but he secretly disobeyed the order.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally mixed reviews. Brian Howard of The Journal News {{described it}} as [...] "classic Office" [...] and praised the camaraderie the staff showed {{for each other and}} the [...] "bizarre discomfort" [...] of the double date with Jim, Pam, Phyllis and Bob. Howard described Dwight and Kevin as the episode's stand-outs. Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger said the episode lacked many laugh-out-loud moments, but was effective because the characters are so well developed: [...] "The Office has, over the years, become as much of a kitchen sink drama as it is a comedy. ... The characters are so well-drawn by now, {{and for the most part}} so likable, that a sweet, low-key episode about Michael and the staff bonding over their singlehood worked even without a lot of memorable jokes." [...] Travis Fickett of IGN described the episode as [...] "familiar territory, but it has plenty of fun moments." [...] Fickett praised the scene with Carell and the mystery woman, and Jim and Pam's lunch. But Fickett said the series needed to address why Pam was staying with the company: [...] "Jim and Pam still work there because, well, that's part of the show – but there really isn't a very good reason as to why these two would still <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> dead end job." ...|$|E
500|$|Because rehearsals did {{not start}} until October 1874 and lasted longer than anticipated, the premiere was delayed. The final rehearsals went well, and in a {{generally}} optimistic mood the first night was fixed for 3 March 1875, the day on which, coincidentally, Bizet's appointment as a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour was formally announced. The premiere, which was conducted by Adolphe Deloffre, was attended by many of Paris's leading musical figures, including Massenet, Offenbach, Delibes and Gounod; during the performance the last-named was overheard complaining bitterly that Bizet had stolen the music of Micaëla's act 3 aria from him: [...] "That melody is mine!" [...] Halévy recorded his impressions of the premiere {{in a letter to}} a friend; the first act was evidently well received, with applause for the main numbers and numerous curtain calls. The first part of act 2 also went well, but after the toreador's song there was, Halévy noted, [...] "coldness". In act 3 only Micaëla's aria earned applause as the audience became increasingly disconcerted. The final act was [...] "glacial from first to last", and Bizet was left [...] "only with the consolations of a few friends". The critic Ernest Newman wrote later that the sentimentalist Opéra-Comique audience was [...] "shocked by the drastic realism of the action" [...] and by the low standing and defective morality of most of the characters. According to the composer Benjamin Godard, Bizet retorted, in response to a compliment, [...] "Don't you see that all these bourgeois have not understood a wretched word of the work I have written for them?" [...] In a different vein, shortly after the work had concluded, Massenet sent Bizet a congratulatory note: [...] "How happy you must <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> time—it's a great success!".|$|E

500|$|Blood Sugar Sex Magik was hugely {{successful}} upon its release on September 24, 1991. It peaked at number {{three on the}} Billboard charts, {{and went on to}} sell thirteen million copies worldwide. The unexpected success instantly turned the Red Hot Chili Peppers into rock stars. Frusciante was blindsided by his newfound fame, and struggled to cope with it. Soon after the album's release, he began to develop a dislike for the band's popularity. Kiedis recalled that he and Frusciante used to get into heated discussions backstage after concerts: [...] "John would say, 'We're too popular. I don't need to <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> level of success. I would just be proud to be playing this music in clubs like you guys were doing two years ago.'" [...] Frusciante later said that the band's rise to popularity was [...] "too high, too far, too soon. Everything seemed to be happening at once and I just couldn't cope with it." [...] He also began to feel that destiny was leading him away from the band. When the Chili Peppers began their world tour, he started to hear voices in his head telling him [...] "you won't make it during the tour, you have to go now." [...] Frusciante admitted to having once taken great pleasure in hedonism; however, [...] "by the age of twenty, I started doing it right and looking at it as an artistic expression instead of a way of partying and screwing a bunch of girls. To balance it out, I had to be extra-humble, extra-anti-rock star." [...] He refused to take the stage during a performance at Tokyo's Club Quattro on May 7, 1992, telling his bandmates that he was leaving the band. He was persuaded to perform, but left for California the next morning; according to the guitarist, [...] "it was just impossible for me to stay in the band any longer. It had come to the point where even though they wanted me in the band, it felt like I was forced out of the band. Not by any members in particular or management in particular, but just the direction it was going." [...] He was replaced by former Jane's Addiction guitarist Dave Navarro.|$|E

2500|$|A {{straight}} line connecting the periapsis and apoapsis {{is the line}} of apsides. This is the major axis of the ellipse, its greatest diameter. [...] For a two-body system the center of mass of the system lies on this line {{at one of the}} two foci of the ellipse. When one body is sufficiently larger than the other it may be taken to <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> focus. [...] However {{whether or not this is}} the case, both bodies are in similar elliptical orbits each having one focus at the system's center of mass, with their respective lines of apsides being of length inversely proportional to their masses. [...] Historically, in geocentric systems, apsides were measured from the center of the Earth. However, in the case of the Moon, the center of mass of the Earth–Moon system, or Earth–Moon barycenter, as the common focus of both the Moon's and Earth's orbits about each other, is about 75% of the way from Earth's center to its surface.|$|E

2500|$|The {{unexpected}} success instantly turned Red Hot Chili Peppers into rock stars. Frusciante was blindsided by {{his newfound}} fame, {{and struggled to}} cope with it. Soon after the album's release, he began to develop a dislike for the band's popularity and personal problems between Kiedis and Frusciante began to unfold. Kiedis recalled that he and Frusciante used to get into heated discussions backstage after concerts: [...] "John would say, 'We're too popular. I don't need to <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> level of success. I would just be proud to be playing this music in clubs like you guys were doing two years ago.'" [...] The final dates with Frusciante were a mess and Frusciante was so disconnected from the group, often changing the way he played on certain songs, which further got under Kiedis' skin. Unknown to others, Frusciante was also starting his own drug habit {{at the time and}} was shutting himself off from everyone except for his girlfriend. Frusciante abruptly quit the band hours before a show during the Blood Sugar Japanese tour in May 1992. The band reached out to Dave Navarro, who had just split from Jane's Addiction, but who was involved in his own personal drug battles. The group held rehearsals with Zander Schloss, though after a few days they decided he was not the right fit either. Guitarist Arik Marshall, of Los Angeles band Marshall Law, was hired to replace Frusciante and the band headlined the Lollapalooza festival in 1992. Marshall would also appear in the music videos for [...] "Breaking the Girl", [...] "If You Have to Ask" [...] and on The Simpsons fourth-season finale, [...] "Krusty Gets Kancelled".|$|E
