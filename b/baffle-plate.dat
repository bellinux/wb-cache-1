Based on {{application}} characteristic of hydraulic retarder in combined braking, the generant mechanism of air losing is analyzed, by adding <b>baffle-plate</b> setting, air losing is reduced. Using CFD technology, the ameliorative hydraulic retarder is studied contrastively, {{and the results}} are in good agreement with the experiment...|$|E
40|$|Contaminated {{waste air}} {{has been treated}} with a <b>baffle-plate</b> {{scrubbing}} tower with 42 plates in three stages. The air was sampled for activity before and after each stage {{and the effect of}} several process variables investigated. With only six plates per stage in use the efficiency for plain cold water washing was 99. 6 percent or better, and was 99. 92 percent for the cloud chamber mode of operation.

50|$|The battery {{condenser}} was a {{long and}} narrow box divided internally by <b>baffle-plates</b> which cause the gas to take a circuitous course. The width of the box was usually about 2 feet, and small tubes passed {{from side to side}} form the chief cooling surface. The ends of these tubes were left open to allow air to pass through. The obstruction caused by the tubes played a role in breaking up and throwing down the tars suspended in the gas.|$|R
