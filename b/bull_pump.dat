5000|$|In BMX racing, Prokop {{has been}} named an eight-time Czech champion, and {{collected}} three gold medals to his career resume at the European Championships. Moreover, he mounted numerous top-three finishes at the UCI BMX World Championships, including his men's cruiser bronze medal in 2002. Prokop also represented his nation Czech Republic at the 2008 Summer Olympics, and more recently, earned his only prestigious title in the men's elite category at the 2012 Red <b>Bull</b> <b>Pump</b> Riders tournament in his home turf Prague. Because of his ample successes in both BMX and fourcross racing, Prokop {{has been named}} the [...] "King of the Czech Cycling" [...] by the nation's governing sport union in 2006. Since he turned himself professional in 1995, Prokop currently races for the Specialized BMX and Fourcross Racing Team.|$|E
40|$|The {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the separated flows of viscous-elastic liquids. The aim is to develop the means and methods for control of the liquid hydraulics in canals of variable section taking into consideration influence of the rheologic properties of liquids, forms, dimensions and number of cavities on the separated flows. The hypothesis about control possibility of separated flows has been confirmed, the influence of rheologic properties and geometric factors of cavities on the characteristic of separated flow has been determined. The control means and methods of flow hydraulics permitting to improve the operating characteristics {{as an example of the}} hole bull pumps have been developed. The liquid leakage through the pairs plunger - cylinder of hole <b>bull</b> <b>pump</b> has been decreased for purpose of its increasing overhaul period in industrial conditions in ten holes of Production Association "Azneft".

40|$|Elektroless bumping {{processes}} {{as an alternative}} to galvanic bumping have been developed. Controlled metal deposition on individual chips has been obtained from nickel and nickel/copper based bathes. Bonding capability of Ni/Cu/Su bumps has been proved by thermosonic and thermocompression bonding. Laser deposition has been used for laser direct writing of gold to repair defensive lines in thin film metallization and for deposition of optimized gold bumps. Flip-chip contacting of Au-bumped GaAs chips is achieved by thermocompression. Additional developments include a mechanical chip bumping process using gold-thermosonic-wire bonding, realization of flip-chip assemblies by thermocompression for GaAs and Si chips with mechanical <b>bull</b> <b>pumps</b> and construction of flip-chip test assemblies for hf characterization. Nearly developed simulation methods have been applied to the characterization and optimation of hf-, thermal and thermo-mechanical device behaviour.

2500|$|<b>Bull</b> Hassocks <b>pumping</b> {{station was}} {{designed}} to handle water from the South Idle drains, but prior to 1970 also had to handle water from the Folly Drain. This was altered in that year, by building a new pumping station at Greenholme, which pumped the Folly Drain into the South Level Engine Drain. The station was built by the Trent River Board for the West Axholme IDB, and contained three pumps, two of [...] diameter, capable of pumping 109 Mld, and one of [...] rated at 29 Mld. The area was affected by the motorway construction programme of the late 1970s and early 1980s, which saw the M18 motorway running along {{the western edge of}} the Chase and the M180 motorway crossing it, broadly parallel to the Stainforth and Keadby Canal, but a little further south. The roads produced large volumes of run-off water, which entered the drainage system.|$|R
25|$|The River Torne, which {{rises to}} the west of Tickhill, crosses the middle of the area. Candy Farm North and South pumping {{stations}} are situated on the area's western edge. The South Engine Drain and Folly Drain form the eastern boundary, and run parallel to the River Torne after it has crossed the Chase. <b>Bull</b> Hassocks <b>pumping</b> station is located {{at the start of the}} South Engine Drain, and is on the site of the first steam powered pumping station. Hatfield Waste Drain and the North Engine Drain run along the northern boundary. Tunnel Pits North and South pumping stations are located on the Hatfield Waste Drain, while Dirtness pumping station is at the head of the North Engine Drain. The buildings here were erected in 1862. All of these watercourses converge on Pilfrey Junction, from where three parallel channels, called Three Rivers, flow to a pumping station at Keadby. The Hatfield Waste Drain crosses under the North Engine Drain before the junction, and then becomes the north channel. The centre channel is formed by the North Engine Drain and the River Torne, while the south channel carries the waters of the South Engine Drain and the Folly Drain.|$|R
2500|$|With {{a view to}} {{improving}} the drainage of the Chase, an Act of Parliament obtained in 1862 created the Corporation of the Level of Hatfield Chase, which took over {{the management of the}} drainage from the individual Participants who had formerly been responsible for it. This act authorised further construction work, including a steam pumping engine for {{the northern part of the}} Chase. The areas which were subject to taxation were extended, and the act listed 21 townships and parishes which would be required to pay for the drainage works. The jurisdiction of the Court of Sewers was replaced by the meetings of the Corporation from 1862. The Corporation spent £8,887 on a new pumping station at Dirtness which was operational by 1865. The building contained two compound beam engines, driving a single scoop wheel which was [...] and weighed 80 tons. <b>Bull</b> Hassocks <b>pumping</b> station was upgraded in 1892. Two [...] centrifugal pumps were driven by [...] steam engines, and when both were running, the station could discharge 300 tons per minute (440 Megalitres per day (Mld)) into the South Engine Drain. Diesel engines gave way to electric pumps at Dirtness in 1928, when they were replaced by a Gwynnes Limited pump driven by an electric motor.|$|R
