25|$|Despite this {{economic}} growth, Bolivia reverted to {{the repression of}} earlier regimes. The new minister of interior, Colonel Andrés Sélich ordered a massive crackdown on the left, abolishing labor unions and closing the universities. The government brutally suppressed a general strike against the devaluation of the <b>Bolivian</b> <b>peso</b> in 1972. In 1974 price increases for basic goods and control of food prices resulted in roadblocks by peasants in the Cochabamba Valley and their subsequent massacre by the military.|$|E
5000|$|The first Bolivian {{boliviano}} was {{the currency}} of Bolivia from 1864 to 1963. Due to rising inflation, it was replaced with the <b>Bolivian</b> <b>peso</b> at an exchange rate of [...] bolivianos to [...] peso. The peso was later replaced by the second Bolivian boliviano.|$|E
5000|$|Following {{many years}} of rampant inflation, the <b>bolivian</b> <b>peso</b> was {{replaced}} in 1987 by a new boliviano {{at a rate of}} one million to one ( [...] when 1 US dollar was worth 1.8/1.9 million pesos [...] ). At that time, 1 new boliviano was roughly equivalent to 1 U.S. dollar.|$|E
25|$|The facts {{surrounding}} Butch Cassidy's {{death are}} uncertain. On November 3, 1908, near San Vicente in southern Bolivia, a courier for the Aramayo Franke and Cia Silver Mine was conveying his company's payroll, worth about 15,000 <b>Bolivian</b> <b>pesos,</b> by mule, {{when he was}} attacked and robbed by two masked American bandits believed to be Cassidy and Longabaugh (Sundance). The bandits then proceeded to the small mining town of San Vicente, where they lodged in a small boarding house owned by a local resident miner named Bonifacio Casasola.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis article aims to {{shed light}} on the Caravana de la integración en sillas de ruedas (wheelchair {{integration}} caravan), a group of around 20 physically disabled people, who travelled more than one thousand kilometres in wheelchairs from the Bolivian city of Trinidad to the capital, La Paz. The trip lasted 90 days (from 15 November 2011 to mid-February 2012) and aimed to assert their right to receive an allowance of 3, 000 <b>Bolivian</b> <b>pesos.</b> In examining the specificity of this social movement, it seems relevant to compare it to another march organised by a group of Spanish disabled people in September 1933 between Zaragoza and Madrid. These Spanish activists were asking for employment in the government administration, and lifetime benefits for those who were not able to work. This comparison will look at both the environments that fostered the development of such protests and how this type of action has changed over time and adapted to the economic, social and technological changes in the 20 th century. We will also look at the different political impacts of these two marches...|$|R
5000|$|The linking of the Bolivian {{economy to}} the US Dollar. The <b>Bolivian</b> <b>peso</b> devaluated with 93 percent over one night, in fact {{installing}} the US Dollar as currency and denying {{the country to}} commit an own monetary policy. Accounts in any currency were authorized and interest rates were freed.|$|E
50|$|The Bolivian {{currency}} is the boliviano (ISO 4217: BOB; symbol: Bs.) One boliviano {{is divided into}} 100 centavos. The current boliviano replaced the <b>Bolivian</b> <b>peso</b> {{at a rate of}} one million to one in 1987 after many years of rampant inflation. At that time, 1 new boliviano was roughly equivalent to 1 U.S. dollar. At the end of 2011 the boliviano is only worth around 0,145 U.S. Dollar. Interest rates in 2010 were situated at 9,9 percent, which is part of a downgoing trend from more than 50 percent before 1997.|$|E
50|$|The sol was {{introduced}} in 1863 when Peru completed its decimalization, replacing the real {{at a rate of}} 1 sol = 10 reales. The sol also replaced the <b>Bolivian</b> <b>peso,</b> which had circulated in southern Peru, at the rate of 1 sol = 1.25 Bolivian pesos. Between 1858 and 1863, coins had been issued denominated in reales, centavos and escudos. The sol was initially pegged to the French franc at a rate of 1 sol = 5 francs (5.25 soles to the British pound and 1.08 soles to the US dollar).|$|E
