25|$|Males {{fertilize}} females only by traumatic insemination {{into the}} structure called the ectospermalege (the organ of Berlese, however the organ of Ribaga, {{as it was}} first named, was first designated as an organ of stridulation. These two names are not descriptive, so other terminologies are used). On fertilization, the female's ovaries finish developing, which suggests that sperm plays a role other than fertilizing the egg. Fertilization also allows for egg production through the corpus allatum. Sperm remains viable in a female's spermathecae (a <b>better</b> <b>term</b> is conceptacle), a sperm-carrying sack, {{for a long period}} of time as long as body temperature is optimum. The female lays fertilized eggs until she depletes the sperm found in her conceptacle. After the depletion of sperm, she lays a few sterile eggs. The number of eggs a C. lectularius female produces does not depend on the sperm she harbors, but on the female's nutritional level.|$|E

Also in May, details were shared on a three issue tie-in series titled Civil War II: Ulysses from writer Al Ewing and artist Jefte Palo. The series focuses on Ulysses, the new Inhuman {{with the power}} to predict the future at the center of [...] "Civil War II". Ewing described the series as [...] "a prequel of sorts", explaining, [...] "we're following Ulysses as he's taken to the Tower of Wisdom -- a sort of Inhuman temple of learning, for want of a <b>better</b> <b>term</b> -- to be trained by Karnak, whose Inhuman ability is to see the flaw in all things. Karnak's training methods might be more than Ulysses can handle, though." [...] The next month, Alonso said [...] "Civil War II" [...] would set a new status quo in the Marvel Universe, which would be presented in the [...] "Divided We Stand" [...] storyline as part of the company's 2016 Marvel NOW! relaunch.|$|E

2500|$|Several {{sources have}} {{referred}} to the Bogdanov affair as a [...] "reverse Sokal" [...] hoax, drawing a comparison with the Sokal affair, where the physicist Alan Sokal published a deliberately fraudulent and indeed nonsensical article in the humanities journal Social Text. Sokal's original aim had been to test {{the effects of the}} intellectual trend he called, [...] "for want of a <b>better</b> <b>term,</b> postmodernism". Worried by this [...] "more-or-less explicit rejection of the rationalist tradition of the Enlightenment", Sokal decided to perform an experiment which he later cheerfully admitted was both unorthodox and uncontrolled, provoking a maelstrom of reactions which, to his surprise, received coverage in Le Monde and even the front page of The New York Times. The physicist John Baez drew a comparison between the two events in his October 2002 post to the sci.physics.research newsgroup.|$|E
2500|$|Parlor magic [...] is {{done for}} larger audiences than {{close-up}} magic (which is for a few people or even one person) and for smaller audiences than stage magic. In parlor magic, the performer is usually standing and {{on the same level}} as the audience, which may be seated on chairs or even on the floor. According to the Encyclopedia of Magic and Magicians by T.A. Waters, [...] "The phrase [...] is often used as a pejorative to imply that an effect under discussion is not suitable for professional performance." [...] Also, many magicians consider the term [...] "parlor" [...] old fashioned and limiting, since this type of magic is often done in rooms much larger than the traditional parlor, or even outdoors. A <b>better</b> <b>term</b> for this branch of magic may be [...] "platform," [...] "club" [...] or [...] "cabaret." [...] Examples of such magicians include Jeff McBride, David Abbott, Channing Pollock, Black Herman, and Fred Kaps.|$|E

2500|$|In 1988, {{the civil}} rights leader Jesse Jackson urged Americans to use instead the term [...] "African American" [...] because it had a {{historical}} cultural base and was a construction similar to terms used by European descendants, such as German American, Italian American, etc. Since then, African American and black have often had parallel status. However, controversy continues over which {{if any of the}} two terms is more appropriate. Maulana Karenga argues that the term African-American is more appropriate because it accurately articulates their geographical and historical origin. Others have argued that [...] "black" [...] is a <b>better</b> <b>term</b> because [...] "African" [...] suggests foreignness, although Black Americans helped found the United States. Still others believe that the term black is inaccurate because African Americans have a variety of skin tones. Some surveys suggest that the majority of Black Americans have no preference for [...] "African American" [...] or [...] "Black", although they have a slight preference for [...] "black" [...] in personal settings and [...] "African American" [...] in more formal settings.|$|E

2500|$|To {{counter the}} {{influence}} of Russian and English, government organizations (namely the Terminology Commission of the Latvian Academy of Science and the State Language Center) try to popularize the use of Latvian terms and linguistic purism. Purism is often observed in the coining of new terms, which are usually disputed by the public– although purists have invented some euphonic words, many neologisms are widely seen as alien and unnecessary, as preexisting words could be used instead [...] For example, a heated debate arose when the Terminology Commission suggested that eira, with its Latvianized ending, would be a <b>better</b> <b>term</b> for euro than the widely used eiro. Other new terms are calques or new loanwords. For example, Latvian has two words for [...] "telephone"– tālrunis and telefons, the former being a direct translation into Latvian of the latter international term. Still others are older or more euphonic loanwords rather than Latvian words. For example, [...] "computer" [...] can be either dators or kompjūters. Both are loanwords (the native Latvian word for [...] "computer" [...] is skaitļotājs). However, {{for some time now}} dators has been considered an appropriate translation.|$|E
