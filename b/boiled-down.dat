It would typically consist of dragées and mulled wine accompanied by aged cheese, and by the Late Middle Ages could also include fresh fruit covered in sugar, honey or syrup and <b>boiled-down</b> fruit pastes. Sugar, from its first appearance in Europe, was viewed {{as much as a}} drug as a sweetener; its long-lived medieval reputation as an exotic luxury encouraged its appearance in elite contexts accompanying meats and other dishes that to modern taste are more naturally savoury.

German-speaking areas had a particular fondness for krapfen: fried pastries and dough with various sweet and savory fillings. Marzipan in many forms was well known in Italy and southern France by the 1340s and is assumed to be of Arab origin. Anglo-Norman cookbooks are full of recipes for sweet and savory custards, potages, sauces and tarts with strawberries, cherries, apples and plums.

40|$|Most everyone, {{including}} the experts, {{would agree that}} analogy-making is best defined as a process that creates a mapping between items in one domain (often called the source) to “similar ” items in another domain (often called the target). Based on this definition, many researchers have attempted to model analogy-making by creating a mapping between two sets of data structures that represent the domains (Gentner, 1983; Holyoak and Thagard, 1989). Defining analogy-making as “making a mapping between domains ” creates many assumptions about analogy and how one might model it. For instance, the traditional view assumes that there exist pre-structured representations on which the mapping process operates. It {{is not at all}} clear that this assumption is cognitively plausible (Chalmers et al., 1995). This view also suggests that not only can the mapping process be separated from the structure-forming process, but that it is also distinct from more general perceptual processes. This, too, seems unlikely. Although these issues have been partially addressed by Hofstadter and colleagues (1995), one question remains: How could a system learn to make analogies? To create a model capable of learning to make analogies requires re-thinking some basic assumptions. Traditionally, “making an analogy ” has meant explicitly producing the entire set of correspondences from one domain to the other. It is difficult to see how a system could learn to do this. One possible solution, following the general suggestions of Maes (1993), is to frame the task in terms of behavior. One analogy-making task that can be seen entirely in terms of behavior is the “Do this! ” task posed by Hofstadter and French (French, 1992). A <b>boiled-down</b> version of this task was defined as follows. Consider Figure 1. Imagine an experimenter pointing to the triangle in the source scene and saying, “Do this! ” The subject’s task is then to point to the “same ” thing in the target scene. If one perceives the triangle as “the object that differs on the dimension of shape, ” then one might be inclined to choose the square in the target scene, as it, too, differs by shape from the two circles in the target scene. Of course, that is certainly not the Figure 1. A sample problem adapted from French (1992) ...|$|E
40|$|In {{the second}} of two {{articles}} on The Latham Diaries David Burchell looks at the underlying tragedy revealed in the former Labor leader’s account {{of the past decade}} FILM CRITICS are fond of describing movies as ‘working on different levels’. Not infrequently, that seems to be an apology for that kind of laboured art film that ‘works’ on no level at all. At least since Mark Latham has redefined the genre, the term can serve well enough for Australian political memoirs. For Latham’s Diaries is a book that ‘works’ on several, quite strikingly distinct levels. Put briefly, it’s part premeditated score-settling, part immediate diary, and part extended political meditation. Latham himself describes the post- 2004 election contributions (when, as he tells us, he was too busy to write regular entries) as ‘rather like a series of essays’. So long as you leave aside the literary implications of the word ‘essay’, it’s not a bad description. Unlike an overlong art movie, though, there’s nothing hidden or calculatedly enigmatic in this approach. Latham the diarist, like Latham the politician before him, is pure wysiwyg: {{what you see is what}} you get. If there are ‘levels’ here, it’s not because he’s trying to be ‘deep’. It’s just that there are too many things that demand to be said, and Latham lacks the patience to say them in any kind of formally delineated manner. I’ve dealt with the first of these ‘levels’ - the element of premeditated score-settling - already. Suffice it to say that, even if Latham’s anger is sometimes understandable, it’s not a pretty thing to watch a decade’s worth of frustration and resentment being worked out in epic fashion. The trouble for an outsider to federal Labor is to separate this frenzy of score-settling from the other elements of the book. Clearly, the Diaries are not historical source-material of the conventional kind. Latham tells as at the outset (and at several points along the trail) that he kept an ‘occasional diary’ throughout his twelve years in federal politics, and that this - aside from a few retrospective improvisations covering the period of the 2004 election campaign - is it. It’s a claim that doesn’t ring entirely true. No doubt Latham’s running vendetta with Kim Beazley does have a long history. Yet some of the passages of the Diaries from 1993 to 2002 that relate to Beazley have a 2004 -ish feel. (Did Beazley really offer nothing of substance on policy development in twelve long years? Was Latham really that contemptuous of him from the very outset?) Likewise, there are several grand ruminations on the dire state of the ALP throughout the book’s fast-forward journey from 1993 to 2002 that savour of the politician-author’s characteristic desire to present a consistent point of view. If Latham really had been that despairing of Labor from almost the moment he entered federal parliament, it was either a miracle or false pretences that allowed him to last there so long. No doubt that will be annoying for professional historians: this book will never become innocent footnote-fodder. But it doesn’t disqualify it from the historical or political record. For all of these reasons it’s tempting for the outsider to suspend judgement on the sundry incidents of personal and political conflict which dominate the greater part of the book, and to focus instead on (to lapse again into art film-speak) what presents itself as the book’s ‘message’. And yet it’s no easier to separate Latham’s ostensibly reflective judgements on the fate of Labor and social democracy from his personal turmoil and bitterness than it is to separate his personal antipathies from his political ones. An obvious example is the ‘radicalness’ and outsiderism Latham sees as the consistent thread through his political career. At times his reflections will indeed be gratifying to those who would describe themselves as political ‘radicals’ in the conventional sense. There are parts of the Latham Diaries (the rants against our obsequiousness to the Americans, or the conformism supposedly to be found at the heart of our culture, for instance) that read more or less like transcripts from the proceedings of an inner-city Politics at the Pub event, or the minutes of an especially disgruntled Labor Party branch. Reading these passages you have to wonder whether it really required such an explosive and painful Pilgrim’s Progress to arrive at something approaching the default position of a bright university undergraduate nowadays. (At one point Latham, visiting India on a political junket, gravely ponders how small and irrelevant our political problems seem in comparison to theirs, and what this means for the future of politics. For a brief moment I wondered whether we weren’t descending into The Backpacker’s Guide to the Galaxy.) Latham’s unreflective blanket hostility towards American ‘neo-colonialism’ and its local ‘toadies’ not infrequently reads like pure nose-thumbing at the Murdoch press; his newly discovered hostility towards mainstream Australian suburban values and priorities at times reads like cocking the snook towards an unkind electorate; and his almost apocalyptic sense of the critical state of Australian culture and mores (bland, conformist, consumerist, sick at heart) reads at times like the transposition of a weariness of the authorial soul onto the external datum of society. Musing further, you have to wonder whether at least some of the book’s political conclusions aren’t also refracted through the glass of Latham’s pervasive anger and frustration - a frustration directed in varying portions towards the political ‘establishment’, the Labor Party ‘machine-men’, and even, perhaps, Latham himself. And yet, despite the gloomy familiarity of passages like these, it’s worth persisting with the reflective portions of the book. For there’s more to Latham’s ‘radicalism’ than immediately meets the eye. Indeed, his very posture as a grand political pugilist (the slugging-matches with Tony Abbott, the vitriol) has a more complex aspect than is commonly appreciated. The diaristic portions of the book reveal quite starkly the sheer depth of Latham’s indebtedness to Paul Keating as a model for political energy, activity and focus. At one point Latham, like some wild-eyed nineteenth century German Romantic, extols the credo of Bonaparte: ‘Napoleon lived by the motto “commit and see what happens” - a man of conviction and adventure. ’ It might as well be a description of Keating himself. And Keating’s epitaph on Kim Beazley - ‘That useless fucking windbag Beazley had no indignation, that was his problem’ - might as well be Latham’s own. It surely can’t be mere coincidence that the two greatest heterodox figures of modern Labor - Keating with his neo-liberal macroeconomics and his nationalistic ‘big picture’, and Latham (another economic liberal) with his communitarian micro-politics and his suburban ‘small picture’ - should also be the most dedicated Tory-baiters of their era. When you’re venturing into uncharted and dangerous political territory, it seems, it helps to keep contact with your ‘roots’ by burning a bundle of good old-fashioned conservative effigies. For in truth Latham’s ‘radicalism’ was always a more creative and interesting standpoint than the steam-venting of parts of the Diaries might suggest. When he’s angry about the ossification of our political culture, it’s not really because he wants to recreate an imagined grassroots party of the left from a century ago, a party where branch members make policy via a Rousseauesque assemblage of monthly resolutions. (I only can imagine how Latham the impatient, envisioned leader would have reacted to that.) When he’s angry about the state of local communities it’s not because he wants to reanimate some imagined suburban Jerusalem of yore, with its clutch of neighbourhood busybodies and its unquestioned patriarchs. (Again, this is not an environment in which the enfant terrible Latham would have thrived.) He’s actually pushing at real problems, and at times genuinely groping towards solutions. And that’s more than can be said of most self-styled radicals nowadays - with their battery of ready-made, high-sounding placards inherited from past generations, like the political equivalent of the turntable at a ‘Greatest Hits and Memories’ radio station. The central conundrum of the times, as Latham correctly intuited earlier than most, is the paradox of a society which has never been better-fed, but which seems no less sick, and of a society which has never been better-resourced, but which seems incapable of generating peace of mind and rest in adequate quantities. We have a better-educated population than ever before (at least if credentialing is our guide), and one with an historically unparalleled grasp over their personal destinies (from investment portfolios to health options to insurances of sundry kinds). And yet we still produce addiction, sadness and dysfunction in apparently unrelieved quantities. Some of us have never been so ‘together’ in our lives, while others struggle to get it together simply to hold down a job. The children of those who struggled once to keep a family together nowadays no longer seem well-resourced enough even to keep themselves together, and too often slide into the slough of petty criminality and chemical self-abuse. As Latham notes in his introduction, poor communities (like the housing estate at Sydney’s Macquarie Fields, in Latham’s former electorate) once ‘were financially poor but socially rich. Today they face poverty on both fronts’. None of these dilemmas are well-addressed by the traditional Left panaceas of state-provided welfare and social assistance, those hardy perennials of another epoch. Journalistic critics of Latham the leader were fond of satirising his ‘grab-bag’ of political views, or decrying his ‘incoherent’ political nostrums. It was classic fish-and-chip-wrapping stuff. Rarely has a modern Australian politician arrived at the top with so many of their key views on politics, policy and society so well worked-out, at least at the level of general principle. For a decade or more Latham had thumped away at many of the same issues - a mistrust of large bureaucracies, a preference for local solutions, a lack of interest in the ideological pigmentation overlaying policy solutions and a preoccupation with their effects. The puzzle (if a puzzle is what it is) is what happened to these ideas when Latham assumed the mantle of leadership. Of course, there were <b>boiled-down</b> summary lines like the infamous ‘ladder of opportunity’ from Latham’s acceptance speech (a phrase which itself seemed to imply a lot of policies - on training, on education, on incomes and saving - that never really materialised), or the uninspired ‘easing the squeeze’ from the campaign. And there were the more or less memorable photo opportunities, like reading to pre-schoolers or wandering in the wilderness. But there never were much more than impressionistic brushstrokes towards a distinctive policy outlook over the brief, hectic year or so of Latham’s leadership. The school education policies pointed towards genuine problems. Yet they were too obviously animated by hostility to private school parents to carry much conviction as a positive policy direction. (The issue, after all, is surely improving the educational futures of ordinary kids, rather than the Battle of the Systems - emotional though some of us may feel about that.) The family income policies were a positive step - especially given that until now the conservatives have had more or less a monopoly on concern for one-income families. Yet such was Labor’s (and Latham’s) anxiety about the possibility of a funding fiasco that they weren’t released until the election campaign was in full swing - by which time nobody takes almost any policy announcement with complete seriousness. The environment policy was defensible in policy terms, but a political catastrophe, as Latham himself more or less acknowledges. At times, when Latham rails against the passivity or complacency of the electorate (surely the least edifying posture of a failed campaigner), it’s as if he’s accusing voters of having failed to read what was in his mind, or perhaps in his books. In political terms, that’s called a failure of communication, not a failure of imagination. Almost at the end of the book, Latham confesses the awful truth, almost too awful to voice. ‘We were always defying gravity, and by the middle of the year I felt rooted. I was disillusioned with the rotten lifestyle and didn’t give it my best, dropped my bundle’. And yet in Latham’s defence I feel compelled to add: who among Labor’s current camp-followers would have done it better, or tried harder? How many are there left in the dwindling emotional reservoir of the Labor caucus who could even explain in a reasonably cogent fashion what draws them to the political life nowadays - let alone what they’d do if Labor was elected to government? At a love-in in the Blue Mountains in 2002, the shadow cabinet was asked (inevitably) to write down their personal political goals. If Latham is to be believed, Stephen Smith’s goals were ‘to undermine the government and communicate effectively’. (Solving poverty, he supposedly said, was ‘too lofty’.) Barry Jones’ recent description of the current Labor front-bench as ‘ 16 apparatchiks, 10 union officials, four others’ is an arithmetical way of saying the same thing. In some ways the saddest part of Latham’s story is not his much-ventilated sense of betrayal by his colleagues (much of which is frankly overcooked), but his painfully acute account of the precipitous decline of federal Labor in the years after 1996. Having liberalised financial markets, opened Australia to the world and systematised training policies, the old Hawke-Keating veterans saw their job as done. They had no baton to pass, and increasingly they had no one to pass it to. A decade and a half ago the young Latham - then an up-and-coming political tiger - speculated on the death of social democracy. Then his argument was that the conditions that sustained the old social democratic ‘project’ of the earlier twentieth century no longer applied. We needed different, more dispersed, solutions. Now he has concluded that ‘the problem of social democratic reform in Australia in insoluble’, chiefly on the grounds of the decline of Labor as a reforming party. This shift from a focus on the social problems to be solved to the unfitness of the political vehicle with which to solve them fits neatly enough with Latham’s sense of personal exhaustion and abandonment. Yet there will be no other political vehicle, at least at the level of electoral politics. And since social democracy isn’t really a ‘project’ (with its connotations of cardboard sheets and Perkins Paste) but rather a space in which problems can be posed and perhaps solved, it won’t ‘die’ because a particular political milieux has exhausted itself. The bigger problem isn’t why Latham departed the Labor leadership. It’s why there aren’t more Junior Lathams out there, bursting with desire to ‘make a difference’, and filling out that love-in butcher’s paper with grand affirmatives. • David Burchell teaches in Humanities at the University of Western Sydney, and is associate editor of APO.
