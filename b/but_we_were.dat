I had a {{great feeling}} about it when we {{finished}} writing the song, and I was flying back from Atlanta at some crazy hour of the morning... <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> listening to it on the plane ride on the way home, and even from the demo version, I really felt something very special.|$|E

25|$|I {{thought it}} looked very teeny-bopperish. <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> {{on top of}} a deadline, so of course {{there was no way to}} make any radical changes to it. There were some silly bits—little chunks of corn and {{nonsense}} like that.|$|E

We like to see pity and mercy: <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> very often proud and selfish and tyrannical. We like to see justice and honour: <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> too apt to be mean and unjust ourselves. We like to see other people doing their duty: <b>but</b> <b>we</b> very often do not do ours.' ...|$|R

25|$|Set {{off from}} Paris on Friday 21 June 1895 at 5.25am from the Porte Maillot, where Monsieur Haufert, {{timekeeper}} of the Union, {{gave us the}} starting signal, we crossed the Bois de Boulogne towards Versailles. The weather was cold, that damp coldness of some mornings in June which makes you search for a light jacket and freezes your hands; <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> full of ardour, replete with good advice and lots of energy and it was happily that Richard and I on the tandem and our trainer Lambert on a bicycle started our long journey for the record from Paris to Agen.|$|E
25|$|Three {{widespread}} {{units are}} recognized within the Victoria quadrangle. These are, from oldest to youngest, intercrater plains material, intermediate plains material, and smooth plains material. In addition, central peak, floor, rim, and ejecta materials {{related to the}} numerous craters and basins larger than about 20km in diameter are mapped. The simplicity of the stratigraphic scheme is {{at least in part}} due to deficiencies in the data base; the history of plains formation almost certainly is more complex than our threefold division indicates, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> not able to define consistent criteria of albedo, texture, and cratering for more than three plains units because of the highly variable quality of available pictures.|$|E

25|$|Say we {{are told}} that a woman has two children. If we ask whether either of them is a girl, and are told yes, what is the {{probability}} that the other child is also a girl? Considering this new child independently, one might expect the probability that the other child is female is ½ (50%). But by building a probability space (illustrating all possible outcomes), we see that the probability is actually only ⅓ (33%). This is because the possibility space illustrates 4 ways of having these two children: boy-boy, girl-boy, boy-girl, and girl-girl. <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> given more information. Once {{we are told}} that one of the children is a female, we use this new information to eliminate the boy-boy scenario. Thus the probability space reveals that there are still 3 ways to have two children where one is a female: boy-girl, girl-boy, girl-girl. Only ⅓ of these scenarios would have the other child also be a girl. Using a probability space, we are less likely to miss one of the possible scenarios, or to neglect the importance of new information. For further information, see Boy or girl paradox.|$|E
500|$|Martin, who {{finished}} second, was candid about the result, [...] "We did really well to finish second. I just don't {{think we were}} in [...] league today." [...] In the post-race press conference, Kenseth said of his result, [...] "We didn't qualify very good, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> really happy with our car. When the race started, I didn't think we were quite {{as good as we}} were yesterday (in practice), <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> able to have really good pit stops." [...] Logano, who was involved in the biggest accident of the race, [...] "The biggest thing was, I was fine the whole time, [...] I'm not really sure what happened. The spotter was clearing me low. When I got down there, they checked up going into the corner and I got tagged from behind." ...|$|E

500|$|I won the primary, but {{not with}} fifty-one percent of the vote. We had a runoff and I lost by two hundred votes – to a machine candidate. We were {{bringing}} fresh ideas, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> not experienced in fighting the machine on election day. I swore I'd never run for alderman again. There was so much racial baiting that it was terrifying. I was called names. ... My posters had black paint all over them with racial epithets. It was very disturbing.|$|E
500|$|Filming was {{scheduled}} to start on September 15, 2012. Principal photography commenced in October 2012 and concluded in November after 42 days; filming took place in New Mexico. The production received a 25% tax credit for filming in the state. Berg shot Lone Survivor with creative autonomy as Universal did not fully oversee the film's production. [...] "Not having the studio there every day ... I respect Universal and get along great with them, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> on our own completely, and in many ways, it was a more autonomous experience".|$|E
500|$|... "We {{dared to}} hope we had invented {{something}} that would bring lasting peace to the earth. <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> wrong... No, I don't have any regrets about my part in {{the invention of the}} airplane, though no one could deplore more than I do the destruction it has caused. I feel about the airplane much the same as I do in regard to fire. That is, I regret all the terrible damage caused by fire, but I think it is good for the human race that someone discovered how to start fires and that we have learned how to put fire to thousands of important uses." ...|$|E

500|$|The casting for [...] "Signs & Wonders" [...] was [...] "rather unorthodox". In {{order to}} prevent ophidiophobia from hitting the actors {{on the day of}} filming, live rattlesnakes were brought in during the casting sessions. Strangely enough, many of the actors were [...] "thrilled" [...] about holding the snakes, {{according}} to Kim Manners. He later noted that [...] "the funny thing was that the actors couldn't wait to hold the rattlesnakes [...] <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> still nervous." [...] In addition, Michael Childers, who portrayed Reverend O'Connor, was actually the son of a real life snake preacher. Manners later noted that [...] "he had gone to church as a child and handled snakes." ...|$|E
500|$|We {{had just}} done with [...] "Since U Been Gone," [...] which {{everyone}} was happy with. We sent a rough version of [...] "Behind These Hazel Eyes," [...] without any lyrics, to Kelly and Clive Davis. It {{was in part}} an olive branch to Kelly, because there was miscommunication on [...] "Since U Been Gone," [...] where Kelly had written some lyrics and Max and I didn't know about it and we had finished the song. So we wanted to write [...] "Behind" [...] with her from the beginning, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> in different places. She had just won [...] "American Idol" [...] and was on tour, so she'd e-mail me lyrics, and I'd e-mail her my thoughts.|$|E
500|$|Ray Charles was 28years old in 1958, {{with ten}} years of {{experience}} recording primarily rhythm and blues music for the Downbeat and Swingtime record labels, in a style {{similar to that of}} Nat King Cole and Charles Brown. Charles signed with Atlantic Records in 1954 where producers Ahmet Ertegun and Jerry Wexler encouraged him to broaden his repertoire. Wexler would later remember that Atlantic Records' success came not from the artists' experience, but the enthusiasm for the music: [...] "We didn't know shit about making records, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> having fun". Ertegun and Wexler found that a hands-off approach was the best way of encouraging Charles. Wexler later said, [...] "I realized the best thing I could do with Ray was leave him alone".|$|E

500|$|At Copenhagen, {{the venue}} for the 2000 UEFA Cup Final, both Arsenal and Galatasaray played {{out to a}} goalless draw in normal and in extra time. Arsenal lost 4–1 in a penalty shootout, with striker Davor Šuker and midfielder Patrick Vieira hitting the post and {{underside}} of the crossbar respectively. Wenger reflected on the defeat by saying, [...] "We did not play well in the first half, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> much better afterwards. It is very disappointing." [...] The final was overshadowed by events at the city centre, where Arsenal supporter Paul Dineen was stabbed in the back. Referred to as the [...] "Battle of Copenhagen", the incident escalated into a riot between English and Turkish fans, forcing the Danish police to use tear gas in order to restore calm.|$|E
500|$|Noel Murray from The A.V. Club graded {{the episode}} with an A-; he praised the [...] "fine job" [...] of director/writer Akiva Goldsman, and thought the climax was [...] "extraordinarily well-shot and performed". IGN's Ramsey Isler rated the episode 9.2/10, writing that it [...] "is {{a classic example}} of a story you have to be patient with. This was an episode with a compelling, {{shocking}} start that kept us hooked well enough to deal with some slow points {{in the rest of the}} first half-hour. <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> rewarded for our patience with one heck of a climax and epilogue. This was well-executed TV". Andrew Hanson from the Los Angeles Times thought that while the first half wasn't very exciting, the second half had [...] "plenty to keep up interest" [...] as more was revealed about Olivia and Walter's backgrounds.|$|E
500|$|Faye Marsay, who {{portrayed the}} Waif, spoke about her scenes and filming with Williams, saying, [...] " [...] I {{think we did}} a month in Belfast before we started shooting. We went into the stunt tent and lived there. It was choreographed like a dance. Maisie is so well coordinated and good at what she does. I'm {{a little bit less}} coordinated and easily pissed off. I would drop the stick down and go, [...] "I can't do it!" [...] And she would {{encourage}} me. She's so supportive. We did a month, and then the day before the cameras turned on, we would go through the moves a couple of times so we wouldn't hurt each other. There were a few times we clipped each other. I remember getting her in the stomach really bad one time, and she nearly cut my ear off at one point. It was fun. It was a lot of fun, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> exhausted as well." ...|$|E
