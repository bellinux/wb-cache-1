40|$|Abstract Background Exome {{sequencing}} {{has transformed}} human genetic analysis and may {{do the same}} for other vertebrate model systems. However, a major challenge is sifting through the large number of sequence variants to identify the causative mutation for a given phenotype. In models like Xenopus tropicalis, an incomplete and occasionally incorrect genome assembly compounds this problem. To facilitate cloning of X. tropicalis mutants identified in forward genetic screens, we sought to combine <b>bulk</b> <b>segregant</b> <b>analysis</b> and exome sequencing into a single step. Results Here we report the first use of exon capture sequencing to identify mutations in a non-mammalian, vertebrate model. We demonstrate that <b>bulk</b> <b>segregant</b> <b>analysis</b> coupled with exon capture sequencing is not only able to identify causative mutations but can also generate linkage information, facilitate the assembly of scaffolds, identify misassembles, and discover thousands of SNPs for fine mapping. Conclusion Exon capture sequencing and <b>bulk</b> <b>segregant</b> <b>analysis</b> is a rapid, inexpensive method to clone mutants identified in forward genetic screens. With sufficient meioses, this method can be generalized to any model system with a genome assembly, polished or unpolished, and in the latter case, it also provides many critical genomic resources. </p...|$|R

Two bulked DNA samples are generated from a segregating population from a single cross.

Bulked samples of S. bicolor, typical flowering S. halepense, non-flowering tetraploid putative Sorghum spp. hybrids, and triploid putative Sorghum spp. hybrids were surveyed to identify both unique markers specific to each bulk and markers indicative of S. bicolor genetic material introgressed into the Sorghum spp. hybrids. Results: Thirty-nine and 23 markers were found to be unique to the S. bicolor and typical flowering S. halepense bulks, respectively. These unique markers could be utilized in breeding programs to identify interspecific hybrids. A subset of 23 unique SSRs were found in the non-flowering tetraploid putative Sorghum spp. hybrid, and they may be useful in the characterization of the non-flowering phenotype.

The WGR-based quantitative trait loci mapping approach developed in soybean combines single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) discovery, validation and genotyping and {{has the potential to}} identify candidate genes and causal SNPs without a time-consuming fine-mapping process.

With the advent of molecular genetic markers such as RFLPs and, more recently, RAPDs, it has become possible to generate an extensive linkage map through the analysis of a single cross. This project utilizes a single reciprocal F 2 cross between two pea inbred lines (A 1078 - 234 and PI 179449) to integrate a combination of classical Mendelian and modern molecular characters (morphological traits, isozymes, RFLPs [restriction fragment length polymorphisms] {{and a large number}} of newly generated RAPDs [random amplified polymorphic DNA]). To develop the RAPD data set efficiently, primer surveys were first performed to detect variation between the two parental lines. Primers producing polymorphisms were then used to scan 56 F 2 progeny. After 100 RAPD bands were obtained, <b>bulk</b> <b>segregant</b> <b>analysis</b> was used to find the precise location of four previously unassigned phytochromeregulated genetic loci (denoted Pea 25, Pea 207, Pea 2 l 5 and Pea 315).

One hundred twenty-nine markers were placed on the seven linkage groups of pea: 40 dominant markers derived from the A 1078 - 234 parent ("A" characters), 72 dominant markers derived from the PI 179449 parent ("P" characters), and 17 codominant markers. All linkage groups have "A," "P," and codominant characters except I and VI, which have only "P" characters and a codominant marker. There are also nine unlinked blocks that include a total of 35 markers: two codominant characters and 33 RAPDs. <b>Bulk</b> <b>segregant</b> <b>analysis</b> provided evidence that Pea 207 and Pea 315 reside in linkage groups II and III, respectively.

Analyzing the genome sequence of CBS 5557 revealed 955 nonconservative missense substi-tutions, and 61 potential loss-of-function variants including 47 frameshift indels, 13 early stopcodons, and 1 splice site mutation.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Analysis of mutants {{isolated}} from forward-genetic screens has revealed {{key components of}} several plant signalling pathways. Mapping mutations by position, either using classical methods or whole genome high-throughput sequencing (HTS), largely relies on the analysis of genome-wide polymorphisms in F 2 recombinant populations. Combining <b>bulk</b> <b>segregant</b> <b>analysis</b> with HTS has accelerated the identification of causative mutations and has been widely adopted in many research programmes. A major advantage of HTS {{is the ability to}} perform <b>bulk</b> <b>segregant</b> <b>analysis</b> after back-crossing to the parental line rather than out-crossing to a polymorphic ecotype, which reduces genetic complexity and avoids issues with phenotype penetrance in different ecotypes. Plotting the positions of homozygous polymorphisms in a mutant genome identifies areas of low recombination and is an effective way to detect molecular linkage to a phenotype of interest. RESULTS: We describe the use of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) density plots as a mapping strategy to identify and refine chromosomal positions of causative mutations from screened plant populations. We developed a web application called CandiSNP that generates density plots from user-provided SNP data obtained from HTS. Candidate causative mutations, defined as SNPs causing non-synonymous changes in annotated coding regions are highlighted on the plots and listed in a table. We use data generated from a recent mutant screen in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana as proof-of-concept for the validity of our tool. CONCLUSIONS: CandiSNP is a user-friendly application that will aid in novel discoveries from forward-genetic mutant screens. It is particularly useful for analysing HTS data from bulked back-crossed mutants, which contain fewer polymorphisms than data generated from out-crosses.

40|$|Creating Saccharomyces yeasts {{capable of}} {{efficient}} fermentation of pentoses such as xylose remains a key {{challenge in the}} production of ethanol from lignocellulosic biomass. Metabolic engineering of industrial Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains has yielded xylose-fermenting strains, but these strains have not yet achieved industrial viability due largely to xylose fermentation being prohibitively slower than that of glucose.

Uncovering the genetic architecture of such strains will shed further light on xylose metabolism, suggesting additional engineering approaches or possibly even enabling the development of xylose-fermenting yeasts that are not genetically modified. We previously identified a hybrid yeast strain, the genome of which is largely Saccharomyces uvarum, which has the ability to grow on xylose as the sole carbon source. To circumvent the sterility of this hybrid strain, we developed a novel method to genetically characterize its xylose-utilization phenotype, using a tetraploid intermediate, followed by <b>bulk</b> <b>segregant</b> <b>analysis</b> in conjunction with high-throughput sequencing.

30|$|In {{order to}} locate the {{position}} of the rel 2 on the rice chromosomes, 162 SSR (simple sequence repeat) markers and 37 InDel (insertion and deletion) markers were obtained from the rice GRAMENE database ([URL] and (Shen et al. 2004). These markers were distributed evenly on rice 12 chromosomes and polymorphism between Nipponbare and Kasalath was displayed. Two pools (normal pool and mutant pool) were constructed by using equal amount of DNA of WT and F 2 mutant with 10 individuals for each. The polymorphic markers screened in <b>bulk</b> <b>segregant</b> <b>analysis</b> (BSA) (Michelmore et al. 1991) were used for linkage analysis and molecular mapping. 94 mutant individuals from F 2 were used for primary mapping. For fine mapping, a larger population with 882 mutant individuals from F 2 was used. All the PCR products were analyzed by 8 ¬†% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} was carried out to {{evaluate}} two inbred lines of grain sorghum for their environmental stress tolerance (salinity) at the field. These two inbred lines were chosen as salt tolerant (ATX 631) and salt sensitive (ICSR 89038) for hybridization to obtain the F 1 generation and then selfed to obtain the F 2 generation. These contrasting genotypes and their F 1 and F 2 generations were utilized to detect DNA-based molecular markers associated with salt tolerance via RAPD and ISSR techniques, following the <b>bulked</b> <b>segregant</b> <b>analysis.</b> This analysis revealed some genetic markers associated with salt tolerance in grain sorghum that can be utilized during breeding programs via marker-assisted selection...|$|E
30|$|The {{next-generation}} sequencing-based <b>bulked</b> <b>segregant</b> <b>analysis</b> method (BSA-seq) {{was used}} to map the BPH resistance gene. A pair of bulks of individuals with opposite extreme phenotypes (extremely-resistant bulk consisting of 15 or 17 lines vs. extremely-susceptible bulk consisting of 16 or 18 lines) was selected {{from each of the}} two F 2 : 3 populations, and genomic DNA pools of the four bulks were prepared. The DNA pools as well as the DNA of the three parents were deeply (~[*] 20 √ó) sequenced on the platform of Hiseq X Ten. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and short-InDel markers were identified based on the sequencing data, and gene mapping was conducted using the markers.|$|E
40|$|Identification of the sex-determining {{genes of}} the Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) has {{important}} implications for commercial aquaculture. We previously identified an XX/XY sex-determining locus in this species within a 10 -cM interval between markers GM 201 and UNH 995 on linkage group one (LG 1). In order to refine this region, we developed new AFLP markers using <b>bulked</b> <b>segregant</b> <b>analysis</b> of the mapping families. We identified three AFLP markers that showed a sex-specific pattern of segregation. All three mapped near, but just outside, the previously identified sex-determining region on LG 1. Hybridization of BAC clones containing these markers to chromosome spreads confirmed that the XX/XY sex-determining locus is on one of the small chromosomes in O. niloticus (R√©sum√© d'auteur...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAmerican foulbrood (AFB) is {{a severe}} brood disease in honeybees. Since {{sustainable}} treatment is not available, selection of genetically resistant honeybee stock is highly desirable. Using {{a set of}} 291 heterozygous microsatellite markers in a <b>bulk</b> <b>segregant</b> <b>analysis</b> with subsequent finemapping of haploid drone offspring from a single honeybee queen, we identified one significant and three suggestive quantitative trait loci {{as well as one}} significant epistatic interaction influencing prepupal survival after AFB infection. While {{we were not able to}} verify specific genes responsible for tolerance, we suggest that developmental genes may have played an important role. The identified markers can be used as regions of interest in future mapping or expression studies. In order to use them for marker-assisted selection in breeding programmes for AFB-resistant honeybee stock, it will be required to evaluate these loci more extensively under variable experimental conditions...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{genetic and}} {{developmental}} basis of many ecologically important floral traits (e. g., carotenoid pigmentation, corolla tube structure, nectar volume, pistil and stamen length) remains poorly understood. Here we analyze a chemically induced floral mutant ofMimulus lewisii through <b>bulk</b> <b>segregant</b> <b>analysis</b> and transgenic experiments and identify aMIXTA-like R 2 R 3 MYB gene that controls nectar guide formation in M. lewisii flowers, which involves epidermal cell development and carotenoid pigmentation. THE rapid adaptive radiation of the. 250, 000 species offlowering plants has produced an astonishing diversity of flower morphology. Uncovering the genetic basis (i. e., genes and genetic pathways/networks) of floral trait varia-tion {{is a fundamental}} step toward understanding the origin and evolution of these ‚Äúendless forms ‚Äù (Darwin 1859). Flo-ral trait diversification is often thought to be driven princi-pally by plant‚Äìpollinator interactions (Darwin 1862; Gran...|$|R
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} identify markers linked to Fusarium wilt disease resistance, Parents namely TTB 7 and ICP 8863 were screened using 151 SSRs markers and 16 AFLP primer combinations. Parental screening revealed five SSR primers and 12 AFLP primer combinations polymorphic between parents. <b>Bulk</b> <b>segregant</b> <b>analysis</b> identified five AFLP primer combinations generating seven markers polymorphic between resistant and susceptible bulks while, none of the SSR markers were polymorphic. This indicates that, these markers are putatively linked to wilt disease. Screening of F 2 segregating population of cross TTB 7 x ICP 8863 with these putatively linked markers revealed four markers (E-AAT/M-CTG 850, ETCG/M-CTT 650, E-TCG/M-CTA 730 and E-TCG/M-CTT 230) which segregated in 3 : 1 mendelian pattern. Simple linear regression performed on these four markers had identified two markers namely E-TCG/M-CTT 650 and E-TCG/M-CTA 730 linked to disease...|$|R
