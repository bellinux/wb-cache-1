40|$|Fusarium graminearum species complex (FGSC) causes Fusarium {{head blight}} in small grain cereals. To date, four species (F. graminearum, F. asiaticum, F. boothii, and F. meridionale) {{belonging}} to FGSC frequently occur in Korean cereals. In addition, we first reported {{the occurrence of}} additional species (F. vorosii) within FGSC, which was isolated from <b>barley,</b> <b>corn,</b> and rice in Korea. Phylogenetic analysis of the Fusarium isolates of this group using combined multi-gene sequences confirmed species identification. Moreover, the macroconidia produced by these isolates were morphologically {{similar to those of}} the F. vorosii holotype. Chemical analysis indicated that the F. vorosii isolates produced various trichothecenes such as nivalenol and deoxynivalenol with their acetyl derivatives along with zearalenone. Pathogenicity tests demonstrated that all of the F. vorosii isolates examined were pathogenic on <b>barley,</b> <b>corn,</b> and rice with variation in aggressiveness.

5000|$|Carbohydrates {{provide a}} quick energy source, {{increased}} palatability {{as well as}} fiber in canine diets; if disaccharides and xylitol are avoided. In an ingredient label, starch (a complex carbohydrate) may appear as rice, wheat, <b>barley,</b> <b>corn</b> and/or other varying grains.

Direct carbohydrate levels are not displayed on feed labels due to the inaccuracy of current testing methods and varying methods in which certain sources may effect an animal's glycemic response. However, for canines it has been demonstrated that rice has the greatest blood glucose response followed by wheat, <b>barley,</b> <b>corn</b> and sorghum. Diets containing rice or wheat should be blended with some low level carbohydrate sources like (sorghum or barley) to prevent an animal's blood glucose from spiking.|$|R
