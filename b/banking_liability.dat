Our analysis brings out the significance of liability allocation and of the effect of deposit strategies as a primary source of funding.

40|$|This paper {{explains}} the continuing success of European cooperative banks through evolving comparative advantages. It {{points out that}} a cooperative is built around an intergenerational endowment without final owners, which creates particular governance challenges. Risks {{include the use of}} the endowment for purposes other than members'' best interest, such as empire-building, and attempts at appropriation. The risk of empire-building is reinforced by mechanisms that foster capital accumulation and asymmetric opportunities for consolidation. The paper concludes that some form of independent external oversight of corporate governance is warranted and that cooperatives need mechanisms enabling them to better manage their capital.

40|$|The {{liability}} of banks in electronic fund transfer (EFT) transactions {{is discussed in}} this thesis under the British and the United States law. The thesis covers banks’ liability in electronic credit and debit transfers. It covers banks’ liability in Electronic Fund Transfer at the Point Of Sale (EFTPOS), Automatic Teller Machines (ATM) and home and office <b>banking.</b> <b>Liability</b> of banks in credit card transactions and cheque truncation falls {{outside the scope of}} this thesis. In the absence of British legislation in this area, an analogy is made with the traditional methods of payment. An attempt is also made to extract the applicable rules from the general principles of law and the banking practice. The discussion, under the United States law, relies on analysing the Electronic Fund Transfer Act of 1978 and Article 4 A of the Uniform Commercial Code, which concern banks’ liability in consumer and commercially based EFT transactions. The thesis starts by analysing the legal nature of payment orders. In particular, whether a payment order is a negotiable instrument, a creation of trust funds, an assignation or merely a mandate from a customer to his bank. Chapter two discusses banks’ liability for failure to make an EFT transaction. This encompasses banks’ liability for complete failure to effect an EFT transaction and for improper implementation of such a transaction. Chapter three discusses the right to stop payment, completion of payment, irrevocability and banks’ liability for failure to stop payment. Chapter four discusses banks’ liability for erroneous EFT transactions. This includes allocation of losses resulting from errors in payment orders and errors committed by banks during the execution process of such orders. Chapter five discusses banks’ liability for unauthorised EFT transactions. Issues such as authentication of payment orders, security measures adopted by banks and allocation of losses resulting from unauthorised transactions are discussed in this chapter. Chapter six discusses the recoverability of damages for banks’ failure to implement customers’ instructions properly. It discusses what measures of damages are applicable in certain situations such as banks’ complete failure to make an EFT transaction, failure to transfer funds on time etc. The thesis is completed by summary and conclusion...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} modern {{readers to}} the basic understanding of the banking system that was held by academics and practitioners {{in the early years}} of the 20 th century – that is, to traditional banking theory. This theory is completely inconsistent with the theoretic framework that views banks as financial intermediaries that receive deposits and invest those deposits in assets. Thus, this paper first sets forth in detail the basic elements of traditional banking theory and then relates those elements to the modern network effects literature. From this a bank-centered view of the money market is derived: all demand and short-term <b>bank</b> <b>liabilities,</b> including contingent liabilities, are potential money and nearmoney assets, and any non-bank liabilities that have monetary properties will derive them from their relationship with the banking system. This framework is then used to evaluate modern money markets, and this paper finds that indeed the so-called market-based money market in fact functions as a means of reallocating the <b>bank</b> <b>liabilities</b> held (indirectly) by the public from deposits to wholesale and contingent <b>bank</b> <b>liabilities.</b> This paper proposes that bank liability-based measures of the money supply be developed, and that regulators recognize that contingent <b>bank</b> <b>liabilities</b> often function as a substitute for deposits and should be regulated similarly...|$|R

30|$|As {{noted in}} the Introduction, Ireland {{was one of the}} {{countries}} worst affected by the Great Recession, with output falling by over 10 % in real terms between 2008 and 2010 and unemployment more than doubling over the same period. The effects of the global recession felt elsewhere were compounded in Ireland by the bursting of a property bubble and the subsequent collapse of output and employment in construction-related sectors. Because bank lending was so highly concentrated in construction, Irish banks experienced huge losses and the government decided to guarantee all <b>bank</b> <b>liabilities</b> in 2008. However, continued falling tax revenue and exposure to <b>bank</b> <b>liabilities</b> resulted in the government deficit going from almost zero in 2008 to 13.9 % in 2010 and to a remarkable 30.8 % in 2011, when banking losses crystallised.

40|$|In this paper, I {{discuss the}} {{influence}} of the <b>banking</b> industry’s <b>liability</b> structure on the FDIC’s risk exposure, the relationship between this exposure and the assessment base, and various ways that the FDIC could incorporate the effects of <b>bank</b> <b>liability</b> structure into its price for deposit insurance. For most of the industry, I find that the FDIC’s risk exposure increases when banks move from domestic deposits to other funding sources because decreases in assessment income associated with a smaller assessment base are not offset by reductions in the FDIC’s exposure to loss. However, {{this may not be the}} case for banks that rely heavily on unsecured credits due to the benefits of market discipline. I outline three ways to incorporate <b>bank</b> <b>liability</b> structure into the FDIC’s pricing policy for deposit insurance: 1) change the assessment base; 2) adjust the pricing matrix; and 3) price directly for risk. I conclude that no such changes should be made in isolation.

40|$|The {{financial}} crisis has highlighted {{the importance of}} various channels of financial contagion across countries. This paper first presents stylized facts of international banking activities during the crisis.

Cascade effects can be triggered by bank losses or contractions of interbank lending activities. As a result of shocks on assets or on <b>liabilities</b> of <b>banks,</b> a global deleveraging of international banking activities can occur. Simple simulations are presented to illustrate {{the use of the}} model and the relative importance of contagion channels, relying on bank losses of advanced countries’ banking systems during the {{financial crisis}} to calibrate the shock. The outcome of the simulations is compared with the deleveraging observed during the crisis suggesting that leverage is a major determinant of financial contagion.
