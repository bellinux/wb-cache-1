5000|$|The name [...] "Dairy Science Park" [...] {{was coined}} in 2010 in Cairo, Egypt jointly by Abdul Rahman Ilyas, {{who was then}} chief {{operating}} officer of the agri-science park of ICRISAT, India, and Muhammad Subhan Qureshi, during their discussion on productive utilization of the livestock resources of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Initially, the idea of Dairy Science Park had emerged from Chief Minister’s Livestock Development Plan, which was prepared by Muhammad Subhan Qureshi in 1998 on advice of the Chief Minister Sardar Mehtab Abbasi. Later in 2003, Qureshi's plan was also approved by the Chief Minister Akram Khan Durrani. In 2011, a series of international workshops on Dairy Science Park was started at the University of Agriculture, Peshawar. In 2014, Dairy Science Park gave birth to Peshawar Meat Company, and soon afterwards, Livestock Business Facilitation Desk of Dairy Science Park (LBFD-DSP) was inaugurated at Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chamber of Commerce and Industry by the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa agriculture minister Ikramullah Khan Gandapur. In November 2016, Dairy Science Park signed an MoU on [...] "Collaborative <b>Biorisk</b> <b>Management</b> Initiative" [...] with the University of Agriculture, Peshawar, Khyber Medical University, and the Higher Education Commission of Pakistan.|$|E

40|$|Laboratory {{response}} networks (LRNs) {{have been}} established for security reasons in several countries including the Netherlands, France, and Sweden. LRNs function in these countries as a preparedness measure for a coordinated diagnostic response capability {{in case of a}} bioterrorism incident or other biocrimes. Generally, these LRNs are organized on a national level. The EU project AniBioThreat has identified the need for an integrated European LRN to strengthen preparedness against animal bioterrorism. One task of the AniBioThreat project is to suggest a plan to implement laboratory <b>biorisk</b> <b>management</b> CWA 15793 : 2011 (CWA 15793), a management system built on the principle of continual improvement through the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle. The implementation of CWA 15793 can facilitate trust and credibility in a future European LRN and is an assurance that the work done at the laboratories is performed in a structured way with continuous improvements. As a first step, a gap analysis was performed to establish the current compliance status of biosafety and laboratory biosecurity management with CWA 15793 in 5 AniBioThreat partner institutes in France (ANSES), the Netherlands (CVI and RIVM), and Sweden (SMI and SVA). All 5 partners are national and/or international laboratory reference institutes in the field of public or animal health and possess highcontainment laboratories and animal facilities. The gap analysis showed that the participating institutes already have robust <b>biorisk</b> <b>management</b> programs in place, but several gaps were identified that need to be addressed. Despite differences between the participating institutes in their compliance status, these variations are not significant. <b>Biorisk</b> <b>management</b> exercises also have been identified as a useful tool to control compliance status and thereby implementation of CWA 15793. An exercise concerning an insider threat and loss of a biological agent was performed at SVA in the AniBioThreat project to evaluate implementation of the contingency plans and as an activity in the implementation process of CWA 15793. The outcome of the exercise was perceived as very useful, and improvements to enhance biorisk preparedness were identified. Gap analyses and exercises are important, useful activities to facilitate implementation of CWA 15793. The PDCA cycle will enforce a structured way to work, with continual improvements concerning <b>biorisk</b> <b>management</b> activities. Based on the activities in the AniBioThreat project, the following requirements are uggested to promote implementation: support from the top management of the organizations, knowledge about CWA 15793, a compliance audit checklist and gap analysis, training and exercises, networking in LRNs and other networks, and interinstitutional audits. Implementation of CWA 15793 at each institute would strengthen the European animal bioterrorism response capabilities by establishing a well-prepared LRN...|$|E

40|$|The International Perspectives on Mitigating Laboratory Biorisks workshop, {{held at the}} Renaissance Polat Istanbul Hotel in Istanbul, Republic of Turkey, from October 25 to 27, 2010, {{sought to}} promote {{discussion}} between experts and stakeholders {{from around the world}} on issues related to the management of biological risk in laboratories. The event was organized by Sandia National Laboratories International Biological Threat Reduction program, on behalf of the US Department of State Biosecurity Engagement Program and the US Department of Defense Cooperative Biological Engagement Program. The workshop came about as a response to US Under Secretary of State Ellen O. Tauscher's statements in Geneva on December 9, 2009, during the Annual Meeting of the States Parties to the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC). Pursuant to those remarks, the workshop was intended to provide a forum for interested countries to share information on <b>biorisk</b> <b>management</b> training, standards, and needs. Over the course of the meeting's three days, participants discussed diverse topics such as the role of risk assessment in laboratory <b>biorisk</b> <b>management,</b> strategies for mitigating risk, measurement of performance and upkeep, international standards, training and building workforce competence, and the important role of government and regulation. The meeting concluded with affirmations of the utility of international cooperation in this sphere and recognition of positive prospects for the future. The workshop was organized as a series of short presentations by international experts on the field of <b>biorisk</b> <b>management,</b> followed by breakout sessions in which participants were divided into four groups and urged to discuss a particular topic {{with the aid of a}} facilitator and a set of guiding questions. Rapporteurs were present during the plenary session as well as breakout sessions and in particular were tasked with taking notes during discussions and reporting back to the assembled participants a brief summary of points discussed. The presentations and breakout sessions were divided into five topic areas: 'Challenges in Biorisk Management,' 'Risk Assessment and Mitigation Measures,' 'Biorisk Management System Performance,' 'Training,' and 'National Oversight and Regulations. ' The topics and questions were chosen by the organizers through consultation with US Government sponsors.

40|$|The {{object of}} the study was to {{determine}} the ratio of incidence and genotyping of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection with reference to different typable and untypable strains in various populations of Mirpur, Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK). This was done by taking into account different modalities with reference to gender, age and socio-economic perspective. A total of 88 patients were included in the studyand the screening was initially carried out by rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) with further confirmation by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. The real time PCR (qPCR) was performed at Genetic and Molecular Center, Lahore. These tests were done at Biosafety Level 2 (BSL 2) laboratory (according to <b>Biorisk</b> <b>Management</b> CWA 15793 - 2008) which was the criteria determined by risk assessment performed by principal investigator and the scientificofficer of the facility. The genotype 3 a was found to be the most common type in affected patients which certainly determined the management of these infections in a more targeted manner. The study was able to determine the prevalence rate on gender basis which was important on local basis and can be the basis to initiate the study for finding out the reasons for the same. The age group most affected was found to be in the younger group. In addition, introduction of <b>Biorisk</b> <b>Management</b> was very encouraging and the professionals showed keen interest in this scientific discipline and were eager to learn the key concepts of it...|$|E

40|$|Excerpt from preface: The present {{collection}} of articles follows from a one-day seminar The Biological Weapons Convention, Biosecurity and the Industry organised by the Belgian Foreign Ministry in Brussels on 20 June 2011. Among the attendants were Belgian and European {{representatives from the}} life sciences, the biosafety and -security community, and the pharmaceutical industry, as well as Belgian Government officials involved with disarmament. Ambassador Paul van den IJssel, President-Designate of the 7 th BTWC Review Conference, closed the proceedings. One of the seminar’s central themes was to investigate how the life sciences industry – one core stakeholder remaining wholly {{in the background of}} the discussions {{on the future of the}} BTWC – could become more involved. Speakers from the aforementioned communities zoomed in on industrial standards for biosafety and biosecurity being developed for laboratories in research and industry facilities as a possible point of entry. In follow up to the seminar, the idea arose to explore this lesser-known opportunity in more detail and highlight its possibilities and limitations from three different perspectives: <b>biorisk</b> <b>management,</b> industry practice and government responsibility in formal disarmament. The Belgian Royal Institute for International Relations Egmont agreed to publish the contributions in its Egmont Papers series in collaboration with the European Union Institute for Security Studies...|$|E
