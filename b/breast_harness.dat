5|$|Horse collar: A {{significant}} {{improvement of the}} ancient <b>breast</b> <b>harness</b> was the horse collar. The horse collar was depicted in a Northern Wei (386–534) mural at Dunhuang, China, dated 477–499; the latter artwork does not feature the essential collar cushion behind the cross bar, though, while a later Tang Dynasty (618–907) mural of about 851 accurately displays the cushioned collar behind the cross bar. An earlier painting of the Sui Dynasty (581–618) accurately depicted the horse collar as it is seen today, yet the illustration shows its use on a camel instead of a horse.|$|E
5|$|Pigeon {{photography}} is an aerial photography technique invented in 1907 by the German apothecary Julius Neubronner, who also used pigeons to deliver medications. A homing pigeon was fitted with an aluminium <b>breast</b> <b>harness</b> {{to which a}} lightweight time-delayed miniature camera could be attached. Neubronner's German patent application was initially rejected, but was granted in December 1908 after he produced authenticated photographs taken by his pigeons. He publicized the technique at the 1909 Dresden International Photographic Exhibition, and sold some images as postcards at the Frankfurt International Aviation Exhibition and at the 1910 and 1911 Paris Air Shows.|$|E
2500|$|The throat-girth {{design was}} not {{improved}} until the Chinese breast-strap or [...] "breastcollar" [...] harness {{developed during the}} Warring States (481–221 BC) era in China. The Chinese <b>breast</b> <b>harness</b> became known throughout Central Asia by the 7th century, introduced to Europe by the 8th century.|$|E
50|$|Multiple {{evolutions}} from classical <b>harness</b> (Antiquity), to <b>breast</b> strap <b>harness</b> (6th century) {{to horse}} collar (9th century), allowed more horse pulling power, such as with heavy ploughs.|$|R
40|$|The {{harnessing}} {{guidelines for}} donkeys pulling a single donkey cart {{are based on}} practices from Europe which are adapted {{to the situation in}} many African countries. The basic principles remain the same, anatomy of the donkey and criteria for a donkey harness, but the concept is to make a comfortable harness from locally available materials. The most simple pulling device is opted for, the <b>breast</b> strap <b>harness.</b> Examples are given how to measure the size of the straps and how to make the <b>breast</b> strap <b>harness,</b> keeping in mind the necessary animal comfort. Cheap saddles and breaking devices are also described and a few examples of single donkey carts from Kenya and West Africa are included...|$|R
40|$|Harness in Antiquity: The Prestige of Scientific Error. The work of Commander Lefebvre des Noettes and {{particular}} his hypothesis of the defectiveness of ancient harnesses, was very influential {{even though his}} analysis was technically false. After having situated the commander- a local erudite who took advantage of his early retirement to specialize {{in an area that}} had been little explored up until that time- in historical context, this article takes up the refutations that began in 1960 and became especially forceful due to the work of J. Spruytte in 1977. There was not one, but rather several ancient harnesses and the evolution towards modern techniques (shafts, collars, and <b>breast</b> <b>harnesses)</b> began in Antiquity. The commander's theories were accepted for so long and their refutation so little recognized in France because they reinforced the idea of "antiquity's technical block". The paper investi gates the birth of this concept and the reasons why it encountered so much success in France. The evolution of different historical schools giving special place to ancient history allows us to better understand why people pondered the causes of "technical block" without throwing the concept itself into question. It is as if ancient history had to have particular status and could not be considered part of the long procession of history. Amouretti Marie-Claire. L'attelage dans l'Antiquité.

50|$|Though a rope harness is not {{normally}} used to bind the limbs, {{they can be}} used for that purpose by simply going around the arms not under. A rope dress can be used with a crotch rope or a shinju ("pearl") <b>breast</b> <b>harness.</b>|$|E

50|$|Cavalry {{tactics in}} China were {{enhanced}} by {{the invention of the}} saddle-attached stirrup by at least the 4th century, as the oldest reliable depiction of a rider with paired stirrups was found in a Jin Dynasty tomb of the year 322 AD. The Chinese invention of the horse collar by the 5th century was also a great improvement from the <b>breast</b> <b>harness,</b> allowing the horse to haul greater weight without heavy burden on its skeletal structure.|$|E
