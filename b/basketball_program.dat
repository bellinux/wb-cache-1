5|$|The University of Michigan {{basketball}} scandal or Ed Martin scandal was {{a series}} of National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) rules violations that resulted in a six-year investigation {{of the relationship between the}} University of Michigan, its men's <b>basketball</b> <b>program,</b> and basketball team booster Ed Martin. As a result of the investigation, the Wolverine men's <b>basketball</b> <b>program</b> was punished with sanctions. The violations principally involved payments booster Martin made to several players to launder money from an illegal gambling operation. It is one of the largest incidents involving payments to college athletes in American collegiate history. An initial investigation by the school was joined by the NCAA, Big Ten Conference, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and the United States Department of Justice (DOJ).|$|E

5|$|The precise {{founding}} of the Gophers men's <b>basketball</b> <b>program</b> at the University of Minnesota is somewhat nebulous. Unlike many other universities with later foundations, the team did not form as a conscious act of the campus administration. The University's student newspaper at the time, the Ariel, reported on basketball throughout 1895 as the sport {{was introduced to the}} campus from a rival school, Minnesota A in St. Paul, later incorporated into the larger University of Minnesota Twin Cities. In 1896, a team from the school began to participate in a league with the Agriculture school, YMCA teams, and other local associations. The establishment of the Armory on-campus gave the team a new place to play. In February 1897, L. J. Cooke, a director of the Minneapolis YMCA, was hired on a part-time basis to coach the <b>basketball</b> <b>program,</b> and became the full-time coach and director of physical education by the fall of that year. Cooke {{was one of the first}} full-time professional coaches in all of college basketball and would remain at the program for 28 seasons.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of public and alumni demand for a {{basketball}} team, Michigan fielded a team {{of members of the}} then-current student body and achieved a 1–4 record for the 1908–09 season. However, after three years of demanding a <b>basketball</b> <b>program,</b> the student body did not attend the games and the program was terminated due to low attendance. Basketball returned in 1917 in what was considered the inaugural season of varsity basketball. The team was coached by Elmer Mitchell who instituted the intramural sports program at Michigan. The team finished 6–12 overall (0–10, Big Ten). The following year Mitchell led the team to a 16–8 (5–5) record.|$|E
