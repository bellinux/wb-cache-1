25|$|The {{evolutionary}} history is finished. The endeavour is complete. If you'd asked me 20 years ago whether we'd be attempting such a mammoth task, I'd have said 'Don't be ridiculous'. These programmes tell a particular story and I'm sure others will {{come along and}} tell it much <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> but I do hope that if people watch it in 50 years' time, it will still {{have something to say}} about the world we live in.|$|E
500|$|The Cars did not {{add a new}} bassist to {{the lineup}} to replace Orr; instead, the album's bass parts were {{programmed}} or performed by Hawkes and Lee, with Hawkes playing a bass once owned by Orr. While Ocasek and Orr split vocal duties on past albums, Ocasek sings lead on all the tracks from Move Like This. In a Rolling Stone interview, Ocasek said, [...] "I was aware that on half of the new songs, Ben would have done <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> But we never wanted anybody from the outside." [...] Orr was given special thanks in the liner notes: [...] "Ben, your spirit was {{with us on this}} one." ...|$|E
500|$|Other {{critics were}} more negative. Rolling Stone called it [...] "mundane...with a {{predictable}} script", {{and at one}} point described Simpson's singing as [...] "wailing in lieu of hitting notes". [...] In its review, the BBC said that [...] "half the album ... feels self indulgent and lacks substance", but also said that [...] "in between the formulaic, innocuous songs are a smattering of catchy pop-rock tracks." [...] IGN.com called it [...] "by-the-books, generic (and at times bland) pop/rock", although it did say Simpson's vocals showed maturity and promise. A writer for Stylus magazine commented that [...] "after spending more than forty minutes with Ashlee, I feel like I don’t know her any <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> beforehand... for a record with the name Autobiography, it seems like no bigger criticism could be leveled." [...] The New York Times said that Autobiography [...] "is a thoroughly calculated package, aiming for the same audience that embraces Avril Lavigne and Pink." ...|$|E

2500|$|An then faced {{rising star}} and {{eventual}} tournament finalist Hifumi Abe {{in his second}} fight. An gained a shido with just a minute left, therefore sealing Abe's win and ending An's vie for a medal. An competed with Korea in the teams competition, where he won bronze. This {{would be his last}} junior tournament. He was quoted saying, [...] "I was in good condition and fought <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> in the individual event. ...I am excited and nervous about moving up to fight in the senior circuit.” ...|$|E
2500|$|This {{confirmed}} Thérèse {{in her own}} intuitions. She wrote, [...] "My {{soul was}} like a book which the priest read <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> He launched me full sail on the waves of confidence and love which held such an attraction for me, but upon which I had not dared to venture. He {{told me that my}} faults did not offend God." [...] Her spiritual life drew more and more on the Gospels that she carried with her at all times. The piety of her time was fed more on commentaries, but Thérèse had asked Céline to get the Gospels and the Epistles of St Paul bound into a single small volume which she could carry on her heart. She said, [...] "But it is especially the Gospels which sustain me during my hours of prayer, for in them I find what is necessary for my poor little soul. I am constantly discovering in them new lights, hidden and mysterious meanings." ...|$|E

"…Documents {{found in}} my files {{allow me to}} clarify <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> above, the passage of this [...] "Salle de Saint-Palais" [...] {{to the house of}} Gassion. Noble Jean de Lafourcade, Seigneur de Gouze et d'Uhart-Juson, {{acquired}} the noble house called the [...] "Salie (sic) de Saint-Palais", with its woods, tithe, fields, meadows, vineyards, fiefs, justice of the Rue Neuve of said city, and all useful and honorary rights attached to it, from Messire Gabriel, Baron d'Armendarits, by contract dated 12 May 1653, for a price of 16,000 Bordeaux francs. On 14 August 1662, Dame Anne d'Auga, widow of the said Jean de Lafourcade, and Messire Pierre de Lafourcade, Baron de Gouze, their son, obtained from the Seneschal of (Lower) Navarre the authorization to sell their properties in Lower Navarre in order to liquidate their debts, and on 13 April 1663, the Baron de Gouze was paid 555 francs of the amount that he charged Messire Jean, Marquis de Gassion, Audaux et Méritein, Baron de Camou and other places, [...] " [...] Ordinaire" [...] to the King on his councils, President of the Court of the Parliament of (Lower) Navarre, in the price of the Noble [...] "Salle of Saint-Palais", the mills of the said place and of Béhotéguy, half of the tithe of Beyrie and of Orsanco, sold to him by the said Sieur de Gouze." ...|$|E
