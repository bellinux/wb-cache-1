40|$|Objectives: Resonance tube {{phonation}} with {{tube end}} in {{water is a}} voice therapy method in which the patient phonates through a glass tube, keeping the free end of the tube submerged in water, creating bubbles. The purpose of this experimental {{study was to determine}} flow-pressure relationship, flow thresholds between bubble types, and bubble frequency as a function of flow and <b>back</b> <b>volume.</b> Methods A flow-driven vocal tract simulator was used for recording the back pressure produced by resonance tubes with inner diameters of 8 and 9 [*]mm submerged at water depths of 0 – 7 [*]cm. Visual inspection of bubble types through video recording was also performed. Results The static back pressure was largely determined by the water depth. The narrower tube provided a slightly higher back pressure for a given flow and depth. The amplitude of the pressure oscillations increased with flow and depth. Depending on flow, the bubbles were emitted from the tube in three distinct types with increasing flow: one by one, pairwise, and in a chaotic manner. The bubble frequency was slightly higher for the narrower tube. An increase in <b>back</b> <b>volume</b> led to a decrease in bubble frequency. Conclusions This study provides data on the physical properties of resonance tube phonation with the tube end in water. This information will be useful in future research when looking into the possible effects of this type of voice training...|$|E

40|$|A novel {{miniature}} silicon microphone diaphragm that {{is highly}} robust when subjected to residual stress is described. The novel diaphragm is composed of a reinforced plate supported on carefully designed hinges. An approximate model is developed {{to account for the}} effects of the small <b>back</b> <b>volume</b> behind the diaphragm and the narrow slits around the perimeter using finite element analysis and analytical equations. The overall dimensions of the polycrystalline silicon diaphragm are 1 mm by 1 mm by 40 microns. The measured response of the diaphragm closely resembles that of an ideal rigid plate over a frequency range extending well beyond the audible range. This approach leads to a structure that is remarkably robust and tolerant of the stresses that have plagued efforts to fabricate miniature microphones. Potential applications include advanced consumer products such as cell phones, portable digital devices, and camcorders. ...|$|E

40|$|A {{reliable}} {{characterization of}} a MEMS microphone {{is essential for}} {{a better understanding of}} the device physics, for estimating the device performance and for guidance during the research, for better microphones. The work presented in this report focuses on the investigation and comparison of different measurement principles and techniques used to measure the key device parameters resonance frequency and compliance. The first generation MEMS microphones that are developed by NXP are influenced by mechanical vibrations that reduces the device performance. Therefore, new techniques will be implemented to reduce this noise and these techniques are based upon matching the frequencies of two flexible plates in the microphone sensor, we investigate these resonance frequencies in this thesis. This investigation is performed with two different measurement techniques : electrical impedance measurements and laser vibrometer experiments. These measurements are performed in air and vacuum conditions and the influence of ambient pressure, bias voltage and <b>back</b> <b>volume</b> on the resonance frequency is investigated. The vacuum measurements are in good agreement with the finite element simulation results. Additionally the results obtained from different measurements are compared and the difference between the results are analyzed. Finally, recommendations are made for future measurement conditions and setups. ECTM GroupMicroelectronics & Computer EngineeringElectrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Scienc...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Nowadays, {{the world}} wind energy {{has had an}} {{important}} development {{in the last years}} in spite of the economic crisis we are going through. Cost reduction has helped to improve the profitability, thanks to economies of scale and the creation of new projects. Currently, our country is in the fourth position leading the electricity generation with wind energy. However, {{it has been estimated that}} this increase will be reduced not only because of the cutbacks, but also due to the elimination of aids. Wind energy has advantages and disadvantages which can be environmental, economic and technical. The main advantages are: - It is a renewable and non-polluting source. - A lot of direct and indirect jobs have been created thanks to this energy. On the other hand, the main disadvantages are: - The visual impact associated with wind turbines. - The power generated in the wind parks cannot be stored so far. Generally speaking, wind energy can be either earthly or marine. In addition, in Spain this sector is divided in: advancement of wind parks and electricity generation, fabrication of wind turbines, fabrication of components and services. The economic and financial analysis carried out deals with companies which work developing wind parks and electricity generation in Spain from 2010 to 2012. This analysis is based in a sample of 180 companies that meet the requirements above mentioned. This sample has been evaluated through nine ratios: liquidity, working capital, solvency, plough <b>back,</b> <b>volume</b> of sales, EBITDA, net profit, ROI, ROE and financial gearing. The principal target of this research is to know better the characteristics of this sector. To continue, I will start analyzing the current situation (three levels: worldwide, European, and national), the sample chosen for the economic and financial analysis and its future situation.
