40|$|Pneumatic muscle (PM) of {{flexible}} actuators used in bionic robot {{is an active}} area of recent research. A novel PM with shape memory alloy (SMA) <b>braided</b> <b>sleeve</b> is proposed in this paper, and SMA is used to improve PM working characteristics. Based {{on the principle of}} virtual work, output force model of PM and relationship with braided wire inner-stress are established, and analysis of PM deformation has shown that braided wire length is the key factor of output force characteristic. Based on the crystal structure transitions, the relationship of temperature with wire shrinkage is derived. Then, the synthetic dynamics of novel PM is established. A physical prototype of PM with SMA <b>braided</b> <b>sleeve</b> is developed, and test platform that is built for the experiment. Experiment and simulation test of static isometric-length, static isobaric-pressure, and dynamic characteristics are done. The experimental results are compared with the simulation of theoretical model. Moreover, based on experiment, model of output force was improved by adding a correction factor to deal with the elastic force of rubber tube. The results analysis demonstrates that the established models are correct, and SMA wires can reinforce PM and make PM working characteristics adjustable. PM proposed in this paper has greater output force and is beneficial to achieve more accurate control that is useful for manipulating fragile things...|$|E
40|$|In all {{composites}} {{the properties}} {{and structure of}} the reinforcement strongly influence the performance of the material. For some composites, however, the reinforcement also affects the fabrication process itself exerting an additional, second order influence on performance. This is the case for the chemical vapor infiltration (CVI) process for fabrication of ceramic matrix composites. In this process the matrix forms progressively as a solid deposit, first onto the fiber surfaces, then onto the previous layer of deposit, ultimately growing to fill the inter-fiber porosity. The transport of reactants to the surfaces and the evolved morphology of the matrix depend on the initial reinforcement structure. This structure can vary greatly and is controlled by such factors as fiber size and cross-section, the number of filaments and amount of twist per tow or yarn, and the weave or braid architecture. Often the choice of reinforcement is based on mechanical performance analysis or on the cost and availability of the material or on the temperature stability of the fiber. Given this choice, the composite densification process [...] CVI [...] must be optimized to attain a successful material. Ceramic fiber in the form of cylindrical <b>braided</b> <b>sleeve</b> is an attractive choice for fabrication of tube-form ceramic matrix composites. Multiple, concentric layers of sleeve can be placed over a tubular mandrel, compressed and fixed with a binder to form a freestanding tube preform. This fiber architecture is different than that created by layup of plain weave cloth [...] the material used in most previous CVI development. This report presents the results of the investigation of CVI densification of <b>braided</b> <b>sleeve</b> preforms and the evolution of their structure and transport properties during processing...|$|E

40|$|The natural {{compliance}} and force generation properties of pneumatic artificial muscles (PAMs) {{allow them to}} operate like human muscles in anthropomorphic robotic manipulators. Traditionally, manipulators use a single PAM or multiple PAMs actuated in unison {{in place of a}} human muscle. However, these manipulators experience efficiency losses when operated outside their target performance ranges. The unidirectional actuation behavior of a miniature PAM bundle and bidirectional actuation behavior of an antagonistic pair of miniature PAM bundles are characterized and modeled. The results are used to motivate the application of a variable recruitment control strategy to a parallel bundle of miniature PAMs as an attempt to mimic the selective recruitment of motor units in a human muscle to improve the operating efficiency of the actuator. Additionally, the fabrication and quasi-static testing results for PAMs assembled from candidate space qualified bladder and <b>braided</b> <b>sleeve</b> materials for use in space robotics are assessed...|$|E
40|$|Background: This paper investigates {{different}} types of crimped, <b>braided</b> <b>sleeve</b> used for a soft arm for robotic abdominal surgery, with the sleeve required to contain balloon expansion in the pneumatically actuating arm while it follows the required bending, elongation and diameter reduction of the arm. Material and methods: Three types of crimped, braided sleeves from PET (BraidPET) or nylon (BraidGreyNylon and BraidNylon, with different monofilament diameters) were fabricated and tested including geometrical and microstructural characterisation of the crimp and braid, mechanical tests and medical scratching tests for organ damage of domestic pigs. Results: BraidPET caused some organ damage, sliding under normal force of 2 - 5 N; this was attributed to the high roughness of the braid pattern, the higher friction coefficient of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) compared to nylon, and the high frequency of the crimp peaks for this sleeve. No organ damage was observed for the BraidNylon, attributed to both the lower roughness of the braid pattern and the low friction coefficient of nylon. BraidNylon also required the lowest tensile force during its elongation to similar maximum strain as that of BraidPET, translating to low power requirements...|$|E
40|$|In the {{presented}} {{paper the}} realization of an artificial functional unit of muscular hydrostat inspired by the octopus is shown. The octopus has been chosen because it shows high manipulation capabilities and dexterity without a skeletal support, thus {{it is a good}} example of Embodied Intelligence. Inspiration from Nature concerns the features that are interesting from a robotic point of view for the development of an artificial muscular hydrostat: in particular actuators arrangement and their antagonistic mechanism. The main focus was on the two key elements of the unit: soft actuators and support structure. Shape memory alloys (SMA) has been chosen for actuation technology, whereas the support structure is a <b>braided</b> <b>sleeve,</b> that provides spatial continuity to the action of the actuators. Two contiguous units have been built and tested in water. Capabilities of shortening, elongation and bending have been observed and their performances evaluated. A maximum elongation of 43 % has been recorded from shortened to elongated condition, with a diameter variation of 25 %, finding a good match with the expected results from the support structure models. Relative angle between extremities has been measured during bending in two conditions and their efficiency has been compared...|$|E

40|$|Soft {{robotics}} requires {{technologies that}} are capable of generating forces even though the bodies are composed of very light, flexible and soft elements. A soft actuation mechanism was developed in this work, taking inspiration from the arm of the Octopus vulgaris, specifically from the muscular hydrostat which represents its constitutive muscular structure. On the basis of the authors’ previous works on shape memory alloy (SMA) springs used as soft actuators, a specific arrangement of such SMA springs is presented, which is combined with a flexible <b>braided</b> <b>sleeve</b> featuring a conical shape and a motor-driven cable. This robot arm is able to perform tasks in water such as grasping, multi-bending gestures, shortening and elongation along its longitudinal axis. The whole structure of the arm is described in detail and experimental results on workspace, bending and grasping capabilities and generated forces are presented. Moreover, this paper demonstrates {{that it is possible to}} realize a self-contained octopus-like robotic arm with no rigid parts, highly adaptable and suitable to be mounted on underwater vehicles. Its softness allows interaction with all types of objects with very low risks of damage and limited safety issues, while at the same time producing relatively high forces when necessary...|$|E
40|$|<b>Braided</b> <b>sleeve</b> {{composite}} shafts {{are produced}} and their torsional behavior is investigated. The braided sleeves are slid over an Al tube to create {{very strong and}} rigid tubular form shafts {{and they are in}} the form of 2 / 2 twill biaxial fiber fabric that has been woven into a continuous sleeve. Carbon and glass fibers braided sleeves are used for the fabrication of the composite shafts. VARTM (vacuum assisted resin transfer molding) and Vacuum Bagging are the two different types of manufacturing methods used in the study. Torsional behaviors of the shafts are investigated experimentally in terms of fabrication methods and various composite materials parameters such as fiber types, layer thickness, and ply angles. Comparing the two methods in terms of the torque forces and strain angles, the shafts producing entirely carbon fiber show the highest torque capacities; however, considering the cost and performance criteria, the hybrid shaft made up of carbon and glass fibers is the optimum solution for average demanded properties. Additionally, FE (finite element) model of the shafts was created and analyzed by using ANSYS workbench environment. Results of finite element analysis are compared with the values of twisting angle and torque obtained by experimental tests...|$|E
40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{possibility}} of taking advantage of artificial muscle’s own stiffness and damping, and substituting it for a classic proportional-integral-derivative controller (PID) controller an I controller. The advantages are that there would only be one parameter to tune and {{no need for a}} dynamic model. A stability analysis is proposed from a simple phenomenological artificial muscle model. Step and sinus-wave tracking responses performed with pneumatic McKibben muscles are reported showing the practical efficiency of the method to combine accuracy and load robustness. In the particular case of the McKibben artificial muscle technology, we suggest that the dynamic performances in stability and load robustness would result from the textile nature of its <b>braided</b> <b>sleeve</b> and its internal friction which do not obey Coulomb’s third law, as verified by preliminary reported original friction experiments. Comparisons are reported between three kinds of braided sleeves made of rayon yarns, plastic, and thin metal wires, whose similar closed-loop dynamic performances are highlighted. It is also experimentally shown that a sleeve braided with thin metal wires can give high accuracy performance, in step as in tracking response. This would be due to a low static friction coefficient combined with a kinetic friction exponentially increasing with speed in accordance with hydrodynamic lubrication theory applied to textile physics...|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} {{the development and}} application of a robot vision based adaptive algorithm for the quality control of the <b>braided</b> <b>sleeving</b> of high pressure hydraulic pipes. With our approach, we can successfully overcome the limitations, such as low reliability and repeatability of braided quality, which result from the visual observation of the braided pipe surface. The braids to be analyzed come in different dimensions, colors, and braiding densities with different types of errors to be detected, as presented in this paper. Therefore, our machine vision system, consisting of a mathematical algorithm for the automatic adaptation to different types of braids and dimensions of pipes, enables the accurate quality control of braided pipe sleevings and offers {{the potential to be}} used in the production of braiding lines of pipes. The principles of the measuring method and the required equipment are given in the paper, also containing the mathematical adaptive algorithm formulation. The paper describes the experiments conducted to verify the accuracy of the algorithm. The developed machine vision adaptive control system was successfully tested and is ready for the implementation in industrial applications, thus eliminating human subjectivity...|$|R

40|$|Actuators are {{devices that}} exhibit {{reversible}} {{change in their}} shape or volume or generate force when externally stimulated. Because of their very similar operation style to biological muscles, actuator materials are also known as artificial muscles. These materials are in demand for many applications, such as medical devices and robotics. These applications normally require an inexpensive actuator system that can offer high force, high strain, and high power density {{in a relatively short}} period of time. The device packaging and size of the actuator are also important parameters as currently most of the applications desire very compact and lightweight systems. Furthermore, low electricity consumption also as a last requirement has a significant effect on the actuation system by increasing the efficiency of the entire system. Producing all of the above requirements in one device is currently a challenge for engineers and scientists. In this thesis, a new contractile artificial muscle system is introduced than can offer most of the above requirements to satisfy the current expectations of these devices. Chapter 1 of this thesis focuses on a literature review of prominent available artificial muscles and comparing them with biological muscle performance for better understanding of their advantages and disadvantages. Chapter 2 investigates the effect of the inner tube material and muscle geometry on a small hydraulic McKibben artificial muscle as well as the possibility of running this system with a compact, low voltage water pump. This chapter also introduces a new equation that is able to predict static muscle performance notably more accurately than previous models. Chapter 3 illuminates the possibility of three-dimensional printing the <b>braided</b> <b>sleeve</b> used in McKibben artificial muscles to have more control on the manufacturing process of such devices. In Chapter 4, the fluid normally used in conventional McKibben muscles is substituted with a temperature sensitive material to eliminate the need of the pump/compressor and piping to introduce a more compact device. The new muscles were stimulated either by immersing in a hot water bath or using a heating filament. A contraction strain of 9 % and 2 N isometric force were produced. A new equation is also introduced to predict the performance of this type of McKibben muscles with temperature as the driving force. Chapter 5 introduces a novel miniature type of McKibben artificial muscle by using a conductive <b>braided</b> <b>sleeve</b> and eliminating the need for the inner tube. The electricity consumption of this muscle is as low as 2. 5 V. The muscle weight is only 0. 14 gr with a diameter of 1. 4 mm. The muscle generates a tensile stress of 50 kPa and contraction strain of 10 %. Finally, Chapter 6 concludes this study and also represents some potential future works...|$|E
40|$|Air {{muscles are}} simple {{pneumatic}} devices that have high {{potential to be}} used as robotic manipulators, as they have a behavior similar to biological motors or muscles. Hence, they have a wide range of potential applications in areas such as robotics, bio-robotics, biomechanics, and artificial limb replacements. In addition to the similarity to biological muscle, air muscles have the advantages of good power-to-weight ratio, being compliant, and low cost. This thesis primarily quantifies the relationship between velocity of contraction of air muscles and the force applied on it, which is a key characteristic of biological skeletal muscle. First, an experimental test rig was used to measure the velocity of contraction of air muscles as a function of applied force, supply pressure, and supply volumetric flow rate. Second, a theoretical model is proposed to quantify the relationship between the velocity of contraction and force applied on it and to explain the experimental results. Three air muscles having different lengths and diameters were tested for loads ranging from 0 to 6 kg at 20 psi, 40 psi and 60 psi at two different flow rates. All three air muscles were made up of latex tubing sheathed with the Techflex, FlexoPet <b>braided</b> <b>sleeve.</b> The primary air muscle was 5 inches long, with the diameter of the inner tube measuring 3 / 4 of an inch. The second muscle had half the length (2. 5 inches) and was the same diameter as the primary air muscle. The third air muscle was the same length as the first (5 inches long), but half of the diameter (3 / 8 of an inch). The velocity of the contraction was measured {{with the help of the}} linear potentiometer. Both the theoretical model and the experimental results found that as the force applied on the air muscles is increased, maximum length of contraction and velocity of contraction decrease. Both model and experiment showed that the velocity of contraction increases as a function of both pressure and volume flow rate...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of advanced materials and technologies for application to new and existing structures, infrastructures, and equipment, aiming at improving {{their response to}} service and extreme loads, represents an emerging issue both from an academic and a professional viewpoint. Relevant performance assessment procedures, based on effective experimental verification methods [1] and refined numerical simulation models [2], are quickly evolving as well. New or improved building materials and innovative protection technologies offer updated solutions to the constantly increasing capacity requirements in structural, geotechnical, plant, and mechanical engineering design and rehabilitation. At the same time, they open novel and challenging research and application perspectives. The objective of this special issue was to provide readers with a representative outlook of the latest achievements in this field, including emerging aspects in modelling, testing, manufacturing, and practical implementation studies. The response {{of the scientific community}} was encouraging, with over 100 manuscripts submitted. The published papers offer a selected and articulated overview of the examined topics. Several papers are dedicated to concrete, reinforced concrete (R/C) members, and cement composites. J. Zhang and J. Li develop a semi-implicit constitutive integration algorithm for elastoplastic damage models, specially implemented for concrete. Literature mechanical tests of reinforced concrete components are numerically simulated, showing the effectiveness of the numerical method in history-dependent energy estimation within this class of nonlinear problems. H. Ding et al. examine the failure criteria and the constitutive relation of early-age concrete,with the aimof providing a theoretical basis for a novel strategy in early dismantling formwork construction of floors, aimed at accelerating formwork recycling as well as at reducing construction costs. Y. Shen et al. propose a paper spool-inspired anchoring method and a pretension procedure for carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) sheets, for themanufacturing of prestressed concrete flat slabs. Laboratory flexural tests confirm the feasibility of this novel reinforcement technique, showing that uniformity of the fiber stress during tensioning is a key aspect for the successful application of prestress. Improved flexural calculation models for R/C members built with ultrahigh performance concrete (i. e., with cubic compressive strength exceeding 200 MPa) are presented by B. -I. Bae et al., who revise the normal stress distribution schemes adopted for standard concrete classes. The models are verified and validated by means Hindawi Publishing Corporation Advances in Materials Science and Engineering Volume 2016, Article ID 1854839, 3 pages [URL] 2 Advances in Materials Science and Engineering of laboratory flexural tests on representative specimens in this case too. High strength concrete materials, with cubic compressive strength ranging fromabout 80 MPa to 110 MPa, are examined in the paper of L. Zeng et al., as constituting materials of R/C beam-to-column joints encasing I-shaped hot-rolled steel profiles. An extensive campaign of cyclic tests on half-scale weak-type joints allows evaluating the beneficial influence of the adopted concrete classes in terms of strength {{and at the same time}} a minimal decrease in ductility, as compared to the cyclic performance of similar joints cast with standard concretes. Composite concretesteel tubular columns are the topic of the article by S. Jayaganesh et al. An experimental programme is carried out to evaluate the effects of the partial compression of square and circular cross sections, highlighting a reduction in strength in comparison to full compression, more accentuated in the case of the square shape. The correlation of the test results with the predictions of the analytical models proposed in the literature to account for these effects seems rather satisfactory. Another experimental activity is reported in the paper by J. Deng et al., dedicated to a campaign of pseudostatic cyclic tests of one-fifth scale prototype R/C bridge piers, damaged and repaired by means of a steel-tube jacketing traditional technique, or by wrapping interventions based on the use of CFRP or basalt fiber reinforced polymer (BFRP) sheets. The results attest satisfactory performance in all cases, with a significant increase in lateral stiffness and strength provided by jacketing as compared to the original response capacity, and its complete restoration in the case of the two FRP-based retrofitmeasures. The advantages of the lattermethod consist in lower physical intrusion and quicker installation times. The postprocessing study of an experimental programme carried out by the pseudodynamic method on a set of 13 R/C shear walls is presented in the article of F. J. Molina et al., where the results of the seismic tests are elaborated by an innovative strategy that allows deriving a capacity-linemodel. With this approach it is possible to understand better the different safety margins that are observed in the experiments depending on the assigned eigenfrequency in relation to the earthquake response spectra. The effects of the amount of reinforcement and normal load are also assessed. Enhanced cement composite materials are investigated in the articles by H. Choi et al. and J. Lai et al. The former deals with the experimental characterization of an innovative Portland cement mortar, prepared by incorporating multiwalled carbon nanotubes in the mixture. The experimentally measured compressive strength is greater than the one offered by standard Portland mortars, as a consequence of the bridging action of the nanotubes, which prevents the progression of microcracks and helps reducing the space between the voids in the hydration material. In J. Lay et al. ’s paper, cement fly ash gravel is examined as constituting material of pile composite foundations, for their updated use in saturated tailing dams. A finite element analysis of the settlements of this type of foundation, calibrated on the experimental investigation carried out by other authors, assesses a stable and rather homogeneous response under the design embankment loads. Three articles are dedicated to advanced seismic protection technologies. In the paper byM. Ismail et al., a numerical study of a base isolation system incorporating Roll-in-Cage devices recently developed by the authors is carried out by simulating its incorporation in a three-span prestressed R/C box girder-type bridge. The results show a remarkable global performance of the system, also in comparison with other seismic isolation solutions, highlighting its benefits in the potential application to bridge structures. The article of F. Mazza and A. Vulcano reports a shaking table testing programme developed on a one-third scale base-isolated steel frame structure equipped with an in-parallel combination of steel-PTFE sliders and elastomeric bearings (HDRBs). The experimental response confirms the high level of protection offered by the isolation technology and establishes a database for a refined numericalmodelling of the constituting devices. J. W. Hu and M. -H. Noh present a study on selfcentering friction dissipative steel braces including special components fabricated with shape-memory alloy wires and friction-type dampers. A numerical investigation carried out on single-degree-of-freedom models allows formulating a design methodology aimed at mutually optimising the recentering and energy dissipation capacities of the passive protection system, with a view to its practical implementation. Two more papers deal with the application of innovative FRP composite materials in various fields of engineering. N. B. Baba et al. examine the mechanical and physical behaviour of a hybrid glass FRP (GFRP) fabricated with three different types of glass fibers— 3 D, woven, and chopped— combined with a mixture of polyester resin and hardener. Fiber arrangement and volume are varied to evaluate the combination capable of providing the best performance in terms of tensile strength and water absorption, which is identified by means of the characterisation test developed in the study. In the article by M. E. Tas¸delen et al. the torsional behaviour of novel <b>braided</b> <b>sleeve</b> composite shafts consisting of carbon and glass fibers is investigated. Vacuum assisted resin transfer molding and vacuum bagging are adopted as manufacturing methods. The results of the experimental programme and the relevant finite element simulations underline that, for the same configuration of layup sequences, the highest torque and tensile strengths are obtained for test specimens manufactured with the former method. Furthermore, hybrid carbon-glass solutions strike the best balance between strength performance and costs. Special issues are dealt with in the remaining three articles. By considering the growing applications of piezoelectric structures in innovative technical areas, L. M. Zhou et al. implement a mixed cell-based smoothed/extended finite element method for a careful electromechanical crack analysis of the constituting material. The case study examples presented in the paper show that this mixed method is more accurate and quickly converging than a standard finite element calculation, also bypassing the mapping process inherent to the latter, which significantly increases the complexity of the calculation. J. Chen et al. report an on-site experimental study of the cooling effect of crushed rock-based embankments on slope wetlands situated along a railway line. A monitoring system installed in an embankment of notable dimensions allows reconstructing the temperature fields and the freezing Advances in Materials Science and Engineering 3 history with time. The surveyed data show that only the embankment shady side can be effectively cooled down in a warm permafrost region, and the crushed rock-based embankment can cool the entire embankment in a cold permafrost region. Finally, in the paper by Y. Ou et al. an innovative self-propagating high-temperature synthesis (SHS) process to prepare amorphous boron powder, which is an attractive material in several enhanced engineering applications, is discussed. The new technique proposed in this study consists in combining the SHS process and the traditional magnesium thermal reduction method. The effectiveness of the resulting technique suggests its possible industrial application and adoption as a common approach to prepare various inorganic materials. JRC.

The jacket features ornate silver buttons, and is worn with the service member's awarded medals in miniature size, wings in miniature size, or other specialty insignia over the left breast, command insignia over the right breast for colonels and below (if applicable), satin air force blue bow-tie for males or tab for females, and a satin air force blue cummerbund. Cufflinks are to be either shined or flat round silver, or have the air force star and wing emblem, dark blue suspenders may also be worn, but remain hidden while the jacket is on. Commissioned officers, USAFA and AFROTC cadets, and OTS officer trainees wear hard shoulder epaulets (i.e., shoulder boards) similar to those worn by commissioned officers of the U.S Navy. Cadets and officer trainees wear insignia on their shoulder boards as applicable to their pre-commissioning rank position in their respective officer accession programs. Commissioned officer shoulder boards for colonels and below feature an officer's rank insignia in raised metallic thread, bordered by two silver vertical metallic stipes similar to <b>sleeve</b> <b>braid.</b> General officers wear shoulder boards covered nearly the entire length and width in silver metallic braid, with silver stars in raised metallic thread in number appropriate to their rank. Enlisted personnel wear the same large rank insignia that they would wear on their service dress coats. Officers also wear a single silver metallic <b>sleeve</b> <b>braid</b> on the lower sleeves of the Mess Dress coat, with <b>sleeve</b> <b>braid</b> coming in two widths, in a 1/2 inch width for colonel and below, and in a 3/4 inch width for Brigadier General and above. Enlisted personnel wear no <b>sleeve</b> <b>braid.</b> No hat or nametag is worn with the Air Force Mess Dress Uniform.|$|R
