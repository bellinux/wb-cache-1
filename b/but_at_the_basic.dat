In other words, a hypermedia system needs to be open with respect to:. information [...] - the same presentation 1 can be displayed by heterogeneous end-user systems;. data [...] - pre-created media objects can be (re-) used in multiple presentations;. other applications [...] - the hypermedia presentation environment can exchange data and/or messages with other applications.

40|$|In the mid-nineties, {{multimedia}} became {{established as}} an industrial branch {{in the region}} of Munich. Munich holds a leading position among Germany's multimedia regions, referring to the numbers of companies and employees. The multimedia boom in the early 1990 s was triggered by a rapidly increasing demand from enterprises in the Munich region (in the automobile, electronics, publishing, movie and television, banking, insurance and advertising industries) for modern forms of information, communication and training. The multimedia companies find a sufficient supply of qualified labour on Munich's labour market. Moreover a broad range of institutions for education and training and the willingness of many employees to move into the Munich area are additional factors. Multimedia in the Munich region constitutes a fully-fledged production and service cluster. It is based on the availability of varied support services, a specific infrastructural environment, and a creative, innovative milieu. Vertical and horizontal cooperation along the value chain is enabled. Political support on the level of the Bundesland and the region does not primarily aim at promoting multimedia directly <b>but</b> <b>at</b> creating <b>the</b> <b>basic</b> conditions for <b>the</b> entire media economy as well as a specific further qualification of the employees.

40|$|Background : The {{recently}} developed Social Profile assessment allows for classifying a group’s interaction behaviors within five levels. However, empirical associations between the levels, and {{factors related to}} an overall Social Profile measure, have not been examined. Methods : A sample of 35 occupational therapy students was recruited. Data was collected by self-report questionnaires, including the Social Profile and basic sociodemographic information. Descripti - ve statistics, bivariate correlation, and linear regression analyses were performed. Results : <b>The</b> <b>basic</b> cooperative level was most frequently found in the study groups. In general, levels of social interaction were more strongly associated with nearby levels, and more weakly or negative - ly associated with levels representing more different behaviors. The overall Social Profile measure related to the levels of interaction in a mostly logical way. Spending {{more time with the}} group was associated with a higher Social Profile measure, but this measure was unrelated to individual exam grades. Conclusion : Student study groups appear to operate at all levels of social interaction, <b>but</b> most frequently <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>basic</b> cooperative level.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the effects of two types of {{categorical}} information on three levels of categorization in kindergarten children and adults, who were assumed to differ in their existing knowledge of categories. Experiment 1 : In the no-information trials, the subjects were required to judge whether two instances in each pair belonged to the same group or not. Four pairs wereprovided : dog 1 -dog 2 (basic), dog 1 - rabbit (intermediate), dog 1 - swallow (superordinate), and dog 1 - pencil (irrelevant). In the information trials, the subjects were given information having novel words such as "These are kutes" to dog 3 -dog 4 (basic), "These are keyos" to dog 3 -cat (intermediate), and "These are wamos" to dog 3 - sparrow (superordinate) pairs. After then, the subjects were again required to judge whether the two instances of four pairs used in the no-information trials belonged to the same group or not. Categorization was assessed by "Yes" judgements to each pair. When the novel-word information was given to <b>the</b> <b>basic</b> pair, categorization was facilitated <b>at</b> <b>the</b> intermediate pair for children, <b>but</b> inhibited <b>at</b> <b>the</b> intermediate and superordinate pairs for adults. When the information was given to the intermediate pair, categorization was facilitated <b>at</b> <b>the</b> intermediate pair for children and adults, <b>but</b> inhibited <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>basic</b> pair and facilitated <b>at</b> <b>the</b> superordmate pair for children. When the information was given to the superordmate pair, categorization was more facilitated <b>at</b> <b>the</b> superordinate pair for adults than for children. It was inhibited <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>basic</b> <b>but</b> facilitated <b>at</b> <b>the</b> intermediate pairs for adults. Experiment 2 : In the information trials, the subjects were given three levels of information having functional attributes to the dog 1 in each of the three levels of pairs : that is, "This barks at someone" (basic), "This runs on the ground" (intermediate), and "This baits" (superordinate). When the functional information was given to <b>the</b> <b>basic</b> pair, categorization was facilitated <b>at</b> <b>the</b> superordinate pair for children, <b>but</b> inhibited <b>at</b> <b>the</b> intermediate and superordinate pairs for adults. When the information was given to the intermediate pair, categorization was facilitated <b>at</b> <b>the</b> intermediate pair for children and adults, <b>but</b> inhibited <b>at</b> <b>the</b> superordinate pair for adults.

40|$|Abstract Background: To improve {{effectiveness}} of malaria control interventions, {{it is essential}} to deepen the knowledge of contextual factors that govern people’s practice for preventive and curative measures. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine factors that influence the use of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) in three rural communities of Côte d’Ivoire, two of which benefited from recent interventions. Methods: The study was carried out in 957 households in three villages (Bozi, N’Dakonankro and Yoho) located in central Côte d’Ivoire. Indicators of socioeconomic position (SEP), malaria knowledge and practice, placing special emphasis on LLINs, were investigated during a cross-sectional questionnaire survey. Principal component analysis was used to calculate the SEP of households by means of a list of household assets ownership. The concentration index was used to assess the direction of the association between SEP and a given variable. To compare groups or means, Fisher’s exact test, c 2 and Kruskal-Wallis test were used, as appropriate. Results: Significant differences were found between SEP and reported malaria symptoms, such as fever or hot body, convulsion, anaemia and jaundice (yellow eyes). Individuals from the least poor group cited more often the use of bed nets and insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) compared to poorer groups. The mean number of individuals reporting the use of bed nets and LLINs was different between groups with different educational level. Moreover, the mean number of LLINs in a household was influenced by the presence of children below five years of age. Conclusion: The study not only confirmed that education and SEP play important roles in the prevention and control of malaria and promotion of health in general, <b>but</b> pointed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>basic</b> essential knowledge and the key behavioural elements that should guide education and learning processes among the poorer segments of the population.

40|$|The {{mechanical}} properties are often <b>the</b> main topic, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> least a necessary precondition {{in the application}} of thin films. The indentation methods with monitoring of load and penetrating depth yield local stress-strain curves. Devices are now available with depth resolution down to the manometer range. They are very valuable tools for mechanical characterization for many film systems. But the indentation methods have some intrinsic limitations. Apart from such problems as uncertainties of the tip shape and influence of surface roughness, there are two classes of thin films, which are especially critical: ultra-hard and ultra-thin films. For ultra-hard films (with Vickers hardness HV > 50 GPa) the deformabilities of indenter and film become comparable. For ultra-thin films (with thickness below 100 nm) the plastic zone induced even by very shallow indentations is usually not restricted on the film material but reaches into the underlying substrate. Thus the measured values represent a certain average of the film-substrate composite, where the film properties cannot extracted from in a reliable manner due to the high complexity and non-linearity of the indentation test. The film characterization by Young's modulus determined by surface ultrasonic waves helps to overcome these problems. The laser-acoustic method has proved to be very suitable as reliable, quick and robust technique for testing thin films. The surface acoustic wave method is based on linear-elastic phenomena. Hence, even for deformation fields reaching deep into the substrate, the film properties may be deciphered by strong mathematics. Furthermore, high film hardness is not limiting. (There is only another unavoidable restriction: the attenuation of the substrate material for the high frequency ultrasonic surface waves must be sufficient low.) The measuring method and some representative results are given in chapter 3 and 4, respectively. <b>But</b> <b>at</b> first <b>the</b> <b>basic</b> question must be discussed, if the Young's modulus is suitable for mechanical characterization at all...|$|R
40|$|It is now {{increasingly}} {{acknowledged that}} complex global processes, {{from the financial}} to the ecological, connect the fate of communities across the world. Yet the problem-solving capacity of the existing system of global institutions is in many areas not effective, accountable, or fast enough to resolve current global dilemmas. What has recently been called the paradox of our times refers {{to the fact that}} the collective issues we must grapple with are of growing extensity and intensity, and yet the means for addressing them are weak and incomplete. 1 There are a variety of reasons for the persistence of these problems, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> most <b>basic</b> level <b>the</b> persistence of this paradox remains an issue of governance. One significant problem in this regard is that a growing number of issues span both the domestic and the international domains. The institutional fragmentation and competition between states can lead to these global issues being addressed in an ad hoc and dissonant manner. A second problem is that even when the global dimension of a problem is acknowledged, there is no clear division of labour among the myriad of international institutions that seek to address them: their functions often overlap, their mandates conflict, and their objectives often become blurred. A third problem is that the existing system of global governance suffers from severe deficits of accountability and inclusion. This problem is especially relevant in regard to how less economically powerful states and, hence, their entire populations, are marginalised or excluded from decisionmaking. This paper describes the current global economic crisis as intimately related to a problem of governance, and articulates simple principles by which the reform of governance can be guided. Increased accountability through participatory reform, we argue, helps to underwrite effectiveness...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Among the {{greatest}} challenges for biology in the 21 st century is inference of the tree of life. Interest in, and progress toward, this goal has increased dramatically with the growing availability of molecular sequence data. However, we have very little sense, for any major clade, of how much {{progress has been made}} in resolving a full tree of life and the scope of work that remains. A series of challenges stand in the way of completing this task <b>but,</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> most <b>basic</b> level, progress is limited by data: a limited fraction of the world's biodiversity has been incorporated into a phylogenetic analysis. More troubling is our poor understanding of what fraction of the tree of life is understood and how quickly research is adding to this knowledge. Here we measure the rate of progress on the tree of life for one clade of particular research interest, the vertebrates. Results Using an automated phylogenetic approach, we analyse all available molecular data for a large sample of vertebrate diversity, comprising nearly 12, 000 species and 210, 000 sequences. Our results indicate that progress has been rapid, increasing polynomially during the age of molecular systematics. It is also skewed, with birds and mammals receiving the most attention and marine organisms accumulating far fewer data and a slower rate of increase in phylogenetic resolution than terrestrial taxa. We analyse the contributors to this phylogenetic progress and make recommendations for future work. Conclusions Our analyses suggest that a large majority of the vertebrate tree of life will: (1) be resolved within the next few decades; (2) identify specific data collection strategies that may help to spur future progress; and (3) identify branches of the vertebrate tree of life in need of increased research effort. </p...|$|R
40|$|This essay {{addresses}} the on-going controversy between supporters of minimal government, or minarchists, {{and supporters of}} no government, or anarchists. Both lay claim to the Libertarian principle, which holds that the only justification {{for the use of}} force is to deal with aggressive force initiated by someone else. Both agree that force is justified in dealing with aggressors. The only question is, who wields it, and how? The essay explains, briefly, the role of private property in all this. Private property is really just the operation of the liberty principle {{in the area of the}} use of things outside ourselves: those who initiate use of such things will have their activities subject to continual invasion unless property is recognized, and so property is the natural outcome of liberty, taken seriously. But the trouble is, states are monopolies, and maintain themselves at public expense, by taxation. This inevitably means interference with private property rights. And so, if we deal with aggressors via the state, we turn into partial aggressors ourselves, it seems. The essay points out that and why both minarchism and anarchism are virtually impossible in contemporary circumstances, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> level of <b>basic</b> theory, <b>at</b> any rate, <b>the</b> anarchist appears to have the better of it...|$|R
