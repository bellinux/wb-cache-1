Agricultural export zones have been set up in the state for leechi, horticulture, herbs, medicinal plants, and <b>basmati</b> <b>rice.</b> During 2010, wheat production was 831 thousand tonnes and rice production was 610 thousand tonnes, while the main cash crop of the state, sugarcane, had a production of 5058 thousand tonnes.

India possesses an immense wealth of Basmati and non <b>Basmati</b> aromatic <b>rice</b> varieties and land races exhibiting a wide variability in their grain quality and cooking characteristics. Scented rices grow best and produce finest quality grains under cool, humid conditions, which are common in Himalayan Tarai of U. P and Uttarakhand and foot hills of Vindhya Hills. Among all scented rices aroma is considered as most important quality parameter of high quality rice. The major aromatic compound responsible for aroma is considered is 2 -acetyl- 1 -pyrroline, which is degraded by excessive nitrogenous fertilizers. To avoid degradation of 2 -acetyl- 1 - pyrroline and ultimately aroma organic field conditions are preferred. In present study forty Five varieties/lines of Basmati and Non <b>Basmati</b> aromatic <b>rices</b> were assessed for Brown Spot, Neck/panicle blast and stem borer...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- India {{possesses}} {{an immense}} wealth of Basmati and non <b>Basmati</b> aromatic <b>rice</b> varieties and land races exhibiting a wide variability in their grain quality and cooking characteristics. Among non <b>basmati</b> aromatic <b>rices,</b> Kalanamak {{is an important}} and popular scented rice variety grown in Eastern Uttar Pradesh. This variety {{is famous for its}} taste and aroma. In eastern India it is cooked in honour of guest or given as gift. Although Kalanamak is fast going out of cultivation, it is one indigenous aromatic rice variety if it is promoted properly, offers a great promise not only in domestic market but also as an export commodity. It can be boon for farmers of Eastern Uttar Pradesh and Tarai area of Bihar. In present study 40 lines/varieties of Kalanamak, collected from different parts of Eastern Uttar Pradesh were evaluated on the basis of grain quality for pure line selections and further improvement to attract more and more farmers for its cultivation again. In our study aroma ranged from very low to strong. Three variety/lines showed very low aroma, while low aroma was shown by 11 variety/lines, Moderate aroma was reported for 12 variety/lines & the remaining 14 variety/lines showed strong aroma.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{characterize}} non-traditional types of rice imported to the Czech Republic. Several chemical parameters of rice types were evaluated, and easy procedures for determination of insoluble dietary fibre, neutral-detergent fibre and the in vitro digestibility were suggested. Twelve imported rice types commonly {{available in the}} Czech market were purchased and subjected to analyses. Dry matter, ash, crude oil, starch and protein were determined in all samples of rice types. Additionally, in vitro organic matter digestibility, dry matter digestibility, dietary and neutral-detergent fibre contents were determined too. The highest amount of dietary fibre was detected in red (3. 49 %) and <b>basmati</b> natural <b>rice</b> (3. 26 %) (P<. 0. 05) and the highest content of neutral-detergent fibre was found in red (8. 22 %), red jasmine (7. 61 %) and brown jasmine rice (7. 98 %) (P<. 0. 05). While the best digestibility was assessed in parboiled (97. 51 %), parboiled with Indian (97. 79 %), lilac (96. 12 %) and milky round-grained rice (96. 25 %) (P<. 0. 05), the poorest digestibility was found in Thaibonnet natural (77. 82 %) and <b>basmati</b> natural <b>rice</b> (87. 48 %) (P<. 0. 05).

30|$|Our study again {{shows that}} over a hundred {{volatile}} metabolites are present in rice (Laguerre et al. 2007; Bryant and McClung 2011; Mathure et al. 2014), and while only a handful may be key to characterizing and defining rice aroma (Buttery et al. 1988) (Buttery et al. 1988; Jezussek et al. 2002; Yang et al. 2010; Calingacion et al. 2012), their relative importance needs to be better understood to enable breeders to select for this trait. Little {{is known about the}} genetic basis of aroma in rice, or the inheritance patterns of key flavour compounds, aside from 2 -acetyl- 1 -pyrroline, which is associated with the popcorn-like aroma of jasmine and <b>basmati</b> <b>rices</b> (Bradbury et al. 2005; Kovach et al. 2009; Chen et al. 2008). Here we have taken substantial steps towards identifying additional specific compounds associated with favourable and unfavourable consumer responses to rice aromatic quality. With {{a better understanding of the}} flavour traits that influence rice acceptance, and identifying specific compounds that drive this acceptance, we gain the potential to take advantage of the genetic difference between Apo and IR 64 (Additional file 2 : Figures S 1) for discovery of causative loci. Development of a mapping population between Apo and IR 64 could facilitate the identification of QTLs associated with specific components of rice aroma. This work makes it possible to develop varieties that take the favourable aromatic/flavour characteristics of one variety and at the same time select for the drought tolerant traits of another.|$|R

Thus, the physical properties such as size, shape, uniformity, and general appearance are of utmost importance in determining the final milling quality of rice grains.

The longer kernel length and other physico-chemical properties {{were found to be}} distinctive features of the rice cultivars [27].
