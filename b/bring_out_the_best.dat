5|$|Rimsky-Korsakov's non-program music, though well-crafted, {{does not}} rise to {{the same level of}} {{inspiration}} as his programmatic works; he needed fantasy to <b>bring</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> in him. The First Symphony follows the outlines of Schumann's Fourth extremely closely, and is slighter in its thematic material than his later compositions. The Third Symphony and Sinfonietta each contain a series of variations on less-than-the-best music that can lead to tedium.|$|E
5|$|For the actress, having Chloe {{become part}} of the meteor {{infected}} community in season six allowed Mack's character to continue to evolve. Mack views this transition as a means for her character to become more emotionally connected to those people—the meteor infected—she spent five seasons trying to expose to the public. Being infected by the meteors gives Chloe motivation to try to understand them and allows her to grow closer to Clark, as she can better understand {{what it feels like to}} live in a world where you have a special ability. Writer Holly Harold believes that, in addition to being infected by the meteor rocks, bringing Lois into the journalistic field also provides Chloe with a lot of ammunition for growth and development. Lois's presence at the Daily Planet allows Chloe the chance to reflect upon herself, and discover what things are most important to her – her career or her family and friends. The competition that Lois provides is beneficial, as it gives Chloe a chance to <b>bring</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> in herself.|$|E
25|$|Much {{the same}} way that the {{influential}} Duke Ellington matched his scores to the unique abilities of his performers, Hefti was able to take advantage of the same kind of 'fine-tuning' to <b>bring</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> of the talents of the Basie band. Therefore, it should come as no surprise that when the same charts are played by a different band, even the composer's own, that the result is not as strong.|$|E

500|$|The album {{received}} a mixed review from Tomas Mureika of Allmusic.

Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly named [...] "Entrada" [...] the fifth best {{episode of the}} series, calling it [...] "the sensational climax to season 3's sensational Olivia/Fauxlivia parallel universe interplay, which seemed to <b>bring</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> in both the writers of Fringe {{as well as its}} actors, especially Anna Torv, who rocked the tricky material and created a convincingly distinct and unique doppelganger iteration of Olivia.

500|$|McG {{described}} the film's theme as [...] "where {{you draw the}} line between machines and humans". The friendship between Marcus—who was executed (for murder) when humanity still ruled the world—and Kyle Reese illustrates how war and suffering can <b>bring</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> in people, such as when they worked together to survive during the Blitz. The title was derived from this second chance given to humanity and to Marcus, in addition to John's efforts to save humanity from the machines.

500|$|Critics praised Nimoy's direction, {{to which}} USA Today {{attributed}} the film's success in capturing {{the essence of}} the television show. Newsweek wrote that due to Nimoy the film was the best-paced Trek film, and that his familiarity with these actors enabled him to <b>bring</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> from them. Newsweek, and David Sterritt of the Christian Science Monitor, appreciated how the film slowed the action down to allow moments of reflection, comparing this with the focus of most contemporary action films on effects rather than actors. The Washington Posts Rita Kempley wrote that Nimoy's direction was competent, but his background in television showed—"the film feels made-for-TV", she summarized. Fellow Post critic Gary Arnold concurred with Kempley's television film assessment, but also wrote that Nimoy was smart to focus on the essentials of each scene; he [...] " [...] on the actors in ways that flatter and enhance their work." ...|$|E
500|$|When he was twenty, the National Post {{described}} Raonic as a [...] "hothead whose on-court demeanour {{was holding}} him back."

In 2014, Raonic explained: [...] "I'm the son of two engineers, so everything is a numbers and calculation game." [...] In 2016, he added: [...] "I am very systematic in how [...] need to go about things to <b>bring</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> tennis for myself, and maybe that comes off as mechanical and robotic and those kind of things, but I don't know if I'd ever change that because I feel that's the way I get the best out of myself when it comes to my tennis." ...|$|E
500|$|Priore reflected: [...] "Actually, the [...] reason {{most people}} didn't care for Smiley Smile {{is that it}} came out in place of Smile." [...] Richie Unterberger concurred, rating the album four out of five stars, and {{suggesting}} that media-hype of the collapsed Smile project was to blame for Smiley Smiles lackluster reception in the United States. He called it a [...] "rather nifty, if rather slight, effort that's plenty weird". In a 2007 issue of Rolling Stone, Robert Christgau and David Fricke named it one of the 40 essential albums of 1967; Christgau declared: [...] "Towering it's not; some kind of hit it is." [...] In 2001, Spencer Owen of Pitchfork awarded the album a 9.5/10 score, and wrote [...] "Smiley Smile is a near-masterpiece. Without any awareness of Smiles existence, this album could have been a contemporary classic... and although the album isn't anywhere close to the sonic revolution that Sgt.

Writing that Blige is [...] "particularly heavy" [...] on the R vibes of the song, Andrew Martin of Prefix Magazine further commented that [...] "without a doubt, it's sure to gain some stream whenever radio DJs catch wind of it. Why? Because 'Love a Woman' features silky production, strong harmonies, and guest vocals from Beyoncé. Yeah, there's no stopping this one." [...] Katie Hasty of HitFix commented that [...] "It's actually a pretty standard list of grievances and explanations, but the real guts of the thing is when the two light up, to <b>bring</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> vocal performances in each other, shooting you straight back to the 1990s."

As {{the first time}} she became actively involved in the songwriting process of one of her albums, Wings marked a shift in Tyler's career, focusing on mainstream pop music. With her main songwriting team consisting of herself, Paul D. Fitzgerald and Karen Drotar, they crafted two singles, [...] "Louise" [...] and [...] "Celebrate", neither of which were commercially successful when the album was released in mid-2005.
