5000|$|... 2000: IUCLID is the {{software}} prescribed in the EU <b>Biocides</b> <b>legislation</b> to notify existing active substances (Art. 4 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1896/2000).|$|E
5000|$|Following the EU <b>Biocides</b> <b>Legislation</b> some {{pressure}} {{was brought to}} reduce the use of formaldehyde. IARC Classes Formaldehyde as a [...] There are alternatives to formaldehyde and phenol-based fluids, but these are technically not preservatives but rather sanitising agents and are not widely accepted.|$|E
50|$|The <b>biocides</b> <b>legislation</b> puts {{emphasis}} {{on making the}} Regulation compatible with the World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules and requirements and with the Global Harmonised System for Classification and Labelling (GHS), {{as well as with}} the OECD programme on testing methods. Exchange of information requires the use of the OECD harmonised templates implemented in IUCLID - the International Unified Chemical Information Data System (see ECHA and OECD websites).|$|E
30|$|Any {{component}} based {{approach requires}} that all “relevant” compounds {{are included in}} the assessment, i.e. biologically active chemicals that are present at sufficiently high concentrations. Within the framework of <b>biocide</b> <b>legislation</b> such compounds are termed “substances of concern”, i.e. constituents of the biocidal product other than the active ingredient that have “an inherent capacity to cause an adverse effect on humans, animals or the environment” ([1], Art 2 e). If no ecotoxicological information is at hand for such ingredients, the only risk assessment option is the direct biotesting of the biocidal product or the resulting environmental mixture, respectively.|$|R
30|$|For example, the {{proposal}} for the Persistence criterion {{is based on the}} outcome of an evaluation performed on a set of selected active substances of PPPs. We recommend (i) normalising the DegT 50 values to a temperature of 12 °C as this is established in <b>biocides</b> <b>legislation</b> and suggested in other regulations (REACH and medicinal products directives), and (ii) selecting the geometric mean if five or more DegT 50 values are available, or a suitable value or range of DegT 50 values in a WoE approach if the studies are not equally reliable.|$|E
