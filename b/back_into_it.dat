5|$|A {{speculator}} to {{his very}} core, Little never put away {{any of his}} fortune {{to prepare for a}} rainy day; any money he made on the stock market, he immediately invested <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>it.</b> Thus when the Panic of 1857 destroyed his investment fortune, Little was left penniless. He would live out {{the rest of his life}} under the wing of his last protége, David Groesbeck. Little was only ever able to make small trading returns to the market in his later years, and the magnitude of his fall was often the target of mockery from his former peers. He died a broken man. Little died on March 28, 1865, and his funeral was held on March 31 at New York's Grace Church. His pall-bearers included Jesse Hoyt and Edward Prime; Reverend Thomas House Taylor officiated at his funeral.|$|E

25|$|Four days later, Parma {{travelled}} to Lecce, {{knowing a}} win {{at the weekend}} against Lecce would mathematically ensure safety. With Zaccardo not fit, Rolf Feltscher was afforded a rare start for the away side and Lecce had the better of the early stages before Parma came <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>it</b> and deserved the lead they took halfway through the second half. It was top scorer Giovinco who found the net with an excellent free-kick. Lecce could have equalised before Parma doubled their lead with a composed finish from Gabriel Paletta who had sprung the offside trap. Nenad Tomović pulled one back with an accurate header late on and Lecce pressed well late on, but failed to get a point. Parma consolidated their place in 9th position.|$|E
25|$|In 1953, the Museum {{celebrated its}} bicentenary. Many changes followed: the first {{full-time}} in house designer and publications officer were appointed in 1964, A Friends organisation {{was set up}} in 1968, an Education Service established in 1970 and publishing house in 1973. In 1963, a new Act of Parliament introduced administrative reforms. It became easier to lend objects, the constitution of the Board of Trustees changed and the Natural History Museum became fully independent. By 1959 the Coins and Medals office suite, completely destroyed during the war, was rebuilt and re-opened, attention turned towards the gallery work with new tastes in design leading to the remodelling of Robert Smirke's Classical and Near Eastern galleries.

25|$|The Red Devils' {{next game}} was against Arsenal the {{following}} Sunday, in a six-pointer that would either rule Arsenal {{out of the}} title race or bring them right <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>it.</b> A United win would put them six points ahead of their nearest league rivals, Chelsea, and nine ahead of Arsenal, and with Chelsea playing the following day, a win was essential {{to put pressure on}} the Blues. Arsenal started the match well, and looked to take the game to United through sheer brute force, attacking with pace and power. Indeed, they created the best chances of the half, United's best opportunity falling to Wayne Rooney, who refused to go down under the challenge of Kolo Touré, before seeing his shot saved by the foot of Jens Lehmann in a one-on-one situation. The first half finished goalless, but it was not long into the second half before the crowd saw the first goal of the game. It was a controversial goal, however, as it seemed that Emmanuel Adebayor had played Cesc Fàbregas' cross into the net with his left arm. Nevertheless, referee Howard Webb gave the goal, seeing nothing wrong with it. Just five minutes later, though, United hit back. Michael Carrick played the ball into the Arsenal penalty area, where it was handled by William Gallas, and the referee had no hesitation in awarding the penalty. As expected, Cristiano Ronaldo took responsibility for the penalty, and coolly swept it into {{the left side of the}} net. However, he was made to take the kick again as Park Ji-sung was deemed to be encroaching on the penalty area before the kick. Fortunately, Ronaldo was just as successful with his second attempt, burying the ball in the bottom left-hand corner. In an attempt to force the issue by going for the winner, Alex Ferguson brought on Carlos Tevez and Anderson in place of Park and Scholes. The Reds were cutting it fine, as Van der Sar was forced to make two reflex saves from his own defenders, Wes Brown and Rio Ferdinand. Tevez then sent a warning shot across the Arsenal bow, shooting narrowly wide from 25yards. Then, with 20 minutes to go, Patrice Evra was brought down just outside the Arsenal box. With the Arsenal defence expecting a typical Ronaldo free-kick, they were caught off guard when Owen Hargreaves played an immaculate free-kick over the wall, dipping into the bottom left corner of the goal, leaving Lehmann rooted to his goal line. United continued to press, not giving Arsenal an inch, and though Van der Sar was called on to save a header from Nicklas Bendtner, the Red Devils managed to hold onto their lead and extend their lead at the top of the table. Chelsea, now the only team with a realistic chance of stopping United winning the title failed to reduce the lead to three points the following day, only managing a 1–1 draw at home to Wigan Athletic. They followed this up with a 1–0 win over Everton the following Thursday, reducing the lead to two points with just three games remaining, although United now had a game in hand.|$|E
500|$|After {{crossing}} Crosswicks Creek, US 130 continues into Hamilton Township, Mercer County, where Route 156 splits to {{the west}} to parallel US 130 as it bypasses Yardville to the east. The route intersects several roads at northbound-only interchanges, including CR 609, CR 672 (South Broad Street), and CR 524 (Yardville- Allentown Road); [...] Route 156 provides southbound access. [...] Past these interchanges, the road passes some homes before Route 156 merges <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>it.</b> From this point, US 130 runs through commercial areas, where it has a brief six-lane segment prior to reaching a cloverleaf interchange with I-195. Following this interchange, the road enters Robbinsville Township. [...] In Robbinsville, the route forms a short concurrency with CR 526. At the point CR 526 turns east, Route 33 joins US 130 from the west. US 130 and Route 33 run together through rural areas with some development. The road bypasses Windsor to the east prior to entering East Windsor Township. Here, the road widens to six lanes and Route 33 splits from US 130, heading east into Hightstown. US 130 narrows back to four lanes and runs around the commercial west side of Hightstown, crossing CR 571. Shortly after this intersection, the route has a partial cloverleaf interchange with Route 133.|$|E
500|$|In 1955, {{after five}} years of reconstruction, the Rotes Rathaus was fully {{operational}} and departments were able to move <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>it</b> from both administration buildings and from other more remote locations. Early in the same year, it was announced that Altes Stadthaus was to be transferred from the Magistrat (now of East Berlin, West Berlin having established the separate Berlin Senate) to the Council of Ministers of the GDR, which had been established in 1949, to house the significantly increased workforce. Altes Stadthaus was planned to be only an interim solution to this problem. Prime Minister Otto Grotewohl moved his offices into the building later that year, after renovation work to create appropriate accommodations that included furnishings for various official rooms, the planned expansion onto the fourth floor, upgrading of the stairways, ventilation equipment, and electrical work had been completed. Red carpets were laid in hallways and stair landings, and eventually paper shredders were placed in all offices. Between 1958–61, the building was extensively altered. The inner courtyard was covered [...] and the [...] "Bear Hall" [...] was converted into the chamber of the Council of Ministers. The hall capacity was reduced from 1,500 to 300 people, the windows and arcades on the long sides were closed off, wood wall moldings and a suspended ceiling installed to create a modern room within the space. The candelabra, bronze door grilles, and marble flooring were removed. In 1959, the bear statue was also removed and installed in the newly opened East Berlin zoo in Friedrichsfelde. A security zone was created {{at the front of the}} building. The public entrance to what was now the [...] "Building of the Council of Ministers" [...] was now on Klosterstraße. The main entrance facing Jüdenstraße, over which the GDR national emblem, the hammer and compass, was installed in place of the arms of the City of Berlin, was only opened on special occasions. The alterations demonstrated the negative opinion in the GDR of Wilhelmine architecture, and cost 2million marks.|$|E

Alex Strachan of the Ottawa Citizen {{felt that the}} episode was very poignant, adding that various scenes were [...] "beautifully acted". In his A– review, Verne Gay of Newsday opined that [...] "Nebraska" [...] accurately established the progression of a dark atmosphere {{for the second half}} of the season. Rawlings asserted that the episode gives the audience [...] "plenty to chew on", and that it nicely sets up a foundation for future storylines. The A.V. Club Zack Halden evoked similar sentiments; [...] "'Nebraska' doesn’t entirely rectify this concern, but it’s a solid hour of television, and a promising indication of where the series is headed." [...] Writing for IGN, Eric Goldman commended the installment's sense of direction; [...] "I liked how this episode thrust us right <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>it,</b> and the understandable misery everyone was going through. [...] It was a mixture of chaos, sadness and zombie killing—a mixture this show can do very well." [...] Concluding his review, Goldman issued [...] "Nebraska" [...] an eight out of ten, signifying a [...] "great" [...] rating. The Atlantic Scott Meslow iterated: [...] "'Nebraska' largely spends its first two acts reiterating things that happened earlier in the season, which in this case can somewhat be forgiven [...] But just when it looks as though the series will devote another episode to wheel-spinning, [...] "Nebraska" [...] surprises with a final act that serves as a reminder of why it's too soon to give up on The Walking Dead." [...] Morgan Jeffrey of Digital Spy noted that it successfully addressed the concerns of fans about the episodic pace, while also raising expectations for succeeding installments. Not all reviewers were enthusiastic about the episode as the general consensus. Boston Herald journalist Mark Perigard affirmed that [...] "Nebraska" [...] was inferior to its predecessor, ultimately giving it a C+ grade. Starlee Kine of New York wrote that it was [...] "just one huge whirlpool of pointless drama, pulling everything in its path under with it", while Entertainment Weekly writer Darren Franich thought that it was a setback from the previous episode.|$|E
