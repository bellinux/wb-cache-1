50|$|A roller <b>brake</b> <b>tester</b> is {{a method}} of {{allowing}} the dynamic assessment of the braking system of a motor vehicle, whilst the vehicle itself is in a static condition. This type of <b>brake</b> <b>tester</b> is normally used in UK garages when used {{as part of an}} inspection lane for the MOT test.|$|E
50|$|There are {{at least}} 3 {{different}} types of <b>brake</b> <b>tester</b> {{used to calculate the}} braking efforts and efficiencies of a motor vehicle. Roller brake testers, which consist of a chassis with a driven roller system; plate brake testers, which consist of 2 parallel measuring plates, and decelerometers which are usually hand held devices.|$|E
50|$|A third smaller roller, on {{each side}} between the driving rollers, has two functions: The first is to detect if a vehicle {{is present in the}} roller bed (a built in safety device to prevent the motor from {{starting}} up unless a vehicle is in the <b>brake</b> <b>tester),</b> the second function is to detect when and if tyre slippage occurs {{in order to make the}} measurement before a maximum, predefined value of time passes.|$|E
50|$|Roller <b>brake</b> <b>testers</b> {{consist of}} a {{mechanical}} floor unit which contains electrical motors, two independent sets of three measuring rollers, brake force transducers and additional safety sensors. The driving rollers operate at a low (known) speed using a gearbox and motor arrangement and during a test measurements of the maximum braking force are taken by applying the vehicle brakes which induces a reaction force on the electric motor itself. An electric transducer with strain gauges then measures the individual induced forces which are acting during the deceleration phase in order to calculate the individual braking forces for each wheel.|$|R

2500|$|Four-wheel {{disc brakes}} were also {{introduced}} in 1965. The brakes had a four-piston design with two-piece calipers and cooling fins for the rotors. Pads were in frequent {{contact with the}} rotors, but the resulting drag was negligible and did not affect fuel economy. Further, the light touching kept the rotors clean and did not diminish pad life, which was, in fact, quite high: a projected [...] for the front brakes and about twice that distance for the rear binders. Total swept area for the new system was , a notable advance on the [...] of the previous all-drum system. Per pending federal regulation, {{there was also a}} dual master cylinder with separate fluid reservoirs (only on models with power brakes for 1965) for the front and rear lines. Road testers rightly applauded the all-disc <b>brakes.</b> <b>Testers</b> found that repeated stops from [...] produced no deterioration in braking efficiency, and even the most sudden stops were rock-stable. The drum brakes remained available, however, as a $64.50 credit option, but only 316 of the 23,562 Corvettes built that year came with drums. A side exhaust system appeared as an option as did a telescopic steering wheel. Also available were alloy spinner rims, at US$322 a set.|$|R
5000|$|A {{decelerometer}} is a {{hand held}} device for measuring dynamic braking forces during a vehicle road test. A vehicle decelerometer operates {{as if it}} were, and {{it could also be}} known as, an accelerometer as it calculates braking efficiency by using those forces captured during a vehicle's deceleration. A decelerometer is a method by which braking effort can be accessed quickly and easily but it is generally used as an indicator to acceptable brake performance. Low efficiency readings should lead to further investigation on a roller <b>brake</b> <b>tester.</b>|$|E
50|$|A plate <b>brake</b> <b>tester</b> is {{a method}} of {{measuring}} a vehicles braking system in a dynamic test. The unit consists of two moving parallel plates mounted on force transducers. A measurement of the braking force is made when a vehicle passes over the plates and then applies its brakes. The braking action causes the individual plates to ‘slip’ forwards allowing a calculation of braking force to be made. Brake imbalance between {{the left and right}} hand side can also be measured by the differences in voltage measured on each of the force transducers under the chassis. Due to the nature of it dynamic operation, plate brake testers are far less common than roller brake testers in UK garages although they are also an extremely accurate method of measurement.|$|E
40|$|Abstract – The {{investigation}} of the roll brake testers used testing for trucks has been made during year 2002. There have been developed a test trail [1], reported in TC- 3 Congress Celle 2002. The aim {{of this investigation was}} to get information about real measurement capability of the roll brake testers used in inspection of the trucks for Finnish authority (The Finnish Vehicle Administration AKE). The usually way to calibrate roll <b>brake</b> <b>tester</b> has been to generate the reference force direct against of the force measurement transducer. This calibration does neither take in to account the mechanical construction of the rollers nor the diameters of them or the dynamic behaviour of the measurement. The investigation gives the information over practical uncertainty of the roll <b>brake</b> <b>tester.</b> The used comparing method has been static with the reference transducer as well quasistatic by the test trail, which makes the control of roll brake testers with the speed of normal use of a roll <b>brake</b> <b>tester,</b> about 3 km/h...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} described herein {{is composed}} of four major areas of practice. It examines the overall performance of runways and provides tools designed to improve current runway operations and management with particular emphasis on contaminated surfaces. Presented in this thesis is an overview of how to design airport pavements {{in order to achieve}} optimal friction by specifically focusing on material selection and construction techniques for rigid and flexible pavements. Rubber buildup and the impact rubber accumulation has on decreasing runway friction, particularly in a range of climatic conditions, is discussed. Four commonly used rubber removal techniques are presented and evaluated. Through this research, an analytical hierarchy process (AHP) decision making protocol was developed for incorporation into airport pavement management systems (APMS). Runway surface condition reporting practices used at the Region of Waterloo International Airport are evaluated and recommendations for improving current practices are identified. Runway surface condition reporting can be improved by removing subjectivity, reporting conditions to pilots in real time, standardizing terminology and measurement techniques, and including runway pictures or sketches to identify contaminant locations where possible. Reports should be incorporated and stored in the APMS. Aircraft braking systems and their effects on landing distances under contaminated conditions are discussed. This thesis presents a proposed solution for monitoring and measuring contaminated runway surfaces and identifying the risks associated with aircraft landing through using the <b>Braking</b> Availability <b>Tester</b> (BAT). Also proposed in this thesis is a testing framework for validating the <b>Braking</b> Availability <b>Tester.</b> The proposed BAT measures interaction between aircraft antiskid braking systems and runway contaminants to determine landing distances more accurately. Finally, this thesis includes a discussion explaining how pavement design, contaminant removal, results from friction tests, and results from the BAT can be incorporated into airport pavement management systems. APMS data can be analyzed to economically optimize and prioritize scheduling of pavement maintenance, preservation and rehabilitation treatments to maintain a high level of service, thereby contributing to runway safety and optimization...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with {{the development of a new}} measurement device for the realistic assessment of braking capability of landing airplanes for winter runways. Landing represents one of the most safety-critical phases of aircraft operation. Aircraft runway excursion incidents occur due to the unpredictability of the runway pavement condition. This is especially true during winter time when the runway is often covered by deformable contaminants. Several accidents are discussed that list the deteriorated condition of the runway pavement and the inability to accurately report this condition as the main causes for the excursions. The accuracy of the approaches currently adopted by the airport authorities around the world to monitor the condition of the runway pavement are evaluated. The conventional and current practice of runway condition monitoring is focused on identifying the maximum tire-pavement frictional drag mu value and often neglects the characteristics of actual aircraft brake control system as well as the comprehensive effects coming from various factors such as deformable contaminants on the winter runway. The <b>braking</b> availability <b>tester</b> discussed here is designed to take a different approach for the realistic assessment of braking availability of landing aircrafts. The main idea of this device is to mimic the braking operation of actual aircrafts as closely as possible by incorporating the same brake mechanism and the brake control system used in existing aircrafts. The architecture of the device from the ground-up including the suite of sensors, the structure of the wheel, important actuators, and the real-time brake control system are discussed in detail. More importantly, the operational principles of the <b>braking</b> availability <b>tester</b> (BAT) are outlined which help one understand how the system works together. A new method to quantify the braking availability on the runway using the BAT is explained. The testing and data collection strategy for implementing this technique is also outlined. Additionally, the results from preliminary tests are presented to verify the functionality of the BAT. The results are used to verify that the BAT operates with the brake control system of an aircraft. Finally, experimental data sets from dry and contaminated pavement testing are presented to show the effect of different weather conditions on the operation of the BAT...|$|R

Author {{corporate}} affiliation: Battelle Memorial Institute, Columbus, Ohio""February 2000. "Final report. July 27 - 29, 1998 This report {{documents the}} results of a series of tests in which several different types of performance-based <b>brake</b> <b>testers</b> (PBBTs) were compared side-by-side (i. e. a round robin test) in their ability to accurately measure brake forces (BFs) and wheel loads (WLs) of commercial vehicles (CVs), and to then predict the vehicle deceleration capability for a 32. 2 km/hr on-road stopping test. The PBBTs consisted of five roller dynamometers (RD), two flat plate (FP) testers, and one breakaway torque tester (BTT). A PBBT that can also meet a set of functional specifications could be used for law enforcement by safety inspectors once performance-based criteria are codified. In the test program, specific ratios of BF to WL were imposed on both a 5 -axle combination tractor semi-trailer and a two-axle straight truck, in both the fully laden and unladen conditions. In each loading condition, the overall vehicle braking capability was set to achieve a proposed minimum requirement of 0. 4 g, where g is the acceleration due to gravity. In addition, the brakes on specific individual wheels were set to provide a BF/WL of 0. 25 and 0. 35, for a steer and a non-steer wheel, respectively. The vehicles were also instrumented to record stopping distances and decelerations from on-road stopping tests performed from 32. 2 km/hr. In general, nearly all of the PBBTs were able to accurately measure the CVs' brake forces. Only one of the FP-type testers experienced erratic performance during the round robin. In contrast several of the PBBTs had difficulty in reporting the accurate gross vehicle weight. In some cases, particularly with the portable PBBTs the reported wheel loads for axles 2 and 4 (the lead axle on the tandem set) of the 5 -axle vehicle were very high, leading to an under-prediction of the vehicle deceleration capability. Calibration checks of the PBBT weighing mechanisms indicated that all could meet the functional specifications. As such, it was concluded that accounting for the redistribution of axle loads due to the vehicle suspension and the geometry of the PBBT ramp would require special test procedures or remote entry of vehicle or axle weights for use in law enforcement. The repeatability of all the PBBTs was good, meeting the acceptability criteria in more than 93 percent of the test casesSubject code: XQCSSubject code: NVHSubject code: NVGBBSubject code: DZNHSubject code: DEFSubject code: WVOSubject code: D...|$|R

40|$|Landing {{excursion}} accidents {{have become}} a major concern over recent decades regarding airline and airport safety. Available runway friction has {{a significant impact on}} aircraft landing performance. This is especially noted when aircraft are landing on wet or otherwise contaminated runways due to the reduced braking action, which has been well documented since the dawn of the jet aircraft age. The objective of this thesis is to develop a tool to help make recommendations for airports that are subjected to diverse weather conditions. In order to model an aircraft’s real landing performance, a mechanistic-empirical aircraft deceleration equation was developed. This equation contains all of the major forces that contribute to aircraft braking, and is calibrated and validated using digital flight data from dry runway aircraft landings. Digital flight data from a Boeing 737 - 700, runway pavement condition monitoring data, and weather data was collected. Finally, a Boeing 737 - 700 case study was conducted. As a result, it is able to back calculate the braking friction coefficient from the developed equation and evaluate the impact of wet and contaminated runways on aircraft braking performance. A study of a Boeing 737 - 700 aircraft landing performance on runways under different conditions was conducted. A mechanistic-empirical landing distance model is established based on the mechanistic-empirical deceleration equation, in order to accurately calculate the required landing distance. When developing the landing distance model, the following characteristics are considered: pilot settings (TLA, spoiler position, and flap position configurations), aircraft operational characteristics (touchdown speed and weight), the runway friction condition, and aircraft braking system characteristics. A Boeing 737 - 700 real data case study was conducted and a comparison was made with the Boeing 737 Quick Reference Handbook reference landing distance. The results indicate the model offers an accurate prediction of aircraft landing distance. Finally, future applications of this thesis are introduced. The potential of the development of a runway assessment, evaluation, and reporting framework was proposed. Opportunities of applying this thesis in on-board landing distance calculation, quick exit taxiway design and airport operation optimization, and fuel consumption reduction were presented. Moreover, the development of the <b>Braking</b> Availability <b>Tester</b> was discussed...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Bandura’s self-efficacy theory postulates that {{confidence}} is a stronger determinant of behaviour than one’s actual skills or abilities. The Day and Night time Driving Comfort Scales (D-DCS and N-DCS) are new tools to measure perceived confidence in older drivers. Developed inductively with older drivers, the DCSs have good structural properties and preliminary psychometric support, including test-retest reliability. Purpose: This thesis builds on previous work by further examining {{the construct validity}} of the DCSs via (1) temporal associations (Study 1) and (2) cross-sectional relationships (Study 2). Study 1 prospectively examined the relationship between DCS scores and self-reported driving behaviour. Study 2, meanwhile, examined cross-sectional associations between DCS scores and selected sample characteristics, self-reported driving behaviour and driving problems, perceived abilities and seven objectively measured driving-related abilities (visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, disability glare, brake reaction time, lower body mobility, executive skills and visual attention). Methods: For Study 1, a convenience sample of 82 older drivers (aged 63 to 93) were assessed at baseline and follow-up (five to 17 months later). Study tools comprised the DCSs, multi-item ratings of driving frequency, avoidance and perceived abilities and a background questionnaire. Telephone interviews were conducted with a subgroup of 45 drivers to examine reasons for changes in driving comfort. For Study 2, cross-sectional relationships with the DCSs were examined using baseline data from 65 drivers (aged 63 to 93). A subgroup of 42 participants completed objective assessments of driving-related abilities assessed via ETDRS charts, Pelli-Robson charts, Brightness Acuity <b>Tester,</b> <b>brake</b> reaction time apparatus, the Rapid Paced Walk, the Trail Making Tests (Parts A and B) and the UFOV subtest 2. Results: Prospectively, lower baseline N-DCS scores (p<. 001) and decreased N-DCS scores (p<. 001) were significant predictors of lower self-reported situational driving frequency (R 2 = 34 %) and greater situational avoidance (R 2 = 51 %) at follow-up. While DCS scores did not change appreciably for those who continued driving, N-DCS scores were significantly lower at follow-up for seven individuals who stopped driving (p<. 05). Cross-sectionally, lower DCS scores were significantly associated with lower self-reported situational driving frequency, higher situational avoidance and lower ratings of perceived abilities (p<. 001). Poorer left eye acuity scores were significantly associated with lower D-DCS (p<. 05) and N-DCS (p<. 05), while slower performance on Part A of the Trail Making Test was significantly related to lower D-DCS scores (p<. 05). Participants with a discrepancy between their perceived and actual abilities had significantly higher D-DCS, situational driving frequency and lower situational avoidance (p<. 05). Conclusions: Findings are consistent with Bandura’s self-efficacy theory and Rudman’s model of driving self-regulation and, thus, provide further support for {{the construct validity of}} the DCSs. Further studies are needed with larger, more diverse samples, including those with diagnosed impairments, to establish benchmarks for driving comfort in healthy drivers and various clinical populations (such as those with stroke, Parkinson’s or visual conditions). Prospective studies should also involve longer follow-up periods, examination of actual driving behaviour and barriers to self-restriction, and attempt to pinpoint whether there is a critical level of discomfort at which voluntary cessation is likely to occur...|$|R

Adaptation of monitoring and control was made on electronic components that control the roller set during the manual and the automatic operation.

40|$|This {{proof-of-concept}} {{research was}} performed to explore the feasibility of using real-world braking data from commercial motor vehicles to make a diagnosis of brake condition {{similar to that of}} the performance-based <b>brake</b> <b>tester</b> (PBBT). This was done by determining the relationship between pressure and brake force (P-BF), compensating for the gross vehicle weight (GVW). The nature of this P-BF relationship (e. g., low braking force for a given brake application pressure) may indicate brake system problems. In order to determine the relationship between brake force and brake application pressure, a few key parameters of duty cycle information were collected. Because braking events are often brief, spanning only a few seconds, a sample rate of 10 Hz was needed. The algorithm under development required brake application pressure and speed (from which deceleration was calculated). Accurate weight estimation was also needed to properly derive the braking force from the deceleration. In order to ensure that braking force was the predominant factor in deceleration for the segments of data used in analysis, the data was screened for grade as well. Also, the analysis needed to be based on pressures above the crack pressure. The crack pressure is the pressure below which the individual brakes are not applied due the nature of the mechanical system. This value, which may vary somewhat from one wheel end to another, is approximately 10 psi. Therefore, only pressures 15 psi and above were used in the analysis. The Department of Energy s Medium Truck Duty Cycle research has indicated that under the real-world circumstances of the test vehicle brake pressures of up to approximately 30 psi can be expected. Several different types of data were collected during the testing task of this project. Constant-pressure stopping tests were conducted at several combinations of brake application pressure (15, 20, 25, and 30 psi), load conditions (moderately and fully laden), and speeds (20 and 30 mph). Data was collected at 10 Hz. Standard and stepped-pressure performance-based brake tests with brake pressure transducers were performed for each loading condition. The stepped-pressure test included the constant-pressure intervals of brake application at 15, 20, 25, and 30 psi. The PBBT data files included 10 Hz streaming data collected during the testing of each axle. Two weeks of real-world duty cycle (driving and braking) data was also collected at 10 Hz. Initial analysis of the data revealed that the data collected in the field (i. e., day-to-day operations) provided the same information as that obtained from the controlled tests. Analysis of the data collected revealed a strong linear relationship between brake application pressure and deceleration for given GVWs. As anticipated, initial speed was not found to be a significant factor in the deceleration-pressure relationship, unlike GVW. The positive results obtained from this proof of concept test point to the need for further research to expand this concept. A second phase should include testing over a wider range of speeds and include medium brake application pressures in addition to the low pressures tested in this research. Testing on multiple vehicles would also be of value. This future phase should involve testing to determine how degradation of braking performance affects the pressure-deceleration relationship...|$|E
