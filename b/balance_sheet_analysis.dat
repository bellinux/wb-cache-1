The present study seeks to analyze the financial position of the Romanian entities that are representative to the energy sector, based on specific indicators of appreciating the financial balance. Within the analysis, indicators such as net situation, working capital, the need of working capital, net treasury and many others were taken into account. Also, within the study we tried to highlight the main differences between the analysis of the financial balance based on the regular <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> and its <b>analysis</b> based on the financial <b>balance</b> <b>sheet.</b> Thereby, one of the main objectives {{of this study is to}} present the main advantages that the financial <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> brings to the analysis of the financial balance and raising the awareness of the stakeholders towards this approach.

40|$|During the 1990 s the Greek {{economy has}} flourished, {{with the help}} of the banking system, which, at the same period, has {{undergone}} considerable deregulation. The stock market “explosion” at the end of the decade has provided the necessary funds for the expansion of many Greek Banks in various countries and particularly those of the Balkan area. Some Greek companies had already expanded their business activities in these countries, which at the time were in the process of transition to the market economy, thus giving to the Greek Banks the incentive to follow their clientele. The expansion of Greek banks in the Balkans was such that they obtained significant market shares in some of the area’s countries. In the current paper we make an effort to examine the feasibility of the expansion of Greek banks in these countries, focusing especially on their financial efficiency.

External holdings of financial {{assets and liabilities}} for both industrial and emerging countries have grown rapidly since the mid- 1990 s, many times exceeding their respective national income, and traditional surveillance methods using flow data are increasingly incapable of satisfactorily explaining the recent major global economic developments. Using Lane and Milesi-Ferretti's (2006) rich data-set of external positions for 145 countries from 1970 to 2004, this paper selects several issues to highlight the usefulness of <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>analysis</b> {{as a tool for}} historical understanding and to examine how it can help in an analysis of possible future vulnerabilities.

The financial balance assumes that the assets, which cannot be paid, by volume and time correspond to the scope and time to availability of the funding.

In this thesis, I link the Stiglitz-Greenwald theory of credit rationing with microeconomic Central and Eastern Europe banking group data over years 2007 and 2009. For the deeper understanding of the credit side of the banking system it is however necessary to analyse banks from a more detailed perspective. Therefore, {{a significant part of the}} thesis is focused on the financial analysis of commercial banks' <b>balance</b> <b>sheets.</b> This <b>analysis</b> then allows finding the reasons why and when did the banks change their behaviour, their approach to clients, businesses when supplying credits.

There are many studies about market reactions and abnormal profits in acquisitions and also about the association between goodwill impairments and the market value. However, the findings of previous studies are somewhat inconsistent. This thesis examines the association between new purchased goodwill and the market value and also the association between goodwill write-offs and the market value. Also the impact that goodwill write-offs have on quality and {{relevance of}} the <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> is studied. <b>Analysis</b> is done through ordinary linear least squares regression.

Goodwill balance can be later impaired if its fair value is lower than its balance value. This goodwill write-off decreases the balance value. Findings show that neither purchased goodwill nor goodwill write-offs are fully associated with the market value. Purchased goodwill has significant positive impact on the market value. On the other hand, goodwill write-offs have significant negative impact on the market value. There is also evidence that after a goodwill write-off is done the <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> better represents its fair value.

40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{the possibility that}} the workings of the financial system contributed the boom-bust cycle in the Finnish credit market since the mid- 1980 s. We begin with a review of the most prominent theoretical arguments about the role of "financial factors". Also the main findings of a vast empirical literature are summed up. This is followed by a description of the salient features of the Finnish credit cycle and the associated banking crisis. The evolution of credit stocks and interest rates are then analyzed on a relatively high level of aggregation {{from the perspective of the}} theoretical arguments discussed. The main conclusions are: First, changes in the <b>balance</b> <b>sheets</b> of firms and households very likely contributed to both the rapid growth of credit in the late 1980 s and its subsequent steep contraction. Second, the observations are also consistent with the conjecture that supply of bank credit very likely increased in the late 1980 s and contracted in the early 1990 relative to other sources of credit. Third, some differences observed in the behaviour of different bank groups suggest that moral hazard related to underpriced bank liabilities may have contributed to the growth of lending in the boom period, and problems with capital adequacy may have constrained bank lending in the early 1990 s. Stylized facts are consistent with these conjectures. However, to reliably infer about these moral hazard and credit crunch hypotheses, in-depth analysis of bank behaviour with micro data is required. Similarly, ascertaining the role of borrower <b>balance</b> <b>sheets</b> requires <b>analysis</b> of borrowers of different characteristics. credit cycle; financial factors; lending policies; moral hazard; credit crunch...|$|R
