All other colored brachiopods are from shallow water too. This kind of color patterns {{may be a}} form of camouflage. Argyrotheca is fastened by a very short and thick stalk. The shell is biconvex with two high and wide ribs radiating close to the midline (a shell-shape called strangulate) and four radiating ribs of declining height and width further lateral (a shell-shape called oppositely multiplicate), smooth or more commonly multiplicate. The inner surface of the shell has many rather coarse pits (or punctae). The larger valve (pedicle valve or ventral valve) has a fairly short stump beak (or subtruncate). The pedicle opening (or foramen) is large (about ⅓× the maximum with of the shell), almost entirely situated in the <b>backfolding</b> part (or delthyrium) of the pedicle valve (submesothyridid to almost hypothyridid), leaving ample space for the small deltidial plates.

In contrast, dissociation of the ligand-binding domains from the stalk and their reorientation relative to the NK cell membrane allowed monovalent binding of MHC-I in cis. The distinct conformations (<b>backfolded</b> and extended) define the structural basis for cis-trans binding by Ly 49 receptors and explain the divergent functional consequences of cis versus trans interactions.

40|$|A {{detailed}} study {{of the relation between}} the aggregate morphology and the molecular shape of 27 1 -alkyl- 4 -(or 2 -) alkyl(or n-alkoxycarbonyl) pyridinium halide surfactants is described. This shape can be expressed in a molecular packing parameter (P) as suggested by Israelachvili. For unbranched 1 -methyl- 4 -n-alkylpyridinium iodides, the packing parameter does not depend on the length of the alkyl chain (n(c)). Spherical micelles formed from these surfactants grow into rodlike micelles. The critical rod concentration (crc) is, however, dependent on n(c). This originates from the dependence of the aggregation number of spherical micelles on n(c), in agreement with predictions based on the ladder model. Alkyl chain branching in 1 -methyl- 4 -(C 12 -alkyl) pyridinium iodides affects the shape of the surfactant. Branching near the headgroup decreases P and dramatically lessens the propensity of the spherical micelle to grow. Branching near the chain end increases P and decreases the crc. Highly branched surfactant monomers associate into bilayers, which can be transformed into vesicles. The overall results indicate that the morphology of the aggregate is mainly dependent on the shape of the surfactant. The possibility for <b>backfolding</b> of the 1 -alkyl chain of 1 -alkyl- 4 -n-dodecylpyridinium iodide surfactants directly affects the preferred morphology of the aggregate. Bilayers are formed if <b>backfolding</b> occurs; otherwise spherical micelles are formed, which, on increasing surfactant concentration, grow into rodlike micelles. Interestingly, 1 -methyl- 4 -(n-alkoxycarbonyl) pyridinium iodides associate into bilayers, independent of the length of the alkyl chain (n(c) = 10 - 16). This aggregation behavior probably stems from a special kind of interdigitation, which changes the geometrical constraints for packing into a bilayer...|$|E
40|$|The {{metamorphism}} of the carbonate {{rocks of}} the SE Zanskar Tibetan zone {{has been studied}} by `'illite crystallinity'' and calcite-dolomite thermometry. The epizonal Zangla unit overlies the anchizonal Chumik unit. This discontinuous inverse zonation demonstrates a late to post-metamorphic thrust of the first unit over the second. The studied area underwent a complex tectonic history: - The tectonic units were stacked from the NE to the SW, generating recumbent folds, NE dipping thrusts and the regional metamorphism. The compressive movements were active under lower temperature conditions, resulting in late thrusts that disturbed the metamorphic zonation. The discontinuous inverse metamorphic zonation dates from this phase. - A NE vergent <b>backfolding</b> phase occurred at lower temperature conditions. It caused the uplift of more metamorphic levels. - A late extensional phase is revealed {{by the presence of}} NE dipping low angle normal faults, and a major high angle fault, the Sarchu fault. The low angle normal faults locally run along earlier thrusts (composite tectonic contacts). Their throw has been sufficient to reset a normal stratigraphic superposition (young layers overlying old ones), but insufficient to erase the inverse metamorphic relationship. However, the combined action of <b>backfolding</b> and normal faulting can locally lessen, or even cancel, the inverse metamorphic superposition. After deduction of the normal fault translation, the vertical component of the original thrust displacement through stratigraphy is 400 m, which is a value far too low to explain the temperature difference between the two units. The horizontal component of displacement is therefore far more important than the vertical one. The regional distribution of metamorphism within the Zangla unit points out to an anchizonal front and an epizonal inner part. This fact is in agreement with nappe tectonics...|$|E
40|$|Natural killer (NK) cells {{discriminate}} between healthy and virally infected or transformed cells using diverse surface receptors {{that are both}} activating and inhibitory. Among them, the homodimeric Ly 49 NK receptors, which can adopt two distinct conformations (<b>backfolded</b> and extended), are of particular importance for detecting cells infected with mouse cytomegalovirus (CMV) via recognition of the viral immunoevasin m 157. The interaction of m 157 with activating (Ly 49 H) and inhibitory (Ly 49 I) receptors governs the spread of mouseCMV. Wecarried out kinetic and thermodynamic experiments to elucidate the Ly 49 /m 157 binding mechanism. Combining surface plasmon resonance, fluorescence anisotropy, and circular dichroism (CD), we determined that the best model to describe both the Ly 49 H/m 157 and Ly 49 I/m 157 interactions is a conformational selection mechanism where only the extended conformation of Ly 49 (Ly 49 *) is able to bind the first m 157 ligand followed by binding of the Ly 49 */m 157 complex to the second m 157. The interaction is characterized by strong positive cooperativity such that the second m 157 binds the Ly 49 homodimer with a 1000 -fold higher sequential constant than the first m 157 (108 versus 105 M- 1). Using far-UV CD, we obtained evidence for a conformational change in Ly 49 upon binding m 157 that could explain the positive cooperativity. The rate-limiting step of the overall mechanism is a conformational transition in Ly 49 from its <b>backfolded</b> to extended form. The global thermodynamic parameters from the initial state (<b>backfolded</b> Ly 49 and m 157) to the final state (Ly 49 */(m 157) 2) are characterized by an unfavorable enthalpy that is compensated by a favorable entropy, making the interaction spontaneous.

40|$|The Annapurna Detachment (AD) is a lowangle (~ 20 °- 30 ° dip), north-dipping {{normal fault}} and ductile high-strain shear zone in calc-mylonites, and forms {{part of the}} South Tibetan Detachment (STD) that runs along 1800 km length of the Himalaya. The AD {{separates}} kyanite and sillimanite grade gneisses and tremolite + clinopyroxene ± hornblendebearing marble-calc-silicates of the Greater Himalayan Sequence (GHS) below from unmetamorphosed Palaeozoic-Mesozoic sedimentary rocks of the Tethyan sedimentary zone above. It was active at ca. 22 - 18 Ma during south-vergent ductile extrusion (channel fl ow) and exhumation of the Himalayan midcrust footwall. Restoration of the STD system suggests around 80 - 100 km of southward extrusion of the footwall gneisses relative to the Tethyan hanging-wall rocks. Folds in the hanging wall of the AD were formed prior to normal faulting, but axial planes are curved into alignment with the shear zone suggesting extrusion of the metamorphic footwall rocks beneath a passive roof fault. North-vergent recumbent <b>backfolds</b> in the Nilgiri-Tukuche peaks were enhanced by backsliding during footwall extrusion, although this does not indicate "orogenic collapse," lowering of surface elevation, or decreasing crustal thickness because new material was continually being underthrust from the south. Axial planes of <b>backfolds</b> are curved and progressively rotate from subvertical in the north to subhorizontal immediately above the AD. Low-angle normal faults in the Himalaya were active during the Early Miocene, concomitantly with thrusting at deeper structural levels along the Main Central Thrust (MCT) zone.

40|$|The {{structure}} of a brush made of arm-grafted polymer stars is investigated using the Scheutjens–Fleer self-consistent field method. By using the “probe macromolecule” approach, conditional distributions of end- and branching points were obtained, which allowed for {{a detailed analysis of}} intramolecular correlations in the brush. Results strongly support a previously suggested “two population” picture of the star structure: stars in the brush are divided into two populations (i) those with weakly extended arms and (ii) those with a very strongly stretched grafting arm (stem) and all free arms extended toward the solvent. The stars in the “stretched” population have no arms that fold back toward the grafting surface and their free arms form a new sub-brush with effective grafting density determined solely by the total surface loading: molecular mass of polymer grafted onto unit area. With increasing grafting density or/and number of star arms the fraction of stars in the “stretched” population grows. The degree of <b>backfolding</b> of arms is estimated, the total fraction of backfolded arms is invariably small and decreases with increasing grafting density; only stars of the weakly extended population contribute to <b>backfolding.</b> The free ends within a given star are correlated: the ends of different arms are located approximately at the same distance from the grafting plane. Comparison of conditional ends distributions at fixed position of the branching points at different grafting densities reveals a conformational universality of grafted stars belonging to the weakly stretched population: the shape of the ends distribution does not depend on the grafting density but is determined solely by the position of the branching point. We also present analytical arguments showing that this effect is due to universal parabolic self-consistent potential acting on monomer units in the star brush, this potential is independent of the grafting density and the number of star arms...|$|E

The energy dispersion and the lifetime of an unoccupied one-dimensional (1 D) nanowire-localized electronic band with sp character are obtained.

The Lofoten archipelago, north Norway, {{occupies}} the most inter-nal {{position of the}} Caledonian belt in northern Scandinavia, and rocks and structures exposed there are crucial to understanding processes of how the Baltic basement and its cover allochthons responded to continental lithospheric subduc-tion and subsequent continental separation.

These prerequisites allow ARPES to observe energy dispersion of bands above E F without normalization procedures and a leading edge of the Fermi-Dirac distribution cutoff, which is considerably shifted to the unoccupied region with respect to E F. As a consequence we conclude that the Ti 3 d band is only thermally occupied at room temperature and considerably shifts towards the occupied range upon cooling.

A major thrust, called the Kum Tso Thrust, has been <b>backfolded</b> and reactivated by normal faulting {{associated with this}} event. Measurements of the Kubler index, coupled with characterization of clay-size paragenesis show the effect of normal faulting on the regional metamorphic zonation and indicate that important extension zones, like the Sarchu-Lachung La Normal Fault Zone (SLFZ), exist within the Tethyan Himalaya.
