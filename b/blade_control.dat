40|$|Two control schemes {{designed}} to alleviate gust-induced vibration are analytically investigated for a helicopter with four articulated blades. One {{is an individual}} <b>blade</b> pitch <b>control</b> scheme. The other is an adaptive <b>blade</b> pitch <b>control</b> algorithm based on linear optimal control theory. In both controllers, control inputs to alleviate gust response are superimposed on the conventional control inputs required to maintain the trim condition. A sinusoidal vertical gust model and a step gust model are used. The individual <b>blade</b> pitch <b>control,</b> in this research, is composed of sensors and a pitch control actuator for each blade. Each sensor can detect flapwise (or lead-lag or torsionwise) deflection of the respective <b>blade.</b> The acturator <b>controls</b> the <b>blade</b> pitch angle for gust alleviation. Theoretical calculations to predict the performance of this feedback system have been conducted {{by means of the}} harmonic method. The adaptive <b>blade</b> pitch <b>control</b> system is composed of a set of measurements (oscillatory hub forces and moments), an identification system using a Kalman filter, and a control system based on the minimization of the quadratic performance function...|$|R

The unit operated for about 1000 hours between startup and February 1943, when a shaft bearing failed. Due to wartime material priorities, the bearing was not replaced until March 3, 1945, when the unit achieved another three weeks of operation.|$|E

The individual blades control law for a five-blade main rotor based on the blade frequencies is made. It allows reducing the vibration from thrust. Research takes into account the main rotor including and excluding the blade flapping motion. The minimal vibrations regime is identified. Numerical study of variable loads caused by unsteady flow around the main rotor blades at high relative speeds of flight, which transmitted to the rotor hub, is made. The scheme of a thin lifting surface and the rotor vortex theory are used for simulation of the aerodynamic loads on blades. Non - uniform loads caused by the thrust, decomposed on the blade harmonic and its overtones. The largest values of deviation from the mean amplitude thrust are received. The analysis of variable loads with a traditional control system is made. Algorithms of higher harmonics individual <b>blade</b> <b>control</b> capable of reducing the thrust pulsation under the average value of thrust are developed. Numerical research shows that individual <b>blade</b> <b>control</b> of high harmonics reduces variable loads. The necessary change in the blade installation is about Â± 0, 2 degree that corresponds to the maximum displacement of the additional con- trol stick is about 1 mm. To receive the overall picture is necessary to consider all six components of forces and moments. Control law with own constants will obtained for each of them. It is supposed, that each of six individual <b>blade</b> <b>control</b> laws have an impact on other components. Thus, the problem reduces to the optimization issue. The individual <b>blade</b> <b>control</b> general law will be received as a result. It will meet a lot of conflicting requirements...|$|E

The aircraft considered were a 125 foot diameter six-bladed rotor helicopter and an 85 foot diameter four-bladed rotor tilt rotor. The objectives were to reduce power required and increase maximum lift. The effects of improved airfoils and active controls were investigated. Airfoils with higher maximum lift and with reduced drag were investigated. Results showed a moderate improvement in the maximum lift capability for the helicopter and a large improvement for the tilt rotor. For the helicopter, 2 /rev individual <b>blade</b> <b>control</b> resulted in modest power savings in cruise flight, which increased with control amplitude and forward speed.

40|$|AbstractIt can {{be greatly}} {{beneficial}} {{to remove the}} swashplate of conventional helicopter, because the swashplate is usually complicated, aerodynamically resistive, and obstacle of more complex pitch control for improving performance. The present technologies for helicopter vibration reduction are usually narrow in effective range or requiring additional actuators and signal transfer links, and more effective technology is desired. Helicopter <b>blade</b> pitch <b>control</b> system, which is removed of swashplate and integrated high-frequency pitch control function for active vibration reduction, is likely the suitable solution at current technical level. Several potential implementation schemes are discussed, such as blades being directly or indirectly driven by actuators mounted in rotating frame and application {{of different types of}} actuators, especially implementation schemes of electro-mechanical actuator with or without gear reducer. It is found that swashplateless <b>blade</b> pitch <b>control</b> system based on specially designed limited angle direct-drive motor (LADDM) is a more practical implementation scheme.

Consequently, turbomachinery components, such as turbine and compressor blades, have designs that are susceptible to new vibration problems and eventual in-service failure due to high-cycle fatigue. To address this problem, researchers at the NASA Glenn Research Center are developing and testing innovative active <b>blade</b> vibration <b>control</b> concepts. Preliminary results of using an active <b>blade</b> vibration <b>control</b> system, involving a rotor supported by an active magnetic bearing in Glenn's Dynamic Spin Rig, indicate promising results (see the photograph). Active <b>blade</b> vibration <b>control</b> was achieved using feedback of blade strain gauge signals within the magnetic bearing control loop. The vibration amplitude was reduced substantially (see the graphs). Also, vibration amplitude amplification was demonstrated; this {{could be used to}} enhance structural mode identification, if desired. These results were for a nonrotating two-bladed disk. Tests for rotating blades are planned. Current and future active <b>blade</b> vibration <b>control</b> research is planned to use a fully magnetically suspended rotor and smart materials. For the fully magnetically suspended rotor work, three magnetic bearings (two radial and one axial) will be used as actuators instead of one magnetic bearing. This will allow additional degrees of freedom to be used for control. For the smart materials work, control effectors located on and off the blade will be considered. Piezoelectric materials will be considered for on-the-blade actuation, and actuator placement on a stator vane, or other nearby structure, will be investigated for off-the-blade actuation. Initial work will focus on determining the feasibility of these methods by performing basic analysis and simple experiments involving feedback control...|$|R

Traditional control techniques use position and velocity information feedback, but velocity information for infinite dimensional systems is not easily attained. This research investigates the use of reduced-sensing control for these applications. Reduced-sensing control uses feedback of position measurements and an associated filter state to stabilize the system dynamics. A filter state is a nonphysical entity that appends an additional ordinary differential equation to the system dynamics. Asymptotic stability of a system using this control approach is confirmed through a sequence of existing mathematical tools. These tools include equilibrium point solutions, Lyapunov functions for stability and control, and Mukherjee and Chen's Asymptotic Stability Theorem. This thesis research investigates the stability of a beam representing an airplane wing or a VAWT <b>blade</b> <b>controlled</b> using feedback of position and filter state terms only.
