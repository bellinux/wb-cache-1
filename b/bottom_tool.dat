50|$|Three-point bending is a newer {{process that}} uses a die with an adjustable-height <b>bottom</b> <b>tool,</b> moved by a servo motor. The height can be set within 0.01 mm. Adjustments between the ram and the upper tool are made using a {{hydraulic}} cushion, which accommodates deviations in sheet thickness. Three-point bending can achieve bend angles with 0.25 deg. precision. While three-point bending permits high flexibility and precision, it also entails high costs and there are fewer tools readily available. It is being used mostly in high-value niche markets.|$|E
50|$|Some of {{the newer}} <b>bottom</b> <b>tools</b> are adjustable, so, by using a single set of top and <b>bottom</b> <b>tools</b> and varying press-stroke depth, {{different}} profiles and products can be produced. Different materials and thicknesses can be bent in varying bend angles, adding the advantage of flexibility to air bending. There are also fewer tool changes, thus, higher productivity.|$|R

30|$|The thrust forces {{predicted}} by the two criteria are also different. Both thrust forces remain negative at the early stage but increase gradually and turn into positive, reaching nearly 0.5  N and 3.5  N, respectively, at a later stage. In the beginning, the thrust force is negative because at the initial stage of penetration of the tool edge into workpiece, the workpiece contacts the tool edge and the rake area. Besides the reaction forces ahead in the horizontal direction, the tool also encounters a reaction force from upper left perpendicular to the tool rake. The resultant force has a negative (downwards) thrust force component. However, with additional advances of the tool, when the contacts between the workpiece and the <b>bottom</b> of <b>tool</b> edge and the tool flank are established, the reaction force from the <b>tool</b> <b>bottom</b> becomes dominant, which results in a positive thrust force.|$|R
50|$|In bottoming, {{the sheet}} is forced against the V {{opening in the}} <b>bottom</b> <b>tool.</b> U-shaped {{openings}} cannot be used. Space is left between the sheet and {{the bottom of the}} V opening. The optimum width of the V opening is 6 T (T stands for material thickness) for sheets about 3 mm thick, up to about 12 T for 12 mm thick sheets. The bending radius must be at least 0.8 T to 2 T for sheet steel. Larger bend radius require about the same force as larger radii in air bending, however, smaller radii require greater force—up to five times as much—than air bending. Advantages of bottoming include greater accuracy and less springback. A disadvantage is that a different tool set is needed for each bend angle, sheet thickness, and material. In general, air bending is the preferred technique.|$|E

Our method “harmonizes ” the images before blending them, producing a composite that is seamless and realistic (c). The close-up images (d) compare traditional gradient-domain blending (top) to the harmonized result (bottom). Traditional image compositing techniques, such as alpha matting and gradient domain compositing, are used to create composites that have plausible boundaries. But when applied to images taken from different sources or shot under different conditions, these techniques can produce unrealistic results. In this work, we present a framework that explicitly matches the visual appearance of images through a process we call image harmonization, before blending them. At the heart of this framework is a multi-scale technique that allows us to transfer the appearance of one image to another. We show that by carefully manipulating the scales of a pyramid decomposition of an image, we can match contrast, texture, noise, and blur, while avoiding image artifacts. The output composite can then be reconstructed from the modified pyramid coefficients while enforcing both alpha-based and seamless boundary constraints. We show how the proposed framework can be used to produce realistic composites with minimal user interaction in a number of different scenarios...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Chatter {{is almost}} an {{unavoidable}} phenomenon during machining, normally {{accompanied by a}} characteristic sharp and monotonous noise. Apart from noise pollution in the industry, chatter leaves a bad surface finish on the part and negatively influences dimensional tolerances, reduced productivity, excessive tool wear and damaged machine-tool components. Therefore, chatter avoidance is utmost importance. However, a deeper investigation into chatter formation reveals that chatter appears during metal cutting process {{as a result of}} resonance caused by interaction of the prominent natural frequencies of the system with the frequency of chip serration.

The algorithm computes swept sections, profiles which are swept by a moving <b>tool</b> <b>bottom</b> by passing through given planes. The technique is applicable for finish and semi-finish multi-axis milling strategies that use flat-end tools. For these strategies, the algorithm complexity can be reduced from computation of the 3 D envelope of swept volumes to computation of plane-circle intersections. A new adaptive derivative-free method to sample tool motion provides robust means to generate intermediate tool positions. The step length is constrained by and dependent on different geometrical measures. At each point of a tool path, in the plane perpendicular to the cutting direction, the bottom profile of the swept section is an estimate of the profile of material left. By calculating the distance between part geometry and the computed profile of removed material, machining strip width and a scallop profile can be derived.

Titanium alloys are {{attractive}} materials for aerospace industry {{due to their}} exceptional strength to weight ratio that is maintained at elevated temperatures and their good corrosion resistance. Major applications of Titanium alloys were military aerospace industry, but since last decade the trend has now shifted towards commercial industry. On the other hand Titanium alloys are notorious for being poor thermal conductor that leads to them being difficult materials for machining. In this experimental study brazed carbide end mill of grade 5 is used for rough down milling of Ti 6 Al 4 V for large depth of cut under different combinations of parameters and application of high pressure coolant. The machining performance was evaluated in terms of tool wear, tool life, thermal crack and tool breaking.

Flank wear due to scratching of the cutting chips and diffusion wear because of high thermal stresses were observed specially {{at the bottom of}} the cutting tool. At cutting speed of 38 m/min tool wear couldn’t be observed due to tool failure because of fracture under high thermal stresses. It was found that maximum tool life is obtained at the speed of 25 m/min, feed rate of 150 mm/min and depth of cut of 10 mm. In the end it was concluded that machining of Ti 6 Al 4 V is a thermally dominant process which leads to high thermal stresses in machining zone that results in increasing tool wear rate and fracture propagation...|$|R
40|$|Vibration and {{cavitation}} can {{be generated}} in many ways and serve many useful purposes. This study describes physical aspects of useful vibration and cavitation for {{a broad spectrum of}} applications at atmospheric or elevated pressures. After a review of available devices, hydrodynamic vibrating-body-in-pipe tools as described in patents by Ivannikov are identified as having a major potential and being largely unexplored. Major advantages of these tools are simplicity of construction, scalability, powerful effects and attractive frequency range for well cleaning applications. Self induced vibration with a free body colliding with the pipe wall causes alternating flow around the body with a water hammer effect that enhances the vibration and cavitation. Cavitation can thus be generated at lower flow rates and at higher backpressures than with passive tools such as orifices. Cavitational collapse at high backpressure creates exceptionally strong effects, giving access to novel applications. At backpressures where even water hammer enhanced cavitation ceases to exist, very strong vibrations persist to pressure levels encountered in deep wells. This unique dual enhanced vibration and cavitation behaviour of the tools is the key to vibrating-body-in-pipe technology for which the new name VibroCav was coined. The study focuses on VibroCav tools with balls, except for one series of tests with a so-called flip-flop body. Exploratory tests in a 350 bar test circuit in Assen lead to the design of a 50 bar laboratory closed test circuit installed in the 3 ME lab in Delft with facilities to apply up to 10 bar backpressure and up to 40 bar pressure differentials over the tools. In the 50 bar test circuit many experiments were carried out, firstly with bottom supported balls in a straight pipe and secondly with hanging balls in a pipe with a conical outlet allowing remote adjustment of the gap between the ball and the pipe wall. The influence of water composition, gas content and various ball materials was tested. Selected high backpressure test were carried out with a 350 bar closed test circuit in Drachten. A total of 29 field trials on an industrial scale were carried out for cleaning the porous media around water and oil wellbores under widely varying conditions and 5 field trials were done to evaluate the potential of the technology for the removal of scale deposits in wellbores. The laboratory experiments with the 50 bar test circuit delineated various operational modes of the VibroCav tools as function of flow rate and backpressure with regimes designated as (i) vibration only, (ii) active cavitation always combined with vibration, (iii) no vibration and passive cavitation and (iv) no vibration and no passive cavitation. The vibration regime persists to the maximum backpressure that could be reached and probably to much higher pressures, however at high flow rate conditions and a narrow gap vibration ceases when the Re value increases beyond the point of drag reduction due to shifting of the boundary separation point (Re approximately 3 x 105 for unbounded flow). Active cavitation is just as passive cavitation subdued by increasing backpressure; but in this test circuit it has still been observed at a backpressure of 63 barg. With a <b>bottom</b> supported <b>tool</b> as used in this test circuit a significant path downstream of the ball is obscured and active cavitation closer to the gap might still exist. This is the basis for the expectation that for this tool active cavitation may survive up to 100 barg backpressure. Tools with a hanging ball, in which cavitation is more clearly visible, were not tested at such high backpressures. The influence of water quality and gas content proved to be insignificant. Lightweight balls showed in <b>bottom</b> supported <b>tools</b> violent vibration and strong active cavitation but were easily damaged by the high contact forces between the ball and the support. With hard steel balls and softer steel supports, bedding-in is observed due to contact forces beyond the elastic limit of the support. If the ball is softer than the support, the ball flattens, breaks or is otherwise damaged by the support. The field trials for cleaning porous media around wellbores combined with theoretical analysis provided valuable semi-quantitative understanding of the influence of frequency, source directivity, source energy, wellbore geometry and permeability damage on the penetration depth of sources for vibration based well cleaning. The most significant wave energy for cleaning porous media is provided by the slow Biot wave, which is a compressional wave in fluid in the interconnected pore network. The higher the virgin permeability of the rock and the lower the wave frequency the better is the penetration depth. Permeability deterioration due to pore fouling reduces the penetration depth of the cleaning treatment and with progressive fouling the pore damage may get out of reach of the cleaning tools. The limited number of scale removal trials showed significant potential of the VibroCav tools due to the combination of physical hammering, jetting, wave energy and shock waves of collapsing cavitation bubbles. The study provides a solid basis for a scientifically founded continuation of the development of VibroCav technology for many areas of application in several industrial sectors and should be regarded as the precursor for a range of innovating techniques. 3 MEMechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineerin...|$|R
