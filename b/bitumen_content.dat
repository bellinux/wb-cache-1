5000|$|The word [...] "asphalt" [...] {{is derived}} from the late Middle English, in turn from French asphalte, based on Late Latin asphalton, asphaltum, which is the latinisation of the Greek ἄσφαλτος (ásphaltos, ásphalton), a word meaning [...] "asphalt/bitumen/pitch", which perhaps derives from ἀ-, [...] "without" [...] and σφάλλω (sfallō), [...] "make fall". The first use of asphalt by the ancients was in the nature of a cement for {{securing}} or joining together various objects, and it thus seems likely that the name itself was expressive of this application. Specifically, Herodotus mentioned that bitumen was brought to Babylon to build its gigantic fortification wall. From the Greek, the word passed into late Latin, and thence into French (asphalte) and English ("asphaltum" [...] and [...] "asphalt"). In French, the term asphalte is used for naturally occurring asphalt-soaked limestone deposits, and for specialised manufactured products with fewer voids or greater <b>bitumen</b> <b>content</b> than the [...] "asphaltic concrete" [...] used to pave roads.|$|E

40|$|In bitumen {{recovery}} from oil sands, {{a percentage of}} the bitumen is lost to tailings. The effect of fugitive bitumen on fines settling and consolidation in tailings ponds remains controversial. In the current study, the settling performance of mature fine tailings (MFT) in response to flocculant addition was considered by studying MFT of varying <b>bitumen</b> <b>content.</b> <b>Bitumen</b> <b>content</b> in the MFT was adjusted by controlled removal of bitumen using a Denver flotation cell. The initial settling rate of flocculated MFT was observed to increase with decreasing <b>bitumen</b> <b>content</b> from 0. 45 to 0. 18 wt%. A further reduction in <b>bitumen</b> <b>content</b> was found to dramatically decrease the settling rate of flocculated MFT. Such behaviour seems counterintuitive since the polymer flocculant was found to have a greater affinity for 'clean' surfaces (Al 2 O 3) than for bitumen contaminated surfaces, as measured by quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D), which would predict a further increase in settling rate of flocculated MFT with decreasing <b>bitumen</b> <b>content.</b> The reduction in settling rate below a critical <b>bitumen</b> <b>content</b> is thought to result from selective removal of hydrophobic solids, since washing of untreated MFT with toluene is shown to significantly improve settling of flocculated solids.

However, mix design procedures for foamed bitumen mixes are still under development. In this paper a method to determine the optimum <b>bitumen</b> <b>content</b> for given foamed bitumen mix based on primary aggregate structure porosity and indirect tensile strength criterion is proposed. Using packing theory concepts, the aggregate gradation is divided into three aggregate structures which are oversize, primary and secondary structures.

In these tests, either the oscillatory displacement amplitude or strain amplitude {{applied to the}} bottom of the specimen is kept constant. The evolution of loading required to cause fatigue is then measured. Load amplitude decreases with the number of cycles, and the specimen is considered to have failed when the load is half its initial value. This failure criterion may be erroneous when non-fragile fracture mixtures prepared with high <b>bitumen</b> <b>contents</b> or modified binders are tested. In these cases, mixtures exhibit a visco-plastic behaviour and increasingly less stress is necessary to cause strain without cracking. Mixtures are hardly deteriorated when the fatigue failure is determined, and may be subjected to a larger number of load repetitions. It is then recommended to control the evolution of loading more effectively and regard as valid only tests where load decreases sharply to very low levels, making sure that the three stages in the fatigue process have occurred.
