40|$|In this paper, we empirically {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} diagonal cumulation on free trade agreement (FTA) utilization by exploring Thai exports to Japan under two kinds of FTA schemes. While the one scheme adopts <b>bilateral</b> <b>cumulation,</b> the other scheme does diagonal cumulation. Comparing trade under these two kinds of FTAs, we can {{examine the effect of}} diagonal cumulation without relying on not only the variation in cumulation rules across country pairs but also the variation across years. In short, our estimates do not suffer from biases from time-variant elements and country pair-specific elements. As a result, our estimates show around 4 % trade creation effect of diagonal cumulation, which is much smaller than the estimates in the previous studies (around 15 %) ...|$|E
40|$|Preferential {{arrangements}} (bilateral {{and multilateral}} free trade areas and GSP systems (preferences for developing countries)) are emerging {{everywhere in the}} world trading system and are causing concern because they discriminate against non-members and add complexity, distortions and inconsistency to the global system. Rules of origin (ROOs) linked to these arrangements are {{a significant part of the}} problem. More and more they have become the source in their own right of distortions in trade patterns, complexity, non-transparency and inconsistency. This essay argues that WTO members should authorize negotiations seeking to harmonize preferential ROOs (rules of origin linked to preferential arrangements) around core principles consistent with WTO rules. The harmonized preferential ROOs should be aligned as much as possible with the harmonized regime for non-preferential ROOs (rules of origin linked to non-preferential arrangements) likely to emerge from the current hold-over WTO negotiations authorized by the Uruguay Round ROOs Agreement. They should be nonrestrictive, based essentially on the principle that substantial transformation confers origin, and - except where developing countries benefit - should not allow cumulation (treating product components from within the preferential region as locally produced). Existing preferential ROOs not consistent with these principles could be argued to violate Article XXIV, and in some cases Article III, of GATT 1994. In the case of developing country preferences, <b>bilateral</b> <b>cumulation</b> in GSP systems could be argued to violate the Enabling Clause...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the key issues}} and assesses {{the impact of the}} rules of origin (RoO) and cumulation on Nigeria’s international trade within the context of Africa-EU partnerships agreements. The review of literatures shows that RoO are an important element in determining the final benefit associated with the bilateral trade relationship under preferential trade agreements. It notes that Africa-EU bilateral trade relations dates back to the Lome Conventions that gave preferential entry into EU of some products, and now to the new Africa-EU partnership which lays less emphasis on RoO. An analysis of available data show that RoO have had limited impact on Nigeria’s exports trade with the EU since her major exports (crude oil) does not benefit from RoO. Instead, there has been an increase in intermediate imports from EU which suggests trade creation in favour of EU while the rising trend in trade within Africa could be the result of <b>bilateral</b> <b>cumulation</b> and intra-Africa FTAs/economic integration. The paper further argues that the increase in trade with USA and others {{may be the result of}} trade reorientation as a result of switching from EU to other cheaper partner countries, especially USA in the face of AGOA. Among the challenges which militate against the RoO are: global reduction in tariff by WTO and the changing focus of the objectives of Africa-EU partnership principles from PTA to regional support. In concluding, the paper notes that the new partnership agreements needs to reconsider its position on RoO as it is a potent tool that is mutually beneficial in partnership. As such, the EU must go beyond the WTO GSP and AGOA to give preferential treatment to goods originating from Africa. ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{sheds light}} on the {{restrictive}} nature of rules of origin (ROO) and {{on the role of}} diagonal cumulation in mitigating the protectionist content of ROO. Empirical evidence suggests that diagonal cumulation has beneficial effects on trade - particularly among spoke countries. We show that these patterns can be reconciled with a theoretical setting where heterogeneous firms buy intermediate inputs from domestic and foreign sources. The model finds that switching from <b>bilateral</b> to diagonal <b>cumulation</b> relaxes the restrictiveness of the ROO and leads the least productive exporters to stop exporting...|$|R
40|$|We analyse {{the impact}} of {{relaxing}} rules of origin (ROOs) in a simple setting with heterogeneous firms that buy intermediate inputs from domestic and foreign sources. In particular, we consider {{the impact of}} switching from <b>bilateral</b> to diagonal <b>cumulation</b> when using preferences (instead of paying the MFN tariff) involving the respect of rules of origin. We find that relaxing the restrictiveness of the ROOs leads the least productive exporters to stop exporting. The empirical part confirms these results. We use the most recent techniques developed by Helpman, Melitz and Rubinstein (2007) on highly disaggregated data (HS 6 digit) to analyse {{the effects of the}} introduction of the Pan-European Cumulation System (PECS). We find that PECS reverses the negative impact of strict ROOs on intermediate trade which turns positive as a consequence of introducing diagonal ROCs.

40|$|The paper {{provides}} quantitative {{estimates of}} the impact of the European trade agreements on trade flows. It applies both static and dynamic panel estimation techniques. The results are useful to policymakers because new intra-European trade agreements are being negotiated. In the absence of a further expansion of the European Union, estimates of alternative policies may help to clarify the policy debate. The paper also illustrates that the performance of individual countries under the trade agreements can be explained in terms of their macroeconomic environment. The conclusions are likely to be relevant to the western Balkan countries and Ukraine.
