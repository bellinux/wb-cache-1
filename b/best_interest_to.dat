5|$|On several occasions, Park was {{the number}} one {{trending}} topic on Twitter, even topping the Oscars on March 8. Park's fans revealed plans to release a self-produced album in his honor on March 27 to commemorate the 200th day anniversary of his departure from Korea. However, because the album had been in preparation since January and public opinion on 2PM had since changed, the fans {{decided it would be}} in the <b>best</b> <b>interest</b> <b>to</b> not release the CD, and instead, mailed 1020 copies to Seattle, Park's hometown.|$|E
5|$|The essay {{begins by}} declaring that anarchists had {{correctly}} resisted the war from its inception, {{and that the}} authors would prefer a peace brought about by an international conference of European workers. It then submits that German workers would most likely also favor such a conclusion to the war, and presents several reasons why {{it would be in}} their <b>best</b> <b>interest</b> <b>to</b> call for an armistice. These reasons were that the citizens, after twenty months of war, would understand that they had been deceived into believing they were taking part in a defensive war; that they would recognize that the German state had long prepared for such a conflict, and as such it would be inevitably at fault; that the German Empire could not logistically support an occupation of the territory it had captured; and that the individuals living in the occupied territories were free to choose whether or not they would like to be annexed.|$|E
5|$|Bohr's {{evidence}} {{came from}} an interpretation of a letter he received from a Soviet friend and scientist in Russia, which he showed to the British security services. He reasoned that the longer the United States and Britain hid their nuclear advancements, Russia would feel increasingly threatened and more inclined to speed up their effort to produce an atomic bomb of their own. With the help of U.S. Supreme Court justice Felix Frankfurter, Bohr met with the President of the United States, Franklin D. Roosevelt, who was initially sympathetic to his ideas about controlling nuclear weapons on 26 August 1944; but Churchill was adamantly opposed to informing the Soviet Union of such work. At the Second Quebec Conference in September 1944, Roosevelt sided with Churchill, deciding {{that it would be}} upon the nation's <b>best</b> <b>interest</b> <b>to</b> keep the atomic bomb project a secret. Moreover, they decided Bohr was potentially dangerous and specific security measures must be made in order to prevent him from leaking information {{to the rest of the}} world, Russia in particular.|$|E

25|$|On January 11, 1943, the Cabinet Committee on Japanese Problems {{recommend}} {{the sale of}} urban and rural Japanese-Canadian properties, arguing {{that it would be}} safeguarding the property and in the Japanese-Canadian owners’ <b>best</b> <b>interest</b> <b>to</b> sell because the value of their properties would go down.|$|E
25|$|The Virginia and Texas SBC Executive Committees {{receive and}} {{distribute}} funds from two conventions—one the traditional/original convention (BGAV and BGCT) and one new {{one that is}} only SBC (SBCVA and SBCTX).

25|$|Similarly, though Marx and Engels criticized Irish unrest for delaying a worker's {{revolution}} in England, both Marx and Engels believed that Ireland was oppressed by Great Britain but {{believed that the}} Irish people would better serve their own interests by joining proponents of class struggle in Europe, as Marx and Engels claimed that the socialist workers of Europe were the natural allies of Ireland. Also, Marx and Engels {{believed that it was}} in Britain's <b>best</b> <b>interest</b> <b>to</b> let Ireland go, as the Ireland issue was being used by elites to unite the British working class with the elites against the Irish.|$|E

25|$|When {{queen cell}} {{construction}} begins in late August to early September, {{it is in}} the male’s <b>best</b> <b>interest</b> <b>to</b> mate with a queen and produce a gyne. Similar wasp species illustrate workers that help their own kin or harm nonrelatives from growing as a gyne. Thus, reproductive competition occurs so that the genes of specific subfamilies can be passed on and survive. However, no evidence of reproductive competition exists within V. maculifrons colonies. Although a second male may occasionally attempt to grasp a queen immediately after copulation with another male, postcopulatory sperm competition is not common. In addition, reproductive skew among males is low.|$|E
25|$|Brunswick sent 5,723 {{troops to}} North America, of whom 3,015 {{did not return}} home {{in the autumn of}} 1783. Some losses were to death or desertion, but many Brunswickers became {{familiar}} with America during their time with the Convention Army, and when the war ended, they were granted permission to stay by both Congress and their officers. Many had taken the opportunity to desert as the Convention Army was twice marched through Pennsylvania German settlements in eastern Pennsylvania. As the Duke of Brunswick received compensation from the British for every one of his soldiers killed in America, it was in his <b>best</b> <b>interest</b> <b>to</b> report the deserters as dead, whenever possible. The Duke even offered six months' pay to soldiers who remained or returned to America.|$|E
25|$|With the {{enactment}} of the 1991 Local Government Code, municipalities and cities have both become more empowered to deal with local issues. Regular municipalities now share many of the same powers and responsibilities as chartered cities, but its citizens and/or leaders may feel that it might be to their <b>best</b> <b>interest</b> <b>to</b> get a larger share of internal revenue allotment (IRA) and acquire additional powers by becoming a city, especially if the population has greatly increased and local economy has become more robust. On the other hand, due to the higher property taxes that would be imposed after cityhood, many citizens have become wary of their town's conversion into a city, even if the municipality had already achieved a high degree of urbanization and has an annual income that already exceeds that of many existing lower-income cities. This has been among the cases made against the cityhood bids of many high-income and populous municipalities surrounding Metro Manila, most notably Bacoor and Dasmariñas (which finally became cities in June 2012 and November 2009 respectively), which for many years have been more qualified to become cities than others.|$|E

50|$|Consider an {{employer}} attempting {{to choose between}} two candidates offering to complete a task {{at the cost of}} $10/hour. The length of time needed to complete the task may be longer or shorter depending on the skill of the person performing the task, so it is in the employer's <b>best</b> <b>interests</b> <b>to</b> find the fastest worker possible. Assume that the cost of another day of interviewing the candidates is $100. If the employer had deduced from the interviews so far that both candidates would complete the task in somewhere between 195 and 205 hours, {{it would be in the}} employer's <b>best</b> <b>interests</b> <b>to</b> choose one or the other by some easily applied metric (for example, flipping a coin) rather than spend the $100 on determining the better candidate, saving at most $100 in labor.|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to ecological considerations, decisions regarding {{the future of}} the fisheries were also influenced by social and economic factors. Throughout Atlantic Canada, however most pronounced in Newfoundland, the cod fishery was a source of social and cultural identity. For many families, it also represented their livelihood: most families were connected either directly or indirectly with the fishery as fishers, fish plant workers, fish sellers, fish transporters, or as employees in related businesses. Additionally, many companies, both foreign and domestic, as well as individuals, had invested heavily in the boats, equipment and the infrastructure of the fishery, and therefore felt it was in their <b>best</b> <b>interest</b> <b>to</b> maintain an open-access policy to the ocean and its resources. What this alludes to is the unfortunate paradox that often accompanies open-access resources and is known by most as the Tragedy of the Commons: what is in the individual's best interest is not always {{in the best interest of}} a society at whole. In the case of Newfoundland and the Northern Cod fishery this meant that from the perspective of the individual participating in the fishing industry, maximizing their catch was in their best interest; however when the government failed to intervene – due largely to the highly sensitive nature of the political discourse created by the expansive group of stakeholders – the ecosystem was brought past its threshold and collapsed, leaving everyone worse-off.|$|E
500|$|There was {{no known}} {{alternative}} fuel for nuclear reactors other than uranium, so securing an adequate supply {{was crucial to}} the British atomic energy programme. [...] During the war, Britain {{took the lead in}} reopening the world's richest uranium mine, the Shinkolobwe mine in the Belgian Congo, which had been flooded and closed, as 30 percent of the stock in Union Minière du Haut Katanga, the company that owned the mine, was controlled by British interests. In May 1944, Sir John Anderson and US Ambassador John Winant negotiated a deal with the Belgian government in exile and Edgar Sengier, the director of Union Minière, for the mine to be reopened and [...] of ore to be purchased at $1.45 a pound. American and British leaders concluded that it was in their <b>best</b> <b>interest</b> <b>to</b> gain control of as much of the world's uranium deposits as possible. The Combined Development Trust was established for this purpose on 14 June 1944. It consisted of three American, two British and one Canadian members, with an American, initially Groves, as chairman. By the end of the war, it had control of 97 per cent of the world's uranium and 65 per cent of the thorium.|$|E

2500|$|It is {{possible}} to regulate diabetes without any diet change. If the animal will not eat a prescribed diet, {{it is not in}} the dog's <b>best</b> <b>interest</b> <b>to</b> insist on it; the amount of additional insulin required because a non-prescription diet is being fed is generally between 24%.

Since dogs with diabetes are prone to pancreatitis and hyperlipidemia, feeding a low-fat food may help limit or avoid these complications. [...] A non-prescription food with a [...] "fixed formula" [...] would be suitable because of the consistency of its preparation.
