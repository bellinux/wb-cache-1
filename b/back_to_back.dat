5|$|In 1830 {{the cost}} of {{building}} a small <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>back</b> house in Leeds was between seventy and eighty pounds. The average weekly rent was between two and four shillings, which was about a fifth of the average wages at the time.|$|E

5000|$|After a bitterly fought {{municipal}} election in 1865 (in which {{the chairman of}} the Building and Improvement Committee lost his seat) Bradford Council introduced a revised building bylaw in 1866. This again allowed building of <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>backs</b> but imposed very stringent standards for space, ventilation sanitation and paving. The typical houses built under this bylaw were [...] "tunnel <b>back</b> <b>to</b> backs". They had 2 or 3 bedrooms and usually a [...] "side scullery". The undeveloped plots were rapidly filled up. In 1870 a third Building Bylaw set minimum street widths. After 1870 no more planning applications for <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>backs</b> were approved but the Bradford builders had such a stock of approvals that <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>backs</b> were still being build into the 1890s. In the early 1870s a triangle of land between Rouse Fold, Prospect Foundry and the Bowling curves railway was filled by two new streets - Prospect Street and Oliver Street - lined with houses of this type. The 125 houses were the last significant example of Victorian house building in Broomfields. About 1,500 working class houses and 65 cellar dwellings had been built in 25 years - but there was little space for further expansion.|$|R

5|$|After winning <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>back</b> Presidents' Trophies {{in prior}} seasons the Canucks were {{projected}} as Stanley Cup contenders.

5|$|Hunslet Grange Flats (more {{commonly}} known as the Leek Street Flats) displayed brutalism. They replaced run down <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>back</b> houses. It is unusual that Leek Street was chosen as their informal name as they replaced many other streets, including longer streets such as Alton Street. The flats were popular at first; however, they were so poorly designed and constructed that in 1983 they were demolished only thirteen years after being constructed. Smaller shops on the site had been demolished even earlier.|$|E

In 2015, Niconico's Japanese channel ran a marathon broadcast of all twelve episodes starting from June 28.

5|$|For {{financial}} and scripting reasons the last book {{was divided into}} two films, shot <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>back,</b> which drew criticism from the series' fanbase. Radcliffe defended the split, stating {{that it would have}} been impossible to properly adapt the final novel into a single film. He added that the last movie was going to be extremely fast-paced with a lot of action, while the first part would be far more sedate, focusing on character development; he added that, had they combined them, those things would not have made it to the final cut. Filming lasted for a year, concluding in June 2010 and on the last day of shooting, like most of the cast and crew, Radcliffe openly wept.|$|E
5|$|Leeds' {{growth in}} the 19th century led to mass {{migration}} to the city; this resulted {{in many areas of}} the city becoming overcrowded and many new houses being built. The industrial revolution led to the increase in both working and middle classes, leading to the building of many new houses, aimed at both classes. The most common form of housing to be built for the working classes was the 'back to back'. <b>Back</b> <b>to</b> <b>back</b> terrace houses were built in the largely working class districts of Harehills, Holbeck, Hunslet, Beeston and Armley, whilst larger through terrace houses were built for the middle classes in Headingley and Kirkstall. Chapeltown developed as an affluent district of Leeds, and boasts many large Victorian villas, however the popularity of outer suburbs such as Roundhay towards the late 20th century brought land values down in Chapeltown and the area fell into decline.|$|E
5|$|Mengele's {{experiments}} with eyes included attempts to change eye color by injecting chemicals {{into the eyes}} of living subjects and killing people with heterochromatic eyes so that the eyes could be removed and sent to Berlin for study. His experiments on dwarfs and people with physical abnormalities included taking physical measurements, drawing blood, extracting healthy teeth, and treatment with unnecessary drugs and X-rays. Many of the victims were sent to the gas chambers after about two weeks, and their skeletons were sent to Berlin for further study. Mengele sought out pregnant women, on whom he would perform experiments before sending them to the gas chambers. Witness Vera Alexander described how he sewed two Romani twins together <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>back</b> in an attempt to create conjoined twins. The children died of gangrene after several days of suffering.|$|E
