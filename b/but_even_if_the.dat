25|$|The long {{record of}} {{friendly}} relations between Rome and the regnum was broken in 16 BC, when the Norici invaded the Istrian peninsula, by then Roman territory. The {{reasons for this}} foray are unclear. The Norici may have been alarmed by, and/or taking advantage of, the imminent Roman operations against their Raetian neighbours. They were driven out of Istria by the proconsul of Illyricum, Publius Silius Nerva, to whom they submitted. Lack of inscription evidence for the Roman province of Noricum before Claudius has led to dispute about when Noricum was annexed. Some scholars hold that annexation immediately followed the Roman occupation in 16 BC. Others suggest that the regnum Noricum was allowed to remain in existence for c. 60 years as a Roman client-state, as was the Odrysian kingdom of Thrace, until both were annexed under Claudius. <b>But</b> <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> latter is true, there is a consensus that Roman troops were stationed in the regnum from 16 BC. After its organisation as a province, it was governed by an equestrian procurator.|$|E

25|$|In the USA, corneal transplants (also {{known as}} corneal grafts) for {{keratoconus}} are usually performed under sedation as outpatient surgery. In other countries, such as Australia and the UK, {{the operation is}} commonly performed with the person undergoing a general anaesthetic. All cases require a careful follow-up with an eye doctor (ophthalmologist or optometrist) {{for a number of}} years. Frequently, vision is greatly improved after the surgery, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> actual visual acuity does not improve, because the cornea is a more normal shape after the healing is completed, people can more easily be fitted with corrective lenses. Complications of corneal transplants are mostly related to vascularization of the corneal tissue and rejection of the donor cornea. Vision loss is very rare, though difficult-to-correct vision is possible. When rejection is severe, repeat transplants are often attempted, and are frequently successful. Keratoconus will not normally reoccur in the transplanted cornea; incidences of this have been observed, but are usually attributed to incomplete excision of the original cornea or inadequate screening of the donor tissue. The long-term outlook for corneal transplants performed for keratoconus is usually favorable once the initial healing period is completed and a few years have elapsed without problems.|$|E

2500|$|Mars – the Martian {{atmosphere}} contains 10 nmol/mol methane. The {{source of}} methane on Mars {{has not been}} determined. Recent research suggests that methane may come from volcanoes, fault lines, or methanogens, {{that it may be}} a byproduct of electrical discharges from dust devils and dust storms, or that it {{may be the result of}} UV radiation. In January 2009, NASA scientists announced that they had discovered that the planet often vents methane into the atmosphere in specific areas, leading some to speculate this may be a sign of biological activity below the surface. Studies of a Weather Research and Forecasting model for Mars (MarsWRF) and related Mars general circulation model (MGCM) suggests that methane plume sources may be located within tens of kilometers, which is within the roving capabilities of future Mars rovers. The Curiosity rover, which landed on Mars in August 2012, can distinguish between different isotopologues of methane; <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> mission determines that microscopic Martian life is the source of the methane, it probably resides far below the surface, beyond the rover's reach.
