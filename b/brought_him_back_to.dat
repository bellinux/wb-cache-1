5|$|The history text Zubdat-al Tawarikh, {{dedicated}} to Sultan Murad III in 1583, narrates {{a story of}} Uzair's grief {{for the destruction of}} Jerusalem. His grief {{is said to have been}} so great that God took his soul and <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> life after Jerusalem was reconstructed. In the miniature accompanying the manuscript, the building on the lower right depicts the rebuilt city of Jerusalem in the form a typical sixteenth-century Ottoman building with a dome and an arched portico. The former ruins of Jerusalem are alluded to by the broken arches and columns on the left.|$|E
5|$|To {{regain his}} strength, Edwards {{and his wife}} took a {{carriage}} to a rustic cottage refuge in Arkville in the Catskill Mountains but isolation, plain food and rest yielded little improvement. A physician was called and he informed Mrs. Edwards {{that there would be}} no recovery for her husband from the advanced Bright's disease with complications from chronic pneumonia so she <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> New York City. Edwards died at home at 185 East 116th Street in East Harlem late on June 9, 1891, just hours after returning.|$|E

5|$|On 9 June, Pembroke left Gaveston at {{the rectory}} at Deddington in Oxfordshire, while he himself left {{to visit his}} wife. When Warwick found out about Gaveston's whereabouts, he {{immediately}} rode out to capture him. The next morning he appeared at the rectory, where he took Gaveston captive and <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> his castle at Warwick. Pembroke, whose honour had been affronted, appealed for justice both to Gaveston's brother-in-law Gloucester and to the University of Oxford, but to no avail. At Warwick, Gaveston was condemned to death for violating {{the terms of the}} Ordinances, before an assembly of barons, including Warwick, Lancaster, Hereford and Arundel. On 19 June, he was taken out on the road towards Kenilworth as far as Blacklow Hill, which was on the Earl of Lancaster's land. Here, two Welshmen ran him through with a sword and beheaded him.|$|E
5|$|Sitti Nurbaya: Kasih Tak Sampai (Sitti Nurbaya: Unrealized Love, often {{abbreviated}} Sitti Nurbaya or Siti Nurbaya; original spelling Sitti Noerbaja) is an Indonesian {{novel by}} Marah Rusli. It {{was published by}} Balai Pustaka, the state-owned publisher and literary bureau of the Dutch East Indies, in 1922. The author {{was influenced by the}} cultures of the west Sumatran Minangkabau and the Dutch colonials, who had controlled Indonesia in various forms since the 17th century. Another influence may have been a negative experience within the author's family; after he had chosen a Sundanese woman to be his wife, Rusli's family <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Padang and forced him to marry a Minangkabau woman chosen for him.|$|E
5|$|When the New Zealand Corps was {{established}} for the Battle of Monte Cassino in March 1944, Thornton was made General Staff Officer of the 2nd New Zealand Division.

Shortly after the war ended in Europe, he was promoted to brigadier, the youngest in the 2NZEF at the time, and appointed commander of the divisional artillery. For his services in the war, he was appointed as an Officer of the Order of the British Empire and had also twice been mentioned in despatches.|$|E

60|$|Well, {{this tragic}} {{incident}} had its sequel. It seems--to his honour, be it said--that Saduko {{refused to be}} the executioner of his father-in-law, Umbezi; so those with him performed this office and <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> <b>back</b> a prisoner <b>to</b> Cetewayo.|$|R
60|$|The {{snow was}} {{pushed away from}} before Tom's face, his left arm was cleared, and then his uncle with a {{vigorous}} pull <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> <b>back</b> close <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> Here he was comparatively free, for {{a part of the}} roof had fallen close to the wall and had partially kept off the snow. Then Harry turned, and with some difficulty managed to get Jerry, who was next to him, freed from the snow.|$|R
50|$|It {{was also}} {{during his time}} in France that Solano Lopez met a Parisian courtesan, the Irish-born Eliza Lynch, and <b>brought</b> her with <b>him</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Paraguay. There she was his {{concubine}} and de facto first lady till his death.|$|R

It's doubtless she, however, who, as you yourself have hinted, feels it most." ...|$|R

25|$|With {{the series}} already lost, England brought David Sheppard in to replace Parkhouse {{for the fourth}} Test, and a {{combination}} of limited opportunity and unimpressive scores meant {{that he did not}} reclaim a Test place until, on the New Zealand leg of the tour, an injury crisis <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the side for the second of the two-match series.

Lineker spent three years at Barcelona, until Venables <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> England with his new club Tottenham Hotspur in 1989.
