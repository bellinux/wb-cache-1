25|$|Most {{chemotherapy}} {{is delivered}} intravenously, although {{a number of}} agents can be administered orally (e.g., melphalan, <b>busulfan,</b> capecitabine).|$|E
25|$|Oncologists {{are already}} individualizing dosing of some cancer drugs based on exposure. Carboplatin and <b>busulfan</b> dosing rely upon results from blood tests to {{calculate}} the optimal dose for each patient. Simple blood tests are also available for dose optimization of methotrexate, 5-FU, paclitaxel, and docetaxel.|$|E
25|$|Some {{types of}} {{chemotherapy}} are gonadotoxic and may cause infertility. Chemotherapies with high risk include procarbazine and other alkylating {{drugs such as}} cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, <b>busulfan,</b> melphalan, chlorambucil, and chlormethine. Drugs with medium risk include doxorubicin and platinum analogs such as cisplatin and carboplatin. On the other hand, therapies with low risk of gonadotoxicity include plant derivatives such as vincristine and vinblastine, antibiotics such as bleomycin and dactinomycin, and antimetabolites such as methotrexate, mercaptopurine, and 5-fluorouracil.|$|E
25|$|The subtypes of alkylating {{agents are}} the {{nitrogen}} mustards, nitrosoureas, tetrazines, aziridines, cisplatins and derivatives, and non-classical alkylating agents. Nitrogen mustards include mechlorethamine, cyclophosphamide, melphalan, chlorambucil, ifosfamide and <b>busulfan.</b> Nitrosoureas include N-Nitroso-N-methylurea (MNU), carmustine (BCNU), lomustine (CCNU) and semustine (MeCCNU), fotemustine and streptozotocin. Tetrazines include dacarbazine, mitozolomide and temozolomide. Aziridines include thiotepa, mytomycin and diaziquone (AZQ). Cisplatin and derivatives include cisplatin, carboplatin and oxaliplatin. They impair cell function by forming covalent bonds with the amino, carboxyl, sulfhydryl, and phosphate groups in biologically important molecules. Non-classical alkylating agents include procarbazine and hexamethylmelamine.|$|E
25|$|MDS {{most often}} {{develops}} without an identifiable cause. Risk factors include exposure to an agent {{known to cause}} DNA damage, like radiation, benzene, and certain chemotherapies; other risk factors have been inconsistently reported. It {{can be difficult to}} prove a connection between a suspected exposure and the development of MDS, but the presence of genetic abnormalities may provide some supportive information. Secondary MDS can occur as a late toxicity of cancer therapy (therapy associated MDS, t-MDS). MDS after exposure to radiation or Alkylating agents such as <b>busulfan,</b> nitrosourea, or procarbazine, typically occurs 3-7 years after exposure and frequently demonstrates loss of chromosome 5 or 7. MDS after exposure to DNA topoisomerase II inhibitors occurs after a shorter latency of only 1-3 years and can have a 11q23 translocation. Other pre-existing bone marrow disorders like acquired aplastic anemia following immunosuppressive treatment and Fanconi's anemia can evolve into MDS.|$|E
2500|$|Some cancer {{treatments}} like bexarotene, <b>busulfan,</b> chlorambucil, estramustine, etoposide, flutamide, idarubicin, ifosfamide, irinotecan, ixabepilone, letrozole, lomustine, megestrol, mitomycin, mitoxantrone, paclitaxel, procarbazine, tamoxifen, topotecan ...|$|E
2500|$|Some {{people have}} a history of {{exposure}} to chemotherapy (especially alkylating agents such as melphalan, cyclophosphamide, <b>busulfan,</b> and chlorambucil) or radiation (therapeutic or accidental), or both (e.g., at the time of stem cell transplantation for another disease). Workers in some industries with heavy exposure to hydrocarbons such as the petroleum industry have a slightly higher risk of contracting the disease than the general population. Xylene and benzene exposure has been associated with myelodysplasia. Vietnam veterans exposed to Agent Orange are at risk of developing MDS. A link may exist between the development of MDS [...] "in atomic-bomb survivors 40 to 60 years after radiation exposure" [...] (in this case, referring to people who were in close proximity to the dropping of the atomic bomb in Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II).|$|E
50|$|<b>Busulfan</b> is metabolized via {{glutathione}} conjugation in {{the liver}} to inactive metabolites. Itraconazole can decrease <b>busulfan</b> clearance by up to 25%, resulting in AUC levels >1500 micromolxmin and increased risk of hepatic VOD. Concomitant use of acetaminophen within 72 hours of <b>busulfan</b> use can reduce <b>busulfan</b> clearance (resulting in increased <b>busulfan</b> AUC), as acetaminophen is also metabolized via glutathione and may deplete stores. Phenytoin increases hepatic clearance of <b>busulfan</b> (resulting in decreased <b>busulfan</b> AUC). However, clinical studies of <b>busulfan</b> were completed with patients taking phenytoin, so no empiric dose adjustment is necessary if patients are taking phenytoin with <b>busulfan.</b>|$|E
50|$|Myleran is {{supplied}} in white {{film coated tablets}} with 2 mg of <b>busulfan</b> per tablet. After 2002, a great interest has appeared for intravenous presentations of <b>busulfan.</b> Busulfex {{is supplied}} as an intravenous solution with 6 mg/ml <b>busulfan.</b> Busulfex has proved equally effective as oral <b>busulfan,</b> with presumedly less toxic side effects. Pharmacokinetic and dynamic studies support this use, that has prompted its usage in transplantation regimes, particularly in frail patients. Fludarabine + <b>busulfan</b> is a typical example of this use.|$|E
50|$|As {{an adjunct}} therapy with {{cyclophosphamide}} for conditioning prior to {{bone marrow transplantation}} in adults and children >12 kg, intravenous (IV) <b>busulfan</b> (Bulsulfex) is dosed at 0.8 mg/kg every six hours for 16 doses (four days). IV <b>busulfan</b> is usually administered over two hours. Both IV and oral formulations require prophylactic antiemetic agents administered prior to the <b>busulfan</b> dose and scheduled antiemetics administered thereafter. Taking <b>busulfan</b> {{on an empty stomach}} is recommended {{to reduce the risk of}} nausea and emesis.|$|E
50|$|The {{molecular}} recognition of ureido-cyclodextrin with <b>busulfan</b> was investigated. The formation of complexes was observed with electrostatic interactions between urea and the sulfonate part of <b>busulfan.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Busulfan</b> {{is used in}} {{pediatrics}} {{and adults}} in combination with cyclophosphamide or fludarabine/clofarabine as a conditioning agent prior to bone marrow transplantation, especially in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and other leukemias, lymphomas, and myeloproliferative disorders. <b>Busulfan</b> can control tumor burden but cannot prevent transformation or correct cytogenic abnormalities.|$|E
50|$|Antiemetics {{are often}} {{administered}} prior to <b>busulfan</b> to prevent emesis.|$|E
50|$|<b>Busulfan</b> {{is listed}} by the IARC as a Group 1 carcinogen.|$|E
5000|$|Certain medications, e.g. amiodarone, {{bleomycin}} (pingyangmycin), <b>busulfan,</b> methotrexate, apomorphine, and nitrofurantoin ...|$|E
50|$|Toxicity {{may include}} {{interstitial}} pulmonary fibrosis ("busulfan lung"), hyperpigmentation, seizures, hepatic (veno-occlusive disease) (VOD), emesis, and wasting syndrome. <b>Busulfan</b> also induces thrombocytopenia, {{a condition of}} lowered blood platelet count and activity. Seizures and VOD are serious concerns with <b>busulfan</b> therapy and prophylaxis is often utilized to avoid these effects. Hepatic VOD is a dose-limiting toxicity.|$|E
50|$|<b>Busulfan</b> was {{approved}} by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in 1999. <b>Busulfan</b> was the mainstay of the chemotherapeutic treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) until it was displaced by the new gold standard, imatinib, though it is still in use to a degree {{as a result of the}} drug's relative low cost.|$|E
50|$|<b>Busulfan</b> (Myleran, GlaxoSmithKline, Busulfex IV, Otsuka America Pharmaceutical, Inc.) is {{a cancer}} drug, in use since 1959.|$|E
50|$|Dimethylacetamide is {{also used}} as an {{excipient}} in drugs, e.g. in Vumon (teniposide), Busulfex (<b>busulfan)</b> or Amsidine (amsacrine).|$|E
50|$|Most {{chemotherapy}} {{is delivered}} intravenously, although {{a number of}} agents can be administered orally (e.g., melphalan, <b>busulfan,</b> capecitabine).|$|E
50|$|<b>Busulfan</b> is a {{cell cycle}} {{non-specific}} alkylating antineoplastic agent, {{in the class}} of alkyl sulfonates. Its chemical designation is 1,4-butanediol dimethanesulfonate.|$|E
50|$|Chemotherapy-induced {{hyperpigmentation}} {{is caused}} by many chemotherapeutic agents (especially the antibiotics bleomycin, and daunorubicin) and the alkylating agents (cyclophosphamide and <b>busulfan).</b>|$|E
50|$|Similarly, Aspen's <b>busulfan,</b> a {{treatment}} for chronic myeloid leukaemia, was bought by the UK's NHS for 21p for 2mg in 2011, rising to Â£2.61 in 2016, a hike of 1,143%.|$|E
50|$|Alkyl sulfonates are esters of alkane {{sulfonic}} acids {{with the}} general formula R-SO2-O-R'. They act as alkylating agents, {{some of them are}} used as alkylating antineoplastic agents in the treatment of cancer, e.g. <b>Busulfan.</b>|$|E
50|$|Pulmonary complications:Approximately 20% of {{individuals}} with DKC develop pulmonary complications, including pulmonary fibrosis and abnormalities of pulmonary vasculature.The recommendation is that DKC patients avoid taking drugs with pulmonary toxicity (e.g., <b>busulfan)</b> {{and that they have}} their lungs shielded from radiation during BMT.|$|E
50|$|Oncologists {{are already}} individualizing dosing of some cancer drugs based on exposure. Carboplatin and <b>busulfan</b> dosing rely upon results from blood tests to {{calculate}} the optimal dose for each patient. Simple blood tests are also available for dose optimization of methotrexate, 5-FU, paclitaxel, and docetaxel.|$|E
50|$|Treosulfan is a {{substance}} that is being studied {{in the treatment of}} cancer. It belongs to the family of drugs called alkylating agents. It has been used mainly as a substitute of <b>busulfan</b> in frail patients, as the side effects and toxicity are supposedly less severe.|$|E
5000|$|Conditioning regimen: The COG JMML study {{involves}} 8 {{rounds of}} total-body irradiation (TBI) and doses of cyclophosphamide {{to prepare the}} JMML childâs body for bone marrow transplant. Use of TBI is controversial, though, because {{of the possibility of}} late side-effects such as slower growth, sterility, learning disabilities, and secondary cancers, and the fact that radiation can have devastating effects on very young children. It is used in this study, however, due to the concern that chemotherapy alone might not be enough to kill dormant JMML cells. The EWOG-MDS JMML Study includes <b>busulfan</b> in place of TBI due to its own research findings that appeared to show that <b>busulfan</b> was more effective against leukemia in JMML than TBI. The EWOG-MDS study also involves cyclophosphamide and melphalan in its conditioning regimen.|$|E
50|$|The {{emergency}} {{treatment of}} polycythemia (e.g., in hyperviscosity or thrombosis) is by phlebotomy (removal of {{blood from the}} circulation). Depending on the underlying cause, phlebotomy may also be used {{on a regular basis}} to reduce the hematocrit. Cytostatics such as <b>busulfan</b> and hydroxyurea are sometimes used for long-term management of polycythemia.|$|E
50|$|Prior to extraction, {{the patient}} is treated with {{granulocyte}} colony-stimulating factor {{in order to increase}} the number of stem cells and improve the harvest; after that but prior to reinfusion, {{the patient is}} treated with <b>busulfan</b> or melphalan to kill as many of the person's existing HSCs to increase the chances of the new cells' survival.|$|E
50|$|PAX7 {{may also}} {{function}} in the recovery in spermatogenesis. Unlike other spermatogonia, PAX7+ spermatogonia are resistant to radiation and chemotherapy. The surviving PAX7+ spermatogonia are able to increase in number following these therapies and differentiate into the other forms of spermatogonia that did not survive. Additionally, mice lacking PAX7 had delayed recovery of spermatogenesis following exposure to <b>busulfan</b> when compared to control mice.|$|E
50|$|Before the 2001 U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) {{approval}} of imatinib, no drugs {{were available to}} alter the natural progression of CML. Only cytotoxic drugs such as <b>busulfan,</b> hydroxyurea or interferon-alpha (rIFN-Î±) were utilized. Even though the first Bcr-Abl TK inhibitor was named âthe magic bulletâ to cure cancer by TIME magazine, a second generation of Bcr-Abl TKI was subsequently developed to combat the initial resistance that emerged.|$|E
50|$|<b>Busulfan</b> is an alkylsulfonate. It is an {{alkylating agent}} that forms DNA-DNA intrastrand {{crosslinks}} between the DNA bases guanine and adenine and between guanine and guanine. This occurs through an SN2 reaction {{in which the}} relatively nucleophilic guanine N7 attacks the carbon adjacent to the mesylate leaving group. DNA crosslinking prevents DNA replication. Because the intrastrand DNA crosslinks cannot be repaired by cellular machinery, the cell undergoes apoptosis.|$|E
50|$|Chemotherapy poses a {{high risk}} of {{infertility}}. Chemotherapies with high risk of infertility include procarbazine and other alkylating drugs such as cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, <b>busulfan,</b> melphalan, chlorambucil and chlormethine. Drugs with medium risk include doxorubicin and platinum analogs such as cisplatin and carboplatin. On the other hand, therapies with low risk of gonadotoxicity include plant derivatives such as vincristine and vinblastine, antibiotics such as bleomycin and dactinomycin and antimetabolites such as methotrexate, mercaptopurine and 5-fluorouracil.|$|E
50|$|<b>Busulfan</b> {{therapeutic}} drug monitoring is completed based on trough (pre-dose) levels with a target six-hour area under the curve (AUC) of between 900 and 1500 micromolxmin. AUCs (six-hour) >1500 micromolxmin {{are associated with}} hepatic VOD and subsequent dose reduction should be considered. AUCs (six-hour) <900 micromolxmin are associated with incomplete bone marrow ablation and subsequent dose escalation should be considered. Dose adjustments are performed using first order kinetics, such that the adjusted dose = current dose Ã (target AUC/actual AUC).|$|E
50|$|MDS may {{be caused}} by {{environmental}} exposures such as radiation and benzene; other risk factors have been inconsistently reported. However, definitive proof of specific causes cannot be determined. Secondary MDS occurs as a late toxicity of cancer treatment, usually with a combination of radiation and the radiomimetic alkylating agents such as <b>busulfan,</b> nitrosourea, or procarbazine (with a latent period of 5 to 7 years) or the DNA topoisomerase inhibitors (latency 2 years). Both acquired aplastic anemia following immunosuppressive treatment and Fanconi's anemia can evolve into MDS.|$|E
