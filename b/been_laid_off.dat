In January 2009, the Village Voice, which had regularly published Hentoff's commentary and criticism for fifty years, {{announced that he}} had <b>been</b> <b>laid</b> <b>off.</b> He then went on to write for publications such as United Features, Jewish World Review, and The Wall Street Journal. Hentoff joined the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, as a senior fellow in February 2009.|$|E
5|$|On 18 June 2009, {{fewer than}} 200 {{contractors}} {{walked out of}} or {{failed to show up}} in a wildcat strike, showing solidarity with workers at the Lindsey Oil Refinery in Lincolnshire where 51 workers had <b>been</b> <b>laid</b> <b>off</b> while another employer on the site was employing. A spokeswoman said the strike did not affect electricity output.|$|E
5|$|As {{the weather}} warmed and work resumed {{on the main}} pipeline, Alyeska administrators were distracted by a {{controversy}} about pipeline welds {{that had been done}} the previous year. In September 1975, a former employee of Ketchbaw Industries filed suit against the company, alleging that he had <b>been</b> <b>laid</b> <b>off</b> because he would not participate in a conspiracy to falsify quality control X-Rays of pipeline welds. The Trans-Alaska Pipeline was unique among pipeline projects to that point in that it required all welds of the main pipeline to be verified by X-Ray. This was a time-consuming process, and the quality-control procedures continually lagged behind the welders.|$|E
25|$|Between 2001 and 2015 {{the company}} was {{reported}} as having multiple rounds of layoffs. In 2001, 350 employees, or 24% of total workforce, <b>were</b> <b>laid</b> <b>off.</b> Then in January 2003, 176 employees <b>were</b> <b>laid</b> <b>off</b> and in June 2005, 89 employees <b>were</b> <b>laid</b> <b>off.</b> In August 2006, 30 to 40 employees <b>were</b> <b>laid</b> <b>off.</b> In 2007 two rounds of layoffs happened, first in March 2007, 175 employees <b>were</b> <b>laid</b> <b>off</b> and then in December 2007, 18 employees <b>were</b> <b>laid</b> <b>off.</b> In July 2015, roughly 200 employees <b>were</b> <b>laid</b> <b>off</b> {{as part of a}} restructuring measure.|$|R

5|$|Two {{other works}} were pivotal in framing {{the image of}} buyout firms. Barbarians at the Gate, the 1990 best seller about the fight over RJR Nabisco linked private equity to hostile takeovers and assaults on management. A {{blistering}} story {{on the front page}} of the Wall Street Journal the same year about KKR's buyout of the Safeway supermarket chain painted a much more damaging picture. The piece, which later won a Pulitzer Prize, began with the suicide of a Safeway worker in Texas who had <b>been</b> <b>laid</b> <b>off</b> and went on to chronicle how KKR had sold off hundreds of stores after the buyout and slashed jobs.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, {{during the}} {{contract}} {{negotiations between the}} city the Chicago Teachers Union (CTU), compromise {{could not be reached}} over issues like health insurance increases, teacher evaluations, and seniority pay increases. On August 8, 2012, the CTU voted 90% to authorize a strike. On September 10, the CTU began a strike after CTU President Lewis declared that negotiations with the city were not succeeding. On September 14, the CTU reached a tentative agreement with the city which included preferences for teachers who have <b>been</b> <b>laid</b> <b>off</b> due to a school closing to be hired in another school and student test scores having less of a role in teacher evaluations than the city had originally planned. This tentative agreement did not hold, and the strike continued, after which Emanuel announced his intention to seek a legal injunction, forcing teachers back to work. On September 17, Emanuel's efforts to end the strike stalled as the walkout went into the second week. Delegates from the CTU voted to end the strike on September 18, 2012, and students began their return to the schools the following day.|$|E

25|$|Following {{a failed}} 107-day cigar-makers' strike in 1877, Gompers {{assisted}} President Adolph Strasser in radically restructuring the Cigar Makers' International Union (CMIU) in 1879. Henceforth, the union would be run like a business. The international union {{would have the}} authority to take control of local affiliates. Dues would be raised to build financial reserves, and to pay sick and death benefits. A union bank would be established to provide short-term loans for workers who had <b>been</b> <b>laid</b> <b>off</b> and were seeking new jobs. The constitution of the union would be changed to permit the international to seize funds from locals with flush treasuries and transfer the money to locals in distress.|$|E

25|$|The freshly arrived Marines were {{assigned}} to provide land defense for Subic Bay. Seaward defenses included the batteries at Fort Wint on Grande Island and a minefield, which had <b>been</b> <b>laid</b> <b>off</b> the entrance to Subic Harbor. As the Marines built beach defenses, Consolidated PBY-4 Catalinas from VP-101 & VP-102 of Patrol Wing 10, which was stationed at Subic Bay, were conducting daily patrols off Luzon {{as a response to}} rumors that the Japanese were approaching the Philippines. On December 11, seven Catalinas had just returned from patrol when Japanese Zeroes appeared and strafed the aircraft. One ensign was killed and all Catalinas sank to the bottom of Subic Bay's inner basin.|$|E
25|$|The {{same day}} Meggs made his post, November 16, MumboJumbo closed their offices in Irvine, {{with a view}} to {{consolidate}} their resources in their Dallas headquarters. On November 19, MumboJumbo denied the Myth III team had <b>been</b> <b>laid</b> <b>off,</b> saying all staff members had been invited to work in the Dallas office. They also announced the patch Meggs had spoken of would be released within the week. On December 19, Mark Dochtermann promised the patch would be released before Christmas, along with Vengeance, stating they had delayed release of the patch for the PC version so as to coincide its release with the Mac version of the game. Although the Mac version was ultimately released in January 2002, the patch was never officially released by MumboJumbo for either version of the game.|$|E
25|$|Disney {{had once}} {{announced}} that 2004's Home on the Range {{would be their}} last traditionally animated film. After the company's acquisition of Pixar in early 2006, Ed Catmull and John Lasseter, the new president and chief creative officer of Disney Animation Studios, reversed this decision and reinstated hand-drawn animation at the studio. Many animators who had either <b>been</b> <b>laid</b> <b>off</b> or had left the studio when the traditional animation units were dissolved in 2003 were located and re-hired for the project. Lasseter also brought back directors Ron Clements and John Musker, whose earlier works include The Great Mouse Detective (1986), The Little Mermaid (1989), Aladdin (1992), Hercules (1997), and Treasure Planet (2002). The duo had left the company in 2005, but Lasseter requested their return to Disney to direct and write the film and had let them choose the style of animation (traditional or CGI) they wanted to use.|$|E

25|$|The {{head office}} was moved from Oslo to Kirkenes in 1982 and Ottar Brekke {{was hired as}} {{managing}} director from 18 February. He was replaced by Knut H. Hübert two years later. Faults with the exporting facilities caused the silos to fill in late 1982; by January 1983, 800 employees had <b>been</b> <b>laid</b> <b>off.</b> Work on removing gangue started at Bjørnefjell the following year, and mining of the ore there was completed within two years. In 1985 {{the majority of the}} board supported gangue removal at Østmalmen, but was met with a dissent of the minority. While the operations were necessary for long-term operations at the mine, it would require state subsidies. State Secretary Kjell Hansen was opposed to the proposal and on 30 April 1985 Parliament cut the subsidies, hindering additional gangue breaking. This caused Hübert to resign and he was replaced by Oddmund Husum. Parliament's decision caused a strike and all production was halted on 2 May. It was found illegal by the Industrial Disputes Court on 14 May, but continued until 5 June.|$|E
25|$|Maxis {{went public}} in 1995 with revenue of US$38 million. The stock reached $50 a share and then dropped as Maxis posted a loss. EA bought Maxis in June 1997. Wright had been {{thinking}} about making a virtual doll house ever since the early 1990s, similar to SimCity but focused on individual people; after losing his home during the Oakland firestorm of 1991, he was inspired to turn his experiences of rebuilding his life into a game. Sims would be based on Wright's focus on building homes, which came from inspiration he found first-hand. Wright, was even sure to include many fires in the game, which were extra difficult for the player to extinguish. Themes like carpentry, home construction, and bare ground in need of landscaping, are common throughout the game. Originally conceived of as an architectural design game called Home Tactics, Wright's idea changed when someone suggested the player should be rated on the quality of life experience by the homeowners. It was a difficult idea to sell to EA, because already 40% of Maxis's employees had <b>been</b> <b>laid</b> <b>off.</b>|$|E
500|$|Kevin Renick {{wrote the}} song [...] "Up in the Air" [...] two {{years prior to}} knowing that Reitman {{was working on a}} film {{adaptation}} to the book. He had <b>been</b> <b>laid</b> <b>off</b> at the time, and was an unrecorded, unemployed St. Louis musician. When Renick researched the film he discovered that the theme of the film was much the same as the song he had written. [...] "The song is about uncertainty, disconnection and loneliness, while alluding to career transition," [...] Renick explained. [...] "It's a melancholy song, and a narrative about finding out where your life's going to go." [...] He handed a cassette to Reitman after the director did an interview at Webster University. Renick included a spoken-word introduction about the song on the cassette so that Reitman would know why he was given the song. Reitman found a tape deck, listened, liked the song and placed the original introduction and song from the cassette midway through the credits. Reitman stated that the song has a do-it-yourself authenticity.|$|E

30|$|To empirically {{test the}} {{theoretical}} implications, {{a finding of}} Bewley (1999) that 57 % of non-union workers <b>are</b> <b>laid</b> <b>off</b> based on performance, while only 7 % of union workers <b>are</b> <b>laid</b> <b>off</b> based on performance, is utilized. This finding means that the model setting that assumes performance-based layoffs is more applicable to non-union workers.|$|R
