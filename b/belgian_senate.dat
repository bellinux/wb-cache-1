25|$|Leopold's public {{career began}} on his {{attaining}} {{the age of}} majority in 1855, {{when he became a}} member of the <b>Belgian</b> <b>Senate.</b> He took an active interest in the senate, especially in matters concerning the development of Belgium and its trade, and began to urge Belgium's acquisition of colonies. From 1854 to 1865, Leopold traveled extensively abroad, visiting India, China, Egypt, and the countries on the Mediterranean coast of Africa. Leopold's father died on December 10, 1865, and Leopold took the oath of office on December 17, in his thirtieth year.|$|E
25|$|The 1997 {{report of}} the <b>Belgian</b> <b>Senate</b> stated {{that there was not}} enough {{information}} to determine specifics about the assassination. A 1998 report by the National Assembly of France posited two probable explanations. One is that the attack was carried out by groups of Hutu extremists, distressed by the advancement of negotiations with the RPF, the political and military adversary of the current regime, while the other is that it was the responsibility of the RPF, frustrated at the lack of progress in the Arusha Accords. Among the other hypotheses that were examined is one that implicates the French military, although there is no clear motive for a French attack on the Rwandan government. The 1998 French report made no determination between the two dominant theories. A 2000 report by the Organisation of African Unity does not attempt to determine responsibility.|$|E
25|$|In Flemish circles, {{there is}} an ever {{continuing}} worry that the status of Dutch in Brussels will continue to deteriorate, and that the surrounding region will undergo even more Francization. On the political level, {{the division of the}} bilingual Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde (BHV) electoral and judicial district caused much linguistic strife. The district is composed of the 19 municipalities of the Brussels-Capital Region in addition to the 35 municipalities of the Flemish administrative arrondissement of Halle-Vilvoorde. For elections to the <b>Belgian</b> <b>Senate</b> and to the European Parliament, which are organized by linguistic region, residents from anywhere in the arrondissement can vote for French-speaking parties in Wallonia and Brussels. For elections to the Belgian Chamber of Representatives, which is usually done by province, voters from Halle-Vilvoorde can vote for parties in Brussels, and vice versa. It was feared that, if BHV was divided, the francophones living in Halle-Vilvoorde would {{no longer be able to}} vote for candidates in Brussels, and they would lose the right to judicial proceedings in French. If a division were to take place, francophone political parties would demand that the Brussels-Capital Region be expanded, a proposal that is unacceptable to Flemish parties. This issue was one of the chief reasons for the 200-day impasse in Belgian government formation in 2007, and it remained a hotly contested issue between the linguistic Communities, until this issue was resolved mid-2012.|$|E
500|$|In 2004, the <b>Belgian</b> <b>Senate</b> {{commissioned}} the Centre for Historical Research and Documentation on War and Contemporary Society (Cegesoma) {{to produce a}} definitive historical report on Belgian collaboration in the Holocaust. The report, entitled [...] "Docile Belgium" [...] (/), was published in 2007. It generated significant public interest in Belgium and abroad. The report's findings were controversial, as they emphasised {{the extent to which}} the Belgian police and authorities had collaborated in the deportation of Jews.|$|E

2500|$|Starting with April 7, Belgium {{demanded an}} {{extension}} from the UN of UNAMIR's mandate {{in order to}} evacuate the 1,520 Belgian residents. One can read from the report from the <b>Belgian</b> <b>Senate</b> {{the intentions of the}} Belgian ambassador from 12 April 1996: [...] "We are preoccupied above all with the personnel who have worked for us, of certain people associated with the process of democratization, with clergymen." [...] The report follows: [...] "Finally, operation 'Silver Back' began on April 10 and will be completed on April 15 when the last Belgian civilians will have left Rwanda." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "From 1831, {{the year}} of Belgium's independence, until the federalization {{of the country in}} 1970, Wallonia has {{increasingly}} asserted itself as a region in its own right." [...] Following several state reforms, especially the 1993 state reform, Belgium became a federal state made up of three communities and three regions, with Wallonia being represented by the Walloon Region and its two language communities. The directly elected Walloon Parliament was created in June 1995, replacing the Conseil régional wallon (Regional Council of Wallonia). The first Council had sat on 15 October 1980 and was composed of members of the Belgian Chamber of Representatives and the <b>Belgian</b> <b>Senate</b> elected in Wallonia.|$|E
2500|$|In Belgium {{the state}} {{has been accused of}} having {{actively}} collaborated with Nazi Germany. An official 2007 report commissioned by the <b>Belgian</b> <b>senate</b> concluded that the Belgians were indeed complicit for participating in the Holocaust. According to the report, the Belgian authorities [...] "adopted a docile attitude providing collaboration unworthy of a democracy in its treatment of Jews." [...] The report also identified three crucial moments that showed the attitude of Belgian authorities toward the Jews: (1) During the autumn of 1940 when they complied with the order of the German occupier to register all Jews even though it was contrary to the Belgium constitution; this led to a number of measures including the firing of all Jews from official positions in December 1940 and the expelling of all Jewish children from their schools in December 1941; (2) In summer 1942, when over one thousand Jews were deported to the death camps, particularly Auschwitz during the month of August. This was only the first of such actions as the deportations to the east continued resulting in the death of some 25,000 people; and (3) At the end of 1945, the Belgian state officials decided that its authorities bore no legal responsibility for the persecution of the Jews, even though many Belgian police officers participated in the rounding up and deportation of Jews.|$|E
6000|$|Another new {{factor in}} the {{situation}} was the completion, in 1898, of the Lower Congo Railway, which connects Boma with Stanley Pool, and so outflanks the cataracts. The enterprise itself was beneficent and splendid. The means by which it was carried out were unscrupulous and inhuman. Had civilization no complaint against the Congo State save the history of its railway construction with its forced labour, so different to {{the tradition of the}} tropical procedure of other European colonies, it would be a heavy indictment. Now it sinks to insignificance when compared with the enslavement of a whole people and the twenty years of uninterrupted massacre.
