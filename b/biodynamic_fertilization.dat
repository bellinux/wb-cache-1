40|$|Effects of {{nitrogen}} supply (high / low), fertilizer type (biodynamic / organic / mineral) {{and application of}} the biodynamic horn silica preparation on nitrate, ascorbic acid and glucosinolate contents of rocket (Eruca sativa L.) were studied under conditions of full sunlight (100 % photosynthetically active radiation PAR) and shading (55 % PAR). Nitrate contents increased in response to shading and under conditions of full sunlight also in response to high nitrogen supply and mineral fertilization. Ascorbic acid contents were significantly higher with low nitrogen supply, biodynamic and organic fertilization, horn silica application and under conditions of low nitrogen supply with full sunlight. Glucosinolate contents were significantly increased by low nitrogen supply, full sunlight (in combination with <b>biodynamic</b> <b>fertilization)</b> as well as biodynamic and organic fertilization (under conditions of full sunlight) ...|$|E
