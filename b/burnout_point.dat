In view of this, this paper mainly expounds on two issues: one is based on the approximate analytical solution to the motion equation for the vacuum flight section of a long-range rocket, deriving the analytical solutions to the partial derivatives of the state of <b>burnout</b> <b>point</b> with respect to the changing rate of the final-stage pitch program; the other is based on the initial positioning and orientation error propagation mechanism, proposing the analytical calculation formula for the partial derivatives of the state of <b>burnout</b> <b>point</b> with respect to the launch azimuth. The calculation results of correction data are simulated and verified under different circumstances. The simulation results are as follows: (1) the accuracy of approximation between the analytical solutions and the results attained via the difference method is higher than 90 %, and the ratio of calculation time between them is lower than 0. 2 %, thus demonstrating the accuracy of calculation of data corrections and advantages in calculation speed; (2) after the analytical solutions are compensated, the longitudinal landing deviation of the rocket is less than 20  m and the lateral landing deviation of the rocket is less than 10  m, demonstrating that the corrected data can meet the requirements for the hit accuracy of a long-range rocket...|$|E

40|$|An experiment, utilising a {{condensing}} fluid as {{the heat}} source, {{was performed to}} determine the heat flux vs. temperature difference curve for transition pool boiling from a horisontal surface. The boiling cure was determined {{as a function of}} surface roughness, material, and cleanliness for n-pentane at atmospheric pressure. The results of the experiment show that the liquid contacts the solid heating surface in transition boiling. The burnout heat flux and the film boiling curve are independent of surface properties. For commercial heating surfaces, and probably provided that the combination of surface energies which exist do not result in spreading of the liquid on the solid heating surface, the location of the minimum point is independent of surface properties. It is concluded that transition boiling is a combination of unstable nucleate and unstable film boiling alternating at a given location on the heating surface. The heat transfer data in the transition region was found to be correlated by a straight line on log-log graph paper which connects the <b>burnout</b> <b>point</b> and the minimum point. The bubble spacing and growth rates in film pool boiling from a horizontal surface are shown to be determined by Taylor Hydrodynamic Instability for temperature differences near the minimum. An analytical expression for the heat transfer coefficient in film pool boiling from a horizontal surface is derived.

The model {{provides a more}} precise fluid-mechanical description of the flame by incorporating an elliptic treatment of the upstream flame stabilization zone near the fuel <b>burnout</b> <b>point.</b> Parabolic equations are used to treat the downstream flame, which has a higher flow Reynolds number. The parabolic and elliptic regions are coupled smoothly by an appropriate matching of boundary conditions. The solid phase consists of an energy equation with surface radiative loss and a surface pyrolysis relation. Steady spread with constant flame and pyrolysis lengths is found possible for thin fuels and this facilitates {{the adoption of a}} moving coordinate system attached to the flame with the flame spread rate being an eigen value. Calculations are performed in purely forced flow in a range of velocities which are lower than those induced in a normal gravity buoyant environment. Both quenching and blowoff extinction are observed. The results show that as flow velocity or oxygen percentage is reduced, the flame spread rate, the pyrolysis length, and the flame length all decrease, as expected. The flame standoff distance from the solid and the reaction zone thickness, however, first increase with decreasing flow velocity, but eventually decrease very near the quenching extinction limit. The short, diffuse flames observed at low flow velocities and oxygen levels are consistent with available experimental data. The maximum flame temperature decreases slowly at first as flow velocity is reduced, then falls more steeply close to the quenching extinction limit. Low velocity quenching occurs as a result of heat loss. At low velocities, surface radiative loss becomes a significant fraction of the total combustion heat release. In addition, the shorter flame length causes an increase in the fraction of conduction downstream compared to conduction to the fuel. These heat losses lead to lower flame temperatures, and ultimately, extinction. This extinction mechanism differs from that of blowoff, where the flame is unable to be stabilized due to the high flow velocity...|$|E

40|$|Perfectionism is a {{prevalent}} personality disposition {{that may}} affect all domains of life. Work is an important domain of life for many people. Yet, research on perfectionism at work and how perfectionism affects employees’ health and well-being is still limited. Research, however, has investigated perfectionism’s relationships with three key aspects of peoples’ working lives that are closely associated with employees’ health and well-being: work engagement, workaholism, and job burnout. Differentiating between perfectionistic strivings and perfectionistic concerns (Stoeber & Otto, 2006), the present chapter presents {{an overview of the}} relevant research findings. Taken together, the findings suggest that (a) perfectionistic strivings show positive relationships with work engagement whereas perfectionistic concerns show no relationships or negative relationships, (b) perfectionistic strivings and perfectionistic concerns both show positive relationships with workaholism, and (c) perfectionistic strivings show negative relationships with burnout whereas perfectionistic concerns show positive relationships. To explain the opposite relationships that perfectionistic strivings and concerns show with burnout, two hypothetical models are presented. In Model 1, autonomous versus controlled motivation explain the opposite relationships of perfectionistic strivings and concerns with burnout. In Model 2, adaptive versus maladaptive coping explain the relationships.

40|$|Combustion of {{coal gangue}} is {{extensively}} used for power generation in China. In this paper, pyrolysis and combustion {{characteristics of a}} low-rank coal gangue have been investigated under oxy-fuel (O₂/CO₂) and air (N₂/O₂) conditions using a drop tube furnace and thermogravimetric analysis. Pyrolysis experiments were carried out in N₂ and CO₂ environments, which are the main diluting gases of air and oxy-fuel environments, respectively. The burnout and yields of volatile matter were analyzed during DTF experiments. At lower temperatures, the weight loss rate of coal gangue during pyrolysis in N₂ was higher than that in CO₂. However, further weight loss took place in CO₂ atmosphere at temperatures above 800 °C due to CO₂ gasification of chars. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) results confirmed that the pyrolysis in CO₂ environment {{can be divided into}} three stages: moisture release, devolatilization, and char gasification by CO₂ in a higher temperature zone. Combustion experiments were carried out in four different atmospheres: air, an oxygen-enriched air environment (30 % O₂– 70 % N₂ and 40 % O₂– 60 % N₂), an oxy-fuel environment (21 % O₂– 79 % CO₂), and an oxygen-enriched oxy-fuel environment (30 % O₂– 70 % CO₂ and 40 % O₂– 60 % CO₂). Coal gangue reactivity under oxy-fuel conditions differed from that under air combustion conditions. The combustion rate of coal gangue increased with increasing O₂ concentration while the ignition and <b>burnout</b> <b>points</b> shifted to lower temperatures and complete combustion was achieved at lower temperatures and shorter times. Comparison of the combustion performance of coal gangue in N₂/O₂ and CO₂/O₂ environments for equivalent O₂ concentrations indicated that the combustion characteristics of coal gangue in a CO₂/O₂ environment were similar to those in a N₂/O₂ environment at 21 vol % O₂ oxygen concentrations. However, increasing O₂ partial pressures resulted in a higher combustion rate under oxy-fuel conditions. Kinetic constants for the samples were calculated by using the isoconventional method. The activation energy decreased with increasing O₂ partial pressure under oxy-fuel combustion conditions and reached lower values compared to air combustion cases. The mineral matter reactions during coal gangue combustion were investigated by means of XRD analysis.

The studio suffered several setbacks during {{the sequence of events}} that led up to the creation of Burnout 3, including the cancellation of a project, a failed pitch, and a fall out with the game's eventual publisher Electronic Arts (EA). In 2002, Criterion was around 130 people divided into two development teams. One team was working on <b>Burnout</b> 2: <b>Point</b> of Impact, a follow up to Burnout, set to be published by Acclaim Entertainment. The other team had completed the development of the extreme sports game AirBlade for Sony Computer Entertainment Europe. Sony had intentions of continuing to collaborate with Criterion on a sequel to AirBlade, however the AirBlade team turned down the offer. Instead, Criterion began talks with EA, who had a proposal for Criterion to create a remake of the 1988 skateboarding video game Skate or Die!. Criterion were keen to work with EA and started development on the project. Following Burnout 2s release, Criterion prepared a pitch to EA Canada about working on a second game with the publisher. Criterion's proposed title was Need For Speed: Split Second, a stunt racing game within EA's Need for Speed series. Meanwhile, the Skate of Die! remake project was thrown into disarray when EA requested changes to the game's design and the creative direction of project shifted away from Criterion's vision. With development staff becoming unhappy and stressed about the project, the studio decided to contact EA and cancel the game. EA was displeased with their decision and {{the relationship between the two}} companies soured, leading to dissolution of the proposed Need for Speed game.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Burnout in the {{healthcare}} workers is formally defined as a state of physical, emotional and mental exhaustion caused by long-term involvement in situations that are emotionally demanding. Methods Using a random stratified sampling method and taking into account geographical location, specialty and type of employment, 172 physiotherapists working both in {{the private and public}} sectors completed an anonymous questionnaire that included several aspects related to burnout; the MBI scale, questions related to occupational stress, and questions pertaining to self image. Results Almost half (46 %) of the 172 participants believed that their job is stressful. Approximately 57 % of the physiotherapists who worked in the public sector and 40 % of those who worked in the private sector (p = 0. 038) reported that their job is stressful. In total, 21. 1 % of participants met Maslach's criteria for <b>burnout.</b> The <b>point</b> prevalence of <b>burnout</b> was as follows: (1) 13. 8 % of those who worked in the public sector and 25. 5 % of those in the private sector (2) 22. 2 % of males and 20 % of females (3) 21. 6 % who were married, 18 % who were single and 33. 3 % who were separated. Gender was found {{to be associated with the}} level of personal accomplishment (chi-squared test; p = 0. 049), as 17. 8 % of men compared with 24. 3 % of women reported high personal accomplishment. The number of years of working as a physiotherapist correlated negatively (r = - 0. 229, p = 0. 004) with the total depersonalization score.

40|$|Masteroppgave - Norges idrettshøgskole, 2012 Being a {{professional}} dancer, like an elite athlete, {{is characterized by}} extreme physicaland psychological demands, strict discipline, high commitment and with a pressure and pursuit to perform flawlessly. Due to the extreme achievement striving, physical- and psychological consequences associated with burnout may occur (Quested & Duda, 2011 a) Previous research (e. g., Hill, Hall, Appleton and Kozub, 2008) has indicated that perfectionism {{may be an important}} personality factor when examine vulnerability to and development of burnout in elite athletes. Few studies to date have investigated perfectionism and burnout in vocational dancers, but there is a great transfer value from research done in sporting contexts to dance, which can be viewed as an esthetic sport. The first {{purpose of the present study}} was to investigate the prevalence of and influence of Self-Oriented(SOP) - and Socially-Prescribed(SPP) perfectionism, Unconditional Self-Acceptance and Self-determined motivation (SDT: Ryan & Deci, 2000) on the development of burnout in vocational dancers in Norway. A second purpose was to investigate whether the association between perfectionism and burnout was mediated by unconditional self-acceptance. One hundred and forty vocational dancers (M age= 22, SD= 2. 0) completed questionnaires measuring the variables of interest at one point of time. The results using bivariate correlations analyses indicated significant positive relations between both SOP and SPP and burnout, and significant negative relations between unconditional self-acceptance and self-determination and burnout. The results showed that intrinsic motivation had the strongest negative relation to burnout symptoms. By using hierarchical regression analyses the results indicated that unconditional self-acceptance served as a partial mediator in the relationship between SPP and burnout, and fully mediated the relation between SOP and <b>burnout.</b> Findings <b>point</b> out the relevance and importance of strengthen an unconditional self-acceptance in dancers, and promote a dance environment with emphasis on self-determined motivation, by satisfaction of basic psychological needs to avoid burnout in vocational dancers (Quested & Duda 2011 a) ...|$|R
