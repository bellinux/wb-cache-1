Nature study was still prominent in the student's activities, with music, art, and drama. The traditional learning themes and school projects involving maple trees, Native Americans, ancient Egypt and other topics were preserved but adapted to serve the gifted curriculum. In early 1980, an early childhood (EC) program for three-year-olds was launched, designed to cater to the needs of gifted preschool children and prepare them to transition from home to kindergarten. Again departing from the prevailing educational theory, Avery Coonley introduced academics in the EC program, with the same focus on nature, music, movement, and practical skills as the higher grades.|$|E
500|$|When Tom Welling {{auditioned for}} the role {{he was not sure}} how to prepare. While waiting for his turn, he {{realized}} that the character is one thing above all else: [...] "... a high school kid ...." [...] To Welling, simply acting like he was a normal teenager, instead of like a super hero, was the perfect way to embody the character. Welling realized that <b>by</b> <b>doing</b> <b>that,</b> the special effects and other production elements would fill in the holes and perfect the character on screen. For one of his auditions, he read the graveyard scene with Kristin Kreuk (the first actor to be cast for the show), and the network thought they had [...] "... great chemistry".|$|E

It was intended to link the series directly into The Original Series by having T'Pau as a main character, who had previously appeared in the episode [...] "Amok Time". Instead, this character was developed into an original Vulcan character, T'Pol. Berman explained his vision for the series at launch, saying that [...] "we'll be seeing humanity when they truly are going where no man has gone before. We are seeing people who don't take meeting aliens as just {{another part of the}} job. It's not routine. Nothing is routine. Also, by bringing it back 200 years from Voyager, we're making the characters closer to the present, and <b>by</b> <b>doing</b> <b>that</b> they can {{be a little bit more}} accessible and a little bit more flawed and a little bit more familiar to you and me." ...|$|E

[...] Discussing the event during a subsequent interview with GQ, Fox expanded, [...] "I had such a joy in my heart <b>by</b> <b>doing</b> <b>that,</b> because in Mexico, piñatas are very meaningful. Piñatas are a celebration. Piñatas let you send messages. And the message is: Trump is empty inside. He's empty in his head. That's why I put my hand into his head. There was no brain there. That's what he is, an empty person." ...|$|E

Members of the Guide team also have a badge on vSides Forum. They were introduced in The Music Lounge Beta 9/10 between February and April 2007. At the beginning of the Guide program in the Music Lounge days, there was no official and public applications process for Guides. vSiders got hand-selected by maturity and knowledge about the game by Doppelganger staff and had to write an essay to apply for the position. In winter 2007, former Guides were selected to become Senior Guides. The purpose of them was to assist and help (new) Guides as well as helping community team members at events by having the ability to fly attached to their role. Senior Guides also took part in reviewing Guide applications. The Senior Guide program was did away in June 2008. vSiders can become a Guide by an application process that opens at different times.|$|E
