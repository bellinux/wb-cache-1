A BOM may be used for communication between manufacturing partners, or confined to a single manufacturing plant.

In process industries, the BOM is also known as the formula, recipe, or ingredients list. The phrase [...] "bill of material" [...] (or BOM) is frequently used by engineers as an adjective to refer not to the literal bill, but to the current production configuration of a product, to distinguish it from modified or improved versions under study or in test.|$|E

"Tariff Shift" [...] is a {{substantial}} transformation {{that takes place in}} a NAFTA country A finished good must qualify under one of these rules to be eligible for free trade under NAFTA. This is just one example of a qualification for a free-trade agreement. If a certificate of origin is present from a supplier demonstrating that the good originated in a country under the associated free trade agreement, no further calculations are needed. When qualifying products for an FTA, the use of an automated system allows importers to stay up-to-date on international compliance regulations, as well as solicit suppliers via the web instead of manually.
