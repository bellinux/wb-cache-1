5|$|To {{make the}} boot loader {{appealing}} to other operating system developers, Apple added features to allow {{flexibility in the}} booting process such as network boot using TFTP and load Mach-O and ELF formatted kernels. BootX can also boot from HFS, HFS+, UFS and ext2 formatted volumes. The boot loader can be manipulated at startup by holding down various key combinations to alter the booting process. Such functions include Verbose Mode, achieved by holding down the Command and V key at startup, which replaces the default Apple logo with text-based information on the boot process and Single User Mode, achieved by holding down the Command and S, which, depending on the operating system, may <b>boot</b> <b>into</b> a more basic command-line or text-based version of the operating system, to facilitate maintenance and recovery action. The ROM can also be set to require a password to access these technical functions using the OpenFirmware interface.|$|E

25|$|Slackware ARM – version 13.37 {{and later}} {{runs on the}} Raspberry Pi without modification. The 128–496MB of {{available}} memory on the Raspberry Pi is at least twice the minimum requirement of 64MB needed to run Slackware Linux on an ARM or i386 system. (Whereas the majority of Linux systems <b>boot</b> <b>into</b> a graphical user interface, Slackware's default user environment is the textual shell / command line interface.) The Fluxbox window manager running under the X Window System requires an additional 48MB of RAM.|$|E

25|$|AMD's latest CPUs, {{from the}} 'Bulldozer' {{architecture}} onwards, contain {{almost all the}} latest instruction sets, and hence, some kernels with full SSE4 support have also been released. After two months, Niresh's Distro was released for Mavericks which supports AMD CPUs and latest Intel CPUs. It also has a custom kernel that allows Intel Atom processors to <b>boot</b> <b>into</b> Mavericks. Niresh's was the only free distro which was released for Mavericks, since the iAtkos Team decided to release their Mavericks distro for specific hardware on donation basis.|$|E
25|$|Originally, the {{hardware}} architecture was so {{closely tied to}} the classic Mac OS system {{that it was impossible to}} boot an alternative operating system. The most common workaround, is to <b>boot</b> <b>into</b> Mac OS and then to hand over control to a Mac OS-based bootloader application. Used even by Apple for A/UX and MkLinux, this technique is no longer necessary since the introduction of Open Firmware-based PCI Macs, though it was formerly used for convenience on many Old World ROM systems due to bugs in the firmware implementation. Since then, Mac hardware boots directly from Open Firmware in most PowerPC-based Macs or EFI in all Intel-based Macs.|$|E
25|$|The fourth round saw Boro again drawn away, {{this time}} versus League Two strugglers Mansfield Town. Southgate named a {{slightly}} weakened side for the game; live on BBC's Match of the Day - Adam Johnson, Lee Dong-Gook and Lee Cattermole earning starting places, with Stewart Downing, George Boateng and a returning Mido on the bench. Dong-Gook got his second Boro goal following a corner from Johnson on 17 minutes. Huth was lucky {{not to be}} sent off for a high <b>boot</b> <b>into</b> the stomach of Michael Boulding. Mido came on for the final twenty minutes. After being put under massive pressure, Middlesbrough sealed the victory, following a cruel own goal from captain Jake Buxton.|$|E

25|$|The Apple–Intel architecture, or Mactel, is an {{unofficial}} name used for Apple Macintosh personal computers developed and manufactured by Apple Inc. that use Intel x86 processors, {{rather than the}} PowerPC and Motorola 68000 ("68k") series processors used in their predecessors. With the change in architecture, a change in firmware became necessary; Apple selected the Intel-designed Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) as its comparable component to the Open Firmware used on its PowerPC architectures, and as the firmware-based replacement for the PC BIOS from Intel. With the change in processor architecture to x86 Macs gained the ability to <b>boot</b> <b>into</b> non-Apple operating systems, while Intel VT-x brought near-native virtualization with OS X as host OS.|$|E
25|$|PS3's {{hardware}} {{has also}} been used to build supercomputers for high-performance computing. Fixstars Solutions sells a version of Yellow Dog Linux for PlayStation 3 (originally sold by Terra Soft Solutions). RapidMind produced a stream programming package for PS3, but were acquired by Intel in 2009. Also, on January 3, 2007, Dr. Frank Mueller, Associate Professor of Computer science at NCSU, clustered 8 PS3s. Mueller commented that the 256MB of system RAM is a limitation for this particular application and is considering attempting to retrofit more RAM. Software includes: Fedora Core 5 Linux ppc64, MPICH2, OpenMP v 2.5, GNU Compiler Collection and CellSDK 1.1. As a more cost-effective alternative to conventional supercomputers, the U.S. military has purchased clusters of PS3 units for research purposes. Retail PS3 Slim units cannot be used for supercomputing, because PS3 Slim lacks the ability to <b>boot</b> <b>into</b> a third-party OS.|$|E
25|$|Version 3.0 {{retained}} {{all of the}} functionality {{from previous}} versions and added new features and tools. Support for DirectX 8.1 and OpenGL was added, allowing Mac users to play some Windows games without the need to <b>boot</b> <b>into</b> Windows with Boot Camp. A new feature called SmartSelect offers cross OS file and application integration by allowing the user to open Windows files with Mac OS X programs and vice versa. Parallels Explorer was introduced, which allows the user to browse their Windows system files in Mac OS X without actually launching Windows. A new snapshot feature was included, allowing one to restore their virtual machine environment to a previous state in case of issues. Further, Parallels added a security manager to {{limit the amount of}} interaction between the Windows and Mac OS X installations. This version included a long-awaited complete “Parallels tools'” driver suite for Linux guest operating systems. Therefore, integration between Mac OS X and Linux guest-OS's has been greatly improved.|$|E

500|$|After a 1–0 {{defeat at}} Stoke City on 7 November, a Britannia Stadium steward made an {{allegation}} of assault against Costa, which was resolved without further action. Also that month, Costa was again {{involved in a}} skirmish with Liverpool's Martin Škrtel, where he appeared to dig his <b>boot</b> <b>into</b> the Slovak defender's chest, but escaped punishment by the FA. On 29 November, Costa was an unused substitute in a match against Tottenham and threw his bib on the floor when Ruben Loftus-Cheek was sent on at his expense. Mourinho told the media that, [...] "For me his behaviour is normal. A top player on the bench will not be happy." ...|$|E

60|$|The other's face, in {{just the}} glimpse I had of it, was as if carved out of wood, except for that {{something}} you see behind the masks of driven bullocks, deeply resentful. His cap was off, and one saw he was grey-haired; his cheeks, stretched over cheekbones solid as door-handles, were a purplish-red, his grey moustache was damp, his light blue eyes stared like a codfish's. He reminded me queerly of those Parisian cochers one still sees under their shining hats, wearing an expression of being your enemy. His short stocky figure was dumped stolidly as if he meant never to move again; on his thick legs and feet he wore mufflings of cloth <b>boot,</b> <b>into</b> which his patched and stained grey-blue trousers were tucked.

5000|$|Fashion <b>Boots</b> <b>into</b> Haute Couture. Herbert Levine {{is widely}} {{credited}} {{as the first}} label to have introduced <b>boots</b> <b>into</b> Haute Couture. As early as 1953, Herbert Levine introduced a calf-length boot in white kidskin, which sold poorly. Most retailers saw boots as a separate category of footwear from shoes, to be worn for protection from bad weather or for work. By contrast, Herbert Levine argued that boots were shoes and could {{be an integral part}} of a woman's outfit. In 1957, Herbert Levine produced an entire collection built around fashion boots, and despite widespread skepticism on the part of other designers and manufacturers, calf-high, kitten-heeled fashion boots for women began to grow in popularity in the late 1950s and early 1960s. With fashion boots, Herbert Levine started a trend which remains current four decades later.|$|R
