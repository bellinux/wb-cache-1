[...] Whitney Strub of PopMatters stated, [...] "what can one expect from an album that promises to get more personal but includes lyrics declaring, “no one knows how I feel inside/And I’m keeping it that way” (from “Fastlane”)?", and commenting that [...] "with A Little More Personal, Lindsay Lohan reminds us that, despite such blossoms, pop still {{has the potential to}} climb the charts while combining blandness, banality and vapidity".

It's epic. It's spectacular. But two hours later, it also proves to be emotionally impenetrable." [...] Giving the film a C- rating, Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly criticized Parker's direction, stating, [...] "Evita could have worked had it been staged as larger-than-life spectacle... The way Alan Parker has directed Evita, however, it's just a sluggish, contradictory mess, a drably [...] "realistic" [...] Latin-revolution music video driven by a soundtrack of mediocre '70s rock." [...] Janet Maslin from The New York Times praised Madonna's performance as well as the costume design and cinematography, but wrote that the film was [...] "breathless and shrill, since Alan Parker's direction shows no signs of a moral or political compass and remains in exhausting overdrive all the time." [...] Jane Horwitz of the Sun-Sentinel stated, [...] "Madonna sings convincingly and gets through the acting, but her performance lacks depth, grace and muscle. Luckily, director Alan Parker's historic-looking production with its epic crowd scenes and sepia-toned newsreels shows her off well." ...|$|E

The small-scale state-space model used by Stock and Watson (1991) and the large-scale static principal components model used by Stock and Watson (2002) are employed to derive common factors. Subsequently, using these common factors, forecasts of real economic growth for Estonia are performed and evaluated against benchmark models for different estimation and forecasting periods.
