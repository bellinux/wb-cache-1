The Masson machine, built by Platts of Oldham in 1902, doubled rovings from the <b>breaker</b> <b>cards</b> into card lap. This was then {{passed through the}} finisher card to produce the rovings [...] This process was known as double carding. The Derby Doubler was patented by Evan Leigh of Ashton-underline (21 December 1810 - 2 February 1876) and, though superseded, still continued in service in condensing coarse counts.|$|R
50|$|James, an avid coffee drinker, {{did a good}} {{business}} designing and promoting steam mills to small seaport towns which {{did not have any}} experience with mills and needed his expertise to advise on which equipment to buy and how to design the entire factory. James knew all the best equipment and their manufacturers and selected the pickers, <b>breaker</b> <b>cards,</b> drawing heads, Providence Machine fly frames, Mason finished cards, spinning equipment looms and steam engines from Providence's India Point Works run by Fairbanks, Bancroft and Company and later by Corliss, Nightengale and Company.|$|R
30|$|These {{layers of}} fibres were {{processed}} through softener machine for softening of banana fibres and then carding of banana fibres {{was carried out}} on <b>breaker</b> jute <b>carding</b> machine. After carding the 100 % banana fibers web was fed to needle punching machine and 100 % parallel laid (P.L.) banana non-woven fabric was prepared. The cross laid (C.L.) non-woven fabric was prepared by mixing 60 : 40 % of banana fibres with polypropylene fibres and these carded web was fed to needle punching machine for preparation of 60 : 40 % cross laid banana: polypropylene non-woven fabric.|$|R
50|$|This {{illustrates}} firstly {{the hand}} weavers cottage, with a frame loom {{with a hand}} thrown shuttle, mannikins represent the weaver and two women spinning the yarn on different types of wheel. A child is shown hand carding. It is here we see a 16 spindle spinning jenny that would have dated from about 1760, and a 50 spindle improved jenny. There is an original Arkwrights first carding machine. There is a complete sequence of machines that would have taken the bolls from the bales, opener, scutcher, <b>breaker</b> <b>card,</b> finisher card, draw frame and finally a complete Arkwright waterframe dating from 1790. Sharing the floor at Whitaker's Mill is the equipment needed to prepare the waste cotton for the cards in the room above. There is a single cylinder pisker for soft waste and a six cylinder devil for the hard waste.|$|E

40|$|Carding is one {{important}} step in processing line of jute spinning. The cylinder {{is the heart of}} the whole machine due to the carding action, which causes from its cylinder speed and other rollers. This action mainly occurs in <b>breaker</b> <b>card</b> machine. This study was carried out to find out the effectiveness of various speeds of <b>breaker</b> <b>card</b> cylinder on fibre length and quality of jute yarn 276 tex (8 lbs. /spy). Medium speed of the brake card cylinder was better than any other speeds for good fibre length and quality of jute yarn...|$|E
