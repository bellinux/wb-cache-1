50|$|The closure {{temperature}} {{of a system}} can be experimentally determined in the lab by artificially resetting sample minerals using a high-temperature furnace.

40|$|AbstractA {{model for}} the {{prediction}} of the wetting delay through jet impingement quenching of a high <b>temperature</b> brass <b>block</b> {{has been carried out}} in this study. The Liquids used for jet impingement on the brass surface are water and emulsion of cutting oil (used in machine shop) and water at a proportion of 1 : 20. The varying parameters used for the analysis are different velocities of jet (3 m/s, 5 m/s, 10 m/s) and initial <b>block</b> <b>temperature</b> from 250 < C to 450 < C at an interval of 50 < C. The wetting delay and wetting front propagation varied for different test conditions. When a liquid jet was impinged on the heated surface of the brass block, the jet remains stagnant up to a small region and the surface temperature decreases very slowly with time. After a certain interval, the surface temperature decreases at faster rate and the wetting front starts to move in the radial direction. The time that passes during the stagnant period of the wetting front is the wetting delay. The wetting delay in case of emulsion of cutting fluid is much higher as compared to water. The evidence was clear for wetting delay measurement for water from graphical analysis but for the emulsion it is not as evident as in many cases the temperature drops linearly with time and the wetting delay can’t be actuated exactly. The water wave front propagates throughout the surface but in case of the emulsion the wetting front does not even cover half of the total metal surface after a long interval of time. The effect of different experimental parameters on the wetting delay is also observed in the present study. The characteristics of the wetting delay are influenced by jet velocity and initial <b>block</b> <b>temperature.</b> For higher jet velocity and lower initial <b>block</b> <b>temperature</b> wetting delay decreases...|$|R

40|$|Three {{components}} of magnetization {{have been observed}} in ninety-six samples (twelve sites) of amygdaloidal basalts and "sedimentary greenstones" of the Unicoi Formation in the Blue Ridge Province of northeast Tennessee and southwest Virginia. These components could be isolated by alternating field as well as thermal demagnetization. One component, with a direction close {{to that of the}} present-day geomagnetic field is ascribed to recent viscous remanent magnetizations; another component, with intermediate <b>blocking</b> <b>temperatures</b> and coercivities, gives a mean direction of D = 132 [deg], I = + 43 [deg], [alpha] 95 = 9 [deg] for N = 10 sites before correction for tilt of the strata. This direction and the corresponding pole position are close to Ordovician/Silurian data from the North American craton and we infer this magnetization to be due to a thermal(?) remagnetization during or after the Taconic orogeny. This magnetization is of post-folding origin, which indicates that the Blue Ridge in our area was structurally affected by the Taconic deformation. The third component, with the highest <b>blocking</b> <b>temperatures</b> and coercivities, appears to reside in hematite. Its mean direction, D = 276 [deg], I = - 17 [deg], [alpha] 95 = 13. 8 [deg] for N = 6 sites (after tilt correction) corresponds to a pole close to Latest Precambrian and Cambrian poles for North America. The fold test is inconclusive for this magnetization at the 95 % confidence level because of the near-coincidence of the strike and the declinations. We infer this direction to be due to early high-temperature oxidation of the basalts, and argue that its magnetization may have survived the later thermal events because of its intrinsic high <b>blocking</b> <b>temperatures.</b> A detailed examination of the paleomagnetic directions from this study reveals that the Blue Ridge in this area may have undergone a small counterclockwise rotation of about 15 [deg]...|$|R
40|$|The cooling {{rates at}} which rocks acquire thermoremanent magnetizations (TRMs), affect their {{unblocking}} temperatures in thermal demagnetization experiments; similarly the heating rates {{at which the}} thermal demagnetization experiments are done also affect the unblocking temperature. We have tested the effects of variable cooling and heating rates on the unblocking temperatures of two natural non-interacting, magnetically uniform (single-domain, SD) (titano) magnetite samples and a synthetic SD magnetoferritin sample. While previous studies have only considered unblocking temperatures for stepwise thermal demagnetization data (i. e. the room-temperature magnetization after incremental heating), in this work we derive an expression for continuous thermal demagnetization of both TRMs and viscous remanent magnetizations (VRMs) and relate the heating rate to an effective equivalent hold time of a stepwise thermal demagnetization experiment. Through our analysis we reach four main conclusions: First, the theoretical expressions for the heating/cooling rate effect do not accurately predict experimentally observed <b>blocking</b> <b>temperatures.</b> Empirically, the relation can be modified incorporating a factor that amplifies both the temperature and the heating rate dependence of the heating/cooling rate effect. Using these correction factors, Pullaiah nomograms can accurately predict <b>blocking</b> <b>temperatures</b> of both TRMs and VRMs for continuous heating/cooling. Second, demagnetization temperatures are approximately predicted by published ‘Pullaiah nomograms’, but blocking occurs gradually over temperature intervals of 5 – 40 K. Third, the theoretically predicted temperatures correspond to ∼ 54 – 82 [*]per[*]cent blocking, depending on the sample. Fourth, the <b>blocking</b> <b>temperatures</b> {{can be used to}} obtain estimates of the atomic attempt time τ 0, which were found to be 3 × 10 − 10 [*]s for large grained (titano) magnetite, 1 × 10 − 13 [*]s for small grained (titano) magnetite below the Verwey transition and 9 × 10 − 10 [*]s for magnetoferritin (∼ 8 [*]nm) ...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{the present}} study, we {{assessed}} {{the relationship between}} subgluteal sciatic nerve <b>blocking</b> and skin <b>temperature</b> by infrared thermography in the lower extremity. We hypothesized that blocking the sciatic nerve will {{lead to an increase}} in temperature, and that this will correlate with existing sensory block tests. METHODS: We studied 18 healthy individuals undergoing orthopaedic surgery of the foot under ultrasound-guided subgluteal blockade of the sciatic nerve with 30 ml ropivacaine 7. 5 mg/ml. Skin temperature was measured on the toes, the dorsal and plantar side of the foot, the malleoli, and the lateral side of the lower leg, just before sciatic nerve blockade and at 10 -min intervals thereafter. RESULTS: Baseline skin temperatures showed a significant distal-to-proximal gradient. After sciatic <b>block,</b> <b>temperatures</b> on the <b>blocked</b> side increased significantly in the toes and foot. When comparing pinprick to skin temperature in a receiver operating curve, there was an AUC of 85. 9 % (95 % confidence interval = 83. 7 - 88. 2 %, P < 0. 001). The medial malleolus (not being innervated by the sciatic nerve) showed no significant difference to the lateral. CONCLUSIONS: After sciatic nerve <b>block,</b> <b>temperatures</b> of the foot increased significantly. There was a good correlation between pinprick testing and infrared temperature measurement. This makes infrared skin temperature measuring a good test in determining block success when sensory testing is impossible...|$|R
