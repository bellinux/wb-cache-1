5|$|All {{variations}} of the argument from morality <b>begin</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> observation about moral thought or experiences and conclude with the existence of God. Some of these arguments propose moral facts which they claim evident through human experience, arguing that God is the best explanation for these. Other versions describe some end which humans should strive to attain, only possible if God exists.|$|E
5|$|The first {{movement}} is scored for five-part choir, woodwinds and strings. As the Dresden Mass style required, it {{opens with a}} short homophonic section, followed by an extended fugue in two sections, which both <b>begin</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> instrumental fugue.|$|E
5|$|Early {{attestations}} of {{the name}} in Basque include Errama-itçéla, Erroumancel, later errumanzel and erremaitzela. The initial E- is the Basque prosthetic vowel, added because no Basque word may <b>begin</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> R-, and the final -a is the absolutive case suffix, used when citing a name. If this etymology is correct, it is a rare case of a native Romani name for themselves (an endonym) being borrowed by another language.|$|E
50|$|Kierkegaard's pseudonymous works <b>begin</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> preface. Fear and Trembling <b>begins</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> Preface by Johannes de silentio. His Upbuilding Discourses <b>begin</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{dedication}} to the single individual, who has become Abraham in this work.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the level}} of pronunciation, Arapaho words cannot <b>begin</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> vowel, so where the {{underlying}} form of <b>a</b> word <b>begins</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> vowel, a prothetic [...] is added.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike in most Arabic dialects, Egyptian Arabic {{has many}} words that logically <b>begin</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> vowel (e.g. [...] 'I'), in {{addition}} to words that logically <b>begin</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> glottal stop (e.g. [...] 'very', from Classical [...] 'strong'). When pronounced in isolation, both types of words will be sounded <b>with</b> <b>an</b> initial glottal stop. However, when following another word, words <b>beginning</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> vowel will often follow smoothly after the previous word, while words <b>beginning</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> glottal stop will always have the glottal stop sounded, e.g.: ...|$|R
5|$|In {{a typical}} day, each crew member divided {{his time between}} {{physical}} exercise, station assembly and maintenance, experiments, communications with ground personnel, personal time, and bio-needs activities (such as rest and eating). The crew's daily schedule usually operated on UTC; for example, a typical morning {{had been scheduled to}} <b>begin</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> electronic wake-up tone at about 05:00 UTC. But during the expedition, a more typical wake-up time was actually between 06:00 and 07:00 UTC. The crew's sleep habits were sometimes shifted to accommodate the schedules of visiting shuttles or resupply vehicles.|$|E
5|$|The texts for {{the early}} cantatas were drawn mostly from biblical {{passages}} and hymns. Features characteristic of his later cantatas, such as recitatives and arias on contemporary poetry, were not yet present, although Bach may have heard them in oratorios by Buxtehude, or even earlier. Instead, these early cantatas include 17th-century elements such as motets and chorale concertos. They often <b>begin</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> instrumental sinfonia or sonata (sonatina). The following table lists the seven extant works composed by Bach until 1708, when {{he moved on to}} the Weimar court.|$|E
5|$|However, the Rashtrakuta kings also patronized Hinduism's {{followers}} of the Shaiva, Vaishnava and Shakta faiths. Almost all of their inscriptions <b>begin</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> invocation to god Vishnu or god Shiva. The Sanjan inscriptions tell of King Amoghavarsha I sacrificing a finger from his left hand at the Lakshmi temple at Kolhapur to avert a calamity in his kingdom. King Dantidurga performed the Hiranyagarbha (horse sacrifice) and the Sanjan and Cambay plates of King Govinda IV mention Brahmins performing such rituals as Rajasuya, Vajapeya and Agnishtoma. An early copper plate grant of King Dantidurga (753) shows an image of god Shiva and the coins of his successor, King Krishna I (768), bear the legend Parama Maheshwara (another name for Shiva). The kings' titles such as Veeranarayana showed their Vaishnava leanings. Their flag had {{the sign of the}} Ganges and Yamuna rivers, perhaps copied from the Badami Chalukyas. The famous Kailasnatha temple at Ellora and other rock-cut caves attributed to them show that the Hinduism was flourishing. Their family deity was a goddess by name Latana (also known as Rashtrashyena, Manasa Vindyavasini) who took the form of a falcon to save the kingdom. They built temples with icons and ornamentation that satisfied the needs of different faiths. The temple at Salotgi was meant for {{followers of}} Shiva and Vishnu and the temple at Kargudri was meant for worshipers of Shiva, Vishnu and Bhaskara (Surya, the sun god).|$|E

50|$|Various {{programming}} languages including Prolog, Haskell, Ruby and Go treat identifiers <b>beginning</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{capital letter}} differently from identifiers <b>beginning</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> small letter, a practice {{related to the}} use of sigils.|$|R
50|$|The Meditation <b>begins</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{rational}} moral comparison {{and proceeds}} to a frenzy of increasingly unlikely comparisons. While the satire <b>begins</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> pitch-perfect imitation of the kindly Boyles tone, it ends in a frantic, misanthropistic and misognynistic note of despair and nihilism. Also, while it <b>begins</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> hopeful call to self-examination, it moves eventually into a condemnation of all efforts at improvement.|$|R

25|$|The {{report said}} that the {{democratic}} will of the Puerto Rican people was paramount for the future status of the territory. It suggested any change should <b>begin</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> expression from the people of Puerto Rico on whether to maintain current territorial status or establish a permanent non-territorial status {{with regard to the}} United States. It recommended that the will of people be ascertained in a way to provide clear guidance for future action by Congress.|$|E

50|$|Khwarshi verbs {{normally}} {{consist of}} a stem, an agreement prefix indicating noun class and number of the relevant nouns, and a suffix showing tense, aspect, mood, or the like. Only about one fourth of the Khwarshi verbs show agreement, all of them <b>beginning</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> vowel. There is {{a small number of}} verbs <b>beginning</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> vowel that do not show agreement. Verbs <b>beginning</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> consonant do not show agreement.|$|R
25|$|Monongahela Cordmarked, Plain, and Incised pottery {{is found}} to be {{tempered}} with crushed shell. They used a coiling technique with malleation (tapping) by paddle and anvil. A cord-wrapped paddle was made to create the Cordmarkings. Interiors are smoothed and are plain or cordmarked with some smoothing. Decorations are found near the lip and adjacent lower rim. Monongahela Incised has the addition of incised parallel or rectilinear lines. The Worley village Complex (46Mg23) dates to about 900 CE (WVAS). Monongahela ceramics <b>begin</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> early grit or limestone tempered group.|$|E
25|$|Pindar's odes {{typically}} <b>begin</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> invocation to a god or the Muses, {{followed by}} {{praise of the}} victor and often of his family, ancestors and home-town. Then follows a narrated myth, usually occupying the central and longest section of the poem, which exemplify a moral, while aligning the poet and his audience {{with the world of}} gods and heroes. The ode usually ends in more eulogies, for example of trainers (if the victor is a boy), and of relatives who have won past events, as well as with prayers or expressions of hope for future success. The event where the victory was gained is never described in detail, but there is often some mention of the hard work needed to bring the victory about.|$|E
25|$|The {{simplest}} way to list candidates on a ballot paper is alphabetically, {{though they may}} also be grouped by party. However, any fixed ordering will give some candidates an unfair advantage, because some voters, consciously or otherwise, are influenced in their ordering of candidates by the order found on the ballot paper. For example, studies conducted in the Republic of Ireland, where candidates are listed alphabetically, have shown that candidates whose surnames <b>begin</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> early letter in the alphabet enjoy a small electoral advantage over candidates with later letters. To solve this problem some systems involve a random ordering of candidates, or an ordering that changes from one ballot paper to another (the latter is often called the Robson rotation, after Neil Robson, a Tasmanian MHA who championed such a system).|$|E

25|$|Rosenzweig, {{under the}} {{influence}} of his cousins and his close friend Eugen Rosenstock-Huessy, considered converting to Christianity. Determined to embrace the faith as the early Christians did, he resolved to live as an observant Jew first, before becoming Christian. After attending Yom Kippur services at a small Orthodox synagogue in Berlin, he underwent a mystical experience. As a result, he became a baal teshuva. Although he never recorded what transpired, he never again entertained converting to Christianity. In 1913, he turned to Jewish philosophy. His letters to his friend Eugen Rosenstock-Huessy, whom he had nearly followed into Christianity, have been published as Judaism Despite Christianity. Rosenzweig was a student of Hermann Cohen, and the two became close. While writing a doctoral dissertation on Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Hegel and the State, Rosenzweig turned against idealism and sought a philosophy that did not <b>begin</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> abstract notion of the human.|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} {{published}} in 1958, borrowing from the subtitle of The Lunatic View: A Comedy of Menace, a play by David Campton, critic Irving Wardle called Pinter's early plays [...] "comedy of menace"—a label {{that people have}} applied repeatedly to his work. Such plays <b>begin</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> apparently innocent situation that becomes both threatening and [...] "absurd" [...] as Pinter's characters behave in ways often perceived as inexplicable by his audiences and one another. Pinter acknowledges the influence of Samuel Beckett, particularly on his early work; they became friends, sending each other drafts of their works in progress for comments.|$|E

Together, the five infantry divisions of the XXI Corps, commanded by Lieutenant General Edward Bulfin, had a 4.4–to–1 advantage in total troop numbers and three times the defenders' heavy artillery.|$|E

500|$|Military {{buildings}} include unit-producing buildings such as barracks, archery ranges, stables, and castles, {{as well as}} defensive buildings such as {{walls and}} towers. Military buildings can perform research to improve the abilities of military units, increasing their strength, defensive capabilities, or other attributes. Castles are a key offensive and defensive building as they can build trebuchets, train the civilization's [...] "unique unit/s", and a hail of arrows at enemy units within range, with garrisoned units firing extra arrows. Castles can only be built after a player has reached the Castle Age, although in some game options, players <b>begin</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> already-built castle {{as early as the}} Dark Age.|$|E
