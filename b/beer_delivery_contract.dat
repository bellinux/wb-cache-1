40|$|Objective {{to reveal}} the peculiarities of forming {{conditions}} on price in <b>contracts</b> on <b>delivery</b> of oil products in wholesale and retail markets on thenbspbasis of analysis of legislation and law enforcement practice and to substantiate the proposals concerning the necessity to codify in the legislation the rule that a condition on price in the petrol <b>delivery</b> <b>contract</b> is an essential condition. 	Methods the methodological basis of the study includes general logical methods analysis induction analogy research synthesis and specific scientific methods of interpretation of law comparative law survey method. 	Results normative legal acts legal practice and theoretical ideas on price were analyzed.

The ban {{includes}} nitrous oxide (N2O) from adipic acid production. The reasons given were the perverse incentives, the lack of additionality, the lack of environmental integrity,the under-mining of the Montreal Protocol, costs and ineffectiveness and the distorting effect of a few projects in advanced developing countries getting too many CERs. From 23 December 2011, CERs from HFC-23 and N2O destruction projects were banned from use in the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme, unless they had been purchased under future <b>delivery</b> <b>contracts</b> entered into prior to 23 December 2011.

40|$|Recent {{changes in}} the feeder cattle futures {{contract}} specifications are expected to reduce hedging risk and may result in changes in optimal hedging levels. This study provides an estimate of feeder cattle hedge ratios associated with the new cash-settled feeder cattle futures contract and compares the levels of hedging risk present under the cash settled contract with the physical <b>delivery</b> <b>contract.</b> Hedging risks are compared for several weights of feeder steers and heifers and are analyzed across four market locations. Results indicate that hedging risk is generally, though not always, lower with cash settlement than under the physical <b>delivery</b> <b>contract</b> specifications. Key words: feeder cattle hedging, futures markets, hedging risks. The viability of the feeder cattle futures con-tract as a hedging mechanism {{has been a source}} of controversy for some time. Specifically, concern has been expressed that the large amount of basis risk present at both futures <b>contract</b> <b>delivery</b> and nondelivery points dis...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how delivery tariffs and private quality standards are determined in vertical relations that {{are subject to}} asymmetric information. We consider an infinitely repeated game where an upstream firm sells a product to a downstream firm. In each period, the firms negotiate a <b>delivery</b> <b>contract</b> comprising {{the quality of the}} good as well as a non-linear tariff. Assuming asymmetric information about the actual quality of the product and focusing on incentive compatible contracts, we show that <b>delivery</b> <b>contracts</b> are more efficient the lower the firms' outside options, i. e. the higher their mutual dependency. Buyer power driven by a reduced outside option of the upstream firm enhances the efficiency of vertical relations, while buyer power due to an improved outside option of the downstream firm implies less efficient outcomes.
