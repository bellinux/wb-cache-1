40|$|AbstractElectric {{vehicles}} enable {{clean and}} efficient transportation, however concerns about range anxiety and battery degradation hinder EV adoption. The common definition for battery end-of-life is when 70 – 80 % of original energy capacity remains, however little analysis {{is available to}} support this retirement threshold. By applying detailed physics-based models of EVs with data on how drivers use their cars, we show that EV batteries continue to meet daily travel needs of drivers well beyond capacity fade of 80 % remaining energy storage capacity. Further, we show that EV batteries with substantial energy capacity fade continue to provide sufficient <b>buffer</b> <b>charge</b> for unexpected trips with long distances. We show that enabling charging in more locations, even if only with 120  V wall outlets, prolongs useful life of EV batteries. Battery power fade is also examined and we show EVs meet performance requirements even down to 30 % remaining power capacity. Our findings show that defining battery retirement at 70 – 80 % remaining capacity is inaccurate. Battery retirement should instead be governed by when batteries no longer satisfy daily travel needs of a driver. Using this alternative retirement metric, we present results on the fraction of EV batteries that may be retired with different levels of energy capacity fade...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{an important}} problem of biomedical acid-base theory, {{where there are}} two apparently contradictory ways of describing the acid-base status of blood plasma, while the underlying physiology and chemistry obviously has to be only one. The two descriptions are called the traditional approach, based mainly {{on the work of}} Ole Siggaard-Andersen and the modern approach, {{based on the work of}} Peter Stewart and his followers. This work has three starting points. First are generally accepted basic concepts of acid-base chemistry and physiology. Second is an elegant formalism to the description of acid-base phenomena in complex solutions developed by Guenther. First part of this thesis builds on these two starting points, which serve as a basis for a detailed analysis augmented by the use of simple computer modelling. This results in formal description of several more advanced concepts, including the titration curves of proteins, behaviour of bicarbonate and protein buffers in single solution, relationship between strong ion <b>charge</b> and protein <b>buffer</b> <b>charge</b> and fuzzy division between strong ions and buffer ions in physiology.

40|$|SummaryDefining the {{mechanical}} and biochemical determinates of kinesin processivity {{is important for}} understanding how diverse kinesins are tuned for specific cellular functions. Because transmission of mechanical forces through the 14 – 18 amino acid neck linker domain underlies coordinated stepping [1 – 6], we investigated the role of neck linker length, charge, and structure in kinesin- 1 and kinesin- 2 motor behavior. For optimum comparison with kinesin- 1, the KIF 3 A head and neck linker of kinesin- 2 were fused to the kinesin- 1 neck coil and rod. Extending the 14 -residue kinesin- 1 neck linker reduced processivity, and shortening the 17 -residue kinesin- 2 neck linker enhanced processivity. When a proline in the kinesin- 2 neck linker was replaced, kinesin- 1 and kinesin- 2 run lengths scaled identically with neck linker length, despite moving at different speeds. In low-ionic-strength <b>buffer,</b> <b>charge</b> had a dominant effect on motor processivity, which resolves ongoing controversy regarding the effect of neck linker length on kinesin processivity [3, 5 – 7]. From stochastic simulations, the results are best explained by neck linker extension slowing strain-dependent detachment of the rear head along with diminishing strain-dependent inhibition of ATP binding. These results help delineate how interhead strain maximizes stepping and suggest that less processive kinesins are tuned to coordinate with other motors differently than the maximally processive kinesin- 1...|$|R
40|$|This work {{presents}} {{significant improvements}} of noise performance in synchronous CMOS image sensors and in asynchronous energy-sensitive singlephoton X-ray imaging systems. A {{detailed analysis of}} synchronous CMOS low-noise image sensors using conventional architectures reveals room for potential noise performance improvements, namely noise in switched-capacitor column-parallel amplifiers as well as imperfections in the low-pass filtering properties provided by such switched-capacitor amplifiers. A novel low-noise CMOS image sensor topology with pixel-level open-loop voltage amplification alleviates the identified issues to a large extent. An image sensor based on this concept has been designed and fabricated. Characterization shows that the image sensor achieves a readout noise equivalent charge below 0. 9 electrons and an overall noise floor as low as 1. 4 electrons including photodiode leakage shot noise at an exposure time of 1 / 60 s. Performance parameters that are potentially compromised due {{to the use of}} open-loop amplification, such as linearity and photoresponse non-uniformity, are shown to be absolutely competitive with conventional image sensors thanks to an advantageous feedback configuration for the sense node reset. Implementations of the presented topology are simple and elegant circuits requiring generally less silicon area in the periphery of the pixel field and less power consumption than conventional architectures. A second novel low-noise CMOS image sensor topology combining conventional pixel-level source-followers with column-level open-loop degenerate common-source amplifiers is proposed. This architecture provides an attractive combination of very low sense node capacitance, flawless low-pass filtering of noise from the pixel-level electronics by the use of column-level open-loop amplification, and advantageous noise performance of open-loop degenerate common-source amplifiers in comparison to OTA based switched-capacitor amplifiers. Theory, circuit simulation, and measurement of implemented test circuits indicate that image sensors based on this advantageous topology can potentially outperform the noise performance not only of conventional image sensor architectures but even of the presented topology using pixel-level voltage amplification. Analysis of charge-sensitive amplifiers (CSA), as used in conventional asynchronous single particle and high-energy photon detectors, explains the need for a sensing device with low capacitance in order to achieve good noise performance at reasonable power consumption. For instance, photogates or buried photodiodes in combination with a scintillator layer are sensing devices for X-rays with a very low capacitance. A novel charge pulse detecting circuit using a source-follower buffer plus a band-pass filter instead of a CSA with a band-pass filter is presented in this thesis. In the case of low sensing device capacitance, comparison of this circuit vs. CSAs shows that the trade-off between noise and power consumption is systematically advantageous in favor of the presented <b>buffered</b> <b>charge</b> pulse detecting circuit. A test structure implementation of a <b>buffered</b> <b>charge</b> pulse detecting circuit in conjunction with a lateral drift field photogate has achieved an equivalent noise charge of 12 electrons. This excellent noise performance will allow X-ray single-photon imaging with very low detection threshold and excellent energy resolution. This work contributes to further progress in cutting-edge noise performance of asynchronous single-photon X-ray image sensors and of synchronous lowlight CMOS image sensors. Thanks to their extremely low thermal noise, the presented novel topologies of synchronous CMOS image sensors will experience an immediate further improvement of noise performance in case of future progress in process technology either leading to reduced dark current of buried photodiodes or to a lower flicker noise power spectral density...|$|R

The transmitter consists of a single coil that is significantly smaller than the operation radius of the moving receiver. Therefore, the receiver is not always in the range of the transmitter and the power transfer occurs intermittent.

40|$|Increasing {{global warming}} due to fossil fuel usage, {{increasing}} diesel price {{and efforts to}} improve urban air quality increase {{the need for new}} vehicle technologies. Hybrid electric vehicles have the potential to reduce fuel consumption and emissions related to engine combustion. In this thesis, a hybrid electric vehicle concept (HEV) is compared to a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle concept (PHEV) for a city bus application. The difference between a HEV and a PHEV is that the latter can be charged from the electricity grid. The purpose of the thesis is to evaluate impact on total life-cycle-cost and total emissions when a part of the traction power is provided by an electric motor instead of a diesel engine. Three scenarios regarding the EU energy market are established, reflecting present day and possible future developments until 2015. The scenarios are used to investigate the total life-cycle-cost and total emissions impact of different marginal electricity generation technologies and energy prices. Optimisation calculations of different powertrain configurations are carried out using the computer tool THEPS. Costs and emissions from vehicle operation and power plant electricity generation are then compiled. The results of the project indicate {{that it is possible to}} achieve diesel fuel savings between 14 and 57 % for a PHEV compared to a HEV. The extent of the savings depends on type and properties of powertrain components and length of the pure electric propulsion part of the vehicle drive cycle. Life cycle costs can potentially be decreased by 5 - 6 % and total CO 2 -emissions by 18 %. In order to decrease PHEV life cycle cost, a certain minimum fraction of propulsion in all-electric-drive mode is required. For the life cycle cost advantage compared to HEVs to increase further, the diesel price must be high and energy buffers’ (e. g. batteries) cycling sensitivity, energy density and cost must be improved. Emissions from vehicle operation are generally lower for PHEVs compared to HEVs, giving PHEVs potential to reduce local emissions. However, the type of marginal electricity generation technology used to provide the external electricity for <b>buffer</b> <b>charging</b> has significant impact on total emissions...|$|R

40|$|The {{interaction}} between a cationic surfactant (dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide) and six model proteins adsorbed on to methylated silica and silica surfaces was investigated. The proteins were bovine serum albumin, cytochrome c, β-lactoglobulin, α-lactalbumin, lysozyme and ovalbumin. The adsorption of the proteins at pH 7 and their subsequent removal by surfactant were studied by in situ ellipsometry. The degree of desorption upon dilution {{and the degree}} of elutability were compared and no relationship between these parameters could be found, which indicates that the mechanisms behind the two ways of protein removal are quite different. Further, the degree of elutability by surfactant was related to the physicochemical properties of the proteins. It was found that the size, charge, temperature of denaturation and adiabatic compressibility influenced the degree of elutability at the hydrophilic negatively charged silica surfaces for those of the model proteins that were still adsorbed after <b>buffer</b> rinsing. Negatively <b>charged</b> proteins with high denaturation temperatures, indicating high structural stability, did not adsorb on to this surface (ovalbumin) or adsorbed to a very low degree and were desorbed upon rinsing with buffer (β-lactoglobulin). All proteins adsorbed on to the hydrophobic methylated silica and the parameters that seemed to influence the degree of elutability were size and shell hydrophobicity of the proteins...|$|R
40|$|A 1 V, programmable, accurate, high speed, {{single-ended}} {{charge pump}} is proposed, suitable for low voltage PLLs. It is designed in TSMC 90 -nm digital CMOS process and {{it consists of}} four switches in a current steering configuration, a unity gain rail to rail <b>buffer</b> for the <b>charge</b> sharing effect elimination, one more rail to rail amplifier for minimizing the DC current mismatch, a programmable current bias circuitry and two drivers based on the standard cell XOR gates specific configuration for achieving good synchronization between all charge pump input pulses at the PLL lock state. Replica biasing technique is applied to all charge pump switches. Current glitches and charge mismatch are suppressed by employing a mechanism with additional switches at the output. It exhibits a maximum DC current mismatch of 1 % and charge mismatch of 6 % over a wide output voltage range of 0. 7 V for {{the entire range of}} output currents. The wide range of the output voltage remains relatively constant and independent of the selected charge pump current amplitude. This is attained by applying appropriate variation of the W/L ratios of the bias cascode current sources via the employment of additional programmable switches such that their saturation voltages remain relatively constant, something which in turn enables the output currents range to be as wide as it is required.

40|$|IPs) or {{inositol}} 4, 5 bisphosphate [I(4, 5) P 2] excite Limulus ventral photoreceptors by inducing rapid {{bursts of}} inward current. After excitation by IPs, responses to subsequent injections of IP s or light flashes are often reversibly diminished (adapted). Single injections of IPs and I(4, 5) P 2 are effective at {{concentrations in the}} injecting pipette of 20 uM to 1 mM. Single injections of inositol 1, 4 bisphosphate are ineffective at concentrations of 100 - 500 JIM. Excitation by IP s or I(4, 5) P 2 {{is accompanied by a}} rise in intracellular free calcium, as indicated by aequorin luminescence. Prior injection of calcium buffer solutions containing 100 mM EGTA greatly diminishes the total charge transferred across the plasma membrane during excitation by IP 3 or 1 (4, 5) P 2, which suggests that a rise in Ca i is necessary for excitation by the inositol polyphosphates. Adaptation of the response to light by IPs is also abolished by prior injection of EGTA. In the same cells, the response to brief light flashes is slowed and diminished in amplitude by the injection of calcium <b>buffer,</b> but the <b>charge</b> transferred during the response is not significantly diminished. This suggests that light has access to a pathway of excitation in the presence of EGTA that is not accessible to intracellularly injected IP s...|$|R
40|$|The {{charge state}} {{distribution}} for oligonucleotides detected using negative ionization electro-spray-mass spectrometry {{has been studied}} {{as a function of}} solution counterion concentration. In the absence of added <b>buffer,</b> an average <b>charge</b> state (Z) of − 7. 2 is observed for a 10 μM aqueous solution of a 14 mer DNA at pH 7. 0, with [M − 8 H] 8 − the most abundant ion. As the solution concentration of ammonium acetate increases from 0. 1 to 33 mM, Z shifts to − 3. 8 with [M − 4 H] 4 − the most abundant charge state. The shift in most abundant charge state from [M − 7 H] 7 − to [M − 4 H] 4 − occurs abruptly between 1. 0 and 10 mM NH 4 OAc. Above 100 mM NH 4 OAc, the value of Z plateaus at − 3. 1, with [M − 3 H] 3 − the most abundant charge state. The addition of 1 – 50 mM glycine to the analyte solution does not alter Z, suggesting that the changes in charge state observed by using ammonium acetate result from a solution equilibration of cations around the DNA strand, rather than nonspecific gas-phase proton transfers during the electrospray process. The fraction of neutralized phosphate groups reaches a maximum of 0. 79 ± 0. 03 independent of length and sequence...|$|R
40|$|In this study, we {{engineer}} and investigate the interface structure and chemistry at the {{indium tin oxide}} ITO anode front side electrode {{as well as at}} the Mg Ag cathode back side electrode in metal phthalocyanine MePc C 60 organic solar cells OSCs. For the front side electrode, Zn Phthalocyaninetetraphosphonic acid Zn PTPA and Sn phthalocyanine axially substituted with tartaric acid Sn PTA have been used for the surface termination of ITO coated glass substrates. Both terminations yielded OSCs with higher fill factors and open circuit voltages increasing thus the power conversion efficiency by 33 and 67, respectively. A possible influence of a chemisorbed Zn PTPA on the film growth of the adjacent ZnPc absorber in the vicinity of the hybrid interface is discussed using x ray reflectivity and near edge x ray absorption fine structure data. Distinct effects of the Zn PTPA and Sn PTA terminations on the electronic properties of the ITO surface were found by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy XPS measurements at the valence band edge. We demonstrate the possibility to engineer the hybrid interface without additional buffer. For the back side electrode we report on the formation of <b>buffer</b> free <b>charge</b> carrier selective Mg Ag cathodes, which are applied for bulk heterojunction organic absorbers consisting of copper phthalocyanine CuPc donor and fullerene C 60 acceptor materials. The chemical and structural properties of the CuPc C 60 Mg Ag interface is investigated by element depth profiling using secondary ion mass spectrometry SIMS, grazing incidence x ray diffraction analysis GI XRD and XPS. We demonstrate that an optimum charge carrier selectivity is achieved with Mg Ag Ag cathode structures, where the Mg Ag alloy layer has a composition close to that of Ag 3 Mg. In addition, Mg diffusion into CuPc C 60 layer is observed. As a result, an interaction between Mg and Cu 2 with a concurrent change of oxidation state of both metals takes place. However, no formation of MgPc is observed. The findings of this work are discussed against the background of the performance and electrical properties of corresponding MePc C 60 based organic solar cells.
