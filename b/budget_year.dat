5|$|After the German Kaiserliche Marine (Imperial Navy) {{ordered the}} four s in 1889, a {{combination}} of budgetary constraints, opposition in the Reichstag (Imperial Diet), {{and a lack of}} a coherent fleet plan delayed the acquisition of further battleships. The former Secretary of the Reichsmarineamt (Imperial Navy Office), Leo von Caprivi became the Chancellor of Germany in 1890, and Vizeadmiral (Vice Admiral) Friedrich von Hollmann became the new Secretary of the Reichsmarineamt. Hollmann requested a new battleship in 1892 to replace the elderly ironclad turret-ship , built twenty years earlier, but the Franco-Russian Alliance, signed the year before, put the government's attention on expanding the Army's budget. Parliamentary opposition forced Hollmann to delay until the following year, when Caprivi spoke in favor of the project, noting that Russia's recent naval expansion threatened Germany's Baltic Sea coastline. In late 1893, Hollmann presented the Navy's estimates for the 1894–1895 <b>budget</b> <b>year,</b> again with a request for a replacement for Preussen, which was approved. The new ship abandoned the six-gun arrangement of the Brandenburgs for four large-caliber pieces, the standard arrangement of other navies at the time.|$|E

40|$|This study {{described}} and analyzed {{the experiences of}} administrators in six Indiana school corporations that adopted a school-year budget under authorization provided by Public Law 50 (PL 50 - 1996). The study had the following objectives: (a) to identify reasons why school corporations {{became involved in the}} pilot project, (b) to determine what happened {{as a result of the}} pilot project, (c) to determine if the pilot project was perceived as successful by the school officials in the pilot group, and (d) to identify recommendations of superintendents and business officials about further use of a fiscal <b>year</b> <b>budget</b> in Indiana school corporations. A qualitative research methodology was used in this study. Data collection consisted of interviews with superintendents and business officials in the pilot group during January 2000. The administrators joined the pilot group because they believed all Indiana school corporations would eventually convert to a fiscal <b>year</b> <b>budget</b> and that their experiences would facilitate the conversion. They supported the concept of a fiscal <b>year</b> <b>budget</b> because it was congruous with the school-year. During implementation of the fiscal <b>year</b> <b>budget,</b> the administrators felt abandoned and did not receive the support they expected. Yet, based on their experiences with a fiscal <b>year</b> <b>budget,</b> the administrators supported a conversion to a fiscal <b>year</b> <b>budget</b> for all school corporations. Administrators recommended the state phase-in a fiscal <b>year</b> <b>budget</b> for other non-pilot school corporations. These findings suggest that administrators had valid reasons for joining the pilot group. In addition, administrators viewed the absence of key leaders at the state level as problematic for the pilot project. Based on the evidence, it appears that a fiscal <b>year</b> <b>budget</b> produced the following advantages for the participating corporation administrators: (a) allowed for better tracking of expenditures, (b) required less work to determine the cost of a school-year program, (c) allowed for more freedom in the summer, and (d) provided for a less stressful year-end. The success of the pilot group did not produce support for fiscal <b>year</b> <b>budgets</b> from either non-pilot school corporation officials or from state officials.
