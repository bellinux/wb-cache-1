40|$|AbstractThis article {{presents}} {{the findings of}} recent studies on creep of advanced 9 - 10 % Cr ferritic steels. It is shown that the obstacles that fundamentally control creep in these steels are nano-scale MX carbonitrides whose time dependent coarsening leads to weakening. The second crucial factor in creep strengthening is the subgrain structure that results from martensitic transformation. The boundaries in this structure produce a back-stress through an anelastic <b>bowing</b> <b>mechanism.</b> A quantitative model that takes these microstructural features into account is shown {{to be able to}} predict the long-term creep behavior of ferritic steels...|$|E
30|$|Bilateral stress {{fractures}} of the ulna {{are very}} rare {{and have been}} reported on two occasions in adolescent patients in the literature. In the paper by Sujino et al. [17], a 15  year old adolescent male Japanese fencing player developed bilateral stress fractures of the ulna following his first training camp. In this type of fencing activity, the player grasps the special sword, which weighs about 500  g and is 115  cm long with both hands, and swings {{it up and down}} repeatedly. Stress fractures of both ulnae have been reported secondary to using crutches [17 – 19]. Steunbrink et al. [20] reported the first bilateral stress fractures of the ulna in an adult in a weightlifter secondary to a <b>bowing</b> <b>mechanism</b> caused by the biceps and flexor muscles that generates a supination–flexion movement of the ulna, leading to recurrent microtrauma.|$|E
40|$|High {{hardness}} TiAlN alloys for wear-resistant coatings exhibit limited lifetimes at elevated temperatures {{due to a}} cubic-AlN to hexagonal-AlN {{phase transformation}} that leads to decreasing hardness. We enhance the hardness (up to 46 GPa) and maximum operating temperature (up to 1050 degrees C) of TiAlN-based coatings by alloying with scandium nitride to form both an epitaxial TiAlScN alloy film and epitaxial rocksalt TiN/(Al,Sc) N superlattices on MgO substrates. The superlattice hardness increases with decreasing period thickness, which is understood by the Orowan <b>bowing</b> <b>mechanism</b> of the confined layer slip model. These results make them worthy of additional research for industrial coating applications. Funding Agencies|National Science Foundation; U. S.

40|$|Accumulative back {{extrusion}} ABE, {{as a new}} severe {{plastic deformation}} SPD method, was applied on a commercially pure aluminum, resulting in an ultrafine microstructure. The grain refinement was attributed to the shearing and or to the mechanical partitioning of the initial coarse grains as well as different dynamic recrystallization mechanisms i. e., discontinues and continues ones. The effects of imposing several passes along with the strain reversal path method during consecutive ABE passes were discussed. Mechanical characterization revealed that the yield and ultimate strength of pure Al were significantly increased through applying ABE. This was related to grain boundary and dislocation strengthening, {{as well as to}} Orowan dislocation <b>bowing</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> The elongation, however, was deteriorated after ABE processing. This was interpreted through the lack of ability of the material to accommodate the ABE induced strain, inhomogeneous distribution of strain across the ABE processed workpieces, and the reduced work hardening capacity of the fine grained aluminum. The formability index and static toughness were also considered to verify the overall mechanical performance of the ABE processed pure A...|$|R

These sections {{can be combined}} to handle ships of various lengths, and the sections themselves can come in different dimensions. Each section contains its own equipment for emptying the ballast and to provide the required services, {{and the addition of}} a bow section can facilitate the towing of the dry dock once assembled.

40|$|The {{modeling}} of string instruments was covered {{earlier in this}} course. However, {{a discussion of the}} <b>bowing</b> <b>mechanism</b> was delayed because of its inherent non-linearity. As we’ll see here, there is much similarity between model approximations for the clarinet reed and the bowed string mechanism. 1. 1 The String Model • As previously discussed, wave propagation along a string of finite length can be efficiently and accurately modeled with digital waveguide techniques. • The “nut ” is assumed ideally rigid, resulting in a reflection coefficient of- 1 for displacement or velocity wave components. • The bridge is assumed to have a finite impedance, so that some energy is transferred from the string to the instrument body. • Losses along the string cause the string energy to decay (in the absence of a driving mechanism). The losses can be commuted and implemented at discrete positions along the distrubuted string model. • The effects of dispersion resulting from string stiffness are less important in bowed string instruments because a driven system is forced to vibrate periodically. However, the natural inharmonicity of the strings will “color ” the resulting harmonic sound spectrum. 1. 2 The <b>Bowing</b> <b>Mechanism</b> • Under normal, ideal bowing conditions, the bow and string interaction is referred to as a “stick-slip” mechanism: During the greater part of each vibration, the string is “stuck ” to the bow and is carried with it in its motion. Then the string suddenly detaches itself and moves rapidly backward until it is caught again by the moving bow. • The beginning and end of the slipping are triggered by the arrival of the propagating bend or “kink”. • The string’s vertical motion at any one point is given by a sawtooth pattern. • The round-trip time depends only on the string length and the wave velocity. • This mechanism allows the player to add energy to the string and to sustain its vibrations. • Bowing near the string end requires greater force and produces a louder, brighter sound than bowing farther from the end. • The amplitude of vibration can be increased either by increasing the bow speed or by bowing closer to the bridge...|$|E

40|$|The {{first five}} {{chapters}} of this thesis focus on studies of band anticrossing (BAC) effects in highly electronegativity- mismatched semiconductor alloys. The concept of bandgap bowing {{has been used}} to describe the deviation of the alloy bandgap from a linear interpolation. Bowing parameters as large as 2. 5 eV (for ZnSTe) and close to zero (for AlGaAs and ZnSSe) have been observed experimentally. Recent advances in thin film deposition techniques have allowed the growth of semiconductor alloys composed of significantly different constituents with ever- improving crystalline quality (e. g., GaAs{sub 1 -x}N{sub x} and GaP{sub 1 -x}N{sub x} with x {approx} 14 eV). A band anticrossing model has been developed to explain these properties. The model shows that the predominant <b>bowing</b> <b>mechanism</b> in these systems is driven by the anticrossing interaction between the localized level associated with the minority component and the band states of the host. In this thesis I discuss my studies of the BAC effects in these highly mismatched semiconductors. It will be shown that the results of the physically intuitive BAC model can be derived from the Hamiltonian of the many-impurity Anderson model. The band restructuring caused by the BAC interaction is responsible for a series of experimental observations such as a large bandgap reduction, an enhancement of the electron effective mass, and a decrease in the pressure coefficient of the fundamental gap energy. Results of further experimental investigations of the optical properties of quantum wells based on these materials will be also presented. It will be shown that the BAC interaction occurs not only between localized states and conduction band states at the Brillouin zone center, but also exists over all of k-space. Finally, taking ZnSTe and ZnSeTe as examples, I show that BAC also occurs between localized states and the valence band states. Soft x-ray fluorescence experiments provide direct evidence of the BAC interaction in these systems. In the final chapter of the thesis, I describe and summarize my studies of optical properties of wurtzite InN and related alloys. Early studies performed on InN films grown by sputtering techniques suggested a direct bandgap of {approx} 1. 9 eV for this semiconductor. Very recently, high-quality InN films with much higher mobility have become available by using the molecular beam epitaxy growth method. Optical experiments carried out on these samples reveal a narrow bandgap for InN of 0. 77 eV, much lower than the previously accepted value. Optical properties of InGaN and InAlN ternaries on the In rich side have also been characterized and are found to be consistent with the narrow bandgap of InN. The bandgap bowing parameters in these alloys were determined. In the context of these findings, the bandgap energies of InGaN and InAlN were found to cover a wide spectral range from the infrared for InN to the ultraviolet for GaN and deep ultraviolet for AlN. The significance of this work is rooted in many important applications of nitride semiconductors in optoelectronics and solar energy conversion devices...|$|E

On 29 July, she completed the patrol at Midway.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Optical, near-infrared, and sub-millimetre {{observations}} of the outflow from the young (Class I/Class 0) source RNO 15 -FIR indicate that it is jet-driven, and that the “prompt” or <b>bow</b> shock entrainment <b>mechanism</b> dominates over “turbulent” entrainment. The CO J= 3 - 2 observations {{presented in this paper}} reveal a collimated, bipolar, molecular outflow driven by RNO 15 -FIR. The peaks in the CO outflow lobes are coincident with compact H 2 line emission features. We also find that the mass and momentum distributions in both flow lobes decrease with distance from the source, and that localised “peaks ” in these distributions coincide with the H 2 knots. It is likely, therefore, that the H 2 knots represent bow shocks along the jet which accelerate ambient gas into the flow via a prompt entrainment mechanism. Careful analysis of the data also suggests that the molecular outflow is “wiggling”. This variation in flow direction is possibly due to the orbital motion of the outflow source about some unseen binary companion. The orbital period and binary separation estimated from a sinusoidal fit to the wiggling along the flow suggest two embedded sources with a combined mass of roughly 12 M⊙.

40|$|Among all structures, {{high-rise}} buildings pose specific {{design challenges}} with respect of fire safety {{for a number}} of reasons, in particular the evaluation of both the fire development (fire action) and response of the structural system to fire (structural behaviour). In relation to the fire action, large compartments and open hallways often present in modern high-rise buildings don’t let themselves to be designed within compliance to current codes and standards. A comprehensive analysis of the fire environment is required to understand the fire dynamics in these cases. A Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) model allows a quite accurate representation of realistic fire scenarios, because it takes into account the distribution of fuel, the geometry, the occupancy of individual compartments and the temperature rise in structural elements that are located outside the tributary area of fire scenario. In relation to the structural behaviour under fire, the passive fire resistance of structural elements and the intrinsic robustness of the system are the only measures to rely on {{in order to maintain the}} structural integrity of the building during and after the fire and avoid major economic losses due to structural failures and prolonged inoperability of the premises. Disproportionate damages induced by fire can be avoided with a proper design of the structure, aimed at reducing the vulnerability of the elements to fire (i. e. their sensitivity to fire) or at increasing the robustness of the structural system (i. e. its sensitivity to local damages). The topic of this thesis is the evaluation of the structural safety in case of fire by means of advanced multi-physics analyses with direct reference to the modern Performance-Based Fire Design (PBFD) framework. A fundamental aspect is how some basic failure mechanisms can be triggered or modified by the presence of fire on a part of a structural system, such as three hinge <b>mechanism,</b> <b>bowing</b> effects, catenary action, thermal buckling and snap-through, sway and non-sway collapse. High rise buildings, which are expected to be susceptible to fire-induced progressive collapse, will be investigated. Critical elements will be identified in the system and countermeasure for enhancement of structural integrity will be suggested. The investigation of the response of such a complex structures subjected to fire scenarios requires the use of CFD and Finite Element (FE) models for a realistic evaluation of the fire action and of the structural response respectively...|$|R
