40|$|In {{this study}} we {{investigated}} the hepatotoxic effect of DNOC in rats, using biochemical serum parameters as indicators of liver disease. Experimental groups were injected intraperitoneally with 2. 8 mg/kg DNOC. While an increase was determined in LDH activities for all periods, an increase was determined for urea values only up to 16 hours. In general, increased AST and ALP activities were recorded up to the 8 th hour. Thereof, at later periods inhibition <b>was</b> <b>observed.</b> Inhibition <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> in female rats, while ALT activation <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> in male rats. Amylase activity inhibition <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> in both groups. Increased values <b>were</b> <b>observed</b> for cholesterol and HDL at the initial hours. No significant changes <b>were</b> <b>observed</b> in triglyceride levels. As a result, it has <b>been</b> <b>observed</b> that DNOC caused changes in serum enzyme activities and in biochemical parameters in female and male rats...|$|R
