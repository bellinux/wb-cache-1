25|$|First bench-run in 1916, the Arab was {{obviously}} {{inspired by the}} Hispano-Suiza V-8 engines but with very little in common when examined in detail. After submission to the Internal Combustion Engine Committee of the National Advisory Committee Sunbeam received an order for 1,000 in March 1917, increased to 2,000 in June 1917 as well as another 2,160 to be built by Austin Motors (1,000), Lanchester Motor Company (300), Napier & Son (300), and Willys Overland (560) in the United States of America. <b>Bench</b> <b>testing</b> revealed defects which required rectification, delaying completion of production drawings. Despite the delays {{one of the first}} flight-ready Arabs flew in a Martinsyde F.2 two-seat fighter/reconnaissance aircraft in mid 1917.|$|E
25|$|The M-34 began {{development}} in 1928 {{as a replacement}} for the Mikulin M-17, a license-built copy of the BMW VI. It had similar dimensions and attachment points, but was otherwise an entirely new design. It was a direct-drive, block-type engine with the cylinder block connected by long internal studs with centrally coupled articulated connecting rods. The development of the engine process was prolonged, with the engineering drawings not completed until April 1931. The first engine was delivered to TsIAM (Tsentralniy Institut Aviatsionnogo Motorostroeniya, Russian: Центральный Институт Авиационного Моторостроения) on 21 September 1931 for <b>bench</b> <b>testing</b> with imported carburetors and magnetos. It began state testing in November 1931, but failed. It was submitted again a year later with Soviet-designed K-34 carburetors, but was again rejected. It was resubmitted in January 1933, but again failed. It was flight-tested in a Tupolev TB-3 in October 1933.|$|E
25|$|Production {{fighters from}} 2020 onward will be {{equipped}} with a more powerful engine known as the izdeliye 30, a clean sheet design engine that will supersede the 117. NPO Saturn and MMPP Salyut are competing to supply this definitive second stage engine. Compared to the 117, the new powerplant will have increased thrust and fuel efficiency, greater reliability, and lower costs. The izdeliye 30 {{is designed to be}} 30% lower specific weight than its 117 predecessor. The new engine is designed to produce approximately 108kN (24,086lbf) of dry thrust and 178kN (39,680lbf) in afterburner. Full scale development began in 2011 and the engine's compressor began <b>bench</b> <b>testing</b> in December 2014. The first test engines are planned to be completed in 2016, and flight testing is projected to begin in 2017. According to Russian Deputy Minister of Defence Yuriy Borisov flight testing with new Izdeliye-30 engines will begin at Q4-2017. The new powerplant is designed to be a drop-in replacement for the 117 with minimal changes to the airframe.|$|E
30|$|Numerous {{researchers}} have studied transmission efficiency and fuel economy by conducting powertrain <b>bench</b> <b>tests</b> using a real gasoline engine {{as the power}} source and dynamometers as the load sources {{in addition to a}} gearbox and drive axles [7, 13]. Achieving driving cycles in <b>bench</b> <b>tests</b> are relatively more complicated than that in simulation models. <b>Bench</b> <b>tests</b> that use gasoline engines and dynamometers can be displaced by the forecast simulation model. In addition, matching system parameters with existing test data of powertrain components using the simulation model is more convenient than <b>bench</b> <b>tests.</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. [Purpose] The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{relationship}} between trunk stability and in-jury among young soccer players. [Subjects and Methods] The subjects were 19 male soccer players in junior high school. The presence of injury was noted, and trunk stability was measured by using the <b>bench</b> <b>test</b> and sideways <b>bench</b> <b>test,</b> which were modified from “The 11 + ” exercises. [Results] There was no significant difference in endur-ance time in the <b>bench</b> <b>test</b> or sideways <b>bench</b> <b>test</b> between the injury group (n= 9) and non-injury group (n= 10). Comparison within each group revealed no significant difference in endurance time between the right and left sideways <b>bench</b> <b>tests</b> in the non-injury group; however, the time in the left sideways <b>bench</b> <b>test</b> was significantly longer than that in the right in the injury group. [Conclusion] This study suggests that there is a relationship between asymmetric trunk stability and injury. Further research investigating the relationship between asymmetric trunk function and balance skills is necessary...|$|R
