These battery-related issues create an opportunity for Internet providers to broaden their role and start managing energy aspects of battery-driven mobile devices inside the home.

40|$|Pedal Assisted Bicycles (PAB) {{popularity}} is fast growing {{in urban areas}} due to their low energy consumption and environmental impact. In fact, when electrically moved, they are zero emission vehicles with very low noise emissions as well. These positive characteristics could be even improved by coupling a PAB with a fuel cell based power generation system, so increasing the vehicle autonomy without influencing their emissions and consumption performances. In this paper a conceptual Fuel Cell Pedal Assisted Bicycle (FC-PAB) design with compact metal hydride hydrogen storage is analysed {{by means of a}} mixed experimental and numerical approach. Even though the power source integration for such a vehicle is simpler than that for a car, it still represents a challenging effort maximizing PAB vehicle autonomy and minimizing, at the same time, its weight.

Environmental problems promote the adoption of new-generation electric vehicles for urban transportation. As it is well known, one of the weakest points of electric vehicles is the <b>battery</b> system. Vehicle <b>autonomy</b> and, therefore, accurate detection of battery state of charge (SoC) together with battery expected life, i. e., battery state of health, are among the major drawbacks that prevent the introduction of electric vehicles in the consumer market. The electric scooter may provide the most feasible opportunity among EVs. They may be a replacement product for the primary-use vehicle, especially in Eu- rope and Asia, provided that drive performance, safety, and cost issues are similar to actual engine scooters. The battery system choice is a crucial item, and thanks to an increasing emphasis on vehicle range and performance, the Li-ion battery could become a viable candidate.

40|$|Electric Vehicles (EV) are a {{key element}} of future smart cities, {{providing}} a clean transportation technology and potential benefits for the grid. Nevertheless, limited vehicle autonomy and lack of charging stations are preventing EVs to be broadly accepted. To address this challenge, French GreenFeed project is working to develop an interoperable and universal architecture to allow EV recharge across multiple cities and countries. In this work, we consider such architecture and focus on price setting by its main actors. We show how a Stackelberg game models the market, and we study the outcomes when users choose a recharge station according to objective and subjective parameters. Simulation shows the different actors' revenues, and the social and user welfare for different scenarios. I. INTRODUCTION Electric Vehicles (EV) and Hybrid Electric Vehicles are expected to dominate the automobile industry in the near future [12]. They present the great advantage of being environmentally friendly, dramatically reducing greenhouse gases emissions with respect to fossil-fuel vehicles [8], while almost eliminating noise pollution. Moreover, EVs are nowadays part of a whole evolutionary energy context. Energy transition is taking place in several countries in order to introduce distributed and renewable energy resources into the grid. Electricity market is also changing into a deregulated market, where time-variant tariffs are introduced, making demand side management solutions possible. In this context, EVs become also attractive because of the ancillary services they can offer to the grid. They can provide flexibility, by the possibility to shift the battery recharge. They can also provide the grid with the energy stored in their batteries through Vehicle to Grid (V 2 G) technologies, when energy production is lower than demand, and can store energy when supply exceeds demand. In spite of the aforementioned advantages, EVs are facing some barriers to their large adoption, such as the so-called range anxiety. This term refers to the fear that the vehicle will not have enough range to reach the destination. With state-of-the-art <b>batteries,</b> vehicle's <b>autonomy</b> is on the average 50 km and it can reach up to 160 km with large batteries [10]. However, these figures may dramatically vary according to driving manner and particular circumstances (e. g. temperature, weight, etc.). In this context, it is of paramount importance to have ubiquitous, easy and fast means to get the recharge service and to pay for it, regardless the EV model, without problems of interoperability or users' contract. In this sense, industry and research institutions, and standardisation bodies are carrying out efforts to develop electromobility and charging solutions, such as GreenFeed [3], green eMotion [2], standard ISO 15118 [5], the French initiative for EV roaming Gireve [1], or the platform Hubject [4]. Ongoing French project GreenFeed, aims to develop interoperable recharge solutions to foster EVs penetration. The project has defined an architecture, following the standard ISO 15118, that has the following main actors: EV Users (EVU), e-Mobility Provider (EMO), Charging Point Operator (CPO) and e-Mobility Operator Clearing House (EMOCH), as shown in Fig. 1 a. Such architecture structures a supply chain market for EV recharge. This work is part of the outcome of GreenFeed project, and focuses on the problem of setting EV recharge price at the different levels of the supply chain-one of the questions raised by the project. We assume variable recharge costs faced by the mobility providers (EMOs), but a fixed recharge price paid by the final client (EVU). Fixed prices are attractive {{from the point of view}} of the EVU, who is then shielded from electricity price volatility. We model the situation as a Stackelberg game, where CPOs play first, setting a price to be paid by the EMO, and where the EMO follows, setting a price for the recharge, which is paid by the final client. In addition, we take into account clients decision about where to get their EV recharged, considering subjective and objective parameters about the CPOs. Our results show interesting insights which could help CPOs and EMOs to set prices, and regulators to evaluate the market structure induced by GreenFeed's architecture. Simulation allow us to show in several scenarios the existence of a Nash equilibrium. The reminder of this paper is organised as follows. Section II reviews related work. In Section III we introduce the GreenFeed architecture, formally explain the market structure and the problem under study. We then formalise the problem as a Stackelber...|$|R

40|$|With {{the arrival}} of plug-in hybrid {{electric}} vehicles (PHEV) and battery electric vehicles (BEV) with significant <b>autonomy,</b> <b>battery</b> cooling becomes a necessity in driving mode to ensure their durability and ability to charge rapidly. Â For these vehicles, the refrigerating system may be composed of two evaporators (for front and rear passengers) in order to afford cooled air in the cabin and a chiller or a built-in battery evaporator to cool down the traction battery. This kind of multi-evaporator air-conditioning system {{has a number of}} technological barriers that must be undone. They are related to the components sizing in a context of cost reduction and control of such complex systems. The study therefore focuses on understanding the dynamic coupling of the several loop components such as the three evaporators having different cooling capacities. Understanding the behaviour of their respective expansion devices and the choice of these latter is also essential to control properly the transient phase and ensure an optimal operation of the air-conditioning system. In the literature, the effect of battery cooling by means of a chiller on the automotive air-conditioning loop has been already proved by simulation in the DymolaÂ® [1] environment. The simulation results for several driving cycles, refrigerants and ambient conditions emphasize the thermal discomfort caused by the use of the chiller loop. However, no global control strategy has been established. More recently, a first study of an air conditioning system model with three evaporators was carried out [2]. After the validation of their component models, a cool down test was performed to test the performance of their air conditioning system. From a control point of view, a simple PI control on the temperature of air blown at the front evaporator was used to regulate the speed of the compressor. In the building sector [3], the benefits of a supervisory controller to regulate the multi-evaporator air conditioning system was developed. Although this type of decentralized model seems to be robust and applicable to the car, it requires the use of sensors and components currently too costly and subject to a less restrictive environment than in automotive. The challenge of such a cooling loop lies in the dynamic coupling of components as well as their design. The model of a multi-evaporator automotive air conditioning system (two evaporators and a chiller) is thus produced using the 0 D AMESimÂ® software. In order to obtain more representative results in the transient state, the majority of components, including the chiller and regulators, are physical models giving a good representation of their internal geometries. These models were validated using experimental test maps. The first results highlight the importance of the regulators choice on the loop stability. A comparison of several types of expansion valves (orifice, thermostatic and electronic) will be conducted in order to select the most suitable to meet the price-performance compromise. Finally, control strategies are studied in transient state to further improve the stability and speed of convergence to the target instructions...|$|R

Our second hypothesis is that participants would allocate more attention on feedback information when they reach a critical <b>battery</b> <b>autonomy</b> situation, so the subjects had to drive a course with 100 % and 15 % autonomy left. Preliminary results indicate better driver performances and enhanced safety with econometer gauge feedback, probably due to the increased driver control and better applied driver attention...|$|E
30|$|Autonomous cars {{might be}} ‘green’, mainly by being ‘electric’ thus an {{important}} contributor to low carbon mobility. However, {{even if this}} is a possible and most desirable outcome, {{it is by no means}} guaranteed, although it is often taken for granted. Developing the Electric Vehicle (EV) technology, even if done in parallel to the development of AVs, is a fundamentally different technology and a different technological development trajectory that has its own formidable challenges. It might align, or it might not, with AVs’ development. Thus, it might turn out to be that the autonomous car will not be electric—an outcome most likely determined by the industry. If we assume that the autonomous cars will be electric, the source of electricity used to power them may not be from an environmentally friendly source. Likewise, electric cars’ <b>battery</b> <b>autonomy</b> 8 and safe disposal at the end of battery life are contemporary concerns of the automotive industry. Finally, vested interests and fossil fuel subsidies may distort markets [2] and the potential uptake of such otherwise environmentally friendly initiatives, such as the electric autonomous cars.|$|E
