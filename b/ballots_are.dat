5|$|Once all votes {{have been}} cast, the first Scrutineer chosen shakes the container, {{and the last}} Scrutineer removes and counts the ballots. If the number of ballots does not {{correspond}} {{to the number of}} cardinal electors present (including sick cardinals in their rooms), the <b>ballots</b> <b>are</b> burnt, unread, and the vote is repeated. If, however, no irregularities are observed, the ballots may be opened and the votes counted. Each ballot is unfolded by the first Scrutineer; all three Scrutineers separately write down the name indicated on the ballot. The last of the Scrutineers reads the name aloud.|$|E
5|$|The Scrutineers add {{up all of}} the votes, and the Revisers {{check the}} ballots and the names on the Scrutineers' lists to ensure that no error was made. The <b>ballots</b> <b>are</b> then all burned by the Scrutineers with the {{assistance}} of the Secretary of the College and the Masters of Ceremonies. If the first scrutiny held in any given morning or afternoon does not result in an election, the cardinals proceed to the next scrutiny immediately. The papers from both scrutinies are then burned together at the end of the second scrutiny.|$|E
5|$|Elections for {{president}} occur {{every five years}} by a national vote. Candidates, {{as soon as they}} are deemed eligible under Article 80 of the Constitution, are tasked with collecting signatures from eligible voters. After 100,000 signatures are collected and certified, the candidate is declared to be official by the Central Elections Committee. In the voting, the secret <b>ballots</b> <b>are</b> collected directly from eligible voters. During the first round of voting, if a candidate earns fifty percent plus one of the votes, they are declared the President-elect. If no one has achieved that number during the first round, then a run-off election will occur between two candidates who won the most votes. The person who wins the most votes in the run-off is declared the President-elect.|$|E

5000|$|The Absentee Ballot Track, Receive and Confirm (TRAC) Act (...) {{which gives}} states grant money {{to set up}} a system to track {{absentee}} ballots. Through the system, a voter will be able to find out if a <b>ballot</b> <b>was</b> mailed, if their completed <b>ballot</b> <b>was</b> received, and if their <b>ballot</b> <b>was</b> counted.|$|R
25|$|Referenda by mail are scanned into a {{computer}} system, but not counted until the close of polling. When the poll closes at 7.00pm, the scanned <b>ballots</b> <b>are</b> counted and the results announced soon after.|$|E
25|$|Campaigns by {{candidates}} not on {{the ballot}} generally are entirely symbolic, and while any voter can cast a write-in ballot, write-in <b>ballots</b> <b>are</b> not even tallied by election officials, except for candidates who have submitted a formal request that the tally be made.|$|E
25|$|The {{contingent}} vote, {{also known}} as Top-two IRV, or batch-style, {{is the same as}} IRV except that if no candidate achieves a majority {{in the first round of}} counting, all but the two candidates with the most votes are eliminated, and the second preferences for those <b>ballots</b> <b>are</b> counted. As in IRV, there is only one round of voting.|$|E

25|$|After {{the nominees}} list is published, another voting round is {{conducted}} to determine the winners of most categories. Voting for the Juno Fan Choice Award {{is open to the}} general public, while voting on general categories is limited to CARAS members. Winners in genre-specific or specialty categories are determined by specially appointed CARAS juries. As of 2010, <b>ballots</b> <b>are</b> audited by the major accounting company PricewaterhouseCoopers.|$|E
25|$|The {{island has}} {{accommodation}} {{for up to}} 5,500 visitors, while day-only visitors can number up to 20,000 at any one time. Rottnest Island Authority accommodation options include 291 villas, units and cottages which sleep 4, 6 or 8 people and which are self-catering. This style of accommodation is reasonably basic. Demand for accommodation is very high during the summer months. <b>Ballots</b> <b>are</b> no longer held and guests can book up to 18 months in advance.|$|E
50|$|Graham withdrew while {{voting for}} the third <b>ballot</b> <b>was</b> underway. McKenzie withdrew while {{voting for the}} fourth <b>ballot</b> <b>was</b> in process. Votes were not counted for either one, and the {{convention}} proceeded directly to the fifth ballot.|$|R
25|$|On April 1, {{the panel}} ordered that an {{additional}} 400 absentee <b>ballots</b> <b>be</b> examined. After examining the 400 ballots on April 6, the panel ordered that an additional 351 <b>ballots</b> <b>be</b> opened and counted. On April 7, the additional 351 <b>ballots</b> <b>were</b> opened and counted before the panel and a packed courtroom. Franken got an additional 198 votes, Coleman gained 111 votes, and other candidates received 42, increasing Franken's lead to 312 votes.|$|R
50|$|Seeing the {{collapse}} of the Stone-Goebel deal, Hardin supporters returned to their candidate on the second <b>ballot,</b> and they <b>were</b> joined by some outraged Stone supporters and even some of Goebel's delegates who were angered by his turnabout. The result of the second <b>ballot</b> <b>was</b> 395 for Stone, 359 for Hardin, and 330 for Goebel. Ten more <b>ballots</b> <b>were</b> taken before the convention adjourned for the day. The voting on the last <b>ballot</b> <b>was</b> 376 for Stone, 365 for Hardin, and 346 for Goebel.|$|R
25|$|Prior to the 2010 elections, {{voters have}} to write {{the names of the}} {{candidates}} next to the positions in which they are running. COMELEC-approved nicknames maybe used by the voters in writing the names. After the polling period ends, the Board of Election Inspectors (or the teachers manning the polling precinct) counts the ballots by hand. Once all the <b>ballots</b> <b>are</b> counted, the election returns will now be sent to the city or municipal Board of Canvassers, political parties and other groups.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, some Californian cities, e.g. Oakland and San Francisco, {{administer}} IRV {{elections on}} voting machines, with optical scanning machines recording preferences and software tallying the IRV algorithm {{as soon as}} <b>ballots</b> <b>are</b> tallied. Cary, North Carolina's pilot program in 2007 tallied first choices on optical scan equipment at the polls and then used a central hand-count for the IRV tally. Portland, Maine in 2011 used its usual voting machines to tally first choice at the polls, then a central scan with different equipment if an IRV tally was necessary.|$|E
25|$|Because {{the ballot}} marking is more complex, {{there can be}} an {{increase}} in spoiled ballots. In Australia, voters are required to write a number beside every candidate, and error rates can be five times higher than plurality voting elections Since Australia has compulsory voting, however, it is difficult to tell how many <b>ballots</b> <b>are</b> deliberately spoiled. Most jurisdictions with IRV do not require complete rankings and may use columns to indicate preference instead of numbers. In American elections with IRV, more than 99% of voters typically cast a valid ballot.|$|E

50|$|After {{the first}} <b>ballot</b> Silipo <b>was</b> {{eliminated}} and he endorsed Hampton. After the second <b>ballot,</b> Kormos <b>was</b> eliminated and he endorsed no one. On the final ballot, Hampton beat Lankin by 178 votes. 80 <b>ballots</b> <b>were</b> spoiled, likely from disgruntled Kormos supporters.|$|R

25|$|One {{round of}} balloting was to held the first evening. Then balloting was to {{continue}} {{until a new}} Pope was elected, with two ballots each morning and two each afternoon. The traditional procedure is that the <b>ballots</b> <b>are</b> burned, in times past reinforced by adding handfuls of dry or damp straw, to produce white smoke for a conclusive vote or black smoke for an inconclusive one. The straw {{had been replaced by}} chemically produced smoke. The ballot slips were to be burned at noon and 7pm Rome time (10:00 and 17:00 UTC) each day.|$|E
25|$|Most New Hampshire voters {{cast their}} votes on Diebold optical-scan systems, which read paper ballots. Some activists claimed to find {{evidence}} suggesting fraud, largely because results {{did not match}} pre-election polling for Obama and Clinton, and because of different levels of support between precincts where ballots were counted by hand and those where they were counted by machine. Most observers have concluded that discrepancies {{were the result of}} the fact that <b>ballots</b> <b>are</b> more likely to be hand-counted in small towns and machine-counted in cities and larger towns, explaining differences in candidate support.|$|E
25|$|The International Mister Bootblack (IMrBB) Competition runs {{throughout}} the IML weekend. Contestants {{are given a}} location in the IML Leather Market at which they perform bootblacking services. Weekend ticket package holders (as well as judges, contestants, and vendors) are each provided with a bootblack ballot which is redeemable for one shine by the bootblack of the voter's choice. Bootblacks are free to shine the boots of any person, regardless of whether that person has a ballot, although it is {{made clear that the}} <b>ballots</b> <b>are</b> the means by which the winner will be determined. Tipping is not required, but is quite common.|$|E
50|$|A {{total of}} 102 <b>ballots</b> <b>were</b> rejected.|$|R
50|$|<b>Ballots</b> <b>were</b> {{sent out}} begging from November.|$|R
50|$|Studies {{of the use}} of {{provisional}} {{ballots in}} the 2006 general election in the United States show that around 21% of provisional <b>ballots</b> <b>were</b> rejected, where the majority of rejected <b>ballots</b> <b>were</b> cast by registered voters and the majority of rejections were for reasons that were preventable.|$|R
25|$|Similar to STV, {{the vote}} {{counting}} procedure occurs in rounds. The {{first round of}} RRV is identical to range voting. All <b>ballots</b> <b>are</b> added with equal weight, and the candidate with the highest overall score is elected. In all subsequent rounds, ballots that support candidates who have already been elected are added with a reduced weight. Thus voters who support none of the winners in the early rounds are increasingly likely to elect one of their preferred candidates in a later round. The procedure {{has been shown to}} yield proportional outcomes if voters are loyal to distinct groups of candidates (e.g. political parties).|$|E
25|$|The House {{reserves}} roll-call {{votes for}} the most formal matters, as a roll call of all 435 representatives takes quite some time; normally, members vote by using an electronic device. In {{the case of a}} tie, the motion in question fails. Most votes in the House are done electronically, allowing members to vote yea or nay or present or open. Members insert a voting ID card and can change their votes during the last five minutes if they choose; in addition, paper <b>ballots</b> <b>are</b> used on some occasions—yea indicated by green and nay by red. One member can not cast a proxy vote for another. Congressional votes are recorded on an online database.|$|E
25|$|If no {{candidate}} {{for vice president}} receives an absolute majority of electoral votes, then the Senate must go into session to elect a vice president. The Senate is limited to choosing from the two candidates who received the most electoral votes for vice president. Normally this would mean two candidates, one less {{than the number of}} candidates available in the House vote. However, the text is written {{in such a way that}} all candidates with the most and second most electoral votes are eligible for the Senate election – this number could theoretically be larger than two. The Senate votes in the normal manner in this case (i.e., <b>ballots</b> <b>are</b> individually cast by each senator, not by state delegations). However, two-thirds of the senators must be present for voting to take place.|$|E

50|$|General {{elections}} {{were held in}} the Bahamas in June and July 1949, the last entirely non-partisan elections in the country. This was the second election in which the secret <b>ballot</b> <b>was</b> used in New Providence and the first in which the secret <b>ballot</b> <b>was</b> use for the Out Islands.|$|R
50|$|The Second Ballot Act 1908 {{provided}} for second or runoff ballots between {{the top two}} candidates where the top candidate did not get an absolute majority. The second <b>ballot</b> <b>was</b> held seven days after the first ballot except in ten large rural seats, where fourteen days were allowed. In 1908, 22 second <b>ballots</b> <b>were</b> held on 24 November and one (Bay of Plenty) on 1 December. At the 1911 election, all 30 second <b>ballots</b> <b>were</b> held seven days later. Two 1909 by-elections (in Rangitikei and Thames) also required second ballots.|$|R
