40|$|In recent years, {{increasing}} interest {{has been given}} to the rotordynamic fluid forces on impellers, from the view point of the shaft vibration analysis. Previous experimental and analytical results have shown that the fluid-induced forces and moments on closed type pump impellers contribute substantially to the potential destabilization of subsynchronous shaft vibrations. However, to date few papers are known of the rotordynamic fluid forces on open-type centrifugal impellers. This paper reports about experimental investigations of the rotordynamic fluid force moments on an open-type centrifugal compressor impeller in precessing motion. For open-type impellers, the variations of the tip clearance and the clearance between the <b>back</b> <b>shroud</b> and casing due to the precessing motion contribute to the rotordynamic fluid force moments. Experiments were conducted to measure the rotordynamic fluid force moments directly using the 4 -axis sensor, and the unsteady pressure on the front and back casing wall. In this paper, following results are obtained: (1) The fluid force moment becomes destabilizing in the region of negative precessing speed ratio (- 0. 3 <Ω/ω< 0), at the design flow rate; (2) At reduced flow rate, the destabilizing fluid force moments occurred at small positive precessing speed ratio (0. 2 <Ω/ω< 0. 4); (3) From the comparison of direct measured fluid force moments with those estimated from the unsteady pressure measured on the front and back casing walls, {{it was found that the}} destabilizing moments in the backward precession are mainly caused by the fluid forces on the front surface of the present impeller, where there is large clearance between the <b>back</b> <b>shroud</b> and casing...|$|E
30|$|Figures  10 and 11 {{indicate}} {{that in the}} same condition, a large difference in the radial distribution exists in the angles of 0 °, 90 °, 180 °, and 270 ° of the dimensionless tangential and radial velocities. The fluid in the flow core zone is in the circumference with the same radius, such that {{a significant change in}} the tangential and radial velocities occurs; however, near the volute, tangential and radial velocities are obviously subject to the constraint function of the main flow in the volute. Accordingly, the obtained value tends to be in agreement with an increase in radius. In the flow rate ranging from 0.6 Qsp to 1.2 Qsp, the larger the flow is, the more nearly equal the magnitude of dimensionless tangential and radial velocities with the four angles tends to become. Above the degree of 0 °, v̅_u increases with an increase in radius. The larger the flow becomes, the larger v̅_u is; however, v̅_r is smaller than zero. That is, the fluid flows from the volute to the sealing ring. Above the degree of 90 °, v̅_u decreases with an increase in radius, and the flow becomes large. v̅_u is small, but v̅_r is always smaller than zero, that is, the fluid flows from the volute to the sealing ring. Above the degree of 180 °, v̅_u is small with the change in the radius and flow rate. Meanwhile, v̅_u is always larger than 0.5, and v̅_r is always larger than zero. At the same radius, v̅_r becomes small with an increase in flow, that is, the fluid flows from the sealing ring to the volute. The larger the flow is, the smaller v̅_r is. Above the degree of 270 °, v̅_u increases in radius. The larger the flow rate is, the larger v̅_u is. However, v̅_r is always close to zero, that is, the fluid is approximately still along the radial direction. The above phenomena are {{due to the fact that}} the high-energy fluid in the impeller outlet flows into the <b>back</b> <b>shroud</b> cavity through the volute. The high-energy fluid in the impeller outlet continues to transfer energy to the low-energy fluid in the <b>back</b> <b>shroud</b> cavity with an inner radius. The cross-sectional area of the volute cross section with 90 ° angle direction is small, and the energy obtained in the inner radius increases rapidly. However, the radial pressure difference increases with increased dynamic energy. The cross-sectional area of the volute cross section with 0 ° angle direction is large, but the radial pressure difference is small. The fluid in the inner radius has less dynamic energy. Hence, the larger the cross-sectional area of the volute cross section is, the smaller the v̅_u of the fluid in the <b>back</b> <b>shroud</b> cavity is. The v̅_r radial distribution condition illustrates that the existence of 0 ° and 90 ° fluid in the core zone of the <b>back</b> <b>shroud</b> cavity signifies a radial flow from the volute to the sealing ring, that is, leakage flow exists. An increase in flow operation and in the main fluid flowing in the volute may exert a significant impact on the fluid flowing in the shroud cavity; therefore, the value of tangential and radial velocities tends to be in agreement. The main flow direction is also agreement with Figure  8.|$|E

40|$|Lecturepg. 1 For {{applications}} that involved fluids {{with a high}} rate of change of vapor pressure or low specific heat, it was found that there could be inadequate flow through the thrust bearing. This effect was compounded by the heat generation due to the eddy currents that occur in magnetic drive pumps with metallic shells. This paper describes a computer simulation to predict the flows, pressures, and temperatures in magnetic drive sealless pumps. The program has been developed using both theoretical and test work. The objective of the program was to provide reliable selection of magnetic drive pumps; this was accomplished by taking into account the effects of viscosity, vapor pressure, and other liquid properties on the local pressures in the pump. The goal of this program was thus to simulate a customer?s desired application of a particular fluid at an operating pressure, temperature, NPSH, and speed. The resulting conclusion would be whether the customer?s fluid and operating conditions were applicable for sealless pumps. Warnings are output through the graphical user interface of the program at the various points, should flashing occur using the particular fluid. The testing involved a wide range of pump sizes. Within each size, an extensive matrix involved running at different speeds, different cut impeller diameters, and from shutoff through runout condition. The units were tested with different shell configurations and different materials. These included polyetheretherketone (known as PEEK), Alloy C- 276, and a dual containment consisting of both materials. The design of the <b>back</b> <b>shroud</b> influences the magnitude of the hub factor. This is because the traditional affinity laws cannot be applied to the calculation of the axial load for semiopen impeller with a scalloped <b>back</b> <b>shroud,</b> pump out vanes, or pump out slots. One of the important findings was that the impeller hub factor, which is required for the computation of the axial load, changed as a function of speed and cut impeller diameter. It was also found that pump out vanes or pump out slots significantly enhanced the lubrication through the bearings and across magnets. Part of the verification involved performing tests with different bushing clearances and grooving configurations. These were analyzed empirically to confirm the coefficients that were obtained from experimental methods. In order to examine the possible operation of the pump when handling the user?s particular fluid, the flow is simulated in the program using a graphical user interface. A graphical output is given of all the pertinent locations in the systems, such as the thrust collar face or the gap between the driven magnets and the shell. The program currently calculates the pressure, flow, and temperature within the flowpath, along with the axial thrust, at five pump operating flow conditions expressed {{as a percentage of the}} best efficiency point...|$|E

30|$|In an {{impeller}} with balance holes of the double-sealing ring structure in a centrifugal pump, the hub plate crown of the impeller {{is divided into}} a shroud cavity and a hub cavity by the sealing ring. The calculation of round disk friction loss and axial thrust {{is closely related to}} the flow in the hub plate crown. Research on the shroud cavity, hub cavity, and sealing ring leakage has revealed the mechanism of the internal round disk friction loss and axial thrust of the centrifugal pump. Yang et al. [1] pointed out that disc friction loss calculated by the conventional method would produce more errors since it only considered the friction torque of the impeller at its periphery but ignored the major part at the hub plate crown and sealing ring. In the derivation of the axial thrust calculation formula, under the assumption that no fluid leakage flow exists in the hub plate crown and the fluid rotational angular velocity within the shroud cavity is half of the impeller rotational angular velocity, no rotating motion of the hub cavity fluid exists within the sealing ring [2 – 4]. Salvadori et al. [5] pointed out that the cavity flow behavior is a key parameter for the pressure field evaluation and then for the thrust calculation. Over the pump operating range the main contribution to the axial thrust is due to the impellers flow fields, the leakage flows through sealing rings and the pressure distribution that occurs inside the cavities between impeller shrouds and pump stationary walls. Test results on disk friction loss or axial thrust calculated in terms of the theoretical formula in fluid flow velocity in the shroud cavity did not match the results of practical tests [6]. To calculate the axial thrust of centrifugal pump with higher accuracy, Liu et al. [7, 8] developed a mathematical model of the shroud cavity liquid pressure on the design condition by simplifying the Navier–Stokes equations for the movement of cavity fluid. The results of liquid pressure test verified the reliability of the model. The study of Mu et al. [9] showed that the pump clearance leakage flow has significant influence on the flow field in the hub plate crown. The angular velocity of the fluid in the <b>back</b> <b>shroud</b> cavity is less than 0.5 times the angular velocity of impeller. Besides, compared with the experiment result, the axial thrust was found underestimated by the conventional formula. Research has shown that both cavities velocity field in the shroud and hub and the axial changing laws in the centrifugal pump are similar to the velocity field in the enclosed cylinder body [10 – 12]. That is, in the fluid flow velocity of the shroud and hub cavities, a turbulent boundary layer exists near the outer wall of the rotating impeller <b>back</b> <b>shroud.</b> Near the internal wall of the fixed motionless pump shroud, a flow core zone exists along the axial direction without significant changes between two boundary layers [13 – 15]. The flow core zone is the main region of fluid within the shroud and hub cavities. It occupies over two-thirds of the axial distance, whereby the fluid flow conditions within the shroud and hub cavities can be reflected.|$|E
40|$|An {{analysis}} is developed for a compressible bulk-flow {{model of the}} leakage path between a centrifugal compressor's impeller shroud and housing along {{the front and back}} side of the impeller. This is an extension of analysis performed first by Childs (1989) for a shrouded pump impeller and its housing considering an incompressible fluid, and then later by Cao (1993) using a compressible bulk flow model for the shroud of a cryogenic fluid pump. The bulk-flow model is used to develop a reaction force and moment model for the shroud of a centrifugal compressor by solving the derived governing equations and integrating the pressure and shear stress distribution. Validation is done by comparing the results to published measured moment coefficients by Yoshida et al. (1996). The comparison shows that the shroud casing clearance flow and the fluid force moment can be simulated by the bulk flow model fairly well. An Iwatsubo-based labyrinth seal code developed by Childs and Scharrer (1986) is used to calculate the rotordynamic coefficients developed by the labyrinth seals in the compressor. Tangential force and transverse moment components acting on the rotor are found to have a destabilizing influence on the rotor for a range of precession frequencies. Rotordynamic coefficients are derived for a single stage of a multistage centrifugal compressor, and a comparison is made to stability predictions using Wachel's coefficient using the XLTRC (rotordynamic FEA code). For the model employed, Wachel's model predicts a slightly lower onset speed of instability. The results also show that leakage that flows radially inwards on the <b>back</b> <b>shroud</b> has a greater destabilizing influence than leakage flow that is radially outwards. Seal rub conditions are simulated by increasing the clearance and simultaneously decreasing the tooth height, which increased the leakage and the swirl tothe eye seal inlet; and therefore reduced stability. Calculated results are provided for different seal clearances and tooth height, for seal and shroud forces and moments...|$|E
40|$|The {{ratio of}} rocket engine thrust to weight is a {{limiting}} constraint in placing more payload into orbit {{at a low}} cost. A key component of an engine's overall weight is the turbopump weight, Reducing the turbopump weight can result in significant engine weight reduction and hence, increased delivered payload. There are two main types of pumps: centrifugal and axial pumps. These types of pumps can be further sub-divided into those with shrouds and those without shrouds (unshrouded pumps). Centrifugal pumps can achieve the same pump discharge pressure as an axial pump and it requires fewer pump stages and lower pump weight than an axial pump. Also, with unshrouded centrifugal pumps (impeller), the number of stages and weight can be further reduced. However. there are several issues with regard to using an unshrouded impeller: 1) there is a pump performance penalty due to the front open face recirculation flow; 2) {{there is a potential}} pump axial thrust problem from the unbalanced front open face and the <b>back</b> <b>shroud</b> face; and, 3) since test data is very linu'ted for this configuration, there is uncertainty in the magnitude and phase of the rotordynamics forces due to the front impeller passage. The purpose of the paper is to discuss the design of an unshrouded impeller and to examine the design's hydrodynamic performance, axial thrust, and rotordynamics performance. The design methodology will also be discussed. This work will help provide some guidelines for unshrouded impeller design. In particular, the paper will discuss the design of three unshrouded impellers - one with 5 full and 5 partial blades (5 + 5). one with 6 + 6 blades and one with 8 + 8 blades. One of these designs will be selected for actual fabrication and flow test. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is used to help design and optimize the unshrouded impeller. The relative pump performance penalty is assessed by comparing the CFD results of the unshrouded impeller with the equivalent shrouded impeller for a particular design. Limited unshrouded - versus - shrouded impeller data from the J- 2 pump is used to anchor the CFD. Since no detailed impeller blade force data is available, axial thrust and rotordynamic force predictions are based on the CFD model. For the axial thrust, the impeller front flow passage axial force is integrated from the CFD results and compared to the equivalent shrouded impeller axial force. For the rotordynamics forces, the fluid reaction forces are computed from unsteady flow CFD results using a moving boundary method; the rotor- shaft is moved at several whirl-to-speed frequency ratios to extract the rotordynamics coefficients...|$|E

40|$|LectureBarrios (2007) {{conducted}} an experimental work in which was {{demonstrated that the}} two-phase stage performance of an electrical submersible pump (ESP) {{is related to the}} impeller gas and liquid flow pattern as mentioned by Murakami and Minemura (1974 a) for a volute-type centrifugal pump. Barrios (2007) proved that the stage head breakdown is a consequence of the gas pocket formation in the impeller channel as in a volute type pump. However, the gas pocket is described as unstable by Murakami and Minemura (1974 a) so a slug-flow-like pattern is observed in the impeller channel at the head breakdown conditions. Barrios (2007) observed that the gas segregates near the <b>back</b> <b>shroud</b> after the gas pocket formation so that it is stable and a gas segregated pattern is observed into the impeller. The discrepancy between both studies may imply that different mechanisms are acting in the gas pocket formation and its stability, which finally affects the stage performance. The objective of this research is to study the gas pocket behavior through the visualization of the flow pattern within an ESP impeller at different operating conditions and fluid properties. Therefore, a series of experimental tests has been conducted utilizing a two-stage prototype at rotational speeds between 600 rpm and 1000 rpm, 2 psig inlet pressure and volumetric gas fraction up to 10 percent. This prototype was built with a transparent acrylic casing to easily observe the flow pattern within the impeller, at the diffuser region and at the impeller inlet region. The gas and liquid flow patterns are observed from videos taken with high speed cameras. Two ports for gas injection have been disposed so the gas can be injected directly to the impeller inlet to get the single stage performance or through the first stage to obtain the multistage performance. A combination of different fluids such as distilled water and air, distilled water and sulfur hexafluoride, and air and a mixture of isopropanol (IPA) and water was utilized in this study. The videos show that the gas pocket is small and located near the front shroud at liquid flow rates higher than stage best efficiency point (BEP). It is formed and dragged out by liquid flowing over the gas pocket as mentioned by Murakami and Minemura (1974 a). The gas pocket becomes stable once it has grown through the channel cross section area when the liquid flow rate is reduced down to BEP. At this operating condition, the gas pocket reduces the upper flowing area and forces the liquid to flow in the remaining area between the gas pocket and the trailing channel face. Further reduction of liquid flow rate below the BEP causes the gas pocket to segregate forcing the liquid to flow underneath as Barrios (2007) mentioned. The gas pocket is formed even at zero head, which demonstrates that it is a consequence of bubble coalescence within impeller channel. The critical gas fraction for the gas pocket formation varies as a function of gas density while its stability and formation {{is a function of the}} surface tension and bubble size...|$|E

[...] The commandant came down the steps and knocked his head on the ground before Liu Gen, saying that he deserved to die and begging that his ancestors be pardoned and released. Liu ordered the five hundred troops to take out the prisoners and release them. As the carriage moved out, the wall opened back up; then, when it was outside, the wall closed again and the carriage was nowhere to be seen. Liu had also disappeared. (tr. Campany 2002: 240-242) Robert Ford Campany notes, [...] "The whistlers may be not the ghosts of the departed but the spirit-officials who are ushering them along. Esoteric techniques of whistling numbered among Daoist arts." ...|$|R
60|$|The two squadrons were intermingled, and it {{required}} some {{little time for}} Sir Gervaise to get {{a clear idea of}} the state of his own ships. Generally, it might be said that the vessels were scattering, the French sheering towards their own coast, while the English were principally coming by the wind on the larboard tack, or heading in towards England. The Cæsar and le Pluton were still foul of each other, though a rear-admiral's flag was flying at the mizzen of the first, while that which had so lately fluttered at the royal-mast-head of the other, had disappeared. The Achilles, Lord Morganic, was still among the French, more to leeward than any other English ship, without a single spar standing. Her ensigns were flying, notwithstanding, and the Thunderer and Dublin, both in tolerable order, were edging away rapidly to cover their crippled consort; though the nearest French vessels seemed more bent on getting out of the mêlée, and into their own line again, than on securing any advantage already obtained. Le Téméraire was in the same predicament as the Achilles as to spars, though much more injured in her hull, besides having thrice as many casualties. Her flag was down; the ship having fairly struck to the Warspite, whose boats were already alongside of her. Le Foudroyant, with quite one-third of her crew killed and wounded, was running off to leeward, with signals flying for her consorts to rally round her; but, within less than ten minutes after she became visible, her main and mizzen-masts both went. The Blenheim had lost all her top-masts, like the Plantagenet, and neither the Elizabeth nor the York had a mizzen-mast standing, although engaged but a very short time. Several lower yards were shot away, or so much injured as to compel the ships to shorten sail; this accident having occurred in both fleets. As for the damage done to the standing and running rigging, and to the sails, it is only necessary to say that <b>shrouds,</b> <b>back</b> and head-stays, braces, bowlines and lifts, were dangling in all directions, while the canvass that was open exhibited all sorts of rents, from that which had been torn like cloth in the shopman's hands, to the little eyelet holes of the canister and grape. It appeared, by the subsequent reports of the two parties, that, in this short but severe conflict, the slain and wounded of the English amounted to seven hundred and sixty-three, including officers; and that of the French, to one thousand four hundred and twelve. The disparity in this respect would probably have been greater against the latter, {{had it not been for}} the manner in which M. des Prez succeeded in doubling on his enemies.|$|R
