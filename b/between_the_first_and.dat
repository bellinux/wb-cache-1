5|$|<b>Between</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>and</b> second Tests, the Australian {{victory over}} Middlesex, whose batting could not cope with Spofforth, was their only win in four matches at Lord's. The Australians {{struggled}} in a drawn game against Sussex for whom George Wyatt and Henry Phillips both scored centuries. Spofforth with 14 wickets and George Bonnor with an innings of 68 in a low-scoring match put the Australians {{back on track}} when they easily defeated a strong Players XI at the Oval.|$|E

Using the Hounsfield unit (HU) equivalent pixel intensity value scale in the software program, density values were recorded {{in the center of}} the palate (Fig.  2 b).

5|$|In the English Civil War, Thomas Bushell held Lundy for King Charles I, {{rebuilding}} Marisco Castle and garrisoning {{the island}} {{at his own}} expense.

It was the last Royalist territory held <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>and</b> second civil wars. After receiving permission from Charles I, Bushell surrendered the island on 24 February 1647 to Richard Fiennes, representing General Fairfax. In 1656, the island was acquired by Lord Saye and Sele.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool {{had won the}} 1975–76 Football League <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>and</b> second legs of the UEFA Cup Final; a 3–1 {{victory over}} Wolverhampton Wanderers {{on the final day}} of the league season ensured they became champions.

Brugge had won the 1975–76 Belgian First Division; they won the competition by four points from second-place Anderlecht. Their success meant that they would also be competing in next season's European Cup as Belgian champions.|$|E

He did so despite being troubled by a split <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>and</b> second {{fingers of his}} left hand, caused by constant jarring from the bat as he played the ball. The wound often opened while he was batting, forcing him to undergo a minor operation which sidelined him from some matches {{in the latter part}} of the tour.|$|E

40|$|A current-driven signal {{conditioning}} system comprising a first terminal, a second terminal, a strain gauge, and an instrumentation amplifier is disclosed.
