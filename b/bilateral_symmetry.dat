5|$|With {{the decline}} in the empire's {{resources}} following losses in population and territory, domes in Byzantine architecture were used as part of more modest new buildings. The large-scale churches of Byzantium were, however, kept in good repair. The upper portion of the Church of Hagia Irene was thoroughly rebuilt after an earthquake in 740. The nave was re-covered with an elliptical domical vault hidden externally by a low cylinder on the roof, in place of the earlier barrel vaulted ceiling, and the original central dome from the Justinian era was replaced with one raised upon a high windowed drum. The barrel vaults supporting these two new domes were also extended out over the side aisles, creating cross-domed units. By bracing the dome with broad arches on all four sides, the cross-domed unit provided a more secure structural system. These units, with most domes raised on drums, became a standard element on a smaller scale in later Byzantine church architecture, and all domes built after the transitional period were braced with <b>bilateral</b> <b>symmetry.</b>|$|E

Mainly used to secure the containers from tampering and for owner's identification, these objects appeared during the 5 th millennium BC in Mesopotamia. Usually the seals were engraved with simple images, suitable to communicate an immediate information. Rotational symmetries are already displayed by the most ancient stamp seals, whose images reach a quasi-perfect symmetry in their small circular or ovoid spaces. <b>Bilateral</b> <b>symmetries</b> are quite common in Egyptian scarab seals...|$|R

25|$|Examination of {{dimerized}} and trimerized {{natural products}} {{has shown that}} an element of <b>bilateral</b> <b>symmetry</b> is often present. <b>Bilateral</b> <b>symmetry</b> refers to a molecule or system that contains a C2, Cs, or C2v point group identity. C2 symmetry tends {{to be much more}} abundant than other types of <b>bilateral</b> <b>symmetry.</b> This finding sheds light on how these compounds might be mechanistically created, as well as providing insight into the thermodynamic properties that make these compounds more favorable. Density functional theoretical (DFT), Hartree Fock, and semiempirical calculations also show some favorability for dimerization in natural products due to evolution of more energy per bond than the equivalent trimer or tetramer. This is proposed to be due to steric hindrance {{at the core of the}} molecule, as most natural products dimerize and trimerize in a head-to-head fashion rather than head-to-tail.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{present an}} {{efficient}} method for detecting planar <b>bilateral</b> <b>symmetries</b> under perspective projection. The method uses local affine frames (LAFs) constructed on maximally stable extremal regions {{or any other}} affine covariant regions detected in the image to dramatically improve the process of detecting symmetric objects under perspective distortion. In contrast to the previous work no Hough transform, is used. Instead, each symmetric pair of LAFs votes just once for a single axis of symmetry. The time complexity of the method is n log(n), where n {{is the number of}} LAFs, allowing a near real-time performance. The proposed method is robust to background clutter and partial occlusion and is capable of detecting an arbitrary number of symmetries in the image. ...|$|R

40|$|Pollen organ Telangiopsis sp., {{associated}} with but not attached to vegetative fronds, has been {{collected from the}} Upper Devonian (Famennian) Wutong Formation, Dongzhi County, Anhui Province, China. Fertile axes with terminal pollen organs are dichotomous for 2 - 4 times and may be proximally attached by fragmentary pinnules. Pollen organs are synangiate and borne {{on the top of}} a short stalk. Synangia are radial in symmetry and each consists of 4 - 8 elongate microsporangia fused at base. Microsporangia have a longitudinal dehiscence line and show a tapered apex. The associated stem is spiny and bears a vegetative frond which bifurcates once at the basalmost part. Frond rachises possess one order of pinna arranged alternately. Pinnules are borne alternately, planate, highly dissected, and equally dichotomous for 2 - 3 times. Comparisons among Late Devonian seed plants recognize several branching patterns in the fertile fronds/axes bearing terminal pollen organs. Telangiopsis sp. reinforces that the Late Devonian pollen organs are synangiate usually with basally fused microsporangia. It is suggested that the evolutionary divergence of radial and <b>bilateral</b> <b>symmetries</b> of pollen organs may have occurred in the Famennian, when the earliest seed plants evolved planate and sometimes laminate pinnules...|$|R

50|$|Symmetry is {{widespread}} in living things. Animals that move usually have <b>bilateral</b> or mirror <b>symmetry</b> as this favours movement.

25|$|How is the {{enormous}} {{diversity in the}} shape, color and sizes of flowers established? There is enormous variation in the developmental program in different plants. For example, monocots possess structures like lodicules and palea, that {{were believed to be}} analogous to the dicot petals and carpels respectively.It turns out that this is true, and the variation is due to slight changes in the MADS-box genes and their expression pattern in the monocots. Another example is that of the toad-flax, Linaria vulgaris, which has two kinds of flower symmetries: radial and <b>bilateral.</b> These <b>symmetries</b> are due to epigenetic changes in just one gene called CYCLOIDEA.|$|R
25|$|The Queen Anne {{style in}} Britain refers {{to either the}} English Baroque {{architectural}} style approximately {{of the reign of}} Queen Anne (reigned 1702–1714), or a revived form that was popular {{in the last quarter of}} the 19th century and the early decades of the 20th century (when it is also known as Queen Anne revival). In British architecture the term is mostly used of domestic buildings up to the size of a manor house, and usually designed elegantly but simply by local builders or architects, rather than the grand palaces of noble magnates.

25|$|Despite Tolstoj’s great age and its embayment by {{the ancient}} inter- crater plains, it retains an {{extensive}} and remarkably well preserved, radially lineated ejecta blanket around two-thirds of its circumference. The ejecta tends to be blocky and only weakly lineated between {{the inner and outer}} rings. Radial lineations with a slight swirly pattern are best seen on the southwest side of Tolstoj. The unusual rectilinear map pattern of the ejecta suggests: (1) control of the ejecta pattern by prebasin structures, (2) preferential burial along structural trends of an originally symmetrical ejecta blanket by the intercrater plains material, or (3) formation of Tolstoj by an oblique impact from the northwest that produced an ejecta blanket with <b>bilateral</b> <b>symmetry</b> and little or no deposition uprange. Analysis of stereo- photography of Tolstoj ejecta northeast of the crater suggests that this deposit has been upwarped to a higher elevation relative to the surrounding plains.|$|E
25|$|Several animal phyla are {{recognized}} for {{their lack of}} <b>bilateral</b> <b>symmetry,</b> and {{are thought to have}} diverged from other animals early in evolution. Among these, the sponges (Porifera) were long thought to have diverged first, representing the oldest animal phylum. They lack the complex organization found in most other phyla. Their cells are differentiated, but in most cases not organized into distinct tissues. Sponges typically feed by drawing in water through pores. However, a series of phylogenomic studies from 2008–2015 have found support for Ctenophora, or comb jellies, as the basal lineage of animals. This result has been controversial, since it would imply that sponges may not be so primitive, but may instead be secondarily simplified. Other researchers have argued that the placement of Ctenophora as the earliest-diverging animal phylum is a statistical anomaly caused by the high rate of evolution in ctenophore genomes.|$|E

25|$|The exact {{mechanism}} of transferring silica {{absorbed by the}} diatom to the cell wall is unknown, though research is still being undertaken. Much of the sequencing of diatom genes comes from {{the search for the}} {{mechanism of}} silica uptake and deposition in nano-scale patterns in the frustule. The most success in this area has come from two species, Thalassiosira pseudonana, which has become the model species, as the whole genome was sequenced and methods for genetic control were established, and Cylindrotheca fusiformis, in which the important silica deposition proteins silaffins were first discovered. Silaffins, sets of polycationic peptides, were found in C. fusiformis cell walls and can generate intricate silica structures. These structures demonstrated pores of sizes characteristic to diatom patterns1. When T. pseudonana underwent genome analysis it was found that it encoded a urea cycle, including a higher number of polyamines than most genomes, as well as three distinct silica transport genes. In a phylogenetic study on silica transport genes from 8 diverse groups of diatoms, silica transport was found to generally group with species. This study also found structural differences between the silica transporters of pennate (<b>bilateral</b> <b>symmetry)</b> and centric (radial symmetry) diatoms. The sequences compared in this study were used to create a diverse background in order to identify residues that differentiate function in the silica deposition process. Additionally, the same study found that a number of the regions were conserved within species, likely the base structure of silica transport.|$|E

40|$|SYNOPSIS. Much {{attention}} has been paid to the role of developmental information in estimating phylogenetic relationships and, more recently, to the use of phylog-enies in understanding the evolution of development. At the moment, however, we lack a sufficiently general theory connecting phylogenetic patterns of character evolution to properties of developmental systems. Here we outline a simple model relating homoplasy to the rate of character change and the number of evolvable states, both of which may reflect developmental constraints. Given a particular rate of character change, the fewer the evolvable states the more homoplasy is expected, and vice versa. The repeated evolution of a limited number of forms of <b>bilateral</b> flower <b>symmetry</b> may reflect constraints imposed by overall flower ori-entation and underlying mechanisms of differentiation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Pessoa et al. (1998 a) underexposed {{the broad}} and rich variety of stimuli in the amodal {{completion}} domain. The disambiguation of oc-cluded shapes depends on very specific figural properties. Elaborations on such disambiguations of rich and complex stimuli, {{tied up with}} a visuo-cognitive origin of amodal completion, further position Pessoa et al. ’s con-siderations on neural filling-in and the personal-subpersonal distinction. Pessoa et al. (1998 a) have written an impressive paper on percep-tual completion, comprising a wide scope of phenomena with di-verse phenomenological qualities. Amodal completion certainly belongs to the weakest of the discussed completion phenomena. Every observer can witness that the phenomenological presence of amodal contour completions is not as compelling as, for example, blind spot filling-in, neon color spreading, or even the perception of illusory contours. Nevertheless, convincing psychophysical data exist on the relevance of amodal contour completions as well. Much of the research in the domain {{is concerned with the}} disam-biguation of occluded shapes. That is, while in fact an infinitive number of different completions are possible for each and every visual pattern, only a few of them are plausible. Although Pessoa et al. briefly mentioned that local and global figural properties may influence completion, the richness of the domain, the diversity of completions, and the vision-versus-cognition dilemma (typical of this domain), are underexposed and not related to their own con-cepts (e. g., the personal-subpersonal distinction). This is a missed opportunity. Whereas in local approaches, completion depends on specific local configurations and proceeds by way of curved or linear in-terpolation between contour ends, in global approaches specific overall shape regularities (like <b>bilateral</b> <b>symmetries)</b> determine completion. 1 It is important to note here that local and global strategies may converge to the same shape but may also diverge to different shapes. The relevance of and competition between, both types of completions have been investigated by, for example...|$|R
