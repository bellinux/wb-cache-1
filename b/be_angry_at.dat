5|$|The film's {{budget was}} so small that during the 32 days of {{shooting}} in Eugene, mostly in November, Landis had no trailer or office and could not watch dailies for three weeks. His wife Deborah Nadoolman purchased most of the costumes at local thrift stores, and she and Judy Belushi made the party togas. Landis and Bruce McGill staged a scene for reporters visiting the set where the director pretended to <b>be</b> <b>angry</b> <b>at</b> the actor for being difficult on the set. Landis grabbed a breakaway pitcher and smashed it over McGill's head. He {{fell to the ground}} and pretended to be unconscious. The reporters were completely fooled, and when Landis asked McGill to get up, he refused to move.|$|E

25|$|In 1999, the Liberal {{strategy}} {{had been}} to polarize the electorate between Mike Harris and Dalton McGuinty. They purposely put out a platform that was devoid of ideas, to ensure the election was about the Tory record, and not the Liberal agenda. To an extent, they succeeded. Support for the NDP collapsed from 21% to just 13%, while the Liberals climbed 9%. However, while they almost cornered the market of those angry at the Tories, they could not convince enough people to <b>be</b> <b>angry</b> <b>at</b> the Tories to win.|$|E

When Jiang Gan shows up, Zhou Yu {{pretends to}} <b>be</b> <b>angry</b> <b>at</b> him for {{stealing}} the letter earlier and orders his men to deny Jiang entry into his camp. Jiang Gan wanders around and meets Pang Tong in a nearby temple by chance, without knowing that Pang has been expecting him. He escapes and brings Pang Tong back with him to meet Cao Cao. Pang Tong gives fake advice to Cao Cao by suggesting that he uses metal chains to link his warships together to reduce the chances of his troops falling seasick. The chained-linked ships later become vulnerable to the fire attack during the Battle of Red Cliffs.|$|E
25|$|Pat disowned his {{entertainer}} father, Simon Reynolds, {{when the}} latter {{came out as}} a homosexual. Simon has made efforts to reconcile with his son, which Pat has disgustedly repulsed. The entire topic of his father is off limits to Pat, suggesting repression issues. The comic has hinted at this complexity of his character for some time. In 2006, his own latent homosexuality was forced {{out into the open}} by the magical Mexican realism camera. Apparently both Pat and his father magically became homosexual due to the curse of Gladdington castle, wherein an ancestor of theirs was cursed such that all of his sons and their sons thereafter would become homosexual at the age of 26. Pat has since become much more comfortable about his homosexuality, using perceived persecution as just another reason to <b>be</b> <b>angry</b> <b>at</b> the world, and has been dating Rod Huggins, a gay porn star.|$|E

500|$|After House violates {{one of the}} {{conditions}} set by Cuddy, Amber informs the team of House's ruse of faking syphilis. This discovery leads Kutner to suspect that Jeff's actual, positive syphilis result might really {{be the result of}} a parasite called Chagas' disease, which he contracted while working in the jungles of Costa Rica years ago. The diagnosis is confirmed: the parasite embedded itself in Jeff's brain during his stay in the country, thus causing the shift in his personality and giving him the inability to <b>be</b> <b>angry.</b> <b>At</b> the end of the episode the only evident change is that the patient says he now does not like ketchup, although he does wonder aloud to his wife, [...] "I wonder what else I don't like," [...] which appears to make her anxious.|$|E
500|$|Further {{allegations}} of homophobic content arose when a easter egg {{was discovered in}} the game's opening tutorial level. If the player remains idle {{for a brief period}} of time, they are able to hear one soldier ask another soldier about his sexuality, and then remark [...] "don't ask, don't tell". This easter egg references the United States policy [...] "Don't ask, don't tell", which prevented openly gay people from serving in the United States Armed Forces. Unlike the [...] "Fight Against Grenade Spam" [...] video, few journalists commented on the easter egg. Jim Sterling of Destructoid felt that the easter egg was [...] "too silly/stupid" [...] for him to <b>be</b> <b>angry</b> <b>at,</b> while James Sherwood of The Register commented that people were trying to generate controversy over unimportant dialogue. Lyle Masaki of Logo TV's NewNowNext.com deemed the easter egg to be homophobic, but not representative of the game as a whole.|$|E
500|$|SFScope {{contributor}} Sarah Stegall liked Frank's final conversation concerning Fauxlivia's pregnancy, {{praising the}} plot twist's potential to [...] "make for some interesting drama, perhaps even allowing {{the show to}} get past the inevitable mawkishness of most pregnancy stories." [...] However, there was some negative fan feedback concerning the pregnancy storyline. In reaction to this, Jeff Pinkner commented, [...] "Our interpretation of it is that people desperately want to see Olivia and Peter together. And that Fauxlivia having a baby makes Olivia’s life that much harder and people are angry because of that. Anything that makes Olivia’s life harder, people seem to <b>be</b> <b>angry</b> <b>at.</b> Olivia is a hero, she will conquer all. She’ll deal." [...] After [...] "Immortality" [...] aired, Joshua Jackson expressed sympathy for fans of the Olivia-Peter relationship, commenting that they [...] "have been taken for quite a ride.

2500|$|Some small protests {{occurred}} {{during the first week}} of the conference. A much larger march was held in Copenhagen on 12 December calling for a global agreement on climate. Between 40,000 and 100,000 people attended. 968 protesters were detained at the event, including 19 who were arrested for carrying pocket knives and wearing masks during the demonstration. Of these all but 13 were released without charge. One police officer was injured by a rock and a protester was injured by fireworks. Some protestors were kettled by police and detained for several hours without access to food, water or toilets, before being arrested and taken to a holding facility on coaches. Protestors were said to <b>be</b> <b>angry</b> <b>at</b> the use of what they considered [...] "heavy-handed" [...] police tactics. Activists claimed that the police used wire-taps, undercover officers and pepper spray on people who had been detained. The police said the measures were necessary to deal with organisations such as Never Trust A COP which stated on its website that it would [...] "consciously attack the structures supporting the COP15". Per Larsen, the chief coordinating officer for the Copenhagen police force told The New York Times that it was [...] "surely the biggest police action we have ever had in Danish history." ...|$|E
2500|$|Guo's and Li Jilin's death sent {{fear and}} anger {{throughout}} the Later Tang army ranks. [...] The situation was aggravated {{by the fact}} that the central Later Tang territory was going through a terrible famine at the time, and, with Empress Liu unwilling to release the funds for famine relief, many soldiers' families starved, further causing them to <b>be</b> <b>angry</b> <b>at</b> the emperor and empress. [...] These resentment spawned a number of revolts, the most serious of which were one led by Kang Yanxiao in the Shu lands (as he was one of the generals under Guo in the Former Shu campaign), and one by the soldiers at Yedu (鄴都, i.e., Xingtang). [...] Kang's rebellion was quickly put down by Ren Huan, but the imperial troops under Li Shaorong had difficulty putting down the Yedu rebellion, and it threatened to become even more problematic. [...] When Li Cunxu subsequently sent Li Siyuan to take over the operations, Li Siyuan's own soldiers mutinied and forced him to join the Yedu mutineers. [...] Li Siyuan tried to send messengers to Li Cunxu to explain he had not intended to rebel, but his messengers were intercepted by Li Shaorong. [...] He decided to attack south and occupy Bian Prefecture (汴州, i.e., formerly Daliang), and Li Cunxu mobilized an army to try to intercept him. [...] Bian Prefecture's defender Kong Xun decided to play both sides, and sent emissaries to both of them, welcoming them. [...] When Li Siyuan reached Bian first, Kong welcomed him in, and rejected Li Cunxu. [...] Hearing this, Li Cunxu dejectedly returned to Luoyang. [...] After he returned to Luoyang, the officer Guo Congqian (郭從謙) led a mutiny, and Li Cunxu tried to fight the mutineers. [...] He suffered an arrow wound in the battle and shortly after died from it. [...] Li Siyuan shortly thereafter arrived at Luoyang and, after initially claiming only the title of regent, eventually took the throne. [...] Empress Liu fled Luoyang but was tracked down by Li Siyuan's emissaries and ordered to kill herself. [...] Li Jiji tried to head to Luoyang to contest Li Siyuan's succession, but on the way, his soldiers deserted him, and he committed suicide. Li Cunxu's younger sons later became monks and fled to Meng Zhixiang, who would treat them as his own sons.|$|E
