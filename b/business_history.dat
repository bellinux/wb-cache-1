25|$|The next year, Durant {{started the}} Chevrolet Motor Car Company in the U.S., and in Canada in 1915, and through this, he {{secretly}} purchased a controlling interest in GM. Durant took back {{control of the}} company after {{one of the most dramatic}} proxy wars in American <b>business</b> <b>history.</b> Durant then reorganized General Motors Company into General Motors Corporation in 1916, merging Chevrolet with GM and merging General Motors of Canada Limited as an ally in 1918. Shortly thereafter, he again lost control, this time for good, after the new vehicle market collapsed. Alfred P. Sloan was picked to take charge of the corporation, and led it to its post-war global dominance when the seven manufacturing facilities operated by Chevrolet before GM acquired the company began to contribute to GM operations. These facilities were added to the individual factories that were exclusive to Cadillac, Buick, Oldsmobile, Oakland, and other companies acquired by GM. This unprecedented growth of GM would last into the early 1980s, when it employed 349,000 workers and operated 150 assembly plants.|$|E
