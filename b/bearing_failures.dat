40|$|This paper {{experimentally}} investigates damage mechanisms {{which is}} closely related with the <b>bearing</b> <b>failure</b> in bolted joints of CFRP laminates and proposes a finite element model to reproduce those damage mechanisms. First, the damage was observed in the <b>bearing</b> <b>failure</b> of bolted joints, and the main factor of the large stiffness degradation in <b>bearing</b> <b>failure</b> is the fiber kinking damage. In addition, the fiber kinking is suppressed by the bolt clamping, which increases the bearing strength of bolted joints. Then, three-dimensional finite element model was developed for addressing the <b>bearing</b> <b>failure</b> in bolted joints based on the experimental observation. In this model, the initiation and the propagation of the fiber kinking damage which {{plays an important role}} in the <b>bearing</b> <b>failure</b> of bolted joints were reproduced and the stress failure criteria were investigated. The variation of the load at the kinking onset due to the bolt clamping was simulated and consequently the load history during the evolution of the fiber kinking damage was simulated...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: One of {{the basic}} failure modes of bolted {{composite}} laminates is bearing fail-ure. This mode of failure occurs in the material immediately adjacent to the contact points of bolt and laminate, and is caused primarily by compressive stresses acting on the hole boundary. The results of an experimental program which measured the bearing strengths of {{two different types of}} graphite/epoxy specimens are presented. The influence on the bearing strength of several important parameters including lateral constraint and ply orien-tation are shown. Strains were measured {{in the vicinity of the}} loaded hole to quantify the extent of <b>bearing</b> <b>failure.</b> A new approach to predicting <b>bearing</b> <b>failure</b> is outlined. The Delamination Buckling Model (DBM) assumes that ply buckling following delaminations is a major feature of <b>bearing</b> <b>failure.</b> Quantitatively good agreement was found between ex-periment and model results...|$|R

The brinell marks will often appear in evenly spaced patterns along the bearing races, resembling the primary elements of the bearing, such as rows of indented lines for needle or roller bearings or rounded indentations in ball bearings. It is a common cause of roller <b>bearing</b> <b>failures,</b> and loss of preload in bolted joints when a hardened washer is not used. For example, brinelling occurs in casters when the ball bearings within the swivel head produce grooves in the hard cap, thus degrading performance by increasing the required swivel force.|$|E

The relationships between the tilt bearing capacity and each of the three geometric variables are investigated through laboratory tests of 92 specimens composed of G 450 sheet steels. The sheet thicknesses range from 1. 5 to 3. 0 mm, and for each thickness the sheet widths range from 50 to 120 mm. 12 -mm and 16 -mm bolts are used with hole clearances of 2 mm and 1 mm.

The rotor main bearing can also fail due to various problems like low oil pressure, and a lower viscosity oil was recommended in the North American market. The oil pan has a common problem of being crushed or bent during maintenance and can decrease the oil pickup tube flow causing main <b>bearing</b> <b>failures</b> as well. Modified Renesis engines can experience side seal failures due to a combination of exhaust back pressure and higher exhaust temperature. Overheating and heat expansion of housings can cause seals in the rotary engine to fail as well.

50|$|The first {{production}} Panther {{tanks were}} plagued with mechanical problems. The engine was dangerously prone to overheating and suffered from connecting rod or <b>bearing</b> <b>failures.</b> Petrol leaks from the fuel pump or carburettor, {{as well as}} motor oil leaks from gaskets, produced fires in the engine compartment; {{which resulted in the}} total writeoff of three Panthers due to fires. Transmission and final drive breakdowns were the most common and difficult to repair. A large list of other problems were detected in these early Panthers, and so from April through May 1943 all Panthers were shipped to Falkensee and Nürnberg for a major rebuilding program. This did not correct all of the problems, so a second program was started at Grafenwoehr and Erlangen in June 1943. Reliability improved with the Ausf. A and later G of the Panther, with availability rates going from an average of 37% by end of 1943 to an average of 54% in 1944. By mid-1944, the Panther was at its peak performance and widely regarded as the most formidable tank on the battlefield.|$|E

At frequencies above 6 GHz or in fast digital circuits, tin whiskers can act like miniature antennas, affecting the circuit impedance and causing reflections. In computer disk drives they can break off and cause head crashes or <b>bearing</b> <b>failures.</b> Tin whiskers often cause failures in relays, and have been found upon examination of failed relays in nuclear power facilities. Pacemakers have been recalled due to tin whiskers. Research has also identified a particular failure mode for tin whiskers in vacuum (such as in space), where in high-power components a short-circuiting tin whisker is ionized into a plasma that is capable of conducting hundreds of amperes of current, massively increasing the damaging effect of the short circuit. [...] The possible increase in the use of pure tin in electronics due to the RoHS directive drove JEDEC and IPC to release a tin whisker acceptance testing standard and mitigation practices guideline intended to help manufacturers reduce the risk of tin whiskers in lead-free products.|$|E

40|$|To {{design a}} bolted joint, the {{transition}} bearing stress and maximumbearing stress {{have to be}} regarded. Transition bearing stress is thebearing stress where <b>bearing</b> <b>failure</b> begins and maximum bearing stressis where the joint goes to total failure. A method for studying rotationin a bolted joint has been developed using an optical instrument calledDigital Speckle Photography, DSP, which is a non-contact extensometerusing digital cameras, together with a load frame. The data from DSPsystem is transformed and analyzed to get rotations for different partsof the joint. Thinner joints give higher values on transition bearingstress, higher maximum bearing stress and higher maximum bolt rotation,than thicker joints. Bolt torque has a big impact and higher torquegives the same positive results as thinner joints. Increased secondarybending makes the joint more resistant to <b>bearing</b> <b>failure,</b> whichincreases the transition <b>bearing</b> <b>failure</b> stress, maximum <b>bearing</b> failurestress and maximum bolt rotation. There is a relationship between thecurve slope in a bearing stress versus bolt rotation figure and thetransition bearing stress.
