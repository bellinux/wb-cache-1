5|$|After World War II, the US Navy {{sought to}} acquire a nuclear strike capability, and the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Air, Rear Admiral Arthur W. Radford wanted them to operate from {{aircraft}} carriers. There were practical problems with this. Nuclear weapons at that time were bulky and required a large aircraft to carry them. After Operation Crossroads, Radford asked Hayward if the Navy had such an aircraft, and Hayward suggested modifying the Lockheed P2V Neptune for carrier operations using jet-assisted takeoff (JATO) rocket boosters. It was an interim solution, as it a could not carry a Fat Man, <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>the</b> smaller Little Boy bomb; {{it could only be}} operated by the large Midway class aircraft carriers, which still had to be modified for the task; and initially had no tailhook, so it was unable to land on a carrier, and a mission would have to end with it either landing at a land base or ditching at sea.|$|E
5|$|Ambrose Dudley {{was imprisoned}} in the Tower of London {{with his father}} and his four brothers. All were attainted and {{condemned}} to death, <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>the</b> Duke and Guildford Dudley, the second youngest brother, were executed. After the natural death of John, the eldest brother, in October 1554, Ambrose Dudley was the family's heir; he remained longest in the Tower, being released late in 1554 after a plea by his wife, Lady Tailboys. On the whole, the brothers' release was brought about by their mother and their brother-in-law Henry Sidney, who successfully lobbied the Spanish nobles around England's new co-ruler and king consort, Philip of Spain. Out of prison, in December 1554 or January 1555, Ambrose and Robert Dudley took part in one of several tournaments held by Philip to celebrate Anglo-Spanish friendship.|$|E

5|$|At Kelmscott Press the {{perfection}} of book-making was under his constant supervision and practical assistance. It was his ambition to produce a perfect work to restore all the beauty of illuminated lettering, richness of gilding and grace of binding that {{used to make a}} volume the treasure of a king. His efforts were constantly directed towards giving the world at least one book that exceeded anything that had ever appeared. Morris designed his type after the best examples of early printers, what he called his “golden type” which he copied after Jenson, Parautz, Coburger and others. With this in mind, Morris took equal care on the choice of his paper which he adapted to his subject with the same care that governed his selection of material for binding. As a result, few <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>the</b> wealthy could purchase his lavish works, mainly due to how intrinsic his work was. However, he realized that creating works in the manner of the middle ages was difficult in a profit-grinding society.|$|E
5|$|Bergen Street was {{originally}} designed as an express station, <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>the</b> upper level {{is currently in}} service; the lower level is neither in regular service nor usable due to its deteriorated condition. The lower level of the station was used when express service was provided on the Culver Line between 1968 and 1976. Express service was eliminated due {{to the loss of}} direct local service along the line to Manhattan. The express platforms were permanently removed from service during the 1990s, and due to a fire in 1999 the relay room was damaged, making the express tracks unusable. The relay room was rebuilt in 2008, and after repairs were done on the line, the implementation of express service become feasible. In 2016, it was announced that the MTA was considering having express service brought back to the line. However, unlike the earlier express service, express trains will skip this station due to the high cost of rebuilding it, thus making the station a local stop.|$|E
5|$|Bismarck {{left the}} Kiel Fjord {{on the morning}} of 28 September 1940 heading east. After an uneventful voyage through rough seas, Bismarck reached Gotenhafen (now Gdynia) the next day. Here Bismarck {{conducted}} a number of sea trials in the relative safety of the Bay of Danzig (now Gdańsk Bay). By 30 November 1940, Lindemann had set a number of tests for the crew, which they passed easily. During high speed trials, Bismarck reached a top speed of , exceeding the design speed. However, one weakness quickly became apparent: without using the rudders <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>the</b> screws, Bismarck was almost impossible to steer.|$|E
