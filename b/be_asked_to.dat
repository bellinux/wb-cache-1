5|$|Brown's {{comments}} at Duke {{and subsequent}} reprimand by President Gerald Ford were {{reported on the}} front page of The Washington Post on 13 and 14 November 1974. There was speculation that Brown would <b>be</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> resign, or at least not be nominated for a second two-year term; but he was renominated and went on to serve under the new president, Jimmy Carter.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea that}} McGarty play a child groomed for sex {{was put to}} the actress on 9 January 2008. Santer has stated that, had McGarty or her parents objected to the storyline, {{they would not have}} gone ahead with it. In the event, McGarty's parents merely {{requested}} that their daughter not <b>be</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> publicise the role, and the actress began filming her first scenes on 14 January 2008.|$|E

5000|$|This {{exercise}} <b>asks</b> {{the user}} <b>to</b> occupy several [...] "chairs" [...] {{during the course}} of the practice. Initially, they <b>are</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> occupy the chair of the self-critic, and to express their feelings of self-criticism. They <b>are</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> analyze this criticism and make note of its defining characteristics. Then, the user <b>is</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> take the chair of their criticized self, and to imagine verbally responding to their inner critic. Subsequently, the user is prompted to conduct a dialogue between these two aspects of the self, the criticizer and the criticized. Following this, the user <b>is</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> imagine themself as a compassionate observer of this dialogue, and finally the user <b>is</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> reflect upon the experience.|$|R
40|$|Students <b>are</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> {{classify}} sentences from {{an essay}} by their functioning within a written article. Then they <b>are</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> construct the article {{and see how}} the sentences function compared to their original clasifications. Finally, they <b>are</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> compare their constructed essay to one presumed to have been written by another college student...|$|R
5|$|The patient's own {{description}} {{is the best}} measure of pain; they will usually <b>be</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> estimate intensity {{on a scale of}} 0–10 (with 0 being no pain and 10 being the worst pain they have ever felt). Some patients, however, may be unable to give verbal feedback about their pain. In these cases you must rely on physiological indicators such as facial expressions, body movements, and vocalizations such as moaning.|$|E
5|$|Touching the trigger, {{pointing}} in different than appointed safe direction {{or trying to}} field strip loaded gun (dummy round is used) results in the applicant failing the exam. Depending on the categories of licenses sought, applicants may <b>be</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> show their ability of safe manipulation on multiple firearms (typically CZ 75 and/or CZ 82 pistol, bolt-action CZ 452 rifle and a double-barreled shotgun).|$|E
5|$|Baldwin {{called a}} general {{election}} for 30 May 1929. Chamberlain expected the Conservatives to easily triumph, and {{thought he would be}} moved either to the Exchequer or <b>be</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> serve at the Colonial Office, where Joseph Chamberlain had made his mark. Chamberlain easily won in Edgbaston, which he represented {{for the rest of his}} life, but the general election resulted in a hung parliament, with Labour holding the most seats. Baldwin and his Government resigned, and Labour leader Ramsay MacDonald took office.|$|E
50|$|In 1867, Kuyper <b>was</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> become {{minister}} for the parish in Utrecht {{and he left}} Beesd. In 1870 he <b>was</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> come to Amsterdam. In 1871 he began to write for the De Heraut (The Herald).|$|R

40|$|Destination {{memory is}} the ability to {{remember}} the receiver of transmitted information. By means of a destination memory directed forgetting task, we investigated whether participants with Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) were able to suppress irrelevant information in destination memory. Twenty-six AD participants and 30 healthy elderly subjects <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> tell 10 different proverbs to 10 different celebrities (List 1). Afterwards, half of the participants were instructed to forget the destinations (i. e., the celebrities) whereas the other half <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> keep them in mind. After telling 10 other proverbs to 10 other celebrities (List 2), participants <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> read numbers aloud. Subsequently, all the participants <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> remember the destinations of List 1 and List 2, regardless of the forget or remember instructions. The results show similar destination memory in AD participants who <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> forget the destinations of List 1 and those who <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> retain them. These findings are attributed to inhibitory deficits, by which AD participants have difficulties to suppress irrelevant information in destination memory...|$|R
5|$|Following the {{commercial}} and critical failure of Pinkerton (1996), Weezer frontman Rivers Cuomo placed the band on hiatus. He returned to Harvard University to finish his studies, but eventually dropped out to focus on songwriting. During this time, Cuomo played with a different group of musicians in the band Homie, based in Boston. One {{of the members of}} Homie was Mikey Welsh, a bass player who would eventually <b>be</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> replace Matt Sharp in Weezer.|$|E
5|$|Further {{appointments}} followed. Stainer {{became an}} honorary {{fellow of the}} Royal Academy of Music in 1877 and an examiner for the Doctor of Music degree at Cambridge and London Universities. He accepted the post of Musical Director of the Madrigal Society of London. He was particularly honoured to <b>be</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> be a juror at the French Exhibition in Paris in 1878 and in 1880 was an adjudicator at the Welsh Eisteddfod at Caernarvon. He was made Chevalier of the Legion of Honour in 1879.|$|E
5|$|Questions {{were asked}} in the House of Commons {{about the cost of}} {{policing}} the statue, which required six constables a day at a cost of £700 a year. London's police commissioner wrote to Battersea Council to ask that they contribute to it. Councillor John Archer, later Mayor of Battersea and the first black mayor in London, told the Daily Mail that he was amazed by the request, considering Battersea was already paying £22,000 a year in police rates. The Canine Defence League wondered whether, if Battersea were to organize raids on laboratories, the laboratories would <b>be</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> pay the policing costs themselves.|$|E

5|$|At this time, private loyalty-review {{boards and}} anti-communist {{investigators}} {{began to appear}} to fill a growing demand among certain industries to certify that their employees were above reproach. Companies that {{were concerned about the}} sensitivity of their business, or who, like the entertainment industry, felt particularly vulnerable to public opinion made use of these private services. For a fee, these teams would investigate employees and question them about their politics and affiliations. At such hearings, the subject would usually not have a right to the presence of an attorney, and as with HUAC, the interviewee might <b>be</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> defend himself against accusations without being allowed to cross-examine the accuser. These agencies would keep cross-referenced lists of leftist organizations, publications, rallies, charities and the like, as well as lists of individuals who were known or suspected communists. Books such as Red Channels and newsletters such as Counterattack and Confidential Information were published to keep track of communist and leftist organizations and individuals. Insofar as the various blacklists of McCarthyism were actual physical lists, they were created and maintained by these private organizations.|$|E
5|$|In the Hanzhong state, sin and {{criminal}} behavior were not differentiated. In order to eliminate sin, an adherent {{first had to}} acknowledge his crime, and then {{would have to go}} to a 'quiet room' to meditate. There, he would have to write three confessions which would be offered to the Lord of Heaven, the Lord of Earth and the Lord of Water. For public crimes, an accused would be pardoned three times for his actions and then be sentenced. A sentence depended on the type of crime, but always involved community service. For a minor crime, the sentence was usually to repair a road. A repeat offender might <b>be</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> donate building materials to improve local buildings. Other laws banned alcohol and prohibited the killing of animals during the spring and summer.|$|E
5|$|The {{series is}} {{distinguished}} by its art style, which emulates manga and anime. According to Baba, the character designs are created once the main character's story, personality, and environment {{are determined by}} the rest of the production team. Beyond that, the artist is allowed to use their imagination, though they can <b>be</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> alter things like costume details, and facial expressions. One of the main designers for the series is manga artist Kōsuke Fujishima. He was first brought in to design the characters for Phantasia, and has since designed for multiple entries including Abyss and Xillia. Another designer, Mutsumi Inomata, first designed for the series with Destiny, and has contributed designs for multiple entries including Eternia, Rebirth and Xillia. A third regular artist is Daigo Okumura, who designed characters for Vesperia and Xillia 2, as well as Dawn of the New World. Other designers to work on the series include Kazuto Nakazawa (Legendia), Kouichi Kimura (Xillia 2), and Minoru Iwamoto (Zestiria). The art design for each game's world and characters has ranged between a cel-shaded anime style (Vesperia) to a more realistic style (Xillia 2). Skit character images are also directly inspired by anime art. The art style for each title is determined by the theme and story decided upon by the developers.|$|E
30|$|Participants <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> {{maintain}} their habitual diet, activity and alcohol intake during {{their participation in}} the current project.

There was a tie as Mohit chose Renee and Aanchal chose Suchit, so Prachi <b>was</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> select a member form immune roadies by lucky draw. She selected Suraj. He eliminated Renee. Suchit <b>was</b> then <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> eliminate a roadie from the other pair. He selected Anchal.|$|R
