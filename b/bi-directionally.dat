500|$|Although Kinesin-5 is {{required}} in all cells during cell division, {{it does not appear}} {{to play a major role}} in the metabolism of most non-dividing cells. [...] Among non-dividing cells, Kinesin-5 is most enriched within neurons, wherein it decorates the large microtubule bundles extending into axons and dendrites. [...] It has been shown, for example, that neurons remain fully viable in the background of a knock-down of Kinesin-5, but that changes in neuronal development and morphogenesis ensue. In developing neurons pharmacological inhibition and siRNA knockdown of KIF11 results in longer axons, more branches, fewer bouts of axon retraction and the inability of growth cones to turn on contact with repulsive substrates. In migratory neurons, inhibition of KIF11 causes neurons to migrate in a random pattern and form shorter leading processes. KIF11, like KIF15 and KIF23, is thought to act as a restrictor of short microtubules moving <b>bi-directionally</b> along the axon, exerting forces antagonistically to cytoplasmic dynein. In mature neurons, KIF11 restricts the movement of short microtubules in dendrites, contributing to the formation of characteristic shape of dendrites. KIF11 is also expressed in adult dorsal root ganglion neurons, although at a much diminished level. In adult neurons It has a similar effect on inhibiting the rate of short microtubule transport so pharmacological inhibition and siRNA knockdown of adult KIF11 may be a potential therapeutic tool for the augmentation of adult axon regeneration. However, a clear in vivo role for Kinesin-5 in neurogenesis remains to be elucidated. [...] Of note is that unusual peripheral neuropathies have not been observed in patients undergoing recent phase I or phase II trials of Kinesin-5 inhibitors for potential anti-cancer therapy.|$|E
2500|$|In a cell, DNA {{replication}} {{begins at}} specific locations, or origins of replication, in the genome.

Most prominently, DNA polymerase synthesizes the new strands by adding nucleotides that complement each (template) strand. [...] DNA [...] replication occurs during the S-stage of interphase.|$|E

50|$|Although {{studied in}} a {{unidirectional}} manner for many years, the bi-directional hypothesis was first described and tested in detail by Aravena et al. These authors utilized the Action-Sentence Compatibility Effect (ACE), a task {{commonly used to}} study the relationship between action and language, to test the effects of performing simultaneous language comprehension and motor tasks on neural and behavioral signatures of movement and language comprehension. These authors proposed that these two tasks cooperate <b>bi-directionally</b> when compatible, and interfere <b>bi-directionally</b> when incompatible. For example, when the movement implied by the action language stimuli {{is compatible with the}} movement being performed by the subject, it was hypothesized that performance of both tasks would be enhanced. Neural evidence of the bi-directional hypothesis was demonstrated by this study, and the development of this hypothesis is ongoing.|$|E

50|$|Double Line Automatic Signalling {{is a form}} of railway {{signalling}} used on {{the majority}} of double line sections in New Zealand. Double Line Automatic Signalling uses track circuits to detect the presence of trains in sections broken up by intermediate signals.

DLAS is not designed for wrong-line running in emergency situations.|$|E

50|$|The {{station has}} two {{platforms}} currently in use: the old northbound platform (now <b>bi-directionally</b> signalled & used by almost all timetabled services) and a south-facing bay platform (available but {{has only one}} service per week booked to depart from it). Platform 3, originally used for southbound trains, has been disused for over 20 years. The footbridge linking the platforms was removed in the late 1990s.

50|$|The HFC {{network is}} {{typically}} operated <b>bi-directionally,</b> meaning that signals are carried {{in both directions}} on the same network from the headend/hub office to the home, and from the home to the headend/hub office.

The very first HFC networks, and very old unupgraded HFC networks, are only one-way systems. Equipment for one-way systems may use POTS or radio networks to communicate to the headend.|$|E
50|$|Platform 5: (Split into 5a and 5b) Main {{northbound}} platform (but is signalled <b>bi-directionally).</b> Fast northbound Virgin Trains East Coast {{services to}} Scotland use this and generally call at Darlington and Newcastle Central only.

North/eastbound TransPennine Express to Scarborough generally use this platform along with summer Saturday-only East Midlands Trains services to Scarborough. Southbound Virgin Trains East Coast services also stop here both fast and semi-fast, the latter of which generally call at Doncaster, Newark, Peterborough and London King's Cross.|$|E

50|$|IBM Domino servers and Notes clients {{identify}} NSF files {{by their}} Replica IDs, and keep replicate files synchronized by <b>bi-directionally</b> exchanging data, metadata, and application logic and design.

Replication between two servers, or between a client and a server, can occur over a network or a point-to-point modem connection. Replication between servers may occur at intervals according to a defined schedule, in near-real-time when triggered by data changes in server clusters, or when triggered by an administrator or program.|$|E
50|$|Enrichment of {{facilitation}} {{can occur}} when involvement in one role leads to benefits, resources, and/or personality enrichment which then may improve performance or {{involvement in the}} other role. Enrichment can occur <b>bi-directionally</b> such as work-family enrichment or family-work enrichment. Work-family enrichment occurs when involvement in work provides benefits such as skill growth, or changing of mood to be more positive, which has {{a positive effect on}} the family. Family-work enrichment occurs when involvement within the family results {{in the creation of a}} positive mood, feeling of support, or feeling of success which can help that individual to cope better, more efficient, more confidence, or recharged for one's role at work.|$|E
50|$|An {{association}} {{represents a}} family of links. A binary association (with two ends) is normally represented as a line. An association can link any number of classes. An association with three links is called a ternary association. An association can be named, and the ends of an association can be adorned with role names, ownership indicators, multiplicity, visibility, and other properties. There are four different types of association: bi-directional, uni-directional, aggregation (includes composition aggregation) and reflexive. Bi-directional and uni-directional associations {{are the most common}} ones. For instance, a flight class is associated with a plane class <b>bi-directionally.</b> Association represents the static relationship shared among the objects of two classes.|$|E
