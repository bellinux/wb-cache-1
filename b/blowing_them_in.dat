The stained glass-- especially that which surmounted the altar--contained those rich satisfying purples and deep deep crimsons which only go with age. It was a bright and yet a mellow light, falling in patches of vivid colour upon the brown woodwork and the grey floors. Here and there upon the walls were marble inscriptions in the Latin tongue, with pompous allegorical figures with trumpets, for our ancestors <b>blew</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> stone {{as well as in}} epitaphs over their tombs.

40|$|The year 2007 {{witnessed}} the experimental realization of extraordinary laser beams termed Airy and parabolic beams. Surprisingly, these beams are immune to diffraction {{and in addition}} exhibit transverse acceleration while propagating. This peculiar property of both Airy and parabolic beams facilitates the clearance of both microparticles and cells from a region in a sample chamber through particle/cell transport along curved trajectories. We term this concept "Optically mediated particle clearing" (OMPC) and, alternatively, "Optical redistribution" (OR) {{in the presence of}} a microfluidic environment, where particles and cells are propelled over micrometersized walls. Intuitively, Airy and parabolic beams act as a form of micrometer-sized "snowblower" attracting microparticles or cells at the bottom of a sample chamber to <b>blow</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> an arc to another region of the sample. In this work, we discuss the performance and limitations of OMPC and OR which are currently based on a single Airy beam optionally fed by a single parabolic beam. A possible strategy to massively enhance the performance of OMPC and OR is based on large arrays of Airy beams. We demonstrate the first experimental realization of such arrays...|$|R

5000|$|In the 2009 season, the Lakers {{had only}} one goal in mind: [...] "ring", their huddle chant {{throughout}} the year. In January, the Lakers would again lose Andrew Bynum to injury.

5000|$|Iron Shirt (traditional Chinese: {{simplified}} Chinese: pinyin: tiě shān; Cantonese: tit1 saam3) {{is a form}} of hard style martial art {{exercise for}} protecting the human body from impacts in a fight.

[...] In another positive review Pitchforks Aaron Leitko wrote: [...] "As with Drop, this extra polish and attention benefits Mutilator. There are tasteful psychedelic embellishments—synth wooshes, delay trails—and new instrumentation, like electric organ and acoustic guitar.

In the semifinals the Lakers took on the Sacramento Kings, a team who had also given the Lakers a tough series the previous season, but the Lakers took two close games at home and went to Sacramento to finish the Kings off with a 4-0 sweep as well.
