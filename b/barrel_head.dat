60|$|After vainly {{searching the}} cabin for those {{articles}} we most needed, we proceeded {{to explore the}} hold, into which as yet we had not penetrated. Here, we found a considerable quantity of pearl shells; cocoanuts; an abundance of fresh water in casks; spare sails and rigging; and some fifty barrels or more of salt beef and biscuit. Unromantic as these last mentioned objects were, I lingered over them long, and in a revery.

5000|$|As the war progressed, {{military}} authorities placed greater {{stress on the}} development of air-cooled engines, which they felt had more immunity to damage from weather, shellfire, and misuse. To meet this demand, Opel engineers developed an unusual variation on normal cooling for the 3.6 L truck engine. It was called [...] "air-oil cooling", and used engine oil to take heat away from the jackets around the cylinder <b>barrels.</b> The <b>heads</b> were directly cooled by air, there being three separate aluminum finned heads, each serving two cylinders. Of this interesting engine, which developed [...] at 3,000 rpm on 74-octane fuel, only three examples were built.|$|R

This model enjoyed competition success gaining the British team individual gold medals and 2nd place overall in the 1973 ISDT competition held in the critical USA market. The new Triumph Motorcycles company also used the Trophy name for the Trophy 900 and Trophy 1200 models.|$|R
50|$|MAC {{production}} restarted {{after the}} war. In 1948 the MAC's girder forks were replaced with innovative air-sprung Dowty Oleomatic forks. In 1951 these were upgraded to Veloce 'tele forks' which were {{developed for the}} Velocette LE. These had coil springs with damping. In the same year the engine was upgraded to an alloy <b>barrel</b> and <b>head</b> with wider fins to improve cooling. For the 1953 the MAC was updated with fully adjustable rear suspension, swinging arm and a tube frame. The clutch and gearbox were also greatly improved. From 1954 the MAC was sold as a sidecar machine to try to broaden the appeal but production was halted by 1960. The company had invested £50,000 developing the Velocette Viceroy scooter and, despite continued sales of the singles, Velocette became insolvent.|$|R

50|$|In 1963 the Greeves range still {{included}} the 25DC Sports Twin and two new models {{with the latest}} glass fibre tanks and handlebar fairings, as well as plastic mudguards. These were the 25DD 'Essex' and the 250 DCX 'Sportsman'. The same year the Greeves factory was asked to provide the motorcycles for the British ISDT team. This was significant because the team had previously relied on four-stroke vertical twins. Greeves produced three special machines for the event, which {{was held in the}} Czechoslovakian mountains. The engines were highly modified Villiers MK 36A but instead of the standard Villiers crankshaft they had an Alpha assembly and the squared-off cylinder <b>barrels</b> and <b>heads</b> were cast in Bert Greeves' own foundry and painted with matt black heat-dispersing paint. Although one of the riders, Triss Sharp, had starting problems, his brother Brian Sharp and the third rider Peter Stirland both won gold medals. The only woman to compete in the event was also riding a Greeves machine and won a bronze medal.|$|R
50|$|With {{help from}} Norton {{motorcycle}} racer Don Evans, Devin adapted the cylinder <b>barrels,</b> cylinder <b>heads</b> and pistons from the Norton Manx motorcycle to the two-cylinder boxer Panhard crankcase, roller-bearing crankshaft assembly and piston rods. He then fabricated a custom manifold that accepted two-barrel side-draft Weber carburetors. All of these alterations {{did not affect}} the displacement of the engine, leaving the 79.5mm bore and 75mm stroke unchanged for a total displacement of 745cc. What made the engine unique was the method Devin used to operate the valves. He abandoned the Panhard's pushrod OHV system and contacted the L. H. Gilmer company about using their toothed belts to drive the Manx cylinder heads' overhead cams. Development of synchronous toothed-belts was begun by the Gilmer company around 1940. Their primary application had been as a means of transmitting power in textile mills. Devin's use of the technology to drive the valve train in the Devin-Panhard engine was the first time toothed belts were used in a timing belt application. Devin did not apply for a patent on this innovation.|$|R
50|$|The large lead drum {{is known}} {{variously}} as caja, nsumbi, or ngoma {{and is usually}} <b>barrel</b> shaped. Its <b>head</b> is attached with a tensioning system of metal rods, usually known in English as “lugs.” The smaller drum known as segundo, salidor, or kundiabata, is cylindrical and has the skin attached with tacks, thus requiring it to be tuned by a flame or other heat source. The researcher Fernando Ortiz was told by interviewees that a cord-tensioning system was used prior to metal lugs, and this system was more recently documented in other regions by the Cuban music research institute known as CIDMUC (see references below).|$|R

50|$|In {{the final}} year of the war Morrell's {{innovative}} use of barrels ensured the seizure of Nashville, and the subsequent rupture of Confederate lines. Soon, General Custer's and Morrell's doctrine of massed barrel attacks was in use along every eastern front in North America. When the war ended, Morrell was a Colonel, a national hero, and was given his choice of assignments. He decided to <b>head</b> <b>Barrel</b> Works in Ft. Leavenworth, Kansas, and initially made great strides in designing the next generation of barrels. While stationed in Leavenworth, Morrell met Agnes Hill, a widow who lost her husband early in the Great War. They married in 1921, and their daughter, Mildred, was born in 1925.|$|R
5000|$|The old Greeves {{motorcycles}} were {{ideal for}} the new [...] "classic" [...] (twinshock) class of trials but parts were scarce and expensive, so trials rider Richard Deal started producing replica parts, and then a replica motorcycle called the Anglian. In May 1999, after gaining control of the trademarks of the Greeves name in the UK, USA and Europe, a new Greeves company was founded in Chelmsford which restarted production of mainly trials models. The new company started building and rebuilding Greeves motorcycles from 2000 and established a replacement parts division. Continuing a tradition started by Bert Greeves, the <b>heads,</b> <b>barrels,</b> crankcases, and aluminium frame beams were manufactured from new castings produced in a specialist alloy foundry.|$|R
40|$|The West African manatee (Trichechus Senegalensis) is {{threatened}} with extinction. Information on its ecology is scanty. Manatee ecology in Eniong Creek, South South Nigeria was studied. Canoe cruises {{were made in}} three randomly selected days per week, two weeks per month in the lower, middle and upper sections of the creek for six months. Behavior, feeding habits and dung and gut contents were observed directly. Information from respondents was also obtained. Chi-square tests, regression analysis and percentages were used to analyse data. Results showed that the manatee fed on at least 15 different species of plants with Ficus spp identified by {{the highest percentage of}} respondents (94 %). The number of manatee killed positively correlated (+ 0. 96) with the number sighted in the same period. There was a decline in the population of manatee from 803 in 2002 to 264 in 2007. The decline was attributed to heavy poaching and habitat destruction. Playful behavior of the manatee included somersaulting, <b>barrel</b> rolling, <b>head</b> and tail standing, body surfing and upside down gliding making it attractive for ecotourism. Alternative livelihood options were recommended for the local people to stop them from poaching the manatee and destroying its habitat...|$|R
5000|$|It is {{explained}} in the book Mysteries of Toronto as follows: [...] "As a prank, they had fabricated a semblance of the creature using a barrel filled with empty bottles for buoyancy and fitting it with a dragon-like head, rope and anchor {{to keep it in}} one place, and twine attached to the rope that ran underwater to the shore of Cartwright Bay to permit them to bob its <b>barrel</b> body and <b>head</b> up and down". (As quoted by Joe Nickel, writing for the Skeptical Inquirer.)On May 16, 2004 two individuals from the Kingston area witnessed a large unexplained animal underneath the water while fishing for carp in Little Cataraqui Creek. This was later named Kingstie, for it was spotted in Kingston Creek, Ontario.|$|R
50|$|The engine {{featured}} Heron heads, {{which were}} milled flat and the combustion chamber is recessed in the piston crown, aiding combustion and returning excellent fuel economy. A fuel consumption test by Motorcycling Monthly at Britain's Motor Industry Research Association in 1976 returned {{a performance of}} 65 mpgimp while a 3½ bike carried rider and pillion passenger. The engine also incorporated one piece forged steel crankshaft, ball main bearings (first series motors), plain big end bearings (second series motors), and the conrods run on a common pin, desaxe, and offsetting the rear cylinder to the front by 50 mm. Front and rear <b>barrels</b> and <b>heads</b> are interchangeable. VBH Dell'Orto (25 mm VHB 25 BS) square slide carburettors were fitted to the 350, with air fed via air-box with two filters. Bore and stroke was 62 x 57 mm, respectively. The camshaft was driven by a small toothed belt, and was a revolutionary advance. They also included an electronic capacitor discharge ignition system designed by Ducati Elettronica. Early models had kick-start only but later ones also included a starter motor using three centrifugal friction shoes engaging the alternator rotor cover. The CDI ignition was powered by a coil in the alternator and using the kick-start a bike could be started and ridden with a flat battery.|$|R
50|$|The {{result was}} a {{water-cooled}} version with <b>barrels</b> and cylinder <b>heads</b> cast in pairs, and fitted with enclosed valves. All exhaust ports now faced rearwards. Initially a thermo siphon design with a radiator {{on each side of}} the front frame downtubes, an impeller type water pump was soon added to the left side of the crankshaft to further aid cooling. Supercharger boost was reduced to 6 psi. Instead of the previous pressure lubrication, oil was now added to the fuel. The new duplex frame had integral rear plunger suspension housings, and the Webb-type girder forks were now graced with a deep finned alloy 8 in TLS front brake. The bike used a 21 in front tyre, and a 19 in rear. It had a six imperial gallon fuel tank.|$|R
