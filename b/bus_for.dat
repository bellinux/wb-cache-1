5|$|The host {{controller}} directs {{traffic flow}} to devices, so no USB device can transfer any {{data on the}} bus without an explicit request from the host controller. In USB2.0, the host controller polls the <b>bus</b> <b>for</b> traffic, usually in a round-robin fashion. The throughput of each USB port {{is determined by the}} slower speed of either the USB port or the USB device connected to the port.|$|E
5|$|The USB 3.0 {{specification}} {{was published}} on 12 November 2008. Its main goals were {{to increase the}} data transfer rate (up to 5Gbit/s), decrease power consumption, increase power output, and be backward compatible with USB 2.0. USB 3.0 includes a new, higher speed bus called SuperSpeed in parallel with the USB 2.0 <b>bus.</b> <b>For</b> this reason, the new version is also called SuperSpeed. The first USB 3.0 equipped devices were presented in January 2010.|$|E
5|$|Though most {{computers}} since mid-2004 can boot from USB {{mass storage}} devices, USB {{is not intended}} as a primary <b>bus</b> <b>for</b> a computer's internal storage. Buses such as Parallel ATA (PATA or IDE), Serial ATA (SATA), or SCSI fulfill that role in PC class computers. However, USB has one important advantage, {{in that it is}} possible to install and remove devices without rebooting the computer (hot-swapping), making it useful for mobile peripherals, including drives of various kinds (given SATA or SCSI devices may or may not support hot-swapping).|$|E
