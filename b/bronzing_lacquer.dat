40|$|Han Shu is {{our first}} history book which narrates the story by dynasty. It carries a lot of {{valuable}} information of the Han dynasty, both historically and literarily. However, because of the long-ago history, a lot of language, pronunciation, naming system, names of officials and places are now difficult to read and understand. Throughout the history, {{a number of people}} had analyzed Han Shu. These people have solved a lot of queries. Yang Shuda has high achievements in analyzing Han Shu. He is not only good at etymology and phonology but also analyzing parts of speech and sentence patterns. In terms of the use of materials, not only does he compare different versions of literature, but also uses inscriptions and even cultural data such as marriage and death for analysis. All these contribute to his unique analysis. The analysis of Han Shu has opened up a new field as more and more materials are excavated. <b>Bronze,</b> <b>lacquer</b> and even lute and currency are used in research. This has broadened the academic horizons and solved many mysteries. In 1983, in Hubei province, a lot of Han bamboo slips were excavated, which have provided tremendous help {{to our understanding of the}} medicine, law, mathematics and others of the Han dynasty. By the time when current books of Han analysis such as Yang Shuda’s Han Shu Kui Guan were punished, bamboo clips of Zhangjiashan were not yet unearthed. It is unable to invoke this important information, resulting in some doubtful content. I hereby try to make use of these bamboo slips to supplement previous comments, provide new research directions, or affirm previous results. This dissertation is divided to six parts.

40|$|It seems {{particularly}} appropriate that the Sheldon Memorial Art Gallery of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln presents the exhibition Juan Hamilton: Selected Works 1972 - 1991. It {{is apparent that}} Hamilton 2 ̆ 7 s encounter with the reductive form of Princess X, 1916 by the 20 th Century master sculptor, Constantin Brancusi, {{had a profound impact}} and influence on his own mature aesthetic. The Sheldon Memorial Art Gallery, designed by Philip Johnson, has had on permanent display in the Great Hall this sculpture since its opening to the public in 1963. Though Juan Hamilton was cognizant (prior to his collegiate studies at Hastings College in Nebraska) of Brancusi 2 ̆ 7 s sculpture, it seems that the biomorphic and columnar fluidity of Princess X had a lasting influence on his own sculptural vocabulary. It was also here on the remote plains of the Nebraska prairie that Hamilton found the solitude to pursue the medium of ceramics [...] the vessel that became the central metaphor for his sculpture. Juan Hamilton 2 ̆ 7 s new work reveals changes in terms of formal vocabulary and technical sophistication that substantially extend his range as an artist. Because Hamilton is dedicated to quality and to the continuity of tradition, these changes have been evolutionary rather than revolutionary. Newness in his case is never novelty, but a gradual increase of skill and vision. Thus the current matte black bronze sculptures executed {{during the past two years}} differ from the preceeding sleek, polished <b>bronzes</b> and <b>lacquered</b> <b>bronzes</b> in a number of ways that are significant they are larger, more distinctively sculptural in their conscious use of all 360 degrees of changing viewpoints, each one different as the viewer moves around Hamilton 2 ̆ 7 s subtle sloping shapes. Perhaps most importantly, the new works absorb rather than reflect light. This drawing away from light, as opposed to playing with a seductive flickering, enhances our sense of them as looming, mysterious presences, which display a new sense of gravity, a deliberate heaviness that is more illusion than reality. That Hamilton began his artistic career as a ceramist may explain why his forms, although they are monolithic, still communicate the personal touch of the artist 2 ̆ 7 s hand [...] the feeling of modeling rather than of cutting out or of slicing a form from a pre-existing block that we normally associate with the monolith. Moreover, there are no hard edges in Hamilton 2 ̆ 7 s art: plane meets plane softly, gently - another indication of his decisive rejection of the machine aesthetic that has more characterized recent modem art. Cenainly, simple, reductive forms are within the mainstream of modernist sculpture. However, they are much closer to the spiritual aesthetic that originally inspired Brancusi than they are to the materialist empiricism of minimal ar...|$|R

The richness of its outer ornament, so impressive at first, is, you discover, but prelude to the lavish luxury of its interior. <b>Lacquer,</b> <b>bronze,</b> pigments, deck its ceiling and its sides in such profusion {{that it seems to}} you as if art had expanded, in the congenial atmosphere, into a tropical luxuriance of decoration, and grew here as naturally on temples as in the jungle creepers do on trees. Yet all is but setting to what the place contains; objects of bigotry and virtue that appeal to the artistic as much as to the religious instincts of the devout. More sacred still are the things treasured in the sanctum of the priests. There you will find gems of art for whose sake only the most abnormal impersonality can prevent you from breaking the tenth commandment. Of the value set upon them you can form a distant approximation from the exceeding richness and the amazing number of the silk cloths and lacquered boxes in which they are so religiously kept. As you gaze thus, amid the soul-satisfying repose of the spot, at some masterpiece from the brush of Motonobu, you find yourself wondering, in a fanciful sort of way, whether Buddhist contemplation is not after all only another name for the contemplation of the beautiful, since devotees to the one are ex officio such votaries of the other.|$|R
40|$|During {{the years}} 1936 - 1937, Joseph Hackin, then D. A. F. A. 's {{president}} and his staff, discovered inside the ancient town of Begram — Afghanistan —, two sealed rooms filled with a fantastic amount of <b>bronze,</b> rare stones, <b>lacquer</b> and glass vessels, together with ivory sets to be nailed on pieces of furniture. The whole {{was thought to be}} a treasure and to belong to Kanishka, the famous king ot the Kushan dynasty supposed to have been living in the second century A. D. The objects unearthed were partly alloted to Kabul, partly to Paris. However, in spite of the two major publications issued in 1939 and 1954 (the second World war occurred in-between), not much has been made since to ascertain these first interpretations. The present article is devoted to a new approach of one of the three types of designs displayed on the Begram collection of glasses held in musée Guimet, i. e. the cut and engraved type. The diamond cut, high relief cut and linear or figurative engraved glasses are carefully examined and compared to their extant parallels so as to make out both their date and place of production. The first data gathered well seem to point to {{the second half of the}} first century A. D. which is rather earlier than imagined first, and, to Egypt.

40|$|Wooden sculptures {{painted with}} lacquer and adorned with real deer antlers are a {{characteristic}} feature of Chu burials {{from the late}} Spring and Autumn period through the late Warring States period. Despite this, the sculptures have received little attention from scholars, and the source, {{as well as the}} significance of the images has not been fully explained. This dissertation attempts to unveil the mystery of these tomb images. A regional study of the sculptures reveals that significant variations of the figures existed outside of the Chu heartland, the Jiangling region of modern Hubei province, and belief in the efficacy of the images was widespread in Chu territory. Although the images have been compared to the so-called taotie mask of Shang and Zhou bronze decoration, a more likely iconographical source for the images is three-dimensional animal appendages on Spring and Autumn and early Warring States period bronzes. The form of the sculptures is based on contemporary Warring States woodworking techniques, while a panoply of <b>bronze,</b> textile, and <b>lacquer</b> designs inspired the painted decoration. Traditionally, the antlered images have been identified with specific hybrid creatures described in the Chuci or the Shanhaijing, but this dissertation posits that, although the images are in the same genre of 2 ̆ 2 strange creatures 2 ̆ 2 as those described in ancient texts, we should be cautious of associating them with hybrid beasts whose textual descriptions do not match the figures exactly. Finally, the significance of the sculptures is considered in light of Chu religious practices and the burial context of the figures, and it is suggested that the images served multiple functions in the tomb, both {{for the benefit of the}} dead and for the living. ...|$|R
50|$|Despite Reyle’s ongoing {{commitment}} to abstraction, {{he is currently}} experimenting with representational motives. Indeed, in his recent works, Reyle playfully explores {{the origin of the}} figure by explicitly referencing the tradition of “paint-by-numbers,” thereby revealing the way abstract forms can coalesce and become recognizable subjects from life. By using a strategy such as seen in paint-by-numbers, the subject matter is dissected in single, serially numbered parts like a puzzle where each number is assigned a certain color that is in interaction with other fields. These are then filled in with materials or colors that the viewer can recognize from the Reyle repertoire, as in the stripe paintings or Otto-Freundlich-series. This juxtaposition creates the impression of a plastic relief {{with a wide range of}} surface textures which directly appeals to the viewer’s sense of touch. The most well-known sculptures of Anselm Reyle are the so-called „African sculptures“. The original forms and titles for these work groups are borrowed from tourist markets and the kitschy flea market handicrafts - often made from soapstone - that are sold as clichés of African sculpture. Set on a low-lying Macassar wooden plinth, his piece Harmony (2007) is based on a small soapstone sculpture his mother purchased on a visit to Africa. While cheap and derivative, in their formal conception these forms recall the prominent abstract sculptors of modern art like Hans Arp, Alexander Archipenko and Henry Moore. The distinct influence of European sculpture on these African knick-knacks manifests itself in this suggested prototype of modern plastic art. Reyle uses traditional techniques; enlarging the original found object before casting it in <b>bronze,</b> chroming and <b>lacquering</b> it. This process creates a work with great tension as the traditional hand sculptural technique is contrasted with the highly engineered bronze work. The viewer’s foreknowledge of the techniques that Reyle underwent to create and transform the object is vital to communicate this intentional paradox.|$|R
