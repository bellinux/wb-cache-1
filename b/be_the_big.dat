500|$|By {{the end of}} 1997, Be Here Now {{had sold}} eight million units worldwide. However, the sales volume was largely gained {{in the first two}} weeks of release, and once the album was {{released}} to UK radio stations the turnover tapered off. Buyers realised that the album was not another (What's the Story) Morning Glory?, and by 1999, Melody Maker reported that it was the album most sold to second-hand record stores. In the 2003 John Dower-directed documentary , music critic Jon Savage pinpointed Be Here Now as the moment where the Britpop movement ended. Savage said that while the album [...] "isn't the great disaster that everybody says", he noted that [...] "t was supposed to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>big,</b> big triumphal record" [...] of the period. Q expressed similar sentiments, writing, [...] "So colossally did Be Here Now fall short of expectations that it killed Britpop and ushered in an era of more ambitious, less overblown music". Irish Times journalist Brian Boyd wrote: [...] "Bloated and over-heated (much like the band themselves at the time), the album has all that dreadful braggadocio that is so characteristic of a cocaine user." [...] Reflecting in 2007, Garry Mulholland admitted, [...] "the fact that nothing could have lived up to the fevered expectations that surrounded its release doesn't change the facts.

500|$|The Joshua Tree {{received}} critical acclaim, and {{the best}} reviews of U2's career to that point. Rolling Stone wrote, [...] "For a band that's always specialized in inspirational, larger-than-life gestures—a band utterly determined to be Important—The Joshua Tree could <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> one, and that's precisely what it sounds like." [...] The review described the album's sound as [...] "wed the diverse textures of The Unforgettable Fire to fully formed songs, many of them as aggressive as the hits on War". Steve Morse of The Boston Globe echoed these sentiments in his review, stating, [...] "It's another spiritual progress report, enwrapped in music that strikes a healthy balance between the lushness of their last album, 1984's The Unforgettable Fire, and the more volcanic rock of their early years." [...] Morse called it [...] "their most challenging work to date" [...] and the [...] "most rewarding rock record of the new year". NME praised the album as [...] "a better and braver record than anything else that's likely to appear in 1987... It's the sound of people still trying, still looking..." [...] Thom Duffy of the Orlando Sentinel said the songs have [...] "exultant power" [...] that, [...] "like the Joshua Tree's branches, stretch upward {{in stark contrast to}} their barren musical surroundings on rock radio". He praised the musicianship of the group members, calling Bono's vocals [...] "wrenching", the rhythm section of Mullen and Clayton [...] "razor-sharp", and the Edge's guitar playing [...] "never... better". The New Zealand Herald called The Joshua Tree [...] "the most compelling collection of music yet from a band that has cut its career with passionate, exciting slashes". It judged that the record's [...] "power lies in its restraint" [...] and that there is an [...] "urgency underlying virtually all of the 11 songs".|$|E

2500|$|Oasis' {{third album}} Be Here Now (1997) was highly anticipated. Despite {{initially}} attracting positive reviews and selling strongly, the record was soon subjected to strong criticism from music critics, record-buyers and even Noel Gallagher himself for its overproduced and bloated sound. Music critic Jon Savage pinpointed Be Here Now as the moment where Britpop ended; Savage {{said that while}} the album [...] "isn't the great disaster that everybody says," [...] he noted that [...] "t was supposed to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>big,</b> big triumphal record" [...] of the period. At the same time, Damon Albarn sought to distance Blur from Britpop with the band's self-titled fifth album, Blur (1997). On guitarist Graham Coxon's suggestion, Blur moved away from their Parklife-era sound, and their music began to assimilate American lo-fi influences, particularly that of Pavement. Albarn explained to the NME in January 1997 that [...] "We created a movement: as far as the lineage of British bands goes, there'll always be a place for us", but added, [...] "We genuinely started to see that world in a slightly different way." ...|$|E
2500|$|Reception {{towards the}} tryouts in Houston were so {{enthusiastic}} that the production was extended for two weeks.

At the same time, Weeks felt that the production [...] "gets close to slipping into a big-budget kiddie show or magic act with its overdone showbiz glitz and sparkly stage-illusion effects"at times, but in the end predicted that [...] "'Beauty and the Beast' could well <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> new musical hit this Broadway season has been waiting for." [...] However, in 1994, Beauty and the Beast finally premiered on Broadway to reviews that ranged from mixed to negative, leaving critics mostly unimpressed. Reactions from the New York theatre community and Broadway producers were particularly harsh, ridiculing Disney for deciding to produce the musical themselves as opposed to enlisting traditional theatre companies.

2500|$|On 12 August 2008, Ralph Peters {{wrote that}} he was [...] "seeing the {{emergence}} of a rogue military power with a nuclear arsenal". Russia made it clear that it would not tolerate freedom and self-rule in its neighbours. Russian air force had been trying unsuccessfully to hit the gas pipeline running from the Caspian Sea to the Mediterranean. The Kremlin gave a signal to Europe that it not only had the power to turn off Siberian gas, it could turn off every tap in the region any time. Peters wrote: [...] "Any soldier above the grade of private can tell you that there’s absolutely no way Moscow could have launched this huge ground, air and sea offensive in an instantaneous “response” to alleged Georgian actions." [...] Even to get one armored brigade over the Caucasus Mountains needed extensive preparations. Russia (working through its mercenaries in South Ossetia) was staging brutal provocations against Georgia beginning from late July 2008. Peters compared the Russian attack on Georgia to Hitler’s march into Czechoslovakia. The war in Georgia was supposed to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> debut for the Kremlin’s revitalized armed forces (funded by the new petroleum-generated wealth), but the war unintentionally revealed many of enduring Russian weaknesses.|$|E

[...] In response to complaints about {{the pace of the}} development, he said, [...] "There are a lot of fans {{who would like to see}} that story advance much faster than we're doing it, but I firmly believe a little goes a long way and there are ways to tease it and to flirt that are just as significant and just as meaningful." [...] He maintained, [...] "We made huge strides. Their relationship has evolved, has changed. They're a little more open with each other and a little more emotionally connected, certainly more than where we were at the beginning of the season. [...] may not <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> leap that a lot of people would like it to be, but I also feel like we're enjoying the pace at which this is happening. That's not to say we're not headed in the direction everyone would like to go, but I think we’re getting there. It's very complicated when two agents who are working together get into a relationship, and that's something that [...] would be very conscious of.

2500|$|Suzuki joined Sega in 1983 as a programmer. In {{his first}} year, {{he created a}} 2D boxing game called Champion Boxing for Sega's first home game console, the SG-1000. According to Suzuki, the {{executive}} staff at Sega found the game so impressive that they released it in arcades as-is by simply installing an SG-1000 into an arcade cabinet. He was promoted to project leader while still {{in his first year}} at the company. Then, Suzuki began working on another arcade game which would prove to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> stepping-off point of his career. [...] "To develop this game," [...] Suzuki told G4TV, [...] "I rode on motorcycles a lot. [...] When we came up with the prototype (for the arcades), I would ride on that prototype bike for hours and hours every day." [...] His efforts culminated into the game Hang-On, released in 1985. Hang-On was a success as it broke new ground in arcade technology. It did not feature any traditional controls, as the movement of the on-screen avatar was dictated by the movements the player made with their body on the motorcycle cabinet. This began the [...] "Taikan" [...] trend, the use of motion-controlled hydraulic arcade cabinets in many arcade games of the late 1980s, two decades before motion controls became popular on video game consoles. Running on the Sega Space Harrier hardware, it was also the first of Sega's [...] "Super Scaler" [...] arcade system boards that allowed three-dimensional sprite/texture-scaling at high frame rates. The three-dimensional sprite/tile scaling was handled in a similar manner to textures in later texture-mapped polygonal 3D games of the 1990s. Suzuki stated that his [...] "designs were always 3D from the beginning. All the calculations in the system were 3D, even from Hang-On. I calculated the position, scale, and zoom rate in 3D and converted it backwards to 2D. So I was always thinking in 3D." ...|$|E
2500|$|Great Falls {{quickly became}} a {{thriving}} industrial and supply center. In 1894, naturalist Vernon Bailey passed through and described Great Falls as [...] "a very good town, appears prosperous and booming & I should judge contains 15000 inhabitants." [...] By the early 1900s, Great Falls was en route to becoming one of Montana's largest cities. The rustic studio of famed Western artist Charles Marion Russell was a popular attraction, as were the famed [...] "Great Falls of the Missouri", after which the city was named. A structure billed as the [...] "world's tallest smokestack" [...] was completed in 1908 by the city's largest employer, the Anaconda Copper Mining Company's smelter, measuring [...] tall. The Big Stack immediately became a landmark for the community. The Big Stack's 'sister' stack in Anaconda was suffering from cracking and {{it was decided to}} remove the support bands from the upper half of the Big Stack and send them to Anaconda. This action proved to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> Stack's ultimate demise since the cracks it suffered from rapidly worsened. Citing public safety concerns due to the stack's continual deterioration of its structural integrity it was slated for demolition on September 18, 1982. In an interesting twist of fate the demolition crew failed to accomplish the task on the first try; the two worst cracks in the stack ran from just above ground level to nearly 300 feet up. As the 600lbs of explosives were set off (which was to create a wedge in the base so it would fall almost vertically into a large trench for the rubble) the cracks 'completed themselves' {{all the way to the}} ground—effectively severing the stack into two-thirds and one-third pieces. Much to the delight of the spectating community, the smaller of the two pieces remained standing, but the failed demolition only solidified the safety issue whereas the community cited the event as the stack's defiance. The demolition team who had planted the charges was recalled and several hours later they returned and finished the demolition, after packing another 400lbs of explosives into the smaller wedge.|$|E
