40|$|A {{logic and}} proof system is {{introduced}} for specifying and proving properties of open distributed systems. Key {{problems that are}} addressed include the verification of process networks with a changing interconnection structure, and where new processes can be continuously spawned. To demonstrate the results in a realistic setting we consider a core fragment of the Erlang programming language. Roughly this amounts to a first-order actor language with data types, buffered asynchronous communication, and dynamic process spawning. Our aim is to verify quite general properties of programs in this fragment. The specification logic extends the first-order µ-calculus with Erlang-specific primitives. For verification we use an approach which combines local model checking with facilities for compositional verification. We give a specification and verication example based on a <b>billing</b> <b>agent</b> which controls and charges for user access to a given resource...|$|E

50|$|CELS had a less {{favourable}} {{take on this}} decision. “Revising {{the role}} of the AFI should lead it to revise its existing staff,” the human rights organizations said yesterday. According to the <b>bill,</b> <b>agents</b> will be recruited in a more transparent way and will be constantly monitored by their superiors, who will be able to remove them from their posts if they are accused of targeting authorities. However, CELS said these parametres should be more clear in {{the final version of the}} legislation.Who will lead investigations? CELS warned the full text of the bill unveiled grants new powers to the AFI by reinforcing the department’s investigative powers based on the “new threats” doctrine following the 9/11 attacks. “Even if (these new powers) are limited to international threats, the agency’s ability to carry out criminal investigations was not originally intended as an intelligence activity, except if ordered by a judge”. This new function, far from helping intelligence agents to work on information collection as well as data and information analysis, will make it harder for the Argentine state to move away “from the promiscuous relationship between the intelligence structure and federal justice”, as criticized by CFK during the national broadcast where she announced the new proposed changes.|$|R
5000|$|As Veterans' Affairs Committee chairman, Montgomery led {{opposition}} to the Kerry-Daschle <b>bill</b> (<b>Agent</b> Orange Disabilities Act of 1987, S.1787) that would have required the VA to begin compensating veterans who contracted non-Hodgkins lymphoma and lung cancer a presumed service-connected disease. Montgomery asserted that [...] "further studies were needed to prove a connection between various diseases and Agent Orange before {{the government should be}} held liable for disability benefits" [...] despite several such JAMA published studies by the National Cancer Institute and the VA and one by the New Jersey Agent Orange Commission. [...] Subsequent scientific studies made connections between Agent Orange and Vietnam Veterans illnesses and the increased birth defects of their children. In 1991 Montgomery stood behind president George H.W. Bush at the signing of the Agent Orange Act. He had opposed a similar bill the previous year. After years of opposing Vietnam Veterans receiving disability for exposure to Agent Orange, he now appeared as their champion. In the same year he authored the Montgomery Amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1987, which effectively transferred control of the National Guard away from the states and to the Department of Defense by prohibiting state governors to withhold National Guard forces.|$|R
