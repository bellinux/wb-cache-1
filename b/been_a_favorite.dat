5|$|In mid-1877, Rimsky-Korsakov thought {{increasingly}} {{about the}} short story May Night by Nikolai Gogol. The story had long <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>favorite</b> of his, and his wife Nadezhda had encouraged him to write an opera based on it from the day of their betrothal, when they had read it together. While musical ideas for such a work predated 1877, now they came with greater persistence. By early 1878 the project took an increasing amount of his attention; in February he started writing in earnest, and he finished the opera by early November.|$|E
5|$|On October 12, Burke {{broke his}} {{right index finger}} below the middle knuckle. He had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>favorite</b> for NBA Rookie of the Year, but was listed as out indefinitely. On October 14, an October 15 surgery to insert {{surgical}} pins was announced. The 2013–14 Jazz were scheduled to begin the 2013–14 NBA season on October 30. Although early reports suggested an 8‑to12-week hiatus, ESPN The Magazine Chris Broussard reported only a 6-week absence was expected. On November 11, Burke's finger was reevaluated. Without Burke, the Jazz began the season 0–8 with Lucas and Jamaal Tinsley playing point guard. On November 12, the Jazz announced that Burke had only been cleared to begin individual drills, {{that he would be}} reevaluated November 25 and that Tinsley had been waived. Jazz head coach Tyrone Corbin reported that by November 13 Burke was dribbling a basketball painfree.

25|$|As it {{has been}} since Aztec times, the state has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>favorite</b> retreat for those in Mexico City, {{especially}} Cuernavaca, due to its warm year-round climate.

Most of this boom is centered on the city of Cuernavaca but there it also affects Cuautla and some other places as well.|$|E
25|$|The spans have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>favorite</b> {{of movie}} {{production}} crews as the CCC is an iconic {{part of the}} skyline of the city. The HOV lanes are frequently used for filming, as they are not heavily used and are separated from normal traffic by barrier walls. Both spans were briefly closed on April 9, 2006, to allow filming with stunts and pyrotechnics for the Denzel Washington film Déjà Vu. The spans also served as the anchor for the background {{in most of the}} outdoor scenes in the film A Love Song for Bobby Long.|$|E
25|$|Narita-san has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>favorite</b> {{site for}} {{excursions}} and pilgrimages by {{citizens of the}} nearby metropolitan area ever since the Tokugawa shoguns moved the national capital to Edo in 1603. After nearby Narita International Airport became the primary international hub for Japanese air traffic in the late 1970s, Narita-san also began to attract increasing numbers of foreign tourists, especially {{those who have a}} long layovers in transit. The airport is just a short train ride from either JR East Narita Station or Keisei Narita Station.

25|$|Monterey is {{well known}} for the {{abundance}} and diversity of its marine life, which includes sea lions, sea otters, harbor seals, bat rays, kelp forests, pelicans and dolphins and several species of whales. Only a few miles offshore is the Monterey Canyon, the largest and deepest (3.2km) underwater canyon off the Pacific coast of North America, which grants scientists access to the deep sea within hours. The cornucopia of marine life makes Monterey a popular destination for scuba divers of all abilities ranging from novice to expert. Scuba classes are held at San Carlos State Beach, which has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>favorite</b> with divers since the 1960s. Monterey is home to one of the largest aquariums in North America, namely the Monterey Bay Aquarium, as well as several marine science laboratories, including Hopkins Marine Station.|$|E
25|$|By the mid-20th century, Peking Duck {{had become}} a {{national}} symbol of China, favored by tourists and diplomats alike. For example, Henry Kissinger, the Secretary of State of the United States, met Premier Zhou Enlai in the Great Hall of the People on July 10, 1971, during his first (secret) visit to China. After a round of inconclusive talks in the morning, the delegation was served Peking Duck for lunch, which became Kissinger's favourite. The Americans and Chinese issued a joint statement the following day, inviting President Richard Nixon to visit China in 1972. Following Zhou's death in 1976, Kissinger paid another visit to Beijing to savor Peking Duck. Peking Duck, at the Quanjude in particular, has also <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>favorite</b> dish for various political leaders ranging from Cuban revolutionary Fidel Castro to former German chancellor Helmut Kohl.|$|E
25|$|The Jabal an Nusayriyah, a {{mountain}} range paralleling the coastal plain, has an average elevation {{of just over}} 1,212 meters above sea level; the highest peak, Nabi Yunis, is about 1,575 meters above sea level. The western slopes catch moisture-laden western sea winds and are thus more fertile and more heavily populated than the eastern slopes, which receive only hot, dry winds blowing across the desert. Before reaching the Lebanese border and the Anti-Lebanon Mountains, the Jabal an Nusayriyah range terminates, leaving a corridorthe Homs Gapthrough which run the highway and railroad from Homs to the Lebanese port of Tripoli. For centuries the Homs Gap has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>favorite</b> trade and invasion route from the coast to the country's interior and {{to other parts of}} Asia. Eastward, the line of al-Ansariyah mountains is separated from the Jabal az Zawiyah range and the plateau region by the Al Ghab valley, a fertile, irrigated trench crossed by the meandering Orontes River.|$|E

During the 2013 Soundwave Festival, Paramore held a listening party in Sydney, New South Wales on February 26, 2013, followed by Melbourne, Victoria two days later, run by Australian Music Channel, Channel V. Williams revealed a section of the lyrics for the song 'Part II' which the winners were able to hear at the listening parties on a LiveJournal post. Williams told fans that [...] "'Let The Flames Begin' has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>favorite</b> of ours to play live, as well as being a favorite of most people who come out to our shows....

500|$|Harmon has {{emphasized}} the importance of the cast to making the premise of the comedy work. [...] "Casting was 95 percent of putting the show together," [...] he said in an interview. He had worked with several of the cast members earlier; Joel McHale, John Oliver and Chevy Chase all had cameo roles in episode 9 of Water and Power, the short film series produced by Harmon for Channel 101. Actor Chevy Chase had long <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>favorite</b> of Harmon. Though principally not very partial to sitcoms, Chase was persuaded to take the job by the quality of the show's writing. Harmon saw similarities between Chase and the character he plays on the show. Though Chase has often been ridiculed for his career choices, Harmon believed this role could be redeeming: [...] "What makes Chevy and Pierce heroic is this refusal to stop." [...] Harmon had to warn Chase against playing a [...] "wise-ass" [...] the way he often does in his roles, since the character of Pierce is a rather pathetic figure who is normally the butt of the joke himself.|$|E
