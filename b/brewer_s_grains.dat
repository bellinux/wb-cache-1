40|$|This report {{examines}} {{current trends}} in the U. <b>S.</b> <b>grain</b> industry. Many identity preservation(IP) grain systems have emerged recently, driven by a confluence {{of supply and demand}} factors. IP grain requirements for specific production protocols, marketing channels, and quality assurance depend on whether the crops are trait-specific, non-GM (genetically modified), organic, or pharmaceutical. Cost structures vary according to the relative importance of segregation and risk management. High information management, greater market coordination, and frequent reliance on contracts characterize IP grains. IP grain markets are also inherently riskier, with volatile supply, inelastic demand, and fluctuating price premiums. Increasing grain differentiation is altering the marketing structure of the U. <b>S.</b> <b>grain</b> industry and creating possible roles for government policy, particularly in market facilitation, standard setting, and regulations affecting food safety and biosecurity.

40|$|Between 1993 and 1996, two {{developments}} {{occurred in}} world grain markets which posed {{a potential threat}} to the food security of import-dependent developing countries. First, starting in later 1994, real grain prices increased, limiting the ability of less developed countries (LDCs) to import grain during production shortfalls. Second, and perhaps more importantly, after 1993 the world stock-to-use ratios in the major food grains fell to record lows. This paper describes {{the nature of the}} 1990 <b>s</b> <b>grain</b> price increase, and contrast it to the grain price crisis of the 1970 s. The paper looks at 22 of the largest, poorest, and most import-dependent LDCs.

40|$|Export demand {{functions}} for U. S. wheat were estimated for five world regions. Estimates {{of the effects}} of income, price, and nonprice variables on U. S. wheat exports were obtained using various econometric procedures. The major finding of the paper indicates that exchange rate changes have had a substantial impact on U. S. wheat ex-ports. This result, conditioned on the aggregative nature of the study, supports the belief expressed by some researchers in recent years. Some economists have suggested that dol-lar devaluations were important factors in the increased demand for U. <b>S.</b> <b>grain</b> during the early 1970 's. 1 Furthermore, Schuh (1974) ar-gues that an important share of the income problems of U. S. agriculture in the post-World War II period resulted from persistent over-valuation of the U. S. dollar. The argu-ment goes as follows: over-valuation of the dollar implies higher U. S. prices in terms of foreign currencies. This, in turn, reduces the demand for U. <b>S.</b> <b>grain</b> exports, and therefore reduces the total demand (domestic and foreign) for U. <b>S.</b> <b>grain.</b> Consequently, U. <b>S.</b> domestic prices are depressed below those that would apply under correct valuation of the U. S. dollar. Schuh (1974, p. 2) expresses this result as " [...] an under-valuation of our agricultural resources in relation to their world opportunity costs. " When the opposite event occurs, namely, devaluation of the U. S. dollar, the reverse sequence of events take place. The end result in this case is both an increase in U. S. exports and domestic prices...|$|R
