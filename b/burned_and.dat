5|$|Uranium is {{extracted}} from its ores in various ways. In one method, the ore is <b>burned</b> <b>and</b> then reacted with nitric acid to convert uranium into a dissolved state. Treating the solution {{with a solution}} of tributyl phosphate (TBP) in kerosene transforms uranium into an organic form UO2(NO3)2(TBP)2. The insoluble impurities are filtered and the uranium {{is extracted}} by reaction with hydroxides as (NH4)2U2O7 or with hydrogen peroxide as UO4·2H2O.|$|E

5|$|Zoroastrian {{places of}} worship were desecrated, shrines were {{destroyed}} and mosques were built in their place.

5|$|Adrienne {{visits the}} nearly 110-year-old Malcolm Wyrmshadow (Douglas Seale), {{who had been}} Carno's {{apprentice}} as a young boy. Malcolm reveals that Carno met his demise after his last wife, Marie (Traci Clauson), discovered he was a murderer. Marie conspired with her lover, Gaston (Jeff Rector), to kill Carno by sabotaging the equipment for his most infamous and dangerous escapology trick, in which Carno dons a burning hood and escapes from bonds on a throne underneath a swinging axe. The sabotage leaves Carno horribly <b>burned</b> <b>and</b> disfigured, but he survives and viciously attacks Marie and Gaston. After killing Marie by beheading her, Carno is killed by Gaston, who then succumbs to his own wounds.|$|E

5|$|All {{but four}} of the women from Lidice were {{deported}} immediately to Ravensbrück concentration camp (four were pregnant– they were subjected to forced abortions at the same hospital where Heydrich had died and the women were then sent to the concentration camp). Some children were chosen for Germanization, and 81 were killed in gas vans at the Chełmno extermination camp. Both towns were <b>burned</b> <b>and</b> Lidice's ruins were levelled. At least 1,300 people were massacred after Heydrich's death.|$|E
5|$|As a {{manufacturing}} center, Pittsburgh also became an arena for intense labor strife. During the Great Railroad Strike of 1877, Pittsburgh workers protested and had massive demonstrations that erupted into widespread violence, {{known as the}} Pittsburgh Railway Riots. Militia and federal troops were called {{to the city to}} suppress the strike. Forty men died, most of them workers, and more than 40 buildings were burned down, including the Union Depot of the Pennsylvania Railroad. Strikers also <b>burned</b> <b>and</b> destroyed rolling stock: more than 100 train engines and 1000 railcars were destroyed. It was the city with the most violence of any affected by the strikes.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time Crimean Tatars devastated Russian territories and <b>burned</b> <b>and</b> looted Moscow during the Russo-Crimean Wars.

Ivan IV had introduced a new strategy whereby he relied on tens of thousands of native troops, Cossacks and Tatars instead of a few thousand skilled troops and mercenaries, as was the practice of his adversaries.|$|E

5|$|During the Second World War Waterloo {{station and}} the nearby Thames bridges were a {{significant}} target for Axis bombing, and there were several near-misses on the station during the London Blitz of 1940–41. Although there were several interruptions to the Necropolis train service owing to enemy action elsewhere on the line, the Necropolis station was undamaged {{during the early stages}} of the bombing campaign. During the night of 16–17 April 1941, in one of the last major air raids on London, bombs repeatedly fell on the Waterloo area. The rolling stock berthed in the Necropolis siding was <b>burned,</b> <b>and</b> the railway arch connecting the main line to the Necropolis terminus was damaged, but the terminal building itself remained unscathed.|$|E

5|$|Humans {{have lived}} in the Little Applegate River {{watershed}} for approximately 11,000 years, based on Clovis points discovered in the area. The first inhabitants were most likely the Latgawa, Shasta, and Dakubetede tribes of Native Americans, descendants of the first humans who traveled across the Bering land bridge from Siberia. They fished for salmon, trout, and lamprey, and hunted for deer and elk. They also often set fires to clear brush from prairies and oak savannas, and to promote the growth of certain crops. The fires were limited by the Native Americans, creating a patchwork of <b>burned</b> <b>and</b> unburned land, thus increasing the biodiversity of the watershed.|$|E
5|$|In 1793, cattle {{were brought}} by George Vancouver {{as a tribute}} to King Kamehameha I. By the early 19th century, they had escaped {{confinement}} and roamed the island freely, greatly damaging its ecosystem. In 1809 John Palmer Parker arrived and befriended KamehamehaI, who put him in charge of cattle management on the island. With an additional land grant in 1845, Parker established Parker Ranch on the northern slope of Mauna Kea, a large cattle ranch that is still in operation today. Settlers to the island <b>burned</b> <b>and</b> cut down much of the native forest for the construction of sugarcane plantations and houses.|$|E
