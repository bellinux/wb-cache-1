40|$|European pork supply chains, {{like other}} {{agri-food}} supply chains, currently face numerous challenges such as globalization, emerging markets, changing consumer requirements, and new governmental regulations related to {{issues such as}} environmental pollution and food safety. These challenges require continuous innovation of supply chain network structures, reconsideration of business processes, relocation of logistics infrastructures and renewed allocation of chain activities to these infrastructures {{in order to achieve}} sustainable performances. This paper presents a scenario analysis of the spatial allocation of pork supply chain activities in Europe. Supply chain production and distribution activities are optimized in various scenarios based on economic and sustainability performance indicators. A mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model, which includes piglet production, <b>fattening,</b> <b>slaughtering</b> of pigs, processing of pork and pork consumption, is used to analyse the scenarios. The results reveal major opportunities for reductions in cost as well as in CO 2 equivalent emissions if a European sector perspective is taken and some chain activities are relocated to other countries. However, as minimizing costs will not always lead to an optimal reduction in CO 2 equivalent emissions, a differentiated strategy is needed for the European pork sector to move towards more sustainable production...|$|R

In pig production, we may observe a constant decline of the application of feed antibi-otics, with the increase in the use of antibiotics for therapeutic purposes (Bjornerot et al., 1996). In the light of available studies, the effectiveness of the al-ternative application of AGP biostimulators, among others from the group of probiotics and prebiotics is not, however, univocal (Kornegay and Risley, 1996; Houdijk et al., 1998; Harper and Estinne, 2002).

With respect to total live weight gain and daily live weight gain, Simmental young bulls were higher than Black & White young bulls (168. 1 kg vs. 141. 8 kg and 1. 401 vs. 1. 181 kg). Besides, the feed conversion ratio data show that Simmental young bulls converted feed to body mass more efficiently than that of Black & White young bulls (6. 49 vs. 7. 44, kg feed : kg gain).

40|$|The {{study was}} aimed at {{defining}} leptin gene polymorphism and its potential association with values of particular features of <b>fattening</b> and <b>slaughter</b> value of gilts of Line 990. The study included a total of 208 gilts. The polymorphic locus in LEP gene was identified by the restriction enzyme HinfI in 3469 position, by using the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment-length polymorphism (PCR–RFLP) method. Two alleles of LEP gene were identified: T (0. 94) and C (0. 06), resulting in two genotypes: TC (0. 12) and TT (0. 88). We did not observe any gilts of CC genotype. The analysis of values of <b>fattening</b> and <b>slaughter</b> features, depending on LEP genotype did not reveal significant differences in body mass increase, daily gain from day 63 to 180, and daily gain from birth to day 180, feed conversion per 1 kg body mass and the loin-eye thickness. Significant differences between the LEP genotypes were present for such features as the backfat thickness at points P 2 (p ≤ 0. 05) and P 4 (p ≤ 0. 01) and average backfat thickness (p ≤ 0. 01) in favour of TT genotype. We noted higher average values of lean meat content in carcass in favour of TT homozygotes, compared to the heterozygotes (p ≤ 0. 05).

40|$|Development of {{beef cattle}} {{agribusiness}} through partnership patternBeef cattle {{are the largest}} contributor of the ruminants to the national meat production, therefore cattle farming is potential to be developed. In Indonesia, cattle are raised traditionally by farmers as a family saving and as draught animal in land preparation. Beef cattle farming is commonly as a small-scale farming and consists of <b>breeding,</b> <b>fattening,</b> and integrated farming system with food crops or estate crops. Development of beef cattle agribusiness through partnership pattern could be an alternative approach in increasing farmers 2 ̆ 7 incomes and national meat production. Partnership is a cooperation between two or more partners in beef cattle farming in preproduction, production processes, and marketing based on equally and profitable principles. The development of beef catlle farming through partnership pattern is expected to meet the national demand for meat that continuously increases. On the other hand, the high demand for beef cattle meat gives an opportunity to develop beef cattle farming in the country through partnership to increase production and productivity.

40|$|International {{audience}} 1. The {{objective of}} this study was to determine the influence of iodine (I) supplementation of feed within the range of the European guidelines, on the performance of broiler chickens and the iodine transfer into different organs and tissues, especially meat. The main emphasis was to assess if broiler meat could be enriched and used as an iodine source in human nutrition. 2. Two experiments were performed, one with KI and one with Ca(IO 3) 2. For each experiment 288 one day old chicks were divided into 4 groups (72 birds / group) and fed on diets with staggered iodine supplementations between 0 and 5 mg I/kg feed. The birds were fattened 5 weeks at standard conditions. Six birds per group were slaughtered on the 35 th experimental day to take samples of the blood, thyroid gland, liver, pectoral and thigh meat. <b>Fattening</b> and <b>slaughter</b> performance were evaluated. The iodine concentrations were measured via Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). The level of statistical significance was P < 0. 05. 3. The treatment with iodine did not affect the <b>fattening</b> and <b>slaughter</b> performance of the broiler chickens. In all investigated fractions the iodine concentrations increased significantly with increasing iodine intake of the animals. The lowest iodine concentrations were measured in the meat, while they were considerably higher in blood serum, liver and thyroid gland. Since the iodine content of meat was still low in the highest supplemented group (highest median concentration: 67. 8 µg I/kg thigh meat), there is no evidence that this could improve iodine supply in human nutrition substantially...|$|R
