25|$|Her {{place on}} the Kenyan world cross country team looked {{uncertain}} in 2009 as head coach Julius Kirwa dismissed her chances, saying she had run too many races that season. Cherono replied by taking the lead immediately at the Kenyan Trials and winning the junior race {{by a margin of}} thirteen seconds. At the 2009 World Cross Country Championships in Amman, Cherono engaged in a race-long duel with Genzebe Dibaba in the junior race. Cherono took the lead in the final stages but a difficult stretch with a 40-metre climb enabled Dibaba to overtake her and Cherono ended up with the silver medal. At the 2009 African Junior Athletics Championships, Cherono eased to the 3000m title by some 13 seconds but found herself beaten again by Genzebe Dibaba in 5000m race, finishing with the silver medal. She competed on the senior track circuit that year and was third at the Rieti IAAF Grand Prix, recording a personal best of 8:44.67 for the 3000m. She took third for a second time at the Memorial van Damme in September, recording personal bests in the 1500 metres and 2000 metres and beaten only by reigning world champions Gelete <b>Burka</b> and Vivian Cheruiyot.|$|E

On 10 November, they moved on Esdudthe ancient Ashdodopposed by Turkish cavalry {{to the north and}} east of the town. By 10:00, they had secured the Jisr Esdud stone bridge over the Wadi Sukereir in front of the village. However, they were confronted by a strong Turkish defence line stretching from Beit Duras to El Butani el Gharbiye and to the mouth of the Wadi Sukereir. Not having the numbers to break the line, the brigade dug in to wait for the infantry to catch up. On 11 November, the brigade left Esdud to secure the area along the Wadi Sukereir between the bridge and the sea. They subsequently located an ample supply of fresh water and a beach suitable for landing supplies from the sea. The 2nd Light Horse Regiment advanced towards the bridge, while the 1st Light Horse Regiment moved to the left and at <b>Burka</b> they established a line of defence along the Wadi el Khubb facing north-east. Under fire, the 2nd Light Horse Regiment crossed the bridge and gradually forced the Turkish rearguard back. By nightfall, they had occupied the Tel el Murre mound and established a substantial bridgehead over the Sukereir at the Esdud bridge towards Burkha.|$|E

500|$|Amid the War on Terror {{and threat}} from Al Qaeda, Livingstone sought to build closer {{ties to the}} London's Muslim community, {{controversially}} agreeing to meet with Islamist groups like the Muslim Association of Britain alongside moderate organisations. In July 2004, he attended a conference discussing France's ban on the <b>burka</b> at which he talked alongside Islamist cleric Yusuf al-Qaradawi. Livingstone described al-Qaradawi as [...] "one of the most authoritative Muslim scholars in the world today" [...] and argued that his influence could help stop the radicalisation of young British Muslims. The move was controversial, with Jewish and LGBT organisations criticising Livingstone, citing al-Qaradawi's record of anti-Semitic and homophobic remarks, with the meeting leading to a publicised argument between Livingstone and his former supporter Peter Tatchell. Livingstone continued to champion the Palestinian cause in the Israel-Palestine conflict, in March 2005 accusing Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon of being a [...] "war criminal" [...] responsible for the 1982 Sabra and Shatila massacre.|$|E

500|$|During {{the evening}} of 19 September and early the next morning, Ross Smith in the Handley-Page bombed the Jenin aerodrome and railway station, leaving the aerodrome looking like [...] "a rubbish-heap". A second dawn patrol {{reported}} a column of about 200 vehicles spread along [...] of the Wady el Fara road moving from Nablus {{in the direction of}} the Jisr ed Damieh bridge. This column was bombed by Bristol Fighters, three making [...] "direct hits" [...] on transport, which blocked the road. Another five bombs were dropped on this target as well as machine gun fire which [...] "created mayhem." [...] Early morning reconnaissance flights reported the effects of the previous day's bombing, in particular between Anebta and Deir Sheraf, where all Ottoman camps were either burnt or empty. From this region northwards, Ottoman troops were seen retreating along the road and railway towards Jenin. At Messudie railway station two trains were being loaded and from <b>Burka</b> northwards the road was full of carts, camels and soldiers. Afulah was a blackened wreck after 24 hours of bombing. Here four trains of carriages without engines were in the station and at the aerodrome four aircraft being prepared for flight were bombed.|$|E
500|$|The {{concert was}} divided into four parts: Equestrian, Bedouin, GlamPunk and Disco. The Equestrian segment of the show began with images of Madonna, riding crop in hand, and horses cantering across windswept plains on the big screens. A giant disco ball was then lowered onstage, and opened like a flower bud to reveal Madonna inside. As she took her dancers' reins, she {{performed}} [...] "Future Lovers/I Feel Love". This was followed by [...] "Get Together" [...] backed by her dancers in horse reins. She rode a carousel horse-like dancepole during [...] "Like a Virgin". The backdrops displayed the X-Ray of Madonna's broken bones, which she had during a previous accident. [...] "Jump" [...] followed this performance, where the dancers displayed the physical discipline parkour. After Madonna disappeared backstage, three of her dancers then revealed personal tragedies during an interlude called [...] "Confessions". The second segment titled Bedouin started with Madonna appearing on a mirrored crucifix to sing [...] "Live to Tell" [...] as a death toll of African AIDS victims counted down onscreen above her. She stepped down off the cross to perform [...] "Forbidden Love" [...] where two male dancers intertwined each other while displaying religious symbolism on the screens like blood corpuscles connecting to form symbols of hope and unity. Madonna brought a guest vocalist from her Confessions on a Dance Floor album onstage for [...] "Isaac", when a female dancer in an oversized Middle-Eastern <b>burka</b> danced within a cage with the backdrops displaying sand dunes. Madonna then recreated the dance-off scene from her [...] "Sorry" [...] music video live with her troupe for her performance of the song. The performance {{was followed by the}} song [...] "Like It Or Not" [...] where burlesque-style dancing was performed by Madonna {{with the help of a}} chair as a prop. After the performance, her dancers performed krump dancing for a remix interlude of [...] "Sorry" [...] as social, political, and ecological images flashed onscreens.|$|E
