40|$|The authors {{examined}} intrapersonal {{variation in}} consumer susceptibility to normative influence {{as a key}} mediator of wine brand choice. On {{the basis of a}} consumer sample, the authors found that individual values and social identity complexity affect consumer susceptibility to normative influence with downstream effects on (a) which <b>brand</b> <b>benefits</b> consumers desire in wine and (b) choice. Individuals higher on internal values and with more complex social identities were less susceptible to normative influence and placed less emphasis on social <b>brand</b> <b>benefits.</b> Separate examinations of consumption scenarios with and without salient reference groups showed that reference group salience interacts with personal values and social identity complexity in affecting consumer susceptibility to normative influence, which in turn affects which <b>brand</b> <b>benefits</b> consumers desire and consequently choice.

40|$|International audienceThe {{purpose of}} this paper is to develop a scale {{measuring}} consumers’ <b>brand</b> <b>benefits</b> in less developed economies. Based on the literature, items have been generated in qualitative and quantitative studies and tested by using exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. The findings show that <b>brand</b> <b>benefits</b> converge into a two-factor structure (functional and symbolic) instead of three (functional, experiential and symbolic). These findings can be justified by the fact that consumers in developing economies do not have as much experience with brands as the ones from developed economies. The results also relate to previous literature findings on the topic of utilitarian and affective brand relationships. This scale can be used to advance the domain of <b>brand</b> <b>benefits</b> in a cross-cultural environment and can be employed by marketers when businesses plan to brand their products in developed economies...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} how manufacturers' <b>brands</b> <b>benefit</b> retailers and how these benefits affect retailer evaluations of the brand. Design/methodology/approach – The researchers develop a conceptual framework, from a literature review and qualitative interviews, which outlines the <b>benefits</b> of manufacturers' <b>brands</b> for retailers. A series of hypotheses tests the effects of these <b>brand</b> <b>benefits</b> on retailer <b>brand</b> attitudes. Data are collected using a survey of supermarket category buyers and analysed with structural equation modelling in order to validate this framework. Findings – Manufacturers' <b>brands</b> deliver four <b>benefits</b> to retailers: financial, manufacturer support, meeting customers' expectations and <b>brand</b> equity. Financial <b>benefits</b> and customer expectations have a stronger effect on retailer satisfaction with the brand compared to manufacturer support and brand equity. Retailer satisfaction with the brand is an antecedent to the retailer assessment of brand performance as well as trust and commitment of the brand. An alternative model shows that brand equity influences retailer commitment to the brand and that financial benefits affect retailer performance assessment of the brand. Practical implications – Manufacturers should think of their brands as channel resources when dealing with retail buyers, and need to consider how to best utilise these four <b>brand</b> <b>benefits</b> to encourage channel support. Originality/value – This study proposes a conceptual model and measures the influence of manufacturer <b>brand</b> <b>benefits</b> on longer term retailer attitudes towards the brand, which research has not previously addressed.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effect of}} irrelevant information presented in marketing communications by a celebrity co-branding partner on consumer judgments of a partner brand. Three experimental conditions manipulate the relevancy of information: relevant information, irrelevant information, and relevant plus irrelevant information. Findings from {{this study suggest that}} when a celebrity co-branding partner does not provide information about the partner <b>brand</b> nor <b>brand</b> <b>benefits,</b> consumer judgments in the ability of the partner <b>brand</b> to deliver <b>benefits,</b> their purchase intent and their match-up perceptions become less positive. Consumer <b>brand</b> <b>benefit</b> beliefs and purchase intentions show evidence of a dilution effect only when consumers perceive a mismatch between the celebrity and brand and when presented with irrelevant information supplied by a celebrity in addition to relevant brand information. Interestingly, not only the relevant celebrity characteristics associated with the brand but also the irrelevant information provided by the celebrity in the advertisement influence perceptions of match-up or congruence. Brand managers should ensure a celebrity co-branding partner does not provide irrelevant brand information within advertisements to avoid <b>brand</b> <b>benefit</b> belief, purchase intent and match-up dilution. 1 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The aim of {{the paper}} {{is to develop a}} {{conceptual}} framework that explores the sources of manufacturer <b>brand</b> <b>benefits</b> for resellers. Design/methodology/approach – The paper reports a qualitative investigation where packaged goods resellers were interviewed about the <b>benefits</b> of manufacturer <b>brands</b> for their businesses. The qualitative data is analysed to develop several research propositions about the role of brands in reseller B 2 B relationships. Findings – A conceptual framework is developed that shows that manufacturers' brands provide financial, customer and managerial benefits for resellers. These benefits have an impact on reseller relationship outcomes with the manufacturer's brand, which include satisfaction, dependence, cooperation, commitment and trust. Practical implications – The conceptual framework provides a model that manufacturers of both major and minor brands can use to understand and manage these <b>brand</b> <b>benefits</b> in order to enhance the relationship outcomes with resellers. Originality/value – The paper responds to a need for empirical research to understand the role that brands play in channel relationships. It presents a conceptual framework that links manufacturer <b>brand</b> <b>benefits</b> to reseller relationship outcomes. The framework also includes major and minor brands as moderating variables and thus provides a basis for further quantitative research...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: This study {{examines}} {{the effect of}} irrelevant celebrity co-branding partner information presented in advertisements on consumer brand judgments. Brand unrelated information carried by a celebrity co-branding partner is arguably irrelevant to consumer judgment formation and perhaps more so when {{the image of the}} celebrity is incongruent with that of the brand. Originality: Irrelevant information presented by a well-known comedian, Jerry Seinfeld, in a current campaign with a financial institution, the Greater Building Society, may cause a weakening effect on consumer <b>brand</b> <b>benefit</b> beliefs, attitudes and purchase intentions. Key literature/theoretical perspective: The social and non-social judgment literature recognises that the use of irrelevant information results in less extreme judgements (dilution). Design/methodology/approach: A 2 x 4 experimental design manipulated information relevancy and celebrity-brand match-up. Findings: A dilution effect on consumer <b>brand</b> <b>benefit</b> beliefs, attitudes and purchase intentions was identified with the addition of irrelevant information provided by a celebrity co-branding partner. Results show that both information relevancy and celebrity-brand match-up influence consumer <b>brand</b> <b>benefit</b> beliefs and purchase intentions, whereas only match-up information is used in the formation of brand attitudes. An incongruent and irrelevant celebrity co-branding partner results in decreased consumer judgements compared to an irrelevant yet matched celebrity brand partner. Research limitations/implications: As this study focused on one television advertisement with a specific celebrity and co-branding partner, future research should be extended to explore other mediums and other co-branding situations. Practical and Social implications: Brand managers should strategically place a relevant celebrity co-branding partner, a congruent celebrity who presents relevant brand related information, within their advertisements to avoid <b>brand</b> <b>benefit</b> belief and purchase intent dilution. 2 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Recessions {{affect the}} timing of {{retirement}} through two channels, a weaker job market and losses in household wealth. The two phenomena have opposite effects. A weaker economy causes employers to increase permanent job separations and reduce new hires, accelerating retirements that would otherwise have occurred later. Falling household wealth reduces the resources available to pay for retirement, discouraging older workers from leaving the workforce. We use aggregate and micro-census data on old-age labor supply as well as time series data on unemployment, stock and bond returns, and house appreciation to estimate business cycle effects on Social Security <b>benefit</b> <b>acceptance</b> and labor force exit. Trailing real stock and bond returns and house price appreciation have statistically significant but very small effects on old-age labor force participation. High prime-age unemployment has only a small impact on <b>benefit</b> <b>acceptance</b> and labor force participation among older women, but the effects on older men are greater. We estimate that the 4. 6 percentage-point increase in prime-age unemployment between 2007 and 2009 reduced the participation rate of 60 - 74 year-old men by between 0. 8 and 1. 7 percentage points. This effect has offset the impact of declining household wealth on old-age labor force participation. ...|$|R

40|$|The brand {{management}} literature focuses on differentiation of <b>brand</b> <b>benefits.</b> However, associative network theory {{has taught us}} that associations do not have independent meaning, but receive its content from surrounding nodes, i. e. secondary associations. Thus, we must study secondary <b>brand</b> <b>benefit</b> associations (SBBAs) {{in order to learn}} more about differentiation. We compared the SBBAs of preferred and acceptable brands using a randomized 4 (car-, beer-, grocery store- and clothing store categories) x 2 (preferred- and acceptable brands) factorial between subjects design. Furthermore, we investigated whether the same effects apply for products and services, thus providing a new and important contribution to the research on differentiation. The experiment was conducted online, with a sample of 818 current and former students at the Norwegian School of Economics. In accordance with the traditional view on brand differentiation, our experiment only investigated SBBAs with positive valence. We focused on four dimensions of differentiation: The first is the number of positive SBBAs. Secondly, instrumental differentiation is specific evidence for why a brand is better than the competitors on a driver. Finally, graded differentiation is to what extent a secondary association is shared with other brands, where dichotomous differentiation implies that it is solely connected to the brand. The results of our main study show that preferred brands had a higher number of positive SBBAs for both products and services. While only services had preferred brands with a higher score on instrumental- and graded differentiation. We also used regression analyses to test whether our differentiation dimensions could explain any variance in evaluations of <b>brand</b> <b>benefits.</b> Results showed that instrumental differentiation had a positive effect for product brands, whereas graded differentiation had a positive effect for service brands. The number of positive SBBAs had a positive effect for all brands, hence supporting the traditional view on brand differentiation. nhhma...|$|R

40|$|Component sharing {{may look}} {{great in the}} boardroom, {{but not in the}} showroom. Indeed, savings on R&D and {{production}} costs could be offset by a plunge in customer brand attractiveness. Combining experimental with econometric studies, this paper investigates the impact of component sharing on customer evaluation of luxury, volume and economy brands offered in a car manufacturer’s vertical product line. An experimental study shows that the evaluation of luxury brands sharing with a volume brand suffers more than when a volume brand shares components with an economy brand. The evaluation of an economy <b>brand</b> <b>benefits</b> more from sharing with a volume brand than a volume brand suffers from sharing with an economy brand. The magnitude of these effects depends on several factors, such as component type, the source of the component sharing and the salience of component sharing to the consumers. The explorative examination of market share effects confirms that luxury brands may suffer, while economy <b>brands</b> may <b>benefit</b> from component sharing. The first to look at the consumer impact of component sharing, this paper sets up a rich agenda for future research.
