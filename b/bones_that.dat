5|$|Odobenidae {{consists}} {{of only one}} living member: the modern walrus. This animal is easily distinguished from other extant pinnipeds by its larger size (exceeded only by the elephant seals), nearly hairless skin and long upper canines, known as tusks. Like otariids, walruses are capable of turning their hind-flippers forward and can walk on land. When moving in water, the walrus relies on its hind-flippers for locomotion, while its fore-flippers are used for steering. In addition, the walrus lacks external ear flaps. Walruses have pterygoid <b>bones</b> <b>that</b> are broad and thick, frontal <b>bones</b> <b>that</b> are V-shaped at the anterior end and calcaneuses with pronounced tuberosity in the middle.|$|E
5|$|Each {{hemisphere}} is conventionally {{divided into}} four lobes; the frontal lobe, parietal lobe, temporal lobe, and occipital lobe, named according to the skull <b>bones</b> <b>that</b> overlie them. Each lobe is associated {{with one or two}} specialised functions though there is some functional overlap between them.|$|E

5|$|Middle ear - In crown-group mammals, {{sound is}} carried from the eardrum by {{a chain of}} three bones, the malleus, the incus and the stapes. Ancestrally, the malleus and the incus are derived from the {{articular}} and the quadrate <b>bones</b> <b>that</b> constituted the jaw joint of early therapsids.|$|E
5|$|The dentary {{gradually}} became the main bone {{of the lower}} jaw which, by the Triassic, progressed towards the fully mammalian jaw (the lower consisting only of the dentary) and middle ear (which is constructed by the <b>bones</b> <b>that</b> were previously used to construct the jaws of reptiles).|$|E
5|$|Modern {{evidence}} indicates that even non-avian dinosaurs and birds thrived in cooler temperate climates, and {{that at least some}} early species must have regulated their body temperature by internal biological means (aided by the animals' bulk in large species and feathers or other body coverings in smaller species). Evidence of endothermy in Mesozoic dinosaurs includes the discovery of polar dinosaurs in Australia and Antarctica as well as analysis of blood-vessel structures within fossil <b>bones</b> <b>that</b> are typical of endotherms. Scientific debate continues regarding the specific ways in which dinosaur temperature regulation evolved.|$|E

5|$|Temnospondyl larvae {{are often}} {{distinguished}} by poorly developed bones {{and the presence}} of a hyobranchial apparatus, a series of <b>bones</b> <b>that</b> gills would attach to in life. However, some fully mature temnospondyls also possess hyobranchial bones but did not have external gills. A dense covering of scales is also seen in larvae and adults. Major body changes occur in metamorphosis, including the reshaping and strengthening of skull bones, the thickening of postcranial bones, and an increase in body size.|$|E
5|$|The {{caudal fin}} is homocercal, meaning {{the upper and}} lower lobes are about equal in size. The spine ends at the caudal peduncle, the base of the caudal fin, {{distinguishing}} this group from those in which the spine extends into the upper lobe of the caudal fin, such as most fish from the Paleozoic (541 to 252 million years ago). The neural arches are elongated to form uroneurals which provide support for this upper lobe. In addition, the hypurals, <b>bones</b> <b>that</b> form a flattened plate at the posterior end of the vertebral column, are enlarged providing further support for the caudal fin.|$|E

What they disclosed to us was a hanging corpse in the dark, pretty far away and without much detail. And yet, when you bring a torch up to the hanging corpse in the actual game, {{you can see that}} it's very mutilated with lots of blood and <b>bones.</b> <b>That</b> was a very different depiction, far more intense, far more extreme than what had been disclosed to us.|$|E

5|$|C. lepophagus was {{a similar}} in weight to modern coyotes, but had shorter limb <b>bones</b> <b>that</b> {{indicates}} a less cursorial lifestyle. The coyote represents a more primitive form of Canis than the gray wolf, {{as shown by}} its relatively small size and its comparatively narrow skull and jaws, which lack the grasping power necessary to hold the large prey in which wolves specialize. This is further corroborated by the coyote's sagittal crest, which is low or totally flattened, thus indicating a weaker bite than the wolf's. The coyote is not a specialized carnivore as the wolf is, {{as shown by the}} larger chewing surfaces on the molars, reflecting the species' relative dependence on vegetable matter. In these respects, the coyote resembles the fox-like progenitors of the genus more so than the wolf.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, English ornithologist Daniel T. Holyoak {{described}} {{some small}} parrot <b>bones</b> <b>that</b> {{he had discovered}} among a collection of broad-billed parrot (Lophopsittacus mauritianus) subfossils in the Zoology Museum of Cambridge University. These remains had been collected by Louis Etienne Thirioux in the early 20th century, who had found them in a cave on Le Pouce mountain, on the Mascarene island of Mauritius. They {{were placed in the}} zoology museum by 1908. Apart from their size and robustness, Holyoak did not find the bones to be distinct from those of the Mascarene parrot genera Lophopsittacus, Mascarinus (the Mascarene parrot), Necropsittacus (the Rodrigues parrot), and Psittacula (which had two or three other species inhabiting the Mascarene islands). Because of their similarities, Holyoak considered all these genera to be closely related.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the first}} details noted about Iguanodon was that it had the teeth of a herbivorous reptile, {{although}} there {{has not always been}} consensus on how it ate. As Mantell noted, the remains he was working with were unlike any modern reptile, especially in the toothless, scoop-shaped form of the lower jaw symphysis, which he found best compared to that of the two-toed sloth and the extinct ground sloth Mylodon. He also suggested that Iguanodon had a prehensile tongue which could be used to gather food, like a giraffe. More complete remains have shown this to be an error; for example, the hyoid <b>bones</b> <b>that</b> supported the tongue are heavily built, implying a muscular, non-prehensile tongue used for moving food around in the mouth. The giraffe-tongue idea has also been incorrectly attributed to Dollo via a broken lower jaw.|$|E

5|$|Oryzomys albiventer is a {{large and}} long-tailed Oryzomys. The upperparts are brightly ochraceous, {{becoming}} grayer toward the front. The hairs on the underparts are pale gray near the bases and white in the outer half, so that the underparts appear pale grayish according to Carleton and Arroyo-Cabrales (not white as claimed by Merriman). The tail is dark above and light below. The skull and molars are relatively robust. O.albiventer has broad zygomatic arches (cheekbones), long incisive foramina (perforations of the palate between the incisors and the molars), and long nasal <b>bones</b> <b>that</b> extend behind the premaxillary bones. Compared to its lowland relative O.couesi mexicanus, O.albiventer is larger and more brightly colored and has larger molars but narrower incisive foramina.|$|E
5|$|The Field Museum of Natural History (FMNH) also {{conducted}} excavations {{south of the}} town of Emery from 2009 to 2010, with permits from the Utah Geological Survey. These excavations were conducted in a site discovered by Akiko Shinya in 2008, FMNH locality UT080821-1, which has been named Akiko's Site in her honor. During the excavations, 167 disarticulated but closely associated elements were collected in two plaster jackets. One of these plaster jackets, containing elements from the hip and vertebrae, was given the specimen number FMNH PR 3847; the specimen was subsequently described by McDonald along with Terry Gates, Lindsay Zanno, and Peter Makovicky in 2017. Another locality discovered by the FMNH is the Triple Peak quarry, FMNH locality UT130904-2, which contains a bonebed of over 400 juvenile <b>bones</b> <b>that</b> belong to at least four individuals.|$|E
5|$|The {{middle ear}} lies between the outer ear {{and the inner}} ear. It {{consists}} of an air-filled cavity called the tympanic cavity and includes the three ossicles and their attaching ligaments; the auditory tube; and the round and oval windows. The ossicles are three small <b>bones</b> <b>that</b> function together to receive, amplify, and transmit the sound from the eardrum to the inner ear. The ossicles are the malleus (hammer), incus (anvil), and the stapes (stirrup). The stapes is the smallest named bone in the body. The middle ear also connects to the upper throat at the nasopharynx via the pharyngeal opening of the Eustachian tube.|$|E

5|$|The skull {{had a pair}} of horns {{above and}} in front of the eyes. These horns were {{composed}} of extensions of the lacrimal bones, and varied in shape and size. There were also lower paired ridges running along the top edges of the nasal <b>bones</b> <b>that</b> led into the horns. The horns were probably covered in a keratin sheath and may have had a variety of functions, including acting as sunshades for the eye, being used for display, and being used in combat against other members of the same species (although they were fragile). There was a ridge along the back of the skull roof for muscle attachment, as is also seen in tyrannosaurids.|$|E
5|$|While most temnospondyls are aquatic {{in early}} stages of life, most metoposaurids {{appear to have been}} {{terrestrial}} in their juvenile stage. Like other Mesozoic temnospondyls, adult metoposaurids were adapted to a semiaquatic lifestyle. Their bones are not highly developed for movement on land. The cross-sectional thickness of limb bones in adult metoposaurids shows that they could not withstand the stress of terrestrial locomotion. Juvenile individuals have <b>bones</b> <b>that</b> are thick enough to withstand this stress, and could probably move about on land. To maintain a terrestrial lifestyle, a temnospondyl's limb bones would have to thicken with positive allometry, meaning that they would grow at a greater rate {{than the rest of the}} body. This is not the case in metoposaurids, meaning that as their bodies grew larger they became less adapted toward a terrestrial lifestyle.|$|E
5|$|As {{for other}} lambeosaurines, it is {{believed}} that the cranial crest of Parasaurolophus changed with age and was a sexually dimorphic characteristic in adults. James Hopson, one of the first researchers to describe lambeosaurine crests in terms of such distinctions, suggested that P. cyrtocristatus, with its small crest, was the female form of P. tubicen. Thomas Williamson suggested it was the juvenile form. Neither hypothesis became widely accepted. As only six good skulls, one juvenile braincase, and one recently discovered juvenile skull are known, additional material will help clear up these potential relationships. Williamson noted that in any case, juvenile Parasaurolophus probably had small, rounded crests like P. cyrtocristatus, that probably grew faster as individuals approached sexual maturity. Recent restudy of a juvenile braincase previously assigned to Lambeosaurus, now assigned to Parasaurolophus, provides evidence that a small tubular crest was present in juveniles. This specimen preserves a small upward flaring of the frontal <b>bones</b> <b>that</b> was similar to but smaller than what is seen in adult specimens; in adults, the frontals formed a platform that supported the base of the crest. This specimen also indicates that the growth of the crest in Parasaurolophus and the facial profile of juvenile individuals differed from the Corythosaurus-Hypacrosaurus-Lambeosaurus model, in part because the crest of Parasaurolophus lacks the thin bony 'coxcomb' that makes up the upper portion of the crest of the other three lambeosaurines.|$|E
