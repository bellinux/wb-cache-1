The objective of debt management is raising resources from the market at minimum cost while containing the risks, while that of the monetary authority is to achieve price stability. In the years preceding the financial crisis of 2008, separation of debt and monetary management was a settled norm and a number of countries with liberalized financial markets and high levels of government debt sought to adopt professional debt management techniques to save cost and to provide policy signals to the market. Separation of debt management is essential to preserve the integrity and independence of the central bank, to ensure transparency and accountability, and to improve debt management by entrusting it to portfolio managers with expertise in modern risk management techniques. In India, debt is managed by the central and state governments, and the RBI. The separation of debt management would provide focus to the task of asset-liability management of government liabilities, undertake risk analysis and also help the government to prioritize public expenditure through higher awareness of interest costs. The separation would also be helpful for the <b>borrowing</b> <b>programme</b> which would have to be completed without the support of the regulatory or supervisory authority. This may lead to widening of investor base and market friendly yield curve. But after the great financial recession of 2008, the issue has re-emerged as in many countries, especially the advanced economies, the scope of fiscal operations was expanded, and the debt to GDP ratios have increased substantially. Similarly, in view of the sensitiveness of the issue, especially amidst less developed financial markets, there has been some re-thinking on the issue; in India, the Reserve Bank has also been re-thinking the separation issue and seems reluctant given the present context of the economy...|$|E
40|$|The study {{examines}} the theoretical considerations and empirical {{results of the}} switch to market borrowing, i. e. bond financing of the fiscal deficit, with correspondingly low monetisation, as part of India’s structural reforms initiated in 1991. It basically concludes that despite the sharp deterioration in State finances and persistently large market <b>borrowing</b> <b>programme</b> of the Centre, the move to market borrowings to finance the deficit {{is proving to be}} beneficial when viewed in relation to broader movements in the major fiscal variables over time. The study makes a clear distinction between the consequences of borrowing at market interest rates versus those of non-market liabilities. In preference to recent econometric approaches to test the Government’s long run debt profile, the study proposes a simple necessary condition, popularly known as the Domar condition, to evaluate the prospects for debt stability under which GDP growth should exceed the interest rate on Government debt. Based on the premises that in the long run, {{it is not possible to}} trade growth for inflation (although such a trade off may be possible in the short run) and that the central bank is unable to influence real variables (real output and real interest rates) in the long run, the study simulates different short and long run consequences of alternative combinations of bond and money financing of budget deficits on interest rates, growth, inflation, the debt-to-GDP ratio and measures of the interest burden. Empirical evaluation of the Domar debt-stability condition reveals that Central Government debt, under certain assumptions, may remain stable at prevailing levels of the primary deficit and monetised deficit. High administered rates in the Small Savings and Provident Fund Schemes, i. e., due to non-market based borrowing, however, pose problems for debt sustainability in future. The study argues that bond financing of the fiscal deficit has contributed to fiscal consolidation by inducing the Government to reduce primary expenditures. This conclusion holds even for the combined finances of the Central and State Governments. Robust evidence indicates that non-government borrowing costs have come down relative to those of the Government, and credit conditions for non-government borrowers are now easier, after the move to bond finance. Further, some evidence suggests that private capital formation has surged in recent years, contradicting the view that the anti-inflation policy of bond finance has crowded out private investment and adversely affected growth. However, the stability in market debt notwithstanding, the overall fiscal situation is critical because of potential instability in non-market debt and due to unfunded and contingent liabilities of the Central and State Governments. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{states were}} {{disadvantaged}} by joining the Federation in 1901. They surrendered their incomes derived mainly from customs and excise {{to the new}} Commonwealth and received back 75 per cent of it. But after 1910 that amount was withdrawn {{and they had to}} accept 25 shillings per head. The loans they had been accustomed to raise since the 1880 s either locally or in London assisted in keeping their economies afloat through providing employment on various public works programmes. But the war removed even that thin line of support as the Commonwealth took over aBloan raisings to fund the war. Most states other than NSW agreed not to raise loans causing an increase in the numbers of unemployed. In {{the early stages of the}} war, funds were lent by Britain to the Commonwealth to assist in war mobilisation some of which was lent to the states. The British funds were not sent to Australia; a credit was created in the Commonwealth Bank in London and, to the horror of orthodox economists, additional notes were printed by the Treasury 2 ̆ 7 s Note Issuing Branch in Australia with a promise that they would be redeemed at the end of the war. The Commonwealth established a war-time loan council to distribute these British funds and raise new loans in Australia. NSW continued to raise loans in London, much to the Commonwealth 2 ̆ 7 s annoyance, because it wished to maintain strong employment levels through its public works programme. The war cost nearly £ 400 million and the Hughes National government in 1920 sought to re-establish this loan council as a measure for assisting in the loan renewals and repayments. The Commonwealth wished to have the states avoid conducting their <b>borrowing</b> <b>programmes</b> when the Commonwealth was renewing its war-time loans. Hughes was replaced by S. M. Bruce in January 1923 and Dr Earle Page became his Treasurer. They embarked on a programme to curtail the borrowings by the states. They argued that money invested by private corporations was done more efficiently and effectively than if a government invested the same money in infrastructural developments.

40|$|Abstract Genes {{expressed}} both {{in normal}} testis and in malignancies (Cancer/ Testis associated genes – CTA) {{have become the}} most extensively studied antigen group {{in the field of}} tumour immunology. Despite this, many fundamentally important questions remain unanswered: what is the connection between germ-cell specific genes and tumours? Is the expression of these genes yet another proof for the importance of genome destabilisation in the process of tumorigenesis?, or maybe activation of these genes is not quite random but instead related to some programme giving tumours a survival advantage? This review collates most of the recent information available about CTAs expression, function, and regulation. The data suggests a programme related to ontogenesis, mostly to gametogenesis. In the "brain-storming" part, facts in conflict with the hypothesis of random CTA gene activation are discussed. We propose a <b>programme</b> <b>borrowed</b> from organisms phylogenetically much older than humans, which existed before the differentiation of sexes. It is a programme that has served as a life cycle with prominent ploidy changes, and from which, as we know, the germ-cell ploidy cycle – meiosis – has evolved.

While India's 93–124-mile (150–250km) range Prithvi missile is not {{derived from the}} Indian space programme, the intermediate range Agni missile is drawn from the Indian space programme's SLV-3. In its early years, when headed by Vikram Sarabhai and Satish Dhawan, ISRO opposed military applications for its dual-use projects such as the SLV-3. Eventually, however, the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) based missile <b>programme</b> <b>borrowed</b> human resources and technology from ISRO. Missile scientist A.P.J. Abdul Kalam (elected president of India in 2002), who had headed the SLV-3 project at ISRO, moved to DRDO to direct India's missile programme. About a dozen scientists accompanied Kalam from ISRO to DRDO, where he designed the Agni missile using the SLV-3's solid fuel first stage and a liquid-fuel (Prithvi-missile-derived) second stage. The IRS and INSAT satellites were primarily intended and used for civilian-economic applications, but they also offered military spin-offs. In 1996 New Delhi's Ministry of Defence temporarily blocked the use of IRS-1C by India's environmental and agricultural ministries to monitor ballistic missiles near India's borders.

40|$|D. Phil. This thesis {{presents}} an intervention programme {{that aims to}} facilitate anger-expression and takes psychosocial and immunological variables into account. The present research argues that if {{the effects of the}} programme are validated, similar programmes may yield similar benefits for other participants in future intervention programmes in a South African context. The nature, course and effects of the HIV disease are described and include specific processes and mechanisms of influence in physical, mental and social terms. Biological processes that result from immunological deficiencies causing AIDS are analyzed and an explication of disease progression is offered. Psychological and social aspects related to immune-system deterioration carry implications for patients and influence their prognosis. The research was conducted {{in the context of a}} biopsychosocial conceptualization and was aimed at reducing levels of anger and helping establish recourses in the patients to manage infection and disease, as well as improve or at least retard decrements in immunological functioning. The goal of this intervention programme was to reduce levels of anger, anxiety, depression and social isolation. This would in turn increase the participant's personal sense of self-control, self-efficacy and self-esteem. Changes in these factors would help retard the overall HIV disease progression. An intervention programme was tailored to address the specific needs of HIV- infected patients. The group intervention was focused in such a way that relevant psychological, behavioural and social aspects were addressed. The <b>programme</b> <b>borrowed</b> and used aspects of different models and reformulated an intervention that would best address the specific needs of the participants. It was possible to isolate specific problems and focus the intervention on these specific areas, such as depression, anger, social isolation and hopelessness. For example, it was possible to take into account the participants' low self-efficacy and problems related to a lack of interpersonal coping skills and develop the participants' confidence and assertiveness (Antoni, 1991...|$|R
40|$|Research {{overview}} Area of focus/rationale for {{the study}} This study is an evaluation of an intervention, named Thrive, {{which is designed to}} promote the emotional development of children with Emotional and Behavioural Difficulties (EBD). The focus is to investigate the extent to which Thrive is effective in improving certain emotional and behavioural outcomes for children as well as exploring the experiences of those who are involved with the programme. The study is set out in two papers. Paper one assesses changes in pupil emotional well being over time using two subscales designed to measure specific aspects of resiliency, namely, â 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 8 emotional reactivityâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 and â 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 8 sense of relatednessâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9. It also uses an assessment to measure changes in emotional and social skills which are considered important in order for pupils to engage in learning in a mainstream classroom environment (readiness to learn). Paper one also looks at the possible association between the Thrive training and staff attitudes towards pupils with EBD. Paper two explores, in depth, the experiences of the Thrive approach {{from the perspective of a}} small sample of school staff, pupils and parents. This process of exploration serves to better understand the outcomes from paper one by identifying a number of factors which may contribute to the successful or unsuccessful implementation of Thrive in a particular educational context. Context, Background and Research Objectives Broad labels of â 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 8 Emotional and Behavioural Difficultiesâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 (EBD) andâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 Behavioural Emotional and Social Difficultiesâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 (BESD) tend to encompass behaviour which interferes with a childâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 s own or otherâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 s learning; signs of emotional turbulence; and difficulties in forming and maintaining relationships. SEBD is used interchangeably with BESD (Behavioural, Emotional and Social Difficulties) in policy documents and theoretical writing (Evans, 2010). Schools tend to use the term EBD and this will generally refer to children whose behaviour and emotions prevent them and others from learning to their potential (DCSF, 2008). For ease and consistency I will use the term EBD throughout this study. The Special Needs and Disability Act (2001) sets out the right for children with EBD to be educated in mainstream schools. Due to the disruptive impact on learning for self and others, this group of children have been cited as one of the most difficult groups to include (Evans & Lunt, 2002). Behaviour management continues to be high on the education policy and practice agenda in England and the rest of the UK. Schools are faced with the challenge of finding ways of ensuring children with EBD are included in the ordinary classroom with their peers and to ensure that the needs of this vulnerable group of children are adequately met. Alongside this, Government Policy (e. g. NICE Guidelines, 2007) now requires schools to promote the emotional well-being of children who exhibit signs of emotional and behavioural disturbance. There is a demand for evidence based approaches to support children with EBD in mainstream schools from which professionals, such as Educational Psychologists, can draw on in order to make positive changes (see literature review in Appendix B. 9 for more details). Thrive is a trademarked programme developed by a multidisciplinary team named â 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 8 Fronting the Challengeâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 (ftc). The programme is described as a â 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 8 dynamic developmental approach to working with vulnerable and challenging children whose behaviour interrupts their own and others learningâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9. The Thrive <b>programme</b> <b>borrows</b> from a range of research and theory around neuroscience, child development, attachment theory and the role of creativity and play (for example Sunderland, 2006; Hughs, 2004; Illsey- Clarke & Dawson, 1989; Stern, 2003). It can be described as a school based intervention which is informed by a psychotherapeutic model as it aims to support children by addressing core relational and developmental features (Evans et al., 2003). Similar to nurture groups, Thrive is based on the understanding that for a child to develop a healthy ability to adapt to his or her social environment they must have experienced a sensitive, responsive and caring relationship with a significant carer/parent (Stern, 2003; Sunderland, 2006). But additional to a nurture group approach, the intervention draws on a concept from Transactional Analysis (Berne, 1964; Levin, 1982; Illsley Clarke & Dawson, 1998) which assumes that a child moves through a number of clearly defined stages of emotional development. The Thrive approach uses a computer based assessment, which relies on pupil observations, to identify specific â 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 8 interruptionsâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 in this development; and targeted relational experiences, i. e., experiences of being in relationship with another human being, are recommended to promote further development. This will be discussed in more detail within the introduction of this thesis. As part of a wave two pathfinder for the Targeted Mental Health in Schools (TaMHS) Project under DCSF, in 2009, Thrive training was delivered to staff working with children and young people in three learning communities within a local authority in the South West of England. This included staff from approximately forty schools (including primary schools, secondary schools, a PRU and a special school) as well as multi-disciplinary staff such as CAMHS, Educational Psychologists and Behaviour support staff. At the time of beginning this study, thirty eight primary schools within the local authority had already been trained in Thrive and were implementing the intervention with some of their pupils. There was much testimony from staff working with children and young people that the training was highly valued and influential on their professional practice. Furthermore, there were a number of claims suggesting that pupils involved in Thrive were experiencing a whole range of positive outcomes attributable to the programme. For example, that the most disruptive pupils were calmer and making fewer visits to the Head Teacherâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 s office; that emotionally vulnerable children had become more confident and more trusting; that attendance had improved; and that the number of fixed term exclusions had diminished. Although there were a small number of detailed case studies prepared by schools themselves, the claims were, in the main, based on anecdote. Where schools had made some attempt to measure the impact of Thrive the methodology lacked basic rigour and findings were susceptible to bias; pre and post measurements were very limited and control measures were absent in all cases. The project lead for TaMHS reported â 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 8 emergingâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 data in relation to reduced numbers of fixed term exclusions, reductions in referrals to other services and referrals for statutory assessment. However, the source of this data was also said to be unreliable. Despite all of this, a general positive â 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 8 vibeâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 about the intervention based on a melange of potentially unreliable evidence was persuasive enough for the local authority to consider further investment into the intervention. Further details of current evidence related to the impact of Thrive can be found in Appendix A. 1. Objectives of this study: â 8 ̆ 0 ¢	To provide a more reliable understanding of the effectiveness of the Thrive programme in supporting children with EBD within mainstream primary schools. More specifically: -	To find the extent to which Thrive reduces pupil â 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 8 emotional reactivityâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9, improves pupil â 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 8 sense of relatednessâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 and improves â 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 8 readiness to learn in a mainstream classroomâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9. -	To find whether there is an association between the Thrive training and staff attitudes towards the inclusion of children with EBD in mainstream primary schools. â 8 ̆ 0 ¢	To explore how a small sample of pupils, parents and staff experience Thrive. It is intended that the overall findings will provide an evidence base for practitioners to draw upon when considering appropriate and effective ways of supporting children with EBD in their mainstream primary schools. Using a rigorous methodology, the findings will also give a deeper insight into the ways in which people may interact with and experience the programme, which may help towards a more profound understanding of how the intervention may be operating. Research Questions Paper 1 1) 	Does the implementation of the Thrive programme improve pupil â 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 8 emotional reactivityâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9, pupil â 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 8 sense of relatednessâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 and pupil â 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 8 readiness to learn in a mainstream classroomâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9, over an eight month period? 2) 	Is the effectiveness of the Thrive intervention related to the way in which pupils express their difficulties, i. e. internalised (withdrawn) or externalised (outwardly disruptive) ? 3) 	Does having the Thrive training predict a more positive school ethos towards the inclusion of children with EBD in mainstream primary schools? 4) 	Does having the Thrive training predict greater staff confidence in relation to meeting the needs of children with EBD in mainstream primary schools? Hypotheses related to the above research questions are set out in paper one. Paper 2 What is it like to be part of the Thrive intervention, from the perspective of parent, pupil and school staff? Methodological and Paradigmatic issues: The overall interest for the two studies was to find whether outcomes for pupils who are part of a Thrive programme are favourable, as well as to explore the experiences of pupils, parents and staff in relation to being part of a Thrive programme. It was supposed that by understanding the experiences of being part of a Thrive programme pupil outcomes could be better|$|R
