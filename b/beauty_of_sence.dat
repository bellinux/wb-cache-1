60|$|Wise. You say well, and I {{will add}} {{a word or}} two more to what I have said: Repentance, as it is not {{produced}} without a sight and <b>sence</b> <b>of</b> sin, so every sight and <b>sence</b> <b>of</b> sin cannot produce it: I mean, every sight and <b>sence</b> <b>of</b> sin cannot {160c} produce that Repentance, that is Repentance unto salvation; repentance never to be repented of. For it is yet fresh before us, that Mr. Badman had a sight and <b>sence</b> <b>of</b> sin, in that fit of sickness that he had before, but it dyed without procuring any such godly fruit; as was manifest by his so soon returning with the Dog to his Vomit. Many people think also that Repentance stands in Confession of sin only, but they are very much mistaken: For Repentance, as was said before, is a being sorry for, and a turning from transgression to God by Jesus Christ. Now, if this be true, that every sight and <b>sence</b> <b>of</b> sin will not produce Repentance, then Repentance cannot be produced there where there is no sight and <b>sence</b> <b>of</b> sin. That every sight and <b>sence</b> <b>of</b> sin will not produce repentance, to wit, the godly repentance that we are speaking of, is manifest in Cain, Pharaoh, Saul and Judas, who all <b>of</b> them had <b>sence,</b> great <b>sence</b> <b>of</b> sin, but none of them repentance unto life.|$|R

David did, not only commit sins, but abode impenitent for them, untill Nathan the Prophet was sent from God {{to give him a}} sight and <b>sence</b> <b>of</b> them; {159e} and then, but not till then, he indeed repented of them.
