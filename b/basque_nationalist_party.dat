25|$|Catalan and Basque nationalists {{were not}} univocal. Left-wing Catalan nationalists {{sided with the}} Republicans, while Conservative Catalan nationalists were far less vocal in {{supporting}} the government due to anti-clericalism and confiscations occurring in areas within its control. Basque nationalists, heralded by the conservative <b>Basque</b> <b>Nationalist</b> <b>Party,</b> were mildly supportive of the Republican government, although some in Navarre sided with the uprising {{for the same reasons}} influencing conservative Catalans. Notwithstanding religious matters, Basque nationalists, who were for the most part Catholic, generally sided with the Republicans, although the PNV, <b>Basque</b> <b>nationalist</b> <b>party,</b> was reported passing the plans of Bilbao defenses to the nationalists, in an attempt to reduce the duration and casualties of siege.|$|E

50|$|Leizaola {{became the}} leader of the <b>Basque</b> <b>Nationalist</b> <b>Party's</b> (PNV) Gipuzkoa provincial chapter during the Spanish {{transition}} to democracy. He then served as a member of both the Gipuzkoa Buru Batzar and the Euskadi Buru Batzar from 1968 to 1977.|$|R
25|$|However, in December 2015, the Spanish {{parliamentary}} elections saw {{the rise of}} Podemos (7 MPs) and the <b>Basque</b> <b>Nationalist</b> <b>Party</b> (6 MPs) {{at the expense of}} EH Bildu (2 MPs), while Madrid-based mainstream parties continued their steady decline trend, with the Spanish Conservatives (allied with UPN in Navarre) getting 4 MPs, and the Socialists 4 MPs.|$|E
25|$|During the 2011 Spanish {{parliamentary}} elections, {{the coalition}} Amaiur (former Batasuna plus Eusko Alkartasuna) came up first in parliamentary seats (7) and {{second only to}} UPN-PP (5 seats) in popular vote in the Southern Basque Country, followed closely by the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (5 seats). Geroa Bai secured a seat in Navarre, with the <b>Basque</b> <b>Nationalist</b> <b>Party</b> getting 5 (all from Basque Autonomous Community).|$|E
25|$|The <b>Basque</b> <b>Nationalist</b> <b>Party</b> (EAJ-PNV-PNB) is {{the oldest}} of all {{nationalist}} parties, with over 100 years of history. It is Christian-democrat and has evolved towards rather moderate positions though it still keeps the demand for self-determination and eventual independence. It is the main party in the Basque Autonomous Community (BAC) and is the most voted party (about 40% population), but its presence in Navarre is minor and subsumed in Geroa Bai, while it remains marginal in the French Basque Country.|$|E
5000|$|Politics in Navarre {{has been}} marked by fierce rivalry between <b>Basque</b> <b>nationalist</b> <b>parties</b> on the one side and the {{institutional}} parties, UPN and PSN, on the other. <b>Basque</b> <b>nationalist</b> <b>parties</b> claim that they are excluded from key political posts and institutions, and they point to the intervention of the Madrid government in internal affairs of Navarre. Another complaint involves the ideological profiling of public school Basque language teachers, billed as [...] "ETA supporting teachers". Since the establishment of Navarre's present status (the Amejoramiento, the 'Betterment'), the successive regional governments have been shaken by frequent political instability and corruption scandals. The most stable and longest term in office was held by UPN's Miguel Sanz (2001-2011).|$|R
50|$|<b>Basque</b> <b>nationalist</b> <b>parties</b> {{have as a}} {{key point}} in their agendas to merge Navarre into the {{autonomous}} community of the Basque Country by referendum (as predicted in the Spanish constitution). All Spain-based parties, as well as UPN and PSN, oppose this move.|$|R
50|$|<b>Basque</b> <b>nationalist</b> <b>parties</b> overall deny {{legitimacy}} to the 1978 Spanish Constitution in the Basque Autonomous Community and Navarre (Southern Basque Country), {{which did not}} receive Basque input. Despite numerically winning the poll, abstention and No ballots outnumbered conspicuously Yes ballots in the territory.|$|R
25|$|Exceptions were Biscay and Gipuzkoa {{where the}} Christian Democratic <b>Basque</b> <b>Nationalist</b> <b>Party,</b> after some hesitation, {{supported}} the Republic while halting persecution {{in the areas}} held by the Basque Government. All Catholic churches in the Republican zone were closed. The desecration {{was not limited to}} Catholic churches, as synagogues and Protestant churches were also pillaged and closed, but some small Protestant churches were spared. The rising Franco's regime would keep Protestant churches and synagogues closed, as he only permitted Catholic church.|$|E
500|$|The Renovación Española and the Spanish Nationalist Party ( [...] , PNE) {{formed the}} National Block (...) , {{with a total}} of 14 deputies. Similarly, the Republican Left of Catalonia ( [...] , ERC), the Socialist Union of Catalonia (Unió Socialista de Catalunya, USC) and the Union of Rabassaires (Unió de Rabassaires, UdR) formed the Catalan Left (Esquerra Catalana) with 18 deputies. Five {{independent}}s joined the Agrarians and one joined CEDA. The other seven, along with one member of Conservative Republican Party ( [...] , PRC), formed [...] a group of independents called the Independent Right (Independiente de Derechas). The Mallorcan Regionalist deputy joined the Catalan League (Lliga Catalana), and the independent in favour of the Estella Statute joined the <b>Basque</b> <b>Nationalist</b> <b>Party</b> (Partido Nacionalista Vasco). 5 members of the Agrarians and one of the PRC joined CEDA, although the Agrarians as a whole resisted pressure to join CEDA, and formed the Spanish Agrarian Party (Partido Agrario Español).|$|E
500|$|Basque {{president}} José Antonio Ardanza Garro {{condemned the}} attack: [...] "attacks like this do not {{help us to}} consolidate democracy or overcome the problems of violence in our society. This attack could provoke a response and a further spiral of violence." [...] The <b>Basque</b> <b>Nationalist</b> <b>Party</b> voiced suspicion that the attacks {{were part of a}} dirty war being carried out by the Spanish state. Herri Batasuna, the political wing of ETA, also accused the Spanish secret services of complicity in such attacks and delivered a letter of protest to the French consulate in Bilbao, criticising the French for perceived inaction against the killers. The PSOE, at that time the governing party of Spain, condemned the incident as an attack on [...] "the freedom of the Basque people". Their chairman in the Basque Country, Juan Manuel Eguiagaray, stated that he did not believe that the solution to ETA violence was to have similar terrorists trying to even the score.|$|E

50|$|Herri Batasuna (Popular Unity) was a far-left <b>Basque</b> <b>nationalist</b> {{political}} <b>party</b> in Spain.|$|R
25|$|The {{dynamics}} of controversial decisions imposed by Spanish tribunals on <b>Basque</b> <b>nationalist</b> <b>parties</b> ideologically close to ETA left {{for over a}} decade a distorted representation of the Basque politics in local councils and regional parliaments, as well as a swiftly changing array of disbanded party names, new alliances, and re-accommodations.|$|R
2500|$|On the {{following}} days, negotiations between PSOE and minor parties resulted in Canarian Coalition (CC) confirming its affirmative vote for Sánchez, while Republican Left of Catalonia (ERC) and Democracy and Freedom (DiL) announced they would coordinate themselves, together confirming {{their opposition to}} a PSOE-led accord unless it recognized Catalonia's sovereignty by allowing a self-determination referendum to be held. The PSOE accepted both parties' stance, as it would not accept their votes either, opposing a referendum. The <b>Basque</b> <b>Nationalist</b> <b>Party</b> (PNV) had already rejected supporting Rajoy, and it conditioned support for Sánchez on a new political status for the Basque Country. Euskal Herria Bildu (EH Bildu) opened a window to [...] "involving itself in the investiture" [...] if there was [...] "a real offer of change". Popular Unity (IU–UPeC) kept negotiating with PSOE, with its leaders expressing their interest in preventing [...] "a right-wing government" [...] {{as well as in}} reaching an understanding with other left-wing forces.|$|E
2500|$|On October 10, 2012 {{a motion}} of <b>Basque</b> <b>Nationalist</b> <b>Party</b> (PNV) Senator Iñaki Anasagasti placed before the full Senate {{calling for the}} removal of the remains of Francisco Franco from the Valley of the Fallen as {{recommended}} by the Expert Commission for the Future of the Valley of the Fallen was rejected by the Popular Party majority. Together with the motion to remove the remains of Franco, the Popular Party majority also voted down an amendment by the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party {{for the creation of a}} parliamentary committee to seek a consensus for the implementation of the recommendations of the Expert Commission for the Future of the Valley of the Fallen. In a speech at the time before the Senate in defense of his party’s no votes Popular Party Senator Alejandro Muñoz-Alonso argued there is no consensus at present in Spain for implementing the recommendations of the Expert Commission for the Future of the Valley of the Fallen and even the Expert Commission unilaterally formed by the Zapatero government was not unanimous, and the matter is now totally exhausted for having been raised eight times before the Parliament; and, then closed for his remarks by quoting from the Bible saying, “let the dead bury the dead” for urging the Senate in light of Spain's economic crisis to return to addressing the [...] "problems of the living." ...|$|E

50|$|There are <b>Basque</b> <b>nationalist</b> <b>parties</b> {{with similar}} goals {{as those of}} ETA (namely, independence) but who openly reject their violent means. They are: EAJ-PNV, Eusko Alkartasuna, Aralar and, in the French Basque country, Abertzaleen Batasuna. In addition, a number of left-wing parties, such as Ezker Batua, Batzarre and some sectors of the EAJ-PNV party, also support {{self-determination}} but are not in favour of independence.|$|R
50|$|The name Eusko Abertzaleak (Basque Patriots) is used {{by various}} {{parliamentary}} and town council groups of the <b>Basque</b> <b>Nationalist</b> <b>Party.</b> In fact, Eusko Alkartasuna {{was meant to be}} founded under the name Eusko Abertzaleak, but the <b>Basque</b> <b>Nationalist</b> <b>Party</b> registered this name first.|$|E
50|$|Since {{the first}} {{autonomic}} cabinet, the <b>Basque</b> <b>Nationalist</b> <b>Party</b> has held {{office in the}} Basque Autonomous Community except for a 2009-2012 term, led by Patxi Lopez (PSE-PSOE). The current Basque prime minister is Iñigo Urkullu, {{also a member of}} the <b>Basque</b> <b>Nationalist</b> <b>Party.</b>|$|E
50|$|Alderdi Eguna ("Party Day") is the {{national}} holiday of the <b>Basque</b> <b>Nationalist</b> <b>Party</b> which is annually celebrated on the last Sunday of September, the Sunday closest to the feast day of Saint Michael, {{the patron saint of}} Euskal Herria and of the <b>Basque</b> <b>Nationalist</b> <b>Party.</b>|$|E

50|$|The Aberri Eguna {{is not an}} {{official}} holiday and main events continue to be organized by <b>Basque</b> <b>nationalist</b> <b>parties.</b> However, the exact format and tone depends on the organiser and thus can vary considerably from a political rally to a cultural picnic. In particular in emigrant communities, the celebration of Basque culture features much more strongly than any political overtones. The cultural element often features events such as Basque music, traditional sports, food and drink, in particular Basque cider.|$|R
5000|$|In the {{elections}} to the Parliament of Navarre held on 22 May 2011, the coalition won three seats and 5.70% of the valid votes. The coalition defends an approach of [...] "inclusion and coexistence", {{as opposed to}} exclusion and confrontational attitudes. The party also advocates for an alliance of leftist forces of Navarre {{and an end to}} UPN's on-off decades long tenure in office, as well as an understanding with leftist <b>Basque</b> <b>nationalist</b> <b>parties.</b> Their main strongholds lie in Pamplona and Tudela.|$|R
50|$|The {{coalition}} comprised Aralar, the <b>Basque</b> <b>Nationalist</b> <b>Party,</b> Eusko Alkartasuna (Basque Solidarity), Batzarre, {{and local}} independents, {{but not the}} outlawed Basque nationalists of Batasuna or Accion Nacionalista Vasca (ANV), traditionally the <b>Basque</b> <b>nationalist</b> <b>party</b> in Navarre with strongest support, for its stance on ETA's violence.|$|E
