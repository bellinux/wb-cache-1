5|$|In {{directed}} planar graphs, simple directed cycles are dual to directed cuts (partitions of the vertices {{into two}} subsets such that all edges go in one direction, from one subset to the other). Strongly oriented planar graphs (graphs whose underlying undirected graph is connected, {{and in which}} every edge <b>belongs</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> cycle) are dual to directed acyclic graphs in which no edge <b>belongs</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> cycle. To put this another way, the strong orientations of a connected planar graph (assignments of directions {{to the edges of}} the graph that result in a strongly connected graph) are dual to acyclic orientations (assignments of directions that produce a directed acyclic graph).|$|E

5000|$|An {{inherent}} {{problem with}} electoral politics is the over-representative of the politically active groups in society {{who tend to}} be those who join political parties. For example, in 2000 less than 2% [...] of the UK population <b>belonged</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> political party whilst in 2005 there were at best only 3 independent MPs (see List of UK minor party and independent MPs elected) so that 99.5% of all UK MPs <b>belonged</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> political party. As a result, political members of the UK population were represented by one MP per 1800 of those <b>belonging</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> party whilst those who did not <b>belong</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> party had one MP per 19 million individuals who did not <b>belong</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> party.|$|R

5|$|The {{hippopotamus}} is {{the type}} genus of the family Hippopotamidae. The pygmy hippopotamus <b>belongs</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> different genus in Hippopotamidae, either Choeropsis or Hexaprotodon. Hippopotamidae are sometimes known as hippopotamids. Sometimes, the subfamily Hippopotaminae is used. Further, some taxonomists group hippopotamuses and anthracotheres in the superfamily Anthracotheroidea. Hippopotamidae are classified along with other even-toed ungulates in the order Artiodactyla. Other artiodactyls include camels, cattle, deer and pigs, although hippopotamuses are not closely related to these groups.|$|E

40|$|This study {{explores the}} themes of the {{experience}} of <b>belonging</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> male-only society, namely Freemasonry, by allowing members of the Freemasons to tell their stories of their experience of <b>belonging</b> <b>to</b> Freemasonry. The epistemological framework was that of phenomenology, using a qualitative research design. The study involved a series of in-depth individual interviews. Their stories provide alternative ways of perceiving men’s experience of <b>belonging</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> male-only society, focusing on the Freemasons. Several common themes were also identified in the participants’ interviews. The researcher found that the history of the Freemasons plays a large role in the member’s justification for female exclusion. Gender, as well as the members need <b>to</b> <b>belong</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> male- only society, gave the researcher some insight into their experience of <b>belonging</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> male-only society.

5|$|Like Bakerian mimicry, Dodsonian mimicry {{is a form}} of {{reproductive}} floral mimicry, but the model <b>belongs</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> different species than the mimic. The name refers to Calaway H. Dodson. By providing similar sensory signals as the model flower, it can lure its pollinators. Like Bakerian mimics, no nectar is provided. Epidendrum ibaguense (Orchidaceae) resembles flowers of Lantana camara and Asclepias curassavica, and is pollinated by monarch butterflies and perhaps hummingbirds. Similar cases are seen in some other species of the same family. The mimetic species may still have pollinators of its own though. For example, a lamellicorn beetle, which usually pollinates correspondingly colored Cistus flowers, is also known to aid in pollination of Ophrys species that are normally pollinated by bees.|$|E

5|$|Molecular {{analysis}} of {{nucleic acid sequences}} from the internal transcribed spacer and elongation factor EF-1α regions suggests that the genus Morchella {{can be divided into}} three lineages. M.rufobrunnea <b>belongs</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> lineage that is basal to the esculenta clade ("yellow morels"), and the elata clade ("black morels"). This phylogenetic placement implies that it has existed in its current form since the Cretaceous era (roughly 145 to 66 million years ago), and all known morel species evolved from a similar ancestor. M.rufobrunnea is genetically closer to the yellow morels than the black morels. M.anatolica, described from Turkey in 2012, is a closely related sister species.|$|E
