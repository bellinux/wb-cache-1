25|$|If, for {{environmental}} or other reasons, a solvent or solvent blend {{is required to}} replace another of equivalent solvency, the substitution can {{be made on the}} basis of the Hansen solubility parameters of each. The values for mixtures are taken as the weighted averages of the values for the neat solvents. This can be calculated <b>by</b> <b>trial-and-error,</b> a spreadsheet of values, or HSP software. A 1:1 mixture of toluene and 1,4 dioxane has δD, δP and δH values of 17.8, 1.6 and 5.5, comparable to those of chloroform at 17.8, 3.1 and 5.7 respectively. Because of the health hazards associated with toluene itself, other mixtures of solvents may be found using a full HSP dataset.|$|E

40|$|Reinforced-concrete {{sections}} {{are usually}} designed at the ultimate limit state, while the checks at the {{serviceability limit states}} are made afterwards. Unfortunately, since the serviceability requirements are often not met, then R/C sections have to be re-designed with a trial-and-error procedure which encumbers the design. Since {{in many cases the}} design of R/C beams requires that their section depth is as small as possible, in this paper minimizing the depth of a R/C section is the main objective. For given material properties, we identify the minimum effective depth for different values of both the neutral axis-effective depth ratio and the compressive-tensile steel ratio. In fact, these two ratios highly affect the effective depth of the section; therefore, these ratios are the design variables {{in order to reduce the}} depth, when the other design conditions have been assigned. It is shown that the traditional design <b>by</b> <b>trial-and-errors</b> can be rationalized by modelling it as a constrained nonlinear programming problem, where the beam effective depth is minimized, and the constraints come from the serviceability requirements...|$|R

50|$|Another way to {{introduce}} physical time-alignment {{without having to}} physically shift the tweeter backwards is to tilt the speaker itself upwards (or have the front-panel sloping instead of vertical). This method will cause the physical on-axis plane itself to be tilted upwards - so it virtually brings the physical plane {{in line with the}} required on-axis plane. However, now the listening position is off-axis relative to either driver at all frequencies. This is the simplest of all methods (especially tilting the speaker itself upwards) in that it can be done for any speaker and lends itself more easily to setting up the speakers <b>by</b> <b>trial-and-error.</b>|$|E

One early option considered AC-130H retaliatory punitive strikes deep within Iran. Later gunship flights exceeded the 1979 Hurlburt-to-Guam flight. Upon return in March 1980, the four planes soon found themselves in Egypt to support the ill-fated hostage rescue attempt.|$|E
