40|$|Miscanthus giganteus is a seed sterile crop {{that has}} shown {{potential}} in the US and Europe as a bioenergy crop. In European trials, M. giganteus yields have ranged from 10 - 30 Mg dry matter (DM) ha- 1 and from 25 - 38 Mg DM ha- 1 in limited US trials. Due to its sterility, M. giganteus is principally propagated by rhizome division. However, limited {{research has been conducted}} on the mechanization of the propagation system. ^ Vegetatively propagated crops, planting procedures and commercially available production equipment were reviewed to gain perspective on how to potentially mechanize the process of planting M. giganteus rhizomes. Typical procedures and equipment used for rhizome harvesting were also examined. The review of available technology shows that there are aspects of horticultural equipment that are adaptable for use with M. giganteus. In addition, examination of specialty equipment for M. giganteus shows aspects that are improvable such as uniformity of spacing in row and rhizome singulation. Current equipment for propagation of rhizomes relies on <b>bulk</b> <b>metering</b> of rhizomes into furrows, the key disadvantage of which is non-uniform spacing. ^ Based upon the review and recommendations that were developed, a prototype precision miscanthus rhizome planter was developed from Lockwood Air Cup® row units. The planter uses nozzles under vacuum to singulate rhizomes from a hopper. The planter plants miscanthus rhizomes at fixed in-row spacing of 46, 51, 56, 61 or 76 cm. ^ Based upon the recommendations of previous research a prototype precision miscanthus rhizome planter was developed from Lockwood Air Cup® row units. The planter utilizes vacuum to singulate and plant rhizomes at target in-row spacing. Two field tests were performed where planter performance was quantified by quality of feed, multiple, miss and precision indices. The quality of feed index is the percentage of one or two rhizomes recorded. The multiple index is the percentage of three or more rhizomes recorded. The miss index is the percentage of skips recorded and the precision is the variation in spacing of single and double rhizomes {{as a percentage of the}} nominal spacing. ^ The initial field test used rhizome material 0. 6 - 1. 3 cm in diameter and 7. 0 - 13. 0 cm long. The quality of feed was 61. 0 % with a multiple index of 17. 0 % and miss index of 22. 0 %. The second field test used rhizome material 1. 0 - 1. 4 cm in diameter and 7. 0 - 13. 0 cm long and tested nominal spacings of 56, 61 and 76 cm. The quality of feed indices were 48. 0 %, 48. 0 % and 52. 0 %, the multiple indices were 1. 3 %, 1. 3 % and 6. 7 % respectively and the miss indices were 50. 7 %, 50. 7 % and 41. 3 % respectively. The precision was 7. 8 %, 9. 3 % and 8. 3 % respectively. ^ Cup designs were tested to determine if there was a significant difference in the requirements to hold a rhizome. The first design tested was the original conical cup used for potatoes on Lockwood AirCup planters. The second cup was a modified version of the original cup with notches cut into it to help orient rhizomes in the cup and allow the rhizomes to be closer to the nozzle inlet. Testing showed that the modified design required 584 Pa less static pressure, 2. 65 m 3 hr- 1 less flow and an inlet velocity 2. 16 m s- 1 lower than the original design. ^ The requirements to hold a rhizome against an orifice were investigated for pipe inside diameters of 0. 87, 1. 20, 1. 56, 2. 04, 2. 62 and 3. 64 cm. Models were developed to predict the requirements to hold a rhizome for the diameters tested. Testing showed that flow is positively correlated to pipe diameter according to Q = 3. 44 D 1. 94, where Q is the flow (m 3 hr- 1) and D is pipe inside diameter (cm). Static pressure was found to be negatively correlated to pipe diameter according to Pr = 2200 D - 2. 05 where Pr is static pressure (Pa). The power required was positively correlated to P = 1. 70 D 0. 54 where P is power (W). The force exerted on the rhizome is negatively correlated to F = 0. 187 D- 0. 74 where F is force (N). ...|$|E

40|$|Apparent losses form an {{important}} component of the International Water Association's water balance. While apparent losses look like real losses to a municipality, this is not actually the case. The main components of apparent losses are water meter under-registration and unauthorised consumption. Water utilities in South Africa and internationally are becoming increasingly aware of the importance of good meter management practices based on the vast amount of literature published and work done by municipalities in recent years. Water meters are known to increasingly under-register as they age and register consumption. They register consumption the least accurate at low flowrates and their accuracy in this range deteriorates the fastest. This study investigates the extent of the apparent loss problem in selected areas of South Africa due to meter inaccuracy in a number of different ways, including an inspection of new residential consumer meters, interrogation of a metering database, flow logging of domestic consumers with and without an Unmeasured Flow Reducer (UFR) installed and a compilation of reports on <b>bulk</b> consumer <b>meters.</b> It was found that 16 % of 402 properties investigated in the City of Cape Town had an on-site leakage and their median flowrate was 10 litres/ hour. In Bloemfontein, it was found that 28 % of the 167 properties investigated had an on-site leakage with a median flowrate of 20 l/h. An investigation into the performance of 15 mm positive displacement meters based on eThekwini's water meter database showed that the under-registration from these meters increase by 0. 36 %-points per year and 0. 9 %-points per 1000 kL registered. Flow logging of domestic consumers with and without UFRs, showed that there was no genuine improvement in meter accuracy with meters that had UFRs installed in-line with it. However, there were only 8 properties (3 of which having a UFR installed) in the study that were investigated and no statistical conclusive conclusions could be made. <b>Bulk</b> <b>meter</b> audits in Ekurhuleni and Tshwane showed apparent losses of 18 % and 19 % respectively...|$|R

40|$|Problem: In {{the coming}} years the United States is working to move towards a smarter {{electric}} grid. One that is more versatile and can adjust to different situations. To move forward with these from our current electric grid to the Smart Grid, simulations are needed {{to understand how the}} new grid is likely to behave in different situations. Rationale: The importance of creating these simulations is to try and predict which topological set-ups are best for different kinds of scenarios as well as how the grid might behave under different circumstances. Once different situations are simulated, Smart Grid developers can use the simulations as a guide for building the physical and digital Smart Grid. Approach: Our team used the simulation software NS 3 to write our Smart Grid simulation. We are beginning with a basic network topology and trying to implement five use cases on this network. From there we {{hope to be able to}} expand to be able to look at slightly different topologies and compare their performance completing the use cases. The use cases are: on demand meter read, on demand meter read failure, on demand meter interval period read, normal meter reading operations, and <b>bulk</b> <b>meter</b> interval data read. Interim Results and Conclusions: We have begun with a simple topology (shown below) with a point to point connection between individual meters and the data concentrator, which then send information to the data and control center. We have begun implementing the use cases while monitoring time for completion, loss of information and other important factors we would like to compare across all of our various topologies. Anticipated Results and Conclusions: At the conclusion of this project, we hope to have a functioning simulation that can compare and assess different topologies and network set-ups. [URL]...|$|R

40|$|Corrosion {{and scale}} {{deposition}} on pipelines {{are two of}} the major flow assurance issues which have been recognized in the oilfield. Corrosion control of carbon steel pipelines requires understanding of the simultaneous occurrence of both processes. To date there have been few studies demonstrating the interactions between surface scale deposition and corrosion processes. Combined scale/corrosion inhibitors (mixture of scale and corrosion inhibitors) are gaining in popularity in {{the oil and gas industry}} as one of many methods to mitigate both those processes. A newly developed methodology of combined bulk jar scaling/bubble cell technique (corrosion) was used to assess the corrosion rate, CaCO 3 deposition on the material surface and bulk precipitation in a CO 2 environment. In this study the effects of single components of scale and corrosion inhibitors on the corrosion processes (general and localized corrosion) and scale deposition (bulk and surface deposition) have been investigated. Surface analysis techniques (SEM, EDX and Light Interferometry) and <b>bulk</b> analysis (Turbidity <b>meter</b> and ICP-MS) enable the corrosion/scale mechanisms to be studied in detail for X 65 pipeline material. An experimental design method has been used to evaluate single and/or synergistic effect of single components of combined scale/corrosion inhibitor on the corrosion and scale processes. The methodology used in this study a newly-developed combined bulk jar scaling/bubble cell prove that is very effective tool in assessment of corrosion and scale interactions when they occurs simultaneously. Assessment of calcium carbonate precipitation on the sample showed that scale plays an important role of accelerating pitting corrosion by providing a suitable environment. XRD analysis showed that the calcium carbonate crystals which formed on the metal sample in the tests with 2 -mercapthoethanol were calcite crystals only. The simple linear regression model was developed to predict corrosion and scale when these process occur simultaneously. The model also enables the interactions between the corrosion and scale inhibitor components to be quantified. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper was}} {{accepted}} for publication in International Journal of Pharmaceutics and the definitive published version is available at [URL] drug delivery to the lungs by a DPI device requires the air-stream through the device to have sufficient power to aerosolise the powder. Furthermore, sufficient turbulence must be induced, along with particle-wall and particle-particle collisions, in order to de-aggregate small drug particles from large carrier particles. As a result, the emitted and the fine particle doses produced by many commercially available DPI devices tend to be strongly affected by the natural inter-patient variability of the inhaled air flow. The Nexthaler® is a multi-dose breath-actuated dry-powder inhaler with minimum drug delivery-flow rate dependency and incorporating a dose protector. The actuation mechanism of the dose-protector ensures that the dose is only exposed to the inhaled air flow if the flow has sufficient power to cause complete aerosolisation. For this study, a proprietary lactose placebo powder blend was filled into “transparent “ Nexthalers® to allow application of high speed imaging and particle image velocimetry (PIV) techniques to successfully interrogate and reveal details of the powder entrainment and emission processes coupled with characterisation of the flow environment {{in the vicinity of}} the mouthpiece exit. The study showed that fluidisation of the bulk of the powder occurs very quickly (20 ms) after withdrawal of the dose protector followed by powder emission from the device within 50 ms thereafter. The <b>bulk</b> of the <b>metered</b> placebo dose was emitted within 100 - 200 ms. The visualisation study also revealed that a very small fraction of powder fines is emitted whilst the dose protector still covers the dosing cup as the flow rate through the device accelerates. The PIV results show that the flow exiting the device is highly turbulent with a rotating flow structure, which forces the particles to follow internal paths having a high probability of wall impacts, suggesting that the flow environment inside the Nexthaler® DPI will be very beneficial for carrier-drug de-aggregation...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a procedure to optimise {{the shape of}} a coaxial transducer ultrasonic flow meter. The technique uses separate numerical simulations of the fluid flow and the ultrasound propagation within a meter duct. A new flow meter geometry has been developed, having a significantly improved (smooth and monotonic) calibration curve. In this work the complex fluid flow field and its influence on the propagation of ultrasound in a cylindrical flow meter duct is investigated. A geometric acoustics (ray tracing) propagation model is applied to a flow field calculated by a commercial Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) package. The simulation results are compared to measured calibration curves for a variety of meter geometries having varying lengths and duct diameters. The modelling shows reasonable agreement to the calibration characteristics for several meter geometries over a Reynolds number range of 100 [...] . 100000 (based on <b>bulk</b> velocity and <b>meter</b> duct diameter). Various CFD simulations are validated against flow visualisation measurements, Laser Doppler Velocimetry measurements or published results. The thesis includes software to calculate the acoustic ray propagation and also to calculate the optimal shape for the annular gap around the transducer housings in order to achieve desired flow acceleration. A dimensionless number is proposed to characterise the mean deflection of an acoustic beam due to interaction with a fluid flow profile (or acoustic velocity gradient). For flow in a cylindrical duct, the 'acoustic beam deflection number' is defined as M g* (L/D) ^ 2, where: M is the Mach Number of the bulk velocity; g* is the average non-dimensionalised velocity gradient insonified by the acoustic beam (g* is a function of transducer diameter - typically g* = 0. 5 [...] . 4. 5); L is the transducer separation; and D is the duct diameter. Large values of this number indicate considerable beam deflection that may lead to undesirable wall reflections and diffraction effects. For a single path coaxial transducer ultrasonic flow meter, there are practical limits to the length of a flow meter and to the maximum size of a transducer for a given duct diameter. The 'acoustic beam deflection number' characterises the effect of these parameters...|$|R
40|$|The {{intention}} of this thesis is to discover associations between demography and electric usage patterns among residential customers. The {{basis for the}} research will include electric consumption data from customers within the Holland Board of Public Works’ (HBPW) footprint in Holland, Michigan and household demographic data from Directories USA. Data compilation and pre-processing {{will take place in}} SQL Server 2005. Additional pre-processing and subsequent machine learning algorithms will be applied using WEKA, an open source data mining software tool from the University of Waikato. Algorithms under consideration include, but are not limited to, Kohonen Self Organizing Maps (SOMs), Decision Tree Analysis, and k-Means Clustering. While overall system loads are automatically stored within various Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems with granularity down to the hour, the consumer components historically were collected on a monthly basis by manual read. If meter reading employees could not ascertain a reading for a customer in a given month, estimations would be used. Beginning in 1999, the Holland BPW began the process of transitioning to an Automatic Meter Reading (AMR) system. By September 2006, the <b>bulk</b> of electric <b>meters</b> in the service area were communicating hourly to a SQL Server database cluster. These regular transmissions include usage, demand and alarm data used throughout the organization for processes such as billing, outage management, and transmission system load analysis. The future of this system includes movement to bidirectional, on demand interactions with consuming assets within the service area. This emerging technology is known as the Smart Grid and affords utilities the ability to offer more reliable transmission to its customers by closely monitoring and maintaining balance between supply and demand. Likewise, real time granularity would allow the utility to offer new rate structures that would incentivize customers to conserve during peak load periods. This research will attempt to discover correlations that may exist between demography and residential electricity usage. The intent is to discretize hourly load patterns using Kohonen SOMs and feed the demographic data with the resulting usage pattern categories into various classification algorithms. The goal, through this two phased approach, is to provide insight into the various demographic groups that the electric utility serves...|$|R

Turner   Biosensors and Bioelectronics Centre, IFM, Linköping University, Linköping S- 58183, Sweden.    anthony. turner@liu. se   www. ifm. liu. se/biosensors     This lecture will {{consider}} how the recent emergence of printed bioelectronics can offer new solutions to distributed diagnostics {{for the maintenance of}} wellbeing, management of an ageing population, food security and environmental safety.   The adaptation of screen printing for the production of enzyme electrodes proved to be a decisive element in the success of mediated electrochemical devices in the home blood-glucose monitoring market. Until then, biosensors had been wholly hand made, and could not possibly address a market requiring billions of devices a year. Coupled with the use of proprietary mediators and patented capillary-fill designs, machine fabrication of enzyme electrodes enabled the paradigm changing switch to the electrochemical devices that now dominate this market. Today, approximately half of the electrodes used in disposable glucose sensors are screen printed using curable polymer inks, while the remainder are produced using a combination of vapour deposition of thin layers of metal such as palladium, followed by laser ablation to pattern these into individual electrodes. Additional printing steps, drop-on-delivery and /or lamination results in a final sensor, which can cost around 2 - 6 US cents / strip to make, when produced by the millions. However, it is now timely to challenge our original paradigm of a disposable strip coupled to a pocket-sized <b>meter.</b> Even in <b>bulk,</b> the average <b>meters</b> cost between US$ 7 - 10 to manufacture, with some more elaborate versions costing as much as US$ 90.   So why not print the whole device? All-printed Mn –ZnO batteries can already be made to power microsensors and for other applications such as RFID tags, transdermal drug delivery, cosmetic patches and smart packaging. These are available as commercial products such as the SoftBattery™ from Enfucell (Finland). Monochrome emissive or reflective digital displays can be printed on both paper and plastic and, in keeping with the trend to interface biosensing systems with telecommunication, thin film aluminium or copper antennae are also available. A state-of-the-art combination of these technologies allows us to formulate an all-printed sensing instrument where everything is produced on a simple sheet of PET to form a disposable, credit-card like device. An example of such a working demonstrator resulting from collaboration between Acreo ICT AB and our team at Linköping University is shown below. Analyte concentration can be measured in a few seconds and observed via the printed display, with the device being powered by a printed battery. This platform is being used to develop a range of new products incorporating nanomaterials, principally for medical diagnostics, but also for food safety analysis, environmental monitoring and security applications.   In addition to reviewing the evolution of printing technology in this arena, this talk will explore the multifarious sensing configurations that can be supported by this inexpensive and disposable platform. Graphene-based hybrid structures, unsubstituted phenothiazines and Prussian blue nanoparticles have recently been incorporated into novel sensors for metabolites and physiologically important enzymes. Electrochemical immunosensors have also been formulated using silver nanoparticles and in label-free formats. Gold nanoparticles and nanostructured gold surfaces provide further functional enhancement and smart polymers can add reversibility to affinity systems and modulation to catalytic configurations. Finally, synthetic receptors based on imprinted nanoparticles offer robustness beyond that normally achieved with biological components. The combination of advanced synthetic materials with biologically inspired constituents promises to facilitate a growth in personalised analytical solutions that are widely available to the consumer and that can capitalise on the ubiquitous telecommunications and information systems that are now both widely available and rapidly evolving.                               Early Protoype (left) and design (right) for a fully integrated, printed biosensor instrument, resulting from collaboration between Acreo ICT AB and our team at Linköping University.   Reference Turner, A.
