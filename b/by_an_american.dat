The Roma management appointed Luis Enrique, who had previous coached the Barcelona B side, in a bid to emulate Barcelona's football style.|$|E

Shōkaku was sunk <b>by</b> <b>an</b> <b>American</b> {{submarine}} during the Battle of the Philippine Sea in June 1944 as the Americans invaded the Marianas and Zuikaku was sacrificed as a decoy four months later during the Battle of Cape Engano.|$|E
5|$|In 1806, {{the village}} was visited by a Spanish {{expedition}} led by Lieutenant Facundo Melgares and, soon after, <b>by</b> <b>an</b> <b>American</b> expedition led by Lieutenant Zebulon Pike.

5|$|King Arthur & the Knights of Justice was {{the first}} Enix game {{developed}} <b>by</b> <b>an</b> <b>American</b> company: Manley & Associates in Issaquah, Washington. Roughly two dozen people worked on the game, though not {{all at the same}} time. It was initially planned for a 16-megabit cartridge, but four additional megabits were eventually added to expand the game. Development spanned about two years.|$|E
5|$|The launch {{facilities}} at Woomera were demolished {{within a year}} of the final flight, and half of the engineers who had worked on the programme were laid off. The X-4 satellite, which had been manifested for launch by Black Arrow R4, was eventually launched on 9 March 1974, <b>by</b> <b>an</b> <b>American</b> Scout D-1 rocket flying from Space Launch Complex 5 at the Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.|$|E
5|$|The player {{takes on}} the role of a team of American {{football}} players who are transported to Medieval England and given the mission to save King Arthur and destroy the evil sorceress Morgana and her army. The game was the first Enix title developed <b>by</b> <b>an</b> <b>American</b> company, and was inspired in-part by The Legend of Zelda. It was received with reviews ranging from mediocre to extremely poor.|$|E
25|$|Articles {{about the}} 1999 {{revision}} {{while it was}} in previews noted that the one difference between the original production and the 1999 version was that the latter reflected the increased ethnic diversity of casting over the decades that had passed, with Schroeder being played <b>by</b> <b>an</b> African <b>American</b> actor (Mathis) and Linus <b>by</b> <b>an</b> Asian <b>American</b> (Wong).|$|R

5|$|A European {{tour with}} AC/DC {{in support of}} The World Needs a Hero began in mid-2001, {{followed}} <b>by</b> <b>an</b> <b>American</b> tour with Iced Earth and Endo in September. Mustaine allowed fans to choose the setlist in each American city. However, the tour was cut short following the September 11 attacks; all dates were canceled, including a DVD shoot in Argentina. The band instead played two shows in Arizona on November 16 and 17, which were filmed and released as Megadeth's first live release, Rude Awakening. That year, Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good! was remixed and remastered; the reissue featured modified artwork and several bonus tracks.|$|E
5|$|Hiyō was torpedoed in June 1943 and Junyō in November; both ships {{spent about}} three months under repair. They {{spent most of the}} time after their repairs {{training}} and ferrying aircraft before returning to combat. Hiyō was sunk by a gasoline vapor explosion caused <b>by</b> <b>an</b> <b>American</b> aerial torpedo hit during the Battle of the Philippine Sea in mid-1944 while Junyō was damaged by several bombs. Lacking aircraft, she was used as a transport in late 1944 and was torpedoed in December. The ship was under repair until March 1945 when the repairs were deemed uneconomical. Junyō was then effectively hulked {{for the rest of the}} war. After the surrender of Japan in September, the Americans deemed the ship not worth her repair costs; she was broken up in 1946–47.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{inclement weather}} also {{hampered}} the Americans' advance, and until May 15 the recapturing forces were unsure {{of whether the}} Japanese had held their position or retreated. When the fog lifted on that day, {{it became clear that}} the Japanese had retreated further west. However, when the American forces gave chase, they were immediately slowed by an accidental air strike upon them <b>by</b> <b>an</b> <b>American</b> aircraft. By May 29, the Japanese forces numbered only 700–1,000, and these troops attempted to run through the advancing American forces as a last show of defiance against the recapturing forces. By May 30, the Americans had recaptured Attu, and although a few small pockets of Japanese troops remained on the island, the Battle of Attu had essentially concluded.|$|E

5|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{repatriate}} Koga's body, American author Jim Rearden led a search on Akutan in 1988. He located Koga's grave, but found it empty. Rearden and Japanese businessman Minoru Kawamoto conducted a records search. They found that in 1947 Koga's body was exhumed <b>by</b> <b>an</b> <b>American</b> Graves Registration Service team and re-buried on Adak Island, further down the Aleutian chain. The team, unaware of Koga's identity, marked his body as unidentified. The Adak cemetery was excavated in 1953, and 236 bodies were returned to Japan. The body buried next to Koga (Shigeyoshi Shindo) was one of 13 identified; the remaining 223 unidentified remains were re-interred in Chidorigafuchi National Cemetery in Japan. It is probable that Koga was one of them. Rearden later wrote the definitive account of the Akutan Zero.|$|E
5|$|In {{the event}} finals, Liukin {{displayed}} a beautiful routine {{to earn a}} surprising bronze medal on floor exercise with a score of 15.425, behind Shawn Johnson, with 15.500, and Romanian Sandra Izbasa, with 15.650. On uneven bars, Liukin and China's He Kexin both posted final marks of 16.725 and earned identical A- and B-panel scores of 7.70 and 9.025, respectively. However, He Kexin won the gold medal, and Liukin was awarded the silver, after a tie-breaking calculation that took into account individual marks given by judges on the B-panel. In the balance beam final, Liukin scored 16.025 to claim silver behind Shawn Johnson's 16.225. With her fifth Beijing medal, Liukin tied Mary Lou Retton and Shannon Miller for the most gymnastics medals won <b>by</b> <b>an</b> <b>American</b> in a single Olympic Games.|$|E
5|$|Jake and Elwood begin {{tracking}} down {{members of the}} band. Five of them are playing a deserted Holiday Inn lounge, and quickly agree to rejoin. Another turns them down as he is the maître d' at an expensive restaurant, but the brothers refuse to leave the restaurant until he relents. On their way to meet the final two band members, the brothers find the road through Jackson Park blocked <b>by</b> <b>an</b> <b>American</b> Nazi Party demonstration on a bridge; Elwood runs them off the bridge into the East Lagoon. The last two band members, who now run a soul food restaurant, rejoin the band {{against the advice of}} one's wife. The reunited group obtain instruments and equipment from Ray's Music Exchange in Calumet City, and Ray, as usual, takes an IOU.|$|E

5|$|Job Maarse, artistic {{director}} of Pentatone, said of the album's origins: From day one the co-operation between Pentatone and the Oregon Symphony and its Music Director Carlos Kalmar has been something magical. The quality of the orchestra and the program ideas of Carlos Kalmar {{attracted the attention of}} a large group of music lovers in and outside the U.S. During a pleasant meeting at the Chicago airport almost two years ago the idea for this new album was discussed. I believe all at the table liked it and now everybody can hear how these three pieces, although by composers with different styles, fit perfectly in one program. And of course the Copland symphony {{is one of the best}} pieces ever written <b>by</b> <b>an</b> <b>American</b> composer.|$|E
5|$|Lilly van Java (Lily of Java), {{also known}} as Melatie van Java (Jasmine of Java), is a 1928 film from the Dutch East Indies {{directed}} by Nelson Wong. Initially meant to be produced by South Sea Film and shot <b>by</b> <b>an</b> <b>American</b> director, the film– which follows a woman told to marry a man she does not love– was ultimately completed by Wong's Halimoen Film. Details on its cast and performance are contradictory, although the film is recognised as {{the first of a}} long series of ethnic Chinese-produced films in the country. It is likely a lost film.|$|E
