In this paper we have implemented the text classifier using Bayesian approach for phishing detection. Text classifier works on textual content for measuring the similarity between the real web page and untrustworthy web page. Stemming is used for simplicity of our model. For generating threshold we used probabilistic approach with large data set of homepage URLs. The experimental result gives phishing pages detection ratio is 98. 87 % also for FAR is nearly equal to zero...|$|R
40|$|Phishing is a {{criminal}} scheme to steal the user‟s personal data and other credential information. It is a fraud that acquires victim‟s confidential information such as password, <b>bank</b> <b>account</b> <b>detail,</b> credit card number, financial username and password etc. and later it can be misuse by attacker. In this research paper, we proposed a new anti-phishing algorithm, which we call ObURL Detection Algorithm. The ObURL Detection Algorithm used to detect the URL Obfuscation Phishing attacks and it provides the multilayer security over the internet fraud. The ObURL Detection Algorithm can detect the hyperlink, content of hyperlink‟s destination URL, iFrame in email, input form, input form in iFrame source URL, iFrame within iFrame, and after all that multiple tests will be perform such as DNS Test, IP address Test, URL Encode Test, Shorten URL Test, Black and Whitelist Test, URL pattern matching Test On that collected data. Our experiments verified that ObURL Detection Algorithm is effective to detect both known and unknown URL Obfuscation phishing attacks...|$|R
30|$|The above schemes’ {{characteristics}} are developed in our proposed protection gateway {{to add more}} anonymization to the online <b>banking</b> <b>account</b> <b>details.</b> Various data obfuscation techniques are available for the above privacy mechanisms to replace the values of QI. These techniques are basically categorized as generalization and permutation based data anonymization. The generalization based techniques are used to replace the values of QI with the suppressed values {{as shown in the}} above k-anonymity examples. Although generalization works effectively and the association privacy and presence privacy are eliminated, but it has considerable data loss [45]. To address this data loss problem, the permutation based data anonymization techniques have come in existence. The permutation based techniques decompose the sensitive and QI values into two different tables without data suppression and keeps the QI values table in the published area. Although permutation techniques achieve better performance over the generalization based techniques, it cannot resist the presence privacy, because where the exact values of QI are placed in the published environment that enables presence leakage. None of these data anonymization techniques are suitable for achieving desired privacy in the cloud-based environment.|$|R

40|$|Abstract- Remote {{database}} {{systems are}} becoming increasingly popular due to their potential usage in information storage. However, digital tuple data (e. g. <b>bank</b> balance, <b>account</b> <b>details)</b> are themselves vulnerable to security attacks. There are various methods are available to secure critical tuples. In this scheme we propose a new method in which data tuples are embedded in a container image. In this technique, we are using wavelet transform for hiding data in digital images by combining the use of adaptive hiding capacity function that hides secret data in the integer wavelet coefficients of the cover image with the optimum pixel adjustment (OPA) algorithm. The OPA algorithm is applied after embedding secret relational tuples to minimize the embedding error. The proposed system showed high hiding rates with reasonable imperceptibility compared to other steganographic systems. This container image is encrypted to have more security against the attack. At the client end the image is decrypted and converted into original format. From this image the data touples are extracted. Index Terms- Amplitude modulation, RNG mechanism...|$|R
