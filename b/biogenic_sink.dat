We present a compilation of the CO 2, CO, CH 4 and N 2 O balances of Europe following a dual constraint approach in which (1) a land-based balance derived mainly from ecosystem carbon inventories and (2) a land-based balance derived from flux measurements are compared to (3) the atmospheric data-based balance derived from inversions constrained by measurements of atmospheric GHG (greenhouse gas) concentrations. Good agreement between the GHG balances based on fluxes (1294 ± 545 Tg C in CO 2 -eq yr− 1), inventories (1299 ± 200 Tg C in CO 2 -eq yr− 1) and inversions (1210 ± 405 Tg C in CO 2 -eq yr− 1) increases our confidence that the processes underlying the European GHG budget are well understood and reasonably sampled. However, the uncertainty remains large and largely lacks formal estimates. Given that European net land to atmosphere exchanges are determined by a few dominant fluxes, the uncertainty of these key components needs to be formally estimated before efforts {{could be made to}} reduce the overall uncertainty. The net land-to-atmosphere flux is a net source for CO 2, CO, CH 4 and N 2 O, because the anthropogenic emissions by far exceed the <b>biogenic</b> <b>sink</b> strength. The dual-constraint approach confirmed that the European <b>biogenic</b> <b>sink</b> removes as much as 205 ± 72 Tg C yr− 1 from fossil fuel burning from the atmosphere. However, This C is being sequestered in both terrestrial and inland aquatic ecosystems. If the C-cost for ecosystem management is taken into account, the net uptake of ecosystems is estimated to decrease by 45 % but still indicates substantial C-sequestration. However, when the balance is extended from CO 2 towards the main GHGs, C-uptake by terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems is offset by emissions of non-CO 2 GHGs. As such, the European ecosystems are unlikely to contribute to mitigating the effects of climate change...|$|E

40|$|Methanotrophic {{bacteria}} {{perform a}} central function in our climate system representing the only <b>biogenic</b> <b>sink</b> for the greenhouse gas methane. In wetland rice fields, they function as bio-filters preventing methane produced in anoxic layers escaping into the atmosphere, attenuating the potential methane emission {{by up to}} 90 %. Despite intensive studies in the past, molecular approaches have barely started to explore the full diversity of methanotrophs. Furthermore, only little is known on their ecological niche differentiation and the factors influencing their community structure. This thesis focuses on the aerobic methanotrophic communities in the wetland rice ecosystem using the pmoA gene as a functional and phylogenetic marker to detect these bacteria in the environment. A high diversity could be recorded dominated by Methylocystis and Methylosinus species (type II) and yet uncultivated bacteria grouping within type Ib methanotrophs. The rice paddy cluster 1 (RPC- 1) forms the largest cluster consisting entirely of sequences obtained from paddy fields located around the world. It is only distantly related to cultivated species and might form a new genus of methanotrophs specifically adapted to wetland rice fields. Methanotrophic communities showed no large scale horizontal distribution patterns within an Italian paddy field; thus, a reduced sampling effort is sufficient to extrapolate to the field scale. However, different methanotrophic communities were detected on the rice roots compared to the field soil and the communities in different fields differed significantly. The rice roots were characterized by a high abundance of type I methanotrophs and different rice cultivars were shown {{to have an effect}} on these communities. This effect could be correlated to the plant genotype and enables to select specific cultivars for in-depth studies. Re-evaluating the pmoA gene as a phylogenetic marker for methanotrophs revealed a good correlation of the pmoA to the 16 S rRNA phylogeny. Nevertheless, some exceptions suggests that methanotrophy might be evolutionary more complicated having been even exchanged between species. Furthermore, a meta-analysis of pmoA sequences from various environments revealed distinct correlations of genotypes and habitats...|$|E
40|$|Time {{series of}} <b>biogenic</b> <b>sinking</b> {{particle}} flux {{in the western}} North Pacific subpolar region over two decades (1989 – 2008) revealed that the biogenic CaCO 3 (CC) flux has shown a significant decreasing trend of 2. 7 %[*]year− 1 (annual average, − 0. 88 [*]±[*] 0. 13 [*]mg[*]m 2 [*]day− 1 [*]year− 1) along with the decreasing particulate organic carbon (POC) flux of 0. 7 %[*]year− 1, while the biogenic opal (OP) flux had no long-term trend. Comparing these results with the decreasing rate of satellite-derived surface CC with − 0. 7 %[*]year− 1, we concluded that three fourths of the decreasing trend of CC flux {{was derived from the}} strengthening of CaCO 3 dissolution through seawater column due to the weakening of water ventilation and the rest was from the decline of CaCO 3 -shelled species, indicating the enhancement of the efficiency in oceanic sequestration of atmospheric CO 2 in the sea surface of this region due to the increase of OP/CC ratio...|$|R

Fragilariopsis kerguelensis, Actinocyclus ingens and species of the genus Thalassiothrix were the main contributors to the diatom assemblages. Three main steps marked {{the development of the}} silica system in the Southern Ocean: Step 1 (at ca. 2. 77 Ma), establishment of increased biogenic silica burial in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current area, following the large-scale oceanic reorganization connected to the increased northern hemisphere glaciation; Step 2 (at ca. 1. 93 Ma), the Antarctic Polar Front becomes the main <b>biogenic</b> silica <b>sink,</b> diatom mats are widespread, and are also found slightly to the north and south of the APF; Step 3 (at ca. 0. 63 Ma), with the strong drop in abundance (and later extinction at 0. 38 Ma) of A. ingens and the rise to dominance of F. kerguelensis, the system enters a glacial-interglacial mode, with diatom mats occurring during interglacials at the APF and in the Antarctic Zone, but disappearing north of it...|$|R

40|$|Molecular {{hydrogen}} (H 2) is {{the second}} most abundant reduced gas in the atmosphere, but its biogeochemical cycle is not well understood. This thesis focuses on the soil production and uptake of H 2. The <b>biogenic</b> soil <b>sink</b> of molecular H 2 is the largest (~ 75 % of total removal) and most uncertain term in the global atmospheric H 2 budget. With the large uncertainty, it is difficult to predict how atmospheric H 2 may respond to future changes in climate or anthropogenic emissions. The biological N 2 fixation on land is a poorly understood source of H 2, which contributes approximately 4 % to the total source strength. Although it is globally a minor H 2 source, it has a large local effect on the isotopic composition of H 2, due to its very deuterium-depleted source signature. To constrain the <b>biogenic</b> source and <b>sink,</b> I collected air samples from a grass field at Cabauw and a forest site at Speuld in the Netherlands, and investigated the isotopic fractionation during H 2 soil uptake and the isotopic signature of H 2 emitted from the soil (δDsoil). The H 2 emitted from the soil is expected to be from the N 2 fixation within the soil. Our results show that the deposition velocity (vd) is higher on Speuld forest soil than on Cabauw grassland. The fractionation constant α is 0. 943 ± 0. 013 for Speuld forest soil and 0. 977 ± 0. 051 for the Cabauw grassland. A positive correlation between α and vd has been suggested in previous studies but is not found in our dataset. For selected experiments with strong emission and weak uptake of H 2, the isotopic composition of soil emitted H 2, δDsoil, obtained from a Keeling plot is - 693 ± 71 ‰. However, model calculations considering the influence of soil uptake on the Keeling plot suggests that this number may underestimate the actual δDsoil. An alternative mass balance approach suggests that the actual δDsoil emitted to the atmosphere varies over a range from - 600 ‰ to + 196 ‰. A possible reason could be strong fractionation during removal of H 2 in the soil before it escapes to the atmosphere, which should be investigated in future studies...|$|R

However, the lack of widespread, year-long biogeochemical observations remains an obstacle to understanding the complicated variability of the Arctic marine biological pump. Here we show an early winter maximum of <b>sinking</b> <b>biogenic</b> flux in the western Arctic Ocean and illustrate the importance of shelf-break eddies to biological pumping from wide shelves to adjacent deep basins {{using a combination of}} year-long mooring observations and three-dimensional numerical modelling. The sinking flux trapped in the present study included considerable fresh organic material with soft tissues and was an order of magnitude larger than previous estimates.

40|$|To better {{understand}} carbon cycling in marginal seas, {{particulate organic carbon}} (POC) concentrations, POC fluxes and primary production (PP) were measured in the East China Sea (ECS) in summer 2007. Higher concentrations of POC were observed in the inner shelf and lower POC values {{were found in the}} outer shelf. Similar to POC concentrations, elevated uncorrected POC fluxes (720 – 7300 mg C m − 2 d − 1) were found in the inner shelf and lower POC fluxes (80 – 150 mg C m − 2 d − 1) were in the outer shelf, respectively. PP values (~ 340 – 3380 mg C m − 2 d − 1) had analogous distribution patterns to POC fluxes, while some of PP values were significantly lower than POC fluxes, suggesting that contributions of resuspended particles to POC fluxes need to be appropriately corrected. A vertical mixing model was used to correct effects of bottom sediment resuspension and the corrected POC fluxes ranging from 41 ± 20 to 956 ± 443 mg C m − 2 d − 1, which were indeed lower than PP values. The results suggest that 49 – 93 % of the POC flux in the ECS might be from the contribution of resuspension of bottom sediments rather than from the actual <b>biogenic</b> carbon <b>sinking</b> flux. While the vertical mixing model is not a perfect model to solve sediment resuspension because it ignores biological degradation of sinking particles, Changjinag plume (or terrestrial) inputs and lateral transport, it makes significant progress in both correcting resuspension problem and in assessing a reasonable quantitative estimate in a marginal sea...|$|R
40|$|Oceanic bromocarbons {{are highly}} {{reactive}} {{volatile organic compounds}} and may contribute up to 40 % of stratospheric ozone depletion in mid latitudes. High sea-air fluxes of bromocarbons in the tropical regions have been related to biological cycling in the surface ocean, mainly by phytoplankton and bacteria, but the underlying processes and magnitude of the <b>biogenic</b> sources and <b>sinks</b> are poorly known. In order to understand temporal and spatial fluctuations of oceanic bromocarbon emissions, we studied microbial production and removal processes in the surface ocean during a research cruise with RV ‘Sonne’ (OASIS-Sonne) to the tropical Indian Ocean and combined them with observational data of bromocarbon concentrations {{in the water and}} atmosphere. Water samples were incubated with 13 C-labelled bromoform substrate in gas tight bottles to determine bromocarbon consumption rates. Oxygen production and consumption were monitored to estimate the auto- or heterotrophic process rates in the water body. Additional controls were sterile-filtered to differentiate between biological and chemical processes. Attained rates will be compared to measured depth profiles of bromocarbon concentrations, bacteria and phytoplankton biomass as well as organic matter concentrations...|$|R
40|$|The {{biological}} pump is {{a process}} whereby CO 2 in the upper ocean is fixed by primary producers and transported to the deep ocean as <b>sinking</b> <b>biogenic</b> particles or as dissolved organic matter. The fate of most of this exported material is remineralization to CO 2, which accumulates in deep waters until it is eventually ventilated again at the sea surface. However, a proportion of the fixed carbon is not mineralized but is instead stored for millennia as recalcitrant dissolved organic matter. The processes and mechanisms involved in the generation of this large carbon reservoir are poorly understood. Here, we propose the microbial carbon pump as a conceptual framework to address this important, multifaceted biogeochemical problem.

40|$|Seasonal and interannual {{variability}} in the <b>biogenic</b> particle <b>sinking</b> flux was recorded using multi-year bottom-tethered sediment trap mooring systems in the Northwind Abyssal Plain (Station NAP: 75 ° N, 162 ° W, 1975 m water depth) of the western Arctic Chukchi Borderland. Trapped particle flux at a median depth of 184 m had an obvious peak and dominance of sea ice-related diatom assemblages in August 2011. The observed particle flux was considerably suppressed throughout summer 2012. In the present study, the response of ice algal production and biomass to wind-driven changes in the physical environment was addressed using a pan-Arctic sea ice–ocean modeling approach. A sea ice ecosystem with ice algae was newly incorporated into the lower-trophic marine ecosystem model, which was previously coupled with a high-resolution (i. e., 5 km horizontal grid size) sea ice–ocean general circulation model. Seasonal model experiments covering 2 -year mooring periods indicated that primary productivity of ice algae around the Chukchi Borderland depended on basin-scale wind patterns via various processes. Easterly winds {{in the southern part}} of a distinct Beaufort High supplied nutrient-rich water for euphotic zones of the NAP region via both surface Ekman transport of Chukchi shelf water and vertical turbulent mixing with underlying nutricline water in 2011. In contrast, northwesterly winds flowing in the northern part of an extended Siberian High transported oligotrophic water within the Beaufort Gyre circulation toward the NAP region in 2012. The modeled ice algal biomass during summer reflected the differences in nutrient distribution. The modeled sinking flux of particulate organic nitrogen (PON) was comparable with the time series obtained from sediment trap data in summer 2011. In contrast, lateral advection of ice algal patches of shelf origin during a great cyclone event may have caused a modeled PON flux bias in 2012. Sensitivity experiments revealed several uncertainties of model configurations of ice algal productivity, particle sinking speed, and grazing activities. Extending the year-long measurements is expected to help illustrate the more general features of ice-related biological processes in the Arctic Ocean...|$|R

The hydrographic sections covered a latitudinal range of 6 °S to 63 °N along longitudes 20 °W (CLIVAR line A 16), 52 °W (A 20) and 66 °W (A 22). Over 3700 individual measurements reveal unprecedented detail in the DOC distribution and systematic variations in the mesopelagic and bathypelagic zones of the North Atlantic basin.

However, the long-term fate of North Atlantic atmospheric nitrogen deposition is not well understood. This modeling study evaluated an observed pool of N in excess of Redfield ratios located in the main thermocline as a potential sink for atmospheric N. Modeled atmospheric deposition was added to a coupled ocean ecosystem and circulation model. Results suggest that nearly half of the atmospheric nitrogen entering the North Atlantic is transported to the main thermocline, contributing ~ 15 % of the annual growth of excess N there. Transport mechanisms include differential remineralization of N and P in <b>sinking</b> <b>biogenic</b> particles and physical transport. If atmospheric nutrient inputs from the year 2000 were maintained for 50 years, the model suggests that nutrient deposition would contribute to an increase in excess N of more than 0. 4 μM, or an additional 45 % of the present signal. Quantifying the fate and important transport mechanisms of deposited atmospheric nutrients will improve our understanding of N cycle dynamics in the North Atlantic, as well as improve N 2 fixation estimates based on mass-balance techniques...|$|R

Surface water dAl concentrations were low (median of 2. 5 [*]nM) due to low aerosol deposition and removal by phytoplankton. However, surface water dAl concentrations were enhanced on the Iberian and Greenland shelves (up to 30. 9 [*]nM) due to continental inputs (rivers, glacial flour and ice melt). A negative correlation was observed between dAl in surface waters and primary production, phytoplankton community structure and biogenic opal production.

The iron speciation data are here combined with phytoplankton data to suggest cyanobacteria as a possible source for the iron binding ligands. The organic Fe-binding ligand concentrations were greater than that of dissolved iron by a factor of 1. 5 – 5, thus maintaining iron in solution at levels well above it solubility.

The water column distribution of the Fe(II) suggests biologically mediated production in the deep waters and photochemical production in the euphotic layer.

Sampling was conducted along a transect parallel to the shore, near the retreating ice edge {{at the beginning of}} December, closer to the coast at the beginning of February, and more offshore in late February. Hydrological casts and water sampling were performed at several depths to measure total particulate matter (TPM), particulate organic carbon (POC), biogenic silica (BSi), chlorophyll a (Chl a) and phaeopigment (Phaeo) concentrations. Subsamples were taken for counting autotrophic and heterotrophic pico- and nanoplankton and to assess the abundance and composition of microphyto- and microzooplankton.

The distribution of both metals in the dissolved and particulate phases was assessed along an E-W transect in the eastern tropical North Atlantic (December 2009) and along a meridional Atlantic transect (April-May 2010). The surface water concentrations of particulate and dissolved Al and Ti reflected the previously observed pattern of atmospheric inputs into the Atlantic Ocean. Subsurface minima at stations with pronounced fluorescence maxima were observed, suggesting a link between biological productivity {{and the removal of}} both dissolved and particulate Al and Ti. This may include uptake mechanisms, adsorption and aggregation processes on biogenic particle surfaces and the formation of large, fast <b>sinking</b> <b>biogenic</b> particles, e. g., fecal pellets. Residence times in the upper water column (100 m) of the tropical and subtropical North Atlantic were estimated to range in the order of days to weeks in the particulate phases (Al: 3 - 22 days, Ti: 4 - 37 days) and were 0. 9 - 3. 8 years for Al and 10 - 31 years for Ti in the dissolved phases. Longer residence times in both phases in the South Atlantic are consistent with lower biological productivity and decreased removal rates. In the upper water column, Al was predominantly present in the dissolved form, whereas Ti mostly occurred in the particulate form. Largest deviations in the partition coefficients between the particulate and dissolved phases were found in the surface waters, together with excess dissolved Al over Ti compared to the crustal source. This likely reflects elevated dissolution of Al compared to Ti from atmospheric mineral particle...|$|R
40|$|In the {{interdisciplinary}} network BELCANTO III project (integrated {{study of the}} Southern Ocean Biogeochemistry and Climate interactions in the Anthropocene, funded by BELSPO, Belgian Science Policy) specific attempts are made to determine the export magnitude {{and the fate of}} <b>sinking</b> <b>biogenic</b> materials via a multiproxy approach, including Ba-barite, 234 Th-deficit, bacterial activity, new-production, biomarkers. Earlier work has shown that among these proxies, particulate biogenic Ba in excess of lithogenic Ba (Baxs) is a powerful proxy of organic carbon mineralization in the mesopelagic or twilight zone (100 - 1000 m). During the SAZ-SENSE cruise (Jan. -Feb. 2007) in the Australian sector of the Southern Ocean we studied these different proxies under contrasting regimes of nutrient availability and ecosystem functioning. Baxs profiles between the Polar Front Zone PFZ and the SubTropical Zone STZ eastward of the Tasmanian plateau display the typical maximum at mesopelagic depths, as observed during earlier expeditions. We observed that this Baxs maximum shoals in north-east ward direction between the PFZ and the STZ, following a decrease in the thickness of the upper mixed layer, thus reflecting a close linkage between the location of the twilight zone Baxs signal and the source region from which organic material is exported. We also observed that twilight zone Baxs inventories correlate with the fraction of column integrated (i. e. upper 1000 m) bacterial production occurring in the water column underneath the mixed layer, highlighting the linkage between the occurrence of mesopelagic Baxs and bacterial activity. Organic carbon mineralization fluxes estimated from the Baxs inventories range between 34 to 80 mgC/m 2 /d. These results are compared with primary production and f ratio (from 13 C, 15 N uptake experiments), carbon export production (from 234 Th deficit) and bacterial carbon demand, with the aim to gain insight in the fate of exported material and the existing deep ocean carbon sequestration potential of the studied area. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} {{is the final}} report for DOE grant number DE-FG 02 - 02 ER 63472 : "The impact of enhanced nitrogen fixation on carbon sequestration: a reassessment of the inorganic carbon system in LNLC regions" to Patricia L. Yager at the University of Georgia School of Marine Programs. This project examined the inorganic carbon system associated with nitrogen fixation in the “low nutrient low chlorophyll” (LNLC) regions of the western tropical North Atlantic (WTNA) and subtropical Pacific Oceans. Total dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and alkalinity (ALK) data were measured on seven expeditions. Data have been finalized, checked for quality assurance, and uploaded to the Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center website ([URL] Two manuscripts using this data are published or in press so far and we are current working on two others. The first (Cooley and Yager, 2006, JGR) uses a mixing model to remove the dilution effects of the Amazon River from the WTNA inorganic carbon data set. Once the physical effect is removed, the paper then estimates net community production (NCP) for each station. Enhanced rates of production (over respiration) are seen in the river plume, establishing a large <b>biogenic</b> atmospheric carbon <b>sink</b> in this region that is otherwise a source of carbon to the atmosphere. We note that this sink occurs {{in the absence of}} a measurable nitrate flux, and correlates well with the abundance of diatoms containing endosymbiotic diazotrophs, so it must be supported by nitrogen fixation. The second manuscript (Cooley et al., in press, GBC) compares our WTNA data (from Winter 2001, Spring 2001, and Summer 2003) to previously collected datasets (Ternon et al. 2000, Kortzinger et al. 2003) for the purposes of identifying seasonal and interannual variability in Amazon River-associated carbon sequestration. For the mid-salinity regions of the plume only, we estimate a carbon sink of 15 ± 6 TgC per year. This is a globally significant flux that also agrees well with estimates of carbon fixation supported by nitrogen fixation and also with estimates of carbon flux to depth...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe Southern Ocean is {{the largest}} high-nutrient low-chlorophyll (HNLC) {{region of the world}} ocean. It is now well {{recognized}} that the low biological productivity in this region is mainly due to the limitation of phytoplankton growth by iron. However, in the core of the Southern Ocean, a massive bloom occurs annually above the Kerguelen Plateau. In the context of KEOPS (Kerguelen Plateau and Ocean compared Study) we investigated the three-dimensional distribution of dissolved iron (DFe) concentrations southeast of the island. We show that in surface waters, DFe was low and not significantly different above and outside the plateau (0. 090 ± 0. 034 and 0. 073 ± 0. 014 nM, respectively). By contrast, below 150 m major differences in vertical profiles of DFe were observed. The deep waters above the plateau were clearly enriched, with DFe concentrations up to 0. 6 nM near the seafloor. The regeneration from <b>sinking</b> <b>biogenic</b> material and the input from the sediments are very likely the major processes delivering DFe to the deep water. The deep iron-rich reservoir existing above the plateau was responsible for the natural iron fertilization of the surface water by two different mechanisms: (i) winter mixing provided 5 times more DFe to the surface waters above the plateau than outside and (ii) enhanced vertical gradients of DFe and elevated vertical diffusivity resulted in an 8 -fold higher diapycnal diffusive flux. The natural iron fertilization presented major differences from artificial iron-fertilization experiments carried out in the Southern Ocean. The amount of DFe required to stimulate the biological activity is much less and the mode of addition is clearly different. The quantification of the excess of DFe supplied in the naturally fertilized area leads {{to the conclusion that the}} natural iron fertilization is 10 – 150 times more efficient to export carbon below 200 m than in artificial fertilization experiments. The bloom above the Kerguelen Plateau was contingent to iron fertilization but it was also sustained by continuous input of major nutrients. Thus, the natural fertilization described here mimics quite well glacial period scenarios where iron fertilization of the Southern Ocean might have occurred from below...|$|R
40|$|The {{structure}} and variability of the plankton {{community and the}} distribution and composition of suspended particulate matter, were investigated in the polynya of Terra Nova Bay (western Ross Sea) during the austral summer 1997 / 1998, with the ultimate objective of understanding the trophic control of carbon export from the upper water column. Sampling was conducted along a transect parallel to the shore, near the retreating ice edge {{at the beginning of}} December, closer to the coast at the beginning of February, and more offshore in late February. Hydrological casts and water sampling were performed at several depths to measure total particulate matter (TPM), particulate organic carbon (POC), biogenic silica (BSi), chlorophyll a (Chl a) and phaeopigment (Phaeo) concentrations. Subsamples were taken for counting autotrophic and heterotrophic pico- and nanoplankton and to assess the abundance and composition of microphyto- and microzooplankton. Statistical analysis identified two major groups of samples: the first included the most coastal surface samples of early December, characterized by the prevalence of autotrophic nanoplankton biomass; the second included all the remaining samples and was dominated by microphytoplankton. With regard to the relation of the plankton community composition to the <b>biogenic</b> suspended and <b>sinking</b> material, we identified the succession of three distinct periods. In early December Phaeocystis dominated the plankton assemblage in the well-mixed water column, while at the retreating ice-edge a bloom of small diatoms (ND) was developing in the lens of superficial diluted water. Concentrations of biogenic particulates were generally low and confined to the uppermost layer. The very low downward fluxes, the near absence of faecal pellets and the high Chl a/Phaeo ratios suggested that the herbivorous food web was not established yet or, at least, was not working efficiently. In early February the superficial pycnocline and the increased water column stability favoured the development of the most intense bloom of the season, essentially sustained by micro-sized diatoms (MD). The shift of the autotrophic community toward this size component produced major changes in the composition of particulate matter and determined its export to depth. The particulate organic carbon (POC) /chlorophyll a (Chl a) and Chl a/Phaeo ratios more than halved, biogenic silica (BSi) /POC and BSi/Chl a strongly increased. Downward fluxes were greatly enhanced (reaching the yearly maximum) and essentially occurred via faecal pellets, underscoring the high efficiency of the herbivorous food web. In late February the deepening of the pycnocline, together with the decrease in light intensity, contributed to halting the diatom bloom. The biomass of small heterotrophs (HNF and MCZ) significantly increased relative to the previous period, favouring the shift toward a mistivorous food web (sensu [Ophelia 41 (1995) 153]) and resulting in the retention of biogenic matter in the superficial layer. Only in early February, with the increase in the size of primary producers (essentially represented by micro-sized diatoms), did the grazing food web become efficient [S. Afr. J. Mar. Sci. 12 (1992) 477], fuelling the long-lived carbon pool and enhancing export to depth (and hence carbon sequestration) via the sinking of large diatoms and high amounts of faecal pellets. The conditions predominating in the Terra Nova Bay polynya in mid-summer probably increased the efficiency of the CO 2 pump, possibly causing the Bay to act as a carbon sink...|$|R
