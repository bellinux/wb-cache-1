5|$|Of the 74 players {{drafted by}} the Giants in the first round, 26 played {{at one of the}} running back positions. Of these, 10 were halfbacks and six were fullbacks, and the {{remaining}} 10 are credited as <b>backs,</b> blocking <b>backs,</b> or running <b>backs.</b> Among other frequently drafted positions, the Giants have chosen eight defensive <b>backs,</b> eight offensive tackles, six defensive ends, five wide receivers, four defensive tackles, and four quarterbacks. Five of the Giants' first-round picks attended the University of Notre Dame, more than any other college. Four picks came from Miami, while seven universities have had three players selected. The Giants have held the first overall pick twice, in 1951 and 1965, selecting Kyle Rote and Tucker Frederickson. Three of the team's first-round picks—George Connor, Frank Gifford, and Lawrence Taylor—have been elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame.|$|E

5|$|The flat <b>backs</b> {{of many of}} {{the colossal}} heads {{represented}} the flat bases of the monumental thrones from which they were reworked. Only four of the seventeen heartland heads do not have flattened <b>backs,</b> indicating the possibility that the majority were reworked monuments. Alternatively, the <b>backs</b> {{of many of the}}se massive monuments may have been flattened to ease their transport, providing a stable form for hauling the monuments with ropes. Two heads from San Lorenzo have traces of niches that are characteristic of monumental Olmec thrones and so were definitely reworked from earlier monuments.|$|E
5|$|The {{match between}} the Sheffield FA and the FA {{that took place}} in December 1871 is notable for {{evidence}} of the development of several new positions. As well as the first mention of forwards, sides (now called wingers) were also mentioned. The rest of the team made up the midfield. The Half <b>backs</b> (referred to as centre <b>backs</b> in the modern game) were mentioned a year later. By the mid-1870s it was common to use one goalkeeper assisted by two cover goals and two half <b>backs.</b> The attack was made up of five midfielders and one forward. This produced the 2–2–5–1 formation.|$|E

40|$|<b>Back</b> to <b>back</b> can {{be defined}} as a rule of {{construction}} by which in appropriate circumstances the wording of the reinsurance agreement is to be construed {{in the same way as}} the wording of the underlying policy. The discussion on whether or not two contracts are <b>back</b> to <b>back</b> is always interconnected with the contract wording.

If two contracts are rendered <b>back</b> to <b>back,</b> one contract incorporates terms of other one, and the incorporated terms in the reinsurance contract will hold the same meaning as in the underlying policy. Some clauses that can have their meaning altered by <b>back</b> to <b>back</b> presumption are follow the settlements, follow the fortunes, claims control and claims cooperation...|$|R
