40|$|O objetivo desta pesquisa foi avaliar a corrosão de parafusos auto-rosqueáveis fixados à madeira tratada com soluções preservativas preparadas com creosoto vegetal, em condições de campo. Obteve-se o creosoto vegetal bruto por meio da destilação à temperatura de 110 - 255 ºC do alcatrão vegetal. Uma fração dos destilados foi lavada com solução a 9 % de bicarbonato de sódio, obtendo-se o creosoto vegetal purificado. Ambas as frações foram enriquecidas com 3 % de naftenato de cobre; 3 % de naftenato de zinco; 3 % naftenato de cobalto; 2 % de TBTO; 2 % de tribromofenato de tubutil-estanho; 2 % de pentaclorofenol; ou 0, 4 % de trióxido de arsênico. Foram preparadas 16 soluções, sendo 14 enriquecidas, além do creosoto vegetal bruto e do creosoto vegetal purificado. Estacas confeccionadas com madeira de alburno de Eucalyptus grandis foram tratadas pelo processo de célula- cheia (processo Bethell). Após o tratamento, parafusos auto-rosquéaveis de ferro zincado foram fixados às estacas. O ensaio foi instalado em três localidades da Zona da Mata de Minas Gerais (Viçosa, Ponte Nova e Leopoldina). A corrosividade das soluções de creosoto vegetal foi comparada à causada pelo creosoto mineral. As soluções preparadas com creosoto vegetal purificado foram menos corrosivas que suas similares preparadas com creosoto vegetal bruto, assemelhando-se ao creosoto mineral. The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to evaluate the corrosion of screws fixed into wood treated with preservative solutions of wood tar creosote. The crude wood tar creosote was obtained through distillation of wood tar at 110 - 255 ºC. A fraction of this product was washed with a solution of sodium bicarbonate at 9 %, resulting in purified wood tar creosote. Both fractions were enriched with 3 % of copper naphtenate, 3 % of zinc naphtenate, 3 % of cobalt naphtenate, 2 % of TBTO, 2 % of tributhyl-tin tribromophenate, 2 % of pentachlorophenol, or with 0. 4 % of arsenic trioxide. A total of 16 preservative solutions were prepared, of which 14 were enriched, besides the crude wood tar creosote and the purified wood tar creosote. Stakes made of Eucalyptus grandis sapwood were treated following the full-cell <b>process</b> (<b>Bethell's</b> <b>process).</b> After the stakes treatment, screws of iron covered with zinc were fixed into the wood stakes. The assay was carried out in three locations (Viçosa, Ponte Nova and Leopoldina - in Zona da Mata, Minas Gerais, Brazil). The corrosiveness of solutions of wood tar creosote was compared with the one caused by coal tar creosote. The solutions with purified wood tar creosote were less corrosive than those prepared with crude wood tar creosote, being similar to the coal tar creosote...|$|R

40|$|The {{fixation}} {{mechanism of}} copper chrome arsenate wood preservative is investigated. Parameters examined, include: pressure, solution temperature, solution strength, second stage treatment {{with water and}} oil, initial vacuum and timber pack design. The influence of these parameters is determined by analysing; basic density, penetration, preservative retention and leaching characteristics. Legislative leachate levels are also investigated. The timber used in the trials is kiln dried, structural grade F 5 heartwood and sapwood of Pinus radiata D. Don. Radiata pine roundwood is also used. Two pilot scale treatment plants are utilised during the trials. Processes conducted, are the modified Bethell, Lowry and Alternating Pressure Method (APM). Simulated rainfall is applied to every timber pack after treatment. Significant differences between percentage leachates resulting from the timber packs, {{are determined by the}} Friedman test and multiple comparison analysis. Investigation of leachate concentrations revealed no world legislative standard. Concentration of copper leachate was suggested as a way to monitor leaching in the aquatic environment. In the soil environment, concentration of chromium leachate was recommended. Heartwood penetration was improved and leachate concentration was decreased when the treating pressure was increased. Concentration of chromium and copper leachate also appeared to decrease when the solution temperature was increased. In contrast, at the higher temperatures, the concentration of arsenic leachate increased. Chromium leachate concentration also decreased when solution strength was increased in Lowry or APM treatment of roundwood. A similar trend was noted when treated timber was subjected to a second stage treatment that involved water or oil. A plastic wrap applied to the timber pack also reduced the concentration of chromium leachate. Chromium leachate concentration and heartwood penetration were influenced by the alteration of the initial vacuum in modified Bethell treatment. Heartwood penetration was improved when low pressure treatment was conducted using the Lowry process, rather than the modified <b>Bethell</b> <b>process.</b> Restricted Access: University of Melbourne Staff and Students Onl...|$|E
