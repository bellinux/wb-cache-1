5|$|Once {{posted to}} France in December 1914, the Rhodesian Platoon almost {{immediately}} began suffering regular heavy casualties. Southern Rhodesian volunteers continued to arrive piecemeal in England throughout the conflict, so Rhodesian formations on the Western Front received regular reinforcements in small batches, but because casualties were usually concentrated in far larger groups it often {{took a few}} months for a depleted Southern Rhodesian unit to return to full numerical strength. A cycle developed whereby Rhodesian platoons in Belgium and France were abruptly decimated and then gradually built up again only to suffer the same fate on returning to action. When the KRRC's Rhodesian platoons took part in British offensives, they were easily recognised by a distinctive <b>battle</b> <b>cry</b> that their men shouted as they went over the top. Sometimes the British and German positions were so close that troopers on each front line could hear what was said in the opposite trench; one group of Southern Rhodesians avoided being understood in this situation by speaking a mixture of Shona and Sindebele (two African languages) instead of English.|$|E
5|$|The two armies clashed at Pegae in {{the fifth}} week of the Great Lent, between 11 and 18 March 921. The Byzantine commanders formed their battle lines in the {{lowlands}} near the springs, while the Bulgarians occupied the higher ground. The Bulgarians charged with dreadful <b>battle</b> <b>cry.</b> Their initial blow was irresistible and the Byzantine lines broke. John the Rhaiktor immediately fled and a certain Photinus, son of Platipodos, was killed along with many others while trying to protect him. John the Rhaiktor barely escaped aboard of a dromon. Alexios Mosele, who fled in full armour, drowned with his protomandator while attempting to board a ship. The brothers Pothos and Leo Argyros managed to find shelter in a nearby fortress. In the subsequent rout most of the Byzantine soldiers {{were killed by the}} sword, drowned or were captured by the Bulgarians. After the battle the Bulgarians burned the palaces in Pegae and looted the area north of the Golden Horn waterway on the opposite shore of the walls of Constantinople.|$|E

25|$|The Battle of San Juan del Monte {{took place}} on 30 August 1896. It is {{considered}} the first real battle of the Philippine Revolution, which sought Philippine independence from Spain.

25|$|Piping is {{most common}} {{when there is}} more than one queen in a hive.

25|$|The {{school was}} named after St Crispin, {{the patron saint of}} cobblers, tanners and leather workers.

The Clan encompass families in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, Upper Hungary (Slovakia), Hungary, Transylvania, Belarus, Ukraine, and Prussia. The Clan crest is the Ostoja coat of arms, and the <b>battle</b> <b>cry</b> is Ostoja ("Mainstay") or Hostoja. The Clan adopted the Royal-Sarmatian tamga draco (dragon) emblem.|$|E

25|$|Composer {{and music}} {{publisher}} George Frederick Root gained {{fame and fortune}} {{from a number of}} well-received war songs, including The <b>Battle</b> <b>Cry</b> of Freedom and others. A pair of Chicago-based women, Mary Livermore and Jane Hoge, organized a pair of large expositions, the Northwest Sanitary Fairs, where cash generated from the sale of donated items was later used to purchase medical supplies for the soldiers. Their activities helped spark the postbellum women's rights movement in Illinois. Mary Ann Bickerdyke, a resident of Galesburg, was a noted nurse for the Western armies.|$|E
25|$|The base, {{both before}} and after closure, has been the setting for several movies {{including}} Top Gun, <b>Battle</b> <b>Cry,</b> Here Comes the Navy, and the Abbott and Costello film In the Navy (a song from which, We're in the Navy Now, became the official training tune of the Naval Training Center). The television show , although supposedly set in Florida, was actually filmed in San Diego; the former command building at the then-closed NTC was used as the set for a Marine headquarters. The opening scroll for the television sitcom C.P.O. Sharkey was filmed at the Naval Training Center.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to other European countries, medieval Polish clans were unusually powerful {{compared to the}} Polish monarch. Though each clan {{was found in a}} certain territory, each clan also had family members in many other areas of Poland as they moved during medieval times also to settle down on the property(pl:posag) of their wife's or because they were assigned to settle down and serve the Crown, holding office and in some cases, were granted land in the area. Clan members supported each other in court sessions and in the battles, sharing same <b>battle</b> <b>cry</b> and later sharing same coat of arms. The powerful member was usually also the head of the clan, helping and caring for other clan members, calling for them when need for battle.|$|E

25|$|A taunt is a <b>battle</b> <b>cry,</b> {{a method}} in hand-to-hand combat, sarcastic remark, or insult {{intended}} to demoralise the recipient, or to anger them and encourage reactionary behaviours without thinking. Taunting can {{exist as a}} form of social competition to gain control of the target's cultural capital (i.e. status). In sociological theory, the control of the three social capitals is used to produce an advantage in the social hierarchy as to enforce one's own position in relation to others. Taunting is committed by either directly bullying, or indirectly encouraging others to bully the target. It is also possible to give a response of the same kind, to ensure one's own status. It can be compared to fighting words and trash-talk.|$|E
25|$|A {{few days}} before Pentecost, one of Fredrick's {{soldiers}} named Ludwig of Helfenstein {{reported that he had}} seen a white clad warrior, identified as Saint George, on a white horse attacking the Turks, and the chronicled accounts provide no evidence that anyone doubted him. On the evening of May 13, 1190, Frederick's troops were ordered to confess their sins and received penance. During the battle on May 14, the priests and bishops (at the risk of injury or death) went to the front, among the troops, to pray, wearing their white stoles that made them obvious targets for the Muslims. The invocation of Saint George for help had by then become the standard <b>battle</b> <b>cry</b> of the soldiers. The crusaders prevailed in the battle and captured Iconium on May 16, 1190.|$|E
25|$|When {{the order}} Na shturm, marshch! (Assault, march!) was given, the Soviet {{infantry}} would charge the enemy with shouting the traditional Russian <b>battle</b> <b>cry</b> Urra! (pronounced oo-rah, {{which comes from}} the Turkish word to kill), the sound of which many German veterans found terrifying. During the charge, the riflemen would fire with rifles and submachine guns while throwing grenades before closing in for blizhnii boi (close combat) as close quarter fighting with guns, bayonets, rifle butts, knives, digging tools and their fists were known, a type of fighting that the Red Army excelled at. On the defensive, the frontovik were well known for their skill at camouflaging their positions and for being disciplined enough to withhold fire until the Germans were at close range. Before 1941 Red Army doctrine had called for opening fire at maximum range, but it was quickly discovered that it was preferable to ambush the Germans with surprise fire at close ranges from multiple positions.|$|E
60|$|Presently, {{amidst a}} hideous tumult of shouts, groans, curses, prayers for mercy, and Zulu <b>battle</b> <b>cries,</b> the Boers were all struck down--yes, even {{the two little}} lads and the Hottentot servants.

50|$|Over the years, Sarawak FA {{has used}} several themes and <b>battle</b> <b>cries,</b> {{most notably the}} popular Ngap Sayot, created in 1988 by Mahyan and still in use.

Recently, the Semangat 88 (Spirit of 88) theme is used {{alongside}} Ngap Sayot to emulate {{the success of the}} 1980s team.|$|R
50|$|The {{situation}} {{became more}} dangerous in Lenzburg, where about 100 government soldiers formed {{to resist the}} militia, and brought their guns in position. The Freiämter milita ran toward the militia with wild <b>battle</b> <b>cries,</b> and the government soldiers broke and ran without firing a shot. By 6pm the militia entered Aarau and the commander of government troops surrendered without any resistance.|$|R
