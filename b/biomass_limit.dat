40|$|Counterfactual {{simulations}} of a partial equilibrium {{model of the}} world salmon market suggest safeguard tariffs imposed by the European Commission on salmon imports from Norway, Chile, and the Faroe Islands would do more to punish producers in the named exporting countries than to reward United Kingdom producers. The reason is that export supply is less elastic than import demand on a bilateral basis, which means {{that most of the}} tariff's incidence is borne by the targeted producers rather than EU consumers. The incidence problem is exacerbated by the feed quota (now <b>biomass</b> <b>limit)</b> that Norway uses to limit its production. A marketing fee that expands market demand is shown to be less distortionary than its tariff equivalent, and thus may be preferred from a second-best perspective.

40|$|Although {{bottom-up}} forcing and overfishing {{are known}} to induce shifts in ecosystem states, system changes and their reversibility under each factor are still poorly understood. In this paper, dynamic food web simulations are conducted to evaluate when and why ecological thresholds may be exceeded, and whether bottom-up forcing or fishing {{is more likely to}} induce irreversible ecosystem states. Simulations are conducted using a calibrated food web model of the upwelling system off central Chile (33 - 39 degrees S) and the Ecopath with Ecosim software version 5. 1. The effects of fishing scenarios are explored by changing fishing mortality according to trophic level. The effects of bottom-up forcing scenarios are explored by changing phytoplankton biomass, as a function of sea temperature, at El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and decadal scales. Simulations are carried out for 150 years and impacts, system recovery and regime shifts from each scenario are evaluated using trophodynamic indicators and limit reference points for biomass of functional groups as proxies of food web state and ecological thresholds, respectively. Proportionally distributed fishing along trophic levels is the least harmful fishing scenario, resulting in <b>biomass</b> <b>limit</b> reference points rarely being exceeded and high system recovery. Concentrating fishing at higher and lower trophic levels more likely causes reference points to be exceeded and induces ecosystem changes with low-to-medium recovery potential. No limit reference points are exceeded (or regime shift induced) under ENSO-scale bottom-up forcing. Decadal scale bottom-up forcing has different effects on the system depending on the sequence in which the high and low phytoplankton biomass periods are simulated. A shift from low phytoplankton biomass towards high phytoplankton biomass does not result in <b>biomass</b> <b>limit</b> reference points being exceeded, whereas the opposite sequence results in a large number of limit reference points being exceeded with medium recovery. The interplay between fishing and decadal scale bottom-up forcing indicates that bottom-up forcing can dampen the effects of fishing, whereas fishing increases the number of limit reference points exceeded and decreases the recovery observed under decadal scale bottom-up forcing. Results suggest that fishing (especially unsustainable strategies) is more likely to cause ecological thresholds to be exceeded and to induce regime shifts of low recovery than decadal scale bottom-up forcing. We consider these results of relevance for the management of fisheries in their ecosystem context...|$|E

40|$|Phytoplankton biomass in high-nitrate, low-chlorophyll (HNLC) ocean regions {{exhibits}} a pronounced stability: variation occurs only within {{a narrow range}} of values. The magnitude of this variation has profound ecological and geochemical consequences. While mechanisms believed to set the upper limits to HNLC phytoplankton biomass (iron limitation, microherbivore grazing) have received much recent attention, mechanisms setting the lower limits are largely unknown. The demonstrated importance of planktonic micrograzers, largely protists, in removing phytoplankton biomass in HNLC regions suggests that micrograzer behavioral and physiological capabilities may hold the key. This {{will be the case}} at any level of phytoplankton cell division greater than zero, regardless of the extent of growth rate limitation by resource (e. g. iron, light) availability. Indeed, HNLC plankton dynamics models almost universally include several biological responses that set lower phytoplankton <b>biomass</b> <b>limits</b> and confer temporal stability, including substantial feeding thresholds, zero micrograzer metabolic costs, and no micrograzer mortality at low food levels. Laboratory observations of these same biological responses in protist grazers are equivocal. There are no direct observations of substantive feeding thresholds, and many heterotrophic protists exhibit significant rates of respiration and mortality (cell lysis) at very low food levels. We present several candidate explanations for the discrepancy between laboratory observations and model biological 'requirements'. Firstly, laboratory-derived rate measurements may be biased by use of species and prey concentrations that are not representative of HNLC communities. Secondly, model micrograzer features may be a proxy for other stabilizing phenomena such as spatial heterogeneity ('patchiness') or carnivory (top-down control of rnicroherbivores), though a logical analysis indicates that neither is likely to provide robust stabilization of lower phytoplankton <b>biomass</b> <b>limits.</b> Lastly, the highly plastic feeding capabilities of protist grazers, which include switching between phytoplankton and alternative prey such as bacteria, detritus, and other microherbivores, are a probable locus for stabilization of <b>biomass</b> <b>limits.</b> The extent to which such behavioral plasticity functions on the level of individuals or of species assemblages is unknown. We advocate a coupled modeling and experimental approach to further progress in understanding this key feature of HNLC ecosystems...|$|R

40|$|The paper critiques {{proposals}} for de-carbonizing transport {{and offers a}} potential solution which may be attained by the gradual evolution of the current fleet of predominantly low-cost vehicles via the development of carbon-neutral liquid fuels. The closed-carbon cycles which are possible using such fuels offer the prospect of maintaining current levels of mobility with affordable transport whilst neutralizing {{the threat posed by}} the high predicted growth of greenhouse gas emissions from this sector. Approaches to de-carbonizing transport include electrification and the adoption of molecular hydrogen as an energy carrier. These two solutions result in very expensive vehicles for personal transport which mostly lie idle for 95 % of their life time and are purchased with high-cost capital. The total cost of ownership of such vehicles is high and the impact of such vehicles in reducing greenhouse gas emissions from transport is therefore likely to be low due to their unaffordability for a large number of customers. Conversely, powertrains and fuel systems capable of using renewable alcohols in high concentrations have minimal additional cost over existing models as they are made from abundant materials with low embedded energy levels. The use of ethanol and methanol in internal combustion engines is reviewed and it is found that the efficiency and performance of engines using these fuels exceeds that of their fossil fuel counterparts. Low-carbon-number alcohols and, where necessary, more energy-dense hydrocarbons can be supplied using feed stocks from the biosphere up to the <b>biomass</b> <b>limit</b> from biofuels and, beyond the <b>biomass</b> <b>limit,</b> from the atmosphere and oceans using captured CO 2 and hydrogen electrolysed from water. Using the hydrogen in a synthesized fuel rather than as an independent energy carrier {{can be thought of as}} a pragmatic implementation of the hydrogen economy. This avoids the extremely high infrastructure and distribution costs which accompany the use of molecular hydrogen. The production of liquid fuels from CO 2 and water are reviewed in which fully-closed carbon cycles are theoretically possible with the development of large-scale renewable energy generation and CO 2 capture from the atmosphere. An approach to the latter problem where CO 2 concentration and release based on bipolar membrane electrodialysis, developed by the co-authors from PARC, is described in detail and initial results from a laboratory scale device are reported. The development of a Tri-Flex-Fuel vehicle, capable of operating on any combination of gasoline, ethanol, and methanol, using a single fuel system is also described. The low additional technology and materials costs of such vehicles demonstrates that compatible, affordable transport can be developed which provides a feasible means of vehicle evolution towards decarbonized transport without the consequences of huge stranded assets which would be imposed on the automotive industry by the revolution which would be required to mass-produce hydrogen fuel cell vehicles and battery-electric vehicles...|$|E
40|$|Methane {{production}} in anaerobically incubated soil depends strongly on temperature. Reported values of Q 10, {{which is the}} relative increase in activity after an increase in temperature of 108 C, are between 1. 3 and 28. We attempted to explain this large variation by considering processes underlying methane production, namely anaerobic carbon mineralisation, reduction of alternative electron acceptors and increased methanogenic activity, each having a well accepted Q 10 value of about 2. Q 10 is hypothesised to vary due to a temperature-dependent lag time with alternative electron reduction before methane production starts (in incubation experiments). Slurried peat samples were incubated at 4, 10, 13. 5, 20 and 308 C, and carbon dioxide, CH 4 and fatty acids were intensively monitored for 98 d. The temperature dependence of anaerobic C-mineralisation could be described with Q 10 values of 1. 1 (4 – 13. 58 C) and 1. 5 (13. 5 – 308 C). For other biological processes we assumed a common Q 10 of 2. The experiment at 13. 58 C was used to calibrate a temperature adapted version of a recently developed simulation model. This model was used to study the dynamic interactions of the temperature dependent subprocesses and simulated CH 4 production at dierent temperatures reasonably well. At low temperatures, electron acceptors and methanogenic <b>biomass</b> <b>limit</b> methane production for a longer time leading to low methane production at low temperatures. This explains why the overall Q 10 value calculated from both model (Q 10 2 – 23) and experiment (Q 10 2. 9 – 3. 6) varied in time and was larger than the Q 10 values of the individual subprocesses (Q 10 1. 1 – 2).

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} through simulation {{management strategy}} that stabilise catch levels by setting bounds on the inter-annual variability in Total Allowable Catches (TACs). An integrated modelling approach was used, which modelled both the ‘real’ and observed {{systems and the}} interactions between all system components. The modelling framework therefore allowed evaluation of the robustness of candidate management strategies to both the intrinsic properties of the systems, {{and the ability to}} observe, monitor, assess and control them. Strategies were evaluated in terms of level of risk (measured as the probability of spawning stock biomass falling below the <b>biomass</b> <b>limit</b> reference level for the stock) and cumulative yield. The simulation approach used provides a powerful tool for the examination of the performance of candidate management strategies. It has shown that better management is not necessarily going to be achieved by improving the assessement, since even with a perfect assessment (where the simulated working group knew stock status perfectly) stocks may crash at fishing levels that standard stochastic projections would suggest were safe. Also explicitly modelling the assessment process can result in quite different outcomes than those predicted by the simple projection traditionally used by stock assessment working groups. This is because the simple projection assumes that the status of the stock in the current year is known without error and that the target fishing mortality can be achieved without error. However, in practice the assessment is based on last years data and the effect of any management measure on SSB is only manifest, following the implementation of the quota, {{at the end of the}} following year. The choice of target and fishing mortality levels and minimum stock levels results from ICES interpretation of the precautionary approach. This lead to the definition of fishing mortality and biomass reference points that are intended to prevent over-fishing and to trigger recovery plans when a stock is overfished respectively. Although, fishing mortality and biomass reference points were originally intended to be independent, a fishing mortality level implies a corresponding biomass level. In the case of saithe a fishing mortality of 0. 40 (i. e. the FPA level) would drive the stock to Blim, suggesting that the choice of biomass and target reference points are not consistent for this stock...|$|E

40|$|A {{large part}} of the organic carbon {{transport}} into the deep ocean is carried out by diatoms. A unique diffusion-reaction model for theuptake of silicic acid by a single diatom cell is developed. For the first time, model results show concentration gradients of different silicic acid species, [H:sub: 4 :/sub:SiO:sub: 4 :/sub:] and [H:sub: 3 :/sub:SiO:sub: 4 :/sub::sup:-:/sup:], and of [H:img:=plus. gif:/img:] and [OH:sup:-:/sup:] in the diffusive boundary layer around the cell. It can be stated, that diffusion through the diffusive boundary layer is not a limiting factor for this diatom, even at low Si concentrations. To understand the role of silicic acid as a <b>biomass</b> <b>limiting</b> nutrient in the ocean a larger scale model for the Pacific is presented. The Silicon cycle in the equatorial Pacific has the potential to significantly enhance phytoplankton (i. e. diatom) growth during La Nina phases by H:sub: 4 :/sub:SiO:sub: 4 :/sub: transfer from the EUC into the ocean surface layer. This supports the theory of silica as a <b>biomass</b> <b>limiting</b> nutrient in this area. Despite some simplifications the physical and biological description of the 1988 / 1989 La Nina event was used as an analogue to get some understanding about the silicon sediment record inthe eastern equatorial Pacific at times of the last glacial maximum (LGM). A better approach to diatom productivity at the LGM is the use of silicon isotopes. For the first time, the overall distribution of silicon isotopes in the world ocean has been calculated by integration of a biogeochemical ocean circulation model, HAMOCC 4. The model results can be used to predict opal silicon isotope compositions in the sediment.

40|$|Current {{rates of}} extinctions are {{estimated}} to be around 1000 times higher than background rates that would occur without anthropogenic impacts. These extinction rates refer to the traditional view of extinctions, i. e. numerical extinctions. This thesis is about another type of extinctions: functional extinctions. Those occur when the abundance of a species is too small to uphold the species’ ecologically interactive role. I have taken a theoretical approach and used dynamical models to investigate functional extinctions and threshold values for species’ mortality rates in ecological networks. More specifically, I have derived threshold values for focal species mortality rates at which another species or the focal species itself goes numerically extinct (Paper I-II), or transgresses some predefined threshold abundance (Paper III). If an increased mortality rate of a focal species causes another species to go numerically extinct, the focal species can be regarded as functionally extinct, since its abundance is no longer large enough to uphold its ecologically interactive role. Such functional extinctions are investigated in the first papers (Paper I-II). In the following paper, limits for both increased and decreased mortality rates of species are explored (Paper III). Paper III also extends the basic theoretical idea developed in paper I-II into a more applied setting. In this paper I develop a time series approach aimed at estimating fishing mortalities associated with a low risk that any species in a community transgresses some predefined critical abundance threshold. In the last paper (Paper IV) the community wide effect of changes in the abundance of species is investigated. In the first paper (Paper I) I investigate threshold levels for the mortality rate of species in ecological networks. When an increased mortality rate of a focal species causes another species to go extinct, the focal species can be characterized as functional extinct, even though it still exists. Such functional extinctions have been observed in a few systems, but their frequency and general patterns have been unexplored. Using a new analytical method the patterns and frequency of functional extinctions in theoretical and empirical ecological networks are explored. It is found that the species most likely {{to be the first to}} go extinct is not the species whose mortality rate is increased, but instead another species in the network. The species which goes extinct is often not even directly linked to the species whose mortality rate is increased, but instead indirectly linked. Further, it is found that large-bodied species at the top of food chains can only be exposed to small increases in mortality rate and small decreases in abundance before going functionally extinct compared to small-bodied species lower in the food chains. These results illustrate the potential importance of functional extinctions in ecological networks and lend support to arguments advocating a more community-oriented approach in conservation biology, with target levels for populations based on ecological functionality rather than the mere persistence of species. In Paper II I use the approach developed in Paper I to explore the frequency and patterns of functional extinctions in ecological networks with varying proportions of mutualistic and antagonistic (predator-prey) interactions. The general results from Paper I are also found in Paper II; that is, an increased mortality rate of one focal species often first leads to an extinction of another species rather than to an extinction of the focal species itself. Further, the frequency of functional extinctions is higher in networks containing a mixture of interaction types than in networks with only antagonistic interactions. Overall, this study generalize the findings of paper I for networks containing a variety of interaction types. To make the theoretical approaches developed in paper I-II operational in a management setting I develop a time series approach aimed at estimating ecologically sustainable fishing mortalities in a multispecies fisheries context (Paper III). An ecologically sustainable fishing mortality is here defined as a long-term fishing mortality associated with a multispecies objective which infers a low risk that any species, either the focal species itself or another species, in a community transgresses a critical <b>biomass</b> <b>limit,</b> below which the risk of recruitment failure is high. The approach is exemplified using a statistical food web model of the dominating fish stocks in the Baltic Sea. For the most abundant fish stock a counterintuitive result is found; it is more likely that the multispecies objective is met if its mortality caused by fishing is increased compared to if it is decreased. Further, simultaneous changes of the fishing mortality of a number of interacting species in the food web model shows a much narrower region of possible sustainable fishing mortalities than a single species approach, something that is not captured by current stock assessment models. Altogether these results are governed by indirect effects propagating in the community and pinpoints the need to adopt community dynamical approaches in fisheries management. The population sizes of many species in the world are declining. Negative population trends are particular pronounced in large-bodied herbivores and carnivores, species known to play important regulatory roles in many ecosystems. Although this indicates that the ecological consequence of declining populations of species might be profound, its impact on ecosystem stability remains largely unexplored. In paper IV it is therefore explored how declining populations of rare and common species affects the resilience – recovery rate – of ecological networks. An analytical approximation shows that network resilience is a function of the harmonic mean of the species’ abundances. This means that network resilience is especially sensitive to declining abundances of rare species. Consistent with this analytically derived result, a clear and positive relationship between resilience and the abundance of the rarest species in a broad spectrum of dynamical models of ecological networks is found. Together these results illustrate the potentially negative consequences of declining populations of rare species for the stability of the ecological systems in which they are embedded, and provide ecological arguments for the protection and management of rare species...|$|E

To examine the effect of reduced strain growth rates at non-optimal pH and temperature values, a break even analysis was performed to determine possible reductions in individual strain substrate uptake rates that resulted in the same predicted ethanol productivity as the best pure culture...|$|R
40|$|Most of {{the current}} {{processes}} for bioethanol production {{are based on the}} use of Very-High-Gravity (VHG) technology and the processing of lignocellulosic <b>biomass,</b> <b>limited</b> by the high osmotic pressure and ethanol concentration in the fermentation medium, and by inhibitors resulting from biomass pre-treatments, respectively. Aiming the optimization of strains for industrial bioethanol production an integrated approach was undertaken to identify genes required for simultaneous yeast resistance to different fermentation-related stresses. The integration of previous chemogenomics data was used to identify eight genes whose expression confers simultaneous resistance to high concentrations of glucose, acetic acid and ethanol, chemical stresses relevant for VHG fermentations; and eleven genes conferring simultaneous resistance to different inhibitors present during lignocellulosic fermentations. The expression of BUD 31 and HPR 1 lead to the increase of both ethanol yield and fermentation rate, while PHO 85, VRP 1 and YGL 024 w expression is required for maximal ethanol production in VHG fermentations. Five genes, ERG 2, PRS 3, RAV 1, RPB 4 and VMA 8 were found to contribute to the maintenance of cell viability in wheat straw hydrolysate and/or for maximal fermentation rate of this substrate [1]. Moreover, the yeast disruptome was screened for strains with increased susceptibility to inhibitory compounds present in an industrial lignocellulosic hydrolysate obtained from wheat straw. With this genome-wide analysis, 42 determinants of resistance to inhibitors were identified showing a high susceptibility phenotype compared to the parental strain. The identified genes stand as preferential targets for genetic engineering manipulation to generate more robust and efficient industrial strains...|$|R

Native lignocellulosic <b>biomass</b> provides <b>limited</b> accessibility to cellulase enzymes due to structural features. The investigations were carried out with waste lignocellulosic raw material, consisting of maize stalks and cobs. Enzyme hydrolysis was performed after acid hydrolysis with a cellulasic product. It was established that the enzyme stage, as a first treatment phase, was inefficient. It was found that cellulase activity was considerably improved after acid hydrolysis of a crushed mass. A two-stage process with acidic and then enzyme hydrolysis method was most efficient and promising for obtaining sugars for ethanol production...|$|R
