5|$|After the draft, Latos {{demanded a}} $3 {{million signing bonus}} from the Padres. When the Padres did not meet his demands, Latos {{enrolled}} at Broward College, a junior college, to pitch for their baseball team. As the Padres retained the right to sign Latos until {{the start of the}} 2007 MLB draft, the Padres sent scout Joe Bochy to observe every start Latos made. Latos had a 10–3 win–loss record and a 2.03 ERA. Feeling that Latos was worth the gamble, the Padres paid Latos $1.25 million a few days <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have re-entered the draft in 2007.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, Keating was {{stationed}} in the U.S., sometimes at Banana Creek in Florida, and flew Hellcats to armed services swimming meets. He narrowly escaped serious injury one night at Naval Air Station Vero Beach when he neglected to lower the landing gear on his Hellcat and wrecked the plane in an unexpected belly landing. Due to additional training on new intercept methods and the vagaries of squadron transfers, the war ended <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be deployed to any combat theater.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, {{frontman}} Dave Mustaine {{announced that}} he was disbanding Megadeth due to an arm injury that rendered him unable to play guitar. In a statement published on April 3, 2002, he stated that doctors expected that it would take about a year <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> recover from the injury. However, it was uncertain as to how complete of a recovery it would be. Mustaine stated his hopes to regain the ability to play guitar. He subsequently recovered following months of physical therapy.|$|E

5|$|The game also {{remains the}} only {{national}} championship game to have featured three of the NBA 50 Greatest Players – Jordan, Ewing and Worthy – chosen in 1996 to mark the NBA's 50th anniversary. In addition to Jordan's, Ewing's and Worthy's Hall of Fame NBA careers with the Chicago Bulls, New York Knicks and Los Angeles Lakers respectively (including a combined 9 NBA championships), Floyd was named an NBA All-Star and still holds playoff records for most points in a quarter and half, while Perkins played in the league for 17 seasons. For Jordan's part, his game-winner is often seen as the launching point of his career - the moment that gave him the confidence to become what many {{believe to be the}} greatest basketball player of all time, in no small part due to his clutch performance. Jordan has said multiple times that <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> take game-winning shots with the Bulls, he would sometimes think back to his shot in the 1982 game that propelled North Carolina past Georgetown.|$|E
5|$|Thus Nikephoros' scheme had backfired: Instead of a weak Bulgaria, {{a new and}} warlike {{nation had}} been {{established}} at the Empire's northern border, and Sviatoslav showed every intention of continuing his advance south into Byzantium. The emperor {{tried to get the}} Bulgarians to resume the war against the Rus', but his proposals were not heeded. Then, on 11 December 969, Nikephoros was murdered in a palace coup and succeeded by John I Tzimiskes(r. 969–976), to whom fell the task of dealing with the situation in the Balkans. The new emperor sent envoys to Sviatoslav, proposing negotiations. The Rus' ruler demanded a huge sum <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> withdraw, insisting that otherwise the Empire should abandon its European territories to him and withdraw to Asia Minor. For the time being, Tzimiskes was preoccupied with consolidating his position and countering the unrest of the powerful Phokas clan and its adherents in Asia Minor. He therefore entrusted the war in the Balkans to his brother-in-law, the Domestic of the Schools Bardas Skleros, and to the eunuch stratopedarch Peter.|$|E

25|$|ElBaradei did {{not make}} any clear {{statements}} regarding his intentions {{to run for the}} office; however, he has demanded that certain conditions be met to ensure fair elections accompanied by changes to the constitution that will allow more freedom for independent candidates <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> actually consider running for the presidency.

25|$|In 1544, the Mughal emperor, Humayun, fled to Tahmasp's court {{after he}} had been overthrown by the Pashtun rebel Sher Shah Suri (Sher Khan).

Humayun reluctantly agreed and also gave Tahmasp the strategically important city of Kandahar in exchange for Iranian military assistance against the heirs of Sher Khan and his own rebellious brothers.

25|$|The game, however, was {{particularly}} noted for the sending off of Argentina captain Antonio Rattín after receiving his second caution of the game. The Argentines considered the second caution to be unfair, including Rattín himself, {{who had to}} be escorted from the pitch by police <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> leave. Rattín was booked {{at the start of the}} match for a lunge on Bobby Charlton. Rattín then fouled Geoff Hurst and received a second booking for arguing with the referee.|$|E
25|$|Williamson {{sent the}} Pope a letter expressing his regret about the {{problems}} that he had caused, but did not retract his statements.

Williamson responded that he would do so only after looking at the historical evidence for himself.|$|E
25|$|In 1888 his mother, Pilar Defilló de Casals, who {{was born}} in Mayagüez, Puerto Rico of Catalan ancestry, took him to Barcelona, where he {{enrolled}} in the Escola Municipal de Música. There he studied cello, theory, and piano. In 1890, when he was 13, he found in a second-hand sheet music store in Barcelona a tattered copy of Bach's six cello suites. He spent the next 13 years practicing them every day <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> perform them in public for the first time. Casals would later make his own version of the six suites.|$|E

25|$|James {{called a}} Parliament at Inverness Castle in late August 1428, at which Alexander, Margaret and 'nearly all the notable {{men of the}} north' were arrested.

25|$|Loki {{states that}} they have now handed over the gold, and that gold is cursed as Andvari is, {{and that it will}} be the death of Hreidmar and Regin both.

Further, with the hoard, he will have red gold {{for the rest of his}} life. Hreidmar tells them to leave, and the poem continues without further mention of Loki.|$|E
25|$|In all matches played {{under the}} Laws of cricket with no {{augmented}} playing conditions, the bowler may, {{after he has}} started his run up, but <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> normally {{have been expected to}} release the ball, attempt to run out a non-striker who has strayed outside his crease, with no warning mentioned. If the fielding side appeal the umpire will give the batsman out run out Under Law 41.16. The previous Laws were more restrictive as to when a bowler could attempt this, but they still allowed an attempt up until a bowler entered his delivery stride, which differed from the international game.|$|E
