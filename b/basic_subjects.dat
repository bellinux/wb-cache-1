Anderson {{called the}} structure of Blue's Clues a game that presented its viewers with increasingly challenging and developmentally appropriate problems to solve. Early episodes focused on <b>basic</b> <b>subjects</b> such as colors and numbers, but later the programs focused on math, physics, anatomy, and astronomy. The show's producers believed that comprehension and attention were strongly connected, so they wrote the episodes to encourage and increase their viewers' attention. They used content and production characteristics such as pacing which gave children time to respond, as well as [...] "camera techniques, children's voices, musical cues, sound effects, clear transitions, repeatable dialogue, and visuals." [...] Participation, {{in the form of}} spoken or physical response from the audience, and the mastery of thinking skills were encouraged by the use of repetition, both within {{the structure of}} individual episodes and across multiple episodes. The producers used a variety of formal features, which were auditory, and content features, which consisted of invitations given to the audience, such as [...] "Will you help?" [...] The features were also in the form of both recurrent and unique formats and content. The purpose of the recurrent formats and content, which were similar in every episode, was to increase viewers' attention, comprehension, and participation during key educational lessons.|$|E
