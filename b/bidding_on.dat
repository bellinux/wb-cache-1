5|$|Neither {{of those}} two {{companies}} actually did the construction work. That job was handed off {{to a series of}} subcontractors, each of whom had responsibility on one (or two) of six sections of the pipeline (seven, if the marine terminal is included). <b>Bidding</b> <b>on</b> the subcontracting jobs opened at the end of March, and the contracts were announced on June 12, 1974.|$|E
5|$|Days {{before the}} election, Morrow exposed a {{contract}} {{approved by the}} state Board of Control to purchase cloth from a man named A. S. J. Armstrong at twice its normal price. Black responded to the allegation by temporarily suspending his campaign and ordering an investigation. The investigation revealed that Armstrong was a plumber who was <b>bidding</b> <b>on</b> behalf of his brother-in-law, a former prison official in the Stanley administration. Despite this revelation, Black refused to remove members of the Board of Control. This issue finally sank Black's candidacy; Morrow won the election by more than 40,000 votes.|$|E
5|$|It was {{announced}} that the auction would take place on 23 October 1969, with the diamond listed as lot 133, at Parke-Bernet in New York City. The diamond was flown to Gstaad in Switzerland so that the actress Elizabeth Taylor could see it, and flown back to the United States for the auction. Taylor's husband, the actor Richard Burton, had set a maximum bid of $1 million for the diamond, with his lawyer, Aaron Frosch, <b>bidding</b> <b>on</b> the telephone from London, and Al Yugler of the jewellers Frank Pollock and Sons, bidding in the room for Burton.|$|E

5000|$|In one variant, each player, {{starting}} from the dealer's right and proceeding counter-clockwise, <b>bids</b> <b>on</b> progressively lower card values, according to the peculiar sorting of cards used in the game. Thus, if the first player <b>bids</b> <b>on</b> a Three, the second player can only <b>bid</b> <b>on</b> a King or lower. If a player <b>bids</b> <b>on</b> a Six, the next player can only <b>bid</b> <b>on</b> a Five, Four or Two. Bidding continues until all but one player have passed in a round. This remaining player has then [...] "won the bid" [...] and therefore gets to declare the Briscola, i.e. the trump suit. If he had <b>bid</b> <b>on</b> a Three, for example, he could choose [...] "Three of Cups": the trump suit will be Cups, and the holder of the [...] "Three of Cups" [...] is determined to be the declarer's partner.|$|R

5|$|One such {{solution}} is by bidding: Players take turns <b>bidding</b> <b>on</b> how many moves {{it will take}} them to win the game. The lowest bidder gets the king. Thus, one player may open with a bid of 15turns, the other player may counter with a bid of 14turns, and the first player, more confident {{in his ability to}} escape in 13rounds than in his ability to contain for 14, may bid 13 and take the king's side. If that player does not escape within 13turns, the other player wins. Another workaround is to play a two-round match, in which players switch sides after the first round. If the king escapes both rounds, the winner is the player whose king escaped in the fewest turns.|$|E
5|$|The MBTA begin soliciting {{bids for}} {{pre-construction}} site {{preparation for the}} station and the associated layover yard in June 2012. A $3.75 million contract was awarded and notice to proceed given on November 26, 2012. Site preparation work began in early December. <b>Bidding</b> <b>on</b> a nominally-$27.592 million contract for the primary station and layover yard construction opened in February 2013. Bids came in lower than expected; a $22.9 million contract was awarded on May 22, 2013, for construction {{to be completed by}} the end of 2014. Track and signal work and bridge repairs were placed in separate contracts.|$|E
5|$|Branford is {{the first}} {{previously}} rebuilt station to be further renovated with a second platform. A $60 million bond in February 2011 included $16.5 million for a second platform and pedestrian bridge at Branford, $7.3 million for platform extensions at Guilford, and $11 million to add catenary wires to currently unwired sidings along the line. Construction on the new platform at Branford began in September 2013, and the Guilford work is under way as well. After delays, the enlarged Branford station opened on September 30, 2016, although the north platform was not immediately served by trains. <b>Bidding</b> <b>on</b> a second platform and three-level parking garage at Madison, planned since 2009, was scheduled to begin in 2013 but did not occur. Per the agreement with Amtrak, a second platform is planned {{to be added to}} Clinton station. The project was originally planned to start in early 2012, but has since been indefinitely delayed.|$|E

5|$|During the 1894 {{legislative}} session, Brown advocated and won {{passage of}} several government efficiency measures, including {{a bill to}} transfer certain state governmental expenses to the counties, a bill to reform state printing contracts, and measures clarifying laws governing asylums and charitable institutions. The most significant bill, {{and the one that}} generated the most debate, was a law giving married women individual property rights {{for the first time in}} state history. Other measures passed during the session included a basic coal safety measure, a common school statute, a measure prohibiting collusive <b>bidding</b> <b>on</b> tobacco, new regulations on grain warehouses, and a law providing free turnpikes. Measures advocated by Brown but not enacted by the Assembly included broadening the powers of the state railroad commission, establishing the offices of state bank inspector and superintendent of public printing, and reforming prison management, including separate detention of adolescent criminals. Brown also lobbied for the abolition of the state parole board; when the Assembly refused, Brown vowed to ignore the board's recommendations.|$|E
5|$|Further {{regulation}} of the Columbia's flows was necessary to make the new power plant feasible. Water storage and regulation projects in Canada would be needed, {{as well as a}} treaty resolving the many economic and political issues involved. The Bureau of Reclamation and Army Corps of Engineers explored alternatives that would not depend on a treaty with Canada, such as raising the level of Flathead Lake or Pend Oreille Lake, but both proposals faced strong local opposition. The Columbia River Treaty, which had been discussed between the U.S. and Canada since 1944, was seen as the answer. Efforts to build the Third Powerplant were also influenced by competition with the Soviet Union, which had constructed power plants on the Volga River that were larger than Grand Coulee. On , 1964, the Columbia River Treaty was ratified and included an agreement by Canada to construct the Duncan, Keenleyside, Mica Dams upstream and the U.S. would build the Libby Dam in Montana. Shortly afterward, Washington Senator Henry M. Jackson, who was influential in constructing the new power plant, announced that Reclamation would present the project to Congress for appropriation and funding. To keep up with Soviet competition and increase the generating capacity it was determined that the generators could be upgraded to much larger designs. With the possibility of international companies <b>bidding</b> <b>on</b> the project, the Soviets who had just installed a 500MW hydroelectric generator on the Yenisei River indicated their interest. To avoid the potential embarrassment of an international rival building a domestic power plant, the Department of the Interior declined international bidding. The Third Powerplant was approved and its appropriation bill was signed by President Lyndon Johnson on , 1966.|$|E

25|$|Affiliates {{were among}} the {{earliest}} adopters of pay per click advertising when the first pay-per-click search engines emerged during {{the end of the}} 1990s. Later in 2000 Google launched its pay per click service, Google AdWords, which is responsible for the widespread use and acceptance of pay per click as an advertising channel. An increasing number of merchants engaged in pay per click advertising, either directly or via a search marketing agency, and realized that this space was already occupied by their affiliates. Although this situation alone created advertising channel conflicts and debates between advertisers and affiliates, the largest issue concerned affiliates <b>bidding</b> <b>on</b> advertisers names, brands, and trademarks. Several advertisers began to adjust their affiliate program terms to prohibit their affiliates from <b>bidding</b> <b>on</b> those type of keywords. Some advertisers, however, did and still do embrace this behavior, {{going so far as to}} allow, or even encourage, affiliates to bid on any term, including the advertiser's trademarks.|$|E
