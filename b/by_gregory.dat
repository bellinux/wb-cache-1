5|$|Deanesly and Grosjean's thesis was {{addressed}} and refuted by the textual research of Paul Meyvaert, following whose work most scholars {{have come to}} accept the Libellus as a genuine letter of Gregory. The only portion of the Libellus that Meyvaert could not accept as genuine was the chapter on marriage, which Meyvaert (like Boniface before him) believed {{could not have been}} written <b>by</b> <b>Gregory.</b> Meyvaert therefore pronounced this chapter to be the single interpolation in an otherwise genuine document. All subsequent scholarship up until the year 2008 has followed him on this point. In 2008 Ubl not only showed that the marriage chapter was in fact authored <b>by</b> <b>Gregory,</b> but he also explained exactly how it was the Boniface and later historians came to misunderstand its meaning.|$|E

5|$|In 2010, the {{increased}} robustness of Balaur {{was compared to}} parallel changes seen in isolated herbivorous mammals. In 2013, it was claimed that Balaur was the only vertebrate predatory island species known to have become more robust and {{it was suggested that}} its broad feet had evolved to improve stability. The 2015 interpretation of Balaur as an omnivorous member of the Avialae, suggested it was the descendant of a flying species that had developed a larger size similar to the development in several other island herbivores. This would then be a rare instance of secondary flightlessness in a paravian looking like a dromaeosaurid, as predicted <b>by</b> <b>Gregory</b> S. Paul.|$|E

5|$|The {{mission was}} part of a {{movement}} <b>by</b> <b>Gregory</b> to turn away from the East, and look to the Western parts of the old Roman Empire. After Gregory, a number of his successors as pope continued in the same vein, and maintained papal support for the conversion of the Anglo-Saxons. The missionary efforts of Augustine and his companions, along with those of the Hiberno-Scottish missionaries, were the model for the later Anglo-Saxon missionaries to Germany. The historian R. A. Markus suggests that the Gregorian mission was a turning point in papal missionary strategy, marking the beginnings of a policy of persuasion rather than coercion.|$|E
