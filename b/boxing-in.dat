50|$|The Lotus Seven and Dutton replica {{designs that}} {{inspired}} the Bantam were built using a space frame. Blakely chose a somewhat simpler design using 14-gauge metal tubing with some <b>boxing-in</b> around the engine compartment. This frame was more three-dimensional than the frame used on the company's larger Bearcat and Bernardi models, and presumably stiffer. It did not, however, have sheet metal fixed directly to frame members, a stiffening approach used around the transmission tunnel and passenger area in some designs similar to the Lotus Seven. Instead, a separate fiberglass body was mounted on the pre-fabricated chassis, bolting into place at several points. The Pinto donor's lower front A-arms {{were used in the}} front suspension, with factory-supplied upper A-arms. The rear suspension was built by cutting the donor's leaf springs in half, and mounting one left half and one right half behind the cab to suspend and locate the solid rear axle.|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 227 - 244) This thesis aims {{to critique}} racial identity literature and challenge normative racial constructs that omit Multiracial identity experiences. It does this by examining monoracial and Multiracial identity development research and by presenting the author???s autohistoria/autoethnography and artful actions as counter-narratives. The author???s complex {{experience of being}} Multiracial in the U. S. is revealed. Informed by Gloria Anzald??a???s concept of the Borderlands (2007) and Chicana feminism???s resistance to fragmentation, the embodied practices of creating art and self-narratives are used as methods to (re) member and reexamine identity experiences. These acts become strategies for crossing monoracial boundaries and resisting the rigid <b>boxing-in</b> and labeling of racial identities...|$|E
