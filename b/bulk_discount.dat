In today’s market structure consumers {{are looking for}} goods {{for which there is}} a delay in deterioration. At the same time, the consumers’ willingness to wait has been decreased over time, which leads to lost sales. Moreover in financial decision-making, the effects of inflation and time value of money cannot be oblivious to an inventory system. In this scenario, managing inventory of goods remains a challenging task for the decision makers, who may also have to rent warehouse under different prevailing factors such as, <b>bulk</b> <b>discount,</b> limited space in the retail outlet, or increasing inflation rates. With a focus on reduction of costs and increasing customer service, warehouse decision models are crucial for an organization’s profitability. Hence a mathematical model has been developed in the view of above scenario, {{in order to determine the}} optimal policy for the decision maker, by minimizing the present worth of total cost. The optimization procedure has been illustrated by a numerical example and detailed sensitivity analysis of the optimal solution has been performed to showcase the effect of various parameters.

40|$|This paper studies {{international}} roaming markets in Europe. The object {{of this paper}} is to conclude, why {{international roaming}} prices are very high. The main question is whether the prices are high because of collusion or because of some other reasons. I approach this question by modeling different factors that might raise prices. I use the following three articles in modeling: Shy (2001), Kultti and Leppämäki (2004) and Salsas and Koboldt (2003). Other important references of this paper are: Economides (1996) and Laffond and Tirole (2000). I also study if collusion can be equilibrium in international roaming markets and distinguish different factors that favor collusion. In addition I use the related industrial organization, access pricing and network economics theories in my analysis. In chapter four I discuss that self-sustaining collusion can work for MNOs in international roaming and is more consistent with reality than the fully competitive example. In addition, I distinguish many factors that favor collusion in international roaming markets. I also reason that a collusive strategy across and inside country borders can be equilibrium. On the other hand, I show that inter operator tariffs (IOTs) can be high in competitive markets yet because of imperfect traffic direction systems. <b>Bulk</b> <b>discount</b> are used aside with traffic direction. Modeling bulk discounts prevails that bulk discounts probably increase the usage of roaming services. It is not clear how they affect to prices. In addition I reason that consumer behavior and negotiations rules have features that mute competition and thus probably raise prices. Modeling alliances prevails that it is probable that alliances increase wholesale prices. This reflects to retail prices as well. In addition the prices that alliance MNOs apply are probable higher than what non alliance members apply. Even though international roaming markets have many features that might raise prices I come to the conclusion that mobile network operators are engaged in tacit collusion in Europe.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} three interrelated aspects around Frequent Flyer Programs (FFPs) : the cash-equivalent value (purchasing power) {{of loyalty}} currency, {{the impact of}} FFPs on consumer behaviour and surplus, and the taxation issues surrounding FFPs. Unlike most previous research on FFPs, this research uses data from an actual FFP, specifically the Virgin Australia Velocity Rewards program, to examine these aspects. The focus on one specific FFP and using its detailed data is a contribution to FFP literature in itself. No prior research has investigated {{the impact of a}} specific FFP on its members. The first aspect investigated is the estimation of the cash-equivalent value of Velocity Points, the loyalty currency of the Velocity Rewards program. Using publicly available Velocity Rewards data the cash-equivalent value of a Velocity Point in 2010 is estimated to range between AU$ 0. 0066 and AU$ 0. 0084. This range excludes the value of status benefit to the status member. The Velocity Points gained by a FFP member per flight equate to an in-kind discount on an average airfare of 3. 3 per cent for Red members, 3. 96 per cent for Silver members and 4. 63 per cent for Gold members. The second aspect under consideration is whether the Velocity Rewards program can impact its members such that they fly more and/or spend more with Virgin Blue. This aspect is investigated with a proprietary stated-preference dataset from the Velocity Rewards program spanning three years from 2006 to 2008. A particularity of this dataset is that the FFP changed in 2007 from a simple <b>bulk</b> <b>discount</b> program to a complex status-tier program. By taking advantage of this ‘quasi’ experiment provided by the dataset across two very different program structures, it is shown that members change their consumption behaviour particularly when close to the next status tier threshold in order to achieve higher tier status. This is an expected reaction to frequent flyer programs and is what the airlines aim to achieve. Members buy more airfares and at higher prices. This thesis shows that under the new status-tier structure, the consumer surplus of FFP members has decreased by around 6 per cent. This implies that the introduction of the status-tier structure has been a successful strategy for Virgin Blue. The status-tier structure has allowed for a noticeable increase in the efficiency of Virgin Blue to extract additional consumer surplus from Velocity Rewards members. A detailed survey undertaken in 2010 among a representative sample of over 3300 Velocity Rewards members confirms the impact of the FFP on consumer behaviour. The most interest finding of the survey is that a large proportion of leisure and business travellers admitted a willingness to pay a higher fare – a FFP premium- to fly with Virgin Blue because of their Velocity Rewards membership. The average FFP premium is estimated to be around 8 per cent and is statistically different between leisure and business travellers. The cash-equivalent value of a Velocity Point as encapsulated in the FFP premium is estimated to range between AU$ 0. 0108 and AU$ 0. 0153, depending on the FFP status of a member. The final aspect considered in this thesis is the taxation of FFP rewards in Australia. Although it has long been recognised that FFP rewards earned on employer-funded business flights should be subject to taxation, this is currently not taking place. One of the main arguments against the implementation of taxation is the lack of a monetary tax base. This thesis argues that the cash-equivalent value of loyalty currency can be estimated with public data and is appropriate as a tax base. The legal hurdles to FFP reward taxation in Australia are also addressed. This thesis makes the following contributions to the knowledge on FFPs: • It is shown that a cash-equivalent value of loyalty currency can be estimated. • It is shown that Velocity Rewards impacts consumer choices, willingness to pay and consumer surplus. • It is shown that Velocity Reward members admit paying a FFP premium and that the magnitude of this premium can be estimated. • It is shown that taxation of FFP rewards in Australia is possible. Finally, the majority of these insights were gained with data that have not been available to researchers previously...|$|E
