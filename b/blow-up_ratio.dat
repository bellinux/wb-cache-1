5000|$|A spiral die is {{the most}} complex {{of the three major}} blown film die types. The polymer melt is evenly {{distributed}} into several feed tubes, which wind around a central mandrel. Each of these feed tubes is connected to the space between the mandrel and outer die walls; the feed tubes gradually diminish in diameter as they spiral around the mandrel. At the same time, the space between the mandrel and outer die walls is increased. This allows the polymer melt to layer and blend, resulting in a uniform melt profile free of weld lines. This die design produces the most uniform films, but is also the most expensive. Air pressure is introduced through the extrusion die so that after the polymer melt leaves the lip of the die, it expands in circumference. The tubing is also drawn along its length faster than it is being extruded. This leads to thinning of the film as it is expanded in both the draw (or machine) direction, and in the transverse (or hoop) direction. The ratio of the blown diameter to the extruded diameter is known as the <b>blow-up</b> <b>ratio,</b> and affects the resulting physical properties of the film, such as stiffness and strength. Film thickness and <b>blow-up</b> <b>ratio</b> can be varied by altering the take-up rate of the rollers, the internal pressure in the blown tube, and the melt extrusion rate.|$|E

Three different dies were used and for each die the throughput (mass flow rate), freeze line height and <b>blow-up</b> <b>ratio</b> were varied, with take-up velocity adjusted to give a fixed nominal gauge (film thickness). One polymer (a low density polyethylene) was used throughout and the extrusion temperature was also kept constant...|$|E
40|$|A Masters Dissertation, {{submitted}} in partial fulfilment of {{the requirements}} of the award of Master of Science of Loughborough University. Melt capillary flow has been employed to characterise some low density polyethylene grades, differing in degree of an incorporated slip agent (Olemide Commercial). The same grades were processed into blown film under different extrusion conditions by varying screw speed, <b>blow-up</b> <b>ratio</b> and haul-off rate. The rheological properties affected by the slip agent were, namely, the melt viscosity and the critical shear-rate, after which fracture (turbulence) of the given extrudate occurred. Ease of draw-down property was found to be lower for the low slip grades and increased significantly with increasing degree of slip. (ASTM) and (B. S.) methods were used to test the mechanical properties of the films produced from the film-blowing process under the same above extrusion variables. The effect of these variables on tensile, tear and impact strengths of each grade were analysed. Orientation of the molecular structure, during its passage through the die and immediately after extrusion, as a result of longitudinal or transverse direction drawing strongly affected these properties. Increasing the extrusion variables, generally, resulted in a balanced orientation in both machine and transverse directions (balanced film) and an optimum <b>blow-up</b> <b>ratio</b> was found for a film of balanced strength properties. An attempt was made to correlate characteristics of flow of the different polyethylenes with the above extrusion variables and, hence, with the mechanical properties of the consequent films...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{explores the}} possibility of improving PLA&# 039;s properties to satisfy and extend its processing applications such as in blown film production. Branched PLA (B-PLA) and linear/branched PLA (L,B-PLA) samples were blended with polyethylene glycol (PEG) with Mw of 1, 000 g/mol, as a plasticizer, in various PEG concentrations (0, 5 and 10 wt%). Melt strength measurement by Rheotens experiment was used to verify {{the possibility of}} using some of those blends for packaging film production by blown film extrusion. The results showed that the neat B-PLA and L,B-PLA exhibited similar level of melt strength properties. The increase of PEG content decreased the melt strength values, but increased the drawability. The L,B-PLA system showed greater strain hardening behaviour than B-PLA system. Hence, the most beneficial composition (L,B-PLA with 10 wt% of PEG) was used to produce film at varying <b>blow-up</b> <b>ratios</b> of the bubble at 2. 5 : 1 and 3. 2 : 1. It was found that blending of linear and branched PLA, with the addition of PEG as a plasticizer, can be tailored to meet the requirements for film manufacturing as well as the achievement in film extensibility...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{developments}} on the experimental infrastructure and {{the acquisition of}} new detectors on the Dutchâ€“Belgian beamline BM 26 B at the ESRF offer novel and promising possibilities for synchrotron X-ray experiments {{in the field of}} polymer crystallization under processing-relevant conditions. In this contribution, some of the most recent experiments mimicking conditions similar to those relevant for the plastics processing industry are discussed. Simultaneous thermal analysis and wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) experiments, at the millisecond time-frame level, on -nucleated isotactic polypropylene (i-PP) samples subjected to ballistic cooling up to 230 K/s, show that the efficiency of the nucleating agent can be suppressed when quenched cooling rates higher than 130 K/s are used. In situ WAXS experiments using small scale industrial equipment during a real film blowing process reveal the dependence of the onset of crystallinity (the so-called freeze line) and the crystal orientation as a function of different take-up and <b>blow-up</b> <b>ratios.</b> In situ small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) experiments during high-flow fields reveal the formation of shish and kebab structures in i-PP {{as a function of the}} imposed stress. Quantitative analysis of i-PP flow-induced structures is presented. The beamline specifications required to obtain high quality and industrially relevant results are also briefly reported...|$|R
40|$|A {{method is}} set forth for {{assessing}} strain-rate profiles {{that can be}} used to develop a scale-up theory for blown-film extrusion. Strain rates are evaluated by placing four ink dots on the stalk of an extruded bubble to follow the displacements of the dots as a function of time. The instantaneous Hencky strain is obtained with the displacement data and plotted for analysis. Specific attention is given to potential sources of error in the distance measurements and corrections for these complex bubble geometries. The method is shown to be effective for deriving strain-rate data related to different processing parameters for the production of balloon film. The strain rates can be compared to frostline height, <b>blow-up</b> <b>ratio,</b> and take-up ratio to optimize these processing variables...|$|E
40|$|The on-line {{morphological}} development during {{film blowing}} of 2 different linear low density polyethylenes (LLDPE) and {{a blend of}} LLDPE with low density polyethylene (LDPE) has been investigated, for the first time, using synchrotron Small Angle X-Ray Scattering (SAXS). The processing conditions, <b>blow-up</b> <b>ratio</b> and take-up ratio, have been varied and the resulting lamellar thickness, linear crystallinity and orientation evolution in machine direction is obtained from {{a detailed analysis of}} SAXS data. Ex-situ SAXS and wide angle X-ray Diffraction (WAXD) confirmed the effect of molecular structure and composition on structure evolution observed in the on-line experiments. The results obtained provide a valuable set of data for the understanding of the film blowing process and can be used to extend and improve numerical model...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} two {{important}} parameters of film blowing process, i. e., take-up ratio andblow-up ratio, {{on the overall}} orientation of low-density blown films have been inves-tigated using birefringence measurements. Furthermore, by combining X-ray dif-fraction pole figure analysis and birefringence, the White and Spruiell biaxial orientation functions have been determined for afformentioned sample. Within the range of pro-cessing condition studied, increasing take-up ratio, increases orientation in both machine and transverse direction. Upon increasing <b>blow-up</b> <b>ratio,</b> orientation in the transverse direction increases and the overall orientation state approaches to equal biaxial one. Characterization of the crystalline regions by pole figure analysis reveals that a and b crystallographic axes preferentially orientate in the film plane and the direction normal to it, respectively. The amorphous regions {{do not have any}} preferential orientation...|$|E
5000|$|LDPE and LLDPE have unique {{rheological}} or {{melt flow}} properties. LLDPE is less shear sensitive {{because of its}} narrower molecular weight distribution and shorter chain branching. During a shearing process, such as extrusion, LLDPE remains more viscous and, therefore, harder to process than an LDPE of equivalent melt index. The lower shear sensitivity of LLDPE allows for a faster stress relaxation of the polymer chains during extrusion, and, therefore, the physical properties are susceptible to changes in <b>blow-up</b> <b>ratios.</b> In melt extension, LLDPE has lower viscosity at all strain rates. This means it will not strain harden the way LDPE does when elongated. As the deformation rate of the polyethylene increases, LDPE demonstrates a dramatic rise in viscosity because of chain entanglement. This phenomenon is not observed with LLDPE {{because of the lack}} of long-chain branching in LLDPE allows the chains to slide by one another upon elongation without becoming entangled. This characteristic is important for film applications because LLDPE films can be downgauged easily while maintaining high strength and toughness. The rheological properties of LLDPE are summarized as [...] "stiff in shear" [...] and [...] "soft in extension". It is not taken in most curbside pickups in communities. LLDPE can be recycled though into other things like trash can liners, lumber, landscaping ties, floor tiles, compost bins, and shipping envelopes ...|$|R
40|$|A {{commercial}} {{low-density polyethylene}} (LDPE) {{was used to}} produce bi-oriented blown films under different operating conditions, using a prototype laboratorial extrusion line developed in-house {{for the production of}} both conventional and bi-oriented films. Correlations were established between parameters describing the thermo-mechanical history associated with each condition, process stability, level of orientation developed, and final film properties. Process stability was judged qualitatively, in terms of bubble stability and film thickness homogeneity. Orientation levels were estimated from thermal shrinkage measurements. Mechanical and optical properties were determined by uniaxial tensile testing and haze and gloss measurements, respectively. Bi-orientation temperature, stretching ratio (defined by the <b>blow-up</b> and draw-down <b>ratios)</b> and cooling conditions (determined by cooling air flow rate and velocity) strongly influence the orientation levels induced and, consequently, the final film characteristics.

40|$|The {{morphology}} of ionic aggregates in semi-crystalline Zn- and Na-neutralized poly(ethylene-ran-methacrylic acid) (EMAA) ionomer blown films {{has been}} explored with scanning {{transmission electron microscopy}} (STEM) and small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS). The ionic aggregates of Zn-EMAA are spherical, monodisperse and uniformly-distributed in as-extruded pellets and blown films prepared at low and high <b>blow-up</b> <b>ratio.</b> Thus, although the biaxial stresses of film blowing are sufficient to alter the PE superstructure, the ionic aggregates in Zn-EMAA are unaffected. In contrast, the morphology of Na-EMAA as detected by STEM changes from featureless in the as-extruded pellets to a heterogeneous distribution of Na-rich aggregates in the blown films. This transformation in Na-EMAA morphology is consistent with our earlier study of quiescent annealing suggesting that the morphological change is the result of thermal processing rather than the biaxial stresses of film blowing...|$|E
40|$|International audienceBiaxially {{oriented}} linear {{low density polyethylene}} (LLDPE) {{films are}} produced using the double-bubble process with different machine direction (MD) orientation levels and the same transverse direction (TD) <b>blow-up</b> <b>ratio.</b> Their mechanical behavior is characterized in terms of the tensile strength and tear resistance. The microstructure and orientation are characterized using microscopy, x-ray diffraction (XRD), and Fourier transform infra red spectroscopy (FTIR). The results indicate that MD tensile strength increases with increasing MD stretching (draw) ratio while the TD tensile decreases. Tear resistance remains mainly constant in TD and decreases in MD with increases in draw ratio. Morphology analysis reveals that overstretching lamellae tend to align perpendicular to MD with an increase of their lamellar dimensions. c-axis orientation of lamellae in MD increases with draw ratio while a-and b-axes orient towards normal direction (ND) and TD respectively. A good correlation is observed between c-axis orientation and MD tear resistance and tensile strength...|$|E
40|$|Water vapour {{transmission}} (WVT) {{characteristics of}} blended polyethylene films blown from a 45 mm single-screw extruder were examined. For a given die gap size and <b>blow-up</b> <b>ratio,</b> {{it was found}} that WVT basically had an exponential decaying relationship with increasing film thickness. For a given film thickness, molecular orientation on the film in the machine direction could be increased by increasing the size of the die gap. It was found that WVT of blended polyethylene films which involved some proportion of long chain side molecular branches components were more susceptible to die gap size effect than those films only involving linear type molecules. This was thought to be attributed to the more molecular orientation in the machine direction. The results showed that for a given degree of orientation in the transverse direction, WVT decreased if film thickness and die gap size increased. This study also demonstrated that lower WVT required longer saturation time and smaller amount of saturated water vapour obtained. published_or_final_versio...|$|E
40|$|In this work, {{coextrusion}} experiments utilizing {{an industrial}} 9 -layer Brampton Engineering coextrusion film blowing {{line has been}} performed under different processing conditions (low/high air cooling intensity) in order to evaluate variational principles based modeling approach using energy equation utilizing variable heat transfer coefficient along the multi-layer bubble.

Moreover, {{it has been found}} that if the freezeline height becomes long, heat transfer coefficient starts to vary significantly along the bubble which has crucial impact on the temperature profile along the multi-layer bubble. The performed theoretical parametric study revealed that increase in <b>blow-up</b> <b>ratio</b> or decrease in bubble curvature and air temperature causing bubble cooling efficiency increases, which allows to cooled down the multi-layer bubble for the given freezeline height to solidification temperature by smaller amount of the air volume flow rate...|$|E

40|$|Thermoplastic {{cellulose}} acetate (CA) is a bio-based polymer with optical, mechanical and thermal properties {{comparable to those}} of polystyrene (PS). The substitution of the predominant petrol-based PS in applications like foamed food trays can lead to a more sustainable economic practice. However, CA is also suitable for more durable applications as the biodegradability rate can be controlled by adjusting the degree of substitutions. The extrusion foaming of CA still has to overcome certain challenges. CA is highly hydrophilic and can suffer from hydrolytic degradation if not dried properly. Therefore, the influence of residual moisture on the melt viscosity is rather high. Beyond, the surface quality of foam CA sheets is below those of PS due to the particular foaming behaviour. This paper presents results of a recent study on extrusion foamed CA, using a two-component physical blowing agent system compromising HFO 1234 ze as blowing agent and organic solvents as co-propellant. Samples with different co-propellants are processed on a laboratory single screw extruder at IKV. Morphology and surface topography are investigated with respect to the blowing agent composition and the die pressure. In addition, relationships between foam density, foam morphology and the propellants are analysed. The choice of the co-propellant has a significant influence on melt-strength, foaming behaviour and the possible <b>blow-up</b> <b>ratio</b> of the sheet. Furthermore, a positive influence of the co-propellant on the surface quality can be observed. In addition, the focus is laid on the effect of external contact cooling of the foamed sheets after the die exit...|$|E
40|$|The {{manufacturing}} of blown films made of {{thermoplastic materials}} {{is considered an}} important processing technique for polymer raw material. Today, one goal of the further development of the blown film extrusion is the reduction of raw material application while maintaining or {{improving the quality of}} the film, also in regard of the mechanical properties. Therefore, the mechanical film properties, as a key aspect on the way to create thinner films, move into the focus of interest. Up to now, a generic and recognised calculation model, which predicts the film properties in the blown film extrusion process, is not available. Hence, large imponderability in predicting film properties for new product development or the change of material or the production line result to the film manufacturer. Therefore, the proposal of a calculation model in order to predict the mechanical characteristic values of the blown film extrusion {{is the subject of this}} work. The model developed in the course of this work, in order to predict the blown film properties, is based on the foundation of statistical modelling. The corresponding mechanical characteristic values form the start values of the model. As input value, dimensionless process characteristic values are being chosen, in order to ensure the transferability of the statistical property model on different materials and production lines. Therefore, next to the known characteristic values of the blown film process, <b>blow-up</b> <b>ratio</b> and take-up ratio, additional process characteristic values are being introduced. All used process characteristic values have in common that they describe the process state in the bubble expansion zone because the blown film properties are being fixed there. The results show that it is on principle possible to describe the mechanical blown film properties with statistical models by the use of process characteristic values. The results of shrinkage and strain at 100 % stretch are to be judged as good, while the results of the calculation of Youngâ€™s modulus and tensile strength can be used to assess the properties roughly. The transferability of the model to different materials and blown film lines has been realised only to a limited extend. For a possible improvement, further research is necessary. Some approaches by the use of additional material- or plant-specific characteristic values have been shown already...|$|E
