40|$|Abstract. Due to poor {{water quality}} in the initial <b>backfill</b> well {{constructed}} in 1981 at the Caballo Mine, the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality, Land Quality Division required that the mine drill more <b>backfill</b> wells in the small area surrounding the initial well. The water quality results from these wells led {{to a number of}} landmark studies on <b>backfill</b> water quality and the behavior of selenium, nitrogen, and organic carbon in <b>backfill</b> waters. Although it was thought at the time that these water quality results would be typical for the Powder River Basin (PRB), the benefit of experience with other <b>backfill</b> wells in the PRB and a review {{of the history of the}} <b>backfill</b> surrounding these original <b>backfill</b> wells, indicates that the high total dissolved solids (TDS), selenium, and nitrogen concentrations observed in the early <b>backfill</b> area are not typical of <b>backfill</b> wells at Caballo. These high concentrations are a product of the <b>backfill</b> material used near the wells and their location. Selenium and nitrogen concentrations in the <b>backfill</b> waters are now very low in the initial <b>backfill</b> area. Moreover, the water {{quality in the}} initial <b>backfill</b> area and other resaturated or partially-resaturated <b>backfill</b> areas at Caballo is also similar to or better than premining water quality in the area surrounding these wells.

40|$|A {{significant}} amount of work has been directed toward the improvement of mine <b>backfill</b> during the past decades. Paste <b>backfill</b> was recently introduced as a superior support system for underground hard rock mining operations. The {{aim of this study}} is to examine the applicability of paste <b>backfill</b> to full scale underground operations. The Tailspinner system was developed to produce paste <b>backfill.</b> This system dewaters the full stream tailing material from approximately 55 % to 24 % water content. These densified tailings are mixed with cement prior to placement in a stope. The utilization of paste <b>backfill</b> possesses several economical and mechanical advantages. Paste <b>backfill</b> however, contains a high proportion of ultra fine solids, which results in a material of very low permeability. Hence, the question of liquefaction susceptibility of this material becomes important. This investigation is directed primarily towards the behavior of paste <b>backfill</b> when subjected to static and dynamic loading conditions. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the liquefaction resistance of paste <b>backfill.</b> However in order to accomplish this goal, studies also have to be made into the static characteristics. The behavior of both reconstituted and undisturbed samples were investigated. A comprehensive testing program on paste <b>backfill</b> samples was carried out. The static testing program was conducted to define the strength and deformation characteristics of paste <b>backfill.</b> The influence of cement and water content on static properties of paste <b>backfill</b> were investigated. The liquefaction resistance of paste <b>backfill</b> was evaluated based on several mechanisms. The results of a comprehensive study on the liquefaction potential of paste <b>backfill</b> are presented. The effect of variation in void ratio, confining pressure and cement content on the liquefaction resistance of <b>backfill</b> were investigated. The in situ tests were conducted on a paste <b>backfilled</b> stope at Dome Mines. A unique in situ testing program using a piezometer friction cone was carried out. This enabled the determination of the geotechnical characteristics and the evaluation of the liquefaction potential of paste <b>backfill.</b> The dynamic properties of the paste <b>backfill</b> were also investigated through a series of blasts adjacent to the <b>backfilled</b> stope. The resultant energy transfer and peak particle velocity transmitted through the rock and paste <b>backfill</b> was monitored with a series of accelerometers. The liquefaction analyses show that liquefaction resistance increases with increasing cement content and decreasing void ratio. Various curves were developed to present the influence of the above parameters for paste <b>backfill</b> application. The laboratory and in situ results obtained in this study should improve the understanding of <b>backfill</b> properties for design and operational purposes...|$|R

Greater water retention by cemented <b>backfill</b> (as compared to uncemented sandfill) reduces the surface area exposed to oxidation, which in turn reduces the amount of acid produced. The acid is neutralized by the cement and minerals contained in the <b>backfill.</b> The grain-size distribution of tailings used for <b>backfill</b> affects the structural integrity of cemented <b>backfill</b> under attack by acidic water; breakdown of the <b>backfill</b> structure releases neutralizing materials faster. <b>Backfilled</b> stopes in rock with low hydraulic conductivities will constitute preferential flow paths after mine flooding; however, the rate of flow through <b>backfill</b> will be much slower than when the stope is partially saturated during mine operation.

40|$|Returning waste {{material}} underground, as <b>backfill,</b> has been practiced {{for many years}} so as to improve the economical and environmental performance of underground mining operations. A specific type of <b>backfill,</b> {{which is used to}} fill mined areas that will not be exposed to further mining, is called hydraulic <b>backfill.</b> Cemented <b>backfill</b> has also been used to provide mechanical support for underground mining. Such <b>backfill</b> has allowed mining companies to extract more ore, while simultaneously improving working and environmental conditions. Cemented <b>backfill,</b> however, represents 50 to 85 percent of operating costs compared with the 5 to 10 percent that hydraulic <b>backfill</b> consumes. The objective of this thesis is to investigate use of sodium silicate as a partial or total replacement for cement in stabilised <b>backfill.</b> Sodium silicate is a viscous material that is usually used to activate pozzolanic materials such as slag and fly ash. The chemical compound has many applications, namely, in waste treatment, cement and other construction materials. In order to determine the influence of sodium silicate on <b>backfill</b> performance, a series of laboratory experiments were carried out on samples with different binder compositions, such as: cement; slag and cement; slag, cement and sodium silicate; and slag and sodium silicate. Additionally, the effects of mixing time and addition order on the <b>backfill</b> samples' performance were studied. The subsequent thesis focuses mainly on the strength of paste and slurry <b>backfill</b> samples containing sodium silicate in addition to the observation of a number of experimental variables, which include: pulp density (relative amount of water), curing time, and binder dosage.

The use of a part of mine waste as underground <b>backfill</b> material also helps reduce {{the environmental impact of}} mining operations. After all, <b>backfill</b> is used to provide a working platform or safer working space. Its primary and most important role is to improve the rock mass stability around mine openings. However, most available solutions to stress analyses were developed for an isolated stope, without taking into account the influence of mine depth, or of adjacent stopes. In this paper, results from a numerical study carried out to evaluate the stresses in <b>backfilled</b> stopes overlying a sill mat are presented.

The influence of stope geometry, <b>backfill,</b> sill mat and rock properties on the stresses is also evaluated.

40|$|Soil–bentonite slurry-trench cutoff walls using <b>backfill</b> {{consisting}} of on-site sandy soil and Na-bentonite are extensively used as engineering barriers {{for the purpose}} of achieving relatively low hydraulic conductivity. The amendments such as zeolite to <b>backfill</b> are considered to improve the contaminant sorptive capacity. At some sites, local clayey soil, Ca-bentonite and natural zeolite may be available for an alternate <b>backfill.</b> However, studies on the workability (in terms of slump), compressibility and hydraulic conductivity of such zeolite-amended clayey soil/Ca-bentonite <b>backfills</b> for the cutoff walls are very limited. This paper presents a comprehensive laboratory investigation on the workability, compressibility, and hydraulic conductivity of fine-grained zeolite-amended clayey soil/Ca-bentonite <b>backfills</b> using several series of slump and oedometer tests. Kaolin is used as the model clayey soil, and it is amended with various amounts of Ca-bentonite (7. 8 – 8. 4 %) and zeolite (10 – 40 %) to prepare zeolite-amended kaolin–bentonite <b>backfills.</b> The test results are compared with previous studies on zeolite-amended sandy soil/Na-bentonite <b>backfills</b> as well as compacted zeolite–bentonite liners to assess the effects of zeolite content and zeolite grain-size on the compressibility and hydraulic conductivity. The results indicate that the water content required to achieve a target slump (100 – 150 mm) for the <b>backfills</b> increases with increasing zeolite content. Liquid limit can be a useful index for a preliminary estimation of the water content required to achieve the target slump for the <b>backfills</b> presented in this study and zeolite-amended sandy soil/Na-bentonite <b>backfills</b> reported in previous studies. The results reveal that the hydraulic conductivity of the zeolite-amended clayey soil/Ca-bentonite <b>backfills</b> with void ratio ranging from 0. 54 to 1. 45 is generally lower than the typical regulatory limit (10 − 9 m/s). The addition of fine-grained zeolite has insignificant influence on the compressibility and hydraulic conductivity of both clayey soil/Ca-bentonite and sandy soil/Na-bentonite <b>backfills.</b> A proposed empirical method based on the framework of Kozeny–Carman equation can predict the hydraulic conductivity of zeolite-amended clayey soil/Ca-bentonite <b>backfills</b> values within the range of 1 / 3 to 3 times those calculated from the oedometer tests. The proposed method is also shown to estimate the hydraulic conductivity of the compacted zeolite–bentonite liners from previous studies with reasonable accuracy.
