40|$|The {{removal of}} 11 {{antibiotics}} of 6 classes, that is, two β-lactams (ampicillin and cefalexin), two sulfonamides (sulfamethoxazole and sulfadiazine), three fluoroquinolones (norfloxacin, ofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin), one tetracyclines (tetracycline), two macorlides (roxithromycin and anhydro-erythromycin), and one others (trimethoprim), in activated sludge process was investigated using two series of batch reactors treating freshwater and saline sewage respectively. At environmental relevant concentrations tested <b>in</b> this study, <b>biodegradation</b> and adsorption were the major removal routes for the target antibiotics, where volatilization and hydrolysis were neglectable. Among the 11 target antibiotics, cefalexin {{and the two}} sulfonamides were predominantly removed by <b>biodegradation</b> <b>in</b> both <b>freshwater</b> and saline sewage systems. Ampicillin, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, tetracycline, roxithromycin, and trimethoprim were mainly removed by adsorption. Divalent cations (Ca 2 + and Mg 2 +) in saline sewage significantly decreased the adsorption of the three fluoroquinolones onto activated sludge. These three fluoroquinolones also exhibited certain biodegradability in the saline activated sludge reactor. Erythromycin-H 2 O was persistent in both saline and freshwater systems under the experimental conditions {{and could not be}} removed at all. Kinetics study showed that biodegradation of cefalexin, the two sulfonamides and the three fluoroquinolones followed first-order model well (R 2 : 0. 921 - 0. 997) with the rate constants ranging from 5. 2 Å - 10 - 3 to 3. 6 Å - 10 - 1 h- 1. © 2010 American Chemical Society. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of the cyanobacterial toxin cylindrospermopsin (CYN) <b>in</b> <b>freshwater</b> reservoirs is a common phenomenon. However, the biodegradation of this toxin in environmental samples has been observed only occasionally. In this work the biodegradation ability of cylindrospermopsin was investigated based on isolates from lakes with previous cyanotoxin history. Bacterial strains were identified based on the 16 S rDNA and rpoD gene comparison. CYN biodegradation was monitored using the HPLC method. The R 6 strain identified as Aeromonas sp. was documented as being capable of CYN removal. This biodegradation was dependent on the pH and temperature. Additionally, the stimulation {{of the growth of}} the R 6 strain in the presence of CYN was indicated. Our discovery supports the hypothesis that (in analogy to the well-known phenomenon of microcystin <b>biodegradation)</b> <b>in</b> lakes dominated by potential CYN-producing cyanobacteria, the processes of microbial utilization of this toxin may occur...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT To {{compare the}} degree of {{biodegradation}} of petroleum hydrocarbons in sediments from Ikarama and Okwori in the Niger delta, Nigeria, concentrations of n-alkanes and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the sediments were measured.

While the decrease in concentrations of n-alkanes and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons confirmed the process of <b>biodegradation</b> <b>in</b> the sediments it was not solely fit to substantiate {{the degree of}} <b>biodegradation</b> <b>in</b> the sediments. Hence the percentage proportion of n-alkanes and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons was used. The degree of <b>biodegradation</b> of n-alkanes <b>in</b> both Okwori and Ikarama was almost similar.

40|$|Radiolabelled assays and compound-specific {{stable isotope}} {{analysis}} (CSIA) {{were used to}} assess methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) <b>biodegradation</b> <b>in</b> an unleaded fuel plume in a UK chalk aquifer, both in the field and in laboratory microcosm experiments. The (14) C-MTBE radiorespirometry studies demonstrated widespread potential for aerobic and anaerobic MTBE <b>biodegradation</b> <b>in</b> the aquifer. However, delta(13) C compositions of MTBE in groundwater samples from the plume showed no significant (13) C enrichment that would indicate MTBE biodegradation at the field scale. Carbon isotope enrichment during MTBE <b>biodegradation</b> was assessed <b>in</b> the microcosms when dissolved O(2) was not limiting, compared with low in situ concentrations (2 mg/L) in the aquifer, {{and in the absence of}} O(2). The microcosm experiments showed ubiquitous potential for aerobic MTBE <b>biodegradation</b> <b>in</b> the aquifer within hundreds of days. Aerobic MTBE <b>biodegradation</b> <b>in</b> the microcosms produced an enrichment of 7 parts per thousand in the MTBE delta(13) C composition and an isotope enrichment factor (epsilon) of 1. 53 parts per thousand when dissolved O(2) was not limiting. However, for the low dissolved O(2) concentration of up to 2 mg/L that characterizes most of the MTBE plume fringe, aerobic MTBE biodegradation produced an enrichment of 0. 5 - 0. 7 parts per thousand, corresponding to an epsilon value of - 0. 22 parts per thousand to - 0. 24 parts per thousand. No anaerobic MTBE biodegradation occurred under these experimental conditions. These results suggest the existence of a complex MTBE-biodegrading community in the aquifer, which may consist of different aerobic species competing for MTBE and dissolved O(2). Under low O(2) conditions, the lower fractionating species have been shown to govern overall MTBE C-isotope fractionation during biodegradation, confirming the results of previous laboratory experiments mixing pure cultures. This implies that significant aerobic MTBE biodegradation could occur under the low dissolved O(2) concentration that typifies the reactive fringe zone of MTBE plumes, without producing detectable changes in the MTBE delta(13) C composition. This observed insensitivity of C isotope enrichment to MTBE biodegradation could lead to significant underestimation of aerobic MTBE biodegradation at field scale, with an unnecessarily pessimistic performance assessment for natural attenuation. Site-specific C isotope enrichment factors are, therefore, required to reliably quantify MTBE biodegradation, which may limit CSIA as a tool for the in situ assessment of MTBE <b>biodegradation</b> <b>in</b> groundwater using only C isotopes.
