40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effect on three different training methods by combining the typical plyometric training method (drop jump) and traditional weight training (112 squat). The subjects were fifteen male high school athletes. The training duration for all subjects was eight weeks, and the frequency was twice a week. One Kistler force plate was used to record the power abilities of the subjects performing counter-movement jump (CMJ) and one PEAK camera (120 Hz) was also used to record the Axe-kicking movement time. Based on the results of this study, combining the vertical drop jump and horizontal drop jump with weight training could improve the maximum power and Axe-kick movement time. Therefore, it is important to consider the movement specific character when the muscular strength training of Taekwondo athletes. KEY WORDS: taekwondo, plyometric, drop jump, power, biomechanics.

40|$|For over a century, {{studies on}} body fat (BF) in {{decompression}} sickness and venous gas embolism of divers have been inconsistent. A major {{problem is that}} age, BF, and maximal oxygen consumption (Vo 2 max) show high multicollinearity. Using the Bühlmann model with eight parallel compartments, preceded by a blood compartment in series, nitrogen tensions and loads were calculated with a 40 min/ 3. 1 bar (absolute) profile. Compared with Haldanian models, the new model showed a substantial delay in N 2 uptake and (especially) release. One hour after surfacing, an increase of 14 - 28 % in BF resulted in a whole body increase of the N 2 load of 51 %, but in only 15 % in the blood compartment. This would result {{in an increase in}} the bubble grade of only 0. 01 Kisman-Masurel (KM) units at the scale near KM = I-. This outcome was tested indirectly by a dry dive simulation (air breathing) with 53 male divers with a small range in age and Vo 2 max to suppress multicollinearity. BF was determined with the four-skinfold method. Precordial Doppler bubble grades determined at 40, 80, 120, and 160 min after surfacing were used to calculate the Kisman Integrated Severity Score and were also transformed to the logarithm of the number of bubbles/cm(2) (logB). The highest of the four scores yielded logB = - 1. 78, equivalent to KM = I-. All statistical outcomes of partial correlations with BF were nonsignificant. These results support the model outcomes. Although this and our previous study suggest that BF does not influence venous gas embolism (Schellart NAM, van Rees Vellinga TP, van Dijk FH, Sterk W. Aviat Space Environ Med 83 : 951 - 957, 2012), more studies with different profiles under various conditions are needed to establish whether BF remains (together with age and Vo 2 max) a <b>basic</b> <b>physical</b> <b>characteristic</b> or will become less important for the medical examination and for risk assessmen...|$|R
40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this {{investigation}} {{is to determine the}} effective coherent extent of the neutron wave packet transverse to its mean propagation vector k, when it is prepared in a typical instrument used to study the structure of materials in thin film form via specular reflection. There are two principal reasons for doing so. One {{has to do with the}} fundamental physical interest in the characteristics of a free neutron as a quantum object while the other is of a more practical nature, relating to the understanding of how to interpret elastic scattering data when the neutron is employed as a probe of condensed matter structure on an atomic or nanometer scale. Knowing such a <b>basic</b> <b>physical</b> <b>characteristic</b> as the neutron's effective transverse coherence can dictate how to properly analyze specular reflectivity data obtained for material film structures possessing some amount of in-plane inhomogeneity. In this study we describe a means of measuring the effective transverse coherence length of the neutron wave packet by specular reflection from a series of diffraction gratings of different spacings. Complementary non-specular measurements of the widths of grating reflections were also performed which corroborate the specular results. (Part I principally describes measurements interpreted according to the theoretical picture presented in Part II.) Each grating was fabricated by lift-off photo-lithography patterning of a nickel film (approximately 1000 Angstroms thick) formed by physical vapor deposition on a flat silicon crystal surface. The grating periods ranged from 10 microns (5 microns Ni stripe, 5 microns intervening space) to several hundred microns. The transverse coherence length, modeled as the width of the wave packet, was determined from an analysis of the specular reflectivity curves of the set of gratings.

Image analysis is one of the promising techniques for analysis of rice kernel appearances with fast and accurate results.

The many-body physics is revealed in the atypical crossover from the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) superfluid to the Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) induced by the size quantization of the particle motion. Quantized perpendicular spectrum results in the formation of single-particle subbands (shells) so that the aggregate fermionic condensate becomes a coherent mixture of subband condensates.

For copper CMP, the common abrasives are various types of alumina and silica. It has also long been suspected that a softer organic based abrasive could significant reduce the defects during polishing. In this study, for the first time, we demonstrated the usefulness of an organic particle as abrasive in formulating copper CMP slurry. The unexpected consequence of using such soft hydrophilic particles is its low sensitivity of material removal rate for copper towards polishing down force and platen speed.

Anyway, for possible opening of a mine, first and necessary factor is determination of deposit area and defining the space distribution and concentration of mineral raw material. Intense exploitation of mineral raw materials which were base for future development of the industry, especially in 20 -th century, caused many mines to finish their life. Deposits which were easy detectible and near to the surface, for a short time were depleted. The need for metals and non-metals, and especially energetic mineral raw materials increases, so the investigation from the Earth's surface went deeper in its interior. If geological explorations were carriers of the discovery of sub - surface deposits of mineral raw materials, today there is a wide range of geophysical methods that gives possibility to expand the our knowledge deeper under the Earth's surface.
