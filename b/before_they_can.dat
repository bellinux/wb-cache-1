5|$|Fossils of organisms' {{bodies are}} usually the most {{informative}} type of evidence. The most common types are wood, bones, and shells. Fossilisation is a rare event, and most fossils are destroyed by erosion or metamorphism <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> be observed. Hence the fossil record is very incomplete, increasingly so further back in time. Despite this, it is often adequate to illustrate the broader patterns of life's history. There are also biases in the fossil record: different environments are more favorable {{to the preservation of}} different types of organism or parts of organisms. Further, only the parts of organisms that were already mineralised are usually preserved, such as the shells of molluscs. Since most animal species are soft-bodied, they decay <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> become fossilised. As a result, although there are 30-plus phyla of living animals, two-thirds have never been found as fossils.|$|E
5|$|The effect {{explains}} supersaturation of vapors. In {{the absence}} of nucleation sites, tiny droplets must form <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> evolve into larger droplets. This requires a vapor pressure many times the vapor pressure at the phase transition point.|$|E
5|$|Arkham Knight {{introduces}} enemy medics who can shield {{enemies in}} electrified fields and revive unconscious ones, sword-wielding enemies, and brutes who {{are resistant to}} damage and must be stunned <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> be attacked; brutes wielding Gatling guns, tasers, and blades require additional steps to defeat. Enemies are capable of employing tactics to counter Batman's various skills, including deploying landmines, controlling hovering drones, disabling vents if Batman is found using them, and detecting his location if Batman uses Detective Vision for too long.|$|E

5|$|As players {{walk through}} the level, they are stopped by groups of enemies who must be {{defeated}} <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> continue. The level ends when all the enemies are defeated. Each level contains many identical groups of enemies, making these games notable for their repetition. In beat 'em up games, players often fight a boss—an enemy much stronger than the other enemies—at {{the end of each}} level.|$|E
5|$|BART hosts {{car sharing}} {{locations}} at many stations, a program pioneered by City CarShare. Riders can transfer from BART and complete their journeys by car. BART offers long-term airport parking through a third-party vendor at most East Bay stations. Travelers must make an on-line reservation {{in advance and}} pay the daily fee of $5 <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> leave their cars at the BART parking lot.|$|E
5|$|Catherine (Megan Gallagher), {{a social}} worker, is Frank's wife. She moves to Seattle {{with her husband}} when he retires, unaware that their {{relocation}} was motivated by a stalker who was hounding the family. The stalker catches up with the family, kidnapping Catherine. Black rescues her, killing her captor. Repulsed by her husband's rage and disturbed by the incident, she separates amicably from Frank with their daughter Jordan. <b>Before</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> reconcile Catherine dies in a viral outbreak launched by the Group, sacrificing herself to ensure Jordan's safety.|$|E

50|$|Timing is important, however. Weed seeds must be tilled/howed or {{otherwise}} destroyed <b>before</b> <b>they</b> themselves <b>can</b> create new seeds. By destroying them early, the farmer eliminates {{most of that}} season's annual weeds. Turning the dead weeds back into the soil also increases soil nutrient content, although this difference is slight.|$|R
40|$|Preparing {{students}} for language and cultural exchanges abroad can be difficult; all too often, little preparation {{is done for}} Japanese students <b>before</b> <b>they</b> go. This paper will discuss how students at Kyushu Institute of Technology (KIT) are prepared for language study at an American university. In short, KIT has found that preparing students <b>before</b> <b>they</b> go <b>can</b> {{be as important as}} the trip itself...|$|R
5|$|Enzymes must bind their {{substrates}} <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> catalyse any chemical reaction. Enzymes {{are usually}} very specific {{as to what}} substrates they bind and then the chemical reaction catalysed. Specificity is achieved by binding pockets with complementary shape, charge and hydrophilic/hydrophobic characteristics to the substrates. Enzymes can therefore distinguish between very similar substrate molecules to be chemoselective, regioselective and stereospecific.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to visual warnings, ambulances can be fitted with audible warnings, sometimes known as sirens, which can alert people and vehicles {{to the presence}} of an ambulance <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> be seen. The first audible warnings were mechanical bells, mounted to either the front or roof of the ambulance. Most modern ambulances are now fitted with electronic sirens, producing a range of different noises which ambulance operators can use to attract more attention to themselves, particularly when proceeding through an intersection or in heavy traffic.|$|E
5|$|James Hurley (James Marshall) and Donna Hayward (Lara Flynn Boyle) {{sneak into}} the office of {{psychiatrist}} Laurence Jacoby (Russ Tamblyn), hoping {{to find out more}} about Laura, whom he had been treating. They find a cassette tape she sent him. Meanwhile, Jacoby is distracted by an offer to meet Laura's cousin, Madeline Ferguson (Lee), who has disguised herself as the dead girl; <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> meet, however, he is attacked by a masked man and left unconscious.|$|E

Certainly, I do not {{remember}} a white man being killed, after they did so. I will ask others who were there, and tomorrow will tell you what they say." ...|$|R
5000|$|Cavity {{retains the}} single bat and ball of Breakout, but two other balls are {{enclosed}} {{on the other}} side of the wall, which the player must free <b>before</b> <b>they,</b> too, <b>can</b> be used to destroy additional bricks. Points are increased for this, but triple points are available if the player can keep all three balls in play.|$|R
50|$|If {{the bill}} was not {{returned}} to the Majlis by the president or even if {{the president did not}} ratify the bill within the thirty-day period, the bill is deemed to become law. If the bill is sent back to the Majlis, the members can decide to pass the bill as it was <b>before</b> or <b>they</b> <b>can</b> consider the presidents observations.|$|R
5|$|Macromolecules such as starch, {{cellulose}} or proteins {{cannot be}} rapidly {{taken up by}} cells and must be broken into their smaller units <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> be used in cell metabolism. Several common classes of enzymes digest these polymers. These digestive enzymes include proteases that digest proteins into amino acids, as well as glycoside hydrolases that digest polysaccharides into simple sugars known as monosaccharides.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Sokka, Toph, and Suki hijack a Fire Nation airship, {{and use it}} {{to destroy}} Ozai's airship fleet, {{crippling}} his forces <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> burn down the Erath Kingdom. In Ba Sing Se, the Order of the White Lotus, led by Iroh, lays siege to the Fire Nation forces within the city, with the intention of re-conquering it {{in the name of the}} Earth Kingdom. Aang reappears and begins to duel the Phoenix King. When Aang refuses to kill Ozai despite given the opportunity, Ozai begins to gain an advantage in the fight.|$|E
5|$|Microbial mats {{are areas}} of {{sediment}} stabilised {{by the presence}} of colonies of microbes that secrete sticky fluids or otherwise bind the sediment particles. They appear to migrate upwards when covered by a thin layer of sediment but this is an illusion caused by the colony's growth; individuals do not, themselves, move. If too thick a layer of sediment is deposited <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> grow or reproduce through it, parts of the colony will die leaving behind fossils with a characteristically wrinkled ("elephant skin") and tubercular texture.|$|E
50|$|Remove {{the leaves}} before serving. The skin can be eaten (especially when the fruit is ripe and the tannins are almost {{completely}} decomposed), but many remove the skin <b>before</b> eating. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> also be dried (after skinning and rinsing with Shōchū or after leaving 24 hours in hot spring water). Two fruits are attached by a string {{which is then}} hung over a pole.|$|R
5000|$|MS {{cases are}} rare <b>before</b> puberty, but <b>they</b> <b>can</b> happen. Whether <b>they</b> {{constitute}} a separate disease {{is still an}} open subject. Anyway, even this pubertal MS could {{be more than one}} disease, because early-onset and late-onset have different demyelination patterns ...|$|R

5|$|Milo and Tock {{leave the}} dungeon. King Azaz hosts {{them at a}} banquet where the guests {{literally}} eat their words, served to them on plates. After the meal, King Azaz lets Milo and Tock talk themselves into a dangerous quest to rescue the princesses. Azaz flatters the Humbug into being their guide, and boy, dog and insect set off for the Mathemagician's capital of Digitopolis as they must gain his approval <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> begin their quest.|$|E
5|$|Now an outlaw, McTeague {{returns to}} Placer County and teams {{up with a}} {{prospector}} named Cribbens. Headed towards Death Valley, they find a large quantity of quartz and plan to become millionaires. <b>Before</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> begin mining, McTeague senses danger and flees into Death Valley with a single horse, the remaining money and one water jug. Several marshals pursue him, joined by Schouler. Schouler wants to catch McTeague personally and rides into Death Valley alone.|$|E
5|$|She finally narrates {{the story}} of her {{abandonment}} to Jug, who tells her that she fears abandonment so much that she does not allow herself to commit in relationships, leaving <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> leave her. He convinces her that she does not need to forgive her parents for abandoning her, but she can, as an adult, see them as two regular people who made a mistake. After this, Kaira makes an effort to reconcile with her parents and also works to finish her short film.|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} a dynamical membrane world in empty Anti de Sitter space-time {{and look for}} shortcuts followed by gravitons leaving and subsequently returning to the brane. In the comparison with photons following a geodesic inside the brane, we verify that shortcuts exist, though they are extremely small for the Universe today. However, we argue that at times just <b>before</b> nucleossinthesis <b>they</b> <b>can</b> provide an alternative to inflation as concerning the horizon problem. ...|$|R
5000|$|Buell Motorcycle Company {{introduced}} a rim-mounted [...] "zero torsional load" [...] disc brake that was claimed to reduce unsprung {{weight in the}} wheel-brake system, including lighter wheel spokes that carried no braking load. This style is generically termed a [...] "perimeter brake" [...] for its point of attachment to the wheel, and {{had been used in}} smaller numbers by other manufacturers <b>before</b> Buell. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> rarely be found on custom motorcycle spoked wheels.|$|R
5000|$|In June 2016, the Lion Guard posted several notices about a Trump {{rally in}} Manchester, New Hampshire, urging members to attend. In {{response}} to {{criticism that the}} group was urging conflict and promoting violence, the Lion Guard stated on its website, [...] "We do not endorse instigating fights or brawling with anti-Trump marauders. The Lion Guard seeks to identify and expose plots to attack Mr. Trump, Trump Supporters, and their rallies <b>before</b> <b>they</b> even <b>can</b> happen." ...|$|R
5|$|THSRC has 144 drivers (July 2012), {{of which}} almost 10% are female. All driver {{candidates}} must spend 8 months completing 1,326 hours of professional training {{and pass the}} National Certification <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> drive the train. In addition, after becoming a certified high-speed train driver, they undergo further on-the-job training {{at least three times}} each year in order to guarantee they can drive the train safely.|$|E
5|$|The second {{operation}} {{takes them}} to Russia in order to rescue one of their allies, a Russian informant named Nikolai working within the Ultranationalist party. Assisted by Russian Loyalist forces, Price's team succeeds in rescuing Nikolai. However, their helicopter is later brought down, forcing the group {{to make their way}} through enemy territory with support from an AC-130 gunship <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> be extracted. Intelligence gathered from these two missions indicates that Al-Asad may be in possession of a Russian nuclear device.|$|E
5|$|A {{procedure}} {{for dealing with}} omitted decompression stops is described in the US Navy Diving Manual. In principle the procedure allows a diver who is not yet presenting symptoms of decompression sickness, to go back down and complete the omitted decompression, with some extra added {{to deal with the}} bubbles which are assumed to have formed during the period where the decompression ceiling was violated. Divers who become symptomatic <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> be returned to depth are treated for decompression sickness, and do not attempt the omitted decompression procedure as the risk is considered unacceptable under normal operational circumstances.|$|E

50|$|Vietnam offers overstaying {{visas to}} foreigners {{who entered the}} country on a tourist visa. They are {{required}} to pay a fine <b>before</b> <b>they</b> then <b>can</b> request a visa extension. They are required to contact their local Immigration Office and pay for overstaying Vietnam Visa. There {{are two types of}} financial prerequisites for overstaying in Vietnam: a fine fee, and an extension fee, but in case the extension request is declined, the foreigner has to pay an exit visa fee and will be forced to leave the country. If foreigners have overstayed for a maximum of 2 days, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> pay their fine for overstaying at the airport.|$|R
50|$|The basic {{composition}} of a sausage roll is sheets of puff pastry formed into tubes around sausage meat and glazed with egg or milk <b>before</b> being baked. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> be served either hot or cold.
