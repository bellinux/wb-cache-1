2500|$|Often <b>business</b> <b>transfers</b> {{take place}} {{when a company}} has plunged into an {{insolvency}} procedure. If a company enters liquidation, which aims to wind down the business and sell off the assets, TUPER 2006 regulation 8(7) states that the rules on transfer will not apply. The main objective, however, in an insolvency procedure particularly since the Cork Report and the Enterprise Act 2002, is to effect rescues through the system of company administration. An administrator's task under the Insolvency Act 1986 Schedule B1, paragraph 3, is either to rescue the company as a going concern, rescue the business typically by finding a suitable buyer and thus save jobs, or {{as a last resort}} put the company into liquidation. If employees are kept on after an administrator is appointed for more than 14 days, under paragraph 99 the administrator becomes responsible for adopting their contracts. The liability on contracts is limited to [...] "wages and salaries". This includes pay, holiday pay, sick pay and occupational pension contributions, but has been held to not include compensation for unfair dismissal cases, wrongful dismissal, or protective awards for failure to consult the workforce before redundancies. If the business rescue does ultimately fail, then such money due employees achieves the status of [...] "super priority" [...] among different creditors' claims.|$|E

40|$|<b>Business</b> <b>transfer</b> is an {{important}} issue that the European Commission has been actualising since the early 1990 s, when the first recommendations for the improvement of national <b>business</b> <b>transfer</b> ecosystems of the EU countries were created. Neglecting <b>business</b> <b>transfer</b> as a critical phase {{in the development of a}} company can have significant negative implications for companies, their owners and wide network of stakeholders. <b>Business</b> <b>transfer</b> is a particularly important topic for the Croatian economy where more than 5, 300 businesses with around 57, 000 employees represent a risk group whose owners underestimate the complexity and longevity of the <b>business</b> <b>transfer</b> process. The aim of this paper is to analyse the structure and quality of the <b>business</b> <b>transfer</b> ecosystem in Croatia. For this purpose, secondary research and a qualitative study in the form of interviews with representatives of key stakeholders were conducted. The Croatian <b>business</b> <b>transfer</b> ecosystem is benchmarked to the national <b>business</b> <b>transfer</b> ecosystems of Spain, Finland, Sweden and France, based on the data collected through the EU project BTAR. The research results indicate low level of development, interconnection and complementarity of individual components of the <b>business</b> <b>transfer</b> ecosystem in Croatia. Policy recommendations for improving the quality of the <b>business</b> <b>transfer</b> ecosystem in Croatia were identified...|$|R
