40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the application of}} the double-entry bookkeeping method, taught to students at the Aula do Comércio (School of Commerce), established in Lisbon in 1759. The aim in this research is to identify the differ¬ences and similarities between accounting practiced today and double-entry bookkeeping taught at the School of Commerce in 1765. The main <b>bibliographic</b> <b>base</b> used is the manuscript dictated through the first lens (teacher) of the School, João Henrique de Souza. The historical documentary research method was applied. The main doc¬umentary source, the abovementioned manuscript, is primary. The theme is important as it addresses the begin¬nings of Portuguese-Brazilian accounting education. It should be highlighted that the bookkeeping method at that time – double-entry – contains both differences and similarities with the procedures adopted today to recognize similar operations. Analyzing the text and presenting different examples transcribed from the manuscript, the pa¬per addresses the bookkeeping of the registers used at that time (daybook, journal and ledger), the accounts used in trade and industrial activities and the method to verify the balance of the transactions that took place in that pe¬riod. Finally, it is observed that many of the forms and concepts to do bookkeeping are similar to current practices...|$|E

40|$|The International Aquatic Resources Management (ICLARM) is an international, nonprofit {{organization}} which conducts interdisciplinary {{research on the}} management of living aquatic organisms and coastal resources in tropical developing countries. It is an independent body, {{set up in the}} Philippines in 1977. Its main reason for existence is to provide the technical information required to develop and properly utilize the aquatic resources of tropical developing countries to supply their food and economic needs. It is engaged in essential long-term research to help address these needs. ICLARM's information activities have two thrusts, the research mentioned above, and services. These have common aims: to improve information availability and access, and to improve {{the quality and quantity of}} information. The principal ways of doing this have been to increase the scope and size of the Information Department of Naga, the free ICLARM quarterly; to distribute, free, copies of their technical publications; to promote the use of secondary literature, for example abstract journals, and information services. One of these is the Selective Fisheries Information Service, funded by the International Development Research Center (IRDC) of Canada. This facility prepares mini-reviews that describe the development and directions of the literature on any given subject, and refer the reader to important papers and contacts. Some of these reviews are published in Naga. The other major service is ICLARM's publishing activity. From sales, library exchange and free issue, the total number of books in the technical series (now numbering seven) distributed since the first publication in 1980 is more than 80, 000. Recent publications in the technical series include: the proceedings of the Second International Symposium on Tilapia in Aquaculture, Tilapia Genetic Resources in Aquaculture, Research and Education for the Development of Integrated Crop-Livestock Fish Farming Systems in the Tropics, and Bivalve MolluscCulture Research in Thailand. ICLARM's library provides the <b>bibliographic</b> <b>base</b> for SFIS, for ICLARM staff activities and for many external visitors, who conduct their own searches on the CD-ROM version of FAO's Aquatic Sciences and Fisheries Abstracts. By the end of 1988 the ICLARM library collection held 8890 books and monographs, 660 serial titles, 3770 reprints, 127 microfiche titles, and two microfilms.
