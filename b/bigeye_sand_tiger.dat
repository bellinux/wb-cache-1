5|$|Though {{extremely}} rare, the <b>bigeye</b> <b>sand</b> <b>tiger</b> {{has been}} reported from scattered locations around the world, suggesting a wide and possibly disjunct global distribution in tropical and warm-temperate oceanic waters. Most known specimens {{have come from the}} Atlantic, where it has been found off Madeira, southern Brazil, Texas, eastern Florida, and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The only evidence for its presence in the Indian Ocean is a set of jaws that may have originated from the Seychelles, though the South China Sea is another possibility. The existence of this species in the Pacific Ocean was first suspected in 1970 from teeth recovered from bottom sediments, which was confirmed over a decade later by captures from the Marshall Islands and Hawaii.|$|E
5|$|Whether the <b>bigeye</b> and {{smalltooth}} <b>sand</b> <b>tigers</b> {{belong in}} the same family as the superficially similar <b>sand</b> <b>tiger</b> shark (C. taurus) has been debated among systematists, with morphological and dentitional studies giving inconsistent results. A 2012 molecular phylogenetic analysis, based on mitochondrial DNA, supported a sister species relationship between O. noronhai and O. ferox but not a clade consisting of Odontaspis and Carcharias. Instead, Odontaspis was found to be closer to the crocodile shark (Pseudocarcharias kamoharai), suggesting that it and Carcharias should be placed in separate families.|$|R
2500|$|The {{majority}} of prey items of <b>sand</b> <b>tigers</b> are demersal (i.e. {{from the sea}} bottom), suggesting that they hunt extensively on the sea bottom as far out as the continental shelf. Bony fish (Teleosts) form about 60% of <b>sand</b> <b>tigers</b> food, the remaining prey comprising sharks and skates. In Argentina, the prey includes mostly demersal fishes, e.g. the striped weakfish (Cynoscion guatucupa). The most important elasmobranch prey is the bottom-living smooth-hound shark (Mustelus sp.). Benthic (i.e. free-swimming) rays and skates are also taken. Stomach content analysis indicates that smaller <b>sand</b> <b>tigers</b> mainly focus on the sea bottom and as they grow larger they start to take more benthic prey. This perspective of the diet of <b>sand</b> <b>tigers</b> is consistent with similar observations in the north west Atlantic and in South Africa where large <b>sand</b> <b>tigers</b> capture {{a wider range of}} shark and skate species as prey, from the surf zone to the continental shelf, indicating the opportunistic nature of <b>sand</b> <b>tiger</b> feeding. Off South Africa, <b>sand</b> <b>tigers</b> less than [...] in length prey on fish about a quarter of their own length; however, large <b>sand</b> <b>tigers</b> capture prey up to about half of their own length. The prey items are usually swallowed as three or four chunks.|$|R
40|$|Prior to {{a recent}} harvest moratorium, <b>sand</b> <b>tiger</b> sharks (Carcharias taurus) were the focus of both {{directed}} and non-directed fisheries in the northwest Atlantic. <b>Sand</b> <b>tigers</b> occupy a high public profile due to their size and relative ease of public display. In contrast with many other large coastal sharks, limited information {{is available on the}} coastal movements of <b>sand</b> <b>tigers</b> including locations of overwintering areas. In 2008 we outfitted 13 <b>sand</b> <b>tigers</b> (1. 4 - 3. 3 m FL) with acoustic (VEMCO Ltd. V- 16 - 6 H) and satellite (Microwave Telemetry Inc.) transmitters in Delaware Bay. Twelve of the thirteen acoustic transmitters were detected a total of 8, 030 times prior to departing Delaware waters in September and October. Similarly, twelve of the satellite transmitters were detected within scheduled pop-off times (4 - 6 months post-deployment). Most <b>sand</b> <b>tigers</b> made relatively direct movements to overwintering areas in the Hatteras Bight Region, arriving within weeks of departing Delaware waters. An additional male <b>sand</b> <b>tiger</b> (1. 09 m FL) outfitted with an acoustic transmitter was detected off Cape Canaveral, FL in January-February, 2009 after departing Delaware Bay in September. Female <b>sand</b> <b>tigers</b> occupied significantly (p 3 ̆c. 0001) warmer waters compared to males although occupied depths did not vary significantly (p=. 1054). Although perceived as a relatively sluggish species, telemetered <b>sand</b> <b>tigers</b> were documented making rapid movements in the water column from surface waters to depths of 188 m. Our results underscore the need for coast-wide approaches to recover <b>sand</b> <b>tigers</b> as this charismatic shark is particularly vulnerable to anthropogenic impacts...|$|R
5|$|With its heavyset body, conical bulbous snout, {{and large}} mouth filled with {{protruding}} teeth, the <b>bigeye</b> <b>sand</b> <b>tiger</b> looks {{much like the}} better-known sand tiger shark. The large eyes lack nictitating membranes, and behind them are small spiracles. The corner of the mouth extends to behind {{the level of the}} eyes, and the jaws are highly protrusible. There are 34–43 upper and 37–46 lower tooth rows; these include zero to two rows of small teeth at the upper symphysis (jaw midpoint) and two to four more rows at the lower symphysis. In each half of the upper jaw, the teeth in the first and second rows are large, those in the third and sometimes fourth rows are small, and those in the rows after are large again. Each tooth has a narrow, awl-like central cusp flanked by one smaller cusplet on each side; this contrasts with the smalltooth sand tiger, which has two or three lateral cusplets on each side. There are five pairs of gill slits.|$|E
500|$|The <b>bigeye</b> <b>sand</b> <b>tiger</b> (Odontaspis noronhai) is an {{extremely}} rare species of mackerel shark in the family Odontaspididae, with a possible worldwide distribution. A large, bulky species reaching at least [...] in length, the <b>bigeye</b> <b>sand</b> <b>tiger</b> has a long bulbous snout, large orange eyes without nictitating membranes, and a capacious mouth with the narrow teeth prominently exposed. It can be distinguished from the similar smalltooth sand tiger (O. ferox) by its teeth, which have only one lateral cusplet on each side, and by its uniformly dark brown color.|$|E
500|$|One {{account of}} a <b>bigeye</b> <b>sand</b> <b>tiger</b> that had been caught alive noted that it behaved very aggressively, {{thrashing}} and snapping violently {{in and out of}} the water.

Its reproduction is little-known but probably similar to that of other mackerel sharks, which are viviparous with embryos that feed on unfertilized eggs during gestation (oophagy). Adult females have a single functional ovary, on the right, and two functional uteruses. Males mature sexually at somewhere between [...] long, while females mature at around [...] long.

5|$|Since Carcharocles {{is derived}} from Otodus, and the two had teeth that bear a close {{similarity}} {{to those of the}} <b>sand</b> <b>tiger</b> shark (Carcharias taurus), megalodon may have had a build more similar to the <b>sand</b> <b>tiger</b> shark than to other sharks. However, this is unlikely since <b>sand</b> <b>tiger</b> sharks are axial swimmers that flex their body for propulsion, meaning that they are adapted for acceleration rather than for maintaining high cruising speeds. A large <b>sand</b> <b>tiger</b> shark would require large fins to propel itself, however this in itself would create more drag and offset efficiency, so it is unlikely that they had similar body shapes given how large megalodon was.|$|R
2500|$|Because the <b>sand</b> <b>tiger</b> shark is {{worldwide}} in distribution, it has many common names. The term [...] "sand tiger shark" [...] actually refers to four different <b>sand</b> <b>tiger</b> shark {{species in the}} family Odontaspididae. Furthermore, the name creates confusion with the tiger shark Galeocerdo cuvier, which {{is not related to}} the <b>sand</b> <b>tiger.</b> The grey nurse shark, the name used in Australia and the United Kingdom, is the second-most-used name for the shark, and in India it is known as blue-nurse <b>sand</b> <b>tiger.</b> However, there are unrelated nurse sharks in the family Ginglymostomatidae. The most unambiguous and descriptive English name is probably the South African one, spotted ragged-tooth shark.|$|R

25|$|The <b>sand</b> <b>tiger</b> {{is often}} {{associated}} with being vicious or deadly, due to its relatively large size and sharp, protruding teeth that point outward from its jaws; however, these sharks are quite docile, and are not a threat to humans. Their mouths are not large enough to cause a human fatality. <b>Sand</b> <b>tigers</b> roam the surf, sometimes in close proximity to humans, and there have been only a few instances of unprovoked <b>sand</b> <b>tiger</b> shark attacks on humans, usually associated with spear fishing, line fishing, or shark feeding. As of 2013, the database of Shark Attack Survivors does not list any fatalities due to <b>sand</b> <b>tiger</b> sharks. When the sharks become aggressive, they tend to steal fish or bait from fishing lines rather than attack humans.

40|$|This thesis reviews {{reproductive}} behavior in <b>sand</b> <b>tiger</b> sharks (Carcharias taurus). <b>Sand</b> <b>tigers</b> occur in temperate coastal waters worldwide {{except for the}} central and eastern Pacific Ocean. The species exists as isolated populations with little mixing, and its population status varies from vulnerable to critically endangered, depending upon location. <b>Sand</b> <b>tigers</b> employ a unique method of embryonic development known as adelphophagy and oophagy in which the first pup to hatch inside each uterus consumes the remaining developing embryos and unfertilized egg capsules. <b>Sand</b> <b>tigers</b> migrate seasonally, with migration coupled to their reproductive cycle, and closely tied to {{reproductive behavior}}. Reproductive behavior {{is defined as a}} suite of behaviors associated with reproduction involving either or both sexes. For this review, behaviors are divided into three sub-categories: pre-copulatory, copulatory, and post-copulatory. The National Aquarium in Baltimore, Maryland has been displaying <b>sand</b> <b>tigers</b> since the early 1980 ’s and has conducted multiple observations on reproductive behaviors, first from 1998 - 2003, and most recently from 2007 - 2012. Reproductive behaviors observed at the National Aquarium in Baltimore corroborate many of those seen at other institutions and also represent novel behaviors that were previously un-documented. Because of the vulnerability of <b>sand</b> <b>tiger</b> populations in the wild, understanding of their reproductive behaviors and specific requirements for promoting successful reproduction in captive animals has great potential for contributing towards enhanced recovery of <b>sand</b> <b>tiger</b> populations...|$|R
40|$|Oliver, Matthew J. Quantifying the {{biogeography}} {{of coastal}} marine species {{is difficult and}} requires innovative study designs. These challenges are the motivation behind this dissertation. The <b>Sand</b> <b>Tiger</b> shark (Carcharias taurus) is an important apex predator in the coastal oceans along the Eastern Coast of the United States. I conducted {{a study in the}} Delaware Bay and Mid-Atlantic coastal Ocean, which used historical species location records from acoustic telemetry matched to static and satellite-measured dynamic environmental predictor variables, to create a near-real time predictive species distribution model. Notably we found <b>Sand</b> <b>Tigers</b> were predicted by water temperature, water depth, day length and ocean color absorption in the near-infrared, which likely relates to turbidity in the coastal ocean. In this study I identified the timing and location of migratory corridors used by <b>Sand</b> <b>Tigers,</b> as well as how the timing and location of migration differed between juvenile, mature male and mature female <b>Sand</b> <b>Tigers.</b> ☐ In my second study, I investigated the timing and migration of <b>Sand</b> <b>Tigers</b> along the Delmarva Peninsula on much smaller spatiotemporal scales during their fall migration south, a time during which <b>Sand</b> <b>Tigers</b> are susceptible to anthropogenic threats. For the first time, I used an autonomous underwater vehicle to concurrently detect <b>Sand</b> <b>Tigers</b> carrying acoustic tags, and measure fine scale environmental properties of the sub-surface ocean to determine habitat selectivity. I found that <b>Sand</b> <b>Tigers</b> migrated rapidly and en masse through the coastal ocean off the Delmarva Peninsula and were selecting for waters near-shore, lower in salinity, and higher in color dissolved organic matter. These results support the larger scale patterns in environmental predictors I found in my first study, as well as prove that using autonomous underwater vehicles is an effective method for extending our capabilities of detecting acoustically tagged marine species. ☐ Finally, I developed a novel tagging method that implanted an archival acoustic receiver into the body cavity of <b>Sand</b> <b>Tigers,</b> which were released alive and continued to conduct their annual migration before they were recaptured and the tags were removed. This tagging method allowed me to record associations between <b>Sand</b> <b>Tigers</b> and other acoustically tagged species for one year of the <b>Sand</b> <b>Tigers</b> life. Analysis of that dataset revealed potential fission-fusion behavior, or the change in size and composition of groups, in the <b>Sand</b> <b>Tiger</b> population depending on where the <b>Sand</b> <b>Tigers</b> were along the East Coast, and what they were likely doing during that time (i. e. feeding, searching for mates, migrating, etc.). I observed <b>Sand</b> <b>Tiger</b> aggregations change from mixed groups of male and female juveniles and adults, to groups of only adult males, to solitary phases where <b>Sand</b> <b>Tigers</b> were completely dispersed for weeks at a time. This study is important because it suggests the potential for social behavior in a shark species, but also identifies the possibility of anthropogenic impacts disproportionally impacting one sector of the <b>Sand</b> <b>Tiger</b> population as the composition of their aggregations changes in time and space. This dissertation uses advances in remote sensing and animal tagging methods to provide insights into the species distribution, habitat selection, and the migratory and grouping behavior of a coastal shark species under threat of population decline due to anthropogenic impacts along the East Coast of the United States and provides insights into the ecology and biogeography of this species that will assist managers and researchers in future conservation efforts for this and other imperiled species.

Globally, {{population}} declines for the <b>sand</b> <b>tiger</b> shark (Carcharias taurus) {{have resulted}} in calls for informed management of populations, including in the western North Atlantic, {{where they have been}} listed as a Species of Concern by NOAA Fisheries. However, information on movements and habitat use, critical for informed management of this <b>sand</b> <b>tiger</b> population, is limited. We investigated horizontal and vertical movements of <b>sand</b> <b>tigers</b> along theUS east coast using pop-up archival satellite transmitters, supplemented by acoustic telemetry. Thirteen <b>sand</b> <b>tiger</b> sharks were tagged with satellite and acoustic transmitters inDelawareBay in lateAugust and early September 2008.
