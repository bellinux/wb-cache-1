The hybridization of <b>bound</b> <b>edge</b> states results in spin currents and 4 π-periodic torques, {{as a function of the}} relative magnetic field angle – an effect which is dual to the fractional Josephson effect. We establish relation between torques and spin-currents in the non-topological region where the magnetic field is almost zero and spin is conserved along the spin–orbit field direction.

40|$|Contrary to the {{widespread}} belief that Majorana zero-energy modes, existing as <b>bound</b> <b>edge</b> states in 2 D topological insulator (TI) -superconductor (SC) hybrid structures, are unaffected by non-magnetic static disorder {{by virtue of}} Anderson's theorem, we show that such a protection against disorder {{does not exist in}} realistic multi-channel TI/SC/ferromagnetic insulator (FI) sandwich structures of experimental relevance since the time-reversal symmetry is explicitly broken locally at the SC/FI interface where the end Majorana mode (MM) resides. We find that although the MM itself and the bulk topological superconducting phase inside the TI are indeed universally protected against disorder, disorder-induced subgap states are generically introduced at the TI edge due to the presence of the FI/SC interface as long as multiple edge channels are occupied. We discuss the implications of the finding for the detection and manipulation of the edge MM in realistic TI/SC/FI experimental systems of current interest. Comment: 6 pages, 4 figure...|$|E

40|$|We explore {{possible}} signatures for observing Majorana Fermions in the tunneling spectroscopy of high-Tc cuprate superconductors. We {{find that}} as long as the Rashba spin orbit interaction is in presence either through proximity effect due to an electrode made by heavy metal or by the intrinsic nature of cuprates, in addition to the Heisenberg spin exchange interaction, the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya and spin dipole-dipole interactions are induced. As a result, p-wave superconductivity is induced with the gap function d-vector being not aligned with the internal magnetic field of the spin-orbit interaction. Most importantly, the ground state goes through transitions into gapless phases with split nodal points. The split nodal structure always results in Majorana modes for any interfaces that are not exactly in (100) or (010) directions. Hence for general interfaces, existence of Majorana <b>bound</b> <b>edge</b> states is a robust feature. Our results indicate that these Majorana modes would result in a small plateau in tunneling spectrum near zero bias peak and in 4 π periodicity in typical SIS' junctions. As a result, it is easy for a π-ring in tricrystal experiments to hold Majorana Ferimions and exhibit periods of two flux quanta in external magnetic fields. These phenomena may have been already observed in experiments and their connections to experimental results are discussed. Comment: 15 pages, 16 figures, to appear in Phys. Rev. ...|$|E

40|$|Shape-From-Silhouette (SFS) is a shape {{reconstruction}} method which constructs a 3 D shape {{estimate of}} an object using silhouette images of the object. The output of a SFS algorithm {{is known as the}} Visual Hull (VH). Traditionally SFS is either performed on static objects, or separately at each time instant in the case of videos of moving objects. In this paper we develop a theory of performing SFS across time: estimating the shape of a dynamic object (with unknown motion) by combining all of the silhouette images of the object over time. We first introduce a one dimensional element called a <b>Bounding</b> <b>Edge</b> to represent the Visual Hull. We then show that aligning two Visual Hulls using just their silhouettes is in general ambiguous and derive the geometric constraints (in terms of <b>Bounding</b> <b>Edges)</b> that govern the alignment. To break the alignment ambiguity, we combine stereo information with silhouette information and derive a Temporal SFS algorithm which consists of two steps: (1) estimate the motion of the objects over time (Visual Hull Alignment) and (2) combine the silhouette information using the estimated motion (Visual Hull Refinement). The algorithm is first developed for rigid objects and then extended to articulated objects. In the Part II of this paper we apply our temporal SFS algorithm to two human-related applications: (1) the acquisition of detailed human kinematic models and (2) marker-less motion tracking...|$|R
