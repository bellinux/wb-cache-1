25|$|PA435 {{begins at}} an {{interchange}} with I-380's Exit13 at the northwestern corner of Gouldsboro State Park in Coolbaugh Township, Monroe County, heading northeast as a two-lane undivided road. Immediately after beginning, the route reaches a junction with the southern terminus of PA507 and turns northwest onto a four-lane divided highway. PA435 heads northwestward out of Monroe County and {{passes through a}} corner of Lehigh Township in Wayne County before entering Lackawanna County at the crossing of the Lehigh River, becoming a four-lane undivided road. The roadway parallels a distance from I-380 through the rural stretches of Clifton Township. The highway continues north through Clifton, passing west of <b>Big</b> <b>Bass</b> Lake and soon the Covington Industrial Park. PA435 continues a close parallel with the interstate as it passes east of Covington Lake and enters Covington Township. Just north of the township line, PA435 forks to the northeast at a junction with PA307 (the Scranton-Pocono Highway).|$|E

500|$|Originally, [...] "Twin Soliloquies" [...] {{came to an}} end {{shortly after}} the vocal part finishes. [...] Logan found this unsatisfying and worked with Trude Rittmann to find a better ending to the song. [...] This piece of music, dubbed [...] "Unspoken Thoughts", {{continues}} the music as Nellie and Emile sip brandy together, and is called by Lovensheimer [...] "the one truly operatic moment of the score". [...] "This Nearly Was Mine" [...] is a <b>big</b> <b>bass</b> solo for Emile in waltz time, deemed by Rodgers biographer William G. Hyland as [...] "one of his finest efforts". Only five notes are used in the first four bars, a phrase which is then repeated with a slight variation in the following four bars. [...] The song ends an octave higher than where it began, making it perfect for Pinza's voice.|$|E

5000|$|The Gibson EB-2 was an {{electric}} bass guitar model {{produced by the}} Gibson Guitar Corporation from 1958 to 1972, with a hiatus from 1962 to 1963. When production ceased in 1972, a total of 8017 instruments has been built, with 2102 of them being EB-2D's. Willie Moseley, in Vintage Guitar, referred to the bass guitar as possibly [...] "Gibson's <b>biggest</b> <b>bass</b> invention"; the instrument, however, was not a great commercial success, and the Rivoli, the sister model made by Epiphone, {{may have been used}} more than the original Gibson.|$|R

6000|$|From weeping {{he went to}} whining, {{and from}} whining to wailing, until at last he {{achieved}} a scream. This alarmed us, but the more we tried to make him cease, the louder he screamed. And then, from not far away in the forest, came a [...] "Goek! Goek!" [...] to our ears. To this there were answering cries, several of them, and from very far off we could hear a <b>big,</b> <b>bass</b> [...] "Goek! Goek! Goek!" [...] Also, the [...] "Whoo-whoo!"

60|$|The whole crew {{seems to}} compose the band, and, {{like a lot}} of monkey-folk rejoicing in rude rhythm, {{emphasizes}} the beat by hammering kerosene cans, frying-pans, and all sorts of things metallic or reverberant. Some genius has rigged a line to the clapper of the ship's bell on the forecastle-head and clangs it horribly in the big foo-foo crises, though Bombini can be heard censuring him severely on occasion. And to cap it all, the fog-horn machine pumps in at the oddest moments in imitation of a <b>big</b> <b>bass</b> viol.|$|E
60|$|Pensive and silent, then, we traversed the {{beautiful}} fields that lie behind Hempstead, and wandered on, until the fiddle, and the hautboy, and the shout, and the laugh, were swallowed {{up in the}} deep sound of the <b>big</b> <b>bass</b> drum, and even that died away into a distant rumble. We passed along the pleasant sequestered walk of Nightingale lane. For a pair of lovers what scene could be more propitious?--But such a pair of lovers! Not a nightingale sang to soothe us: the very gypsies who were encamped there during the fair, made no offer to tell the fortunes of such an ill-omened couple, whose fortunes, I suppose, they thought too legibly written to need an interpreter; and the gypsey children crawled into their cabins and peeped out fearfully at us as we went by. For a moment I paused, and was almost tempted to turn gypsey, but the poetical feeling for the present was fully satisfied, and I passed on. Thus we travelled, and travelled, like a prince and princess in nursery chronicle, until we had traversed a part of Hempstead Heath and arrived {{in the vicinity of}} Jack Straw's castle.|$|E

60|$|Because this fish-story has {{so little}} of fish in it does not prove that a man cannot fish for other game than fish. I {{remember}} when I was a boy that I went with my brother--the R. C. and the Reddy of the accompanying pages--to fish for bass at Dillon's Falls in Ohio. Alas for Bill Dilg and Bob Davis, who never saw this blue-blooded home of bronze-back black-bass! In {{the heat of the}} day my brother and I jabbed our poles into the bank, and set off to amuse ourselves some other way for a while. When we returned my pole was pulled down and wabbling so as to make a commotion in the water. Quickly I grasped it and pulled, while Reddy stared wide-eyed and open-mouthed. Surely a <b>big</b> <b>bass</b> had taken my bait and hooked himself. Never had I felt so heavy and strong a bass! The line swished back and forth; my pole bent more and more as I lifted. The water boiled and burst in a strange splash. Then! a big duck flew, as if by magic, right out from before us. So amazed was I that he nearly pulled the pole out of my hands. Reddy yelled wildly. The duck broke the line and sped away.... That moment will never be forgotten. It took us so long to realize that the duck had swallowed my minnow, hooked himself, and happened to be under the surface when we returned.|$|E
6000|$|I vainly pleaded my own total {{ignorance of}} music, and total want of taste in that direction. He only {{appealed to me}} again with a vehemence which set all further protest on my part at defiance. [...] "The English and the Germans (he indignantly declared) were always reviling the Italians for their {{inability}} to cultivate the higher kinds of music. We were perpetually talking of our Oratorios, and they were perpetually talking of their Symphonies. Did we forget and did they forget his immortal friend and countryman, Rossini? What was Moses in Egypt but a sublime oratorio, which was acted on the stage instead of being coldly sung in a concert-room? What was the overture to Guillaume Tell but a symphony under another name? Had I heard Moses in Egypt? Would I listen to this, and this, and this, and say if anything more sublimely sacred and grand had ever been composed by mortal man?"--And without waiting for a word of assent or dissent on my part, looking me hard in the face all the time, he began thundering on the piano, and singing to it with loud and lofty enthusiasm--only interrupting himself, at intervals, to announce to me fiercely the titles of the different pieces of music: [...] "Chorus of Egyptians in the Plague of Darkness, Miss Halcombe!"--"Recitativo of Moses with the tables of the Law."--"Prayer of Israelites, at {{the passage of the}} Red Sea. Aha! Aha! Is that sacred? is that sublime?" [...] The piano trembled under his powerful hands, and the teacups on the table rattled, as his <b>big</b> <b>bass</b> voice thundered out the notes, and his heavy foot beat time on the floor.|$|E

50|$|Dengler's {{trademark}} {{style is}} marked by grounded and stylized bass lines, strident staccato bursts, a clean tone brought about by his Fender Jazz Bass, and octave jumps, almost in a disco-like fashion. The low E string is lowered to D as the band writes many songs in the keys of D and B minor. One of his influences is the Joy Division/New Order bass guitarist Peter Hook and, like Hook, he also wears his bass guitar very low - often near knee level - and uses a pick to pluck the strings. Others of his <b>biggest</b> <b>bass</b> influences are Simon Gallup of The Cure and John Taylor of Duran Duran.|$|R
