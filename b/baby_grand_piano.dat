25|$|Falco {{began to}} show signs of unusual musical talent very early. As a toddler, he was able to keep time with the drumbeat in songs he heard on the radio. He was given a <b>baby</b> <b>grand</b> <b>piano</b> for his fourth {{birthday}}; a year later, his birthday gift was a record player which he used to play music by Elvis Presley, Cliff Richard, and the Beatles. At age five, he auditioned for the Vienna Music Academy, where it was confirmed that he had absolute pitch.|$|E
25|$|Weber was {{considered}} a child prodigy, and an excellent pianist. As a girl, music was her passion, and her most treasured possession was a <b>baby</b> <b>grand</b> <b>piano.</b> Weber left home and lived in poverty {{while working as a}} street-corner evangelist and social activist for two years with the evangelical Church Army Workers, an organization similar to the Salvation Army, preaching and singing hymns on street-corners and singing and playing the organ in rescue missions in red-light districts in Pittsburgh and New York, until the Church Army Workers disbanded in 1900.|$|E

50|$|<b>Baby</b> <b>grand</b> <b>pianos</b> are the smallest, {{intended}} for homes, restaurants and similar applications where the <b>grand</b> style of <b>piano</b> is desired {{even at the}} expense of the longer scale and better sound that an upright format would permit in the available space.|$|R
25|$|The {{interiors}} {{were filled}} with grand perspectives, spectacular entryways, and long, wide staircases. First-class suites were given unique designs by select designers. The most luxurious accommodations were the Deauville and Trouville apartments, featuring dining rooms, <b>baby</b> <b>grand</b> <b>pianos,</b> multiple bedrooms, and private decks.|$|R
25|$|The Theatre Bar on Upper Deck {{featured}} red chairs, red drapes, a red {{egg crate}} fibreglass screen, {{and even a}} red <b>baby</b> <b>grand</b> <b>piano.</b> Some more traditional materials like wood veneer were used as highlights throughout the ship, especially in passenger corridors and staterooms. There was also an Observation Bar on Quarter Deck, a successor to its namesake, located in a similar location, on both previous Queens, which offered views through large windows over the ship's bow. This room was lost in QE2s 1972 refit, becoming galley space with the forward-facing windows plated over.|$|E
25|$|Today {{the rooms}} are {{furnished}} both with elements {{from the history of}} the residence as well as art and other objects that showcase contemporary Canadian culture, including pieces by the Group of Seven's Lawren Harris, Emily Carr, Jean Paul Lemieux, and Bill Reid. The Long Gallery's Chinoiserie decoration was restored in 1993 at the direction of Gerda Hnatyshyn, wife of Governor General Ray Hnatyshyn, putting back much of the furniture and artifacts that had been collected by the Machioness of Willingdon throughout her tour of China in 1926. The space, used to greet and host functions for ambassadors and high commissioners to Canada, now contains five carpets donated by the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank and a Steinway & Sons <b>baby</b> <b>grand</b> <b>piano</b> that belonged to Glenn Gould. Other consorts left their mark on Rideau Hall, such as Princess Louise's painted apple branches on a 6-panel Georgian door in the first-floor corridor and Nora Michener's donated collection of Inuit sculpture. Governor General Adrienne Clarkson and her husband, John Ralston Saul, not only oversaw the extensive repainting of the state rooms from a consistent white to more historically accurate and polychrome palette, but also worked with Ontario potter Bill Reddick to develop Rideau Hall's first Canadian porcelain state dinner service.|$|E

5000|$|Literal dueling pianos can be {{verified}} {{as early as}} the late 1890s, when ragtime piano players would actually [...] "duel" [...] in an effort to see who could play better and faster. In 1933, when B.H. O'Brien and Charlie Cantrell opened Pat O'Brien's Bar in New Orleans, they included a room where two piano players would entertain the crowd on copper-topped <b>baby</b> <b>grand</b> <b>pianos.</b> Players would take turns singing songs requested by the audience, written on cocktail napkins.|$|R
5000|$|The Sunset Marquis is {{inspired}} by Mediterranean style villas, with white and cream buildings and orange roofs and swimming pool. The long entrance pavilion of the hotel is reminiscent of hotels in Mediterranean France or Italy. It has 152 rooms. The rooms are described by Frommer's as being furnished in [...] "mahogany, metal and nubby textiles, with earth-toned fabrics, Noguchi Akari rice-paper lamps and marble counters". Villas are equipped with alarm systems and some have jacuzzis or <b>baby</b> <b>grand</b> <b>pianos.</b>|$|R
500|$|A Ballerina's Tale, a {{documentary}} film about Copeland, debuted at the Tribeca Film Festival in April 2015 and released through {{video on demand}} [...] and in limited release in theaters in October 2015. It was then aired in February 2016 as part of PBS' Independent Lens series. In May 2015, she was featured on 60 Minutes in a segment with correspondent Bill Whitaker. The following month, she served as a presenter at the 69th Tony Awards. In July 2015, {{a black and white}} book, Misty Copeland: Power and Grace, was released by photographer Richard Corman, with an introduction by Cindy Bradley. The book contains photographs of Copeland dancing at sunrise on and around a <b>baby</b> <b>grand</b> <b>piano</b> that washed ashore under the Brooklyn Bridge. Copeland was included in the 2015 International Best Dressed List, published by Vanity Fair. In October 2015, she performed on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert accompanied by cellist Yo-Yo Ma, who played [...] "Courante" [...] from Bach's Cello Suite No. 2.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} {{features}} Lee {{in a warehouse}} and begins with her burying a photograph beneath {{a hole in the}} floorboards. After she walks away singing [...] "Under your spell again, I can't say no to you" [...] while looking directly in the camera, the hole in the floorboard slowly covers up. As she walks by a bookcase, she touches the books placed on it and they start smoking. Then she goes to her desk to write in a diary, while the floorboards and items surrounding her begin to melt. After finishing with the writing, she walks by a mirror and takes a look at herself as it starts to melt. As she begins to play a <b>baby</b> <b>grand</b> <b>piano,</b> the piano and the room surrounding her begin to catch on fire until rain begins to fall and extinguishes the flames. The room appears to be burnt and wasted. As the sun begins to shine through the windows of the building, a small vine grows from the floorboard and expands across the room, and blue flowers begin to blossom from the vines above the piano.|$|E
500|$|Due to OutKast's newfound {{commercial}} success and higher {{budget for the}} album, the group enjoyed a more relaxed schedule and [...] "could really just live" [...] at the studio. The duo and studio musicians {{lived and worked in}} the studio for weeks straight, with Big Boi noting, [...] "It usually takes us two to three years to make a record because we take our time; we ain't giving you that fast food, trying to meet a deadline. It ain't done until it's done sonically." [...] For Aquemini, the duo used live instrumentation and improvisation, bringing a <b>baby</b> <b>grand</b> <b>piano</b> into the studio and hiring musicians who played [...] "everything from stoner funk to prog rock". Producer Neal H. Pogue recalled, [...] "That was the beauty of making all those records – having musicians come in and out. It was almost like a Motown, that's what we had. Or like a Stax Records thing. That's what I loved about it. It brought back that whole feeling of making records. It was organic." [...] Much of the music on Aquemini was formulated during jam sessions, in which one musician would begin with creating a chord pattern and the rest would incorporate their instruments following that sequence. While recording Aquemini, André 3000 drew influence from reggae music and listened to Bob Marley constantly during the sessions. After the musical aspects of a song were developed, André 3000 and Big Boi would then create lyrics that they felt would fit with the tone of the song.|$|E
50|$|In {{the last}} several years the school has added a new {{performing}} arts center with an 125-seat auditorium, an electronic music lab, practice rooms with <b>baby</b> <b>grand</b> <b>pianos</b> and a 5,000 square foot dance studio, as well as a new dormitory called Out-of-the-Way. The college also expanded the library, the sculpture studio, and added a new total health center (or THC) and exercise facility to the campus center. These additions made room for the world studies program in the old music building, a new student residence in the old health center, an expansion of the outdoor program into the old exercise room, and athletic space in the old dance studio.|$|R
5000|$|The group's YouTube videos {{show the}} musicians {{performing}} {{in a variety}} of open-air, natural, and exotic settings. These include locations in the Utah desert, {{at the edge of a}} 1,000-foot cliff, atop a speeding train, and at a beach, among many others. Anderson's goal was [...] "to put pianos in places where nobody would expect to see them", thereby generating marketing buzz for his store. In the videos, Schmidt is seen playing a variety of Yamaha <b>grand</b> and <b>baby</b> <b>grand</b> <b>pianos,</b> while Nelson plays acoustic and electric cello. Anderson plans to film Schmidt and Nelson performing at each of the New Seven Wonders of the World. Videos at the Great Wall of China ("Kung Fu Piano: Cello Ascends"), the Christ the Redeemer statue in Rio de Janeiro ("How Great Thou Art"), Chichen Itza ("The Jungle Book/Sarabande"), and Petra ("Indiana Jones and the Arabian Nights") have been completed.|$|R
2500|$|In {{a little}} over ten years the Schiller Company had clients in the United States, Canada, Hawaii and Italy; by 1909 it {{employed}} 300 people and had manufactured 40,000 pianos. The Schiller Factory had expanded into a [...] facility adjoining the water power provided by the Rock River to its east. F.G. Jones died in 1913 and his sons George and Edgar took over management of the Schiller Company. In 1936 the Schiller Piano Company merged with the Cable Piano Company and produced pianos under the name Cable and Conover. In 1943 the old Schiller factory was sold to Winter and Company of New York City. The factory remained in operation producing different products through the years, such as talking machines, player <b>pianos,</b> spinnets, <b>baby</b> <b>grand</b> <b>pianos</b> and pianos. Through the late 1960s the factory employed 100 people and produced up to 6,000 pianos per year. In 1971 the plant closed after the company shut down operations and moved them to Memphis, Tennessee. In 1975 Dean Dye of Oregon purchased the property and opened it as the Conover Square Shopping Mall. The building has changed owners at least twice since Dye purchased it but it has remained in use as [...] "Conover Square" [...] and occupied by various shops.|$|R
2500|$|... "Baby Grand" [...] is {{the fourth}} and final single {{released}} off Billy Joel's album The Bridge. A duet with Joel and Ray Charles, the song is a ballad dedicated to the <b>baby</b> <b>grand</b> <b>piano,</b> and the relationship it can share with its players. The two originally got together when Charles contacted Joel about the naming of his daughter, Alexa Ray, after Charles. Charles then suggested they create a song together.|$|E
2500|$|Two {{rooms of}} note were {{furnished}} {{at the time}} Ursuline Academy was completed. [...] The first, the Green Parlor, was designed for entertaining guests, hosting teas, and special occasions. It was furnished with green rugs, upholstered furniture, and lightly tinted, translucent green window draperies. The room contained an 1840 harp made in France which was the property of Mother Angela Lincoln (a relative of Abraham Lincoln) and a <b>baby</b> <b>grand</b> <b>piano</b> manufactured by the Steinway company. The piano was the gift of a student, whose father {{gave it to her}} as a graduation present. The other room was the Bishop's Parlor, a private suite for the bishop and important visitors. The suite consisted of a sitting room, bedroom, and bath room. The sitting room was furnished with finely carved dark oak furniture and bookcases retrieved from St. Peter's Mission, and the bedroom with dressers made of cherry.|$|E
2500|$|Capp {{is often}} {{associated}} with two other giants of the medium: Milton Caniff (Terry and the Pirates, Steve Canyon) and Walt Kelly (Pogo). The three cartoonists were close personal friends and professional associates throughout their adult lives, and occasionally referenced each other in their strips. According to one anecdote (from Al Capp Remembered, 1994), Capp and his brother Elliot ducked out of a dull party at Capp's home—leaving Walt Kelly alone to fend for himself entertaining a group of Argentine envoys who didn't speak English. Kelly retaliated by giving away Capp's <b>baby</b> <b>grand</b> <b>piano.</b> According to Capp, who loved to relate the story, Kelly's two perfectly logical reasons for doing so were: a. to cement diplomatic relations between Argentina and the United States, and b. [...] "Because you can't play the piano, anyway!" [...] (Beetle Bailey creator Mort Walker confirmed the story, relating a slightly expanded version in his autobiography, Mort Walker's Private Scrapbook, 2001.) ...|$|E
50|$|Disklaviers {{have been}} {{manufactured}} {{in the form of}} upright, <b>baby</b> <b>grand,</b> and <b>grand</b> <b>piano</b> styles (including a nine-foot concert grand). Reproducing systems have ranged from relatively simple, playback-only models to the PRO models which record performance data at resolutions that exceed the limits of normal MIDI data. From the late 1990s into the early 2000s, Yamaha also produced a GranTouch series of Disklaviers that were digital <b>pianos</b> with a <b>grand</b> <b>piano</b> action. In addition to recording, the GranTouch instruments were capable of playing back performances with moving keys although the moving keys were not necessary for the electronic reproduction of sound.|$|R
50|$|A piano bar (also {{known as}} a piano lounge) {{consists}} of a piano or electronic keyboard played by a professional musician, located in a cocktail lounge, bar, hotel lobby, office building lobby, restaurant, or on a cruise ship. Usually the pianist receives a small salary plus tips in a jar or basket {{on or near the}} piano, especially from patrons requesting a song traditionally written on a beverage napkin. Some piano bars feature a <b>baby</b> <b>grand</b> or <b>grand</b> <b>piano</b> surrounded by stools for patrons (or, somewhat humorously, an upright piano covered by a counter that makes it appear to be a <b>grand</b> <b>piano).</b> Others have a bar surrounding the piano or keyboard.|$|R

2500|$|Although {{his father}} was Greek Orthodox {{and his mother was}} a Baptist, Georgiou was sent to St Joseph Roman Catholic Primary School, Macklin Street, which was closer to his father's {{business}} on Drury Lane. Georgiou developed an interest in piano at a fairly young age, eventually using the family <b>baby</b> <b>grand</b> <b>piano</b> to work out the chords, since no one else there played well enough to teach him. Inspired by the popularity of the Beatles, at 15 he extended his interest to the guitar, persuaded his father to pay £8 for his first instrument, and began playing it and writing songs. He would escape at times from his family responsibilities to the rooftop above their home, and listen to the tunes of the musicals drifting from just around the corner from Denmark Street, which was then the centre of the British music industry. Stevens emphasised that the advent of West Side Story in particular affected him, giving him a [...] "different view of life". With interests in both art and music, he and his mother moved to Gävle, Sweden, where he attended primary school (Solängsskolan) and started developing his drawing skills after being influenced by his uncle Hugo Wickman, a painter. They subsequently returned to England.|$|E
60|$|The {{overturned}} {{and shattered}} furniture of the room, the brown pools of dried blood upon the floor, and prints of bloody hands on walls and woodwork evidenced {{something of the}} frightfulness of the battle that had been waged within the narrow confines of the apartment. Across the <b>baby</b> <b>grand</b> <b>piano</b> lay the corpse of another black warrior, while before the door of Lady Jane's boudoir were the dead bodies of three more of the faithful Greystoke servants.|$|E
50|$|Most overtly, however, Joe Raposo's sonic {{trademark}} was his seemingly obsessive, {{and often}} exhaustively authentic, live replication of the tonal quality and exact playback cadence of the 20th-century self-operating player piano when composing for and performing on a <b>grand,</b> <b>baby</b> <b>grand</b> or upright <b>piano.</b> He {{appears to have}} specifically tuned his Children's Television Workshop pianos not only to blatantly mimic the player piano in its antique tonality, but to achieve and then maintain what became a signature ragtime tack or saloon-piano sound by them.|$|R
50|$|In the 2000s, some pianos {{include an}} {{acoustic}} <b>grand</b> <b>piano</b> or upright piano combined with MIDI electronic features. Such a piano {{can be played}} acoustically, or the keyboard {{can be used as}} a MIDI controller, which can trigger a synthesizer module or music sampler. Some electronic feature-equipped pianos such as the Yamaha Disklavier electronic player piano, introduced in 1987, are outfitted with electronic sensors for recording and electromechanical solenoids for player piano-style playback. Sensors record the movements of the keys, hammers, and pedals during a performance, and the system saves the performance data as a Standard MIDI File (SMF). On playback, the solenoids move the keys and pedals and thus reproduce the original performance. Modern Disklaviers typically include an array of electronic features, such as a built-in tone generator for playing back MIDI accompaniment tracks, speakers, MIDI connectivity that supports communication with computing devices and external MIDI instruments, additional ports for audio and SMPTE I/O, and Internet connectivity. Disklaviers have been manufactured in the form of upright, <b>baby</b> <b>grand,</b> and <b>grand</b> <b>piano</b> styles (including a nine-foot concert grand). Reproducing systems have ranged from relatively simple, playback-only models to the PRO models which record performance data at resolutions that exceed the limits of normal MIDI data. The unit mounted under the keyboard of the piano can play MIDI or audio software on its CD or floppy disk drive.|$|R
50|$|In <b>grand</b> <b>pianos,</b> {{the frame}} and strings are horizontal, with the strings {{extending}} away from the keyboard. The action lies beneath the strings, and uses gravity as its means of return {{to a state of}} rest. There are many sizes of <b>grand</b> <b>piano.</b> A rough generalization distinguishes the concert grand (between 2.2 and(-) 3 m) from the parlor grand or boudoir grand (1.7 to(-) 2.2 m) and the smaller <b>baby</b> <b>grand</b> (around 1.5 m).|$|R

50|$|Octave {{stretching}} is less apparent {{on large}} pianos which have longer strings and hence less curvature {{for a given}} displacement; {{that is one reason}} why orchestras go to the expense of using very long concert <b>grand</b> <b>pianos</b> rather than shorter, less expensive <b>baby</b> <b>grand,</b> upright, or spinet pianos. Another reason is that long strings under high tension can store more acoustic energy than can short strings, giving larger instruments more volume and better sustain than similar, smaller instruments.|$|R
