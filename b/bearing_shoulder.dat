50|$|The {{original}} HUT {{design for}} the EMU, first used in 1980, included bellowed <b>shoulder</b> <b>bearings,</b> which allowed for variation in {{the angle of the}} <b>shoulder</b> <b>bearings.</b> This allowed for one configuration to ease donning of the suit, and a different configuration to allow maximum mobility during EVA. However, the limited life of the bellows prompted a redesign in 1990 to a fixed <b>shoulder</b> <b>bearing</b> angle and position, referred to as the Planar HUT, resulting in reduced mobility and more difficult donning and doffing.|$|R

40|$|Grease {{lubrication}} {{is widely}} applied to rolling bearings. The consistency of grease prevents it from leaking {{out of the}} bearing, {{makes it easy to}} use, and will give it good sealing properties. The same consistency prevents an optimal lubrication performance. Most of the grease is pushed out of the bearing during the initial phase of bearing operation and no longer actively participates in the lubrication process, leaving only a limited quantity available, which is stored inside the bearing geometry and on the <b>bearing</b> <b>shoulders</b> (covers or seals). This stored volume strongly determines the remaining lubrication process in the bearing. The distribution of this volume is determined by the grease flow, which is very complex to understand due to the strong nonlinear rheology. There is no consensus on the next phase in the lubrication process. The grease may bleed and provide oil to the raceway; it may be severely sheared in the raceway releasing oil; or small fresh quantities of grease may be sheared off from the volume stored on the shoulder. In addition, the lubrication process may be dynamic. Grease has self-healing properties where fresh grease is supplied in case of film breakdown and self-induced heat development. This article describes the state-of-the-art knowledge on grease lubrication, including grease flow, film formation, film reduction, dynamic behavior, and grease life...|$|R

40|$|The passive sizing system {{consists}} {{of a series of}} low-profile pulleys attached to the front and back of the <b>shoulder</b> <b>bearings</b> on a spacesuit soft upper torso (SUT), textile cord or stainless steel cable, and a modified commercial ratchet mechanism. The cord/cable is routed through the pulleys and attached to the ratchet mechanism mounted {{on the front of the}} spacesuit within reach of the suited subject. Upon actuating the ratchet mechanism, the <b>shoulder</b> <b>bearing</b> breadth is changed, providing variable upper torso sizing. The active system {{consists of}} a series of pressurizable nastic cells embedded into the fabric layers of a spacesuit SUT. These cells are integrated to the front and back of the SUT and are connected to an air source with a variable regulator. When inflated, the nastic cells provide a change in the overall <b>shoulder</b> <b>bearing</b> breadth of the spacesuit and thus, torso sizing. The research focused on the development of a high-performance sizing and actuation system. This technology has application as a suit-sizing mechanism to allow easier suit entry and more accurate suit fit with fewer torso sizes than the existing EMU (Extravehicular Mobility Unit) suit system. This advanced SUT will support NASA s Advanced EMU Evolutionary Concept of a two-sizes-fit-all upper torso for replacement of the current EMU hard upper torso (HUT). Both the passive and nastic sizing system approaches provide astronauts with real-time upper torso sizing, which translates into a more comfortable suit, providing enhanced fit resulting in improved crewmember performance during extravehicular activity. These systems will also benefit NASA by reducing flight logistics as well as overall suit system cost. The nastic sizing system approach provides additional structural redundancy over existing SUT designs by embedding additional coated fabric and uncoated fabric layers. Two sizing systems were selected to build into a prototype SUT: one active and one passive. From manned testing, it was found that both systems offer good solutions to sizing a SUT to fit a crewmember. This new system provided improved suit don/doff over existing spacesuit designs as well as providing better fit at suit operational pressure resulting in improved comfort and mobility. It was found that a SUT with a sizing system may solve several problems that have plagued existing HUT designs, and that a SUT with a sizing system may be a viable option for advanced suit architectures...|$|R
50|$|While the EMU {{is solely}} {{intended}} for the microgravity environment, where weight is not an issue, the I-Suit's planetary role makes weight a critical factor. By replacing the EMU's fiberglass Hard Upper Torso (HUT) section with a soft upper torso, or SUT, and by using lightweight titanium in place of stainless steel for load-bearing metal components, the I-suit weighs only 65 pounds (29 kg) without its life support backpack or thermal/micrometeoroid layer, compared to 107 lbs (49 kg) for the EMU. The suit also features a graphite-epoxy <b>shoulder</b> <b>bearing</b> housing, demonstrating {{the use of this}} material in place of aluminum. Replacing all the suit's bearing housings with graphite-epoxy would save a further ten pounds (5 kg).|$|R
60|$|The man was young, perhaps six {{or eight}} and twenty years of age. His dark skin, burnt almost to {{blackness}} by {{the heat of the}} sun, together with the fashion of his short, square-cut beard and of his garments, proclaimed him of Jewish or Egyptian blood, while the gold collar about his neck and the gold graven ring upon his hand showed that his rank was high. Indeed this wanderer was none other than the prince Aziel, nick-named the Ever-living, because of a curious mole upon his <b>shoulder</b> <b>bearing</b> a resemblance to the crux ansata, the symbol of life eternal among the Egyptians. By blood he was a grandson of Solomon, the mighty king of Israel, and born of a royal mother, a princess of Egypt.|$|R

The professional spectators, whom habit and theory had rendered as callous to the distress of the scene as medical men are to those of a surgical operation, walked homeward in groups, discussing the general principle of the statute under which the young woman was condemned, the nature of the evidence, and the arguments of the counsel, without considering even that of the Judge as exempt from their criticism.|$|R

30|$|The {{paramount}} goal of septic surgery of {{the shoulder}} is to preserve a good function. As contrasted with the hip, there is no weight <b>bearing</b> in the <b>shoulder.</b> Therefore, {{in the absence of}} any further problems (no clinical and paraclinical signs of infection), in combination with an agreeable function and subjective sense of well-being, the preservation of the spacer may be discussed. It has to be stressed out that this is a limited goal procedure. Preserving of such a hybrid-spacer may be accompanied with loss of function. Most often, patients who went through multiple revisions are highly satisfied with the absence of pain and the preservation of a basic articular function as mentioned above. In addition, it has to be mentioned that this procedure primarily should be used as a temporary solution. Definite aim of the treatment should remain the implantation of an arthroplasty. If this is, for some reason, not possible or the patient denies any further surgical treatment, the described method may be successful as a definite solution and leads to patient contentment.|$|R

60|$|It {{was bright}} {{daylight}} now, and the square enclosure within the stockade {{was filled with}} an anxious crowd who had just learned the evil tidings. Most of the censitaires were old soldiers and trappers who had served in many Indian wars, and whose swarthy faces and bold bearing told their own story. They were sons of a race which with better fortune or with worse has burned more powder than any other nation upon earth, and as they stood in little groups discussing the situation and examining their arms, a leader could have asked for no more hardy or more war-like following. The women, however, pale and breathless, were hurrying in from the outlying cottages, dragging their children with them, and <b>bearing</b> over their <b>shoulders</b> the more precious of their household goods. The confusion, the hurry, {{the cries of the}} children, the throwing down of bundles and the rushing back for more, contrasted sharply with the quiet and the beauty of the woods which encircled them, all bathed in the bright morning sunlight.

Only once, and then but for a moment, did we succeed in getting a sight of the actual summit, so pertinaciously did the clouds crawl round it. 3700 feet aloft a pyramid of black lava rises above the broken walls of an older crater, and is, to judge from its knife-edge, flat top, and concave eastern side, the last remnant of an inner cone which has been washed, or more {{probably}} blasted, away. Beneath it, according to the report of an islander to Dr. Davy (and what I heard was to the same effect), is a deep hollow, longer than it is wide, without an outlet, walled in by precipices and steep declivities, from fissures in which steam and the fumes of sulphur are emitted. [...] Sulphur in crystals abounds, encrusting the rocks and loose stones; and a stagnant pool of rain-water occupies the bottom of the Souffriere.

40|$|The {{necessary}} {{of school}} life in Taiwan {{junior and senior}} high school is the bag with one stripe. The stripe bag would lead to increase the trunk inclination and load <b>bearing</b> on <b>shoulder,</b> it would probability cause spine deformity and scoliosis. We considered 11 age 20 ~ 23 years normal subjects (all males) and one 21 years old patient, they carried stripe bag on the right shoulder with 0 %, 5 %, 10 %, 15 % body weight to simulate the trunk movements. There were 23 markers on trunk and 8 markers on lower extremity during the gait experiment. We used Euler angle and angles defined by Frigo et al. (2003) to analyze the changes of angles of each segment on the sagittal, frontal and horizontal plane, and to find the tendency of the trunk movements during gait and the effect of the stripe bag. The experiment results showed shoulder, pelvis and especially thoracic spine movements were limited by carrying stripe bag on the right shoulder, and the range of motion of trunk was increased for balance during gait. It also caused increase of trunk forward lean and trunk left inclination, and higher the right shoulder and lower the right side pelvis. And the conclusions of this study was that the weight of stripe bag should be lower than 5 % body weight, and overload with stripe bag would cause spinal deformity, the humpback and thoracic scoliosis. 單背帶的側背書包已是國內國高中生每日上下課的必備物品。研究指出，與未背負重物及以雙肩後背背包相較，單肩側背重物將造成身體側偏傾斜的增加，提高肩膀的負載承受量，亦可能造成脊椎病變與脊椎側彎(Scoliosis) 。 本研究以 11 位 20 ~ 23 歲的正常男性青年及 1 位 21 歲的特殊病例為本實驗的受試者，模擬單肩側背背包的軀幹運動，受試者以右肩側背身體重量之 0 %、 5 %、 10 %、 15 %的單背帶背包，共 31 顆反光球標記(軀幹 23 顆，下肢 8 顆) 以進行步態實驗，利用尤拉角(Euler angle) 與Frigo定義的角度來推導計算軀幹各肢段在三個人體解剖平面上的角度變化情形，觀察步態週期中軀幹的運動趨勢以及單肩側背背包影響人體軀幹運動的模式。 研究結果顯示，右肩側背重物限制肩與骨盆尤其是胸椎的運動，使軀幹須以更大的活動度來增加步態的平衡，並造成軀幹的前傾增加、冠狀面的軀幹左傾，與右肩位置上升，右側骨盆下降。最後，本研究所得之重要結論為側背背包之重量應低於身體重量之 5 %為佳，若長期側背重物將造成「駝背」與「胸椎」脊椎側彎的脊椎病變。謝誌 [...] I 中文摘要 [...] .

6000|$|In {{a year or}} two poor Mr. Toothaker {{was visited}} with a wearisome {{infirmity}} which settled in his joints and made him weaker than a child. He crept forth about his business, and came home at dinner-time and eventide, not with the manly tread that gladdens a wife's heart, but slowly, feebly, jotting down each dull footstep with a melancholy dub of his staff. We must pardon his pretty wife if she sometimes blushed to own him. Her visitors, when they heard him coming, looked for the appearance of some old, old man, but he dragged his nerveless limbs into the parlor--and there was Mr. Toothaker! The disease increasing, he never went into the sunshine save with a staff in his right hand and his left on his wife's <b>shoulder,</b> <b>bearing</b> heavily downward like a dead man's hand. Thus, a slender woman still looking maiden-like, she supported his tall, broad-chested frame along the pathway of their little garden, and plucked the roses for her gray-haired husband, and spoke soothingly as to an infant. His mind was palsied with his body; its utmost energy was peevishness. In a few months more she helped him up the staircase with a pause at every step, and a longer one upon the landing-place, and a heavy glance behind as he crossed the threshold of his chamber. He knew, poor man! that the precincts of those four walls would thenceforth be his world--his world, his home, his tomb, at once a dwelling-and a burial-place--till he were borne to a darker and a narrower one. But Rose was with him in the tomb. He leaned upon her in his daily passage from the bed to the chair by the fireside, and back again from the weary chair to the joyless bed--his bed and hers, their marriage-bed--till even this short journey ceased and his head lay all day upon the pillow and hers all night beside it. How long poor Mr. Toothaker was kept in misery! Death seemed to draw near the door, and often to lift the latch, and sometimes to thrust his ugly skull into the chamber, nodding to Rose and pointing at her husband, but still delayed to enter.

40|$|Training for a spacewalk or extravehicular {{activity}} (EVA) {{is considered a}} hazardous duty for NASA astronauts. This places astronauts at risk for decompression sickness as well as various musculoskeletal disorders from working in the spacesuit. As a result, the operational and research communities {{over the years have}} requested access to EVA training data to supplement their studies. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to document the comprehensive EVA training data set that was compiled from multiple sources by the Lifetime Surveillance of Astronaut Health (LSAH) epidemiologists to investigate musculoskeletal injuries. The EVA training dataset does not contain any medical data, rather it only documents when EVA training was performed, by whom and other details about the session. The first activities practicing EVA maneuvers in water were performed at the Neutral Buoyancy Simulator (NBS) at the Marshall Spaceflight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. This facility opened in 1967 and was used for EVA training until the early Space Shuttle program days. Although several photographs show astronauts performing EVA training in the NBS, records detailing who performed the training and the frequency of training are unavailable. Paper training records were stored within the NBS after it was designated as a National Historic Landmark in 1985 and closed in 1997, but significant resources would be needed to identify and secure these records, and at this time LSAH has not pursued acquisition of these early training records. Training in the NBS decreased when the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, opened the Weightless Environment Training Facility (WETF) in 1980. Early training records from the WETF consist of 11 hand-written dive logbooks compiled by individual workers that were digitized at the request of LSAH. The WETF was integral in the training for Space Shuttle EVAs until its closure in 1998. The Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory (NBL) at the Sonny Carter Training Facility near JSC opened in March 1997 and is the current site for US EVA training. Other space agencies also have used water to simulate weightlessness and train for EVAs. Russia has a training facility similar to the NBL named the Hydro Lab. The Hydro Lab began operations at the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center (GCTC) in 1980 and has been used extensively to the present. Although a majority of training in the Hydro Lab uses the Russian Orlan suit, a small number of sessions have been conducted using a NASA suit. The Japanese Weightlessness Environment Test System (WETS) went into service at the Tsukuba Space Center in 1997 but was closed in 2011 due to extensive earthquake damage. Several sessions were performed using a NASA suit, but these sessions were short and considered "development" runs. LSAH has assembled records from the WETF, NBL and Hydro Lab. Recording of the EVA training data has changed considerably from 1967 to present. The goal of early record keeping was to track use of hardware components, and the person involved was treated as a suited operator, not as a focus of interest. Records from the past two decades are fairly precise with the person, date, suit type and size noted. On occasion the length of the session was listed, but this data is not included on all records. Records were merged from data sources and extensive cleaning of the records was required since the multiple sources frequently overlapped and duplicated records. To date the LSAH EVA training dataset includes over 12, 500 EVA training sessions performed by NASA astronauts since 1981. The following variables are included for most records: Name, Sex, Event date, Event name, HUT type, HUT size, Facility, and Estimated run time. For a smaller subset of records, the following variables are available: Actual run time, Time inverted, and the suit components Waist <b>bearing</b> type, <b>Shoulder</b> harness, Shoulder pads, and Teflon inserts. The LSAH dataset is currently the most complete resource for data regarding EVA training sessions performed by NASA astronauts. However, it is not 100 percent complete since the WETS (Japan) and NBS (Marshall) training facility data were not included. This dataset has been compiled by LSAH to study the relationship of EVA training to musculoskeletal injuries but has many other non-medical applications. This dataset can be provided to other groups in order to respond to program and research questions with appropriate board approvals...|$|R
