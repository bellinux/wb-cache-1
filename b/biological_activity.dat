Their role includes the biotransformation of petroleum compounds into harmless compounds. In this paper, the use of <b>biological</b> <b>activities</b> as potential monitoring tools or bioindicators during bioremediation of hydrocarbon-contaminated soil are reviewed. The use of <b>biological</b> <b>activities</b> as bioindicators of hydrocarbon removal in soil has been reported with variable success. This variability can be attributed partially to the spatial variability of soil properties, which undoubtedly plays a role in the exposure of organisms to contaminants. Widely used bioindicators have been enzyme activities, seed germination, earthworm survival and microorganisms or microbial bioluminescence. A mixture of some successful utilization of <b>biological</b> <b>activities</b> and several failures, and inconsistencies reported, show that at this stage there is no general guarantee of successful utilization of <b>biological</b> <b>activities</b> as monitoring tools.

5|$|A {{number of}} species of Cyathus produce {{metabolites}} with <b>biological</b> <b>activity,</b> and novel chemical structures that are specific to this genus. For example, cyathins are diterpenoid compounds produced by C.helenae, C.africanus and C.earlei. Several of the cyathins (especially cyathins B3 and C3), including striatin compounds from C.striatus, show strong antibiotic activity. Cyathane diterpenoids also stimulate nerve growth factor synthesis, and {{have the potential to}} be developed into therapeutic agents for neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. Compounds named cyathuscavins, isolated from the mycelial liquid culture of C.stercoreus, have significant antioxidant activity, as do the compounds known as cyathusals, also from C.stercoreus.

Some of these BTP-type complexes selectively interact with curium and therefore are useful in its selective separation from lanthanides and another actinides. Dissolved Cm3+ ions bind with many organic compounds, such as hydroxamic acid, urea, fluorescein and adenosine triphosphate. Many of these compounds are related to <b>biological</b> <b>activity</b> of various microorganisms. The resulting complexes exhibit strong yellow-orange emission under UV light excitation, which is convenient not only for their detection, but also for studying the interactions between the Cm3+ ion and the ligands via changes in the half-life (of the order ~0.1 ms) and spectrum of the fluorescence.|$|E

5|$|Iron is {{involved}} in numerous biological processes. It {{is the most important}} transition metal in all living organisms. Iron-proteins are found in all living organisms: archaeans, bacteria and eukaryotes, including humans. For example, the color of blood is due to hemoglobin, an iron-containing protein. As illustrated by hemoglobin, iron is often bound to cofactors, such as hemes, which are non-protein compounds, often involving metal ions, that are required for a protein's <b>biological</b> <b>activity</b> to happen. The iron-sulfur clusters are pervasive and include nitrogenase, the enzymes responsible for biological nitrogen fixation. The main roles of iron-containing proteins are the transport and storage of oxygen, as well as the transfer of electrons.|$|E

Doxorubicin showed better activity than daunorubicin against mouse tumors, and especially solid tumors. It also showed a higher therapeutic index, yet the cardiotoxicity remained.|$|E
5|$|Prized as an {{ingredient}} in various foods, B.edulis is an edible mushroom held in high regard in many cuisines, and is commonly prepared and eaten in soups, pasta, or risotto.

Available fresh in autumn in Central, Southern and Northern Europe, it is most often dried, packaged and distributed worldwide. It keeps its flavour after drying, and it is then reconstituted and used in cooking. B.edulis is one of the few fungi sold pickled.

5|$|The type {{species of}} the genus Ramaria, R.botrytis was first {{described}} scientifically in 1797 by mycologist Christiaan Hendrik Persoon. A widely distributed species, it is found in North America, North Africa, central and eastern Europe, Australia, and Asia. The fungus is mycorrhizal with broadleaf trees, and fruits {{on the ground in}} wooded areas. There are several species of coral fungi that are superficially similar in appearance to R.botrytis, and although comparison of habitat or characteristics like color or branching morphology is often sufficient for identification, sometimes microscopy is required to definitively distinguish between them. Fruit bodies of Ramaria botrytis are edible, and young specimens have a mild, fruity taste. Some authors warn of laxative effects in susceptible individuals. The fungus contains several chemical compounds with in vitro <b>biological</b> <b>activity,</b> and fruit bodies have antimicrobial activity against several species and strains of drug-resistant bacteria that cause disease in humans.|$|E
5|$|Limited {{knowledge}} of the taxonomy, biogeography and natural history of deep sea communities prevents accurate assessment {{of the risk of}} species extinctions from large-scale mining. Data acquired from the abyssal North Pacific and North Atlantic suggest that deep-sea ecosystems may be adversely affected by mining operations on decadal time scales. In 1978, a dredge aboard the Hughes Glomar Explorer, operated by the American mining consortium Ocean Minerals Company (OMCO), made a mining track at a depth of 5000meters in the nodule fields of the CCFZ. In 2004, the French Research Institute for Exploitation of the Sea (IFREMER) conducted the Nodinaut expedition to this mining track (which is still visible on the seabed) to study the long-term effects of this physical disturbance on the sediment and its benthic fauna. Samples taken of the superficial sediment revealed that its physical and chemical properties had not shown any recovery since the disturbance made 26 years earlier. On the other hand, the <b>biological</b> <b>activity</b> measured in the track by instruments aboard the manned submersible bathyscaphe Nautile did not differ from a nearby unperturbed site. This data suggests that the benthic fauna and nutrient fluxes at the water–sediment interface has fully recovered.|$|E
5|$|Midazolam is a short-acting {{benzodiazepine}} {{in adults}} with an elimination half-life of 1.5-2.5 hours. In the elderly, {{as well as}} young children and adolescents, the elimination half-life is longer. Midazolam is metabolised into an active metabolite alpha1-hydroxymidazolam. Age-related deficits, renal and liver status affect the pharmacokinetic factors of midazolam {{as well as its}} active metabolite. However, the active metabolite of midazolam is minor and contributes to only 10 percent of <b>biological</b> <b>activity</b> of midazolam. Midazolam is poorly absorbed orally, with only 50 percent of the drug reaching the bloodstream. Midazolam is metabolised by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes and by glucuronide conjugation. The therapeutic as well as adverse effects of midazolam are due to its effects on the GABAA receptors; midazolam does not activate GABAA receptors directly but, as with other benzodiazepines, it enhances the effect of the neurotransmitter GABA on the GABAA receptors (↑ frequency of Cl− channel opening) resulting in neural inhibition. Almost all of the properties {{can be explained by the}} actions of benzodiazepines on GABAA receptors. This results in the following pharmacological properties being produced: sedation, induction of sleep, reduction in anxiety, anterograde amnesia, muscle relaxation and anticonvulsant effects.|$|E
