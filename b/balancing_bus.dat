The aim of D-SSSC is to control the power flow between two feeders from different substations. As a result of different cell losses and capacitors tolerance the cells DC bus voltage can deviate from their reference values. In the proposed scheme, by individually modifying the reference PWM signal for each cell, an effective balancing procedure is derived. The new balancing procedure needs only the line current sign and is independent of the main control strategy, which controls the total DC bus voltages of cascaded H-bridge. The effect of modulation index variation on the capacitor voltage is analytically derived for the proposed strategy. The proposed method takes advantages of phase shift carrier based modulation and can be applied for a cascaded H-bridge with any number of cells.

40|$|State {{estimation}} {{plays an}} important role in modern power systems. The errors in the telemetered measurements and the connectivity information of the network will greatly contaminate the estimated system state. This dissertation provides solutions to suppress the influences of these errors. A two-stage state estimation algorithm has been utilized in topology error identification in the past decade. Chapter II discusses the implementation of this algorithm. A concise substation model is defined for this purpose. A friendly user interface that incorporates the two-stage algorithm into the conventional state estimator is developed. The performances of the two-stage state estimation algorithms rely on accurate determination of suspect substations. A comprehensive identification procedure is described in chapter III. In order to evaluate the proposed procedure, a topology error library is created. Several identification methods are comparatively tested using this library. A remote measurement calibration method is presented in chapter IV. The un-calibrated quantities can be related to the true values by the characteristic functions. The conventional state estimation algorithm is modified to include the parameters of these functions. Hence they can be estimated along with the system state variables and used to calibrate the measurements. The measurements taken at different time instants are utilized to minimize the influence of the random errors. A method for auto tuning of measurement weights in state estimation is described in chapter V. Two alternative ways to estimate the measurement random error variances are discussed. They are both tested on simulation data generated based on IEEE systems. Their performances are compared. A comprehensive solution, which contains an initialization process and a recursively updating process, is presented.

However, in the case of subcontracting the transportation of pupils, unbalanced tours can increase the costs significantly as the lengths of some tours can exceed the daily fixed driving goal and will result in over-hour charges. This paper proposes a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) model and a matching-based heuristic algorithm to solve the <b>balanced</b> school <b>bus</b> scheduling problem in a multi-school setting. The heuristic is guaranteed to find the minimum number of buses. The effectiveness of the heuristic algorithm is tested by comparing its solutions with the solutions obtained from the MIP whenever the MIP could find a good solution. For larger cases where the MIP cannot find a good solution, we illustrate the performance of the heuristic by showing how it affects the durations of the tours. To illustrate the performance of the MIP and heuristic, we examine 12 different problems with different numbers of trips which are all based on two real-world problems. A California case study with 54 trips and the Howard County Public School System (HCPSS) with 994 trips. The numerical results of testing our approach indicate that the proposed algorithm can find reasonable solutions in a significantly shorter time. The balanced solutions of our algorithm can save up to 16 % of school bus operation costs compared to the best solution found from the MIP model after 40 hours.

Existing routers, however, may generate dense meander segments with small distance. Signals propagating across these meander segments exhibit a speedup effect due to crosstalks between the segments of the same wire, thus leading to mismatch of arrival times even with the same physical wire length. In this paper, we propose a post-processing method to enlarge the width and the distance of meander segments and distribute them more evenly on the board so that the crosstalks can be reduced. In the proposed framework, we model the sharing combinations of available routing areas after removing dense meander segments from the initial routing, {{as well as the}} generation of relaxed meander segments and their groups in subareas.

The approach {{is based on}} the new average model approach established in this paper, which identifies cross-coupling interactions between the system-level and submodule elements using decomposed dependent sources. As well as improving the damping of the system, the major advantage of this approach is that it maintains the natural DC <b>bus</b> <b>balance</b> property of a PWM modulated MMC by considering the upper and lower arms together (unlike existing feed-forward schemes which treat each MMC arm independently). Moreover, unlike existing direct control resonant strategies, which require careful gain tuning and are highly dependent on the ac system frequency, the proposed approach achieves wideband circulating current ripple suppression without requiring knowledge of the circulating current harmonic frequencies and needs only a simple proportional-integral (PI) controller to regulate the circulating current dc component for power balance. This makes it particularly suitable for use in multifrequency or variable-frequency ac systems.

This paper describes a methodology developed in Melbourne, Australia to assist the road management authority, VicRoads, evaluate trade-offs {{in the use of}} its limited road-space for new bus and tram priority projects. The approach employs traffic micro-simulation modelling to assess road-space re-allocation impacts, travel behaviour modelling to assess changes in travel patterns and a social cost benefit framework to evaluate impacts. The evaluation considers a comprehensive range of impacts including the environmental benefits of improved public transport services. Impacts on public transport reliability improvements are also considered. Although improved bus and tram reliability is a major rationale for traffic priority its use in previous evaluations is rare. The paper critiques previous approaches, describes the proposed method and explores some of the results found in its application.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{question}} How can {{the design of}} buses and systems of design for route bus bodywork manufacture reduce {{the negative effects of}} specification diversity? by examining the application of mass customisation processes to an area of bespoke production – the public route bus. The route bus is an essential element of the transport system providing cost efficient public transport, but route buses are manufactured to the specification of bus operators and this design may differ significantly from other bus operators whose supply of vehicles is from the same bodywork manufacturer. The bus bodywork manufacturer must accommodate this specification diversity. The present method for doing so is by means of bespoke production to ensure the bus meets the operator’s explicit specification, but this process is time consuming and expensive in design and manufacture. Where diversity is accommodated by bespoke manufacturing there are functional benefits to the bus operator and passenger, however there are negative consequences in manufacture. This research set out to determine methods of reducing the repercussions of specification diversity; vehicle cost, design and engineering time, and production efficiency. This was achieved by generating physical designs and design methods <b>balancing</b> the <b>bus</b> operators’ access to a suitable product and the manufacturer’s ability to increase efficiency and quality of that product. The research methods explored mass customisation theories through product design experiments. This method required seeking out theoretical perspectives on the research problem and bringing them to bear on two studio experiments – the design of a driver’s area and a bus interior to meet the requirements of all stakeholders in bus transport. The research resulted in four critical interventions to the present bespoke manufacturing methodology, establishing means of reducing the negative impacts of specification diversity in route bus design.
