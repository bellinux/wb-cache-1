40|$|Performance {{data are}} {{presented}} for a flight-like, lightweight, high efficiency pulse tube cryogenic cooler. The cooler has {{a mass of}} less than 4. 0 kg, and an efficiency of 12 W/W, which is 18 % of Carnot at 95 K, nearly double the efficiency of previous cooler designs, The mass of the cooler has been reduced by approximately a factor of three. The design point cooling power is 10 watts at 95 K at a heat rejection temperature of 300 K. The no-load temperature is 45 K. The compressor is built by Hymatic Engineering, UK, and is of a horizontally opposed piston design using flexure bearings. The vertical pulse tube is built by TRW with the heat exchanger or cold block located approximately mid-way along the tube. The final assembly and integration is also performed by TRW. The inertance tube and dead volume are contained within one of the compressor end caps. The cooler was developed by TRW under a joint NASA-DOD program, and has a goal of 10 yr operating lifetime. Potential NASA applications will focus on using coolers of this type in Zero <b>boil</b> <b>off</b> (ZBO) cryogen storage topologies for next generation launch vehicles. Zero <b>boil</b> <b>off</b> <b>systems</b> will feature significant reductions in tank size and Initial Mass to Low Earth Orbit (IMLEO), thereby significantly reducing the cost of access to space, and enabling future missions. The coolers can be used directly in liquid oxygen (LOx) or liquid methane ZBO systems, as shield coolers in liquid hydrogen tanks, or as first stage coolers in two-stage liquid hydrogen (LH 2) ZBO cooler systems. Finally, the coolers could find applications in exploration missions where either propellants or breathable oxygen are extracted from the planetary atmosphere using a Sabatier or similar process. The gases could then be liquefied for storage either directly in return vehicle propellant tanks or on the planetary surface. Data presented were taken with the cooler operating in a vacuum of 10 (exp - 5) torr, at controlled rejection temperatures from 300 K down to 275 K using a cold water heat exchanger bolted to the cooler. Heat loads were varied between 0. 5 W and 15 W by supplying current to a 50 omega resistor mounted on a copper cold plate which was bolted to the cooler cold block. Silicon diodes mounted on both the cold plate and the heat exchanger provided accurate temperature measurement to within plus or minus 0. 25 K and plus or minus 0. 5 K respectively, up to 100 K with plus or minus 1 % accuracy above 100 K. Input power to the compressor was limited to 180 W, corresponding to a maximum stroke of 80 %...|$|R

40|$|Kennedy Space Center {{is home to}} two liquid {{hydrogen}} storage tanks, one at each launch pad of Launch Complex 39. The {{liquid hydrogen}} storage tank at Launch Pad B has a significantly higher <b>boil</b> <b>off</b> rate that the liquid hydrogen storage tank at Launch Pad A. This research looks at various calculations concerning the at Launch Pad B {{in an attempt to}} develop a solution to the excess <b>boil</b> <b>off</b> rate. We will look at Perlite levels inside the tank, <b>Boil</b> <b>off</b> rates, conductive heat transfer, and radiant heat transfer through the tank.

50|$|<b>Boil</b> <b>off</b> rate {{is governed}} by heat leakage and by the {{quantity}} of propellant in the tanks. With partially filled tanks, the percentage loss is higher. Heat leakage depends on surface area, while the original mass of propellant in the tanks depends on volume. So by the cube-square law, the smaller the tank, the faster the liquids will boil off.Some propellant tank designs have achieved a liquid hydrogen <b>boil</b> <b>off</b> rate as low as approximately 0.13% per day (3.8% per month) while the much higher temperature cryogenic fluid of liquid oxygen would <b>boil</b> <b>off</b> much less, about 0.016% per day (0.49% per month).|$|R

50|$|A soda {{locomotive}} {{could run}} for several hours, {{but eventually the}} soda would become diluted and wouldn't produce enough heat to continue generating steam. For reconcentrating, the caustic soda was either transferred out of the boiler of the locomotive and boiled in open vats, or, rather more conveniently, by injecting superheated steam at a high enough temperature to <b>boil</b> <b>off</b> the water in solution. A stationary boiler would be hooked up and feed superheated steam through the soda to <b>boil</b> <b>off</b> the water and effectively recharge the soda.|$|R
50|$|The insulation, as {{efficient}} as it is, will not keep LNG cold enough by itself. Inevitably, heat leakage will warm and vapourise the LNG. Industry practice is to store LNG as a boiling cryogen. That is, the liquid is stored at its boiling point for the pressure at which it is stored (atmospheric pressure). As the vapour <b>boils</b> <b>off,</b> heat for the phase change cools the remaining liquid. Because the insulation is very efficient, only a relatively small amount of <b>boil</b> <b>off</b> is necessary to maintain temperature. This phenomenon is also called auto-refrigeration.|$|R

50|$|The A-type package boiler has two water {{drums and}} one steam drum {{compared}} to the D-type package boiler. Water <b>boils</b> <b>off</b> in the water drums shared by a common header, then sent up the generating tubes, into the steam drum and up the dry pipe.
