60|$|The {{progress}} of the fight along the beach road was visible from Mulinuu, and Brandeis despatched ten boats of reinforcements. They crossed the harbour, paused for a while beside the Adler--it is supposed for ammunition--and drew near the Matautu shore. The Mataafa men lay close among the shore-side bushes, expecting their arrival; when a silly lad, in mere lightness of heart, fired {{a shot in the}} air. My native friend, Mrs. Mary Hamilton, ran out of her house and gave the culprit a good shaking: an episode in the midst of battle as incongruous as the grazing cow. But his sillier comrades followed his example; a harmless volley warned the boats what they might expect; and they drew back and passed outside the reef for the passage of the Fuisa. Here they came under the fire of {{the right wing of the}} Mataafas on the river-bank. The <b>beach,</b> <b>raked</b> east and west, appeared to them no place to land on. And they hung off in the deep water of the lagoon inside the barrier reef, feebly fusillading the pilot house.|$|R
40|$|Human {{actions can}} {{contribute}} to degradation of coastal environments or they can {{increase the likelihood that}} these environments will be restored. Beach nourishment provides a basis for restoration, but ways must be found to add habitat improvement to projects designed for shore protection. This study examines how beach nourishment projects can help reinstate dune landscapes in locations where beaches and dunes had been replaced by static shore protection structures. Dune topography and vegetation on three nourished sites on the northern Adriatic Coast of Italy are compared to a reference site to evaluate changes after beach fill was emplaced. Results reveal how nourishment projects used for shore protection can restore the space available for dunes to form, increase the likelihood of sediment transfers inland and increase the diversity of topography and vegetation. <b>Beach</b> <b>raking</b> prevents formation and growth of hummocky, incipient backshore dunes that would otherwise evolve into a naturally functioning foredune. Sand-trapping fences can speed the process of foredune development but can be counterproductive if they interfere with transport to beach grass (Ammophila littoralis) planted landward of them. Shore protection structures can provide stability and more time for dune evolution on eroding shores, resulting in greater species richness and longer retention of ecological niches. These structures need not be required if re-nourishment occurs frequently enough to provide a beach wide enough to protect against storm wave uprush...|$|R
50|$|The 128th Infantry Brigade was one {{of three}} British brigades that made an assault landing at Salerno in Italy as part of British X Corps under command of US Fifth Army, led by Mark Clark in September 1943. The landing was opposed by shore {{batteries}} firing shrapnel, and the <b>beaches</b> were <b>raked</b> by machine gun fire. 2nd Battalion and 1/4th Battalion made steady progress, but 5th Battalion had been landed in the wrong place and suffered heavily. A German counter-attack overran ‘B’ Company and the Battalion HQ of 5th Battalion. The 5th Battalion lost 40 men killed and over 300 were wounded or taken prisoner.|$|R
50|$|The {{company was}} founded by Harold S. Barber in the 1960s after he invented the SURF RAKE Model 500 for {{grooming}} sand beaches. Barber now offers three models of SURF <b>RAKE</b> <b>beach</b> cleaners and two smaller sand-sifting units, the SAND MAN 850 and TT. Barber sand cleaners pick up debris including litter, seaweed and even oil tar balls and then level and give consistency to the groomed area.|$|R

[...] "Must have had a {{hurricane}} or something like that, to wash the <b>beach</b> and <b>rake</b> down some o' the trees. But I think I can find {{it as soon as}} I locate the trail leadin' that way. You know trails are great things. Why, when I was sailing on the Jessie D., from the South Sea Islands, we landed on a place where there was a trail running to a volcano. We took to it, and the first thing we know we went down into that ere volcano about a thousand feet. It made my hair stand on end, I can tell ye! Four o' us went down, an' the others had to git ropes an' haul us up ag'in, an' it took half a day to do it." ...|$|R
40|$|Coastal {{ecosystems}} {{provide important}} resources for social, {{economic and environmental}} capital to global and local communities. Socially, coastal ecosystems provide a place for people to recreate and {{get in touch with}} nature. Economically, tourism, fisheries, and businesses are dependent upon coastal resources. Environmentally, coasts provide habitat for diverse species of flora and fauna, and protection for watersheds and anthropogenic structures. This research investigates three studies in order to provide information on social, economic and environmental issues in Matagorda, Texas. The first study uses LIDAR (Light Image Detection-and-Ranging) scanning, a remote sensing methodology that uses laser pulses to collect X, Y, and Z coordinates, to evaluate coastal changes after Hurricane Ike. Results suggest that landscape loss occurs immediately after the hurricane, but recovers and fluctuates throughout the year. Also, different areas of the dunes show unique changes during different times of the year. The second study uses questionnaire surveys to collect demographic, social perspectives and opinions and economic information about coastal users on Matagorda Peninsula. The questionnaire investigates the most important characteristics to beach users, opinions and perceptions about beach safety, activities, maintenance and presence of seaweed, information about their trip, cost of their trip and demographics. The results provide broader knowledge about the beach users in Matagorda and indicate that while direct costs of using the beach are minimal, the indirect and intrinsic costs are much higher which result in a greater overall use value. The third study investigates the use of the sargassum, a natural marine subsidy, as a fertilizer for dune plants. <b>Beach</b> <b>raking</b> provides a cleaner, more aesthetically pleasing experience for beach users but alters the natural design of the ecosystem by subsequently moving sand, nutrients, subsidies for habitat and fauna from the fore-beach to the dunes. Results show that sargassum does have potential as a natural fertilizer as it did not negatively affect any of the species. The results could be used to alter management practices in order to capitalize on this natural resource while still providing a clean sandy beach for recreationalists. These three studies together provide ecological information about coastal functions and processes that can help in creating broad holistic science based management strategies...|$|R
2500|$|As {{the nation}} watched the spill on the {{television}} news, the hastily assembled volunteer crews gathered {{to clean up the}} oil in any way they could. [...] They distributed enormous piles of straw, spreading them over oiled sections of the <b>beach,</b> and then <b>raking</b> them into disposable piles. Other workers used steam to clean the oil off boulders, in the process boiling rock-clinging marine life such as mussels. [...] Airplanes dropped chemical dispersants to help break up the oil, even though those chemicals were themselves toxic to wildlife. [...] Bulldozers pushed contaminated sand into piles for offsite disposal. [...] Civilian volunteers rescued many tarred birds by taking them to numerous rescue facilities put together during the first days, but even after rescue the survival rate for birds was only around 12 percent. [...] The first dead dolphin was found, its blowhole clogged by oil. [...] Offshore, ships skimmed oil from the ocean surface into holding tanks, but as fast as they skimmed it up, new oil rolled in from the south.|$|R
