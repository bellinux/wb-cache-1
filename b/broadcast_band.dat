5|$|The college radio station, WNJR {{broadcasts}} on the FM <b>broadcast</b> <b>band.</b> Assisted by {{a faculty}} advisor from the Department of Theater and Communication, the student-run studio broadcasts in a freeform format with both nationally syndicated programs and Pittsburgh-based independent programs. Student on-air personalities produce radio programs including music, news, talk, and sports.|$|E
25|$|Another solution, {{especially}} for receiving antennas, {{is to use}} common 300Ω twin lead {{in conjunction with a}} folded dipole. The folded dipole is similar to the simple half-wave dipole but with the feedpoint impedance multiplied by 4, thus closely matching that 300Ω impedance. This is the most common household antenna for fixed FM <b>broadcast</b> <b>band</b> tuners, which usually include balanced 300Ω antenna input terminals.|$|E
25|$|With a 455kHz IF {{it is easy}} to get {{adequate}} {{front end}} selectivity with <b>broadcast</b> <b>band</b> (under 1600kHz) signals. For example, if the station being received is on 600kHz, the local oscillator will be set to 600 + 455 = 1055kHz. But a station on 1510kHz could also potentially produce an IF of 455kHz and so cause image interference. However, because 600kHz and 1510kHz are so far apart, {{it is easy to}} design the front end tuning to reject the 1510kHz frequency.|$|E

25|$|While CSSB {{is seldom}} used {{today in the}} AM/MW <b>broadcast</b> <b>bands</b> worldwide, some amateur radio {{operators}} still experiment with it.|$|R
50|$|These {{stations}} cover {{both the}} AM and FM <b>broadcast</b> <b>bands.</b> Where possible, nicknames of stations {{have been given}} alongside the frequencies.|$|R
25|$|Medium {{frequency}} (MF) {{and lower}} high frequency (HF) radio waves are significantly attenuated within the D layer, as the passing radio waves cause electrons to move, which then collide with the neutral molecules, {{giving up their}} energy. Lower frequencies experience greater absorption because they move the electrons farther, leading to greater chance of collisions. This {{is the main reason}} for absorption of HF radio waves, particularly at 10nbsp&MHz and below, with progressively less absorption at higher frequencies. This effect peaks around noon and is reduced at night due to a decrease in the D layer's thickness; only a small part remains due to cosmic rays. A common example of the D layer in action is the disappearance of distant AM <b>broadcast</b> <b>band</b> stations in the daytime.|$|E
25|$|The antenna {{converts}} {{the energy}} in the electromagnetic radio waves to an alternating electric current in the antenna, which {{is connected to the}} tuning coil. Since in a crystal radio all the power comes from the antenna, {{it is important that the}} antenna collect as much power from the radio wave as possible. The larger an antenna, the more power it can intercept. Antennas of the type commonly used with crystal sets are most effective when their length is close to a multiple of a quarter-wavelength of the radio waves they are receiving. Since the length of the waves used with crystal radios is very long (AM <b>broadcast</b> <b>band</b> waves are 182-566 m or 597–1857ft. long) the antenna is made as long as possible, from a long wire, in contrast to the whip antennas or ferrite loopstick antennas used in modern radios.|$|E
500|$|The {{practice}} {{of listening to}} distant stations in the medium wave AM <b>broadcast</b> <b>band</b> was carried over to the shortwave bands. [...] Frank Conrad, an early pioneer of medium wave broadcasting with KDKA in Pittsburgh, instituted {{some of the first}} shortwave broadcasts around 1921. Stations affiliated with General Electric and Crosley followed shortly after.|$|E
50|$|Numerous pirate radio {{stations}} have operated sporadically in or {{just outside the}} shortwave <b>broadcast</b> <b>bands.</b> Most are operated by hobbyists for the amusement of DX'ers with broadcasts typically {{only a few hours}} in length.|$|R
50|$|The most {{reliable}} frequencies for NVIS communications are between 1.8 MHz and 8 MHz. Above 8 MHz, {{the probability of}} success begins to decrease, dropping to near zero at 30 MHz. Usable frequencies are dictated by local ionospheric conditions, which have a strong systematic dependence on geographical location. Common bands used in amateur radio at mid-latitudes are 3.5 MHz at night and 7 MHz during daylight, with experimental use of 5 MHz (60-meter) frequencies. Broadcasting uses the tropical <b>broadcast</b> <b>bands</b> between 2.3 and 5.06 MHz, and the international <b>broadcast</b> <b>bands</b> between 3.9 and 6.2 MHz, Military NVIS communications mostly take place on 2-4 MHz at night and on 5-7 MHz during daylight.|$|R
50|$|Early radio listeners, often using {{home made}} crystal sets and long wire antennas, found radio {{stations}} {{few and far}} between. With the <b>broadcast</b> <b>bands</b> uncrowded, signals {{of the most powerful}} stations could be heard over hundreds of miles, but weaker signals required more precise tuning or better receiving gear.|$|R
500|$|Radios for shortwave {{reception}} {{generally have}} higher performance than those {{intended for the}} local AM or FM <b>broadcast</b> <b>band,</b> since dependable reception of shortwave signals requires a radio with increased sensitivity, selectivity, and stability. Modern shortwave radio receivers are relatively inexpensive and easily accessible, and many hobbyists use portable [...] "world band" [...] receivers and built-in telescopic antennas.|$|E
2500|$|For digital radio, the FCC chose {{proprietary}} HD Radio, which crowds {{the existing}} FM <b>broadcast</b> <b>band</b> and even AM <b>broadcast</b> <b>band</b> with in-band adjacent-channel sidebands, which create noise in other stations. [...] This {{is in contrast}} to worldwide DAB, which uses unused TV channels in the VHF band III range. [...] This too has patent fees, while DAB does not. [...] While there has been some effort by iBiquity to lower them, the fees for HD Radio are still an enormous expense when converting each station, and this fee structure presents a potentially high cost barrier to entry for community radio and other non-commercial educational stations when entering the HD Radio market.|$|E
2500|$|To {{suppress}} the unwanted image, the tuning of the RF {{stage and the}} LO may need to [...] "track" [...] each other. In some cases, a narrow-band receiver can have a fixed tuned RF amplifier. In that case, only the local oscillator frequency is changed. In most cases, a receiver's input band is wider than its IF center frequency. For example, a typical AM <b>broadcast</b> <b>band</b> receiver covers 510kHz to 1655kHz (a roughly 1160kHz input band) with a 455kHz IF frequency; an FM <b>broadcast</b> <b>band</b> receiver covers 88MHz to 108MHz band with a 10.7MHz IF frequency. In that situation, the RF amplifier must be tuned so the IF amplifier does not see two stations at the same time. If the AM <b>broadcast</b> <b>band</b> receiver LO were set at 1200kHz, it would see stations at both 745kHz (1200455kHz) and 1655kHz. Consequently, the RF stage must be designed so that any stations that are twice the IF frequency away are significantly attenuated. The tracking {{can be done with}} a multi-section variable capacitor or some varactors driven by a common control voltage. An RF amplifier may have tuned circuits at both its input and its output, so three or more tuned circuits may be tracked. In practice, the RF and LO frequencies need to track closely but not perfectly.|$|E
5000|$|By {{utilizing}} additional digital subcarriers or sidebands, {{digital information}} is [...] "multiplexed" [...] on an AM or FM analog signal, thus avoiding re-allocation of the <b>broadcast</b> <b>bands.</b> However, by putting RF energy {{outside of the}} normally-defined channel, interference to adjacent channel stations is increased when using digital sidebands.|$|R
50|$|IEEE 802.22 WRANs are {{designed}} {{to operate in the}} TV <b>broadcast</b> <b>bands</b> while assuring that no harmful interference is caused to the incumbent operation: digital TV and analog TV broadcasting, and low power licensed devices such as wireless microphones.The standard was expected to be finalized in Q1 2010, but was finally published in July 2011.|$|R
50|$|Voice of Korea {{broadcasts}} on HF or shortwave radio frequencies, {{as well as}} {{on medium}} wave for broadcasts aimed at neighboring countries. Some frequencies are well out of the ITU-allocated shortwave <b>broadcast</b> <b>bands,</b> making them less susceptible to interference and less likely to be listenable on older receivers. Recently, it has increased the share of satellite broadcasting.|$|R
2500|$|Crystal radios receive {{amplitude}} modulated (AM) signals, and can {{be designed}} to receive almost any radio frequency band, but most receive the AM <b>broadcast</b> <b>band.</b> A few receive [...] shortwave bands, but strong signals are required. [...] The first crystal sets received wireless telegraphy signals broadcast by spark-gap transmitters at frequencies as low as 20kHz.|$|E
2500|$|As {{early as}} 1927, there is {{evidence}} that public hearings were indeed held; among them, hearings to assess the expansion of the radio <b>broadcast</b> <b>band.</b> At these early hearings, the goal of having a broad range of viewpoints presented was evident, as not only broadcasters, but also radio engineers and manufacturers were in attendance. Numerous groups representing the general public appeared at the hearings as well, including amateur radio operators and inventors as well as representatives of radio listeners' organizations. Interestingly, ...|$|E
2500|$|In AM broadcasting, the {{dramatic}} ionospheric {{changes that occur}} overnight in the mediumwave band drive a unique broadcast license scheme, with entirely different transmitter power output levels and directional antenna patterns to cope with skywave propagation at night. [...] Very few stations are allowed to run without modifications during dark hours, typically only those on clear channels in North America. [...] Many stations have no authorization to run at all outside of daylight hours. [...] Otherwise, {{there would be nothing}} but interference on the entire <b>broadcast</b> <b>band</b> from dusk until dawn without these modifications.|$|E
40|$|Satellite sound {{broadcasting}} is, as {{the name}} implies, the use of satellite techniques and technology to broadcast directly from space to low-cost, consumer-quality receivers the types of sound programs commonly received in the AM and FM <b>broadcast</b> <b>bands.</b> It would be a ubiquitous service available {{to the general public}} in the home, in the car, and out in the open...|$|R
5000|$|In {{frequency}} modulation (FM) {{the frequency of}} the radio signal is varied slightly by the audio signal. FM broadcasting is permitted in the FM <b>broadcast</b> <b>bands</b> between about 65 and 108 MHz in the very high frequency (VHF) range. The exact frequency ranges vary somewhat in different countries. [...] "AM/FM" [...] radios have a switch to select which band to receive.|$|R
40|$|DVB-H (digital video broadcasting-handheld) {{allows the}} {{transmission}} of broadcast services for reception in the UHF and VHF bands via mobile phones and other small battery-powered devices. Measurements of the interference level in these <b>broadcast</b> <b>bands</b> show significant levels of man-made interference. This article presents a noise-immunity analysis of the DVB-H system, looking in particular at impulse noise which is known to possibly cause short-term receiver dropouts...|$|R
2500|$|For example, an AM {{broadcast}} {{station at}} 580nbsp&kHz is tuned on a receiver with a 455nbsp&kHz IF. The local oscillator is tuned to [...] 1035nbsp&kHz. But a signal at [...] 1490nbsp&kHz is also 455nbsp&kHz {{away from the}} local oscillator; so both the desired signal and the image, when mixed with the local oscillator, will also appear at the intermediate frequency. This image frequency is within the AM <b>broadcast</b> <b>band.</b> Practical receivers have a tuning stage before the converter, to greatly reduce the amplitude of image frequency signals; additionally, broadcasting stations {{in the same area}} have their frequencies assigned to avoid such images.|$|E
2500|$|From the Grand Terrace, Hines and {{his band}} {{broadcast}} on [...] "open mikes" [...] over many years, sometimes seven nights a week, coast-to-coast across America – Chicago being well placed to deal with live broadcasting across time zones in the United States. The Hines band became the most <b>broadcast</b> <b>band</b> in America. Among the listeners were a young Nat [...] "King" [...] Cole and Jay McShann in Kansas City, who said his [...] "real education came from Earl Hines. When 'Fatha' went off the air, I went to bed." [...] Hines's most significant [...] "student" [...] was Art Tatum.|$|E
2500|$|Most long-distance LF [...] "longwave" [...] radio {{communication}} (between 30kHz and 300kHz) {{is a result}} of groundwave propagation. Mediumwave radio transmissions (frequencies between 300kHz and 3000kHz), including AM <b>broadcast</b> <b>band,</b> travel both as groundwaves and, for longer distances at night, as skywaves. [...] Ground losses become lower at lower frequencies, greatly increasing the coverage of AM stations using {{the lower end of the}} band. The VLF and LF frequencies are mostly used for military communications, especially with ships and submarines. The lower the frequency the better the waves penetrate sea water. [...] ELF waves (below 3kHz) have even been used to communicate with deeply submerged submarines.|$|E

5000|$|Modulation is {{the process}} of adding {{information}} to a radio carrier wave. In Amplitude modulation (AM) the strength of the radio signal is varied by the audio signal. The AM <b>broadcast</b> <b>bands</b> are between 148 and 283 kHz in the longwave range, and between 526 and 1706 kHz in the medium frequency (MF) range of the radio spectrum. AM broadcasting is also carried out in shortwave bands, between about 2.3 and 26 MHz.|$|R
2500|$|In {{contrast}} to the wide television frequency bands, the FM <b>broadcast</b> <b>band</b> (88-108nbsp&MHz) is narrow enough that a dipole antenna can cover it. [...] For fixed use in homes, hi-fi tuners are typically supplied with simple folded dipoles resonant {{near the center of}} that band. [...] The feedpoint impedance of a folded dipole, which is quadruple the impedance of a simple dipole, is a good match for 300Ω twin lead, so that is usually used for the transmission line to the tuner. [...] A common construction is to make the arms of the folded dipole out of twin lead also, shorted at their ends. [...] This flexible antenna can be conveniently taped or nailed to walls, following the contours of mouldings.|$|E
2500|$|Mosquitos of No. 100 Group RAF {{acted as}} night intruders {{operating}} at high level {{in support of}} the Bomber Command [...] "heavies", to counter the enemy tactic of merging into the bomber stream, which, towards the end of 1943, was causing serious allied losses.
