40|$|This study {{examines}} phenotypic plasticity {{in relation to}} rearing density in larvae of the moth, Mamestra brassicae. Larval phase, growth rate, weight at moulting and susceptibility to disease were quantified when reared at five densities. Larvae develop more quickly, but attain a smaller size and {{are more susceptible to}} disease, when reared at high than at intermediate densities. They also exhibit a higher degree of melanisation than larvae reared at intermediate densities, or singly. A review of the literature suggests that a switch to a rapidly developing dark phase at high densities is a widespread phenomenon within the Lepidoptera. Rapid development at the expense of attaining a large size, and increased melanisation, are interpreted as adaptive responses to reach pupation <b>before</b> <b>food</b> <b>supplies</b> are depleted, as is likely when larval density is high. High susceptibility to viral infection at high density may be a result of physiological stress associated with rapid development, or due to a shift in allocation of resources from resistance to development: larvae that developed quickly were more susceptible to infection. Larvae reared singly appeared to be less fit than larvae reared at intermediate densities: they exhibited many of the characteristics of larvae reared at high density, particularly low weight, a right-hand skew in their weight frequency distribution, and high susceptibility to disease. I hypothesise that expression of resistance may be phenotypically plastic with regard to environment. Contact with other larvae may, up to a point, stimulate both growth and resistance to infection, for the risk of infection will increase with the density of conspecifics...|$|R

The efforts of governmental authorities have also increased to regulate and control <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> chains and product characteristics related to information to ensure safety, quality, and preservation of living resources. Previous studies in the area take an industrial focus and exclude the governmental authority focus. This thesis thus focuses on exploring governmental authority and industrial effects on traceability in <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> chains. The purpose is to extend the traceability capabilities in <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> chains that are influenced by governmental authorities. The thesis reports findings from literature reviews and case studies that investigated three research questions. The first question embraces different perspectives of <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> chain traceability in supply chain management (SCM) literature, {{as well as the}} science theoretical perspective of <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> chain traceability. The second question explores modelling techniques for mapping <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> chains based on two dimensional flows of information between a governmental authority and actors, and of the flows of physical goods in three fresh <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> chains. The third question concerns the effects on operational activities and traceability information in fresh <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> chains by implementing the RFID based smart goods concept. The results show that <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> chain traceability is a multidisciplinary concept which is important for governmental authorities. Supply chain management techniques for mapping descriptive information flows and for capturing information in supply chains are applicable to improve traceability in fresh <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> chains. The thesis further examines the influence of traceability on operational activities in <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> chains. The results presented contribute to the understanding of traceability in <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> chains affected by governmental regulations from a managerial point of view. This is useful for authorities and industrial firms in the food industry as well as for academia, since it shows that <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> chain traceability should be prioritised to influence future supply chain traceability setups and theoretical development of the research area...|$|R

50|$|During the Irish Confederate Wars (1641-1652), {{the fort}} at Duncannon was {{initially}} occupied by English soldiers {{and used as}} a base for an attack on nearby Redmond's Hall (now Loftus Hall). During this period it was besieged three times. In 1645, it was taken by an Irish Confederate army under general Thomas Preston. Its English garrison surrendered after lengthy bombardment, during which their second in command Larcan was killed, and a ship, The Great Lewis, trying to bring supplies to the garrison was sunk with the loss of 200 lives (see Siege of Duncannon). During the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland, Duncannon was besieged again, as part of the Siege of Waterford, firstly in November 1649 by Oliver Cromwell and Michael Jones in 1649. The fort's Irish garrison held out, and the siege was abandoned in December of that year. However, in July 1650, Henry Ireton renewed the siege, and the fort and town surrendered after the fall of Waterford, but <b>before</b> their <b>food</b> and <b>supplies</b> had run out.|$|R
40|$|In 1987, David Cairns {{proposed}} that a gradient of colony-based measures on seabirds {{could be used}} to assess <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> in the ocean. Measures closely tied to the ocean, such as foraging trip duration, would be sensitive to small declines in <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> while measures more closely tied with the nest site, such as reproductive success, would be sensitive to large declines in <b>food</b> <b>supply.</b> The continual refinement of tracking devices holds the potential to clearly link variables measured via seabirds to <b>food</b> <b>supply,</b> possibly extending Cairns' hypothesis. Here, we review the various tests of Cairns' hypothesis, and demonstrate that those tests have had variable success, partly because of the complex and nonlinear relationships between <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> and colony-based measures.

40|$|Tubenoses and swifts develop slowly, {{and often}} have a {{variable}} <b>food</b> <b>supply.</b> Lack (1968) attributed this to convergent evolution, arguing that slow growth is an adaptation allowing survival in environments with a variable <b>food</b> <b>supply.</b> In this thesis, I test {{whether there is a}} general relationship among bird species between slow growth rate and variability in <b>food</b> <b>supply.</b> I analysed data on nestling period, growth rates for mass and wing length, and variability in <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> in birds using phylogenetically independent contrasts. Variability in <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> may be correlated with feeding frequency, and growth rate is correlated with predation risk. I included these potential confounds in my analysis. Variability in <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> was correlated with nestling period, and negatively correlated with mass and wing growth rate, taking average feeding frequency and predation risk into account. I show that nest site preference is incompletely coadapted with growth rate. The correlations between growth rate and variability in <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> could also be explained by the proximate effect of environmental variability on growth. I therefore tested predictions of Lack's hypothesis, in comparison to those of growth models assuming facultative growth adjustments in response to variability in <b>food</b> <b>supply.</b> This further supported Lack's hypothesis. While Lack proposed that slow growth is an adaptation to variability in <b>food</b> <b>supply,</b> he did not explain the underlying mechanism. I examined three possible mechanisms, along with two alternative explanations where slow growth is not an adaptation to a variable <b>food</b> <b>supply,</b> and tested them with comparative data. I developed two of these models using computer simulations which predicted that survival is increased by reducing maximum lean tissue growth rates and increasing maximum fat deposition rates when <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> is variable. I tested predictions from these models using experiments on the Welcome Swallow, corroborating a model that predicts that lean tissue growth is prioritised over fat deposition but that fat deposition is facilitated by reduced lean tissue growth rates. I also tested whether swifts and tubenoses are adapted to an unpredictably, or predictably, variable <b>food</b> <b>supply,</b> and discuss the degree to which chicks of swifts and tubenoses are well designed for survival in environments with a variable <b>food</b> <b>supply...</b>|$|R

These include the assessment of food security and quality preservation, economic, logistic, supply chain management, and information technical. Because of this, the concept of <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> chain traceability is defined in many different ways, depending on the scientific area of the research perspective used for investigation. This makes the concept and the scientific value of <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> chain traceability sometimes hard to understand theoretically. Thus, it is of great importance to position the concept theoretically and in relation to other scientific research areas. The purpose {{of this paper}} is to examine how <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> chain traceability can be theoretically positioned in academic supply chain research. Design/methodology/approach: The paper is based on a literature review of definitions and perspectives of <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> traceability, and of the concepts and definitions used within the paradigm thinking found in relevant scientific articles and books. Findings: The results show that <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> chain traceability is pre-paradigm research and further suggests that it should be treated as a “physical representational space” in scientific theory. The results also verify that <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> chain traceability is a complex research field, which is studied by using several perspectives in different research areas, especially logistics. It is important to clarify the perspective that has been applied when making suggestions concerning logistics development.

40|$|Part 1 : SustainabilityInternational audienceReduction {{of waste}} in <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> chains is an {{important}} sustainability issue. More efficient utilisation {{and management of the}} resources and values created in <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> chains can contribute to improving competitiveness, and environmental and social responsibility. This study uses the seven wastes approach from lean theory to classify categories of waste in fresh <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> chains and to identify at which stage of the supply chain waste occur. A case is used to illustrate the applicability of the classification. The analysis identifies four categories of waste in the fresh <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> chain; time, distance, energy and mass. The study indicates that the majority of waste is hidden in time, energy and mass categories, related to overproduction, defects and transportation...|$|R
40|$|Four zones were {{determined}} by the benthic foraminifera morphogroup for showing oxygen and productivity change. The approximate low oxygen and high <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> has been indicates zone of one that increase infauna to epifauna morphotype percent is low (nearness 60 % infouna, 40 % epifauna). In zone two, with due attention to equal percent of Epifauna ratio to infauna, intermediate oxygen and <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> is anticipated. The decrasing epifauna foraminifera and increasing infauna demonstrates low oxygen and high <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> condition at zone of three. In zone four, increasing epifauna (approximate 90 percent) that are indicated high oxygen condition and low <b>food</b> <b>supply.</b> Analysis of planktonic foraminifera assemblage at this section with Cretaceous biostratigraphical provinces is indicating a close similarity with Tethyan provinces...|$|R
