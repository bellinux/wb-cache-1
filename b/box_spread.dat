5000|$|In futures trading, a <b>box</b> <b>spread</b> is {{a spread}} {{constructed}} from two consecutive butterfly spreads (also {{known as a}} [...] "double butterfly"), summing to +1 -3 +3 -1 in consecutive, or at least equally spaced, contracts. The term also has an alternative meaning {{within the context of}} inter-commodity spreads whereby it refers to either an inter-commodity spread within one month offset by the same inter-commodity spread but in another month (or alternatively a calendar spread for each respective instrument). Often presumed not to move much (as in theory they are practically non directional) they typically, but not always, trade in a range. The <b>box</b> <b>spread,</b> like normal butterfly and calendar spreads, derives it's hedging construction from characteristics of Pascal's Triangle.|$|E
5000|$|They {{are often}} called [...] "alligator spreads" [...] because the {{commissions}} eat up all your profit {{due to the}} large number of trades required for most <b>box</b> <b>spreads.</b>|$|R
50|$|By 1935 a {{fire brigade}} and {{ambulances}} {{were available to}} protect the town during emergencies.

Three motor ambulances and a motorised utility van were kept at the fire station, operated by permanent staff.|$|R

5000|$|A <b>box</b> <b>spread</b> {{position}} has a constant payoff at exercise {{equal to the}} difference in strike values. Thus, the 40-50 box example above is worth 10 at exercise. For this reason, a box is sometimes considered a [...] "pure interest rate play" [...] because buying one basically constitutes lending some money to the counterparty until exercise.|$|E
5000|$|As another example, [...] "buying the Cal 13-12, SP-NP box spread", {{would be}} buying power at CAISO hub SP versus selling power at CAISO hub NP for 2013, while also doing the {{opposite}} (so, selling at SP and buying at NP) for 2012. (In some markets, a leg that is purchased is mentioned before a leg that is sold and commonly {{the more expensive}} leg is also mentioned first (to avoid using a negative spread price). Therefore, {{the way that the}} CAISO <b>box</b> <b>spread</b> is referred to suggests that SP is trading over NP, and SP-minus-NP is wider in 2013 than in 2012). Another pair of contracts that commonly trade box spreads are WTI and Brent crude oil, either in the form of intra-commodity calendar spreads for WTI and Brent using the same calendar expirations for each or different expiration WTI/Brent inter-commodity spreads. One motivation for trading a box would be to roll an existing two-leg spread position to another (typically later) time period. E.g., to roll one's existing 2012 SP-NP spread position out to 2013 (i.e., close 2012 and replace with 2013), or to trade the <b>box</b> <b>spread</b> itself by taking a view {{that there will be a}} widening or narrowing of the spread within the box itself.|$|E
5000|$|In options trading, a <b>box</b> <b>spread</b> is a {{combination}} of positions that has a certain (i.e. riskless) payoff, considered to be simply [...] "delta neutral interest rate position". For example, a bull spread constructed from calls (e.g. long a 50 call, short a 60 call) combined with a bear spread constructed from puts (e.g. long a 60 put, short a 50 put) has a constant payoff of the difference in exercise prices (e.g. 10) assuming that the underlying stock does not go ex-dividend before the expiration of the options. If the underlying asset has a dividend of x, then the settled value of the box will be 10+x. Under the no-arbitrage assumption, the net premium paid out to acquire this position should be equal to the present value of the payoff.|$|E

40|$|Este estudo avalia a atratividade, no mercado financeiro brasileiro, do <b>Box</b> <b>Spread,</b> uma estratégia envolvendo compra e venda de quatro opções que, em seu conjunto, possuem retorno certo e conhecido. Por suas características, a operação pode ser considerada um título de renda fixa sintético. Comparou-se simulações teóricas da estratégia com instrumentos tradicionais de renda fixa e chegou-se a conclusão que o box pode oferecer rentabilidade extraordinária, sem que isso seja justificado por risco ou falta de liquidez. Esse resultado contraria a hipótese do mercado eficiente, que afirma que os preços de mercado refletem todas as informações disponíveis e, portanto, que não existem oportunidades de ganho com arbitragem. A pesquisa, no entanto, enfrentou dificuldades metodológicas – em {{particular}} a impossibilidade de se garantir que os preços utilizados ocorreram simultaneamente - que podem ter impactado os resultados. Recomenda-se que futuros estudos revisitem o tema com o auxílio de recursos metodológicos mais sofisticados.

The study concludes that the box can offer extraordinary profitability that cannot be explained or justified by risk or illiquidity. This result contradicts the efficient market hypothesis, which states that market prices reflect all available information and therefore there are no arbitrage gain opportunities. The study, however, faced methodological difficulties, specially the impossibility of assuring the prices used in the simulation occurred simultaneously, which might have affected the results.

This study examined the efficiency of European style S&P CNX Nifty Index options of National Stock Exchange, (NSE) India by making use of high-frequency data on put and call options written on Nifty (Time-stamped transactions data) for the time period between 1 st January 2002 and 31 st December 2005 using box-spread arbitrage strategy. The advantages of box-spreads include reduced joint hypothesis problem {{since there is no}} consideration of pricing model or market equilibrium, no consideration of inter-market non-synchronicity since trading box spreads involve only one market, computational simplicity with less chances of mis-specification error, estimation error and the fact that buying and selling box spreads more or less replicates risk-free lending and borrowing. One thousand three hundreds and fifty eight exercisable box-spreads were found for the time period considered of which 78 Box spreads were found to be profitable after incorporating transaction costs (32 profitable box spreads were identified for the year 2002, 19 in 2003, 14 in 2004 and 13 in 2005) The results of our study suggest that internal option market efficiency has improved over the years for S&P CNX Nifty Index options of NSE India...|$|E

40|$|Documenting {{spread and}} {{combination}} trading {{in a major}} options market for the first time, we find that spreads and combinations collectively account for over 55 % of large trades (trades of 100 contracts or more) in the Eurodollar options market and almost 75 % of the trading volume due to large trades. In terms of total volume, the four most heavily traded combinations are (in order) : straddles, ratio spreads, vertical spreads, and strangles. These four represent about two thirds of all combination trades. On the other hand, condors, horizontal spreads, guts, iron flys, <b>box</b> <b>spreads,</b> guts, covered calls or puts, and synthetics are very rarely traded while trading is light in collars, diagonal spreads, butterflies, straddle spreads, seagulls, doubles, and delta-neutral combinations. Significant differences in size, cost, and time-to-expirations are found among the various combination types. Our results confirm that traders use spreads and combinations to construct portfolios which are highly sensitive to some risk factors and much less sensitive to other risk factors. The most popular combination designs are those yielding portfolios which are quite sensitive to volatility and less sensitive to directional changes in the underlying asset value- thoug...|$|R

40|$|It {{is common}} {{practice}} that aging and structurally damaged prestressed concrete bridge members are {{taken out of}} service and replaced. This, however, is not an efficient use of materials and resources since the member can often be repaired in situ. There are numerous repair techniques proposed by entrepreneurial and academic institutions which restore prestressed concrete girder flexural strength and save both material and economic resources. Of course, not all repair methods are applicable in every situation and thus each must be assessed based on girder geometry and {{the objectives of the}} repair scenario. This document focuses on the practical application of prestressed concrete bridge girder repair methods. In this document, repair methods are presented for three prototype prestressed concrete highway bridge girder shapes: adjacent <b>boxes</b> (AB), <b>spread</b> <b>boxes</b> (SB), and AASHTO-type I-girders (IB), having four different damage levels. A total of 22 prototype repair designs are presented. Although not applicable to all structure types or all damage levels, the repair techniques covered include the use of carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) strips, CFRP fabric, near-surface mounted (NSM) CFRP, prestressed CFRP, post-tensioned CFRP, strand splicing and external steel post-tensioning. It is the author's contention that each potential structural repair scenario should be assessed independently to determine which repair approach is best suited to the unique conditions of a specific project. Therefore, no broad classifications have been presented directly linking damage level (or a range of damage) to specific repair types. Nonetheless, it is concluded that when 25 % of the strands in a girder no longer contribute to its capacity, girder replacement is a more appropriate solution. Guidance with respect to inspection and assessment of damage to prestressed concrete highway bridge girders and the selection of a repair method is presented. These methods are described through 22 detailed design examples. Based on these examples, review of existing projects and other available data, a detailed review of selection and performance criteria for prestressed concrete repair methods is provided...|$|R
