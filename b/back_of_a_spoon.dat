6000|$|Only {{when she}} was in the motor car did she {{distinguish}} the three people who were to accompany them. The owner, now at the wheel, was the essence of decent self-satisfaction; a baldish, largish, level-eyed man, rugged of neck but sleek and round of face--face like the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>spoon</b> bowl. He was chuckling at her, [...] "Have you got us all straight yet?" ...|$|E

50|$|Layered {{drinks are}} made by {{floating}} different-colored liqueurs in separate layers. Each liqueur is poured slowly into a glass over the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>spoon</b> or down a glass rod, so that the liquids of different densities remain unmixed, creating a striped effect.|$|E
50|$|Alternatively, {{it may be}} {{prepared}} as a layered drink, with the espresso gently poured (most gently out of a small espresso brew pitcher, over the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>spoon)</b> so that it forms a layer between the denser liquid milk below and the lighter foam above. In this case a glass {{is essential for the}} layers to be visible.|$|E

2500|$|Buttery Nipple: {{equal parts}} butterscotch schnapps and Irish Cream. The Irish cream is poured off the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bar <b>spoon</b> so it [...] "floats" [...] {{on top of}} the schnapps in a shot glass.|$|R
2500|$|Cocksucking Cowboy (also {{called the}} Brokeback Shooter): two parts cold butterscotch schnapps with {{one part of}} Irish Cream, making it 32% ABV.

50|$|A greased {{frying pan}} {{is allowed to}} get very hot. A layer {{of the mixture of}} about 1½ centimeters is put into the pan, {{squeezing}} the borders with the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>spoon.</b> It is cooked for a few minutes, moving the pan so it cooks evenly without burning the center. Using the lid of the pan, flip the mbejú, finishing the cooking the same way as above.|$|E
50|$|Black {{coffee is}} {{poured into the}} mug. Whiskey {{and at least one}} level {{teaspoon}} of sugar is stirred in until fully dissolved. The sugar is essential for floating liquid cream on top. Thick cream is carefully poured over the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>spoon</b> initially held just above the surface of the coffee and gradually raised a little. The layer of cream will float on the coffee without mixing. The coffee is drunk through the layer of cream.|$|E
50|$|A {{portion of}} coffee liqueur (e.g., Tia Maria, Kahlúa or Patrón Cafe) is {{topped by a}} layer of Irish Cream (e.g., Baileys) which is poured over the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>spoon</b> so that it sits on the coffee liqueur. The ratio of coffee liqueur to Irish cream varies but is {{generally}} around 3-to-1. The resulting drink looks like a miniature pint of Guinness stout, with the coffee liqueur as the beer and the Irish cream as the head. It is normally served in a shot glass.|$|E
25|$|Gorilla Fart: pour ¾ ounce (2.25 cl) bourbon, then pour ¾ ounce (2.25 cl) of rum {{over the}} <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bar <b>spoon</b> to create <b>a</b> layered effect. So named {{because of the}} fiery {{sensation}} in the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the throat, especially if Tabasco sauce {{is added to the}} drink, as is also common.|$|R
5000|$|A Cocksucking Cowboy (also {{known as}} a Cowboy and Butterball) is a layered shooter made from one part cold Butterscotch Schnapps with two parts of Baileys Irish Cream, making it 32 proof (16% ABV). The Baileys is poured off the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bar <b>spoon</b> so it [...] "floats" [...] {{on top of the}} schnapps in a shot glass. Some {{alternative}} recipes reverse the proportions, specifying 2 parts Schnapps to 1 part Irish cream.|$|R
5000|$|A Quick Fuck is a layered shooter {{made from}} one part coffee liqueur like Kahlua, one part cold Midori liqueur and one part Baileys Irish Cream. The Baileys is poured off the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bar <b>spoon</b> so it [...] "floats" [...] {{on top of the}} Kahlua in a shot glass. Then slowly layer the Midori on top of the Baileys. Note that Baileys {{does not have to be}} used; any type of Irish Cream will do.|$|R
50|$|Begin {{with the}} lowest proof or {{heaviest}} liqueur on the bottom, then spoon float the next layer drop by drop over the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>spoon.</b> Each layer {{should be at least}} 10 degrees of proof higher than the previous layer. As a general rule, the higher the proof, the lighter the density of the liqueur. The lowest proof goes on the bottom, with the highest proof on the top. Though as many liqueurs as desired can be layered on top of one another, the majority of layered shots only contain three to five different layers.|$|E
5000|$|They {{are made}} from grated sweet potatoes, grated coconut, sugar, flour, coconut milk, and/or water,raisins, ginger, grated nutmeg, salt and essence or vanilla extract. The mixture is {{combined}} in a bowl until it thickly coats the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>spoon.</b> The cooking method is quite simple, but what is often debated is the wrapping. The mixture can be cooked wrapped in foil where others prefer to cook it wrapped in coccoloba leaves, banana leaves, [...] or seaside grape leaves. Either way the wrapped contents must be boiled in salted water for about 25 {{minutes or until the}} mixture in the wrapping is firm.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1950s, {{terms such}} as {{sparkling}} water and seltzer water gained favor. The term seltzer water is a genericized trademark that derives from the German town Selters, which is renowned for its mineral springs. Naturally carbonated water, Selters, has been commercially bottled and shipped from this town since the 18th century or earlier. Generally, seltzer water has no added sodium salts, while club soda still retains some of the sodium salts that once were used. The term [...] "Seltzer water" [...] is virtually unknown in Britain and most Commonwealth countries, although Australians {{of a certain age}} remember Selza Saline powder in metal tins with lids which had to be opened for each use with the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>spoon,</b> sold during the 1950s.|$|E

5000|$|B-52s {{are usually}} {{served in a}} shot glass or sherry glass, {{although}} a heatproof glass is required when a [...] "flaming B-52" [...] is served. First, a coffee liqueur, such as Tia Maria or Kahlúa, is poured into the glass. Next, Bailey's Irish Cream is poured very slowly over the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cold bar <b>spoon,</b> taking care to avoid disturbing the lower layer as the second liquor is poured on top. Just as carefully, Grand Marnier is poured atop the Irish Cream using the bar spoon.|$|R
40|$|We {{know that}} not only a plane mirror {{produces}} <b>an</b> image <b>of</b> <b>an</b> object in front <b>of</b> it ??? <b>a</b> convex spherical mirror does, too! Just look at the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> metal <b>spoon</b> if you don't believe it! This interactive animation shows you how such an image arises, and how its position and size can be found. Use your mouse to move the object, the candle, along the optical axis, and observe how the position and size of its image change. You can also explore how the image is constructed, by turning {{on and off the}} principal rays. These are the three special rays that are used for the construction of the image. The first one is parallel to the optical axis and is therefore called the P-ray. It is reflected as if it came from {{the focal point of the}} mirror. The second one is the one that goes through the center of the sphere, the C-ray, which is reflected back into itself. The third is the F-ray, which would go through the focal point and is reflected parallel to the optical axis. The image of the tip of the candle is the point where these rays meet (or seem to meet) after they were reflected. It might not come as a surprise that the image of the candle is actually located behind the convex mirror, so it's a virtual image. The reflected rays to not actually meet at the position of the image, they just emerge from the mirror as if they came from there. Of course, that's the same as with a plane mirror. But you'll notice that there is also a difference: the image <b>of</b> <b>a</b> plane mirror is the same size as the object, while for a convex mirror, the image is always smaller than the object.

5000|$|A common {{misconception}} is that Coandă {{effect is}} demonstrated when {{a stream of}} tap water flows over the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>spoon</b> held lightly in the stream and the spoon is pulled into the stream (for example, Massey in [...] "Mechanics of Fluids" [...] uses the Coandă effect to explain the deflection of water around a cylinder). While the flow looks {{very similar to the}} air flow over the ping pong ball above (if one could see the air flow), the cause is not really the Coandă effect. Here, because it is a flow of water into air, there is little entrainment of the surrounding fluid (the air) into the jet (the stream of water). This particular demonstration is dominated by surface tension. (McLean in [...] "Understanding Aerodynamics" [...] states that the water deflection [...] "actually demonstrates molecular attraction and surface tension.") ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{simplest}} {{method is}} to put the ground coffee in a cup, pour hot water over it and let cool while the grounds sink to the bottom. This is a traditional method for making a cup of coffee that is still used in parts of Indonesia. This method, known as [...] "mud coffee" [...] in the Middle East owing to an extremely fine grind that results in a mud-like sludge {{at the bottom of the}} cup, allows for extremely simple preparation, but drinkers then have to be careful if they want to avoid drinking grounds either from this layer or floating at the surface of the coffee, which can be avoided by dribbling cold water onto the [...] "floaters" [...] from the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>spoon.</b> If the coffee beans are not ground finely enough, the grounds do not sink.|$|E
50|$|The {{cream is}} made by {{whipping}} egg yolks and sugar together until the yolk is almost white, and then slowly adding hot milk, while whisking. This process is {{commonly referred to as}} tempering. Vanilla beans (seeds) may be added for extra flavour and visual appeal. The sauce is then cooked over low heat (excessive heating may cause the yolks to cook, resulting in scrambled eggs) and stirred constantly with a spoon until it is thick enough to coat the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>spoon,</b> and then removed from the heat. It is also possible to set the sauce into custard cups and bake in a bain-marie until the egg yolks set. If the sauce reaches too high a temperature, it will curdle, although it can be salvaged by straining into a container placed in an ice bath. Cooking temperature should be between 70 °C (156 °F) and 85 °C (185 °F); the higher the temperature, the thicker the resulting cream, as long as the yolks are fully incorporated into the mixture.|$|E
