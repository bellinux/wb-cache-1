A mechanic recommended that the engine anti-icing system be used, but no maintenance was performed on the aircraft in Anchorage.

5000|$|... 6077 {{was built}} in 1944 as part of order of twenty {{locomotives}} classified U-1-f. These 4-8-2 or Mountain Type locomotives were built instead of the larger more typical 4-8-4 or Northern Type. The Northern type locomotives are larger and required more steel to make and during World War II a smaller more adaptable engine for general uses were needed. The U-1-f class locomotives were built in 1944 by Montreal Locomotive Works, and were numbered between 6060 and 6079. The series of engines were nicknamed <b>Bullet</b> <b>Nosed</b> Betty for their definitive nose cone.|$|R
50|$|The smallest-caliber gun {{also had}} a Broadwell drum feed {{in place of the}} curved box of the other guns. The drum, named after L. W. Broadwell, an agent for Gatling's company, {{comprised}} twenty stacks of rounds arranged around a central axis, like the spokes of a wheel, each holding twenty cartridges with the <b>bullet</b> <b>noses</b> oriented toward the central axis. This invention was patented in U. S. 110,338. As each stack emptied, the drum was manually rotated to bring a new stack into use until all 400 rounds had been fired. A more common variant had 240 rounds in twenty stands of fifteen.|$|R
50|$|A wadcutter has a flat {{or nearly}} flat front that is {{typically}} {{as wide as}} the caliber size or only slightly smaller in diameter than caliber size. For target shooting, a wadcutter cuts a very clean hole through the paper target, making it easier to score and ideally reducing errors in scoring the target in the favor of the shooter. Because the flat nosed bullet is not well suited for feeding out of a magazine, wadcutters are normally used only in revolvers or in specially designed semi-automatic pistols, although this is not always the case as some wadcutters may have rounded <b>bullet</b> <b>nose</b> profiles.|$|E
5000|$|Also {{used are}} bullets similar to hollowpoint bullets or soft point bullets whose cores and/or jackets are {{deliberately}} weakened to cause deformation or fragmentation upon impact. The Warsaw Pact 5.45×39mm M74 assault rifle round exemplifies {{a trend that}} is becoming common {{in the era of}} high velocity, small caliber military rounds. The 5.45×39mm uses a steel-jacketed bullet with a two-part core, the rear being lead and the front being steel with an air pocket fore most. Upon impact, the unsupported tip deforms, bending the <b>bullet</b> <b>nose</b> into a slight [...] "L" [...] shape. This causes the bullet to tumble in the tissue, thus increasing its effective frontal surface area by traveling sideways more often than not.|$|E

5000|$|Because {{many of the}} rifles {{that are}} {{chambered}} for the [...]22 WMR have tubular magazines, the <b>bullet</b> <b>noses</b> generally are flat or at least blunt to allow smooth feeding and reduce damage to the bullet.

5000|$|Twelve J class {{locomotives}} {{were converted}} to oil burning and reclassified as JB class, and the <b>bullet</b> <b>nose</b> streamlining was gradually removed. In 1962 ten J were transferred back to the South Island to replace the A class on the steep Greymouth-Otira section and another 6 Js were transferred in the mid 1960s to the SIMT.

The first reboilered J was used on the Otira route while the rest were reboilered in 1967. J 1236 was refitted with JA 1281's boiler, and second NI JA boiler was approved for refitting to a J in mid 1967, 2 spare JA boilers were supplied with the delivery of the boilers, from North British, Glasgow for the last 10 JA to Hillside in 1953-54 and there was some swapping of boilers between JAs 1240 receiving JA 1255 boiler and J 1200 driving wheels in 1966 [...] The three J engines that were used with the JA class on the South Island Limited in its last years in 1969-70 and later preserved were effectively a new 'JC' class with JA boilers and North Island JA tenders, reconstructed for coal rather than oil supply and had North Island JA trailing trucks, under the cab. The original J had been mainly freight and banking engines on the NIMT and had only powered a few provincial passenger trains, the Opua Express, the Auckland- New Plymouth night express and the Tanetua express. J 1211 and J1234 with JA 1267 were the usual engines on the fast South Island Limited on the Christchurch-Oamaru section, in its last year, their 'JC' conversion having made them NZRs final mainline steam flyers.|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} paper, the {{penetration}} experiments of tungsten-fiber/metallic-glass matrix composite material bullets into 45 # steel targets are conducted by employing H 25 artillery. In which, an experimental technique of sub-caliber penetration is constructed. The quasi static and dynamic behaviours of tungsten-fiber/metallic-glass matrix composite material are also experimental investigated. The self-sharpening phenomenon of composite material is observed. Integrated with metallographic analysis, the failure modes of tungsten-fiber/metallic-glass matrix composite material are identified systemically and {{compared with the}} quasi-static and dynamic material tests. It includes four failure modes, i. e., shear fracture of tungsten fiber, brittle fracture of tungsten fiber and shear fracture of metallic glass matrix as well as melting of tungsten fiber and metallic glass matrix. Comparatively, three failure mechanisms of tungsten fiber in the <b>bullet</b> <b>nose</b> are also identified, i. e., shear fracture, splitting fracture and bending or/and buckling.

40|$|In this paper, {{some of the}} {{important}} defeating mechanisms of the high hardness perforated plates against 7. 62 x 54 armor piercing ammunition were investigated. The experimental and numerical results identified three defeating mechanisms effective on perforated armor plates which are the asymmetric forces deviates the bullet from its incident trajectory, the bullet core fracture and the bullet core nose erosion. The initial tests were performed on the monolithic armor plates of 9 and 20 mm thickness to verify the fidelity of the simulation and material model parameters. The stochastic nature of the ballistic tests on perforated armor plates was analyzed based on the bullet impact zone with respect to holes. Various scenarios including without and with bullet failure models were further investigated to determine the mechanisms of the bullet failure. The agreement between numerical and experimental results had significantly increased with including the bullet failure criterion and the <b>bullet</b> <b>nose</b> erosion threshold into the simulation. As shown in results, good agreement between Ls-Dyna simulations and experimental data was achieved and the defeating mechanism of perforated plates was clearly demonstrated...|$|E
40|$|In 21 st century ultra {{high end}} {{technologies}} are being experimented for defense applications. The guided bullet {{is an example}} for such an experiment, which has become research topic across several countries. The guided missiles technology has got matured over years of research. Similar to that a guided bullet when fired from the gun changes its direction according to the target’s movements. That is if the target is moving then the fired bullet will also change its path to hit the target finally. The principle of the whole design of intelligent bullet is based on receiving the LASER echo and adjusting the nose accordingly. The high power laser diode emits a pulsed light through the control of FPGA. Then, QD (four quadrant detector) receives the echo of the light and output of different current {{as a result of}} different spot area in four photosensitive surfaces; after the current from the four quadrant detector is converted into voltage signal and filtering, it is digitized with ADCs. The ADC outputs will be FPGA based control loop. According to the 4 position signals, the bullet motion will be controlled. In this project the digital section of this system will be prototyped in VHDL and will be synthesized to Xilinx Spartan family FPGA. The simulated data will be used to test the control loop implementation. The control signals for altitude control will be issued when ever altitude adjust is required. The control system outputs drive signals for four drivers A, B, C and D which corresponds to the moment of <b>bullet</b> <b>nose.</b> A test platform with FPGA board emulated in MATALB environment will be used to demonstrate the results...|$|E
