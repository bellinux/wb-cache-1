The surface shape <b>of</b> <b>propeller</b> blade is very complex, {{and it is difficult to}} be described by general mathematical expressions, so that the modeling <b>of</b> <b>propeller</b> is very cumbersome and error-prone. To solve this problem, firstly, three-dimensional point data <b>of</b> <b>propeller</b> blade is calculated by VC/MFC programming technology and access technology of database based on projection principle <b>of</b> <b>propeller</b> blade. And then, automation and parameterization of solid modeling for <b>propeller</b> <b>of</b> different map forms are realized by programming with the interactive programming language of UG/Open Grip based on UG software. The parametric modeling system provides accurate three-dimensional model for automatic programming, dynamic simulation and numerical analysis <b>of</b> <b>propeller,</b> and improves the design efficiency <b>of</b> systematic <b>propeller,</b> and has very good practical value...|$|R

40|$|Purpose. The study involves: 1) {{formation}} <b>of</b> 3 D <b>propeller</b> models under study; 2) studying of {{the effect}} of profiling the blade <b>of</b> the <b>propeller</b> on its hydrodynamic characteristics; 3) development of a methodology for specifying optimal project parameters for modeling the operation <b>of</b> a <b>propeller</b> in free water, which in the future could be recommended when simulating similar tasks in the CFD package Flow Vision. Methodology. The technology <b>of</b> design <b>of</b> <b>propellers</b> <b>of</b> new series was developed. For the first time, the project methodology was proposed in the CFD package Flow Vision for studying the operation <b>of</b> a <b>propeller</b> in free water. Findings. On the example of solving a practical problem for studying the influence of blade profiling on the efficiency <b>of</b> a <b>propeller,</b> the expediency <b>of</b> developing the proposed methodology for setting a propeller design in the CFD package Flow Vision is justified. The using of this technique makes it possible to obtain reliable values <b>of</b> the <b>propeller</b> hydrodynamic characteristics for constructing its action curves, and also to reduce the estimated time. This approach makes it possible to optimize the process <b>of</b> designing <b>propellers.</b> Originality. Through numerous experiments and based on the analysis of the obtained results, {{it was found that the}} profiling <b>of</b> the <b>propeller</b> mainly affects its hydrodynamic characteristics. The choice and calculation <b>of</b> the <b>propeller</b> for the projected vessel occurs in the early stages of design. Therefore, the rationale for choosing one or another geometry <b>of</b> the marine <b>propeller</b> is a topical task. A method for specifying project parameters for conducting numerical experiments in studying the operation <b>of</b> <b>propellers</b> in free water was proposed and justified. Thus, it is possible to design not only the serial screws, but also the new series propellers, minimizing the costs of carrying out the research along with the reliability of the resulting calculation results. Practical value. Authors established that the influence <b>of</b> the <b>propeller</b> blade profiling on its hydrodynamic characteristics is greater than the influence of its other general and blade characteristics. The developed design methodology for the calculation <b>of</b> <b>propellers</b> in the CFD package Flow Vision can be used to design the marine <b>propellers</b> <b>of</b> both new series and existing ones, and also in the case of optimizing the shape <b>of</b> the <b>propeller</b> to ensure the greatest efficiency.

40|$|The {{propeller}} is {{the predominant}} propulsion device used in ships. The performance <b>of</b> <b>propeller</b> is conventionally represented {{in terms of}} non-dimensional coefficients, i. e., thrust coefficient (K T), torque coefficient (K Q) and efficiency and their variation with advance coefficients (J). It {{is difficult to determine}} the characteristics <b>of</b> a full-size <b>propeller</b> in open water by varying the speed of the advance and the revolution rate over a range and measuring the thrust and torque <b>of</b> the <b>propeller.</b> Therefore, recourse is made to experiments with models <b>of</b> the <b>propeller</b> and the ship in which the thrust and torque <b>of</b> the model <b>propeller</b> can be conveniently measured over a range of speed of advance and revolution rate.
