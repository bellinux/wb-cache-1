5|$|On March 2, 2015, CBS Television Distribution and Judge Sheindlin {{extended}} their contract {{for another three}} seasons, adding to her current contract (which was set to expire after the 2016–17 season), meaning it will <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> until at least the 2019–20 season. Judge Judy is especially popular among female viewers {{between the ages of}} 25 and 54.|$|E
25|$|In 1949, {{the station}} {{suffered}} {{what could have}} been a crippling blow; the collapse of its main antenna at the Bloomingdale transmitter site. WMAQ was able to <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> but not at its normal 50,000 watt power. While the main antenna was out of service, NBC found a solution with some history to it to get WMAQ back broadcasting at full power. RCA had a tower in storage in one of its New Jersey facilities that was used as part of its 1939 New York World's Fair exhibit. The tower, which originally came from NBC's WTAM in Cleveland, was shipped to Chicago and became the acting main antenna; it stands today at Bloomingdale. The station launched a new main antenna tower at Bloomingdale in 1951, which was considered to be one of the tallest structures in the US at the time.|$|E

25|$|On August 6, 2010, the CBC {{issued a}} press release stating that due to {{financial}} reasons, the CBC and Radio-Canada would only transition 27 transmitters total, one in each market where there was an originating station (i.e. a CBC or Radio-Canada television station located in that market). Further, the CBC stated in the release, that only 15 of the transmitters would be in place by August 31, 2011 {{due to lack of}} available funds, and that the remainder would not <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> until as late as August 31, 2012. Additionally, the CBC stated in the release that it was asking the CRTC for permission to continue broadcasting in analogue until the identified transmitters for transition were up and running. At the time of the press release, only eight of the corporation's transmitters (four CBC and four Radio Canada) were broadcasting in digital.|$|E
500|$|I'd gone to CBS, and I'd become {{convinced}} Beverly Hillbillies {{was going}} to work. Bill Paley wasn't convinced. Bill has this great sense of propriety. Putting aside the Sarnoffs {{and all the other}} great names of broadcasting, Paley stood– stands– head and shoulders above everyone else. He had this blasting genius of instinctively looking at a show and knowing if it should <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b> He could also be ruthless and distant ... But Bill was intuitive about both the business and creative sides of TV. And he genuinely disliked Beverly Hillbillies. I put it on the schedule anyway.|$|E
500|$|Jane Krakowski, {{who plays}} Jenna Maroney, {{revealed}} to Entertainment Weeklys Michael Ausiello her character's plot in which Jenna becomes a television producer {{as part of}} her contract as TGS begins its fifth season. [...] " [...] has all these wacky things built into her contract , because nobody thought we'd still <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b> So I get to be a producer." [...] Series producer Paula Pell reprised her role as Paula Hornberger, the wife of Scott Adsit's character Pete Hornberger. The episode references the ongoing storyline of Liz's desire to become a mother when she tells Carol that she is on a waiting list to adopt a child. This story first began in the show's first season, and continued in the third season.|$|E

50|$|During the thirty-one {{weeks that}} Caesars Challenge <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> <b>the</b> show {{employed}} two different bonus games. Both involved unscrambling words within {{a time limit}} but were conducted in different fashions.|$|R

2500|$|Many {{contests}} {{employ a}} concept of [...] "off time" [...] in which a station may operate {{only a portion of}} the available time. [...] For example, the ARRL November Sweepstakes is thirty hours long, but each station may <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> for no more than twenty-four hours. [...] The off-time requirement forces competitive stations to decide when to <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> making contacts and when to be off the air, and adds a significant element of strategy to the competition. [...] Although common in the 1930s, {{only a small number of}} contests today take place over multiple weekends. [...] These competitions are called [...] "cumulative" [...] contests, and are generally limited to the microwave frequency bands. [...] Short [...] "sprint" [...] contests lasting only a few hours have been popular among contesters that prefer a fast-paced environment, or who cannot devote an entire weekend to a radio contest. [...] A unique feature of the North American Sprint contest [...] is that the operator is required to change frequency after every other contact, introducing another operational skills challenge. [...] Whatever the length of the contest, the top operators are frequently those that can best maintain focus on the tasks of contest operating throughout the event.|$|E
2500|$|Regarding the {{relationship}} between Francesa and Russo, Francesa said, [...] "It was an arranged marriage and almost a quickie divorce." [...] Russo admitted that such a proposition of breaking up between the two would have been celebrated in 1992. [...] However, Russo said in an interview, [...] "I think that, in the long term, the station sees us as a tandem and {{would not want to}} break the brand up... And to tell you the truth, after almost 20 years together, Mike and I are like a married couple: It would be too hard to leave him. I never thought I would hear myself say this, but it would feel very strange to <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> without him." ...|$|E
2500|$|NBC {{executive}} Warren Littlefield said in July 1994 {{that the}} network would probably never air the pilot if Simpson were convicted; if he were acquitted, however, one television journalist speculated that [...] "Frogmen would probably <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> before the NBC peacock could unfurl its plume". Most pilots that are two hours long are aired as TV movies {{whether or not they}} are ordered as series. Because—as the Los Angeles Times later reported—"the appetite for all things O.J. appeared insatiable" [...] during the trial, Warner Bros. and NBC estimated that a gigantic, Super Bowl-like television audience would have watched the Frogmen film. One of Simpson's co-stars in the film commented that the studio's decision not to air it or even release it on home video, and forego an estimated $14million in profits, was [...] "just about the only proof you have that there is some dignity in the advertising and television business".|$|E

2500|$|On June 25, 2003, Marty Ingels, a voice actor, {{called into}} Leykis's show {{and tried to}} {{challenge}} him on moral grounds. Ingels, who was much older than the typical caller to Leykis's show, was subjected to some rude remarks by the call screener {{who said that he}} was too old and should not <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b> But Ingels was placed on the air, and Leykis also disparaged Ingels, stating [...] "you're not just older than my demographic, you're the grandfather of my demographic". Leykis explained that he didn't want older callers because he was selling advertising aimed at younger listeners. Ingels sued the show for age discrimination. Ingels's first lawsuit got dismissed by an anti-SLAPP statute (...) that protected against lawsuits that protects First Amendment rights and another judge claimed that the show had the right to control its content. Further, it was noted that Ingels could not really complain he was discriminated against because his call was in fact put on the air. As for Ingels, the actor was ordered to pay $25,000 in attorney's fees to Leykis.|$|E
2500|$|Stern {{wished to}} be in radio {{at the age of}} five. He was an {{infrequent}} listener in his youth, but names talk personalities Bob Grant and Brad Crandall as early influences. His father set up a microphone, tape machine and turntable in the basement of his home which Stern used to record his own make believe radio shows, incorporating different characters and pre-recorded prank calls, sketches, and commercials. He made several visits to his father's recording studio and witnessed [...] "some of the great voice guys" [...] work with him, including Don Adams and Larry Storch voice Tennessee Tuxedo and His Tales, which began his desire to <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> and [...] "do a show", rather than play records. In the late 1960s, Roosevelt became a predominantly black area; Stern remembered just [...] "a handful of white kids" [...] had remained in his school and repeated instances of bullying from black pupils. In June 1969, the family moved to nearby Rockville Centre, and Stern, at age fifteen, transferred to South Side High School where he became [...] "a total introvert". He graduated from the school in 1972; his year book lists Stern's sole student activity, a membership in Key Club.|$|E
