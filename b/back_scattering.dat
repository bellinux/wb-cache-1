25|$|Especially {{due to the}} {{presence}} of the ground, there are some differences in propagation (and also in reflections responsible for TV ghosting) between horizontal and vertical polarizations. AM and FM broadcast radio usually use vertical polarization, while television uses horizontal polarization. At low frequencies especially, horizontal polarization is avoided. That is because the phase of a horizontally polarized wave is reversed upon reflection by the ground. A distant station in the horizontal direction will receive both the direct and reflected wave, which thus tend to cancel each other. This problem is avoided with vertical polarization. Polarization is also important in the transmission of radar pulses and reception of radar reflections by the same or a different antenna. For instance, <b>back</b> <b>scattering</b> of radar pulses by rain drops can be avoided by using circular polarization. Just as specular reflection of circularly polarized light reverses the handedness of the polarization, as discussed above, the same principle applies to scattering by objects much smaller than a wavelength such as rain drops. On the other hand, reflection of that wave by an irregular metal object (such as an airplane) will typically introduce a change in polarization and (partial) reception of the return wave by the same antenna.|$|E

40|$|A {{dissipative}} scale-similarity subgrid {{model was}} recently proposed {{in which only}} the dissipative part of the subgrid stresses {{was added to the}} momentum equations. This was achieved by adding the gradient of a subgrid stress only when its sign agreed with that of the corresponding viscous term. In the present work, this idea is used the other way around as forcing in hybrid large eddy simulation-Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes: only the part of a subgrid stress term that corresponds to <b>back</b> <b>scatter</b> is added to the momentum equations. The forcing triggers resolved turbulence in the transition region between the unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes and large eddy simulation regions. The new approach is evaluated for fully developed channel flow at Re(tau) = 4000. It is found that the forcing indeed does increase the resolved turbulence in the transition region. The magnitude of the production (i. e. <b>back</b> <b>scatter)</b> due to forcing in the equation for resolved kinetic energy is of the order of that due to the usual strain-rate production term.

50|$|Assuming no {{scattering}} {{and ideal}} (transparent) contacts, the conductance of the one-dimensional system {{is given by}} G = G0NT, where T is the probability that an electron will be transmitted along the channel, N {{is the number of}} the channels available for transport, and G0 is the conductance quantum 2e2/h = (12.9kΩ)−1. Perfect contacts, with reflection R = 0, and no <b>back</b> <b>scattering</b> along the channel result in transmission probability T = 1 and the conductance of the system becomes G = (2e2/h) N. Thus each channel contributes 2G0 to the total conductance.For metallic armchair nanotubes, there are two subbands, which cross the Fermi level, and for semiconducting nanotubes - bands which don’t cross the Fermi level. Thus there are two conducting channels and each band accommodates two electrons of opposite spin. Thus the value of the conductance is G = 2G0 = (6.45 kΩ)−1.|$|E
50|$|A carbon nanotube’s bandgap is {{directly}} affected by its chirality and diameter. If those properties can be controlled, CNTs would be a promising candidate for future nano-scale transistor devices. Moreover, {{because of the lack}} of boundaries in the perfect and hollow cylinder structure of CNTs, there is no boundary scattering. CNTs are also quasi-1D materials in which only forward scattering and <b>back</b> <b>scattering</b> are allowed, and elastic scattering mean free paths in carbon nanotubes are long, typically on the order of micrometers. As a result, quasi-ballistic transport can be observed in nanotubes at relatively long lengths and low fields.Because of the strong covalent carbon-carbon bonding in the sp2 configuration, carbon nanotubes are chemically inert and are able to transport large amounts of electric current. In theory, carbon nanotubes are also able to conduct heat nearly as well as diamond or sapphire, and because of their miniaturized dimensions, the CNTFET should switch reliably using much less power than a silicon-based device.|$|E
