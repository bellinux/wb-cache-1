5|$|This {{increase}} in permeability primarily affects transport of ions and other hydrated species, {{indicating that the}} mechanism {{is the creation of}} nm-scale water-filled holes in the membrane. Although electroporation and dielectric breakdown both result from application of an electric field, the mechanisms involved are fundamentally different. In dielectric breakdown the <b>barrier</b> <b>material</b> is ionized, creating a conductive pathway. The material alteration is thus chemical in nature. In contrast, during electroporation the lipid molecules are not chemically altered but simply shift position, opening up a pore that acts as the conductive pathway through the bilayer as it is filled with water.|$|E

Scientists at Kellex attempted to design a production-scale facility to produce Uranium-235 for the atomic bomb.

30|$|The ASTM and UFAC {{tests are}} {{commonly}} used {{in the development and}} quality control assessment of <b>barrier</b> <b>materials.</b> For non-woven, highloft battings, quality control measures generally include the measurement of weight, thickness, uniformity, and a burn test (draft proposed TB 117 (10)). These tests are qualitative, with specific guidelines for assessing fire performance of the <b>barrier</b> <b>materials.</b> Since fire <b>barrier</b> <b>materials</b> are generally expected to be self-extinguishing, other test methods for such materials include measurements of the time of afterflame and afterglow and the extent of fire damage in terms of char length, hole size or weakened sample length.|$|R

Due to relatively high crystallinity, in combination with the ability of the nanofibers to form a dense network held together by strong inter-fibrillar bonds (high cohesive energy density), {{it has been suggested that}} nanocellulose might act as a <b>barrier</b> <b>material.</b> Although the number of reported oxygen permeability values are limited, reports attribute high oxygen barrier properties to nanocellulose films. One study reported an oxygen permeability of 0.0006 (cm3µm)/(m2daykPa) for a ca. 5µm thin nanocellulose film at 23°C and 0% RH. In a related study, a more than 700-fold decrease in oxygen permeability of a polylactide (PLA) film when a nanocellulose layer was added to the PLA surface was reported.|$|E
