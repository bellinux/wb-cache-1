6000|$|That {{night we}} were not yet {{regularly}} organised for watching, so that {{the early part of}} the evening showed an unevenly <b>balanced</b> <b>guard.</b> Nurse Kennedy, who had been on duty all day, was lying down, as she had arranged to come on again by twelve o'clock. Doctor Winchester, who was dining in the house, remained in the room until dinner was announced; and went back at once when it was over. During dinner Mrs. Grant remained in the room, and with her Sergeant Daw, who wished to complete a minute examination which he had undertaken of everything in the room and near it. At nine o'clock Miss Trelawny and I went in to relieve the Doctor. She had lain down for a few hours in the afternoon so as to be refreshed for her work at night. She told me that she had determined that for this night at least she would sit up and watch. I did not try to dissuade her, for I knew that her mind was made up. Then and there I made up my mind that I would watch with her--unless, of course, I should see that she really did not wish it. I said nothing of my intentions for the present. We came in on tiptoe, so silently that the Doctor, who was bending over the bed, did not hear us, and seemed a little startled when suddenly looking up he saw our eyes upon him. I felt that the mystery of the whole thing was getting on his nerves, as it had already got on the nerves of some others of us. He was, I fancied, a little annoyed with himself for having been so startled, and at once began to talk in a hurried manner as though to get over our idea of his embarrassment: ...|$|R

40|$|When {{drafting}} the Constitution, the Framers implemented a structural system {{of checks and}} <b>balances</b> to <b>guard</b> against the executive tyranny they had experienced under British rule. During the Vietnam War many in Congress perceived the executive branch as over-reaching, and in response they passed the War Powers Resolution of 1973, which was an attempt to place a procedural check on executive power. This Note examines changes in the technology and actors involved in modern warfare against the scope of the Resolution. The 2011 conflict in Libya is presented as a specific example to demonstrate that modern warfare has evolved outside the scope of the Resolution. Based on the assumption that war powers should be balanced between the executive and legislative branches, this Note argues for new war powers legislation that is more broad and flexible in scope to accommodate the evolution of war...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the assessment of an experimental setup for grinding experiments with a top wheel speed of 250 m/s. Among other considerations, high speed grinding is widely considered as a way for enhancing material removal rates by utilising large depths of cut and/or high workspeeds. Performing high speed grinding operations, however, presents challenges to the setup due to the high wheel speeds involved. An experimental setup was established in this study for high speed grinding of hardened nodular cast iron and steel using vitrified CBN wheels. This setup was assessed prior to grinding for wheel <b>balancing</b> and <b>guarding,</b> wheel core expansion and temperature rise, grinding fluid delivery, and idle power consumptions. It was found that high speed wheel rotations caused wheel expansion and temperature rise. A significant portion of the total power was consumed on actions other than material removals. The preliminary grinding tests indicated that the setup met the requirements for high speed grinding in general. Copyright 9 2013 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

40|$|Restricted until 03 May 2013. Long before today’s {{sometimes}} rancorous {{debates about}} faith and science, European theologians struggled {{to reconcile the}} two. During the later Middle Ages, religious thinkers increasingly drew on naturalistic explanations {{of the world to}} explain supernatural phenomena. Nichole Oresme (1320 – 1382), philosopher and theologian at the University of Paris, councilor to King Charles V of France, and bishop of Lisieux, wrote a series of treatises warning that natural or medical causes caused false religious visions. His investigations, and those of his students and followers, explicitly challenged older assumptions about the relation between asceticism, holiness, and visionary experience so familiar to medieval Christians. Oresme’s influence did not lead to a suppression of visionary practice but instead transformed late medieval and early modern religious visionary experiences and explanations for them. Preachers no longer blamed demons for all religious delusions, but instead bad diet and poor health. By assimilating medical ideas about human illness and perceptual error, theologians created a new mode of Christian pious conduct, encouraging greater emotional restraint and purposeful physiological <b>balance</b> to <b>guard</b> against false visions. Along the way, they shaped developing debates about what is lost and what is gained when religious communities modernize their beliefs and practices...|$|R
5000|$|With the {{introduction}} of the 1908 sword, however, the era of the compromise design was over. The 1908 sword was purely optimized for thrusting. The skewer-like blade had a thick [...] "T" [...] cross-section, much narrower but thicker than a traditional blade design making it far stiffer in the “weak” axis for a given weight so as to resist buckling in the thrust. The blade ended in a sharp [...] "spear" [...] point. The large, sheet steel bowl guard gave considerable protection to the hand. The rounded rectangular section chequered grip was of a semi-pistol configuration. Although not as extreme as modern fencing pistol or orthopedic grips, this design caused the blade to naturally align with the arm when the arm was extended, in position for a charge using the point. A thumb stop was indented on top of the grip, just behind the guard. The large pommel helped to keep the point of balance of the sword close to the <b>guard,</b> <b>balancing</b> the sword for its length.|$|R
5000|$|Martin was {{a soldier}} in the Visitor armed forces with the rank of Lieutenant and the secret leader of the Earth Visitor Fleet's Fifth Column network during the First Invasion. He {{remained}} undercover as Diana's most trusted aide. During the invasion, Martin befriended Mike Donovan, who inspired him into mobilising the Fifth Column into openly attacking Diana's supporters. Though Martin was forced to escape from the LA Mothership when Donovan (under the truth serum's influence) exposed him, he remained connected to the spreading Fifth Column network. He {{and the rest of his}} group helped a Resistance assault team captured the LA Mothership and disarm its Doomsday Device while the Red Dust was deployed on Earth's surface. Martin then piloted the Resistance-controlled Mothership back to Earth victorious. One year after Liberation Day, Martin and Donovan are news partners; Martin acts as Donovan's sound operator and has to constantly take antidote pills to ward off Red Dust exposure. When Diana was supposedly [...] "assassinated", Martin and Donovan pursued her to a shack in the woods guarded by Ham Tyler's agents. Martin knocked Donovan out with the camera and, with a hidden laser pistol, overpowered the guards and was poised to kill Diana, but he was knocked off <b>balance</b> by another <b>guard</b> and Diana stole his weapon. Diana forced him to surrender his last antidote pill and the names of every Fifth Column agent remaining in the Fleet before setting the shack on fire and escaping. Martin was critically injured in the fire while escaping. With mere minutes to live, Martin told a now-conscious Donovan of Diana's intent to return with the Fleet and asks him one last favor of his best friend, to kill Diana. Martin died in Donovan's arms. It is later revealed that virtually no-one in the Visitor Fleet knows the truth that Martin was a Fifth Column leader and how he really died. The official story, by Diana, was that Martin bravely attempted to [...] "rescue" [...] Diana from human security forces and was killed [...] "getting her to freedom". Martin's place as leader of the Fifth Column was succeeded by his twin brother, Philip.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this project}} is to {{evaluate}} an alternative screening strategy using liquid- based cytology (LBC), and supplementary detection of human papillomavirus (HPV) in cases of minor cytological abnormalities (atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance, ASCUS, and low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, LSIL). Within population-based screening in Stockholm, Sweden, we alternated screening using LBC with supplementary HPV testing in ASCUS and LSIL (LBC+HPV testing, using Linear Array HPV genotyping Assay, Roche diagnostics) and conventional cytology (CC), from September 2005 to December 2006. LBC+ HPV testing (n= 6075) and CC (n= 4261) screening performance were compared. LBC+ HPV testing was evaluated over time (September 2005 - December 2007). Diagnostic performance of HR-HPV detection as a triage test to identify high-grade precancerous lesions (CIN 2 +) in cases of ASCUS and LSIL was assessed, and age-specific HPV prevalence was studied. To assess the cost-effectiveness of HPV triage compared with immediate colposcopy or repeated cytology as a follow-up strategy for ASCUS and LSIL, an economic analysis was carried out {{from the perspective of}} the Swedish healthcare system, based on data from previous studies. Comparing LBC+ HPV testing with CC, the adjusted OR for detecting CIN 2 + and CIN 3 + were 0. 89 (95 % CI: 0. 64 - 1. 25) and 1. 02 (95 % CI: 0. 67 - 1. 54) respectively. Detection of CIN 2 + improved significantly over time for both methods. Positive predictive values were similar between methods for all endpoints. High-risk (HR-) HPV was found in 71 % of LSIL and 49 % of ASCUS cases (p= 0. 001) with similar prevalence between groups in women > 30 years. HR-HPV prevalence was age- dependent in LSIL (p= 0. 01), with decreasing prevalence until age 50 years, followed by a slight increase. The negative predictive value of HR-HPV detection for histologically confirmed high-grade lesions was 100 %. For women with ASCUS > 30 years, HPV triage is the least costly alternative, whereas immediate colposcopy with biopsy provides the most effective option at a modest additional cost. No obvious advantages of the LBC+ HPV testing strategy over CC were shown. However, detection of high-grade precancerous lesions improved significantly over time for both strategies. This finding suggests that introduction of LBC+ HPV testing may have lead to general improvement of expertise and increased vigilance in cytological interpretation. Observed changes underscore the importance of continuously monitoring rates of abnormal cytology to ensure <b>balance</b> and to <b>guard</b> against overdiagnosis or overconfidence in cytological evaluation. By using HPV reflex testing, additional extensive workup can safely be avoided in about 50 % of all cases of ASCUS and LSIL among women ≥ 30 years. With highly sensitive HPV testing techniques at lower costs, HPV triage could become a cost-effective alternative. Cervical cancer screening will need to continuously adapt as HPV-vaccinated women reach screening ages and new potentially superior screening strategies are identified...|$|R
40|$|This {{internship}} {{report is}} submitted in a partial {{fulfillment of the}} requirements for the degree of Master of Business Administration, 2015. Cataloged from PDF version of Internship report. Includes bibliographical references (page 51). BRAC Bank Limited {{is one of the}} latest generations of scheduled commercial banks in Bangladesh. It was founded in Bangladesh under the Banking Companies Act, 1991 and incorporated as private limited company on 20 May 1999 under the Companies Act, 1994. BRAC Bank Limited started its Journey on the 4 th of July 2001 with a vision to be the absolute market leader through providing the entire range of banking services suitable to the needs of modern and dynamic banking business as well as to promote broad based participation in the Bangladesh economy through the provision of high quality banking services. BRAC Bank Limited, with institutional share holdings by BRAC and International Finance Corporation (IFC) has been the fastest growing Bank in 2004 and 2005. BRAC Bank is extending full range of banking facilities as per the directives of Bangladesh Bank. It intends to set standards as the absolute market leader in Bangladesh by providing efficient, friendly and modern fully automated on-line service on a profitable basis. As a leading SME based bank BRAC Bank is to maintain large portfolio. It also follows & maintains Bangladesh Bank’s regulation and instruction to continue its daily operations. Treasury & FI Operations plays a vital role in this context. SLR stands for Statutory Liquidity Reserve, which is maintaining 19 % of bank’s Average Total Demand and Time Liability with Central Bank. It means of each 100 Taka deposit from customers we have to keep 19 Taka as SLR and we have to maintain it by mixing different portfolio instruments following Central bank directives. Of 19 % SLR requirement, 5. 5 % is CRR or Cash Reserve Ratio for daily requirement & 6 % average for fortnightly mandatory requirement. SLR can be maintained with Treasury Bills, Treasury Bonds, Foreign Currency Balance with Central Bank, Cash balance in hand, Cash balance with Sonali Bank - agent of Central Bank and CRR is maintained with cash balance with Central Bank. SLR has direct correlation with Asset Liability Management (ALM) of Bank. ALM monitors, measures and manages the risks associated with <b>balance</b> sheet and <b>guard</b> the bank against any unforeseen loss or threat of survival. Now, the question should come how SLR & ALM has the linked up. It is nothing but the tools of Central Bank by fix the standard AD Ratio. AD ratio means advance to deposit ratio. It helps to judge bank’s liquidity position. In ideal scenario, AD ratio should be around 81 %, as 19 % of deposit is maintained as SLR. AD ratio might also go above 81 % considering bank’s capital, deposit base, contingency liquidity support window and overall depth of money market etc. At present, Standard AD Ratio is 85 % for Bank set by Central Bank. Treasury, to comply all the above regulatory factors, is performing their day to day task which is nothing but the goal of every organization - making money by minimizing risks. That’s why; they are called the heart of every bank like Bank is treated as the life-blood of the modern economy. Treasury is the bank’s fund manager and they are the prime profit center of every bank. The dimension of the department is they are dealing simultaneously in the Money Market, Capital Market, Securities market as well as Foreign Exchange Market. And, most importantly, the Head of Treasury of every bank is the Chairman of ALCO (Asset Liability Committee). The focus of the study is to analyze the Portfolio Mix of SLR (Statutory Liquidity Requirement) of Treasury & FI Operations of BRAC Bank Limited. Md. Abdur RahimM. Business Administratio...|$|R
