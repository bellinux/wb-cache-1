This transition control close to the laminar separation is possible by enforcing transition on the upper surface either directly by means of spanwise rows of three-dimensional roughness elements, bleed or suction holes, or indirectly by means of destabilizing the upper surface boundary layer by means of backward facing surface steps, two-dimensional or zig-zag tapes or weak <b>boundary</b> <b>layer</b> <b>blowing.</b> Pneumatic turbulators {{are found to be}} advantageous because they can be adjusted to different external flow conditions better than mechanical ones...|$|E

In a sensitivity experiment with the radiative effect of liquid clouds south of the equator over the eastern Pacific artificially removed, <b>boundary</b> <b>layer</b> clouds south of the equator almost disappear and precipitation in the ITCZ is reduced by 15 %– 20 %, indicating that the stratocumulus clouds over the southeast Pacific have both local and cross-equatorial effects.

In response to this cloud-induced cooling, an in situ anomalous high pressure system develops in the <b>boundary</b> <b>layer</b> and an anomalous shallow meridional circulation develops in the lower troposphere over the equatorial eastern Pacific.

The overall process of reducing the heat flux experienced by the heat shield's outer wall {{by way of a}} <b>boundary</b> <b>layer</b> is called blockage. Ablation occurs at two levels in an ablative TPS: the outer surface of the TPS material chars, melts, and sublimes, while the bulk of the TPS material undergoes pyrolysis and expels product gases.

Pyrolysis can be measured in real time using thermogravimetric analysis, so that the ablative performance can be evaluated. [...] Ablation can also provide blockage against radiative heat flux by introducing carbon into the shock layer thus making it optically opaque.

40|$|Active {{flow control}} {{methods have been}} widely studied {{for more than a}} decade in order to improve the airfoil's efficiency. This study is focused on fluidic {{actuation}} (the addition or subtraction of momentum to/from the <b>boundary</b> <b>layer</b> by <b>blowing</b> and/or sucking fluid). A synthetic jet is a very particular type of fluidic actuation that involves periodic blowing and suction with zero-net-mass-flow over a the full period. Its success as an active flow control device has been extensively reported by several authors. As it can be seen synthetic jet technology provides good results on <b>boundary</b> <b>layer</b> reattachment and therefore, an improvement on the airfoil's efficiency. What is more, is a generic system that can be widespread on multiple types of airfoils such as unmanned aerial vehicles and conventional airplanes airfoils. The effectiveness of control in mitigating boundary separation depends on a number of parameters related both to the flow itself and the control input such as: frequency and amplitude of the excitation, the excitation shape, exit diameter and cavity shape. Since the synthetic jet system has several degrees of freedom and the flux is unpredictable, multiple simulations have to be done in order to assess the best configuration to achieve the maximum airfoil's efficiency. The well-known excitation of the synthetic jet is the zero-net-mass-flow that combines both expulsion and suction periodically. In this study, we also evaluate other types of excitations that imply more or less energy into the system that is characterized with the momentum coefficient. The goal is to assess thoroughly this existent trade-off between the aerodynamics performance and the momentum coefficient. And finally, extract deep conclusions and assess the best synthetic jet configuration where the aerodynamics performances are improved with a low momentum coefficient [...] To extract suitably conclusions we pass through a thorough and intricate process that starts with the adapted and generic discretized surface for the synthetic jet that we use to solve the Navier-Stokes equations, then the appropriate conversions to simulate with spectral element framework Nektar++ and finally the detailed extraction of results.

For this purpose ADV velocity measurements {{were made at}} 16 different distances along the channel mid section for four different flow conditions. Both experimental and theoretical methods implemented in the computation of <b>boundary</b> <b>layer</b> thickness. <b>Boundary</b> <b>layer</b> thicknesses were determined using Matlab codes which work based on the von Karman integral momentum method. Theoretical method gives high <b>boundary</b> <b>layer</b> thickness and small <b>boundary</b> <b>layer</b> development length values. The <b>boundary</b> <b>layer</b> development varies between 30 to 65 times of the water depth for all flow conditions...|$|R
