50|$|The ICT {{sector in}} Kazakhstan is overregulated, as {{evidenced}} by some 300 legislative acts that expressly or implicitly control the ICT environment. All telecommunications operators are legally obliged, {{as part of the}} licensing requirement, to connect their channels to a public network controlled by KazakhTelecom. The so-called <b>Billing</b> <b>Center</b> of Telecommunication Traffic, established by the government in 1999, helps monitor the activity of private companies and strengthen the monopolist position of KazakhTelecom in the IT sphere. In the past, some telecommunications operators circumvented such regulations by using VoIP for their interregional and international traffic, but the imposition of VoIP telephony tariffs eliminated this option.|$|E

40|$|Advanced {{metering}} infrastructure (AMI) {{of smart}} grid requires bidirectional communication for transferring data to <b>billing</b> <b>center,</b> for which WiFi {{is an attractive}} choice. However, WiFi operates in the unlicensed bands and LTE needs to offload data in the same unlicensed band. Recent release of 3. 5 GHz (also termed as citizen broadband radio service (CBRS)) can be an attractive shared band where LTE and WiFi can coexist. In our study, we propose a fixed duty cycled LTE-U and WiFi based smart grid metering infrastructure where smart meter uses WiFi and data collector (termed as Access Point (AP)) of smart meters uses LTE for transferring data. We investigate the coexistence performance of LTE-WiFi in the 3. 5 GHz band using a time division duplexing (TDD) LTE confederated by WiFi along with FTP traffic model for system level simulation. The simulation results demonstrate a good neighboring coexistence between LTE and WiFi resulting a candidate AMI architecture for smart grid in the 3. 5 GHz band.

40|$|The {{industry}} has recognized {{the risk of}} cyber- attacks targeting to the advanced metering infrastructure (AMI). A potential adversary can modify or inject malicious data, and can perform security attacks over an insecure network. Also, the network operators at intermediate devices can reveal private information, such as {{the identity of the}} individual home and metering data units, to the third-party. Existing schemes generate large overheads and also do not ensure the secure delivery of correct and accurate metering data to all AMI entities, including data concentrator at the utility and the <b>billing</b> <b>center.</b> In this paper, we propose a secure and privacy-preserving data aggregation scheme based on additive homomorphic encryption and proxy re-encryption operations in the Paillier cryptosystem. The scheme can aggregate metering data without revealing the actual individual information (identity and energy usage) to intermediate entities or to any third-party, hence, resolves identity and related data theft attacks. Moreover, we propose a scalable algorithm to detect malicious metering data injected by the adversary. The proposed scheme protects the system against man-in-the-middle, replay, and impersonation attacks, and also maintains message integrity and undeniability. Our performance analysis shows that the scheme generates manageable compu- tation, communication, and storage overheads and has efficient execution time suitable for AMI networks...|$|E
