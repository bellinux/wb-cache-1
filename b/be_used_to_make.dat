500|$|The {{coconut tree}} (Cocos nucifera) {{found in most}} {{regions of the country}} is called [...] "Kalpavriksha", as every part of it is useful in one way or the other. The coconut water inside the nut is a delicious drink. In dried form it is called copra and <b>is</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> {{manufacture}} oil. The coconut husk, called coir, <b>is</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> rope. Leaves <b>are</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> huts, fans, mats. Palm sugar is made from budding flower.

5|$|Screening devices {{based on}} diamond type {{detection}} can <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> {{a distinction between}} diamonds that are certainly natural and diamonds that are potentially synthetic.

Examples of commercial screening devices are D-Screen (WTOCD / HRD Antwerp) and Alpha Diamond Analyzer (Bruker / HRD Antwerp).|$|E
5|$|Important {{information}} could be gained regarding {{the properties of}} superheavy nuclei by the synthesis of more livermorium isotopes, specifically those with a few neutrons {{more or less than}} the known ones – 286Lv, 287Lv, 288Lv, 289Lv, 294Lv, and 295Lv. This is possible because there are many reasonably long-lived isotopes of curium that can <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a target. The light isotopes can be made by fusing curium-243 with calcium-48. They would undergo a chain of alpha decays, ending at transactinide isotopes that are too light to achieve by hot fusion and too heavy to be produced by cold fusion.|$|E
5|$|Liquid {{crystals}} find wide use {{in liquid}} crystal displays, which {{rely on the}} optical properties of certain liquid crystalline substances in {{the presence or absence}} of an electric field. In a typical device, a liquid crystal layer (typically 4 μm thick) sits between two polarizers that are crossed (oriented at 90° to one another). The liquid crystal alignment is chosen so that its relaxed phase is a twisted one (see Twisted nematic field effect). This twisted phase reorients light that has passed through the first polarizer, allowing its transmission through the second polarizer (and reflected back to the observer if a reflector is provided). The device thus appears transparent. When an electric field is applied to the LC layer, the long molecular axes tend to align parallel to the electric field thus gradually untwisting in the center of the liquid crystal layer. In this state, the LC molecules do not reorient light, so the light polarized at the first polarizer is absorbed at the second polarizer, and the device loses transparency with increasing voltage. In this way, the electric field can <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a pixel switch between transparent or opaque on command. Color LCD systems use the same technique, with color filters used to generate red, green, and blue pixels. Chiral smectic liquid crystals are used in ferroelectric LCDs which are fast-switching binary light modulators. Similar principles can <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> other liquid crystal based optical devices.|$|E

5|$|The {{fruit of}} Ficus aurea is edible and <b>was</b> <b>used</b> for food by the {{indigenous}} people and early settlers in Florida; it is still eaten occasionally as a backyard source of native fruit. The latex <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a chewing gum, and aerial roots may have <b>been</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> lashings, arrows, bowstrings and fishing lines. The fruit <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a rose-coloured dye. F. aurea <b>was</b> also <b>used</b> in traditional medicine in The Bahamas and Florida. Allison Adonizio and colleagues screened F. aurea for anti-quorum sensing activity (as a possible means of anti-bacterial action), but found no such activity.|$|R

5|$|Lithium, sodium, and {{potassium}} have many applications, while rubidium and caesium are very useful in academic contexts {{but do not}} have many applications yet. Lithium is often used in batteries, and lithium oxide can help process silica. Lithium stearate is a thickener and can <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> lubricating greases; it is produced from lithium hydroxide, which {{is also used to}} absorb carbon dioxide in space capsules and submarines. Lithium chloride is used as a brazing alloy for aluminium parts. Metallic lithium is used in alloys with magnesium and aluminium to give very tough and light alloys.|$|E
5|$|Many welding {{processes}} {{require the use}} of a particular joint design; for example, resistance spot welding, laser beam welding, and electron beam welding are most frequently performed on lap joints. Other welding methods, like shielded metal arc welding, are extremely versatile and can weld virtually any type of joint. Some processes can also <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> multipass welds, in which one weld is allowed to cool, and then another weld is performed on top of it. This allows for the welding of thick sections arranged in a single-V preparation joint, for example.|$|E
5|$|Tephrosia apollinea {{is known}} to be toxic to goats. Although it has been used in Oman to treat bronchitis, cough, earache, nasal {{congestion}} and wounds and bone fractures, as of 1993 its wider impact on humans had not been assessed. It can <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> indigo dyes, and the leaves and those of other plants are used to make hot drinks by the Bedouin in parts of Sinai and the Negev.|$|E

5|$|The Fat Man {{plutonium}} bombs used explosive {{compression of}} plutonium to obtain significantly higher densities than normal, {{combined with a}} central neutron source to begin the reaction and increase efficiency. Thus only 6.2kg of plutonium was needed for an explosive yield equivalent to 20 kilotons of TNT. Hypothetically, as little as 4kg of plutonium—and maybe even less—could <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a single atomic bomb using very sophisticated assembly designs.|$|E
5|$|Horse meat {{has been}} used as food for humans and {{carnivorous}} animals throughout the ages. It is eaten {{in many parts of the}} world, though consumption is taboo in some cultures, and a subject of political controversy in others. Horsehide leather {{has been used}} for boots, gloves, jackets, baseballs, and baseball gloves. Horse hooves can also be used to produce animal glue. Horse bones can <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> implements. Specifically, in Italian cuisine, the horse tibia is sharpened into a probe called a spinto, which is used to test the readiness of a (pig) ham as it cures. In Asia, the saba is a horsehide vessel used in the production of kumis.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{developed}} as a method to detect flaws or irregularities in magnetic materials, magnetic particle inspection {{can be used on}} firearms to visualize the serial number underneath the obliterated area. When performing this technique, examiners place the weapon in a magnetic field. The irregularities in the metal, in this case the serial number, cause the field to deform. When a solution of ferrous particles is added to the weapon's magnetized surface they will be attracted to the area where the magnetic field has deformed and will build up in the area. If fluorescent particles are added to the ferrous solution, ultraviolet light can <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it easier to visualize any recovered serial number.|$|E
