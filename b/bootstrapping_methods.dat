In Sweden there are about 900 000 companies and small businesses represent about 99 percent of these companies. The fact that small businesses are having difficulty obtaining outside financing is a widely discussed subject because financing is of great importance to small business survival and growth, to drive economic growth and to create new jobs in the community. To overcome the challenges {{it is important that}} companies find new creative solutions to obtain the necessary resources they need to operate the business. This alternative financial system is called financial bootstrapping and is a strategy to finance companies through the use of methods that avoid companies to raise equity capital or borrow money. The study aims to create a deeper understanding of financial <b>bootstrapping</b> <b>methods</b> in small growth companies by: (1) describe the financial <b>bootstrapping</b> <b>methods</b> that small growth companies may use, (2) identify underlying factors for the use of financial <b>bootstrapping</b> <b>methods</b> in small growth companies, (3) identify how the use can be expressed in small growth companies development and (4) to develop a model of financial bootstrapping in small growth companies. We have made a qualitative study consisting of interviews with small growth companies in Sweden. The assumption that financial <b>bootstrapping</b> <b>methods</b> occurs primarily at the beginning or when companies have difficulty obtaining capital tends to be inconsistent with our results, as small growth companies are using financial <b>bootstrapping</b> <b>methods</b> repeatedly during the company's development.

We ex-amined the performance of two supertree <b>bootstrapping</b> <b>methods</b> on four published data sets that each include sequence data from more than 100 genes. In "input tree bootstrapping, " input gene trees are sampled with replacement and then combined in replicate supertree analyses; in "stratified bootstrapping, " trees from each gene's separate (conventional) boot-strap tree set are sampled randomly with replacement and then combined. Generally, support values from both supertree bootstrap methods were similar or slightly lower than corresponding bootstrap values from a total evidence, or superma-trix, analysis.

40|$|In recent years, small {{businesses}} have received much attention from {{policy makers and}} researchers, in that these businesses are considered important for economic growth and job creation. At the same time {{small businesses}} are assumed to face major problems in securing long-term external finance, which is regarded as restraining their development and growth. Small business managers are assumed to use institutional finance {{as a means of}} meeting the need for resources, and as a consequence the major part of the research on small business finance has focused on constraints in the supply of institutional (market) finance. As we see it, most small business managers handle the need for resources using means other than external finance by applying different kinds of financial <b>bootstrapping</b> <b>methods.</b> Financial bootstrapping refers to the use of methods for meeting the need for resources without relying on long-term external finance from debt holders and/or new owners. However, these other means of resource acquisition have, with few exceptions, not been focused on within earlier research on small business finance. Against this background, {{the purpose of this study}} is to describe small business managers' use of different financial <b>bootstrapping</b> <b>methods,</b> and, more importantly, to develop concepts that can help us better understand small business managers' financial bootstrapping behaviors. The research process was initiated with a number of unstructured interviews conducted with small business managers, accountants, consultants, bank officials, and researchers, in order to identify different financial bootstrapping possibilities. On the basis of the interviews and an earlier study on financial bootstrapping, resulting in the identification of 32 <b>bootstrapping</b> <b>methods,</b> a questionnaire was constructed and sent to 900 small business managers in Sweden. Given the limited knowledge within the area of financial bootstrapping, the study is based on explorative factor analysis and cluster analysis. From the cluster analysis six clusters of bootstrappers were identified, differing from each other with respect to the <b>bootstrapping</b> <b>methods</b> used and the characteristics of the business. On the basis of this information the different clusters were labeled: (1) delaying bootstrappers; (2) relationship-oriented bootstrappers; (3) subsidy-oriented bootstrappers; (4) minimizing bootstrappers; (5) non-bootstrappers; and (6) private owner-financed bootstrappers. The groups of financial bootstrappers show differences in their orientation toward resource acquisition, representing different aspects of an internal mode of resource acquisition, a social mode of resource acquisition, and a quasi-market mode of resource acquisition. We find that the delaying bootstrappers, private owner-financed bootstrappers, and minimizing bootstrappers all represent an internal mode of resource acquisition. The relationship-oriented bootstrappers follow a socially oriented mode of resource acquisition, whereas the subsidy-oriented bootstrappers apply quasi-market oriented resource acquisition. This study contributes to our empirical understanding by providing knowledge about the financial <b>bootstrapping</b> <b>methods</b> used in small businesses. Furthermore, by developing concepts this study contributes to the conceptual development of our knowledge about financial bootstrapping. The implication of this study is that financial bootstrapping is a phenomenon which deserves more attention in future research on small business finance. At the same time, financial bootstrapping behavior is probably a more general phenomenon, appearing in different contexts, such as R&D activities in large businesses, financing start-ups, etc. Finally, the study points out implications for small business managers, consultants, teachers, etc. Practitioners often tend to focus on market solutions to resource needs. This study shows, however, that this strong focus can be questioned. Resources needed in small businesses can in many situations be secured using financial <b>bootstrapping</b> <b>methods,</b> referring to internally oriented and socially oriented resource acquisition strategies...|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of companies {{relies on the}} availability of resources. This {{has proved to be a}} significant barrier for smaller companies because it is harder for them to get access to venture capital and long-term loans compared to larger companies. Consequently, smaller companies seek alternative solutions to meet financing needs. An alternative is financial bootstrapping, which may constitute a key resource in companies with resource limitations, and thus acts as a substitute to other resource procurement methods. In accordance with the resource-based theory a company´s social and human capital constitutes important resources that can affect the acquisition of resources through financial bootstrapping. The purpose of this study is to theoretically develop and empirically test a model of financial bootstrapping by describing the use of financial bootstrapping and explain how social and human capital may influence the use of financial <b>bootstrapping</b> <b>methods</b> in small and large cities. A web-based questionnaire was sent out to 1 200 small companies located in small and large cities. The result from the 145 completed questionnaires from large and small cities were then compared against each other by regression analysis. The result show that bootstrapping methods; owner financing, minimizing account receivable, and subsidy finance differ in the level of use, depending on whether the company was located in small or large cities. Independent of company location remaining methods was used in the similar extent. The results present social capital as important to provide resources through financial <b>bootstrapping</b> <b>methods.</b> Remaining methods did not show any significant correlations between the social capital’s; weak and strong ties and the use of <b>bootstrapping</b> <b>methods</b> in companies located in small and large cities.

40|$|Today, {{many small}} {{businesses}} are experiencing problems with obtaining long-term external financing. Financial bootstrapping refers to methods used by small businesses to obtain resources, without relying on long-term external financing from debtholders and/or new owners. Instead financing of resources occur in alternative ways. This {{has been found to}} have a great importance for the development and survival of small businesses. Financial bootstrapping is commonly used among small businesses and there are a wide variety of methods to use. Since financial bootstrapping plays a crucial role of SMEs, there is an interest to investigate what influences decisions regarding the choice of bootstrapping method, which in turn can help small businesses to make more informed decisions. This study aims to theoretically develop and empirically test a model for the selection of financial bootstrapping by describing the use of financial bootstrapping in small business and test how underlying factors affects the choice of bootstrapping method. The study has a quantitative research method with a hypothetical-deductive approach in which a web-based survey was sent to a total of 1, 554 small businesses in the manufacturing industry. The results showed that when the owner perceives that the company's financial position is good, the use of the financial bootstrapping decreases, with the largest decrease occurring specifically for the internally oriented <b>bootstrapping</b> <b>methods.</b> Selection of financial bootstrapping method is also affected by how much resources the owner perceive that there is in the environment. If the owner perceive that there a wide array of resources in the environment, the use of the internally oriented <b>bootstrapping</b> <b>methods</b> decreases.

A stronger relationship with contacts in the social network leads to the socially oriented <b>bootstrapping</b> <b>methods</b> being used to a greater extent.
