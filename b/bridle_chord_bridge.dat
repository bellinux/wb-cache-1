50|$|In 2007, as {{businesses}} {{closed and}} properties were bought up by developers, {{a master plan}} was commissioned for the neighborhood. Today Romema is Jerusalem's transportation hub: The Jerusalem Central Bus Station and <b>Chords</b> <b>Bridge</b> are located there, and a new high-speed railway terminus is being built opposite the bus station.|$|R
50|$|After Haft Square, {{the road}} travels between the neighborhoods of Kiryat Moshe and Kiryat HaLeom, passing nearby the Kiryat Moshe Interchange of Highway 50 (Begin Expressway).

50|$|The {{first line}} of the Jerusalem Light Rail network was {{completed}} in 2010 with the erection of Santiago Calatrava's <b>Chords</b> <b>Bridge</b> over Jaffa Road. The first line began operating from Pisgat Ze'ev in the northeast, through French Hill and Jaffa Road to the Central Bus Station and the southwestern neighborhoods. The line was fully operational by late 2011, after several delays, with 14 trains and a maximum headway of 12 minutes.|$|R
25|$|The <b>Chords</b> <b>Bridge</b> is a {{cantilever}} spar {{cable-stayed bridge}} {{designed by the}} Spanish architect and engineer Santiago Calatrava, built for the light rail, close to {{the most frequently used}} entrance to Jerusalem, in the neighborhood of Kiryat Moshe. The bridge carries the trams in a grade separated manner over a busy road intersection. Incorporated in the bridge is a glass-sided pedestrian crossing, enabling pedestrians to cross unimpeded from the Kiryat Moshe area to the Central Bus Station grounds. The bridge, which cost about $70 million (NIS 246 million), was inaugurated on June 25, 2008.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Chords</b> <b>Bridge</b> (גשר המיתרים, Gesher HaMeitarim), {{also called}} the Bridge of Strings or Jerusalem Light Rail Bridge, is a side-spar {{cable-stayed}} bridge in Jerusalem, Israel. The structure was designed by the Spanish architect and engineer Santiago Calatrava and is used by Jerusalem Light Rail's Red Line, which began service on August 19, 2011. Incorporated in the bridge is a glass-sided pedestrian bridge enabling pedestrians to cross from Kiryat Moshe to the Jerusalem Central Bus Station.

50|$|The cello {{may have}} 3 gut or nylon strings and the chords are plucked rapidly, {{often with a}} unique skipped-beat using the thumb and one finger. This {{instrument}} then adds both rhythm and tone. The guitar may play similarly to either cak or cuk, but plays are often extended scalar runs that provide an undulating background to a <b>chord</b> or <b>bridge</b> <b>chord</b> changes. The bass is often played in a minimalist style reminiscent of the large gongs in a gamelan.|$|R
25|$|Far {{more radical}} in its structure, the Puente del Alamillo (1992) uses a single {{cantilever}} spar {{on one side}} of the span, with cables on one side only to support the bridge deck. Unlike other cable-stayed types, this bridge exerts considerable overturning force upon its foundation and the spar must resist the bending caused by the cables, as the cable forces are not balanced by opposing cables. The spar of this particular bridge forms the gnomon of a large garden sundial. Related bridges by the architect Santiago Calatrava include the Puente de la Mujer (2001), Sundial <b>Bridge</b> (2004), <b>Chords</b> <b>Bridge</b> (2008), and Assut de l'Or Bridge (2008).|$|R

It runs from Pisgat Ze'ev in north-east Jerusalem, south along Road 1 (intercity) to Jaffa Road (Rehov Yaffo). From there, it runs along Jaffa Road westward to the Jerusalem Central Bus Station, and continues to the southwest, crossing the <b>Chords</b> <b>Bridge</b> along Herzl Boulevard to the Beit HaKerem neighborhood, finishing just beyond Mount Herzl at {{the northern edge of}} Bayit VeGan. The first test run for this route was on February 24, 2010. The laying of the railroad tracks was completed on June 15, 2010.|$|R

The Edah HaChareidis ordered all Haredi businesses to close during the funeral, and Litvishe Torah leaders Rabbi Yosef Shalom Eliashiv and Aharon Leib Shteinman instructed teachers and students of Talmud Torahs, yeshivas, and kollels to join the funeral procession. The procession blocked {{the entrance to the}} city and halted operations of the Jerusalem Light Rail, as tens of thousands of mourners blocked the tracks on the Jerusalem <b>Chords</b> <b>Bridge</b> en route to the cemetery.|$|R

In this test, the rotating down procedure of the construction was simulated and studied, possible closure errors were tested and corresponding measures are proposed, and the mechanical performances at key stages of construction and service were examined. Plentiful experimental data and some new knowledge about the <b>chorded</b> arch <b>bridge</b> were obtained from this test, which provided reliable technical guarantee for the actual construction...|$|R
50|$|The side-spar {{principle}} {{is not limited}} to a straight bridge, however. The tower could be offset and the bridge deck wrap around the spar in an arc, e.g., <b>Chords</b> <b>Bridge</b> in Jerusalem. Such a bridge would be particularly suited for use in the confines of a canyon, where the road is brought in the upstream direction down one side, crosses a stream, and turns back to a downstream direction on the other side. By placing {{a large portion of the}} turn on the bridge, rather than on the approaches, the turn may be made more gentle, allowing faster traffic. This would require more torsional (twisting) rigidity in the roadbed than would a straight bridge. A bridge of this type (supported by a spar), traveling through a much smaller arc, was one of the original proposals for the eastern span replacement of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge. Similar bridges, without the spar, could be supported by cables anchored in the canyon walls (where conditions are suitable).|$|R

50|$|The {{chains are}} {{suspended}} 2 metres (6 ft 6 in) beneath each bottom <b>chord</b> of the <b>bridge</b> and tensioned after building, by pulling the reinforcing posts into the vertical position. This creates a fully reinforced structure.|$|R
5000|$|Chord {{reinforcement}} [...] - These {{are constructed}} {{in the same way}} as the <b>chords</b> of the <b>bridge</b> panels and are bolted to the panels to increase the bending capacity of the bridge. For the LSB a heavy chord reinforcement is used.|$|R
50|$|The {{song was}} {{originally}} {{recorded in the}} key of G major and has two contrasting sections. The verse sections consist of a cycle of G Bm C and D chords. The <b>chords</b> for the <b>bridge</b> section are Em Bm C G Bm Em Am D.|$|R
50|$|Bridge {{had strong}} pacifist convictions, {{and he was}} deeply {{disturbed}} by the First World War, after which his compositions, beginning in 1921-24 with the Piano Sonata, were marked by a radical change in musical language. The <b>Bridge</b> <b>chord</b> is fairly dissonant, containing seconds {{as well as two}} tritones.|$|R
5000|$|For guitars, {{some players}} feel that smaller radii (7.25-10") are more {{comfortable}} for chord and rhythm playing, while larger radii (12"-16" [...] and up to flat) are better for fast soloing. Conical and compound radius fingerboards try to merge both these features. The nut end of the fingerboard has a smaller radius to ease in forming <b>chords.</b> The <b>bridge</b> end of the fingerboard has a larger radius to make soloing more comfortable and prevent [...] "noting out" [...] ("fretting out"), in which a string comes in contact with a higher fret during bends.|$|R
5000|$|The {{bridge was}} built in 1894 on the site where there had {{previously}} been a wooden bridge, and spans 31 ft. The top cords of the pony truss are pipes 5.75 in in diameter, with doubled iron rods functioning as the truss's bottom <b>chord.</b> The <b>bridge</b> originally had wooden stringers, which were at some point replaced by iron ones. The wooden floor of the bridge is also a replacement. The bridge is accessible on foot. [...] It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000.|$|R

50|$|A new {{master plan}} for the city will see many {{high-rise}} buildings, including skyscrapers, built in certain, designated areas of downtown Jerusalem. Under the plan, towers will line Jaffa Road and King George Street. One of the proposed towers along King George Street, the Migdal Merkaz HaYekum, is planned as a 65-story building, {{which would make it}} one of the tallest buildings in Israel. At the entrance to the city, near the Jerusalem <b>Chords</b> <b>Bridge</b> and the Central Bus Station, twelve towers rising between 24 and 33 stories will be built, as part of a complex that will also include an open square and an underground train station serving a new express line between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, and will be connected by bridges and underground tunnels. Eleven of the skyscrapers will be either office or apartment buildings, and one will be a 2,000-room hotel. The complex is expected to attract many businesses from Tel Aviv, and become the city's main business hub. In addition, a complex for the city's courts and the prosecutor's office will be built, as well as new buildings for Central Zionist Archives and Israel State Archives. The skyscrapers built throughout the city are expected to contain public space, shops, restaurants, and entertainment venues, and it has been speculated that this may lead to a revitalization of downtown Jerusalem. In August 2015, the city council approved construction of a 344-foot pyramid-shaped skyscraper designed by Daniel Libeskind and Yigal Levi, in place of a rejected previous design by Libeskind; it is set to break ground by 2019.|$|R
50|$|The lower <b>chords</b> of the <b>bridge,</b> at 16 by 18 in by 126 ft, {{are among}} the longest timbers ever used in an Oregon bridge. Timbers of this size {{simplified}} some aspects of construction but required special techniques to finish and position at the site. Other features of the bridge include ribbon windows under the eaves, a side window on one side, and semi-elliptical arched portals.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Bridge</b> <b>chord</b> is a bitonal chord {{named after}} {{its use in}} the music of {{composer}} Frank Bridge (1879-1941).
