Acceptance test levels are set with margin expected flight/operations levels and qualification test levels are set above the expected operation levels to check for the survivability of DC brush motor in space. Performance testing is important to design and integration in a planned test process in which DC brush motor were tested under actual or simulated mission profile environments to disclose design deficiencies and to provide information on failure modes and mechanisms. Statistical models are helpful in this process. The Logistic Regression Model is the commonly used parametric statistical models {{and is one of}} the statistical techniques that are used for analyzing and predicting performance with binary outputs. The objective was to develop Logistic Regression Model and is designed to examine the categorization of dependent variables in the quantitative analysis for the performance of DC brush motor. The work carried out demonstrates the development of the Logistic Regression Model for performance prediction of the DC <b>brush</b> <b>motors</b> for deploying unfurlable antenna. The methodology includes performance test data and transforming the dependent variables into binary digits. And to estimate the probability of success of DC brush motor.

This paper adds value to the decision making process through statistical validation using Logistic Regression Model. This Model helps the decision makers in qualifying the components based on performance tests. The Model developed shows the working condition of motor can said to be good since the model fit is good.

40|$|DC <b>brush</b> <b>motors</b> {{have several}} qualities which make them very {{attractive}} for space flight applications. Their mechanical commutation {{is simple and}} lightweight, requiring no external sensing and control in order to function properly. They are extremely efficient in converting electrical energy into mechanical energy. Efficiencies over 80 % are not uncommon, resulting in high power throughput to weight ratios. However, the inherent unreliability and short life of sliding electrical contacts, especially in vacuum, have driven previous programs to utilize complex brushless DC or the less efficient stepper motors. The Mars Surveyor Program (MSP' 98) and the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) have developed a reliable "long life" brush type DC motor for operation in low temperature, low pressure CO 2 and N 2, utilizing silver-graphite brushes. The original intent was to utilize this same motor for SRTM's space operation, but the results thus far have been unsatisfactory in vacuum.

40|$|<b>Brush</b> <b>motors</b> {{have been}} {{qualified}} and flown successfully on Mars missions, but upcoming missions require longer life and higher power. A test program was therefore undertaken {{to identify the}} best brush material for operation in Mars atmosphere. Six different brush materials were used in 1 8 identical motors and operated under various load conditions {{for a period of}} four weeks in low-pressure C 02. All motors performed acceptably, with accumulated motor revolutions between 98 and 144 million revolutions, depending on load. A proprietary silver-graphite material from Superior Carbon (SG 54 - 27) appears to be the best choice for long life, but even the stock copper-graphite brushes performed reliably with acceptable wear. The motors from the C 0 2 test were then cleaned and run in vacuum for 2 weeks. The difference in results was dramatic, with 5 motors failing catastrophically and wear rates increasing by orders of magnitude for the SG 54 - 27 material. Three brush materials survived the test with no failures: SG 54 - 27 with a proprietary Ball Aerospace impregnation, a silver-graphite-molybdenum disulfide material from Superior Carbon (SG 59), and a copper sulfide-graphite material also from Superior Carbon (BG 91) ...|$|E
40|$|The work {{concerns}} the constructive characteristics optimization of brushless D. C. (direct current) motors used in electromechanical spacecraft drives. The spacecraft electromechanical drives and units use rather widely the brushless D. C. motors {{in which a}} motor commutator is replaced with more reliable semiconductor commutator controlled by the rotor position sensors. However, these motors are of low power. Electrohydraulic actuators (EHA) use simple permanent-magnet motors (PMM) of rather high power and commutator motors with graphite brush variable contacts. High reliability of <b>brush</b> <b>motors,</b> and, therefore a reliability of EHA in general, substantially depends {{on the quality of}} motor commutator operation. There are different reasons for a possible impact on the normal motor commutator operation. One of them is brush wear. Sparking brushes and burning commutator bars are possible in case brushes are poorly grinded to fit, brushes cannot freely move true in the brush holder box, and in case an incorrect force to clamp brushes to the commutator is chosen. It is established that drive wear resistance and operability depends on the gas environment composition being under sealed motor housing. In dry nitrogen environment brush wear suddenly raises because of the changing tribological performances of the commutator thus leading to essentially falling isolation resistance and no motor start. It is recommended to fill a space under sealed motor housing with air. Positive experience of operating spacecraft device containers with mobile electromechanical couples allowed us to find that in this case a dew point of filled air must be minus 20 ˚C. The paper offers an electromechanical alternative of design to the electrohydraulic actuators, with a ball-screw gear of the actuation mechanism, possessing a number of advantages. </p...|$|E

40|$|The primary {{objective}} of ice core drilling is {{to obtain the}} highest quality core while minimizing the effort needed. This requires a control system with precision control and convenient operation. An intermediate-depth portable ice core drilling system designed and constructed at the Byrd Polar Research Center (BPRC) has been tested during four expeditions under different working conditions. Several design options were tested to both control and monitor performance of the winch, thermal and electro-mechanic drills. An attempt {{has been made to}} develop a universal controller that can be used with either thermal or electro-mechanical drills and with various power sources, ranging from a conventional alternating current (AC) portable generator, custom high voltage direct current (DC) generator or an array of solar panels. Currently, controller system built in two configurations : (1) to operate a 500 m winch, dry hole electro-mechanical (EM) drill and fluid electro-thermal (ET) drill at low (1 kW) power, and (2) to operate a 500 m winch, EM and ET drills at high power (400 Vdc and 6. 0 kW). To allow the use of different power sources and different drills a modular design was chosen. The control system includes three modules : (1) for measuring and indicating drill depth, drill rate, and cable tension, (2) for driving reversible winch and drill motors at the same time (225 Vdc, 2. 25 kW), and (3) for driving a high power (400 Vdc, 20 kW) drill or winch motor. The controllers are built around industrial servo-amplifiers (SA) for DC <b>brush</b> <b>motors</b> and have over-voltage and over-current protection. This design permits convenient positioning of each module on the winch frame. This paper describes the details of the design and functional options of an ice drill control system...|$|E
40|$|Motor control {{applications}} such as semiconductor manufacturing machines, robotic arms, electric vehicles, hard-disk drives and home appliances, can be found everywhere. In the past, direct current (DC) <b>brush</b> <b>motors</b> are used extensively for various applications due to the ease of speed and position control. However, the mechanical commutation brushes of DC motors require periodical maintenance, cannot operate in high speed regions and cannot sustain high voltage and high current. With the help of advanced control algorithms, efficient power electronic converters and powerful digital signal processors, all DC motors can now be replaced by alternating current (AC) machines with the same system output performance, but without the problems caused by the commutation brushes. Standard nonlinear control algorithms such as field-oriented control (FOC) can transform the highly nonlinear AC machines into linear systems; nevertheless, the system output performance degrades when the system plant is perturbed and/or external disturbances are present. In this thesis, the robustness issue of AC machine control is addressed. Three industrial problems of AC machine control are studied. These are, namely, velocity ripple elimination of AC permanent magnet (PM) motor systems, robustness enhancement of indirect field-oriented induction machine drives, {{as well as the}} development and control of a linear switched reluctance motor (LSRM) for high precision applications. Robust control techniques including H 2 and H∞ optimizations, internal model principle, and two degree of freedom (2 DOF) control structure, are employed in the above three problems to design the motor controllers on top of the nonlinear control algorithms, so that the reference transient tracking response, the external disturbance rejection performance and the system robustness could be improved under plant parameter variations and in the presence of external disturbances. Three test beds are developed to perform practical experiments and verify the effectiveness of the proposed motor controllers. The simulation and experimental results reveal that the overall system output performance can be improved using our proposed robust controllers...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MTech(Electrical Engineering)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2012 Due to {{the complex}} design of {{existing}} electric mobility vehicles in South Africa and their imported parts, make them unaffordable {{to the majority of}} disabled people in South Africa. The traditional electric units are also not practical for use in rural areas due to the heavy, bulky design. The scope {{of this study was to}} investigate various designs using existing wheelchair frame designs, low cost three phase hub motors and various electronic techniques to achieve the desired functionality. An attempt was be made to remove inefficient and expensive DC <b>brush</b> <b>motors</b> and the gear boxes associated with the traditional design of wheelchairs, while still allowing the unit to fold like the traditional manual chair design. One of the aims for this electric wheelchair was to utilise existing large radius wheels, typical of manual wheelchairs and a modified traditional frame design, providing the clearance often necessary to overcome rough terrain whilst enabling the chair to be used as a manual wheelchair should the battery fail. One of the primary aims of the project was to develop a method for an electric assist feature built into the modified electric wheelchair, whereby the force applied to the manual pushrims on the wheels would be measured and the electric component would proportionally assist the user. This option suits the users who are weak but not physically disabled. One of the many focal points here would be on HIV/AIDS patients, which is prevalent in South Africa, who may require a wheelchair when debilitated with this disease. The electric assist portion of the design would act similarly to a wireless self-powered torque sensor, allowing for an array of applications besides the electric assist portion of this project. A recent survey by National Government indicated that over 85 % of wheelchair users only generated an income of between R 0 – R 500 per month. Low state disability grants and wage figures for disabled and HIV/AIDS patients mean that electric mobility vehicles have become a luxury rather than an essential commodity in South Africa. The need for cheap electric wheelchairs that could cope with the rural terrain and could be fitted onto existing manual wheelchairs offering the full manual operation should the batteries go flat, was clearly apparent. The cost of an electric wheelchair ranges from R 18 000 with more advanced models escalating in price to well over R 150 000. These prices were typically the result of the complexity of the unit and local wheelchair manufacturers having to import 80 % of their parts from abroad. The largest local manufacturer is CE Mobility which is the dominant mobility vehicle supplier in Southern Africa and has the only SABS approved units for sale. Our complete redesigned wheelchair including the manual frame supplied by an existing supplier would only cost R 9 000. A prototype demonstrated that is was possible to build a wheelchair that meets all these criteria. A cost effective unit could provide a solution to assist and enable economically challenged and disabled people in rural areas of Southern Africa...|$|E
