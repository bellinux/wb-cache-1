5|$|Although {{the black}} catbird is {{unlikely}} to be mistaken for any other mimid species, there are several other black birds — including the melodious blackbird, the <b>bronzed</b> cowbird and the giant cowbird — that occur within the same range and might conceivably cause confusion. All are birds of more open habitats. The melodious blackbird is larger and longer tailed; it has dark eyes and a stocky bill with an evenly curved culmen. The <b>bronzed</b> cowbird is thicker necked than is the catbird and has a bronzy, rather than purplish or greenish gloss to its plumage; its eye is bright red rather than dark red. The giant cowbird is considerably larger, and is relatively longer tailed and thicker necked than is the catbird.|$|E
5|$|Banksia ericifolia 'Bronzed Aussie' is a white-budded terminal-flowering form to 2m with <b>bronzed</b> foliage; the inflorescences have honey-coloured pistils. It {{has been}} {{propagated}} by Victorian nurseryman Rod Parsons of Carawah Nursery in Hoddles Creek. A new release in 2003, its provenance is unknown; seed {{had been given}} to Rod's father by an SGAP member many years ago.|$|E
5|$|Adenanthos cuneatus {{was taken}} to Great Britain in 1824, and has been grown in {{cultivation}} in Australia and the western United States. Its attractive <b>bronzed</b> or reddish foliage is its main horticultural feature, along with its ability to attract birds to the garden. It requires a well-drained position to do well, but will grow in full sun or semi-shade, and tolerates both sand and gravelly soils. George Lullfitz, a Western Australian nurseryman, recommends growing it as a rambling ground cover in front of other shrubs, or in a rockery.|$|E
5|$|At 5ft 4in (1.62m), Burnham was slight, but he {{was also}} muscular and <b>bronzed,</b> with a finely formed square jaw. He had a boyish {{appearance}} which he used to his advantage on numerous occasions. His most noticeable feature was his steady, grey-blue eyes. Contemporary reports had it that Burnham's gaze appeared to never leave those of the person he was looking at, and yet somehow could simultaneously monitor all the details of the physical surroundings. It was also said that Burnham's eyes possessed a far-away look such as those acquired by people whose occupation has caused them to watch continually at sea or on great plains.|$|E
5|$|Excavators {{found the}} body of the Haraldskær Woman in a supine {{position}} in an excellent state of preservation. She was naked and her clothes, consisting of a leather cape and three woolen garments, had been placed on top of her. Hurdles of branches and wooden poles pinned the body down. The complete skin envelope and the internal organs were both intact. The body had a lancing wound to the knee joint area, where some object (possibly one of the sharp poles) penetrated to some depth. Her skin was deeply <b>bronzed</b> with a robust skin tone due to tannins in the peat, and all the body joints were preserved with overlying skin in a state as if she had died only recently. Doctors determined she had been about 50 years old when she died and in good health without signs of degenerative diseases (such as arthritis) which are typically found in human remains of that age.|$|E

Some of his lions were produced in tabletop versions.|$|E
25|$|Muncy's {{high school}} {{football}} team and the Montgomery high school team, play annually for The Shoe. The trophy was created in 1961 from an old athletic shoe found in the Muncy High School locker room; the shoe has been <b>bronzed</b> and mounted on a wooden box. Muncy currently leads the series with 28 wins to Montgomery's 18. Hughesville's high school team and Muncy are also rivals. In {{the first game of the}} season, September 4, 2010, Muncy kept The Shoe by shutting out Montgomery 52-0. As of January 2014, Muncy still is in possession of The Shoe.|$|E
25|$|The locker that Munson used, {{along with}} a <b>bronzed</b> set of his {{catching}} equipment, was donated to the Baseball Hall of Fame. Despite a packed clubhouse, Munson's final locker position was never reassigned. The empty locker next to Yankee team captain Derek Jeter's, with Munson's number 15 on it, remained {{as a tribute to}} the Yankees' lost catcher in the original Yankee Stadium until the Stadium closed in 2008. Munson's locker was moved in one piece to the New Yankee Stadium. It is located in the New York Yankees Museum. Visitors can view the Yankees Museum on game days from when the gates open {{to the end of the}} eighth inning and during Yankee Stadium tours. Munson's number 15 is also displayed on the center-field wall at Thurman Munson Stadium, a minor-league ballpark in Canton. Munson is buried at Canton's Sunset Hills Burial Park.|$|E
25|$|Designer Alfred Shaw {{integrated}} {{art deco}} stylings with influences from three building types—the warehouse, {{the department store}} and the skyscraper. A warehouse block stands as the 18-story bulk of the building. Ribbon piers define the windows, and the building's chamfered corners, minimal setbacks, and corner pavilions disguise {{the edges of the}} mass and visually reduce bulk. The south corner pavilions are of greater height than the north corner pavilions. The building is open at the pedestrian level with <b>bronzed</b> framed display windows, typical of a department store, on the south, west and east boundaries. The 25-story central tower ascends with a peak {{in the form of a}} skyscraper, and rests in the southern half of the building. Deeply recessed portals occur between raised panels, and are adorned with medallions featuring the interlocked initials of the Merchandise Mart. The same logo occurs throughout the building. Fifty six American Indian chiefs circled the tower's crown, a reference to the site's history and Chicago's early trade activities. Three and a half feet wide by seven feet tall, the terra cotta figures were barely visible from the street, meant to be viewed from the upper floors of the skyscrapers planned to rise along the riverbank.|$|E

500|$|Many birds {{migrate to}} the area around Aransas Bay, most notably to the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge. Year-round {{residents}} include least grebe, brown pelican, neotropic cormorant, white-faced ibis, roseate spoonbill, black-bellied whistling-duck, mottled duck, white-tailed hawk, crested caracara, pauraque, golden-fronted woodpecker, great kiskadee, green jay, long-billed thrasher, olive sparrow, seaside sparrow, and <b>bronzed</b> cowbird. [...] The endangered whooping crane has also been spotted near the bay. Despite {{the fact that there}} were only 15 in 1900, over 180 are found in the wild today. The whooping crane's and other birds' survival depends on the availability of blue crab. Thousands of crab traps have been removed to preserve the population.|$|E

In the early scenes she [...] "swaps her <b>bronzed</b> tan for alabaster skin, smokey eyes and pale lipstick". In the next scene {{she can be}} [...] "seen looking wistfully into the distance in a slinky floor-length black dress with brown hair extensions cascading over her shoulders", whilst in a third scene she is depicted as an [...] "Egyptian goddess". Each scene incorporates [...] "dance shots interspersed with sequences in which the focus falls on the two stars alone, seemingly searching each other, as it were ... experimenting more with her looks and even taking a chance with Lady Gaga-esque outfits for her dancers, including veils that cover their faces and black leotards." [...] It’s shot with a split screen, meaning Cheryl and will.i.am do not come into physical contact.|$|E

[...] He sought direct funding {{from the federal government}} in 1938 and from the Illinois Legislature the following year; both attempts failed. [...] Through the half century that followed, he progressed on the statues, and by {{the time of his death}} in 1990, he had completed the group in plaster of Paris, that still needed to be <b>bronzed</b> before display. Shortly before his death, he told his wife, [...] "I've lived a full life and have no regrets. The Pioneer Memorial is now completed. I've done all I could. Now it's up to others to see it erected. I can do no more." [...] Rovelstad's tenant, Steve Youngren, established a foundation to raise money to complete the project.

The two side gateways, in their elevations, present two insulated Ionic columns, flanked by antae. All these entrances are finished by a blocking, the sides of the central one being decorated with a beautiful frieze, representing a naval and military triumphal procession. This frieze was designed by Mr. Henning, junior, the son of Mr. Henning who was well known for his models of the Elgin Marbles. The gates were manufactured by Messrs. Bramah. They are of iron, <b>bronzed,</b> and fixed or hung to the piers by rings of gun-metal. The design {{consists of}} a beautiful arrangement of the Greek honeysuckle ornament; the parts being well defined, and the raffles of the leaves brought out in a most extraordinary manner." ...|$|E

500|$|With [...] "Ray of Light", Madonna debuted her [...] "Earth Mother" [...] look, {{complete}} with long strawberry {{blond hair and}} <b>bronzed</b> body. Author Georges Claude Guilbert wrote in his book, Madonna as Postmodern Myth, that her [...] "straggly, expensively unwashed look" [...] was {{comparable to that of}} singer Alanis Morissette and to Venetian paintings. According to Madonna she went for an Italian Renaissance look, invoking work of painter Raphael and Botticelli. Guilbert found the singer's description as catering to postmodernism, in tune with the zeitgeist, and noted that {{it was just one of}} her [...] "many reinventions". The book recalled how Madonna [...] "quickly grew tired of the Botticelli-Earth Mother phase" [...] with subsequent singles being promoted with a new Asian inspired look. In the book Ex-foliations: Reading Machines and the Upgrade Path, author Terry Harpold commented about the time-lapse sequences, especially the image of a clock and its hands rotating past the hours. He felt that the clip portrays the daily life as a futile attempt for survival, enhanced by another shot showing the sonogram of a fetus in utero, and a hamster running on a wheel. Santiago Fouz-Hernández, one of the authors of Madonna's Drowned Worlds, described Madonna as esoteric in the clip, as well as [...] "skin-deep Beverly Hills spiritualism".|$|E

According to Marcus Binney [...] "the gilded detail of the room has the lustre and crispness of gilt bronze, even the egg-and-dart in the boldly modelled cornice". Floral motifs are a common feature of the room, given the namesake, Marie Antoinette, and represents the flowers at one of her feasts. Over the overmantel is a basket of flowers, with [...] "flowers spilling out over the frames of the oval lunettes". [...] In the small entrance lobby of the suite are two terracotta statues of Spring and Summer, with [...] "drum-shaped pedestals ornamented with gilt-bronze flowers and ribbons". The ventilation grilles, of considerable size, are decorated in <b>bronzed</b> lattice. On the walls are a series lamp holders held by miniature Apollo lyres, with each bulb holder containing around 25 leaves opened out. The lights, according to Binney, are hung on [...] "cords from ribbons tied in bows, entwined at intervals with flowers, descending to a cluster of tassels". [...] The panels of the walls are treated like picture frames, with inner and outer mouldings, {{in contrast to the}} window frames and the wall mirrors which are surrounded by [...] "clusters of reeds, with an inset behind which a curtain could hang without obscuring the moulding", according to Binney.|$|E

2500|$|The {{reception}} pavilion {{received a}} complete overhaul. Its exterior metal façade of <b>bronzed</b> aluminum was removed {{and replaced with}} beige limestone. The glass curtain wall received new mechanical louvers. The interior wall coverings of dark wood paneling and <b>bronzed</b> aluminum were replaced with a cream-colored travertine wainscoting topped by a band of polished stone. Fabric covered the walls above the band, and white wooden grills were used to help break up the space. A new terrazzo floor in pastel colors was also installed. The old reception desk was removed, and a new, curvilinear reception desk was emplaced. Displays about where to eat, drink, and shop in downtown Cleveland {{were added to the}} lobby, as were several kiosks where airlines could assist convention-goers in making plane reservations. Six [...] trees were planted inside the lobby to make it more inviting, and new paving and exterior lighting were installed outside the pavilion.|$|E

Next morning there was an answering signal from the swamp where the sumacs grow. Three days later, the hill-sides {{as fast as the}} eye could range were afire, and the roads paved, with crimson and gold. Then a wet wind blew, and ruined all the uniforms of that gorgeous army; and the oaks, who had held themselves in reserve, buckled on their dull and <b>bronzed</b> cuirasses and stood it out stiffly to the last blown leaf, till nothing remained but pencil-shadings of bare boughs, and one could see into the most private heart of the woods." ...|$|E

[...] IGN wrote that Simpson seemed [...] "confused, awry, and decidedly astray in terms of discovering her own unique personality and sound. Until she's able to establish her own distinct entity, Ashlee is destined to be another forgotten footnote on the fickle pop front." [...] Andy Gill of The Independent only gave the album one star and wrote, [...] "Her voice is all attitude and no emotion, a textbook case of style over substance – and given the paucity of style, that's as insubstantial as it gets."
