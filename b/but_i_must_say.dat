500|$|Christopher Reeve, {{star of the}} Superman films, {{expressed}} his approval of the show:I {{was a little bit}} skeptical when I heard about [...] at first, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>say</b> the writing, the acting, and the special effects are quite remarkable. In 1977, a big stunt scene would have taken us a week to film—it's pretty impressive what they are able to do with computers and effects technology today on a weekly TV show. It gives it a lot more production value and inventiveness than I thought I was going to see when I first heard about the series. I think the show is doing a really good job following the mythology, and Tom {{is doing a good job}} following the tradition.|$|E
500|$|Bayern {{president}} Franz Beckenbauer recognised {{that it was}} a loss {{of concentration}} in the last few minutes that led to his side's defeat: [...] "That was the cruellest defeat possible because victory was so close. We already had victory in the bag and {{there were only a few}} seconds to go. But those few seconds were enough for Manchester to get back into the game. We were playing well in the last 20 minutes and should have been able to hold on to victory. But in the end, Manchester deservedly won." [...] Manager Ottmar Hitzfeld seemed more stunned by the result in his reaction: [...] "I feel so sorry for my team because they were so close to winning this match but they have lost. It's really difficult to digest and this is inconceivable for us but then this is what football is all about. Normally when the opposition equalise you are expecting extra-time and it was a shock to our team when they scored the winner two minutes later. It could take days or even weeks to recover from this <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>say</b> that Manchester are great champions." ...|$|E
500|$|During the {{subsequent}} media coverage, {{the game was}} removed from shelves by some vendors, including both UK and international branches of Game and Dixons. Rockstar responded to this move by stating, [...] "we have always appreciated Dixons as a retail partner, and we fully respect their actions. We are naturally very surprised and disappointed that any retailer would choose to pull any game ... We reject any suggestion or association between the tragic events and the sale of Manhunt." [...] Rockstar also reiterated that the game was intended for adults only; [...] "Rockstar Games is a leading publisher of interactive entertainment geared towards mature audiences, and [...] markets its games responsibly, targeting advertising and marketing only to adult consumers ages 18 and older." [...] As the media speculated that the game could be banned completely, there was a [...] "significantly increased" [...] demand for it both from retailers and on Internet auction sites. Giselle Pakeerah responded to this by saying [...] "it doesn't really come as surprise, they say no publicity is bad publicity. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>say</b> I'm saddened and disappointed. The content of this game is contemptible. It's a societal hazard and my concern is to get it off the shelves as there's enough violence in society already." ...|$|E

'Ah, sure, {{and how he}} came as a {{stranger}} and pilgrim to Parson Swancourt's that time, not a soul knowing en after so many years! Ay, life's a strange picter, Stephen: <b>but</b> <b>I</b> suppose <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>say</b> Sir to ye?' ...|$|R
500|$|Nielsen {{lived for}} several years in Fort Norman (now Tulita) in the Northwest Territories where his father was with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. His father was an abusive man who beat his wife and sons, and Leslie longed to escape. When he {{graduated}} from high school at 17, he joined the Royal Canadian Air Force even though he was legally deaf (he wore hearing aids most of his life). Following graduation from Victoria School of Performing and Visual Arts in Edmonton, Nielsen enlisted in the Royal Canadian Air Force and trained as an aerial gunner during World War II. He was too young to be fully trained or sent overseas. He worked briefly as a disc jockey at a Calgary, Alberta, radio station, before enrolling at the Lorne Greene Academy of Radio Arts in Toronto. While studying in Toronto, Nielsen received a scholarship to the Neighborhood Playhouse. He noted, [...] "I couldn't refuse, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>say</b> when you come from the land of the snow goose, the moose and wool to New York, you're bringing every ton of hayseed and country bumpkin that you packed. As long as I didn't open my mouth, I felt a certain security. But I always thought I was going to be unmasked: 'OK, pack your stuff.' 'Well, what's the matter?' 'We've discovered you have no talent; we're shipping you back to Canada. He moved to New York City for his scholarship, studying theatre and music at the Neighborhood Playhouse, while performing in summer stock theatre. Afterward, he attended the Actors Studio, until his first television appearance in 1950 on an episode of Studio One, alongside Charlton Heston, for which he was paid $75.|$|E
2500|$|Hazare {{once told}} the Bala {{that he was}} [...] "not aware of the {{exchange}} between him (Shodhan) and Vinoo, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>say</b> that Vinoo was not too keen that Deepak play. I suppose Vinoo found Deepak's attitude casual. ... (Shodhan) {{was not interested in}} touring (after the final Test of the series) ... Maybe {{it had to do with}} his business commitments. He had made himself unavailable for the tour of Pakistan and it might have been because Vinoo was the captain." ...|$|E
2500|$|Australia visited Bangladesh in April 2006 and Mortaza {{played the}} whole series. Despite coming close to winning the first Test, Bangladesh {{ultimately}} lost both Tests in the series. In the final innings {{of the first}} Test, Mortaza dropped a difficult catch off Australian captain Ricky Ponting {{who went on to}} see his side to victory with 118 not out. Habibul Bashar, the Bangladesh captain, said of the dropped catch, [...] "If he had taken it we could have seen a different situation, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>say</b> he tried hard and you all know that he is a whole-hearted cricketer". Bangladesh lost the following three-match ODI series 3–0.|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't quite say that. I suppose I do know pretty well. At any rate, I {{know enough}} {{to think that you}} ought to come. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>must</b> not <b>say</b> what it is." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, it {{is a very}} lovely view; <b>but</b> really <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>say</b> {{one more}} word about this matter. I have to thank you, you know, for the good faith which you have kept with me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good gracious! Mr. Darcy!--and so it does, I vow. Well, any {{friend of}} Mr. Bingley's {{will always be}} welcome here, to be sure; <b>but</b> else <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>say</b> that <b>I</b> hate the very sight of him." ...|$|R
2500|$|.....a pianist {{who appears}} to be {{something}} really quite extraordinary. [...] I had to overcome great resistance in order to go at all, for the description I'd heard from Dr. Hoffmann and from Maurice Zam had made me very skeptical. [...] <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>say</b> that I have never heard such a pianist before...First, [...] he does not play at all in the style you and I strive for. [...] And just as I did not judge him on that basis, I imagine that when you hear him, you too will be compelled to ignore all matters of principle, and probably will end up doing just as I did. [...] For your principles would not be the proper standard to apply. [...] What he plays is expression in the older sense of the word, nothing else; but such power of expression I have never heard before. [...] You will disagree with his tempis as much as I did. [...] You will also note that he often seems to give primacy to sharp contrasts at the expense of form, the latter appearing to get lost. [...] I say appearing to; for then, in its own way, his music surprisingly regains its form, makes sense, establishes its own boundaries. [...] The sound he brings out of the piano is unheard of, or at least I have never heard anything like it. [...] He himself seems not to know how he produces these novel and quite incredible sounds - although he appears to be a man of intelligence and not just some flaccid dreamer. [...] And such fullness of tone, achieved without ever becoming rough, I have never before encountered. [...] For me, and probably for you too, it's really too much fullness, but as a whole it displays incredible novelty and persuasiveness. [...] And above all he's only [...] old, so he's still got several stages of development before him, from which one may expect great things, given his point of departure... it is amazing what he plays and how he plays it. [...] One never senses that it is difficult, that it is technique - no, it is simply a power of the will, capable of soaring over all imaginable difficulties in the realization of an idea. - You see, I'm waxing almost poetic.|$|E

6000|$|... "It is the smoking-room over again," [...] whispered St. Aldegonde to Lothair, [...] "only in England one is {{so glad to}} {{get away}} from the women, <b>but</b> here <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> should have liked to remain behind." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Now,' he said, 'I {{will go to}} men. <b>But</b> first <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>say</b> {{farewell}} to my mother'; {{and he went to}} the cave where she lived with Father Wolf, and he cried on her coat, while the four cubs howled miserably.|$|R

6000|$|... "My boy, {{the whole}} {{universe}} is baffling to me," [...] his host replied, and into his voice came that tone of tragic weariness which affected the youth like a strain of solemn music. [...] "The older I grow the more senseless, hopelessly senseless, human life appears; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>must</b> not <b>say</b> such things to you. Good-night." ...|$|R

Finally he mumbles 'Thank you.' And we must leave him." ...|$|R
