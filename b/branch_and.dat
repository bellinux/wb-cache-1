40|$|In many {{software}} configuration management (SCM) systems, <b>branching</b> <b>and</b> merging are fundamental operations, supporting isolation and integration (respectively). Unfortunately, the obvious <b>branching</b> <b>and</b> merging strategies have unpleasant consequences.

In particular, it presents a way of updating an active branch from a new baseline.

5|$|An {{extension}} {{of a proposed}} Madison Avenue Line and the IND Sixth Avenue Line operating via 59th Street, with two branches. One branch would have operated along Second Avenue with a branch connecting to the IRT Pelham Line, which {{would have had to}} be modified to fit B Division subway cars, and a branch connecting to the IND Concourse Line. The other branch would have continued under the East River, and would have been connected to the Long Island Rail Road main line in the Sunnyside area. Subway trains would have continued via the Port Washington Branch to Little Neck, and via the LIRR Main Line to Rego Park, where it would have turned via the former Rockaway Beach <b>Branch</b> <b>and</b> then would have turned onto the Lower Montauk <b>Branch,</b> <b>and</b> would have continued on the branch through Jamaica, where it would continue via the Atlantic Branch until Rosedale, staying within city limits.

The organization also made changes to Nate McMillan's coaching staff by hiring Bernie Bickerstaff, Bob Ociepka and Buck Williams, with Bickerstaff assuming the lead assistant coach position due to the departure of Monty Williams. The Blazers acquired rookies Armon Johnson, Luke Babbitt, and Elliot Williams from the 2010 NBA draft and off-season trades.

40|$|The use of {{version control}} has become {{ubiquitous}} in software development projects. Version control systems facilitate parallel development <b>and</b> maintenance through <b>branching,</b> {{the creation of}} isolated codelines. Merging {{is a consequence of}} <b>branching</b> <b>and</b> is the process of integrating codelines. However, there are unanswered questions about the use of version control to support parallel development; in particular, how are <b>branching</b> <b>and</b> merging used in practice? What defines a successful <b>branching</b> <b>and</b> merging strategy? As a first step towards answering these questions, we recruited a diverse sample of 140 version control users to participate in an online survey. In this paper, we present the survey results and 4 key observations about <b>branching</b> <b>and</b> merging practices in software development projects...|$|R
40|$|Two genotypes of sesame namely TMV 4 (<b>branched)</b> <b>and</b> CS 601 (shy branch) were {{selected}} for the characterassociation study to assess the relationship among yield and its components for selection criteria to be followedwhile developing varieties. Observations were recorded on five traits viz., plant height, number of branches perplant, number of capsules in main stem, number of capsules in <b>branches</b> <b>and</b> seed yield per plant. Characterassociation analysis revealed positive association of seed yield per plant with number of capsules on branchesper plant in both TMV 4 and CS 601. Likewise number of <b>branches</b> <b>and</b> number of capsules on main stem hadpositive association in both genotypes. However, the association between number of <b>branches</b> <b>and</b> seed yield,between number of <b>branches</b> <b>and</b> number of capsules on branches, between number of capsules on main stemand number of capsules on branches had positive association in TMV 4 only. Plant height had positiveassociation with number of capsules on main stem in CS 601 only. This study clearly indicated the differentialassociation of characters in <b>branched</b> <b>and</b> shy <b>branch</b> genotypes. Hence while formulating selection index,separate association studies are necessary if the genotypes differed on branching types...|$|R
