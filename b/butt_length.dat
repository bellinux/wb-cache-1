25|$|A few knots {{have become}} more or less {{standard}} for attaching the {{various parts of the}} fly lines and backing, etc., together. A detailed discussion of most of these knots is available in any good book on fly fishing. Some of the knots that are in most every fly angler's arsenal are: the improved clinch knot which is commonly used to attach the fly to the leader, the overhand slip knot or arbor knot which is used to attach the backing to the spool, the albright knot which can be used to attach the fly line to the backing. A loop can also be put in fly line backing using a bimini twist. Often, a loop is added to the business end of the fly line to facilitate the connection to the leader. This loop may take one of several forms. It may be formed by creating a loop in the end of the fly line itself or by adding a braided loop or a loop of monofilament nylon (as in Gray's Loop). Alternatively, a single length of monofilament nylon, or fluorocarbon, may be tied {{to the end of the}} fly line using a nail or tube knot or a needle knot. A loop can then be tied at the end of this monofilament <b>butt</b> <b>length</b> or butt section using a double surgeon's knot or a perfection loop, to which the tapered or untapered leader, also looped using a double surgeon's knot or a perfection loop, may in turn be connected via a loop to loop connection. The use of loop to loop connections between the fly line and the leader provides a quick and convenient way to change or replace a tapered leader. Many commercially produced tapered leaders come with a pre-tied loop connection.|$|E
50|$|Australia {{produced}} a shortened {{version of the}} L1A1 designated the L1A1-F1. It was intended for easier use by soldiers of smaller stature in jungle combat, as the standard L1A1 is a long, heavy weapon. The reduction in length was achieved by installing the shortest <b>butt</b> <b>length</b> (there were three available, short, standard and long), and a flash suppressor that resembled the standard version except it projected a much smaller distance beyond {{the end of the}} rifling, and had correspondingly shorter flash eliminator slots. The effect was to reduce the length of the weapon by 2 1/4 inches. Trials revealed that, despite no reduction in barrel length, accuracy was slightly reduced. The L1A1-F1 was provided to Papua New Guinea, and a number were sold to the Royal Hong Kong Police in 1984. They were also issued to female staff cadets at the Royal Military College Duntroon and some other Australian personnel.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Examination {{of tobacco}} butts and its {{possible}} use in tobacco control. DESIGN: Macroscopic examination of cigarette butts collected outside or in dedicated smoking rooms of a smoke-free hospital. RESULTS: Of 925 butts, 3. 8 % were cigarillos, 11. 1 % cigarettes without filter, 57. 7 % ventilated filter cigarettes, 22. 5 % filter cigarettes without macroscopic ventilation and 4. 9 % undetermined. Thirty-six different cigarette brands were identified. A wide distribution of <b>butt</b> <b>lengths</b> (mean 32. 1 mm, variation coefficient 28 %), peripheral ovalisation of the filter in 83. 9 %, and extended browning {{of the mouth}} end of the filter in 48. 6 % were observed. Vent holes were macroscopically detectable in 70. 5 % and a sharp decrease in browning in 53. 4 % of the filter cigarettes. Most (94. 7 %) ventilation holes were located at > or = 10 mm from the mouth end. CONCLUSIONS: In a smoke-free hospital, the use of tobacco products (mainly ventilated filter cigarettes) remains sizeable. Given the wide distribution of <b>butt</b> <b>lengths,</b> the number of cigarettes per day is a poor marker of toxin intake. Vent-hole localisation and signs of vent-blocking confirm the inadequacy of machine-measured smoke yields {{and the presence of}} compensatory smoking. More intensive individual cessation advice with pharmacological support is necessary. Examination of a smoker's own cigarette butts {{can be used as a}} tool for individual cessation advice...|$|R
40|$|Methods {{based on}} the {{analyses}} of cigarette filters {{have been used to}} estimate ‘tar’ and nicotine yields to smokers. These methods rely on the measurement of filtration efficiencies (FEs). However FEs may be influenced by both cigarette design features e. g., type of filter and levels of filter ventilation, and human smoking behaviour factors such as puff flow-rates and cigarette <b>butt</b> <b>lengths.</b> Two filter analysis methods are considered in our study. One is {{based on the}} analysis of whole filters using average values of FEs obtained from a range of machine smoking regimes. The other, a ‘part filter’ method, analyses a 10 mm section from the mouth end of the filter where the FE remains relatively constant irrespective of puff flow rates and <b>butt</b> <b>lengths.</b> Human puffing behaviour records were obtained from 10 smokers, each smoking six commercial cigarettes ranging from 1 mg to 12 mg ‘tar’ yields [International Standard (ISO) values]. These records were used to drive a human smoke duplicator and the resulting ‘tar’ and nicotine yields obtained from duplication were compared with the estimates obtained from ‘whole’ and ‘part filter’ analysis. The results indicated that whilst both filter methods gave good correlations with nicotine and ‘tar’ yields obtained from smoke duplication, the ‘part filter’ method was less susceptible to the effect of nicotine condensation and changes in FEs and hence gave a more accurate assessment of yields than the ‘whole filter’ method...|$|R

Thus an adjustable cheek pad may have been provided if wanted, and the <b>butt</b> <b>lengths</b> can be altered by adding or taking away butt spacers of various thicknesses. The rifle was basically a standard target 7.62×51mm NATO heavy-barreled Mauser 98 with a wide beaver tail target walnut stock (with inset handstop rail) and a Parker Hale trigger with its side safety mechanism. The sights were subject to several variations, but the standard Model 82 was normally supplied with removable ‘iron’ match-type sight blocks. If an optical sight is fitted the rear-sight was removed, and the front sight slid off, but the front block/post remained. Two mounting blocks were fitted to the receiver for the purpose of the fitting of optical sight mounts, supplied with the Parker Hale are the parkerized aluminium scope rings; rifles that were in service in the Australian and New Zealand armies used the Austrian Kahles Wien ZF-69 6×42 (26mm tube) drop compensation telescopic sight set in 100m increments out to 800m, with fine crosshair. Some attempts at refurbishing and rebarrelling the rifles resulted in usage of one piece scope mounts but this proved unsatisfactory.

40|$|The {{analysis}} of spent filters from human-smoked (HS) cigarettes {{has been used}} to estimate cigarette yields for over three decades. Until recently, the whole filter was used for estimation; however a part-filter method has been shown to improve the accuracy of estimated HS yields.

In this portion, the filtration efficiency is relatively constant irrespective of typical puff flow rates of humans and also minimizes <b>butt</b> <b>length</b> effects (e. g. nicotine condensation) on filtration efficiency.

40|$|The modern low-yield {{cigarette}} {{is defined}} by a stan-dardized smoking-machine test {{commonly referred to as}} the FTC method (Peeler, 1996), based on the Federal Trade Commission protocol.

40|$|Bialous and Yach have {{recently}} {{published an article}} in Tobacco Control in which they claim that all smoking-machine standards stem from a method developed unilaterally by the tobacco industry within the Cooperation Centre for Scientific Research Relative to Tobacco (CORESTA). Using a few highly selective quotations from internal tobacco company memos, they allege, inter alia, that the tobacco industry has changed the method to suit its own needs, that because humans do not smoke like machines the standards are of little value, and that the tobacco industry has unjustifiably made health claims about low “tar” cigarettes. The objectives of this paper are to review the development of smoking-machine methodology and standards, involvement of relative parties, outline {{the significance of the}} results and explore the validity of Bialous and Yach's claims. The large volume of published scientific information on the subject together with other information in the public domain has been consulted. When this information is taken into account it becomes obvious that the very narrow and restricted literature base of Bialous and Yach's analysis has resulted in them, perhaps inadvertedly, making factual errors, drawing wrong conclusions and writing inaccurate statements on many aspects of the subject. The first smoking-machine standard was specified by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), a federal government agency in the USA, in 1966. The CORESTA Recommended Method, similar in many aspects to that of the FTC, was developed in the late 1960 s and published in 1969. Small differences in the <b>butt</b> <b>lengths,</b> smoke collection and analytical procedures in methods used in various countries including Germany, Canada and the UK, developed later, resulted in about a 10 % difference in smoke “tar” yields. These differences in methodology were harmonised in a common International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) Standard Method in 1991, after a considerable amount of interlaboratory comparisons of the developing methodology had been undertaken by CORESTA. As acknowledged by Bialous and Yach, the purpose of the standards is to determine the “tar”, nicotine and carbon monoxide content of cigarette smoke when the cigarette is smoked under precisely defined conditions, and hence to allow a comparison of the yields from different cigarettes when smoked under identical conditions. Such yields are not predictive of the yields humans obtain when smoking, nor were they ever expected to be so, since no two smokers smoke exactly the same nor does a smoker smoke a cigarette the same way on every occasion. This purpose has been stated consistently many times, originally by the FTC in 1967 and subsequently in the scientific literature, published by the tobacco industry and health/regulatory authorities, over the last 35 years. From the 1950 s onwards numerous public health scientists have advocated that lower “tar” cigarettes should be developed {{on the grounds that they}} may reduce to some extent the risks of smoking, while at the same time advocating that the best way to avoid risks is not to smoke. Some health authorities have have used the standard machine-smoking yields to set limits on “tar” as a way of reducing the health impact of cigarette use. The tobacco industry has co-operated with these health authorities by developing cigarettes with lower “tar” but has also followed public health advice by not advertising lower “tar” cigarettes as safe cigarettes. The available evidence, taken as a whole, indicates that compensation by smokers who switch from a high to a low “tar” cigarette is partial in the short term, and that such smokers do obtain a reduction in smoke component uptake...|$|R
40|$|Cigarette {{smoke is}} a complex mixture of smoke constituents, often characterised by size-resolved {{particle}} distributions. Since descriptions of ultrafine particles < 50 nm are absent, {{our aim was to}} explore the existence of these nanoparticles in fresh and undiluted cigarette smoke. We measured undiluted smoke particles real-time by a scanning mobility particle sizer with Faraday cup electrometer, integrated in our custom-made smoking machine. Cigarettes were smoked by 2 s puffs, 30 s puff intervals and 50 ml puff volume. We tested six different cigarettes (1 - 10 mg tar per cigarette) at ten particle size-ranges between 6 and 50 nm, and repeated measurements five times. The formation of nanoparticles in fresh cigarette smoke was observed over the entire range between 6 and 50 nm, and reproduced in all cigarettes. The highest mean yield was 8. 8 x 10 (9) (SD = 1. 1 x 10 (9)) particles per cigarette at the largest particle size range by high-tar cigarettes.

40|$|Abstract. In {{extrusion}} processes {{metal flow}} {{has an important}} influence on the microstructure and the mechanical properties of the extrudates. Thus, a deep knowledge about the metal flow during the forming process is required as basis for further computations of the microstructure evolution. In this study experimental and numerical investigations {{on the influence of}} friction on the metal flow in extrusion processes were carried out using visioplastic methods and finite element method (FEA). The objective was to determine the influence of ram speed, ram displacement and billet temperature on the material flow during extrusion of the aluminum alloy AlMgSi 1 (EN AW- 6082). For this purpose the forming stroke was varied at constant temperature so that a <b>butt</b> <b>length</b> of 100 mm and 150 mm could be produced. Further the influence of different ram speeds at 4. 22 mm/s, 6. 33 mm/s and 8. 44 mm/s was investigated. In order to identify the metal flow and in special the shear zone as well as the dead metal zone, the billets of 250 mm length and a diameter of 140 mm were prepared with round aluminum indicator pins with a diameter of 4 mm which were placed in the plane of symmetry of the billet. For the experimental investigations a compact direct extrusion press with a nominal force of 10 MN (SMS Eumuco) was used.
