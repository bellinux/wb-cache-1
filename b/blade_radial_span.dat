This numerical code is a 1 -D code characterized by fast processing times and reliable results. The critical aspects of the codes based on the BEM theory are widely known in scientific literature. In this paper, the authors explain how to resolve these aspects. One of these is represented by the radial flow along the <b>blades.</b> <b>Radial</b> flow is a 3 -D flow, but can be dealt with inside a 1 -D code only using a mathematical expedient. This expedient was tested and validated for the Risø test turbine LM 8. 2 (with the NACA 63 x- 2 xx airfoil series along the <b>blades).</b> <b>Radial</b> flow along the blades is taken into account, thus increasing the experimental CL distribution in the stalled aerodynamic region, based on CFD 3 D results. The mathematical equation adopted to describe the CL distribution of the NACA 63 x- 2 xx airfoil is a fifth order logarithmic polynomial. With this numerical code, the mechanical power curve of the Risø test turbine has been calculated, and then compared with the experimental curve found in scientific literature...|$|R

The principal component of our design, which uses inchworm type motion, is a compliant ring mechanism actuated using shape memory alloy (SMA) wire. It was fabricated and tested and was reported in our earlier work. But this device had a drawback of low crawling speed (about 1 mm/min) owing to the delay in heating and cooling of the SMA strips in the linear actuation. Additionally, that design also had the difficulties of mounting on pipes with closed ends, large <b>radial</b> <b>span,</b> and the need for housing for electrical insulation and guiding of the SMA wire. In this paper we present a compact design that overcomes the difficulties of the earlier design. In particular, we present a compact compliant mechanism with two halves so as to enable mounting and un-mounting on any closed or open pipe. Another feature is the presence of insulation and guiding of the SMA wire without housing. This design results in a reduction of the <b>radial</b> <b>span</b> of the ring from 22 mm to 12 mm, and the stiffness of the mechanism and the SMA wire are matched.

40|$|Actual {{gas turbine}} {{performance}} and component life at specific engine installations is {{highly dependent on}} the actual operating conditions, since not all engines are operated in the same manner. Due to the variability in turbine operation, it may be prudent to evaluate the operation of hot section components for turbine inlet conditions that are specific to a single installation. However, determining the actual turbine inlet conditions can be a difficult and expensive process that is usually only done on test bed gas turbines. This paper presents a method to determine turbine inlet conditions using a model calibration approach. Two-stage CFD and thermal analyses are developed to predict blade temperature. By varying the model inputs, computational predictions of blade temperature are calibrated to blade interdiffusion zone thickness measurements. In order to speed up calculations, surrogate models are used {{in place of the}} full-scale analysis codes during the calibration analysis. The result of the study is a prediction of the turbine inlet profile necessary to obtain the best agreement between predicted and measured blade temperatures.
