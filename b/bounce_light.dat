50|$|David Watkin BSC (23 March 1925 - 19 February 2008) was a British cinematographer, an {{innovator}} who {{was among}} the first directors of photography to experiment heavily with the usage of <b>bounce</b> <b>light</b> as a soft light source. He worked with such film directors as Richard Lester, Peter Brook, Tony Richardson, Mike Nichols, Ken Russell, Franco Zeffirelli, Sidney Lumet and Sydney Pollack.|$|E
50|$|Contact image sensors (CIS) are image sensors used in flatbed {{scanners}} {{almost in}} {{direct contact with}} the object to be scanned. Charge-coupled devices (CCDs), often used for this application, use mirrors to <b>bounce</b> <b>light</b> to a stationary sensor. CISs are much smaller than CCDs, use typically a tenth as much power, and are particularly suitable for low power and portable applications, often powered over USB.|$|E

25|$|In spectroscopy, {{optical fiber}} bundles {{transmit}} {{light from a}} spectrometer to a substance that cannot be placed inside the spectrometer itself, in order to analyze its composition.

50|$|Monck invented an {{innovative}} method of stage lighting for the 1972 tour. Instead of raising 3,000 pounds of lamps to the trusses, Monck installed a 40' x 8' array of Mylar mirrors.

50|$|Foamcore is {{commonly}} used to produce architectural models, prototype small objects and to produce patterns for casting. Scenery for scale model displays, dioramas, and computer games are often produced by hobbyists from foamcore. It's also often used by photographers as a reflector to <b>bounce</b> <b>light,</b> in the design industry to mount presentations of new products, and in picture framing as a backing material; the latter use includes some archival picture framing methods, which utilize the acid-free versions of the material. Another use is with aero-modellers for building radio-controlled aircraft.|$|E
50|$|When {{creating}} lightmaps, any lighting {{model may}} be used, because the lighting is entirely precomputed and real-time performance {{is not always}} a necessity. A variety of techniques including ambient occlusion, direct lighting with sampled shadow edges, and full radiosity <b>bounce</b> <b>light</b> solutions are typically used. Modern 3d packages include specific plugins for applying light-map UV-coordinates, atlas-ing multiple surfaces into single texture sheets, and rendering the maps themselves. Alternatively game engine pipelines may include custom lightmap creation tools. An additional consideration is the use of compressed DXT textures which are subject to blocking artifacts - individual surfaces must not collide on 4x4 texel chunks for best results.|$|E
5000|$|Active {{daylighting}} uses a tubular daylight device—TDD. It is a roof-mounted fixed unit skylight element, condensing sunlight, {{distributed by}} a light conveying optic conduit to a light diffusing element. Being small in diameter, {{they can be}} used for daylighting smaller spaces such as hallways, and <b>bounce</b> <b>light</b> in darker corners of spaces. TDDs harvest daylight through a roof-mounted dome with diameters ranging from about 10 inches for residential applications to 22 inches for commercial buildings. Made from acrylic or polycarbonate formulated to block ultraviolet rays, the dome captures and redirects light rays into an aluminum tubing system that resembles ductwork.

50|$|One {{solution}} is to set the screen {{up from the floor}} and placing some blocks/staging in front to block some of the <b>bouncing</b> <b>light.</b> When considering colour gels it is imperative to consider colours used in the screen images and try to match them as well as possible to give a blended effect.|$|R
50|$|At {{the age of}} 21, Mitra, who {{had never}} before {{operated}} a motion picture camera, {{began his career as}} a cinematographer with Satyajit Ray, the legendary Indian film maker, for Pather Panchali (1955). He continued to work with him for many of Ray's later films. He is known for pioneering the technique of <b>bounce</b> <b>lighting,</b> while filming The Apu Trilogy. He was also a cousin of the renowned singer Uma Bose.|$|R
5000|$|Satyajit Ray {{thought that}} [...] "Subrata Mitra’s camera work {{is better than}} Raoul Coutard’s".

5000|$|The [...] "red-eye effect" [...] {{is another}} problem with on camera and ring flash units. Since the retina of the human eye {{reflects}} red light straight back in the direction it came from, pictures taken from straight {{in front of a}} face often exhibit this effect. It can be somewhat reduced by using the [...] "red eye reduction" [...] found on many cameras (a pre-flash that makes the subject's irises contract). However, very good results can be obtained only with a flash unit that is separated from the camera, sufficiently far from the optical axis, or by using bounce flash, where the flash head is angled to <b>bounce</b> <b>light</b> off a wall, ceiling or reflector.|$|E
5000|$|The sun-controlling {{feature of}} the {{building}} allows the sun to warm the interior in winter and reduces solar energy in summer. The northern {{side of the building}} has clerestory windows that allow indirect sunlight into the building. The southern side of the building has shelves that <b>bounce</b> <b>light</b> into the interior. The building uses photocells and motion sensors for general lighting. Approximately 20% of the building electricity is produced by 10.5 kW photovoltaic arrays consisting of new and recycled solar panels. The building’s long side faces south allowing the solar panels to receive maximum sunlight. The building’s annual energy savings are 57,969 kilowatt hours which avoid 27 tons of carbon emissions per year.|$|E
50|$|Central Park’s {{cantilevered}} heliostat {{figures as}} another defining {{feature of the}} building. Suspended from the 28th floor of One Central Park’s east tower, it serves {{not only as a}} predominant design element to the building but as a way of reflecting light to the gardens and atrium below. It operates through a series of motorised mirrors that are positioned 100 metres below the cantilever on the rooftop of the west tower. Daylight is automatically tracked from these mirrors and the light is reflected up to the cantilever. 220 fixed reflecting panels are positioned across the underbelly of the cantilever and are able to then <b>bounce</b> <b>light</b> throughout the retail atrium, pedestrian corridor, pool terrace and communal areas. On the upper side of the cantilever a sky garden has been erected. At night the cantilever is transformed into an LED light display through the work of international lighting artist Yann Kersalé.|$|E
50|$|The cinematographer Subrata Mitra, {{who made}} his debut with Ray's The Apu Trilogy, also had an {{importance}} influence on cinematography across the world. One of his most important techniques was <b>bounce</b> <b>lighting,</b> to recreate the effect of daylight on sets. He pioneered the technique while filming Aparajito (1956), {{the second part of}} The Apu Trilogy. Some of the experimental techniques which Satyajit Ray pioneered include photo-negative flashbacks and X-ray digressions while filming Pratidwandi (1972).|$|R
5000|$|Some {{species have}} a tapetum, a {{reflective}} layer which <b>bounces</b> <b>light</b> that {{passes through the}} retina back through it again. This enhances sensitivity in low light conditions, such as nocturnal and deep sea species, by giving photons {{a second chance to}} be captured by photoreceptors. [...] However this comes at a cost of reduced resolution. Some species are able to effectively turn their tapetum off in bright conditions, with a dark pigment layer covering it as needed.|$|R
50|$|In January 2002, Minolta again {{created a}} new {{category}} of camera, introducing the Minolta DiMAGE X, an ultracompact digital with a 3x folded zoom lens. With the folded approach, no moving parts of the lens are external to the camera. Instead, a 45-degree mirror <b>bounces</b> <b>light</b> to a conventional zoom lens safely tucked inside the camera body. Fast startup times are one potential benefit of this design (since nothing needs to extend), but slow focus and shutter lag times marred the advantage of this innovation.|$|R

40|$|Solar cells tap the {{ubiquitous}} {{energy of the}} sun and are vital to many space-based assets. The proposed research will develop “ 3 -D ” carbon nanotube (CNT) based textured photovoltaic (PV) cells. The PV cells developed herein will be small in “footprint ” due to the nanostructured topography and will be very light weight making them extremely beneficial for aerospace and mobile applications where mass and volume can be major cost and acceptance drivers. Concept: In the proposed concept, a 3 -D aligned array of highly conductive CNT towers are grown on lithographically patterned Si wafers. The interconnected CNT array is then coated with suitable photon absorbing bandgap materials to form a p/n-junction. A conductive oxide such as indium tin oxide (ITO) is deposited as the transparent top contact of the PV cell. Benefits: 1. Multiple <b>bounce</b> <b>light</b> trapping – In a traditional (planar) single junction solar cell, a photon of light impinges the p/n-junction at a single instance and may create a single electron-hole pair. Then, despite numerous efforts to the contrary, any unabsorbed photons reflect into the atmosphere or space (Figure 1). For the proposed CNT-based device, multiple impingements (Figure 2) and scattering of the incident photon upon the p/n-junction increase the probability of absorption due to extended dwell time in the photoactive layers. This effect, whereby a single photon can interact with the p/n junction multiple times is termed “light trapping. ...|$|E
40|$|Shade' has a {{technical}} definition peculiar to linear spectral mixture analysis of imaging spectrometer data: {{it is the}} reduction in radiance from a surface due to lighting conditions and geometry, and includes topographic shading described by photometric functions as well as shadowing at all scales. 'Shade' is an important constituent of nearly all remotely sensed images, and is one endmember resolved in spectral mixture analysis, where it is represented as {{a fraction of the}} measured radiance and a characteristic spectrum. This spectrum is typically the null vector, provided the data have been corrected for atmospheric and instrument effects: i. e., 'shade' is the radiance from an ideal black surface. In topographic shading, irradiance is reduced - typically in proportion to cos(i), where i (incidence angle) is the angle between the sun and the local surface normal vectors. Therefore, the radiance is lowered by a multiplicative factor. Shadowing occurs when i is greater than 90 deg, or when sunlight is blocked by adjacent high terrain; the only irradiance is down-welling skylight and <b>bounce</b> <b>light</b> from adjacent terrain. In spectral mixture analysis, 'shade' is regarded as an additive term. In this regard, it is an accurate description of the proportion of a scene that consists of ideal shadows ('checkerboard mixing'); however, 'shade' represents the multiplicative cos(i) factor as well, as here it should be interpreted as the proportion of shadow that would darken the scene an equivalent amount. In either case, the 'shade' fraction is lessened by adjacency effects, because the scene has a non-zero reflectivity instead of the ideal black surface generally assumed...|$|E

40|$|Crossed {{diffraction}} gratings and random reflectors {{have been proposed}} as means to increase the quantum efficiencies of InGaAs/InP positive/intrinsic/ negative (PIN) diodes designed to operate as near-infrared photodetectors. The proposal is meant especially to apply to focal-plane imaging arrays of such photodetectors {{to be used for}} near-infrared imaging. A further increase in quantum efficiency near the short-wavelength limit of the near-infrared spectrum of such a photodetector array could be effected by removing the InP substrate of the array. The use of crossed {{diffraction gratings}} and random reflectors as optical devices for increasing the quantum efficiencies of quantum-well infrared photodetectors (QWIPs) was discussed in several prior NASA Tech Briefs articles. While the optical effects of crossed gratings and random reflectors as applied to PIN photodiodes would be similar to those of crossed gratings and random reflectors as applied to QWIPs, the physical mechanisms by which these optical effects would enhance efficiency differ between the PIN-photodiode and QWIP cases: In a QWIP, the multiple-quantum-well layers are typically oriented parallel to the focal plane and therefore perpendicular or nearly perpendicular to the direction of incidence of infrared light. By virtue of the applicable quantum selection rules, light polarized parallel to the focal plane (as normally incident light is) cannot excite charge carriers and, hence, cannot be detected. A pair of crossed gratings or a random reflector scatters normally or nearly normally incident light so that a significant portion of it attains a component of polarization normal to the focal plane and, hence, can excite charge carriers. A pair of crossed gratings or a random reflector on a PIN photodiode would also scatter light into directions away from the perpendicular to the focal plane. However, in this case, the reason for redirecting light away from the perpendicular is to increase the length of the optical path through the detector to increase the probability of absorption of photons and thereby increase the resulting excitation of charge carriers. A pair of crossed gratings or a random reflector according to the proposal would be fabricated {{as an integral part of}} photodetector structure on the face opposite the focal plane (see figure). In the presence of crossed gratings, light would make four passes through the device before departing. In the presence of a random reflector, a significant portion of the light would make more than four passes: After each <b>bounce,</b> <b>light</b> would be scattered at a different random angle, and would have a chance to escape only when it was reflected, relative to the normal, at an angle less than the critical angle for total internal reflection. Given the indices of refraction of the photodiode materials, this angle would be about 17. This amounts to a very narrow cone for escape of trapped light...|$|E

5000|$|This {{limitation}} {{depends on}} the mass [...] of the particle.To see how, note that we can measure {{the position of a}} particle by <b>bouncing</b> <b>light</b> off it - but measuring the position accurately requires light of short wavelength. Light with a short wavelength consists of photons of high energy. If the energy of these photons exceeds , when one hits the particle whose position is being measured the collision may yield enough energy to create a new particle of the same type. This renders moot the question of the original particle's location.|$|R
5000|$|The area to {{be photographed}} is lit by walls off-camera, which then provide {{illumination}} {{similar to that of}} a large window. When [...] "bounced" [...] off a ceiling, the lighting resembles that of fluorescent tubes. As this very broad, flat lighting is more typical of an overcast day outdoors, a more realistic interior illumination is achieved by reducing the power of additional lighting relative to the available light, so that either source may act as a fill to the other.

5000|$|You know, {{about seven}} or eight years after Pather Panchali was made, I read an article in American Cinematographer written by Sven Nykvist — at the time of Bergman's Through a Glass Darkly, I think — {{claiming}} the invention of <b>bounced</b> <b>light.</b> But we had been using it since 1954.
