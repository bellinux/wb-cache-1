25|$|Dear friends, Citizens of Sukhumi and Georgia! Georgia {{is facing}} the most {{difficult}} days, especially Sukhumi. Separatists and foreign invaders entered into the city. I am proud of your courage... Separatists and opportunists will be judged by history... They do not want Georgians {{to live in this}} Georgian city. Many of them dream to repeat the Gagra tragedy here... I know that you understand the challenge we are facing. I know how difficult the situation is. Many people left the city but you remain here for Sukhumi and for Georgia.... I call on you, citizens of Sukhumi, fighters, officers and generals: I understand the difficulties of being in your position now, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> right to step back, we all have to hold our ground. We have to fortify the city and save Sukhumi. I would like to tell you that all of us – Government of Abkhazia, Cabinet of Ministers, Mr. Zhiuli Shartava, his colleagues, the city and regional government of Sukhumi, are prepared for action. The enemy is aware of our readiness, that's why he is fighting in the most brutal way to destroy our beloved Sukhumi. I call on you to keep peace, tenacity and self-control. We have to meet the enemy in our streets as they deserve.|$|E
25|$|Tyndaris again bore a {{considerable}} {{part in the}} war between Sextus Pompeius and Octavian (36 BC). It {{was one of the}} points occupied and fortified by the former, when preparing for the defence of the Sicilian straits, but was taken by Agrippa after his naval victory at Mylae, and became one of his chief posts, from which he carried on offensive warfare against Pompey. Subsequently to this we hear nothing more of Tyndaris in history; but there is no doubt of its having continued to subsist throughout the period of the Roman Empire. Strabo speaks of it as one of the places on the north coast of Sicily which, in his time, still deserved the name of cities; and Pliny gives it the title of a Colonia. It is probable that it received a colony under Augustus, as we find it bearing in an inscription the titles of Colonia Augusta Tyndaritanorum. Pliny indeed mentions a great calamity which the city had sustained, when (he tells us) half of it was swallowed up by the sea, probably from an earthquake having caused the fall of part of the hill on which it stands, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> clue to the date of this event; The Itineraries attest the existence of Tyndaris, apparently still as {{a considerable}} place, in the fourth century.|$|E

2500|$|In 1998, Grammer filed {{a lawsuit}} against Internet Entertainment Group (IEG), which Grammer claimed had stolen from his home a {{videotape}} of him having sex with a woman. IEG countersued Grammer, denying it was in possession of such a tape, and Grammer's suit was eventually dropped. IEG President Seth Warshavsky later said, [...] "We have been presented with another Kelsey Grammer tape. <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> plans to air it. We are still evaluating it at this time." [...] Grammer later reflected, ...|$|E
2500|$|On 1–2 March 2008, rockets {{fired by}} Hamas from the Gaza Strip (some of them Grad rockets) hit Ashkelon, {{wounding}} seven, and causing property damage. Mayor Roni Mahatzri stated that [...] "This {{is a state}} of war, I know no other definition for it. If it lasts a week or two, we can handle that, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> intention of allowing this to become part of our daily routine." [...] In March 2008, 230 buildings and 30 cars were damaged by rocket fire on Ashkelon.|$|E
2500|$|The CLS {{maintained}} an independent existence throughout its existence. In 1935 it briefly flirted with dissolving into the Workers Party of the United States {{formed by the}} joining of forces of A.J. Muste's American Workers Party with Cannon's Communist League of America, a decision which was ultimately rejected. [...] "We shall not join the Workers Party, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> doubt but the best elements who may have gathered for the moment within the fields of the Workers Party will eventually find themselves fighting {{shoulder to shoulder with}} us," [...] the CLS declared.|$|E

60|$|As {{a matter}} of course it was {{necessary}} to stand over toward the opposite shore, which was not a pleasant piece of business since it carried us within view of the enemy; <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> choice in the matter.|$|R

2500|$|At Gamescom 2012, Sony Computer Entertainment {{announced}} Cross Buy, {{which offers}} the Vita {{version of a}} game for free to customers who purchase it on PlayStation 3. When asked by IGN about Cross Buy for Most Wanted, an EA spokesperson told [...] "We're taking it under consideration, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> specific plans to announce at this time."

2500|$|Nevertheless, Byzantine {{music is}} modal and entirely {{dependent}} on the Ancient Greek concept of harmonics. Its tonal system {{is based on a}} synthesis with ancient Greek models, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> sources left that explain to us how this synthesis was done. Carolingian cantors could mix the science of harmonics with a discussion of church tones, named after the ethnic names of the octave species and their transposition tropes, because they invented an own octoechos {{on the basis of the}} Byzantine one. But they made no use of earlier Pythagorean concepts tbat had been fundamental for Byzantine music, including: ...|$|E
2500|$|Over {{the next}} few years, while trying to perfect the polio vaccine, Salk had begun working unannounced, on a cure for cancer. A 1958 article in The New York Times {{confirmed}} [...] "that he had been conducting experiments on cancer patients." [...] The news was leaked after a Pittsburgh newspaper, the Sun-Telegraph, {{reported that he had}} been giving injections to children suffering from cancer. Salk stated afterwards, [...] "It is true that we have been conducting experiments in many persons with a variety of cancer and cancer-like conditions ... <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> treatment for cancer. Our studies are of a strictly exploratory nature..." [...] In 1965, he also said [...] "a vaccine for the common cold is a matter of time and of solving some technical problems." ...|$|E
60|$|We {{immediately}} assisted Jack {{to extricate}} himself; <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> time to congratulate ourselves on our narrow escape, for mingled shouts and yells {{from the men}} in the bushes ahead apprised us that some new danger menaced them in that direction.|$|R

60|$|<b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> time {{either for}} {{speculation}} or contemplation. Both Jack and I instantly took aim--he at the shoulder, as he afterwards told me; I at the monster's eye, into which, with, I am bound to confess, my usual precipitancy, I discharged both barrels.|$|R
2500|$|I {{know you}} need funds. We {{understand}} that and our {{opinion is that}} you should have the opportunity to rebuild your country. <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> opinion on the Arab-Arab conflicts, like your border disagreement with Kuwait. ... Frankly, we can only see that you have deployed massive troops in the south. Normally that would not be any of our business. But when this happens in the context of what you said on your national day, then when we read the details in the two letters of the Foreign Minister, then when we see the Iraqi point of view that the measures taken by the U.A.E. and Kuwait is, in the final analysis, parallel to military aggression against Iraq, then it would be reasonable for me to be concerned.|$|E

60|$|<b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> {{trouble at}} the settlement. Beyond refusing to sell us food, they left us to ourselves. The women and {{children}} stayed in the houses, and {{though some of the}} men appeared in sight they did not, as on former occasions, enter our camp and taunt us.|$|R
60|$|As <b>we</b> <b>had</b> {{not given}} this Chilian any notice of our coming, {{more than a}} quarter of an hour, we could not expect great matters of entertainment, and, as we carried our {{provision}} with us, we did not stand in much need of it; <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> reason to complain.|$|R
60|$|We did {{not wish}} to invite our friends to the camp. They would {{certainly}} have come <b>had</b> they known <b>we</b> were there, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> accommodations for them, neither <b>had</b> <b>we</b> any desire for even transient visitors. Besides, we both thought that we would prefer that our ex-boarder and his wife should not know that we were encamped on that little peninsula.|$|R

30|$|Our {{experience}} is that the SFF terms were relatively easy to employ when describing the FGC’s security function. It was not evident that a framework developed for straightforward products would also work for such a many-faceted development, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> problems when describing the security function. This study has thus reinforced {{the claim that the}} SFF is clearly expressed.|$|R
60|$|His Majesty was {{sensible}} of this, and <b>had</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>but</b> ten regiments of foot, {{would certainly}} have fought the Scots. <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> foot, or so few as was not worth while to march them. However, the king marched to Worcester, and the Scots, apprehending they should be blocked up, immediately raised the siege, pretending it was to go help their brethren in Scotland, and away they marched northwards.|$|R
60|$|On {{they came}} with a rush, and I fired too as fast as I could, and checked them--between us, Job and I, besides the woman, killed or mortally wounded five men with our pistols before they were emptied. <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> time to reload, and they still came on {{in a way that}} was almost splendid in its recklessness, seeing that they did not know <b>but</b> that <b>we</b> could go on firing for ever.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, sir, I do {{not live}} here. I am Steadfast Kenton, and I am from Elmwood, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> prayers nor sermon there since they took the parson away." ...|$|E

60|$|Hooja {{was drawing}} closer to us. There was no wind. We could {{not hope to}} outpaddle him. And with our sail gone, no wind would help us, though, as if in derision at our plight, a steady breeze was now blowing. <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> {{intention}} of sitting idle while our fate overtook us, so we bent to our paddles and, keeping parallel with the coast, did our best {{to pull away from}} our pursuers.|$|R
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> {{time for}} them. The yacht, {{completing}} the manoeuvre, {{headed into the}} wind with slatting canvas, and righted to an even keel. We were still plunging ahead, and directly in our path was the skiff. I saw Big Alec dive overboard and his mate leap for our bowsprit. Then came the crash as we struck the boat, {{and a series of}} grinding bumps as it passed under our bottom.|$|R
