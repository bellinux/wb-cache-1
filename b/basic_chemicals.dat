2500|$|Carl Edward Sagan ( [...] ; November 9, 1934 – December 20, 1996) was an American astronomer, cosmologist, astrophysicist, astrobiologist, author, science popularizer, {{and science}} {{communicator}} in astronomy {{and other natural}} sciences.

His best known scientific contribution is research on extraterrestrial life, including experimental demonstration of the production of amino acids from <b>basic</b> <b>chemicals</b> by radiation. Sagan assembled the first physical messages sent into space: the Pioneer plaque and the Voyager Golden Record, universal messages that could potentially be understood by any extraterrestrial intelligence that might find them. Sagan argued the now accepted hypothesis that the high surface temperatures of Venus can be attributed to and calculated using the greenhouse effect.|$|E

2500|$|Sarnia, Ontario was Dow's first {{manufacturing}} site in Canada, {{located in the}} Chemical Valley area alongside other petrochemical companies. In 1942, the Canadian government invited Dow to build a plant there to produce styrene (an essential raw material used to make synthetic rubber for World War II). Dow then built a polystyrene plant in 1947. In August 1985, the site accidentally discharged 11,000 litres of perchloroethylene (a carcinogenic dry cleaning chemical) into the St. Clair River, which gained infamy in the media as [...] "The Blob", and Dow Canada was charged by the Ministry of the Environment. Up to the early 1990s, Dow Canada's headquarters was located at the Modeland Centre, and a new three-story complex called the River Centre was opened up on the Sarnia site in 1993 to house Research and Development. Since then, several plants (Dow terminology for a production unit) on the site have been dismantled, particularly the <b>Basic</b> <b>Chemicals</b> including Chlor Alkali unit whose closure was announced in 1991 and carried out in 1994 which affected {{nearly half of the}} site's employees. The Dow Canada headquarters were moved to Calgary, Alberta in 1996, and the Modeland Centre was sold to Lambton County and the City of Sarnia with Dow leasing some office space. [...] The Dow Fitness Centre was donated to the YMCA of Sarnia-Lambton in 2003. The Sarnia Site's workforce declined from a peak of 1600 personnel in the early 1990s to about 400 by 2002. In the late 1990s, land on the site was sold to TransAlta which built a natural gas power plant that begun operations in 2002 to supply electricity to the remaining Sarnia site plants and facilities, so that Dow could close its older less efficient steam plant (originally coal fired and later burning natural gas). On August 31, 2006, Dow announced that the entire Sarnia site would cease operations at the end of 2008. The Sarnia site had been supplied with ethylene through a pipeline from western Canada but BP officials warned Dow that shipments from the pipeline had to be suspended for safety reasons, and the loss of an affordable supply for the low density polyethylene plant rendered all the other operations at the site non-competitive. The Low-Density Polyethylene and Polystyrene units closed in 2006, followed by the Latex Unit in 2008, and finally the Propylene Oxide Derivatives Unit on April 2009. Dow afterward focused its efforts on the environmental remediation of the vacant site, which was sold to TransAlta. The former site has since been renamed the Bluewater Energy Park, with the River Centre remaining available for lease.|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} <b>basic</b> <b>chemical</b> models is introduced, which is new from the {{standpoint}} of the physics of nonideal atomic plasma. This concept is based on the requirement of full conformity of the expression for free energy in the chemical model of plasma to exact asymptotic expansions obtained in the grand canonical ensemble within the physical model of plasma. The thermodynamic functions and equations of state and ionization equilibrium are obtained for three <b>basic</b> <b>chemical</b> models differing from one another by the choice of the atomic partition function. Comparison is made with the experimental results for nonideal plasma of cesium and inert gases. It is demonstrated that the best fit to experiment is shown by the results obtained using a <b>basic</b> <b>chemical</b> model with atomic partition function in the nearest neighbor approximation with classical determination of the size of excited atom.
