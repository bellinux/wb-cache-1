25|$|The {{following}} example {{should make}} this clearer. In Figure 3, the <b>black</b> <b>dot</b> indicates {{the point where}} the path first crosses the diagonal. The black edge is X, and we swap the red portion with the green portion to make a new path, shown in the second diagram.|$|E
25|$|Notice {{that the}} {{exceedance}} {{has dropped from}} three to two. In fact, the algorithm will cause the exceedance to decrease by one, for any path that we feed it, because the first vertical step starting on the diagonal (at the point marked with a <b>black</b> <b>dot)</b> is the unique vertical edge that under the operation passes from above the diagonal to below it; all other vertical edges stay {{on the same side}} of the diagonal.|$|E

Most of the macular black markings are obscure, being only the spots on the underside seen by the transparency of the wing membrane; the inner edge of the black terminal band crenulate.|$|E
25|$|In {{intraspecific}} encounters, {{the effect}} of raising the forelegs is to bring the other spider to an abrupt halt, {{whether it be a}} wandering conspecific, a courting male preparing to touch the female, or a female stalking or about to jump at the male. Indeed, raising of the forelegs appears to have this 'stop-sign' effect even in encounters between congenerics of the three Phidippus species. Drees, working with female Salticus scenicus, was able to initiate hunting behavior by moving a <b>black</b> <b>dot</b> along a white wall, and to stop the pursuing spider by moving wires projecting {{from the side of the}} model through an angle that imitated the waving of the forelegs.|$|E
25|$|Two {{years before}} their ascent, Grove had {{stood in the}} Hotel Royal in Chamouni (Chamonix), trying to persuade two young ladies and their father, who were using a {{telescope}} to view the peaks around Mont Blanc, that a <b>black</b> <b>dot</b> on the summit snowfield was not a person, but a distant rock some hundreds of feet in height. By chance they espied a real group of climbers, appearing as extremely small dots making {{their way across the}} Dôme du Goûter. Attempting to devise for them some imaginary route by which they might have reached that point, Grove showed them the fine snow crest descending in a gentle curve from the sharp and still unclimbed summit of the Aiguille de Bionnassay. The thought then struck him that an expedition to the summit, with an exit down the eastern ridge towards the easy Dôme du Goûter might actually make a fine undertaking.|$|E

25|$|Consider {{a generic}} example {{in which the}} initial {{transition}} state along a concerted pathway is represented by a <b>black</b> <b>dot</b> on a red diagonal (Figure 1). Changing {{the height of the}} corners can have two effects on the position of the transition state: it can move along the diagonal, reflecting a change in the Gibbs free energy of the reaction (ΔG°), or perpendicular to it, reflecting a change in the energy of competing pathways. Thus, in accordance with the Hammond postulate, the transition state moves along the diagonal towards the corner that is raised in energy (a Hammond effect) and perpendicular to the diagonal towards the corner that is lowered (an anti-Hammond effect). In this example, R is raised in energy and I(2) is lowered in energy. The transition state moves accordingly and the vector sum of both movements gives the real change in its position.|$|E
25|$|Cutaneous anthrax {{infection}} in humans shows up as a boil-like skin lesion that eventually forms an ulcer {{with a black}} center (eschar), often beginning as an irritating and itchy skin lesion or blister that is dark and usually concentrated as a <b>black</b> <b>dot.</b> Cutaneous infections generally form within the site of spore penetration between two and five days after exposure. Without treatment about 20% of cutaneous skin infection cases progress to toxemia and death. Respiratory {{infection in}} humans initially presents with cold or flu-like symptoms for several days, followed by severe (and often fatal) respiratory collapse. Historical mortality was 92%. Gastrointestinal infection in humans is most often caused by eating anthrax-infected meat and is characterized by serious gastrointestinal difficulty, vomiting of blood, severe diarrhea, acute inflammation of the intestinal tract, and loss of appetite. After the bacteria invades the bowel system, it spreads through the bloodstream throughout the body, making more toxins on the way.|$|E
25|$|His main {{contribution}} to violin-making was {{his work on}} varnish. The purfling's joints are often cut on the straight {{and not on the}} bias as was traditional, in the middle in the pin. His brand is burnt at a length of 1cm. There is generally a <b>black</b> <b>dot</b> on the joint of the top under the bridge. He used an external mould. The stop is generally 193mm long. In this respect he follows to the French 18th-century tradition of a short stop (190mm), which was traditionally 195mm long in Italy and even 200mm long in Germany. The violin's serial number is inscribed in the middle inside the instrument. Its date (only the last two figures) in the upper paraph on the back. His violins of the first period have large edges and his brand was then burnt inside the middle bouts. The varnish varied from orange-red to red. After 1860, his varnish became lighter.|$|E

25|$|Band cups have {{a softer}} {{transition}} between {{the body and}} the rim. The decoration {{is in the form of}} a band circling the cup exterior and can frequently be a very elaborate frieze. In the case of this form the rim is coated with a glossy black slip. The interior retains the color of the clay, except for a <b>black</b> <b>dot</b> painted in the center. Variations include Droop cups and Kassel cups. Droop cups have black, concave lips and a high foot. As with classic band cups the rim is left black, but the area below it is decorated with ornaments like leaves, buds, palmettes, dots, nimbuses or animals on the cup exterior. Kassel cups are a small form, squatter than other Little Masters cups, and the entire exterior is decorated. As in the case of Droop cups, primarily ornaments are painted. Famous Little Masters are the potters Phrynos, Sokles, Tleson and Ergoteles, the latter two being sons of the potter Nearchos. Hermogenes invented a Little Master variety of skyphos now known as a Hermogenes skyphos. The Phrynos Painter, Taleides Painter, Xenokles Painter and the Group of Rhodes 12264 should also be mentioned here.|$|E

500|$|In {{the early}} years of World War II, German U-boats often escaped attack by {{aircraft}} because they spotted the aircraft while it was still far away as a <b>black</b> <b>dot</b> in the sky, no matter what camouflage colors were used. To solve this problem, in 1943 the U.S. Navy, following the Canadian diffused lighting camouflage trials on warships, conducted secret experiments on counter-illumination in the Yehudi lights project. Sealed beam lights were mounted on {{the leading edge of the}} wing of a Grumman TBM-3D Avenger, and around its engine cowling, with the lamps facing forward. The intensity of the lamps was adjusted to match the background sky as seen from an observer in a surface ship. Aircraft with Yehudi lights were not detected until [...] away under conditions where aircraft without the lights were detected [...] away. Though successful, the system was not put into production because of improved radar detection.|$|E

500|$|Blek is {{a puzzle}} {{game in which}} the player draws a [...] "snake-like" [...] black line on the screen that is {{recorded}} and played back like a pattern, recurring repeatedly across the screen. The object is {{to draw a line}} that it will remove colored dot targets when it repeats across the screen without hitting a <b>black</b> <b>dot.</b> Lines that travel off the top or bottom of the screen reset the level, while lines that travel off the left or right of the screen reflect back towards the dots. Aside from repeating the player's drawn pattern, the stroke mimics the player's pace in drawing the stroke. The game begins with no prompt or tutorial other than to use a finger on the screen and experiment. The first puzzles are [...] "on open, white canvasses" [...] where the player can solve the simple puzzles [...] "by accident". The 80 levels progress in difficulty and require more complex solutions. Added elements include a [...] "chain reaction" [...] dot that launches other dots when struck. Its sound consists of a [...] "whoosh" [...] that accompanies the traveling stroke, a [...] "chime" [...] when colored dots are hit, and a human [...] "disappointed grumble" [...] when black dots are hit, resetting the level. The game is depicted in flat, plain colors, with no pause feature and no option menu other than Game Center achievements. Players navigate between puzzles using three small onscreen icons. There are no in-app purchases or in-game advertisements.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the morning}} of 8 June, Odell awoke at 6:00 AM, {{reporting}} that the night was largely free of wind and that he slept well. [...] At 8:00 AM, Odell started an ascent to Camp VI to make geological studies and to support Mallory and Irvine. The mountain was swept by mists so {{he could not see}} the NE Ridge clearly along which Mallory and Irvine intended to climb. At 7900m (26,000-ft) he climbed over a small outcropping. At 12:50, the mists suddenly cleared. [...] Odell noted in his diary, [...] "saw M & I on the ridge, nearing base of final pyramide". In a first report on 5 July to The Times he clarified this view. Odell was excited about having found the first fossils on Everest when there was a clearing in the weather and he saw the summit ridge and final pyramid of Everest. His eyes caught a tiny <b>black</b> <b>dot</b> which moved on a small snowcrest beneath a rock-step on the ridge. A second <b>black</b> <b>dot</b> was moving toward the first one. The first dot reached the crest of the ridge ("broke skyline"). He could not be certain if the second dot also did so.|$|E
