5|$|Ruisdael's first Scandinavian views contain big firs, rugged mountains, large {{boulders}} and rushing torrents. Though convincingly realistic, they are <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>previous</b> art works, {{rather than on}} direct experience. There is no record that Ruisdael made any trip to Scandinavia, although fellow Haarlem painter van Everdingen had travelled there in 1644 and had popularised the subgenre. Ruisdael's work soon outstripped van Everdingen's finest efforts. In total Ruisdael produced more than 150 Scandinavian views featuring waterfalls, of which Waterfall in a Mountainous Landscape with a Ruined Castle, 1665–1670, is seen as his greatest by Slive.|$|E
5|$|Only {{days after}} the breakup, Tweedy decided {{to form a new}} group. He was able to retain the lineup of Uncle Tupelo sans Farrar, and rechristened the band Wilco. In mid-May, the band began to rehearse songs in the office of band manager Tony Margherita, and hired {{producer}} Brian Paulson, who produced Anodyne. Wilco first recorded demo tracks for the album at Easley studio in Memphis, Tennessee, in June. Stirratt recommended the studio <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>previous</b> experience as a member of The Hilltops, and Tweedy had heard of the studio through a Jon Spencer Blues Explosion recording. Reprise Records, a subsidiary of Warner Brothers, signed Jeff Tweedy after hearing the tapes, and recording for the album continued through August.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} project became controversial as environmental protection non-governmental organizations (NGOs) drew public {{attention to a}} possible threat that may arise to seven species of bats. Subsequently, the NGOs alleged that the project is illegal, environmentally unsafe, financially not feasible, and technically questionable. Project legality was disputed because {{it is based on}} a 1999 environmental impact assessment (EIA), while Croatian legislation requires that EIAs must not be more than two years old. Flooding of Vilina Cave is cited as an environmental concern, while the financial issues are <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>previous</b> cost overruns by Hrvatska elektroprivreda—the state-owned company planning the development—in other projects. One objection to the technical aspects of the project is the possibility that the groundwater may trigger earthquakes. Opponents of the project have urged the Prime Minister of Croatia to cancel development of the plant.|$|E
5|$|On October10, Hazel slowed in {{the central}} Caribbean and turned sharply to the {{north-northeast}} toward Hispaniola, steered by an upper-level low. At 09:00UTC on October12, the hurricane made landfall near Chardonnières along the Tiburon Peninsula of Haiti as a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale. There were no strong wind readings at landfall, but <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>previous</b> radar and aircraft observations the sustained winds were officially estimated at 120mph (195km/h). After moving through the Gulf of Gonâve, Hazel struck northwestern Haiti near Baie-de-Henne at 00:00UTC on October13, as a Category 2 hurricane with winds estimated at 100mph (160km/h). Around that time, the hurricane curved more {{to the north and}} northwest due to an approaching trough, and the Hurricane Hunters resumed entering the center of Hazel, reporting an eye and hurricane force winds. At 14:00UTC on October13, Hazel struck Inagua in the Bahamas with winds of 100mph (160km/h).|$|E
5|$|On {{its first}} advisory, there was {{disagreement}} among forecast models regarding its eventual track, with projected tracks deviating from a Georgia landfall to a track northeastward out to sea. Alpha {{was also a}} climatological outlier at the time; the NHC HURRAN model, which was <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>previous</b> storms with similar characteristics, found no analogs for the storm. Subtropical Storm Alpha was initially well-defined as it moved southwestward. The very small center was located along {{the eastern edge of}} the convection, while low-level cloud bands formed east of the center. At the time, the temperature structure was more typical of a winter storm, although it was expected to become more like a subtropical storm typical during the summer months. The winds decreased steadily as it turned more westward on May 27, and the heavy rainfall persisted mostly to the north and west of the center.|$|E

25|$|An {{isomorphism}} of the Möbius {{group with}} the Lorentz group was noted by several authors: <b>Based</b> <b>on</b> <b>previous</b> work of Felix Klein (1893, 1897) on automorphic functions related to hyperbolic geometry and Möbius geometry, Gustav Herglotz (1909) showed that hyperbolic motions (i.e. isometric automorphisms of a hyperbolic space) transforming the unit sphere into itself correspond to Lorentz transformations, by which Herglotz was able to classify the one-parameter Lorentz transformations into loxodromic, elliptic, hyperbolic and parabolic groups. Other authors include Emil Artin (1957), H. S. M. Coxeter (1965) and by Roger Penrose and Wolfgang Rindler (1984).|$|E

25|$|First, optimal oligo {{length for}} the {{transfected}} linear DNA should be between 60 and 90 base pairs. This guideline is <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>previous</b> observations that this length {{has the highest}} allelic replacement efficiency. Longer oligos are prone to forming hairpin structures that are not only inhibitory, but also are more expensive to synthesize. Shorter oligos have lower hybridization energies, resulting in decreased stability of the oligo to the chromosomal target. Of this sequence, at least 15 base pairs should be homologous to the target sequence at both the 5’ and 3’ ends to provide sufficient oligo annealing.|$|E
