5|$|Most ships {{had their}} director-control tower and {{rangefinder}} above the bridge removed {{in exchange for}} a Type 271 target-indication radar. A Type 286 short-range surface search radar, adapted from the Royal Air Force's ASV radar, was also added. The early models, however, could only scan directly forward and had to be aimed <b>by</b> <b>turning</b> <b>the</b> entire ship. Some ships also received a Huff-Duff radio direction finder on a short mainmast.|$|E
5|$|The killer—Willi Borgsen (Van Quattro)—is next seen attacking pigs in {{a trailer}} using a cattle prod. Borgsen is accosted by the pigs' owner, and {{responds}} <b>by</b> <b>turning</b> <b>the</b> cattle prod on him. The victim's body is later found in a nearby thicket. Black examines the scene, determining from the bootprints and evidence of the cattle prod being used that the killer works in a slaughterhouse.|$|E
5|$|Alternative views {{have been}} {{expressed}} that the amendments were not seeking {{to replace the}} common law of judicial review. Instead, they borrowed from the common law <b>by</b> <b>turning</b> <b>the</b> clock back, and merely clarified the limits of judicial power {{in relation to the}} ISA. It has also been noted that the amendments do not compel the application of Lee Mau Seng, a High Court decision. If Lee Mau Seng is wrong, the Court of Appeal can still overrule it now.|$|E

5|$|Some {{cylinder}} valve models have axial spindles - {{in line with}} the cylinder axis, and are not handed. Standard side-spindle valves have the valve knob on the diver's right side when back-mounted. Side-spindle valves used with manifolds must be a handed pair - one with the knob to the right and the other with the knob to the left, but in all cases the valve is opened <b>by</b> <b>turning</b> <b>the</b> knob anticlockwise, and closed by turning it clockwise. This is the convention with almost all valves for all purposes. Left hand side-spindle valves are used by sidemount divers.|$|E
5|$|In the Battle of Beersheba in October 1917, it {{was again}} Chauvel and his Desert Mounted Corps that had the {{critical}} role. Chetwode believed that the EEF {{did not have the}} resources to defeat the Turks in their fixed positions so he planned to drive the Turks from them <b>by</b> <b>turning</b> <b>the</b> enemy flank at Beersheba, in a waterless area on the flank of the enemy line. The Desert Mounted Corps would have a long overnight approach over waterless desert and would have to capture the town with its wells intact or be forced to retreat. The Battle of Beersheba went right down to the line, but the mission was accomplished, albeit not without a mounted infantry bayonet charge by the 4th Light Horse Brigade– the last of history's great cavalry charges– to capture the town and its vital water supply. Few battles have been won in such spectacular fashion. For this decisive victory, and the subsequent capture of Jerusalem, Chauvel was mentioned in despatches twice more, and appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in the 1918 New Year Honours List.|$|E

5|$|The Mary Rose {{represented}} a transitional ship design in naval warfare. Since ancient times, war at sea had been fought {{much like that}} on land: with melee weapons and bows and arrows, but on floating wooden platforms rather than battlefields. Though the introduction of guns was a significant change, it only slowly changed the dynamics of ship-to-ship combat. As guns became heavier and able to take more powerful gunpowder charges, {{they needed to be}} placed lower in the ship, closer to the water line. Gunports cut in the hull of ships had been introduced as early as 1501, only about a decade before the Mary Rose was built. This made broadsides, coordinated volleys from all the guns on one side of a ship, possible {{for the first time in}} history, at least in theory. Naval tactics throughout the 16th century and well into the 17th century focused on countering the oar-powered galleys that were armed with heavy guns in the bow, facing forwards, which were aimed <b>by</b> <b>turning</b> <b>the</b> entire ship against its target. Combined with inefficient gunpowder and the difficulties inherent in firing accurately from moving platforms, this meant that boarding remained the primary tactic for decisive victory throughout the 16th century.|$|E
5|$|The {{turning point}} of the match came with ten minutes left. After a period of fluent {{football}} by the Arsenal forwards which saw Smith hit the woodwork and Hayes, Thomas and Rocastle all had shots saved by Dibble, Arsenal were awarded a penalty after Rocastle was fouled in the box. Dibble saved Winterburn's spot-kick <b>by</b> <b>turning</b> <b>the</b> ball round the post. A newly inspired Luton equalised with seven minutes remaining when Caesar mis-kicked a clearance {{on the edge of}} his penalty area, enabling Luton's Wilson to head the ball into the Arsenal goal from a Mark Stein cross. With less than a minute to go, Adams fouled Mark Stein, and from the resulting free kick, Brian Stein scored his second goal of the match to put the game beyond the reach of the defending champions.|$|E

25|$|A {{disadvantage}} {{of the standard}} GBI setup is the sensitivity to only one component of the phase gradient, which is the direction parallel to the 1-D gratings.

Promotion has the effect of changing how the piece moves (see the table above for what each piece promotes to), and is effected <b>by</b> <b>turning</b> <b>the</b> piece over after it moves, revealing the name of its promoted rank. Promotion for pieces able to do so is both compulsory and permanent.|$|E

25|$|Muslims {{who were}} living in provinces where they were demographically a minority, such as the United Provinces where the Muslim League enjoyed popular support, were assured by Jinnah that they could remain in India, migrate to Pakistan or {{continue}} living in India but as Pakistani citizens. The Muslim League had also proposed the hostage population theory. According to this theory the safety of India's Muslim minority would be ensured <b>by</b> <b>turning</b> <b>the</b> Hindu minority in the proposed Pakistan into a 'hostage' population who would be visited by retributive violence if Muslims in India were harmed.|$|E
25|$|Promotion is {{effected}} <b>by</b> <b>turning</b> <b>the</b> piece {{over after}} it moves, revealing {{the name of}} its promoted rank.

A rook obtained by promoting a gold differs from an original rook, though, by that the latter can still promote (to dragon horse), while the former cannot.|$|E
