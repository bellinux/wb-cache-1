25|$|We {{would meet}} monthly, listen to up-and-coming concert artists and {{give money to}} deserving artists for further study. A very young Kathleen Battle sang for us. The other judges thought her voice was too small, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> she had an {{incredible}} ability to communicate through music. I talked the other judges into giving her a grant.|$|E
500|$|His sister Geraldine {{expressed}} {{that she found}} it hard to accept the reality of his death, commenting, [...] "I don't think he made it. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> if they would let me fly over and see for myself that Harry's lodge is gone, then maybe I'd believe it for sure." ...|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Liquorice" [...] {{contains}} [...] "Harlem-street-slang-derived wordplay", {{which comes}} from Banks' origin, Harlem (for example: [...] "skrilla" [...] means [...] "money", and [...] "ye" [...] stands for [...] "cocaine"). The song is also inspired by interracial dating; Banks explained: [...] "I date lots of white guys. It's still seen as slightly taboo in African American culture, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> 'Let me put this in your face and tell it how it is.'" ...|$|E

500|$|When Du Bois became {{editor of}} The Crisis {{magazine}} in 1911, {{he joined the}} Socialist Party of America {{on the advice of}} NAACP founders Mary Ovington, William English Walling and Charles Edward Russell. However, he supported the Democrat Woodrow Wilson in the 1912 presidential campaign, a breach of the rules, and was forced to resign from the Socialist Party. Du Bois remained: [...] "convinced that socialism was an excellent way of life, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> it might be reached by various methods." ...|$|E
500|$|Initially {{there was}} {{confusion}} {{as to what}} would happen next. Keith Brown, the race starter, was interviewed briefly by the BBC and alluded {{to the possibility that}} the nine jockeys who noticed and obeyed his recall could be eligible {{to take part in a}} re-run. Several jockeys said that they thought the officials attempting to stop them were actually protestors. Esha Ness's jockey John White said of the latter stages of the race: [...] "I could see there were only a few horses around, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> the others had fallen or something." ...|$|E
500|$|Jagger told Stephen Schiff in a 1992 Vanity Fair profile: [...] "I wasn't {{trying to}} be rebellious in those days; I was just being me. I wasn't trying to push the edge of anything. I'm being me and ordinary, the guy from {{suburbia}} who sings in this band, but someone older might {{have thought it was}} just the most awful racket, the most terrible thing, and where are we going if this is music?... But all those songs we sang were pretty tame, really. People didn't think they were, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> they were tame." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; uncle {{told me so}} months ago. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> never <b>thought</b> {{then that}} he would not live till Walter came of age, and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> that it was a mere form." ...|$|R

500|$|Once Hay {{returned}} to the United States in early August, he went to The Fells and watched from afar as Bryan barnstormed the nation in his campaign while McKinley gave speeches from his front porch. [...] Despite an invitation from the candidate, Hay was reluctant to visit McKinley {{at his home in}} Canton. [...] "He has asked me to come, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> I would not struggle with the millions on his trampled lawn". [...] In October, after basing himself at his Cleveland home and giving a speech for McKinley, Hay went to Canton at last, writing to Adams, ...|$|E
500|$|Stoddart went, aged seventeen, {{to train}} in fine {{art at the}} Glasgow School of Art where he studied from 1976 to 1980. There he settled on {{sculpture}} and initially worked within the modernist idiom. Stoddart has recalled an epiphany moment several times: when, after finishing a riveted metal pop-art sculpture (praised by his tutors) he found a bust of the Apollo Belvedere, [...] "I thought my pop-riveted thing was rubbish by comparison. It's extraordinarily easy to pop-rivet two bits of metal together and extraordinarily difficult to make a figure like the Apollo, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> I had to try." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{recording}} engineer for the album, Brooks Arthur, [...] remembered the sessions in 2009: [...] "A cloud came along, {{and it was}} called the Van Morrison sessions. We all hopped upon that cloud, and the cloud took us away , and we made this album, and we landed when it was done." [...] In a Rolling Stone interview in 1972, Morrison told John Grissim, Jr.: [...] "I was really pretty happy with the album. [...] The only complaint I had was that it was rather rushed. [...] <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> it was closer to the type of music I wanted to put out. [...] And still is, actually." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{was greatly}} alarmed at Jack's speech; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> confess <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> less {{of what he}} said than of the earnest, anxious manner in which he said it, and it was with very uncomfortable {{feelings}} that Peterkin and I followed him quickly into the woods.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, many a time I've {{looked at}} people smoking, and <b>thought</b> well <b>I</b> wish I could do that; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> never <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> could," [...] said Tom.|$|R
6000|$|... "Have you, indeed! I am {{very sorry}} for it; <b>but</b> really <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> was in very good time. It is <b>but</b> just one. <b>I</b> hope {{you have not been}} here long?" ...|$|R
500|$|In the film, {{she plays}} Eli, a child vampire who {{develops}} {{a friendship with}} the main character, 12-year-old Oskar (played by Kåre Hedebrant). Oskar is frequently tormented by bullies. Eli initially tells Oskar to fight back, and rescues him in the end, killing three of the bullies in process. Because Eli {{is supposed to be}} an androgynous character in the film, director Tomas Alfredson decided to overdub Leandersson's voice with a less feminine one. [...] "Lina's voice is beautiful, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> it was too high in pitch", he said. Eli's voice throughout the whole film was provided by Elif Ceylan. In an interview with Dagens Nyheter, Leandersson laughingly commented that [...] "it was actually nice to be dubbed, my voice sounds weird".|$|E
500|$|The {{voice of}} Gipsy Danger's {{artificial}} intelligence system. Del Toro secured permission from Valve Corporation to cast McLain in homage to GLaDOS, her homicidal AI {{character in the}} Portal video games. The director stated: [...] "It {{was clear to me}} that we needed something beautiful in that voice. My daughter is my wingman, we had done co-op on Portal 2 {{for a long time and}} I did Portal 1 when it came out. It becomes ingrained in you, that voice. I didn't want to use her as a negative force of evil. I called Valve and asked 'Can you give us the filter?' so we went full GLaDOS for the first commercial, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> it was too much. If you're a gamer, it's too distracting so we created our own GLaDOS 2.0 filter that's a little less full-on." ...|$|E
500|$|Morrison {{signed a}} {{contract}} with Bert Berns, and just before he left for New York made a speech to his friends and ended with: [...] "One day you'll see my picture up on the wall and you'll all say 'I knew him'." [...] An acquaintance who witnessed the speech told the author: [...] "He knew he was different and that his music was good <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> he was such a nasty character; always rude and quite vulgar." [...] Morrison recorded the song [...] "Brown Eyed Girl" [...] in New York with Berns, as well as the album Astral Weeks. He became much more popular with the album Moondance, and Rolling Stone commented he had [...] "the striking imagination of a consciousness that is visionary in the strongest sense of the word". Morrison's image appeared on the cover of Rolling Stone a year after releasing Moondance.|$|E

500|$|Armstrong {{prepared}} {{his famous}} epigram on his own. In a post-flight press conference, {{he said that}} he decided on the words [...] "just prior to leaving the LM [...]" [...] In a 1983 interview in Esquire Magazine, Armstrong explained to George Plimpton: [...] "I always knew there was a good chance of being able to return to Earth, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> the chances of a successful touchdown on the moon surface were about even money—fifty–fifty... Most people don't realize how difficult the mission was. So it didn't seem to me there was much point in thinking of something to say if we'd have to abort landing." [...] In 2012, brother Dean Armstrong claimed that Neil had shown him a note with a draft of the line months before the launch, although historian Andrew Chaikin, who had interviewed the astronaut in 1988 for his book A Man on the Moon, disputed that he had ever claimed coming up with the line spontaneously during the mission.|$|E
500|$|Casino Royale {{had been}} {{produced}} as a 1954 television episode and a 1967 satirical film. [...] Eon Productions gained {{the rights to}} Casino Royale in 1999 after Sony Pictures Entertainment exchanged them for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's rights to Spider-Man. In March 2004, Neal Purvis and Robert Wade began writing a screenplay for Pierce Brosnan as Bond, aiming {{to bring back the}} flavour of Ian Fleming's original Bond novels. Paul Haggis' main contribution was to rewrite the climax of the film. He explained, [...] "the draft that was there was very faithful to the book and there was a confession, so in the original draft the character confessed and killed herself. She then sent Bond to chase after the villains; Bond chased the villains into the house. I don't know why <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> that Vesper had to be in the sinking house and Bond has to want to kill her and then try and save her." ...|$|E
500|$|Writer Rob LaZebnik {{told the}} New York Post that the episode was {{inspired}} by his son Johnny, who came out as gay while at high school: [...] "I am a Midwestern guy, so I don’t tend to wear my emotions on my sleeve, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> 'What better way to tell my son I love him than to write a cartoon about it?'". He added that he pitched the storyline three years earlier, and got approval for his script from his son. Smithers' coming out is low-key, as was Johnny's; he told the Post that as he was [...] "the gayest little kid", his parents were not surprised by his sexual orientation. The episode aired five days before Johnny's 22nd birthday, {{and he said he}} would have a viewing party because the episode would be [...] "particularly meaningful" [...] to him. The elder LaZebnik stated his opinion that LGBT-related television can have a [...] "real impact on people's thinking".|$|E
6000|$|... "Understand me rightly," [...] he said: [...] "the church-warden {{proposed}} it to me, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> had <b>thought</b> {{myself of}} getting--Miss Day to play." ...|$|R

500|$|Though {{some critics}} {{appreciated}} how Fringe chose {{to end the}} finale with {{a shot of the}} World Trade Center, others disliked it. Jeff Pinkner defended their decision by explaining they chose it because the building is [...] "obviously very iconic" [...] and it best displayed that in the parallel universe, [...] "things are both better and in some ways worse. It's just different choices, the road not taken". Leonard Nimoy also defended the writers, commenting that when he received the script, he thought it [...] "was very interesting and really kind of daring contemporary television to pull in that story... You know, it's not easy to use that kind of stuff without seeming somehow exploitive. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> they did it very, very well". Many critics expressed that because of the episode, they couldn't wait for the following season to begin. IGN's Ramsey Isler rated the episode 9.2/10, while website blogger io9 listed [...] "There's More Than One of Everything" [...] as one of the [...] "crucial" [...] episodes new viewers must watch to get into the show.|$|E
500|$|In late 2000, Aguilera {{started to}} record her then-upcoming material. The {{recording}} sessions {{took place in}} studios around California and New York City, including Electric Lady Studios in New York, The Enterprise Studios in Burbank, California, Conway Recording Studios, The Record Plant and NRG Recording Studios in Hollywood. According to Aguilera, the recording sessions were much longer than she thought. She further explained that lots of things came up during that time, including her first break-up with her first boyfriend Jorge Santos. Aguilera also believed that the lyrics of Stripped were so personal, and her vocals [...] "represent a rawer, more bare-bones approach as well, with less of the ostentatious riffing that has miffed critics in the past". She stated, [...] "I did the vocal gymnastics thing because it was fun. That's why I like blues, too, because you can experiment more with that side of your voice. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> the lyrics on this record are so personal, deep and good that I wanted to make them stand out more than what I could do with my voice technically".|$|E
500|$|Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish {{was adamant}} that his players would improve {{following}} the defeat: [...] "They've been in two cup finals {{in this season}} – they'll have enjoyed the first one more than the second, the lads {{will benefit from the}} experience. You can't give a team like Chelsea a two-goal head start." [...] When asked about his future as manager of the club Dalglish stated: [...] "We'll assess the season {{at the end of the}} season." [...] Captain Steven Gerrard echoed Dalglish's sentiments: [...] "With the players we have in that dressing room, we could have done better. But we are Liverpool. We will bounce back. We will strengthen in the summer and come back fighting again. That's what Liverpool Football Club does." [...] Striker Andy Carroll, who scored one goal and had another disallowed, thought the ball had crossed the line: [...] "I thought it was over the line and you know better than me <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> it was. I thought it hit the other side of the bar but I haven't seen it back." ...|$|E
