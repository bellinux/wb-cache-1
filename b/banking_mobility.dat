5000|$|A 2012 study {{commissioned}} by the World Health Organization identifies the Israeli Military's blockades of the West Bank and Gaza Strip as a major health challenge. In both Gaza and the West Bank, restriction of movement is such that individuals cannot exit these respective regions without the permission of Israeli authorities. [...] Hospitals in the West Bank and in Gaza are sometimes not {{equipped to deal with}} more advanced medical problems and procedures. In such cases, doctors will refer their patients to more sophisticated treatment centers in Israel. Such treatment is often delayed by the Israeli bureaucratic process which has to approve requests. Even in true emergency cases, ambulances traveling from the Palestinian territories to hospitals in east Jerusalem are often delayed or denied at security checkpoints in a manner that places patients at risk.Moreover, within the West <b>Bank,</b> <b>mobility</b> is limited as residents must pass through Israeli checkpoints in order to travel in between various West Bank cities. This means that West Bank residents have trouble accessing health care providers located in other nearby West Bank towns. The limited mobility has even more serious ramifications in emergency situations wherein ambulances traveling in between West Bank towns experience delays.|$|R
40|$|The classic channel slope-discharge {{relationship}} {{proposed by}} LEOPOLD & WOLMAN (1957) for channel pattern discrimination {{has been tested}} by a large database including 4 types of rivers: gravel-bed meandering rivers, gravel-bed braided rivers, sand-bed meandering rivers and sand-bed braided rivers. The result shows that the Leopold-Wolman relationship cannot discriminate channel patterns well when both gravel- and sand-bed rivers are considered. It is indicated that the Leopold-Wolman relationship reflects the difference between gravel- and sand-bed rivers more than the difference between meandering and braided channel patterns. The channel width-bankfull discharge relationship, which was suggested by Xu (1996) for discrimination of channel patterns of sand-bed rivers in China, is also tested in this study by the same database. The result shows that the channel width-discharge relationship discriminates channel of patterns better than the slope-discharge relationship. To improve the Leopold-Wolman relationship, a diagram based on the channel slope-bankfull width relationship is proposed. This diagram shows that the slope-width plane is divided by two straightlines into 4 areas, with each type of river located in each area. Hence, the two straight lines {{can be regarded as}} the thresholds between the 4 types of rivers: the gravel-bed meandering pattern, the gravel-bed braided pattern, the sand-bed meandering pattern and the sand-bed braided pattern. The slope-width relationship connects together the two major factors responsible for the formation of channel patterns, i. e., sediment transport along the long profile and <b>bank</b> <b>mobility</b> at the cross section, and thus a better discrimination of channel-patterns is achieved...|$|R
40|$|Many economists {{argue that}} the growth of {{international}} capital mobility has made the maintenance of pegged exchange rates more costly, forcing developing states to choose alternative arrangements. But some states do not simply abandon pegged exchange rates as their exposure to capital mobility rises. Some states abandon pegs long before a crisis can erupt, while others maintain pegs until the speculative pressures became unbearable. Why, {{in an environment of}} growing capital mobility, do some states maintain pegs longer than others do? One reason is that the more that bank lending dominates investment in a country, the more likely that state is to hold on to a pegged exchange rate. When banks have accumulated significant amounts of foreign debt they lobby for exchange rate stability. In a bank‐dominated financial system, a concentrated banking sector can organize easily and use its crucial role in the economy to exert influence over economic policy. This article presents new evidence from statistical tests on 61 developing countries that confirm that states with deeper banking systems are more likely to peg their exchange rates, in spite of growing capital <b>mobility.</b> <b>banking,</b> capital <b>mobility,</b> exchange rate crises, exchange rate regime, financial system, interest groups, E 44, F 31, F 32, F 44, G 21,...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe Durance River is a gravel-bed river deeply {{impacted}} in its downstream part by gravel {{mining and}} flow diversion. The {{modification of the}} flow regime and the gravel extractions {{have led to a}} significant reduction of the bankfull channel width (from 50 to 80 % for the 1960 - 2000 period), a river bed degradation and, above all, a vegetation encroachment associated to an important overbank sedimentation. These changes result in a modification of flowing conditions during floods and an increase in flood risk because the lateral mobility is not high enough to rework regularly the vegetated landforms. Therefore lateral mobility processes and rate have to be better understood and quantified. We work on three different spatial scales (bar, bend and reach scales) in order to characterize and quantify the lateral mobility. First of all, at fine scale, we use PIT Tags and an event topographic survey to study the entrainment threshold variability of the particles of the bar and the bank toe. Then the link between discharge, lateral <b>bank</b> <b>mobility</b> and vertical channel mobility is investigated at bend scale thanks to event topographic survey and physical characterization of the bed material (size and shape). Finally, the lateral mobility quantification at reach scale requires both a diachronic study on orthophoto and an in situ topographic survey. The first results highlight not only a coupled <b>mobility</b> between <b>bank</b> and channel but also a high spatial variability of lateral mobility linked to both local hydrodynamic conditions and geographical position of sediment sources...|$|R

40|$|The {{relationship}} between the observance of financial system standards and financial stability is complex owing to the multitude of macroeconomic and structural factors affecting stability. Therefore, assessments of standards in terms of technical criteria for compliance needs to be reinforced with additional information on other factors affecting risks {{in order to assess}} financial stability. Preliminary evidence from country data on observance of Basel Core Principles (BCPs) suggests that indicators of credit risk and bank soundness are primarily influenced by macroeconomic and macroprudential factors and that the direct influence of compliance with Basel Core Principles on credit risk and soundness is insignificant.

40|$|Following {{a period}} of {{privatization}} and restructuring, commercial banks in Central and Eastern Europe and, more recently, in the Balkans have rapidly expanded their lending {{to the private sector}}. This paper describes the causes of this expansion, assesses future trends, and evaluates its policy implications. It concludes that bank credit to the private sector is likely to continue rising faster than GDP {{in the next few years}} throughout the region, picking up also in countries where so far it has been stalled. Although this growth should be regarded as a structural and positive development, policymakers will have to evaluate carefully its implications for macroeconomic developments and financial stability.

40|$|There is a {{widespread}} view that bank capital requirements should be loosened during recessions and tightened during expansions to avoid excessive credit and output swings. This view {{is based on a}} partial analysis that ignores the effects of capital requirement policies on the saving decisions of households, and, through this channel, on bank loans and output. We present an intertemporal general equilibrium framework that accounts for such effects and evaluate the optimal responses to loan supply and productivity (loan demand) shocks. In contrast to the standard view, we show that, when loan supply is reduced, increasing the capital requirement allows a faster recovery of households'' savings, loans, and output than a flat capital requirement policy. When productivity (loan demand) is reduced, lowering the capital requirement facilitates households'' dissaving and amplifies the output decline, but enhances welfare. Finally, we show that if productivity reductions are anticipated-rather than unanticipated-by regulators, lowering the capital requirement preemptively enhances welfare through greater intertemporal smoothing of households'' consumption and deposit holdings.

With key parameters of the model estimated using data from an inflation targeting economy, namely Canada, we particularly focus on (i) the role of sector-specific real rigidities, specially in the form of factor mobility costs, and (ii) welfare implications of targeting alternative price indices. Our estimations reveal considerable heterogeneity across sectors, and in several dimensions. Moreover, in contrast to existing studies, our welfare analysis comparing simple optimized policy rules based on alternative sectoral inflation rates provides support for CPI-based targeting policies by central <b>banks.</b> Capital <b>mobility</b> costs matter importantly in this regard.

The {{purpose of this paper is}} to gain an understanding of the factors that affect customer loyalty to the <b>bank.</b> Consumer <b>mobility</b> will probably increase as a result of political changes and pressures on the private banking market to become more competitive. This study was carried out using semi-structured interviews and were transcribed and analyzed with the help of models and theories centered on relationship marketing. The theories describe loyalty, the customer lifecycle and relationships between customers and organizations. The collected data comes from a representative at Nordea, one of Sweden’s biggest banks, and interviews with four customers of different Swedish banks about their views on their relationship with their own banks. The results show that customers are not engaging with the marketing activities of their respective banks and have little knowledge about their services and the banking sector as a whole. The customers stay with their current banks because they find it tedious to make a switch when there is little to no gain for doing so. Customers use online banking for most of their day to day banking errands but they feel that the physical locations are important for their sense of security and confidence in the bank. ...|$|R

Using data from the IMF and Freedom House, we test the effectiveness of political freedoms, in particular of civil liberties and political rights, in reducing the chance of banking and currency crises.

40|$|In the study, the {{relevance}} of several optimum-currency-area (OCA) criteria is formally worked out in a welfare approach. The optimum monetary-policy rules of the supranational central bank are derived within the Barro-Gordon framework, and consideration is given to how {{the welfare of the}} member countries of a currency union is affected by symmetric and asymmetric national output shocks. The welfare implications are deduced both analytically and with the use of simulations. In a twocountry framework, the countries are allowed to differ in size, and different degrees of labour mobility are addressed. Also the issue of output persistence is taken up. The central-bank council may consist of a central-bank board and of a group of national central-bank presidents, where the national presidents are assumed to focus on their home economies. It is shown that relatively small member countries favour a situation where the group of national central bank presidents is in a strong position while large countries prefer decisions to be taken by the central-bank board. The preferences are the less strong the higher the degree of labour mobility. With output persistence, labour migration also moderates the disadvantages of the decisions taken by a central-bank board for a relatively small country. Furthermore, for output persistence in conjuncture with labour migration, monetary policy by a small country within the group of national presidents may negatively affect its future welfare. Besides, differences in the national monetary transmission processes as well as divergent national inflation and output preferences affect welfare.

40|$|This paper studies {{a policy}} {{often used to}} defend a {{currency}} peg: raising short-term interest rates. The rationale for this policy is to stem demand for foreign reserves. Yet, this mechanism is absent from most monetary models. This paper develops a general equilibrium model with asset market frictions where this policy can be effective. The friction I emphasize {{is the same as}} in Lucas (1990) : money is required for asset transactions. When the government raises domestic interest rates, agents want to increase their holdings of domestic currency in order to acquire more domestic-currency-denominated assets. Thus, agents do not run on the reserves of the central bank, and the peg survives. A key implication of the model is that an interest rate defense can always be successful, but at great costs for domestic agents. Hence the reluctance of governments to sustain this policy for long periods of time.

40|$|This paper reviews {{monetary}} transmission {{mechanisms in}} low-income countries (LICs) to identify {{aspects of the}} channels that may operate differently in LICs relative to advanced and emerging economies. Given the weak institutional frameworks, reduced role of securities markets, imperfect competition in the banking sector and the resulting high cost of bank lending to private firms, the traditional channels (interest rate, bank lending, and asset price) are impaired in LICs.
