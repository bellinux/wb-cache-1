5|$|The <b>Bourne</b> Identity is a 2002 action spy thriller film {{based on}} Robert Ludlum's {{novel of the}} same name. It stars Matt Damon as Jason <b>Bourne,</b> a man {{suffering}} from extreme memory loss and attempting to discover his true identity amidst a clandestine conspiracy within the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). The film also features Franka Potente, Chris Cooper, Clive Owen, Julia Stiles, Brian Cox and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje. The first in the Jason <b>Bourne</b> film series, {{it was followed by}} The <b>Bourne</b> Supremacy (2004), The <b>Bourne</b> Ultimatum (2007), The <b>Bourne</b> Legacy (2012) and Jason <b>Bourne</b> (2016).|$|E
5|$|The fourth {{film of the}} <b>Bourne</b> franchise, The <b>Bourne</b> Legacy was {{released}} in 2012. Neither Damon nor Greengrass was involved. Both returned for the fifth film in the franchise, eponymously titled Jason <b>Bourne.</b>|$|E
5|$|Four villages or hamlets {{occupied}} {{the site of}} the modern town: <b>Bourne</b> (or, to distinguish it from others of the same name, East <b>Bourne),</b> is now known as Old Town, and this surrounded the <b>bourne</b> (stream) which rises in the present Motcombe Park; Meads, where the Downs meet the coast; South <b>Bourne</b> (near the town hall); and the fishing settlement known simply as Sea Houses, which was situated to the east of the present pier.|$|E

50|$|Mrs. <b>Bournes</b> {{distributed}} clothing {{among the}} poor which she received from the Ladies Irish Clothing Society. The <b>Bournes</b> distributed porridge and soup from their dwelling on a daily basis. A large bell was rung when the food was ready for distribution. The <b>Bournes</b> also set up a school, which like all schools was used for proselytising but unlike most, the teacher taught in the Irish language, the main role being to educate rather than to turn people into Protestants.|$|R
50|$|There {{was a huge}} {{population}} of landless people who were close to destitution who were not <b>Bournes</b> tenants and the <b>Bournes</b> felt threatened 'For although the people are now perfectly quiet still, their destitution may force them to destroy the lives and properties of others (from Outrage papers 1846). Samuel <b>Bournes</b> requested that there be police brought to Rossport to quell any trouble. By 1866 there was a police barracks based in a small thatched cottage in the village.|$|R
5|$|The <b>Bourne</b> Identity was {{followed}} by a 2004 sequel, The <b>Bourne</b> Supremacy, which received a similar positive critical and public reception, but received some criticism for its hand-held camerawork, which observers argued made action sequences difficult to see. The <b>Bourne</b> Supremacy was directed by Paul Greengrass with Matt Damon reprising his role as Jason <b>Bourne.</b> A third film, The <b>Bourne</b> Ultimatum, was released in 2007 and again was directed by Paul Greengrass and starred Matt Damon. Like Supremacy, Ultimatum received generally positive critical and public reception, but also received similar criticism for the camera-work. Liman remained as executive producer for both films {{as well as for the}} fifth film Jason <b>Bourne,</b> once again directed by Greengrass and released in 2016.|$|E
5|$|Beginning on May 23, Swagger feuded with Evan <b>Bourne,</b> {{with both}} men trading {{victories}} on several episodes of Raw. At Capitol Punishment, <b>Bourne</b> defeated Swagger {{to end the}} feud. Swagger competed in his second Money in the Bank ladder match at the Money in the Bank pay-per-view, however he was unsuccessful as the match was won by Alberto Del Rio.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Wombosi {{continues}} to obsess over the attempt on his life. Conklin, having anticipated this, planted {{a body in}} the Paris morgue to appear as the assailant, but Wombosi is not fooled and threatens to report this and other CIA secrets to the media. The Professor assassinates Wombosi on Conklin's orders. <b>Bourne,</b> posing as Kane, learns about Wombosi's yacht, and that the assailant had been shot twice in the back during the escape; he realizes {{that he was the}} assailant. He and Marie take refuge at the French countryside home of her old friend Eamon (Tim Dutton) and his children. Under pressure from Abbott to tie off the Wombosi matter entirely, Conklin tracks Bourne's location and sends the Professor there, but <b>Bourne</b> shoots him twice with Eamon's shotgun, mortally wounding him. The Professor reveals their shared connection to Treadstone before dying. <b>Bourne</b> sends Marie, Eamon, and Eamon's children away for their protection, and then contacts Conklin via the Professor's phone to arrange a meeting. From a rooftop near the arranged location in Paris, <b>Bourne</b> sees Conklin has brought backup, so he abandons the meeting, but uses the opportunity to place a tracking device on Conklin's car, leading <b>Bourne</b> to Treadstone's safe house.|$|E
50|$|About {{the year}} 1707, Thomas <b>Bournes,</b> a Cromwellian from Co. Sligo was granted Rossport and {{neighbouring}} Muingnabo from Arthur Shaen. In 1727 he transferred {{his interest in}} Rossport to his brother George, who settled in the townland in 1756. Two other branches of the <b>Bournes</b> family had settled in Stonefield and Portacloy, two townlands on the Dún Chaocháin peninsula. The old Protestant graveyard well-hidden on the hillside above the village bears testament to the Protestant past of the townland. Like other landlords, the <b>Bournes</b> had tenants. While some landlords treated their tenants despicably, it would appear from reports that the <b>Bournes</b> treated their tenants with some compassion. Another George <b>Bournes,</b> probably a great grandson of the original man referred to previously, {{is reported to have}} written to the Protestant Bishop of Killala requesting relief for the starving tenants. The bishop got several tons of meal and potatoes and George received some of it for his tenants.|$|R

5|$|On January 21, 2003, Universal Pictures {{released}} The <b>Bourne</b> Identity in the U.S. on VHS {{as well as}} on DVD in two formats: a single-disc widescreen collector's edition and a single-disc {{full screen}} collector's edition. Both contain supplemental materials including a making-of documentary, a commentary from director Doug Liman and deleted scenes. On July 13, 2004, Universal released a new DVD of the film in the U.S. in preparation for the sequel's cinema debut. This DVD came in the same two formats: a single-disc widescreen (Extended edition) and a single-disc full screen (Extended edition). Both contain supplemental materials including interviews with Matt Damon, deleted scenes, alternative opening and ending, a documentary on the consulate fight and information features on the CIA and amnesia. The alternate ending on the DVD has <b>Bourne</b> collapsing during the search for Marie, waking up with Abbott standing over him, and getting an offer to return to the CIA. Neither contain the commentary or DTS tracks present in the collector's edition. The film was also released on UMD for Sony's PlayStation Portable on August 30, 2005 and on HD DVD on July 24, 2007. With the release of The <b>Bourne</b> Ultimatum on DVD, a new DVD of The <b>Bourne</b> Identity was included in a boxed set with The <b>Bourne</b> Supremacy and The <b>Bourne</b> Ultimatum. The boxed set is entitled The Jason <b>Bourne</b> Collection. A trilogy set was released on Blu-ray in January 2009.|$|E
5|$|The main {{job of the}} Drain is {{to gather}} the waters pumped from the Kesteven Fens, the Holland Fens and the Weir Dyke, a soak dike in <b>Bourne</b> North Fen, {{alongside}} the <b>Bourne</b> Eau and River Glen, northwards and eastwards to the Black Sluice at Boston, where they are discharged to the tidal waters of The Haven. The Weir Dyke {{takes its name from}} a weir in the bank of the <b>Bourne</b> Eau at Tongue End, which was constructed by the Black Sluice Commissioners, to allow water from the <b>Bourne</b> Eau to overflow the bank when excess water could not flow into the River Glen in times of flood. The overfall weir became redundant when the Tongue End pumping station was constructed in 1966.|$|E

5|$|After Exit 2, Route 25 {{bends to}} the northeast, {{bypassing}} Buttermilk Bay and the densely populated village of Buzzards Bay {{to the south}}. The route passes Union Pond and Dicks Pond {{to the south and}} Spectacle Pond and Sandy Pond to the north before entering the town of Plymouth. In Plymouth, Route 25 passes to the north of several cranberry bogs and small ponds. While the freeway has no interchanges in Plymouth, a rest area is located off eastbound Route 25 in the town; the area is inaccessible from westbound Route 25. Due to state funding cutbacks, services at the rest area are limited to summer weekends (Friday to Sunday) as of 2010. After the rest area, Route 25 passes over <b>Bourne</b> Road and turns sharply to head in a southwestern direction. The route passes under Bournedale Road after entering the town of <b>Bourne.</b> In <b>Bourne,</b> Route 25 has its final interchange; Exit 3 (formerly Exit 2) serves the villages of Buzzards Bay and Sagamore, connecting to US 6 (Scenic Highway) and Route 28 north. From Exit 3, US 6 is used to access the Sagamore Bridge in northern <b>Bourne</b> and the towns of Hyannis and Provincetown on Cape Cod.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the event}} aired live on pay-per-view, a dark match was {{featured}} in which Evan <b>Bourne</b> defeated John Morrison with a shooting star press.|$|E
5|$|From 1969 until 1987, {{the eastern}} {{terminus}} of Route 25 {{was at a}} junction with Maple Springs Road, US 6 and Route 28 in Wareham near the modern location of Exit 2. The MassDPW and the Massachusetts Highway Department (MassHighway) had plans to extend the freeway eastward to Cape Cod as early as 1953, when the route {{was included in the}} proposed Cape Cod Expressway that would connect New York City with Cape Cod. Route 25 was originally planned to connect to the Sagamore Bridge, which carried US 6 over the Cape Cod Canal and was used to access the towns of Hyannis and Provincetown. In 1962, however, the MassDPW conducted traffic studies on the two bridges crossing the canal and found that the Sagamore Bridge was above vehicular capacity, whereas the more southern <b>Bourne</b> Bridge had excess capacity. The Route 25 freeway was then redesigned to cross over the <b>Bourne</b> Bridge and connect with the Mid-Cape Highway (US 6) on the southern side of the canal via the proposed Southside Connector. The connector would have been constructed through the Massachusetts Military Reservation in <b>Bourne,</b> but was canceled by the MassDPW and MassHighway in 1977 when environmental tests indicated the freeway would disturb underground aquifers serving as water sources for the region. MassDPW instead changed the proposed eastern terminus of the Route 25 expressway to the approach ramps of the <b>Bourne</b> Bridge.|$|E

5|$|Starbreeze then {{partnered with}} Electronic Arts for two {{different}} games, one {{was known as}} Project Redlime, while the other was an action-adventure video game set within the <b>Bourne</b> universe. The <b>Bourne</b> game was cancelled {{as a direct result}} of Matt Damon and director Paul Greengrass not participating in the fourth <b>Bourne</b> film. Project Redlime had a larger scale than the <b>Bourne</b> game. It was said to be a reinvention of one of Electronic Arts' franchises. The company shifted from a technology-orientated company to focus more on the core gameplay mechanics of their new project. Syndicate was announced in September 2011. The game suffered from a troubled development, with Starbreeze completely reworking the game one year after its initial development. There were also many creative differences between the developer and the publisher, and the two companies suffered from an inharmonious relationship. During the game's development, seven senior members of the company, including Högdahl, left to form their own smaller studio. Some of them formed MachineGames to work on their own original games. With a budget that was less than other typical AAA video games, Syndicate received average reviews and was a commercial failure. Grefberg left the company after the game's completion, and 25 employees were laid off.|$|E
