5|$|A {{commonly}} cited quote <b>by</b> <b>Ralph</b> Nader {{states that}} {{a pound of}} plutonium dust spread into the atmosphere {{would be enough to}} kill 8 billion people. However, calculations show that one pound of plutonium could kill no more than 2 million people by inhalation. This makes the toxicity of plutonium roughly equivalent with that of nerve gas. Nader's views were challenged in 1976 by Bernard Cohen, as described in the book Nuclear Power, Both Sides: The Best Arguments for and Against the Most Controversial Technology. Cohen's own estimate is that a dose of 200micrograms would likely be necessary to cause cancer.|$|E

5|$|Heavy Traffic is a 1973 American adult {{animated}} comedy-drama film {{written and}} directed <b>by</b> <b>Ralph</b> Bakshi. The film, which begins, ends, and occasionally combines with live-action, explores the often surreal fantasies of a young New York cartoonist named Michael Corleone, using pinball imagery {{as a metaphor for}} inner-city life. Heavy Traffic was Bakshi and producer Steve Krantz's follow-up to the film Fritz the Cat. Though producer Krantz made varied attempts to produce an R-rated film, Heavy Traffic was given an X rating by the MPAA. The film received positive reviews and is widely considered to be Bakshi's biggest critical success.|$|E
