For example, a library makes a contract with a certain publisher or vendor and will purchase everything that this publisher or vendor has available in regards to a topic. A benefit to this style of ordering is an automatic acquisition of materials for a particular field, which can be especially beneficial to specialized or academic libraries.|$|R

Therefore, the fact that the contents of one publication were unobjectionable did not, by itself, make the ban unreasonable.

He accepted the Minister's view that the Jehovah's Witnesses' refusal to perform national service was prejudicial to national security. The activities of the Jehovah's Witnesses had been properly restricted on the basis that they were against [...] "public order", and the prohibition on their publications was a natural consequence in view of the [...] "public interest". Citing Chng Suan Tze v.
