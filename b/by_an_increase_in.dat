5|$|Mephedrone {{is often}} {{consumed}} with alcohol. A study in mice investigated the interrelation {{between these two}} substances, focusing on the psychostimulant and rewarding properties of mephedrone.

The increase in the commercial capacity of track and field was also met with developments in the application of sports science, and there were many changes to coaching methods, athlete's diet regimes, training facilities and sports equipment.

5|$|An earlier {{administrative}} and political {{function of the}} area was {{to serve as a}} core area for one of the three provincial things that together elected the king of Denmark. The first Danish administrative sub-divisioning occurred as part of the centralization process, when the area became divided into administrative units called hundreds (herreder in Danish). The hundreds were possibly based on older, already existing units, but the establishment of the new form of hundreds was prompted <b>by</b> <b>an</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> royal power during the High Middle Ages. These differed from the provincial thing areas in that they were not local communities joined under a governing assembly but top-down regional divisions established to ensure royal authority. These medieval Danish hundreds were used to implement military obligations and to expedite the collection of renders due to the king in the provinces. They were first established in Jutland, where they replaced previous administrative units called syssel. According to some scholars, they were introduced in Skåneland possibly as early as the 11th century.|$|E

5|$|In response, on 29 March, the British Secretary of State for War Leslie Hore-Belisha {{announced}} plans to increase the Territorial Army (TA) from 130,000 men to 340,000 {{and in so doing}} double the number of territorial divisions. The intended plan of action was for the existing units to recruit over their allowed establishments (aided <b>by</b> <b>an</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> pay for territorials, the removal of restrictions on promotion that had been a major hindrance to recruiting during the preceding years, the construction of better quality barracks, and an increase in supper-time rations) and then form 'second-line' divisions from small cadres that could be built upon. As a result, the 61st Infantry Division was to be created as a second-line unit, a duplicate of the first-line 48th (South Midland) Infantry Division. In April, limited conscription was introduced. At that time 34,500 'Militiamen', all of the age of 20, were conscripted into the regular army with the intent of being trained for six months before being deployed to the forming second line units. However, despite the intention for the army to grow in size, the programme was complicated by a lack of central guidance on the expansion and duplication process, and issues regarding the lack of facilities, equipment, and instructors.|$|E
