500|$|The PV {{industry}} {{is beginning to}} adopt levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) as the unit of cost. The electrical energy generated is sold in units of kilowatt-hours (kWh). As a rule of thumb, and depending on the local insolation, 1 watt-peak of installed solar PV capacity generates about 1 to 2kWh of electricity per year. This corresponds to a capacity factor of around 10–20%. The product of the local cost of electricity and the insolation determines the <b>break</b> <b>even</b> <b>point</b> for solar power.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to determine whether}} farming premium wine grapes can generate profit on a 10 acre site in Napa County, and if farming wine grapes can be a profitable long term investment. The report utilizes two techniques for analysis of the data. The break-even analysis {{will be used to}} determine whether the operation is potentially profitable. Vineyard establishment costs were outlined in and production costs (from year 3 forward) defined. Production costs and grape revenues are weighed to determine net revenues above total costs. Monthly per acre break down of costs demonstrates how vineyard production costs fluctuate during dormancy, the growing season and harvest in the fall. A ranging analysis of grape revenue weighted against costs at varying prices and yields provides possible levels of profitability. Depreciation for all equipment purchased for the operation is used to calculate capital recovery. To determine the different levels of profitability of the operation based on various levels of yield and price, marginal cost and marginal revenue criterion was used to find various <b>break</b> <b>even</b> <b>points</b> and to observe points where revenue exceeds cost.

The topic {{of this study}} is important to every manufacturing company. The general theoretical basis subsequently tend to concrete problem-solving, including calculations, graphic representations and verbal explanations. The theoretical part of this work presents potential approaches to the description of basic economic values and examines correlations of these values. Problems described in theoretical part are applicated on a project currently executed by public limited company Metrostav, it is a tunnel construction known as,,Construction 0079 Špejchar [...] Pelc [...] Tyrolka [...] bored tunnels". There have to be made some important decisions about the basic time, technological and other variables before calculations.

40|$|Farmers in {{the villages}} always face the same {{problem of how to}} reduce the {{moisture}} content of paddy harvest during harvest and postharvest time, especially in wet season. At the farm level, the grain quality is poor and alternative drying using kerosene fuel is very costly. The objective of this research was to design and evaluate the technical and economical performance of drying paddy using an equipment known as "ABC" dryer. The dryer uses paddy husk as fuel. The research was conducted at Research Institute for Rice over three years (1993 / 94 - 1995 / 96). The result showed that the "ABC" type dryer could reduce the moisture content of 5 tons wet paddy from 22. 25 % to 15. 03 % in 9 hours or an average drying rate of 1. 05 % moisture content per hour, with drying cost of Rp 18 kg- 1. Reducing the moisture content further to 11. 83 % needed 16 hours or average drying rate 0. 82 % hour- 1, with drying cost almost doubled (Rp 32 kg- 1). These costs are far below that of kerosene drying, i. e., Rp 30 kg- 1 and Rp 60 kg- 1 to reach moisture content of 15. 03 % and 11. 83 %, respectively. Budget analysis showed that the B/C ratio were 1. 57 and 1. 84 and the IRR are above 41. 26 % and 47. 42 % to reach moisture contentsof 15. 03 % and 11. 83 %, respectively. The <b>break</b> <b>even</b> <b>points</b> of "ABC" dryer were 130 and 60 tons, respectively.

40|$|This {{special issue}} is {{centered}} on case studies of six pub-lic health business plans, and the term “public health business plan ” appears throughout the issue. But what is a public health business plan? And why might you want one? First, let us discuss why business planning makes sense to today’s public health managers. When public health managers conceive of their work as business planning, they begin to graft a business-oriented model of analysis and operation onto the culture of nonprofit and governmental public health. The goal becomes customer service, 1 and the task becomes creating value. It means finding new, different sources of support for programs, diversifying partners, generating revenue, analyzing efficiency, determining cost per unit of service, calculating <b>break</b> <b>even</b> <b>points.</b> If public health were a baseball game, creating a successful business plan would be like hitting a grand slam to bring home the resources necessary to improve health in your community. The shift toward a more entrepreneurial approach to planning social interventions comes {{in the context of}} economic uncertainty, rising expectations, and on-going and emerging health threats. It has roots in the “reinventing government ” movement 2 and the concur-rent movement in the nonprofit sector toward social entrepreneurialism. 3 – 6 Four needs are driving public health ventures in this direction: the needs for sustain-able financing, proven results, improved efficiency, and effective multisectoral partnerships. Federal and state resources are becoming scarcer and more restrictive; public officials increasingly want demonstrable results for those public funds; grants increasingly require hard outcomes and sustainability plans; and grant funds continue to run in unpredictable cycles, though they are very predictably run out. “Doing more with less” may seem oxymoronic, but the environment requires it...|$|R

The first fourth aspect was analyzed by descriptive analyses and financial aspects were analyzed by Net Present Value (NPV), Internal Rate of Return (IRR), <b>Break</b> <b>Even</b> <b>Points</b> (BEP) and Benefit Cost Ratio (BC ratio).
