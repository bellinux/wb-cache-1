5|$|The {{flag was}} {{proposed}} by Nehru at the Constituent Assembly on 22 July 1947 as a horizontal tricolour of deep saffron, white and dark green in equal proportions, with the Ashoka wheel in <b>blue</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{centre of the}} white band. Nehru also presented two flags, one in Khadi-silk {{and the other in}} Khadi-cotton, to the assembly. The resolution was approved unanimously. It served as the national flag of the Dominion of India between 15 August 1947 and 26 January 1950, and has served as the flag of the Republic of India since then.|$|E
5|$|The {{video was}} {{directed}} by British directing duo James Frost & Alex of The Artists Company. It was shot at 50 frames per second, twice the regular speed. At the shoot, Chris Martin had to sing the song at double speed so that the audio and visual content would be in sync, a common yet difficult practice of music videos. The final product is slowed to 25 frames per second, giving the slow motion effect of the video. The transition of the video from night to day was achieved during the telecine process. During the transfer from film to videotape, an operator manually adjusted the amount of lighting for <b>blue</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> beginning, red in the middle, and yellow {{at the end of}} the video.|$|E

5|$|Although Watts's {{work was}} seen as {{outdated}} and sentimental by the English Modernist movement, his experimentation with Symbolism and Expressionism drew respect from the European Modernists, notably the young Pablo Picasso, who echoed Hope's intentionally distorted features and broad sweeps of <b>blue</b> <b>in</b> <b>The</b> Old Guitarist (1903–1904). Despite Watts's fading reputation at home, {{by the time of}} his death in 1904 Hope had become a globally recognised image. Reproductions circulated in cultures as diverse as Japan, Australia and Poland, and Theodore Roosevelt, President of the United States, displayed a reproduction in his Summer White House at Sagamore Hill. By 1916, Hope was well-known enough in the United States that the stage directions for Angelina Weld Grimké's Rachel explicitly use the addition of a copy of Hope to the set to suggest improvements to the home over the passage of time.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, Madonna starred as Breathless Mahoney in Dick Tracy, {{directed}} by Warren Beatty {{and based on}} Chester Gould's comic strip. She received a Saturn Award nomination for Best Actress. Beatty later appeared in her 1991 documentary, , which showed {{behind the scenes of}} her 1990 Blond Ambition World Tour. It was the highest-grossing documentary of all time at that point. She also received positive reviews for her role in A League of Their Own (1992), which was centered on a women's baseball team during World War II. In 1993, Madonna starred in the erotic thriller Body of Evidence, which performed poorly at the box office. Her subsequent films saw Madonna take on smaller roles, including a singing telegram girl in <b>Blue</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Face (1995), a witch in Four Rooms (1995), and a phone sex company owner in Spike Lee's Girl 6 (1996). Madonna starred as Eva Perón in the 1996 film adaptation of the Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical Evita. Her performance was acclaimed by critics and won her a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in Motion Picture Musical or Comedy.|$|E
5|$|In {{his first}} season at Oxford, Tarr played for the 'A' team, which also {{included}} another future England player Anthony Henniker-Gotley. He was later selected for the senior team and gained three Blues from 1907 to 1909. He won his first <b>Blue</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1907 Varsity Match on 10 December, alongside Henry Vassall. Cambridge, with some notable international players on the team, were the clear favourites on the day. After they won the toss and elected to kick off with the wind behind them, {{the majority of the}} first 40 minutes was played in Oxford's half, much of it in their 25. Yet Cambridge failed to break through Oxford's defence, chiefly that of the centres Vassall and Tarr. Just before half time, with a scrum deep in Oxford's half, Rupert Williamson fed George Cunningham. The ball came to Tarr, who drew his opposite man, K. G. Macleod, and timed his pass to Vassall so that he, in turn, drew the Cambridge left wing near the half-way line and put H. Martin to run in a try from there. Oxford went on to win 16–0.|$|E

5|$|The Storm {{was always}} going to go with the colours of their state, Victoria (Navy blue with a white 'V'), but club {{consultant}} at the time, Peter McWhirter of the JAG fashion house, suggested that they should also have purple and gold to make their merchandise more attractive. These colours appear in the logo, however, on the home jersey they have varied. Between 1998 and 2004 these four colours also appeared but between 2005 and 2009, gold was completely removed and silver introduced. Between 2010–2012, gold returned and silver was omitted, purple also became the dominant colour in the jersey. For 2013 a new design was announced featuring a deeper V, with more navy <b>blue</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> jersey, gold disappeared along with most of the white, the lightning bolts were also changed to purple. During 2015 the jersey changed again for the first time not featuring a V at all, but the V returned somewhat along with the lightning bolts in 2016 with a manufacturer change. Over the years and in all variations of the Jersey, Navy Blue and Purple always remain the main colours.|$|E

25|$|Another {{important}} factor in the increased prestige of the colour <b>blue</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 12th century was the veneration of the Virgin Mary, and a change in the colours used to depict her clothing. In earlier centuries her robes had usually been painted in sombre black, grey, violet, dark green or dark <b>blue.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> 12th century the Roma Catholic Church dictated that painters in Italy (and the rest of Europe consequently) to paint the Virgin Mary with the new most expensive pigment imported from Asia; ultramarine. Blue became associated with holiness, humility and virtue.|$|E
