40|$|Abstract — In future hybrid {{automotive}} applications {{there will}} be multiple voltage systems in a single vehicle. It is desirable to have bi-directional, isolated power flow between these different voltage levels. The three-port power converter is able to achieve full bi-directional power flow by using a high-frequency transformer, with three windings, connected to a full-bridge converter on each winding or port. The normal control of the power flow between the ports is via phase-shift control of the individual full-bridge converters. However in the automotive application, there may be only a single power source for the initial powering up {{of the system and}} in this case, phase-shift control {{can not be used to}} start-up the converter system. This paper presents a start-up method for the three-port converter in which the converter is first operated in a buck-mode, followed by an output voltage <b>boosting</b> <b>mode,</b> and is able to finally operate with normal phase-shift control. Detailed analysis of the buck and boost mode during start-up is presented and verified by simulation. I...|$|E

The infrastructure equipment is configured to receive an indication that data is to be transmitted {{to one of the}} communications devices. In response the infrastructure equipment is configured to transmit a first paging message to the communications device to indicate that the communications device is to receive the data via the wireless access interface. If a response to the transmitted first paging message is not received within a predetermined time, then if the infrastructure is able to use a power <b>boosting</b> <b>mode,</b> to transmit the first paging message with a boosted power, or if the infrastructure equipment is not able to use a power boosted mode for transmitting, to transmit a second paging message to one or more communications apparatus which can operate as a relay node for the communications device.

40|$|We {{construct}} a framework which allows an algorithm {{to turn the}} distributions produced by some boosting algorithms into polynomially smooth distributions (w. r. t. the PAC oracle’s distribution), with minimal performance loss. Further, we explore the case of Freund and Schapire’s AdaBoost algorithm, bounding its distributions to polynomially smooth. The main advantage of AdaBoost over other boosting techniques {{is that it is}} adaptive, i. e., it is {{able to take advantage of}} weak hypotheses that are more accurate than it was assumed a priori. We show that the feature of adaptiveness is preserved and improved by our technique. Our scheme allows the execution of AdaBoost in the on-line <b>boosting</b> <b>mode</b> (i. e., to perform boosting “by filtering”). Executed this way (and possessing the quality of smoothness), now AdaBoost may be efficiently applied to a wider range of learning problems than before. In particular, we demonstrate AdaBoost’s application to the task of DNF learning using membership queries. This application results in an algorithm that chooses the number of boosting iterations adaptively, and, consequently, adaptively chooses the size of the produced final hypothesis. This answers affirmatively a question posed by Jackson. 1...|$|E

40|$|With the {{increase}} in demand for energy {{and the need for}} environmental protection, geothermal energy, as a renewable resource, is receiving growing attention. Stand alone geothermal power stations have been established all over the world. However these systems predominantly harvest volcanic resources, which have limited availability, while the more widespread deep resources are still expensive to access. Integrating the geothermal resources into a conventional fuel fired Rankine cycle power plant, through the so called “geothermal aided power generation” (GAPG) concept. In so called GAPG technology, geothermal fluid is used to replace parts of extraction steam in regenerative Rankine cycle power plant to preheat feedwater of power plant. The GAPG technology can significantly increase the efficiencies and reduce the costs of geothermal energy for power generation purposes. The general aim of this research is to comprehensively study {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} geothermal aided power generation by developing and validating a simulation model that can be used as a tool for the technical and economic analysis of a GAPG system. The developed modelling simulates the steam Rankine power plant so as to assess the technology and to provide an economic analysis of GAPG technology for a variety of structural types of power plant. Two case studies are carried out with modelling. A 500 MW subcritical power plant is used as case study to study the technical performance of GAPG technology for both power <b>boosting</b> <b>mode</b> and fuel saving mode. Two coal fired power plants, a 580 MW subcritical coal fired power plant and a 580 MW supercritical coal fired power plant, are selected as study cases to demonstrate the economic advantages of the GAPG technology with medium to low temperature geothermal resources. Cost of electricity (COE) of GAPG technology in two cases is used to compare with that in a flash cycle geothermal power plant and a binary cycle geothermal power plant. The results indicate that the GAPG technology has higher thermodynamic first law efficiency than the geothermal alone power plant and the efficiency of the GAPG technology is no longer limited by the temperature of geothermal fluid, but rather by the maximum temperature of the Rankine cycle power plant. It is also found that utilization of the existing infrastructure of conventional fossil fired power plants can demonstrate the economic advantages of the GAPG technology as the lower COE than the geothermal alone power plant. Chapter one of this thesis defines the concept, aims and scope of this study. Chapter two details the previous research in the field of this study. The functions and structure of modelling for GAPG technology are described in chapter three. Chapter four presents the operational method and the modelling validation. Two case studies are carried out by modelling, with the technical and economic performance of GAPG technology presented in chapters five and six. Thesis (M. Eng. Sc.)

40|$|A {{bidirectional}} converter (BDC) {{is essential}} in applications where energy storage devices are involved. Such applications include transportation, battery less un-interruptible power system, flywheel energy storage systems, etc. Bidirectional power flow through buck and <b>boost</b> <b>modes</b> of operation along with high power density and efficiency is important requirement of such systems. This paper presents a new BDC topology {{using a combination of}} fast turn-off SCR and insulated-gate bipolar transistor with a novel control logic implementation to achieve zero switching losses through zero voltage transition and zero current transition techniques.

This matrix converter {{is based on the}} indirect matrix converter operating in the reverse <b>boost</b> <b>mode.</b> The reverse <b>boost</b> <b>mode</b> is preferred over the forward buck mode, since most of the energy resources have voltages lower than the grid voltage.

The proposed control technique can regulate the output voltage for variable input voltage (higher, lower, or equal to the output voltage). There are several existing solutions to these problems, and selecting the best approach involves a tradeoff among cost, efficiency, and output noise or ripple.

40|$|Many {{portable}} power applications {{require a}} power source that has buck–boost capability with low output ripple. For this application, the REG 710 {{is a prime}} choice; however understanding the affects of the pump and output capacitors allows designers {{to take full advantage}} of the REG 710 ’s capabilities in order to minimize output voltage ripple. A fundamental step in minimizing output ripple is to optimize the PCB layout. A poor layout adversely affects device operation, resulting in increased output ripple, EMI, and poor regulation. To minimize these effects, the pump capacitor, output capacitor, and input capacitor should be placed as close as possible to the REG 710 with the load connected directly across the output capacitor. For best performance, surface-mount ceramic capacitors should be used. For a recommended layout pattern, refer to the REG 710 data sheet. The REG 710 family of products, except for the REG 710 – 5, operates in both the buck and <b>boost</b> <b>modes.</b> Since the modes of operation are different, different techniques can be used to minimize the output ripple.
