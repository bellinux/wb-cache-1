5|$|Murray cod {{continue}} a pattern present in Murray-Darling native fish genera of speciation into lowland and specialist upland species: Murray cod are the primarily lowland species and the endangered trout cod are the specialist upland species. The pattern is slightly blurred in the cod species because, being adaptable and successful fish, Murray cod push significant distances into upland habitats, while the now endangered trout cod stray (or did stray, before their decline) well down the upland/lowland transition zone, {{which can be}} extensive in Murray-Darling Rivers. Nevertheless, the <b>basic</b> <b>pattern</b> of speciation into a primarily lowland species and a specialist upland species is present.|$|E
5|$|The Catholic Church, whose {{traditional}} membership {{was most}} affected by the changes in housing, {{was the first to}} react to this situation, creating 76 new parishes between 1845 and 1960 in the west of the country alone. The Baptist and Episcopalian churches followed close behind, particularly in the new towns. Within the Church of Scotland, the closeness of congregation and clergy was expressed in the domestic plainness of 1950s dual-use hall churches, as at Reiach's Kildrum Parish Church, Cumbernauld (completed 1962), a steel framed building, clad in timber and brick with a flat roof. Of 129 buildings erected by the Church of Scotland between 1948 and 1959, 108 were on this <b>basic</b> <b>pattern.</b>|$|E
5|$|To {{function}} in gas exchange, lungs required a blood supply. In cartilaginous fishes and teleosts, the heart lies {{low in the}} body and pumps blood forward through the ventral aorta, which splits up in a series of paired aortic arches, each corresponding to a gill arch. The aortic arches then merge above the gills to form a dorsal aorta supplying the body with oxygenated blood. In lungfishes, bowfin and bichirs, the swim bladder is supplied with blood by paired pulmonary arteries branching off from the hindmost (6th) aortic arch. The same <b>basic</b> <b>pattern</b> is found in the lungfish Protopterus and in terrestrial salamanders, and was probably the pattern found in the tetrapods' immediate ancestors as well as the first tetrapods. In most other bony fishes the swim bladder is supplied with blood by the dorsal aorta.|$|E

5|$|A small {{fraction}} of the genes in an organism's genome control the organism's development. These genes are called the developmental-genetic toolkit. They are highly conserved among phyla, meaning that they are ancient and very similar in widely separated groups of animals. Differences in deployment of toolkit genes affect the body plan and the number, identity, and pattern of body parts. Most toolkit genes are parts of signalling pathways: they encode transcription factors, cell adhesion proteins, cell surface receptor proteins and signalling ligands that bind to them, and secreted morphogens that diffuse through the embryo. All of these help to define the fate of undifferentiated cells in the embryo. Together, they generate the patterns in time and space which shape the embryo, and ultimately form the body plan of the organism. Among the most important toolkit genes are the Hox genes. These transcription factors contain the homeobox protein-binding DNA motif, also found in other toolkit genes, and create the <b>basic</b> <b>pattern</b> of the body along its front-to-back axis.|$|E

40|$|A {{recurrent}} {{neural network}} (RNN), {{in which each}} unit has serial delay elements, is proposed for memorizing limit cycles (LCs). This network is called DRNN in this paper. An LC consists of several <b>basic</b> <b>patterns.</b> The hysteresis information of LCs, realized on the connections from the delay elements to the units, is very efficient in the following reasons. First, the same <b>basic</b> <b>patterns</b> can be shared by different LCs. This {{make it possible to}} drastically increase the number of LCs, even though using a small number of the <b>basic</b> <b>patterns.</b> Second, noise performance, that is, probability of recalling the exact LC starting from the noisy LC, can be improved. The hysteresis information consists of two components, the order of the <b>basic</b> <b>patterns</b> included in an LC, and the cross-correlation among all the <b>basic</b> <b>patterns.</b> The former is highly dependent on the number of LCs, and the latter the number of all the <b>basic</b> <b>patterns.</b> In order to achieve good noise performance, a small number of the <b>basic</b> <b>patterns</b> is preferred. These properties of the DRNN are theoretically analyzed and confirmed through computer simulations. It is also confirmed that the DRNN is superior to the RNN without delay elements for memorizing LCs...|$|R

40|$|AbstractHumans {{and animals}} walk adaptively in diverse {{situations}} by skillfully manipulating their complicated and redundant musculoskeletal systems. From {{an analysis of}} measured electromyographic (EMG) data, it appears that despite complicated spatiotemporal properties, muscle activation patterns {{can be explained by}} a low dimensional spatiotemporal structure. More specifically, they can be accounted for by the combination of a small number of <b>basic</b> activation <b>patterns.</b> The <b>basic</b> <b>patterns</b> and distribution weights indicate temporal and spatial structures, respectively, and the weights show the muscle sets that are activated synchronously. In addition, various locomotor behaviors have similar low dimensional structures and major differences appear in the <b>basic</b> <b>patterns.</b> These analysis results suggest that neural systems use muscle group combinations to solve motor control redundancy problems (muscle synergy hypothesis) and manipulate those <b>basic</b> <b>patterns</b> to create various locomotor functions. However, it remains unclear how the neural system controls such muscle groups and <b>basic</b> <b>patterns</b> through neuromechanical interactions in order to achieve adaptive locomotor behavior. This paper reviews simulation studies that explored adaptive motor control in locomotion via sensory-motor coordination using neuromusculoskeletal models based on the muscle synergy hypothesis. Herein, the neural mechanism in motor control related to the muscle synergy for adaptive locomotion and a potential muscle synergy analysis method including neuromusculoskeletal modeling for motor impairments and rehabilitation are discussed...|$|R

25|$|The reggae organ-shuffle {{is unique}} to reggae. In the {{original}} version of reggae, the drummer played a reggae groove {{that was used in}} the four bar introduction, allowing the piano to serve as a percussion instrument. Typically, a Hammond organ-style sound is used to play chords with a choppy feel. This is known as the bubble. This may be the most difficult reggae keyboard rhythm. The organ bubble can be broken down into 2 basic patterns. In the first, the 8th beats are played with a space-left-right-left-space-left-right-left pattern, where the spaces represent downbeats not played—that and the left-right-left falls on the ee-and-a, or and-2-and if counted at double time. In the second <b>basic</b> <b>pattern,</b> the left hand plays a double chop as described in the guitar section while the right hand plays longer notes on beat 2 (or beat 3 if counted at double time) or a syncopated pattern between the double chops. Both these patterns can be expanded on and improvised embellishments are sometimes used.|$|E

25|$|In 1894, a Land Commission was {{appointed}} {{to deal with the}} settlement of Africans on the land. The Commission recommended that two large territories be set aside for native occupation, the Shangani and Gwaai Reserves in Matabeleland, of about 2,486,000 acres. Before the arrival of the Europeans, Africans had held nearly 100,000,000 acres in what became Southern Rhodesia. The Land Commission's plan showed such poor judgment, and the bases of allocation were so ill-considered, that the attempt to confine the native population within these two areas was never really practicable. Failure to make suitable provision for African lands may {{have been one of the}} prime causes of the Matabele and Mashona rebellions of 1896. Following these rebellions, BSAC was required to assign sufficient land to Southern Rhodesian Africans for their agricultural and pastoral requirements, including access to sufficient water. Native Reserves were set up under this directive, which by 1902 had an estimated indigenous population of 530,000. Although later modifications were made, the <b>basic</b> <b>pattern</b> of land allocation persisted until independence. The European district officers who responsible for defining the reserves were advised to allow between 9 and 15 acres of arable land for each family, and adequate pasture, but they had little geographic knowledge of the country and no maps. In 1910, a Native Affairs Committee of Enquiry was set up, which made very few changes. The Committee's land apportionment was 19 million acres for Europeans and 21.4 million acres for Native Reserves with an African population of about 700,000. A further 51.6 million acres was unassigned, but available for future alienation to Europeans.|$|E
