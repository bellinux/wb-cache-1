Burney concluded that while the villagers had possibly encountered a Malagasy hippopotamus, it was also possible that the stories were inaccuratea combination of misidentified animals, old folk traditions, and information the villagers had gathered from modern paleontology.|$|E
5|$|However, {{even among}} Senate Republicans, there were {{conflicting}} views. Senators Arlen Specter and Lindsey Graham (the latter a former military prosecutor) indicated Congress would work quickly to authorize tribunals, while influential Senator John Warner suggested a cautious and deliberative response. The potential for Congressional action also provided an avenue for politicking, as Republicans threatened Democratic members of Congress with <b>being</b> <b>labeled</b> weak on terrorism {{if they did}} not authorize tribunals.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} centuries, Zoroastrians faced much religious discrimination and persecution, harassments, {{as well as}} being identified as najis (polluted) and impure to Muslims, making them unfit to live alongside Muslims, and therefore forcing them to evacuate from cities and face major sanctions in all spheres of life. Zoroastrians have been subject to public humiliation through dress regulations, to <b>being</b> <b>labeled</b> as najis and to exclusion in the fields of society, education and work.|$|E

5|$|Relations {{were further}} damaged by a schism between the Catholic West and Orthodox East {{that led to}} the Byzantine Greeks <b>being</b> <b>labeled</b> as heretics in the West. Throughout the later centuries of the Byzantine Empire and {{particularly}} following the coronation of Charlemagne (reigned as king of the Franks 768–814) in Rome in 800, the Byzantines were not considered by Western Europeans as heirs of the Roman Empire, but rather as part of an Eastern kingdom made up of Greek peoples.|$|E
5|$|Three court {{appointed}} psychiatrists found Kemper to {{be legally}} sane. One of the psychiatrists, Dr. Joel Fort, investigated his juvenile records and the diagnosis {{that he was}} once psychotic. He also interviewed Kemper, including under truth serum, and relayed to the court that Kemper had engaged in cannibalism, alleging that Kemper sliced flesh from the legs of his victims, then cooked and consumed these strips of flesh in a casserole. Nevertheless, Fort determined that Kemper was fully cognizant in each case, and stated that Kemper enjoyed {{the prospect of the}} infamy associated with <b>being</b> <b>labeled</b> a serial killer.|$|E

5|$|Animation enthusiasts {{have noticed}} {{similarities}} between Aladdin and Richard Williams' unfinished film The Thief and the Cobbler (also known as Arabian Knight under Miramax Films and The Princess and the Cobbler under Majestic Films International). These similarities include a similar plot, similar characters, scenes and background designs, and the antagonist Zig-Zag's resemblance in character design and mannerisms to Genie and Jafar. Though Aladdin was released prior to The Thief and the Cobbler, The Thief and the Cobbler initially began production much {{earlier in the}} 1960s, and was mired in difficulties including financial problems, copyright issues, story revisions and late production times caused by separate studios trying to finish the film after Richard Williams was fired from the project for lack of finished work. The late release, coupled with Miramax purchasing and re-editing the film, has sometimes resulted in The Thief and the Cobbler <b>being</b> <b>labeled</b> a rip-off of Aladdin.|$|E
5|$|By 1388, {{the devastation}} of Dalmatia by the Bosnian army had become so severe that the {{authorities}} of the cities pleaded with Sigismund to either help them or {{to allow them to}} save themselves by submitting without <b>being</b> <b>labeled</b> as traitors. Neither Sigismund's army nor an alliance of Dalmatian cities and noblemen were able to counter Tvrtko's advances. Split, Zadar, and Šibenik having lost all hope, Tvrtko called upon them to negotiate their surrender in March 1389. Each of the cities asked to be the last one to submit and even to be allowed to request Sigismund's assistance once more. Tvrtko granted their wish and decided that Split should be the last to submit, by 15 June 1389.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of the Chinese Farm {{took place}} during October 15 to October 17, 1973 between the Egyptian Army and the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), {{as part of the}} Yom Kippur War. It was fought in the Sinai Peninsula, north of the Great Bitter Lake and just east of the Suez Canal, near an Egyptian {{agricultural}} research station. The farm featured specialized Japanese-made machinery; Israeli soldiers mistook Japanese characters on this equipment for Chinese, leading to the area <b>being</b> <b>labeled</b> 'Chinese Farm' on Israeli military maps. The battle began when the IDF launched Operation Abiray-Lev ("Stouthearted Men"), attempting to establish a corridor to the canal and allow bridges to be laid for a crossing. Accordingly, the Israelis attacked Egyptian forces in and around the Chinese Farm.|$|E

5|$|The Sounds {{compiled}} a 68–76record, 20games out of first-place, in 1995. Originally, Michael Jordan, {{who played with}} the White Sox's Double-A Birmingham Barons in 1994, was signed to play the 1995 season as a non-drafted free agent for the Sounds. However, with the ongoing MLB strike, Jordan decided to quit the sport rather than becoming a replacement player and <b>being</b> <b>labeled</b> a strikebreaker. The team improved their record in 1996, ending up with 77wins and 67losses. Despite a decent winning percentage, Nashville failed to secure {{a spot in the}} playoffs. Outfielder Jeff Abbott won the Rookie of the Year Award, and Rick Renick earned his second Manager of the Year Award. Joey Vierra pitched in a career franchise-record 238games from 1990 to 1992 and 1994 to 1995.|$|E
5|$|Just {{north of}} the Lexicon-Tirtur {{junction}} was the village of al-Galaa. Prior to the 1967 Six Day War, the village had been {{the site of an}} agricultural project. This agricultural station incorporated several irrigation ditches and specialized Japanese-made machinery. When the Sinai came under Israeli occupation, Israeli soldiers unwittingly mistook the Japanese characters for Chinese ones, leading to the location <b>being</b> <b>labeled</b> 'Chinese Farm' on military maps. Just north and north-west of Chinese Farm was a hill mass known by its Israeli codename 'Missouri'. During Operation Badr, al-Galaa and the Chinese Farm fell within the designated bridgehead of the 16th Infantry Division. Abd el-Hamid's 16th Infantry Brigade occupied and defended these locations. After partaking in the initial canal-crossing, the brigade, {{along with the rest of}} the division, faced an attack by Raviv's brigade on October 9. The Israelis achieved some initial gains, but were repelled by the end of the day. Also located within 16th Division's bridgehead, as of October 13, was the 21st Armored Division. Its units were positioned in the center and the {{north of the}} bridgehead. The 14th Brigade had been involved in the crossing and, along with the 1st Brigade, participated in the Egyptian offensive on October 14; as a result, it had lost half of its operational tank strength. In the aftermath, Oraby's efforts to reorganize and replace armored losses were hampered by frequent artillery barrages and air strikes. On October 15, there were 136 tanks in the Egyptian bridgehead, unevenly split among Oraby's brigades: 66 with the 1st Armored Brigade, 39 with the 14th Armored Brigade, and 31 in the 18th Mechanized Brigade. Despite their heavy losses, the Egyptian forces in the bridgehead outnumbered Reshef's force.|$|E
5|$|Workers {{distributed}} about 4,100tons of {{food and}} 200,000litres of milk to the affected victims, by both land and air. In Veracruz, only 9helicopters were utilized to distribute food and water to isolated areas. About 948tons of medicine was also distributed. Helicopters assisted in transporting people to shelters. In Veracruz alone, 34people were rescued by boat and 1,131 by aircraft. In Puebla and Veracruz, 9,551troops were stationed to assist in relief work, utilizing 48helicopters, 4Hercules planes, and 10boats. Between Veracruz and Hidalgo, the Department of Social Development distributed about 18,500mattresses and other relief items. Workers quickly made repairs to highways, and by October19, all of the 28damaged federal highways were provisionally reopened; some of the reopened highways had to undergo additional construction work. The military worked to reopen other roads. In Veracruz, the Director of the Federal Electricity Commission noted that repairs to electrical systems were difficult {{in the immediate aftermath}} of the floods. Planes flew generators into Gutiérrez Zamora, Veracruz, mainly for hospitals, and by October20, 90% of the affected areas had their power restored. President Zedillo announced on October11 that the government would begin building new houses, part of the Emergency Housing Program initiative. In Puebla, the initial stages of the program would involve rebuilding 1,200houses and moving 500houses to safer lands. The Mexican government estimated that the housing program would help 37,000families. Mexico's agricultural ministry provided assistance for farmers to replant lost crops. Through the Temporary Employment Program, the federal government temporarily hired about 1million people who lost their homes or farms. Students gradually returned to school after repairs were made, and by October28, over 800,000students who were affected were able to return to school, including all of Oaxaca and Hidalgo. The area in Teziutlán, Puebla affected by the mudslide was never rebuilt, due to <b>being</b> <b>labeled</b> a high-risk area.|$|E
