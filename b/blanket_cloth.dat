40|$|Abstract Background The {{onset of}} {{menstruation}} is a landmark {{event in the}} life of a young woman. Yet the complications and challenges that can accompany such an event have been understudied, specifically in resource-poor settings. As interventions aim to improve female attendance in schools, it is important to explore how menstruation is perceived and navigated by girls in the school setting. This research conveys rural Kenyan schoolgirls' perceptions and practices related to menstruation Methods Data were collected at six rural schools in the Nyanza Province of Western Kenya. Using focus group discussions, in-depth interviews, and field notes from observations, researchers collected information from 48 primary schoolgirls and nine teachers. Systematic analysis began with a reading of transcripts and debriefing notes, followed by manual coding of the narratives. Results Focus group discussions became opportunities for girls to share thoughts on menstruation, instruct one another on management practices and advise one another on coping mechanisms. Girls expressed fear, shame, distraction and confusion as feelings associated with menstruation. These feelings are largely linked to a sense of embarrassment, concerns about being stigmatized by fellow students and, as teachers explained, a perception that the onset of menstruation signals the advent of a girl's sexual status. Among the many methods for managing their periods, girls most frequently said they folded, bunched up or sewed cloth, including cloth from shirts or dresses, scraps of old cloth, or strips of an old <b>blanket.</b> <b>Cloth</b> was reported to frequently leak and cause chafing, which made school attendance difficult particularly as the day progressed. Attitudes and practices of girls toward menstruation have been arranged into personal, environmental and behavioural factors. Conclusion Further research on menstrual management options that are practical, sustainable and culturally acceptable must be conducted to inform future programs and policies that aim to empower young girls as they transition into womanhood. Stakeholders working within this and similar contexts must consider systematic mechanisms to explain to young girls what menstruation is and how to manage it. Providing sanitary supplies or guiding girls on how to create supplies serve as critical components for future interventions. </p...|$|E

50|$|Stiff rawhide was {{fashioned}} into saddles, stirrups and cinches, knife cases, buckets, and moccasin soles. Rawhide {{was also}} made into rattles and drums. Strips of rawhide were twisted into sturdy ropes. Scraped to resemble white parchment, rawhide skins were folded to make parfleches in which food, clothing, {{and other personal}} belongings were kept. Women also tanned hides to make soft and supple buckskin, which was used for tipi covers, warm robes, <b>blankets,</b> <b>cloths,</b> and moccasins. They also relied upon buckskin for bedding, cradles, dolls, bags, pouches, quivers, and gun cases.|$|R

60|$|Of course twelve oxen {{were not}} enough to draw two wagons, or even one. Therefore, hearing that there were natives on the {{mainland}} who possessed plenty of cattle, I at once gave out that I was ready to buy, and pay well in <b>blankets,</b> <b>cloth,</b> beads and so forth. The result was that within two days I had forty or fifty to choose from, small animals of the Zulu character and, I should add, unbroken. Still they were sturdy and used to that veld and its diseases. Here it was that my twelve trained beasts came in. By putting six of them to each wagon, two as fore- and two as after-oxen, and two in the middle, Hans and I {{were able to get}} the other ten necessary to make up a team of sixteen under some sort of control.|$|R

50|$|The Queensland Woollen Manufacturing Company {{played an}} {{important}} role in the war effort during the First World War. Many of the industries in Ipswich suffered during the war due to reduced numbers of employees and minimised profits, but the Queensland Woollen Manufacturing Company was an exception; the high number of female employees ensured minimal staff reductions caused by the war. The factory was extremely busy throughout the war making army <b>blankets</b> and <b>cloth</b> for military uniforms.|$|R
60|$|In the morning, before Mr. M'Kay had {{returned}} to the ship, great numbers of the natives came off in their canoes to trade, headed by two sons of Wicananish. As they brought abundance of sea-otter skins, and there was every appearance of a brisk trade, Captain Thorn did not wait for the return of Mr. M'Kay, but spread his wares upon the deck, making a tempting display of <b>blankets,</b> <b>cloths,</b> knives, beads, and fish-hooks, expecting a prompt and profitable sale. The Indians, however, were not so eager and simple as he had supposed, having learned the art of bargaining and the value of merchandise from the casual traders along the coast. They were guided, too, by a shrewd old chief named Nookamis, who had grown gray in traffic with New England skippers, and prided himself upon his acuteness. His opinion seemed to regulate the market. When Captain Thorn made what he considered a liberal offer for an otter-skin, the wily old Indian treated it with scorn, and asked more than double. His comrades all took their cue from him, and not an otter-skin was to be had at a reasonable rate.|$|R
5000|$|The Second World War saw the woollen mill {{playing a}} similar role {{to that of}} the First, making <b>blankets</b> and <b>cloth</b> for the armed services. During the war years the Federal Government {{declared}} dismissals forbidden from vital or [...] "protected industries" [...] such as the cloth manufacturing industry; prices and wages were pegged. For the workers this was a favourable climate to demand improvements. A larger number of females were employed in the mill during the war due to decreased male employment.|$|R

5000|$|Waltzing Matilda : {{from the}} above terms, [...] "to waltz Matilda" [...] is to travel with a swag, that is, with all one's {{belongings}} on one's back wrapped in a <b>blanket</b> or <b>cloth.</b> The exact origins of the term [...] "Matilda" [...] are disputed; one fanciful derivation states that when swagmen met each other at their gatherings, there were rarely women to dance with. Nonetheless, they enjoyed a dance and so danced with their swags, which was given a woman's name. However, {{this appears to be}} influenced by the word [...] "waltz", hence the introduction of dancing. It seems more likely that, as a swagman's only companion, the swag came to be personified as a woman.|$|R
5000|$|A blanket or pad used under {{a saddle}} when a horse is being ridden is called by many names, {{including}} a saddle <b>blanket,</b> saddle <b>cloth,</b> numnah, and saddle pad. They {{usually do not}} cover the horse's entire body, though a hybrid design that is {{a cross between a}} saddle blanket and a horse blanket, called a quarter sheet, is a blanket placed under the saddle but which covers the horse from shoulder to hip while riding. Quarter sheets are sometimes used in cold weather to keep a horse's muscles loosened up when warming up for competition, or on horses that may have to stand around when under saddle and run the risk of stiffening up if their muscles get chilled.|$|R
5000|$|After {{a stormy}} voyage, Agamemnon and Cassandra either landed in Argolis, or were blown off course {{and landed in}} Aegisthus' country. Clytemnestra, Agamemnon's wife, had taken Aegisthus, son of Thyestes, as a lover. When Agamemnon came home he was slain by either Aegisthus (in the oldest {{versions}} of the story) or Clytemnestra. According to the accounts given by Pindar and the tragedians, Agamemnon was slain in a bath by his wife alone, a <b>blanket</b> of <b>cloth</b> or a net having first been thrown over him to prevent resistance. Clytemnestra also killed Cassandra. Her jealousy of Cassandra, and her wrath at the sacrifice of Iphigenia and at Agamemnon's having gone to war over Helen of Troy, {{are said to have}} been the motives for her crime.|$|R

In {{the course of the}} day they discovered a solitary horseman hovering at a distance before them on the plain. They spurred on to overtake him; but he was better mounted on a fresher steed, and kept at a wary distance, reconnoitring them with evident distrust; for the wild dress of the free trappers, their leggings, <b>blankets,</b> and <b>cloth</b> caps garnished with fur and topped off with feathers, even their very elf-locks and weather-bronzed complexions, gave them the look of Indians rather than white men, and made him mistake them for a war party of some hostile tribe.|$|R

30|$|In this study, 1402 {{children}} reported recurrent activity affected head pain lasting 5 to 45 {{minutes with}} one of the associated diagnostic migraine features of nausea / vomiting[*]/ phonophobia / and or photophobia. It was difficult to get the symptoms of both phonophobia and photophobia from majority of these children at first consultation and interviewing both the parents, family members and class mates were necessary in eliciting both the symptoms. This is usually not possible and practical in countries like India, where huge volumes of patients (up to 250 /day) have to be examined on a daily basis. The behaviour during head pain episodes like switching off TV and radio, closing the door and putting off lights, covering the heads with <b>blanket</b> or <b>cloth</b> when lying down with head pain, getting angry or shouting at family members or classmates when they try to talk etc. were indirect evidences suggestive of both.|$|R
