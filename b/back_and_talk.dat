500|$|In {{preparation}} for the race, NASCAR held several test sessions on January20–22,2011 for teams to test the newer pavement at Daytona. Also in the sessions, {{the opening of the}} restrictor plate was reduced from the 30/32inch plate used in tire testing to 29/32inch. NASCAR vice president for competition Robin Pemberton stated, [...] "We'll have to get <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> to the teams and look at the speeds from the last two days of testing. I think we have some high-water marks at 197-and-a-half [...] which, depending on where they pulled up in the draft, it may be a little quick, but it's hard to say." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1931, Douglas {{continued}} his studies in sociology at the University of Chicago. He never did complete his PhD thesis, but was deeply disturbed by his field work in the Depression-era [...] "jungles" [...] or hobo camps where about 75,000 transients sheltered in lean-tos venturing out by day to beg or to steal. Douglas interviewed men who once belonged to the American middle class—despondent bank clerks, lawyers and doctors. Douglas said later: [...] "There were little soup kitchens run by the Salvation Army and the churches... In the first half-hour they'd be cleaned out. After that there was nothing... It was impossible to describe the hopelessness." [...] Douglas was equally disturbed {{that members of the}} Socialist Party sat around quoting Marx and Lenin, waiting for a revolution while refusing to help the destitute. Douglas said: [...] "That experience soured me with absolutists... I've no patience with people who want to sit <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> about a blueprint for society and do nothing about it." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, in a January 28, 2009 {{interview}} with MTV News, Richard {{announced that the}} group had split up. Richard explained that Combs had invited all the women {{to come back to}} the 2009 season of Making the Band and that only two of them, Richard and Fimbres, showed up. [...] "It changes [...] completely," [...] she said. [...] "We have fans out there who love Danity Kane. We love Danity Kane. It's hard. We're sitting here trying to make sense of it now. It's hard. We're put in this position that we didn't ask to be in and we're being told to fix it." [...] On the series and in an earlier interview, Bex had explicitly stated her discontent about Danity Kane being divided. [...] "I don't know why ," [...] said Richard. [...] "I think she's just happy. I don't want to even try to answer it 'cause that's not fair to her. I haven't [...] but I heard she's doing well with her husband and she got a house. I love her, but I don't know." [...] Richard was surprised that only two members showed up for another season. [...] "The thing about it ... I thought we were all going to come <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk,</b> or maybe if [...] didn't come back, 'cause I don't know how [...] was feeling about that, if the four of us got together. I didn't know what to expect. I just know I got off the plane and found out I was the only one there and [...] came the next day." ...|$|E
60|$|The women {{fell back}} with {{suppressed}} screams, and readily made {{way for the}} men, but they shuffled, <b>backed,</b> <b>and</b> <b>talked</b> of pistols, <b>and</b> the butler suggested the policeman.|$|R
60|$|About two o'clock, {{after we}} had eaten and felt better, a white man appeared, {{carrying}} a white flag. Will Hamilton went out <b>and</b> <b>talked</b> to him, came <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>talked</b> with father <b>and</b> {{the rest of our}} men, and then went out to the stranger again. Farther back we could see a man standing and looking on, whom we recognized as Lee.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I think so," [...] {{said the}} young man. [...] "The young ladies walked {{me down to}} the rocks in the usual way after dinner, and then I came <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>talked</b> paint with Mr. Lapham till midnight. We didn't settle {{anything}} till this morning coming up on the boat." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No good stayin' here. I vote we go <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> it over. It's a crummy place. 'Must say I'm {{grateful}} to King for his water-works." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Let's go <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> to the girl," [...] {{suggested}} Patsy. [...] "Somehow, {{the poor}} thing seems lonely, and her smile was more pathetic than cheerful." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Whenever {{you feel}} {{that you would like to}} go down and have something, don't mind me, will you?" [...] she begged. [...] "You can come <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> to me at any time. I am not in the least hungry yet." ...|$|E
60|$|All {{the whole}} I must admit {{it was not}} a {{situation}} that lent itself to eloquence. I lay on my <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>talked</b> through bandages, <b>and</b> with some little difficulty, for my tongue and mouth had swollen. But I was feverish and in pain, and the emotional suspense I had been in so long with regard to her became now an unendurable impatience.|$|R
5000|$|The Bell That Never Rang was {{produced}} by Joan Wasser, noted for her musical career under the name Joan As Police Woman. After visiting Wasser in New York City, the band collectively decided {{to work with her}} on their next studio album. Aidan O'Rourke noted, [...] "It was when we got <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>talked</b> about the experiences and the excitement of the trip, we decided to invite Joan in to produce us".|$|R
60|$|The recruit was {{a likely}} young fellow enough, {{strongly}} built and well made, {{but by no}} means sober: indeed he had all the air {{of a man who had}} been more or less drunk for some days. He carried a small bundle over his shoulder, slung at the end of a walking- stick, and had a short pipe in his mouth. He was as dusty and dirty as recruits usually are, and his shoes betokened that he had travelled on foot some distance, but he was in a very jocose state, and shook hands with this soldier, and clapped that one on the <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> <b>talked</b> <b>and</b> laughed continually, like a roaring idle dog as he was.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{understand}} it all," [...] she said. [...] "It was a prank {{one would expect}} you to play. Though it's {{a very long time}} since I saw you, you haven't changed, Dick. Now take that ridiculous cloak off and come <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I had to, Jethro--couldn't help it. I {{tried to}} get Hallowell to wait till you come <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> it over friendly, but he wouldn't listen; said the road was dangerous, and that he'd spoken about it too often. He said he hadn't {{anything}} against you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now for it!" [...] said he, {{suddenly}} {{checking his}} horses, and springing {{from his seat}} to the ground. [...] "Out with you, in a twinkling, every one, and up into these rocks with me. Michael, thee tie thy horse to the wagon, and drive ahead to Amariah's and get him and his boys to come <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> to these fellows." ...|$|E
25|$|In the TV Show Vinyl, Richie Finestra (portrayed by Bobby Cannavale), {{president}} of record label American Century, meets Elvis Presley (portrayed by Shawn Wayne Klush) in 1973, in Las Vegas. Richie attempts to convince Elvis to stop singing in Las Vegas and instead focus on making new, creative music, {{acting like a}} true king. The Colonel (portrayed by Gene Jones) gets furious when he finds out Richie was going behind his <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>talking</b> about papers with Elvis and has Elvis point a gun at him.|$|R

6000|$|... "Well, Ken, we {{may as well}} sit <b>back</b> now <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> {{forestry}} till Buell skins all {{he wants}} of Penetier," [...] said Dick. [...] "It's really a fine camping-spot. Plenty of deer up here and bear, too." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Rayburn!" [...] he said, {{with such}} an awful effort at ease that I was impolite enough to laugh rudely in his face. [...] "Oh, Rayburn!" [...] said he, [...] "come, let's have done with this nonsense. Of course, I know it's the fever and you're not yourself; but collect yourself, man--give me that ridiculous weapon, now, and let's go <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> it over." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Is {{not your}} friend's {{business}} your own business? What does friendship mean {{if it is}} not so? And when I tell you that it is my business, mine of right, does that go for nothing with you? I thought I might depend upon you, Mr. Eames; I did indeed." [...] Then again she put her hand upon his arm, and as he looked into her eyes he began to think that after all she was good-looking in a certain way. At any rate she had fine eyes, and there was something picturesque about the entanglement of her hair. [...] "Think of it, and then come <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> to me again," [...] said Miss Demolines.|$|E
6000|$|... "That is so, my Lord Deleroy," [...] replied William, unmoved, [...] "for when I {{find a good}} song I like to sing it. Go now {{and look}} at those three men who lie yonder on the slope, and see whether the arrows in them bear my master's mark. Go also and look upon the Castle hill and find a knight with his head well-nigh hewn from his shoulders, and see whether yonder sword fits into the cut. Aye, and at others that I could tell you of, slain, every one of them, to save this fair lady. Aye, go you whose {{garments}} are so fine and unstained, and then come <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> of trumpeters." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{would you}} then be letting him come here as he likes, and {{settling}} nothing, and just maning {{to marry you}} or not, as he likes, and you <b>and</b> he <b>talked</b> of over the counthry these four months <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> he <b>talking</b> about you, jist as his misthress, through the counthry?" ...|$|R
60|$|Then {{he threw}} his head <b>back</b> <b>and</b> began to <b>talk</b> still more arrogantly and defiantly than he had done hitherto.|$|R
60|$|Mela came <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> the <b>talk</b> fell {{again to}} the former level; but Beaton had not said {{anything}} that really meant what she wished, and she saw {{that he intended to}} say nothing. Her heart began to burn like a fire in her breast.|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{where are}} they to go?" [...] said he, very gloomily. As to this Lucy was not as yet able to say anything. Indeed when she left Framley parsonage {{there had been no}} time for discussion. She would go <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> it all over with Fanny, and find out in what way the {{children}} might be best put out of danger. Why should they not all be harboured at the parsonage, as soon as assurance could be felt that they were not tainted with the poison of the fever? An English lady of the right sort will do all things but one for a sick neighbour; but for no neighbour will she wittingly admit contagious sickness within the precincts of her own nursery. Lucy unloaded her jellies and her febrifuges, Mr. Crawley frowning at her bitterly the while. It had come to this with him, that food had been brought into his house, as an act of charity, in his very presence, and in his heart of hearts he disliked Lucy Robarts in that she had brought it. He could not cause the jars and the pots to be replaced in the pony-carriage, as he would have done had the position of his wife been different. In her state it would have been barbarous to refuse them, and barbarous also to have created the fracas of a refusal; but each parcel that was introduced was an additional weight laid on the sore withers of his pride, till the total burden became almost intolerable. All this his wife saw and recognized even in her illness, and did make some slight ineffectual efforts to give him ease; but Lucy in her new power was ruthless, and the chicken to make the chicken-broth was taken out of the basket under his very nose. But Lucy did not remain long. She had made up her mind what it behoved her to do herself, and she was soon ready to return to Framley. [...] "I shall be back again, Mr. Crawley," [...] she said, [...] "probably this evening, and I shall stay with her till she is better." [...] "Nurses don't want rooms," [...] she went on to say, when Mr. Crawley muttered something as to there being no bed-chamber. [...] "I shall make up some sort of a litter near her; you'll see that I shall be very snug." [...] And then she got into the pony-chaise, and drove herself home.|$|E

5000|$|As {{his first}} solo effort, Coverdale later admitted: [...] "It's very {{difficult}} to think <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> sensible about the first album. White Snake had been a very inward looking, reflective and low-key affair in many ways, written and recorded {{as it was in}} the aftermath of the collapse of Deep Purple." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now we'll talk a moment," [...] Martin said. [...] "You can't get fresh with me. I {{want that}} laundry {{business}} finished first of all. Then {{you can come}} <b>back</b> <b>and</b> we'll <b>talk</b> for old sake's sake. I told you I was busy. Look at that." ...|$|R
50|$|The boy's name is Leo {{and he had}} an Omega {{that looked}} a lot like Zero. Its name is Mobius and Mobius could take away {{negative}} emotions and traumatizing memories. That went to his head though and this is what happened to his home. Mobius is now somewhere and Leo tries to find him. After shutting down all the volcanoes, Kai remembers the Mayor in the first area (Elebit Forest) saying something about a maiden that could connect to the hearts of Elebits, much like he could. He thought maybe she knows where Mobius is. After traveling <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>talking</b> to the Mayor, who does not give you much information, Kai remember Arpaka saying something along the lines.|$|R

"Our cat {{ran away}} once, {{and he brought}} her <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> we <b>talked</b> over the fence, and were getting on capitally, all about cricket, and so on, when he saw Meg coming, and walked off.

50|$|Parents Fest All the {{students}} in the school belong to a very humble background and majority of them are the first time learners, parents are not aware of the talent and the kind of learning happening in school.

5000|$|After {{the demise}} of Deep Purple, Coverdale {{embarked}} on a solo career. He released his first album in February 1977, titled White Snake. All songs were written by Coverdale and guitarist Micky Moody. As his first solo effort, Coverdale later admitted: [...] "It's very difficult to think <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> sensibly about the first album. White Snake had been a very inward looking, reflective and low-key affair in many ways, written and recorded {{as it was in}} the aftermath of the collapse of Deep Purple." [...] Even though the album was not successful, its title inspired the name of Coverdale's future band.|$|E
5000|$|For {{eight to}} ten months, I didn't write anything, I turned a blind eye. My first album was so {{personal}} that I didn't know how to bounce <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> about something else. The first album, I had written six years, while {{there were only two}} years that passed. And what had I lived apart from a tour, a controversy and having banged three groupies? I do caricature, but there was nothing to tell an interesting story. I wrote Le chant des sirènes by mixing reality and fiction, a little to rid myself of all that. In the end it helped me.

6000|$|Harking <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>talking</b> of pugilism, I recall an {{incident}} which gave me pleasure. A {{friend of mine}} read a pugilistic novel called [...] "Rodney Stone" [...] to a famous Australian prize-fighter, stretched upon a bed of mortal sickness. The dying gladiator listened with intent interest but keen, professional criticism to the combats of the novel. The reader had {{got to the point}} where the young amateur fights the brutal Berks. Berks is winded, but holds his adversary off with a stiff left arm. The amateur's second in the story, an old prize-fighter, shouts some advice to him as to how to deal with the situation. [...] "That's right. By --- he's got him!" [...] yelled the stricken man in the bed. Who cares for critics after that? ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'It {{was very}} easy to see, gentlemen, by this youngster's {{frowning}} and by the waiting-maid's tossing her head and turning up her nose, and by the young ladies turning their <b>backs</b> <b>and</b> <b>talking</b> together {{at the other end}} of the room, that nobody but the old gentleman took very kindly to the noble stranger. Indeed, Tom plainly heard the waiting-woman say of her master, that so far from being able to read the stars as he pretended, she didn't believe he knew his letters in 'em, or at best that he had got further than words in one syllable; but Tom, not minding this (for he was in spirits after the Madeira), looks with an agreeable air towards the young ladies, and, kissing his hand to both, says to the old gentleman, [...] "Which is which?" ...|$|R
