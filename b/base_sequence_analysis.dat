These antibodies produced immune complexes with an Mr 14000 (14 K) polypeptide in infected cells.

40|$|AbstractHost site {{selection}} for full-site integration by {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type- 1 (HIV- 1) integrase (IN) from nonionic detergent-lysed virions was investigated. Linear retrovirus-like DNA (469 bp) possessing 3 ′ OH recessed long terminal repeat termini was efficiently inserted by a bimolecular donor reaction into a supercoiled DNA target (2867 bp), producing the HIV- 1 5 -bp host site duplication. Sequence data were analyzed from 193 donor–target recombinants obtained from the linear 3. 8 -kb DNA product. The selection of host target sites appeared randomly distributed and was independent of lysis and assay conditions. The fidelity of the 5 -bp duplications in comparison to other size duplications was highest (94 %) with high-salt (300 mMNaCl) lysis of the virions and 60 mMNaCl for strand transfer using Mg 2 +as the divalent cation. <b>Base</b> <b>sequence</b> <b>analysis</b> demonstrated some biases in the 5 -bp duplications at the sites of strand transfer and at the immediate host sequences surrounding the duplications.

40|$|ABSTRACT: When rope {{is found}} at a crime scene, the type of fiber is {{currently}} identified through its microscopic characteristics. However, these characteristics may not always unambiguously distinguish some types of rope from others. If rope samples contain cells from the plants of ori-gin, then DNA analysis {{may prove to be}} a better way to identify the type of rope obtained from a crime scene. The objective of this project was to develop techniques of DNA analysis that can be used to differentiate between ropes made from Cannabis sativa L. (hemp), Agave sisalana Perrine (sisal), Musa textilis Ne (abaca, ‘‘Manila hemp’’), Linum usitatissimum L. (flax), and Corchorus olitorus L. (jute). The procedures included extracting the DNA from the rope, performing polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the extracted DNA as a template, and analyzing the DNA products. A primer pair for PCR, chosen from within a chloroplast gene for the large subunit of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase ⁄oxygenase, was designed to be specific for plant DNA and complementary to the genes from all five plants. The resulting PCR fragments were approximately 771 base pairs long. The PCR fragments, distinguished through <b>base</b> <b>sequence</b> <b>analysis</b> or restriction enzyme analysis, could be used to identify the five different rope types. The procedure provides a useful addition to visual methods of comparing rope samples...|$|E

40|$|Genetic and {{physical}} {{analyses of the}} ilvGEDA operon and the ilvB gene of Escherichia coli K- 12 were undertaken to study gene regulation. Transcription termination factor (rho) was shown not {{to be involved in}} the 2 ̆ 2 downstream amplification 2 ̆ 2 pattern of ilvGEDA expression. A cis-trans analysis of three ilvO mutations (ilvO mutations allow both ilvG expression and increased ilvEDA expression) demonstrated that the ilvO determinant functions in cis. A specialized transducing phage carrying a mutation that causes elevated ilva and ilvD expression under ilv-specific control was isolated to facilitate the physical analysis of this mutation. Restriction endonuclease and heteroduplex analysis of this phage, (lamda) h 80 dilv- 2130, revealed the deletion to be 1. 75 kb, from within the ilvE gene to within the ilvG gene, thus removing the ilvO determinant which is assumed to be a site of natural polarity within the ilvG gene, downstream of the ilvGEDA control region. ^ The ilvB gene was cloned from E. coli K- 12 to physically define the gene and to study its mechanisms of control. Analysis of the hybrid plasmid, pPU 38, and its derivatives showed that the ilvB gene is approximately 1600 bp and that the gene is transcribed in a clockwise direction, both on pPU 38 and on the E. coli K- 12 chromosome as the maps are usually represented. The cya or carbon source effect on ilvB expression appeared to be that of a slight increase. Construction of the ilvB::galK fusion confirmed the location of the ilvB promoter and showed that the leuS and valS gene products affect ilvB expression at the level of transcription initiation. The fusion demonstrated that ilvB transcription initiation was normal in cpxA, cpxB strains. Neither the E. coli ilvB gene nor the E. coli ilvB::galK gene was expressed as well in Salmonella typhimurium as in E. coli K- 12, indicating that some factor required for ilvB expression in E. coli k- 12 is lacking in S. typhimurium. ^ <b>Base</b> <b>sequence</b> <b>analysis</b> of the ilvB promoter yielded no evidence that ilvB is controlled by attenuation. ^ A model for the positive control of expression of the ilvB gene is discussed. ...|$|E

40|$|The protein ProQ has {{recently}} {{been identified as a}} global RNA chaperone in Salmonella, and a similar role is anticipated for its numerous homologues in divergent bacterial species. We report the solution structure of Escherichia coli ProQ, revealing an N-terminal FinO-like domain, a C-terminal domain that unexpectedly has a Tudor-domain fold commonly found in eukaryotes, and an elongated bridging intra-domain linker that is flexible but nonetheless incompressible. Structure <b>based</b> <b>sequence</b> <b>analysis</b> suggests that the Tudor domain was acquired through horizontal gene transfer and gene fusion to the ancestral FinO-like domain.
