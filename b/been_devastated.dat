A battle rages on Earth between human forces, the Covenant, and a Flood-infected army. Eventually, the Covenant is repulsed and flees through a slipspace portal, and the Flood is purged from Earth, though much of Africa has <b>been</b> <b>devastated</b> in the battle.|$|E
5|$|Patrick Linton Allen {{was born}} in Kingston, Jamaica, on 7 February 1951. He was the fourth of five {{children}} to Ferdinand Allen, a farmer, and Christiana Allen (née Grant), a housewife. His parents were subsistence farmers {{in a region that}} had <b>been</b> <b>devastated</b> by Hurricane Charlie around the time of his birth. Allen attended the Fruitful Vale All-Age School as a child. Beginning at grade one, Allen was a year ahead in school.|$|E
5|$|Fears grew {{about the}} threat of French raids across England from the 1380s onward. The {{citizens}} of Norwich were particularly concerned about the potential of a French raid on the city, drawing parallels between the position of Norwich {{and the experience of}} Southampton, another trading city that had <b>been</b> <b>devastated</b> by a French attack in 1338. This threat, combined with the recent events of the Peasant Revolt of 1381 when the rebels had looted the city, encouraged the local government to improve the city's defences.|$|E

5|$|On 25 November, the Chinese {{entered the}} war in defense of North Korea. The People's Liberation Army force, which totaled 260,000 troops, flooded into North Korea and caught the Eighth Army by surprise. Chinese forces crushed the UN and South Korean forces with {{overwhelming}} numbers, surrounding and destroying elements of the US 2nd Infantry Division, 7th Infantry Division, and South Korean forces. The 24th Infantry Division, {{on the west coast}} of the Korean peninsula, was hit by soldiers from the 50th and 66th Chinese field armies. Amid heavy casualties, the Eighth Army retreated to the Imjin River, south of the 38th parallel, having <b>been</b> <b>devastated</b> by the overwhelming Chinese force.|$|E
5|$|The June 2011 Christchurch {{earthquake}} was {{a shallow}} magnitude 6.3 ML earthquake that occurred on 13 June 2011 at 14:20 NZST (02:20 UTC). It was centred {{at a depth}} of 6km (3.8mi), about 10km (6mi) from Christchurch, which had previously <b>been</b> <b>devastated</b> by another magnitude 6.3 ML earthquake in February 2011. The June quake was preceded by a magnitude 5.9 ML tremor that struck the region at a slightly deeper 8.9km (5.5mi). The United States Geological Survey reported a magnitude of 6.0 Mw {{at a depth of}} about 9km (5.6mi).|$|E
5|$|Although for a {{few decades}} (since the times of the Silent Sejm) Russia had seen a weak Poland as its own protectorate, Poland had also <b>been</b> <b>devastated</b> by a civil war in which {{the forces of the}} Bar Confederation {{attempted}} to disrupt Russian control over Poland. The recent Koliyivschyna peasant and Cossack uprising in Ukraine also weakened Poland's position. Further, the Russian-supported Polish king, Stanisław August Poniatowski, was seen as both weak and too independent-minded; eventually the Russian court decided that the usefulness of Poland as a protectorate had diminished. The three powers officially justified their actions as a compensation for dealing with a troublesome neighbor and restoring order in Poland through military intervention (the Bar Confederation provided a convenient excuse); in fact all three were interested in territorial gains.|$|E

5|$|At 10:45, Lafontaine {{ordered a}} retreat and Guderian finally got heavy {{artillery}} from the Großdeutschland Infantry Regiment. The 88mm dual role artillery guns and the heavier Panzer III and IVs reached {{the area of}} the battle. By this time, the French 7th Tank Battalion had been wiped out and the 213th Infantry Regiment had <b>been</b> <b>devastated.</b> Only 10 French tanks, out of 40, remained. In the two pitched battles the 7th Tank Battalion fought that day they lost 10 from 13. Delays on the right flank meant the 205th Infantry Regiment and 4th Tank Battalion did not reach their starting line until 10:45, by which time the battle on the left wing had been lost and further attacks on the right would have made little sense. The 1st Panzer Division's victory parade was held in Chemery at 12:00, but it was cut short when the Luftwaffe bombed the square by mistake inflicting a few casualties.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the early}} 17th century, the western Petén had been heavily {{populated}} by Ch'ol and Ch'olti' Maya {{and was an}} important trade route for the Itza. By the mid-17th century, these populations had <b>been</b> <b>devastated</b> by war, disease and the enforced movement of the inhabitants into colonial settlements, negating the economic importance of the region for the Itza. At {{the same time the}} Kejache were becoming important intermediaries between the Itza and Yucatán. The Putun Acalan subgroup of the Kejache had previously traded directly with the Itza but had been relocated by the Spanish. The remaining Kejache, devastated by disease and subject to the intense attentions of Spanish missionaries, were no longer able to supply the Itza directly and became middlemen instead.|$|E
5|$|CARE International proposes several {{strategies}} that might reduce the destructive {{economic impact of}} HIV/AIDS on rural households. They recommend introducing new technologies that improve productivity to allow households affected by HIV/AIDS to continue supporting themselves through agriculture. Women in patrilineal/patrilocal villages are often unable to support {{themselves and their children}} when their husbands die of HIV/AIDS; therefore, helping women acquire traditionally masculine agricultural skills might decrease their vulnerability while improving agricultural productivity at the household and community levels. CARE International recommends increasing cooperation at the community level by establishing labor and food banks in areas that have <b>been</b> <b>devastated</b> by the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Finally, CARE International highlights the importance of increasing access to information about HIV/AIDS in Malawi to help families prepare for and cope with the economic burdens associated with the epidemic.|$|E

5|$|Except for nautiloids (represented by {{the modern}} order Nautilida) and coleoids (which had already diverged into modern octopodes, squids, and cuttlefish) all {{other species of}} the {{molluscan}} class Cephalopoda became extinct at the K–Pg boundary. These included the ecologically significant belemnoids, {{as well as the}} ammonoids, a group of highly diverse, numerous, and widely distributed shelled cephalopods. Researchers have pointed out that the reproductive strategy of the surviving nautiloids, which rely upon few and larger eggs, played a role in outsurviving their ammonoid counterparts through the extinction event. The ammonoids utilized a planktonic strategy of reproduction (numerous eggs and planktonic larvae), which would have <b>been</b> <b>devastated</b> by the K–Pg extinction event. Additional research has shown that subsequent to this elimination of ammonoids from the global biota, nautiloids began an evolutionary radiation into shell shapes and complexities theretofore known only from ammonoids.|$|E
5|$|On 27 November, China {{entered the}} war {{on the side of}} North Korea against the UN. Massed Chinese attacks were {{immediately}} launched against troops of the corps. The Eighth Army suffered heavy casualties, ordering a complete withdraw to the Imjin River, south of the 38th parallel, having <b>been</b> <b>devastated</b> by the overwhelming Chinese force. In the wake of the retreat, the disorganized Eighth Army regrouped and re-formed. I Corps relinquished command of the 1st Cavalry Division, the 24th Infantry Division, and the 27th British Brigade, taking command of the 3rd Infantry Division and the 25th Infantry Division in their place. On 1 January 1951, 500,000 Chinese troops attacked the Eighth Army's line at the Imjin River, forcing them back 50 miles and allowing the Chinese to capture Seoul. The Chinese eventually advanced too far for their supply lines to adequately support them, and their attack stalled. The Eighth Army, battered by the Chinese assault, began to prepare spring offensives to retake lost ground.|$|E
5|$|The {{inscription}} goes on {{to describe}} Cyrus returning to their original sanctuaries the statues of the gods that Nabonidus had brought to the city before the Persian invasion. This restored the normal cultic order {{to the satisfaction of}} the priesthood. It alludes to temples being restored and deported groups being returned to their homelands but does not imply an empire-wide programme of restoration. Instead, it refers to specific areas in the border region between Babylonia and Persia, including sites that had <b>been</b> <b>devastated</b> by earlier Babylonian military campaigns. The Cylinder indicates that Cyrus sought to acquire the loyalty of the ravaged regions by funding reconstruction, the return of temple properties and the repatriation of the displaced populations. However, it is unclear how much actually changed on the ground; there is no archaeological evidence for any rebuilding or repairing of Mesopotamian temples during Cyrus's reign.|$|E

5|$|On 27 November, China {{entered the}} war {{on the side of}} North Korea against the UN. Massed Chinese attacks were {{immediately}} launched against troops of the corps, with Chinese forces penetrating the corps' rear from its exposed east flank. The 2nd Infantry Division, at the front of IX Corp's advance in Kunuri, was overwhelmed from all sides by Chinese forces of the 40th CPV Army Corps, and elements from the 38th CPV Army Corps on 29 November in the Battle of Kunuri. By 1 December, the division was almost completely destroyed; it lost virtually all of its heavy equipment and vehicles, as well as suffering 4,940 men killed or missing. The 25th Infantry Division, on its western flank, was also hit by overwhelming Chinese forces of the 39th CPV Army Corps, facing strong attacks and suffering heavy casualties and losses in equipment in the Battle of Ch'ongch'on River. However, it was spared the same losses as the 2nd Infantry Division by escaping across the Ch'ongch'on River. The Eighth Army suffered heavy casualties, ordering a complete withdraw to the Imjin River, south of the 38th parallel, having <b>been</b> <b>devastated</b> by the overwhelming Chinese force. IX Corps retreated along the western coast to safety via Anju.|$|E
5|$|One year later, Celes awakens from a coma on {{a deserted}} island and learns {{that the world}} has <b>been</b> <b>devastated</b> by Kefka, who now dominates it as a god-like ruler. Much of the human {{population}} has died and plant and animal life are slowly being killed by sickness, punctuating humanity's despair. Celes sets out from the Solitary Island to try to reunite with as many of her friends as she can find. Celes is only required by the game's story to reunite with Edgar and Setzer, who leads them to the Falcon, an airship that belonged to a deceased friend; however, in a series of mostly optional side-quests, the player has the opportunity to gather the entire group, all still alive, as well as new allies Umaro and Gogo. Together, this quantity of Returners launch a new offensive against Kefka's Tower. Inside, the Returners battle their way through Kefka's defenses and destroy the three statues, the source of Kefka's newfound power. When destroying the statues, once the source of all magic, does not cause any noticeable reaction, the party realizes that Kefka has successfully drained the Warring Triad of power and has become the source of all magical power.|$|E
5|$|In 1932 Wilkinson {{was invited}} by the India League {{to join a}} small delegation, to report on {{conditions}} in India. During the three-month visit she met Gandhi, then in prison, and became convinced that his co-operation was essential to any prospect of peace in the subcontinent. On her return home she delivered her conclusions in an uncompromising report, The Condition of India, published in 1934. She visited Germany shortly after Hitler {{came to power in}} 1933, and published a pamphlet, The Terror in Germany, that documented early incidents of Nazi outrage. She collaborated with a refugee from Hitler's Germany, Edward Conze, to produce a major book, Why Fascism?, which condemned the Labour Party's gradualism and focus upon parliament as well as the failure of communist strategy, arguing for the need for grassroots workers' unity and revolution to check the threat of fascism across Europe. Meanwhile, her parliamentary prospects had been revived by her selection as Labour candidate for Jarrow, a Tyneside shipbuilding town. Jarrow had <b>been</b> <b>devastated</b> early in the 1930s by the run-down and closure of Palmers shipyard, the town's main source of employment. Early in 1934 Wilkinson led a deputation of Jarrow's unemployed to meet the prime minister, MacDonald, in his nearby Seaham constituency, and received sympathy but no positive action. She was unimpressed by the government's Special Areas Act, passed late in 1934 and designed to assist distressed areas such as Jarrow; she thought the legislation provided inadequate funding, and benefited employers more than workers.|$|E

5|$|Soon after, an {{imperial}} investigation into Gubazes's murder {{brought to light}} Martin's culpability. His military successes spared his life, but cost him his command; he was replaced as magister militum per Armeniam by Justin in spring 557. It was in this capacity that in late 557 Justin received the first Avar embassy to the Byzantine Empire. The Avars, who had fled their ancestral lands in Central Asia before {{the rise of the}} Göktürks, asked for imperial protection and for land to settle on. Justin forwarded them to Constantinople, where they arrived in December. Turned away from the Empire and towards the plains of the Ukraine by Justinian, the Avars defeated enemy after enemy and eventually reached the northeastern bank of the Danube in 561/562. There they again encountered Justin, who had just been transferred to the command of the quaestura exercitus covering the lower Danubian limes (the Limes Moesiae). At this time, the Avars demanded to settle in Byzantine imperial territory in Scythia Minor, whose defences had <b>been</b> <b>devastated</b> by a recent Kotrigur invasion led by Zabergan. Here, Justin played a crucial role and gained great fame, by learning of the Avars' intentions and warning Justinian. Consequently, the Avar embassy to Constantinople was detained while the Byzantine defences were put in order. With Justin continuing to maintain a careful watch over the Danube river, the Avars contented themselves with the annual subsidy paid by Byzantium, and left the Empire in peace for some years to come.|$|E
