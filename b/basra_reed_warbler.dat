5000|$|The <b>Basra</b> <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> (Acrocephalus griseldis) is a [...] "warbler" [...] of {{the genus}} Acrocephalus. It is an endemic breeder in East and {{southern}} Iraq and Israelhttp://www.birdlife.org/news/news/2007/08/basra_israel.html in extensive beds of papyrus and reeds. It is easily mistaken for the great reed warbler but is a bit smaller, has whiter under parts and has a narrower, longer and more pointed bill. It winters in East Africa. It is a very rare vagrant in Europe. The call is a gruff 'chaar', deeper than a reed warbler's.|$|E
50|$|The Pagan <b>reed</b> <b>warbler,</b> Aguiguan <b>reed</b> <b>warbler,</b> and Saipan <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> are {{considered}} subspecies by some taxonomists.|$|R
50|$|The Eurasian <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> looks {{similar to}} the great <b>reed</b> <b>warbler,</b> but the great <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> is larger in size and has a {{stronger}} supercilium.|$|R
50|$|The Oriental <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> (Acrocephalus orientalis) is a {{passerine}} bird {{of eastern}} Asia {{belonging to the}} <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> genus Acrocephalus. It was formerly classified as a subspecies of the great <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> (A. arundinaceus) of western Eurasia.|$|R
40|$|The <b>Basra</b> <b>Reed</b> <b>Warbler</b> (Acrocephalus griseldis) {{is one of}} the {{flagship}} bird species of Mesopotamia. Before Al-Sheikhly, Nader, and Barbanera (2013), very little was known on the breeding ecology of this species in the southern marshes of Iraq. Al-Sheikhly and co-workers carried out an intensive field research in 2006 – 2007 and 2011 – 2012, and produced data on the biology of the <b>Basra</b> <b>Reed</b> <b>Warbler,</b> this representing the first contribution to the conservation of the species in Iraq. In their Comment, Porter et al. (2014) question part of the findings provided by Al-Sheikhly et al. (2013). Nevertheless, Porter et al. do not provide any opposing experimental evidence. In this reply, we disclose in more detail information so as to confirm the reliability of our research. Porter et al. (2014) focus on three issues: (1) gaps in methodology; (2) data anomalies; and (3) acknowledgments. In this Response, we address each of these three issues...|$|E
40|$|The {{population}} of the <b>Basra</b> <b>Reed</b> <b>Warbler,</b> Acrocephalus griseldis, which has a limited range confined to the marshlands of central and southern Iraq, has declined substantially due to massive degradation of its main breeding habitat in the Iraqi marshes during the 1980 s and 1990 s. The breeding habitat and breeding biology is described here. We discovered a remarkable extension of the breeding range in the extreme west of Iraq...|$|E
40|$|This {{case study}} about the ethical {{behaviour}} {{in the field}} of scholarly publishing documents an exception on the rule for research articles in the medical journal BMJ Open that ICMJE disclosure forms of authors must be made available on request. The ICMJE, the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors, has developed these forms for the disclosure of conflicts of interest for authors of medical publications. The case refers to the form of the corresponding author of an article in BMJ Open on retraction notices (Moylan and Kowalczuk, 2016). The corresponding author {{is a member of the}} council of COPE, the Committee on Publication Ethics. I will argue that the unavailability of the form relates to personal conflicts of interest with the corresponding author about my efforts to retract a fatally flawed study on the breeding biology of the <b>Basra</b> <b>Reed</b> <b>Warbler</b> Acrocephalus griseldis. I describe my attempts to get the form and I will argue that its unavailability can be attributed to partial behaviour by BMJ, the publisher of BMJ Open. This study complements other sources reporting ethical issues at COPE...|$|E
50|$|The {{northern}} Marquesan <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> (Acrocephalus percernis) is {{a species}} of Old World warbler in the family Acrocephalidae.

40|$|We {{report on}} the second case of a <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> x great <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> hybrid (Acrocephalus scirpaceus and A. arundinaceus). The bird was {{captured}} during a standardised ringing session in Belgium in autumn 1999, and fell between the parental species in all measurements. Molecular analyses of two microsatellite loci verified that the bird was a female that had a <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> father and a great <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> mother...|$|R
50|$|Most taxonomists regard Garrett's <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> and the Moorea <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> as distinct. They {{used to be}} {{considered}} subspecies.|$|R
40|$|Substantial genetic {{variation}} is hypothesised {{to be necessary}} for the long-term survival of species. Therefore, a major aim in conservation is to maintain and restore variation in small and endangered populations. However, in most populations the amount of {{genetic variation}} and, thus, the potential threats posed by limited variation are unknown. In the present study, we assess genetic variation, both at 10 microsatellite loci and at the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), in three closely related Acrocephalus warbler species with contrasting demographies. We found that the recently bottlenecked, island endemic, Seychelles warbler (A. sechellensis; SW) has substantially reduced microsatellite and MHC diversity compared to the widespread great reed warbler (A. arundinaceus; GRW). In contrast, another endangered species with a small breeding range, the <b>Basra</b> <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> (A. griseldis; BRW), harboured as much variation as did the GRW. This suggests that significant genetic variation and, therefore, adaptive potential, remains in the BRW - a situation that should hold as long as its habitat and numbers are maintained. Our study {{is one of the}} first to assess genetic variation at both 'non-critical' microsatellite markers and 'critical' MHC loci within endangered species. The two types of loci provided a similar picture of the genetic variation in the species we studied, but this has not been the case in studies of some other species. Using a combination of specific functional loci and genome-wide random markers appears to be the best way to assess the threat posed by reduced genetic diversity...|$|E

5|$|The species {{exhibits}} {{no sexual}} dimorphism, {{and characteristics of}} the young are unknown. As the only passerine on the island, {{there is no chance}} that this species may be confused with any other. The Nauru <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> is slightly smaller than the Carolinian <b>reed</b> <b>warbler,</b> which is also lighter in colour, with a more contrasting eyebrow. The nightingale <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> is substantially larger, and the Oriental <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> has a duller colouration, with whiter underparts.|$|R
50|$|The {{speckled}} <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> or streaked <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> (Acrocephalus sorghophilus) is {{a species}} of Old World warbler in the family Acrocephalidae.|$|R
500|$|A 2009 phylogenic {{study of}} the family Acrocephalidae did not include this species, and as {{recently}} as 2010 its relation {{with other members of}} the genus was unknown. A 2011 analysis of mitochondrial DNA showed that the Nauru <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> forms a clade with the [...] Australian <b>reed</b> <b>warbler,</b> the bokikokiko, the southern Marquesan <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> and a now-extinct species from Pagan Island in the Marianas. The closest relative of the Nauru <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> appears to be the extinct warbler from Pagan. This is currently named as a subspecies of the nightingale <b>reed</b> <b>warbler,</b> A. luscinius yamashinae, but that species is polyphyletic, and the Pagan form, which has been proposed as a new species, the Pagan <b>reed</b> <b>warbler,</b> is in a different clade to nightingale reed warblers from other islands.|$|R
50|$|Though the Nauru <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> is {{generally}} {{accepted as a}} species, some authorities, such as H. E. Wolters in Die Vogelarte der Erde (1980) and Howard and Moore in A Complete Checklist of the Birds of the World (1991), have considered it a subspecies of Acrocephalus luscinius, the nightingale <b>reed</b> <b>warbler.</b> Recent DNA studies have affirmed {{its status as a}} separate species. It is considered monotypic, meaning there are no recognised subspecies. The species is known by the English common names Finsch's reed-warbler, Nauru warbler, pleasant warbler, the Nauru reed-warbler, and the Nauru <b>reed</b> <b>warbler.</b> In the native Nauruan language, it is known as Itsirir. A 2009 phylogenic study of the family Acrocephalidae did not include this species, and as recently as 2010 its relation {{with other members of the}} genus was unknown. A 2011 analysis of mitochondrial DNA showed that the Nauru <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> forms a clade with the Australian <b>reed</b> <b>warbler,</b> the bokikokiko, the southern Marquesan <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> and a now-extinct species from Pagan Island in the Marianas.

50|$|The {{species is}} monotypic, {{and there is}} no {{significant}} geographical variation. The sexes are alike in appearance. Hybridisation with both <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> and Blyth's <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> has been occasionally recorded.|$|R
50|$|The Carolinian <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> or Caroline Islands <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> (Acrocephalus syrinx) is {{a species}} of Old World warbler in the Acrocephalidae family. It is found only on the Caroline Islands in Micronesia.|$|R
50|$|The Aguiguan <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> or Aguijan <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> (Acrocephalus nijoi) {{originally}} {{occurred on}} the Northern Mariana Island Aguigan. It is considered a subspecies of the nightingale <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> by some taxonomists. Of this subspecies there never have been reports of a substantial population. In 1982 only four up to possibly 15 birds of the subspecies have been counted, and since 1995 none has been sighted, despite extended efforts to find specimens.|$|R
50|$|The {{nightingale}} <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> or Guam <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> (Acrocephalus luscinius) is an extinct {{song bird}} endemic to Guam. The Chamorro {{name for the}} bird is ga ‘kaliso. It has not been reported since the late 1960s and presumed extinct.|$|R
