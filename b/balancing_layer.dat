40|$|In recent years, an {{extensive}} academic and industrial literature {{has been developed}} {{to determine how much}} such variable energy resources (VERs) may be integrated and how to best mitigate their impacts. While certainly insightful within the context of their application, many integration studies have methodological limitations in that they are case specific, address a single control function of power grid balancing operations, and are often not validated by simulation. This paper presents a holistic method for the assessment of power grid imbalances induced by VERs based upon the concept of enterprise control. It consists within a single package a three-layer enterprise control simulator which includes most of the balancing operation functionality found in traditional power systems. The control layers include a resource scheduling layer composed of a security-constrained unit commitment, a <b>balancing</b> <b>layer</b> composed of a security-constrained economic dispatch, and a regulation layer. The proposed method is validated by a set of numerical simulations. The sequel to this paper submitted to the same issue provides a set of extensive results that demonstrate how power grid balancing operations systematically address VER integration...|$|E

The hens were divided into 5 treatment groups with 90 layers per treatment and 30 layers in each replicate per treatment group following completely randomized design. During molt period (2 Weeks), experimental birds {{were randomly assigned to}} five-treatment groups viz., A (15 ppm copper sulphate), B (20 ppm zinc oxide), C (20 ppm aluminium oxide), D (<b>balanced</b> <b>layer</b> diet without added minerals) and E (without induced molting as control). The birds in groups A, B, C and D were offered respective experimental diets at the rate of 30 g/bird except bird's in-group E (ad libitum) and lighting program was followed as 12 L: 12 D. During rest period (3 Weeks) the birds in groups A, B, C and D were given respective experimental diet at the rate of 50 g/bird for first 2 weeks of the rest period. During 3 rd week of rest period the birds in groups A, B, C and D were given experimental diets at the rate of 60 g/bird and were placed on lighting program of 14 L: 10 D. During production phase, the birds of all groups were fed a <b>balanced</b> <b>layer</b> diet (ad libitum) and birds were placed again on lighting program of 16 L: 8 D. The results showed that the birds fed diets A, B and C showed greater (p 0. 05) in ovarian weights were found among minerals supplemented groups A, B and C. The non-molted birds (group E) exhibited the greatest (p< 0. 05) feed intake over the 2 weeks molt whereas birds on minerals supplemented diets ate the least (p< 0. 05) feed. On average non-molted hens fed a <b>balanced</b> <b>layer</b> diet and molted hens fed without minerals diet had lower (p< 0. 05) egg production when compared with molted hens fed mineral added diets after 20 weeks post molt.

40|$|This thesis {{showed that}} low {{temperature}} (250 C) SPE of stoichiometrically balanced ion implanted GaAs layers can yield good epitaxial recovery for doses near the amorphization threshold. For 250 C anneals, {{most of the}} regrowth occurred in the first 10 min. HRTEM revealed much lower stacking fault density in the co-implanted sample than in the As-only and Ga-only samples with comparable doses. After low temp annealing, the nonstoichiometric samples had {{a large number of}} residual defects. For higher dose implants, very high temperatures (700 C) were needed to remove residual defects for all samples. The stoichiometrically <b>balanced</b> <b>layer</b> did not regrow better than the Ga-only and As-only samples. The co-implanted sample exhibited a thinner amorphous layer and a room temperature (RT) annealing effect.

Mechanisms for solid phase crystallization in (100) GasAs is discussed: nucleation and growth of randomly oriented crystallites and SPE. These two mechanisms compete in compound semiconductors at much lower temperatures than in Si. For the low dose As-only and Ga-only samples with low-temp anneals, both mechanisms are active. For this amorphization threshold dose, crystallites remain in the amorphous layer for all as-implants. 250 C annealing showed recrystallization from the surface and bulk for these samples; for the co-implant, the mechanism is not evident...|$|R

An index is used for efficient query processing and layer-based indexing methods are representative to perform the top-k query processing efficiently. However, the existing methods have a problem of high index building time for multidimensional and large data; thus, {{it is difficult to}} use them. In this paper, we proposed a new concept of constructing layer-based index, which is called unbalanced layer (UB-Layer). The existing methods construct a <b>layer</b> as a <b>balanced</b> <b>layer</b> with outermost data and wrap the rest of the input data. However, UB-Layer constructs a layer as an unbalanced layer that does not wrap the rest of the data.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we study}} {{performance}} optimization for {{scalable video coding}} and multicast over networks. Multi-path video streaming, network coding based routing, and network flow control are jointly optimized to maximize a network utility function defined over heterogeneous receivers. Content priority of video coding layers is considered during the flow routing to determine the optimal multicast paths and associated data rates for each layer. Our optimization scheme attempts to find content distribution meshes with minimum path costs for each video coding layer while satisfying the inter-layer dependency during scalable video coding. Based on primal decomposition and primal-dual analysis, we develop a decentralized algorithm with two optimization levels to solve the performance optimization problem. We also prove the stability and convergence of the proposed iterative algorithm using Lyapunov theories. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm not only achieves the max-flow throughput using network coding, but also provides better video quality with <b>balanced</b> <b>layered</b> access for heterogeneous receivers.

Available high-quality data reveal a dynamically relevant four-layer description that is {{a departure from the}} mean profile four-layer description traditionally and nearly universally ascribed to turbulent wall flows. Each of the four layers is characterized by a pre-dominance of two of the three terms in the governing equations, and thus the mean dynamics of these four layers are unambiguously defined.

40|$|Graduation date: 1993 The {{dataflow}} {{model of}} computation {{differs from the}} traditional control-flow model of computation in {{that it does not}} utilize a program counter to sequence instructions in a program. Instead, the execution of instructions is based solely on the availability of their operands. Thus, an instruction is executed in a dataflow computer when all of its operands are available. This asynchronous nature of the dataflow model of computation allows the exploitation of fine-grain parallelism inherent in programs. Although the dataflow model of computation exploits parallelism, the problem of optimally allocating a program to processors belongs to the class of NP-complete problems. Therefore, one of the major issues facing designers of dataflow multiprocessors is the proper allocation of programs to processors. The problem of program allocation lies in maximizing parallelism while minimizing interprocessor communication costs. The culmination of {{research in the area of}} program allocation has produced the proposed method called the <b>Balanced</b> <b>Layered</b> Allocation Scheme that utilizes heuristic rules to strike a balance between computation time and communication costs in dataflow multiprocessors. Specifically, the proposed allocation scheme utilizes Critical Path and Longest Directed Path heuristics when allocating instructions to processors.

A {{study was designed to}} evaluate caecal parameters (pH, short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and bacterial diversity) in layer hens fed on balanced diets containing graded concentrations of W-DDGS. A total of 32 layer hens (Bovans Brown strain at 27 weeks of age) were randomly allocated to one of 4 dietary treatments containing W-DDGS at 0, 60, 120 or 180 g/kg. Each treatment was fed to 8 replicate individually housed layer hens over a 5 -d acclimatisation period, followed by a 4 -week trial. Individual feed intakes were monitored and all eggs were collected daily for weeks 2, 3 and 4 of the trial, weighed and an assessment of eggshell “dirtiness” made. All hens were culled on d 29 and caecal pH and SCFAs measured. Polymerase chain reaction denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of the bacterial 16 S rDNA gene was used to assess total bacterial diversity of luminal caecal content from hens fed the 0 and 180 g W-DDGS/kg diets. Unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) dendrograms were generated from DGGE banding patterns. Increasing W-DDGS dietary concentrations resulted in a more acidic caecal environment. Caecal SCFAs were unaffected by diet aside from a quadratic effect for molar proportions of isobutyric acid.

After comparison of simulation result with instrumental results, difference between soil water reserves was calculated. Normalized mean square error (NRMSE) for the post of ornamental shrubs during the vegetation season in 2009 was 0. 80, and 2. 76 % for the lawn. However, in the same period in 2010, it was 0. 21 % for ornamental shrubs and 1. 54 % for the lawn.

Detailed {{studies were carried out}} to investigate the effects of design parameters on the performance of DWELL photodetectors, along with fundamental studies to determine the intraband optical and electronic properties of such structures. Using the results of these studies, an optimised structure was designed. In addition, the observation of a strong bias dependent spectral photoresponse demonstrated the capability of post growth spectral tunability within the long wavelength IR (LWIR) atmospheric window. Various approaches were investigated for enhancing the performance of quantum dot (QD) based devices. The main shortcoming of QDIPs versus quantum well infrared photodetectors (QWIPs) has been addressed i. e. the low dot density, which prohibits the high doping of these structures. The use of an antimonide surfactant to enhance the dot density in DWELL QDIPs is presented here for the first time. Also a method for decreasing the dark current in QDIPs was investigated, via the use of wide band gap AIGaAs barriers. Another technique using GaP strain <b>balancing</b> <b>layers</b> to reduce the strain in multilayer structures and allow the growth of > 20 layer QD devices was illustrated. The effects of intermixing via thermal annealing are also reported in for DWELL QDIPs. As part of this study, the possibility of using such a technique to shift the spectral photoresponse across the 8 - 12 J [...] lm LWIR window is demonstrated, and it is shown that the performance still remains in a competitive range within the LWIR range. Non-linear two photon absorption in QDIPs was demonstrated and studied. As a result of this study, the capability of QDIPs to operate as quadratic detectors in the far-infrared was established, which could prove very significant, since detector availability is reduced in that range.
