40|$|In {{this paper}} Experimental and Finite Element Analysis of <b>Baseframe</b> for Rigidity is presented. The {{assurance}} of rigidity as per API 610 is mandatory for pumps <b>baseframe</b> supplied in petrochemical industry. A proven rigidity test procedure {{is used for}} testing the structural stiffness of <b>baseframe</b> in line with API 610 clause 6. 3. 5. For typical <b>baseframe,</b> the stiffness is measured by means of rigidity test (actual measurement) for different load cases. The test is carried out to check the conformance of the existing design to API 610 stiffness requirement. Since the existing design fails to meet this requirement, few potential design modifications are suggested. Thesemodified cases are simulated using FEA techniques for stiffness qualification. ANSYS is used for simulation of these cases including that of existing design, for bench marking and comparison purpose. The results of FE analysis are presented in terms of deflection at coupling side shaft end (guideline form API 610), which is supported between bearings in pump bearing housing at static condition. Based on these results, best feasible design solution is proposed and validated experimentally...|$|E

Due to its high stability, double-lattice design decreased {{the length of}} panels and make the bridge's parts easier. The presence of a support column in trusses allowed to simplify the design of cradles and <b>baseframes,</b> as well facilitated the design of connections between bearing floor beams and trusses. Furthermore, Beleloubski made improvements in the bridge structure by proposing the device of 'free carriageway', which later {{came to be called}} [...] "the Russian support method".|$|R
40|$|Finding the {{trajectory}} of sports persons in videos {{can be done in}} various ways. We address this problem for rugby 7 s under difficult conditions, such as occlusion, a small camera angle with respect to the horizon, zooming, and supporters standing nearly in the field. A methodology is presented that processes videos of rugby 7 s games during which simultaneously the camera parameters are derived - stating its location, orientation and internal settings such as focal length, and the position of the rugby players within the image plane are detected, to tracks their movements with respect to the ground plane. We propose a new method to determine the camera parameters effectively, making use of the recurring nature of the camera state, by only using a limited set of reference frames, called <b>baseframes.</b> Tracking is performed in the ground plane, using a tracking-by-detection approach with a Kalman filter to dynamically model the tracklets. An evaluation of our methodology shows the potential of our methodology. However, it is recommend to improve of the conditions under which tracking is performed...|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} an {{investigation}} of the performance of three basic precision pointing and tracking control subsystems considered for application to satellite to satellite optical communication missions are discussed. The three-control subsystems include: (1) gyro-stabilized, (2) mass-stabilized and (3) complementary filter. The sources of error included in the analysis included: (1) sensor noise from the optical detector, (2) host satellite <b>baseframe</b> vibrational noise and (3) frictional and bearing noise. The measured vibrational and disturbance data from the LANDSAT satellite was used to generate the power spectral density parameter needed to model the <b>baseframe</b> noise environments of the two satellites used for the evaluation. The results of the study indicate that the 1 microradian rms pointing and tracking accuracy may be achieved with either the gyro-stabilized or the complementary filter approach...|$|E
40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a switched reluctance generator with a C-shaped stator core. The switched reluctance generator comprises a <b>baseframe,</b> wherein {{a plurality of}} stators and rotors are arranged on the baseframe; the <b>baseframe</b> comprises a rotary part used for fixing the rotors and a fixed part used for fixing the stators; each stator comprises a C-shaped stator core with a coil arranged thereon, and stator poles are arranged at two ends of an opening of the C-shaped stator core; each rotor comprises a rotor pole; and the plurality of rotors can simultaneously conduct linear and rotary motion relative to the stator poles of each stator in sequence under the action of an external force, so that the reluctance of a magnetic circuit changes and an induced electromotive force is generated in the coils. According to the invention, as the C-shaped stator cores are adopted and the plurality of stators and rotors are arranged on the <b>baseframe,</b> the rotors can simultaneously conduct linear and rotary motion relative to the stators; the rotors which are smaller are easy to drive and are suitable for power generation during low-speed operation, such as wind power generation; and the switched reluctance generator provided by the invention has a simple and reliable integral structure and is flexible in control and low in manufacturing cost. 本发明涉及一种带C形定子铁心的开关磁阻发电机，包括机座，机座上设置有多个定子和转子，机座包括用于固定转子的旋转部和用于固定定子的固定部，其中，定子包括C形定子铁心，C形定子铁心上设置有线圈，在C形定子铁心开口的两端为定子极，转子包括转子极，多个转子可在外力作用下依次相对每个定子的定子极同时做直线和旋转运动、使得磁路的磁阻发生变化并在线圈中产生感应电动势。本发明通过采用C形定子铁心，且在机座上设置多个定子和转子，使得转子可同时相对定子做直线和旋转运动，其转子较小，比较容易被驱动，适合用于低速运转发电的情况，例如风力发电，且整体结构简单可靠控制灵活，制造成本低。Department of Electrical EngineeringInventor name used in this publication: 郑家伟Inventor name used in this publication: 薛向党Title in Traditional Chinese: 一種帶C形定子鐵心的開關磁阻發電機Chin...|$|E
40|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} {{that the main}} sources of noise and vibration in canopied Diesel generators are the Diesel engine, the fan and the alternator. This paper focuses on the flanking transmission of noise and vibration from the sources to the canopy and <b>baseframe.</b> The canopy is basically a combination of large rectangular steel plates which behave as noise radiating panels converting vibration into noise which then radiates into the environment. The objective of the research is to identify the main transmission paths and correlate noise and vibration levels. For this purpose a number of measurement positions have been located on the engine, fan, alternator, AVMs, <b>baseframe,</b> canopy and other relevant parts in order to observe levels of noise and vibration. Measurements of the attenuation or amplification of vibration and hence noise radiation has enabled critical areas {{to be identified as}} well as overall noise levels in the vicinity of diesel-generator sets...|$|E
40|$|With the {{realisation}} of the α-tool, ASML is progressing {{with the}} pre-commercialisation phase of its EUVL development. We {{report on the}} progress {{in the development of}} several key modules of the α-tool, including the source, wafer stage and reticle stage, wafer handling, <b>baseframe,</b> and optics modules. We demonstrate that the focus sensor meets its vacuum requirements, and that both stages after limited servo optimisation approach the required scanning performance. A particle detection system has been build for the qualification of the reticle handling module, and preliminary results show that 50 nm particles can be detected. The optics lifetime program showed substantial progress by utilising caplayers to MoSi samples in order to suppress oxidation caused by H 2 O molecules under EUV illumination: a suppression ≥ 100 × is achieved, compared to uncapped MoSi...|$|E
