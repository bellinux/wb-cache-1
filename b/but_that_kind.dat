500|$|Anna Silman of Salon named [...] "Dear Future Husband" [...] {{the worst}} song of 2015, criticizing its [...] "aggressively heteronormative message" [...] and Trainor's vocal performance. Mic's Kate Beaudoin heavily criticized the song's lyrics, writing, [...] "This song teaches kids {{that men are}} born to be husbands and women are born to be wives. <b>But</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> of {{rationale}} wears away at a woman's right to be anything she wants." [...] Nolan Feeney of TIME was critical of the song, writing, [...] "What she’s describing is not a relationship—it’s a Meghtatorship." [...] The Los Angeles Times Mikael Wood had a mixed opinion on the song, stating that Trainor seems to be sketching [...] "a union of equals". But, added that she later expressed more conventional ideas about the female character in a marriage.|$|E
500|$|The Broken Ear {{introduced}} the character General Alcazar to the series, {{who went on}} to become a recurring character who appeared in three further Adventures. It was the first in the series to begin and end in Belgium, the first to deal with the hunt for a specific object, and the last in which Tintin is seen taking part in journalistic activity. It was also the first time that the Adventures featured Tintin's flat at 26 Labrador Road, in which Chinese mementos from The Blue Lotus are visible. Influenced by the films of Alfred Hitchcock, Hergé inserted an illustration of himself into the second frame. He also made reference to contemporary news stories in the book, having a radio announcer discuss the ongoing Second Italo-Ethiopian War at the start of the story; this was removed in the colour edition. At the end of the story, Hergé killed off Ramón and Alonso and depicted them being dragged to Hell by devils; the killing of the story's antagonists was something not repeated in future stories. This upset the editors of Cœurs Vaillants, who asked Hergé to change the scene; annoyed at their request, he later commented, [...] "On the surface it cost me nothing, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> of addition was really difficult for me." [...] For their serialisation of the story, he replaced that particular frame with one in which Tintin vouchsafed the souls of Ramón and Alonso for God.|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} {{for the first}} issue, David Pepose of Newsarama wrote, [...] "The biggest victory that Bendis scores with Miles Morales is that he makes us care about him, and care about him quickly. Even though we're still {{scratching}} the surface of what makes him tick, we're seeing the world through his eyes, and it's similar to Peter Parker's but a whole lot tougher. <b>But</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> of Parker-style guilt—that neurotic, nearly masochistic tendency for self-sacrifice that comes with great power and greater responsibility—is still intact." [...] Jesse Schedeen of IGN wrote that [...] "Miles still feels like {{a bit of an}} outsider in his own book. Bendis never quite paints a complete picture of Miles—his thoughts, motivations, personality quirks, and so forth. Miles is largely a reactionary figure throughout the book as he confronts struggles like registering for a charter school or dealing with family squabbles." [...] Schedeen also opined that [...] "Miles occupies a more urban, racially diverse, and tense landscape. All the story doesn't pander or lean too heavily on elements like racial and economic tension to move forward. Miles is simply a character who speaks to a slightly different teen experience, and one not nearly as well represented in superhero comics as Peter's". James Hunt of CBR.com rated the issue #1 four and a half out of five stars, lauding Bendis for emphasizing Morales' character and his supporting cast instead of rushing him into costume. The first issue holds a score of 7.8 out of 10 at the review aggregator website Comic Book Roundup, based on 11 reviews, while the final issue, #28, holds a score of 8.3, based on 9 reviews, and the series overall holds an average issue rating of 8.3.|$|E
5000|$|Jordan Ireland was {{critical}} about the album: [...] "With this album I don’t {{really feel like}} we nailed it, we’re definitely falling {{into a lot of}} categories that’ve been done before and I don’t feel like it’s anything completely original or anything like <b>that,</b> <b>but</b> <b>that’s</b> <b>kind</b> of the goal that we’re heading towards." ...|$|R
5000|$|In a {{retrospective}} {{assessment of the}} film, critic Thomas Waugh noted that the film [...] "milks {{in its own way}} the then recent but in fact perennial abuse scandals in the Catholic church." [...] Chris Parry of eFilmcritic.com said the film [...] "beats the tar out of the second and third films in the Prom Night series, <b>but</b> <b>that's</b> <b>kind</b> of like beating a wheelchair kid with a rake; though it might be fun for a moment or two, it's hardly a landmark achievement." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He gets indignant now and then. Virtuous {{people are}} {{generally}} content to resist temptation, but Wallace {{is apt to}} attack the tempter. I dare say it isn't wise, <b>but</b> <b>that's</b> the <b>kind</b> of man he is." ...|$|R
2500|$|In a later {{interview}} to TIME magazine, the lead air marshal aboard the flight stated, [...] "there {{was never a}} time when my main partner or I felt there was an imminent threat to that airplane or the passengers." [...] and [...] "I understand why the passenger felt some anxiety about activity on Flight 327 <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> of activity was unusual but not a security incident. There was never {{a threat to the}} plane." [...] The Homeland Security report produced by the Inspector General revealed that this air marshal had noticed that the Syrians' travel visas were expired but the air marshal failed to report this information to his supervisors, claiming it was out of his jurisdiction.|$|E
2500|$|On 24 February 2012, in {{a speech}} in Nabi Sheet for the [...] "remembrance of the fallen martyrs Abbas al-Musawi, Ragheb Harb, and Imad Mughniyah," [...] Hasan Nasrallah said, [...] "I say that the American {{administration}} and the American mentality lacks nothing from Satanism. <b>But</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> of behavior and that kind of mistreatment of holy books [...] and prophets, and the prophets' sanctities, and others' sanctities; this behavior is Israeli and let us say it is Jewish, between quotation marks, - now they will say that this is anti-Semitism - [...] the Holy Quran told us about this people: how they attacked their prophets, and how they killed their prophets, and how they affronted their prophets, and how they affronted Jesus Christ, peace be upon him, and how they affronted Mary, peace be upon her, and how they affronted Allah's great messenger Mohammad, May God exalt and bring peace upon him and his family. This [...] pattern about affronting holy books, and prophets, and messengers, and sanctities; this is their mentality, and maybe they want to push things more and more toward a religious war worldwide." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, no! The man {{is trying}} to ruin me, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> of meanness isn't in his line. Perhaps I'd better say that I never had clothes like those and that I sold no land of Cyril's." ...|$|E

50|$|As for Josey Wales, I saw the {{parallels}} {{to the modern}} day at that time. Everybody gets tired of it, but it never ends. A war is a horrible thing, but it's also a unifier of countries... Man becomes his most creative during war. Look {{at the amount of}} weaponry that was made in four short years of World War II—the amount of ships and guns and tanks and inventions and planes and P-38s and P-51s, and just the urgency and the camaraderie, and the unifying. <b>But</b> <b>that's</b> <b>kind</b> of a sad statement on mankind, if that's what it takes.|$|R

5000|$|In Pervert in the Pulpit: Morality in the Works of David Lynch, Jeff Johnson {{states that}} Shelly {{is one of}} the [...] "salvageable characters" [...] saying [...] "Shelly, for instance, after so much abuse from Leo, gains a sense of {{self-confidence}} and a better self-image, giving up her scamming with Bobby and even entering the Miss Twin Peaks competition." [...] Rolling Stone praised the distinctiveness of the character stating that [...] "Shelly Johnson was further away from the show's center than almost any of them. <b>But</b> <b>that's</b> <b>kind</b> of the point. Yes, she extricated herself from the high-school hell that consumed Laura by dropping out and getting married to brooding, drug-running trucker Leo Johnson. <b>But</b> <b>that</b> didn't save her from drudgery, boredom, betrayal, and abuse. It just moved the venue and raised the stakes." ...|$|R
