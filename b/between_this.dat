5|$|A major crustal lineament {{known as}} the Archibarca lineament intersects the main {{volcanic}} arc at Lastarria. Other volcanic centres such as Galán and ore deposits are also found on this lineament. The intersection <b>between</b> <b>this</b> lineament and the arc may act as a weakness zone that focuses the ascent of magma. Farther south lie volcanoes such as Wheelwright Caldera and Cerro Blanco, the last of which shows evidence of recent unrest.|$|E
5|$|Compartment {{syndrome}} is a clinical diagnosis, i.e., no diagnostic test conclusively proves its presence or absence, but direct {{measurement of the}} pressure in a fascial compartment, and the difference <b>between</b> <b>this</b> pressure and the blood pressure, {{may be used to}} assess its severity. High pressures in the compartment and a small difference between compartment pressure and blood pressure indicate that the blood supply is likely to be insufficient, and that surgical intervention may be needed.|$|E
5|$|Griesbach {{agreed with}} Woide and {{expanded}} on Michaelis' point of view. If this manuscript has been corrupted from a version, {{it is more}} reasonable to suspect the Coptic, the version {{of the country in}} which it was written. <b>Between</b> <b>this</b> manuscript and both the Coptic and Syriac versions there is a remarkable coincidence. According to Griesbach the manuscript follows three different editions: the Byzantine in the Gospels, the Western in the Acts and General epistles, and the Alexandrian in the Pauline epistles. Griesbach designated the codex by letter A.|$|E

5|$|It was {{not until}} the British {{discovery}} of the iconic Charnia in 1957 that the pre-Cambrian was seriously considered as containing life. This frond-shaped fossil was found in England's Charnwood Forest, and due to the detailed geological mapping of the British Geological Survey there was no doubt these fossils sat in Precambrian rocks. Palaeontologist Martin Glaessner finally, in 1959, made the connection <b>between</b> <b>this</b> and the earlier finds and with a combination of improved dating of existing specimens and an injection of vigour into the search many more instances were recognised.|$|E
5|$|Lake Waiau {{provided}} {{drinking water}} for the workers. Native chiefs would also dip the umbilical cords of newborn babies in its water, {{to give them the}} strength of the mountain. Use of the quarry declined <b>between</b> <b>this</b> period and contact with Americans and Europeans. As part of the ritual associated with quarrying, the workers erected shrines to their gods; these and other quarry artifacts remain at the sites, most of which lie within what is now the Mauna Kea Ice Age Reserve.|$|E

5|$|Like {{most other}} members of its genus, the phylogenetic {{position}} of the blacktip reef shark remains indeterminate. Based on morphology, Jack Garrick proposed in 1982 that the closest relative of the blacktip reef shark was the nervous shark (C.cautus). Leonard Compagno's 1988 morphological analysis suggested affinity not only <b>between</b> <b>this</b> species and the nervous shark, but also four other species, and could not resolve their relationships further. A 1998 allozyme analysis by Gavin Naylor again yielded ambiguous results, finding that the blacktip reef shark forms a polytomy (irresolvable group) with 10 other Carcharhinus species.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, in 1904, Herbert F. Standing {{had named}} a {{different}} species {{using the same}} name, Lemur jullyi, and named another species Lemur maziensis. He noted similarities <b>between</b> <b>this</b> group and the ruffed lemurs, then considered a single species, Lemur varius. In 1908, Standing named another species in the group, Lemur majori, and included his Lemur maziensis in L.jullyi. The name Pachylemur was introduced for these animals in 1948 by Charles Lamberton, who grouped Lemur insignis, Lemur majori, and Lemur jullyi in a subgenus of the genus Lemur.|$|E

5|$|The blue {{stingray}} (Dasyatis chrysonota) {{of southern}} Africa {{has long been}} regarded as {{a variant of the}} common stingray.
