40|$|AimsMembers of the claudin {{family are}} {{involved}} <b>in</b> <b>cancer</b> progression and are differentially expressed <b>in</b> subtypes of <b>breast</b> <b>cancer.</b> <b>Breast</b> <b>cancers</b> <b>in</b> BRCA 1 germ line mutation carriers have distinct clinicopathological characteristics. Biomarkers that discriminate between BRCA 1 -related and sporadic <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> cases {{are needed to}} improve early identification of mutation carriers. In this study we evaluated protein expression of five major claudins in BRCA 1 -related <b>breast</b> <b>cancers</b> <b>in</b> comparison with sporadic controls. Methods and resultsForty <b>breast</b> <b>cancers</b> <b>in</b> BRCA 1 mutation carriers and 40 age-matched sporadic <b>breast</b> <b>cancers</b> were immunohistochemically stained for claudins 1, 3, 4, 6 and 7. Total intratumoural expression levels were compared {{to those in the}} surrounding normal tissue. In addition, subcellular claudin expression was scored. Higher overexpression rates were observed for all five claudins in BRCA 1 -related <b>breast</b> <b>cancers</b> when compared to sporadic controls. In multivariate analysis, overexpression of claudin 3, 4, and 7 was mainly dependent on ER-status, whereas overexpression of claudin 6 and high membranous expression of claudin 1 were independent of other characteristics. ConclusionsBRCA 1 -related <b>breast</b> <b>cancers</b> are characterized by frequent overexpression of claudins. Especially claudin 1 and 6 expression may help to discriminate mutation carriers from sporadic <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> cases...|$|R
30|$|In conclusion, loss of SDHA or SDHB {{expression}} was detected in approximately 3 % of the <b>breast</b> <b>cancers</b> <b>in</b> this study. Patients with SDH-deficient <b>breast</b> <b>cancers</b> were younger at diagnosis and presented tumors of relatively low-grade histology.|$|R

5|$|In {{the view}} of the {{production}} team, Peggy's breast cancer was a catalyst, creating new dynamics and tensions amongst existing characters. Realism was also an issue. As a middle-aged woman, Peggy was epidemiologically at higher risk for developing <b>breast</b> <b>cancer.</b> <b>In</b> 2001, it was reported that Peggy's character was one of only a few media portrayals of older females to be given the disease, and source organisations have praised EastEnders for this.|$|E
5|$|Some anti-abortion {{activists have}} {{continued}} to advance a discredited causal link between abortion and <b>breast</b> <b>cancer.</b> <b>In</b> the United States, they have advanced state legislation that in several states requires health care providers to present abortion {{as a cause of}} breast cancer when counseling women who are seeking abortion. This political intervention culminated when the George W. Bush administration altered the National Cancer Institute website to suggest that abortion might cause <b>breast</b> <b>cancer.</b> <b>In</b> response to public concern over this intervention, the NCI convened a 2003 workshop bringing together over 100 experts on the issue. This workshop concluded that while some studies reported a statistical correlation between breast cancer and abortion, the strongest scientific evidence from large prospective cohort studies demonstrates that abortion is not associated with an increase in breast cancer risk, and that the positive findings were likely due to response bias.|$|E
5|$|As the {{commercial}} application of molecular diagnostics {{has become more}} important, so has the debate about patenting of the genetic discoveries at its heart. In 1998, the European Union's Directive 98/44/ECclarified that patents on DNA sequences were allowable. In 2010 in the US, AMP sued Myriad Genetics to challenge the latter's patents regarding two genes, BRCA1, BRCA2, which are associated with <b>breast</b> <b>cancer.</b> <b>In</b> 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court partially agreed, ruling that a naturally occurring gene sequence could not be patented.|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{investigated}} the association between cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen- 4 (CTLA- 4) polymorphisms and <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> susceptibility, but the results remained inconsistent. Therefore, we evaluated the relationship between four common CTLA- 4 polymorphisms and <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> risk by a meta-analysis, aiming to derive a comprehensive and precise conclusion. We searched EMBASE, Pubmed, Web of Science, CNKI, and Wanfang databases until July 18 th, 2016. Finally, ten eligible studies involving 4, 544 <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> patients and 4, 515 cancer-free controls were included; all these studies were from Asia. Odds ratio (OR) and 95 % confidence interval (CI) were {{used to evaluate the}} <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> risk <b>in</b> five genetic models. The results indicated that the CTLA- 4 + 49 A>G (rs 231775) polymorphism had a significant association with decreased <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> risk <b>in</b> allelic, homozygous, dominant and recessive models. Also, the + 6230 G>A (rs 3087243) polymorphism reduced <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> risk especially <b>in</b> the Chinese population under homozygous and recessive models. In contrast, the − 1661 A>G (rs 4553808) polymorphism increased <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> risk <b>in</b> allelic, heterozygous and dominant models, whereas − 1722 T>C (rs 733618) did not relate to <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> risk. <b>In</b> conclusion, CTLA- 4 polymorphisms significantly associate with <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> susceptibility <b>in</b> Asian populations, and different gene loci may have different effects on <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> development. Further large-scale studies including multi-racial populations are required to confirm our findings...|$|R
40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the effect of Malaysian jungle Tualang Honey (TH) on development of <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> induced by the carcinogen 7, 12 -dimethylbenz(α) anthracene (DMBA) in rats. Forty nulliparous female Sprague-Dawley rats were given 80 mg/kg DMBA then randomly divided into four groups: Group 1 served as a Control while Groups 2, 3 and 4 received 0. 2, 1. 0 or 2. 0 g/kg bodyweight/day of TH, respectively, for 150 days. Results showed that <b>breast</b> <b>cancers</b> <b>in</b> the TH-treated groups had slower size increment and smaller mean tumor size (≤ 2 cm 3) compared to Controls (≤ 8 cm 3). The number of <b>cancers</b> developing <b>in</b> TH-treated groups was also significantly fewer (P 0. 05).

5|$|In {{addition}} to <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> <b>in</b> men and women, mutations in BRCA2 {{also lead to}} {{an increased risk of}} ovarian, Fallopian tube, prostate, and pancreatic cancers, as well as malignant melanoma. In some studies, mutations in {{the central part of the}} gene have been associated with a higher risk of ovarian cancer and a lower risk of prostate cancer than mutations in other parts of the gene. Several other types of cancer have also been seen in certain families with BRCA2 mutations.|$|E
5|$|Lack of {{differentiation}} between homosexual and heterosexual women in medical studies that concentrate on health issues for women skews results for lesbians and non-lesbian women. Reports are inconclusive about occurrence of <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> <b>in</b> lesbians. It has been determined, however, {{that the lower}} rate of lesbians tested by regular Pap smears {{makes it more difficult}} to detect cervical cancer at early stages in lesbians. The risk factors for developing ovarian cancer rates are higher in lesbians than heterosexual women, perhaps because many lesbians lack protective factors of pregnancy, abortion, contraceptives, breast feeding, and miscarriages.|$|E
40|$|Q. Do oral {{contraceptives}} put {{women with a}} family history of <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> at increased risk? Evidence-based answer: No. Modern combined oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) don’t increase <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> risk <b>in</b> women with a family history (strength of recommendation [SOR]: B, systematic review of cohort, case-control studies). However, older, higher-dose OCPs (in use before 1975) did increase <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> risk <b>in</b> these women (SOR: C, case-control study). Similarly, modern OCPs don’t raise <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> risk <b>in</b> women with BRCA 1 / 2 mutations, although higher-dose, pre- 1975 OCPs did (SOR: B and C, a meta-analysis of cohort and case-control studies) ...|$|R

While acquiring his degree, he became a Christian Scientist and married Linda Cupp. After graduating from college, he spent several years as an instructor at a Jewish community center, then became a physical education teacher after inquiring about a Christian Science Monitor advertisement for a teaching position at Clairbourn School in San Gabriel, California. Linda died of <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> <b>in</b> 1987, and Paciorek married Karen Purdy two years later. Paciorek has four sons and four daughters. His nephew, Joey Paciorek, played in the Milwaukee Brewers minor league organization, and his sons, Pete and Mack, had minor league careers as well. While watching his son in training camp, Paciorek became an author after watching what he felt was improper instruction given to the players. He has since written two books, Plato & Socrates, Baseball's Wisest Fans and The Principle of Baseball, and All There is to Know About Hitting.|$|E
5|$|Minton {{received}} his basic {{education in a}} two-room schoolhouse in Georgetown, which he attended through eighth grade. He was exposed to politics from an early age; his father took him to several political rallies, including an 1895 speech by Democratic Party leader William Jennings Bryan. His father was a day laborer for the New Albany and St. Louis Air Line Railway. In 1898, he became disabled when he suffered heat stroke while working. His condition meant he could not work; the family became impoverished and had to subsist on the limited yield of their small farm. Minton's mother developed <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> <b>in</b> 1899. A traveling doctor attempted to remove her tumors in April 1900, performing the operation with her laid on the family dinner table, but she died during the procedure. The death was an emotional blow to Minton; thereafter, he refused to attend church and spoke against God, whom he blamed for his mother's death. Minton's father married Sarah Montague on December 3, 1901.|$|E

5|$|A non-pegylated {{liposomal}} doxorubicin, called Myocet, {{is approved}} in Europe and Canada {{for treatment of}} metastatic <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> <b>in</b> combination with cyclophosphamide, but has not {{been approved by the}} FDA for use in the United States. Unlike Doxil, the Myocet liposome does not have a polyethylene glycol coating, and therefore does not result in the same rate of hand-foot syndrome. The minimization of this side effect may allow for one-for-one (1:1) substitution with doxorubicin in the same treatment regimen, thereby improving safety with no loss of efficacy. Like Doxil, the liposomal encapsulation of the doxorubicin limits the cardiotoxicity. In theory, by limiting the cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin through liposomal encapsulation, it can be used safely in concurrent combination with other cardiotoxic chemotherapy drugs, such as trastuzumab. There is an FDA black box warning that trastuzumab cannot be used in concurrent combination with doxorubicin, only in sequential combination. Though concurrent combination of trastuzumab and doxorubicin in clinical studies found superior tumor response, the combination resulted in unacceptable cardiotoxicity, including risk of cardiac failure manifesting as congestive heart failure (CHF). Published phase II study results have shown that Myocet, trastuzumab, and paclitaxel can safely be used concurrently without the cardiac risk, as measured by reduction in LVEF function, while still achieving superior tumor response. This finding is the basis for the ongoing phase III trial for FDA approval.|$|E

40|$|CHEK 2 1100 delC is a moderate-risk cancer {{susceptibility}} allele that confers a high <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> risk <b>in</b> a polygenic setting. Gene expression profiling of CHEK 2 1100 delC <b>breast</b> <b>cancers</b> {{may reveal}} {{clues to the}} nature of the polygenic CHEK 2 model and its genes involved. Here, we report global gene expression profiles of a cohort of 155 familial <b>breast</b> <b>cancers,</b> including 26 CHEK 2 1100 delC mutant tumors. In line with previous work, all CHEK 2 1100 delC mutant tumors clustered among the hormone receptor-positive <b>breast</b> <b>cancers.</b> <b>In</b> the hormone receptor-positive subset, a 40 -gene CHEK 2 signature was subsequently defined that significantly associated with CHEK 2 1100 delC <b>breast</b> <b>cancers.</b> The identification of a CHEK 2 gene signature implies an unexpected biological homogeneity among the CHEK 2 1100 delC <b>breast</b> <b>cancers.</b> <b>In</b> addition, all 26 CHEK 2 1100 delC tumors classified as luminal intrinsic subtype <b>breast</b> <b>cancers,</b> with 8 luminal A and 18 luminal B tumors.

30|$|Based on {{the varying}} {{invitational}} policies between {{the rest of}} Finland and the Turku area in 2000 – 2010, and incidence prediction by an additive Poisson model (Dyba and Hakulinen 1994), we estimated the distribution of invasive <b>breast</b> <b>cancers</b> <b>in</b> Finland in 2020, when all women aged 50 – 69 years are expected to get an invitation to mammography screening in every two years (Government Decree on Screenings (1339 / 2006)). The Poisson model allowed for different age-specific changes of incidence rates on an additive scale over time (Dyba and Hakulinen 2000). The prediction was based on <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> incidence <b>in</b> ages 30 – 89 years in the ten-year period 1998 – 2007 preceding the expansion period of the invitational age in the national screening programme.
