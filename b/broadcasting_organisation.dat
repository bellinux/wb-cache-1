25|$|Following {{independence}} {{the only}} newspaper publisher and public <b>broadcasting</b> <b>organisation</b> in Tuvalu was the Broadcasting and Information Office (BIO) of Tuvalu. The Tuvalu Media Corporation (TMC) was a government-owned corporation established in 1999 {{to take over}} the radio and print based publications of the BIO. However, in 2008 operating as a corporation was determined not to be commercial viable and the Tuvalu Media Corporation then became the Tuvalu Media Department (TMD) under the Office of the Prime Minister.|$|E
25|$|India adopted DVB-T {{system for}} digital {{television}} in July 1999. The first DVB-T transmission was started on 26 January 2003 {{in the four}} major metropolitan cities by Doordarshan. Currently the terrestrial transmission is available in both digital and analog formats. 4 high power DVB-T transmitters were {{set up in the}} top 4 cities, which were later upgraded to DVB-T2 + MPEG4 and DVB-H standards. An additional 190 high power, and 400 low power DVB-T2 transmitters have been approved for Tier I, II and III cities of the country by 2017. The Indian telecom regulator, TRAI, had recommended the I to allow private broadcast companies to use the DTT technology, in 2005. So far, the Indian I ministry only permits private broadcast companies to use satellite, cable and IPTV based systems. The government's <b>broadcasting</b> <b>organisation</b> Doordarshan had started the free TV service over DVB - T2 to the mobile phone users from February 25 onwards and extended to cover 16 cities including the four metros from April 5, 2016.|$|E

25|$|Although {{no other}} <b>broadcasting</b> <b>organisation</b> was {{licensed}} in the UK until 1973, commercial competition soon opened up from overseas. The English language service of Radio Luxembourg began in 1933 {{as one of}} the earliest commercial radio stations broadcasting to Britain and Ireland. With no possibility of commercial broadcasting available from inside the UK, a former British Royal Air Force captain and entrepreneur (and from 1935 Conservative Party member of parliament) named Leonard F. Plugge set up his own International Broadcasting Company in 1931. The IBC began leasing time on transmitters in continental Europe and then reselling it as sponsored English-language programming aimed at audiences in Britain and Ireland. Because Plugge successfully demonstrated that State monopolies such as that of the BBC could be broken, other parties became attracted to the idea of creating a new commercial radio station specifically for this purpose. It was an important forerunner of pirate radio and modern commercial radio in the United Kingdom. The onset of World War II silenced {{all but one of the}} original IBC stations, only Radio Luxembourg continued its nightly transmissions to Britain.|$|E

2500|$|Another group, Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), {{led by a}} United Kingdom-based Biafran, Nnamdi Kanu, reinvigorated {{the quest}} for Biafran {{realisation}} in 2012. [...] He established a pirate radio station to champion the Biafran cause, Radio Biafra, which has been broadcasting at various frequencies around the world. [...] The Nigerian Government, through its broadcasting regulators, the <b>Broadcasting</b> <b>Organisation</b> of Nigerian (BON) and Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), has sought {{to clamp down on}} the UK-based station with limited success. On 17 November 2015, the Abia state police command seized an IPOB radio transmitter in Umuahia. Kanu was detained by the federal government and released on 24 April 2017.|$|E
2500|$|The opening {{ceremony}} {{began with a}} tribute to the Australian pastoral heritage of the Australian stockmen and the importance of the stock horse in Australia's heritage. It was produced and filmed by Sydney Olympic <b>Broadcasting</b> <b>Organisation</b> and the home nation broadcaster, Channel 7. [...] This was introduced by a lone rider, Steve Jefferys, and his rearing Australian Stock Horse Ammo. At the cracking of Jefferys' stockwhip, a further 120 riders entered the Stadium, their stock horses performing intricate steps, including forming the five Olympic Rings, to a special Olympics version of the theme which Bruce Rowland had previously composed for the 1982 film The Man from Snowy River.|$|E
2500|$|The {{format of}} the contest {{has changed over the}} years, though the basic tenets have always been thus: {{participant}} countries submit new original songs, which are performed live in a television programme transmitted across the Eurovision Network by the EBU simultaneously to all countries. A [...] "country" [...] as a participant is represented by one television broadcaster from that country: typically, but not always, that country's national public <b>broadcasting</b> <b>organisation.</b> The programme is hosted by one of the participant countries, and the transmission is sent from the auditorium in the host city. During this programme, after all the songs have been performed, the countries then proceed to cast votes for the other countries' songs: nations are not allowed to vote for their own song. At the end of the programme, the song with the most points is declared as the winner. The winner receives, simply, the prestige of having won—although it is usual for a trophy to be awarded to the winning songwriters, and the winning country is formally invited to host the event the following year.|$|E
