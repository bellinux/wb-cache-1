25|$|As Chief of Staff BEF Robertson had had Maurice, then Director of Military Operations at GHQ, {{prepare a}} study of an Ypres Offensive on 15 March 1915. The study had warned that the capture of Ostend and Zeebrugge “would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> {{enterprise}} {{so far as the}} nature of the country is concerned” and if successful “would not materially improve the military situation of the Allies in the western theatre” except in the unlikely event that it prompted a general German withdrawal – more likely it would leave the British defending a longer line supplied by only two lines of railway, at “a grave disadvantage” and “in a rather dangerous position” with their backs to the sea as the Germans counterattacked.|$|E
500|$|Following the {{recommendation}} {{that the site}} should be destroyed, the Royal Engineers stacked ten tons of British [...] bombs and captured German plastic explosive in the tunnels at Mimoyecques and detonated them on 9 May. This failed to achieve the desired effect, and on 14 May, a further 25 tons of explosives were used {{to bring down the}} north and south entrances to the railway tunnel into the site. A subsequent investigation by the British Bombing Research Mission concluded that the entrances had been heavily blocked and that it would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> and lengthy engineering task to reinstate them. The British action was taken without informing the French beforehand and infuriated Charles de Gaulle, who considered it a violation of France's national sovereignty.|$|E

500|$|In {{its product}} manual, the NAIT {{is said to}} have [...] "low {{continuous}} power output ... balanced by a very large peak current capacity so there are no restrictions on the size or type of loudspeaker that may be used. But please don't expect the impossible". Hi-Fi Journal wrote that [...] "the NAIT excelled in musical terms... and would comfortably drive loudspeakers that caused other amplifiers to sound lumpen and distinctly unmusical". And for that reason, many people who owned the Quad Electrostatic Loudspeaker (ESL) [...] which are known to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> load for amplifiers [...] would choose the NAIT to drive their speakers. Reviewers attribute the perception of power of the NAITs to the over-engineered, dedicated power supplies that ensure generous current delivery for musical transients.|$|E

2500|$|In 2008, 60% of all {{fish caught}} in the EU were caught within British jurisdiction.

There is also monthly rotating aerial surveillance of the entire fishing area under call-sign [...] "Watchdog", with aircraft provided by Direct Flight Aviation. Each aircraft transmits the identity and position of the vessel to squadron ships, which, combined with satellite data from navigational databases which allows the squadron to build a surface picture of fishing activity.|$|E

2500|$|In Southwest Asia, {{adultery}} {{has attracted}} severe sanctions, including death penalty. In some places, such as Saudi Arabia, {{the method of}} punishment for adultery is stoning to death. Proving adultery under Muslim law can <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> task as it requires the accuser to produce four eyewitnesses to the act of sexual intercourse, each of whom should have a good reputation for truthfulness and honesty. The criminal standards do not apply {{in the application of}} social and family consequences of adultery, where the standards of proof are not as exacting. Sandra Mackey, author of The Saudis: Inside the Desert Kingdom, stated in 1987 that in Saudi Arabia, [...] "unlike the tribal rights of a father to put to death a daughter who has violated her chastity, death sentences under Koranic law [...] are extremely rare." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{documentary}} titled Lockerbie Revisited {{aired on}} 27 April 2009, {{in which the}} film's director and narrator, Gideon Levy, interviewed officials involved with the case. Former FBI Laboratory scientist Fred Whitehurst described the FBI laboratory itself as a [...] "crime scene," [...] where an unqualified colleague Thomas Thurman would routinely alter his scientific reports. The interviews also revealed that the timer fragment had never been tested for explosives residue due to [...] "budgetary reasons." [...] Thurman, who led the forensic investigation and identified the fragment's Libyan connection, confirmed {{that it was the}} [...] "only real piece of evidence against Libya". When asked {{about the importance of the}} timer in the conviction of al-Megrahi, FBI Task Force Chief Richard Marquise stated, [...] "It would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> case to prove ... I don't think we would ever (have) had an indictment".|$|E
2500|$|The {{other new}} team was the Modena Team. It {{originally}} began life in late 1990 as GLAS with Mexican investment. Former Arrows, Alfa Romeo and Spirit driver, Mauro Baldi, {{was one of}} [...] the proposed drivers and they had brokered a deal with Lamborghini that would see the Italian marque, operating under Lamborghini Engineering, design and build a chassis for the team as well as supply their V12 engines. But, the Mexican investors pulled out before the season even began. Lamborghini stepped in and provided financial assistance to save the team and relocated the team to Modena, Italy and initiated the subsequent name-change. The team signed up drivers Nicola Larini and Eric van de Poele. Although the team was a de facto factory effort by Lamborghini, Lamborghini entered the team under a separate name to avoid being associated with a struggling team. But this did not stop journalists and fans alike from referring to the team as Lambo though. 1991 would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> year for the team, as aside from the drivers regularly failing to qualify their cars, finances quickly become an issue after Lamborghini's once off investment in the team had dried up. 1991 would in fact {{turn out to be}} the team's only season in the sport.|$|E

2500|$|The ethical and/or moral {{premises}} of healthcare {{are complex and}} intricate. To consolidate such {{a large segment of}} moral philosophy, it becomes important to focus on what separates healthcare ethics from other forms of morality. And on the whole, {{it can be said that}} healthcare itself is a [...] "special" [...] institution within society. With that said, healthcare ought to [...] "be treated differently from other social goods" [...] in a society. It is an institution of which we are all a part whether we like it or not. At some point in every person's life, a decision has to be made regarding one's healthcare. Can they afford it? Do they deserve it? Do they need it? Where should they go to get it? Do they even want it? And it is this last question which poses the biggest dilemma facing a person. After weighing all of the costs and benefits of her healthcare situation, the person has to decide if the costs of healthcare outweigh the benefits. More than basic economic issues are at stake in this conundrum. In fact, a person must decide whether or not their life is ending or if it is worth salvaging. Of course, in instances where the patient is unable to decide due to medical complications, like a coma, then the decision must come from elsewhere. And defining that [...] "elsewhere" [...] has proven to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> endeavor in healthcare philosophy.|$|E
