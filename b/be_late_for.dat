5|$|The Union's V Corps, {{commanded}} by Brig. Gen. Fitz John Porter, took up {{positions on the}} hill on June30. McClellan was not present for the initial exchanges of the battle, having boarded the ironclad USS Galena and sailed down the James River to inspect Harrison's Landing, where he intended to locate the base for his army. Confederate preparations were hindered by several mishaps. Bad maps and faulty guides caused Confederate Maj. Gen. John Magruder to <b>be</b> <b>late</b> <b>for</b> the battle, an excess of caution delayed Maj. Gen. Benjamin Huger, and Maj. Gen. Stonewall Jackson had problems collecting the Confederate artillery.|$|E
5|$|When Devon Banks, the Vice President of West Coast News, Web Content, and Theme Park Talent Relations {{visits from}} Los Angeles, Jack fears {{that he is}} trying to take his job. After having his {{assistant}} Jonathan spy on Banks, he learns that Banks is gay and that he is interested in Kenneth. Jack sends Kenneth to try to gather information on what Banks is planning to do, but Kenneth is inept and fails at the task. Jack then enlists Liz to help him come up with some ideas so that he can impress the network and win the power coup over Banks. Jack sends Kenneth to seduce Banks again so that he will <b>be</b> <b>late</b> <b>for</b> the important meeting, but Banks sees through the plan and arrives at the meeting anyway.|$|E
5|$|Despite her predicament, Sánchez {{remained}} relatively positive: she sang to Germán Santa María Barragán, {{a journalist who}} {{was working as a}} volunteer, asked for sweet food, drank soda, and agreed to be interviewed. At times, she was scared, and prayed or cried. On the third night, Sánchez began hallucinating, saying that {{she did not want to}} <b>be</b> <b>late</b> <b>for</b> school, and mentioned a maths exam. Near the end of her life, Sánchez's eyes reddened, her face swelled, and her hands whitened. At one point she asked the people to leave her so they could rest. Hours later the workers returned with a pump and tried to save her, but her legs were bent under the concrete as if she was kneeling, and it was impossible to free her without severing her legs. Lacking the surgical equipment to save her from the effects of an amputation, the doctors present agreed that it would be more humane to let her die. In all, Sánchez suffered for nearly three nights (roughly 60 hours) before she died at approximately 10:05 A.M. on November 16 from exposure, most likely from gangrene or hypothermia.|$|E

25|$|The group put {{themselves}} through challenges that {{forced them to}} find the physical and mental strength to succeed. Examples included training without food or water, or sleeping on the floor without a blanket, to learn to endure the cold. For example, {{no one in the}} group was permitted to <b>be</b> <b>late</b> <b>for</b> training, as it would hold back the whole group. If any member completed a challenge, everyone else had to do the same thing. During their training no one was allowed to complain or be negative. Few excuses were allowed. For instance, if someone claimed that his shoes were too worn out {{in order to make a}} jump, he had to do it anyway, even if it meant doing the jump barefoot. At the same time, everyone was required to have knowledge of their own limits.|$|E
500|$|The Sum of Things was {{published}} posthumously, for on 4July 1980 Manning suffered a severe stroke while visiting {{friends in the}} Isle of Wight. She died in hospital on 23July; somewhat typically, Reggie, having been recalled from Ireland, was not present when she died. He {{could not bear to}} see her [...] "fade away" [...] and had gone to London to keep himself busy. Manning had long predicted that the frequently tardy Reggie would <b>be</b> <b>late</b> <b>for</b> her funeral, and he almost was. In addition, his mourning period, characterised by abrupt transitions from weeping to almost hysterical mirth, was precisely how Manning had imagined Guy Pringle's reaction to Harriet's supposed death in The Sum of Things. Manning was cremated and her ashes buried at Billingham Manor on the Isle of Wight.|$|E

500|$|The {{final version}} of the episode {{differed}} from the original concept. It was initially intended for Dean to be a [...] "huge loser" [...] in his new life; being a hunter is what gives him structure and purpose. Without hunting, he would be a jobless barfly. Kripke compared the new reality to a Charles Bukowski novel, but noted that the selfless Dean still preferred the new universe, with Sam happy and living a good life. However, executive producer Robert Singer and others convinced him to change this, because they did not think Dean would be happy suddenly waking up in such a reality. Another variation stemmed from Dean's lack of someone to confide innormally Sam is his confidant. Because the writers found it difficult to communicate Dean's feelings, early drafts of the script included a number of internal monologues. These were ultimately replaced by a scene in which he discusses the djinn with a professor. The studio wanted the scene of Dean and his girlfriend Carmen kissing on the sofa to include sex. However, Kripke could not work it into the script, because he found it unrealistic that she would deliberately <b>be</b> <b>late</b> <b>for</b> her job as a hospital nurse.|$|E
2500|$|At about 3:30p.m. EDT on Saturday, June 23, fellow wrestler {{and close}} friend Chavo Guerrero {{received}} a voicemail message from Benoit's phone stating {{that he had}} overslept and missed his flight and would <b>be</b> <b>late</b> <b>for</b> that night's house show in Beaumont, Texas. Guerrero called Benoit back and found that Benoit sounded tired and groggy as he confirmed everything that he had said in his voice message. Guerrero, who was [...] "concerned about Benoit's tone and demeanor," [...] called him back 12 minutes later. Benoit did not answer the call, and Guerrero left a message asking Benoit to call back.|$|E
2500|$|On October 5, 2017 Insane Clown Posse held a [...] "Surprize Guerrilla Show" [...] {{featuring}} Anybody Killa, DJ Clay, Big Hoodoo, and Lyte for $5. It {{was said}} that a music video would be shot the same night as well. The video featured the whole label including the new artist Ouija Macc of the group Swag Toof. The video was to include Anybody Killa, but didn't because his van broke down causing him to <b>be</b> <b>late</b> <b>for</b> the video. He showed up in time to perform his set, but Violent J told him that beings though he missed the video shoot he wasn't going to perform. The video was released on October 30, 2017. The song features Lyte, Violent J, Big Hoodoo, Shaggy 2 Dope & Ouija Macc plus the video features DJ Clay as the DJ, and Legz Diamond as the ring announcer. The song was produced, engineered, mixed and mastered by Strange Music's in-house producer Seven, and recorded at The Lotus Pod and Dustys Boom Room in Detroit, Michigan.|$|E

2500|$|The old {{man came}} back after walking a {{distance}} and praised Zhang Liang, [...] "This child can be taught!" [...] and asked Zhang Liang {{to meet him at}} the bridge again at dawn five days later. Zhang Liang was confused but agreed. Five days later, Zhang Liang rushed to the bridge at the stroke of dawn but the old man was already waiting for him there. The old man chided him, [...] "How can you <b>be</b> <b>late</b> <b>for</b> a meeting with an elderly man? Come back again five days later!" [...] Zhang Liang tried his best to be punctual the second time but the old man still arrived earlier than him, and he was scorned by the old man once more and told to return again five days later. The third time, Zhang Liang went to the bridge at midnight and waited until the old man appeared. This time, the old man was impressed with Zhang Liang's fortitude and humility, that he presented Zhang with a book, saying, [...] "You can become the tutor of a ruler after reading this book. Within ten years, the world will become chaotic. You can then use your knowledge from this book to bring peace and prosperity to the empire. Meet me again 13 years later.
