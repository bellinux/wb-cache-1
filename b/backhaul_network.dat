40|$|Abstract — Wireless multi-hop, mesh {{networks}} are being {{considered as a}} candidate to backhaul data traffic from access networks to the wired Internet. These mesh {{networks are}} referred to as wireless <b>backhaul</b> <b>networks.</b> Existing medium access control (MAC) protocols and scheduling algorithms are devised for wireless access. So although they have been adopted for the wireless <b>backhaul</b> <b>networks,</b> they do not yield good performance. In this paper, we propose a novel distributed scheduling algorithm, composed of a framework and a new utility function definition, for wireless <b>backhaul</b> <b>networks.</b> We show by analysis and simulation that the algorithm converges to the desired throughput allocation in a long run, which can be specified by the routing protocol in use to guarantee quality of service. Moreover, in terms of interference, we show that our framework maintains strong temporal correlation of interference, which is required to ensure proper channel predictions for scheduling gain and for distributed power control. Finally, simulation results reveal that the new algorithm takes advantage of the multi-user diversity in achieving high overall network throughput, when compared with the tree-structure algorithm.

40|$|The {{deployment}} of mobile femtocellular networks {{can enhance the}} service quality for the users inside the vehicles. The {{deployment of}} mobile femtocells generates a lot of handover calls. Also, numbers of group handover scenarios are found in mobile femtocellular network deployment. The ability to seamlessly switch between the femtocells and the macrocell networks is a key concern for femtocell network deployment. However, until {{now there is no}} effective and complete handover scheme for the mobile femtocell network deployment. Also handover between the <b>backhaul</b> <b>networks</b> is a major concern for the mobile femtocellular network deployment. In this paper, we propose handover control between the access networks for the individual handover cases. Call flows for the handover between the <b>backhaul</b> <b>networks</b> of the macrocell-to-macrocell case are proposed in this paper. We also propose the link switching for the FSO based <b>backhaul</b> <b>networks.</b> The proposed resource allocation scheme ensures the negligible handover call dropping probability as well as higher bandwidth utilization.

40|$|Abstract—The high {{frequency}} segment (10 - 66 GHz) of the IEEE 802. 16 standard seems promising {{for the implementation}} of wireless <b>backhaul</b> <b>networks</b> carrying large volumes of Internet traffic. In contrast to wireline backbone networks, where channel errors seldom occur, routing decisions in IEEE 802. 16 networks are conditioned by wireless channel impairments rather than by congestion, exclusively. This renders a cross-layer routing approach between the routing and the physical layers more appropriate during fading periods. In this paper, an adaptive cross-layer routing scheme is presented based on the selection of the most reliable path in terms of packet error ratio (unipath routing). The paper argues that routing Internet traffic through wireless <b>backhaul</b> <b>networks</b> is modeled more realistically employing evolutionary rather than conventional game theory. The stability of the proposed routing algorithm is proven and the dependence of the speed of convergence on various physical layer parameters is investigated. Is is also shown that convergence may be further accelerated by increasing the amount of information from the physical layer, specifically the physical separation between the alternative paths provided to the routing layer.

CoMP techniques can effectively turn otherwise harmful inter-cell interference into useful signals, enabling significant power gain, channel rank advantage, and/or diversity gains to be exploited. CoMP requires a high-speed <b>backhaul</b> <b>network</b> for enabling the exchange of information (e.g., data, control information, and CSI) between the BSs.

Wayside Communications Managers (WCM) (or packet switches) link all the BCMs in the region to a <b>backhaul</b> <b>network</b> which allows them to communicate with the dispatcher's office and associated control systems via TCP/IP.

40|$|This thesis studies {{end-to-end}} {{performance and}} fairness in {{two classes of}} <b>backhaul</b> <b>networks,</b> namely multihop wireless <b>backhaul</b> <b>networks</b> and metropolitan backbone networks. Current media access and transport protocols in both wired and wireless <b>backhaul</b> <b>networks</b> can result in severe inefficiency and poor performance. In particular, flows that are {{an increasing number of}} hops away from a wired entry point or Internet backbone experience extreme unfairness and in some cases even starvation. The contributions of this thesis are as follows. First, we develop a formal reference model that characterizes performance objectives of multihop wireless <b>backhaul</b> <b>networks</b> and perform an extensive set of simulation experiments to quantify the impact of the key performance factors towards achieving these goals. For example, we study the roles of the MAC protocol; end-to-end congestion control, antenna technology, and traffic types. Next, we develop and study a distributed layer 2 fairness algorithm which targets to achieve the fairness of the reference model without modification to TCP. We also study the critical relationship between fairness and aggregate throughput. Next, we study the performance of utility maximization congestion control algorithm over multihop CSMA-based networks. We develop a framework to study key issues in such networks that are not incorporated by prior models, yet are critical to the performance of congestion control algorithms. Our study provides {{a deeper understanding of the}} impact of CSMA-based MAC on the performance of utility maximization congestion control algorithm. Finally, we introduce a new dynamic bandwidth allocation algorithm for metropolitan backbone networks called Distributed Virtual-time Scheduling in Rings (DVSR). To evaluate DVSR, we develop an idealized fairness reference model. With simulations, we find that compared to current techniques, DVSR's convergence times are an order of magnitude faster (e. g., 2 vs. 50 msec), oscillations are mitigated (e. g., ranges of 0. 1 % vs. up to 100 %), and nearly complete spatial reuse is achieved (e. g., 0. 1 % throughput loss vs. 33 %) ...|$|R

Medium access control (MAC) techniques are essential to allow appropriate multiplexing and traffic management [6]. As a drawback, resource sharing may limit the backhaul capacity, introduce latency and act as a bottleneck when neighbouring small cell BSs sharing the same PoP, are fully loaded and carry high throughputs. In [12], a NLOS PtMP solution supporting six to eight small cells (co-located with remotes) is estimated to provide 250 Mbps throughput and reduce the backhaul TCO by almost 60 % over the course of 10 years in dense urban environments.|$|R
