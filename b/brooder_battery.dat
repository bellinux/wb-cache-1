40|$|ABSTRACT Four {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} de-termine {{the interactive effects of}} Gly, TSAA, and Lys in corn-soybean meal diets on growth performance of broilers. All {{experiments were}} conducted with female Ross × Ross 308 or 708 broilers in <b>brooder</b> <b>batteries</b> from 0 to 18 d posthatching. Treatments had 5 to 8 replications with 5 or 6 broilers per replicate pen. Diets in all experiments were fed without or with Gly (2. 32 % total Gly + Ser). All diets contained 0. 25 % l-Lys·HCl except in experiment 1, where no crystalline Lys was added. In experiment 1, the total dietary Lys level was 1. 26 % with TSAA:Lys of 0. 72 and 0. 76. Increasing TSAA:Lys increased (P < 0. 07) G:F. The main effect of Gly was not significant for ADG, ADFI, or G:F; however, G:F was increased by Gly in broilers fed 0. 72 but not in those fed 0. 76 TSAA:Lys (Gly × TSAA:Lys, P < 0. 03). In experiment 2, the total dietary Lys level was 1. 26 % with TSAA:Lys of 0. 51, 0. 68, 0. 72, and 0. 76. Glycine addition did not affect ADG, ADFI, or G:F; however, increasing TSAA:Lys linearly increased (P < 0. 01) ADG, ADFI, and G:F and the response was quadratic for ADG and G:F. Experiment 3 was similar to experiment 2 except the total dietary Lys level was 1. 35 %. Glycine addition increased (P < 0. 03) G:F and decreased (P < 0. 04) serum uric acid (SUA) and se-rum urea N concentrations. Also, increasing TSAA:Lys linearly and quadratically (P < 0. 02) increased ADG, ADFI, and G:F. In experiment 4, broilers were fed 2 levels of total dietary Lys (1. 26 and 1. 35 %), 3 levels of TSAA:Lys (0. 72, 0. 76, and 0. 80), and without or with Gly supplementation up to a total of 2. 32 % Gly + Ser.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{effect of}} chronic heat {{exposure}} on feed digestibility of broilers was investigated. Eighty 4 -wk-old male chickens were <b>brooded</b> in individual <b>battery</b> cages in two controlled-environment rooms {{at a constant}} ambient temperature (22 or 32 C) until 6 wk of age.

40|$|THE {{apparent}} {{beneficial effects}} of built-up litter in keeping down losses from cecal coccidiosis {{are not well}} under-stood. It can be theorized that early exposure to coccidial oocysts induces an immunity which is perpetuated by oc-casional ingestion of a few sporulated oocysts from the droppings in the litter. This paper deals with {{an investigation of the}} development of immunity in chicks to cecal coccidiosis when specific numbers of sporulated oocysts were administered to chicks at various ages <b>brooded</b> in chick <b>batteries</b> with wire floors.

In the metabolism trial, 288 male chicks from 4 to 7 days were allotted to a completely randomized design with six treatments (a reference diet and five diets with inclusion of the test ingredients) and four replicates of 12 birds. The ingredients evaluated were: isolated soy protein (IS), dried whole eggs (OP), blood plasma (PS), corn gluten meal (GM) and dried sugar cane yeast (LS). To evaluate the performance and TGI, 624 birds were allocated in <b>brooder</b> <b>batteries</b> with six treatments and four replicates of 26 birds.

The calculated median lethal dose was 4. 9 mg PFOS/g egg. Perfluorooctane sulfonate did not affect posthatch body or organ weights. Exposure to PFOS caused pathological changes in the liver characterized by bile duct hyperplasia, periportal inflammation, and hepatic cell necrosis at doses as low as 1. 0 mg PFOS/g egg.

40|$|ABSTRACT Frequently, {{publications}} {{pertaining to}} waterfowl state that medicated feeds {{should not be}} fed to ducklings and goslings. In some localities, producers and hobbyists who raise {{a small number of}} ducklings and goslings can purchase only medicated chick, turkey, or gamebird starter and grower feeds. Because of the lack of documented information on this subject and the numer-ous requests for advice on this matter, anticoccidial drugs, zoalene, sulfaquinoxaline, and ampro-lium, were mixed in mash feed and fed to Khaki Campbell male ducklings to 4 weeks of age. No significant differences in mean body weight, mortality, and anatomical development were observed among the treatments. Medicated commercial crumble turkey and chick starter feeds produced significantly better feed conversion than the mash medicated or nonmedicated feeds. These differences can be attributed to greater feed spillage with the mash feed. Some ducklings in all treatments showed unsteadiness of gait and shaky legs. These conditions disappeared when the ducklings were moved from the <b>battery</b> <b>brooder</b> to an outside pen.

40|$|Newly hatched chicks may {{experience}} {{long periods of}} fasting prior to placement in commercial hatcheries. Three trials were conducted to investigate the effects of early feed restriction and various supplements on the performance and gut health of broiler chicks <b>brooded</b> either in <b>battery</b> cages or floor pens. The trials lasted for 14, 21, and, 22 days respectively. In trial 1, chicks were subjected to 3 periods of fasting after hatch (36, 24, or 12 h). A short period of fasting (12 h) {{was associated with a}} lower feed:gain ratio compared to the longer periods (36 and 24 h). In trial 2, chicks were fed 4 dietary treatments (corn-SBM, corn-SBM + Tylan®, corn-SBM + Bio-Mos®, or corn-SBM + NuPro®), subjected to 2 feeding programs (fed immediately or 12 h delay post-hatch), and brooded in 2 housing systems (cages or floor pens), in a split-plot experiment. Early feeding led to increased feed intake and body weight of chicks. Brooding chicks in cages resulted in an improved body weight, increased feed intake, and increased feed:gain ratio. Dietary treatments had no effects on broiler performance at all time periods measured. In trial 3, chicks were fasted for 24 h, placed immediately, fed a hatching supplement for 48 h, or fed a hatching supplement for 24 h post-hatch. Chicks placed immediately had markedly improved body weight. Feeding the hatching supplement numerically improved body weight {{at the end of the}} trial compared to early fasting. In summary, early feeding is an important factor affecting subsequent performance of chicks. Lactobacillus and Salmonella, as an index of gut health, were not influenced by early feed restriction.

Six replicates of eight pullets per replicate were used per treatment in each experiment. Feed and water were provided for ad libitum access. The pullets were housed in <b>battery</b> <b>brooder</b> pens with raised wire floors. Body weight, body weight gain, average feed consumption per day, total feed consumption, and feed conversion were determined at 3 and 6 wk of age (WOA). The birds were observed for any signs of pantothenic acid deficiency. At the end of a 6 -wk experimental period, the pullets previously receiving the diets containing either 0 or 3. 6 mg supplemental pantothenic acid/kg of diet were raised to sexual maturity and their age at sexual maturity, body weight at 24 WOA, and average number of eggs per pullet through 32 WOA were measured in both of the experiments.

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} evaluate the use of a single diet containing 18 % crude protein (CP) and 3000 kcal/kgME as an alternative feeding regimen to 3 other conventional feeding standards for broiler production. Three hundred and twenty (320) Anak broilers were randomly divided into four treatment groups. The first three groups served as control while the 4 th was the tested treatment. Broilers in group 1 (G 1) representing control 1 were fed diet with 23 % CP 0 - 3 weeks, 20 % CP 3 - 6 weeks and 16 % CP 6 - 8 weeks. While those in group 2 (G 2) representing control 2 were fed diet with 23 % CP 0 - 6 weeks and 14 % CP 6 - 8 weeks. Also broilers in group 3 (G 3) representing control 3 were fed diet with 20 % CP 0 - 4 weeks and 16 % CP 4 - 8 weeks, while those in group 4 were fed 18 % CP 0 - 8 weeks. All diets contained 3000 kcal/kg of metabolizable energy. The birds were kept in <b>battery</b> <b>brooder</b> cage for 8 weeks. Feed and water were supplied ad libitum. At the 8 th week, 10 birds were randomly selected from each of the four treatment groups and starved for 18 hours. They were killed by cervical dislocation and used to determine the carcass parameters. Performance results at 8 weeks showed that broilers fed on 18 % CP and 3000 kcal/kg ME had the lowest feed intake (P 0. 05) and better feed to gain ratio than the third control group (p 0. 05). Dietary crude protein CP 18 % and 3000 kcal/kgME for broilers resulted in better carcass weight, breast meat yield and gizzard weight when compared with the controls (P< 0. 05). It also reduced abdominal fat content (p< 0. 05). Economically, feeding broiler on diet of 18 % CP and 3000 kcal/kg of energy for 0 - 8 weeks also recorded a significantly reduced cost benefit ratio a factor that determines how best the production cost is utilized (P< 0. 05). It was then concluded that using dietary CP 18 % and 3000 kcal/kgME for feeding broilers from 0 - 8 weeks, could be an alternative to the conventional feeding methods currently used for broilers where they are fed 2 or 3 different diets in a space of 0 - 8 weeks where they are expected to be marketed. It was also noted that such feeding method would be suitable for poultry farmers who practice on-farm feed production...|$|R
