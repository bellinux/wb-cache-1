40|$|International audienceSeveral {{studies suggest}} that normal ageing could affect the driving behavior, {{particularly}} when negotiating intersections. The {{purpose of the current}} naturalistic study was to document the behavior of drivers aged 65 and over at stop‐controlled intersections and describe the way they deal with speed limits. Twenty participants were recruited for a 7 ‐day experiment (5 men and 5 women from an urban and a semi‐urban area). Displacements of the vehicle and images of the driver and scenery were recorded. The analysis of the stop‐controlled intersections (986) showed that older drivers seldom stop completely at intersections. Overall, men showed a minimal speed that exceeded 4. 99  km/h for more than 60 % of the intersections (38 % for the women). The braking strategies did not vary {{as a function of the}} area of residence (p > . 05). A total of 1   561 speeding events were identified. Overall, speeding was more frequent on roads where the speed is limited to 50  km/h (907 events) (p   0, 05). Un total de 1   561 excès <b>de</b> <b>vitesse</b> a été identifié. Un plus grand nombre <b>de</b> dépassements <b>de</b> <b>vitesse</b> a été observé dans des zones <b>de</b> limitation <b>de</b> <b>vitesse</b> à 50  km/h (907 événements) (p <  0, 05). Parmi ces excès <b>de</b> <b>vitesse,</b> elles montrent <b>des</b> stratégies de conduite adoptées par le conducteur âgé en situations naturelles...|$|R
5|$|As in the {{previous}} years, there were two classes of cyclists, the coureurs <b>de</b> <b>vitesse</b> and the coureurs sur machines poinçonnées. Of the 93 cyclists starting the race, 82 were in the poinçonnée category, which meant {{that they had to}} finish the race on the same bicycle as they left, and if it was broken they had to fix it without assistance. The coureurs <b>de</b> <b>vitesse</b> could get help from the car with bicycle repairmen when they had to fix a bicycle, and when a bicycle was beyond repair, they could change it to a new one.|$|R
