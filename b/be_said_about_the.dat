Presumably, lying to his army was King Milan's only means to mobilise and command his troops without experiencing disobedience and unrest.|$|E

25|$|This {{definition}} {{applies to}} a Banach space, {{but of course}} other types of space exist as well, for example, topological vector spaces include Banach spaces, but can be more general. On the other hand, Banach spaces include Hilbert spaces, and it is these spaces that find the greatest application and the richest theoretical results. With suitable restrictions, much can <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> structure of the spectra of transformations in a Hilbert space. In particular, for self-adjoint operators, the spectrum lies on the real line and (in general) is a spectral combination of a point spectrum of discrete eigenvalues and a continuous spectrum.|$|E
25|$|Gender inequality, however, is not {{increasing}} or decreasing in a collinear fashion among these predominantly Muslim states. In Afghanistan, for example, gender inequality, {{as measured by}} the index, improved by 2% from 2005 to 2008 but then declined by 2% from 2008 to 2011. In Iraq, the GII score jumped by 9% from 2005 to 2008 but then leveled off in 2011. Turkey, Indonesia, Tunisia, and Pakistan have seen consistent improves to gender equality since 2005. Due to the broad, general nature of the indicators, the minimal and narrow data used to compile the three categories which compose the indicator, and innumerable political and socio-economic issues which may increase or decrease gender inequality, nothing definitive can <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> level of gender inequality or its growth trend in many predominantly Muslim nations.|$|E
25|$|Besides {{actively}} {{participating in}} the current discussions on evolutionary theory and genetics, Mosterín has also tackled issues like the definition of life itself or the ontology of biological organisms and species. Following in Aristotle’s and Schrödinger’s footsteps, he has been asking the simple question: what is life? He has analyzed the main proposed definitions, based on metabolism, reproduction, thermodynamics, complexity and evolution, and found all of them wanting. It is true that all organisms on Earth share many characteristics, from the encoding of genetic information in DNA to the storage of energy in ATP, but these common features merely reflect the inheritance from a common ancestor that possibly acquired them in a random way. From that point of view, our biology is the parochial science of life on Earth, rather than a universal science of life in general. Such a general biology seems impossible, {{as long as we}} do not detect and come to know other forms of life in the galaxy (if they exist). Concerning the ontological thesis of Michael Ghiselin and David Hull on the individuality of biological species, Mosterín shows that they are neither classes nor individuals in the usual meaning of these words. He tries to extend and make more precise the available conceptual framework of the discussion. Specifically, he shows the formal equivalence of the set-theoretical and the mereological (or part and individual) approach, so that everything that can <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> classes can be translated into the jargon of individuals, and the other way around. All these concerns converge in his recent philosophy of animality, which combines the ontology of animals as paradigmatic individuals with the insights and results of biological research. This general theory of animals provides a solid foundation for the development of anthropology, conceived as the science of human primates.|$|E

500|$|For {{the roles}} of Jane, Ricky, and Angela, DreamWorks gave Mendes carte blanche. By November 1998, Thora Birch, Wes Bentley, and Mena Suvari had been cast in the parts—in Birch's case, despite the fact she was underage for her nude scene. As Birch was 16 {{at the time she}} made the film, and thus {{classified}} as a minor in the United States, her parents had to approve her brief topless scene in the movie. Child labor representatives were on the set for the shooting of the scene. Bentley overcame competition from top actors under the age of 25 to be cast. The 2009 documentary My Big Break followed Bentley, and several other young actors, before and after he landed the part. To prepare, Mendes provided Bentley with a video camera, telling the actor to film what Ricky would. Peter Gallagher and Alison Janney were cast (as Buddy Kane and Barbara Fitts) after filming began in December 1998. Mendes gave Janney a book of paintings by Edvard Munch. He told her, [...] "Your character is in there somewhere." [...] Mendes cut much of Barbara's dialogue, including conversations between Colonel Fitts and her, as he felt that what needed to <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> pair—their humanity and vulnerability—was conveyed successfully through their shared moments of silence. Chris Cooper plays Colonel Fitts, Scott Bakula plays Jim Olmeyer, and Sam Robards plays Jim Berkley. Jim and Jim were deliberately depicted as the most normal, happy—and boring—couple in the film. Ball's inspiration for the characters came from a thought he had after seeing a [...] "bland, boring, heterosexual couple" [...] who wore matching clothes: [...] "I can't wait for the time when a gay couple can be just as boring." [...] Ball also included aspects of a gay couple he knew who had the same forename.|$|E
500|$|All {{acknowledged}} subject {{experts and}} authorities {{agree that there}} is no evidence of cricket having evolved from another bat-and-ball sport and, equally, no evidence that any other bat-and-ball sport evolved from cricket. The authorities include writers Harry Altham, John Arlott, Derek Birley, Arthur Haygarth, David Underdown, Roy Webber and Peter Wynne-Thomas. Their consensus view is that the only thing that can definitely <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> origin of cricket is that its earliest record is in a late 16th-century court case in Surrey which proves it was played by children in southeast England in the middle of that century. There have been alternative theories of origin but these have been dismissed or ignored by authorities. For example, the writer Andrew Lang claimed in 1912 that cricket evolved from a bat-and-ball game which may have been played in Dál Riata as early as the 6th century and this claim has been dismissed, by Anthony Bateman among others, in terms of [...] "Lang's idiosyncratic belief in the Celtic origin of cricket". It is true that cricket is one of many bat-and-ball sports existing worldwide which have no known origin. Others are the definitely Celtic sports of hurling and shinty. Golf and hockey are other British ball games involving a club or stick while croquet was apparently imported from France and globally there are games such as Sweden's brännboll, Italy's , India's gilli-danda, Finland's pesäpallo and Samoa's kilikiti. However, it is generally believed that cricket essentially belongs to the same family of bat-and-ball games as stoolball, rounders and baseball but whether it evolved from any of these, or vice versa, cannot be determined. There is a 1523 reference to stoolball at a designated field in Oxfordshire; this may then have been a generic term for any game in which a ball is somehow hit with a bat or stick. 18th century references to stoolball in conjunction with cricket clearly indicate that it was a separate activity.|$|E

2500|$|In {{probability}} and statistics, a Bernoulli {{process is}} a finite or infinite sequence of binary random variables, {{so it is a}} discrete-time stochastic process that takes only two values, canonically 0 and1.

[...] Prosaically, a Bernoulli {{process is a}} repeated coin flipping, possibly with an unfair coin (but with consistent unfairness). [...] Every variable X'i in the sequence is associated with a Bernoulli trial or experiment. They all have the same Bernoulli distribution. Much of what can <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Bernoulli process can also be generalized to more than two outcomes (such as the process for a six-sided die); this generalization is known as the Bernoulli scheme.|$|E
2500|$|Austen's {{depiction}} of sexuality is muted and indirect. While her depictions of Elizabeth and Darcy in Pride and Prejudice include descriptions {{of their physical}} reactions to each other, which was unusual at the time, the climactic moments of this and her other novels are presented from a distance. Moreover, Austen does not turn her irony on sexual experiences. She often refers to the sexual attraction between characters in oblique terms. For example, she writes that Elinor considers the [...] "unaccountable bias in favor of beauty", which caused an intelligent man to choose a silly wife. This [...] "unaccountable bias" [...] represents sexual power, the physical attraction of one body to another, [...] "everything that cannot <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> relations between men and women".|$|E
