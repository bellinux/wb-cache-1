5|$|Subarachnoid {{hemorrhage}} (SAH) is bleeding {{into the}} subarachnoid space â€” {{the area between}} the arachnoid membrane and the pia mater surrounding the brain. Symptoms may include a severe headache of rapid onset, vomiting, decreased level of consciousness, fever, and sometimes seizures. Neck stiffness or neck pain are also relatively common. In {{about a quarter of}} people a small <b>bleed</b> with resolving symptoms occurs within a month of a larger <b>bleed.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{worldwide}} tour dubbed The Unholy Alliance Tour, {{was undertaken}} {{to support the}} new record. The tour was originally set to launch on June 6, but was postponed to June 10, as Araya had to undergo gall bladder surgery. In Flames, Mastodon, Children of Bodom, Lamb of God, and Thine Eyes <b>Bleed</b> (featuring Araya's brother, Johnny) and Ted Maul (London Hammersmith Apollo) were supporting Slayer. The tour made its way through America and Europe and the bands who participated, apart from Thine Eyes <b>Bleed,</b> reunited to perform at Japan's Loudpark Festival on October 15, 2006.|$|E
30|$|Postsurgical <b>bleeding</b> was {{determined}} {{in both groups}} according to the WHO <b>bleeding</b> criteria: (grade 0) no <b>bleeding,</b> (grade 1) <b>bleeding</b> under the skin and petechial class, (grade 2) mild <b>bleeding,</b> (grade 3) gross <b>bleeding,</b> and (grade 4) mortal <b>bleeding</b> or annoying <b>bleeding</b> [33].|$|R
50|$|Most unusual <b>bleeding</b> or {{irregular}} <b>bleeding</b> (metrorrhagia) in premenopausal {{women is}} caused by changes in the hormonal balance of the body. These changes are not pathological. Exceptionally heavy <b>bleeding</b> during menstruation is termed menorrhagia or hypermenorrhea, while light <b>bleeding</b> is called hypomenorrhea. Women on hormonal contraceptives can experience breakthrough <b>bleeding</b> and/or withdrawal <b>bleeding.</b> Withdrawal <b>bleeding</b> occurs when a hormonal contraceptive or other hormonal intake is discontinued.|$|R
25|$|Gastrointestinal <b>bleeding</b> can {{be roughly}} {{divided into two}} {{clinical}} syndromes: upper gastrointestinal <b>bleeding</b> and lower gastrointestinal <b>bleeding.</b> About 2/3 of all GI <b>bleeds</b> are from upper sources and 1/3 from lower sources. Common causes of gastrointestinal <b>bleeding</b> include infections, cancers, vascular disorders, adverse effects of medications, and blood clotting disorders. Obscure gastrointestinal <b>bleeding</b> (OGIB) is when a source is unclear following investigation.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to the album's singles, two EPs were released to support <b>Bleed</b> American. The first of these EPs, titled Good to Go EP, was released on February 22, 2002 in Japan-only. The second EP, titled The Middle/A Praise Chorus Tour EP, was a tour EP released in Australia in January 2003. On April 28, 2008, a deluxe edition of the album was released with a bonus disc containing several B-sides, acoustic versions, live versions, demo versions and previously unreleased tracks. The original album and track title <b>Bleed</b> American were restored for this release.|$|E
5|$|About 20% are {{affected}} by symptomatic digestive tract lesions, although a higher percentage have lesions that do not cause symptoms. These lesions may <b>bleed</b> intermittently, which is rarely significant enough to be noticed (in the form of bloody vomiting or black stool), but can eventually lead to depletion of iron in the body, resulting in iron-deficiency anemia.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{supplying}} {{air to the}} engine, {{the intake}} also supplied air through the ramp <b>bleed</b> to the propelling nozzle.

40|$|Although {{techniques}} and instruments for endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) have improved, <b>bleeding</b> {{is still the}} most common complication. Minimizing the occurrence of <b>bleeding</b> is important because blood can interfere with subsequent procedures. Generally, ESD-related <b>bleeding</b> can be divided into intraprocedural and postprocedural bleedings. Postprocedural <b>bleeding</b> can be further classi-fied into early post-ESD <b>bleeding</b> which occurs within 48 hours after ESD and late post-ESD <b>bleeding</b> which occurs later than 48 hours after ESD. A basic principle for avoiding intraprocedural <b>bleeding</b> is to watch for vessels and coagulate them before cutting. Several countertraction devices have been designed to minimize intraprocedural <b>bleeding.</b> Methods for reducing postprocedural <b>bleeding</b> in-clude administration of proton-pump inhibitors or prophylactic coagulation after ESD. Medical adhesive spray such as n-butyl- 2 -cyano-acrylate is also an option for preventing postprocedural <b>bleeding.</b> Various endoscopic treatment modalities are used for both intraproce-dural and postprocedural <b>bleeding.</b> However, hemoclipping is infrequently used during ESD because the clips interfere with subsequent resection. <b>Bleeding</b> that occurs as a result of ESD can usually be managed easily. Nonetheless, more effective ways to prevent <b>bleeding,</b> including reliable ESD techniques, must be developed...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{the clear}} net {{clinical}} benefit of oral anticoagulation (OAC) in atrial fibrillation (AF) patients {{at risk for}} stroke, major <b>bleeding</b> events (especially intra-cranial <b>bleeds)</b> may be devastating events when they do occur. The decision for OAC is often based on a careful assessment of both stroke risk and <b>bleeding</b> risk, but clinical scores for <b>bleeding</b> risk estimation are much less well validated than stroke risk scales. Also, the estimation of <b>bleeding</b> risk is rendered difficult {{since many of the}} known factors that increase <b>bleeding</b> risk overlap with stroke risk factors. As well as this, many factors that increase <b>bleeding</b> risk are transient, such as variable international normalized ratio values, operations, vascular procedures, or drug-drug and food-drug interactions. In this Position Document, we comprehensively review the published evidence and propose a consensus on <b>bleeding</b> risk assessments in AF patients, with a view to summarizing 'best practice' when approaching antithrombotic therapy in AF patients. We address the epidemiology and size of the problem of <b>bleeding</b> risk in AF and review established <b>bleeding</b> risk factors. We also summarize definitions of <b>bleeding</b> in the published literature. Patient values and preferences balancing the risk of <b>bleeding</b> against thrombo-embolism is reviewed, and the prognostic implications of <b>bleeding</b> are discussed. We also review <b>bleeding</b> risk stratification and currently published <b>bleeding</b> risk schema. A brief discussion of special situations [e. g. peri-ablation, peri-devices (implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, pacemakers) and presentation with acute coronary syndromes and/or requiring percutaneous coronary interventions/stents and bridging therapy], as well as a discussion of prevention of <b>bleeds</b> and managing <b>bleeding</b> complications, is made. Finally, this document also puts forwards consensus statements that may help to define evidence gaps and assist in everyday clinical practice. <b>Bleeding</b> risk is almost inevitably lower than stroke risk in patients with atrial fibrillation. Nonetheless, identification of patients at high risk of <b>bleeding</b> and delineation of conditions and situations associated with <b>bleeding</b> risk can help to refine antithrombotic therapy to minimize <b>bleeding</b> ris...|$|R

50|$|Lower {{gastrointestinal}} <b>bleeding,</b> commonly abbreviated LGIB, is {{any form}} of gastrointestinal <b>bleeding</b> in the lower gastrointestinal tract. LGIB is a common reason for seeking medical attention at a hospital's emergency department. LGIB accounts for 30-40% of all gastrointestinal <b>bleeding</b> and is less common than upper gastrointestinal <b>bleeding</b> (UGIB). It is estimated that UGIB accounts for 100-200 per 100,000 cases versus 20-27 per 100,000 cases for LGIB. Approximately 85% of lower gastrointestinal <b>bleeding</b> involves the colon, 10% are from <b>bleeds</b> that are actually upper gastrointestinal <b>bleeds,</b> and 3-5% involve the small intestines.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: We {{describe}} the incidence, location {{and management of}} non-major <b>bleeding,</b> and assess the association between non-major <b>bleeding</b> and clinical outcomes in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) receiving anticoagulation therapy enrolled in Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation (ARISTOTLE). METHODS: We included patients who received >/= 1 dose of study drug (n= 18 140). Non-major <b>bleeding</b> {{was defined as the}} first <b>bleeding</b> event considered to be clinically relevant non-major (CRNM) or minor <b>bleeding,</b> and not preceded by a major <b>bleeding</b> event. RESULTS: Non-major <b>bleeding</b> was three times more common than major <b>bleeding</b> (12. 1 % vs 3. 8 %). Like major <b>bleeding,</b> non-major <b>bleeding</b> was less frequent with apixaban (6. 4 per 100 patient-years) than warfarin (9. 4 per 100 patient-years) (adjusted HR 0. 69, 95 % CI 0. 63 to 0. 75). The most frequent sites of non-major <b>bleeding</b> were haematuria (16. 4 %), epistaxis (14. 8 %), gastrointestinal (13. 3 %), haematoma (11. 5 %) and bruising/ecchymosis (10. 1 %). Medical or surgical intervention was similar among patients with non-major <b>bleeding</b> on warfarin versus apixaban (24. 7 % vs 24. 5 %). A change in antithrombotic therapy (58. 6 % vs 50. 0 %) and permanent study drug discontinuation (5. 1 % (61) vs 3. 6 % (30), p= 0. 10) was numerically higher with warfarin than apixaban. CRNM <b>bleeding</b> was independently associated with an increased risk of overall death (adjusted HR 1. 70, 95 % CI 1. 32 to 2. 18) and subsequent major <b>bleeding</b> (adjusted HR 2. 18, 95 % CI 1. 56 to 3. 04). CONCLUSIONS: In ARISTOTLE, non-major <b>bleeding</b> was common and substantially less frequent with apixaban than with warfarin. CRNM <b>bleeding</b> was independently associated with a higher risk of death and subsequent major <b>bleeding.</b> Our results highlight the importance of any severity of <b>bleeding</b> in patients with AF treated with anticoagulation therapy and suggest that non-major <b>bleeding,</b> including minor <b>bleeding,</b> might not be minor.

5|$|Meyerbeer's {{personal}} {{attachment to}} Judaism was a mature personal decision â€“ {{after the death}} of his maternal grandfather in 1811 he wrote to his mother 'Please accept from me a promise that I will always live in the religion in which he died'. In his diaries he noted significant family events including birthdays, not by their Gregorian calendar occurrence, but by their Jewish calendar dates. Moreover, he regularly suffered from (and/or imagined) anti-Jewish slights throughout his life, warning his brothers frequently in his letters against richess (Yiddish for 'Jew-hatred'). Writing to Heinrich Heine in 1839, he offered the fatalistic view:I believe that richess is like love in the theatres and novels: no matter how often one encounters it...it never misses its target if effectively wielded... can grow back the foreskin of which we are robbed on the eighth day of life; those who, on the ninth day, do not <b>bleed</b> from this operation shall continue to <b>bleed</b> an entire lifetime, even after death.|$|E

5|$|Recording {{sessions}} began {{shortly after}} the release of Singles in August 2000 and took place in Los Angeles, California. The sales from Singles and the proceeds from Jimmy Eat World's European tour helped fund the album's recording sessions. <b>Bleed</b> American was produced by Mark Trombino. Trombino had already produced two of the band's previous studio albums: Static Prevails (1996) and Clarity (1999), and also produced Blink-182's breakthrough album, Dude Ranch (1997). The money budgeted for the record was insufficient. Trombino offered to work for free during the recording sessions, confident he would be reimbursed by the album's predicted commercial success. Some of the songs included in <b>Bleed</b> American had already been written and recorded during the Clarity sessions, but the band felt they were recorded too late to include them in that album.|$|E

40|$|Objective: In the Apixaban for Prevention of Acute Ischemic Events (APPRAISE- 2) trial, {{the use of}} apixaban, when {{compared}} with placebo, in high-risk patients with a recent acute coronary syndrome (ACS) resulted in {{a significant increase in}} <b>bleeding</b> without a reduction in ischaemic events. The aim of this analysis was to provide further description of these <b>bleeding</b> events and to determine the baseline characteristics associated with <b>bleeding</b> in high-risk post-ACS patients. Methods: APPRAISE- 2 was a multinational clinical trial including 7392 high-risk patients with a recent ACS randomised to apixaban (5 mg twice daily) or placebo. <b>Bleeding</b> including Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) major or minor <b>bleeding,</b> International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) major or clinically relevant non-major (CRNM) <b>bleeding,</b> and any <b>bleeding</b> were analysed using an on-treatment analysis. Kaplanâ€“Meier curves were plotted to describe the timing of <b>bleeding,</b> and a Cox proportional hazards model was used to identify predictors of ISTH major or CRNM <b>bleeding</b> and any <b>bleeding.</b> Median follow-up was 241 days. Results: The proportion of patients who experienced TIMI major or minor, ISTH major or CRNM, and any <b>bleeding</b> was 1. 5 %, 2. 2 % and 13. 3 %, respectively. The incidence of <b>bleeding</b> was highest in the immediate post-ACS period (0. 11 in the first 30 days vs 0. 03 after 30 days events per 1 patient-year); however, > 60 % of major <b>bleeding</b> events occurred > 30 days {{after the end of the}} index hospitalisation. Gastrointestinal <b>bleeding</b> was the most common cause of major <b>bleeding,</b> accounting for 45. 9 % of TIMI major or minor and 39. 5 % of ISTH major or CRNM <b>bleeding</b> events. Independent predictors of ISTH major or CRNM <b>bleeding</b> events included older age, renal dysfunction, dual oral antiplatelet therapy, smoking history, increased white cell count and coronary revascularisation. Conclusions: When compared with placebo, the use of apixaban is associated with an important short-term and long-term risk of <b>bleeding</b> in high-risk post-ACS patients, with gastrointestinal <b>bleeding</b> being the most common source of major <b>bleeding.</b> The baseline predictors of major <b>bleeding</b> appear to be consistent with those identified in lower-risk ACS populations with shorter-term follow-up...|$|R
