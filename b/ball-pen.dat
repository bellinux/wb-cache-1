40|$|Équipe 107 : Physique des plasmas chaudsInternational audienceBall-pen probes {{have been}} used in fusion devices for direct {{measurements}} of the plasma potential. Their application in low-temperature magnetized plasma devices is still subject to studies. In this context, a <b>ball-pen</b> probe has been recently implemented on the linear plasma device Mirabelle. Produced by a thermionic discharge, the plasma is characterized by a low electron temperature and a low density. Plasma confinement is provided by an axial magnetic field that goes up to 100 mT. The principle of the <b>ball-pen</b> probe is to adjust the saturation current ratio to 1 by reducing the electron current contribution. In that case, the floating potential of the probe is close to the plasma potential. A thorough study of the <b>ball-pen</b> probe operation is performed for different designs of the probe over a large set of plasma conditions. Comparisons between <b>ball-pen,</b> Langmuir, and emissive probes are conducted in the same plasma conditions. The <b>ball-pen</b> probe is successfully measuring the plasma potential in these specific plasma conditions only if an adapted electronics and an adapted probe size to the plasma characteristic lengths (lambda(D), rho(ce)) are used...|$|E

Penetrating head injuries can be happened in industrial accidents, car accidents, fall accidents or criminal activities, also they can be occurred in self-inflicted injuries. We reported a case of self-inflicted penetrating head injury to highlight the importance of suicide precaution and review the principle of management of penetrating head injury. Methods and Results: A 58 year-old woman, who has hypertension and major depression, attempted suicide by inserting a <b>ball-pen</b> into her brain through the right temple in the psychiatric ward. CT of brain showed a foreign body penetrating through the right sphenoid ridge to intracranial right frontal-temporal junction, right parasella and suprasella cistern to interpeduncular cistern and acute subarachnoid hemorrhage in the basal cistern and right sylvian fissure. She underwent an emergent neurosurgical procedure to remove the <b>ball-pen,</b> to evacuate the intracranial hematoma and to repair the lacerated dura. She recovered gradually and was clear after surgery, but a right oculomotor palsy and very mild left hemiparesis were left. Discussion: We learn a lesson from this patient, even a <b>ball-pen</b> can become a weapon {{in the hands of}} depression patients.

We use numerical code ESEL to model interchange turbulence and investigate properties of turbulent structures in different regimes of parallel trans- port. Means of experimental verification of the results are discussed. Results of the modelling are then used to interpret unexpected results experimentally obtained by electrostatic <b>ball-pen</b> probes on tokamak ASDEX Upgrade, mainly appearance of a 'bump' in power spectra of measured plasma potential. Next, we explain be- haviour of cross-correlation function of density signals measured by two spatially separated Langmuir probes in the vicinity of magnetic separatrix and we point out an ambiguity in interpretation of results of vorticity measurement made by set of floating Langmuir probes. In the last part, transport of plasma impurities by electrostatic turbulent potential is modelled. We identify reversal of radial particle velocity for particles with [...] ...|$|E
40|$|L’amélioration de la résistance des cyprès à Coryneum cardinale suppose une {{standardisation}} des techniques et la connaissance des relations hôte-parasite. Des techniques d’isolement, de production d’inoculum, d’inoculation et de notation sont proposées. La pression d’inoculum joue un rôle important dans l’inoculation; elle ne dépend ni de l’hôte, ni de l’isolat, mais est modifiée par l’acide naphthalène acétique. L’inoculation sur blessures est toujours positive; l’évolution des infections, d’abord lente, s’accélère dans une phase primaire au cours de laquelle un symptôme nécrotique de l’écorce peut dépasser largement le front d’avance mycélien. Ce symptôme à distance est surtout développé au printemps sur rameaux excisés. L’infection évolue en priorité dans le sens longitudinal, le long du cambium, puis envahit le liber et le phelloderme; elle peut être stoppée par {{la formation}} d’un cal entouré d’une barrière de suber. Les réactions individuelles des hôtes sont diverses; les sujets résistants donnent des lésions plus longues sur rameaux, moins larges sur cônes que les arbres sensibles. Cette corrélation négative ainsi que l’utilisation de plantes de plus de 18 mois pourraient servir de tests précoces de comportement. Improvement in {{the resistance of}} cypress to Coryneum cardinale requires reliable standardized techniques and good knowledge of host reactions. Inoculations were carried out with spore suspension placed in cylindrical wounds cut in the bark with the sharpened metallic end of a <b>ball-pen,</b> or by embedding toothpicks infected with pathogen mycelium into host tissue (fig. 1). Test inoculations were made on small branches (excised or not), detached cones and trunks. Necrotic area and cankers were measured and observations made on pathological and cytological changes in host tissue {{and its ability to}} seal off the diseased area. The effect of temperature on growth was established (fig. 2). The minimum effective dose of inoculum was 50 conidia per wound, but 500 were needed to get full success. This was independent of host species or pathogen strain used (fig. 3, 4), but could be decreased if naphthalene acetic acid was added to the spore suspension (fig. 5). Infection developed along the cambium, with little restriction in the longitudinal direction. Lateral extension occurred through medullary rays between bast fibers, phelloderm cells and into the wood where thick-walled tracheids usually stop the fungus (fig. 7, 8). In excised small branches, brown necrosis frequently occurred in advance of the hyphae (fig. 6), mostly from resistant trees. Resistance could be accomplished in different ways by formation of a collenchymatous callus (fig. 9), surrounded by a wound periderm isolating the affected area. Physiological status of the host, climate and season modified the infection process (fig. 10). Scoring for resistance through individual qualitative reactions was somewhat difficult and was of course difficult to correlate with quantitative parameters, such as lesion size. Comparing resistant versus susceptible hosts by different techniques (table 1) proved to be difficult. However, the negative correlation between infection of cones and small branches of C. sempervirens (fig. 11) could be the basis of an early test to make a rough selection within a population of trees. Seedlings at least 18 months old also looked promising, provided trunk diameter measured more than 8 mm. Further studies will be necessary to obtain good and objective early tests. The broad genetic variability of natural populations gives good hope for success in selecting cypress for resistance to canker...|$|E
