'The Four' were: two Catholics, Berrigan and artist Tom Lewis; and two Protestants, writer David Eberhardt, and the Rev. James L. Mengel III. Mengel was a United States Air Force veteran, United Church of Christ pastor, and missionary to Ghana, West Africa, and Asia, where he also served as an Auxiliary Civilian Chaplain at Osan AFB, Daegu, South Korea. Performing a sacrificial, blood-pouring protest, using their own <b>blood</b> and that <b>from</b> <b>poultry</b> purchased <b>from</b> the Gay St. Market, they poured it over records. In the trial of The Baltimore Four, Mengel stated that U.S. military forces had killed and maimed not only humans, but also animals and vegetation. Mengel agreed to the action and donated blood, but decided not to actually pour blood; instead he distributed the paperback book Good News for Modern Man (a version of the New Testament) to draft board workers, newsmen, and police. Berrigan, in their written statement, noted that [...] "This sacrificial and constructive act" [...] was meant to protest [...] "the pitiful waste of American and Vietnamese blood in Indochina".|$|R

Results showed that L. fermentum strains <b>from</b> <b>poultry</b> digestive tract showed better adherence to the swine intestine and chicken crop epithelial cells as compared to those strains from the swine origin. In addition, six strains <b>from</b> <b>poultry</b> and one strain from swine showed adhesion specificity to their own intestinal epithelium. Four poultry isolates and one swine isolate were able to adhere to the epithelial cells from both swine and chicken. For gastric juice and bile tolerance, most of the strains isolated <b>from</b> swine or <b>poultry</b> were acid tolerant but less strains were bile intolerant. The spent culture supernatant (SCS) of these L. fermentum strains showed antagonistic effect against the indicator bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp., Shigella sonnei and some enterotoxigenic Staphylococcus aureus.
