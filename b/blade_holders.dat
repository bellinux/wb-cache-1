50|$|A hacksaw is a fine-toothed saw, {{originally}} and principally {{made for}} cutting metal. They can also cut various other materials, such as plastic and wood; for example, plumbers and electricians often cut plastic pipe and plastic conduit with them. There are hand saw versions and powered versions (power hacksaws). Most hacksaws are hand saws with a C-shaped frame that holds a blade under tension. Such hacksaws have a handle, usually a pistol grip, with pins for attaching a narrow disposable blade. The frames {{may also be}} adjustable to accommodate blades of different sizes. A screw or other mechanism is used to put the thin blade under tension. Panel hacksaws forgo the frame and instead have a sheet metal body; they can cut into a sheet metal panel further than a frame would allow. These saws are no longer commonly available, but hacksaw <b>blade</b> <b>holders</b> enable standard hacksaw blades to be used similarly to a keyhole saw or pad saw. Power tools including nibblers, jigsaws, and angle grinders fitted with metal-cutting blades and discs are now used for longer cuts in sheet metals.|$|E
50|$|The {{coping saw}} blade is {{installed}} with the teeth pointing towards the handle. Unlike a hacksaw, {{which has the}} teeth pointed away from the handle, the coping saw cuts on the pull stroke. The coping saw blade is removable by partially unscrewing the handle. The blade is prevented from rotating {{by means of the}} short, steady bar provided where the blade is attached. Loosening the handle also allows the blade to be rotated relative to the frame as desired. Carefully aligning the finger with the steady bars at {{the top and bottom of}} the blade ensures that the thin blade is straight and not twisted along its length. Retightening the handle tensions the blade and locks it at the desired angle relative to the frame. The short steady bar nearest the handle is held securely between finger and thumb while the handle is tightened to ensure the blade remains at the desired angle. Unlike the fretsaw the coping saw blade has holding pins which lock securely into the angled slots of the rotatable <b>blade</b> <b>holders.</b>|$|E
50|$|Of necessity, {{the doctor}} blade must be easy and quick to replace. On many machines, the doctor <b>blade</b> <b>holder</b> is easily {{removable}} {{from the machine}} and the replacement of a doctor blade is done by removing the <b>blade</b> <b>holder</b> from the machine; discarding the old blade; inserting the new blade; and then replacing the <b>blade</b> <b>holder</b> + new <b>blade</b> in the machine.|$|R
50|$|Another {{utility knife}} {{often used for}} cutting open boxes {{consists}} of a simple sleeve around a rectangular handle into which single-edge utility blades can be inserted. The sleeve slides {{up and down on}} the handle, holding the blade in place during use and covering the blade when not in use. The <b>blade</b> <b>holder</b> may either retract or fold into the handle, much like a folding-blade pocketknife. The <b>blade</b> <b>holder</b> is designed to expose just enough edge to cut through one layer of corrugated fiberboard, to minimize chances of damaging contents of cardboard boxes.|$|R
40|$|Artschwager {{described}} a cooling apparatus for handling paraffin ribbons during hot weather. Use of this device in our laboratory {{during the summer}} has proven highly satisfactory {{and at the same}} time it suggested to us the idea of using the same principle for keeping the knife blade cool while cutting. Accordingly, a copper box was made 12 x 6 x 4 inches, as shown in the accompanying figure. A suitable lid should be made from the same material. On the back of this box was soldered a narrow strip of copper, which was allowed to project approximately seven inches beyond the end of the box. This projecting strip should be just wide enough to fit into the groove on the back of the <b>blade</b> <b>holder</b> of the microtome, which happens to be just one-half inch in the case of the <b>blade</b> <b>holder</b> used in our laboratory. It should be soldered to the back of the box just high enough from the bottom to permit it to slide easily into the <b>blade</b> <b>holder</b> groove when the holder is in place on the microtome. This height is just three and nine-sixteenths inches for our Spencer Rotary microtome...|$|R
40|$|A tissue machine {{suffering}} from Yankee chatter marks has been experimentally investigated. A series of vibration measurements during normal operation at various Yankee speeds {{on both the}} creping and the cleaning <b>blade</b> <b>holders</b> have been carried out. The analysis in a frequency range up to 20 kHz has permitted to identify speed dependent frequency peaks and broadband high frequency vibration content on the creping zone. Hence, an experimental modal analysis of the creping blade and holder {{has been carried out}} with the machine stopped to identify its natural frequencies. As a result, resonance conditions have been identified due to the gearbox excitation originated by the meshing process. The study of the corresponding mode shapes has permitted to understand the vibration behavior and its relationship with the damage. To solve the problem, the creping blade holder structure has been redesigned to detune the resonances. Since this overhaul, comparable measurements have confirmed a significant reduction of vibrations and high frequency noise. The appearance of chatter marks has been minimized.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{investigate}} the relative contribution of skate blade properties to on-ice skating speed. Thirty-two male ice hockey players (mean age = 19 ± 2. 65 yrs.) representing the Ontario Minor Hockey Association (OMHA; Midget AAA and Junior), Canadian Inter University Sport (CIS: Varsity), Ontario hockey league (OHL) and East Coast Hockey League (ECHL), and the playing positions of forwards (n= 18) and defense (n= 14) were recruited to participate. Skate related equipment worn by the players for the {{purpose of the}} research was documented and revealed that 80 % of the players wore Bauer skates, Tuuk <b>blade</b> <b>holders</b> and LS 2 skate blades. Subjects completed a battery of eight on-ice skating drills used to measure and compare two aspects of skating speed; acceleration [T 1 (s) ] and total time to complete each drill [TT(s) ] while skating on three skate blade conditions. The drills represented skills used in the game of hockey, both in isolation (e. g., forward skating, backward skating, stops and starts, and cornering) and in sequence to simulate the combination of skills used in a shift of game play. The three blade conditions consisted of (i) baseline, represented by the blades worn by the player throughout their current season of play; (ii) experimental blades (EB), represented by brand name experimental blades with manufacturers radius of contour and a standardized radius of hollow; and (iii) customized experimental blades (CEB), represented by the same brand name experimental blades sharpened to the players’ preference as identified in the baseline condition. No significant differences were found in acceleration time [T 1 (s) ] or total time to complete [TT(s) ] the isolated drills across blade conditions; however significant differences were revealed in both T 1 (s) and TT(s) measured during the execution of the sequenced drill across blade conditions. A iii Bonferroni post hoc test revealed that players skated significantly faster when skating on the CEB condition compared to the baseline condition (p≤. 05). A questionnaire assessing subjects perceived comfort, confidence and effort expended while skating on the experimental blades revealed that players were significantly more comfortable when skating on the CEB versus the EB condition (p≤. 05). Outcomes of the study provide evidence to suggest that the experimental skate blades customized with the players preferred blade sharpening characteristics results in faster skating speed in a combination drill representing skills performed in gameplay...|$|E

50|$|Used doctor blades, from gravure {{and other}} {{printing}} and coating processes, may be inspected using a goniometer, typically {{with a built-in}} light source, to examine the blade edge {{to see whether the}} blade has worn at the desired angle and whether there are signs of wear at other angles. A difference in angle from that set on the machine may indicate excessive pressure, and a range of angles ("rounding") probably indicates a lack of stiffness, or wear, in the <b>blade</b> <b>holder</b> assembly.|$|R
50|$|The {{two-part tariff}} is {{another form of}} price {{discrimination}} where the producer charges an initial fee then a secondary fee {{for the use of}} the product. An example of this is razors, you pay an initial cost for the razor and then pay for the replacement blades. This pricing strategy works because it shifts the demand curve to the right: since you have already paid for the initial <b>blade</b> <b>holder</b> you will buy the blades which are now cheaper than buying a disposable razor.|$|R
