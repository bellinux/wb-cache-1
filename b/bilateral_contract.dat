It introduces a model for optimizing portfolios composed by end-use consumers using the Markowitz theory. It also presents an overview of a multi-agent system for electricity markets. The system simulates the behavior of various markets entities, including generating companies, retailers and consumers. The final part of the paper presents three case studies on portfolio optimization involving risk management: a retailer (a software agent) optimizes its portfolio by {{taking into account the}} attitude towards risk and the offer of a 3 -rate tariff to five different types of consumers: industrial, large and small commercial, residential and street lightning.

50|$|This {{understanding}} {{was part of}} a <b>bilateral</b> <b>contract</b> made between the king and the people. The people would work the land and give taxes to the king for protection. The contract implies that the people submitted to a sovereign authority that they created, they volunteered to pay the tax, the tax rate was fixed by the people, the taxes are paid to the king as a wage for his protection and the king has to answer to the people. From this it can be concluded that the king has the right to tax, it is the duty of the people to pay taxes, and the duty is conditional on the performance of the king in his duties. This idea of the king’s performance in protection in relationship to taxation is so important that some texts require the king to compensate for any stolen goods he failed to recover.|$|E

Moreover, through the voice of the young priest, the Holy Virgin is requested to kindly establish Her throne in the chapel to spread Her treasures. Each group member agrees to give up now entirely to the Mother of God, and to let themselves be guided by Her through their existence. The group founds a Marian Congregation. This was the beginning and the lasting foundation of today’s worldwide development of the Schoenstatt Movement.

50|$|Over-the-counter (OTC) or {{off-exchange trading}} is to trade {{financial}} instruments such as stocks, bonds, commodities or derivatives directly between two parties. It is contrasted with exchange trading, which occurs via facilities constructed {{for the purpose}} of trading (i.e., exchanges), such as futures exchanges or stock exchanges.In the U.S., over-the-counter trading in stock is carried out by market makers that make markets in OTCBB and Pink Sheets securities using inter-dealer quotation services such as Pink Quote (operated by Pink OTC Markets) and the OTC Bulletin Board (OTCBB). OTC stocks are not usually listed nor traded on any stock exchanges, though exchange listed stocks can be traded OTC on the third market. Although stocks quoted on the OTCBB must comply with United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reporting requirements, other OTC stocks, such as those stocks categorized as Pink Sheets securities, have no reporting requirements, while those stocks categorized as OTCQX have met alternative disclosure guidelines through Pink OTC Markets. An over-the-counter contract is a <b>bilateral</b> <b>contract</b> in which two parties agree on how a particular trade or agreement is to be settled in the future. It is usually from an investment bank to its clients directly. Forwards and swaps are prime examples of such contracts. It is mostly done via the computer or the telephone.

40|$|Problem Statement: Deregulation {{power systems}} have been force to change their structures, from {{vertically}} integrated to open market systems. Each generation company (Genco) is required to compete with rivals through bidding in a pool market and making a <b>bilateral</b> <b>contract</b> with a distribution company (Disco) or consumers to maximize its own profits. A unit commitment becomes responsible for each Genco and difficult for Genco that have one generation plant or small generation capacity. The objective of a Genco is to maximize its profits with makes a decision submit bidding price function to the Independent System Operator (ISO). In order to achieve this goal, it is necessary and important for a small Genco to build optimal bidding strategies considering a <b>bilateral</b> <b>contract</b> and a unit commitment with constraints in time periods for possibilities to get a discontinuous dispatch that could reduce total profits. Approach: The proposed methodology employs an optimization method like Lagrange Relaxation to solve the optimal bidding problem. The solution procedure is applied in the study case and change the market condition to show the effect of <b>bilateral</b> <b>contract</b> to marginal clearing price (MCP), generation output and total profit for a small Genco.
