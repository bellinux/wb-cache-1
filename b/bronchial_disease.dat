25|$|From a {{young age}} on his family estate in Sterrebeek, Derscheid {{developed}} an interest in ornithology and aviculture. He built a research station for bird behavior called Armendy Farm that {{was active in the}} 1930s. In cooperation with colleagues in France, England, Germany, the United States and Australia he succeeded in assembling one of the best captive breeding bird collections in Europe, specializing in Anatidae and Loriinae (ducks, swans, geese; and the group of small parrots consisting of lories and lorikeets). Derscheid also kept the omnivorous alpine parrots from New Zealand known as keas. There, he researched dietary requirements and incubation, sending specimens to zoos throughout Europe, America, and Australia. He was particularly interested in aspergillosis, a <b>bronchial</b> <b>disease</b> caused by mold that decimated flocks of wild sea ducks as he tried to acclimatize them to the freshwater park environment, but which Derscheid succeeded in curing. Derscheid's techniques were widely adopted and applied, most notably at the nature reserve in Zwin (Belgium), known for its collections of salt-resistant plants and an aviary specializing in wading birds. An obituary of Derscheid states: “His collection at Sterrebeek was known throughout Europe, America and Australasia, and his success with the Anatidae, particularly with the sea-duck, placed him in the forefront of waterfowl experts.” Prior to the outbreak of World War II, Derscheid transferred some of his collection of exotic birds to the late John J. Yealland, who carried them in a cardboard box on one of the last boats to leave Belgium before the German invasion. Later the Curator of Birds at the London Zoo, Yealland also published on Derscheid's bird collections from notes prepared during the latter's imprisonment.|$|E

40|$|The author {{carried out}} a histopathologic study of {{abnormalities}} of the bronchial epithelium in 42 cases of chronic pulmonary and <b>bronchial</b> <b>diseases</b> of non-tuberculous origin and 29 cases of lung cancer, that had undergone resection of the lung in our clinic. Metaplasia and proliferation of the epithelial cells was observed in considerably large proportions of cases of non-cancerous diseases. It was noticed that in all the cases this pathologic condition occurred in association with inflammation. It was impossible to correlate it {{with the emergence of}} neoplasm. A similar pathologic condition was observed in cases of cancer also. Not related to inflammation, it was seen around neoplasms. There was evidence to support a conjecture that the occurrence of this pathologic condition might have a bearing on the development of malignant tumors. It was impossible, however, to establish correlation between this pathologic condition and clinical findings. It would seem that metaplasia and proliferation of bronchial epithelial cells is a pathologic condition which cases of chronic pulmonary and <b>bronchial</b> <b>diseases</b> of non-cancerous origin share with cases of lung cancer. It is supposed that, should this pathologic condition prevail uniformly in the lung tissue without any apparent direct relation to inflammation, it might lead to the development of cancer...|$|R

30|$|The {{radiologist}} has a {{wide array}} of imaging modalities to evaluate for <b>bronchial</b> <b>disease.</b> The initial study of choice in virtually all cases of <b>bronchial</b> <b>disease</b> is the chest standard frontal and lateral x-ray for its ease and convenience [2]. If further investigation is necessary, computed tomography (CT) is typically the next imaging modality of choice [3]. For these studies, contrast administration is often not necessary. Thin axial slices are recommended to allow for isotropic imaging and improved post-processing, including two-dimensional multiplanar reformatting, three-dimensional volume rendering, and virtual endoscopy, as these can be important diagnostic tools to better understand the anatomy of the bronchi and elucidate pathology [4]. Specialised imaging, such as high-resolution chest CT (HRCT), can be useful for assessment of conditions such as pulmonary fibrosis and bronchiectasis [5]. Occasionally, dynamic imaging is used to evaluate for conditions such as tracheobronchomalacia and Williams-Campbell syndrome when abnormalities may only be present during certain phases of the respiratory cycle [6]. Scanning children (especially those under 5  years of age) can be challenging because of an inability to follow technologist instructions, sometimes requiring sedation and intubation for scanning; however many of the newer multidetector CTs have faster scan times and can decrease or eliminate the need for sedation and/or intubation [7].|$|E
40|$|Airway remodelling is a {{critical}} feature of chronic <b>bronchial</b> <b>diseases,</b> characterised by aberrant repair of the epithelium and accumulation of fibroblasts, which contribute to extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition resulting in fixed bronchial obstruction. Recently, epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) {{has been identified as}} a new source of fibroblasts that could contribute to the remodelling of the airways. This phenomenon consists of the loss of the epithelial phenotype by bronchial epithelial cells and the acquisition of a mesenchymal phenotype. These cells are then able to migrate and secrete ECM molecules. Herein, we review the different types of EMT. We will then focus on the signalling pathways that are involved, such as transforming growth factor-β and Wnt, as well as the more recently described Sonic Hedgehog pathway. Finally, we will highlight the implication of EMT in airway remodelling in specific chronic bronchial pathologies, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and bronchiolitis obliterans following lung transplantation. Despite the limitations of in vitro models, future studies of EMT in vivo are warranted to shed new light on the pathomechanisms of bronchial obstruction...|$|R

This study investigates biomarkers of effect in exhaled breath (nitric oxide (NO)) and in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) (hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2), anions, toxic heavy metals of tobacco smoke) for patients with lung diseases inhaling salt-bromide-iodine thermal water. Methods. This study enrolled two groups of patients, twenty with alveolar pulmonary diseases—pneumoconiosis—twenty-two with <b>bronchial</b> <b>diseases.</b> Patients received 12 days inhalation treatment with thermal water in Terme of Monticelli (Parma), Italy. Results. No statistically significant differences were found for NO at different flow rates in both groups of patients before and after thermal water inhalation. Also in EBC no statistically significant differences were present for H 2 O 2 concentrations, toxic heavymetals concentrations, and anion concentrations before and after treatment. Nitrates in EBC were found to be significantly higher in patients before inhalation than in controls as well as in patients after inhalation versus controls. Conclusions.

In this study we evaluated in vivo the effects of nebivolol on airway responsiveness compared to atenolol, pindolol, and propranolol. In New Zealand white rabbits total lung resistance (R(L)) and dynamic compliance (Cdyn) were calculated. In acute protocol, the animals were intravenously injected with the beta-blockers at different doses while in the chronic protocol, animals were daily injected for 30 days. Furthermore, the changes induced by beta-blockers (higher doses) in R(L) and Cdyn after a treatment with salbutamol were calculated. In acute treatment, airway responsiveness to histamine was not modified by nebivolol at any dosage, but increased significantly following the exposure to the higher doses of the other beta-blockers. In chronic treatment, the thirty-day exposure to nebivolol, did not modify the airway responsiveness to histamine, whereas the other beta-blockers significantly increased airway responsiveness. Moreover, nebivolol affected the salbutamol-induced relaxation less markedly than other beta-blockers do. These data demonstrate that nebivolol respect the other beta-blockers used in this study, does not significantly affect the airway responsiveness, therefore it could be used in patients with both cardiovascular and <b>bronchial</b> <b>diseases</b> more safely than other beta-blockers drugs...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{unilateral}} vocal cord paralysis and intracordal Teflon injection on maximum expiratory and inspiratory flows was studied in 15 consecutive patients. Ten patients had {{a ratio of}} forced expiratory flow to forced inspiratory flow at 50 % vital capacity (Ve 50 /Vi 50) more than one. Of the remaining five, four had low Ve 50 consistent with underlying <b>bronchial</b> <b>disease.</b> Repeat studies were obtained in 10 patients two or more weeks after Teflon injection into a vocal cord for voice therapy. Maximum expiratory flow rates did not change (means 6. 64 +/- 0. 881 /sec before and 6. 47 +/- 1. 101 /s after injection). Inspiratory flow at 50 % vital capacity improved in all six patients with a forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) greater than 75 % of the forced vital capacity (FVC). In patients with an FEV 1 less than 75 % FVC, no consistent changes could be seen. We conclude that a high Ve 50 /Vi 50 suggestive of variable extrathoracic airways obstruction is a frequent finding {{in the presence of}} unilateral vocal cord paralysis. Teflon injection does not cause a significant reduction in forced expiratory flows and improves inspiratory flows in subjects without evidence of underlying <b>bronchial</b> <b>disease...</b>|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND—Airway inflammation, with {{recruitment}} of neutrophils to the airway lumen, results in purulent secretions {{and a variety}} of potential adverse consequences for patients with chronic bronchitis and bronchiectasis. We hypothesised that gradations of sputum colour would correlate directly with the myeloperoxidase content of sputum and with various other indicators of the activity and consequences of <b>bronchial</b> <b>diseases.</b>  METHODS—To test this hypothesis, we quantified sputum colour by reference to a sensitive nine point colour chart and correlated this assessment with indices of a number of inflammatory mediators in sputum.  RESULTS—The results indicate that standardised visual measurements of sputum colour correlated strongly with myeloperoxidase, interleukin 8, leucocyte elastase (both activity and total quantity), sputum volume, protein leak, and secretory leucocyte proteinase inhibitor (p< 0. 001 for all). In addition, there was a strong direct correlation between leucocyte elastase and both myeloperoxidase (p< 0. 003) and sputum volume (p< 0. 001), but a strong negative correlation with secretory leucocyte proteinase inhibitor (p< 0. 001).  CONCLUSIONS—These results indicate that sputum colour graded visually relates to the activity of the underlying markers of bronchial inflammation. The results of this simple visual analysis of sputum provides guidance concerning underlying inflammation and its damaging potential. It also provides a useful scientific tool for improving the monitoring of chronic airways diseases and response to treatment. ...|$|R

40|$|The nose is {{strategically}} {{placed at the}} entrance of the airway. Nose breathing takes place under physiologic circumstances and protects the lower airways from exposure to unconditioned air and exogenous particles. Alternatively, nasal disease may {{have a negative impact on}} lower airway biology, being involved in aggravation of <b>bronchial</b> <b>disease.</b> The interaction between upper and lower airway disease has been recognized for centuries. Due to the increase in prevalence of allergic diseases during the last decades, new interest has been gained in understanding the mechanisms underlying the interaction between rhinitis and asthma. Nowadays, allergic rhinitis and asthma are considered part of a global airway disease, with both diagnostic and therapeutic consequences for every day clinical practice. Besides allergy, other inflammatory conditions of the upper airways are associated with lower airway disease via unknown mechanisms. Viral rhinitis often coincides with exacerbations of <b>bronchial</b> <b>disease,</b> chronic sinus disease with or without nasal polyps frequently relates to bronchial dysfunction and occupational rhinitis and asthma are often present in the same individuals.

Ivabradin (average dose — 14 mg/day) or Verapamil SR (average dose — 443 mg/day) were administered to ischemic patients (n= 84) with postinfarction cardiosclerosis, stable angina (class l-ll) and painless myocardial ischemia. Concomitant bronchial obstructive deseases included controlled/partly controlled bronchial asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (stage II-III). Both medications have demonstrated the same antianginal/antiischemic activity and have improved physical exertion tolerance. Ivabradin was more effective for heart rate (HR) aim level and 24 -hour HR control. Ivabradin advantages were more expressed by changing of NYHA class (from class II to class I) and increase of 6 MWD.

Bronchiolitis {{in early}} {{childhood}} caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) {{is considered to be}} important risk factor of the recurrent wheezing and asthma development. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine the frequency of RSV infection and atopy in children up to two years of age and to determine their correlation with bronchial hyperreactivity. Methods. The study included 175 children aged 5 - 24 months. The presence of RSV infection was identified by serum levels of IgA and IgG determined by ELISA. Bronchial hyperreactivity (BHR) has been defined as the existence of chronic <b>bronchial</b> <b>disease</b> and/or three or more previous suspected diagnosis of acute <b>bronchial</b> <b>disease.</b> Atopy was confirmed by detection of the specific serum IgE using quantitative multitest Phadiatop infant (cut off ≥ 0. 35 kUA/L). Results. The children with atopy were more frequently infected with RSV (43. 3 %) than those without atopy (22. 8 %; p = 0. 02). The higher frequency of RSV infection was found in children with BHR in comparison with those without it but only in the group who also had atopy (77. 8 % vs 28. 6 %, p = 0. 018). In the female children, BHR and RSV infection were associated in 62. 5 % of cases, regardless the atopy. In the male children with atopy, RSV infection was associated with BHR in 83. 3 % of the cases, while in those without atopy, RSV infection with BHR was found in only 17. 4 % of the cases. Conclusion. Children up to two years of age with atopy are more frequently infected with RSV (43. 3 %) than non-atopic children. Every third child with atopy develops BHR and 77. 8 % of them also have RSV infection. Atopic children are at higher risk for development of BHR when infected with RSV also...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Inflammatory bowel {{diseases}} (IBD) include {{ulcerative colitis}} (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) and {{are due to}} a dysregulation of the antimicrobial defense normally provided by the intestinal mucosa.

The median hospitalization in fall was greater than the median hospitalization of other seasons only for the group of children and adolescents (p = 0. 0001). A multiple linear regression model showed that the maximum temperature and maximum relative humidity predict almost 20...|$|R

We wanted to clarify whether the revascularized bronchial artery system is functional after 2 years, whether bronchial artery vascularity changes with time, and whether posttransplantation <b>bronchial</b> artery <b>disease</b> is arteriographically evident after 2 years. Methods: Bronchial artery revascularization is performed by anastomosing the internal thoracic artery to as many bronchial artery orifices in the donor descending aorta as possible. Twenty-three patients surviving 2 years or more have had internal thoracic artery-bronchial arteriography performed 1 month and 2 years after transplantation. One-month and 2 -year arteriograms have been compared. Results: Two-year patency of the internal thoracic artery conduit was 100 %. The appearance of the bronchial arteries was unchanged after 2 years in 11 patients. A unilateral or bilateral increase in vascularity was found in two and seven patients, respectively. In three patients new vessels, not visible on the first arteriogram, had appeared. In four patients one or more small vessels visible on the first arteriogram had disappeared on the second arteriogram. We have found no arteriographic signs of <b>bronchial</b> artery <b>disease,</b> such as stenosis of the bronchial arteries, and no arteriographic evidence of arteriosclerotic disease in the internal thoracic artery. Conclusion: The internal thoracic artery is an excellent conduit for bronchial artery revascularization, with a 2 -year patency of 100 % in 23 patients. Only minor changes in the bronchial arteriograms have been found. (J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 1997; 114 : 326 - 31...|$|R
