40|$|Introduction. Lingual {{thyroid gland}} {{is a rare}} anomaly of thyroid gland development, {{occurring}} more frequently in females. If it causes local symptomatology such as dysphagia, dysphonia or dyspnea it is diagnosed in childhood, however, if it is asymptomatic it is usually diagnosed in adulthood. Case Outline. We present a 23 -year-old female patient in whom we diagnosed lingual thyroid gland coincidentally during diagnostic procedures of a concomitant disease. The application of 131 I scintigraphy showed an oval field of intensive accumulation of <b>radio</b> <b>markers</b> in the zone of medial face line, around tongue base, with the absence of thyroid gland in its physiological position. Functional testing proved primary hypothyroidism and we started the application of substitution therapy. The application of levothyroxine resulted in reaching euthyroid state and the reduction of thyroid gland size. Conclusion. We present a very rare anomaly of the thyroid gland, and so far {{there have been no}} clear attitudes about further treatment. The general condition of the patient, age, the size of ectopic thyroid gland and the existence of local symptomatology or complications represent the factors that have influence on the choice of treatment method...|$|R

40|$|This work {{describes}} the multi-printing technique for preparing, with a commercial inkjet printer and radio marked ink, planar emission phantoms particularly suitable for high-resolution radionuclide imaging. The well known practice of producing radioactive phantoms by inkjet was improved by developing the multi-printing technique definable as the reiteration of printing commands before processing the next line. The major advantage {{consists of the}} increase of the concentration of radioactivity deposited in the image {{with respect to the}} standard over-printing method without refilling radioactivity in the cartridge. Since the paper needs just one insertion in the printer, a better outlined image is produced than {{in the case of the}} over-printing technique obtainable by reiterating both the insertion and the printing of the same image over of the same sheet This paper discusses in particular: (1) the linear dependence of deposited activity vs. the number of multi-printing cycles; (2) the effective decay's ti e of <b>radio</b> <b>marker</b> at nozzle's output; (3) the evaluation of the absolute value of the activity deposited in the image and (4) the broadening of the printed surfaces vs. the number of multi-printing cycles. © 2008 IEEE...|$|R

2500|$|After the {{cancellation}} of its airmail contracts, the airline industry underwent a drastic shake-up and emerged in late 1934 and throughout 1935 with new leadership but countless pressing problems, the most serious of which was its poor economic condition. Fourteen scheduled air carriers {{decided to leave the}} manufacturer-dominated Aeronautical Chamber of Commerce and form the Air Transport Association of America with its headquarters in Chicago, Illinois. Gorrell was invited to be its first president. He dropped his California housing venture and assumed his new role on January 14, 1936. In introducing himself to the press, Gorrell predicted four improvements in the industry by 1938: standardization of aircraft, the introduction of four-engined transports capable of speeds of 250mph, new safety equipment, and trans-Atlantic passenger service. Although the last did not begin until June 1939 and four-engined transports were not put into general service until 1940, Gorrell's vision immediately put the ATA on a [...] "paying basis" [...] with the industry. Gorrell appeared before hearings of the Copeland Committee on airline safety in February 1936 and his pledge of immediate improvement in safety began to be fulfilled when on December 31, 1936, he announced that the Bureau of Air Commerce had allocated ten million dollars of its appropriations to finance a system of <b>radio</b> <b>marker</b> beacon stations along scheduled airline routes.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to assess {{clinical}} features and colonic transit patterns in Brazilian children with refractory constipation. METHODS: From 2010 to 2013, 79 constipated patients received follow-up care in a tertiary hospital. Of these patients, 28 (aged 8 - 14 years) were refractory to conventional therapy and underwent a simplified visual method of nuclear colonic transit study, by ingestion of a liquid meal containing 9. 25 MBq/kg of 99 mTc-phytate. Abdominal static images were taken immediately and at two, six, 24, 30, and 48 h after ingestion for qualitative analysis of the <b>radio</b> <b>marker</b> progression through the colon. RESULTS: Two patterns of colonic transit were found: slow colonic transit (SCT,n = 14), when images at 48 h showed a larger part of the tracer remained in proximal and transverse colon, and distal retention (DR, n = 14), when after 30 h, the radio isotope passed the transverse colon and was retained in the rectosigmoid up to 48 h. The SCT and DR group included, respectively, nine and ten males; median ages in the nuclear study of 11 and 10 years, p = 0. 207; median duration of constipation of seven and six years, p = 0. 599. Constipation appearing during first year age (p = 0. 04) and report of soft stools (p = 0. 02) were more common in SCT patients. Palpable abdominal fecal impaction was found only in DR group. Appendicostomy for antegrade continence enema was successful in 4 / 12 (30 %) of SCT patients (median follow-up: 2. 4 years).
