5|$|On 29 January 1916, {{while reading}} in <b>bed</b> <b>by</b> candlelight, Markham {{set fire to}} the bedclothes and was {{overcome}} by smoke. He died the following day. His last diary entry, a few days earlier, had recorded a visit from Peter Markham Scott.|$|E
5|$|Chaucer's Criseyde is {{swayed by}} Diomedes playing on her fear. Pandarus is now her uncle, more worldly-wise and {{more active in}} what happens and so Troilus is more passive. This {{passivity}} is given comic treatment when Troilus passes out in Criseyde's bedroom and is lifted into her <b>bed</b> <b>by</b> Pandarus. Troilus' repeated emotional paralysis is {{comparable to that of}} Hamlet who may have been based on him. It can be seen as driven by loyalty both to Criseyde and to his homeland, but has also been interpreted less kindly.|$|E
5|$|Following World War II, Thơ became Interior Minister in the French-backed State of Vietnam under former Emperor Bảo Đại. Following the {{withdrawal}} of France from Indochina after the Battle of Điện Biên Phủ, Vietnam was partitioned into a communist north and anti-communist south. Following the proclamation of the Republic of Vietnam—commonly known as South Vietnam—by President Ngô Đình Diệm, who had dethroned Bảo Đại in a fraudulent referendum, Thơ was appointed the inaugural ambassador to Japan. Despite spending {{most of his time}} in Tokyo confined to his <b>bed</b> <b>by</b> a fractured hip, Thơ secured reparations from Japan for its imperial occupation of Vietnam during World War II.|$|E

5|$|Following such performances, the Jackson {{brothers}} {{would be}} tucked in <b>bed</b> <b>by</b> their oblivious mother and {{reminded of the}} virtues of being a good Jehovah's Witness. Katherine remained unaware of her sons' strip club activities for many years. Journalist J. Randy Taraborrelli reflected on Jackson's early life and noted that {{at such a young}} age, the singer may not have been psychologically equipped to fully understand any sexual stimulation he may have received from such voyeuristic events. The writer further commented that Jackson's views on sex must have been conflicted between those of his religiously strict mother and his more libertine and promiscuous father.|$|E
5|$|Freedom from Fear is {{the last}} of the {{well-known}} Four Freedoms oil paintings produced by the American artist Norman Rockwell. The series was based on the four goals known as the Four Freedoms, which were enunciated by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in his State of the Union Address on January 6, 1941. This work was published in the March 13, 1943, issue of The Saturday Evening Post alongside an essay by a prominent thinker of the day, Stephen Vincent Benét. The painting is generally described as depicting American children being tucked into <b>bed</b> <b>by</b> their parents while the Blitz rages across the Atlantic in Great Britain.|$|E
5|$|Judge Appleby also {{threatened}} Kunstler with dismissal {{and contempt}} of court after he delivered an October 21, 1976 speech at nearby Rutgers University that in part discussed the upcoming trial, but later ruled that Kunstler could represent Shakur. Until obtaining a court order, Williams was forced to strip naked and undergo a body search before each visit with Shakur—during which Shakur was shackled to a <b>bed</b> <b>by</b> both ankles. Judge Appleby also refused to investigate a burglary of her defense counsel's office {{that resulted in the}} disappearance of trial documents, amounting to half of the legal papers related to her case. Her lawyers also claimed that their offices were bugged.|$|E

5|$|On August 13, 2007, Adams {{was found}} {{unconscious}} in his <b>bed</b> <b>by</b> his youngest son (age 7) at their Tampa, Florida home. His son called 911, but Adams {{was pronounced dead}} by paramedics when they arrived. The medical examiner concluded that he {{died as a result}} of mixing the painkiller buprenorphine with the muscle relaxant carisoprodol and the sedatives chlordiazepoxide and alprazolam. The coroner determined the drugs in his system were individually at therapeutic levels, but their combination impeded his respiratory system enough to kill him. He was 43 years old.|$|E
5|$|Skinner {{sees the}} old woman looking at him on a city street. However, when he pursues {{the old woman}}, he instead finds Sharon. The agents talk to Sharon, who says that the {{marriage}} failed because of Skinner's emotional distance. Scully learns that Skinner had been receiving treatment for a sleep disorder, in which he apparently had dreams about being suffocated in <b>bed</b> <b>by</b> an old woman. She fears that Skinner may have unwittingly killed Sayles in his sleep. However, Mulder believes that Skinner may be having visions of a succubus, a female demon, with the mention of similar symptoms of people's bad dreams they've experienced.|$|E
5|$|With the 1st Light Horse Brigade in reserve, Chauvel {{sent the}} New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade and the 3rd Light Horse Brigade {{to move on}} Magdhaba by the north and {{north-east}} {{to cut off the}} possibility of retreat while the Imperial Camel Corps Brigade followed the telegraph line straight to Magdhaba. The 1st Light Horse Brigade advanced mounted to the attack but fierce shrapnel fire forced them to advance up the wadi <b>bed.</b> <b>By</b> midday all three brigades and the Camel Brigade, despite support from machine-guns and artillery, were hotly engaged. Aerial reconnaissance from Australian and British aircraft, which scouted out the Turkish positions, greatly assisted the attack, although the Turkish positions were obscured by the effect of a mirage and dust clouds.|$|E
50|$|In 1901, Dr. Earl Douglass {{discovered}} fossil plants, mollusks, and vertebrae at Bear Butte, {{northwest of}} Melville in Sweet Grass County's Fort Union Beds. In 1933, another fossil site called the Scarritt site {{opened in the}} Fort Union <b>beds.</b> <b>By</b> {{the publication of a}} 1937 paper on the Fort Union <b>beds</b> <b>by</b> George Gaylord Simpson, 57 different fossil sites were known from the beds and 25 were of significant quality. Among the finds were arctocyonids, insectivores, multituberculates, pantodonts, primates, and taeniodonts.|$|R

5|$|After {{spending}} the night together, Tosh and Tommy return to the hospital as the disruptions intensify, accompanied by Jack. During one disruption, the three witness the 1918 Torchwood team; Jack relays instructions through Tommy {{for them to take}} the 1918 version of Tommy into their custody before the older Tommy arrives. Tommy and Tosh share a goodbye, and Jack briefs Tommy on using the Rift Key before he steps back to 1918 during the next disruption. However, when back in the past, Tommy becomes shell-shocked, and is led back to his <b>bed</b> <b>by</b> nurses; he is unable to operate the Rift Key in his state. At Torchwood's headquarters, Jack and Tosh use the Cardiff Rift to project an image of Tosh into Tommy's mind. Tommy senses some familiarity with Tosh but otherwise does not recognise her. Despite this, Tosh is able to instruct Tommy to activate the Rift Key, and the distortions at the hospital soon dissipate. Recovering from events, Tosh brushes off Owen's sympathy and takes a moment to consider her short time with Tommy.|$|E
5|$|Upon her joining, {{however, the}} members of the group are {{targeted}} and murdered one by one. All of their deaths relate to their fears: Mark falls down an elevator shaft, trying to escape from the darkness when the lights go out, and is torn in half. Paul accidentally consumes a cockroach while eating a bag of chips; he is given cleaning solution by a masked figure, and upon drinking it, burns a hole in his throat. Laura begins to suspect these deaths are not accidental. The hospital loses power, leaving Laura, Alison, Darren, Nicky, Dr. Jessica Ryan, and the receptionist Gloria in the dark. Gloria goes to the basement to turn the lights back on, but once the patients return to their rooms, Alison is tied to her <b>bed</b> <b>by</b> the Boogeyman. He places maggots on her arms, which burrow into her skin via her self-inflicted incisions, and she kills herself attempting to cut them out.|$|E

5000|$|In July 2012, Council {{endorsed}} a [...] "residential accommodation strategy" [...] for 2012-2020. This sets {{a target of}} 50-70% of students housed in University accommodation and predicted growth in student numbers to 14,000 in Durham City and 2,500 at the Queen's Campus by 2015/16 and to 15,300 in Durham City and 3,400 at the Queen's Campus by 2019/20. With 5,700 beds in Durham and 900 in Stockton for 2012/13, meeting the accommodation targets would require (in Durham) 1,250 new <b>beds</b> <b>by</b> 2015 and 1,950 by 2019 and (in Stockton) 730 new <b>beds</b> <b>by</b> 2015 and 1,150 by 2019.|$|R

5|$|Hydras {{and some}} sea anemones can move slowly over rocks and sea or stream <b>beds</b> <b>by</b> various means: {{creeping}} like snails, crawling like inchworms, or by somersaulting. A few can swim clumsily by waggling their bases.|$|R
25|$|Secondly the {{combustion}} is aided by spraying the black liquor into small droplets. Controlling process by directing spray proved easy. Spraying {{was used in}} early rotary furnaces and with some success adapted to stationary furnace by H. K. Moore. Thirdly one can control the char <b>bed</b> <b>by</b> having primary air level at char bed surface and more levels above. Multiple level air system was introduced by C. L. Wagner.|$|E
25|$|The second {{prototype}} Viscount, the Type 663 testbed, had two Rolls-Royce Tay turbojet {{engines and}} first flew in RAF markings as serial VX217 at Wisley on 15 March 1950. It was demonstrated at the Farnborough SBAC Show in September {{and was later}} used {{in the development of}} powered controls for the Valiant bomber. It later saw use as a test <b>bed</b> <b>by</b> Boulton Paul Ltd for the development of electronic flight control systems.|$|E
25|$|In some areas, a scallop dredge is used. This is a toothed bar {{attached}} to a chain bag. The dredge is towed through an oyster <b>bed</b> <b>by</b> a boat, picking up the oysters in its path. While dredges collect oysters more quickly, they heavily damage the beds, and their use is highly restricted. Until 1965, Maryland limited dredging to sailboats, and even since then motor boats can be used only on certain days of the week. These regulations prompted the development of specialized sailboats (the bugeye and later the skipjack) for dredging.|$|E
