50|$|The Rubottom {{oxidation}} {{has remained}} largely unchanged since its initial disclosure, {{but one of}} the major drawbacks of standard conditions is the acidic environment, which can lead to unwanted side reactions and degradation. A simple sodium bicarbonate buffer system is commonly employed to alleviate this issue, which is especially problematic in bicyclic and other complex molecule syntheses (see synthetic examples). The introduction of chiral oxidants has also allowed for the synthesis of enantiopure α-hydroxy carbonyl derivatives from their corresponding silyl enol ethers. The first example of an enantioselective Rubottom oxidation was published by F.A. Davis in 1987 and showcased the Davis chiral oxaziridine methodology to give good yields but modest enantiomeric excesses. In 1992, K.B. Sharpless showed that the asymmetric dihydroxylation conditions developed in his group could be harnessed to give either (R)- or (S)- α-hydroxy ketones from the corresponding silyl enol ethers depending on which Chinchona alkaloid-derived chiral ligands were employed. The groups of Y. Shi and W. Adam published another enantioselective variant of the Rubottom oxidation in 1998 using the Shi chiral ketone in the presence of oxone in a <b>buffered</b> <b>system</b> to furnish α-hydroxy ketones in high yield and high enantiomeric excess.

40|$|The {{concepts}} of buffering and “muffling ” {{are closely related}} to the paradigms of signal processing and of systems and control theory. In the previous sections, we established a framework that could handle buffered systems even when they were dimensionally heterogeneous (e. g. autoregulation of flow in the face of pressure variations) or time dependent (e. g. the “muffling ” of calcium). Control systems can be viewed as systems that are both, i. e., dimensionally heterogeneous and time dependent. By combining the two approaches established above, our buffering concept can be extended to systems and control theory. This extension will prove fruitful inasmuch it allows one to derive 1) two novel quantitative measures of “systems level buffering ” in time-independent, stationary systems, and 2) two novel measures of control efficiency in time-dependent, non-stationary systems. More generally, this extension allows one to accommodate buffering and muffling within the language of control theory; as homeostatic mechanisms, this is where they belong.

Acrolein reacts rapidly with proteins, forming adducts that retain carbonyl groups. Damage by this route may thus contribute to the burden of carbonylated proteins in tissues. This work evaluated several amine compounds with known aldehyde-scavenging properties for their ability to attenuate protein carbonylation by acrolein. The compounds tested were: (i) the glycoxidation inhibitors, aminoguanidine and carnosine; (ii) the antihypertensive, hydralazine; and (iii) the classic carbonyl reagent, methoxyamine. Each compound attenuated carbonylation of a model protein, bovine serum albumin, during reactions with acrolein at neutral pH and 37 °C. However, the most efficient agent was hydralazine, which strongly suppressed carbonylation under these conditions. Study of the rate of reaction between acrolein and the various amines in a protein-free <b>buffered</b> <b>system</b> buttressed these findings, since hydralazine reacted with acrolein at rates 2 – 3 times faster than its reaction with the other scavengers.

Therefore, {{it is important to}} study the electrolysis of water under neutral pH. In acidic or alkaline conditions, pH 0 and 14, respectively, one H+ or OH− ion is present among approximately 55 H 2 O molecules. In terms of kinetics, the reaction with hydronium ions (protons) or hydroxyl ions that have a very large diffusion coefficient is more facile than that with water molecules for reduction and oxidation, respectively [26, 100]. In neutral conditions, however, a different reaction mechanism has been observed [26, 101]. Insufficient hydronium/hydroxyl ion activities at near-neutral pH induced the limiting diffusion currents of reactions with these ions. In this condition, buffering actions are effective based on the reactant switching over varied pH [101].

The influence of coupler and <b>buffer</b> <b>system</b> to the dynamics performance of locomotive was researched through dynamic simulation. Results show that the longitudinal coupler press force afforded by large rotation angle coupler with coupler shoulder is larger than that of small rotation angle coupler...|$|R
