For example, the homotheticity assumption can be readily established with the polar coordinate system, the concavity restriction with the Muntz-Sartz series, the convexity restriction with the polynomial series, the orthogonality of regression functions with the orthonormal bases expansion, and the covariance stationary process with the Fourier series expansion. To describe a <b>backward-bending</b> <b>curve,</b> the radial regression can be defined and utilized. Thus, many economic assumptions and desired properties have their own corresponding coordinate representation systems. ...|$|E

The predominant early view [e. g. Ruttan and Binswanger (1978); Johnston and Cownie (1969) ] was that this pattern might apply to all contemporary Asia. Ishikawa himself was less optimistic about this and recent studies [Alauddin and Tisdell (1989 a); Jayasuriya and Shand (1986) ] support Ishikawa 2 ̆ 7 s caution about generalizing the East Asian experience.

2500|$|In economics, a <b>backward-bending</b> supply <b>curve</b> of labour, or <b>backward-bending</b> {{labour supply}} <b>curve,</b> is a {{graphical}} device showing {{a situation in}} which as real, or inflation-corrected, wages increase beyond a certain level, people will substitute leisure (non-paid time) for paid worktime and so higher wages lead to a decrease in the labour supply and so less labour-time being offered for sale.|$|R

40|$|We must {{therefore}} expect that a directed fishery on this small gadoid (landings in the Northeast Atlantic are about 3 3 105 t year 21) {{will have a}} positive effect on the euphausiids, which in turn prey on copep-ods, a much more important food source for commercial fish species than euphausiids. Hence, fishing for Norway pout may have a cascading effect, leading to a build-up of nonutilized euphausiids. Triangles such as the one involving Norway pout, euphausi-ids, and copepods, and which may have a major effect on ecosystem stability, are in-creasingly being integrated in ecological theory (21), especially in fisheries biology (22). Globally, trophic levels of fisheries land-ings appear to have declined in recent de-cades at a rate of about 0. 1 per decade, without the landings themselves increasing substantially. It is likely that continuation of present trends will lead to widespread fisheries collapses and to more <b>backward-bending</b> <b>curves</b> such as in Fig. 5, whether or not they are due to a relaxation of top-down control (23). Therefore, we consider esti-mations of global potentials based on ex-trapolation of present trends or explicitly incorporating fishing-down-the-food-web strategies to be highly questionable. Also, we suggest that in the next decades fisheries management will have to emphasize the rebuilding of fish populations embedded within functional food webs, within large “no-take ” marine protected areas (24) ...|$|R

Previous experiments have demonstrated that the Marshallian model works in the forward-falling case. Thus, which theory of dynamics is appropriate for a market depends on the underlying reasons for demand and supply shapes...|$|R

The intrinsic utility of being an active reindeer herder {{plays an important role}} in determining supply. Results show this can lead to unconventional supply responses among pastoralists, and suggest that the probability of a backward-bending supply response increases with stock size. Further analyses confirm that reindeer herders with <b>backward-bending</b> supply <b>curves</b> have significantly larger herds than herders with conventional supply responses. Relaxed externalities from forestry would cause most herders to increase their slaughter. backward-bending supply, externalities, pastoralist, reindeer husbandry, Livestock Production/Industries,...|$|R
40|$|The {{conventional}} NAIRU model {{stipulates that}} any existing money illusion would vanish by {{the passage of}} time. In contrast, the model developed by Akerlof, Dickens and Perry (2000) (ADP) argues that inflation, instead of time, dissipate money illusion. Accordingly, there exists a possibility of an inflation unemployment tradeoff in the long run. This essay reviews the evidence of money illusion and the main criticism against the ADP-model. Furthermore, a reevaluation of the Swedish <b>backward-bending</b> Phillips <b>curve</b> derived by Lundborg and Sacklén (2006) is performed, using an updated dataset covering a longer time period with an inflation targeting regime. The results are inconclusive to whether the Phillips curve derived by Lundborg and Sacklén hold in the new tim...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} some of the {{features}} of static models of road traffic congestion that have caused much debate in the literature. It first focuses on the difficulties arising with the <b>backward-bending</b> cost <b>curve</b> defined over traffic flows in the context of `continuous congestion'. The relevance of the backward-bending segment of this curve is questioned by demonstrating that the `equilibria' on this segment of the cost curve are dynamically infeasible. Next, the implications for static models of `peak congestion' are considered. In doing so, attention is paid also to the implicit assumptions, particularly on the nature of scheduling costs, that are necessary to render static models of peak congestion internally consistent. The paper ends with a brief discussion of the implications for dynamic models of peak congestion. ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{discusses}} {{and estimates}} the <b>backward-bending</b> supply <b>curve,</b> using data {{for three years}} over a six-year time span from the inshore purse seine fishery in Khanh Hoa province, Vietnam. Four different models are developed for estimation based on fisheries data, {{in the absence of}} stock survey data. The estimated maximum sustainable yield for the anchovy in south-central Vietnam ranges from 138 thousand tons to 293 thousand tons. The results reveal that the anchovy stock to some extent is biologically over-exploited, but seems to have rebuilt in recent years. For management it makes sense to use available, cheaply collected fisheries data on harvests, prices and costs, if biological surveys are lacking, which is often the case due to the cost of establishing expensive research capacities and time series...|$|R
40|$|This paper, {{written for}} a conference of the Society for Economic Research on Copyright Issues, explores the history of {{copyright}} protection for musical compositions. The first modern copyright law did not cover musical works. The role of Johann Christian Bach, Ludwig van Beethoven, and Johann Neopmuk Hummel in securing legal changes is traced. How Giuseppe Verdi exploited the new copyright law in Northern Italy is analyzed. The paper argues that Verdi, enriched by copyright protection, reduced his compositional effort along a <b>backward-bending</b> supply <b>curve.</b> However, his good fortune {{may have had a}} demonstration effect inducing other talented individuals to become composers. An attempt to determine the impact of legal changes on entry into composing is inconclusive. The paper shows, however, that a golden age of musical composition nevertheless occurred in nations that lacked copyright protection for musical works. ...|$|R

Optimal fishery management with logistic fish population growth implies a <b>backward-bending,</b> discounted supply <b>curve</b> for bioeconomic equilibrium sustained yield. Higher discount rates bend supply backward more to generate multiple steady-state rational expectations equilibria. Under bounded rationality, adaptive learning of a linear forecasting rule generates steady-state, two-cycle {{as well as}} chaotic consistent expectations equilibria, which are self-fulfilling in sample average and autocorrelations. The possibility of learning to believe in chaos is robust and even enhanced by dynamic noise. ...|$|R
40|$|While {{there is}} a large {{literature}} investigating the response of treatment intensity to Medicare reimbursement differentials, there is much less work on this question for the Medicaid program. The answers for Medicare may not apply in the Medicaid context, since a smaller share of physician's patients will be Medicaid insured, so that income effects from fee changes may be dominated by substitution effects. We investigate the effect of Medicaid fee differentials on the use of cesarean delivery over the 1988 - 1992 period. We find, in contrast to the <b>backward-bending</b> supply <b>curve</b> implied by the Medicare literature larger fee differentials between cesarean and normal childbirth for the Medicaid program leads to higher cesarean delivery rates. In particular, we find that the lower fee differentials between cesarean and normal childbirth under the Medicaid program than under private insurance can explain between one-half and three-quarters of the difference between Medicaid and private cesarean delivery rates. Our results suggest that Medicaid reimbursement reductions can cause real reductions in the intensity with which Medicaid patients are treated. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the dynamics of}} a stochastic cobweb model with linear demand and a <b>backward-bending</b> supply <b>curve.</b> In our model, forward-looking expectations and backward-looking ones are assumed, in fact {{we assume that the}} representative agent chooses the backward predictor with probability _,__ 0 __ 1, and the forward predictor with probability (1 −), so that the expected price at time is a random variable and consequently the dynamics describing the price evolution in time is governed by a stochastic dynamical system. The dynamical system becomes a Markov process when the memory rate vanishes. In particular, we study the Markov chain in the cases of discrete and continuous time. Using a mixture of analytical tools and numerical methods, we show that, when prices take discrete values, the corresponding Markov chain is asymptotically stable. In the case with continuous prices and nonnecessarily zero memory rate, numerical evidence of bounded price oscillations is shown. The role of the memory rate is studied through numerical experiments, this study confirms the stabilizing effects of the presence of resistant memory...|$|R
40|$|Although the {{standard}} neoclassical model of female labour supply behaviour usually {{allows for the}} impact of demographic changes on value of female time in the household, the complexities of the tax and benefit system, and the influence of saving and borrowing on current period decisions, it does not allow for the possibility of involuntary unemployment. Women who are not working, that is, those who supply zero hours of labour, are assumed to do so voluntarily; the model does not allow for women who are not currently in employment and wanting to work but unable to obtain employment. This paper is an attempt to gauge how much the conclusions derived from {{the standard}} analysis of labour supply may have to be altered when we allow for such 'unemployed' workers. For the sample of married women in the UK which we investigate, the standard model appears to exaggerate the positive impact which reductions in marginal wages may have on participation and reduces the possibilities for a <b>backward-bending</b> supply <b>curve</b> of labour. The probability of being in a state of unemployment, as defined above, is found to depend on certain demand-side factors, age {{and a number of other}} demographic characteristics.

40|$|The {{effects of}} an {{increase}} in an emission tax rate are analyzed. The initial tax mix of the economy is such that the higher emission rate serves to internalize social costs an simultaneously approaches a second-best tax system (in the absence of environmental distortions). It is shown that this kind of tax system {{as a starting point for}} an environmental tax reform is not sufficient to reap a clear-cut double dividend even though "unnormal" cases like a <b>backward-bending</b> labor supply <b>curve</b> and adverse revenue effects are excluded. In particular, if the wage elasticity of labor supply is positive and the tax on the clean good is relatively high compared to the tax on the dirty good an environmental tax reform may lead to an "ecological paradox", i. e. increases the demand for the dirty good because the income effects caused by the decrease of the tax rate on the clean consumption good dominate both the substitution effects of the tax rate changes and the income effect of the increased emission tax rate. Hence, there may be no environmental dividend...|$|R
40|$|I use panel {{data from}} a unique field {{experiment}} to estimate the wage elasticity of working in the day labor market in rural Malawi. Once a week for 12 consecutive weeks, I make job offers to a pre-defined sample of 529 adults. The wage varies each week, ranging from MK 30 ($US 0. 21) to MK 140 ($US 1. 00) for a day’s work. This approach provides exogenous variation in wages, allows me to observe the full distribution of wage offers rather than the censored distribution of accepted wages, and permits the inclusion of time and village or time and individual fixed effects. I estimate that the elasticity of employment is between 0. 15 and 0. 17, with {{no significant differences between}} men and women. I use auxiliary {{data from a}} nationally representative survey to confirm that equal elasticities for men and women is typical of the Malawian labor market during the agricultural off-season, {{the time of year when}} my experiment takes place. I collapse my data into a censored cross section that mimics data used in the previous literature to demonstrate that my low point estimates of the elasticity employment are due to my improved identification strategy, rather than reflecting inherent differences between Malawi and other developing countries.

40|$|Taking {{into account}} Kuznet’s hypothesis, {{considers}} the general {{relationship between the}} evolution and extension of market systems and the incidence of poverty and economic inequality. It suggests that a re-evaluation of the Kuznet’s curve is needed because income inequality has been rising in many countries, with growing economic liberalisation, expansion of globalisation and greater reliance on markets. Nevertheless, societies that experience a rapid transition from traditional, centrally controlled, or social welfare economic systems to market-based ones often experience a substantial rise in their incidence of poverty and income inequality, at least initially. Some {{of the reasons for}} this and the processes mentioned are outlined. The recent upward trend in economic inequality, particularly in more developed countries, seems to have a different genesis to the initial phase of rising inequality indicated by the Kuznet’s curve. Its basis seems to be the combined effect of the growing importance of inequality in human capital, especially resulting from educational differences, and market extension. The increased adoption of the user-pays approach to education could magnify social stratification and cement social inequalities. The essay concludes with a discussion of ethical issues. These issues include whether or not the payments of income based upon market competition are just, arguments for redistribution of income such as those of some utilitarians and of Rawls, and the relevance of critiques of these redistribution proposals, especially as they apply to the poor. Critiques include that of Richard Musgrave, and those based on the assumption on that the poor have a high preference for leisure, exhibit <b>backward-bending</b> labour supply <b>curves</b> at very low levels of income, and are likely to spend their extra income on non-essential commodities, such as gambling and alcohol, expenditure disapproved of by many in society when the poor engage in it. Some consideration is also given to A K Sen’s view that lack of social entitlements is a major source of poverty...|$|R
