5000|$|Scienceman then defined transformity as,"a {{quantitative}} variable describing the measurable property of {{a form of}} energy, its ability to amplify as feedback, relative to the source energy consumed in its formation, under maximum power conditions. As a {{quantitative variable}} analogous to thermodynamic temperature, transformity requires specification of units." [...] (1987, p. 261. My emphasis).In 1996 H.T.Odum defined transformity as,"the emergy of one type required to make a unit of energy of another type. For example, since 3 coal emjoules (cej) of coal and 1 cej of services are required to generate 1 J of electricity, the coal transformity of electricity is 4 cej/J"G.P.Genoni expanded on this definition and maintained that, [...] "the energy input of one kind required to sustain one unit of energy of another kind, is used to quantify hierarchical position" [...] (1997, p. 97). According to Scienceman, the concept of transformity introduces a new <b>basic</b> <b>dimension</b> into physics (1987, p. 261). However there is ambiguity in the dimensional analysis of transformity as Bastianoni et al. (2007) state that transformity is a dimensionless ratio.|$|E
50|$|The Sustainable Process Index (SPI*) was {{developed}} in the 1990s at TU Graz by a team of scientists (substantially by Ch. Krotscheck) under the leadership of professor Michael Narodoslawsky.The SPI {{is a member of the}} ecological footprint family which aggregates and compares different ecological pressures. It allows to evaluate ecologic impacts of industrial products and services like energy production, industrial products, agriculture and buildings. It provides an encompassing evaluation that distinguishes sharply between fossil and renewable energy (as Global Warming Potential does) but taking other emissions to soil water and atmosphere into account as well. Based on the idea, that the primary income of the earth is Solar radiation, in accordance with the principle of Strong sustainability the surface of the earth is the <b>basic</b> <b>dimension</b> of the evaluation. The SPI is therefore in the same family of ecological measurement as the Ecological Footprint. These methods all measure the area that is necessary to support human activities.The SPI takes the whole life cycle into consideration starting from mining of raw materials to further transformation and production of goods to recycling to disposal of waste. This includes grey emissions, the emissions which originate from production and operation of infrastructures.The SPI method is based on the comparison of natural material fluxes with technological material fluxes. The conversion of mass and energy fluxes is strongly defined by two principles of Sustainability.|$|E

40|$|One {{critical}} component of understanding another’s mind is the perception of “life” in a face. However, {{little is known about}} the cognitive and neural mechanisms underlying this perception of animacy. Here, using a visual adaptation paradigm, we ask whether face animacy is (1) a <b>basic</b> <b>dimension</b> of face perception and (2) supported by a common neural mechanism across distinct face categories defined by age and species. Observers rated the perceived animacy of adult human faces before and after adaptation to (1) adult faces, (2) child faces, and (3) dog faces. When testing the perception of animacy in human faces, we found significant adaptation to both adult and child faces, but not dog faces. We did, however, find significant adaptation when morphed dog images and dog adaptors were used. Thus, animacy perception in faces appears to be a <b>basic</b> <b>dimension</b> of face perception that is species specific but not constrained by age categories. Simons Foundatio...|$|E

40|$|The Human Poverty Index (HPI) is a {{composite}} index of poverty that focuses on deprivations in human lives, aimed at measuring poverty as a failure in capabilities in multiple dimensions, {{in contrast to the}} conventional headcount measure focused on low incomes. The HPI was introduced in the United Nations Development Programme Human Development Report 1997 and concentrates on deprivations in <b>basic</b> <b>dimensions</b> of life. This paper develops an axiomatic characterization of a family of global deprivation indices using an arbitrary number of dimensions of human life. When we consider only the three <b>basic</b> <b>dimensions,</b> a member of this family becomes ordinally equivalent to HPI. The general index allows the calculation of percentage contributions of deprivations in different dimensions, and hence to identify the dimensions whose failures affect the overall deprivation more. This is important from a policy perspective. We also provide an empirical illustration of the characterized indices using cross-country data for the three <b>basic</b> <b>dimensions</b> and the anthropometric indicators birth weight, height for age and nourishment.

40|$|Agency is—besides communion—a <b>basic</b> <b>dimension</b> of traits. It can be {{specifically}} {{linked to}} behavioral outcomes, to status, mastery, self-esteem and to success. The present paper analyzes the situational malleability of agency. Two studies tested whether an individual’s agency (but not communion) is situationally {{influenced by the}} experience of success versus failure at a task, as well as whether this effect {{is the same for}} men and women. Supporting our hypotheses, the induction of success versus failure experiences led to changes in agency that were independent of actual performance, independent of type of task (memorizing vs. face recognition), independent of induction methodology (easy vs. difficult task vs. manipulated performance feedback), and independent of self-esteem, initial level of agency and of the participants ’ gender. Communion was not influenced by this kind of experience. Implications for both the <b>basic</b> <b>dimension</b> of agency and for theories on gender and gender stereotypes are discussed. Copyright # 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Agency and communion are fundamental dimensions of traits and person descriptors.

A simple Hinich-Ordeshook spatial theory of voting is used to model Converse's fundamental insight that individuals' positions on issues are bundled together, and the knowledge {{of one or two}} issue positions makes the remaining positions very predictable. The model assumes that individuals' positions on a set issue or attribute dimensions are determined by the individuals' positions on a small number of underlying evaluative or <b>basic</b> <b>dimensions.</b> The procedure developed in this paper for estimating these <b>basic</b> <b>dimensions</b> is, in effect, a method of performing singular value decomposition of a matrix with missing elements. Monte Carlo testing shows that the procedure reliably reproduces the missing elements. Because of this reliability, the estimation procedure can be used to produce Eckart-Young matrix lower rank approximations. A number of applications to political data are [...] ...|$|R
