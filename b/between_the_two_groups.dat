5|$|By {{broadcasting}} {{accusations of}} communism among Fretilin leaders and sowing discord in the UDT coalition, the Indonesian government fostered instability in East Timor and, observers said, created {{a pretext for}} invading.

5|$|Although his {{original}} objective was solely {{to protect the}} Serb population against the Ustaše, Dangić quickly became {{an important factor in}} the conflict <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>groups</b> in eastern Bosnia. The Germans sought to win Dangić over to collaboration in order to strengthen anti-Partisan operations in the region, where Dangić's Chetniks reportedly numbered about 10,000 men, but at this time neither Dangić nor any of Mihailović's other commanders had any arrangement with the Germans.|$|E
5|$|During the 1950s {{when the}} Belgians began {{to fear that}} {{the rise of a}} {{powerful}} Luba elite would become a threat to colonial rule, the administration began to support Lulua organisations. This further contributed to the growing ethnic polarisation <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>groups.</b> In 1952, an organisation called the Lulua Frères (Lulua Brothers) was established to campaign for socio-economic advancement of the Lulua group and became an unofficial representative of the Bena Lulua.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} Graz agreement, {{negotiated}} by Bosnian Serbs and Bosnian Croats aiming to partition Bosnia and Herzegovina in early May, proclaimed {{cessation of hostilities}} <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>groups,</b> heavy fighting broke out between the HVO and the VRS in June, in eastern Herzegovina (Operation Jackal), and in the Sava River basin (Operation Corridor 92), {{in the north of}} Bosnia and Herzegovina.|$|E

5|$|The Communist Party USA was {{routinely}} harassed and {{oppressed by}} government officials, leading {{it to be}} the primary client of the ACLU. The Communists were very aggressive in their tactics, often engaging in illegal or unethical conduct, and this led to frequent conflicts between the Communists and ACLU. Communist leaders often attacked the ACLU, particularly when the ACLU defended the free speech rights of conservatives. This uneasy relationship <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>groups</b> continued for decades.|$|E
50|$|The {{knockout}} {{stage of}} the 1995 King Fahd Cup was played on 13 January 1995 and included a third-place match <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>group</b> runners-up and a final match between group winners. Both games were played at King Fahd II Stadium in Riyadh.|$|R

5|$|The Russian {{scientists}} {{proposed the}} name kurchatovium and the American scientists suggested the name rutherfordium {{for the new}} element. In 1992, the IUPAC/IUPAP Transfermium Working Group (TWG) assessed the claims of discovery and concluded that both teams provided contemporaneous evidence to the synthesis of element 104 and that credit should be shared <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>groups.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Social Credit Party was {{weakened}} by considerable conflict between its {{organizations in the}} two provinces it controlled, Alberta and British Columbia.

5|$|The {{greatest}} {{period of}} castle building in Spain {{was in the}} 11th to 13thcenturies, and they were most commonly found in the disputed borders between Christian and Muslim lands. Conflict and interaction <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>groups</b> led to an exchange of architectural ideas, and Spanish Christians adopted the use of detached towers. The Spanish Reconquista, driving the Muslims out of the Iberian Peninsula, was complete in 1492.|$|E
30|$|Fever was {{the most}} common adverse event {{associated}} with surgery, with no difference in frequency <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>group</b> (six patients in the treatment group, six in the control group).

50|$|In {{the second}} stage, <b>the</b> <b>two</b> best-placed teams from each first-stage series were divided in <b>two</b> <b>groups</b> of eight teams, again {{according}} to geographic proximity, with home-and-away matches. <b>The</b> <b>two</b> <b>group</b> winners, plus <b>the</b> {{winner of a}} two-legged play-off <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>group</b> runners-up, secured promotion to the LigaPro.

5|$|A {{large part}} of the team's support base {{consists}} of fans of Hajduk Split and Dinamo Zagreb, the two best-supported clubs in the Croatian domestic league, the Prva HNL. The clubs' ultra-style supporter groups, the Bad Blue Boys of Zagreb and The Torcida from Split, have both been associated with hooliganism, though violence <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>groups</b> does not usually occur at international games. Heavy support for the Croatian national team also comes from Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina, particularly from fans of Zrinjski Mostar. The official Croatia supporters' club endorsed by the Croatian Football Federation is called Uvijek Vjerni (Always Faithful).|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} blackmouth {{catshark}} (Galeus melastomus) and the Portuguese dogfish (Centroscymnus coelolepis), the velvet belly {{is one of}} the most abundant deep-sea sharks in the northeastern Atlantic. It is found individually or in small shoals. Samplings in the Mediterranean have found females outnumbering males across all ages; this imbalance increases in the older age classes. In the Rockall Trough and the Catalan Sea, large adults are found in deeper waters than juveniles, which may serve to reduce competition <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>groups.</b> However, this pattern has not been observed at other sites in the eastern Mediterranean.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 1941, {{there were}} six Partisan {{detachments}} in eastern Bosnia, with about 7,300 fighters operating in the Majevica, Ozren, Birač, Romanija, Zvijezda and Kalinovik areas. According to Enver Redžić, in early January 1942, the Chetniks controlled {{a large portion of}} eastern Bosnia, including the towns of Zvornik, Višegrad, Vlasenica, Srebrenica, Drinjača, Bratunac, Foča, Ustikolina, Goražde and Čajniče. Due to continuing cooperation <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>groups,</b> the Chetniks also shared control of the towns of Rogatica, Olovo and Han Pijesak with the Partisans.|$|E
50|$|After this season, {{the league}} was split into a Württemberg and a Baden group, the first having nine {{and the second}} eight teams.

5|$|Brachiopods are shelled {{marine organisms}} that superficially resembled {{bivalves}} {{in that they}} are of similar size and have a hinged shell in two parts. However, brachiopods evolved from a very different ancestral line, and the resemblance to bivalves only arose because of a similar lifestyle. The differences <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>groups</b> are due to their separate ancestral origins. Different initial structures have been adapted to solve the same problems, a case of convergent evolution. In modern times, brachiopods are not as common as bivalves.|$|E
5|$|Dale Russell {{hypothesized}} that the more lightly built and more common Gorgosaurus may have preyed on the abundant hadrosaurs of the time, while the more robust and less common Daspletosaurus may have specialized on the less prevalent but better-defended ceratopsids, {{which may have been}} more difficult to hunt. However, a specimen of Daspletosaurus (OTM 200) from the Two Medicine Formation preserves the digested remains of a juvenile hadrosaur in its gut region. The higher and broader muzzles of tyrannosaurines like Daspletosaurus are mechanically stronger than the lower snouts of albertosaurines like Gorgosaurus, although tooth strengths are similar <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>groups.</b> This may indicate a difference in feeding mechanics or diet.|$|E
5|$|In 1686, Seringapatam, {{the capital}} of the Kingdom of Mysore, had a {{community}} of more than 400 Catholics. The community was severely harassed in the following two decades, with the churches destroyed and the priest's house confiscated. The destruction was undertaken under the name of the Wodeyar king, Kanthirava Narasaraja I, by his finance minister. The priest's house was returned to the church in 1709. Relations between the Wodeyars and the Mangalorean Catholics improved until 1717, when there was an anti-Christian outburst. The resident priest was expelled and forbidden to preach. Several more anti-Christian outbursts followed. By 1736, there were better relations <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>groups.</b>|$|E
