I'm not so sure it changed for the better, by the way. But it did change the way we think and look at hockey in this country." ...|$|E

Following the events of September 11, Jackson rewrote [...] "What More Can I Give" [...] and expressed his views on the song, writing and music. [...] "I'm not one to sit <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>say,</b> 'Oh, I feel bad for what happened to them I want the whole world to sing , to bring us together as a world, because a song is a mantra, something you repeat over and over.

500|$|A {{supporter}} of the LGBT movement, Nelson published in 2006 through iTunes a version of Ned Sublette's [...] "Cowboys Are Frequently, Secretly Fond of Each Other", that met instant success. During an interview with Texas Monthly in 2013, regarding the Defense of Marriage Act and Same-sex marriage in the United States, Nelson responded to a comparison the interviewer made with the Civil Rights Movement, stating: [...] "We'll look <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>say</b> it was crazy that we ever even argued about this". He also presented two logos with the pink equal sign, symbol of the LBGT movement. The first one, featured the sign represented with two long braids; while the second one, featured the sign represented with two marijuana cigarettes. The use of the logos became viral instantly in social networking sites such as Twitter and Facebook.|$|E
500|$|At {{approximately}} 7:20 pm on Friday, September 19, 2014, Gonzalez scaled {{the iron}} perimeter fence of the White House. Several agents pursued him, {{as he ran}} directly towards the North Portico doors, which were unlocked. President Barack Obama and his daughters had just left the White House and were heading to Camp David {{at the time of}} the incident. Michelle Obama was also not home, having travelled to the retreat earlier. Agents stated they chose not to shoot at Gonzalez as he did not have a weapon in his hands, and was not wearing clothing that could conceal a significant amount of explosives; the possibility of accidentally hitting civilians beyond the fence was also cited. A senior official stated: [...] "A lot of people want to judge the Secret Service for not shooting, but [...] number of things have to be considered in this situation, including whether or not the principal is in the residence" [...] adding, [...] "given what's emerged about [...] since the arrest, maybe we'll look <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>say</b> the Secret Service played a role in saving his life." ...|$|E
500|$|Code: Veronica {{producer}} Shinji Mikami said [...] "Claire {{became a}} lot tougher than I Imagined. I thought she should look the same, but the game director made her that way because she had such an experience in Resident Evil 2, she could handle any situation now!" [...] For Revelations 2, the now hardened and aggressive Claire was redesigned to be a contrasting character to the young, immature and easily scared Moira Burton, who {{was defined as a}} purely supporting character, and they both serve different roles in the story and have different functions. Producer Michiteru Okabe said: [...] "Really, only after did we look <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>say,</b> 'Oh, I guess they are both girls.' Which is good, because it means we’re treating them as whole characters and not just as their gender. What we settled on is the idea that you have different roles -- it isn’t two against the world, it’s one against the world with a helper." [...] Okabe also said the game's writer Dai Satō [...] "is a big fan of her personally" [...] {{which was one of the}} factors that led to Claire's return.|$|E

500|$|Actress Jolene Blalock (T'Pol) {{criticized the}} early stories as boring and lacking {{intriguing}} content. She felt that early Enterprise scripts ignored basic tenets of Star Trek chronology, and offered [...] "revealing costumes instead of character development". UPN executives {{stated that the}} male-oriented episodes of Enterprise did not mesh with the viewership of its other top shows, such as Top Model and Veronica Mars. Brannon Braga suggested {{that the reason for}} the cancellation was viewer fatigue, noting that [...] "after 18 years and 624 hours of Star Trek, the audience began to {{have a little bit of}} overkill." [...] Fans, meanwhile, criticized Berman and Braga for ignoring Star Trek canon and refusing to fix their shows. Michael Hinman, news coordinator for SyFy Portal, stated that in addition to the oversaturation of Star Trek, there [...] "also is an oversaturation of Braga and Berman. [...] They couldn't sit <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>say,</b> 'You know, we just can't keep this fresh.' No, it was more about their stupid egos, and their nonsensical 'Even if it's broke, don't fix it' attitude." [...] Braga defended the series, noting that The Next Generation faced little competition from other science fiction shows, while Enterprise had to contend with a plethora of shows such as Battlestar Galactica.|$|E
500|$|The {{production}} of Black Ice was delayed for several reasons. AC/DC left their label Atlantic Records, {{signed a deal}} with Sony Music and changed labels within Sony from Epic Records to Columbia Records. Bass guitarist Cliff Williams suffered an injury to his hand in 2005 {{and was unable to}} play for 18 months. While Williams was recovering, the Young brothers perfected the songs they had written. Angus revealed that there was no pressure from Sony for the band to release a new album, as the label was releasing DVDs and remasters of the AC/DC catalogue, and thus the group [...] "could afford to sit <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>say</b> we'll do another album when we think we've got all the goods." [...] In a 2004 interview, vocalist Brian Johnson said that Angus had written harder riffs than those on Stiff Upper Lip and that he would be writing song lyrics {{for the first time since}} the band's 1988 album Blow Up Your Video, but his input would end up minimal, with all tracks on Black Ice credited to the Youngs. Johnson explained that the brothers had done most of the lyrical job, and his collaboration was that he [...] "helped with melody and just filling in gaps that I thought needed filling in".|$|E
500|$|... "Movin' Down the Line", an ode to a love unrequited, {{features}} mellow horns, jangling guitar, heavy bass lines, and a swelling {{string and}} piano conclusion. In {{the opinion of}} Lloyd Bradley, the song exemplifies the album's combination of traditional styles and contemporary production: [...] "It has every bit of digital snap needed to succeed among today’s sounds; but Saadiq's masterful use of a big brass section lurking w-a-a-ay into the background picks the tune up and puts it down {{in a completely different}} era. The song turns out both laidback and urgent at the same time, and is utterly irrepressible for it". Containing a psychedelic funk sound, [...] "Just Don't" [...] is sung {{from the point of view}} of a dejected narrator as realizes his woman has moved on from him. The song features guest vocals by Yukimi Nagano and an extended Moog solo played [...] by Larry Dunn. [...] "Good Man" [...] contains plaintive lyrics, a hook co-written and sung by vocalist Taura Stinson, and lyrics about a man mourning his partner's unfaithfulness. The album's closing track, [...] "The Answer", features a wistful, jazz-funk sound, and lyrics expressing a call for collective and individual responsibility. Saadiq said, [...] "I always have a song similar to that on my albums. I was just thinking about growing up in Oakland and all the older people and mentors who helped me out at the time. So I just wanted to throw it <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>say</b> thank you, and tell all the kids out there to listen to the people trying to guide them".|$|E

500|$|Soon after, UMNO backbencher Mahathir bin Mohamad {{attacked}} Lee in Parliament: [...] " [...] {{have never}} known Malay rule and cannot bear {{the idea that the}} people they have so long kept under their heels should now {{be in a position to}} rule them." [...] Lee responded with an unscripted speech made entirely in Malay opposing the government's pro-Malay policies: [...] "Of course there are Chinese millionaires in big cars and big houses. Is it the answer to make a few Malay millionaires with big cars and big houses? ... If we delude people into believing that they are poor because there are no Malay rights or because opposition members oppose Malay rights, where are we going to end up? You let people in the villages believe that they are poor because we don't speak Malay, because the government does not write in Malay, so he expects a miracle to take place [...] The moment we all start speaking Malay, he is going to have an uplift in the standard of living, and if doesn't happen, what happens then? Meanwhile, whenever there is a failure of economic, social and educational policies, you come <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>say,</b> oh, these wicked Chinese, Indian and others opposing Malay rights. They don't oppose Malay rights. They, the Malay, have the right as Malaysian citizens to go up to the level of training and education that the more competitive societies, the non-Malay society, has produced.

2500|$|In Kibbutz life, group {{pressure}} to conform is particularly strong.

Bruno Bettelheim had predicted that kibbutz education would yield mediocrity: [...] " [...] will not be leaders or philosophers, will not achieve anything in science or art."
