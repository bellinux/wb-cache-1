5|$|An {{additional}} development which reduced Gill Sans' dominance was {{the arrival}} of phototypesetting, which allowed typefaces to be printed from photographs on film and (especially in display use – hot metal continued for some body text setting for longer) massively increased the range of typefaces that could cheaply be used. Dry transfers like Letraset had a similar effect for smaller projects; their sans-serif Compacta and Stephenson Blake's Impact exemplified the design trends of the period by choosing dense, industrial designs. Of the period from the 1930s to 1950s, {{when he was growing}} up, James Mosley would later write: The Monotype classics dominated the typographical landscape... in Britain, at any rate, they were so ubiquitous that, while their excellent quality was undeniable, it was possible to be bored by them and to begin to rebel against the bland good taste that they represented. In fact we were already aware by 1960 that they might not be around to bore us for too long. The death of metal type... seemed at last to <b>be</b> <b>happening.</b>|$|E

500|$|Pesticides used on {{bee forage}} {{are far more}} likely to enter the colony by the pollen stores rather than [...] nectar (because pollen is carried {{externally}} on the bees, while nectar is carried internally, and may kill the bee if too toxic), though not all potentially lethal chemicals, either natural or man-made, affect the adult bees; many primarily affect the brood, but brood die-off does not appear to <b>be</b> <b>happening</b> in CCD. Most significantly, brood are not fed honey, and adult bees consume relatively little pollen; accordingly, the pattern in CCD suggests, if contaminants or toxins from the environment 'are' responsible, it is most likely to be via the honey, as the adults are dying (or leaving), not the brood (though possibly effects of contaminated pollen consumed by juveniles may only show after they have developed into adults).|$|E

500|$|Hasbro withdrew its £5.5m {{advertising}} {{support for the}} Sindy doll in 1997 amid rumours that major retailers were planning to delist the doll. The editor of UK Toy News, Jon Salisbury, said, [...] "This is Hasbro taking Sindy out of its main range. But she is running so far behind Barbie it is almost a non-issue. If delisted by bigger retailers, which seems to <b>be</b> <b>happening,</b> then the brand will lose momentum". In 1994, Sindy had a seven {{percent share of the}} £70m doll market, and Barbie held 16%. By 1996, Barbie's share had increased to 30%, estimated by Mattel to be worth £100m per year including licensing deals, and Sindy's share had only climbed to eight percent. Sindy's popularity had also been overtaken during that period by Polly Pocket. One explanation for the large variation in market share is the unpopular Americanisation of the Sindy doll in the mid-1980s. The Sindy doll was still available to retailers during this period, but had to be ordered in bulk from the Hong Kong manufacturer.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{progresses}} mostly through footage streamed from a fixed {{camera in}} booth {{nine of the}} call centre setting. Streams from other cameras are displayed {{on the side of}} the screen, in the style of a CCTV feed. The idea was inspired by a clip of a serial killer's interview with the CIA which Shearsmith had seen online; this, too, had a main feed with three smaller feeds giving different views of the scene. The writers felt that the multiple screens both served a narrative function and raised the tension. For much of the episode, viewers simply watch characters taking calls. Extras are seen moving back and forth in the smaller screens, with Pemberton having initially been keen for things to <b>be</b> <b>happening</b> away from the main feed. However, he was somewhat frustrated with the result, with the same extra moving on numerous occasions throughout the episode. Shearsmith felt that a whole series filmed in the same manner [...] "would be a bit wearing on the eye", but that the style could be used for a single episode.|$|E

30|$|Theory can be {{considered}} as a light on social reality – illuminating what <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> and providing a rationale for understanding why it <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> (Tobin 2008). Since theory can address such questions it is a tool for interpretive researchers to seek to understand social life, from the perspectives of participants. The role of an interpretive researcher is to find out from participants what <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> and the rationale for what <b>is</b> <b>happening.</b> A theoretical framework illuminates social reality, but it only shows what the theory is capable of showing. Different theories can provide different landscapes for what <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> and why it <b>is</b> <b>happening.</b> For example, theories about expressed emotions might give interesting accounts of facial expression of emotion, emotions represented by prosody, and use of gestures when emotions become excessive. However, as rich as these insights might prove to be they will be silent about more issues than they illuminate. As theories illuminate so they obscure. How do people act to restore harmony in their bodies when their blood oxygen is low, when pulse rate is high, or when body temperature rises? Narratives about mindfulness might be absent because participants are not aware that mindfulness is salient to what <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> – or they might not even know {{there is such a thing}} as mindfulness. Becoming aware of a particular theory that might have salience to what <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> and why it <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> affords seeing differently. Of course, if participants see differently there is a fresh stream of possibilities for action – depending on what they see and their value system in relation to what they see happening, they will act accordingly. That is, fresh ways of looking can expand action possibilities. Becoming aware of what participants previously were unaware of is a way of fracturing existing equilibria – akin to an intervention that can unsettle patterns of action in particular social settings. Ann Swidler (1986) noted that culture reveals itself in unsettled times – an insight that provides a rationale for interventions that expand theoretical repertoires, thereby enabling participants to reflexively engage with their lifeworlds – becoming aware of things they previously were unaware of, and making changes when and as they feel change is necessary.|$|R
500|$|The {{operation}} had two aims: {{creating the}} appearance of army units where none existed and concealing the real armour, artillery and matériel at the front. Barkas observed that [...] "the concealment of the huge assembly of the Armoured Corps was essentially a piece of military planning by Army Headquarters, with Camouflage carrying out certain specific tasks". Since {{it would be impossible}} to hide the existence of such a large number of vehicles, especially of tanks in the Martello area, Barkas planned instead to make the vehicles there quite obvious, as trucks, well before battle. The tanks, too, would be openly displayed, far behind the battle front. When the enemy saw that nothing seemed to <b>be</b> <b>happening,</b> the trucks would be replaced by tanks, masquerading as trucks. That meant that the tanks, too, would have to be seen not to move.so they would all be replaced with dummies. An unprecedented and [...] "formidable" [...] number of dummies were required: more than 400 tanks, 100 guns, and nearly 2000 soft-skinned vehicles.|$|E

I was very surprised and very happy when I got a phone call on Sunday to say that something could <b>be</b> <b>happening</b> here ... Dropping into League One isn't a worry for me because this is a club on the up and I didn't want to be stuck at Stoke just picking my money up because that isn't me" [...] On 18 June 2013, having made sufficient first-team appearances for Sheffield United, Higginbotham activated a clause in his contract to extend it for the following season.|$|E

We wanted it to feel like this could <b>be</b> <b>happening</b> 300 years ago but at the same time, there is a modern spin on all the action, characters and weaponry. It was a fun way to make a classical world feel fresh." [...] Wirkola said that he originally came with that idea in 2007 while studying film and television at Bond University in Australia, when he wanted to make it as just a short film, and that the film school director Simon Hunter advised him: [...] "Tom, don't ever speak of the idea again until you are in front of a Hollywood producer and I guarantee you will sell it." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{development}} team decided that, as with And Then There Were None, {{they would}} change Christie's original ending for Murder on the Orient Express. The {{aim of the}} developers was to create games that would not only appeal to casual gamers, but also to Christie fans. As nearly all Christie fans have read Murder on the Orient Express, and know the solution, and considering that the novel was to be included with the game, the developers decided that the ending needed to be changed. The novel has two solutions [...] one being what appears to <b>be</b> <b>happening</b> and the other being what is actually occurring [...] and the developers aimed to develop a third solution which drew on these two solutions and still surprised the player. Lee Sheldon admitted that his variation to the ending of And Then There Were None received some criticism, and said that in Murder on the Orient Express changing the ending was even harder because of the sheer fame {{of the book and}} its solution. He also expressed his hatred of adaptations of older material which make fun of that time period, and said {{that he was trying to}} stay as faithful to Christie's work and time era as possible.|$|E
500|$|Michell {{attempted}} {{to be as}} faithful to the novel as possible, in particular avoiding what he felt was the polished, artificial feel of other period dramas set in the 19th-century. The director explained, [...] "I was desperately {{trying to make it}} feel like it could <b>be</b> <b>happening</b> in the next room. I tried to make it something which is absolutely about real people and not about dressing or hairstyles or carpet". Consequently, because he felt the realistic look of the age would make the film more dramatic, Michell chose to depict the actors without make-up, and disallowed them from looking too hygienic. Root commented about the film's natural look in an interview, [...] "I basically didn't wear any makeup , and my hair was obviously set in a very unflattering way... I suppose the lighting was quite harsh, as well. None of us looked good". She said in a separate interview, [...] "I wanted to make Anne Elliot a somewhat plain woman who was not really miserable but had found a way to be content somehow, and yet emotions are buzzing around her all the time". Root believed the film's realistic depiction of the age was a key aspect of its appeal.|$|E

It's there to plant a favorable seed in children's minds." [...] Bunker criticized the promotional methods of the film—instead of granting interviews about the film to the press, John Travolta went on a book tour and signed copies of L. Ron Hubbard's novel. Bunker stated, [...] "When Michael Caine goes around to promote The Cider House Rules, he doesn't tour bookstores and sign copies of John Irving's novel… Through the movie tie-in with the book, kids will send in the card to get their free poster, and eventually be introduced to Dianetics." [...] Scientologist Nancy O'Meara, at the time treasurer of the Foundation for Religious Freedom and currently treasurer of the Scientology-run New Cult Awareness Network, responded to Bunker's statement: [...] "Gimme a break… That's like saying people are going to go see Gladiator and then suddenly find themselves wanting to explore Christianity." ...|$|E
