25|$|The <b>buttoning</b> of {{the jacket}} is {{primarily}} {{determined by the}} button stance, {{a measure of how}} high the buttons are in relation to the natural waist. In some (now unusual) styles where the buttons are placed high, the tailor would have intended the suit to be buttoned differently from the more common lower stance. Nevertheless, some general guidelines are given here.|$|E
25|$|Seinfeld {{began as}} a twenty-three-minute pilot titled The Seinfeld Chronicles. Created by Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David, {{developed}} by NBC executive Rick Ludwin, and produced by Castle Rock Entertainment, it was a mix of Seinfeld's stand-up comedy routines and idiosyncratic, conversational scenes focusing on mundane aspects of everyday life like laundry, the <b>buttoning</b> of the top button on one's shirt and the effort by men to properly interpret the intent of women spending the night in Seinfeld's apartment.|$|E
25|$|When {{fastening}} a three-button suit, {{the middle}} button is fastened, {{and the top}} one sometimes, but the bottom is traditionally not designed to be (although in the past some jackets were cut {{so that it could}} be fastened without distorting the drape; {{this is not the case}} with current clothing). A four-button suit is untraditional and so has no traditional guidelines on <b>buttoning,</b> but the middle ones at least should be fastened. Additionally, the one button suit has regained some popularity (it is also one of the classic styles of Savile Row tailoring). The button should always be fastened while standing.|$|E

25|$|As tailcoats evolved rapidly {{among the}} wealthy during the Regency period, various styles of closure saw popularity, from {{fastenings}} at the top, the middle, or even hanging open. The turn-down collar popular on earlier garments like the frock was succeeded by long lapels folded down to below the waist (fashionably tightly nipped in). Invariably, there were long rows of buttons down the front, {{most of which}} did not fasten; in fact even into the late Victorian era, all frock coats had a long row of button holes on the lapel, long since obsolete. As <b>buttoning</b> styles changed, the loosely folded front of the coat correspondingly shifted shape, and the V then formed by {{the meeting of the}} fold and the collar continues now in the traditional shape of notched and peaked lapels, both of which originate from that period.|$|E
25|$|Scene Two {{takes place}} two weeks later. It is midday, {{and the sun}} is scorching. Too hot to work, the mechanics, wearing {{sleeveless}} tank tops or stripped to their waists, laze around the garage and flirt with their girlfriends. Luca has taken Angelo under his wing and is teaching him how to fight. Unfortunately, Angelo shows little skill and continues to be the subject of the other mechanics' ridicule. Dino arrives, looking rather silly in a straw hat, Hawaiian shirt, Bermudas, and socks and sandals. Taking his briefcase, he leaves for a trip. Luca begins flirting with Lana, who is kneading dough for bread, and mutual seduction ensues. The mechanics and their partners also begin behaving lustily with increasing intensity. Lana leads Luca into her apartment with Dino above Dino's office. They make love, and Luca subsequently emerges dressed only in his underwear and an unbuttoned shirt, smoking a cigarette. He then re-enters the apartment and returns to Lana. Other couples lounge around the garage floor, apparently in post-coital bliss. Dino returns from his trip, and chases his workers and their friends away. He sees Lana through the apartment window and thinks she is waving at him, not realizing she is again making love to Luca with her hand pressed to the window. Dino ascends the metal staircase leading to the apartment, but trips and makes a clattering noise. Lana and Luca realize that Dino has returned. Just as Dino enters the apartment, Luca leaves by throwing his clothes out of another window and climbing down a fire escape. He dresses, but discovers that one of his boots is missing. Fortunately, Lana tosses the boot out of the window. Luca puts it on and walks away quickly. Angelo observes and follows him. Next, we see a car in the garage shaking as two people engage in sexual intercourse within. Luca emerges, <b>buttoning</b> his trousers, followed – unexpectedly – by Angelo. The expression on Angelo's face indicates he has fallen in love with Luca, and in parallel solos, both Lana and Angelo express joyous ecstasy at having encountered Luca that night.|$|E
500|$|He was {{regarded}} worldwide as an arbiter of men's fashions. He made wearing tweed, Homburg hats and Norfolk jackets fashionable, and popularised {{the wearing of}} black ties with dinner jackets, instead of white tie and tails. He pioneered the pressing of trouser legs {{from side to side}} in preference to the now normal front and back creases, and was thought to have introduced the stand-up turn-down shirt collar, created for him by Charvet. A stickler for proper dress, he is said to have admonished Lord Salisbury for wearing the trousers of an Elder Brother of Trinity House with a Privy Councillor's coat. Deep in an international crisis, Salisbury informed the Prince that it had been a dark morning, and that [...] "my mind must have been occupied by some subject of less importance." [...] The tradition of men not <b>buttoning</b> the bottom button of waistcoats is said to be linked to Edward, who supposedly left his undone because of his large girth. His waist measured 48inches (122cm) shortly before his coronation. He introduced the practice of eating roast beef and potatoes with horseradish sauce and yorkshire pudding on Sundays, a meal that remains a staple British favourite for Sunday lunch. He was not a heavy drinker, though he did drink champagne and, occasionally, port.|$|E

2500|$|Similarly, {{as part of}} {{more casual}} work attire, some American men wear shirts with the top two buttons unbuttoned (buttoned at the third button), though <b>buttoning</b> at the fourth button is widely seen as too casual.
