5000|$|A guy-wire, guy-line, or guy-rope, {{also known}} as simply a guy, is a {{tensioned}} cable designed to add stability to a free-standing structure. They are used commonly in ship masts, radio masts, wind turbines, utility poles, fire service extension ladders used in church raises and tents. A thin vertical mast supported by guy wires is called a guyed mast. Structures that support antennas are frequently of a lattice construction and are called [...] "towers". One end of the guy {{is attached to the}} structure, and the other is anchored to the ground at some distance from the mast or tower base. The tension in the diagonal guy-wire, combined with the compression and <b>buckling</b> <b>strength</b> of the structure, allows the structure to withstand lateral loads such as wind or the weight of cantilevered structures. They are installed radially, usually at equal angles about the structure, in trios and quads. As the tower leans a bit due to the wind force, the increased guy tension is resolved into a compression force in the tower or mast and a lateral force that resists the wind load. For example, antenna masts are often held up by three guy-wires at 120° angles. Structures with predictable lateral loads, such as electrical utility poles, may require only a single guy-wire to offset the lateral pull of the electrical wires, at a spot where the wires change direction.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies on}} {{stainless}} steel tubular section beam-columns have revealed shortcomings in established codified design methods. These shortcomings stem principally from inaccurate {{predictions of the}} bending and column buckling end points of the design interaction curves, where the bending moment end points {{are tied to the}} elastic or plastic moment capacities without considering strain hardening, while the column buckling end points are often over-predicted. Inaccuracies also arise due to the adopted interaction factors, which do not fully capture the structural response of the stainless steel members under combined loading. These observations prompted the present research, which is aimed at developing more efficient design rules for stainless steel tubular section beam-columns. In the presented design proposals, the deformation-based continuous strength method (CSM), allowing for strain hardening, was used to determine the bending moment capacities (i. e. the bending end points), while the column <b>buckling</b> <b>strengths</b> (i. e. the column end points) were calculated according to recently proposed buckling curves. Based on these more accurate end points, new interaction factors were derived following a comprehensive numerical simulation programme. The accuracy of the new proposals was assessed through comparisons against over 3000 experimental and numerical results. Compared to the current design standards, the new proposal yields a higher level of accuracy and consistency in the prediction of stainless steel square and rectangular hollow section (SHS and RHS) beam-column strengths. Use of the proposed interaction factors but with the Eurocode bending moment capacities and revised column <b>buckling</b> <b>strengths</b> as the end points was also assessed and shown to result in more accurate and less scattered strength predictions than the current Eurocode provisions.

In particular, most stiffeners in aerospace structures are composed of aluminium panels often solicited with elastic and plastic bucking under particular boundary and loading conditions. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to enhance the difficulties encountered to predict the incipient elastic-plastic buckling for thin aluminium plates under combined compressive loads. Design/methodology/approach: The used methodology was an analytic non linear approach, validated further with an experimental investigation. In fact, the instability of thin elastic-plastic rectangular panels made of 2024 T 45 alloys is analyzed. General concept of the Von Kaman’s equation with a set of trigonometric and harmonic functions was used in the analytic model. The computation of buckling loads concerns both elastic and plastic instability solutions. Developments in the plastic range were concerned with the (j 2 d) deformation and the (J 2 f) flow constitutive laws. Findings: A methodology to develop this kind of analytic resolution is pointed out and has been illustrated for a set of variables. Several 2 d and 3 d plots, which can be used to predict incipient <b>buckling</b> <b>strengths</b> for plates with flat initial configurations, have been presented for the various load conditions. Research limitations/implications: In the future it will be possible to apply the investigated analytic procedure to other particular cases.
