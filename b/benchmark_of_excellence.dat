This paper condenses retailer best practice into a proposed framework for systematic supply chain improvement based on eight Best Environmental Management Practice (BEMP) techniques. Third party product environmental certification {{is the preferred}} mechanism of improvement owing to transparency and credibility advantages, followed by use of retailer-defined environmental requirements, and implementation of supplier improvement programmes based on <b>benchmarking</b> and dissemination <b>of</b> better management practices. A BEMP to encourage consumption of front-runner ecological products is defined based on use of front-runner ecolabels. The performance of front-runner retailers is used to derive <b>benchmarks</b> <b>of</b> <b>excellence</b> for each technique, primarily expressed as sales shares of improved products within priority product groups. Lifecycle management underpins best practice. JRC. J. 6 -Sustainable production and consumptio...|$|R

ASPIRE to Excellence, begun in 2012, brings experts in different subjects {{from around the world}} together to write standards <b>of</b> <b>excellence</b> in specific topics. Student assessment, student engagement, social accountability, faculty development, and simulation have <b>benchmarks</b> <b>of</b> <b>excellence</b> that schools can compare themselves to and submit evidence of their accomplishments. International panels review these documents and determine if the school merits an ASPIRE recognition award. As of August 2016, 71 schools have submitted documentation and 28 have been awarded ASPIRE recognition. This paper discusses the challenges and opportunities of using accreditation like standards written specifically for excellence to identify schools that can serve as benchmarks and role models for others...|$|R

50|$|The Green Flag Award is the {{benchmark}} national standard for publicly accessible parks and green {{spaces in the}} United Kingdom. The scheme {{was set up in}} 1996 to recognise and reward green spaces in England and Wales that met the laid down high standards.

Any free to enter public park or green space is eligible to apply for an Award. Privately owned but publicly accessible parks have received awards such as Chavasse Park (Liverpool One) and Rutland Water (Anglian Water services Ltd). The scheme is owned by the government through the Department for Communities and Local Government, though it is managed by other agents under contract. A pilot scheme was started in 2007 in Scotland and three parks were given awards that year. Both primary and secondary schools may be awarded the Green Flag in recognition of steps taken towards making the school increasingly eco-friendly. Meanwhile, the award goes to other countries too for example to Germany (Erholungspark Marzahn and others).|$|E

40|$|This report aims to {{describe}} how the EMAS Sectoral Reference Documents on best environmental management practise are developed. Firstly, the EMAS regulation and the legal background of the documents are introduced. Afterwards, the main elements included in such documents (best environmental management practices, environmental performance indicators and <b>benchmarks</b> <b>of</b> <b>excellence)</b> are described and some examples are provided. The outputs of the process, namely the Sectoral Reference Documents and the JRC Scientific and Policy Reports on best environmental management practice are then outlined, together with the role played in developing the documents by the different actors involved: JRC/IPTS, the Technical Working Group and the EMAS Committee. An in-depth presentation of the methodology used, introducing the frontrunner approach and how information is gathered and drafted, allows the reader to have a complete picture of the process for developing the EMAS Sectoral Reference Documents.

The findings suggest the transfer <b>of</b> service <b>excellence</b> best practices from the hospitality industry to the healthcare industry was successful, and there were specific factors that enabled The Ritz-Carlton service excellence best practices to be institutionalized into their culture. ...|$|R
50|$|Academic {{standards}} are the <b>benchmarks</b> <b>of</b> quality and <b>excellence</b> in education {{such as the}} rigour of curricula {{and the difficulty of}} examinations. The creation of universal academic standards requires agreement on rubrics, criteria or other systems of coding academic achievement. At colleges and universities, faculty are under increasing pressure from administrators to award students good marks and grades without regard for those students' actual abilities, both to keep those students in school paying tuition and to boost the schools' graduation rates. Students often use course evaluations to criticize any instructor who they feel has been making the course too difficult, even if an objective evaluation would show that the course has been too easy. It is very difficult to find a direct correlation between the quality of the course and the outcome of the course evaluations.|$|R
