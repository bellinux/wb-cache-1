6000|$|It was a {{moderate}} claim, to which Lady Grace might assent. [...] "He {{strikes me as}} naturally quick and--well, nice. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> you than he hasn't had a chance." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "They {{are hardly}} likely {{to choose the}} exact moment when {{we are to be}} away, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> quite <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> you that the risk must not be run." ...|$|R
60|$|P.S.--You were {{perfectly}} right about your Uncle Donald's moustache, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> {{you that it}} is more his misfortune than his fault. I think he does it on purpose.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are in a}} great {{hurry to}} get that bright cuirass of yours dented, Rupert; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> you, the cavalry are always out of it. There go the infantry." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, but {{the current}} that is keeping us back is helping her on towards us. It will be a close thing; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> you, I am afraid that the lugger will be here first.|$|E
60|$|FRANKLYN. You must excuse my daughter's {{shocking}} manners, Burge; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> {{her that}} popular democratic statesmen soon {{come to believe}} that everyone they speak to is an ignorant dupe and a born fool into the bargain.|$|E
5000|$|Steven Derounian (R, NY) and the Congressional Subcommittee that {{investigated}} the 1950s Quiz show scandals {{are presented in}} Robert Redford's 1994 film Quiz Show where Derounian dissents saying: [...] "I'm happy that you've made the statement. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> cannot <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> most of my colleagues. See, I don't think an adult of your intelligence should be commended for simply, at long last, telling the truth."His actual remarks, taken from the published transcript, were: [...] "Mr. Van Doren, I am happy that you made the statement, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> cannot <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> most of my colleagues who commended you for telling the truth, because I don't think an adult of your intelligence ought {{to be commended for}} telling the truth." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "He always {{laughs and}} says I'll {{never be able}} to get along [...] <b>with</b> you. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> him.

6000|$|... "I {{am quite}} skeptical and {{indifferent}} to the whole affair, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> Octavia that {{it is best to}} say nothing to my aunt if she is ignorant of the matter. Her rooms are a long way off, and perhaps she did not hear the confusion." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I should merely say, quite {{calmly and}} decidedly, 'Thank you, Mr. Brooke, {{you are very}} kind, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> Father that I am too young to enter into any {{engagement}} at present, so please say no more, but let us be friends as we were.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|Barbara nodded. [...] "No doubt," [...] she said. [...] "We {{will let}} it go at that. As you may have noticed, we are now and then almost indecently candid in this country, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> my {{brother-in-law}} who says that nobody could make an Englishman talk unless he wanted to." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no; we did {{our best}} for the moment. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> quite <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> my lord, now, that you stayed too long at Rome under the circumstances. It was a good move--that going to Sicily, and so wise of you to travel in Egypt. Men should travel." ...|$|R
40|$|As a {{professional}} planetary scientist and loyal longtime Planetary Society member, I have generally supported the positions taken by The Planetary Society on space exploration. <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> the statement "The Vision Must Be Global," {{which is the}} title of a recent article by Louis Friedman, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> the "Vision" as enunciated by President Bush and as reflected by the recent reorganization of NASA...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, {{you opened}} my mind,' said Cadurcis. 'I owe you everything; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> quite <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> you {{that nothing is}} worth an effort.

60|$|Ibid. Burnet, when a {{prosecution}} was commenced against Burnet in Scotland, he obtained naturalization {{for himself in}} Holland, after which he wrote to the Earl of Middleton, saying that:--being now naturalized in Holland, my allegiance was, during my stay in these parts, transferred from His Majesty to the States.--Swift. Civilians deny that, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> him.|$|E
6000|$|Campbell: [...] "That was my sister's question, and I did answer it. Have some tea, ladies? I'm {{glad you}} like my portrait, and that you think he's got my lovely turn of the head, and the way I hold my fan, and the {{character}} of my skirt; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> you that it isn't half as pretty as I am." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{would that}} I could {{meet some of}} their ships {{on their way back}} from Italy," [...] Edmund said. [...] "I warrant that we should obtain a rare booty, with gems of art such as would delight King Alfred, but are thrown away on these barbarians; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> you that 'tis shameful that the coasts of all Europe should be overrun with these pirates." ...|$|E
5000|$|He is {{entitled}} to let down. … I can understand why he expresses that view. He {{has every right to}} express that view. In a sense it is shaming to have to say it, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> personally <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> his view. It is very, very disheartening. I am sorry there is nothing more I can do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come, Phil," [...] said Ned, laughing, as {{he helped}} {{himself to a}} huge round of buttered toast, [...] "I 'ope you han't made up your mind to go in for either of them professions, for they don't pay. They entail hard work, small profits, an' great risk--not to mention the {{dishonesty}} of 'em. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> you about London neither." ...|$|R
5000|$|You're right; {{women are}} great actors. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> cant <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> {{you in your}} {{statement}} that the great women {{can be counted on}} the fingers of one hand. Men have sat at the feet of women down the ages and our civilization, bad or good, we owe to the influence of women...Let us look at the records of the great women. Robert E. Howard ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Harry!" [...] exclaimed his wife, [...] "you {{should not}} speak of your {{patients}} in that way, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> you perfectly;" [...] and then, addressing the boy, who had just entered, and who stood by the door, [...] "Do {{you mean to say}} that there is anything serious the matter with Miss Panney?" [...] she said severely. [...] "Does she really want to see the doctor immediately?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{can promise}} that willingly, my lord," [...] Jethro answered. [...] "He has treated Amuba {{more as a}} brother than a servant since we came here, and I will treat {{him as if he}} were a brother to Amuba, now that danger threatens. The journey you speak of would, indeed, be a long and {{dangerous}} one; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> you that only by accomplishing it is there even a chance of escape." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I will, {{with your}} permission, wait," [...] Philip said. [...] "I lament this peace, {{which seems to}} me to leave us in a worse {{position}} than before the war; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> you that it cannot last, and that ere long the Huguenots will be driven again to take up arms. Francois and I have become as brothers and, until the cause is either lost or won, I would fain remain." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear, I am {{interested}}--deeply {{interested in}} you. That {{there may be}} some such influence as Destiny in our poor mortal lives, I dare not deny. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> your conclusion. What Destiny has to do with you and with me, neither you nor I can pretend to know beforehand. In the presence of that great mystery, humanity must submit to be ignorant. Wait, Iris--wait!" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>I</b> do not <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> {{you on the}} League {{question}}, nor on {{the woman}} question connected with it, only we will not quarrel to-day, and I have written enough already without an argument at the end.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Fellow-feeling,' I answered. 'So is mine, Georgina Lois. <b>But</b> as <b>I</b> quite <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> you {{as to the}} atrocity of such conduct, I have {{suppressed}} the Georgina. It ought to be made penal to send innocent girls into the world so burdened.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Troth, an' that's {{just what}} she does need, sor!" [...] said Paddy Flinders, {{stepping}} out of the bush at the moment. [...] "Excuse me, sor, but I cudn't help hearin' ye, for ye was spakin' out loud. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> ye intirely; an', if I may make so bowld, I'm glad to find ye in that state o' mind.

6000|$|... "And can howl in a pack. This much, then, I will concede to you: <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> Eve, we {{must either}} punish him affirmatively, by pulling his ears, or treat him with contempt, {{which is always}} {{negative}} or silent. I wish he had entered the state-room of that fine young fellow, Paul Blunt, who is of an age and a spirit {{to give him a}} lesson that might make a paragraph for his Active Inquirer, if not a scissors' extract of himself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The fact is, {{somebody}} should invent a mill to do amusements for you, my dear fellow," [...] said Sir Hugo, [...] "as the Tartars get their praying done. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> you; I never cared for play. It's monotonous--knits the brain up into meshes. And it knocks {{me up to}} watch it now. I suppose one gets poisoned with the bad air. I never stay here more than ten minutes. But where's your gambling beauty, Deronda? Have you seen her lately?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Despite these {{problems}} we do experience a 'meeting of minds' with other individuals at certain times. People are {{even able to}} ignore the words actually said, and say something like [...] "I don't <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> what you are saying; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> do <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> what you mean." [...] Schumacher argues {{that one of the}} reasons we can understand other people is through bodily experience, because so many bodily expressions, gestures and postures are part of our common human heritage.|$|R
40|$|Professor Robert Sedler is {{a leading}} {{constitutional}} law professor and a well-known civil liberties lawyer. I think he is right about many things. To cite <b>but</b> one example, <b>I</b> think he was right when he led the ACLU 2 ̆ 7 s successful legal attack on certain University of Michigan restrictions on 2 ̆ 2 hate speech. 2 ̆ 22 ̆ 7 <b>But</b> <b>I</b> cannot <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> him about physician-assisted suicide, no matter how narrowly he frames the issue. ...|$|R
6000|$|He wrote a {{brief reply}} to Gillingham. [...] "I know I am entirely wrong, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> you. As to her having lived with and had three {{children}} by him, my feeling is (though I can advance no logical or moral defence of it, on the old lines) that it has done little more than finish her education. I shall write to her, and learn whether what that woman said is true or no." ...|$|R
