50|$|Stem and bulb {{nematodes}} are migratory endoparasites. Their lifecycle {{occurs in}} five stages {{with the first}} molt occurring in the egg and {{the second and third}} molt occurring in the soil. By the fourth stage, juveniles have entered the plant through young tissue and/or seedlings. The fourth molt then occurs inside the plant. The adult female must mate with a male to reproduce and lay eggs. A complete reproductive lifecycle of the stem and <b>bulb</b> <b>nematode</b> is 19-25 days (egg to egg). Reproduction takes place in succulent, rapidly growing tissues or in storage organs and continues throughout. A female can lay 200-500 eggs in her lifespan. However, if conditions are unfavorable, the nematodes can halt their lifecycle. The lifespan of stem and bulb nematodes is about 70 days. Most generations are passed inside bulbs, stems and leaves. Eggs and larvae overwinter in dried infected host material. They are also found in weed hosts and seeds of composite. Stem and bulb nematodes can survive up to two years in freezing or extremely dry environments in the soil. D. dipsaci can survive on or in plant tissue by entering cryptobiosis and survive for 3-5 years in this stage. During dormancy, D. dipsaci shows no sign of life and the metabolic activity is almost at a standstill.|$|E
40|$|Morphologial, biochemical, {{molecular}} and karyological {{analyses of}} different populations and races {{of the stem}} and <b>bulb</b> <b>nematode</b> Ditylenchus dipsaci have suggested that it represents a species complex, of which only D. dipsaci sensu stricto and its morphologically larger variant, known as the giant race of the stem and <b>bulb</b> <b>nematode,</b> are plant parasites of economic importance. The present study singles out the giant race from this complex, herein described as a new species named Ditylenchus gigas n. sp., {{on the basis of}} morphological and molecular data obtained from several populations collected from broad beans in southern Italy, southern Spain and Lebanon. The new species epithet, which refers to the large body size of the nematode with respect to the normal races, must be considered to be conspecific with the D. dipsaci'giant race' from Fabaceae in recent literature. Morphologically, the new species is characterized by a body size 1 · 5 - 2 times longer than the 'normal race', stylet delicate (11 · 5 - 13 · 0 μm long) with knobs distinctly sloping backwards, and long post-vulval uterine sac (81 - 150 μm long). Results of molecular analysis of rDNA sequences including the ITS 1 - 5. 8 S-ITS 2 region, the D 2 -D 3 fragment of the 28 S gene, the small 18 S subunit, the partial mitochondrial gene for cytochrome c oxidase I (mtCOI), and hsp 90 gene sequences, support the new taxonomic species status for the former D. dipsaci giant race from Vicia faba, and clearly distinguish D. gigas n. sp. from D. dipsaci sensu stricto. © 2011 The Authors.

40|$|International audienceIn Europe, {{the stem}} and <b>bulb</b> <b>nematode</b> Ditylenchus dipsaci has been {{listed as a}} {{quarantine}} pest by EPPO: without any control, it may cause complete failure of alfalfa crops. Movement of nematodes associated with seeds {{is considered to be}} the highest-risk pathway for the spread of this pest. Since the 2010 official withdrawal of methyl bromide in Europe, {{and in the absence of}} any alternative chemical, fumigation of contaminated seed batches is no longer possible, which makes the production of nematode-free alfalfa seeds difficult to achieve and leads to unmarketable seed batches. Thermotherapy is being considered as a realistic alternative strategy, but its efficiency still remains to be validated. The combination of the currently available methods (i. e. use of resistant cultivars, seed production according to a certification scheme, mechanical sieving, seed batch inspection) could significantly reduce the likelihood of seed contamination. However, it does not guarantee a total eradication of the nematode. Although it is already widely distributed all over Europe, reclassification of D. dipsaci as a regulated non-quarantine pest to reduce the possibility of further introductions and the rate of spread of this pest appears to be a risky strategy because of the lack of up-to-date documented data to evaluate damage thresholds and determine acceptable tolerance levels...|$|E

5000|$|Nearly 450 {{different}} {{plant species}} {{are susceptible to}} D. dipsaci due to the vast number of races. Many of these plants are economically valuable food crops and ornamentals and cannot be sold if they are infected or damaged by stem and <b>bulb</b> <b>nematodes.</b> [...] D. dipsaci is especially important economically because the damage it can cause renders the plants unmarketable. Crops such as onions and carrots cannot be sold because the products are infected and damaged. Other crops such as alfalfa, oats, and tulips that are not used primarily for their roots still suffer necrosis and stunting that slowly destroys the plant. Seeds, bulbs, or saplings infected with nematodes often do not survive to maturity and are worthless.|$|R
5000|$|Stem and <b>bulb</b> <b>nematodes</b> are migratory endoparasites and can {{be spread}} through {{irrigation}} water, tools and animals. [...] When the plants are covered in a film of moisture, D. dipsaci can move upwards to new leaves and stems. They enter through stomata or wounds. D. dipsaci feeds on the parenchymatous cells of the cortex once inside the plant. They release an enzyme, pectinase, that dissolves the cell walls. Once D. dipsaci begins to feed on the plant, cells near {{the head of the}} nematode lose all or a portion of their contents. The cells surrounding these begin to divide and enlarge. This develops into a gall or malformation of the seedling. This opening allows secondary pathogens to enter such as bacteria and fungi. Favorable entry of young seedlings in the soil occurs through the root cap or from inside the seed. The plant cells become enlarged due to the disappearance of chloroplasts and an increase of intracellular spaces in parenchyma tissue. Once the bulbs enlarge, D. dipsaci migrates down the stem. This causes the stem to become puffy and soft due to cavities, which can lead to collapse. D. dipsaci only enters the soil again if conditions become unfavorable.|$|R
40|$|Stunted {{growth of}} fall-sown sugar beets (Beta vulgaris) {{associated}} with high incidence of crownroot infections and large soil infestations by Ditylenchus dipsaci were observed {{at the end of}} the crop growing season in southern Spain by early June 2005. The largest proportion (75 %) of the nematode life-stages in plant and soil was the fourth-stage juvenile. The large number (up to 3, 750 nematodes per gram of fresh tissue) of D. dipsaci individuals and severe anatomical alterations observed in storage sugar beet roots suggest that the stem and <b>bulb</b> <b>nematode</b> is the causal agent of the impaired growth of sugar beets observed in commercial fields. Observed morphological traits of nematode specimens and results of specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and phylogenetic analyses confirmed that the population of D. dipsaci infecting sugar beet belongs to the normal (nongiant) biological type of the nematode. Results of host-range bioassays indicated that the population of D. dipsaci infecting sugar beet in southern Spain reproduces on pea (including seeds and pods), onion, potato, spinach, and tomato, but not on bean, cotton, maize, and tobacco. These results indicate that D. dipsaci may be an important constraint for sugar beet crops in the affected area, but also for other important crops commonly used in rotation with them.

40|$|The plant-parasitic {{nematodes}} are {{the most}} important pests around the world. Many species of the plant-parasitic nematodes cause high losses of crop yield and many of them have a quarantine status. The stem and <b>bulb</b> <b>nematode</b> Ditylenchus dipsaci (Kühn 1857) Filipjev 1836 is a migratory endoparasite nematode of over five hundred vas-cular plant species. The stem nematode D. dipsaci is prevalent {{in a wide range of}} climatic condi-tions, where moisture regimes enable nematode infection, multiplication and dispersal. The main method of D. dipsaci control is crop rotation, but the presence of morphologically indistinguishable host races with different host preferences makes rotation difficult (Wendt et al. 1993). The biologi-cal races exhibit different degrees of reproductive isolation, such as partial or complete reproduc-tive incompatibility (Erikson 1974). Each biologi-cal race is able to complete its life cycle only on a specific plant host. Among the most important plant hosts of D. dipsaci in Central Europe are bulb vegetables (onion, garlic and leek), carrot, alfalfa, clover, sugar beet, chicory, potatoes, strawberry, ornamental bulb plants (Narcissus spp.), and also many common weeds. Symptoms on host plants are not always specific as for appearance. Early infested plants and low infested seeds show no symptoms. Nematodes cause swellings and distor-tion of aerial plant parts and necrosis or rotting of stem bases, bulbs, tubers and rhizomes.

40|$|The {{stem and}} <b>bulb</b> <b>nematode,</b> Ditylenchus dipsaci, {{is a serious}} pest of forage, horticultural and other crops. The two races of D. dipsaci that occur in Australia are the oat and lucerne races. These two races have the 'normal' {{morphology}} compared to the 'giant' type that attacks Vicia faba. The oat and lucerne races {{have been found in}} eastern Australia but not in Western Australia. There are no morphological or specific molecular tests to differentiate races within closely related 'normal' types of D. dipsaci. The aim of this work was to find protein biomarkers that would differentiate oat and lucerne races of D. dipsaci using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOFMS), 2 -D PAGE and associated proteomics techniques. Three protein biomarkers at m/z 4313 ± 0. 1 %, 6300 ± 0. 1 % and 7460 ± 0. 1 % were found that discriminate the oat and lucerne races of D. dipsaci using MALDI-TOFMS. The biomarker at m/z 4313 ± 0. 1 % was the prominent race-specific marker for the lucerne race and is almost absent in the oat race. In addition, proteomic maps were obtained by 2 -D PAGE of proteins extracted from oat and lucerne races of D. dipsaci. This analysis allowed a comparison of acetone soluble proteins of oat and lucerne races of D. dipsaci. A prominent protein spot was identified with an isoelectric point (pI) of about 5 and molecular mass ca 4. 5 kDa for the lucerne race, which was absent in the oat race. This particular protein was trypsin-digested and analysed by MALDI-TOFMS and MALDI-TOF-TOFMS. The resultant spectra of peptide mass fingerprints (PMF) showed two major peptides at m/z 845 ± 0. 1 %, 916 ± 0. 1 % and a less intense peptide at m/z 1258 ± 0. 1 %.

40|$|Variability of {{morphological}} characters used {{to separate}} Pratylenchus penetrans from {{other species of}} the genus was studied in a population originating from a single gravid female. Pronounced heteromorphism was observed and characterized. About 30 % of females had a crenate-tail terminus. Several shapes of stylet knobs were characterized; 50 % of them were anteriorly flattened to indented. The outer margin of the cephalic framework extended into the body from one-half to two annules. The shape of the spermatheca varied from round to oval. A fifth lateral line was observed in many specimens. Environmental factors, and particularly the host plant, influenced such morphometric characters as body length, width, esophagus length, stylet length, V value, a and b' ratios, as well as qualitative characters such as tail terminus, growth of ovary, and shape of median <b>bulb.</b> <b>Nematodes</b> reared on pea and cabbage had {{a higher percentage of}} females with a crenate-tail terminus than those from tomato, rye, beet, and alfalfa callus culture. Nematodes from peas were longer and wider; they often had gonads that extended to esophagi, but they had shorter esophagi amt stylets than those from callus culture. Populations from different geographical locations also exhibited variahility in morphological characters, as did the Cornell population. The validity of many characters used in species identification is discussed, and the possibility that other related Pratylenchus species are conspecific with P. penetrans is suggested...|$|R
40|$|Treatment of {{daffodil}} (Narcissus pseudonarcissus) {{bulbs in}} a 0. 37 % formaldehyde water solution at 44 C for 240 minutes {{is a standard}} practice in California for management of the stem and <b>bulb</b> <b>nematode,</b> Ditylenchus dipsaci. Recent concern over the safety of formaldehyde and growers' requests for a shorter treatment time prompted a reevaluation of the procedure. The time (Y, in minutes) required to raise the temperature at the bulb center from 25 to 44 C was related to bulb circumference (X, in cm) and is described by the linear regression Y = - 15 + 3. 4 X. The time required for 100 % mortality of D. dipsaci in vitro without formaldehyde was 150, 60, and 15 minutes at 44, 46, and 48 C, respectively. Hot water treatment (HWT) with 0. 37 % formaldehyde at 44 C for 150 minutes controlled D. dipsaci {{and did not have}} a detrimental effect on plant growth and flower production. Shorter formaldehyde-HWT of 90, 45, and 30 minutes at 46, 48, and 50 C, respectively, controlled D. dipsaci but suppressed plant growth and flower production. Fungal genera commonly isolated from the bulbs in association with D. dipsaci were Penicillium sp., Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. narcissi, and Mucor plumbeus, representing 60, 25, and 5 %, respectively, of the total fungi isolated. These fungi caused severe necrosis in daffodil bulbs. HWT at 44 C for 240 minutes reduced the number of colonies recovered from bulbs. The effects of formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, and sodium hypochlorite in reducing the population of fungi within bulbs were variable. Satisfactory control of D. dipsaci within bulbs can be achieved with HWT of bulbs at 44 C for 150 minutes with 0. 37 % formaldehyde or at 44 C for 240 minutes without chemicals...|$|E
40|$|Pesticide {{treatments}} {{provide an}} effective control of soilborne pests in vegetable and fruit crops, but their toxicity to animals and people and residual toxicity in plants and soil, and high cost make their use hazardous and economically expensive. Moreover, actual environmental legislation is imposing severe {{restrictions on the}} use or the total withdrawal of most soil-applied pesticides. Therefore, an increasing emphasis {{has been placed on}} the use of nonchemical or pesticide-reduced control methods. Soil solarization is a nonpesticidal technique which kills a wide range of soil pathogens, nematodes, and weed seeds and seedlings through the high soil temperatures raised by placing plastic sheets on moist soil during periods of high ambient temperature. Direct thermal inactivation of target organisms was found {{to be the most important}} mechanism of solarization biocidal effect, contributed also by a heat-induced release of toxic volatile compounds and a shift of soil microflora to microorganisms antagonist of plant pathogens. Soil temperature and moisture are critical variables in solarization thermal effect, though the role of plastic film is also fundamental for the solarizing process, as it should increase soil temperature by allowing the passage of solar radiation while reducing energetic radiative and convective losses. Best solarizing properties were shown by low-density or vynilacetate- coextruded polyethylene formulations, but a wide range of plastic materials were documented as also suitable to soil solarization. Solar heating was normally reported to improve soil structure and increase soil content of soluble nutrients, particularly dissolved organic matter, inorganic nitrogen forms, and available cations, and shift composition and richness of soil microbial communities, with a marked increase of plant growth beneficial, plant pathogen antagonistic or root quick recolonizer microorganisms. As a consequence of these effects, soil solarization was largely documented to increase plant growth and crop yield and quality along more than two crop cycles. Most important fungal plant pathogenic species were found strongly suppressed by the solarizing treatment, as several studies documented an almost complete eradication of economically relevant pathogens, such as Fusarium spp., Phytophthora spp., Pythium spp., Sclerotium spp., Verticillium spp., and their related diseases in many vegetable and fruit crops and in different experimental conditions. Beneficial effects on fungal pathogens were stated to commonly last for about two growing seasons and also longer. Soil solarization demonstrated to be effective for the control of bacterial diseases caused by Agrobacterium spp., Clavibacter michiganensis and Erwinia amylovora, but failed to reduce incidence of tomato diseases caused by Pseudomonas solanacearum. Solarization was generally found less effective on phytoparasitic nematodes than on other organisms, due to their quicker soil recolonization compared to fungal pathogens and weeds, but field and greenhouse studies documented consistant reductions of root-knot severity and population densities of root-knot nematodes, Meloidogyne spp., as well as a satisfactory control of cyst-nematode species, such as Globodera rostochiensis and Heterodera carotae, and <b>bulb</b> <b>nematode</b> Ditylenchus dipsaci. Weeds were variously affected by solar heating, as annual species were generally found almost completely suppressed and perennial species more difficult to control, due to the occurrence deep propagules not exposed to lethal temperature. Residual effect of solarization on weeds was found much more pronounced than on nematodes and most fungal pathogens. Soil solarization may be perfect fit for all situations in which use of pesticides is restricted or completely banned, such as in organic production, or in farms located next to urban areas, or specialty crops with few labeled pesticides. Advantages of solarization also include economic convenience, as demonstrated by many comparative benefit/cost analyses, ease of use by growers, adaptability to many cropping systems, and a full integration with other control tools, which makes this technique perfectly compatible with principles of integrated pest management required by sustainable agriculture...|$|E
