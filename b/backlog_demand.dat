To reduce computation burden, an approximation approach based on the decomposition of multi-dimensional state transition is used for systems with two or more part types. Numerical studies show unidirectional substitution is beneficial in cases where the substitution cost is relatively small compared with the difference in backorder cost of parts.

When the shortage occurs, some customers are willing to wait for back order and others would turn to buy from other sellers. In this connection, numerous authors (see Dye et al. 2007; Min and Zhou 2009; Tripathy and Pradhan 2010; Taleizadeh and Pentico 2013; Taleizadeh 2014; Palanivel and Uthayakumar 2016; Maihami and Kamalabadi 2012 a; b; Taleizadeh and Nematollahi 2014; Taleizadeh et al. 2017; Taleizadeh 2017; Lashgari and Taleizadeh 2016; Palanivel and Uthayakumar 2016) addressed inventory models with backordering under various environments. Inventory model of deteriorating items with time proportional backlogging rate have been developed by Dye et al. (2007). Min and Zhou (2009) derived a perishable inventory model under stock-dependent selling rate and shortage-dependent partial backlogging with capacity constraint. An EOQ model for Weibull deteriorating items with power demand and partial backlogging have been considered by Tripathy and Pradhan (2010).

40|$|The {{existing}} economic production quantity (EPQ) {{models in}} imperfect production systems normally assume either deteriorating production processes or deteriorating inventory. In this paper, the two aspects {{are combined together}} in a single approach to solve single machine, single product EPQ problem. There {{are assumed to be}} two states: 1) in-control and 2) out-of-control state. At the beginning of each production cycle, the production process is in control with a low defective rate. After a certain time period, the production process switches from an in-control to an out-of-control state. As a result, the defect rate increases to another level and more defective items are produced. Defective products are reworked after the normal production process all together but before that they are stored in an inventory, so a corresponding inventory holding cost is generated. Backordering is also considered in this model and products are first used to satisfy the <b>backlog</b> <b>demand</b> in each production run. Three different cases are considered and discussed in which the switch of state occurs in the backlog period, the inventory surplus period, and after the normal production period, respectively. By finding the optimal total production and backlog quantity, the expected total cost per unit product is minimized.

It was observed that the maintenance management of these roads was based on engineering judgement through visual inspection all over the country, without having any economic or technical analysis. Therefore, a comprehensive pavement management system for rural roads 2 ̆ 7 maintenance is needed in Chobe and also in all the council areas of Botswana, which would consist of data collection, database, use of the Highway Development and Management Model to undertake efficient decision making project preparation, funding, implementation and feedback. A partial implementation of pavement management system in Chobe has been highlighted in this paper.

However, risk management tools just represent the infrastructural and technical precondition, but it also requires an appropriate risk culture by all employees for an effective and comprehensive risk management system. Due to diverse shortcomings identified during the literature review, the researcher intends to contribute to corporate real estate management and risk management likewise, by investigating risk culture, theoretically and practically, through an in-depth case study. The case study unit is a corporate real estate organisation of a diversified retail and wholesale company based in Germany. From an academic viewpoint, the researcher has developed a general framework consisting of different key components associated with risk culture from the literature. This represents the conceptual basis for the case study that followed, to identify managerial expectations, i. e. the target risk culture, of the case study unit’s executives, through qualitative interviews (n= 11). Based on this, the researcher aims to find out any differences between these expectations and employee’s perception, i. e. the existing risk culture, through a web-based survey of all their full-time employees (n= 455). The described approach also represents a proven way as a theoretical concept to investigate risk culture in organisations. In terms of practical contribution for the case study unit, the survey responses (nr= 199) confirms the biggest <b>backlog</b> <b>demand</b> in clarity and transparency of risk management processes, including employees’ knowledge of the respective policy, and cross departmental exchange.

40|$|Income {{inequality}} in China is severe; {{measured by the}} Gini-coefficient it amounted to 0. 46 in 2011; wealth distribution is even worse with 0. 61. These disparities led to {{a major shift in}} emphasis of politics in general and of the Five-Year Plan for National Economic and Social Development by the National People´s Congress in particular. While previously the strategy of the Five-Year Plans had been “Making the nation [our emphasis] rich as top priority”, this was changed to “Making people [our emphasis] rich as top priority” in the 12 th Five-Year Plan (2011 - 2015), enacted in March 2011. The strategic change from “nation” to “people” indicates that the political decision-makers in China accepted the aim of a fair income distribution as a political issue of great importance. In this paper, richness is defined in the political-philosophical tradition as the right measure for one’s own needs and wants; only its environmental aspect is focused on in this study. The development of the Chinese environmental conditions is compared with the German ones and the former’s future outlook is judged optimistically because of the achievements in the last five years. However, the complexity and fragility of the environmental system will within a decade confront Chinese politicians with the same problems as it does right now in Germany. In order to provide a solution addressing this development, this paper analyzes what Karl Marx had to say on the long-run dynamics of the economic system. He saw poverty as a necessary yet unintended consequence of the capitalistic system and used this insight as a “precision tool for the study of social change” (Elster 1986), which can also be employed to examine the unintended repercussions of economic activity on nature. Marx, who studied environmental and resource issues in detail, thought that the inventiveness of the capitalistic system would finally overcome all of them in the course of time. In {{view of the fact that}} three billion people on earth still have a <b>backlog</b> <b>demand</b> to satisfy basic needs and in addition a further three billion are expected to be born until 2050, the future of the natural environmental conditions looks somber. If it is not possible to decouple economic growth from ensuing environmental strain, Marx may well be right after all in his prediction that the capitalistic system will collapse, although in quite a different manner than he thought. This being the case we take recourse to the thoughts of one of the influential intellectual German figures, to Romano Guardini. He foresaw changes in the self-perception of humankind and in the comprehension of nature. These imply a shift in the ethos of government as well, which would in turn pose three great challenges to politics: (i) understanding nature in a new light, (ii) listening to what drives human hearts, and (iii) governing according to law...|$|E

The potential operational and economic impact resulting from their temporary closure is unknown, but is widely believed to be very significant. This paper investigates one aspect of this potential impact, focusing specifically {{on the use of}} supply chain inventory as a risk mitigation strategy for a one supplier, one customer system in which goods are transported through a port-of-entry subject to temporary closures. Closure likelihood and duration are modeled using a completely observed, exogenous Markov chain. Order lead times are dependent on the status of the port-of-entry, including potential congestion backlogs of unprocessed work. An infinite-horizon, periodic-review inventory control model is developed to determine the optimal average cost ordering policies under linear ordering costs with <b>backlogged</b> <b>demand.</b> When congestion is negligible, the optimal policy is state invariant. In the more complex case of non-negligible congestion, this result no longer holds.

40|$|Die Arbeit thematisiert Reformkonzepte zur Lehrerbildung, die auf diverse Leistungsstudien und Forderungen nach Standards reagieren. Von den formulierten Kompetenzbereichen interessiert an dieser Stelle jener, der den adäquaten Umgang mit schulischen Veränderungen ins Zentrum rückt. Zu den "neuen" Zuständigkeiten von Lehrerinnen und Lehrern gehören etwa die Evaluation von Unterricht oder die kooperative Profilbildung und Selbstverwaltung der eigenen Schule. Die Bildungswissenschaften sehen in den erweiterten Aufgaben einen Paradigmenwechsel, der in Zusammenhang mit dem beruflichen Selbstverständnis und einer professionellen Haltung steht. Fraglich ist, inwieweit eine solche Haltung administrativ geplant werden kann: Soziale Leitideen wie Engagement oder Kooperation lassen sich nicht "absichtlich" aneignen, sondern zielen weitgehend auf implizite Wissensbestände. Die vorliegende Arbeit fasst dieses Praxiswissen mithilfe der Handlungstheorie Bourdieus und fragt mit Blick auf Professionsdesiderate danach, ob und wie Lehrerbildung einen Habitus fördert, der "innovativ" ist. Untersucht werden die Kompetenzen von Berufsneulingen, da diese immer wieder als Hoffnungsträger einer nachhaltigen Schulentwicklung genannt werden. Die Studie bedient einen empirischen Nachholbedarf und trägt zur sozialwissenschaftlichen Methodologieentwicklung bei. Im Fokus steht ein Begleitseminar zum Schulpraktikum, in dem Studierende "eigene Fälle" supervisorisch bearbeiten sowie diverse Gruppendiskussionen durchführen. Der komplexe Datenkorpus beinhaltet verschiedenste Textsorten, Beobachtungen und Erhebungen. Für die {{qualitative}} Analyse wesentlich ist, dass die Konstruktion von handlungsleitenden Bedeutungen nicht als rein geistige Operation betrachtet wird, sondern sozial situiert und in einem kollektiv erfahrenen Alltag angelegt ist. Da sich dieses symbolische Handeln gewissermaßen intuitiv und inkorporiert vollzieht, setzt es zudem keine willentliche Zustimmung voraus. Die Rekonstruktion realer Studienpraxis belegt eindrücklich, dass sich in der Kommunikation zwischen den Ausbildungsbeteiligten weit mehr ereignet als die Weitergabe von Information. Die Studie identifiziert institutionelle Einflüsse und zeichnet dezidiert die Umstände nach, unter denen Studierende auf altbewährte Strategien zurückgreifen oder alternativ ungewohnte ausprobieren. Sie zeigt auch, dass sich verschiedene Handlungsfelder nicht strikt voneinander trennen lassen und biografische Grundorientierungen und Konfliktmuster in andere Kontexte hineintragen werden. Die Methodologie der Grounded Theory (Strauss/Corbin) bietet die Chance, für die Theoriebildung mehrdisziplinäre Referenzfolien heran zu ziehen. Insbesondere die Anbindung an soziologische Makrotheorien wie der reflexiven Modernisierung (Beck, Giddens) liefert der Lehrer(aus-) bildung einen Rahmen, der mit landläufigen Theorie-Praxis-Dualismen bricht. Eine passfähige Verdichtung leisten neuere sozialpsychologische Konzepte zu Identität (Keupp) und Situiertem Lernen (Lave/Wenger). Das zentrale Ergebnis der Untersuchung lautet erstens, dass die berufliche Entwicklung von künftigen Lehrerinnen und Lehrern von der Individualisierung wesentlich tangiert wird, und zweitens, dass sich daraus ein Steuerbedarf für die Praxisgemeinschaften ergibt. Die Studie verdeutlicht entgegen trivialen Machbarkeitsvorstellungen von Bildungsplänen, wie Individualisierungsphänomene die professionsinhärente Unsicherheit von Bildungsarbeit gewissermaßen potenzieren: Die Ausbildungskontexte sind geprägt von kurzzeitigen Partizipationen, unübersichtlichen Sozialzusammenhängen und pluralistischen Wertvorstellungen, die eine professionelle Orientierung erschweren. Während die Entscheidungs- und Konkurrenzprobleme wachsen, werden gleichzeitig die Beziehungen und Zugehörigkeiten fragiler. Hier decken die Ergebnisse die normativen Implikationen von Idealkonstrukten wie "Lernenden Organisationen" auf und relativieren einseitige Gewinnmythen, wie etwa über Teamarbeit, Flexibilität oder Risikofreude. Als Schlüsselkonzept im Umgang mit Unsicherheit und Risiko stellt die Theoriebildung Ver-trauen (Luhmann) heraus, das nicht mehr durch Traditionen gegeben ist, sondern von den Ausbildungsbeteiligten aktiv hergestellt werden muss und ein spezifisches soziales Können erfordert. Vor dem Anspruch einer integrierten Berufsbildung braucht es Partizipationsformen, die gegenseitige Anerkennung und transparente Einflussmöglichkeiten bieten. Die Er-gebnisse sprechen gleichzeitig gegen ein pauschales Berufsfeldvotum, solange die Frage nach der Qualität der jeweiligen Praxis nicht gestellt wird. Als Perspektive verweist die methodisch kontrollierte Supervision auf kommunikative Strategien, die bisherige Denkfiguren aufbrechen und die eigene Berufsentwicklung bewusster machen: Eine selbstreflexive und soziale Hermeneutik bildet ein Instrument, das die kontinuierliche Evaluation des beruflichen Handelns leisten kann. This empirical {{study is}} based on conceptual reforms of teaching education that react on achievements and claims for standards of diverse studies. Out of the named fields of competence here the one is of interest which focuses on the adequate way of operating with changes in school. That includes "new" responsibilities of teachers as the cooperative profiling and self-government of the own school or the evaluation of teaching. Educational sciences look at these expanded tasks as a change in paradigms that is connected with the professional self-understanding and attitude. Questionable is in how far such an attitude can be planned by administration: Social leading ideas as commitment or cooperation can not be adopted "by purpose", but aim largely on implicit knowledge. The work on hand takes this practical knowledge {{with the help of}} Bourdieus theory of action and asks - with a look on profession's desiderates - for if and how teaching education promotes an innovative habitus. Investigated are the competences of professional novices, since those newcomers are identified perpetually as the keepers of hope of an enduring school develop-ment. The study serves an empirical <b>backlog</b> <b>demand</b> and extends the methodology of social sciences. In its focus stands an accompanied seminar concerning a practical school course in which students work supervisory on "own cases", as well as carrying out group discussions. The complex data corpus includes different kinds of texts, observations and surveys. Essential for the qualitative analysis is that the construction of action guiding meanings cannot be looked at as pure mental operation but is socially situated and founded on a collective experience of everyday life. Since this symbolic acting in certain ways occurs intuitively and incor-porated it does not assume any willing agreement. The reconstruction of real study practice proves impressively that in the communication between those who take part in educational training much more "happens" than only the transfer of information. The report identifies institutional influences and shows explicitly the circumstances under which the students fall back on traditional strategies or alternatively try out unfamiliar ones. It also shows that individuals do not separate different fields of action strictly from each other, and even transport basic biographical orientation and conflict patterns into other contexts. The methodology of Grounded Theory (Strauss/Corbin) offers the chance to use multidisciplinary reference matrix for the development of theory. Especially the binding on sociological macro theories as the Reflexive Modernism (Beck, Giddens) delivers a frame to teaching education which breaks with the widely accepted dualism between theory and practice. An appropriate concentration is performed by newer social-psychological concepts of identity (Keupp) and Situated Learning (Lave/Wenger). The core results of the investigation are: firstly, professional development of future teachers is fundamentally affected by individualisation, and secondly, because of this there is a need of control for the professional communities of practice. The study makes clear in opposition to trivial ideas of feasibility in pedagogical curricula how phenomena of individualisation potentate the inherent insecurity of educational work in a certain way: The concepts of training are coined by short time participations, intricate social contexts and pluralistic ideas of value which aggravate a professional orientation. While the problems of decision making and competition increase the relation- and memberships become more fragile. Here the results discover the normative implications of ideal constructions as Learning Organisation and relativize single sided myths of profit like e. g. teamwork, flexibility and risk taking. As a key concept in the way of dealing with insecurity and risk the theory formation emphasizes trust (Luhmann) which isn't given by traditions anymore but must be created actively by the members of the certain institutional systems and requires a specific social ability. Facing the demand for an integrated professional training, forms of participation are needed that propose as well mutual acceptance as transparent possibilities of influence. However in this context the results speak against an all-inclusive vote for more practice as long as the question for its quality isn't asked. As a perspective the methodical controlled supervision refers to communicative strategies which force previous figures of thinking open and create an awareness of the own profession's development: Self-reflexive and social hermeneutics offer an instrument that can achieve a continuous evaluation of professional action...|$|E

40|$|Customers {{across all}} stages of the supply chain often respond {{negatively}} to inventory shortages. One approach to modeling customer responses to shortages in the inventory control literature is time-dependent partial backlogging. Partial backlogging refers to the {{case in which a}} customer will backorder shortages with some probability, or will otherwise solicit the supplier's competitors to fulfill outstanding shortages. If the backorder rate (i. e., the probability that a customer elects to backorder shortages) is assumed to be dependent on the supplier's backorder replenishment lead-time, then shortages are said to be represented as time-dependent partial backlogging. This paper explores various backorder rate functions in a single period stochastic inventory problem in an effort to characterize a diversity of customer responses to shortages. We use concepts from utility theory to formally classify customers in terms of their willingness to wait for the supplier to replenish shortages. Under mild assumptions, we verify the existence of a unique optimal solution that corresponds to each customer type. Sensitivity analysis experiments are conducted in order to compare the optimal actions associated with each customer type under a variety of conditions. Additionally, we introduce the notion of expected value of customer patience information (EVCPI), and then conduct additional sensitivity analyses to determine the most and least opportune conditions for distinguishing between customer behaviors.

These models are usually computationally intractable due to the enormous size of the state space. The expected cost of the dual-balancing policy is guaranteed to be at most twice the optimal expected cost, but until now, no computational testing of the policy has been done. We propose two extended families of policies, based on cost-balancing techniques and myopic-like policies that generate lower and upper bounds on the optimal base-stock levels. We show that cost-balancing techniques combined together with these lower and upper bounds lead to improved policies. The expected cost of the new policies is also guaranteed to be at most twice the optimal expected cost. Nevertheless, empirically their performance is significantly better. Moreover, {{all of the new}} policies can be implemented efficiently in an on-line manner. We have conducted extensive testing of these policies, with demand forecasts that evolve according to the multiplicative MMFE model. The best of the new generation of policies are very robust. They are consistently better than the classical myopic policy over a broad set of important scenarios, and the improvement can get to up to 30 percent.

Shortly after R units are utilized to fulfil the partially <b>backlogged</b> <b>demand,</b> and consequently, the on-hand inventory level becomes S units of which W_ 1 units are stored in OW and the remaining amount ([...] S - W_ 1) units in RW. The inventory level in RW decreases due {{to the need to}} meet the customers’ demand, and also deterioration effect of the item reduces during the time interval [0,t_ 1], and it vanishes at time t = t_ 1. On the other hand, in OW during [0,t_ 1], the inventory level W_ 1 decreases due to deterioration only, and during [t_ 1,t_ 2], it decreases due to resultant effect of deterioration and customers’ demand. At time t = t_ 2, the inventory level in OW becomes zero. Thereafter, the shortages have appeared during the time interval [t_ 2,T], which are accumulated depending on the waiting time-length up to the new lot with a rate [1 + δ (T - t)]^ - 1,δ > 0. The maximum shortage level,R, occurs at time t = T.

40|$|In this paper, a {{realistic}} replenishment model with multiple warehouses (one is primary warehouse (PW) {{from where the}} items are sold and others are secondary warehouses (SWs) where the items are stored) is developed with fuzzy lead-time {{under the assumption that}} the capacities of the warehouses are finite. Inflation and time value of money are taken into account. The items of secondary warehouses are transported to the primary warehouse in continuous release pattern and associated transportation cost is proportional to the distance from PW to SWs. The holding cost of items in SWs has reverse effect with distance. Here, the demand of items is a deterministic function of selling price and the displayed inventory. Deterioration rates of the items are constant and different in different warehouses. The replenishment rate is infinite and the problem is constructed with shortages, which are the mixture of back orders and lost sales. The <b>backlogged</b> <b>demand</b> is assumed to be a function of currently backlogged amount. When an item is out of stock, the loyal and captive customers will wait until the outstanding orders arrive and are served. To compensate the inconvenience of backordering and to secure orders, the supplier may offer a price discount on the stock out item.

Even with no productivity shocks, optimal behavior by the firm is consistent with this stylized fact either if demand exhibits positive serial correlation, or if the firm can <b>backlog</b> excess <b>demand.</b> The reason is that a demand shock affects both the actual inventory level (given unchanged production) and the desired level. Production must replenish the stock and adjust to the new desired level. Copyright 1987 by American Economic Association. ...|$|R
40|$|In many {{real-world}} settings, {{the capacity}} of processing centers is flexible due {{to a variety of}} operational tools (such as overtime, outsourcing, and <b>backlogging</b> <b>demand)</b> available to managers that allow the facility to accept demands in excess of the capacity constraint for short periods of time. However, most capacitated facility location models in the literature today impose hard capacity constraints that don’t capture this short term flexibility. Thus, current capacitated facility location models do not account for the operational costs associated with accepting excess daily demand, which can lead to suboptimal facility location and demand allocation decisions. To address this discrepancy, we consider a processing distribution system in which demand generated on a daily basis by a set of demand sites is satisfied by a set of capacitated processing facilities. At each demand site, daily demands for the entirety of the planning horizon are sampled from a known demand distribution. Thus, the day to day demand fluctuations may result in some days for which the total demand arriving at a processing facility exceeds the processing capacity, even if the average daily demand arriving at the processing facility is less than the daily processing capacity. We allow each processing facility the ability to hold excess <b>demand</b> in <b>backlog</b> to be processed at a later date and assess a corresponding backlog penalty in the objective function for each day a unit of <b>demand</b> is <b>backlogged.</b> This dissertation primarily focuses on three methods of modelling the aforementioned processing distribution system. The first model is the Inventory Modulated Capacitated Location Problem (IMCLP), which utilizes disaggregated daily demand parameters to determine the subset of processing facilities to establish, the allocation of demand sites to processing facilities, and the magnitude of backlog at each facility on each day that minimizes location, travel, and backlogging costs. Whereas the IMCLP assumes each demand site must be allocated to exactly one processing facility, the second model relaxes this assumption and allows demand sites to be allocated to different processing facilities on various days of the week. We show that such a cyclic allocation scheme can further reduce the system costs and improve service metrics as compared to the IMCLP. Finally, while the first two models incorporate daily fluctuations in demand over an extended time horizon, the problems remain deterministic in the sense that only one realization of demand is considered for each day of the planning horizon. As such, our final model presents a stochastic version of the IMCLP in which we assume a known demand distribution but assume the realization of daily demand is uncertain. In addition to assessing a penalty cost, we consider three types of chance constraints to restrict the amount of <b>backlogged</b> <b>demand</b> to a predetermined threshold. Using finite samples of random demand, we propose two multi-stage decomposition schemes and solve the mixed-integer programming reformulations with cutting-plane algorithms. In summary, this dissertation mitigates hard capacity constraints commonly found in facility location models by allowing incoming demand to exceed the processing capacity for short periods of time. In each of the modelling contexts presented, we show that the location and allocation decisions obtained from our models can result in significantly reduced costs and improved service metrics when compared to models that do not account for the likelihood that demands may exceed capacity on some days...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the task of}} coordinated planning of a supply chain (SC). Work in process (WIP) in each facility participating in the SC, finished goods inventory, and <b>backlogged</b> <b>demand</b> costs are minimized over the planning horizon. In addition to the usual modeling of linear material flow balance equations, variable lead time (LT) requirements, resulting from the increasing incremental WIP as a facility's utilization increases, are also modeled. In recognition of the emerging significance of quality of service (QoS), that is control of stockout probability to meet demand on time, maximum stockout probability constraints are also modeled explicitly. Lead time and QoS modeling require incorporation of nonlinear constraints in the production planning optimization process. The quantification of these nonlinear constraints must capture statistics of the stochastic behaviour of production facilities revealed during a time scale for shorter than the customary weekly time scale of the planning process. The apparent computational complexity of planning production against variable LT and QoS constraints has long resulted in MRP-based scheduling practices that ignore the LT and QoS constraints has long resulted in MRP-based scheduling practices that ignore the LT and QoS impact to the plan's detriment. The computational complexity challenge was overcome by proposing and adopting a time-scale decomposition approach to production planning where short-time-scale stochastic dynamics are modeled in multiple facility-specific subproblems that receive tentative targets from a deterministic master problem and return statistics to it. A converging and scalable iterative methodology is implemented, providing evidence that significantly lower cost production plans are achievable in a computationally tractable manner.

40|$|We {{consider}} a single product multistage serial inventory system with several installations, say N - I, [...] ., l. Installation N - I intakes exogenous supply {{of a single}} commodity. For i E {I, [...] . N - 2 }, installation i is supplied by shipments from installation i + 1. Demands for the finished good occur at installation l. Demands that cannot be filled immediately are backlogged. We assume holding costs at each installation which are linear functions of inventory, {{as well as a}} constant cost for each unit of <b>backlogged</b> <b>demand,</b> per period. Clark and Scarf { 1960) showed that over a finite horizon an echelon basestock policy is optimal. Federgruen and Zipkin (1984) extend their result to the infinite-horizon case for both discounted and average costs. We present a new approach to this multistage serial inventory management problem, and give new proofs of these results by introducing and solving a simple Travel Time problem, using Dynamic Programming. This approach is motivated {{by the fact that the}} exact cost-to-go function of the related Travel Time problem can be easily computed using a straightforward recursive procedure (instead of using the typical value iteration or policy iteration methods). Moreover, this cost-to-go function gives various insights useful for a group of more complex multistage inventory problems. In this regard, we discuss how this cost-to-go function can be used to develop good Approximate Dynamic Programming algorithms for a number of complex multistage serial inventory problems. The results obtained suggest that the idea of introducing a related "Travel Time" problem and our algorithm to solve this problem can be used as a building block of a new approach to solve large scale multistage inventory management problems.

Two types of costs are incurred; the holding cost per unit time is assumed to be proportional to the inventory level while the ordering cost is that associated with the multiple set-up cost function (see (3) and Figure 1). By studying a special case (K = 0 in (3)) in § 2, the analysis of the problem practically becomes that of the standard economic lot size model so that we can rigorously derive some not too widely known results about the lot size model while exploring our model.

The behavior of Japanese inventory investment could differ due to such factors as industry inventory management techniques (the "just in time" system), the relative influence of demand versus cost shocks, the relation between the level of output and the convexity (and or concavity) of the production function, and the ability of Japanese firms to successfully <b>backlog</b> unfilled <b>demand.</b> The next section of this paper examines the contribution of inventory investment to economic instability in Japan and compares the results with the U.
