5|$|A {{diagnosis}} of psoriasis is usually {{based on the}} appearance of the skin. Skin characteristics typical for psoriasis are scaly, erythematous plaques, papules, or patches of skin that may <b>be</b> <b>painful</b> and itch. No special blood tests or diagnostic procedures are needed to make the diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|Another rare {{complication}} {{that may}} occur early during warfarin treatment (usually within 3 to 8 weeks of commencement) is purple toe syndrome. This condition is thought to result from small deposits of cholesterol breaking loose and causing embolisms in {{blood vessels in the}} skin of the feet, which causes a blueish purple colour and may <b>be</b> <b>painful.</b>|$|E

5|$|The shock {{delivered}} by the marbled electric ray can <b>be</b> <b>painful</b> but is seldom life-threatening, {{although there is a}} danger of a shocked diver becoming disoriented underwater. Its electrogenic properties have been known since classical antiquity, leading it and other electric fishes to be used in medicine. The ancient Greeks and Romans applied live rays to those afflicted with conditions such as chronic headaches and gout, and recommended that its meat be eaten by epileptics.|$|E
5|$|The shock {{produced}} by the onefin electric ray can <b>be</b> <b>painful,</b> but is not substantially dangerous to humans. Though not utilized economically, this ray is frequently caught as bycatch in bottom trawls in South African waters. Because of its inshore habits, {{it may also be}} negatively affected by water pollution from coastal development. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species as Data Deficient due to lack of specific data, while noting that its vulnerability to fishing and habitat degradation may merit concern.|$|E
5|$|The {{clinical}} features of latrodectism are similar for all species of Latrodectus spiders and is generally characterised by extreme pain. Initially, the bite may <b>be</b> <b>painful,</b> but sometimes only {{feels like a}} pin prick or mild burning sensation. Within an hour victims generally develop more severe local pain with local sweating and sometimes piloerection (goosebumps). Pain, swelling and redness spread proximally from the site. Less commonly, systemic envenoming is heralded by swollen or tender regional lymph nodes; associated features include malaise, nausea, vomiting, abdominal or chest pain, generalised sweating, headache, fever, hypertension and tremor. Rare complications include seizure, coma, pulmonary edema, respiratory failure or localised skin infection. The duration of effects can range from {{a few hours to}} days, with severe pain persisting for over 24 hours after being bitten in some cases.|$|E

5|$|The green-head ant {{possesses}} a highly potent sting that can <b>be</b> <b>painful</b> but is short-lived. An icepack or commercially available spray {{can be used}} to relieve the pain, but individuals experiencing an allergic reaction are normally taken to the hospital for treatment. The venom is powerful enough to cause anaphylactic shock in sensitive humans. In a 2011 Australian ant allergy venom study, of which the objective was to determine what native Australian ants were associated with ant sting anaphylaxis, it was shown that 34 participants reacted to the venom of the green-head ant. The rest of the participants reacted to Myrmecia venom, in particular, 176 to M. pilosula alone. The study concluded that four main groups of Australian ants were responsible for causing anaphylaxis. The green-head ant was the only ant that was not a Myrmecia species to cause allergic reactions in participating individuals. Green-head ants have been reported causing mortality amongst poultry. Despite its potential danger to sensitive humans, green-head ants can be beneficial. They can serve as a form of pest control by killing agricultural pests such as beetle and moth larvae and termites.|$|E

25|$|Plantar warts {{are often}} similar to calluses or corns, {{but can be}} {{differentiated}} by close observation of skin striations. Feet are covered in skin striae, which are akin to fingerprints on the feet. Skin striae go around plantar warts; if the lesion is not a plantar wart, the striations continue across {{the top layer of}} the skin. Plantar warts tend to <b>be</b> <b>painful</b> on application of pressure from either side of the lesion rather than direct pressure, unlike calluses (which tend to <b>be</b> <b>painful</b> on direct pressure instead).|$|E
