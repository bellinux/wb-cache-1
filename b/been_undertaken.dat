5|$|Archaeological {{excavations}} have <b>been</b> <b>undertaken</b> {{in several}} {{locations in the}} Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found. A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage with a mummified cat sealed in the walls, close to Lower Black Moss reservoir near Barley.|$|E
5|$|From {{the early}} 1980s onwards {{projects}} aiming to improve Somerton for film industry purposes have <b>been</b> <b>undertaken.</b> The market square was heavily revamped, creating a central parking area {{with easy access}} to the local amenities. The BBC drama The Monocled Mutineer was filmed in Somerton from 1985 to 1986.|$|E

50|$|The {{site was}} first {{reported}} in 1926 by archaeologist Gustavo Espinoza, although no serious investigations <b>were</b> <b>undertaken</b> until 1943. Projects to partially map the site <b>were</b> <b>undertaken</b> in 2001 and 2013.|$|R
5|$|Since 2000, archaeological {{investigations}} have <b>been</b> <b>undertaken</b> {{to find out}} more about the vessels and their states of decay. Explanatory labels have been provided. One barge has been scheduled as an ancient monument and several are included in the National Register of Historic Vessels.|$|E
5|$|Statistical {{analysis}} has <b>been</b> <b>undertaken</b> {{on several occasions}} to try to ascertain the authorship question based on word frequencies and writing styles. Nearly all of the statistical {{studies show that the}} disputed papers were written by Madison, although a computer science study theorizes the papers were a collaborative effort.|$|E
5|$|The line {{is located}} in the Exmoor National Park, and funds have been made {{available}} for conservation through the Heritage Lottery Fund and other sources.

5|$|Vegetation in the Andes {{varies with}} elevation. Above 1,600meters (5,249ft) {{the slopes of}} {{mountains}} are covered by Alpine-like steppe, while below there are zones of Nothofagus forest, Hygrophilous forest, Sclerophylous forest, and matorral. The number of plant species is likely to exceed 2,000, although no comprehensive study of the flora of Central Chile has <b>been</b> <b>undertaken.</b>|$|E
5|$|Censuses have <b>been</b> <b>undertaken</b> in Jersey since 1821. In the 2011 census, {{the total}} {{resident}} population {{was estimated to}} be 97,857, of whom 34% live in Saint Helier, the island's only town. Only half the island's population was born in Jersey; 31% of the population were born elsewhere in the British Isles, 7% in continental Portugal or Madeira, 8% in other European countries and 4% elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Geographical name {{changes in}} Turkey have <b>been</b> <b>undertaken,</b> periodically, in bulk from 1913 {{to the present}} by {{successive}} Turkish governments. Thousands of names within the Turkish Republic or the Ottoman Empire have lost or departed from their popular or historic alternatives in favour of recognizably Turkish names, {{as part of the}} Turkification policy. The governments have argued that such names are foreign and/or divisive against Turkish unity. Names changed were usually of Armenian, Greek, Georgian (Including Laz), Bulgarian, Kurdish, Assyrian, or Arabic origin.|$|E

5|$|Having fallen {{somewhat}} into disrepair, {{the structure}} {{came under the}} care of the Banagher Branch of the Offaly Historical Society in the 1980s and considerable restoration work has <b>been</b> <b>undertaken</b> since then. The Canal Bank on which it stands, is the property of the people of Banagher and is held in trust as a public amenity. Considerable works around the castle have also taken place and the castle, park and riverside walk are open to the public.|$|E
5|$|Hundreds of news {{trucks and}} members of the press arrived at the site to cover the story. The press {{immediately}} noticed that the bombing took place on the second anniversary of the Waco incident. Many initial news stories hypothesized the attack had <b>been</b> <b>undertaken</b> by Islamic terrorists, such as those who had masterminded the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. Some responded to these reports by attacking Muslims and people of Arab descent.|$|E
5|$|If Echmarcach was {{a member}} of the Waterford dynasty, his action against Sitriuc may have <b>been</b> <b>undertaken</b> in the context of {{continuous}} dynastic strife between Dublin and Waterford in the tenth- and eleventh centuries. This could mean that Echmarcach's expulsion of Sitriuc was a direct act of vengeance for the latter's slaying of Ragnall ua Ímair (then King of Waterford) the year before.|$|E

5|$|Several rare {{butterflies}} are {{indigenous to}} the area, including the nationally scarce pearl-bordered fritillary (Boloria euphrosyne), Duke of Burgundy (Hamearis lucina), and white-letter hairstreak (Satyrium w-album). The {{large blue butterfly}} (Maculinea arion) became extinct in the hills in the late 1970s, since when a research project has <b>been</b> <b>undertaken</b> into its ecology and reintroduction. The white-clawed crayfish is also nationally rare and is a declining species with small populations in {{a tributary of the}} Mells River and the River Chew.|$|E
5|$|Since 1991, Fremantle Prison {{has been}} conserved as a {{recognised}} heritage site, and various restoration works have <b>been</b> <b>undertaken.</b> New uses {{have been found}} for some buildings within the prison, which has also become a significant tourist attraction. The process of obtaining World Heritage listing {{as part of the}} Australian Convict Sites submission focused historical interpretation and conservation efforts on the prison's convict era (18501886), at the expense of its more recent history, including Aboriginal prisoners held there.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the house}} passed to the National Trust in 1972, major works of {{restoration}} and re-creation have <b>been</b> <b>undertaken</b> {{and a number of}} pieces of Burges furniture, mostly not original to the house, are displayed. These include a bookcase from Buckingham Street and a chimney piece from the Hall at Worcester College, Oxford, where, in the 1960s, some decorative works by Burges were removed, although his redecoration of the college Chapel remains. The aim is, as far as possible, to reinstate the work of Burges and Crace.|$|E

5|$|The {{finished}} road, {{while an}} improvement over the previous route, still was {{not much more than}} a track, and remained such throughout the 1940s and 1950s. Efforts to seal the highway began in Norseman in 1960, with the Western Australian section completed in 1969 and the South Australian section finished in 1976. Further improvement works have <b>been</b> <b>undertaken</b> since the 1980s, including widening and reconstructing portions of the road.|$|E
5|$|The first British {{airborne}} landing was Operation Ladbroke, {{which was}} carried out by the 1st Airlanding Brigade, under Brigadier Philip Hicks, during the night of 9–10 July.

The second British airborne mission, Operation Glutton, was to have <b>been</b> <b>undertaken</b> by the 2nd Parachute Brigade, under Brigadier Ernest Down, on the night of 10–11 July, aiming to capture a bridge beside Augusta. However circumstances changed and the second operation was cancelled.|$|E
5|$|The first stealth liposomes were passively {{targeted}} at tumor tissues. Because tumors induce rapid and uncontrolled angiogenesis they are especially “leaky” and allow liposomes {{to exit the}} bloodstream {{at a much higher}} rate than normal tissue would. More recently work has <b>been</b> <b>undertaken</b> to graft antibodies or other molecular markers onto the liposome surface in the hope of actively binding them to a specific cell or tissue type. Some examples of this approach are already in clinical trials.|$|E
