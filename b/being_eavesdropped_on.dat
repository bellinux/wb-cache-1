40|$|We {{propose a}} new {{framework}} {{for determining the}} wiretap code rates of single-input single-output multi-antenna eavesdropper (SISOME) wiretap channels when {{the capacity of the}} eavesdropper's channel is not available at the transmitter. In our framework we introduce the effective secrecy throughput (EST) as a new performance metric that explicitly captures the two key features of wiretap channels, namely, reliability and secrecy. Notably, the EST measures the average rate of the confidential information transmitted from the transmitter to the intended receiver without <b>being</b> <b>eavesdropped</b> <b>on.</b> We provide easy-to-implement methods to determine the wiretap code rates for two transmission schemes: 1) adaptive transmission scheme in which the capacity of the main channel is available at the transmitter and 2) fixed-rate transmission scheme in which the capacity of the main channel is not available at the transmitter. Such determinations are further extended into an absolute-passive eavesdropping scenario where even the average signal-to-noise ratio of the eavesdropper's channel is not available at the transmitter. Notably, our solutions for the wiretap code rates do not require us to set reliability or secrecy constraints for the transmission within wiretap channels.

40|$|Based on an EPR pair of qubits and {{allowing}} asymptotically secure key distribution, a secure communication protocol is presented. Bob sends {{either of the}} EPR pair qubits to Alice. Alice receives the travel qubit. Then she can encode classical information by local unitary operations on this travel qubit. Alice send the qubit back to Bob. Bob can get Alice’s information by measurement on the two photons in Bell operator basis. If Eve in line, she has no access to Bob’s home qubit. All her operations are restricted to the travel qubit. In order {{to find out which}} opeartion Alice performs, Eve’s operation must include measurements. The EPR pair qubits are destroyed. Bob’s measurement on the two photons in Bell operator basis can help him to judge whether Eve exist in line or not. In this protocal, a public channel is not necessary. PACS numbers: 03. 67. Hk, 03. 65. Ud, 03. 67. Dd The idea of quantum cryptography was first proposed in the 1970 s by Stephen Wiesner [1] and by Charles H. Bennett of IBM and Gilles Brassard of The University of Montreal [5]. The motive that we build quantum-mechanical communications channels is not only to transmit information securely without <b>being</b> <b>eavesdropped</b> <b>on</b> but also to transmit information more efficiently. We consider that quantum channel is secure because that quantum physics establishes a set of negative rules stating things that cannot be done [2]: (1) One cannot take a measurement withou...|$|E

40|$|Most {{territorial}} songbirds live {{in communication}} networks where <b>eavesdropping</b> <b>on</b> vocal interactions may constitute an important option for gathering {{information regarding the}} relative dominance, condition and quality of individuals <b>being</b> <b>eavesdropped</b> upon. The relatively low costs and risks of eavesdropping, together with the obvious advantages of gaining such comparative information about other individuals, predict eavesdropping to be a widespread phenomenon {{even though it is}} not necessarily advantageous for the participants to be eavesdropped upon. Special eavesdropper strategies that facilitate eavesdropping (how best to eavesdrop) may therefore have evolved together with strategies for interacting that either co-facilitate (public signaling) or counter eavesdropping directly (private signaling) or indirectly by preventing any subsequent negative consequences of <b>being</b> <b>eavesdropped</b> upon (anonymity). This paper reviews the predictions for the strategies and also gives examples supporting their use by territorial songbirds in connection with vocal interactions...|$|R
25|$|When the United States later {{took control}} of Japan's South in World War II, Japanese {{officials}} tactically sought to exploit Kagoshima's more northern position, its advancement in shipping technology, and most notably the Satsugū dialect's mutual unintelligibility {{as a method of}} cryptographic communication between Japan and Germany. Dozens of international phone calls had been made using the Satsugū dialect, and despite <b>being</b> able to <b>eavesdrop</b> <b>on</b> the conversations <b>being</b> sent back and forth, the United States was unable to determine the language spoken. The use of the Satsugū dialect to further obfuscate communication during both the Second World War and possibly the period of the earlier Satsuma Domain has led to a popular belief that Satsugū was created as an artificial language and promoted for the purpose of being unintelligible in order to thwart enemy spies.|$|R
25|$|Operation Nifty Package was an {{operation}} launched by Navy SEALs to prevent Noriega's escape. They sank Noriega's boat and destroyed his jet, {{at a cost}} of four killed and nine wounded. Military operations continued for several weeks, mainly against military units of the Panamanian army. Noriega remained at large for several days, but realizing he had few options {{in the face of a}} massive manhunt and a $1 million reward for his capture, he obtained refuge in the Vatican diplomatic mission in Panama City. The U.S. military's psychological pressure on him and diplomatic pressure on the Vatican mission, however, was relentless, as was the playing of loud rock-and-roll music day and night in a densely populated area. The report of the Office of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff maintains that the music was used principally to prevent parabolic microphones from <b>being</b> used to <b>eavesdrop</b> <b>on</b> negotiations, and not as a psychological weapon based around Noriega's supposed loathing of rock music. Noriega finally surrendered to the U.S. military on 3 January 1990. He was immediately put on an MC-130E Combat Talon I aircraft and flown to the U.S.|$|R

40|$|Animals often gather {{information}} from other species by <b>eavesdropping</b> <b>on</b> signals intended for others. We review the extent, benefits, mechanisms, and ecological and evolutionary consequences of <b>eavesdropping</b> <b>on</b> other species 2 ̆ 7 alarm calls. Eavesdropping {{has been shown}} experimentally in about 70 vertebrate species, and can entail closely or distantly related species. The benefits of eavesdropping include prompting immediate anti-predator responses, indirect enhancement of foraging or changed habitat use, and learning about predators. <b>Eavesdropping</b> <b>on</b> heterospecifics can provide more eyes looking for danger, complementary information to that from conspecifics, and potentially information at reduced cost. The response to heterospecific calls can be unlearned or learned. Unlearned responses occur when heterospecific calls have acoustic features {{similar to that used}} to recognize conspecific calls, or acoustic properties such as harsh sounds that prompt attention and may allow recognition or facilitate learning. Learning to recognize heterospecific alarm calls is probably essential to allow recognition of the diversity of alarm calls, but the evidence is largely indirect. The value of <b>eavesdropping</b> <b>on</b> different species is affected by problems of signal interception and the relevance of heterospecific alarm calls to the listener. These constraints <b>on</b> <b>eavesdropping</b> will affect how information flows among species and thus affect community function. Some species are 2 ̆ 7 keystone 2 ̆ 7 information producers, while others largely seek information, and these differences probably affect the formation and function of mixed-species groups. Eavesdroppers might also integrate alarm calls from multiple species to extract relevant and reliable information. Eavesdropping appears to {{set the stage for the}} evolution of interspecific deception and communication, and potentially affects communication within species. Overall, we now know that <b>eavesdropping</b> <b>on</b> heterospecific alarm calls is an important source of information for many species across the globe, and there are ample opportunities for research on mechanisms, fitness consequences and implications for community function and signalling evolution...|$|R
