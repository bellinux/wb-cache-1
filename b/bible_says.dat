5|$|The {{theological}} {{concerns were}} twofold: first, putting {{man at the}} same level as monkeys or apes would lower the spiritually higher position that man was assumed to have in the great chain of being, and second, because the <b>Bible</b> <b>says</b> man was created in the image of God (theomorphism), if monkeys/apes and humans were not distinctly and separately designed, that would mean monkeys and apes were created in the image of God as well. This was something many could not accept. The conflict between world views that was caused by asserting man was a type of animal would simmer for a century until the much greater, and still ongoing, creation–evolution controversy began in earnest with the publication of On the Origin of Species by Charles Darwin in 1859.|$|E
5|$|The only extant {{pieces of}} the Consolatio are fragments, of which seven were {{preserved}} by the early Christian author Lactantius in his work Divinarum Institutionum (The Divine Institutes). In the work, Lactantius used the excerpt from the Consolatio both {{to point out the}} futility of paganism, as well as to argue that pagans actually accept some tenets of Christianity, without them even realizing it. Lactantius criticized what Cicero wrote, but also applauded Cicero for paralleling—albeit coincidentally—what the <b>Bible</b> <b>says</b> at times. However, the quotes preserved by Lactantius have been criticized due to their lack of context. MacKendrick notes that Lactantius was using partial quotations in order to frame what Cicero wrote so that Lactantius could more easily refute his ideas. Other excerpts from the Consolatio were preserved by Cicero himself, of which two sections were quoted by him in his Tusculanae Disputationes.|$|E

During this battle, Ahab {{disguised}} himself, but he was mortally wounded by an unaimed arrow (1 Kings 22). The Hebrew <b>Bible</b> <b>says</b> that dogs licked his blood, according to the prophecy of Elijah. But the Septuagint (the Greek translation of the Old Testament) adds that pigs also licked his blood, symbolically making him unclean to the Israelites, who abstained from pork. Ahab was succeeded by his sons, Ahaziah and Jehoram.|$|E
25|$|The Egyptians {{had begun}} {{agitating}} peoples within the Assyrian empire {{in an attempt}} to gain a foothold in the region. As a result, in 701 BC, Hezekiah of Judah, Lule king of Sidon, Sidka, king of Ascalon and the king of Ekron formed an alliance with Egypt against Assyria. Sennacherib attacked the rebels, conquering Ascalon, Sidon and Ekron and defeating the Egyptians and driving them from the region. He marched toward Jerusalem, destroying 46 towns and villages (including the heavily defended city of Lachish) in his path. This is graphically described in Isaiah 10; exactly what happened next is unclear (the <b>Bible</b> <b>says</b> an angel of the Lord killed 185,000 Assyrian soldiers at Jerusalem after Hezekiah prayed in the temple). Sennacherib's account says Judah paid him tribute and he left.|$|E
25|$|He says {{religion}} has always stopped the philosophers and scientists from gaining knowledge because the Christian religion {{is opposed to}} any knowledge that differs from Biblical knowledge. Hedgel is indifferent to what the <b>Bible</b> <b>says.</b> He writes in his Philosophy of Religion If at the present day philosophy be an object of enmity because it occupies itself with religion, this cannot really surprise us {{when we consider the}} general character of the time. Every one who attempts to take to do with the knowledge of God, and by the aid of thought to comprehend His nature, must be prepared to find, that either no attention will be paid to him, or that people will turn against him and combine to oppose him. The more the knowledge of finite things has increased and the increase is so great that the extension of the sciences has become almost boundless, and all regions of knowledge are enlarged to an extent which makes a comprehensive view impossible so much the more has the sphere of the knowledge of God become contracted.|$|E

The children were {{under the care of}} a nurse, Sara Wager, who instilled in them not only polite manners and good behaviour but also liberal social and philosophical opinions. Such views were consistent with the progressive-minded tradition of both sides of the family. When the young Vaughan Williams asked his mother about Darwin's controversial book On the Origin of Species, she answered, [...] "The <b>Bible</b> <b>says</b> that God made the world in six days.

Here he delivered three talks, each garnering an attendance in the thousands, based not only on his views of Christianity and homosexuality, but also on human sexuality in general and the rights of LGBT members of society. The three talks were entitled [...] "Homosexuality: What the <b>Bible</b> <b>says</b> & why it matters", [...] "Keeping your cool in the eye of the storm" [...] and [...] "Sexuality and spirituality: keeping them together".
