60|$|The {{shepherd}} on {{the east}} hill could shout out lambing intelligence to the shepherd on the west hill, over the intervening town chimneys, without great inconvenience to his voice, so nearly did the steep pastures encroach upon the burghers' backyards.

60|$|He had traversed {{but little}} of that black thoroughfare, holding his lanthorn {{at the level of}} his breast, when the sound of a splash and cries for help smote his long, thin ears. Remembering how the Captain of the Watch had admonished him, he stopped and peered about, but owing to his {{proximity}} to the light of his own lanthorn he saw nothing. Presently he heard another splash and the sound of <b>blowings</b> and of puffings, but still unable to see clearly whence they came, he was forced in bewilderment to resume his march. But he had no sooner entered the next bend of that obscure and winding avenue than the most lamentable, lusty cries assailed him. Again he stood still, blinded by his own light. Somewhere at hand a citizen was being beaten, for vague, quick-moving forms emerged into the radiance of his lanthorn out of the deep violet of the night air. The cries swelled, and died away, and swelled; and the mazed Cethru moved forward on his way. But very {{near the end of his}} first traversage, the sound of a long, deep sighing, as of a fat man in spiritual pain, once more arrested him.|$|E
40|$|IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT CRANIAL MURMURS OR SO CALLED "BRUITS" MAY BE RARELY HEARDBY PLACING THE STETHOSCOPE OVER THE SKULL AND EYEBALLS, ESPECIALLY IN CHILDREN. THE NATURE AND SIGNIFICANCE OF THESE "BRUITS", WERE MUCH DISCUSSED IN THE PAST AND HAVE BEEN EXPRESSED IN MOST CASES CONTROVERSIAL VIEWS. IN THE PRESENT STUDY OF 2000 CHILDREN, CRANIAL "BRUITS", BEST HEARD OVER THE LEFT EYEBALL, WERE DETECTED IN 79, OUT OF WHICH 66 WERE DUE TO ANAEMIA AND ONE TO ARTERIOVENOUS FISTULA, SIX WERE FOUND IN NORMAL CHILDREN, 5 IN EPILEPTICS AND ONE IN A CHILD WITH BENIGN INTRACRANIAL HYPERTENSION. CEREBRAL ANGIOGRAPHY WAS PERFORMEDIN SOME OF THESE CHILDREN AND THE RESULTS WERE CORRELATED WITH THE CLINICAL FINDINGS.

60|$|Away {{off to the}} northward Cape Jerimo reared its black, forbidding {{head like}} some huge monster rising from the deep. The winter's snow, not yet entirely {{dissipated}} by the sun, covered it in patches of glistening white, over which the light wind swept on its way out to sea. Huge gulls rose slowly, fluttering their wings in the light breeze and striking their webbed feet {{on the surface of}} the water for over half a mile before they could leave it. Hardly had the patter, patter died away when a flock of sea quail rose, and with whistling wings flew away to windward, where members of a large band of whales were disporting themselves, their <b>blowings</b> sounding like the exhaust of steam engines. The harsh, discordant cries of a sea-parrot grated unpleasantly on the ear, and set half a dozen alert in a small band of seals that were ahead of us. Away they went, breaching and jumping entirely out of water. A sea-gull with slow, deliberate flight and long, majestic curves circled round us, and as a reminder of home a little English sparrow perched impudently on the fo'castle head, and, cocking his head on one side, chirped merrily. The boats were soon among the seals, and the bang! bang! of the guns could be heard from down to leeward.|$|E
60|$|During these {{hours of}} weary and awful suspense, the discourse, between the watchers, though {{conducted}} in tones of confidence, and often of tenderness, {{was broken by}} long intervals of deep and musing silence. Each forbore to dwell upon the danger of their situation, in consideration of {{the feelings of the}} rest; but neither could conceal the imminent risk they ran, from that jealous watchfulness of love of life which was common to them all. In this manner, minutes, hours, and the day itself, rolled by, and the darkness was seen stealing along the deep, gradually narrowing the boundary of their view towards the east, until the whole of the empty scene was limited to a little dusky circle around the spot on which they lay. To this change succeeded another fearful hour, during which it appeared that death was about to visit them, environed by its most revolting horrors. The heavy plunge of the wallowing whale, as he cast his huge form up{{on the surface of the}} sea, was heard, accompanied by the mimic <b>blowings</b> of a hundred imitators, that followed in the train of the monarch of the ocean. It appeared to the alarmed and feverish imagination of Gertrude, that the brine was giving up all its monsters; and, notwithstanding the calm assurances of Wilder, that these accustomed sounds were rather the harbingers of peace than signs of any new danger, they filled her mind with images of the secret recesses over which they seemed suspended by a thread, and painted them replete with the disgusting inhabitants of the caverns of the great deep. The intelligent seaman himself was startled, when he saw, on the surface of the water, the dark fins of the voracious shark stealing around the wreck, apprised, by his instinct, that the contents of the devoted vessel were shortly to become the prey of his tribe. Then came the moon, with its mild and deceptive light, to throw the delusion of its glow on the varying but ever frightful scene.|$|E
6000|$|She {{had evidently}} been the wit and joy {{of a large}} circle of schoolfellows, and this style had become a second nature with her. It made her very {{delightful}} to me in that quiet place. Her customary walk even {{had a sort of}} hello! in it. Her chief preoccupation in life was, I believe, to make my uncle laugh, and when by some new nickname, some new quaintness or absurdity, she achieved that end, she was, behind a mask of sober amazement, the happiest woman on earth. My uncle's laugh when it did come, I must admit was, as Baedeker says, [...] "rewarding." [...] It began with gusty <b>blowings</b> and snortings, and opened into a clear [...] "Ha ha!" [...] but in fullest development it included, in those youthful days, falling about anyhow and doubling up tightly, and whackings of the stomach, and tears and cries of anguish. I never in my life heard my uncle laugh to his maximum except at her; he was commonly too much in earnest for that, and he didn't laugh much at all, to my knowledge, after those early years. Also she threw things at him to an enormous extent in her resolve to keep things lively in spite of Wimblehurst; sponges out of stock she threw, cushions, balls of paper, clean washing, bread; and once up the yard when they thought that I and the errand boy and the diminutive maid of all work were safely out of the way, she smashed a boxful of eight-ounce bottles I had left to drain, assaulting my uncle with a new soft broom. Sometimes she would shy things at me--but not often. There seemed always laughter round and about her--all three of us would share hysterics at times--and on one occasion the two of them came home from church shockingly ashamed of themselves, because of a storm of mirth during the sermon. The vicar, it seems, had tried to blow his nose with a black glove as well as the customary pocket-handkerchief. And afterwards she had picked up her own glove by the finger, and looking innocently but intently sideways, had suddenly by this simple expedient exploded my uncle altogether. We had it all over again at dinner.|$|E
6000|$|He had {{the cabin}} {{arranged}} {{in accordance with}} his simple ideal of comfort at sea. A big bookcase (he was a great reader) occupied {{one side of his}} stateroom; the portrait of his late wife, a flat bituminous oil-painting representing the profile and one long black ringlet of a young woman, faced his bed-place. Three chronometers ticked him to sleep and greeted him on waking with the tiny competition of their beats. He rose at five every day. The officer of the morning watch, drinking his early cup of coffee aft by the wheel, would hear through the wide orifice of the copper ventilators all the splashings, <b>blowings,</b> and splutterings of his captain's toilet. These noises would be followed by a sustained deep murmur of the Lord's Prayer recited in a loud earnest voice. Five minutes afterwards the head and shoulders of Captain Whalley emerged out of the companion-hatchway. Invariably he paused for a while on the stairs, looking all round at the horizon; upwards at the trim of the sails; inhaling deep draughts of the fresh air. Only then he would step out on the poop, acknowledging the hand raised to the peak of the cap with a majestic and benign [...] "Good morning to you." [...] He walked the deck till eight scrupulously. Sometimes, not above twice a year, he had to use a thick cudgel-like stick on account of a stiffness in the hip--a slight touch of rheumatism, he supposed. Otherwise he knew nothing of the ills of the flesh. At the ringing of the breakfast bell he went below to feed his canaries, wind up the chronometers, and take the head of the table. From there he had before his eyes the big carbon photographs of his daughter, her husband, and two fat-legged babies --his grandchildren--set in black frames into the maplewood bulkheads of the cuddy. After breakfast he dusted the glass over these portraits himself with a cloth, and brushed the oil painting of his wife with a plumate kept suspended from a small brass hook {{by the side of the}} heavy gold frame. Then with the door of his stateroom shut, he would sit down on the couch under the portrait to read a chapter out of a thick pocket Bible--her Bible. But on some days he only sat there for half an hour with his finger between the leaves and the closed book resting on his knees. Perhaps he had remembered suddenly how fond of boat-sailing she used to be.|$|E
60|$|I {{fear that}} the Crown did {{not get out of}} John Eames an {{adequate}} return for his salary on that day. So adequate, however, had been the return given by him for some time past, that promotion was supposed throughout the Income-tax Office to be coming in his way, much to the jealousy of Cradell, Fisher, and others, his immediate compeers and cronies. And the place assigned to him by rumour was one which was generally regarded as a perfect Elysium upon earth in the Civil Service world. He was, so rumour said, to become private secretary to the First Commissioner. He would be removed by such a change as this from the large uncarpeted room in which he at present sat; occupying the same desk with another man to whom he had felt himself to be ignominiously bound, as dogs must feel when they are coupled. This room had been the bear-garden of the office. Twelve or fourteen men sat in it. Large pewter pots were brought into it daily at one o'clock, giving it an air that was not aristocratic. The senior of the room, one Mr Love, who was presumed to have it under his immediate dominion, was a clerk of the ancient stamp, dull, heavy, unambitious, living out on the farther side of Islington, and unknown beyond the limits of his office to any of his younger brethren. He was generally regarded as having given a bad tone to the room. And then the clerks in this room would not unfrequently be blown up,--with very palpable <b>blowings</b> up,--by an official swell, a certain chief clerk, named Kissing, much higher in standing though younger in age than the gentleman of whom we have before spoken. He would hurry in, out of his own neighbouring chamber, with quick step and nose in the air, shuffling in his office slippers, looking on each occasion as though there were some cause to {{fear that the}} whole Civil Service were coming to an abrupt termination, and would lay about him with hard words, which some of those in the big room did not find it very easy to bear. His hair was always brushed straight up, his eyes were always very wide open,--and he usually carried a big letter-book with him, keeping in it a certain place with his finger. This book was almost too much for his strength, and he would flop it down, now on this man's desk and now on that man's, and in along career of such floppings had made himself to be very much hated. On the score of some old grudge he and Mr Love did not speak to each other; and for this reason, on all occasions of fault-finding, the blown-up young man would refer Mr Kissing to his enemy.|$|E
60|$|But {{to refer}} this Discourse of Animals to their proper places, I shall add, that though one should suppose, or {{it should be}} prov'd by Observations; that several {{of these kinds of}} Plants are accidentally produc'd by a casual purifaction, I see not any great reason to question, but that, {{notwithstanding}} its own production was as 'twere casual, yet it may germinate and produce seed, and by it propagate its own, that is, a new Species. For we do not know, but that the Omnipotent and All-wise Creator might as directly design the structure of such a Vegetable, or such an Animal to be produc'd out of such or such a putrifaction or change of this or that body, towards the constitution or structure of which, he knew it necessary, or thought it fit to make it an ingredient; as that the digestion or moderate heating of an Egg, either by the Female, or the Sun, or the heat of the Fire, or the like, should produce this or that Bird; or that Putrifactive and warm steams should, out of the <b>blowings,</b> as they call them, that is, the Eggs of a Flie, produce a living Magot, and that, by degrees, be turn'd into an Aurelia, and that, by a longer and a proportion'd heat, be transmuted into a Fly. Nor need we therefore to suppose it the more imperfect in its kind, then the more compounded Vegetable or Animal of which it is a part; for he might as compleatly furnish it with all kinds of contrivances necessary for its own existence, and the propagation of its own Species, and yet make it a part of a more compounded body: as a Clock-maker might make a Set of Chimes {{to be a part of}} a Clock, and yet, when the watch part or striking part are taken away, and the hindrances of its motion remov'd, this chiming part may go as accurately, and strike its tune as exactly, as if it were still a part of the compounded Automaton. So, though the original cause, or seminal principle from which this minute Plant on Rose leaves did spring; were, before the corruption caus'd by the Mill-dew, a component part of the leaf on which it grew, and did serve as a coagent in the production and constitution of it, yet might it be so consummate, as to produce a seed which might have a power of propagating the same species: the works of the Creator seeming of such an excellency, that though they are unable to help to the perfecting of the more compounded existence of the greater Plant or Animal, they may have notwithstanding an ability of acting singly upon their own internal principle, so as to produce a Vegetable body, though of a less compounded nature, and to proceed so farr in the method of other Vegetables, as to bear flowers and seeds, which may be capabale of propagating the like. So that the little cases which appear to grow on the top of the slender stalks, may, for ought I know, though I should suppose them to spring from the perverting of the usual course of the parent Vegetable, contain a seed, which, being scatter'd on other leaves of the same Plant, may produce a Plant of much the same kind.|$|E

The desingularization of the ideal can be made such that one can justify that the local centers patch together to give global centers. This method leads to a proof that is relatively simpler to present, compared to Hironaka's original proof, which uses the Hilbert-Samuel function as the measure of how bad singularities are. For example, the proofs in , , , and [...] use this idea. However, this method only ensures centers of <b>blowings</b> up that are regular in W.|$|E
5000|$|One {{critical}} control room scenario was breaching of the ship’s submerged operating envelope due to deep depth, high speed and stern plane malfunction.

Close monitoring of inclinometers and accelerometers followed to determine reversal of the ship's descent towards crush depth. Next, precise timing for Emergency <b>blowings</b> and venting selective ballast tanks was required together with rapid changes in forward and reverse propulsion. Stabilization of buoyancy with minimal speed was needed at shallower depth to hover for repair to the control surfaces.|$|E

40|$|Building on {{the work}} of the fourth author in math. AG/ 9904074, we prove the weak {{factorization}} conjecture for birational maps in characteristic zero: a birational map between complete nonsingular varieties over an algebraically closed field K of characteristic zero is a composite of <b>blowings</b> up and <b>blowings</b> down with smooth centers. Such a factorization exists which is functorial with respect to absolute isomorphisms, and compatible with a normal crossings divisor. The same holds for algebraic and analytic spaces. Another proof of the main theorem by the fourth author appeared in math. AG/ 9904076. Comment: The previous versions of this paper used Morelli's algorithm for strong factorization of toric birational maps, in which a gap was recently found by K. Karu. In this version we rely only on weak factorization of toric birational maps (due to Wlodarczyk and Morelli). The results remain the sam...|$|E
40|$|We {{show that}} any {{toroidal}} DM stack X with finite diagonalizable inertia possesses a maximal toroidal coarsening X_tcs {{such that the}} morphism X→ X_tcs is logarithmically smooth. Further, we use torification results of [AT 17] to construct a destackification functor, {{a variant of the}} main result of Bergh [Ber 17], on the category of such toroidal stacks X. Namely, we associate to X a sequence of <b>blowings</b> up of toroidal stacks F_X Y⟶ X such that Y_tc coincides with the usual coarse moduli space Y_cs. In particular, this provides a toroidal resolution of the algebraic space X_cs. Both X_tcs and F_X are functorial with respect to strict inertia preserving morphisms X'→ X. Finally, we use coarsening morphisms to introduce a class of non-representable birational modifications of toroidal stacks called Kummer <b>blowings</b> up. These modifications, as well as our version of destackification, are used in our work on functorial toroidal resolution of singularities. Comment: 29 page...|$|E

40|$|In {{recent years}} attempts, {{have been made}} in Europe and North America to improve seed {{laboratory}} machines used for the separation of chaff from heavy seeds in grasses. The most important European contribution is probably the Gilchrist seed separator 2 ̆ 2 used at the seed testing station in Edinburgh, Scotland. The Holland (Leendertz) separator has some merit, but its chief weakness as shown by Porter (7) was the inconstant speed of the motor which made it. impossible to deliver the same volume of air through the separator tube each time the valve was opened to a given point. Replacement of the motor by one that operated at constant speed was found by Brown and Porter (1) to correct the defect reasonably well. The use of bolting cloth in place of a metal screen is also a disadvantage. Following the initial work Porter (8) described a new seed separator equipped with a combined motor 2 ̆ 7 and fan unit of standard specifications which made uniform separations of bluegrass, redtop and orchard grass samples either by repeated <b>blowings</b> of the same sub-sample or by a single blowing for each of many replicate sub-samples. He also employed synthetic samples to check the accuracy and uniformity of separation. These results were obtained with samples from the same lot and indicated that for any given lot of seed it was possible to obtain uniform results if care was used in reading the dial opening on the valve or the manometer which indicated pressure in the compression chamber. It is noteworthy that in his experiments Porter (8) showed that if the weight of sample varied from 112 to 2 grams of blue- 2 ̆ 7 grass seed, the dial reading was more dependable than pressure as measured in the compression chamber, and further that pressure as measured in the blowing tube was about as reliable as the dial reading. He showed, however, that with samples having a low weight per bushel the amount of germinable seed removed at a given opening was greater than with samples having a high weight per bushel...|$|E
