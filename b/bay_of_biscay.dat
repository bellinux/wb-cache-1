5|$|Despite {{the end of}} {{the third}} and final air {{offensive}} over the <b>Bay</b> <b>of</b> <b>Biscay,</b> patrols continued until the liberation of France. The <b>Bay</b> <b>of</b> <b>Biscay</b> patrol statistics for the period 1 May to 2 August 1943, show Coastal Command had flown for 32,343 hours and lost 57 aircraft to all causes, sinking 28 U-boats and damaging 22. From 3 August 1943 to 31 May 1944, it flew 114,290 hours, losing 123 aircraft to all causes, and sinking 12 U-boats and damaging ten more.|$|E
5|$|A {{squadron}} {{commanded by}} Admiral Pierre Vanstabel was dispatched to Hampton Roads to provide escort. Vanstabel {{would bring the}} convoy to the <b>Bay</b> <b>of</b> <b>Biscay,</b> where a second squadron under Joseph-Marie Nielly would reinforce him {{for the rest of}} the journey. Together, these officers mustered six ships of the line and numerous smaller craft. The main French battlefleet of 25 ships under Admiral Villaret de Joyeuse would cruise the <b>Bay</b> <b>of</b> <b>Biscay</b> in order to challenge the British Channel Fleet if it attempted to intercept the supplies. The convoy's passage was expected to take approximately two months, and it included 117 merchant ships carrying enough food to feed France for a year.|$|E
5|$|Continuing {{with her}} patrol, U-43 {{attacked}} Convoy 14-BS in the <b>Bay</b> <b>of</b> <b>Biscay,</b> and sank the 4,374 ton French merchant ship Arijon on 22 November. Convoy escorts counter-attacked with 23 depth charges, but U-43 escaped without damage.|$|E
60|$|Mr Bunsby, who had {{a musical}} ear, {{suddenly}} bellowed, 'In the <b>Bays</b> <b>of</b> <b>Biscay,</b> O!' which so affected the good Captain, as an appropriate tribute to departed worth, that he shook him by the hand in acknowledgment, and was fain to wipe his eyes.|$|R
40|$|Summary. The ECORS {{project was}} {{launched}} in 1983 {{with the aim of}} studying fundamental mechanisms of geodynamics in France. The ECORS deep seismic profiles have concentrated on a few structures of major significance: outer zone of the Variscan orogen in northern France, the basin formed during the <b>Bay</b> <b>of</b> <b>Biscay's</b> opening and transects of recent orogenic ranges (Pyrenees and Alps). The seismic profiles have been carried out with all the available modem techniques of industry and completed wherever possible by additional geophysical surveys (magnetism, gravity, MT, wide-angle and refraction seismics) and geological surveys. The first results already shed new light on major geodynamic phenomena such as variations in the frontal Variscan detachment, lower crust formation, crustal behaviour during orogenesis and variations in the formation of cratonic basins. 1...|$|R

5|$|L'Hermite's {{three other}} ships all survived the {{hurricane}} relatively intact {{and were able}} to continue their journey to Europe unimpeded, the British squadrons in the area also dispersed by the summer storms. In late September the squadron broke up, Régulus sailing for Brest and arriving on 5 October, the only French ship of the line to enter or leave the port all year. Président was less successful: at 03:30 on 27 September, while sailing in the <b>Bay</b> <b>of</b> <b>Biscay</b> at , Captain Labrosse sighted six ships of the line. This overwhelming force was a squadron under Rear-Admiral Sir Thomas Louis, which had been sent to the <b>Bay</b> <b>of</b> <b>Biscay</b> to await the return of Willaumez from the Caribbean. Immediately giving chase, Louis found that his ships of the line were not fast enough to catch the French frigate, which began to outdistance {{the main body of the}} squadron. However one of the small 18-gun sloops attached to the squadron, HMS Despatch under Captain Edward Hawkins was able to keep pace with the frigate, coming within firing range at 18:45.|$|E

5|$|Basque {{people were}} the first to hunt right whales commercially, {{beginning}} as early as the 11th century in the <b>Bay</b> <b>of</b> <b>Biscay.</b> They initially sought oil, but as meat preservation technology improved, the animal was also used for food. Basque whalers reached eastern Canada by 1530 and the shores of Todos os Santos Bay (in Bahia, Brazil) by 1602. The last Basque voyages were made before the Seven Years' War (1756–1763). All attempts to revive the trade after the war failed. Basque shore whaling continued sporadically into the 19th century.|$|E

5|$|During {{the year}} 1943, U-boat losses {{amounted}} to 258 to all causes. Of this total, 90 were sunk by Coastal Command, and 51 damaged.

Another 120 were damaged. Against those figures, 233 aircraft, 116 of which were lost owing to weather conditions, were destroyed.

5|$|In February 1793, amid rising {{political}} tension, the French Republic {{declared war}} on Great Britain, drawing Britain into the French Revolutionary Wars. At sea, the <b>Bay</b> <b>of</b> <b>Biscay,</b> the Western Approaches and the English Channel all became areas of significant naval activity as French privateers sailed on raiding cruises against British merchant shipping. To augment these attacks, the French naval authorities dispatched squadrons of frigates to attack British trade routes. To counter these operations, the Royal Navy sent their own frigates to sea, sometimes in squadrons and sometimes on single patrols.|$|E
5|$|Lord Howe, admiral of the British Channel Fleet, {{was aware}} of the convoy's nature and {{destination}} long before it left the Chesapeake, and made preparations to block its passage.

5|$|The {{defeat of}} the U-boats in the mid-Atlantic and their withdrawal, meant the <b>Bay</b> <b>of</b> <b>Biscay</b> became {{congested}} with German submarines seeking refuge. Thus, AOC Slessor revisited the interdiction strategy which had been tried, and failed in 1941 and 1943. This time, there were crucial differences. Firstly, the improvement of radar had enhanced detection of submarines, submerged and surfaced, and intelligence breakthroughs, in which the British Ultra organisation had broken the naval Enigma codes and confirmed {{a major change in}} German strategy, enabled the British to focus on the Biscay.|$|E
