5|$|I think it's {{something}} that is so unique about Rihanna whatever she's doing, whatever character she's playing, whatever side of herself she's showing, she's in it 1,000 percent... And I think the song and {{the theme of this}} song, she wanted to obviously show a softer side, a lighter side, one that's caught in maybe a tumultuous relationship... There's so much variety with her and it's <b>been</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> journey with her.|$|E
5|$|Overlordship was {{a central}} feature of Anglo-Saxon {{politics}} which began before Æthelberht's time; kings were described as overlords {{as late as the}} ninth century. The Anglo-Saxon invasion may have involved military coordination of different groups within the invaders, with a leader who had authority over many different groups; Ælle of Sussex may have <b>been</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> leader. Once the new states began to form, conflicts among them began. Tribute from dependents could lead to wealth. A weaker state also might ask or pay for the protection of a stronger neighbour against a warlike third state.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} was conceived by Edward Stratemeyer, {{founder of the}} Stratemeyer Syndicate. Stratemeyer had created the Hardy Boys series in 1926 (although the first volumes were not published until 1927), which had <b>been</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> success that he decided on a similar series for girls, featuring an amateur girl detective as the heroine. While Stratemeyer believed that a woman's place was in the home, {{he was aware that}} the Hardy Boys books were popular with girl readers and wished to capitalize on girls' interest in mysteries by offering a strong female heroine.|$|E
6000|$|There <b>was</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> obvious fear {{of giving}} offence in his manner, and he <b>was</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> timid, broken-spirited creature, that Nicholas {{could not help}} exclaiming, 'Poor fellow!' ...|$|R

5|$|Both Internazionale and Celtic {{had been}} {{performing}} well domestically throughout the season. Only {{a few days}} before the final Internazionale had been on the verge of winning a historic treble but losses in their last two games knocked them out of the semi-finals of the Coppa Italia and cost them the Scudetto. The European Cup was the last chance for them to redeem what had initially <b>been</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> promising season. Celtic came into the final having already won the First Division, the Scottish Cup and the Scottish League Cup as well as the Glasgow Cup earlier in the season.|$|E
5|$|Everyone I {{talked to}} {{seemed to have}} a {{relative}} or a friend who'd been through it. That was the other thing – everyone reacts to the problem differently so there's no textbook way of playing Ruth in her present situation. In fact, the way I'm playing her now might surprise some people because in the past she's <b>been</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> strong character and here she is collapsed and weeping and thinking the worst. Occasionally you may suggest to the script editor that you don't think your character will react a certain way, but with Ruth I have absolute trust in the scriptwriter's characterisation.|$|E

50|$|Within NATO, a Joint Task Force (JTF) would <b>be</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> {{temporary}} grouping {{that includes}} elements {{from more than}} one armed service, a Combined Task Force (CTF) would <b>be</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> temporary grouping that includes elements {{from more than one}} nation, and a Combined Joint Task Force (CJTF) would <b>be</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> temporary grouping that includes elements of more than one armed service and more than one nation.|$|R
60|$|This <b>was</b> said in <b>such</b> <b>a</b> hearty tone, and {{the voice}} was so exactly what it should have <b>been</b> from <b>such</b> <b>a</b> speaker, and there <b>was</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> cordiality in the manner, that Nicholas was emboldened to speak again.|$|R
25|$|Carmack loves pizza. During {{his time}} at id Software, a medium pepperoni pizza would arrive for Carmack from Domino's Pizza almost every day, carried by the same {{delivery}} person for more than 15 years. Carmack had <b>been</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> regular customer that they still charge him 1995 prices.|$|E
25|$|The {{continued}} {{presence of}} a Union Army force near Mobile constrained the Confederate Army in its last desperate campaigns. Maury realized that the numbers opposite him were inadequate for an attack, but the loss of Mobile would have <b>been</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> severe blow to the public mood {{that he would not}} send his guns or spare troops to support other missions.|$|E
25|$|During {{this term}} Rockefeller quietly and {{successfully}} completed {{the integration of}} Arkansas schools that had <b>been</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> political bombshell {{only a few years}} before. He established the Council on Human Relations despite opposition from the legislature. Draft boards in the state boasted the highest level of racial integration of any U.S. state by the time that Rockefeller left office.|$|E

5000|$|There <b>is</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> {{thing as}} a man being too proud to fight. There <b>is</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> {{thing as a}} nation being so right {{that it does not}} need to {{convince}} others by force that it is right.|$|R
25|$|By late December 1764 rumors {{had begun}} {{circulating}} {{that there might}} be a pair of beasts behind the killings. This was because there had <b>been</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> high number of attacks in such a short space of time, many had appeared to have been recorded and reported at the same time. Some contemporary accounts suggest the creature had been seen with another such animal, while others thought the beast was with its young.|$|E
25|$|A state {{appropriation}} {{paid for}} the work. It was sculpted in clay by Jo Davidson. He had been {{a close friend of}} Rogers. Davidson had the work cast in bronze in Brussels, Belgium. Dedicated on June 6, 1939, before a crowd of more than 2,000people, the statue faces the floor entrance of the House of Representatives Chamber next to National Statuary Hall. The Architect of the Capitol, David Lynn, said there had never <b>been</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> large ceremony or crowd in the Capitol.|$|E
25|$|Hardy {{frequently}} conceived of, {{and wrote}} about, supernatural forces, {{particularly those that}} control the universe through indifference or caprice, a force he called The Immanent Will. He also showed in his writing some degree of fascination with ghosts and spirits. Even so, he retained a strong emotional attachment to the Christian liturgy and church rituals, particularly as manifested in rural communities, that had <b>been</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> formative influence in his early years, and Biblical references can be found woven throughout many of Hardy's novels.|$|E

25|$|The {{new version}} was so {{promising}} that the Navy had 15 built {{and shipped to}} China before they had completed testing. They arrived in Manchuria in July 1940, and first saw combat over Chungking in August. There they proved to be completely untouchable by the Polikarpov I-16s and I-153s that had <b>been</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> problem for the A5Ms when in service. In one encounter, 13 Zeros shot down 27 I-15s and I-16s in under three minutes without loss. After hearing of these reports, the navy immediately ordered the A6M2 into production as the Type 0 Carrier Fighter, Model 11.|$|E
25|$|Grand Rapids has <b>been</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> {{host for}} many years, {{and with the}} advent of the Medical Mile they were asked to expand the medical school in Grand Rapids. The center is home to 400 {{students}} a year. The project was ratified by the MSU Board of Trustees on January 18, 2007. It was funded by private dollars through a joint fundraising initiative by MSU and Grand Action, a nonprofit Grand Rapids based organization designed to revitalize and attract business to downtown Grand Rapids. A $10 million lead donation of the $90 million construction budget was given by Ambassador Peter F. Secchia.|$|E
25|$|Irons can {{be heard}} playing drums on the Red Hot Chili Peppers' first demo tape, {{as well as their}} third album, The Uplift Mofo Party Plan (1987). When {{childhood}} friend and bandmate Hillel Slovak died of a heroin overdose on June 25, 1988, Irons left the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Irons stated {{that he did not want}} to be part of a group where his friends were dying. In 2006, Irons said Slovak's death had <b>been</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> huge shock that he had been suffering from depression ever since.|$|E
60|$|I do {{not merely}} believe there <b>is</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> place as hell. I know there <b>is</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> place; and I know also that when men {{have got to}} the point of believing virtue {{impossible}} but through dread of it, they have got into it.|$|R

25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1962 the Vartiokylä dumping ground was closed, but not because of its {{environmental}} impact. The official story was that the place was full and could not accommodate further waste materials. Since it had originally been a hole from which gravel had been taken, it did not stick out from the surrounding areas, such as the Iso-Huopalahti dumping ground and the Vuosaari dumping ground did and still do. (These two dumping grounds now replaced the Vartiokylä dumping ground.) Thus, when {{the construction of the}} Myllypuro neighbourhood was begun, the new residents most likely were oblivious {{to the fact that there}} had once <b>been</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> site there.|$|E
25|$|In the South African {{season of}} 1935-36, though, Nicholson was {{drafted into the}} South African Test team for the series against Australia after the shock death of Jock Cameron, who had <b>been</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> success on the tour to England and the {{decision}} by Robert Williams, Cameron's deputy on the England tour, {{to remain in the}} UK. In a one-sided series which Australia won 4-0, with one match drawn, Nicholson took only three catches in the first four matches, and, after making 0 in both innings of the fourth Test, was dropped for the fifth match in favour of Edward van der Merwe. He batted low in the order and made just 76 runs in eight innings, one of them not out.|$|E
25|$|On the {{theoretical}} level, Bordiga developed {{an understanding of}} the Soviet Union as a capitalist society. Bordiga's writings on the capitalist nature of the Soviet economy, in contrast to those produced by the Trotskyists, also focused on the agrarian sector. In analyzing the agriculture of the Soviet Union, Bordiga sought to display the capitalist social relations that existed in the kolkhoz and sovkhoz, one a cooperative farm and the other a wage-labor state farm. In particular, he emphasized how much of the national agrarian produce came from small, privately owned plots (writing in 1950) and predicted the rates at which the Soviet Union would start importing wheat after Russia had <b>been</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> large exporter from the 1880s to 1914.|$|E
5000|$|One {{reviewer}} stated: [...] "I {{read this}} novel because I <b>was</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> {{fan of the}} game and its sequels, so I was hoping for a similar experience with the novelization of the game by Philip Athans.
