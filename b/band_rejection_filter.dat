A microstrip transmission line having Spiral-DGS provides increased slow–wave factor (SWF) and excellent rejection characteristics for a specified harmonic frequency band as if it is a <b>band</b> <b>rejection</b> <b>filter.</b> Due to the increased SWF, the physical lengths of matching networks are shortened while the original matching and performances are preserved.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a new ultra-wideband (UWB) printed circular dipole antenna having a filtering feature for rejecting the Wi-Fi band (4. 9 - 5. 9 GHz). UWB regulation in Europe [1] and Japan require the rejection or {{the avoidance of}} the 5 GHz Wi-Fi frequency band, but due to the very wide frequency band used by UWB technology, it is also particularly exposed to other systems disturbances.

40|$|MEMS {{resonators}} {{have potential}} application {{in the area}} of frequency selective devices (e. g., gyroscopes, mass sensors, etc.). In this paper, design of electro thermally tunable resonators is presented. SOIMUMPs process is used to fabricate resonators with springs (beams) and a central mass. When voltage is applied, due to joule heating, temperature of the conducting beams goes up. This results in increase of electrical resistance due to mobility degradation. Due to increase in the temperature, springs start softening and therefore the fundamental frequency decreases. So for a given structure, one can modify the original fundamental frequency by changing the applied voltage. Coupled thermal effects result in non-uniform heating. It is observed from measurements and simulations that some parts of the beam become very hot and therefore soften more. Consequently, at higher voltages, the structure (equivalent to a single resonator) behaves like coupled resonators and exhibits peak splitting. In this mode, the given resonator {{can be used as a}} <b>band</b> <b>rejection</b> <b>filter.</b> This process is reversible and repeatable. For the designed structure, it is experimentally shown that by varying the voltage from 1 to 16 V, the resonant frequency could be changed by 28 %...|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, a UWB pulse {{generator}} {{is designed to}} be implemented in IBM 0. 13 um technology. The {{pulse generator}} has a high spectral efficiency. Using amplitude control, any mismatch, process variation or temperature variation can be compensated for to comply with the UWB FCC mask. The pulse has an approximate duration of 2 ns. The current consumption is 13 mA per pulse. The power consumption per pulse is 19. 5 mW. The next stage can be a power amplifier or an antenna. In case of an antenna, the effect of bond pads and bond wires are taken into account. A challenging aspect of UWB systems is their interference with narrow-band systems. Narrow-band systems send very high power signals compared to the UWB signals and thus may saturate the UWB receiver and/or prevent reliable detection of the UWB pulses. A possible solution to this problem is filtering. In this thesis, a Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) <b>band</b> <b>rejection</b> <b>filter</b> for UWB applications is designed using IBM 0. 13 um technology.

40|$|Graduation date: 1987 A {{time domain}} {{simulation}} model which approximates the three-dimensional velocity fluctuations of wind turbulence has been developed. This model {{is used in}} a discrete time control algorithm to regulate the output torque of a wind turbine by changing the pitch angle of the turbine blade. The wind model provides a velocity field which varies randomly with time and space and gives the proper correlation between spatial locations and velocity components. In addition, the spectral representations approximate those observed from a rotating reference frame. The version of the model described in this report is a time domain simulation. It makes use of a random number generator to construct a white noise time series with a uniform power spectral density over the frequency range of interest. This noise source is then passed {{through a set of}} appropriate linear filters to obtain the various wind velocity fluctuations which would be experienced by a rotating wind turbine blade. The blade pitch angle remains fixed in the computation of average torque values for each revolution which does not permit a continuous control action to be implemented. Therefore, a discrete control model with a time interval equal to the period of the rotor revolution is chosen. A control action which compensates for the flapping oscillation and induces a torque step response with a small overshoot which reaches steady state in a minimum number of steps is desirable. To achieve this, an integral control action is combined with a digital narrow <b>band</b> <b>rejection</b> <b>filter.</b> The integral control action eliminates the steady error in the resulting torque response...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the design and}} implementation of a speech enhancement system that uses 4 -channel microphone array beam forming and speech enhancement algorithms applied to a speech signal in a multiple source environment. To locate the accurate Direction of Arrival (DOA) from the source, {{it is necessary to}} design a suitable microphone array system with more efficient localization algorithm. The goal of the system is {{to improve the quality of}} the primary speech signal. A filter bank is a signal processing tool that can facilitate manipulation of signals in the frequency domain. The WOLA (Weighted Overlap and Add) filter is an efficient method used to implement a uniformly distributed multi-channel filter bank. The WOLA is generally used in applications that demand high quality filters in term of stop <b>band</b> <b>rejection</b> and <b>filter</b> shape. Beamformers work by means of steering an array of microphones towards a desired look direction through utilizing signal information rather than physically moving the array. In this research, Wiener beam former is examined the input signals are first split into frequency bands so that Wiener beam forming techniques can be used. There are many algorithms developed for estimating the number of sources and locating the DOA, such as Bayesian algorithm, kalman filtering, Generalized Cross Correlation (GCC) and Steered Response Power (SRP) algorithm. But SRP algorithm with its steered beam forming technique for speaker localization is more robust using microphone array. The Phase Alignment Transform (PHAT) has gained a lot of attention in the recent research for its quite robust response in low noise, but reverberant environment. So combining SRP-PHAT will become the robust localizer in reverberant environment. Experiments were done on recorded data of human talkers. The algorithm gives accurate DOA from the dominant speaker.
