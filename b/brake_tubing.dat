50|$|From the {{pressure}} differential valve, <b>brake</b> <b>tubing</b> carries {{the pressure}} to the brake units at the wheels. Since the wheels do not maintain a fixed relation to the automobile, {{it is necessary to}} use hydraulic brake hose {{from the end of the}} steel line at the vehicle frame to the caliper at the wheel. Allowing steel <b>brake</b> <b>tubing</b> to flex invites metal fatigue and, ultimately, brake failure. A common upgrade is to replace the standard rubber hoses with a set which are externally reinforced with braided stainless-steel wires; these have negligible expansion under pressure and can give a firmer feel to the brake pedal with less pedal travel for a given braking effort.|$|E
40|$|The ongoing {{drive for}} lighter and more {{efficient}} structural components by the commercial engineering industry {{has resulted in the}} rapid adoption of the finite element method (FE) for design analysis. Satisfied with the success of finite elements in reducing prototyping costs and overall production times, the industry has begun to look at other areas where the finite element method can save time, and in particular, improve designs. First, the mathematical methods of optimisation, on which the methods of structural design improvement are based, are presented. This includes the methods of: topology, influence functions, basis vectors, geometric splines and direct sensitivity methods. Each method is demonstrated with the solution of a sample structural improvement problem for various objectives (frequency, stress and weight reduction, for example). The practical application of the individual methods has been tested by solving three structural engineering problems sourced from the automotive engineering industry: the redesign of two different front suspension control arms, and the cost-reduction of an automatic <b>brake</b> <b>tubing</b> system. All three problems were solved successfully, resulting in improved designs. Each method has been evaluated with respect the practical application, popularity of the method and also any problems using the method. The solutions presented in each section were all solved using the FE design improvement software ReSHAPE from Advea Engineering Pty. Ltd...|$|E
50|$|The typical {{operation}} of a hydraulic brake system uses the premise of fluid displacement to convert operator input into friction. This fluid transfer is accomplished by a connecting tube and/or hose from one hydraulic cylinder (often called the master cylinder) to another (located at the brakes of each wheel). In practice, an operator control such as a brake pedal or lever attached to a hydraulic cylinder is connected in turn, via a tube/hose, to another hydraulic cylinder responsible for applying friction to a moving surface. This network of operator control(s), tube/hose, and cylinder(s) is filled with hydraulic fluid such that input from the operator displaces fluid at the control location, resulting in movement {{at the opposite end}} of the system. The ideal hydraulic brake system would use only hard tubing such as galvanized or stainless steel pipe, as this would prevent any expansion along the hydraulic fluid path, providing the most direct transfer of operator input force to the friction surfaces, and in fact most of the length of a brake line is made of stainless steel. However, hard tubing will not endure the motions caused by articulation of suspension components. For example, an automobile wheel is not hard-mounted to the automobile's frame or unibody chassis. It is instead mounted to a suspension component which allows that wheel to move in response to road irregularities and steering inputs. Because the wheel must be able to move, a length of flexible hose must be used between the end of the run of metal <b>brake</b> line <b>tubing,</b> and the <b>brake</b> at each wheel. Since the ideal brake system would use only hard tubing for its lack of expansion, but some use of flexible hose is required, the ideal compromise is to use a hose type that allows a minimal rate of expansion. Thus the assertion that braided stainless steel hose is superior as compared to a typical rubber hose when used in a hydraulic brake system.|$|R
