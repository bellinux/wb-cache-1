500|$|Threonine proteases, {{such as the}} {{proteasome}} protease subunit and ornithine acyltransferases use {{the secondary}} hydroxyl of threonine in a manner analogous {{to the use of}} the serine primary hydroxyl. [...] However, due to the steric interference of the extra methyl group of threonine, the <b>base</b> <b>member</b> of the triad is the N-terminal amide which polarises an ordered water which, in turn, deprotonates the catalytic hydroxyl to increase its reactivity. Similarly, there exist equivalent 'serine only' and 'cysteine only' configurations such as penicillin acylase G and penicillin acylase V which are evolutionarily related to the proteasome proteases. Again, these use their N-terminal amide as a base.|$|E

5000|$|Originally {{a member}} of the SP {{political}} party and a primary school teacher, Rytz came from Thun to Bern to study history and sociology. Rytz was member of the Student/innenrat, the student council of the University of Bern from 1988 to 1994. At the university she organized counter-events to the conventional lectures, reanimated the feminist science (Feministische Wissenschaft) association, and was member of the action group Kritische Uni (literally: Critical University) where she spent a [...] "very self-determined and motion-oriented time. I had the chance to organize substantive discussions, without being clamped in a fixed political party hierarchy", she recalled in an interview in 2011. When she joined the Green Alliance (Grünes Bündnis Bern) in 1987, Rytz initially was a <b>base</b> <b>member.</b> Between 1993 and 1998 she was also engaged as political secretary of Grünes Bündnis Bern, a regional fraction of the Green Party of Switzerland. In this function, she was also responsible for the organizational and strategic management, and provided technical and policy advice of Therese Frösch, the finance director of Bern. In 1994 she was elected to the parliament of the Canton of Bern where Rytz also was engaged in commissions focussing on education policy, fiscal policy, economic policy and state policy by 2005. Then she was elected as executive member (Gemeinderätin) of the city of Bern where she directed the department Tiefbau, Verkehr und Stadtgrün that provided the municipal civil engineering, transport and the urban green areas. In 2008 she was re-elected, getting the most votes of all governmental members. By 2012, she was responsible for the implementation of large projects such as the reconstruction of the Bahnhofplatz plaza and the construction of Tram Bern West.|$|E

40|$|A {{leveling}} apparatus for {{the precise}} adjustment {{of a scientific}} instrument is reported. A <b>base</b> <b>member</b> is provided having a hollow cylindrical shape. A table for supporting the instrument rests on the base and has a shaft portion extending below the table. The upper portion of the shaft fits tightly into the hollow portion of the <b>base</b> <b>member</b> whereas the lower portion of the shaft is machined to fit loosely. The lower portion of the shaft is provided with a groove. Adjusting screws are threaded through the hollow cylindrical portion and are adapted to enter the groove. By adjusting the screws, the lower portion of the shaft is moved in a vertical plane since the shaft is loosely fitted into the cylinder. The upper portion of the shaft which is tightly fitted into {{the upper end of}} the cylinder causes the cylinder to deform slightly providing a fulcrum point which allows the table to be leveled in response to the adjustment of the adjusting screws...|$|E

A <b>base</b> <b>member</b> is anchored to a central underside portion of the bottom clamp body section and has a pair of connection tabs positioned beneath the bottom clamp body section connection flanges {{on opposite sides of}} the clamp axis. A pair of bolts are retained on the <b>base</b> <b>member</b> connection tabs and are threadable into a pair of nuts retainable on a support structure. The connection tab and connection flanges on each side of the clamp body are axially offset in a manner permitting downward installation/removable tool access to the lower bolts past the connection flanges. An elongated retention tether is used to connect the top clamp body section to the balance of the clamp assembly. This prevents loss of the top clamp body section when it is removed from the bottom clamp body section...|$|E
