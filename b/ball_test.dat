Core strength is theorized to optimize athletic performance, reduce risk of injury, and facilitate return from injury. Reliable and valid measures of core strength are necessary to track progress and determine effectiveness of human performance training. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the reliability and validity of three medicine <b>ball</b> toss <b>tests.</b> A total of 20 healthy physically active males and females (Age: 22. 7 ± 7. 8 years, Height: 164. 79 ± 25. 70 cm, Weight: 70. 95 ± 12. 34 kg) participated. Testing occurred in two sessions separated by one to seven days. During session one, isokinetic testing was performed followed by medicine <b>ball</b> toss <b>tests.</b> Isokinetic strength testing included torso flexion, extension, and rotation, standardized according to manufacturer’s recommendations. Medicine <b>ball</b> toss <b>tests</b> were performed in four directions: forwards, backward, and rotational (right/left). Subjects performed five practice trials of each throw, followed by a five-minute rest period. Following the rest period, subjects performed five measured medicine <b>ball</b> toss <b>tests.</b> Subjects performed only the medicine <b>ball</b> toss <b>tests</b> in session two. Average peak torque was utilized for analysis of isokinetic strength. The average distance of the first three medicine <b>ball</b> toss <b>tests</b> in each direction was utilized for analysis. Pearson correlations were calculated to assess validity between medicine <b>ball</b> toss <b>tests</b> in session one and the corresponding isokinetic strength. Intraclass correlation coefficients were calculated to determine the reliability of the medicine <b>ball</b> toss <b>tests</b> between sessions. No significant Pearson correlations were observed between the forward, backward, and rotational medicine <b>ball</b> toss <b>tests</b> and corresponding measures of isokinetic strength (r=- 0. 047, p= 0. 845; r=- 0. 074, p= 0. 756; r=- 0. 051, p= 0. 832 (right); r= 0. 18, p= 0. 447 (left), respectively).

The <b>Ball</b> <b>Test</b> is a forced-choice psi task involving the blind selection of numbered ping-pong balls afternumbers are called by the participant (a hit is a match between a ‘called’ number and a ‘selected’ ball number). According to Reactance Theory, when an individual’s freedom is threatened through some form of coercion, we may expect reactance, which is “a motivational state aimed at restoring the threatened freedom” (Silvia, 2005, p. 277). Reactance may explain the SGE. In that study (N= 82), we found a significant forced-choice hit rate of 21. 06 % where PMCE= 20 % (p=. 002). Participants were randomly assigned to a control condition (n= 42) or treatment (n= 40) condition requiring them to read a statement that induced reactance.

40|$|Vehicle {{manufacturers}} today face increasing {{demands to}} produce fuel efficient vehicles. If {{this is to}} be successfully achieved, the reduction of energy losses is vital [1]. One approach to loss reduction is to use lower viscosity trans mission fluids to reduce splash (churning) losses in the drive-train. However, this introduces potential problems in regard to the durability of machine components due to reduction in oil film thickness [2]. As regards gear transmission, the durability is mainly related to the formation of micropits on parts of gears where sliding is high, which later lead to pitting damage. The formation of micropits is due to surface stress which can be reduced by fluids that form thick EHD films or reduce sliding friction. In order to determine if these same lubricant properties as well as other parameters, known to influence the fuel efficiency of axle lubricants, also affect contact fatigue damage in rolling contacts, an extensive experimental study using a rolling four <b>ball</b> <b>test</b> was performed. The tests were performed with a series of fluids that form thin and thick EHD films and have low and high sliding friction. Additionally, these fluids have been formulated to hav e high and low hydrodynamic friction. All these fluids contai ned additive packages that meet the API GL- 5 gear oil specifications. The different properties of the lubricating fluids were controlled by changes to the base oils as well as addition of friction modifiers. The results have shown that it is possible do distinguish the pitting properties of the different lubricants by using rolling four ball tests. A multiple linear regression statistical analysis was performed with the use of Matlab for evaluating the results obtained from rolling four ball tests. The statistical model developed, showed that some of the physical properties of fluids that a ffect fuel efficiency have an impact on pitting performance of the lubricants.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to gain an {{understanding}} of the motion of a tennis ball during flight. A wind tunnel was used to measure the aerodynamic forces on a tennis ball, and hence calculate their drag coefficients at wind speeds up to 136 mph. The drag coefficient was relatively constant with increasing velocity for each brand of <b>ball</b> <b>tested,</b> and a larger ball had a similar drag coefficient to a standard sized ball. It was found that raising or lowering the nap increased or decreased the drag coefficient by almost 6 %. In conclusion, a larger drag force on a tennis ball can be achieved through an increase in diameter or raising the nap of the ball...|$|R
