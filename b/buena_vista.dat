5|$|<b>Buena</b> <b>Vista</b> {{features}} an early architectural style that {{differs from that}} at Motul de San José, consisting of platforms built from unworked stone, with wide front stairways and probably without superstructures. They {{were built in the}} Middle to Late Preclassic periods and then reused in the Late Classic. The differences in style between <b>Buena</b> <b>Vista</b> and Motul probably results from differing epochs of construction.|$|E
5|$|The Kostal {{recording}} {{was released}} on two CDs, two LPs and two audio cassettes by <b>Buena</b> <b>Vista</b> Records, in 1982.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} ceramic evidence excavated at <b>Buena</b> <b>Vista</b> {{dates to}} {{the very end of the}} Early Preclassic period, indicating that the site was initially settled at the transition between the Early and Middle Preclassic periods. The long occupational history of <b>Buena</b> <b>Vista</b> may be linked to its proximity to chert-rich hills. Excavations have revealed evidence of chert workshops dedicated to the production of tools, together with dumps of waste flakes.|$|E
5|$|A large {{meteorite}} fell near <b>Buena</b> <b>Vista</b> on March28, 1859, {{causing some}} panic in the area. The {{site of the}} impact {{and a part of}} the meteorite have been preserved.|$|E
5|$|Disney {{considered}} {{releasing the}} film's soundtrack {{around the time}} of the film's roadshow release, but this idea was not realized. The soundtrack was first released as a mono three LP set and a stereo 8-track tape in sixteen countries by Disneyland and <b>Buena</b> <b>Vista</b> Records in 1957, containing the musical pieces without the narration. A stereo edition LP was issued by <b>Buena</b> <b>Vista</b> Records in 1961. Disney was required to obtain permission from Stokowski, who initially rejected its sale unless the Philadelphia Orchestra Association received a share of the royalties.|$|E
5|$|A {{video game}} {{adaptation}} of the film was developed by Griptonite Games and Amaze Entertainment and released by <b>Buena</b> <b>Vista</b> Games in June–August 2006 for the PlayStation Portable, Nintendo DS and Game Boy Advance.|$|E
5|$|<b>Buena</b> <b>Vista</b> – Situated to {{the south}} and north of Route 13 (Poplar Street), and west of the main village. It holds the newer town water tower and several homes. It is bordered by Liberty {{to the south}}.|$|E
5|$|The {{occurrence}} of these closures {{and the change}} in traditions is the simplest explanation of why many musicians were out of work, and why their style of music had declined before the <b>Buena</b> <b>Vista</b> Social Club made it popular again.|$|E
5|$|From Puerto de Caballos, Gil González sailed west {{along the}} coast to the Amatique Bay, and founded a Spanish {{settlement}} {{near the mouth of}} the Río Dulce, within modern-day Guatemala, which he named San Gil de <b>Buena</b> <b>Vista.</b> He launched a campaign of conquest in the mountainous region dividing Honduras from Guatemala. González left some of his men under the command of Francisco Riquelme at San Gil de <b>Buena</b> <b>Vista,</b> and sailed back east {{along the coast}} to a point east of the Cape of Honduras (near modern Trujillo). From there he marched inland in search of a route to the Pacific. The colonists at San Gil did not prosper, and soon searched of a more hospitable location. They resettled in the important indigenous town of Nito, near the mouth of the Dulce River.|$|E

5|$|Gil González Dávila set {{out from}} the Caribbean island of Hispaniola early in 1524, with the {{intention}} of exploring the Caribbean coast of Nicaragua. His course took him to the north coast of Honduras. After founding Puerto de Caballos, Gil Gónzalez sailed west along the coast to the Amatique Bay, and founded a Spanish settlement somewhere near the Dulce River, within modern-day Guatemala, which he named San Gil de <b>Buena</b> <b>Vista.</b> He launched a campaign of conquest in the mountainous region dividing Honduras from Guatemala. González left some of his men under the command of Francisco Riquelme at San Gil de <b>Buena</b> <b>Vista,</b> and sailed back east along the coast to Honduras. The colonists at San Gil did not prosper, and soon set out in search of a more hospitable location. They resettled in the important indigenous town of Nito, near the mouth of the Dulce River. Although they were in a desperate state, and near-starving, they were still there when Cortés passed through en route to Honduras, and were absorbed into his expedition.|$|E

At this time some of its satellite sites were also settled, including La Trinidad de Nosotros and <b>Buena</b> <b>Vista,</b> both of which would have been small villages at this time, and they may have been settled even earlier in the Middle Preclassic, between 800 and 600 BC.|$|E
5|$|The Queen's castle {{was used}} {{prominently}} in the advertising of the film (acting as {{the backdrop of the}} film's poster). Later Disney fairy tales, including Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin, feature similarly fantastical castles and palaces, and often these buildings act as centrepieces or backdrops for the movies' posters. A fairy tale castle stands at the centre of each Disney theme park, and the image of the castle is used in the logo for <b>Buena</b> <b>Vista</b> International.|$|E

5|$|The {{film was}} reissued {{nationwide}} once more on April 15, 1977, {{this time with}} simulated stereo sound. This edit featured the RKO distribution logo being replaced with that of <b>Buena</b> <b>Vista</b> Distribution, since RKO had not {{been part of a}} release since 1946. It had not been removed earlier as the credit sequence would have required to be re-shot. A two-and-a-half-minute reduction in the film's running time in this version remains unclear in existing records.|$|E
5|$|The first {{performances}} {{by the full}} line up of <b>Buena</b> <b>Vista</b> Social Club, including Cooder, were those filmed by Wenders in Amsterdam and New York.
