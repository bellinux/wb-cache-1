5|$|The {{allotetraploid}} hybrid species {{derived from}} A.montanum can <b>backcross</b> with A.montanum to form triploid hybrids. The <b>backcross</b> hybrid between A.montanum and A.pinnatifidum is A.×trudellii, {{as suggested by}} Wherry. He also collected specimens of the <b>backcross</b> hybrid between A.montanum and A.bradleyi from a cliff near Blairstown, New Jersey in 1935. The hybrid received no further attention until 1961, when it was described and named in Wherry's honor as Wherry's spleenwort (A.×wherryi). The sterile diploid A.montanum × platyneuron, precursor to A.bradleyi, was collected in 1972 at Crowder's Mountain, Georgia; A.montanum × rhizophyllum, precursor to A.pinnatifidum, has never been found.|$|E
5|$|A Limousin/Jersey <b>backcross</b> study {{conducted}} in Australia and New Zealand {{to investigate the}} effects of the F94L myostatin variant concluded that the mutation had no significant effect on birth-weight and growth traits. Averaged over all <b>backcross</b> calves in the trial (total of 766), animals homozygous for the mutation had approximately 6% heavier carcases than animals without the mutation, 15% larger eye muscle (also known as rib eye) area, 13% heavier silverside weight, and 13% heavier total meat weight. Increased meat weight and size was accompanied by a 15% reduction in intra-muscular fat and 25% reduction in total fat weight. No other significant effects were observed. A second <b>backcross</b> {{study conducted}} in Japan of Limousin and Japanese Black breeds identified similar changes to meat and fat quantities in cattle homozygous for the F94L mutation.|$|E
5|$|Loss {{of hybrid}} vigour occurs and {{phenotype}} varies greatly in subsequent generations if F1 hybrids are inter-bred or backcrossed with animals genetically {{similar to the}} F1 parent. Inter-bred F1 hybrids will produce progeny that can be either heterozygous for each gene variant, homozygous for one gene variant, or homozygous for the other gene variant. When one of the variants has a large effect on a trait, for example the effect of myostatin variants on muscularity, larger phenotypic variation will occur among the progeny. <b>Backcross</b> progeny will have less phenotypic variation and comprise animals that are either heterozygous for each gene variant or homozygous for the variant found in the original F1 <b>backcross</b> parent.|$|E

40|$|Zucchini {{yellow mosaic}} virus (ZYMV) is an {{economically}} important pathogen of cucurbits that is transmitted both horizontally and vertically. Although ZYMV is seed-transmitted in Cucurbita pepo, {{the potential for}} seed transmission in virus-resistant transgenic cultivars is not known. We crossed and <b>backcrossed</b> a transgenic squash cultivar with wild C. pepo, and determined whether seed-to-seedling transmission of ZYMV was possible in seeds harvested from transgenic <b>backcrossed</b> C. pepo. We then compared these transmission rates to those of non-transgenic (<b>backcrossed</b> and wild) C. pepo. The overall seed-to-seedling transmission rate in ZYMV was {{similar to those found}} in previous studies (1. 37 %), with no significant difference between transgenic <b>backcrossed</b> (2. 48 %) and non-transgenic (1. 03 %) <b>backcrossed</b> and wild squash. Fewer transgenic <b>backcrossed</b> plants had symptom development (7 %) in comparisonwith all non-transgenic plants (26 %) and may be instrumental in preventing yield reduction due to ZYMV. Our study shows that ZYMVis seed transmitted in transgenic <b>backcrossed</b> squash, whichmay affect the spread of ZYMV via the movement of ZYMV-infected seeds.

5|$|In {{addition}} to its parental species, A.bradleyi hybridizes with several other spleenworts. Its hybrid with A.pinnatifidum was recognized as such by William R. Maxon in 1918. He named it A.gravesii for its discoverer, Edward W. Graves. It can also <b>backcross</b> with its parental species. Wherry collected specimens of A.bradleyi ×montanum from a cliff near Blairstown, New Jersey in 1935. It is not {{thought to have been}} collected again until 1961, when it was described and named in Wherry's honor. Specimens believed to be A.bradleyi ×platyneuron were collected at an early date at McCall's Ferry, along the Susquehanna River. The site of collection was submerged by the building of the Holtwood Dam. A preliminary report of both diploid A.bradleyi and A.bradleyi ×platyneuron from Sequatchie County, Tennessee was made in 1989.|$|E
5|$|The {{northern}} {{crested newt}} and the marbled newt {{are the only}} species in the genus with a considerable range overlap (in western France). In that area, they have patchy, mosaic-like distributions and in general prefer different habitats. When they do occur in the same breeding ponds, they can form hybrids, which have intermediate characteristics. Individuals resulting from the cross of a crested newt male with a marbled newt female had mistakenly been described as distinct species Triton blasii de l'Isle 1862, and the reverse hybrids as Triton trouessarti Peracca 1886. The first type is much rarer due to increased mortality of the larvae and consists only of males, while in the second, males have lower survival rates than females. Overall, viability is reduced in these hybrids and they rarely <b>backcross</b> with their parent species. Hybrids made up 3–7% of the adult populations in different studies.|$|E
5|$|Asplenium bradleyi {{is similar}} to two hybrid species {{of which it is}} a parent, Graves' spleenwort (A.×gravesii), a hybrid with A.pinnatifidum, and Wherry's spleenwort (A.×wherryi), a <b>backcross</b> with A.montanum. In A.×gravesii, the dark color of the stipe ends {{at the base of the}} leaf blade, the pinnae are more shallowly lobed and the {{enlargement}} of acroscopic lobes or pinnules is less distinct, and the apical portion of the blade forms a long, tapering tip with slight lobes (as in A.pinnatifidum), rather than being cut into pinnae. In addition to the general reduction of the toothiness of A.bradleyi, A.×gravesii also shows faint winging along the stipe. Likewise, in A.×wherryi, the dark color of the stipe again ends at the base of the leaf blade, the overall shape of the blade tends to be more distinctly lance-shaped, and the fronds are somewhat more deeply cut than A.bradleyi, progressing from bipinnate in the lower half to pinnate-pinnatifid and finally pinnate at the apex. Finally, the diploid hybrid A.montanum × platyneuron, from which A.bradleyi arose by chromosome doubling, is essentially identical in appearance to A.bradleyi. On close examination, its spores are found to be abortive, and the sori are smaller and not do not become fused with each other as they grow, as they do in fertile A.bradleyi.|$|E

50|$|Introgression, {{also known}} as introgressive hybridization, in {{genetics}} is the movement of a gene (gene flow) from one species into the gene pool of another by the repeated <b>backcrossing</b> of an interspecific hybrid with one of its parent species. Purposeful introgression is a long-term process; it may take many hybrid generations before the <b>backcrossing</b> occurs.|$|R
40|$|Hybridization is {{observed}} frequently in birds, but {{often it is}} not known whether the hybrids are fertile and if <b>backcrossing</b> occurs. The breeding ranges of the great reed warbler (Acrocephalus arundinaceus) and the clamorous reed warbler (A. stentoreus) overlap in southern Kazakhstan and a previous study has documented hybridization in a sympatric population. In the present study, we first present a large set of novel microsatellite loci isolated and characterised in great reed warblers. Secondly, we evaluate whether hybridization in the sympatric breeding population has been followed by <b>backcrossing</b> and introgression. We isolated 181 unique microsatellite loci in great reed warblers. Of 41 loci evaluated, 40 amplified and 30 were polymorphic. Bayesian clustering analyses based on genotype data from 23 autosomal loci recognised two well-defined genetic clusters corresponding to the two species. Individuals clustered to a very high extent to either of these clusters (admixture proportions ≥ 0. 984) with the exception of four previously suggested arundinaceus–stentoreus hybrid birds that showed mixed ancestry (admixture proportions 0. 495 – 0. 619). Analyses of simulated hybrids and <b>backcrossed</b> individuals showed that the sampled birds do not correspond to first–fourth-generation <b>backcrosses,</b> and that fifth or higher generation <b>backcrosses</b> to a high extent resemble ‘pure’ birds at this set of markers. We conclude that these novel microsatellite loci provide a useful molecular resource for Acrocephalus warblers. The time to reach reproductive isolation is believed to be very long in birds, approximately 5 Myrs, and with an estimated divergence time of 2 Myrs between these warblers, some <b>backcrossing</b> and introgression could have been expected. However, there was no evidence for <b>backcrossing</b> and introgression suggesting that hybrids are either infertile or their progeny inviable. Very low levels of introgression cannot be excluded, which still may be an important factor as a source of new genetic variation...|$|R
25|$|In <b>backcross</b> conversion, {{genes are}} introgressed from a donor {{cultivar}} or related species into a recipient elite line through repeated backcrossing. A {{problem in this}} procedure {{is being able to}} identify the lines carrying the trait of interest at each generation. The problem is particularly acute if the trait of interest is recessive, as it will be present only in a heterozygous condition after each <b>backcross.</b> The development of molecular markers provides an easier method of selection based on the genotype (marker) rather than the phenotype. Combined with doubled haploidy it becomes more effective. In marker assisted <b>backcross</b> conversion, a recipient parent is crossed with a donor line and the hybrid (F1) backcrossed to the recipient. The resulting generation (BC1) is backcrossed and the process repeated until the desired genotypes are produced. The combination of doubled haploidy and molecular marker provides the short cut. In the back cross generation one itself a genotype with the character of interest can be selected and converted into homozygous doubled haploid genotype. Chen et al. (1994) used marker assisted <b>backcross</b> conversion with doubled haploidy of BC1 individuals to select stripe rust resistant lines in barley.|$|E

25|$|In 1953, Borlaug {{extended}} {{this technique}} {{by suggesting that}} several pure lines with different resistance genes should be developed through <b>backcross</b> methods using one recurrent parent. Backcrossing involves crossing a hybrid and subsequent generations with a recurrent parent. As a result, the genotype of the backcrossed progeny becomes increasingly {{similar to that of}} the recurrent parent. Borlaug's method would allow the various different disease-resistant genes from several donor parents to be transferred into a single recurrent parent. To make sure each line has different resistant genes, each donor parent is used in a separate <b>backcross</b> program. Between five and ten of these lines may then be mixed depending upon the races of pathogen present in the region. As this process is repeated, some lines will become susceptible to the pathogen. These lines can easily be replaced with new resistant lines. As new sources of resistance become available, new lines are developed. In this way, the loss of crops is kept to a minimum, because only one or a few lines become susceptible to a pathogen within a given season, and all other crops are unaffected by the disease. Because the disease would spread more slowly than if the entire population were susceptible, this also reduces the damage to susceptible lines. There is still the possibility that a new race of pathogen will develop to which all lines are susceptible, however.|$|E
25|$|A {{few other}} rare hybrids {{resemble}} A.×ebenoides. A.×hendersonii, once suggested {{to be the}} same species, has longer sori, more obtuse pinnae, and a scaly stipe. The unnamed triploid <b>backcross</b> of A.×ebenoides with A.rhizophyllum was accidentally generated in culture in 1956, and subsequently identified with a fern collected in West Virginia in 1946, previously identified as an aberrant A.×ebenoides. This hybrid is intermediate between its parents, bearing lobes in the basal part of the frond only, and with purple color extending up the rachis but not the stipe. A.×crucibuli, an artificial hybrid between A.platyneuron and the Asian walking fern, A.ruprechtii, has narrower blades, deeply pinnatifid in the middle and becoming pinnate at the base.|$|E

25|$|The species most {{similar to}} Asplenium platyneuron is the black-stemmed spleenwort, A.resiliens.
