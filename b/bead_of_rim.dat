50|$|Tire levers for bicycle tires {{have one}} end that is tapered and {{slightly}} curved. The other end is usually hooked {{so that it}} can be hooked around a spoke to keep the tire <b>bead</b> free <b>of</b> the <b>rim</b> at one point, allowing a second lever to be manipulated forward, progressively loosening a larger segment <b>of</b> the tire <b>bead</b> from the rim.|$|R

50|$|Unlike {{pneumatic}} tires {{which use}} a separate inner tube, tubeless tires have continuous ribs molded integrally into the <b>bead</b> <b>of</b> the tire {{so that they}} are forced by the pressure of the air inside the tire to seal with the flanges <b>of</b> the metal <b>rim</b> <b>of</b> the wheel.|$|R
50|$|A {{beadlock}} or bead lock is {{a mechanical}} device that secures the <b>bead</b> <b>of</b> a tire {{to the wheel}} of a vehicle. Tires and wheels are designed so that, when the tire is inflated, the tire pressure pushes the <b>bead</b> <b>of</b> the tire against the inside <b>of</b> the wheel <b>rim</b> so that the tire stays on the wheel and the two rotate together. In situations where tire pressure is insufficient to hold the <b>bead</b> <b>of</b> the tire in place, a beadlock is needed.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe PAS kinase Rim 15 is {{proposed}} to integrate signals from different nutrient-sensing pathways and to control transcriptional reprogramming of Saccharomyces cerevisiae upon nutrient depletion. Despite th{{is proposed}} role, previous transcriptome analyses <b>of</b> <b>rim</b> 15 mutants solely focused on growing cultures. In the present work, retentostat cultivation enabled {{analysis of the}} role <b>of</b> <b>Rim</b> 15 under severely calorie-restricted, virtually non-growing conditions. Under these conditions, deletion <b>of</b> <b>RIM</b> 15 affected transcription of over 10 -fold more genes than in growing cultures. Transcriptional responses, metabolic rates and cellular morphology indicated a key role <b>of</b> <b>Rim</b> 15 in controlled cell-cycle arrest upon nutrient depletion. Moreover, deletion <b>of</b> <b>rim</b> 15 reduced heat-shock tolerance in non-growing, but not in growing cultures. The failure <b>of</b> <b>rim</b> 15 cells to adapt to calorie restriction by entering a robust post-mitotic state resembles cancer cell physiology and shows that retentostat cultivation of yeast strains can provide relevant models for healthy post-mitotic and transformed human cells...|$|R

50|$|French tire {{manufacturer}} Hutchinson {{has introduced}} a tubeless wheel system, Road Tubeless, that shares many similarities to the UST (Universal System Tubeless) that was developed in conjunction with Mavic and Michelin. Road Tubeless rims, like UST rims, have no spoke holes protruding to the air chamber <b>of</b> the <b>rim.</b> The flange <b>of</b> the Road Tubeless rim {{is similar to the}} hook <b>bead</b> <b>of</b> a standard clincher rim but is contoured to very close tolerances to interlock with a Road Tubeless tire, creating an airtight seal between tire and rim. This system eliminates the need for a rim strip and inner tube.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{putative}} Rab 3 effector RIM (Rab 3 -interacting molecule) {{was detected}} by Northern blotting, RT-PCR and Western blotting in native pancreatic β-cells {{as well as in}} the derived cell lines INS- 1 E and HIT-T 15. RIM was localized on the plasma membrane of INS- 1 E cells and β-cells. An involvement <b>of</b> <b>RIM</b> in insulin exocytosis was indicated by transfection experiments of INS- 1 E cells with the Rab 3 binding domain <b>of</b> <b>RIM.</b> This domain enhanced glucose-stimulated secretion in intact cells and Ca 2 +-stimulated exocytosis in permeabilized cells.

40|$|Yeast cells contain two Bro 1 domain proteins: Bro 1, {{which is}} {{required}} for endosomal trafficking, and Rim 20, which {{is required for}} the response to the external pH via the Rim 101 pathway. Rim 20 associates with endosomal structures under alkaline growth conditions, when it promotes activation <b>of</b> <b>Rim</b> 101 through proteolytic cleavage. We report here that the pH-dependent localization <b>of</b> <b>Rim</b> 20 is contingent on the amount of Bro 1 in the cell. Cells that lack Bro 1 have increased endosomal Rim 20 -green fluorescent protein (GFP) under acidic conditions; cells that overexpress Bro 1 have reduced endosomal Rim 20 -GFP under acidic or alkaline conditions. The novel endosomal association <b>of</b> <b>Rim</b> 20 -GFP in the absence of Bro 1 requires ESCRT components including Vps 27 but not specific Rim 101 pathway components such as Dfg 16. Vps 27 influences the localization of Bro 1 but is not required for RIM 101 pathway activation in wild-type cells, thus suggesting that Rim 20 enters the Bro 1 localization pathway when a vacancy exists. Despite altered localization <b>of</b> <b>Rim</b> 20, the lack of Bro 1 does not bypass the need for signaling protein Dfg 16 to activate Rim 101, as evidenced by the expression levels <b>of</b> the <b>Rim</b> 101 target genes RIM 8 and SMP 1. Therefore, endosomal association <b>of</b> <b>Rim</b> 20 is not sufficient to promote Rim 101 activation...|$|R

50|$|The Avon Safety Wheel {{avoids the}} {{detachment}} of a deflated tyre {{by having a}} much shallower central recess within {{the interior of the}} wheel. The recess is so shallow that the tyre is prevented from twisting to an angle that would allow it to slip over the edge <b>of</b> the <b>rim,</b> so it is retained. Such a shallow recess would also prevent the fitment of new tyres, if it weren't for the inclusion of a deep channel, allowing the <b>bead</b> <b>of</b> the tyre to enter the channel to permit fitting. The channel is covered by a metal band that is tightened around the wheel after the tyre is fitted but before it is inflated.|$|R
