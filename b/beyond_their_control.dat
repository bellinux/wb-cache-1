5|$|The story {{picks up}} {{approximately}} {{two weeks after}} the events of Guilty Gear X. In the time following Dizzy's disappearance, the mysterious Post-War Administration Bureau begins secretly investigating the Gears and fighters from previous tournaments for their own needs and ambitions. To achieve their goals the organization has created several mechanical copies of Ky Kiske, the “Robo-Kys”. In addition, fighters find themselves in a reality <b>beyond</b> <b>their</b> <b>control,</b> most notably in the manipulative hands of the villainess I-No, who is revealed to be a servant of “That Man”, the creator of the Gears. Each character provides a different ending to Guilty Gear X2.|$|E

As they leave, T-Rick discovers his gnome stolen and chases after them but they escape in Thomas' mini-van. As night falls, the party's start time passes but no one turns up and Thomas worries that the party will fail. Suddenly, party-goers arrive en-masse. Thomas intends to limit the party to the backyard and poolhouse with the house guarded by two young security guards, Everett and Tyler. However, more and more people begin to arrive and the party moves <b>beyond</b> <b>their</b> <b>control</b> and into the house. Thomas questions Costa on how he advertised the party, forcing him to confess that he put ads on Craigslist and on a local radio station, worried that no one would attend.|$|E
5|$|In April 2016, {{after missing}} the initial October 2015 deadline, Caltrain {{requested}} {{a third party}} review of the CBOSS project from the American Public Transportation Association (APTA). APTA noted that Caltrain was not effectively managing the project schedule and cost because of generally poor communication between Caltrain's project management and Parsons, and Caltrain's project manager {{did not have the}} technical experience or authority to resolve technical and contractual issues with Parsons. In February 2017, Caltrain terminated its contract with Parsons for failure to perform on time and budget and announced potential litigation. Parsons filed suit on February 22, saying delays were due to changing client requirements and circumstances <b>beyond</b> <b>their</b> <b>control.</b> Caltrain filed suit a week later, seeking $98million in damages; although the system has been mostly installed, testing is still incomplete.|$|E
5000|$|Constraint {{recognition}} {{is the extent}} to which individuals see their behaviors as limited by factors <b>beyond</b> <b>their</b> own <b>control.</b> Constraints can be psychological, such as low self-efficacy; self-efficacy is the conviction that one is capable of executing a behavior required to produce certain outcomes (Witte & Allen, 2000).

5|$|Special {{considerations}} {{have been}} given for contestants who were unable to return as champion because of circumstances <b>beyond</b> <b>their</b> <b>control,</b> especially {{when there is a}} considerable time between taping of episodes. This occurred {{for the first time in}} season 25, when Priscilla Ball, who won on January 16, 2009, was unable to attend the taping of the next episode because of illness; as a result, three new contestants appeared on the next episode. Ball returned as a co-champion to play on the episode airing April 9, 2009. On the episode aired December 21, 2015, the returning champion, Claudia Corriere, could not return as champion because of a job offered in the weeks between tapings, so three new contestants played that day as well. Corriere returned as a co-champion on the January 18, 2016, episode, but was eliminated in a three-way loss.|$|E

Until 1997, individual tourists wishing to visit Mongolia needed a letter of invitation from either a Mongolian citizen or a foreign resident before being granted a visa. Since then the visa regime has been greatly liberalised with a resultant increase in tourism.|$|E

25|$|Economists {{note that}} {{governors}} generally have relatively {{little impact on}} their states' employment numbers, good or bad, as these are dominated by forces <b>beyond</b> <b>their</b> <b>control.</b> The statewide health care reforms that Romney helped enact, and signed into law in April 2006, exemplified the state's national leadership role in that industry; overall, there was a 7.6percent increase in job growth in healthcare and social assistance positions during Romney's term, the strongest growth during that time of any sector. Romney also personally intervened to help attract to the state, or maintain within the state, several large employers, such as Bristol-Myers Squibb and the Gillette division of Procter & Gamble. However, some business leaders said Romney’s policies that increased fees and corporate tax revenue drove up business costs and may have weakened job growth.|$|E
25|$|Cardinal: The {{cardinal}} {{signs are}} Aries, Cancer, Libra, and Capricorn. A native with mainly cardinal signs will {{not want to}} be held under anybody's thumb, and will need to take charge of their own world. Their attention may be concerned with themselves or others, but wherever their energies are directed it is difficult to deflect them from their chosen course. Cardinal signs in a chart will add courage, initiative and self-motivation. Cardinal subjects are hard to influence because they generally believe they know best. A subject lacking cardinal signs may feel they are never in control of their own lives, but are manipulated by people and circumstances <b>beyond</b> <b>their</b> <b>control.</b> They may lack courage and initiative and may prefer others to make decisions for them. Planets in the 1st, 4th, 7th and 10th houses, and an emphasis on fire and air signs in the chart will help to compensate for this lack.|$|E
25|$|Over the years, contradictions {{have arisen}} in the {{discussion}} of King's criticisms. The author once suggested that he disliked the film's downplaying of the supernatural; King had envisioned Jack as a victim of the genuinely external forces haunting the hotel, whereas King felt Kubrick had viewed the haunting and its resulting malignancy as coming from within Jack himself. In October 2013, however, journalist Laura Miller wrote that the discrepancy between the two was almost the complete opposite: the Jack Torrance of the novel was corrupted by his own choices – particularly alcoholism – whereas in Kubrick's adaptation the causes are actually more surreal and ambiguous:King is, essentially, a novelist of morality. The decisions his characters make — whether it’s to confront a pack of vampires or to break 10 years of sobriety — are what matter to him. But in Kubrick’s The Shining, the characters are largely in the grip of forces <b>beyond</b> <b>their</b> <b>control.</b> It’s a film in which domestic violence occurs, while King’s novel is about domestic violence as a choice certain men make when they refuse to abandon a delusional, defensive entitlement. As King sees it, Kubrick treats his characters like “insects” because the director doesn’t really consider them capable of shaping their own fates. Everything they do is subordinate to an overweening, irresistible force, which is Kubrick’s highly developed aesthetic; they are its slaves. In King’s “The Shining”, the monster is Jack. In Kubrick’s, the monster is Kubrick.|$|E

50|$|Tannhauser Gate, Tannhäuser Gate, and Tanhauser Gate are variant spellings of this unexplained {{place name}} {{which is used}} only once in the film.

500|$|Also {{contributing}} to the outbreak of war was a religious awakening which swept through Native settlements in the early 1760s. The movement was fed by discontent with the British as well as food shortages and epidemic disease. The most influential individual in this phenomenon was Neolin, known as the [...] "Delaware Prophet", who called upon Native Americans to shun the trade goods, alcohol, and weapons of the whites. Merging elements from Christianity into traditional religious beliefs, Neolin told listeners that the Master of Life was displeased with the Native Americans for taking up the bad habits of the white men, and that the British posed {{a threat to their}} very existence. [...] "If you suffer the English among you," [...] said Neolin, [...] "you are dead men. Sickness, smallpox, and their poison [...] will destroy you entirely."

500|$|His first book, Adrenaline, was {{published}} under the pseudonym James Dillinger. A {{story of two}} gay fugitive lovers on the run, it presaged the satire and drug fueled violence so prominent in his later books. Here Baker began developing the themes that dominated his following works: anarchy; angry and somewhat paranoid gay men; the dark underside of Los Angeles, juxtaposed with its sunny outward image; the hypocrisy of organized religion; anonymous sex and its implications {{in the age of}} AIDS; and homophobia and the oppression of gays in a Republican dominated America.See Also: Levy, Dan.

After the novel {{was published}}, he stopped screenwriting in order to solely concentrate on books.

Clark wrote the book to appeal specifically to a non-financially expert readership, feeling strongly that the mainstream has not received adequate explanation of the event and its causes.|$|R
500|$|It was {{announced}} for a release in North America {{under the title}} Muramasa: The Demon Blade in October 2008 for a release the following year. The game was originally being published by Xseed Games, but in April 2009 they announced that they were dropping the title from their schedule. Publishing rights were transferred to Ignition Entertainment. Ignition Entertainment later explained {{that it was in}} hot competition with Xseed and Atlus to acquire the American publishing rights, and after seeing Muramasa at TGS 2008 they were encouraged to apply for the rights. The change between publishers was an internal agreement between Xseed, their parent company Marvelous USA, and Ignition. The situation was amicably resolved as Xseed already had a large number of Wii titles lined up, and giving Muramasa to another publisher allowed multiple titles not to be overlooked when it came to Western publicity. The game released in North America on September 8, 2009. The game's localization was done by external localization companies in close collaboration with Ignition Entertainment. Due to the game's strong Japanese atmosphere, it was seen as a hard sell in the West, but during localization a lot of work went into preserving it rather than adjusting it for Western tastes. Due to this, the game was not dubbed into English, but instead retained its Japanese voice track while text was localized. An aspect Ignition worked hard with was to make sure the localization was of good quality by working closely with their chosen localization partners. This was due to backlash received by fans and critics over the [...] "lackluster" [...] localization of Lux-Pain, which had been <b>beyond</b> <b>their</b> <b>control</b> during development.|$|E

40|$|Understanding consumers’ {{allocation}} of environmental responsibility to external forces (i. e., those {{perceived to be}} <b>beyond</b> <b>their</b> direct <b>control)</b> is important yet under-researched. This paper examines how these external attributions affect consumers’ pro-environmental behaviors (PEBs). A model of external environmental locus of control (i. e., external-ELOC) is tested, consisting of two superordinate dimensions: powerful-others (encapsulating corporate and government responsibility facets) and chance/fate (incorporating God/higher-power and natural earth-cycle facets). The two higher-order factors negatively associate; such that consumers ascribing environmental responsibility to powerful-others engage in PEBs; whereas those attributing environmental change to chance/fate typically do not. The results inform practical and public policy implications; pinpointing ways for corporations and governments to target their pro-environmental efforts and to sway consumers who share in the ecological burden...|$|R

40|$|Badagry is {{the first}} {{community}} to receive the Christian religion in Nigeria. For this, every good reason exists to suppose that its coming into early contact with the missionaries should have caused the Ogu people to acquire a healthier understanding of fair play {{in the context of}} widowhood practices. Regrettably, they seem to respond more slowly to change in their attitudes to widows. Thus, despite the overwhelming presence of Christian relics in the ancient town of Badagry, traditional customs such as wife inheritance and widowhood rites have continued to appear significantly associated with violence against which women are not well-protected. “Gender Victimization: A Study of Widowhood Practices” among Ogu People of Lagos is the focus of this study. Quantitative and qualitative methods were adopted for the study. Thus, five in-depth interviews and three focus group discussion instruments were used to collect primary data, which were used to complement quantitative data. Although quantitative data were subjected to univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses, qualitative data were cleaned, reorganized into themes and analyzed. The study found that much as the Ogu people of Lagos acknowledge the position of the scriptures on society’s non-criminal relation with widows, they still believe that their culture comfortably drives the greater proportion of their widow-friendly interactions. This study suggests that the adoption of cultural best practices in handling women and their peculiar issues will tone down violence in customary widowhood practices and enable women who lost their husbands in circumstances <b>beyond</b> <b>their</b> <b>controls</b> access community-based support...|$|R
