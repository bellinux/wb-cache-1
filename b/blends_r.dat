40|$|This study {{examined}} the effects of copolymer hydrophilicity and temperature on water sorption and solubility characteristics of five copolymer blends of increasing degree of hydrophilicity using gravimetric measurements. Six resin disks (15 mm in diameter× 1 mm in thickness) were prepared from each copolymer blend and were stored in deionised water at 23, 37 and 55 °C. Water sorption and solubility of the resin disks were measured before and after water immersion and desiccation. Multiple regression analysis of water sorption was performed on two independent variables, copolymer hydrophilicity and temperature. Maximum water sorption increased significantly with Hoy's total cohesive energy density (δt), Hoy's solubility parameter for polar forces (δp) and hydrogen bonding (δh), but was not influenced by temperature. However, a significant positive relationship was observed between diffusion coefficients (obtained using Fick's law of diffusion) and temperature. The water absorption activation energy was 10 kJ/mol for the most hydrophilic copolymer blend R 5 and 35 - 51 kJ/mol for copolymer <b>blends</b> <b>R</b> 1 -R 4. The positive relationship between maximum water uptake and copolymer hydrophilicity suggests that water molecules diffuse through the polymer matrices by binding successively to the polar sites via hydrogen bonding. Such water sorption may determine the durability of resin-dentine bonds. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} chlorhexidine release from unfilled non-solvated methacrylate-based resins of increasing hydrophilicity and to examine relationships among Hoy's solubility parameters, water sorption, solubility and the rate of chlorhexidine release. Methods: Resin discs were prepared from light-cured, experimental resin <b>blends</b> (<b>R</b> 1, R 2, R 3, R 4 and R 5) containing 0. 0, 0. 2, 1. 0 and 2. 0 wt. % chlorhexidine diacetate (CDA). Discs were immersed in distilled water at 37 °C, and mass changes were recorded at different periods. Spectral measurements were made to follow change in optical densities of storage solution to examine chlorhexidine release kinetics. After a 28 -day period, water sorption, solubility, and the cumulative chlorhexidine release were obtained. Additionally, antibacterial study was performed by observing the presence of inhibition zone against Streptococcus mutans. Results: The most hydrophilic resin (R 5) exhibited the highest chlorhexidine release rate. The most hydrophobic resin (R 1) exhibited the lowest rate. However, no inhibition zone was produced by any specimens stored in water for 2 weeks. The addition of CDA increased solubility significantly but had no effect on water sorption. Significant positive correlations were seen between water sorption and the cumulative chlorhexidine release. Significance: Chlorhexidine release from resins may be related to water-induced swelling, which in turn is enhanced by the hydrophilicity of cured polymer matrix. © 2008 Academy of Dental Materials. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|E

FS and FM were analyzed using two-way ANOVA, withresin material, CDA concentration and storage time as independentfactors. Knoop hardness was analysed using two-way ANOVA,with resin material and CDA concentration as independent factors. Results: Incorporation of CDA had no signiﬁcant effect on FS ofdry and wet R 1, R 2 and R 3 specimens. FM of dry R 1, R 2 and R 3 specimens decreased signiﬁcantly (P < 0. 05) with increasing con-centration of CDA. No signiﬁcant effect of CDA on FM of wetR 1, R 2 and R 3 specimens was observed. In general, FS and FM ofneat and CDA-incorporated R 1, R 2 and R 3 specimens decreasedsigniﬁcantly (P < 0. 05) following water storage.

40|$|Papers {{presented}} to the 11 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, South Africa, 20 - 23 July 2015. Supercritical Organic Rankine Cycle is introduced as promising technology for low grade waste heat recovery. The advantage of this supercritical cycle is a better thermal match between the heat source and the working fluid temperature profiles in the supercritical heat exchanger. Heat exchangers have {{a vital part of}} this cycle, in manner of cycle efficiency and for the economic feasibility of one ORC installation. There are many challenges in the design process of these components suitable to operate at relatively high pressure and temperature. The reason for that is strong properties variation of the organic working fluid at supercritical state. Since, the value of the heat transfer coefficient depends on these thermophysical properties of the working fluid, it is important to study and understand the behavior of the properties of the fluid going from subcritical to supercritical state. The supercritical heat exchanger was first modeled in EES software, and then designed and built. For the designing procedure of the heat exchanger several different correlations available from literature were selected. These correlations have been previously validated at supercritical state, but for working fluids such as H 2 O, CO 2 and refrigerants <b>blends</b> <b>R</b> 404 a and R 410 a.

Part 1 of this project consisted of conducting comprehensive measurements of thermophysical for refrigerant R 125 and refrigerant <b>blends</b> <b>R</b> 410 A and R 507 A and developing new equation of state formulations and mixture models for predicting thermophysical properties of HFC refrigerant blends. Part 2 of this project conducted performance measurements of split-system, 3 -ton R 22 and R 410 A residential air conditioners in the 80 to 135 F (27. 8 to 57. 2 C) outdoor temperature range and development of a system performance model. The performance data was used in preparing a beta version of EVAP-COND, a windows-based simulation package for predicting performance of finned-tube evaporators and condensers. The modeling portion of this project also included the formulation of a model for an air-conditioner equipped with a thermal expansion valve (TXV). Capacity and energy efficiency ratio (EER) were measured and compared. The R 22 system's performance was measured over the outdoor ambient temperature range of 80 to 135 F (27. 8 to 57. 2 C). The same test range was planned for the R 410 A system. However, the compressor's safety system cut off the compressor at the 135. 0 F (57. 2 C) test temperature. The highest measurement on this system was at 130. 0 F (54. 4 C). Subsequently, a custom-manufactured R 410 A compressor with a disabled safety system and a more powerful motor was installed and performance was measured at outdoor temperatures up to 155. 0 F (68. 3 C). Both systems had similar capacity and EER performance at 82. 0 F (27. 8 C). The capacity and EER degradation of both systems were nearly linearly dependent with rising ambient outdoor ambient test temperatures. The performance degradation of R 410 A at higher temperatures was greater than R 22. However, the R 22 and R 410 A systems both operated normally during all tests.

Part 1 of this project consisted of measuring thermodynamic properties R 125, R 410 A and R 507 A, measuring viscosity and thermal conductivity of R 410 A and R 507 A and comparing data to mixture models in NIST REFPROP database. For R 125, isochoric (constant volume) heat capacity was measured over a temperature range of 305 to 397 K (32 to 124 C) at pressures up to 20 MPa. For R 410 A, isochoric heat capacity was measured along 8 isochores with a temperature range of 303 to 397 K (30 to 124 C) at pressures up to 18 MPa. Pressure-density-temperature was also measured along 14 isochores over a temperature range of 200 to 400 K (- 73 to 127 C) at pressures up to 35 MPa and thermal conductivity along 6 isotherms over a temperature range of 301 to 404 K (28 to 131 C) with pressures to 38 MPa. For R 507 A, viscosity was measured along 5 isotherms over a temperature range of 301 to 421 K (28 to 148 C) at pressures up to 83 MPa and thermal conductivity along 6 isotherms over a temperature range of 301 to 404 K (28 to 131 C) with pressures to 38 MPa.

The present article focuses on the climate performance of three different refrigerants used to replace the hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), R 22, for common refrigeration applications. The original system consists of a small commercial refrigeration system, which provides nominal refrigerating capacity of 15 kW. The condition of replacement of R 22 by these alternative fluids (R 290, R 32 and R 410 A) represented a drop-in operation; there were no changes in the basic cycle components during the tests, {{with the exception of}} the lubricating oil. Experimental tests were carried out in steady state condition and throughout the tests the compressor had its entire speed range explored for different levels of modulation of the electronic expansion valve (EEV), thus enabling the realization of a complete thermodynamic analysis. The use of the hydrofluorocarbon (HFC), R 32, which has a low global warming potential (GWP) and zero ozone-depleting potential (ODP) guaranteed good efficiency to the refrigeration system.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{analysis to}} investigate the heat transfer performance of HFC refrigerant mixtures when condensing inside a horizontal smooth tube is being carried out at the Dipartimento di Fisica Tecnica of the University of Padova. HFC fluids, pure or blended, are considered as possible substitutes for R 22, whose phase out is underway in Europe. As first choice, pure fluids and near-azeotropic HFC mixtures (such as R 410 A) can be used. Some of the fluids under consideration may display a high operating pressure. When the substitution for traditional ozone-depleting refrigerants {{involves the use of}} high pressure fluids, this usually implies a reduction of friction losses, with higher energetic performance, and a reduction {{of the size of the}} plant. R 410 A is a binary mixture with a very low boiling range (around 0. 1 °C) obtained by <b>blending</b> <b>R</b> 125 and R 32 at 50 / 50 % mass composition. Alternatively, highly zeotropic mixtures can be used as substitutes, above all when searching for new fluids to be utilised in high temperature compression cycles. Zeotropic mixtures with high temperature glide could be used for developing new Lorentz-cycle machines. In fact, optimization of the temperature profiles in the heat exchangers and higher efficiency in some industrial processes, such as drying and heating of water with compression heat pumps, are eligible to be obtained by developing an inverse Lorentz cycle machine. On the other hand, employing zeotropic mixtures as alternative working fluids may introduce some heat transfer problems in the practical use, namely the degradation of heat transfer coefficients caused by the zeotropic characteristics of the mixture. The heat transfer penalty is mainly due to the mass transfer thermal resistance build-up. The investigation is carried out by blending (at three different mass compositions) two pure HFC fluids characterised by having far different pressure at the same saturation temperature. R 125 in the present case is the “high pressure” fluid, while R 236 ea can be considered a “low pressure” fluid. Mixing of those two HFC fluids results in a high temperature glide mixture. The mixture tested is a refrigerant <b>blend</b> of <b>R</b> 125 and R 236 ea, of 46 / 54 % mass composition, characterised by a temperature glide of 21 °C at a nominal saturation pressure of 1000 kPa...|$|R
40|$|In {{the recent}} years much {{attention}} has been paid to the use of fluorinated propene isomers for the substitution of high-GWP refrigerants in refrigeration and air conditioning applications. However, the HFOs (hydrofluoroolefins) cannot cover all the applications due to their thermodynamic properties. For the purpose to obtain a fluid that brings together the good heat transfer characteristics of HFCs, such as R 410 A, and the environmental friendly behavior of HFOs, in the latest literature it was attempted to <b>blend</b> <b>R</b> 1234 ze(E) with another refrigerant, R 32. R 32 has relatively low GWP and excellent thermodynamic characteristics. Therefore, a zeotropic mixture of R 1234 ze(E) and R 32 can be used in the field of air-conditioning due to its mild impact on the environment. In this paper, a mixture of R 1234 ze(E) and R 32 (0. 5 / 0. 5 by mass) is investigated. In particular the frictional pressure gradient and the local heat transfer coefficients during flow boiling and condensation of this mixture in a single microchannel with 0. 96 mm diameter are measured. Tests are carried out in the experimental apparatus available at the Two Phase Heat Transfer Lab of the University of Padova. The heat transfer coefficients are compared against predicting models available in the literature. The new experimental data are also compared to heat transfer data of pure R 1234 ze(E) and R 32. This allows to analyze the heat transfer penalization due to the mass transfer resistance of this zeotropic mixture. Pressure drop data are also used to assess predicting pressure gradient correlations...|$|R

Especially R 134 a is under pressure and likely to be phased out of all commercial systems. Since the regulation has just been adopted andthere is still {{a great deal of}} uncertainty as to what will happen. we follow the situation closely and just like other experts we expect the use of low GWP refrigerants to grow with intermediate solutions emerging like for instance R 152 a as substitution for R 134 a; although these solutions are intermediate {{they are likely to be}} used for some years into the future. We also expect new <b>blends</b> of <b>R</b> 152 a and R 134 a to play a role yet to be seen. In the present work, the performance of the Air cooled water cooler test rig based on vapour compression refrigeration cycle is studied by using R 134 a and on the basis of their experimental result, we studying the result of R 152 a and <b>blending</b> of <b>R</b> 152 a with R 134 a in various mass fraction with help of Refprop property software. The result are analyzed in terms of Coefficient of performance(cop), Refrigeration capacity, compressor work, condenser capacity, specific volume, Thermal conductivity and miscibility of lubricants shows that R 152 a, R 134 a/R 152 a- 30 / 70 and R 134 a/R 152 a- 10 / 90 is possible alternate for R 134 a...|$|R
