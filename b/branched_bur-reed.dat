25|$|The River Hull valley {{dominates the}} western {{landscape}} of Holderness. The river {{and its associated}} wetland habitats support a diverse range of plants and animals. The upper tributaries of the river originate {{on the edge of}} the Yorkshire Wolds before entering the area of glacial and alluvial deposits of Holderness. The river bed varies in composition reflecting the underlying geology. In the upper reaches of the river water crowfoot, lesser water parsnip, mares tail and spiked water milfoil may be found in the main channel whilst the marginal vegetation is composed of <b>branched</b> <b>bur-reed,</b> common reed and reed sweetgrass.|$|E

50|$|The {{vegetation}} {{is mainly}} of {{a mosaic of}} yellow iris Iris pseudacorus, <b>branched</b> <b>bur-reed</b> Sparganium erectum and rushes Juncus spp., while greater tussock-sedge Carex paniculata is locally dominant. Other conspicuous plants include meadowsweet Filipendula ulmaria, marsh-marigold Caltha palustris, ragged robin Lychnis flos-cuculi, watermint Mentha aquatica and southern marsh-orchid Dactylorhiza praetermissa. Also present are four species which are local in Devon: wood club-rush Scirpus sylvaticus, marsh valerian Valeriana dioica, fen bedstraw Galium uliginosum and common spike-rush Eleocharis palustris. The stream is bordered {{for most of its}} length by alder Alnus glutinosa, with a ground flora dominated by ramsons Allium ursinum.|$|E
50|$|The loch is botanically-rich loch and Martnaham Wood {{is one of}} {{the largest}} oak woods in Ayrshire; {{although}} it was clear felled in 1914, it has regenerated with little disturbance. The loch exhibits vegetation of submerged, floating and emergent type plant communities. The margin has extensive areas of reed-swamp dominated by common reed. <b>Branched</b> <b>bur-reed,</b> water-plantain, nodding bur-marigold, trifid bur-marigold, greater spearwort, and eight-stamened waterwort are found at the site. In the deeper water white and yellow water-lilies dominate. Canadian pondweed is an invasive plant and is here in abundance. The loch is classed as mesotrophic (moderately nutrient-rich), however it has eutrophic characteristics.|$|E
5000|$|During summers {{phytoplankton}} {{are dominated}} by cyanobacteria and occasionally diatoms, most commonly Aphanizomenon cf gracile but also Pseudanabaena limnetica, Planktolyngbya sp. and various species of Anabaena, of whom only Aphanizomenon is potentially poisonous and Anabaena frequently causes algal bloom. Carapace flagellates such as Ceratium hirundinella and various dinoflagellates, are few but important to the lake's biomass. Various rotifers are common zooplankton but cyclopoid copepods can also be found. An inventory of aquatic plants in the lake in 1998 resulted in a list of some 30 species, including <b>branched</b> <b>bur-reed</b> and Nuttall's waterweed (the latter introduced in Europe during the 20th century and relatively new in Sweden.) ...|$|E
50|$|In the {{south-eastern}} {{part of the}} lake, phytoplanktons {{are dominated}} by various species of cyanobacterias, {{some of which are}} nitrogen-binding and potentially poisonous, and exceptionally other nutrient-demanding algae and dinoflagellates. Zooplankton are only found in small quantities. Variations in quantity appears between the southern and northern parts of the lake, with more an abundant presence of green algae in the northern end where dinoflagellates are substituted also by diatoms. Striking when it comes to aquatic plants is the abundance of spiked water-milfoil and rigid hornswort in the north-western part of the lake. An inventory in 1998 also documented Chara globularis, common waterweed, white water-lily, yellow water-lily, <b>branched</b> <b>bur-reed,</b> flowering rush, and Stratiotes aloides.|$|E
50|$|The large pond is {{populated}} with spiked water-milfoil (Myriophylium spicatum), Canadian waterweed (Elodea canadensis), yellow-flowered fringed water-lily (Nymphoides peltata), and beds of bulrush (Typha latifolia), common reed (Phragmites australis), sea club-rush (Scirpus maritimus) and grey club-rush (Schoenoplectus tabernaemontani). The pond provides a habitat and {{breeding ground for}} a variety of waterfowl such as the mute swan, tufted duck, coot and dabchick. Other avians species nesting at the pond include gadwall, water rail, reed warbler, sedge warbler, reed bunting and other passerines. The three smaller ponds are more shallow - one sufficiently so to dry up in times of low rainfall. They host rushes (Juncaceae) and bulrush, water mint (Mentha aquatica), false fox-sedge (Carex otrubae), great willowherb (Epilobium hirsutum), common fleabane (Pulicaria dysenterica), gipsywort (Lyccous europaeus), <b>branched</b> <b>bur-reed</b> (Sparganium erectum), common marsh-bedstraw (Galium palusrre), and water-plantain (Alisma plantago-aquatica). Two species, parsley water-dropwort (Oenanthe lachenalii) and sea club-rush indicate brackish water.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to reduce {{uncertainty}} in roughness information for instream vegetation. This in turn reduces the uncertainty in estimating water levels in channels where aquatic vegetation is present. Roughness plays an essential role in water level estimation as it reduces the discharge capacity through energy expenditure on boundary generated turbulence as well as through physical blockages by vegetation. Apart from the hydrology analysis for determining the inflow to the river system, the largest source of uncertainty for estimating water levels in channels is roughness (Latapie, 2003; Mc Gahey, 2006). Of the different roughness types, vegetation roughness includes the greatest natural variability (e. g. Sellin & van Beesten, 2004; Defra/EA, 2003 a). The hypothesis that measures of plant growth can explain variation in roughness for vegetated channels was tested. Presented here is a snapshot of roughness measures made in vegetated channels at the height of the growing season. One source of variability in roughness values was quantified which is the regional difference in roughness values attributable to differences in aquatic plant growth. This work focused on sites dominated by either submerged Ranunculus spp. (water crowfoot) or the emergent Sparganium erectum (<b>branched</b> <b>bur-reed).</b> These 2 taxa are among the most common higher aquatic plants in UK rivers. Rivers were sampled from the Scottish border in the north to the south coast of England. Sites (36) were chosen carefully to provide a very wide range of growing conditions. Both roughness, as Manning’s n, and plant growth varied substantially between sites. At S. erectum sites Manning’s n was 0. 125 sm- 1 / 3 + / - 0. 04 standard error (s. e.) and at Ranunculus spp. sites Manning’s n was 0. 124 sm- 1 / 3 + / - 0. 0168 s. e. For all sites it was possible to reduce uncertainty by attributing variability in Manning’s n to standing crop. A plant index, combining 3 measures of abundance, explained 70 % of the variation in Manning’s n for Ranunculus spp. sites while 28 % of variation in Manning’s n at S. erectum sites was explained by the % cross sectional area occupied by the plant. The application of biometric error reduction models to conveyance estimation is discussed...|$|E
