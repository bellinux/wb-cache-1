The benefits of sericulture are threefold: the trees provide good soil erosion control; the silk production is ideally suited to small-scale production and sericulture is also labour intensive thereby providing employment opportunities for many poor rural people. Existing IT silk production projects in India have been extremely successful significantly improving the living standards of the rural people involved.

There were three applicative models which were tested: the P 1 Model= introduction of two goats into the silkworm farming system to enable them to utilize mulberry leaves that are not consumed by the silkworms; the P 2 Model= Using the whole mulberry plants as feed ingredients for two feedlot cattle; the P 3 Model= Selling mulberry leaves produced for concentrate ingredient. Parameter measured was net income generated from each model. Result of the study indicated that integration models of mulberry plant with livestock have their own uniqueness to be applied. The highest income for farmer was obtained when the whole mulberry plant was used as feedstuff for feedlot cattle (the P 2 model).

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyze the {{financial}} management of the cooperative silk−reeling filatures in Shimoina County, Nagano Prefecture between W. W. I and W. W. II. The earlier researches elucidate that the cooperative silk−reeling filatures in the Ina area produced comparatively high grade thread, but those researches have not focused on their managements including the financial conditions. This paper conducts a comparative research on the financial management of five cooperative silk−reeling filatures in the county. Through this research, the following facts are cleared up. First, during the 1920 s the sources of capital changed. Local banks had previously supplied capitals for the cooperatives, but during the 1920 s the investments in the cooperatives of their members increased and local credit cooperatives, which were their affiliates, injected capital into them. As a result their equity capital was reinforced. Along with the previous loans from local banks, Sangyõ kumiai chuõkinko (the central bank for cooperatives) financed them as a national agricultural policy. During the 1930 s, when the Great Depression occurred, their high equity ratios were maintained. Although the investments of their members and the local credit cooperatives declined and the national loans of Sangyõ kumiai chuõkinko started to compose the main portion of their budgets. Second, during that time the spending policy of their budgets was converted. In the early 1920 s, when the cooperatives were established, the price of silk cocoons was kept higher than the market price of them to maintain the cocoon supply from the cooperative members. In the late 1920 s, when the cooperative achieved high management performance, they started to invest their profits in their production facilities. The cooperatives continued to apply that strategy to a countermeasure against the Great Depression. One of the remarkable examples is Taishõkan filature of Yamabuki Cooperative Association, which introduced multi−ends reeling machines under the economic hardship of the Great Depression. Finally, those cooperatives took various measures to ensure high−quality cocoons for high grade thread. For instances, they standardized the sort <b>of</b> <b>silkworm</b> <b>eggs</b> which they recommended, sent technical supervisors to their members’ houses, and provided extra incentives for cocoons of fine quality...|$|R

Justin II agreed and sent an embassy to the Turkic Khaganate, ensuring the direct silk trade desired by the Sogdians. However, even with the Byzantine production of silk starting in the 6th century, Chinese varieties were still considered of better quality, a fact that is perhaps underscored by the discovery of a Byzantine solidus coin minted during the reign of Justin II found in a Sui dynasty (581-618 AD) Chinese tomb of Shanxi province in 1953, among other Byzantine coins found at various sites. According to Chinese histories, the Byzantines (i.e. [...] "Fu-lin"), maintaining an earlier Roman diplomatic tradition in China, also sent several embassies to the court of the Chinese Tang dynasty (618-907 AD) and on one occasion to that of the Song dynasty (960-1279), offering exotic gifts such as glasswares while demonstrating a continual interest in the Chinese silk trade. The 7th-century Byzantine historian Theophylact Simocatta provided a fairly accurate depiction of China, its geography, its reunification by the Sui dynasty (581-618), and even named its ruler Taisson as meaning [...] "Son of God", perhaps also derived from the name Emperor Taizong of Tang (r. 626-649).

To test whether the blastoderm absorbs yolk through the plasma membrane in B. mori, we studied the interaction of phospholipid membranes and yolk using a phospholipid planar bilayer membrane (PBM) and liposomes. In addition, egg-specific protein (ESP; 225 kDa), a yolk protein that is specific to B. mori eggs, was collected by fractionating the eggs. Liposomes were mixed with either B. mori yolk or ESP, and observed under an electron microscope. This showed that the phospholipid membrane was spanned by fine particles 10 – 20 nm in diameter. Both yolk and ESP caused the PBM to become extraordinarily leaky, with a membrane potential of − 70 mV for yolk and − 198 mV for ESP. These results suggest that although it is a water-soluble protein, ESP permeates the phospholipid membrane {{without the help of}} enzymes...|$|R
