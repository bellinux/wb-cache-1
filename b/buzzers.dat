5|$|The Bauer {{children}} {{learned to}} play hockey in a backyard rink, and Bobby grew up playing youth hockey in Kitchener–Waterloo before moving to Toronto in 1930 where he attended St. Michael's College and played junior first with the St. Michael's <b>Buzzers</b> in 1930–31 followed by three years with the St. Michael's Majors. In 1933–34, Bauer recorded 15 points in 13 Memorial Cup playoff games to help the Majors capture the Dominion junior championship. Bauer played his final year of junior in 1934–35 with the Kitchener Greenshirts where he first played with Milt Schmidt and Woody Dumart, who was then a defenceman.|$|E
5|$|The Joker {{possesses}} no superhuman abilities, instead {{using his}} expertise in chemical engineering to develop poisonous or lethal concoctions, and thematic weaponry, including razor-tipped playing cards, deadly joy <b>buzzers,</b> and acid-spraying lapel flowers. The Joker sometimes works with other Gotham City supervillains {{such as the}} Penguin and Two-Face, and groups like the Injustice Gang and Injustice League, but these relationships often collapse due to the Joker's desire for unbridled chaos. The 1990s introduced a romantic interest for the Joker in his former psychiatrist, Harley Quinn, who becomes his villainous sidekick. Although his primary obsession is Batman, the Joker has also fought other heroes including Superman and Wonder Woman.|$|E
5|$|After his league leading performance, he {{was drafted}} by the Toronto St. Michael's Majors of the Ontario Hockey League with the seventh {{selection}} of the tenth round, but instead of playing for them, he spent the following two seasons playing in the Ontario Junior Hockey League (OPJHL) for the St. Michael's <b>Buzzers.</b> During the 2005–06 season, he led the OPJHL in scoring with 73 points in 48 games and led the team to the OPJHL championship. Caporusso scored 50 points in 37 games during the 2006–07 season, but the team lost in the finals. Following the season, {{he was drafted}} with the 90th selection overall {{in the third round}} by the Ottawa Senators in the June 22, 2007 NHL Entry Draft.|$|E
50|$|The first golden <b>buzzer</b> {{aired in}} the first episode, when Cowell pressed it in Manchester for Calum Scott. The second golden <b>buzzer</b> was aired in the second episode, when Ant and Dec pressed it in Edinburgh for BoyBand. Holden's golden <b>buzzer</b> for Revelation Avenue aired during the third episode. Dixon's golden <b>buzzer</b> for Entity Allstars aired during the fifth episode. Finally, Walliams's golden <b>buzzer</b> for Lorraine Bowen {{happened}} in the sixth episode.|$|R
50|$|Holden {{pressing}} her golden <b>buzzer</b> for singer Beau Dermott was broadcast on the series premiere on 9 April. Dixon's press of the <b>buzzer</b> for the 100 Voices of Gospel aired {{in the second}} episode. Walliams' <b>buzzer</b> press for Anne & Ian Marshall aired in the third episode. Ant & Dec pressed the <b>buzzer</b> in the fourth episode for singer Jasmine Elcock. Cowell was the final judge to push his golden <b>buzzer</b> for dance act Boogie Storm.|$|R
25|$|In season 5, the Golden <b>Buzzer</b> is introduced. Each judge can {{press the}} Golden <b>Buzzer</b> only once per season. Any act on whom the Golden <b>Buzzer</b> is used will {{automatically}} {{advance to the}} live semi-finals.|$|R
5|$|The {{character}} appeared {{less frequently}} after 1964, when Julius Schwartz (who disliked the Joker) became {{editor of the}} Batman comics. The character risked becoming an obscure figure of the preceding era until this goofy prankster version of the character was adapted into the 1966 television series Batman, {{in which he was}} played by Cesar Romero. The show's popularity compelled Schwartz to keep the comics in a similar vein. As the show's popularity waned, however, so did that of the Batman comics. After the TV series ended in 1968, the increase in public visibility had not stopped the comic's sales decline; editorial director Carmine Infantino resolved to turn things around, moving stories away from schoolboy-friendly adventures. The Silver Age introduced several of the Joker's defining character traits: lethal joy <b>buzzers,</b> acid-squirting flowers, trick guns, and goofy, elaborate crimes.|$|E
25|$|E Company, {{the signal}} company trained in radio, telephone, telegraph, <b>buzzers,</b> and visual signalling.|$|E
25|$|Car Park Catchphrase: In {{a parody}} of the TV gameshow Catchphrase, two {{phone-in}} contestants in their cars are challenged to guess a catchphrase answer from an anecdote-style clue, using their car horns as <b>buzzers.</b>|$|E
50|$|A joy <b>buzzer</b> is {{an example}} of a purely {{mechanical}} <b>buzzer.</b> They require drivers.|$|R
5000|$|Gordon pressed Angela's <b>buzzer</b> during Jodel Sjonnie's {{performance}} and Angela pressed Gordon's <b>buzzer</b> afterward.|$|R
50|$|Another new {{addition}} to this season is the golden <b>buzzer.</b> During the live auditions, there is a golden <b>buzzer</b> placed {{in the center of}} the judges' table. The <b>buzzer</b> is pressed by a judge on an act to send directly to the live semi-finals. Each judge is allowed to press the <b>buzzer</b> only once during the whole duration of the auditions.|$|R
25|$|Additional scales such as decibels, and {{measurement}} {{functions such as}} capacitance, transistor gain, frequency, duty cycle, display hold, and <b>buzzers</b> which sound when the measured resistance is small have been included on many multimeters. While multimeters may be supplemented by more specialized equipment in a technician's toolkit, some multimeters include additional functions for specialized applications (temperature with a thermocouple probe, inductance, connectivity to a computer, speaking measured value, etc.).|$|E
25|$|Both {{versions}} of the game have a different control scheme. In the PlayStation 2 version, The game uses Buzz! <b>buzzers,</b> four of which are bundled with the game. In the Wii version, players {{have to use the}} D-pad to choose an answer. There's also an option to use motion controls. In the motion control scheme, players hold the B button while jerking the Wii remote up, down, left or right to choose an answer.|$|E
25|$|In {{the morning}} {{on the day of}} recording, the studio has to be set up. Seven cameras are used to record QI. To check images, forfeits, <b>buzzers</b> and {{lighting}} are working, the first technical rehearsal is hosted by floor manager Guy Smart with stand-ins for panelists. Fry, who has been given the list of questions roughly an hour beforehand, hosts the second technical rehearsal at 2:00 pm. Guests may have time to practise with a set of warm-up questions.|$|E
5000|$|Simon Cowell {{pressing}} his golden <b>buzzer</b> for singer Sarah Ikumu was broadcast on the series premiere on 15 April. Alesha Dixon pressed the <b>buzzer</b> for MerseyGirls (who {{were known as}} [...] "Just Us" [...] in their audition) aired in the second episode which aired on 22 April. Amanda Holden pressed the <b>buzzer</b> in the third episode for comedian Daliso Chaponda. Ant and Dec pressed the <b>buzzer</b> during the fifth episode for magician Matt Edwards. David Walliams pressed the <b>buzzer</b> for singer Kyle Tomlinson during the sixth episode.|$|R
50|$|<b>Buzzer</b> {{reveals his}} {{knowledge}} of Joe headquarters to the others when the Joes attack Springfield. <b>Buzzer</b> finally tells his information to all of Cobra high command. Soon after he participates in a multi-Dreadnok attack on Serpentor. This fails. <b>Buzzer's</b> attempt at a reward for this information is brushed off by Zartan, who is still mad that <b>Buzzer</b> took his bike without permission. This information allows Cobra to successfully destroy Joe headquarters soon after. <b>Buzzer</b> is the getaway driver for this mission, allowing many Dreadnoks, Cobra Troopers and Cobra underwater 'E.E.L.S' to escape.|$|R
50|$|Each of {{the four}} judges had one chance to use the Golden <b>Buzzer.</b> Mandel {{was the first one}} whose use of the Golden <b>Buzzer</b> was aired, doing so on {{stuttering}} comedian Drew Lynch. Contemporary dance duo Freckled Sky became the second Golden Act whose performance was aired, with Stern using the Golden <b>Buzzer</b> on them. Brown was the third judge seen using the Golden <b>Buzzer,</b> this time on gospel singer Sharon Irving. Klum was the last to utilize the Golden <b>Buzzer,</b> with 11-year-old opera singer Arielle Baril being its recipient.|$|R
25|$|Greenlandic Inuit {{music is}} largely based around singing and drums, {{the latter being}} {{generally}} reserved for large celebrations and other gatherings. Though there is much folk vocal music, there is no Inuit purely instrumental tradition with no accompaniment by singing or dancing. Greenlandic drums are mostly frame drums made of animal skin stretched over a wooden frame and decorated with decorative and symbolic motifs by the drummer. Aside from drums, whistles, bull-roarers and <b>buzzers</b> are also widespread, and the jaw harp and fiddle are both found, most likely recent imports.|$|E
25|$|It was 21 {{years before}} the Greys again made it as far in the playoffs. In 1960-61, they {{finished}} first in the Central Junior B Hockey League and rolled to the championship by defeating the Hamilton Bees and the Siskins, avenging the 1940 loss. Owen Sound then eliminated the St. Marys Lincolns in a semifinal series but {{ran out of gas}} in the Sutherland Cup final against the St. Michael's <b>Buzzers,</b> losing in four straight games. To this day, the Greys have never made it back to the Sutherland Cup final.|$|E
25|$|Montador played minor {{ice hockey}} with the Mississauga Senators of the Greater Toronto Hockey League (GTHL). He began his junior hockey career in 1995–96 with the St. Michael's <b>Buzzers</b> {{of the junior}} A Ontario Provincial Junior Hockey League (OPJHL). He moved up to the Ontario Hockey League (OHL) the {{following}} season and, through a four-year major junior career with the North Bay Centennials, Erie Otters and Peterborough Petes, scored 174 points and 429 penalty minutes in 251 games. In his final junior season, 1999–2000, Montador was the Petes' leading scorer among defencemen with 56 points.|$|E
50|$|In basketball, a <b>buzzer</b> beater is a {{shot that}} is taken {{before the game}} clock of a quarter, a half, or an {{overtime}} period expires but does not go in the basket until after the clock expires and the <b>buzzer</b> sounds. The term is normally reserved for baskets that beat an end-of-quarter/half/overtime <b>buzzer</b> but is sometimes referred to shots that beat the shot clock <b>buzzer.</b> If a player releases the ball before the <b>buzzer</b> sounds, the shot still counts if it goes in even though the clock expires before the ball goes through the hoop.|$|R
50|$|The judges auditions also {{feature the}} Golden <b>Buzzer.</b> Each judge would have one chance {{to use the}} Golden <b>Buzzer.</b> The {{so-called}} Golden Acts, those on whom the Golden <b>Buzzer</b> is used, would automatically advance to the Semi-Finals. Wu {{was the first to}} press the Golden <b>Buzzer</b> on Japanese popping act Time Machine, followed by Melanie C on Chinese acrobat-dancer couple Gao Lin and Liu Xin and Anggun on Filipino shadow play group El Gamma Penumbra. Foster was the last judge to push the Golden <b>Buzzer,</b> using it on Filipina singer/soprano Gerphil Flores.|$|R
50|$|The golden <b>buzzer</b> {{returned}} for its third series. Walliams confirmed on 16 January {{that the first}} golden <b>buzzer</b> was used by Holden at the Liverpool auditions. Dixon and Ant & Dec both pressed theirs on 23 January, and Walliams pressed his <b>buzzer</b> on 27 January at the London auditions. Cowell was the final person to press the <b>buzzer</b> and did so on 5 February at the Birmingham auditions.|$|R
25|$|In contrast, Japanese {{manufacturers}} {{shared their}} information, quickly overcoming technical and manufacturing challenges and creating new markets. In Japan, a temperature stable crystal cut {{was developed by}} Issac Koga. Japanese efforts in materials research created piezoceramic materials competitive to the United States materials but free of expensive patent restrictions. Major Japanese piezoelectric developments included new designs of piezoceramic filters for radios and televisions, piezo <b>buzzers</b> and audio transducers that can connect directly to electronic circuits, and the piezoelectric igniter, which generates sparks for small engine ignition systems and gas-grill lighters, by compressing a ceramic disc. Ultrasonic transducers that transmit sound waves through air had existed {{for quite some time}} but first saw major commercial use in early television remote controls. These transducers now are mounted on several car models as an echolocation device, helping the driver determine the distance from the car to any objects that may be in its path.|$|E
25|$|Divisions {{organised}} attacks {{according to}} SS 135 (Instructions {{for the training}} of Platoons for Offensive Action) of December 1916. The pamphlet {{was derived from the}} experience of the Somme in 1916 for divisions to organise according to a common pattern and prescribed the siege warfare methods necessary for trench-to-trench attacks, the semi-open fighting, when defensive positions had been captured and open warfare techniques, for when the defence collapsed. All the sections of SS 135 addressed the problem of command when no voice communication existed by prescribing that a commander's intention must be communicated and that the infantry should make every effort to send back information by any means available, primarily by visual methods which needed specialist parties to advance with the infantry to set up relay stations, carrier pigeons, experimental wireless sets, power <b>buzzers,</b> signal lamps and runners, who were trained to use the terrain and know the trench systems for maximum protection.|$|E
25|$|Each {{contestant}} that auditions {{is given}} a number by the production team and remains in the waiting area until called out into the wings, giving them {{a certain amount of}} time to prepare their act. Upon being allowed onto the main stage, they will usually be asked by one of the judges for their name and what they plan to perform, along with other details such as age, occupation, personal background, and what they wish to achieve if they won. After this, they are then given three minutes to conduct their performance before both the judges and a live audience, with some acts being supported by a backing track provided by the production team. If at any time, the judges find the performance to be unconvincing, boring or completely wrong, they may use the buzzer before them, which changes the Xs from white to red; if all the judges press their <b>buzzers,</b> then the performance is immediately over.|$|E
50|$|The judges' auditions also {{feature the}} Golden <b>Buzzer.</b> Each judge would have one chance {{to use the}} Golden <b>Buzzer.</b> The {{so-called}} Golden Acts, those on whom the Golden <b>Buzzer</b> is used, would automatically advance to the Semi-Finals. Hoai Linh {{was the first to}} press the Golden <b>Buzzer</b> on Bùi Văn Tự , followed by Thanh Loc on Nhóm 4 chị em and Huy Tuan on Dương Thị Huỳnh Mai.|$|R
50|$|The golden <b>buzzer</b> {{returned}} for its second series. The first golden <b>buzzer</b> used was by Ant & Dec at the Edinburgh auditions for dance troupe Boyband. Cowell pressed the golden <b>buzzer</b> {{on the first}} day of the Manchester auditions for singer Calum Scott. Holden used her <b>buzzer</b> during the Birmingham auditions for choir Revelation Avenue. Dixon used hers during the first day of the London auditions for dance act Entity Allstars, leaving just Walliams who confirmed via Twitter that he used his Golden <b>Buzzer</b> on the last day of auditions in London for a comedy singer, Lorraine Bowen.|$|R
50|$|The guest judges each {{also had}} one chance {{to use the}} Golden <b>Buzzer</b> on any act during their {{participation}} without consultation from the regular panel. Like the Golden Acts selected by the regular judges, the Golden Acts chosen by the guest judges also {{went straight to the}} live rounds. On the July 14 episode, Neil Patrick Harris used his golden <b>buzzer</b> on magician Piff the Magic Dragon. On the July 21 episode, Michael Bublé used his golden <b>buzzer</b> on singing duo The CraigLewis Band, although he was initially hesitant to do so. Marlon Wayans used his <b>buzzer</b> on ventriloquist comedian Paul Zerdin on the July 28 episode. Japanese light-and-sound dance troupe Siro-A became the last Golden <b>Buzzer</b> act of the season when former judge Piers Morgan used the Golden <b>Buzzer</b> on them.|$|R
25|$|Contestants {{that make}} it into the semi-finals after both stages (or, from series 8, {{received}} the Golden Buzzer), perform once more before an audience and the judges, with their performance broadcast on live television; until the tenth series, live episodes were broadcast The Fountain Studios in Wembley, the same site used for The X Factor, but following the closure of the studios, the show relocated its live episodes to Elstree Studios. Like the Audition stage of the contest, they must attempt to impress by primarily conducting a new routine of their act within the same span of time; the judges can still use a buzzer in the semi-finals if they are displeased with a performance, and can end it early if all the <b>buzzers</b> are used, and can still give a personal opinion about an act when the performance is over, but neither of these impact how the semi-finalists fare {{at this stage of the}} contest, only the last part of this stage. As only two semi-finalists from each semi-final may proceed on to the Final, which two is determined by two different types of votes given towards the end - a public phone vote, and a judges' vote.|$|E
500|$|I used to {{play about}} with bells and <b>buzzers</b> and things around the house. My mother would {{sometimes}} say [...] "Oh, come and help me find something, it's so dark in this cupboard" [...] – she didn't have very good eyesight… So I'd get a battery and I'd hook a switch, and when she opened that cupboard door a light would come on… I started sort of playing with those things.|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, William Castle {{became known as}} the great {{innovator}} of the B movie publicity gimmick. Audiences of Macabre (1958), an $86,000 production distributed by Allied Artists, were invited to take out insurance policies to cover potential death from fright. The 1959 creature feature The Tingler featured Castle's most famous gimmick, Percepto: at the film's climax, <b>buzzers</b> attached to select theater seats would unexpectedly rattle a few audience members, prompting either appropriate screams or even more appropriate laughter. With such films, Castle [...] "combine the saturation advertising campaign perfected by Columbia and Universal in their Sam Katzman and William Alland packages with centralized and standardized publicity stunts and gimmicks that had previously been the purview of the local exhibitor." ...|$|E
5000|$|An {{answer that}} has started before but ends after the <b>buzzer</b> sounds (<b>buzzer</b> beaters) will count {{as long as it}} is correct.|$|R
2500|$|A Big Red <b>Buzzer</b> (or Temptation <b>Buzzer)</b> was {{released}} [...] {{which includes a}} ring-in sound effect and a three-second timer with a flashing light.|$|R
5000|$|Cowell {{pressed his}} <b>buzzer</b> after his {{comments}} on ThroWings. Cowell later {{stated that he}} did press his <b>buzzer</b> after the performance due to safety reasons.|$|R
