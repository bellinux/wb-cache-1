40|$|International audienceCountercurrent {{chromatography}} (CCC) is a preparative purification technique {{working with}} biphasic liquid systems. One {{phase of the}} liquid system is selected to be the mobile phase, the other phase is the stationary phase, held still by centrifugal fields. Aqueous two-phase systems (ATPS) have demonstrated their use in <b>biological</b> <b>purifications.</b> This article reviews protein separations done by CCC using ATPS. The two types of CCC 'columns' - hydrostatic and hydrodynamic instruments - are presented. All commercially available CCC equipments are listed. The hydrostatic CCC columns have an interesting potential to purify proteins working with ATPS aqueous liquid phases. The ATPS properties are briefly summarized, giving the polyethylene glycol 1000 /dipotassium phosphate/water ternary mass phase diagram, along with the full chemical compositions of the two aqueous phases of important mixtures of this ATPS. Most published protein purifications were performed in academic laboratories. The highest throughput listed is 1. 65 g/h of pure lyzozyme, obtained using a 5. 5 I hydrostatic CCC column...|$|R

In this type of bioreactor gaseous pollutants are transferred through a membrane to the liquid phase, where micro-organisms degrade the pollutants. The membrane bioreactor combines the advantages of membrane devices with the clean technology of <b>biological</b> air <b>purification.</b> Two types of membrane materials {{can be used for}} gas-liquid contact: hydrophobic microporous material and dense material, such as silicone rubber. Microporous material generally has a higher permeability, but dense membranes can be advantageous in the case specific selectivity is required.

In a number of cases the reactor performance appears to be hampered by an unstable biofilm performance and/or by clogging of the liquid channels due to excess biomass formation. So far, membrane bioreactors for waste gas treatment have only been tested on laboratory scale.
