40|$|International audienceThe fatigue <b>of</b> single {{thermoplastic}} <b>fibres</b> {{has been}} well documented to occur in a reproducible manner when they are subjected to certain cyclic loading conditions. The fatigue fracture morphologies <b>of</b> these <b>fibres</b> are very distinctive and differ markedly from other types of failure. This type of behaviour, which is clearly seen with the unambiguous tests on single fibres, must reflect behaviour <b>of</b> <b>fibres</b> in more complex structures which are subjected to cyclic loading. Only limited numbers of reports have, however, shown similar fracture morphologies with fibres extracted from fibre bundles embedded in a matrix material such as rubber. Usually the fractured <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>fibres</b> taken from structures are seen to be shorter than those obtained in single fibre tests and also they show more complex and confused crack growth. The present study reveals that the low thermal conductivity <b>of</b> the <b>fibres,</b> exacerbated when they are embedded in a rubber matrix, leads to very high temperature rises, which is not the case in single fibre tests and under these conditions, crack initiation occurs across the <b>fibre</b> section instead <b>of</b> being restricted to the near surface region. Tests on single fibres at temperatures up to and beyond the glass transition temperature have shown how the fracture morphologies become modified. The fatigue process has been seen to become generalised throughout the fibre and failure occurs due to the coalescence of several cracks, some of which are initiated in the core <b>of</b> the <b>fibre.</b> In all cases, the cracks can be seen to have been initiated by solid inclusions in the fibres...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the work}} was to {{describe}} an alternative method of treatment of prolapsed rectum in the sows. This approach was used to treat rectal prolapse in four affected sows. A 23. 5 cm long Gerlach’s needle was used for sewing a circular suture {{around the base of}} prolapsed rectum. The horizontal U-suture was performed with a synthetic absorbable surgical fibre. Two fibres 25 – 30 cm long were placed into the needle eye, the needle was inserted under finger control into the rectal lumen and the prolapsed tissue was penetrated from the inside to the outside. Both <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> the first <b>fibre</b> were grasped by haemostatic forceps and fixed for the last stitch and the inner <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the second <b>fibre</b> was placed into the needle eye with the third fibre. Rectal tissue was penetrated in the same manner at the distance of 2 – 3 cm from the place of the first penetration. The first U-stitch was made by tying both <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> the second <b>fibre</b> after the needle removal. The inner <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the third <b>fibre</b> was placed into the needle eye with the fourth fibre and the procedure was repeated around the whole prolapse until the first fibre was reached and used for the last stitch. The prolapsed tissue was excised by a blade at the distance of approximately 2 cm from the suture. There was no haemorrhage due to ligation of the tissue. After placing the simple continuous catgut suture around the rectum, a spontaneous retraction of the stump occurred, and the purse-string suture was not required. This method is applicable in practice in sows suffering from large, oedematous and hard prolapse when simple reposition or use of another surgical correction is impossible. In addition, the method may be used also in other large animal species...|$|R

40|$|The {{histological}} features <b>of</b> regenerating muscle <b>fibres</b> in biopsies from {{cases of}} polymyositis have been examined, and {{the activities of}} certain enzymes in these fibres have been assessed histochemically.

Mononucleated myoblasts appeared at the periphery <b>of</b> necrotic <b>fibres</b> before completion <b>of</b> phagocytosis and divided by mitosis. Multinucleated syncitia were found in a similar position and extended along empty sarcolemmal tubes. No evidence of nuclear division was found in these structures, suggesting that they were formed by myoblast fusion. Budding from the remaining <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> necrotic <b>fibres</b> was a less frequent finding. However, changes suggestive of increased ribonucleoprotein formation in the terminal <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> these <b>fibres</b> were commonly found and {{were considered to be}} indicative either of regenerative activity or of lysosomal enzyme synthesis. Degenerative changes such as vacuolation and nuclear pyknosis were found in some regenerating fibres. A second biopsy from the same muscle after clinical recovery in one case showed completely normal muscle architecture indicating that complete regeneration had occurred. Regenerating fibres were found to have a high content of RNA and high LDH, SDH and NADH-dehydrogenase activities. However, only small amounts of neutral fat were present and phosphorylase activity was completely absent in regenerating fibres. The present findings demonstrate the ability of the damaged muscle fibre to regenerate completely in polymyositis and contrast with the ineffective regenerative changes found in the Duchenne form of muscular dystrophy.

40|$|Figure 3 (b) {{provides}} an interesting demonstration {{that there is}} very little side leakage of light from the plastic optical fibre. Relative to the illumination at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>fibre,</b> the dominance <b>of</b> end-reflected light quickly gives way to the dark fibre surface as the observer’s attention is directed away from the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>fibre,</b> thus confirming the effective confinement of the light within the plastic. Eventually, an integrated array of series-connected photo-vol-taic diodes, designed for this application, will provide optimum performance. The light output from the plastic optical fibre will be confined to a small area, and the photo-diode receiving areas should be close-packed in order to avoid wasting light output and hence maximise transmitted power efficiency. This is in contrast with solar cells, where there is little restriction on the illuminated area. The purpose of this preliminary report is to confirm the viabil-ity of this interference-free method of power delivery rather than optimise high power and efficiency. Therefore, a small-scale dem-onstration of successful interference-free powering of a CMOS digital-signal generator has been constructed.
