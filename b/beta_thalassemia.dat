25|$|Family {{history and}} ancestry are factors that {{increase}} the risk of <b>beta</b> <b>thalassemia.</b> Depending on your family history, if your parents or grandparents suffered from <b>beta</b> <b>thalassemia</b> there is a high probability of the mutated gene being inherited by an offspring. Even if a child does not have <b>beta</b> <b>thalassemia</b> major, they can still be a carrier resulting in future offspring having <b>beta</b> <b>thalassemia.</b> Another risk factor is because of certain ancestry. <b>Beta</b> <b>thalassemia</b> occurs most often in people of Italian, Greek, Middle Eastern, Southern Asian, and African ancestry.|$|E
25|$|Thalassemias are genetic {{disorders}} {{inherited from}} a person's parents. There {{are two main}} types, alpha thalassemia and <b>beta</b> <b>thalassemia.</b> The severity of alpha and <b>beta</b> <b>thalassemia</b> depends on {{how many of the}} four genes for alpha globin or two genes for beta globin are missing. Diagnosis is typically by blood tests including a complete blood count, special hemoglobin tests, and genetic tests. Diagnosis may occur before birth through prenatal testing.|$|E
25|$|<b>Beta</b> <b>thalassemia</b> is a {{hereditary}} disease {{allowing for a}} preventative treatment by carrier screening and prenatal diagnosis. It can be prevented if one parent has normal genes, giving rise to screenings that empower carriers to select partners with normal hemoglobin. A study aimed at detecting the genes that could give rise to offspring with sickle cell disease. Patients diagnosed with <b>beta</b> <b>thalassemia</b> have MCH ≤ 26 pg and an RDW < 19. Of 10,148 patients, 1,739 patients had a hemoglobin phenotype and RDW consistent with <b>beta</b> <b>thalassemia.</b> After the narrowing of patients, the HbA2 levels were tested presenting 77 patients with <b>beta</b> <b>thalassemia.</b> This screening procedure proved insensitive in populations of West African ancestry because of the indicators has high prevalence of alpha thalassemia. Countries have programs distributing information about the reproductive risks associated with carriers of haemoglobinopathies. Thalassemia carrier screening programs have educational programs in schools, armed forces, and through mass media {{as well as providing}} counseling to carriers and carrier couples. Screening has showed reduced incidence; by 1995 the prevalence in Italy reduced from 1:250 to 1:4000, and a 95% decrease in that region. The decrease in incidence has benefitted those affected with thalassemia, as the demand for blood has decreased, therefore improving the supply of treatment.|$|E
25|$|<b>Beta</b> <b>thalassemias</b> (β thalassemias) are a {{group of}} {{inherited}} blood disorders.

Increased gastrointestinal iron absorption is seen in all grades of <b>beta</b> <b>thalassemia</b> and increased red blood cell destruction by the spleen due to ineffective erythropoiesis further releases additional iron into the bloodstream.|$|E
25|$|Iron {{overload}} is {{an unavoidable}} consequence of chronic transfusion therapy, necessary {{for patients with}} <b>beta</b> <b>thalassemia.</b> Iron chelation is a medical therapy that avoids the complications of iron overload. The iron overload can be removed by Deferasirox, an oral iron chelator, which has a dose- dependent effect on iron burden. Every unit of transfused blood contains 200–250mg of iron and the body has no natural mechanism to remove excess iron Deferasirox is a vital part in the patients health after blood transfusions. During normal iron homeostasis the circulating iron is bound to transferrin, but with an iron overload, the ability for transferrin to bind iron is exceeded and non-transferrin bound iron is formed. It represents a potentially toxic iron form due to its high propensity to induce oxygen species and is responsible for cellular damage. The prevention of iron overload protects patients from morbidity and mortality. The primary aim is to bind to and remove iron from the body and a rate equal to the rate of transfusional iron input or greater than iron input. During clinical trails patients that received Deferasirox experienced no drug-related neutropenia or agranulocytosis, which was present with other iron chelators. Its long half life requires it to be taken once daily and provides constant chelation. Cardiac failure is a main cause of illness from transfusional iron overload but deferasirox demonstrated the ability to remove iron from iron-loaded myocardial cells protecting <b>beta</b> <b>thalassemia</b> patients from effects of required blood transfusions.|$|E

The {{purpose of this}} dissertation was; (I) to estimate prevalences and gene frequencies in the Hawaii sample, and to look at geographic distributions of the thalassemias within the original countries of these immigrants; and (II) to use {{red blood cell indices}} phenotypes to determine the possibility of developing new algorithms which would distinguish between normals and thalassemias, and between single, double and triple deletion alpha thalassemias with clinically acceptable rates of accuracy. High prevalences of singly and concomitantly inherited thalassemias (compound heterozygotes) were found in the Hawaii sample (Laotians 58. 9 %; Chinese 33. 8 %, Filipinos 40. 5 %). Gene frequencies, corrected for bias, were estimated. Gene frequencies within Laos, the Philippines and China were estimated and mapped according to geographic region of family origin. In order to detect the thalassemias, red cell indices from the complete blood count generated by electronic particle counter were analyzed and yielded the algorithm l/(l+e^-L) where L is the intercept constant - 149. 9 plus (RBCount constant 2. 27 * RBCount measured) + (Hglobin constant - 2. 97 * Hglobin measured) + (Hcrit constant 0. 72 * Hcrit measured) + (MCV constant 1. 40 * MCV measured) + (MCH constant - 5. 10 * MCH measured) + (MCHConc constant 5. 20 * MCHConc measured). This algorithm identified normals and abnormals (thalassemias) with 92. 3 % accuracy. After thalassemia is indicated by the algorithm, the results of hemoglobin A 2 measurement clearly delineate those with <b>beta</b> <b>thalassemias</b> and heterozygous and homozygous Hb E. A second discriminant algorithm was derived which distinguishes single, double and triple deletion alpha thalassemias with 94. 6 % accuracy. Inheritance of more than one form of thalassemia (concomitant inheritance or compound heterozygosity) may confound results. Both algorithms are relatively simple and can be readily applied by calculator; simple programming of microcomputers provides immediate results upon entry of the complete blood count indices. Inclusion of these two algorithms as steps in genetic screening strategies for the thalassemias may enhance effectiveness by more accurately targeting individuals at risk and providing presumptive diagnoses which will be of particular value where DNA analysis is not available...|$|R

40|$|While red {{cells from}} {{individuals}} with <b>beta</b> <b>thalassemias</b> {{are characterized by}} evidence of elevated in vivo oxidation, {{it has not been}} possible to directly examine the relationship between excess alpha-hemoglobin chains and the observed oxidant damage. To investigate the oxidative effects of unpaired alpha-hemoglobin chains, purified alpha-hemoglobin chains were entrapped within normal erythrocytes. These "model" beta-thalassemic cells generated significantly (P < 0. 001) greater amounts of methemoglobin and intracellular hydrogen peroxide than did control cells. This resulted in significant time-dependent decreases in the protein concentrations and reduced thiol content of spectrin and ankyrin. These abnormalities correlated with the rate of alpha-hemoglobin chain autoxidation and appearance of membrane-bound globin. In addition, alpha-hemoglobin chain loading resulted in a direct decrease (38. 5 %) in catalase activity. In the absence of exogenous oxidants, membrane peroxidation and vitamin E levels were unaltered. However, when challenged with an external oxidant, lipid peroxidation and vitamin E oxidation were significantly (P < 0. 001) enhanced in the alpha-hemoglobin chain-loaded cells. Membrane bound heme and iron were also significantly elevated (P < 0. 001) in the alpha-hemoglobin chain-loaded cells and lipid peroxidation could be partially inhibited by entrapment of an iron chelator. In contrast, chemical inhibition of cellular catalase activity enhanced the detrimental effects of entrapped alpha-hemoglobin chains. In summary, entrapment of purified alpha-hemoglobin chains within normal erythrocytes significantly enhanced cellular oxidant stress and resulted in pathological changes characteristic of thalassemic cells in vivo. This model provides a means by which the pathophysiological effects of excess alpha-hemoglobin chains can be examined...|$|R
