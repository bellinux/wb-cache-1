Changes in consumer utility wrought by the GFC were measured by changes in consumption and income. Our empirical analysis using structural equation modeling (SEM) showed that the GFC had affected consumer utility directly and indirectly. The indirect effects were mediated by (a) the emotion or anticipatory feeling evoked by the GFC and (b) the change in saving culture or value of the Chinese. We found that route (a), but not (b), was extremely important in mediating the change in consumer utility. Contrary to conventional wisdom, the indirect effect was found to be stronger than the direct effect, pointing to the importance of the role of anticipatory feeling for assessing consumer utility.

The declining trend in catches as well as collapse of fishery in some localities necessitated assessment of the stock structure to manage this resource sustainably. We ascertained the genetic stock structure of T. unimaculatus along the Indian coast, using molecular markers. RAPD and concatenated dataset of mitochondrial DNA genes (partial sequences of Cytochrome Oxidase I and Cytochrome b) were used to detect population differentiation. RAPD markers showed moderate genetic variability with an overall GST value of 0. 0442, which indicated low genetic differentiation among subpopulations. The mtDNA dataset revealed high haplotype diversity coupled with very low nucleotide diversity that suggested recent population expansion after a period of low effective population size. The median-joining haplotype network showed no geographical clustering of haplotypes. The low levels of genetic differentiation with <b>non-significant</b> <b>P</b> <b>values</b> (FST = 0. 0593) may be due high connectivity among shovel-nosed lobster populations and resultant panmixia.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundThis {{study was}} {{designed}} to study the patient characteristics, presenting features and complications of malaria in patients with elevated liver enzymes and to compare these data to those of patients with normal liver enzymes. MethodsA convenient sample of 100 patients with malaria was selected from three tertiary care referral hospitals. Study subjects were divided into two groups: (1) patients (controls) with normal liver enzymes and (2) patients (cases) with > 3 times the normal liver enzymes {{in the absence of an}} alternate explanation for such elevation. Patient characteristics, presenting features and complications of malaria in these two groups were studied. Data were collected using a semi-structured pretested proforma and were analyzed using the statistical analysis program SPSS, version 11. 5 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL). ResultsThe mean ages were 38. 12 years for the cases and 35. 20 years for the controls with a <b>non-significant</b> <b>p</b> <b>value</b> of 0. 289. Males composed 82 % of the cases that were diagnosed with malarial hepatopathy; the remaining 18 % were females. Falciparum malaria was present in 56 % of the cases, compared to 12 % of the controls. Icterus was present in 66 % of cases of malarial hepatopathy, compared to 32 % of the controls. Of the 66 % of these cases, 18. 18 % had serum bilirubin > 3 mg%, whereas out of the 32 % of the controls presenting with icterus, only 5. 55 % had serum bilirubin > 3 mg% (p= 0. 003). Of the cases with malarial hepatopathy, 38 % suffered from hypoglycemia, compared to 0 % of the controls (p 2 mg%, compared to 2 % of the controls (p= 0. 060). ConclusionPlasmodium falciparum infection (either alone or along with P. vivax) is the leading cause of malarial hepatopathy. Jaundice is a common clinical manifestation among these patients. Patients with malarial hepatopathy have increased incidences of hypoglycemia and thrombocytopenia.

This research studied the age distribution among obese women, the types of overweight and obesity, and the extent of the problem of overweight/obesity and the obesity etiological factors among women in Hillah city in central Iraq. A total of 322 overweight and obese women were included in the study, those women were randomly selected. The Body Mass Index was used as indicator for overweight/ obesity. The incidence of overweight/obesity among age groups were estimated, the etiology factors included genetic, environmental, genetic/environmental and endocrine disease. The overweight and obese women were screened for incidence of infection and/or diseases. The study found that the prevalence of 322 overweight and obese women in Hillah city in central Iraq was 19. 25 % and 80. 78 %, respectively. The obese women types were recorded based on BMI and WHO classification as class- 1 obesity (29. 81 %), class- 2 obesity (24. 22 %) and class- 3 obesity (26. 70 %), the result was discrepancy <b>non-significant,</b> <b>P</b> <b>value</b> < 0. 05. The incidence of overweight in women was high among those aged 20 - 29 years (90. 32 %), 6. 45 % aged 30 - 39 years old and 3. 22 % among ≥ 60 years old, while the incidence of obesity was 20. 38 % for those in the age group 20 - 29 years, 17. 30 % were 30 - 39 years, 23. 84 % were 40 - 49 years, 16. 92 % were 50 - 59 years group and 21. 53 % were ≥ 60 years age group. These results confirm that the age can be considered as a significant factor for obesity types (<b>P</b> <b>value</b> < 0. 0001). The result also showed that the both genetic factors and environmental factors were responsible for incidents of overweight or obesity (84. 78 %) <b>p</b> <b>value</b> < 0. 0001. The results also recorded cases of different repeated infections (skin infection, recurrent UTI and influenza), cancer, gallstones, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, and infertility.

Methods: Twenty-nine autologous greater saphenous vein-patched CEAs performed between 1983 and 1994 were examined with five to nine sequential duplex scans each that included B-mode measurements of both the common carotid bulb (CCB) and internal carotid bulb (ICB) diameters. A total of 186 scans of each of the two segments were performed from 2 to 182 months after CEA (mean, 64 months). The time from the first to the last scan ranged from 30 to 120 months (mean, 76 months). Repeated measures analysis of variance was used as a means of testing the relationship of CCB and ICB diameters with time from CEA and with time from the first scan. Simple linear regression was used as a means of analyzing the variability of individual CCB and ICB diameters and pooled normalized diameters in both time frames. Results: The CCB diameters ranged from 8. 4 to 18. 5 mm (mean, 13. 1 mm), and the ICB diameters ranged from 6. 4 to 16. 0 mm (mean, 11. 2 mm). No significant relationship between both CCB and ICB diameters in the time from CEA or the time from the first scan (P =. 643 to. 913), for sex (P =. 403 to. 917), or for early and late post-CEA time of study onset (P =. 135 to. 773) was shown by means of repeated measures analysis. Low R 2 values (CCB mean, 0. 17; ICB mean, 0. 21) and <b>non-significant</b> <b>P</b> <b>values</b> for regression slope (CCB mean, 0. 46; ICB mean, 0. 54) were given by means of individual regression analysis. There was no correlation between individual regression coefficients and the mean diameters of the arteries. The mean change in CCB diameter was 0. 023 mm/year (range, – 0. 37 to 0. 30 mm/year), and the mean change in ICB diameter was – 0. 030 mm/year (range, – 0. 33 to 0. 37 mm/year). Regression of normalized CCB and ICB diameters versus time gave R 2 values less than 0. 02 and slopes not statistically significantly different from zero. The predicted 10 -year average percent change in normalized diameters ranged from 0. 8 % to 3. 3 %. Conclusion: In a 15 -year period after CEA and a 10 -year sequential B-mode scan study period, {{there was no evidence of}} significant enlargement of saphenous vein-patched CEAs. This is also true for CEAs in men and women and for subsets with larger and smaller CCB and ICB diameters and early and late scan onset times. Dilatation after saphenous vein patching is most likely a rare isolated event and not the result of generalized or frequent progressive enlargement.  (J Vasc Surg 2002; 35 : 131 - 6. ...|$|R

A clinical researcher might report: “in my own experience treatment X does not do well for condition Y”. The use of a <b>P</b> <b>value</b> cut off point of 0.05 was introduced by R.A. Fisher; this resulted in studies being either significant or <b>non-significant.</b> Although this <b>P</b> <b>value</b> objectified research outcome, retaining to such a rigid cut off point can have two potentially serious consequences: (i) possibly clinically important differences observed in studies can be denoted as statistically non-significant and therefore be unfairly ignored {{as a result of}} having a small number of subjects studied (type II errors); (ii) even the smallest difference in measurements can be proved statistically significant by increasing the number of subjects in a study. Such a small difference could be irrelevant (i.e. of no clinical importance) to patients or clinicians. Thus, statistical significance does not necessarily imply clinical importance. Over the years clinicians and researchers have moved away from physical and radiological endpoints towards patient-reported outcomes. However, using patient-reported outcomes does not solve the problem of small differences being statistical significance but possibly clinically irrelevant. In order to study clinical importance, the concept of minimal clinically important difference (MCID) was proposed by Jaesche et al. in 1989. MCID is the smallest change in an outcome that a patient would identify as important. MCID therefore offers a threshold above which outcome is experienced as relevant by the patient; this avoids the problem of mere statistical significance.

In the presence of organic matter, there was a <b>non-significant</b> (<b>p</b> < 0. 55) negative correlation (- 0. 22 at confidence level 95 %) between ambient temperature and survival, a highly significant (p < 0. 0001) negative correlation (- 0. 12 at confidence level 95 %) between relative humidity and survival and a significant (p < 0. 05) positive correlation (+ 0. 48 at confidence level 95 %) between litter pH and survival. The study suggested that increased litter pH and relative humidity rather than temperature presented a great influence on the increased survival of S. typhimurium. New management practice that will reduce litter pH and relative humidity should be considered in the control plans of Salmonellosis in poultry farms...|$|R

40|$|Despite clear {{deficiencies}} of the <b>p</b> <b>value</b> as {{a summary of}} statistical evidence, compelling alternatives with strong theoretical justification, such as the Bayes factor and the related likelihood ratio, are rarely presented in epidemiologic publications. Comparison of the historical performance of the <b>p</b> <b>value</b> with that of its competitors in the epidemiologic literature may help epidemiologists evaluate whether Bayes factors or likelihood ratios lead to conclusions more quickly and reliably than a <b>p</b> <b>value,</b> given the same data. Empirical evidence presented by Ioannidis (Am J Epidemiol 2008; 000 : 000 – 00) demonstrates that findings with <b>p</b> <b>values</b> near 0. 05 tend not to be confirmed in future studies. Similarly, Bayes factors interpret <b>p</b> <b>values</b> near 0. 05 as having, at best, promising evidence against the null hypothesis. However, {{the different types of}} Bayes factors require empirical evaluation of their performance in practice. <b>P</b> <b>values</b> remain popular because miniscule <b>p</b> <b>values</b> are unlikely to mislead and <b>p</b> <b>values</b> do not require alternative hypotheses. Publishing <b>p</b> <b>values</b> near 0. 05 could be considered a low-threshold screen to allow many (possibly null) results to be published for follow-up consideration. Meta-analyses and studies meant to decisively convince skeptics require a stronger standard (<b>p</b> <b>values</b> much below 0. 05) and a Bayes factor to interpret the <b>p</b> <b>value</b> and to facilitate incorporation of background expertise necessary for drawing comprehensive conclusions.

40|$|Currently {{available}} epidemiological evidence {{suggested that}} {{an increase of}} saturated fatty acids (SFA) could have negative effects on cognitive functions, while increased polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) may be protective against cognitive decline. In a Southern Italian elderly population from the Italian Longitudinal Study on Aging (ILSA), a clear reduction of risk of age-related cognitive decline (ARCD) has been found with elevated intake of PUFA and MUFA. Furthermore, in the ILSA, while dietary fatty acids intakes were not associated with incident mild cognitive impairment (MCI), high PUFA intake appeared to have <b>borderline</b> <b>non-significant</b> trend for a protective effect against the development of MCI. These epidemiological findings on predementia syndromes, i. e. MCI or ARCD, together with a recent randomised controlled trial on a possible effect on cognitive and depressive symptoms of omega- 3 PUFA supplementation in patients with very mild AD, suggested a possible role of fatty acids intake in maintaining adequate cognitive functioning and possibly in preventing or delaying the onset of dementia...|$|R

Protective and {{preventive}} role of breast milk was evaluated in this study by assessing the relation of type of feeding and duration of hospital stay or morbidity. Methods. This prospective {{study was conducted in}} a tertiary care hospital and 232 infants in the age group of 14 weeks to 6 months formed the sample. There are two groups of infants, that is, one for breastfed and one for top fed infants. Statistical analysis was done and results were calculated up to 95 % to 99 % level of significance to find effect of feeding pattern on hospital stay due to various diseases and morbidity. Results. Prolonged hospital stay, that is, > 7 days, was lesser in breastfed infants and results were statistically significant in case of gastroenteritis (<b>p</b> <b>value</b> < 0. 001), bronchopneumonia (<b>p</b> <b>value</b> = 0. 0012), bronchiolitis (<b>p</b> <b>value</b> = 0. 005), otitis media (<b>p</b> <b>value</b> = 0. 003), and skin diseases (<b>p</b> <b>value</b> = 0. 047).
