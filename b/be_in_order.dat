5|$|Adults of {{most species}} of mole cricket can fly powerfully, if not with agility, but males do so infrequently. The females {{typically}} take wing soon after sunset, and {{are attracted to}} areas where males are calling, which they do {{for about an hour}} after sunset. This may <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>order</b> to mate, or they may be influenced by the suitability of the habitat for egg-laying, as demonstrated by the number of males present and calling in the vicinity.|$|E
5|$|In February 2005, Keibler began {{appearing}} in backstage segments with then-babyface, Randy Orton, and eventually became his on-screen girlfriend. When Orton challenged The Undertaker to a match at WrestleMania 21, Orton ended the relationship by hitting Stacy with an RKO, incapacitating her. He justified it by claiming he was demonstrating how ruthless he could <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>order</b> to defeat The Undertaker.|$|E

25|$|Socrates begins one of {{the most}} {{influential}} dialogues of Western philosophy regarding the argument for inborn knowledge. By drawing geometric figures in the ground Socrates demonstrates that the slave is initially unaware of the length that a side must <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>order</b> to double the area of a square with two-foot sides. The slave guesses first that the original side must be doubled in length (four feet), and when this proves too much, that it must be three feet. This is still too much, and the slave is at a loss.|$|E
25|$|Each {{test was}} able to {{simultaneously}} illuminate many targets, allowing them to test the amount of x-ray energy needed by placing the targets at different distances from the bomb. Another question was how large the fuel assembly had to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>order</b> for the fuel to self-heat from the fusion reactions and thus reach ignition. Initial data were available by mid-1984, and the testing ceased in 1988. Ignition was achieved {{for the first time}} during these tests, but the amount of energy {{and the size of the}} fuel targets needed to reach ignition was far higher than predicted. During this same period, experiments began on Nova using similar targets to understand their behaviour under laser illumination, allowing direct comparison against the results obtained from the bomb tests.|$|E

25|$|After the {{massacre}} in the church, Ahmet Aga summoned all the surviving villagers outside, {{saying that it}} would <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>order</b> to {{make a list of}} the slain and the widows. The better part of the survivors gathered, since those who did not obey would be killed. They were divided in two groups of women and men; then the Ottoman commander made the women stand back and slew all the remaining 300 men. Those women who protested were also raped and killed. On the same day there were another 300 people murdered on the wooden bridge beside the school, first their arms were cut off, then their ears, noses, shoulders, and only after that they were finished.|$|E
25|$|The Chidleys were {{distinct}} from the moderate Presbyterian Puritans in social class as well as theology. However, they continued to have their children christened at St Chad's, which was contrary to the beliefs and practice of convinced separatists. The last baptism of a Chidley child at St Chad's was of John on 26 October 1629, and the register has a gap where Katherine's name should <b>be.</b> <b>In</b> <b>order</b> to find like-minded people, and possibly for economic reasons also, the Chidleys were forced to move. It seems that their radicalism was deepened by the experience of living in London {{and it is possible}} that it was only in London that they moved decisively to a separatist position.|$|E
25|$|First Jackson {{argued that}} qualia are epiphenomenal: not causally efficacious {{with respect to}} the {{physical}} world. Jackson does not give a positive justification for this claim—rather, he seems to assert it simply because it defends qualia against the classic problem of dualism. Our natural assumption would be that qualia must be causally efficacious in the physical world, but some would ask how we could argue for their existence if they did not affect our brains. If qualia are to be non-physical properties (which they must <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>order</b> to constitute an argument against physicalism), some argue that {{it is almost impossible to}} imagine how they could have a causal effect on the physical world. By redefining qualia as epiphenomenal, Jackson attempts to protect them from the demand of playing a causal role.|$|E

25|$|Interest rate parity and Covered {{interest}} arbitrage: The {{simple concept}} that two similar investments {{in two different}} currencies ought to yield the same return. If the two similar investments are not at face value offering the same interest rate return, the difference should conceptually be made up by changes in the exchange rate {{over the life of}} the investment. IRP basically provides the math to calculate a projected or implied forward rate of exchange. This calculated rate is not and cannot be considered a prediction or forecast, but rather is the arbitrage-free calculation for what the exchange rate is implied to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>order</b> for it to be impossible to make a free profit by converting money to one currency, investing it for a period, then converting back and making more money than if a person had invested in the same opportunity in the original currency.|$|E

500|$|Despite these strengths, the castles {{and town}} walls are now {{recognised}} to {{have also had}} military flaws. The castles were much larger than they needed to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>order</b> to protect against Welsh attack, but the sheer scale of them meant that the Crown {{could not afford to}} maintain or garrison them properly. The fortifications were in some regards simply too big, and as historian Michael Prestwich notes, smaller projects might actually have been more effective. Rather than the sites being scientifically designed, historian Richard Morris suggested that [...] "the impression is firmly given of an elite group of men-of-war, long-standing comrades in arms of the king, indulging in an orgy of military architectural expression on an almost unlimited budget".|$|E
500|$|As the 30th anniversary approached, Gerrold {{had heard}} {{rumors of a}} tribble-sequel in the works but had only heard denials from {{executive}} producer Rick Berman. Following an interview request from The New York Times, he telephoned Berman once more to ask what was happening as {{he did not want}} to say he did not know about the sequel episode and embarrass anyone if it actually was going to happen. Gerrold suggested that an acknowledgement of the creator of the tribbles might <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>order</b> and asked if he could be an extra. He was cast as a security redshirt. While Gerrold was on set, he also advised director Jonathan West on the integration of new scenes into [...] "The Trouble with Tribbles". Gerrold later said that [...] "Trials and Tribble-ations" [...] "turned out beautiful. I think it was the best episode of Deep Space Nine ever and possibly the best episode of Star Trek after the Original Series." [...] Charlie Brill returned as Arne Darvin to film new scenes set in the DS9 timeframe.|$|E
500|$|Rupert {{had already}} become the third {{founding}} member of the scientific Royal Society, being referred to by contemporaries as a [...] "philosophic warrior", and guided the Society as a Councillor during its early years. Very early on in the Society's history, Rupert demonstrated Prince Rupert's Drops to King Charles II and the Society, glass teardrops which explode when the tail is cracked; although credited with their invention at the time, later interpretations suggest that he was instead responsible for the introduction of an existing European discovery into England. He demonstrated a new device for lifting water at the Royal Society, and received attention for his process for [...] "painting colours on marble, which, when polished, became permanent". During this time, Rupert also formulated a mathematical question concerning the paradox that a cube can pass through a slightly smaller cube; Rupert questioned how large a cube had to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>order</b> to fit. The question of Prince Rupert's cube was first solved by the Dutch mathematician Pieter Nieuwland. Rupert was also known for his success in breaking cypher codes.|$|E
