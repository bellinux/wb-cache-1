5|$|Montcalm in {{particular}} would {{have benefited from}} practicing a more irregular form of warfare. He apparently never inspected the landing area {{at the north end}} of Lake George, which was a location from which he could contest the British landing. Furthermore, the French could then have used the confined woodlands to <b>blunt</b> <b>the</b> numerical advantage of the British, and contested the entire portage road. The fact that fortifications were built along the portage road but then abandoned by the French is one indication of this failure of strategic thinking. Nester estimates that contesting the first crossing on the portage road would have gained Montcalm an additional day for defensive preparations.|$|E

5|$|The {{first day}} of the attack was a success, but on the second day, the Germans were {{reinforced}} with heavier weapons and were able to <b>blunt</b> <b>the</b> attack, inflicting high casualties. The force was successful despite heavy casualties, and German forces were forced to retreat. On 1 August, the corps arrived in the Vesle area near the Marne River, where it assumed command of the 3rd Division, 28th Division, and 32nd Division from the French XXXVIII Corps, placing side-by side with the U.S. I Corps for a few days. Troops continued to advance until September when they withdrew to form the new First United States Army.|$|E

5|$|Although heavily outnumbered, the 27th Brigade {{held their}} {{positions}} into the afternoon before the Australians were finally withdrawn to {{positions in the}} rear of the brigade, with both sides having suffered heavy casualties. The Chinese then turned their attention to the Canadians on Hill 677, but during a fierce night battle they were unable to dislodge them. The fighting helped <b>blunt</b> <b>the</b> Chinese offensive and the actions of the Australians and Canadians at Kapyong were important in assisting to prevent a breakthrough on the United Nations Command central front, and ultimately the capture of Seoul. The two battalions bore the brunt of the assault and stopped an entire Chinese division during the hard fought defensive battle. The next day the Chinese withdrew back up the valley, in order to regroup. Today, the battle is regarded as one of the most famous actions fought by the Australian and Canadian armies in Korea.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, the Japanese {{called a}} halt to their attack on the Australian right, and subsequently troops from the 2/28th Infantry Battalion were then sent to the east to secure the position's flanks. On 29 November, the 2/32nd was relieved by the 2/43rd. In doing so, it {{was struck by a}} heavy Japanese artillery bombardment which killed or wounded25. Over the 10days that the 2/32nd had held Pabu, Mollard's force had endured repeated mortar and artillery fire, and repeated attacks, but with the assistance of strong artillery support, it had held its ground and in doing so had helped <b>blunt</b> <b>the</b> force of the Japanese counterattack at a time when Australian forces were making heavy progress towards the Japanese fortress at Sattelberg. Later, the Japanese commanding general, Adachi, pinpointed the Australian capture of Pabu as {{one of the main reasons}} for the defeat of his force during the Huon Peninsula campaign.

5|$|This period also {{marked a}} phase of {{considerable}} travel to the Middle East by European civilians and minor nobility, and in the process, some travelers noticed that the Arabian horse as a pure breed of horse was under threat due to modern forms of warfare, inbreeding and other problems that were reducing the horse population of the Bedouin tribes at a rapid rate.

The Supreme United Nations military commander in the area, General Douglas MacArthur, decided to have his American and South Korean troops to dig in around Pusan and hold on until he could assemble a powerful force (the American 10th Corps) to make an amphibious counterattack at Inchon on the northwestern coast of South Korea, near Seoul, later on in 1950. The 24th Infantry Division, along with its South Korean allies, was hence nearly alone for several weeks while the Americans and South Koreans held out inside the Pusan Perimeter and awaited reinforcements and counterattacks against the North Koreans.|$|E

Under the cover of inclement weather, an assault was launched by the 92nd Regiment at 4pm on November 11. The Chinese soon drove off the defending 1st Battalion of the ROK 32nd Regiment, but Chung Il-kwon immediately replied with a counterattack by the ROK 17th Regiment of the ROK 2nd Infantry Division on the dawn of November 12. After two hours of fighting, the 1st Battalion of the ROK 17th Regiment recaptured two-thirds of Sniper Ridge and inflicted heavy casualties on the PVA 92nd Regiment. The 31st Division relieved the 92nd Regiment with its 93rd Regiment to launch another assault on November 14, but the ROK 17th Regiment responded by committing all units to <b>blunt</b> <b>the</b> attack. By November 17, {{with the help of}} the ROK 1st Field Artillery Group, the ROK 2nd Battalion returned to the 1st Battalion's original position after a two-hour battle.

They were all placed {{at the bottom of a}} hill, with the intention of luring the Ottoman cavalry-based army into a downhill charge. The Albanian left wing was commanded by Tanush Thopia with 1,500 horsemen and an equal number of infantrymen. On the right wing, Skanderbeg placed Moisi Golemi in the same manner as Thopia. In front of the wings, foot archers were placed to lure the Ottomans in. In the center, there were 3,000 men under the command of Skanderbeg and Ajdin Muzaka. One-thousand horsemen were placed in front of the main division with orders to <b>blunt</b> <b>the</b> initial Turkish cavalry charge. An equal number of archers, trained to accompany the horses, was placed next to these horsemen. The main body of infantry, commanded by Ajdin Muzaka, was placed behind the archers.|$|E
5|$|On 8 February 1916, Weathers enlisted as {{a private}} in the Australian Imperial Force (AIF), and was {{initially}} allotted as a reinforcement to the 10th Battalion. However, in June he was re-allotted to the 43rd Battalion, part of the 11th Brigade, 3rd Division, with the regimental number 1153. The 43rd Battalion embarked on HMAT Afric in June 1916, and after a brief stop in the Middle East and transit through France, {{spent the rest of}} the year training in the United Kingdom. The 3rd Division embarked for the Western Front in November, and entered the trenches for the first time in late December. Weathers reported sick in late January 1917, and did not rejoin his unit until late April. He returned to the front lines in time to participate in the first major action his battalion saw during the war, the Battle of Messines, during which the 43rd Battalion incurred 122 casualties. One of those casualties was Weathers, who suffering a gunshot wound to the leg on 10 June. Evacuated to hospital in the United Kingdom, he did not return to his unit until early December. He was promoted to lance corporal on 21 March 1918, and a week later his battalion helped <b>blunt</b> <b>the</b> German Spring Offensive, taking up defensive positions between the Ancre and the Somme west of Morlancourt. In late May he required medical treatment following a gas attack near Villers-Bretonneux which caused 230 casualties among the 43rd, and Weathers did not return to duty until mid-June.|$|E

To investigate whether high-dietary sodium-induced effects on vascular conversion of Ang I might be involved in <b>the</b> sodium-induced <b>blunting</b> of <b>the</b> response to ACEi, the authors studied the vasoconstrictor responses to Ang I and Ang II of isolated aortic rings from healthy rats on low dietary sodium (LS: 0. 05 % NaCl) and high dietary sodium (HS: 2. 0 % NaCl) after 3 weeks of ACEi (lisinopril 75 mg/L) or vehicle (CON). Blood pressure was similar in LS and HS in CON, but HS <b>blunted</b> <b>the</b> blood pressure response to ACEi. Functional conversion of Ang I was assessed as the difference in dose-response curves to Ang I and Ang II in parallel aortic rings. Sodium intake did not affect the dose-response curves to Ang I and Ang II in CON. In the ACEi groups, a significant difference was present between the curves for Ang I and Ang II on LS (deltaEC 50, 6. 7 nM; range, 2. 2 - 13 nM; P < 0. 01) but not on HS (deltaEC 50 : 1. 3 nM; range, 0. 0 - 4. 1 nM, median [interquartile range], NS).
