5|$|In the infinite-dimensional case, an {{orthonormal}} <b>basis</b> {{will not}} be a <b>basis</b> in the sense of linear algebra; to distinguish the two, the latter <b>basis</b> is also called a Hamel <b>basis.</b> That the span of the <b>basis</b> vectors is dense implies that every vector in the space can be written as the sum of an infinite series, and the orthogonality implies that this decomposition is unique.|$|E
5|$|At {{present in}} the United States there are three {{different}} levels of scrutiny. Firstly, if a law categorizes on the <b>basis</b> of race or national origin (which are regarded as suspect classifications), or infringes a fundamental right, strict scrutiny is applied. Accordingly, the law is unconstitutional unless it is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest. In addition, {{there should not be}} a less restrictive alternative available to achieve that compelling interest. Secondly, if the law categorizes on the <b>basis</b> of gender, legitimacy or similar quasi-suspect classifications, intermediate scrutiny is applied – the law is unconstitutional unless it is substantially related to an important government interest. Finally, the traditional rational <b>basis</b> review is applied if the law categorizes on some other, non-suspect, <b>basis.</b> In this case, the law is constitutional so long as it is reasonably related to a legitimate government interest.|$|E

5|$|In this stage, it is {{necessary}} to inquire into, firstly, the object of the statute, and secondly, whether the <b>basis</b> of differentiation against or for a particular class is a reasonable means of achieving such an object. The essence of the test is whether it is reasonable, taking into consideration the object of the statute, to distinguish between persons on the selected <b>basis</b> of differentiation. As such, it {{is necessary}} to ask how the differentiation against or for one particular class furthers the object of the statute. The law is not arbitrary if the <b>basis</b> for discrimination has a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved, and the statute will be declared valid and constitutional.|$|E

25|$|To be a <b>basis</b> is {{to yield}} all other {{operations}} by composition, whence any two bases must be intertranslatable.

25|$|By Veblen's theorem, every Eulerian {{subgraph}} {{of a given}} graph can be decomposed into simple cycles, subgraphs {{in which}} all vertices have degree zero or two and in which the degree-two vertices form a connected set. Therefore, it is always possible to find a <b>basis</b> in which the <b>basis</b> elements are themselves all simple cycles. Such a <b>basis</b> is called a cycle <b>basis</b> of the given graph. More strongly, it is always possible to find a <b>basis</b> in which the <b>basis</b> elements are induced cycles or even (in a 3-vertex-connected graph) induced cycles whose removal does not separate the remaining graph.|$|E
25|$|In other words, {{the space}} of {{orthonormal}} bases is like the orthogonal group, but without a choice of base point: given an orthogonal space, there is no natural choice of orthonormal <b>basis,</b> but once one is given one, there is a one-to-one correspondence between bases and the orthogonal group. Concretely, a linear map is determined by where it sends a basis: just as an invertible map can take any <b>basis</b> to any other <b>basis,</b> an orthogonal map can take any orthogonal <b>basis</b> to any other orthogonal <b>basis.</b>|$|E
25|$|The ring <b>basis</b> {{emerged in}} the 20th century {{with the work of}} Zhegalkin and Stone and became the <b>basis</b> of choice for algebraists coming to the subject from a {{background}} in abstract algebra.

25|$|As Bob {{does not}} know the <b>basis</b> the photons were encoded in, all {{he can do is}} to select a <b>basis</b> at random to measure in, either {{rectilinear}} or diagonal.

After Bob has measured all the photons, he communicates with Alice over the public classical channel. Alice broadcasts the <b>basis</b> each photon was sent in, and Bob the <b>basis</b> each was measured in. They both discard photon measurements (bits) where Bob used a different <b>basis,</b> which is half on average, leaving half the bits as a shared key.|$|E

25|$|The {{determinant}} can {{be thought}} of as assigning a number to every sequence of n vectors in Rn, by using the square matrix whose columns are the given vectors. For instance, an orthogonal matrix with entries in Rn represents an orthonormal <b>basis</b> in Euclidean space. The determinant of such a matrix determines whether the orientation of the <b>basis</b> is consistent with or opposite to the orientation of the standard <b>basis.</b> If the determinant is +1, the <b>basis</b> has the same orientation. If it is −1, the <b>basis</b> has the opposite orientation.|$|E

25|$|A theorem {{attributed}} to Mazur asserts that every infinite-dimensional Banach space V contains a basic sequence, i.e., {{there is an}} infinite-dimensional subspace of V that has a Schauder <b>basis.</b> The <b>basis</b> problem is the question asked by Banach, whether every separable Banach space has a Schauder <b>basis.</b> This was negatively answered by Per Enflo who constructed a separable Banach space failing the approximation property, thus a space without a Schauder <b>basis.</b>|$|E
25|$|A vector may be {{described}} as a list of numbers in terms of a <b>basis,</b> but as a geometrical object a vector retains its own identity regardless of how one chooses to describe it in a <b>basis.</b> This persistence of identity is reflected in the fact that when a vector is written in one <b>basis,</b> and then the <b>basis</b> is changed, the components of the vector transform according to a change of <b>basis</b> formula. Such a transformation law is known as a covariant transformation. The covariant derivative is required to transform, under a change in coordinates, {{in the same way as}} a <b>basis</b> does: the covariant derivative must change by a covariant transformation (hence the name).|$|E
