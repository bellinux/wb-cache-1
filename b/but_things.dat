5|$|In this episode, Dwight stages {{a fire in}} {{the office}} to test the office's fire safety skills, <b>but</b> <b>things</b> go from bad to worse when Stanley suffers a heart attack, causing Michael to come up with ways to relieve stress in the office, {{including}} a comedic roast of himself. Meanwhile, Andy, Jim, and Pam watch an illegally downloaded movie at work starring Jack Black, Jessica Alba and Cloris Leachman, and Pam deals with her parents' recent argument that's caused her father to move in with her and Jim.|$|E
5|$|Moore {{was left}} with a weak side of young and inexperienced players which would stumble to a franchise-worst record of only 3 wins against 10 losses during the 2008 Super 14 season, and {{finished}} as the lowest-placed New Zealand team on the table. Jimmy Cowan, one of the team's few bright spots through this period, was appointed team captain for 2009, <b>but</b> <b>things</b> would improve little over the following two seasons as the team again limped to the worst record of the New Zealand clubs. When Moore was released as coach following the 2010 season, the franchise had compiled a record of only 10 wins against 29 losses in three seasons under his leadership.|$|E
5|$|The group's {{previous}} album, The Least We Can Do Is Wave to Each Other (February 1970) {{had achieved}} {{a small amount}} of commercial success and critical acclaim in the UK and Europe. The next project the group attempted was recording the soundtrack to the 1970 film Eyewitness, but it was rejected, largely for being too sinister. They started to develop a live following during 1970, counting film director Anthony Minghella as one of their fans, <b>but</b> <b>things</b> backfired after a show at the Royal Festival Hall in June that drew negative reviews from Melody Makers Chris Welch. Around this time, the band decided to write some new material for a follow-up album.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time, Jack Donaghy's (Alec Baldwin) {{aspirations}} of becoming CEO of General Electric (GE) {{comes to a}} halt when his girlfriend and CNBC host, Avery Jessup (Elizabeth Banks) informs him that the Philadelphia-based cable company Kabletown is rumored to be buying NBC. Jack—who serves as Vice President of East Coast Television and Microwave Oven Programming for GE—insists that no sale is pending, as he believes that his mentor and GE CEO Don Geiss (Rip Torn) would not agree to such a deal. As rumors persist, Jack panics, <b>but</b> <b>things</b> get worse when he learns from former GE chairman Jack Welch (as himself) that Don Geiss has been dead for weeks and that the company negotiated a takeover with Kabletown. Welch kept Geiss's death a secret while negotiations took place. Liz comforts Jack when he admits his dream of running GE is crushed. The next day, on Avery Jessup's program, The Hot Box, Jessup confirms that the buyout has gone forward, praising Jack Donaghy as a wise choice to lead Kabletown's new acquisition. Jack, who is watching the program, is cheered by this.|$|E
5|$|In a {{flashback}} to 1990, Bart {{goes to his}} first day of school, <b>but</b> <b>things</b> do not go so well for him and he becomes depressed. It is during discussions of Bart's future that the school psychologist realizes the young Lisa is very intelligent, telling Homer and Marge {{that they need to}} nurture her gifted spirit. They try to send Lisa to a private school but the tuition fee costs $6,000. Meanwhile, a terrible heatwave hits Springfield and Homer saves $200 to buy an air conditioner. Marge, however, asks Homer not to buy one until they figure out how to help Lisa. At the school, Bart talks with Milhouse and makes a farting sound, which Milhouse finds amusing. Encouraged, Bart entertains a group of children and sets out on his path to become the school prankster.|$|E
5|$|Originally Mary {{believed}} that many nobles supported her marriage, <b>but</b> <b>things</b> soon turned sour between the newly elevated Bothwell (created Duke of Orkney) {{and his former}} peers, and the marriage proved to be deeply unpopular. Catholics considered the marriage unlawful, since they did not recognise Bothwell's divorce or {{the validity of the}} Protestant service. Both Protestants and Catholics were shocked that Mary should marry the man accused of murdering her husband. The marriage was tempestuous, and Mary became despondent. Twenty-six Scottish peers, known as the confederate lords, turned against Mary and Bothwell, raising an army against them. Mary and Bothwell confronted the lords at Carberry Hill on 15 June, but there was no battle as Mary's forces dwindled away through desertion during negotiations. Bothwell was given safe passage from the field, and the lords took Mary to Edinburgh, where crowds of spectators denounced her as an adulteress and murderer. The following night, she was imprisoned in Loch Leven Castle, on an island in the middle of Loch Leven. Between 20 and 23 July, Mary miscarried twins. On 24 July, she was forced to abdicate in favour of her one-year-old son James. Moray was made regent, while Bothwell was driven into exile. He was imprisoned in Denmark, became insane and died in 1578.|$|E

5|$|The {{process was}} not without obstacles, however. The Neapolitan nobles distrusted Skanderbeg since the Kastrioti family had {{previously}} been allied with Venice. Alfonso himself had been offended when he asked Skanderbeg to attack Venice along with Đurađ Branković and the Albanian refused. Alfonso was also a devout Christian and found it uneasy to ally with Skanderbeg who had previously practiced Islam in the Ottoman court. On the other hand, Skanderbeg had been disillusioned when Alfonso failed to send any troops to Krujë when they were most needed. <b>But</b> <b>things</b> changed once Skanderbeg had thwarted the Ottoman Army. Both Venice and Alfonso grew an interest in expanding their powers in the Adriatic and the Ionian. On 26 March 1451, the Treaty of Gaeta was signed, creating an Albanian-Aragonese alliance.|$|E
5|$|Born {{into the}} Bundjalung people at Yulgilbar on the Clarence River in {{northern}} New South Wales, Marsh first {{made an impression}} as a professional runner, travelling to Sydney and then competing interstate, winning races as a sprinter and a hurdler. While in Sydney, Marsh began competing in the local club cricket competition and his action quickly came under scrutiny. He was first no-balled for throwing in 1897, {{but it was not}} until 1900 that he came to prominence in a trial match against the New South Wales state team. Marsh dismissed leading Test cricketers Victor Trumper and Monty Noble, but was called for throwing. Marsh vowed to prove the legitimacy of his action by bowling with his arm encased in splints, which prompted the umpire to resign in humiliation. Having topped the bowling averages in the local competition, Marsh was selected to make his debut in the Sheffield Shield. He made an immediate impression and led the first-class bowling averages for the season after three matches. He was no-balled in his second match by Bob Crockett, <b>but</b> <b>things</b> came to a head in his fourth match when the same umpire no-balled him seventeen times, leading to angry crowd demonstrations. The cricket community was divided on whether Marsh's action was fair and various theories were propounded, which sought to show a motive for foul play against Marsh. The most popular of these theories was that Marsh was scapegoated in a campaign against throwing and was a soft target because of his race.|$|E

25|$|Yet 2005 {{saw little}} improvement, and doubts {{circulated}} about his defensive technique, {{causing him to}} be shuffled {{in and out of}} the side. <b>But</b> <b>things</b> started looking up again during the winter Test series against England, in which he scored a century and two fifties, with a more cautious attitude to his innings building than he had previously shown.|$|E
