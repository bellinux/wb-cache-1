Although Leopold {{did not reveal}} {{the full extent of}} the tour's earnings, or its expenses, the material benefits from the tour had evidently been considerablebut so had the costs. The librarian of St Peter's Abbey, Salzburg, thought that the gifts ("gewgaws") alone which they brought back were worth about 12,000 florins, but estimated the total costs of the enterprise at 20,000 florins. The expenses were certainly high; in a letter to Hagenauer sent in September 1763, after ten weeks on the road, Leopold reported expenses to date as 1,068 florins, an amount covered by their concert earnings without, however, any significant surplus. Leopold stated that [...] "there was nothing to be saved, <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> travel in noble or courtly style for the preservation of our health and the reputation of my court". He later recorded that on arrival in Paris in November 1763 that they had [...] "very little money".|$|E

6000|$|Dollis Hill, May 13, ’88.—Your {{last letter}} {{was one of}} extreme [...] interest. It raised such a {{multitude}} of points, after your perusal [...] of my article on R. Elsmere, as to stimulate in the highest degree [...] my curiosity to know how far you would carry into propositions, [...] the ideas which you {{for the most part}} obliquely put forward. I [...] gave the letter to Mary, who paid us a flying visit in London, [...] that she might take it to Hawarden for full digestion. For myself [...] I feed upon the hope that when (when ?) you come back to England [...] we may go over the points, and I may reap further benefits from [...] your knowledge. I will not now attempt anything of the kind. But I [...] will say this generally, that I am not so much oppressed as you [...] appear to be, with the notion that great difficulties have been [...] imported by the researches of scientists into the religious and [...] theological argument. As respects cosmogony and geogony, the [...] Scripture has, I think, taken much benefit from them. Whatever be [...] the date of the early books, Pentateuch or Hexateuch in their [...] present edition, the Assyriological investigations seem to me to [...] have fortified and accredited their substance by producing similar [...] traditions in variant forms inferior to the Mosaic forms, and [...] tending to throw them back to a higher antiquity, a fountainhead [...] nearer the source. Then there is the great chapter of the [...] Dispersal: which Renan (I think) treats as exhibiting the [...] marvellous genius (!) of the Jews. As to unbroken sequences in the [...] physical order, they do not trouble me, <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do not [...] with the natural but the moral order, and over this science, or as [...] I call it natural science, does not wave her sceptre. It is no [...] small matter, again (if so it be, as I suppose), that, after [...] warring for a century against miracle as unsustained by [...] experience, the assailants should now have to abandon that ground, [...] stand only upon sequence, and controvert the great facts of the [...] New Testament only by raising to an extravagant and unnatural [...] height the demands made under the law of testimony in order to [...] [justify] a rational belief. One admission has to be made, that [...] death did not come into the world by sin, namely the sin of Adam, [...] and this sits inconveniently by the declaration of Saint Paul.|$|E
