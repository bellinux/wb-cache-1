5|$|Camouflage {{is common}} and {{widespread}} among beetle families, {{especially those that}} feed on wood or vegetation, such as leaf beetles (Chrysomelidae, which are often green) and weevils. In some species, sculpturing or various coloured scales or hairs cause beetles such as the avocado weevil Heilipus apiatus to resemble bird dung or other inedible objects. Many beetles that live in sandy environments <b>blend</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> coloration of that substrate.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage uses any {{combination}} of materials, coloration, or illumination for concealment to make the organism hard to detect by sight. It is common in both terrestrial and marine animals. Camouflage can be achieved in many different ways, such as through resemblance to surroundings, disruptive coloration, shadow elimination, self-decoration, cryptic behavior, or changeable skin patterns and color. Animals such as the flat-tail horned lizard of North America have evolved to eliminate their shadow and <b>blend</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> ground. The bodies of these lizards are flattened, and their sides thin towards the edge. This body form, along with the white scales fringed along their sides, allows the lizards to effectively hide their shadows. Additionally, these lizards hide any remaining shadows by pressing their bodies to the ground.|$|E
5|$|New {{memorial}} buildings {{could also}} adopt a medieval style. The Scottish National War Memorial, for example, a Scots baronial styled memorial hall complete with stained glass in Edinburgh Castle, attempts to <b>blend</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> surrounding medieval fortress. In Germany, the totenburgen usually {{looked to the}} past for their style; Tannenberg, for example, was heavily medieval in appearance, resembling a castle, albeit combined with a huge cross and mass graves. The dolmen boulders used around the outside of many German memorials reinforced the archaic feel of the monuments. In other cases Germans chose to preserve or rebuild real medieval buildings and architecture to form war memorials, such as parts of Dorsten and Dülken.|$|E
50|$|A new beacon was {{unveiled}} in 2008 by Lord Downe, President of the Danby Beacon Trust.The flame-shaped basket {{is made out}} of blued stainless steel, <b>blending</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> sky. The flames are mounted around a cup that is decorated with bronze - a reminder of the Bronze Age burial mound which part occupies the site.|$|R
50|$|Blended wing body {{aircraft}} have {{a flattened}} and airfoil shaped body, which produces {{most of the}} lift to keep itself aloft, and distinct and separate wing structures, though the wings are smoothly <b>blended</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> body.|$|R
25|$|In {{the modern}} period, several Somali {{cities such as}} Mogadishu, Hargeisa and Garowe {{received}} large projects, which saw construction in new styles that harmoniously <b>blended</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> existing old architecture. Due to Italian influence, parts of Mogadishu are built in the classical style. The Somali government continued upon that legacy, while also {{opening the door to}} German, American and Chinese designers.|$|R
5|$|Some females {{stay and}} defend the nest until the chicks start hatching, but most leave the nesting area {{completely}} to nest again; in a good season, a female emu may nest three times. If the parents stay together during the incubation period, they will take turns standing guard over the eggs while the other drinks and feeds within earshot. If it perceives a threat during this period, it will lie {{down on top of}} the nest and try to <b>blend</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> similar-looking surrounds, and suddenly stand up to confront and scare the other party if it comes close.|$|E
5|$|The Soviets {{employed}} maskirovka (military deception) to mask defensive {{positions and}} troop dispositions and {{to conceal the}} movement of men and materiel. These included camouflaging gun emplacements, constructing dummy airfields and depots, generating false radio-traffic, and spreading rumours among the Soviet frontline troops and the civilian population in the German-held areas. Movement of forces and supplies {{to and from the}} salient took place at night only. Ammunition caches were carefully concealed to <b>blend</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> landscape. Radio transmission was restricted and fires were forbidden. Command posts were hidden and motor transport in and around them forbidden.|$|E
5|$|The species Timema cristinae {{exhibits}} both striped and unstriped populations {{depending on}} the host plant, a form of polymorphism that clearly illustrates the camouflage function of the stripe. The earliest ancestors of this species were generalists that fed on plants belonging to both the genera Adenostoma and Ceanothus. They eventually diverged into two distinct ecotypes with a more specialist host plant preference. One ecotype prefers to feed on Adenostoma while the other ecotype prefers to feed on Ceanothus. The Adenostoma ecotype possesses a white dorsal stripe, an adaptation to <b>blend</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> needle-like leaves of the plant, while the Ceanothus ecotype does not (Ceanothus spp. have broad leaves). The Adenostoma ecotype is also smaller, with a wider head, and shorter legs.|$|E
50|$|Elnora is just {{beginning}} high school, where her unfashionable dresses add to her difficulty <b>in</b> <b>blending</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> other students. She is determined to earn an education, which her mother derides as useless; Mrs. Comstock wants Elnora to remain at home and work as a drudge on their farm. Lack of money for tuition and books nearly derail her continued enrollment.|$|R
5|$|Aggressive {{resemblance}} {{is used by}} predators or parasites. In special aggressive resemblance, {{the animal}} looks like something else, luring the prey or host to approach, for example when a flower mantis resembles {{a particular kind of}} flower, such as an orchid. In general aggressive resemblance, the predator or parasite <b>blends</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> background, for example when a leopard is hard to see in long grass.|$|R
25|$|The {{indigenous}} {{peoples of the}} Dominican Republic have also had a significant influence on {{the architecture of the}} country. The Taíno people relied heavily on the mahogany and guano (dried palm tree leaf) to put together crafts, artwork, furniture, and houses. Utilizing mud, thatched roofs, and mahogany trees, they gave buildings and the furniture inside a natural look, seamlessly <b>blending</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> island’s surroundings.|$|R
5|$|Gray was {{not chosen}} for camouflage, however, it did, at times, provide {{enough of a}} mask along tree lines during battle; keeping the line of Infantry hidden long enough to strike effectively. At {{the time of the}} American Civil War, the {{usefulness}} of camouflage was not generally recognized. Gray was chosen for Confederate uniforms because gray dye could be made relatively cheaply and it was the standard uniform color of the various State Militias. The gray uniforms worn by early State volunteers was normally a shade of cadet gray, which is not suitable for combat wear, as it gives away the position of the individual easily from its bright blue-gray tones, and for this reason it was preserved by some men for dress-parade functions. The gray mentioned is dull toned, often varying in color depending on the region and time during the conflict, resulting in a uniform that could <b>blend</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> tree lines, or hide the men in the field wearing them.|$|E
5|$|Kingdom Hearts is {{influenced}} by its parent franchise, Final Fantasy, and carries gameplay elements over into its own action-based, hack and slash system. The main battle party consists of three characters: Sora, Donald Duck, and Goofy. Sora is directly controlled by the player from a third person camera angle. All other party members are computer-controlled, though the player can customize their behavior to an extent through the pause menu. Donald and Goofy comprise the party in most areas, but nearly every level features a character who may replace them. For instance, Jack Skellington can join Sora's party in Halloween Town, but cannot accompany the player elsewhere. In some worlds, the party changes its appearance, has abilities unique to that world or both, can fly in Neverland, acquire aquatic forms in Atlantica which enable them to survive underwater, and gain Halloween costumes in Halloween Town to <b>blend</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> locals.|$|E
5|$|Mantises are preyed on by {{vertebrates}} such as frogs, lizards, and birds, and by invertebrates such as spiders and ants. Generally, mantises {{protect themselves}} by camouflage, most species being cryptically colored to resemble foliage or other backgrounds, both to avoid predators and to better snare their prey. Those that live on uniformly colored surfaces such as bare earth or tree bark are dorsoventrally flattened {{so as to}} eliminate shadows that might reveal their presence. The species from different families called flower mantises are aggressive mimics: they resemble flowers convincingly enough to attract prey that come to collect pollen and nectar. Some species in Africa and Australia are able to turn black after a molt {{towards the end of}} the dry season; at this time of year, bush fires occur and this coloration enables them to <b>blend</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> fire-ravaged landscape (fire melanism).|$|E
25|$|The main castle of the Knights of St. John {{was also}} rebuilt. The concrete-dominated {{architectural}} style <b>blended</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> islands' picturesque scenery (and also reminded {{the inhabitants of}} Italian rule), but has consequently been largely demolished or remodeled, apart from the famous example of the Leros town of Lakki (founded by the Italians as Portolago), which remains {{a prime example of}} Italian Rationalism.|$|R

50|$|German cars {{like the}} Blitzen Benz were white, {{as were the}} three Mercedes that won the 1914 French Grand Prix 1-2-3. On the other hand, Mercedes won the Italian Targa Florio with cars painted red in 1922 (Giulio Masetti) and 1924 (Christian Werner), <b>blending</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> local competitors. The big {{supercharged}} 200 hp Mercedes-Benz SSKL with which Rudolf Caracciola won the 1931 Mille Miglia was called the White Elephant.|$|R
5|$|The {{result was}} a non-hierarchical, organic {{collection}} of low-lying buildings intended to allow views of, and <b>blend</b> <b>in</b> <b>with,</b> <b>the</b> surrounding rugged scenery and symbolise the connection between nature and the Scottish people. As a consequence the building has many features connected to nature and land, such as the leaf shaped motifs of the roof in the Garden Lobby of the building, and the large windows of the debating chamber, committee rooms and the Tower Buildings which face the broad expanse of Holyrood Park, Arthur's Seat and Salisbury Crags. Inside the buildings, the connection to the land {{is reinforced by the}} use of Scottish rock such as gneiss and granite in the flooring and walls, and the use of oak and sycamore {{in the construction of the}} furniture.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage is an {{important}} defense strategy, which {{involves the use of}} coloration or shape to blend into the surrounding environment. This sort of protective coloration is common and widespread among beetle families, especially those that feed on wood or vegetation, such as many of the leaf beetles (family Chrysomelidae) or weevils. In some of these species, sculpturing or various colored scales or hairs cause the beetle to resemble bird dung or other inedible objects. Many of those that live in sandy environments <b>blend</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> coloration of the substrate. Most phasmids are known for effectively replicating the forms of sticks and leaves, and the bodies of some species (such as O. macklotti and Palophus centaurus) are covered in mossy or lichenous outgrowths that supplement their disguise. Some species have the ability to change color as their surroundings shift (B. scabrinota, T. californica). In a further behavioral adaptation to supplement crypsis, a number of species have been noted to perform a rocking motion where the body is swayed from side to side that is thought to reflect the movement of leaves or twigs swaying in the breeze. Another method by which stick insects avoid predation and resemble twigs is by feigning death (catalepsy), where the insect enters a motionless state that can be maintained for a long period. The nocturnal feeding habits of adults also aids Phasmatodea in remaining concealed from predators.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{scarcity}} of props in Peking opera, costumes take on added importance. Costumes function first to distinguish the rank of the character being played. Emperors and their families wear yellow robes, and high-ranking officials wear purple. The robe worn by these two classes is called a mang, or python robe. It is a costume suitable for the high rank of the character, featuring brilliant colors and rich embroidery, often {{in the design of}} a dragon. Persons of high rank or virtue wear red, lower-ranking officials wear blue, young characters wear white, the old wear white, brown, or olive, and all other men wear black. On formal occasions, lower officials may wear the kuan yi, a simple gown with patches of embroidery on both the front and back. All other characters, and officials on informal occasions, wear the chezi, a basic gown with varying levels of embroidery and no jade girdle to denote rank. All three types of gowns have water sleeves, long flowing sleeves that can be flicked and waved like water, attached to facilitate emotive gestures. Tertiary characters of no rank wear simple clothing without embroidery. Hats are intended to <b>blend</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> rest of the costume and will usually have a matching level of embroidery. Shoes may be high or low soled, the former being worn by characters of high rank, and the latter by characters of low rank or acrobatic characters.|$|E

25|$|Standing {{just over}} eight-foot high, this stylish {{contemporary}} sculpture mirrors {{the shape of}} the original urn, and is a reminder of the poet’s great contributions to gardens and landscape design. The urn sculpture is made out of corten steel, which <b>blends</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> red-brick backdrop of the site. It is accompanied by some of Pope’s most famous quotes, carved into new curved wood seating and timber benches connecting new generations with his legacy.|$|R
5|$|The eyes of most frogs {{are located}} {{on either side of}} the head near the top and project {{outwards}} as hemispherical bulges. They provide binocular vision over a field of 100° to the front and a total visual field of almost 360°. They may be the only part of an otherwise submerged frog to protrude from the water. Each eye has closable upper and lower lids and a nictitating membrane which provides further protection, especially when the frog is swimming. Members of the aquatic family Pipidae have the eyes located at the top of the head, a position better suited for detecting prey in the water above. The irises come in a range of colours and the pupils in a range of shapes. The common toad (Bufo bufo) has golden irises and horizontal slit-like pupils, the red-eyed tree frog (Agalychnis callidryas) has vertical slit pupils, the poison dart frog has dark irises, the fire-bellied toad (Bombina spp.) has triangular pupils and the tomato frog (Dyscophus spp.) has circular ones. The irises of the southern toad (Anaxyrus terrestris) are patterned so as to <b>blend</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> surrounding camouflaged skin.|$|E

Claire Suddath of Time Entertainment {{noted that}} the speed in which Rihanna delivers her vocal is so fast that it <b>blends</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> composition, which she wrote [...] "becomes {{the basis for the}} beat." [...] The instrumentation of [...] "Cockiness (Love It)" [...] consists of vocal whoops, cracking drums and bawling horns.|$|R
50|$|For many years, {{the black}} sand {{was used in}} the {{building}} industry. During recent times, because of destruction to the coastal areas, the government has restricted the amount of sand that may be removed from beaches, as well as the specific beaches from which sand may be removed. The sand is still used in construction of pitched roads, as it <b>blends</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> colour of the asphalt used for road construction.|$|R
50|$|However, the Mormon {{settlement}} did not last. Emily Cutler Kimball died {{not long}} after the settlement was established and is buried there. Two other Mormon women died there also, and until the mid-1960s the stones were still evident. Some of the settlers moved to Utah within the next two to five years as violence from the chaos of Bleeding Kansas intensified, while others may have given up their Mormon identity and <b>blended</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> local populace.|$|R
