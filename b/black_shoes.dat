Either white, blue or <b>black</b> <b>shoes</b> with either white or black laces must be worn.

5|$|Only a {{few days}} after the death of Theodore II (the sources {{disagree}} on the exact date, although 25 August is the widely accepted date), a memorial service was held at the Monastery of Sosandra in Magnesia, founded by John III Vatatzes (r. 1221–1254) and serving as his and Theodore's burial place. The entire court attended, while the army was encamped on the plain below the monastery. As soon as George Mouzalon, his brothers and his retinue arrived, the service began. Outside the church, however, soldiers had assembled, many of them Latin mercenaries, and they began to clamour and demand to see the young emperor. John IV went outside and raised his hand to quiet them; the soldiers, however, allegedly mistook this as a signal. Joined by a large mob, they stormed the church aiming to kill the Mouzalon brothers. They were warned of what was going on, but George only sent his secretary Theophylact to investigate. He was mistaken for Mouzalon and killed by the crowd. The mob, however, realized its error (the secretary was wearing <b>black</b> <b>shoes,</b> while the protovestiarios wore green ones) and entered the church, the soldiers with swords in hand.|$|E

25|$|Prior to 2009, the Bulls wore white {{shoes at}} {{home during the}} regular season, <b>black</b> <b>shoes</b> {{on the road and}} <b>black</b> <b>shoes</b> home and away all {{throughout}} the playoffs. The unofficial playoff tradition goes back to the Jordan era, recommended by Brad Sellers as a show of team unity. The Bulls also wore their red uniform on all playoff road games, until the team opted to wear their sleeved black uniforms in the 2017 NBA Playoffs. During the 2008–09 season and first three games of the playoffs, however, the Bulls wore black sneakers on away games only while wearing white sneakers on home games. Since the 2009–10 season, however, the NBA has relaxed its rules on specific sneaker colors on home and away games, and several Bulls players are seen wearing white sneakers on the road, or black at home during the regular season, even seen wearing red on occasion.|$|E

25|$|The team's helmet is purple with a Viking horn logo on each side. Each horn is {{outlined}} in gold. The horn logo was slightly revised in 2006. The original uniform design consisted of white pants, gold trim, and either purple or white jerseys. From 1962 to 1964, the Vikings wore purple pants with their white jerseys (The Vikings, {{with their new}} uniform, still wear, on occasion, purple pants with yellow and white trim). In a design that was unique among American football teams, the white jerseys had a completely different stripe pattern, which was over the shoulders, than the purple ones, which was around the sleeve cuff. These unique shoulder stripes on the white jerseys did not appear until 1969, the year they went to their first Super Bowl. There have also been {{minor changes to the}} uniform design throughout the years, such as changing the color of the facemask from gray to white (1980), and then to purple (1985); and adding the Norseman logo to the sleeves (1996). The Vikings continued to wear <b>black</b> <b>shoes</b> until Les Steckel became head coach in 1984. In 2006, the team returned to <b>black</b> <b>shoes</b> for first time since the 1983 season.|$|E

25|$|Heading {{into his}} 17th {{professional}} {{season as a}} 42-year-old, Turner's game attire was still a black headband, black sleeve, <b>black</b> <b>shoes</b> and black socks—a tradition dating back to his high school days. Turner's original swag was still on display to make him the game's most compelling figure. Turner was captivated as a youth by the audacity of Michigan's Fab Five, basketball's first hip-hop stars. As a teenager, Turner modelled his appearance and game on them, and {{a quarter of a}} century on, their attitude and aggression still informed his game. On October 8, 2016, in the third game of the 2016–17 season, Turner rolled back the years with a season-best 45 points to help Killester defeat Moycullen 83–74.|$|E
