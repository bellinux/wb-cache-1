40|$|A {{contribution}} {{to a better understanding}} and modeling of the drying of a <b>Baker's</b> <b>yeast</b> rod-shaped pellet is proposed. An original experimental setup is developed allowing the characterization of the drying of a <b>Baker's</b> <b>yeast</b> pellet by using a precision balance, a microscope and an infrared camera. Using this experimental setup, the time evolution of the pellets moisture content, dimensions and surface temperature can be obtained in a large set of operating conditions (air temperature, air velocity and initial pellet diameter). The evolution of the fermentative activity of the <b>Baker's</b> <b>yeast</b> during drying as a function of its moisture content can also be investigated through the measurement of its gassing power. In this study, a set of drying experiments of <b>Baker's</b> <b>yeast</b> pellets in this original setup and with a data treatment procedure is presented. A new phenomenological model of the drying of a cylindrical <b>Baker's</b> <b>yeast</b> pellet is built on the basis of heat and mass transfer laws. It includes a description of the shrinkage of the material and it provides a link between the initial drying rate and the <b>Baker's</b> <b>yeast</b> activity {{at the end of the}} drying. The unknown parameters are identified by a comparison with experimental results. The combined use of the model and the experimental results leads to four main conclusions: three types of water exists in <b>Baker's</b> <b>yeast</b> pellets (a residual water, a water whose extraction is limited by mass transport phenomena in gas phase inside or outside the pellet, and a third type of water whose extraction is significantly slower); there is an isotropic linear shrinkage during drying which has no significant influence on the drying rate but which appears to be drying rate dependent as, at a same moisture content, a larger drying rate leads to a smaller shrinkage; the time evolution of the pellets surface temperature presents a change of regime at a moisture content of about 0. 6 (d. b.); the <b>Baker's</b> <b>yeast</b> activity remains high when its moisture content is larger than 0. 75 (d. b.) and the activity at the end of the drying is directly related to the initial <b>Baker's</b> <b>yeast</b> drying rate. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|This work {{deals with}} the {{examination}} of the proinflammatory activity of the ß-(1 → 3) -D-glucans and its detection in airborne dusts out of animal stables. A proinflammatory activity could be proved by means of the human whole blood assay. The following reaction order resulted: curdlan > zymosan > glucan from <b>bakers</b> <b>yeast</b> > barley glucan > paramylon > laminarin. The molecular weight and the room structure turned out to be important influence factors on the proinflammatory activity of the ß-(1 → 3) -D-glucans. A high molecular weight into combination with an open triple helix (curdlan) caused the highest proinflammatory activity. Glucans without an open triple helix, e. g. glucan from <b>bakers</b> <b>yeast</b> showed a lower proinflammatory activity. The missing proinflammatory activity of laminarin is based on the low molecular weight which is below the minimum weight related to the release of cytokines. Furthermore the single helix as conformation in combination with a high molecular weight leads to a low induction of cytokines. This is the case at paramylon. The glucan-specific LAL-Test is frequently described as a proof system for the quantification of glucans in different media and also in bioaerosol samples. The reaction order in this test system was laminarin > barley glucan > zymosan > glucan from <b>bakers</b> <b>yeast</b> > paramylon > curdlan and differed considerably from the reaction order in the human whole blood assay. Laminarin which did not stand out due to any provable activity in the whole blood assay stand out showed the highest reactivity in the glucan-specific LAL test. For this reason the pretreatment with NaOH of bioaerosol samples containing glucans which carry over the triple helix of the glucan into a single helix led to higher proof rates in the glucan-specific LAL test. Due to the therefore missing comparability of these two systems no direct conclusions can be drawn by the determination of the concentration of airborne glucans by means of glucan- specific LAL-Test on the proinflammatory potency...|$|E

Nowadays the production of <b>baker's</b> <b>yeast</b> biomass represents a highly competitive multi-billion dollar global industry. The environmental conditions that prevail during manufacture and application of <b>baker's</b> <b>yeasts,</b> coupled with the sheer variety of bread making processes and recipes used around the world, place considerable demands on yeasts. These demands translate into technological and economic challenges for producers of <b>baker's</b> <b>yeasts.</b> One way to meet these challenges is to improve the physiological attributes of yeasts so that they are better suited to the complex requirements of the modem baking industry. Improvement or modification of yeast performance can be achieved to some extent by modifying the parameters of their growth and downstream processing during production.

40|$|Abstract Background During the {{bread-making}} process, industrial <b>baker's</b> <b>yeast,</b> mostly Saccharomyces cerevisiae, {{is exposed}} to baking-associated stresses, such as air-drying and freeze-thaw stress. These baking-associated stresses exert severe injury to yeast cells, mainly due to the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to cell death and reduced fermentation ability. Thus, {{there is a great}} need for a <b>baker's</b> <b>yeast</b> strain with higher tolerance to baking-associated stresses. Recently, we revealed a novel antioxidative mechanism in a laboratory yeast strain that is involved in stress-induced nitric oxide (NO) synthesis from proline via proline oxidase Put 1 and N -acetyltransferase Mpr 1. We also found that expression of the proline-feedback inhibition-less sensitive mutant γ-glutamyl kinase (Pro 1 -I 150 T) and the thermostable mutant Mpr 1 -F 65 L resulted in an enhanced fermentation ability of <b>baker's</b> <b>yeast</b> in bread dough after freeze-thaw stress and air-drying stress, respectively. However, <b>baker's</b> <b>yeast</b> strains with high fermentation ability under multiple baking-associated stresses have not yet been developed. Results We constructed a self-cloned diploid <b>baker's</b> <b>yeast</b> strain with enhanced proline and NO synthesis by expressing Pro 1 -I 150 T and Mpr 1 -F 65 L in the presence of functional Put 1. The engineered strain increased the intracellular NO level in response to air-drying stress, and the strain was tolerant not only to oxidative stress but also to both air-drying and freeze-thaw stresses probably due to the reduced intracellular ROS level. We also showed that the resultant strain retained higher leavening activity in bread dough after air-drying and freeze-thaw stress than that of the wild-type strain. On the other hand, enhanced stress tolerance and fermentation ability did not occur in the put 1 -deficient strain. This result suggests that NO is synthesized in <b>baker's</b> <b>yeast</b> from proline in response to oxidative stresses that induce ROS generation and that increased NO {{plays an important role in}} baking-associated stress tolerance. Conclusions In this work, we clarified the importance of Put 1 - and Mpr 1 -mediated NO generation from proline to the baking-associated stress tolerance in industrial <b>baker's</b> <b>yeast.</b> We also demonstrated that <b>baker's</b> <b>yeast</b> that enhances the proline and NO synthetic pathway by expressing the Pro 1 -I 150 T and Mpr 1 -F 65 L variants showed improved fermentation ability under multiple baking-associated stress conditions. From a biotechnological perspective, the enhancement of proline and NO synthesis could be promising for breeding novel <b>baker's</b> <b>yeast</b> strains. </p...|$|R

Submerged fermentations was carried out in a fermentor of 3 litters capacity. So, the obtained results show that the optimal <b>Bakers</b> <b>yeast</b> production was obtained at dilution rate of 0. 22 h - 1. On the other hand, the strain of Sacccharomyces cerevisiae SC-DB-A 12 produced high yield biomass compared to other strains. Also, the use of ammonium phosphate provides better biomass yields compared to other nitrogen source. Concerning the citric acid production, the optimal fermentation period was 144 h. The maximum citric acid production was obtained at 30 C and at 150. 0 g L - 1 of sugars. In the same way, the addition of methanol at concentration up to 3. 0 % resulted in a marked increase in the citric acid production. In addition, the optimum pH for maximum citric acid production was 3. 5. The aeration rate kept at a level of 1. 0 L/L/min was found to be optimum. Finally, the best results were observed when 2. 5 g L - 1 ammonium nitrate and 2. 5 g L - 1 of potassium phosphate were added into the medium.
