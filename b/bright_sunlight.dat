5|$|During {{sunrise and}} sunset, {{sunlight}} is attenuated because of Rayleigh scattering and Mie scattering from a particularly long passage through Earth's atmosphere, and the Sun is sometimes faint {{enough to be}} viewed comfortably {{with the naked eye}} or safely with optics (provided there is no risk of <b>bright</b> <b>sunlight</b> suddenly appearing through a break between clouds). Hazy conditions, atmospheric dust, and high humidity contribute to this atmospheric attenuation.|$|E
5|$|Adiantum viridimontanum largely reproduces asexually by {{branching}} {{rather than}} sexually through spores. While wind-blown spores {{can result in}} sexual reproduction for the species, most spores probably fall within a relatively short radius of the plant. In addition, reproduction through spore dispersal requires the spore to land in suitable conditions for generating a gametophyte, typically in <b>bright</b> <b>sunlight</b> on thin serpentine soils. These requirements allow A.viridimontanum to colonize recently disturbed sites on ultramafic outcrops, where bedrock has been exposed and competing plants have been removed. The populations appear stable, with the long life of individuals compensating for low recruitment rates.|$|E
5|$|C.maxima {{originated}} in South America over 4,000 years ago, probably in Argentina and Uruguay. The plants {{are sensitive to}} frost, and they prefer both <b>bright</b> <b>sunlight</b> and soil with a pH of 6.0 to 7.0. C.maxima did not start to spread into North America until after the arrival of Columbus. Varieties were in use by native peoples of the United States by the 16th century. Types of C.maxima include triloba, zapallito, zipinka, Banana, Delicious, Hubbard, Marrow (C.maxima Marrow), Show, and Turban.|$|E
50|$|<b>Brighter</b> Than <b>Sunlight</b> is {{the fourth}} {{full-length}} album from the band, Ellison, released for digital download in 2012. Ellison worked on <b>Brighter</b> Than <b>Sunlight</b> for over three years, finally releasing it four years after their last album, Color Of Compassion, was released.|$|R
50|$|High-dynamic-range images: {{accurately}} {{represent the}} wide range of intensity levels found in real scenes ranging from the <b>brightest</b> direct <b>sunlight</b> to the deepest darkest shadows.|$|R
50|$|During {{daylight}} hours {{when the sun}} is visible, a heliograph mirror can be used to flash <b>bright,</b> intense <b>sunlight.</b> Battery-powered laser lights the size of small flashlights (electric torches) are available for use in emergency signalling.|$|R
5|$|The most {{important}} form of decoration is relief. Relief became more extensive over time, and in late temples, walls, ceilings, columns, and beams were all decorated, as were free-standing stelae erected within the enclosure. Egyptian artists used both bas relief and sunken relief. Bas relief allowed more subtle artistry but involved more carving than sunken relief. Sunken relief was therefore used on harder, more difficult stone {{and when the}} builders wanted to finish quickly. It was also appropriate for exterior surfaces, where the shadows it created made the figures stand out in <b>bright</b> <b>sunlight.</b> Finished reliefs were painted using the basic colors black, white, red, yellow, green, and blue, although the artists often mixed pigments to create other colors. In some cases, gilding or inlaid pieces of colored glass or faience substituted for paint.|$|E
5|$|Laura Knight {{spent the}} summer of 1908 working on the beaches at Newlyn making studies for her large {{painting}} of children in <b>bright</b> <b>sunlight.</b> The Beach was shown at the Royal Academy in 1909, and was considered a great success, showing Laura painting in a more Impressionist style than she had displayed previously. About this time she began painting compositions {{of women in the}} open air, in the plein-air manner, often on the rocks or cliff-tops around Lamorna. Knight would sometimes use models from London who were prepared to pose nude. Although there was some resentment locally about this, the landowner, a Colonel Paynter, was fully supportive and allowed Knight and the other artists a free rein. Daughters of the Sun, which showed several women, some naked, sitting by a coastal inlet was completed in 1911 and well received when shown at the Royal Academy, but was subsequently damaged and destroyed. In recent years examples of Knight's plein-air compositions from Cornwall have attracted high prices at auction.|$|E
5|$|Van Gogh {{strove to}} be a painter of rural life and nature, and {{during his first}} summer in Arles he used his new palette to paint landscapes and {{traditional}} rural life. His belief that a power existed behind the natural led {{him to try to}} capture a sense of that power, or the essence of nature in his art, sometimes through the use of symbols. His renditions of the sower, at first copied from Jean-François Millet, reflect Van Gogh's religious beliefs: the sower as Christ sowing life beneath the hot sun. These were themes and motifs he returned to often to rework and develop. His paintings of flowers are filled with symbolism, but rather than use traditional Christian iconography he made up his own, where life is lived under the sun and work is an allegory of life. In Arles, having gained confidence after painting spring blossoms and learning to capture <b>bright</b> <b>sunlight,</b> he was ready to paint The Sower.|$|E
50|$|Due to its fluorescence, Indian yellow is {{especially}} vivid and <b>bright</b> in <b>sunlight.</b> It was likely first used by Dutch artists. Before {{the end of}} the 18th century it was commonly used by artists across Europe. The origin of Indian yellow was considered a mystery until 1883.|$|R
60|$|At last, as {{the amateur}} {{lecturer}} {{was beginning to}} grow somewhat prolix, a cormorant below created a slight diversion for awhile by settling in his flight on the very highest point of Michael's Crag, and proceeding to preen his glittering feathers in the full golden flood of that <b>bright</b> August <b>sunlight.</b>|$|R
60|$|When she awakened {{the room}} was <b>bright</b> with <b>sunlight.</b> A cool wind blowing across the bed caused her to put her hands under the blanket. She was lazily and dreamily contemplating the mud walls of this little room when she remembered where she was and how she had come there.|$|R
5|$|From the 1840s onwards more mines {{provided}} crude shelters {{to protect}} surface {{workers from the}} worst of the weather, but at many others work at surface-level took place in the open air. Workers were generally expected to remain at their posts except in the most extreme weather conditions. Bal maidens wore gooks, a specialised bonnet which covered the shoulders and extended over the face to protect from rain, <b>bright</b> <b>sunlight,</b> flying debris and loud noise. In the winter the gook was made of felt, and in summer of cotton. Working in close proximity to heavy industrial machinery, they wore shorter dresses or skirts than the ankle-length clothing typical of the period, and their exposed lower legs were wrapped in protective coverings. Their arms were sometimes protected by hessian sleeves worn over their clothes. Some bal maidens working in cobbing and bucking wore rubber tubing on the fingers of one hand as protection from their hammer. While working bal maidens wore a waist-length hessian apron ('towser') over their clothes, and those who could afford it would have a white herden (flax and hemp) apron for wearing to and from work. These working clothes were accessorised with flowers, bows, ribbons, jewellery and other decoration. Until the end of the 19thcentury the working clothing of a bal maiden changed very little.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} begins with Clarkson {{standing}} in a room wearing a white wedding dress. Holding a bouquet of red rose, she is surrounded by her bridesmaids as they prepare for her wedding. She sits down on a sofa and sees a wedding photo of her fiancé with another woman as a storm begins to form outside. The bridesmaids try to close the windows but fail so they {{run out of the}} room leaving Clarkson alone, who is seen dropping the bouquet of rose as well as the wedding photo from her hands onto the floor. The next scene shows Clarkson walking down the aisle in a church wearing a black dress. She sees a bride standing at the altar with her fiancé, getting married. When she draws the veil of the bride, she realizes that the bride is the woman from the photo. Clarkson, who is now wearing a white wedding dress, runs out of the church and into a dark swamp. A montage of Clarkson singing with her band in a dark swamp is shown alternately with scenes of Clarkson running in the forest and laying on the ground. Clarkson is also seen standing inside an abandoned house, wearing a voluminous black dress. As the rain starts to fall, Clarkson finally collapsed, kneeling on the ground while looking at and being comforted by her other self who is singing with the band. The scene shifts to a present day, where Clarkson is standing at the altar, exchanging vows with her fiancé. Before he puts the ring on her finger, she looks at the guests and notices that the woman from the photo is among the audience. She sees her fiancé exchanging a smile with the woman as the woman blows him a kiss. Clarkson then reaches for the ring and throws it at her fiancé, before running away from the altar. She throws her wedding bouquet into the lap of the woman and shoves her way past the wedding guests who are trying to stop her from leaving. The video ends with Clarkson stepping out the doors into the <b>bright</b> <b>sunlight.</b>|$|E
25|$|There is some {{evidence}} that turn signals with colourless clear lenses and amber bulbs may be less conspicuous in <b>bright</b> <b>sunlight</b> than those with amber lenses and colourless bulbs.|$|E
6000|$|It was on {{the third}} or fourth {{occasion}} of my going out walking in the Temple Gardens leaning on Joe's arm, that I saw this change in him very plainly. We had been sitting in the <b>bright</b> warm <b>sunlight,</b> looking at the river, and I chanced to say as we got up,-- ...|$|R
50|$|As a {{subtropical}} plant, it thrives best in warm {{temperatures in}} humid environments. Getting those conditions is rather hard in temperate latitudes, {{the reason for}} which gardenias are usually cultivated as houseplants or in greenhouses. In warm places, though, it can be grown outdoors. Either way, it prefers <b>bright</b> indirect <b>sunlight</b> or partial shade.|$|R
5000|$|The {{spacecraft}} {{moved across}} Australia {{and across the}} Pacific to Canton Island. Glenn experienced a short 45 minute night and prepared the periscope for viewing his first sunrise from orbit. As the sun rose over the island, he saw thousands of [...] "little specks, brilliant specks, floating around outside the capsule"; he momentarily felt that the spacecraft was tumbling or {{that he was looking}} into a star field. A quick hard look out of the spacecraft window corrected the illusion and Glenn was sure that the [...] "fireflies", as he called them, were streaming past his spacecraft from ahead. They seemed to flow by slowly but {{did not seem to be}} coming from any part of the spacecraft, and they disappeared as Friendship 7 moved into <b>brighter</b> <b>sunlight.</b> It was later determined that they were probably small ice crystals venting from onboard spacecraft systems.|$|R
25|$|For example, when methane {{reacts with}} {{chlorine}} in the dark, the reaction rate is very slow. It can be sped {{up when the}} mixture is put under diffused light. In <b>bright</b> <b>sunlight,</b> the reaction is explosive.|$|E
25|$|Vitamin D {{promotes}} {{the creation of}} serotonin. The production of serotonin is {{in direct proportion to}} the degree of <b>bright</b> <b>sunlight</b> the body receives. Conversely, serotonin levels decrease when sunlight is at its lowest levels, as in autumn and winter.|$|E
25|$|The pain, burning, swelling, and itching {{that occur}} in erythropoietic porphyrias {{generally}} require avoidance of <b>bright</b> <b>sunlight.</b> Most kinds of sunscreen are not effective, but SPF-rated long-sleeve shirts, hats, bandanas, and gloves can help. Chloroquine {{may be used to}} increase porphyrin secretion in some EPs. Blood transfusion is occasionally used to suppress innate heme production.|$|E
6000|$|He consented readily {{and went}} {{away in the}} car, with the <b>bright</b> spring <b>sunlight</b> {{flooding}} the world, feeling himself snared in an invisible net. All thought of leaving the city passed out of his mind. He thought only {{of his mother and}} of her possible revivification. [...] "I will fight the world here if only she will return," [...] he said.|$|R
25|$|Munthe {{developed}} an eye condition which eventually made him virtually blind {{and unable to}} tolerate the <b>bright</b> Italian <b>sunlight.</b> At that point he returned to Sweden {{for a number of}} years and wrote The Story of San Michele (published in 1929), which was well received, having been translated into at least 45 languages and said to be one of the best-selling books of the 20th century.|$|R
40|$|Because of the {{considerable}} {{differences in the}} reported values for serum folate in normal subjects using Lactobacillus casei as assay organism the effect of daylight when preparing media for this assay was studied. It {{was found that the}} growth properties of the medium were destroyed by direct sunlight and impaired by <b>bright</b> reflected <b>sunlight,</b> therefore reducing the sensitivity of the assay. Adequate precautions regarding exposure to light must be taken...|$|R
25|$|Transparent OLEDs: Transparent OLEDs use {{transparent}} or semi-transparent contacts on {{both sides}} of the device to create displays that can be made to be both top and bottom emitting (transparent). TOLEDs can greatly improve contrast, making it much easier to view displays in <b>bright</b> <b>sunlight.</b> This technology can be used in Head-up displays, smart windows or augmented reality applications.|$|E
25|$|The {{effective}} use {{of light and shadow}} to create mood also is central to Hopper's methods. <b>Bright</b> <b>sunlight</b> (as an emblem of insight or revelation), and the shadows it casts, also play symbolically powerful roles in Hopper paintings such as Early Sunday Morning (1930), Summertime (1943), Seven A.M. (1948), and Sun in an Empty Room (1963). His use of light and shadow effects have been compared to the cinematography of film noir.|$|E
25|$|Forms of {{tone mapping}} long precede digital photography. The {{manipulation}} {{of film and}} development process to render high contrast scenes, especially those shot in <b>bright</b> <b>sunlight,</b> on printing paper with a relatively low dynamic range, is effectively a form of tone mapping, {{although it is not}} usually called that. Local adjustment of tonality in film processing is primarily done via dodging and burning, and is particularly advocated by and associated with Ansel Adams, as described in his book The Print; see also his Zone System.|$|E
60|$|As {{he reached}} the pavement, he saw people {{gathering}} {{in front of the}} wide entrance of the Court House opposite, and perched on the copings. He hesitated, curious. Then he walked slowly toward the place, and buttoning his coat, pushed through the loafers and passers-by dallying {{on the outskirts of the}} crowd. There, in the <b>bright</b> November <b>sunlight,</b> a sight met his eyes which turned him sick and dizzy.|$|R
60|$|Ellen ran swaying {{out of the}} door, and, once {{clear of}} the threshold, she tottered out on the grass, to sink to her knees. The <b>bright,</b> golden <b>sunlight</b> gleamed upon her white {{shoulders}} and arms. Jean had one foot {{out of the door}} when he saw her and he whirled back to get her blouse. But Springer had fallen upon it. Snatching up a blanket, Jean ran out.|$|R
60|$|The {{appearance}} of mist or whiteness {{in the blue}} of the sky, is thus a circumstance which more or less accompanies sunshine, and which, supposing the quantity of vapor constant, is greatest in the <b>brightest</b> <b>sunlight.</b> When there are no clouds in the sky, the whiteness, as it affects the whole sky equally, is not particularly noticeable. But when there are clouds between us and the sun, the sun being low, those clouds cast shadows along and through the mass of suspended vapor. Within the space of these shadows, the vapor, as above stated, becomes transparent and invisible, and the sky appears of a pure blue. But where the sunbeams strike, the vapor becomes visible {{in the form of the}} beams, occasioning those radiating shafts of light which are one of the most valuable and constant accompaniments of a low sun. The denser the mist, the more distinct and sharp-edged will these rays be; when the air is very clear, they are mere vague, flushing, gradated passages of light; when it is very thick, they are keen-edged and decisive in a high degree.|$|R
25|$|A forest butterfly, {{the brown}} awl favours {{openings}} and edges of deciduous and evergreen forests while its caterpillars {{are to be}} found in moist deciduous and semi-evergreen forests. It flies about either late or early in the morning in the shade of the jungles. It can be sometimes seen in <b>bright</b> <b>sunlight</b> visiting flowers, such as Glycosmis, Buddleia, Chromolaena and Lantana, but is very wary and energetic at such times, moving jerkily and rapidly between flowers or across inflorescences. It can also be seen mud-puddling or at bird droppings.|$|E
25|$|Chloramine can {{be removed}} from tap water by {{treatment}} with superchlorination (10ppm or more of free chlorine, such as from a dose of sodium hypochlorite bleach or pool sanitizer) while maintaining a pH of about 7 (such as from a dose of hydrochloric acid). Hypochlorous acid from the free chlorine strips the ammonia from the chloramine, and the ammonia outgasses {{from the surface of}} the bulk water. This process takes about 24 hours for normal tap water concentrations of a few ppm of chloramine. Residual free chlorine can then be removed by exposure to <b>bright</b> <b>sunlight</b> for about 4 hours.|$|E
25|$|The reflex design {{scheme is}} the primary {{difference}} between a DSLR and other digital cameras. In the reflex design scheme, the image captured on the camera's sensor is also the image that is seen through the view finder. Light travels through a single lens and a mirror is used to reflect a portion of that light through the view finder – hence the name Single Lens Reflex. While there are variations among point-and-shoot cameras, the typical design exposes the sensor constantly to the light projected by the lens, allowing the camera's screen {{to be used as}} an electronic viewfinder. However, LCDs can be difficult to see in very <b>bright</b> <b>sunlight.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Light of {{our hope}} and crown of our story, [...] <b>Bright</b> as <b>sunlight,</b> pure as starlight shall their deeds of daring [...] glow, [...] While {{the day and}} the night out of heaven shed their glory, [...] On Freedom's Lookout Mountain whence they routed Freedom's foe. [...] O, soft be the gales when they go [...] Through the pines on the summit where they blow, [...] Chanting solemn music for the souls that passed below.|$|R
50|$|Nephrolepis obliterata prefer <b>bright,</b> but {{indirect}} <b>sunlight.</b> Temperatures between 16°C and 24°C are best. Nephrolepis obliterata {{is sensitive}} to both too little and too much water, so water the plant well but permit the soil to dry out between waterings.|$|R
25|$|HDR {{images can}} {{represent}} a greater range of luminance levels {{than can be}} achieved using more 'traditional' methods, such as many real-world scenes containing very <b>bright,</b> direct <b>sunlight</b> to extreme shade, or very faint nebulae. This is often achieved by capturing and then combining several different, narrower range, exposures of the same subject matter. Non-HDR cameras take photographs with a limited exposure range, referred to as LDR, resulting {{in the loss of}} detail in highlights or shadows.|$|R
