They can be small circular pieces of metal, usually steel, with plastic backings, and for plastic bottles a plastic cap is used instead. Caps can also be plastic, sometimes with a pour spout. Flip-Top caps like Flapper closures provide controlled dispensing of dry products. The crown cork, the first form of a bottle cap, possessed flanges <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> sealed bottle to compress the liquid inside. It was invented and patented in 1892 by William Painter of Baltimore, Maryland.|$|E
500|$|According to Aycox, the {{exorcism}} of {{the demon}} from Meg Masters took {{two days to}} shoot; {{the first day of}} filming lasted 13 hours, while the second lasted for [...] "about a half a day". Director Kim Manners used 360-degree shots and close-ups to make the sequence exciting. In the scene following the exorcism, in which Bobby is <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> dying Meg, Aycox and Ackles read their lines off-screen so that Beaver's reaction could be shot. However, the two were [...] "so slap-happy" [...] to be almost done that they could not stop laughing; to everyone's surprise, Beaver was able to keep a straight face. The setBobby Singer's homewas filled with waist-high stacks of six thousand books.|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins at}} a press conference where Spears, wearing a cropped Mickey Mouse top (paying homage to her days in The New Mickey Mouse Club), is being asked {{inappropriate}} questions by news reporters, such as [...] "Is it true you banned junk food, smiles, candy, sunshine and laughter from your Femme Fatale tour?" [...] Angered by the questions, Spears replies (albeit censored): [...] "Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, you're cool, fuck you – I'm out", referencing a scene from the film Half Baked. After leaving the press conference, Spears walks out of the building and out into the street, wearing a white leather jacket and a black skirt with matching with studded combat boots. She signs a fan's copy of Femme Fatale and then blows a kiss to a baby as he whistles the melody of the chorus. As Spears walks along the street, she flashes several men, including a policeman (played by Adrien Galo). As a criminal offence, the policeman searches Spears, feeling up and down her legs, as she is <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> car. Spears later walks away from the policeman, swinging handcuffs around her finger while he buttons his shirt.|$|E

Otherwise the child would be <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> <b>an</b> object such as a chair.

2500|$|One of Lee's abiding beliefs {{was in the}} {{efficacy}} of corporal punishment {{in the form of}} caning. In his autobiography The Singapore Story he described his time at Raffles Institution in the 1930s, mentioning that he was caned there for chronic lateness by the then headmaster, D. W. McLeod. He wrote: [...] "I <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> chair and was given three of the best with my trousers on. I did not think he lightened his strokes. I have never understood why Western educationists are so much against corporal punishment. It did my fellow students and me no harm." ...|$|E
2500|$|It {{was also}} claimed that one Sunday Liddell {{refereed}} a hockey match {{to stop fighting}} amongst the players, as he was trusted not to take sides. One of his fellow internees, Norman Cliff, later {{wrote a book about}} his experiences in the camp called [...] "The Courtyard of the Happy Way" [...] (Chinese 樂道院, also translated as [...] "The Campus of Loving Truth"), which detailed the remarkable characters in the camp. Cliff described Liddell as [...] "the finest Christian gentleman it has been my pleasure to meet. In {{all the time in the}} camp, I never heard him say a bad word about anybody". Langdon Gilkey, who also survived the camp and became a prominent theologian in his native America, said of Liddell: [...] "Often in an evening I would see him <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> chessboard or a model boat, or directing some sort of square dance– absorbed, weary and interested, pouring all of himself into this effort to capture the imagination of these penned-up youths. He was overflowing with good humour and love for life, and with enthusiasm and charm. It is rare indeed that a person has the good fortune to meet a saint, but he came as close to it as anyone I have ever known." ...|$|E
2500|$|At the time, Japanese nationalists {{called the}} {{photograph}} a fake, and the Japanese government put a bounty of $50,000 on Wong's head: an amount equivalent to $ in [...] Wong {{was known to}} be against the Japanese invasion of China and to have leftist political sympathies, and he worked for William Randolph Hearst who was famous for saying to his newsmen, [...] "You furnish the pictures and I'll furnish the war" [...] in relation to the Spanish–American War. Another of Wong's photos appeared in Look magazine on December 21, 1937, showing a man <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> child of perhaps five years of age, both near the crying baby. The man was alleged to be Wong's assistant Taguchi who was arranging the children for best photographic effect. An article in The Japan Times and Mail said the man was a rescue worker who was posing the baby and the boy for the photographer. Wong described the man as the baby's father, coming to rescue his children as the Japanese aircraft returned following the bombing. Japanese propagandists drew a connection between what they claimed was a falsified image and the general news accounts by U.S. and Chinese sources reporting on the fighting in Shanghai, with the aim of discrediting all reports of Japanese atrocities.|$|E

60|$|Poor Mary, being {{agitated}} by the proposal, {{and much}} {{amused by the}} manner of it, <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> pot of something and tried to hide her blushes and amusement in the steam. Buttercup glared, grinned, hugged herself, and waited for more.|$|E
60|$|They went. Marie and Tom, and Mother and I played {{bridge in}} one corner. Lettie {{said she wanted}} to show George some new pictures, and they <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> {{portfolio}} for some time. Then she bade him help her to clear the room for the dances.|$|E
60|$|The {{plans were}} {{spread on the}} oak table in the architect's room; and pale, imperturbable, inquiring, Soames <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> them for <b>a</b> long time without speaking.|$|R
5000|$|The pre-release cover art drew some controversy, as {{it depicts}} {{a naked woman}} bound and <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> on <b>a</b> large platter, with a grenade in her mouth.

6000|$|Long as he {{had been}} {{desiring}} it, however, Kate thought it must have been nothing compared with the time that elapsed ere he said anything else; so she <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> flower which she held in her hand, and said in a low voice, [...] "Indeed, Harry; what is it?" ...|$|E
60|$|Alton {{said nothing}} further, but {{stumbled}} in haste towards the river. Seaforth followed him more slowly, and Alton stood very still {{when he found}} nothing but boulders and shingle. Then he stooped and <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> little depression in the pebbles, and when he rose again his face was impassive.|$|E
60|$|Suddenly {{a shadow}} seemed to dart betwixt {{her and the}} open doorway, Mr. Arbuton was hurled violently against her, and, as she {{struggled}} to keep her footing under the shock, she saw him <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> furious dog, that hung from the breast of his overcoat, while he clutched its throat with both his hands.|$|E
6000|$|Guy <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> him for <b>a</b> {{few seconds}} in {{speechless}} surprise. Words failed him at first. [...] "How {{do you know}} all this, Kelmscott?" [...] {{he said at last}} faintly.|$|R

60|$|It was midnight before either found leisure {{for food}} or rest, and then Dane knelt, with a biscuit in one hand, beside the little {{medicine}} chest in the tent, while Maxwell <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> medical treatise as he ate. Several sick men lay moaning {{just outside the}} illuminated canvas, and one, apparently in delirium, had during the last hour never ceased crooning the hammock-bearers' song.|$|E
60|$|These {{and other}} {{of his words}} were nothing but the {{perfunctory}} babble of the surface while the depths remained paralyzed. He turned away, and <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> chair. Tess {{followed him to the}} middle of the room, where he was, and stood there staring at him with eyes that did not weep. Presently she slid down upon her knees beside his foot, and from this position she crouched in a heap.|$|E
60|$|Thomson {{took his}} place in {{the far corner of the}} room and <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> sheaf of papers. Presently Granet was ushered in. He was leaning a little less heavily upon his stick and he had taken his arm from the sling for a moment. He saluted the General respectfully and glanced across the room towards where Thomson was at work. If he {{recognised}} him, however, he made no sign.|$|E
