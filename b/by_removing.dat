5|$|The LWKT {{subsystem}} {{is being}} employed to partition work among multiple kernel threads (for {{example in the}} networking code there is one thread per protocol per processor), reducing competition <b>by</b> <b>removing</b> the need to share certain resources among various kernel tasks.|$|E
30|$|The 2 -CP <b>removed</b> <b>by</b> {{the entire}} system was the {{summation}} of the 2 -CP <b>removed</b> <b>by</b> the biofilm and the adsorption by activated carbon. Figure  11 f shows the amount of 2 -CP <b>removed</b> <b>by</b> {{the entire system}}, activated carbon, and biofilm in a BAC process. Since 2 -CP <b>removed</b> <b>by</b> adsorption does not change its chemical structure, the amount of 2 -CP <b>removed</b> <b>by</b> the activated carbon also equals the amount of 2 -CP that remains adsorbed in the activated carbon.|$|R

5|$|Another {{concern is}} the fact that {{sugarcane}} fields are traditionally burned just before harvest to avoid harm to the workers, <b>by</b> <b>removing</b> the sharp leaves and killing snakes and other harmful animals, and also to fertilize the fields with ash. Mechanization will reduce pollution from burning fields and has higher productivity than people, and due to mechanization the number of temporary workers in the sugarcane plantations has already declined. By the 2008 harvest season, around 47% of the cane was collected with harvesting machines.|$|E

Rowan served in the Senate from March 4, 1825 to March 3, 1831. During the Twenty-first Congress, he was chairman of the Judiciary Committee.|$|E

5|$|Effective in the 2014 racing season, the {{grandstand}} capacity was reduced from 92,000 to 68,000.
