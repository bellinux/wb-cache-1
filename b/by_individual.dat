However, some charged that this did not eliminate discrimination in education.

The greatest single risk factor for developing schizophrenia is having a first-degree relative with the disease (risk is 6.5%); more than 40% of monozygotic twins of those with schizophrenia are also affected.

40|$|This {{study is}} {{motivated}} by {{the low level of}} intelligence of the remote factors responsible for conflicts and the nature of unorganized protests <b>by</b> <b>individuals</b> in the Nigerian banking sector. The dwindling government commitment to social services, anti-working class policies of the government, the nature of labour laws, failure to recognize good industrial relations practices, lack of trained personnel in Human resources management, relegation of the advice of trained personnel in industrial relations, the use of management prerogative as sword, threat to security of tenure, improper handling of intra-union disputes, physical environment of the work place, and separatist negotiation are some of the remote causes of industrial conflicts. There is a relationship between the remote causes of industrial action and unorganized protests <b>by</b> <b>individuals.</b> The identified remote causes of conflicts trigger unorganized protests <b>by</b> <b>individuals.</b> Managers are yet to acknowledge unorganized protests <b>by</b> <b>individuals,</b> like frauds, absenteeism, high labour turnover {{as an integral part of}} industrial action. The present failure by managers to focus on the remote causes of industrial conflicts and unorganized protests <b>by</b> <b>individuals</b> will not promote industrial peace. To achieve an enduring industrial peace, the remote factors which are responsible for industrial conflicts and unorganized protest <b>by</b> <b>individuals</b> must attract adequate attention...|$|R

5|$|Sometimes {{arms were}} {{purchased}} {{on the black}} market from German soldiers or their allies, or stolen from German supply depots or transports. Purchases were made <b>by</b> <b>individual</b> units and sometimes <b>by</b> <b>individual</b> soldiers. As Germany's prospects for victory diminished and the morale in German units dropped, the number of soldiers willing to sell their weapons correspondingly increased and thus made this source more important. All such purchases were highly risky, as the Gestapo was well aware of this black market in arms and tried to check it by setting up sting operations. For the most part this trade was limited to personal weapons, but occasionally light and heavy machine guns could also be purchased. It was much easier to trade with Italian and Hungarian units stationed in Poland, which more willingly sold their arms to the Polish underground as long as they could conceal this trade from the Germans.|$|E
