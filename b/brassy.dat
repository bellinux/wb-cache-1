5|$|Throughout the mid-1990s, the Daddies toured constantly, {{carrying}} out six cross-country tours in 1996 alone following {{the release of}} their third independent album, Kids on the Street. A remarkable musical departure from their previous work, Kids on the Street was primarily a showcase of the ska influences which had gradually become {{a major part of}} the Daddies' live sound, forgoing their usual <b>brassy</b> funk and swing-based eclecticism in favor of guitar-driven ska, rock and punk. Distributed by noted indie label Caroline Records, Kids on the Street wound up becoming the Daddies' then-most successful release, remaining on The Rockets Retail Sales Top Twenty for over seven months and eventually working its way onto Rolling Stones Alternative Charts.|$|E

5000|$|In Nihil Unbound: Extinction and Enlightenment, Ray <b>Brassier</b> {{maintains}} that philosophy has avoided the traumatic idea of extinction, instead attempting to find meaning {{in a world}} conditioned by {{the very idea of}} its own annihilation. Thus <b>Brassier</b> critiques both the phenomenological and hermeneutic strands of continental philosophy as well as the vitality of thinkers like Gilles Deleuze, who work to ingrain meaning in the world and stave off the [...] "threat" [...] of nihilism. Instead, drawing on thinkers such as Alain Badiou, François Laruelle, Paul Churchland, and Thomas Metzinger, <b>Brassier</b> defends a view of the world as inherently devoid of meaning. That is, rather than avoiding nihilism, <b>Brassier</b> embraces it as the truth of reality. <b>Brassier</b> concludes from his readings of Badiou and Laruelle that the universe is founded on the nothing, but also that philosophy is the [...] "organon of extinction," [...] that it is only because life is conditioned by its own extinction that there is thought at all. <b>Brassier</b> then defends a radically anti-correlationist philosophy proposing that Thought is conjoined not with Being, but with Non-Being.|$|R

25|$|The juveniles of the yellowspotted {{trevally}} are uniformly silver {{with a few}} golden spots {{above the}} lateral line, with the upper body becoming a more iridescent blue green with increasing age. At adulthood, many small golden to <b>brassy</b> spots occur above the midline with large individuals also having three irregular, indistinct dark blotches on the flank. An inconspicuous dusky spot is usually seen on the operculum. The dorsal and anal fins are dusky yellow, with the anal fin having a whitish-blue leading edge and distal margin. The pectoral and caudal fins are olive-yellow, becoming dusky at the edges, while the pelvic fin is whitish-blue.|$|E
25|$|The show often {{includes}} strong, <b>brassy,</b> long-suffering {{women who}} exhibit diva-like behaviour and stoically battle through {{an array of}} tragedy and misfortune. Such characters include Angie Watts, Kathy Beale, Sharon Watts, Pat Butcher, Denise Fox and Tanya Branning. Conversely there are female characters who handle tragedy less well, depicted as eternal victims and endless sufferers, who include Sue Osman, Little Mo Mitchell, Laura Beale, Lisa Fowler, Ronnie Mitchell and Linda Carter. The 'tart with a heart' is another recurring character, often popular with viewers. Often their promiscuity masks a hidden vulnerability {{and a desire to}} be loved. Such characters have included Pat Butcher (though in her latter years, this changed), Tiffany Mitchell, Kat Slater, Stacey Slater, Dawn Swann and Roxy Mitchell.|$|E
25|$|The crevalle jack's colour {{ranges from}} <b>brassy</b> green to blue or bluish-black dorsally, {{becoming}} silvery white or golden ventrally.

Juveniles have around five dark vertical bands on their sides, with these fading at adulthood. The first dorsal fin, pectoral and pelvic fins range from white to dusky, occasionally with golden tinges throughout. The anal fin lobe is bright yellow, with {{the remainder of the}} fin ranging from golden to dusky, while the underside of the caudal peduncle often being yellow in adults. The caudal fin itself is also golden to dusky, with the lower lobe often brighter yellow than the upper, with both the lobes often having a black trailing edge.|$|E

25|$|The giant {{trevally}} is {{a solitary}} fish once it reaches sexual maturity, only schooling {{for the purposes}} of reproduction and more rarely for feeding. Juveniles and subadults commonly school, both in marine and estuarine environments. Observations from South African estuaries indicate the schools of smaller juveniles tend not to intermingle with schools of other species, but larger subadults are known to form mixed-species schools with the <b>brassy</b> trevally. Research has been conducted on the movements of larger fish around their habitats, as well as the movement between habitats as the species grows, to understand how marine reserves impact on the species. Adult giant trevally are known to range back and forth up to 9km along a home range, with some evidence of diel and seasonal shifts in habitat use. In the Hawaiian Islands, giant trevally do not normally move between atolls, but have specific core areas where they spend most their time. Within these core areas, habitat shifts during different times of the day have been recorded, with the fish being most active at dawn and dusk, and usually shifting location near sunrise or sunset. Furthermore, large seasonal migrations appear to occur for the purpose of aggregating for spawning, with this also known from the Solomon Islands. Despite not moving between atolls, they do make periodic atoll-wide journeys of up to 29km. Long-term studies show juveniles can move up to 70km away from their protected habitats to outer reefs and atolls. The giant trevally {{is one of the most}} important apex predators in its habitats, both as adults on reefs and as juveniles in estuaries. Observations in relatively untouched waters of the northwestern Hawaiian Islands showed the giant trevally was of high ecological importance, constituting 71% of the apex predator biomass, and was the dominant apex predator. This number is considerably less in heavily fished Hawaiian waters. At smaller sizes, the species is prey to sharks, and large individuals have been recorded as a host of the sharksucker, Echeneis naucrates, a fish which is normally seen attached to the undersides of sharks.|$|E

5000|$|Laruelle further {{argues that}} the decisional {{structure}} of philosophy can only be grasped non-philosophically. In this sense, non-philosophy is a science of philosophy. Non-philosophy is not metaphilosophy because, as Laruelle scholar Ray <b>Brassier</b> notes, [...] "philosophy is already metaphilosophical through its constitutive reflexivity". <b>Brassier</b> also defines non-philosophy as the [...] "theoretical practice of philosophy proceeding by way of transcendental axioms and producing theorems which are philosophically uninterpretable". The reason why the axioms and theorems of non-philosophy are philosophically uninterpretable is because, as explained, philosophy cannot grasp its decisional structure {{in the way that}} non-philosophy can.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Brassier</b> is {{strongly}} critical {{of much of}} contemporary philosophy for what he regards as its attempt [...] "to stave off the 'threat' of nihilism by safeguarding the experience of meaning - characterized as the defining feature of human existence - from the Enlightenment logic of disenchantment".
