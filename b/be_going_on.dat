The more extreme Whig papers, anti-royal pamphleteers, and caricaturists all offered nefarious {{explanations}} for Sellis's death, in which the Duke was to blame. Some stories had the Duke cuckolding Sellis, with the attack as retaliation, or Sellis killed for finding Ernest and Mrs. Sellis in bed together. Others suggested that the Duke was the lover of either Sellis or Neale, and that blackmail had {{played a part in}} the death. Both Roger Fulford and John Van der Kiste, who wrote books about George III's children, ascribe part of the animus and fear towards the Duke {{to the fact that he}} did not conduct love affairs in public, as did his older brothers. According to them, the public feared what vices might <b>be</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> behind the locked doors of the Duke's house, and assumed the worst.|$|E

500|$|Between 1971 and 1973, reserves, public {{recreation}} {{areas and}} drainage sites were {{set aside in}} western Hamersley, and facilities were erected in quick succession – the 1st Hamersley Scout Group in 1973, the colonial-style Holy Cross Anglican Church in 1974, and a community hall at Aintree Street in 1975. Residents in the region were at this time {{on the fringe of}} Perth's suburban area, relying on partly built main roads, distant shopping centres and overstretched local facilities for several years after the suburb's construction. A locally produced fortnightly newspaper, the Hamersley Gazette, started in early 1973 by Peter Flanigan, from his home in Manton Court, covering the suburbs of Carine, Hamersley, Warwick and Greenwood, with the open aim of helping to form community associations and campaign for better facilities.

[...] McAlpine attributed this to the song's [...] "Tigger-beat", explaining, [...] "How can anything too sordid <b>be</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> when everyone is bouncing around like they're on spacehoppers?" [...] Bill Lamb of About.com commented, [...] "You will hear echoes of another pop classic, but the new song stands on its own feet." [...] However, he noted that while pop music fans would appreciate it, hip hop listeners would likely dismiss it, and he added that [...] "t's not groundbreaking by any means".|$|E
