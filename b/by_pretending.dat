Realising that this is likely to mean his death, Blackadder plans to escape <b>by</b> <b>pretending</b> to be mad: he puts underpants on his head and sticks pencils in his nostrils. His plan is thwarted when General Melchett arrives to see what is happening and remarks that he shot an entire platoon that used this exact method; Blackadder overhears and narrowly escapes Melchett's punishment <b>by</b> <b>pretending</b> he is relating the story to Baldrick.|$|E
5|$|Leavelle's {{design is}} based on Texan detective Jim Leavelle, as he {{appeared}} when escorting Lee Harvey Oswald when Oswald was shot by Jack Ruby. Leavelle trains the bodyguards <b>by</b> <b>pretending</b> to shoot their protectee from a grassy knoll on a cart. This is {{a reference to the}} grassy knoll at the site of President John F. Kennedy’s assassination, Dealey Plaza and a scene from the Kennedy assassination film Executive Action (1973).|$|E

5|$|In early 1928, Chaplin {{began writing}} the script with Harry Carr. The plot {{gradually}} grew from an initial concept Chaplin had considered after {{the success of}} The Circus, where a circus clown goes blind and has to conceal his handicap from his young daughter <b>by</b> <b>pretending</b> that his inability to see are pratfalls. This inspired the Blind Girl. The first scenes Chaplin thought up were of the ending, where the newly cured blind girl sees the Little Tramp for the first time. A highly {{detailed description of the}} scene was written, as Chaplin considered it {{to be the center of}} the entire film.|$|E

He states that Pythagoras, Empedocles, Democritus and Plato all travelled abroad to learn magic, remarking that it was surprising anyone accepted the doctrines they brought back, and that medicine (of Hippocrates) and magic (of Democritus) should have flourished simultaneously {{at the time of the}} Peloponnesian War.|$|E

5|$|There are {{different}} {{accounts of the}} rise of Darius to the throne from both Darius himself and Greek historians. The oldest records report a convoluted sequence of events in which Cambyses II lost his mind, murdered his brother Bardiya, and was killed by an infected leg wound. After this, Darius and a group of six nobles traveled to Sikayauvati to kill an usurper, Gaumata, who had taken the throne <b>by</b> <b>pretending</b> to be Bardiya during the true king's absence. Many modern historians believe that Gaumata, in fact, was the true heir Bardiya, with the historical account being altered by Darius to make the coup d'etat appear more legitimate.|$|E

25|$|The Goths {{were engaged}} near Naissus by a Roman army {{advancing}} from the north. The battle most likely {{took place in}} 269, and was fiercely contested. Large numbers on both sides were killed but, at the critical point, the Romans tricked the Goths into an ambush <b>by</b> <b>pretended</b> flight. Some 50,000 Goths were allegedly killed or taken captive. It seems that Aurelian, {{who was in charge}} of all Roman cavalry during reign of Claudius, led the decisive attack in the battle.|$|R

5|$|Argo is a 2012 {{political}} thriller {{directed by}} Ben Affleck, and produced by Grant Heslov, Affleck and George Clooney. The screenplay by Chris Terrio {{was adapted from}} sections of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) operative Tony Mendez's memoir The Master of Disguise: My Secret Life in the CIA, and the 2007 Wired article The Great Escape by Joshuah Bearman on the Canadian Caper. The film stars Affleck as Mendez, who attempts to rescue six United States diplomats from Tehran, Iran, during the 1979–81 Iran hostage crisis <b>by</b> <b>pretending</b> that {{they are part of}} a film crew scouting the country for the filming of a fictitious science-fiction film, Argo.

5|$|Early on 31 August, the 2/12th Infantry Battalion {{began moving}} towards KB Mission, with 'D' Company {{leading the way}} and {{struggling}} through muddy conditions along the track, which {{had been turned into}} a quagmire due to the heavy rain and equally heavy traffic. After passing through the 61st Infantry Battalion's position, at around 9:00am they began their counterattack along the north coast of Milne Bay. As the Australians went they were harassed by snipers and ambush parties. They also encountered several Japanese soldiers who tried to lure the Australians in close for attack <b>by</b> <b>pretending</b> to be dead. In response, some Australians systematically bayoneted and shot the bodies of Japanese soldiers. At noon, the 9th Infantry Battalion, a Militia unit from the 7th Infantry Brigade, dispatched two companies to occupy some of the ground that the 2/12th had regained around No. 3 Airstrip and the mission.|$|E
5|$|When Kosseff asks Charlie {{about the}} incident, {{he insists that}} he was not in his grandmother's room, and that it was a boy named Michael. Maggie is terrified at the claim, {{explaining}} to the agents that Michael was Charlie’s stillborn twin, about whom she and Steve agreed to never tell Charlie. Maggie also explains that Golda had told the parents that a ritual should be performed to separate the spirits of the twins, but Steve refused. Charlie has another seizure and is hospitalized. Michael knocks out the nurse and afterward convinces Maggie, <b>by</b> <b>pretending</b> to be Charlie, to take him home. Scully sees them leaving, and checks on Charlie. They find the nurse and Charlie still in the hospital room. Mulder, now convinced that Michael's spirit is behind the killings, sends Scully to the Holvey residence to stop him.|$|E

5|$|When the English Civil War {{broke out}} in 1642, Portland was {{initially}} controlled by Parliamentary forces. The castle was captured in 1643 {{by a group of}} Royalists who gained access <b>by</b> <b>pretending</b> to be Parliamentary soldiers. As the war turned against the King in the south-west, Parliamentary forces besieged the castle for four months in 1644, and once again the following year. The castle finally surrendered to Vice-Admiral William Batten in April 1646. It is uncertain why the castle, which was not easily defensible on the landward side, proved so difficult to take; the historian Peter Harrington has suggested that its low-lying position may have made it difficult for Parliament to bombard it from the sea.|$|E
5|$|Canning's {{views on}} the Catholic Question were not well {{received}} by the most conservative Tories, including the Duke of Wellington. As a result, the ministry was forced to include Whigs. Canning died later in that year, leaving Frederick Robinson, 1st Viscount Goderich, to lead the tenuous Tory-Whig coalition. Lord Goderich left office in 1828, to be succeeded by the Duke of Wellington, who had by that time accepted that the denial of some measure of relief to Roman Catholics was politically untenable. George was never as friendly with Wellington {{as he had been}} with Canning and chose to annoy the Duke <b>by</b> <b>pretending</b> to have fought at Waterloo disguised as a German general. With great difficulty Wellington obtained the King's consent to the introduction of a Catholic Relief Bill on 29 January 1829. Under pressure from his fanatically anti-Catholic brother, the Duke of Cumberland, the King withdrew his approval and in protest the Cabinet resigned en masse on 4 March. The next day the King, now under intense political pressure, reluctantly agreed to the Bill and the ministry remained in power. Royal Assent was finally granted to the Catholic Relief Act on 13 April.|$|E
5|$|In 1634, another tale with a trickster cat as hero was {{published}} in Giambattista Basile's collection Pentamerone although neither the collection nor the tale were published in France during Perrault's lifetime. In Basile, the lad is a beggar boy called Gagliuso (sometimes Cagliuso) whose fortunes are achieved {{in a manner similar}} to Perrault's Puss. However, the tale ends with Cagliuso, in gratitude to the cat, promising the feline a gold coffin upon his death. Three days later, the cat decides to test Gagliuso <b>by</b> <b>pretending</b> to be dead and is mortified to hear Gagliuso tell his wife to take the dead cat by its paws and throw it out the window. The cat leaps up, demanding to know whether this was his promised reward for helping the beggar boy to a better life. The cat then rushes away, leaving his master to fend for himself. In another rendition, the cat performs acts of bravery, then a fairy comes and turns him to his normal state to be with other cats.|$|E

5|$|Iron Maiden {{recruited}} {{yet another}} guitarist in 1977, Bob Sawyer, who was sacked for embarrassing the band on stage <b>by</b> <b>pretending</b> to play guitar with his teeth. Tension ensued again, causing a rift between Murray and Wilcock, who convinced Harris to fire Murray, {{as well as}} original drummer Ron Matthews. A new line-up was put together, including future Cutting Crew member Tony Moore on keyboards, Terry Wapram on guitar, and drummer Barry Purkis (better known today as Thunderstick). A bad performance at the Bridgehouse, a pub located in Canning Town, in November 1977 was the line-up's first and only concert and led to Purkis being replaced by Doug Sampson. At the same time, Moore was asked to leave as Harris decided that keyboards did not suit the band's sound. A few months later, Dennis Wilcock decided {{that he had had}} enough with the group and left to form his own band, V1, and Dave Murray was immediately reinstated. As he preferred to be the band's sole guitarist, Wapram disapproved of Murray's return and was also dismissed.|$|E
5|$|Manuel is {{mentioned}} {{for the first}} time in 978, when he led the defence of Nicaea against the rebel general Bardas Skleros, who had risen up against Emperor Basil II (reigned 976–1025). Although his great-granddaughter, the princess Anna Komnene, claims in her Alexiad that he had been named strategos autokrator (commander-in-chief) of the East and sent with full powers to deal with the revolt, it is far more likely that he was merely a local commander. Manuel maintained the city's defence with some success, even though the besiegers managed to undermine and collapse one of its towers, until the lack of food became acute. At that point Manuel was able to fool Skleros, <b>by</b> <b>pretending</b> that he had mountains of wheat and was considering joining him, into allowing him and the inhabitants to depart freely for Constantinople. Manuel re-appears in 989, when he was sent as an envoy to Skleros, who had once more risen in revolt against Basil II, to persuade him to surrender. Manuel was successful in his task, and the elderly rebel ended his revolt and gave himself up on 11 October. The titles by which he is recorded were patrikios, anthypatos, and vestes.|$|E
5|$|Michael decides {{the workers}} are {{stressed}} because they are reluctant to express their feelings, so he organizes a comedic roast of himself in the warehouse. Dwight tricks most of the employees into signing his apology letter <b>by</b> <b>pretending</b> it is a sign-in sheet, but Phyllis (Phyllis Smith) catches on and refuses to sign it. Each {{of the office and}} warehouse workers gleefully take jabs at Michael, who initially seems to enjoy the jokes, but grows increasingly uncomfortable and offended. When it comes time for him to roast his employees, Michael ends up storming out of the warehouse, visibly upset. After the roast, Michael takes a personal day (much to the concern of his employees, who start to feel bad about the scathing jokes towards Michael) and spends time at a playground to reflect, feeding pigeons by tossing whole slices of bread on the ground and making bird noises, despite the lack of birds in the winter weather. Dwight tricks Phyllis into signing his apology letter by bribing a mailman to ask her to sign for a fake package. Michael returns to the office, where he roasts each of his co-workers with one-liners. Stanley laughs heartily when Michael roasts him, breaking the tension. Michael tells his employees that they are the reason he got into the paper business, and they applaud him.|$|E
