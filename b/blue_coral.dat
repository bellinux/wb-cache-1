5|$|Corals are {{classified}} in the class Anthozoa of the phylum Cnidaria. They are divided into three subclasses, Hexacorallia, Octocorallia, and Ceriantharia. The Hexacorallia include the stony corals, the sea anemones and the zoanthids. These groups have polyps that generally have 6-fold symmetry. The Octocorallia include <b>blue</b> <b>coral,</b> soft corals, sea pens, and gorgonians (sea fans and sea whips). These groups have polyps with 8-fold symmetry, each polyp having eight tentacles and eight mesenteries. Ceriantharia are the tube-dwelling anemones.|$|E

The entire skeleton, however, has an unusual blue color and therefore the species is commonly exploited for decorative uses.

50|$|Octocorallia is {{considered}} to be monophyletic, meaning that all contained species are descended from a common ancestor, but the relationships between subdivisions are not well known. The sea pens (Pennatulacea) and <b>blue</b> <b>coral</b> (Helioporacea) continue to be assigned separate orders, whereas the current order Alcyonacea was historically represented by four orders: Alcyonacea, Gorgonacea, Stolonifera and Telestacea.|$|E
50|$|Despite being {{common in}} some areas and having a large range, the <b>blue</b> <b>coral</b> has been given the {{conservation}} status of a vulnerable species by the IUCN. Its population is unknown but it {{is believed to be}} decreasing in line with the global destruction of coral reefs; it is threatened by aquarium harvesting, bleaching, habitat destruction, the acidification of oceans, and climate change. It is found in the eastern and western Indian Ocean, and the eastern central, western central, northwestern, and southwestern Pacific Ocean; its range includes the Great Barrier Reef, Australia, Japan and the Ryukyu Islands. Its largest colony is believed to be located off Ishigaki Island in the Yaeyama Islands, southwestern Japan. It is found in reefs with depths below 2 m, or reefs exposed to waves, flats, intertidal regions, and sometimes in marginal habitats. The <b>blue</b> <b>coral</b> is listed under CITES Appendixes I and II.|$|E
50|$|The <b>blue</b> <b>coral</b> is {{the only}} extant Octocoral with a massive skeleton, which is {{composed}} of fibrocrystalline aragonite (calcium carbonate). It is a hermatypic zooxanthellaete species with either blue or grey-grey polyps located within its skeleton, which each contain eight tentacles. Its colonies are either columnar, plates or branched. It is a tolerant species and is used in marine aquariums.|$|E
25|$|Increasing acidity has {{possibly}} harmful consequences, such as depressing metabolic {{rates in}} jumbo squid, depressing the immune responses of <b>blue</b> mussels, and <b>coral</b> bleaching.

(Gerard Morgan-Grenville) ] A few years ago I went to Indonesia to visit my brother who was living there. We went travelling across the Indonesian islands; a wonderful adventure seeing Komodo dragons, riding on horse-drawn carts, snorkelling off untourised islands, watching dolphins jump [...] One of my most vivid memories was crossing from one island to another on a local boat. There were quite a few bins which people diligently used. As we drew near to the shore, I leant {{over the side of the}} boat to take in the view: stunning white beach, clear <b>blue</b> <b>coralled</b> sea, coconut palms lining the beach and watched as, to my horror, the crew took all the bins and one-by-one tipped their contents into the sea!

50|$|The {{coral reef}} {{ecosystem}} forms {{part of the}} Coral Triangle region. In the park, 150 species of coral have been recorded, consisting of 15 families and distributed {{on the shores of}} 18 islands. Among these are colonies of <b>blue</b> <b>coral,</b> black coral, Leptoseris species, Mycedium elephantotus, and Alcyonacea or soft corals. The percentage of live coral coverage varies from between 30-40% to 64-65%.|$|E
50|$|<b>Blue</b> <b>coral</b> (Heliopora coerulea) is {{a species}} of colonial coral and the only species in the family Helioporidae and the only Octocoral known to produce a massive {{skeleton}}.

Individual polyps live in tubes within the skeleton and are connected by a thin layer of tissue over the outside of the skeleton. It was described by Pallas in 1766.|$|E

The hood scoops for this year were all painted matte black regardless {{of the color of}} the car. These cars also had a manual transmission and no AC was available, again due {{to the size of the}} engine. The Hurst Shifter was also standard equipment for this year. A dealer-installed option of a six-pack intake and carburetors was also made available; however very few of these were sold.|$|R

50|$|Atlantic <b>blue</b> tangs inhabit <b>coral</b> {{reefs and}} inshore grassy and rocky areas, {{where there is}} a high {{prevalence}} of algae. They are herbivorous, and their diet consists only of algae. They eat the algae from the reefs in which they reside, as well as off the bodies of surrounding fish. By eating the algae off of other fish, the blue tang serve as cleaners for them. With the decline in the Diadema antillarum (sea urchin) population, the blue tang population increased since the algal resources that the two animals usually competed for were more abundant.|$|R
