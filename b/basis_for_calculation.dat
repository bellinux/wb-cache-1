The consequence was that the <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> <b>calculation</b> of the date of Easter as decided {{in the fourth century}} had drifted from reality. The Gregorian calendar reform also dealt with the accumulated difference between these figures, between the years 325 and 1582 (1750 in the British Empire), by skipping 10 dates (11 {{in the case of the}} UK and her colonies) to restore the date of the vernal equinox to approximately March 21, the approximate date it occurred at the time of the First Council of Nicea in 325.|$|E
