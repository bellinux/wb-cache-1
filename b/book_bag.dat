500|$|In sixth grade, {{he went to}} {{live with}} his father {{full-time}} in Harvey, Illinois. His father lived next door to a crack house and taught Fiasco to use guns to defend himself from drug dealers. Despite his unstable upbringing, Fiasco states that he was well-educated as a child, asserting that his parents exposed him to a diverse array of subjects and that reading was highly encouraged in his household. [...] As a teenager, Fiasco participated in Academic Decathlon competitions. [...] His mother described him by saying, [...] "He was a great spirited child. Smart, a bit complex; he kind of was a loner; he didn't hang with a lot of people...He always had the glasses. [...] Always had a <b>book</b> <b>bag</b> over his shoulder and some type of a writing tablet." [...] Fiasco initially disliked hip hop music for its use of vulgarity, and preferred to listen to jazz; he idolized clarinet player Benny Goodman. [...] His struggle to learn to play an instrument led him to create poetry instead, which led to his interest in the lyrical aspects of music.|$|E

The research was carried out between September and December 2013.

What is the perceived impact of <b>Bag</b> <b>Books</b> from the perspectives of those using them/aware of them? What do users like and dislike about the products, and what suggestions do they have for improvement? The study identifies that <b>Bag</b> <b>Books</b> are used in a multiplicity of ways {{with a wide range of}} students across the whole range of special educational needs, in large groups, small groups and individually. Most storytelling sessions observed did not adhere to <b>Bag</b> <b>Books</b> guidelines. <b>Bag</b> <b>Books</b> are felt to be a helpful tool for supporting students’ learning, supporting the delivery of the curriculum – not only with regard to English but across subject areas – and supporting assessment.
