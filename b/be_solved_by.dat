5|$|After his acclamation, Maximian was {{dispatched}} {{to fight the}} rebel Bagaudae, insurgent peasants of Gaul. Diocletian returned to the East, progressing slowly. By 2 November, he had only reached Civitas Iovia (Botivo, near Ptuj, Slovenia). In the Balkans during the autumn of 285, he encountered a tribe of Sarmatians who demanded assistance. The Sarmatians requested that Diocletian either help them recover their lost lands or grant them pasturage rights within the empire. Diocletian refused and fought a battle with them, {{but was unable to}} secure a complete victory. The nomadic pressures of the European Plain remained and could not <b>be</b> <b>solved</b> <b>by</b> a single war; soon the Sarmatians would have to be fought again.|$|E

He opposed the International Commission of Control which believed that the problem could <b>be</b> <b>solved</b> <b>by</b> diplomatic means. The Prince and his cabinet accepted Essad Pasha's proposals for a military solution. Several thousand Italian rifles and Austrian machine and mountain guns were purchased and distributed to the (predominantly Muslim) population of central Albania. They believed that the new regime was a tool of the (Christian) Great Powers and the landowners that owned half of the arable land. On the basis of those beliefs they revolted.|$|E

He therefore argues that sex trafficking is a spiritual and moral issue that cannot <b>be</b> <b>solved</b> <b>by</b> education or money. In another interview, a man purchasing sex in Thailand says that he believes the girls are happy to be working as prostitutes. Another interview features an American man who had been a sex tourist in Asia.|$|E

This high-resolution structure of lysozyme {{marked the beginning of}} the field of structural biology and the effort to understand how enzymes work at an atomic level of detail.|$|E

5|$|The {{extension}} of Apollonius' problem to three dimensions, namely, {{the problem of}} finding a fifth sphere that is tangent to four given spheres, can <b>be</b> <b>solved</b> <b>by</b> analogous methods. For example, the given and solution spheres can be resized so that one given sphere is shrunk to point while maintaining tangency. Inversion in this point reduces Apollonius' problem to finding a plane that is tangent to three given spheres. There are in general eight such planes, which become the solutions to the original problem by reversing the inversion and the resizing. This problem was first considered by Pierre de Fermat, and many alternative solution methods have been developed over the centuries.|$|E
5|$|This {{equation}} can <b>be</b> <b>solved</b> <b>by</b> the Euclidean algorithm, {{as described}} above. Finding multiplicative inverses {{is an essential}} step in the RSA algorithm, which is widely used in electronic commerce; specifically, the equation determines the integer used to decrypt the message. Note that although the RSA algorithm uses rings rather than fields, the Euclidean algorithm can still be used to find a multiplicative inverse where one exists. The Euclidean algorithm also has other applications in error-correcting codes; for example, {{it can be used}} {{as an alternative to the}} Berlekamp–Massey algorithm for decoding BCH and Reed–Solomon codes, which are based on Galois fields.|$|E
5|$|By age 11, he had {{exhausted}} {{the mathematical}} knowledge of two {{college students who}} were lodgers at his home. He was later lent a book by S. L. Loney on advanced trigonometry. He mastered this {{by the age of}} 13 while discovering sophisticated theorems on his own. By 14, he was receiving merit certificates and academic awards that continued throughout his school career, and he assisted the school in the logistics of assigning its 1200 students (each with differing needs) to its 35-odd teachers. He completed mathematical exams in half the allotted time, and showed a familiarity with geometry and infinite series. Ramanujan was shown how to solve cubic equations in 1902; he developed his own method to solve the quartic. The following year, Ramanujan tried to solve the quintic, not knowing that it could not <b>be</b> <b>solved</b> <b>by</b> radicals.|$|E

5|$|The convoy {{carrying}} the battalion put into Fremantle in mid-February, where {{the small number}} of Western Australian personnel disembarked to begin their home leave. The rest of the battalion continued on to Port Melbourne, before moving to Adelaide by rail. In late March, after the South Australian personnel had completed their leave, the battalion was re-constituted. At that time, a series of parades were held in every Australian capital city to welcome home the 9th Division; the 2/48th marched through Adelaide. After this, the 2/48th were transported to the Atherton Tablelands in Queensland, where they established a camp on the Barron River, near Kairi. In April 1943, the battalion was re-organised and re-trained for jungle operations in the South-West Pacific theatre in order to prepare it for the conditions in New Guinea. Undertaking training on the Tablelands, the battalion was converted to the tropical establishment. Warfare in the Pacific posed unique problems and differed greatly to that which the 2/48th had experienced in North Africa. In the jungles of New Guinea logistics and transport were significant challenges and in order to meet them, the battalion's size was reduced by over 100 men, to around 800, as its anti-aircraft and Bren carrier platoons were disbanded, while each of the battalion's four rifle companies lost most of their organic motor transport; the mobility issue would <b>be</b> <b>solved</b> <b>by</b> marching on foot as vehicles were relatively useless in dense jungle, while supplies would be brought up using native carriers as well as by air. In July 1943, the battalion moved to Cairns where they undertook amphibious training with the American 532nd Engineer Boat and Shore Regiment around Trinity Beach as part of their final preparations before being committed to the fighting in New Guinea.|$|E
