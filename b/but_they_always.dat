Young and female yellowhammers can be distinguished from cirl buntings by the grey-brown rump of the latter species. Male hybrids with pine bunting are typically white-faced and have some yellow on the head, underparts or flight feathers, but females are usually indistinguishable from yellowhammers.|$|E
25|$|The British {{granted the}} Palestinian Arabs a {{religious}} leadership, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>always</b> kept it dependent. The office of Mufti of Jerusalem, traditionally limited in authority and geographical scope, was refashioned into that of Grand Mufti of Palestine. Furthermore, a Supreme Muslim Council (SMC) was established and given various duties like {{the administration of}} religious endowments and the appointment of religious judges and local muftis. In Ottoman times these duties had been fulfilled by the bureaucracy in Istanbul.|$|E
25|$|The Germans {{operated}} {{parochial schools}} primarily {{to maintain their}} religious faith; often they offered only an hour of German language instruction a week, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>always</b> had extensive coverage of religion. Most German Catholic children by 1910 attended schools taught entirely in English. In the 199x–1930 era, German Catholics generally voted for the Liberal ticket (rather than the Provincial Rights and Conservative tickets), seeing Liberals as more willing to protect religious minorities. Occasionally they voted for Conservatives or independent candidates who offered greater support for public funding of parochial schools. Nazi Germany made a systematic effort to proselytize among Saskatchewan's Germans in the 1930s. Fewer that 1% endorsed their message, but some did migrate back to Germany before anti-Nazi sentiment became overwhelming in 1939.|$|E

The classic counting system of pinochle is where aces are worth 11, tens are worth 10, kings are worth four, queens are worth three, jacks are worth two, and nines are worth zero. This method takes longer to count the score {{at the end of each}} hand. A simpler method is to count aces and tens for 10 points, kings and queens for five points, and jacks and nines are worth zero.|$|E
25|$|Some though do show huge promise, intelligence, {{and have}} {{extremely}} useful skills, many top {{scientists and engineers}} are not Judges. Most of the cities biggest advancements {{in areas such as}} food, new materials, non weapon or military technology, medicine and architecture and construction design (including the Halls of Justice) came from ordinary citizens. All the major businesses and entertainment (apart from Justice Department propaganda channels) figures are citizens as are a lot of the city's diplomats, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>always</b> report to a Judge before making any decisions. But not all valued skills are the same as the real world ones, examples of this are human taxidermy and professional gluttony. Most of the highly intelligent citizens end up in crime such as PJ Maybe, and Nero Narcos, as they are very limited in the wealth or power they can attain (the amount of real power a citizen can gain though is very limited) legally.|$|E

Her relationship with Lilly occasionally suffers the occasional setback, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>always</b> make up. In the episode 'What I Don't Like About You', Miley is asked to choose a side between a fight Lilly and Oliver had. But Miley, showing what a kind friend she was, made a mini-Indiana Joannie movie, which made Lilly and Oliver forgive each other. Miley's relationship with her brother Jackson is often hostile. The two siblings constantly fight and trash talk each other. However, in a few private conversations, both Miley and Jackson say that they love and appreciate each other, but they are both unwilling to admit this in public.|$|E

25|$|After {{the first}} World War the carpets {{started to be}} {{produced}} for the general market using popular designs and colourways <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>always</b> remained at the luxury end of the general market. The growing middle class {{of the twentieth century}} aspired to acquire a Wilton carpet for their 'best' room. Despite the impact of industrialization, the areas where Brussels Wilton carpets were produced remained centred mainly in the Midlands around the towns of Wilton and Kidderminster and in West Yorkshire where the firm of John Crossley and Sons in Halifax became synonymous with carpet manufacture. There were smaller areas of manufacture in Scotland and Durham. With the development of different manufacturing methods and looms capable of the mass production of carpets, the public began change their décor, including carpets, on a regular basis, which increased the demand for carpets. The last quarter of the 20th century saw the rapid decline of the labour-intensive Brussels Wilton carpets. Very few of the original ¾ Wilton looms still exist and the few that do are either in museums or used by small manufacturers that continue to produce bespoke (custom-made) luxury carpets for the elite and to replace carpets in historic buildings in the UK and abroad.|$|E
25|$|Sting {{returned}} to singles matches in 1989, starting the year off by wrestling Flair to a one-hour draw in Atlanta's Omni on New Year's Day. He {{would also have}} his first experience in Japan with a brief tour in All Japan Pro Wrestling, with his most notable match in AJPW against Dan Spivey on January 25. After a long push, Sting won his first title in the NWA when he defeated Rotundo for the NWA Television Championship at a live event in March. Sting defended the Television title actively but tended to face sub-par challengers such as The Iron Sheik. In mid-1989, The Great Muta challenged Sting at The Great American Bash. The match was booked with a classic, controversial Dusty finish even though Rhodes (the namesake of the technique) had been fired months earlier. Sting got the three-count and was announced as the winner, but a replay showed Muta's shoulder was up at the count of two. The NWA decided to declare the title vacant. Sting and Muta battled in many rematches for the vacant Television title, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>always</b> ended in disqualification, giving neither man the championship. Eventually, Muta won a No Disqualification match against Sting at a live event in September by using a blackjack to get the win and the title.|$|E

Which could have been overlooked if there was any depth in their angst, but these two seem like spoilt kids playing suicide-suicide." [...] Rajeev Masand of CNN-News18 panned the film, calling it [...] "deathly boring [...] a challenge to sit through for two reasons in particular– the film has no script to speak of, and the characters are hard to sympathize with.

500|$|The {{animation}} {{techniques for}} the characters {{were based on}} previous Spider-Man games, films and comics. Characters were designed to be balanced and, with this in mind, the production team tried to implement similar abilities for the Spider-Men and Spider-Women, despite giving them different skills. Originally, Marvel only allowed the staff to use 30 characters, but the developers felt it was limited—only having 1 female character, for example—and requested more variety. Requests on their forums, Facebook page, subreddit, and Twitch.tv were also considered, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>always</b> focus on thematic releases; for example, [...] "Monster Spiders" [...] (Spider-X and Tarantula) or dimensional variations of Spider-Man. Since {{the inception of the}} game, the production team planned to add a character with a level cap higher than 100 as they imagined players would eventually master all the available characters. This resulted {{in the creation of the}} [...] "Titan" [...] characters to expand the game replay value. To avoid overpowering them and reducing other characters' value, however, they made Titans difficult to acquire.|$|E

Music writer Jeff Weiss of Pitchfork describes the [...] "enduring image" [...] often associated with Nas's narrated stream of consciousness: [...] " [...] baby-faced Buddha monk in public housing, scribbling lotto dreams and grim reaper nightmares in dollar notebooks, words enjambed in the margins. The only light is the orange glow of a blunt, bodega liquor, and the adolescent rush of first creation. Sometimes his pen taps the paper and his brain blanks. In the next sentence, he remembers dark streets and the noose."

500|$|Coming Up to Breathe {{received}} positive reception {{from music}} critics. Steve Losey of Allmusic gave the album {{four out of}} five stars, saying [...] "In a concerted effort to revert back to the days when they were more a rock band and less of a hitmaking machine, MercyMe delivers. While it's certainly not heavy metal, the songs definitely keep driving forward. Guitars are more prominent and production leans on a more earthy formula... MercyMe is able to rock on portions of each song <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>always</b> bring it back to a memorable chorus or a hooky verse. That's the formula that has always worked for them, and it does here, too". Deborah Evans Price of Billboard noted that [...] "For the most part, MercyMe has built a multiplatinum foundation on compelling power ballads. But on this set, the Texas band rocks out with passion and edgy intensity. It doesn't stray so far that it would alienate the faithful, but it delivers a powerful collection of pop/rock that should take the band's career to a new level". She also praised Millard's vocals and called it a [...] "landmark album in an already impressive career". Mark Joseph of CCM Magazine gave the album a B-; he called the album [...] "enjoyable" [...] but suggesting that a stronger producer or A team would have resulted in better lyrics. Tony Cummings of Cross Rhythms gave the album nine out of ten stars, praising the vocals and string arrangements as well as the choir on [...] "Bring the Rain".

For comparison, the corps had 219 BT tanks. The situation with the T-26 remained as before in July 1939: the 1st Army Group, which participated in the Battle of Khalkhin Gol in Mongolia, had only 14 T-26s (in the 82nd Rifle Division) and 10 KhT-26 flame-throwing tanks (in the 11th Tank Brigade).
