5|$|To {{make the}} boot loader {{appealing}} to other operating system developers, Apple added features to allow {{flexibility in the}} booting process such as network boot using TFTP and load Mach-O and ELF formatted kernels. BootX can also boot from HFS, HFS+, UFS and ext2 formatted volumes. The boot loader can be manipulated at startup <b>by</b> <b>holding</b> down various key combinations to alter the booting process. Such functions include Verbose Mode, achieved <b>by</b> <b>holding</b> down the Command and V key at startup, which replaces the default Apple logo with text-based information on the boot process and Single User Mode, achieved <b>by</b> <b>holding</b> down the Command and S, which, depending on the operating system, may boot into a more basic command-line or text-based version of the operating system, to facilitate maintenance and recovery action. The ROM can also be set to require a password to access these technical functions using the OpenFirmware interface.|$|E
