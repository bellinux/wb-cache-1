40|$|May 1 st 2012, this {{is going}} to be my last news-letter for the Oracle before Mohsen Hamoudia takes over in May. It is always sad to say good-bye even if it is only a simple change of roles. These last four years as President have been an {{extraordinary}} period of my life. They <b>brought</b> <b>me</b> the <b>opportunity</b> to represent the Institute in many international meetings, to work with my fellow Board members in designing and monitor-ing our scientific and professional policies, and to get in closer contact with many individual mem-bers and share their ideas and worries. I must say that, in all instances, I have always felt sup-ported by both the Board and by my fellow members. All of them have made my work eas...|$|R
500|$|Stalmaster {{convinced}} Donner and Ilya to have Reeve screen test in February 1977. Reeve {{stunned the}} director and producers, but {{he was told to}} wear a [...] "muscle suit" [...] to produce the desired muscular physique. Reeve refused, undertaking a strict physical exercise regime headed by David Prowse. Prowse had wanted to portray Superman, but was denied an audition by the filmmakers because he was not American. Prowse also auditioned for Non. Reeve went from 188 to 212 pounds during pre-production and filming. Reeve was paid a mere $250,000 for both Superman and Superman II, while his veteran co-stars received huge sums of money: $3.7 million for Brando and $2 million for Hackman for Superman I. However, Reeve felt, [...] "'Superman' <b>brought</b> <b>me</b> many <b>opportunities,</b> rather than closing a door in my face." [...] Jeff East portrays teenage Clark Kent. East's lines were overdubbed by Reeve during post-production. [...] "I was not happy about it because the producers never told me what they had in mind," [...] East commented. [...] "It was done without my permission {{but it turned out to}} be okay. Chris did a good job but it caused tension between us. We resolved our issues with each other years later." [...] East also tore several thigh muscles when performing the stunt of racing alongside the train. He applied 3 to 4 hours of prosthetic makeup daily to facially resemble Reeve.|$|R

"I think I’m {{a strange}} natured man - or maybe I {{was too young}} to realize the facts can we passed - because the agonies I have passed, did not traumatized me for a lifetime, as {{happened}} to many other survivors. We have passed through terrible agonies, dressed only in shirt, we have worked for months, in a cold of minus twenty degrees. (...) I was the only survivor of a consignment of 1,500 people. I’ve got sick. (...) I got twenty-five strokes whose bloody traces were infected. I was operated several times, without any anaesthesia and medicine. But it's quite possible that I have survived just because of that. It <b>brought</b> <b>me</b> the <b>opportunity</b> to spend the whole winter wrapped on a hospital bed. I had already left with sequelae of malnutrition. I can say that before the release, I was practically laying next to dead men, just like the old age end weakenings. Half-aware, I have heard - or maybe I just thought I have heard - that doctors disagreed over my fate: Does we give him the last drop of vitamin-C? Its no use, he anyway dies. Then I heard another voice: - He is the youngest, let’s manage him... And then I’ve got the secret portion of vitamin -C mixed with Salvarsan and bizmut. That 's how I survived. (...) I tried to find my rescuer long time afret the war, but in vane. (...)After a few years I returned to Ebensee. The ruins of the camp were rested, while there were built a coluple of flats next to them. I felt strange seeing that huge houses very next to the place where countless people had been destroyed." ...|$|R

60|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{the fashion of}} the time renders {{whatever}} is forward, coarse, or senseless, in feminine nature, too palpable to all men:- the weak picturesqueness of my earlier writings <b>brought</b> <b>me</b> acquainted with much of their emptiest enthusiasm; and the chances of later life gave <b>me</b> <b>opportunities</b> of watching women in states of degradation and vindictiveness which opened to me the gloomiest secrets of Greek and Syrian tragedy. I have seen them betray their household charities to lust, their pledged love to devotion; I have seen mothers dutiful to their children, as Medea; and children dutiful to their parents, {{as the daughter of}} Herodias: but my trust is still unmoved in the preciousness of the natures that are so fatal in their error, and I leave the words of the 'Lilies' unchanged; believing, yet, that no man ever lived a right life who had not been chastened by a woman's love, strengthened by her courage, and guided by her discretion.|$|R
