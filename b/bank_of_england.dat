5|$|The notes had 150 minor marks that {{acted as}} {{security}} measures to identify forgeries. These were often {{assumed to be}} printing errors, and were changed between issues of notes. Each note bore an alphanumeric serial designation and the signature of the Chief Cashier of the <b>Bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>England.</b> Prior {{to the release of}} any notes by the <b>Bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>England,</b> all serial numbers were recorded in ledgers so the bank could verify its liabilities; these numbers were checked when the notes circulated back through the bank.|$|E
5|$|As Shadow Chancellor, Brown as Chancellor-in-waiting {{was seen}} as a good choice by {{business}} and the middle class.

5|$|There {{were six}} protests on 1 April 2009: a {{security}} operation at ExCeL London, a Stop the War march, a Free Tibet protest outside the Chinese Embassy, a People & Planet protest, a Climate Camp protest, and a protest outside the <b>Bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>England.</b> Over 4,000 protesters {{were at the}} Climate Camp and the same number at the <b>Bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>England.</b> On 1 April over 5,500 police officers were deployed and the following day 2,800, {{at a cost of}} £7.2 million. Officers worked 14-hour shifts. They ended at midnight, slept on the floor of police stations, were not given a chance to eat, and were back on duty at 7 am. This was viewed as having contributed to the difficulties they faced.|$|E

5|$|Economists have {{referred}} to the onset of World War I {{as the end of}} an age of innocence for foreign exchange markets, as it was the first geopolitical conflict to have a destabilizing and paralyzing impact. The United Kingdom declared war on Germany on August 4, 1914 following Germany's invasion of France and Belgium. In the weeks prior, the foreign exchange market in London was the first to exhibit distress. European tensions and increasing political uncertainty motivated investors to chase liquidity, prompting commercial banks to borrow heavily from London's discount market. As the money market tightened, discount lenders began rediscounting their reserves at the <b>Bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>England</b> rather than discounting new pounds sterling. The <b>Bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>England</b> was forced to raise discount rates daily for three days from 3% on July 30 to 10% by August 1. As foreign investors resorted to buying pounds for remittance to London just to pay off their newly maturing securities, the sudden demand for pounds led the pound to appreciate beyond its gold value against most major currencies, yet sharply depreciate against the French franc after French banks began liquidating their London accounts. Remittance to London became increasingly difficult and culminated in a record exchange rate of $6.50 USD/GBP. Emergency measures were introduced in the form of moratoria and extended bank holidays, but to no effect as financial contracts became informally unable to be negotiated and export embargoes thwarted gold shipments. A week later, the <b>Bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>England</b> began to address the deadlock in the foreign exchange markets by establishing a new channel for transatlantic payments whereby participants could make remittance payments to the U.K. by depositing gold designated for a <b>Bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>England</b> account with Canada's Minister of Finance, and in exchange receive pounds sterling at an exchange rate of $4.90. Approximately $104 million USD in remittances flowed through this channel in the next two months. However, pound sterling liquidity ultimately did not improve due to inadequate relief for merchant banks receiving sterling bills. As the pound sterling was the world's reserve currency and leading vehicle currency, market illiquidity and merchant banks' hesitance to accept sterling bills left currency markets paralyzed.|$|E
