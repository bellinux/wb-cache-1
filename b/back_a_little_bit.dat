500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "We Ride" [...] was filmed in Miami and the Florida Keys in August 2006. It was {{directed}} by Anthony Mandler, {{the director of the}} previous single's video, [...] "Unfaithful". In an interview with Corey Moss of MTV, Rihanna explained the concept behind the inspiration for the video, saying, [...] "We just wanted to reconnect with my peers, let them know I'm still a teen, I still have friends– but to make something provocative. The '' and 'Unfaithful' [...] were so out there, so we pulled it <b>back</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit.</b> I'm chilling with my girls some." [...] The singer continued to talk about the choreographic content, saying, [...] "I'm dancing , like technical dance, which was a challenge... It usually takes years to learn, but we got it done in a few days. And it was beautifully shot." [...] The video was released to download via iTunes on September 18, 2006 in Ireland and September 20, 2006 in the United States.|$|E
500|$|... "I'm Goin' Down" [...] {{features}} an energetic rhythm, propelled by a heavy drumbeat by Weinberg, and contains a saxophone solo by Clemons. The music has a basic chord progression of A–E–F#m–D. In concerts in 1984, Springsteen introduced the song by describing the diminishing intimacy and sexual activity {{that can occur}} {{over the course of}} a romantic relationship: [...] " [...] you're making love to 'em all the time, three or four times a day. Then you come <b>back</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> later, and, uh-oh... it's like 'Are you gonna make love to me tonight, or are we gonna wait for the full moon again', y'know?" [...] The song's lyrics include lines such as [...] "I'm sick and tired of you setting me up / Setting me up just to knock-a knock-a knock-a me down" [...] and [...] "You used to love to drive me wild / But lately girl you get your kicks from just driving me down". The lyrics later turn into a stream of gibberish syllables.|$|E

5000|$|While Douglass' laugh track {{had been}} boiterous and hearty, Pratt's laugh track was more subtle and subdued, {{reflecting}} {{a shift in}} the mindset of viewing audiences. Pratt commented, [...] "A joke is a joke, but I've noticed that the public is more sophisticated now. They don't seem to be hand-fed {{as they were in the}} early days. Now, we take the light approach as far as trying to drive home a joke with audience reaction.

5000|$|According to Attila, {{the band}} {{wanted to make}} an album that [...] "sounded like Mayhem." [...] He said that [...] "After the Ordo album, which was <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> progressive—maybe <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> too much—almost like a fusion album where riffs were not {{repeated}} and the rhythm was always out or different or kind of twisted, {{we wanted to go}} back from there instead of going forward in that direction. Every Mayhem album has a kind of unique aspect, but we wanted to go <b>back</b> to <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> more traditional extreme metal. Of course, there’s all these elements that Mayhem has built up for itself as a band, but we still {{wanted to go back to}} something that was straightforward musically and <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more brutal and more like extreme metal." ...|$|R
500|$|The {{top three}} drivers {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and in a later press conference. When asked about how he performed his comeback, di Grassi {{said he did not}} know but praised his mechanics for their work. He stated that the race showed that Formula E could switch to [...] "Heaven to Hell in one go", and felt if the third safety car period had not intervened, he could have managed his advantage over Vergne. He also revealed that on three occasions during the race, he believed that the possibility of him securing the victory had ended. Vergne, who finished in second, had mixed emotions, feeling that the victory was in his grasp but was happy that he secured a place on the podium and was in contention for the championship: [...] "We started very far away but I know I’m in the right team with the right car to win the championship. I think we’re coming <b>back</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> better and we’re getting stronger every race as a team." [...] Third-place finisher Bird said that it was [...] "a good race" [...] for everyone who watched the event on television and the sport. He felt the action observed in the race was positive for the series. Bird also said he was happy with the passing manoeuvre he performed on d'Ambrosio and reserved praise for his team.|$|E
2500|$|Joey Logano {{took the}} lead with 44 laps to go and had to hold off a late race charge by Brad Keselowski to score his third win of the 2014 season.

[...] "Joey just ran a great race and we were really strong in that {{midsection}} and ... we got it <b>back</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> on that last run," [...] Keselowski said. [...] "Our car was just about equal to Joey's but he just had better track position than on us." ...|$|E
2500|$|Comic Jumper was {{revealed}} on September 4, 2009 at PAX. Joystiq interviewed Twisted Pixel's Mike Wilford who cited Final Fight as {{an inspiration for}} melee combat, while Contra and Gunstar Heroes served as inspirations for gun sequences, and said the humor as akin to Earthworm Jim. Wilford further stated [...] "Back in the day, {{there seemed to be}} a whole lot of mascot-type characters in games, like Mario, Sonic, all those things, and not many devs seem to be doing that anymore. We're trying to bring that <b>back</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> with our games." [...] Comic Jumper is the brainchild of Josh Bear, co-founder and director at Twisted Pixel. [...] Wilford stated that Bear had the idea for the game beginning in seventh grade. It was released for the Xbox 360 via the Xbox Live Arcade Marketplace on October 6, 2010 as part of Microsoft's Game Feast promotion.|$|E

So she had to be satisfied. But she said she'd set up for him a while anyway, and keep a light burning so he could see it.|$|R
5000|$|Sigismondi watched {{films from}} {{and set in}} the 1970s in {{developing}} the visual style of the film. [...] "I {{wanted to keep it}} very raw, so I shot on Super-16 and kept it kind of smoky. The color palette was designed to be <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more California Valley colors in the beginning and tougher and harder-looking near the end, sort of void of color. Japan's looking sort of trippy and metallic, and when they come <b>back</b> everything looks <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> different." ...|$|R
5000|$|Valentino Rossi said he {{is looking}} forward to {{renewing}} his rivalry with the former foe... “I am sorry I didn't see Sete on the track when we tested in Valencia because I think it's quite a big emotion for us to be together on the track again after all our great battles. I am happy to see him <b>back.</b> We spoke <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> in the summer when he was thinking about coming back and I’m looking forward to racing him again.” ...|$|R
60|$|So Tommy and Elspeth, {{holding each}} other's hands, took the short cut {{and they came}} {{to the far end of}} Caddam, and Elspeth thought they had better say it here before the cart came; but Tommy said he would walk back with her through the wood as far as the Toom Well, and they could say it there. They tried to say it at the Well, but--Elspeth was still with him when he {{returned}} to the far corner of Caddam, where the cart was now awaiting him. The carter was sitting on the shaft, and he told them he was in no hurry, and what is more, he had the delicacy to turn his back on them and struck his horse with the reins for looking round at the sorrowful pair. They should have said it now, but first Tommy walked <b>back</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of the way with Elspeth, and then she came back with him, and that was to be the last time, but he could not leave her, and so, there they were in the wood, looking woefully at each other, and it was not said yet.|$|E
5000|$|Murjani Rawls of Mind Equals Blown {{described}} the song as [...] "particularly upbeat, even {{going into a}} pop realm."

5000|$|The race {{restarted}} on lap 66. Carl Edwards {{tapped the}} back of Dale Earnhardt, Jr., got him loose and sent him into the wall on lap 70. Eventually, Earnhardt cut down his right-front tire, rode the wall and brought out the fourth caution of the race on lap 75. Speaking on the incident, he said that Edwards [...] "got a great run on us and drove down into one and got in the <b>back</b> of us <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit.</b> I don’t know if I cut him off or not. But he drove in there pretty hard and ran over the left rear quarter panel {{of the car and}} got in the fence." [...] Joey Logano opted not to pit under the caution and assumed the lead.|$|R
5000|$|Busch said {{afterwards}} {{that his}} [...] "Toyota was awesome today, {{it was just}} so fast and able to get out front and stay out front. Not even some of my teammates could challenge. This was hooked up and on rails.” “The repeat-ability there was something I wasn’t looking forward to,” Busch added. “I certainly didn’t want one, let alone (four) of them. You never know {{what is going to happen}} on those restarts. There’s a lot of gamesmanship that kind of gets played, and there was <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of <b>back</b> and forth <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> with the guys in the different grooves. I think I had Kenseth to my outside. I had Truex to my outside. I think I had Carl to my outside and then Joey Logano to my outside, so there were a lot of different characters that we had to deal with on the restarts. But I always felt like I could hit my marks and set sail each time.” ...|$|R

However, in the Zippo 200 at The Glen, Ambrose won his third straight Watkins Glen he held off Joey Logano and Kevin Harvick to win. Since the win, he started to gain some form, recording a top 10 at Atlanta and a top 5 at Richmond. At the Toyota/Save Mart 350 at Sonoma, Ambrose led 35 laps, and held a ten-second lead over Jimmie Johnson. His lead got erased by a caution on lap 104. During the caution, Ambrose turned off his car's engine to conserve fuel, {{but was unable to}} restart it. As a result, Ambrose attempted to return to his spot, but was forced to fall to seventh on the restart due to not maintaining a particular speed during the caution, and finished sixth. After the race, Ambrose stated, [...] "I was leading the race and had trouble getting the motor cranked <b>back</b> up <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> there, and NASCAR made the call.

5000|$|Carroll Pratt {{confirmed}} Douglass's {{comments in}} a June 2002 {{interview with the}} Archive of American Television, saying that producers regularly wanted louder, longer laughs: [...] "In the beginning, it was terrible! It {{got to be a}} point where the more you laugh, the louder you laugh, the funnier the joke was. And that wasn't so. And that's why the press, the media, the public in general came down on laughs at all: it was just too much. And there are still shows that are required to do that, but now less is better. I think less in enthusiasm, perhaps, but not less in volume. It's been tried by some producers and some shows to lessen the volume until it was a whisper and that becomes a bigger irritation than having it too loud.

The other party, I’ll call them "meaning philosophers", agrees about the oddity but insists that the examples are still obviously examples of knowledge or of knowing and that what we say in those examples, fishy or not, is still true.
