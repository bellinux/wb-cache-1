25|$|American {{television}} broadcasting {{at the time}} consisted {{of a variety of}} markets {{in a wide range of}} sizes, each competing for programming and dominance with separate technology, until deals were made and standards agreed upon in 1941. RCA, for example, used only Iconoscopes in the New York area, but Farnsworth Image Dissectors in Philadelphia and San Francisco. In September 1939, RCA agreed to pay the Farnsworth Television and Radio Corporation royalties over the next ten years for access to Farnsworth's patents.

The dancers in the video were not instructed to dance in any particular way by Yemi A.D. {{who was in charge of}} the dance choreography; and according to Ruth Hogben, they [...] "wanted an interpretation of how they felt about the song to be portrayed instead."

500|$|There {{were about}} an {{estimated}} 15–20,000 mature sarus cranes {{left in the}} wild in 2009. The Indian population is less than 10,000, but of the three subspecies, is the healthiest in terms of numbers. They are considered sacred and the birds are traditionally left unharmed, and in many areas they are unafraid of humans. They used to be found on occasion in Pakistan, but have not been seen there since the late 1980s. The population in India has however declined. Estimates of the global population suggest that the population in 2000 was at <b>best</b> <b>about</b> 10% and at the worst just 2.5% of the numbers that existed in 1850. Many farmers in India believe that these cranes damage standing crops, particularly rice, although studies show that direct feeding on rice grains resulted in losses amounting to {{less than one percent}} and trampling could account for grain loss of about [...] The attitude of farmers tends to be positive in spite of these damages, and this has helped in conserving the species within agricultural areas. The role of rice paddies may be particularly important for the birds' conservation, since natural wetlands are increasingly threatened by human activity. The conversion of wetlands to farmland, and farmland to more urban uses are major causes for habitat loss and long-term population decline. Compensating farmers for crop losses has been suggested as a measure that may help. The Australian population is greater than 5,000 birds and may be increasing, however, the Southeast Asian population has been decimated by war and habitat change (such as intensive agriculture, deforestation, and draining of wetlands) and by the mid-20th century had disappeared from large parts of its range which once stretched up to southern China; some 1500–2000 birds are left in several fragmented subpopulations. Payment to locals to guard nests and help increase breeding success has been attempted in northern Cambodia. Nest success of protected nests was significantly higher than that of unprotected nests, and positive population-level impacts were apparent. However, the program also caused local jealousies leading to deliberate disturbance of nests, and did nothing to alleviate larger-scale and more permanent threats due to habitat losses leading to the conclusion that such payment-for-conservation programs are at best a short-term complement, and not a substitute, to more permanent interventions that include habitat preservation. The little-known Philippine population became extinct in the late 1960s.|$|E

Herman also said he would start Demeter at first base for a few days should rookie first baseman George Scott need any sort of rest.|$|E

2500|$|The Franco-Israeli {{historian}} Saul Friedländer described The Foundations-with its {{theory of}} two [...] "pure" [...] races {{left in the}} world, namely the German and Jewish locked into a war for world domination which could only end with the complete victory of one over the other-as {{one of the key}} texts of [...] "redemptive anti-semitism". Because Chamberlain viewed Jews as a race, not a religion, Chamberlain argued the conversion of Jews was not a [...] "solution" [...] to the [...] "Jewish Question", stating Jewish converts to Christianity were still Jews. In taking this stance, Chamberlain was going beyond his hero Wagner. The Dutch journalist Ian Buruma wrote:Wagner himself, like Luther, still believed that a Jew could, as he put it with his customary charm, [...] "annihilate" [...] his Jewishness by repudiating his ancestry, converting and worshiping at the shrine of Bayreuth. So in theory a Jew could be a German…But to the mystical chauvinists, like Chamberlain, who took a tribal view of Germanness, even radical, Wagnerian assimilation could never be enough: the Jew was an alien virus to be purged from the national bloodstream. The more a Jew took on the habits and thoughts of his gentile compatriots, the more he was to be feared. Chamberlain did not advocate the extermination of Jews in The Foundations, indeed despite his determination to blame all of the world's problems on the Jews, Chamberlain never proposed a solution to this perceived problem. Instead Chamberlain made the cryptic statement that after reading his book, his readers would know <b>best</b> <b>about</b> how to devise a [...] "solution" [...] to the [...] "Jewish Question". Friedländer has argued that if one were to seriously take up the theories of [...] "redemptive anti-semitism" [...] proposed in The Foundations, and push them to their logical conclusion, then inevitably one would reach the conclusion that genocide might be a perfectly acceptable [...] "solution" [...] to the [...] "Jewish Question". Friedländer argued that there is an implied genocidal logic to The Foundations as Chamberlain argued that Jews were a race apart from the rest of humanity; that evil was embedded within the genes of the Jews, and so the Jews were born evil and remained evil until they died, indeed a Jew could never stop being evil even if he or she wanted to; and that for these biological reasons alone, the Jews would never cease their endless attempts to destroy all that was good within the world. Inspired by The Foundations, one völkisch writer Josef Remier published Ein Pangermanisches Deutschland in 1905, which used The Foundations to advocate that Germany conquer the Russian Empire, after which special commissions of doctors, anthropologists and [...] "breeding experts" [...] were to divide the population into three categories; ethnic Germans, those capable of being [...] "Germanized" [...] and those incapable of [...] "improvement" [...] with all Slavs and Jews being included in the last category.
