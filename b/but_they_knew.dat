5|$|By 1980, the {{authorities}} {{had no choice}} but to make another attempt to raise consumer prices to realistic levels, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> that doing so would likely spark another worker rebellion. Western bankers providing loans to the Polish government at a meeting at the Bank Handlowy in Warsaw on 1 July 1980 made it clear that low prices of consumer goods could no longer be subsidized by the state. The government gave in and on 1 July announced a system of gradual but continuous price rises, particularly for meat. A wave of strikes and factory occupations began at once, with the biggest ones taking place in Lublin in July 1980.|$|E

The Urban Affairs Committee guided the Chamber’s urban program which set about trying to address problems identified by the Dirty Dozen. Lowe was a member of this committee. It became clear to the committee that solving social problems would require involvement from more people and a more representative group of people, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> minorities would never participate in an organization controlled by the Chamber of Commerce.|$|E

Thompson was chosen according to Spotnitz because he had a very [...] "distinctive look" [...] about him, most notably his face and mouth. After casting him, they told Thompson's agent that Thompson needed a hair cut, because at the start the Alien Bounty Hunter {{was supposed to be a}} kind of military pilot who'd been shot down. But when the day came that Thompson came to Vancouver, there had been some [...] "misunderstanding" [...] and he hadn't been told of the [...] "crewcut", so the hairstyle seen in this episode was a [...] "compromise" [...] of sorts.|$|E
500|$|During the {{production}} of the season, Duchovny asked Carter [...] "wouldn't it be great if we had like an alien bounty hunter?" [...] Carter was positive towards the idea and acted upon it, creating with Spotniz the character of the Alien Bounty Hunter for the two-part episodes [...] "Colony" [...] and [...] "End Game". Actor Brian Thompson auditioned for the role in a casting session, where he was competing with another actor. Spotnitz and Carter did not have much time to cast the character, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> this casting would be important since they intended the character to become a recurring character. Thompson was chosen according to Spotnitz because he had a very [...] "distinctive look" [...] about him, most notably his face and mouth. Megan Leitch also appeared in [...] "Colony" [...] and [...] "End Game" [...] as a grown-up clone version of Samantha Mulder, and would return to play Samantha or one of her clones over the other seasons. Carter did not want it to be the real Samantha, since that would have been [...] "straight science fiction" [...] and it was too [...] "ridiculous" [...] to give too many answers. Darren McGavin, star of , was sought out for the part of Senator Matheson in [...] "Little Green Men" [...] and Mulder's father in [...] "Colony" [...] and [...] "End Game", but the roles went to Raymond J. Barry and Peter Donat respectively, while McGavin agreed to play X-Files founder Arthur Dales in season five.|$|E

He also planned a grassroots marketing {{strategy for the}} record, which evolved from his difficulty with Columbia executives to promote the album and their idea of issuing its songs as vinyl records. He felt that [...] "nobody at the label knew" [...] him {{in an interview with}} The Dallas Morning News: [...] "They had this record that I turned in that sounded like a '60s record. 'What the hell do we do with this record?' It was quality. There was not a lot of marketing and promotion, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> I had the credibility so you don't just throw it in the garbage ... I don't mind being a [...] because that's actually a better road to take. I have to go in one more time and prove myself again because I am starting over again." [...] In the week leading up to its release, Saadiq made promotional appearances at V-103's For Sisters Only, the International Soul Music Summit, and the Uptown Restaurant & Lounge in Atlanta. He also performed songs from the album on VH1 Soulstage. Columbia released the album both on CD and as a collector's edition box set with 7-inch vinyl singles. In the United Kingdom, it was issued with two bonus tracks—a [...] "Euro version" [...] of [...] "Big Easy" [...] and the song [...] "Come On Home".|$|E

Cowdrey was ill for most of December and missed the First Test. He made 104 in the Second Test at Melbourne, where England made 558, their biggest total down under since 636 in the Second Test in 1928–29. He did little on the tour except to make 63 and 108 against the weak Tasmanian attack and the series was drawn 1–1 with the batsmen on both sides scoring heavily. Cowdrey himself made 267 runs (53.40), his best batting average in an Ashes series. Carrying on to New Zealand Cowdrey made a duck in the First Test, but recovered with 89 not out in the Second and 58 in the Third which made him the fifth player after Wally Hammond, Don Bradman, Len Hutton and Neil Harvey to make 6,000 Test runs, but the rain affected series was drawn 0–0.|$|E
2500|$|Starting on September 1, Gould and Fisk {{put their}} plot into motion by {{purchasing}} $1.5 million in {{gold in the}} names of Corbin and Butterfield. The two conspirators would make $15,000 ($263,000 in 2016) for every dollar rise in gold. By September 6, the price of gold had risen by $4.50 to $137 an ounce. By September 7, Gould was faced with a startling reversal when members of his pool were directed to sell off their $6 million they had achieved during the previous buying frenzy. Prices of gold fell sharply from $137 to $134 in one day. Gould lost more than $100,000 in two days. Abandoned by his associates Gould looked to Fisk for assistance but he was away on railroad business. Fisk returned to New York on September 8 and found Gould worried and depressed. Fisk reminded Gould that he still had [...] "enough gold to sink a ship" [...] while the two looked to others and devised other schemes to come out on top, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> by this time that if they began buying again, the Treasury would counter their efforts and begin selling at an accelerated rate once again.|$|E
2500|$|When Qin Lang grew up, he {{travelled}} around China and did {{not take}} up any appointments in the civil service or in the military. After Cao Cao's death in 220 CE, he remained {{in the state of}} Cao Wei – founded by Cao Cao's son and successor, Cao Pi – during the Three Kingdoms period. In 227, after Cao Rui, Cao Pi's son, ascended the Wei throne upon the death of his father, Qin Lang was appointed General of Valiant Cavalry (驍騎將軍) and Official Who Concurrently Serves in the Palace (給事中), and he constantly accompanied Cao Rui on his tours. During his reign, Cao Rui liked to pick on people's wrongdoings, and many people who committed minor offences were executed by him. Qin Lang never advised Cao Rui against his ways, nor did he recommend any talents to the Wei imperial court, but he was still nonetheless deeply favoured by the emperor, who often consulted him and called him by his childhood name [...] "Ah-su" [...] (阿穌). Cao Rui also showered gifts on Qin Lang and even had a large residence constructed in the capital Luoyang for the latter. Other officials were aware that Qin Lang was not much of a capable and talented person, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> that he was close to the emperor Cao Rui, so they often bribed him and attempted to curry favour with him. In return, Qin Lang used his status and close relationship with Cao Rui to help these officials get promotions and even titles of nobility.|$|E
