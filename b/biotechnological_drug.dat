40|$|Despite {{significant}} {{advances in}} pharmaceutical and <b>biotechnological</b> <b>drug</b> discovery, the global population is plagued with many challenging diseases. These are further compounded by anticipated explosion in an ageing population, which presents several {{problems such as}} polypharmacy, dysphagia, and neurologic conditions, resulting in noncompliance and disease complications. For antibiotics, poor compliance, can result in development of drug-resistant infections which can be fatal. Furthermore, children, especially, in developing countries die unnecessarily from easily treatable diseases (e. g., malaria), due to poor compliance arising from bitter taste and inability to swallow currently available medication. Although some of these challenges require the discovery of new drug compounds, a significant number can be resolved by employing pharmaceutics approaches to {{reduce the incidence of}} poor patient compliance. Such solutions are expected to make swallowing easier and reduce the need to swallow several solid medications, which is difficult for vulnerable pediatric and geriatric patients.

Nevertheless, the decision-making process turns out to be extremely difficult in anti-tumor necrosis factor or multidrug-resistant cases. Interleukin (IL) - 6 holds a critical role in the pathogenic pathways of uveitis, due to its extended and protean range of effects. On this background, manipulation of IL- 6 inflammatory cascade has unraveled encouraging outcomes. For instance, rising evidence has been achieved regarding the successful use of tocilizumab, the humanized monoclonal antibody targeted against the IL- 6 receptor, in treating uveitis related to juvenile idiopathic arthritis or Behçet’s disease. Similar findings have also been reported for uveitis associated with systemic disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis or multicentric Castleman disease, but also for idiopathic uveitis, the rare birdshot chorioretinopathy, and even in cases complicated by macular edema.

Although at clinical presentation these diseases appear unrelated, they have been recognized to share similar pathogenic mechanisms. Data from epidemiological and genetic studies further support the concept that IMIDs are interrelated, as they can co-occur in the same patient and share a similar genetic susceptibility. The specific aetiologies of IMIDs remain unknown, but all are known to involve dysregulation of the immune system, including an over-expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumour necrosis factor (TNF). The pivotal role played by TNF in the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of IMIDs has been documented by extensive preclinical and clinical investigations, and confirmed by the efficacy of anti-TNF <b>biotechnological</b> <b>drugs,</b> such as etanercept, infliximab and adalimumab, in the therapeutic management of these disorders.

40|$|Thermo-sensitive {{polymers}} {{are appealing}} materials for several therapeutic applications, {{such as in}} regenerative medicine and in situ drug release. These macromolecules are characterized by the ability to undergo swelling/deswelling processes during temperature change-induced phase transitions. Swelling and shrinking temperatures depend on the specific physicochemical properties, namely salt concentration or pH, of the thermo-sensitive gels {{as well as the}} incubation environment. An understanding of the mechanisms underlying the gel-swelling equilibrium and kinetics is necessary for the selection of an appropriate gel in relation to the specific pharmaceutical application. Thermo-sensitive polymers used in medicine include polyacrylamides, polyvinyls, polyethers, polysaccharides, and polyphosphazenes. A few of them have been successfully used as 3 -dimentional supports for cell cultivation, allowing for the production of scaffolds with excellent biologic properties for application in regenerative medicine. Stem cells that can undergo specific differentiation under the appropriate stimulation have also been cultivated. The ability of drug/polymer solutions to turn into gels at physiologic temperature has been exploited for local drug delivery. The prolonged in situ presence and slow drug release enhances the therapeutic performance of antibiotics used in urogenital pathologies, anti-inflammatory agents, and anticancer drugs. The reduced toxicity as well as lower fluctuations in peak-to-trough drug concentrations make these systems superior to traditional gels. Thermo-sensitive hydrogels have also been demonstrated to be interesting formulations for the delivery of <b>biotechnological</b> <b>drugs.</b> Proteins and oligonucleotides can be loaded under mild conditions, stabilized, and released at a controlled rate.

40|$|<b>Biotechnological</b> <b>drugs</b> {{have become}} a {{fundamental}} resource {{for the treatment of}} rheumatic patients. Patent expiry of some of these drugs created the opportunity for biopharmaceutical manufacturers to develop biosimilar drugs intended to be as efficacious as the originator product but with a lower cost to healthcare systems. Due to the complex manufacturing process and highly intricate structure of biologicals, a biosimilar can never be an exact copy of its reference product. Consequently, regulatory authorities issued strict preclinical and clinical guidelines to ensure safety and efficacy equivalence and, in September 2013, the biosimilar of infliximab was the first biosimilar monoclonal antibody to be authorized for use in the European Union. The current document is a position statement of the "Sociedade Portuguesa de Reumatologia" (Portuguese Society of Rheumatology) on the use of biosimilar drugs in rheumatic diseases. Two systematic literature reviews were performed, one concerning clinical trials and the other one concerning international position papers on biosimilars. The results were presented and discussed in a national meeting and a final position document was discussed, written and approved by Portuguese rheumatologists. Briefly, this position statement is contrary to automatic substitution of the originator by the biosimilar, defends either a different INN or the prescription by brand name, supports that switching between biosimilars and the originator molecule should be done after at least 6 months of treatment and based on the attending physician decision and after adequate patient information, recommends the registration of all biosimilar treated patients in Reuma. pt for efficacy, safety and immunogenicity surveillance, following the strategy already ongoing for originators, and opposes to extrapolation of indications approved to the originator to completely different diseases and/or age groups without adequate pre-clinical, safety or efficacy data. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

40|$|AIMS: To {{evaluate}} the efficacy {{and safety of}} the treatment of psoriatic arthritis (PsA) patients with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists in the Rheumatology Department of Hospital de Santa Maria using the BioRePortAP. METHODS: The Portuguese Society of Rheumatology (SPR) developed an electronic medical chart coupled with a database for the follow up of PsA patients, the BioRePortAP, which was launched in May 2009. This evaluation was based on all the PsA patients that were on active treatment with TNF antagonists in September 2009 and were registered in the BioRePortAP. All the previous data on these patients were introduced in BioRePortAP using the prospective paper based follow up protocol that this Department was using since 1999. Only patients with more than 9 months of treatment were analyzed. RESULTS: Forty-two patients with PsA, actively treated with anti-TNF agents in September 2009, for at least 9 months, were analyzed in BioRePortAP. Twenty-three patients were male (55 %) and nineteen were female (45 %). The average age of these patients was 49. 8 +/- 10. 9 years old, the average disease duration was of 10. 7 +/- 5. 6 years and the mean duration of biological therapy was of 37. 8 +/- 27. 8 months. For the 81 % of patients with peripheral joint disease there was a mean reduction of more than 80 % in the swollen and tender joint counts, and almost 50 % in the health assessment questionnaire (HAQ) value. In the 19 % of the patients with axial involvement the reduction of BASDAI and BASFI was not statistically significative. On top of that, PASI score suffered a reduction of 64 %. Fourteen patients (33. 3 %) had to switch their TNF antagonist treatment. 58. 8 % of the switches were due to adverse effects and 41. 2 % due to therapy failure. Regarding the 56 adverse reactions registered, only one was a severe reaction. The remaining adverse reactions were not severe and 67 % of them were due to infections. DISCUSSION: The results of this first report {{of the use of}} the BioRePortAP in clinical practice confirm the efficacy and safety of TNF antagonist treatment in PsA. The results shown here elucidate the potential applications of BioRePortAP as a tool for efficacy and safety assessment of PsA patients treated with <b>biotechnological</b> <b>drugs...</b>|$|R
40|$|According to PubMed, {{the term}} ‘biosimilar’ {{has existed for}} 10 years in {{scientific}} literature, with the first biosimilar having been introduced onto the European market in 2006. Early biosimilars concerned relatively small proteins such as human growth hormone, epoetin and filgrastim. In 2013, the first biosimilar monoclonal antibody (infliximab) was approved. It is beyond any doubt that the emergence of biosimilars has an important impact on biopharmaceutical companies involved {{in the production of}} biotechnological medicines. This is also illustrated by the fact that biosimilars from blockbuster drugs are currently also being developed by competing ‘originator’ companies. Bringing copies of off-patent <b>biotechnological</b> <b>drugs</b> to the market has required the development of particular guidelines by regulatory authorities. Chapters 1 – 3 in this e-book cover the various aspects of these issues, and the consequences for biosimilar development and the analytical requirements. The concept of biosimilar development is based on a very detailed, thorough analytical comparison between the biosimilar and its reference product. General aspects that need {{to be taken into account}} and particular concerns (e. g., analysis of glycosylation patterns) regarding physicochemical characterization are discussed in Chapter 4. Once sufficient bioanalytical similarity has been demonstrated, it is acceptable to reduce the extent of nonclinical tests as discussed in Chapter 5. Immunogenicity is one of the major concerns and requires well-developed and characterized assays for detection of an antibody response towards the drug. Chapters 6 and 7 discuss important aspects in the design and validation of these assays, and the possible impact of external factors. Finally, Chapter 8 is devoted in particular to scientific and regulatory issues for the safe approval of biosimilar monoclonal antibodies. It is clear that the field of biosimilars has evolved considerably and is likely to be subject to significant expansion in the future. Scientific progress in the area of analytical techniques is expected to allow an even more detailed comparative analysis of biosimilars against reference products. One of the key challenges will be to judge in a reliable and predictive manner which differences may, or may not, have an impact on the safety or efficacy of the biosimilar. This may subsequently result in less pre-approval clinical studies for granting market authorization. Finally, the future will have to tell whether, or not, the introduction of biosimilars really contributes towards a sustainable healthcare budget. nrpages: e-bookstatus: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: The use of <b>biotechnological</b> {{manufactured}} <b>drugs,</b> or biologicals, {{has increased}} massively {{over the past}} few years. Used especially in the treatment of cancer and other severe diseases, biologicals incur high annual therapy costs and represent an additional burden for healthcare systems. Expenditure can be decreased by using cheaper biosimilars, produced following the patent expiration of the reference product. Here we present a model calculation that demonstrates the potential savings from using biosimilars for erythropoietins, granulocyte colony-stimulating factors, and monoclonal antibodies in EU national markets between 2007 and 2020. Methods: Using a sequential approach, we calculated the savings through the use of biosimilars for France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Romania, Spain, Sweden and UK. First, either a ‘top-down’ or a ‘bottom-up’ approach was chosen to forecast the expected quantity of consumed drugs. We then calculated average reimbursement prices using additional information about the healthcare systems in each country. Finally, we estimated the potential savings for the above molecule groups using developed country specific scenarios. Results: The use of biosimilars is expected to result in overall savings between Euros 11. 8 billion and Euros 33. 4 billion between 2007 and 2020, with largest savings expected for France, Germany and UK. Biosimilar monoclonal antibodies are expected to produce the greatest savings ranging from Euros 1. 8 billion to Euros 20. 4 billion. Biosimilar erythropoietins are expected to provide savings of between Euros 9. 4 billion and Euros 11. 2 billion, while granulocyte colony-stimulating factors could produce savings of between Euros 0. 7 billion to Euros 1. 8 billion.

40|$|Modeling {{cellular}} metabolism is fundamental for many <b>biotechnological</b> applications, including <b>drug</b> discovery and rational cell factory design. Central carbon metabolism (CCM) {{is particularly important}} as it provides the energy and precursors for other biological processes. However, the complex regulation of CCM pathways has still not been fully unraveled and {{recent studies have shown}} that CCM is mostly regulated at post-transcriptional levels. In order to better understand the role of allosteric regulation in controlling the metabolic phenotype, we expand the reconstruction of CCM in Escherichia coli with allosteric interactions obtained from relevant databases. This model is used to integrate multi-omics datasets and analyze the coordinated changes in enzyme, metabolite, and flux levels between multiple experimental conditions. We observe cases where allosteric interactions have a major contribution to the metabolic flux changes. Inspired by these results, we develop a constraint-based method (arFBA) for simulation of metabolic flux distributions that accounts for allosteric interactions. This method can be used for systematic prediction of potential allosteric regulation under the given experimental conditions based on experimental data. We show that arFBA allows predicting coordinated flux changes that would not be predicted without considering allosteric regulation. The results reveal the importance of key regulatory metabolites, such as fructose- 1, 6 -bisphosphate, in controlling the metabolic flux.

40|$|Abstract: The supply {{problem with}} regard to drug {{development}} and sustainable production lies in the limited amounts of biomass of most marine invertebrates available from wild stocks. Thus, most pharmacologically active marine natural products can only be isolated in minute yields. Total synthesis of pharmacologically active natural products has been successfully established but is in many cases economically not feasible due {{to the complexity of}} the molecular structures and the low yields. To solve the pressing supply issue in marine drug discovery, other strategies appear to be more promising. One of these is mariculture which has successfully been established with the bryozoan Bugula neritina (the source of the bryostatins) and the tunicate Ecteinascidia turbinata (the source of ET- 743). Another strategy involves partial synthesis from precursors which are biotechnologically available. An example is ET- 743 that can be partially synthesized from safracin B which is a metabolite of Pseudomonas fluorescens. There have been many examples of striking structural similarities between natural products obtained from marine invertebrates and those of microbial origin which suggests that microorganisms living in their invertebrate hosts could be the actual producers of these secondary metabolites. With regard to sustainable biotechnological production of pharmacologically important metabolites from marine invertebrates and their Ã¢Â€ÂœendosymbiontsÃ¢Â€Â, a more advanced strategy is to focus on cloning and expression of the respective key biosynthetic gene clusters.

The microparticles produced at 15 min of stirring without PVA showed the best results in terms of size, homogeneity, and sphericity. In such a case, BSA played a role as a surface active agent, replacing PVA. For longer stirring times, BSA was unable to act as an emulsifier. These microparticles showed an uncommon release profile, consisting of a two-step release mechanism, at the pH range studied. Considering that a two-step release mechanism is occurring, the experimental data were adjusted by applying modified power law and Weibull equations in order to describe release mechanism n and release rate constant k, respectively. Each one of the release stages was related to a specific value of n and k. The second stage was driven by a super case II transport mechanism, as a result of diffusion, macromolecular relaxation, and erosion. A third model, described by Hixson–Crowell, confirmed the erosion mechanism. Vit-B 12 diffusion kinetics in aqueous solutions (i. e., without the microparticles) follows a one-step process, being k dependent on the pH, confirming that the two-step release mechanism is a characteristic profile of the developed microparticles. The microparticles released only 2. 70 % of their initial drug load at pH 2, and 58. 53 % at pH 10...|$|R
40|$|Biomedical sciences, and in {{particular}} biomarker research, demand efficient glycoprotein enrichment platforms. In this paper, a facile and efficient approach combining distillation-precipitation polymerization (DPP) and click chemistry was developed to synthesize boronic acid ligand-modified magnetic nanoparticles for the enrichment of glycoproteins. Due to the relatively large amount of benzyl chloride groups introduced by DPP on the magnetic core, which easily can be transferred into azide groups, the alkyne-phenylboronic acid ligands were immobilized {{onto the surface of}} Fe 3 O 4 with high efficiency via the Cu(I) -catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) 'click' reaction. The morphology, structure and composition of the resulting core-shell Fe 3 O 4 @poly(4 -vinylbenylchloride) @amidophenylboronic acid (Fe 3 O 4 @pVBC@APBA) nanocomposites were characterized by transmission electron microscopy, X-ray powder diffraction, vibrating sample magnetometry, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis and X-ray photoelectron spectrometry. The Fe 3 O 4 @pVBC@APBA microspheres held a similar to 50 nm polymeric shell, and exhibited high magnetic response to an external magnetic field. The binding results demonstrated that Fe 3 O 4 @pVBC@APBA possessed high adsorption capacity and remarkable selectivity to glycoproteins. Moreover, the glycoproteins in the egg white sample could be enriched under physiological conditions (pH 7. 4) as well, due to the lower pK(a) value of the alkyne-phenylboronic acid ligand. The high stability and selectivity of Fe 3 O 4 @pVBC@APBA for the glycoproteins were retained over several separation cycles. This boronate affinity material has potential applications in biomedical and <b>biotechnological</b> fields including <b>drug</b> delivery and biosensing...|$|R
40|$|Pichia pastoris and Saccharomyces cerevisiae are two {{important}} fungi in both research and industrial applications of protein production and genetic engineering {{due to the}} inherent ability. For example, S. cerevisiae can produce important proteins from wide ranged sugar from ligno-cellulose to methanol. Accurate genome-scale metabolic networks (GMNs) of the two fungi can improve <b>biotechnological</b> production efficiency, <b>drug</b> discovery and cancer research. Comparison of metabolic networks between fungi brings {{a new way to}} study the evolutionary relationship between them. There are two basic steps for modeling metabolic networks. The first step is to construct a draft model from existing model or softwares such as the pathway tool software and InterProScan. The second step is model simulation in order to construct a gapless metabolic network. There are two main methods for genome-wide metabolic network reconstruction: constraint-based methods and graph-theoretical pathway finding methods. Constraints-based methods used linear equations to simulate the growth under your model with different constraints. Graph-theoretical pathway finding methods use graphic approach to construct the gapless model so that each metabolite can be acquired from either nutritions or the products of other gapless reactions. In my thesis, a new method designed by Pitkänen [PJH+ 14] is used to reconstruct the metabolic networks of Pichia pastoris and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Five experiments were developed to evaluate the accuracy of the CoReCo method. The first experiment was to analyze the quality of the GMNs of Pichia pastoris and Saccharomyces cerevisiae by comparing with the existing model. The second and third experiments tested the stability of CoReCo constructed under random mutation and random deletion of the protein sequence simulating noisy input data. The next two experiments were done by considering different number of phylogenetic neighbors in the phylogenetic tree. The last experiment tested the effect of the two main parameters (acceptance and rejection thresholds) when CoReCo filled the reaction gaps in the final step...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{the development and}} validation of high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) methods aimed for two industrially important areas: (i) analysis of biotechnological synthesis and (ii) determination of adsorption isotherm parameters. There is today a lack of detailed recommendations for analytical procedures {{in the field of}} <b>biotechnological</b> production of <b>drugs.</b> Therefore, guidelines were given for analytical development and validation in this field; the production of 9 α-hydroxyprogesterone was used as model. In addition, a rapid method using HPLC coupled with diode-array-detection (DAD) and mass spectrometry (MS), was developed for the preliminary identification and quantification of the product. In addition, requirements and recommendations were developed for the selection of the internal standard and for its inclusion in the process liquid. By using this approach the precision and accuracy of the quantitative method were considerably improved. Preparative chromatography is a powerful separation method for the purification of pure compounds from more or less complex sample mixtures. One such mixture can be the process liquid from a fermentation, another example can be a racemic mixture of compounds whose enantiomeric constituents must be isolated. Computer-assisted modeling can be used to optimize preparative chromatography. However, competitive adsorption isotherm parameters are required as input data for the computer simulations. In this thesis, a new injection technique, based on a firm theoretical basis, was developed for the peak perturbation (PP) method allowing the determination of binary competitive adsorption isotherm parameters from a broad concentration range. With the new method the determination of adsorption isotherm parameters from a quaternary mixture could be done for the first time. The profiles simulated with these parameters showed excellent agreement with the corresponding experimental profiles, validating the accuracy of the adsorption isotherm parameters derived by the new method...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{biological}} activity (direct anticancer action in vitro) of combinatorial IL- 2 succinylated derivatives was examined. Acylation of IL- 2 was performed using succinic anhydride with {{various levels of}} acylation, {{with the formation of}} a complex assembly of many derivatives (self-assembled quasi-living structure). Methods: In the study, we used recombinant interleukin- 2 (IL- 2) (Ronkoleukin, Russia) in oxidizing form and other reagents from Sigma-Aldrich and Fluka (USA). For acylation, recombinant IL- 2 {{in the form of a}} matrix fluid with a protein concentration of 0. 6 mg/ml was used. The IL- 2 matrix solution was brought to a pH of 8. 0 through the addition of a 0. 01 % solution of sodium hydroxide. The synthesized ensemble of succinyl-IL- 2 was analyzed using the capillary gel electrophoresis method in an Agilent- 2100 bioanalyzer. The molecular masses of the synthesized ensemble were established in comparison to standard samples of low-molecular proteins with known molecular masses that were part of the bioanalyzer’s collection. The additional negative charge of the modified IL- 2 was determined by a FPLC (Fast Protein Liquid Chromatography) system from Pharmacia (Woerden, Netherlands). CTLL- 2, a murine IL- 2 -dependent cell line, was obtained fromBiokontrol (Kiev, Ukraine). These respondingcells were used in proliferative assays comparing the activityof the IL- 2 and succinylated IL- 2 derivatives to the WHO InternationalStandard. For statistical data analysis, the one-way ANOVA was used. Results : After treatment with Suc-IL- 2, BTL were studied in vitro on the CTLL- 2 cell line, dose-dependently, in a BTL induction reaction. The highest level of {{biological activity}} in acylated IL- 2 was observed in Suc-IL- 2 with four modified lysine residues. In conclusion, succinylated IL- 2 with four substituted lysines may be useful as a prospective anticancer agent. Conclusions : Ten-fold increase in the biological activity of IL- 2 was observed after partial succinylation. This phenomenon can be used in the further IL- 2 <b>drugs</b> <b>biotechnological</b> development for increasing the concentration of the main active substance in medicinal form</p...|$|R
40|$|A facile {{method is}} {{described}} for the preparation Of D-glucose-sensitive hydrogel membranes based on cross-linking carboxymethyl dextran (CM-dextran) with the glucose binding lectin concanavalin A (ConA) using carbodiimide chemistry. The mesh size of these hydrogels is deter-mined by both covalent cross-links and affinity interactions between ConA and terminal glucose moieties on the dextran chains. Competitive {{displacement of the}} affinity interactions by D-glucose leads to changes in both morphology and permeability. The carbodiimide coupling chemistry has the advantage that it introduces no potentially cytotoxic groups into the gets formed rendering them more suitable for potential in vivo applications. Infrared spectra of the hydrogels suggest that, in addition to direct cross-linking of CM-dextran chains, gels are also stabilized by formation of amide bonds between amine groups in the ConA and carboxyl groups in CM-dextran. This suggests that the mechanical properties of the gels can be modified by the inclusion of inert proteins to increase the density of covalent cross-links. The permeability of the hydrogels, as shown by protein diffusion, increases in response {{to changes in the}} D-glucose concentration of the external medium, causing competitive displacement of the affinity cross-links. Sequential addition and removal of external glucose in a stepwise manner showed that these permeability changes are reversible. Results obtained using isothermal titration calorimetry confirmed the competitive binding between ConA-dextran and D-glucose this was confirmed to be a biospecific effect by the observation that L-glucose was not bound by free or dextran coupled ConA. Scanning electron microscopy of samples prepared using cryofixation and cryofracturing techniques showed that observed changes in permeability correlate Well with glucose dependent structural changes in the gel. The effects of varying pH and ionic strength show that ion exchange effects also influence diffusion rates. However, an advantage of the synthetic route described is that the intrinsic charge density of the hydrogels produced can be tailored to the specific interaction by varying the degree of carboxylic substitution on the original dextran. The case of preparation and control of final gel properties allowed by this approach offers possibilities for a range of <b>biotechnological</b> applications including <b>drug</b> delivery and biosensors...|$|R
