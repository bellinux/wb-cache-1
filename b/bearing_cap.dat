25|$|Land Rover's global sales {{collapsed}} {{during the}} early 1980s. This was mainly due to foreign competition offering larger, more powerful, more comfortable vehicles. Land Rover suffered from poor build quality and materials during the 1970s and by 1983 the then-current Series III model was distinctly outdated, despite recent improvements. Land Rover decided to focus the sales of its Ninety/One Ten/127 range on the UK and Europe, for which it required a diesel engine with significantly better performance than the 68-horsepower 2.5-litre type then in production. Project Falcon was started in 1984 to develop a turbocharged version of this engine. The resulting engine was Land Rover's first production turbodiesel and their first engine {{to be given a}} marketing name- the Diesel Turbo, a name given to differentiate it from the VM Motori-built turbodiesel then being used in the Range Rover, which was sold as the 'Turbo D'. The Diesel Turbo, although essentially the same as the 2.5-litre diesel, had numerous additions and modifications to allow it to cope with the stresses of turbocharging. New pistons with Teflon-coated crowns and Nimonic steel exhaust valves were used to withstand higher combustion temperatures. The crankshaft was cross-drilled for improved strength and cooling. The block was modified to allow an oil feed/drain system to the turbocharger, and the cooling system was improved with an 8-bladed viscous fan and integral oil cooler. The engine was fitted with a high-capacity breather system to cope with the greater volumes of gas flow through the engine. Despite the inherent age of the design, it performed well in tests against its rivals and provided the vital blend of performance and economy the Land Rover had needed for many years. It was the first diesel model to match the petrol engine's 4-ton towing limit and the first to be able to exceed the UK national speed limit of 70mph (112km/h). However, early engines suffered several failures. Most serious were failed main and big-end bearings and splits or cracks in the block. In 1988 a new block and an improved design of bearing and <b>bearing</b> <b>cap</b> was fitted which solved these issues. The engine's higher internal temperatures meant that the cooling system also had to be maintained to a much higher standard than the earlier engines. Further changes were made in 1989, this time to the breather system to prevent oil being drawn into the air filter. Despite these issues, the Diesel Turbo was a strong seller. It was the standard engine for the UK and European markets and Land Rover's sales increased after its introduction. Time has shown that these engines can turn in long service lives if maintained as requiredâ€”like many early turbodiesels, a lack of maintenance causes failure.|$|E
2500|$|While at Rio, {{the crew}} noticed {{one of the}} engines had {{noticeable}} carbon buildup from being run at low speed during the propaganda flight days earlier. [...] On the return flight from South America, the automatic valve for gas cell 3 stuck open. [...] Gas was transferred from other cells through an inflation line. It was never understood why the valve stuck open, and subsequently the crew only used the hand-operated maneuvering valves for cells 2 and 3. 38 hours after departure, one of the airship's four Daimler-Benz 16-cylinder diesel engines [...] (engine car no. 4, the forward port engine) suffered a wrist pin breakage, damaging the piston and cylinder. Repairs were started immediately and the engine functioned on fifteen cylinders {{for the remainder of}} the flight. Four hours after engine 4 failed, engine no. 2 (aft port) was shut down, as one of two <b>bearing</b> <b>cap</b> bolts for the engine failed and the cap fell into the crank case. The cap was removed and the engine was run again, but when the ship was off Cape Juby the second cap broke and the engine was shut down again. The engine was not run again to prevent further damage. [...] With three engines operating at a speed of [...] and headwinds reported over the English Channel, the crew raised the airship in search of counter-trade winds usually found above , well beyond the airship's pressure altitude. Unexpectedly, the crew found such a wind at the lower altitude of [...] which permitted them to guide the airship safely back to Germany after getting emergency permission from France to fly a more direct route over the Rhone Valley. The nine-day flight covered [...] in 203 hours and 32 minutes of flight time. All four engines were later overhauled and no further problems were encountered on later flights. For the rest of April, Hindenburg remained at its hangar where the engines were overhauled and the lower fin [...] and rudder received a final repair; the ground clearance of the lower rudder was increased from 8 to 14 degrees.|$|E

50|$|A 4-bolt main {{refers to}} the number of bolts {{attaching}} the main <b>bearing</b> <b>caps</b> to the block of an internal combustion engine. Four bolt mains are considered much stronger for high performance use than a 2 bolt main. Using 4 bolts to secure the main <b>bearing</b> <b>caps</b> reduces the amount of flex within the crankshaft as compared to 2 bolts.|$|R
5000|$|When a ladder-frame main <b>bearing</b> <b>cap</b> is used, the {{crankcase}} assembly becomes considerably stiffer.|$|E
50|$|On 9 October 2009, the CAA {{issued a}} press release {{requesting}} the public's assistance in finding a <b>bearing</b> <b>cap</b> {{from one of the}} engines. The cap, which possibly separated from the engine during takeoff, could not be found at the crash site or at the airport.|$|E

5000|$|Testing of the 406, {{with its}} higher power levels, led to cross-bolted mains [...] - [...] that is, main <b>bearing</b> <b>caps</b> that were secured {{not only by}} bolts at each end coming up from beneath, but also by bolts {{coming in from the}} sides through the block. A custom fit spacer was used between the cap and the block face. This design {{prevented}} the main <b>bearing</b> <b>caps</b> from [...] "walking" [...] under extreme racing conditions, and can be found today in many of the most powerful and modern engines from many manufacturers.|$|R
50|$|When {{used in the}} {{passenger}} cars both versions of the KA24 used a crankshaft girdle, as opposed to individual main <b>bearing</b> <b>caps.</b> In the Nissan Hardbody and Frontier applications a crank girdle was not used.|$|R
50|$|The {{crankshaft}} can {{be inserted}} into an assembled crankcase, {{rather than the}} <b>bearing</b> <b>caps</b> being assembled around it. This is usually done by rotating the crankcase end-upwards and then lowering the crankshaft vertically into it.|$|R
50|$|The first Chevrolet {{engine to}} use 4-bolt mains was the 1967 Chevrolet Camaro. Chrysler and Ford {{employed}} Y-blocks, {{meaning that the}} block skirts extended below the centreline of the crankshaft. The main bearing caps could then be fixed with an additional cross-bolt, which was a horizontal bolt going into or through the main <b>bearing</b> <b>cap.</b>|$|E
50|$|Cross-bolting has two advantages: it couples the {{two sides}} of the {{crankcase}} together, making it stiffer overall and less prone to twisting. Secondly it helps to hold the <b>bearing</b> <b>cap</b> down against the downward force from the piston. This second advantage is usually only possible with blind bolts, as the dowel effect of a through bolt is less effective.|$|E

5000|$|Tensile {{forces are}} {{taken on the}} studs, not the {{cylinder}} block or crankcase. In particular, the force is a pure tension, rather than a twisting force owing to any offset between the <b>bearing</b> <b>cap</b> and cylinder wall bolt. This permits the block and crankcase to be made lighter and less stiff, whilst still {{reducing the amount of}} deflection and twist exhibited in service.|$|E
50|$|At the {{beginning}} the frame {{was produced by}} Volvo but later they were supplied by Crichton-Vulcan. The wheelbase of S-321 is 3 400 mm, S-322 4 100 mm and S-323 is with 3 800 mm. Also S-324 with wheelbase of 4 600 mm appears on some early brochures, {{but there is no}} evidence that a single unit was ever produced. Vehicles of the pre-series had a larger front wheel <b>bearing</b> <b>cap</b> than the serial produced units. The tyres were produced by Englebert.|$|E
50|$|A cross-bolted bearing is a bearing, {{usually a}} {{crankshaft}} main bearing of a piston engine. Most bearing caps are retained by two bolts, {{one on each}} side of the bearing journal, and parallel to the cylinder axis. A cross-bolted bearing has one or more additional bolts, at right-angles to both the cylinder and crankshaft axes. These bolts may be either a single through bolt passing through the crankcase from one side to the other, or else two blind bolts threaded into the <b>bearing</b> <b>cap</b> from each side.|$|E
50|$|Hubstacks are {{bearings}} {{added to}} the hub (the outside) of a yo-yo and covered with some form of side cap to allow the yo-yo body to be held while it spins. With the side <b>cap</b> <b>bearing,</b> the operator can hold the yo-yo in many different planes and perform different styles of tricks which are difficult (or impossible in some cases) to be performed with conventional yo-yos. These configurations may be called hubstacks, <b>bearing</b> <b>caps,</b> synergy caps, or jimmy hats.|$|R

50|$|The DOHC {{cylinder}} head had 16 valves and {{was made of}} lost foam cast aluminium. The camshafts were held in the {{cylinder head}} with <b>bearing</b> <b>caps</b> and driven by a chain off the front crankshaft sprocket. Motion from the camshafts was transmitted to the 16 valves by direct-acting hydraulic lifters.|$|R
5000|$|Plastigauge {{consists}} of a strip of soft material with precise known dimensions and deformation characteristics. This is sandwiched between a clean bearing surface on a shaft and the bearing shell itself. The plastigauge flattens after the <b>bearing</b> <b>cap</b> is tightened. The dimensional clearance is then determined by comparing the amount that the gauge material has flattened using a template.

5000|$|A {{crankcase}} {{often has}} {{an opening in}} the bottom to which an oil pan is attached with a gasketed bolted joint. Some crankcase designs fully surround the crank's main bearing journals, whereas many others form only one half, with a <b>bearing</b> <b>cap</b> forming the other. Some crankcase areas require no structural strength from the oil pan itself (in which case the oil pan is typically stamped from sheet steel), whereas other crankcase designs do (in which case the oil pan is a casting in its own right). Both the crankcase and any rigid cast oil pan often have reinforcing ribs cast into them, as well as bosses which are drilled and tapped to receive mounting screws/bolts for various other engine parts.|$|E
50|$|Mark IV engines saw {{extensive}} {{application in}} Chevrolet and GMC medium duty trucks, {{as well as}} in Blue Bird Corporation's All American and TC/2000 transit buses (the latter up until 1995, using a 427 with purpose-built carburetor). In addition to the 427, a 366-cubic-inch (6.0 L) version was produced for the commercial market. Both the 366 and 427 commercial versions were built with a raised-deck, four-bolt main <b>bearing</b> <b>cap</b> cylinder to accommodate an extra oil control ring on the pistons. Unfortunately, the raised deck design complicated the use of the block in racing applications, as standard intake manifolds required spacers for proper fit. Distributors with adjustable collars that allowed adjustments to the length of the distributor shaft also had to be used with 366 and 427 truck blocks.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{its large}} factory bore size, short (compared to RB engines) deck height, and bottom end {{strength}} that {{is greater than}} any other production B or RB engine due to extra material added around the main <b>bearing</b> <b>caps,</b> 400 B engine blocks have become a popular choice for high-performance engine build ups.|$|R
50|$|The blocks are all {{strongly}} {{made using}} cast iron with large interconnected main bearing cradles and two bolt main <b>bearing</b> <b>caps.</b> Forged steel crankshafts, and cast iron main bearing support girdles became standard with the 3VZ-FE. Piston and ring construction are typical parts, with rods varying between large and very large for stock V6 production engines.|$|R
50|$|In {{more modern}} practice, the {{crankshaft}} and {{connecting rod big end}} bearings {{in a modern}} automobile engine are made of a replaceable steel shell, keyed to the <b>bearing</b> <b>caps.</b> The inner surface of the steel shell is plated with a coating of bronze which is in turn coated with a thin layer of Babbitt metal as the bearing surface.|$|R
50|$|The balance shafts are {{relocated}} {{from the}} cylinder block to oil pan module. The two-piece steel-aluminum oil pan features in-pan integrated oil-pump assembly {{driven by the}} balance shaft with a shorter inverted-tooth chain. Other improvements include inverted-tooth chain driving the camshaft, forged steel crankshaft, cast aluminum bedplate with main <b>bearing</b> <b>cap</b> inserts made of iron, high-pressure fuel rail with rubber-isolated assembly, acoustically shielded plastic cover for the intake manifold, and structurally enhanced aluminum camshaft cover and front cover. These improvements helped reduce noise intensity by 40% compared to the 2.4 L engine and change the noise signature into a higher frequency above 2,000 Hz. The engine also uses a variable-displacement oil pump and an actively controlled thermostat. Direct injection reduces emissions by 25%, while continuous cam phasing {{eliminates the need for}} an EGR system. Maximum engine speed is listed at 7000 RPM.|$|E
50|$|The VG {{engine family}} {{consists}} of V6 piston engines designed and produced by Nissan for several {{vehicles in the}} Nissan lineup. The VG series started in 1983 becoming Japan's first mass-produced V6 engine. VG engines displace between 2.0 L and 3.3 L and feature an iron block and aluminum heads. The early VG engines featured a SOHC arrangement with 2 valves per cylinder. A later revision featured a slightly different block, and a DOHC arrangement which utilized 4 valves per cylinder and Nissan's own version of variable valve timing for a smoother idle and more torque at low to medium engine speeds. The block features a single piece main <b>bearing</b> <b>cap.</b> The production blocks and production head castings were used successfully in the Nissan GTP ZX-Turbo and NPT-90 race cars which won the IMSA GT Championship {{three years in a}} row.|$|E
5000|$|The M21 is a {{circular}} U.S. anti-tank landmine {{that uses a}} Misznay Schardin effect warhead. The mine uses an M607 pressure fuse, which can be adapted as a tilt rod fuze. The mine is triggered either by pressure, or by the tilt rod being forced beyond 20 degrees from the vertical by a force of more than 1.7 kg, either of these actions results in pressure being transferred via a <b>bearing</b> <b>cap</b> to a Belleville spring, which inverts, driving the firing pin into the M46 detonator. The M46 charge first ignites a black powder charge, which blows off the mine's cover, and clears any earth or debris {{that may have been}} on top of the mine. A fraction of a second later the main warhead detonates, driving and compressing a steel plate upwards, with enough force to penetrate 76 mm of armour at a distance of 530 mm. Approximately 200,000 M21 mines were produced in the U.S. and a licensed copies, the K441 and K442, were produced in South Korea.|$|E
50|$|The engine {{utilized}} a water-cooled aluminum block. The main <b>bearing</b> <b>caps</b> {{were made}} of cast iron and held in place with two bolts each. The cylinder block bores had interference fit cast iron liners for the piston rings to sit against. The engine block was made from 319.1 aluminum alloy and the liners were made from D5506 ductile iron.|$|R
50|$|Originally within Ford, it is {{said that}} the Kent name was {{actually}} born with the A711 and A711M blocks (commonly called the 711M block) with square main <b>bearing</b> <b>caps</b> for the Crossflow series, which represented a vast improvement in the durability of the engines. However, the name caught on to be used outside the company to include pre-711M engines as well.|$|R
5000|$|The Crossflow {{featured}} {{a change in}} combustion chamber design, using a Heron type combustion chamber {{in the top of}} the piston rather than in the head. The head itself was flat with each engine capacity (1098 cc and 1298 cc) featuring different pistons with different sized bowls in 681F and 701M blocks. The 1599 cc 691M block had the stronger 'square' <b>bearing</b> <b>caps</b> later used in the 711M, and small combustion chambers in the near-flat head (the bulk of the volume being in the piston bowl). In 1970, the new A711 block for 1298 cc and A711M block for 1599 cc were introduced with thicker block wall, square main <b>bearing</b> <b>caps,</b> large diameter cam followers and wider cam lobes, with the latter block having a 7/16" [...] taller deck height, together with a return to the flat head. These changes represented a significant improvement in the reliability of the engines, and the blocks are commonly referred to as '711M' blocks.|$|R
