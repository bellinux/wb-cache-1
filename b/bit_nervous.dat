Hikari begins to perfect her skills, and is soon competing at the national and international level, where she meets new rivals.|$|E
25|$|In February 2012, Schuyler Yancey {{was cast}} {{in the role of}} Dr. Cameron Davis. Yancey made his debut on the April 5, 2012 episode. Supermodel, turned actor, known for his {{appearance}} as Rihanna's love interest the California King Bed music video, Nathan Owens began taping the role in late September, in secret. On October 1, 2012, several sources, including Soap Opera Digest confirmed that Owens had joined the cast. Owens was spotted on set for the show's 12, 000th episode during a press conference. However, the producers refused to comment on the role Owens would be playing. The actor himself later confirmed through his own personal Facebook that he had been cast in the role of Cameron. Owens's Instagram message about the casting was believed to be an accident. Soaps In Depth later confirmed that Owens would make his first appearance on the December 21 as a replacement for Yancey. However, due to news coverage of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, Davis first air date was postponed to December 24, 2012. Owens found out about the role through his manager. In an interview, Owens revealed that he went out for the role of Rodney. He worked with casting director, Marnie Saitta and went through several tests. Owens admitted that he had a good feeling about the casting because he was given several opportunities to go over the material. Saitta called him back shortly after his test and told Owens to come back in a few days. He went back and forth a few times before he met with the producers and tested with Kate Mansi who portrayed Abigail. Owens signed on to play Cameron and beat out 15 other actors for the role. Owens admitted to being hesitant about replacing someone, though Yancey was only in the role {{for a short period of}} time, people had already gotten used to him, and Owens said that he felt like he was under a magnifying glass when he started, and that the potential critics made him a <b>bit</b> <b>nervous.</b> On September 21, 2013, at Kate Mansi's birthday party, Owens announced his departure from the series and revealed that he would last air in November.|$|E

First-time character lead Becky Bresee serves as the supervising animator for Anna. She described her job as [...] "making the character more believable". To achieve this, she had to act out part of a sequence in the movie between Anna and Kristoff {{for a number of}} times, each of them emphasizing the character's gestures differently.

500|$|Tales of Vesperia: The First Strike {{was officially}} {{announced}} in early 2009 {{with the staff}} confirming the return of Kousuke Toriumi and Mamoru Miyano as the protagonists. Production of the movie started when Tales of Vesperia was still in plot stage. The team discarded {{the idea of making}} an adaptation of the game due to its large length. The team was also against making a sequel or a sidestory due to the required time-consuming character introductions that would make it required to play the game to enjoy. Director Kenta Kamei wanted a movie that anybody would enjoy. As a result, it was decided to make it a prequel as they could explore Yuri and Flynn's background. Kamei was originally involved in the movie parts of the Tales series. When he was assigned as the movie's director, he recalls feeling [...] "honoured, surprised and a <b>bit</b> <b>nervous</b> at the same time".|$|E

While {{on the golf}} course with University of Alabama coach Paul [...] "Bear" [...] Bryant, McKay casually mentioned that he had received a commitment from an Alabama native. McKay assumed that Bryant wouldn't be interested in Mitchell because he was black and Alabama had no black players on their roster. Bryant swooped in and recruited Mitchell aggressively. Although Mitchell originally was a <b>bit</b> <b>nervous</b> about the reception he would receive at Alabama, as well as the amount of playing time he could garner, his family encouraged him to return home and accept Bryant's scholarship offer. Besides his family's encouragement and Bryant's assurances that his race would not be a problem, Mitchell's opinion that Alabama's School of Social Work was one of the country's best was a big factor in his decision.|$|E

50|$|Azrin {{researched}} {{the concept of}} behavior reversal training, also known as habit reversal, in order to treat patients with uncontrollable physical tics, trichotillomania, and other repetitive behavior disorders like stuttering or Tourette syndrome. In 1977, he published Habit control: Stuttering, Nail <b>Biting,</b> and Other <b>Nervous</b> Habits, which summarized his research, co-authored with Richard Nunn. In the 1970s, Azrin {{was involved in the}} government review of BF Skinner’s Special Treatment and Rehabilitative Training research program at the Federal Medical Center for Prisoners in Missouri. He was named as one of three expert witnesses to review the program and findings, and defended the program as in line with the principles of behavioral psychology. Further research of Azrin’s include his development of the reciprocity counseling program for marriage counseling, and the concept of “overcorrection”, which uses positive punishment to correct undesired behaviors and foster desired behaviors.|$|R

The hiatus was somewhat new for the singer, who was almost constantly at work during {{the making of the}} band's first two albums. Welch explained further, saying, [...] "I was still going out and going to events but something wasn't quite right, I was spiraling a bit. I wasn't making myself happy. I wasn't stable." [...] It allowed Welch to reassess her musical approach to reflect her own life experiences, a change she credits to consulting with Taylor Swift. Overall, the recording sessions for How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful were conducted during a vulnerable period in Welch's life, making the album her most personal work thus far.|$|R
500|$|Filming {{began in}} February 2011, and {{concluded}} {{in the late}} summer (from the Northern Hemisphere's perspective). Filming largely took place in South Africa, particularly in Cape Town, but also in Durban and Springbok, Northern Cape. Outside South Africa the series was also filmed in Budapest, Hungary, and the UK. Among the separate locations the series takes place in, the New Delhi hotel in the first two episodes were shot in Cape Town, and the suburbs of Hout Bay doubled as Mozambique. Throughout the shoot the actors were allowed to perform the majority of their own stunts. Military advisors were on hand to teach the actors how to perform certain stunts, and to tell them what they did wrong during the take. The series includes a number of sex scenes, many of which were performed by Stapleton. In an interview with the British newspaper Metro, the actor stated [...] "I've done my fair share of nude scenes in the past {{but not as much as}} this – not as risqué, anyway," [...] adding that while he got used to it, he was always [...] "a <b>bit</b> <b>nervous</b> running around in front of 50 people with no clothes on. The sex scenes were usually with an actress I'd just met, so it's like: 'How's it going? I'm Sullivan and this is me nude.' It's nerve-racking at first but you have as much fun as you can with it." ...|$|E
500|$|The 2016 Summer Games marked Karma's Olympic début. She {{qualified}} for the women's individual archery tournament after receiving a wildcard from the Tripitate Commission in June 2016 based on her results at the 2015 Asian Archery Championships and the 2016 Archery World Cup qualification event in Antalya. In an interview with Kuensel before the Games, Karma said: [...] "I’m very excited and nervous at the same time. It is {{time for me to}} show what I’ve learned so far against the world’s best archers.”, and to Archer 360, [...] "While in the Sambodromo, I’m hoping to make my country proud.

Karma scored 81 points less than the leading competitor, South Korea's Choi Mi-sun. On 8 August she competed in the Round of 64 and was drawn against Tuyana Dashidorzhieva of Russia, the fifth ranking athlete in the ranking round. Karma tied with Dashidorzhieva in the first set before the Russian outscored her by three points to secure the second set. Karma and Dashidorzieva tied with each other in the game's following two sets until the Russian won the final set to win the match. This meant Karma was eliminated from the competition. After the events ended, Karma stated that despite being defeated she enjoyed the match and wanted to compete with archery champions whether she won or lost: [...] "I remember being a <b>bit</b> <b>nervous</b> with the big cameras in the blinds.

500|$|After scoring 114 not {{out in a}} club {{match against}} Riverside, Ponting became the {{youngest}} player to appear for Tasmania in a Sheffield Shield match, breaking Boon's record by 14 days. In November 1992, {{at the age of}} 17 years and 337 days, he batted at number four in the order against South Australia at the Adelaide Oval. Despite scoring 56 in a 127-run partnership with Boon, he could not prevent defeat, scoring just four in Tasmania's second innings. In his first match in Tasmania—this time against New South Wales—Ponting contributed 32 and 18 in a draw, before scoring 25 against Western Australia in a narrow loss. His first match in Sydney also marked the debut of future Australian opening bowler Glenn McGrath. At {{the end of the first}} day's play, Tasmania were 6/200, and Ponting was the only player to resist, reaching 98 not out. He eventually reached three figures the next morning, having endured three rain breaks and 54 minutes in the nineties. The century made him the youngest Tasmanian to score a first-class century, at 18 years and 40 days, eclipsing Boon's record of 19 years and 356 days. The next day he spoke about the achievement: [...] "I knew I had to be patient and wait for it to come [...] I wasn't that nervous last night, but I was a <b>bit</b> <b>nervous</b> this morning." [...] Dismissed for 125 out of a total of 298, Ponting scored 17 boundaries in his five-and-a-half-hour stay at the crease. Coach Greg Shipperd was impressed in what he saw: [...] "It was an excellent innings, one of classical stroke play. The way he freely put together a good, solid innings, showed that his potential is being realised. It was an indication, for him, of what it's like to go the extra step." [...] These performances lead Ponting to his List A debut on 13 December against Victoria in Devonport. He struggled, however, scoring 22 from 45 balls in Tasmania's defeat. His form, nonetheless, remained strong in first-class cricket, scoring another half-century, Ponting scored back-to-back centuries against Western Australia in Perth, the nation's fastest wicket, thus becoming the youngest batsmen in Shield history to score two centuries in a match. After setting a goal of scoring 500 first-class runs in the season, Ponting finished with 781 runs at 48.81. But his form in List A games were not as strong, aggregating 99 at 33 in four matches. Still, Ponting hit an unbeaten 59 from 52 balls against a touring England A side in Hobart. After the season's end, still aged 18, Ponting played seven four-day games for the Australian Academy, scoring 484 runs at 96.70.|$|E

40|$|AbstractBIT is a transmembrane {{glycoprotein}} {{with three}} immunoglobulin-like domains in its extracellular region and tyrosine phosphorylation sites in its cytosolic region. We have previously shown that BIT was tyrosine phosphorylated in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus {{in response to}} light exposure during the dark period, and suggested that it {{was involved in the}} light entrainment of the circadian clock. To further investigate the function of <b>BIT</b> in the <b>nervous</b> system, we examined the effect of photic stimulation on its tyrosine phosphorylation in the rat retina. It was found that the tyrosine phosphorylation level of BIT in the retina was higher in the light period than in the dark period. In addition, a light stimulation during the dark period resulted in a rapid phosphorylation of BIT and a subsequent association of BIT with SHP- 2. The phosphorylation state was quickly reverted when the light was turned off. The light-dependent phosphorylation of BIT was also observed in isolated cultured retinas, and this was blocked by a specific Src-family inhibitor, PP- 2. Immunohistochemical study showed that BIT was highly enriched in the inner and outer plexiform layers in the retina, where the immunoreactivity to anti-SHP- 2 antibody was also detected. These results suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of BIT is involved in neuronal transmission in the retina...|$|R
5000|$|They {{stayed and}} {{finished}} the shooting. Eventually, {{when they got to}} the hospital, the doctors wondered how Olena survived. The snake had actually been a venomous one. Shocked by the story, I called Olena and asked for details: she only laughed, in her beautiful manner, albeit maybe a <b>bit</b> more <b>nervous</b> than normally. She said she thought of this as a miracle, the result of Shevchenko's protection of her. She also said that she sensed this protection the entire time they worked on the film. Later, they all had to leave the TV channel. They were replaced by completely different people who started shooting completely different films. Meanwhile, the space for culture journalism where Olena had worked began to shrink rapidly since the early 2000s. Very few publications were still in Ukrainian, and even fewer offered the quality that fit Olena's publications. I don't know what one feels when the system squeezes him or her into the sidelines of profession, drives him or her into a hole like a billiard ball and all this person can do is watch helplessly indifferent cynical and semi-literate ignoramuses taking over his or her air time, pages in magazines, and number of characters. I assume Ukrainian intelligentsia experienced something similar back in the stifling 1970s: in the generation of my parents, the most widespread disease was cancer. The body was destroying itself under the pressure of long-lasting stress. I didn't follow her for a while. Then I found out that she had cancer... In terms of Ukrainian journalism, I will always remember her as a model of what that journalism had been in the brief happy time, and what it could be today. If it hadn't been for the war which we left unnoticed for 15 years. Olena was the victim of that war - nobody registered her as that, but, without a doubt, similar to a wide range of brilliant Ukrainian journalists of the 1990s, she was simply prevented from revealing her talent to the fullest extent. It would be a great idea to publish her most interesting pieces in a separate book. For the future journalists of the new Ukraine.« ...|$|R
