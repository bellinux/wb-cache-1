50|$|In {{the fall}} the birds migrate from their {{breeding}} grounds across the northern latitudes. They converge on the Northeastern United States south to Virginia starting in mid-August. Most blackpolls fly directly from northeastern North America over the Atlantic Ocean to their winter range. Data from nocturnal accidents, banding stations and sightings {{have shown that}} blackpolls are rare autumn migrants south of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, whereas north of Cape Hatteras they are common. Part of the fall migratory route of the <b>blackpoll</b> <b>warbler</b> is over the Atlantic Ocean from the northeastern United States to Puerto Rico, the Lesser Antilles, or northern South America. Island stopovers at Bermuda and other places are evidence of migratory pathways. To accomplish this flight, the <b>blackpoll</b> <b>warbler</b> nearly doubles its body mass in staging areas and takes advantage of a shift in prevailing wind direction to direct it to its destination. When they fly southward over the Atlantic they burn, 0.08 g of fat every hour. This route averages 3000 km over water, requiring a potentially nonstop flight of around 72 to 88 hours. They travel at a speed of about 27 mph. Blackpolls can weigh more than 20 g when they leave the United States and lose 4 or more grams {{by the time they}} reach South America. Some of the blackpolls land in Bermuda before going on. Some birds, often with lower body weights, do not make it.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Delineating habitat {{requirements}} and preferences of species {{is essential for}} conservation planning. We studied nest habitat use and effects of microsite vegetation characteristics on breeding success of yellow-rumped warblers (Dendroica coronata (L., 1766)), blackpoll warblers (Dendroica striata (J. R. Forster, 1772)), and white-throated sparrows (Zonotrichia albicollis (Gmelin, 1789)) in an area with a low extent (< 6 % of available land) of forest harvest in northwestern Newfoundland. During 2004 and 2005, 99 nests were located and monitored, and the characteristics of nest sites measured. Vegetation at yellow-rumped and <b>blackpoll</b> <b>warbler</b> nest sites differed from ran-dom sites; however, within used sites, no vegetation characteristics {{were significantly associated with}} success. White-throated sparrow nest sites contained more downed wood and less ground vegetation than did random sites; however, successful nests were associated with different variables than those that distinguished them from random sites, includ-ing less canopy cover and less woody debris. Thus, whereas yellow-rumped and blackpoll warblers used specific nest-site characteristics and white-throated sparrows had higher nest success associated with certain characteristics, the nest characteristics these birds appeared to choose did not have demonstrable fitness benefits.

40|$|Stable {{hydrogen}} isotopes (&# 948;D) {{in flight}} feathers were measured {{to investigate the}} summer origins of five species of boreal-breeding warblers captured during fall migration at Canadian Migration Monitoring Network (CMMN) stations spread across southern Canada. Mean &# 948;D varied among stations and species within stations, but there was broad overlap in &# 948;D values. Although isotope ratios indicate that migrants at each station come {{from a wide range}} of latitudes, they are unable to provide much longitudinal discrimination. Band recoveries are sparse, but indicate that in general western Canadian warblers move southeast in fall, eastern birds move southwest, and there is a transition zone in the Great Lakes region. Combining knowledge of migratory direction with isotope results increases discrimination of breeding areas. Isotope results support fall migratory movements by <b>Blackpoll</b> <b>Warbler</b> (Dendroica striata) and Northern Waterthrush (Seiurus novaboracensis) that are more easterly than for other species, and in all study species, birds from more northern regions passed through southern Canada later in the season. Migration monitoring stations capture birds from broad areas of latitude, and migrants passing through each province appear to come from largely different portions of the Canadian breeding range, so a few stations placed in each province should suffice collectively to sample birds from most of the boreal forest. Migration monitoring in southern Canada, therefore, has the potential to monitor status of boreal forest birds in Canada that are unsampled by other monitoring programs...|$|E
40|$|Montane forests provide {{habitat for}} unique assemblages of {{flora and fauna}} that {{contribute}} significantly to a region 2 ̆ 7 s biodiversity. Previous work indicates that montane forest ecosystems are exceedingly vulnerable {{to a host of}} anthropogenic stressors including climate change, atmospheric deposition, and recreation, to name a few. Montane forests and other high elevation ecosystems are considered to be among the first and most severely impacted by climate change. It is therefore, imperative to evaluate anthropogenic impacts on montane ecosystems and maintain reliable monitoring methods that are capable of tracking potential shifts in the distribution of species dependent on these systems. I surveyed birds at various distances from hiking trails in the White Mountain National Forest from 2006 – 2009 to determine whether existing monitoring programs, all of which are based on trail-centered surveys, are accurately reflecting bird abundance, abundance stability and recruitment. Contrary to previous studies, I found that recreational trails generally did not alter estimates of abundance, recruitment, abundance stability, and detection probability for five species of birds considered to be indicators of montane forest ecosystem integrity in northeastern North America. Therefore, trail-based monitoring programs for montane birds appear to accurately reflect dynamics of bird communities undisturbed by hiking trails. These conclusions were supported by my finding that the daily nest survival of a montane spruce-fir indicator species, <b>blackpoll</b> <b>warbler</b> (Steophaga striata), did not vary as a function of distance from trail. ^ I then used data from the White Mountain National Forest 2 ̆ 7 s montane bird monitoring program from 1994 through 2009 to assess potential shifts in the elevational distribution of montane birds in conjunction with documented habitat shifts in the region. My results provide evidence that low elevation forest birds have expanded their upper elevational boundary while high elevation birds have expanded their lower elevation boundary. These results highlight the complicated relationship between habitat, climate, and other anthropogenic stressors such as atmospheric deposition and that {{even in the face of}} climate change other stressors may be playing a significant role in shifts of species distributions. ^ Understanding how climate affects the reproductive ecology of montane organisms is an important step toward unraveling the potential mechanisms by which climate change will alter the distribution of these species. I used <b>blackpoll</b> <b>warbler</b> breeding data from the Green Mountains, VT from 1994 to 2003 to determine if temporal variation in climate influenced blackpoll nesting initiation and found that years with warm Mays and typical precipitation lead to earlier nest initiation. I also examined the effect of spatial variation in climate on blackpoll reproductive ecology and demography. I found a gradient in habitat quality associated with the spatial variation in climate along an elevation gradient. Blackpolls were less abundant, younger, had lower pairing success, lower daily nest survival, higher nest predator occupancy, and lower fecundity at lower elevations. The climatic conditions at these lower elevations represent the climatic conditions predicted to encompass increasingly larger portions of montane areas. Collectively, these findings contribute to filling in a dearth of knowledge regarding management and an understanding of how species dependent on montane ecosystems are responding to climate change. ...|$|E

40|$|Managing {{oxidative}} stress {{is an important}} physiological function for all aerobic organisms, particularly during periods of prolonged high metabolic activity, such as long-distance migration. However, no previous study has investigated the oxidative status of songbirds {{at different stages of}} migration, whether that oxidative status depends on the condition of the birds, how birds use their condition in concert with access to free water to make stopover decisions, or the effects of oxidative challenges like flight on subsequent reproduction. Additionally, scientists undertaking such research are commonly expected to disseminate their results as a Broader Impact of their studies - typically to secure research funding - and often struggle to do so, given that they are not usually trained in non-technical communication or public engagement. In this dissertation, I introduce the fundamentals of oxidative balance in flying songbirds (Chapter 1), discuss physiological factors affecting the condition and behavior of migratory songbirds on stopover (Chapters 2 and 3), describe the impact of dietary antioxidants and flight exercise on songbird reproduction (Chapter 4), and present a framework of guiding principles to help researchers communicate their science (Chapter 5). Development of this framework influenced the style and approach of the dissertation as a whole, with each chapter’s organization and figure design benefiting from lessons transferrable from communication with non-scientist audiences to communication with professional peers. To investigate the relationship between energy stores and oxidative status of long-distance migratory birds on stopover, I drew blood samples from two species of Neotropical migrant (<b>Blackpoll</b> <b>Warbler,</b> Setophaga striata, and Red-eyed Vireo, Vireo olivaceus) with differing migration strategies during autumn migration on Block Island, USA, and a species of trans-Saharan migrant (Garden Warbler, Sylvia borin) during spring migration on the island of Ponza, Italy; I found fat stores to be positively correlated with circulating antioxidant capacity in Blackpoll Warblers and Red-eyed Vireos and positively correlated with circulating lipid oxidation levels in all three species. Among Garden Warblers, oxidative damage levels decreased with time on stopover (up to 8 nights). Thus, the physiological strategy of migrating songbirds appears to be to (1) build prophylactic antioxidant capacity in concert with fuel stores at stopover sites before a long-distance flight, and (2) repair oxidative damage while refueling at stopover sites after long-distance flight. To assess the contribution of free water to migratory birds’ stopover decisions, I captured 61 free-living Garden Warblers in spring at a frequently used stopover site in the Mediterranean Sea, housed them with or without drinking water, and measured nocturnal restlessness (Zugunruhe) in relation to energy stores at capture; water-deprived birds of high fat score showed the highest Zugunruhe activity, suggesting that individuals with higher fat scores might be expected, regardless of flight muscle size, to depart a dry stopover site more readily than a site with freely available water. To examine how songbirds use nutrition to manage trade-offs in antioxidant allocation between endurance flight and subsequent reproduction, I performed a controlled experiment with Zebra Finches (Taeniopygia guttata), using four treatment groups of birds that either were or were not provided a water- and lipid-soluble antioxidant-supplemented diet and were or were not trained to perform daily endurance flight for 6 weeks before breeding; I found that exercised birds had higher oxidative damage levels than non-exercised birds after flight training, supplementation with water-soluble antioxidants decreased the deposition of lipid-soluble antioxidants to eggs and yolk size, and flight exercise lowered deposition of lutein but not vitamin E to eggs. These results mechanistically demonstrate potential carry-over effects of nutrition and exertion on the capacity of songbirds to provision eggs with important nutrients after long-distance flights. To address how the potential for “impact” of varied Broader Impacts dissemination activities can be critically assessed during proposal writing and peer review, I combined the experiences of successful practitioners with communication theory to synthesize a five-point framework; this “Broader Impacts Impact Framework” summarizes best practices in communication and outreach, can be easily used by scientists during proposal writing and review, and focuses on five main factors: who, why, what, how, and with whom...|$|E
