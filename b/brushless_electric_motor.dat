5000|$|There are {{no visible}} moving blades in this fan. The blade is hidden inside the {{pedestal}} of the fan. In 2009 James Dyson first introduces a new {{innovation in the}} bladeless fan by adding air-multiplier technology. This Dyson air-multiplier fan generates airflow up to 55mph. [...] The fan contains a <b>brushless</b> <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> and this motor rotates nine asymmetrical aligned blades that attach with a rotor. Usually, the upper frame of this fan is ring shaped. The frame is not flat; rather it is manufactured such that the edge can create a curve of a 16-degree angle slope.The air flows through the channel in the pedestal of the fan when the motor is turned on. After that, the air flows through the hollow tube. Then the air is shot out through 16-mm slits. This air flows smoothly, rather than turbulently as with a blade fan. The curvature of the inner wall of the fan creates an area of negative pressure - like an airplane wing - to draw more air into the flow, hence [...] "multiplying" [...] it. This property of the air is called inducement. Further, the air surrounding {{the edges of the}} fan also begins to flow with the direction of the breeze, or is [...] "entrained" [...] to it. Dyson claims that the air-multiplier technology increases the output of the air flowing through the tube by at least 15 times compared to the airflow put out by a traditional bladed fan.|$|E

Later, Ford Motor Company President and CEO Alan Mulally visited the School of Engineering and talked with the students regarding the auto industry and answered questions about the technological, financial, cultural and political realities facing Ford after being bailed out by the US Congress alongside others of the [...] "Big Three". The Ecohawks planned to recycle older cars to run on greener technologies thereby eliminating the energy needed for production; the recycle of the vehicle itself prevented the release of a few tons of carbon to the atmosphere. The team researched advanced technologies in the small scale including NiMH, LiCoO2, LiFePO4 batteries. The group used scaled down RC Cars for testing and validation. Research also conceptualised a parallel hybrid design that used a small internal combustion engine running on the a planned biodiesel blend and a <b>brushless</b> <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> allowing for the doubling of torque. Research with ECM, hydrogen fuel cells and Metal hydride storage tanks, funded by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) grant that led to the group design an infrastructure with Smart grid technologies to be showcased in Washington, DC and converted more vehicle. The groups designs were adopted by the university when the KU Libraries started using vehicles that were converted by the ecohawks. The KU Libraries mail vehicle travelled about 22 miles on average on a given day. The electric vehicle travels 80 to 90 miles before a recharge.
