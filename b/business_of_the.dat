5|$|Negroes are not {{barred from}} {{organized}} baseball by the commissioner {{and never have}} been in the 21years I have served.

5|$|As {{a result}} of {{reforming}} actions such as the Bill of Middlesex, the Common Pleas became increasingly conservative and resistant to King's Bench changes because of the impact they had on the <b>business</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Common Pleas. This was best emphasised by Slade's Case, a struggle between {{the old and new}} forms of suing for breach of contract; although an equilibrium between the common law courts was finally reached, it eventually led to their dissolution with the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873, and merger into a single High Court of Justice.|$|E

5|$|As the Chief Executive of the State of Maryland, the Governor {{heads the}} {{executive}} branch of government, which includes all state executive departments and agencies, as well as advisory boards, commissions, committees, and task forces. The main constitutional responsibility of the Governor of Maryland, and any other State's chief executive, is to carry out the <b>business</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state and to enforce the laws passed by the Legislature. The Governor also has some say in these laws, since the Governor has the ability to veto any bill sent to his or her desk by the Maryland General Assembly, though the Assembly may override that veto. The Governor is also given a number of more specific powers as relates to appropriations of state funds, the appointment of state officials, and also a variety of less prominent and less commonly utilized powers.|$|E
5|$|At first, the revolutionaries {{used the}} {{constitutional}} machinery {{of the old}} confederal republic. They resumed where they had left off after the purge in 1787 of Patriot regents, taking over {{the offices of the}} Orangist regents that were now purged in their turn. Though the political make-up of the States-General changed appreciably because of this change in personnel, it retained a number of defenders of the old particularist interests. The first order of <b>business</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> revolutionaries therefore was to strive for the reform of the confederal state, with its discrimination of the Generality Lands, and of particular minorities (Catholics, Jews), {{in the direction of a}} unitary state, in which the minorities would be emancipated, and the old entrenched interests superseded by a more democratic political order. As a first step the representatives of Brabant were admitted to the States-General.|$|E
5|$|Manchester City's first {{transfer}} <b>business</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> season brought goalkeeper Ken Mulhearn to {{the club}} from Stockport County on 21 September, a deal that involved City's back-up goalkeeper Alan Ogley moving in the opposite direction. Harry Dowd kept goal in the next match, a 1–0 defeat at Arsenal, but then dislocated a finger, prompting a debut for Mulhearn in the season's first Manchester derby. Mulhearn was reputedly so nervous before the match that Allison locked him in the medical room until he calmed down. Colin Bell scored the opener after five minutes, but two Bobby Charlton goals meant a win for Manchester United. In {{the second half of}} the match, Bowles exchanged punches with Brian Kidd, though neither man was sent off, largely thanks to the intervention of their respective captains. The derby loss was followed by a third consecutive defeat, at Sunderland.|$|E

5|$|Padayappa was {{released}} on 10 April 1999 {{on the eve of}} Tamil New Year's day. This was the first Tamil film to be released worldwide without the involvement of distributors. It was also the first Tamil film to be released worldwide with 210 prints, and 700,000 audio cassettes. The film's rights in Japan were sold for US$50,000, which was the highest an Indian film fetched for commercial release in 1999. Co-producer Thenappan registered the film posters as a Class 34 trademark in 1998, to be used for trademarking such items as beedis, cigarettes, cheroots and tobacco, making it the first instance of brand extension in the Tamil film industry. The pre-release <b>business</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> film's overseas rights amounted to 30 million. According to an estimate by trade analyst Sreedhar Pillai, the value of the theatrical and satellite rights for Padayappa was approximately 20 million.|$|E
5|$|The Linguistic Society of America (LSA) is {{a learned}} {{society for the}} field of linguistics. Founded {{at the end of}} 1924 in New York City, the LSA works to promote the {{scientific}} study of language. The Society publishes two scholarly journals, Language and the open access journal Semantics and Pragmatics. Its annual meetings, held every winter, foster discussion amongst its members through the presentation of peer-reviewed research, as well as conducting official <b>business</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Society. Since 1928, the LSA has offered training to linguists through courses held at its biennial Linguistic Institutes held in the summer. The LSA and its 3,500 members work to raise awareness of linguistic issues with the public and contributes to policy debates on issues including bilingual education and the preservation of endangered languages.|$|E
5|$|The Provisional Legislature met for two {{sessions}} in late 1848 and early 1849. The first session, from December 5 to December 13, never formally organized {{as so many}} of the representatives had traveled south for the California Gold Rush. Beginning on February 5, a session was organized that conducted the final <b>business</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Provisional Government. The session lasted until February 16. During this session a law forbidding the sale of firearms and supplies to Native Americans was repealed, and a law was passed to authorize the minting of gold coins. The law concerning the coins allowed for the creation of the Beaver Coins, which had a higher gold content than United States minted coins. Less than a month later, when the new territorial governor Joseph Lane arrived, however, he rescinded the law as unconstitutional and the coins were collected and removed from circulation. For the legislative session Ralph Wilcox was chosen as speaker, but he resigned from the post. Stephen Meek served as the doorkeeper, William G. T’Vault as a clerk, and William Holmes as sergeant at arms.|$|E

5|$|The {{contacts}} of Thomas Goodman enabled Erasmus {{to serve}} a seven-year apprenticeship in London with a poultry merchant, John Saunders, and he was made a freeman of the Grocers' Company on 10 February 1635. By 1631 Roger Smith had become an alderman of the City of London and in 1635 he was knighted; Erasmus followed in his father's footsteps, being elected an alderman in 1657, but preferred to pay a fine of £420 {{in order to be}} released from the duties of office. In these early years he was also unwilling to have much involvement in the <b>business</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Grocers' Company, although this changed later in life: the cause of his initial reluctance may have been his preference to concentrate on acquiring his wealth. According to the records of the Aldermen of the City of London, Erasmus was Member of Parliament for Ardee in County Louth between 1665 and 1666.|$|E
5|$|The dignitaries and canons {{constituted}} the chapter {{and had the}} primary role of aiding the bishop in the governance of the diocese. Often the bishop was the titular head of the chapter only and was excluded from its decision-making processes, the chapter being led by the dean as its superior. As the diocese of Moray based its constitution on that of Lincoln Cathedral, the bishop was allowed to participate within the chapter but only as an ordinary canon. Moray was not unique in this: the bishops of Aberdeen, Brechin, Caithness, Orkney and Ross were also canons in their own chapters. Each morning, the canons held a meeting in the chapterhouse where a chapter from the canonical rule book of St Benedict was read before the <b>business</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> day was discussed.|$|E
5|$|The {{diocese of}} York took {{advantage}} of Stigand's difficulties with the papacy and encroached on the suffragans, or bishops owing obedience to an archbishop, normally subject to Canterbury. York had long been held in common with Worcester, but during the period when Stigand was excommunicated, the see of York also claimed oversight over the sees of Lichfield and Dorchester. In 1062, however, papal legates of Alexander II came to England. They did not depose Stigand, and even consulted with him and treated him as archbishop. He was allowed to attend the council they held and was an active participant with the legates in the <b>business</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> council.|$|E

5|$|The first {{scientific}} {{description of}} the Portuguese dogfish was published by Portuguese zoologists José Vicente Barbosa du Bocage and Félix António de Brito Capello, in an 1864 issue of Proceedings of the General Meetings for Scientific <b>Business</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Zoological Society of London. They created the new genus Centroscymnus for this shark, and gave it the specific epithet coelolepis, derived from the Greek koilos ("hollow") and lepis ("fish scale") and referring {{to the structure of}} the dermal denticles. The type specimen, caught off Portugal, has since been destroyed in a fire.|$|E
5|$|The {{opening of}} the council took place on 21 March 1148 at Reims Cathedral on a Sunday. Eugene and his attendants had arrived in Reims by 9 March. The main <b>business</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> council was the debate {{on a number of}} canons, or rules, for the church that would be announced. Most of these were not new decrees, having been promulgated by Eugene's {{predecessor}} at the councils of Reims in 1131 and at the Lateran council of 1139. All of the proposed canons were approved, except for one on clerical attire which was opposed by Rainald of Dassel and other German ecclesiastics. This canon had prohibited cloaks made of fur. Another canon condemning clerical marriage was greeted with amusement, as the council members felt that all clergy should already know that marriage was forbidden to them.|$|E
5|$|During the 15th century, {{the common}} law courts were {{challenged}} by the civil law and equity found in the Chancery and similar courts. These courts and legal methods were much faster than {{the common law}} courts, so lawyers and claimants flocked to them. This was perceived {{as a threat to}} the common law courts, for good reason; between 1460 and 1540, the <b>business</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> common law courts significantly dropped, while the Chancery's cases rose massively in number. In reaction to this, the Court of King's Bench developed its own, faster system, intent on winning cases back, and through procedures such as the Writ of Quominus and Bill of Middlesex acquired a wider jurisdiction. While this succeeded in forming an equilibrium between the old common law courts and the new courts, it was viewed with suspicion by the Common Pleas, who became highly reactionary to the changes the King's Bench attempted to introduce. When the King's Bench attempted to use the Bill of Middlesex to widen its jurisdiction, the Common Pleas became increasingly conservative in its attempts to avoid ceding cases. This was limited by the fact that the three Common Pleas prothonotaries could not agree on how to cut costs, leaving the court both expensive and of limited malleability while the King's Bench became faster, cheaper and more varied in its jurisdiction.|$|E
