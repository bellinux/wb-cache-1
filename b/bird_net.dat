40|$|Bird deaths {{resulting}} from toxic materials in containment ponds are causing authorities {{to insist that}} action be taken to eliminate this hazard to avian wildlife. Bird control at containment pond sites is achieved by two well-known but poorly understood aversion techniques: hazing systems (sound/visual) and stretch wire. The limiting condition of either approach is that resident birds rapidly habituate while some migrating species are totally unaffected. Consequently, one {{must be able to}} accept degrees of control with an understanding of the behavior of the species involved. Birdproofing is achieved by covering an entire pond with <b>bird</b> <b>net.</b> This presentation discusses several aspects of bird netting including selection of net, with consideration of UV degradation, weather conditions and species, design of support systems, installation procedures, attachment techniques, abrasion limitations, and a brief summary of hanging and stretch-wire techniques...|$|E
40|$|Okra {{was grown}} in organic and {{conventional}} systems. The organic plots included an intercrop system, using onion in alternate rows. Well-decomposed manure {{was used as}} a soil amendment, and mulching was done with cane straw. A <b>bird</b> <b>net</b> prevented damage by birds to seeds. Neem extract was applied as and when needed based on economic threshold values of important pests. Parameters studied included plant height, leaf area index, soil pH, soil NPK, and yield and quality of harvested okra fruits. Okra was grown in the conventional plots in a monocrop system, fertilised with synthetic NPK fertilisers, and sprayed with synthetic pesticides. Comparison of soil, plant and yield parameters showed that leaf area index, plant height (from week 10) and fruit yield and quality were higher in the organic system compared to the conventional system, while pest damage was equal in the two systems. Soil pH and phosphorus levels were lower in the organic plots, while available nitrogen and potassium were higher in the organic plots...|$|E
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} determine the effects of shade netting on growth, oil yield and compound composition of fever tea (Lippia javaica). The treatments were nine shade nets of different light intensities (100 % <b>bird</b> <b>net,</b> 40 % green, 10, 12 and 18 % white and 30, 40, 55 and 70 % black). The layout used was a completely randomized design. The parameters measured were shoot width, fresh shoot mass, the number of plants flowered, plant height and photosynthetically active radiation. Shade netting did not have any effect on the shoot width of L. javanica. Eighteen percent white net was best suited to produce fresh shoot mass, whereas 55 % black net, 40 % black net and 10 % white net produced lower fresh shoot mass. More plants that flowered were obtained under 70 % black net than those grown under 30 % black net. The number of plants that flowered increased from 22 to 35 with an increase in shading density. The height of plants was not affected by shade netting at 49 DAT. However, at 59 and 67 DAT, the height of the plants was greater under low light intensities (40, 55, and 70 % black nets) than that of high light intensity (30 % black). Twelve percent white net had the greatest plant height at 102 DAT. Shade netting significantly affected the adsorption and utilization of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) above, across and below the plants at 102 DAT. Hundred percent <b>bird</b> <b>net</b> had the greatest amount of light intercepted above, across and below the plants. The amount of light intercepted above, below and across the plants was lower for lower shading intensity (30 % black) than that of higher shading intensities (40 %, 55 % and 70 % black). To determine shade-netting effect on oil yield and compound composition, fresh leaves (± 200 g) of L. javanica were sampled from each shade net for essential oil extraction by hydrodistillation. The oil yield ranged from 0. 29 % to 0. 41 %. The oil had a clear to yellowish brown colour. No significant differences were detected for oil yield amongst the shade nets. The chemical compound analysis was carried out by GC/MS. The chemical compounds identified in the essential oil were a -pinene, sebinen, myrcene, 1. 8 myrcene, ipsenone, ipsedienone, b -caryophyllen and germacrene-D. L. javanica plants grown under 10 % white net, resulted in significantly higher myrcene content (15. 7 %) as compared to plants grown in other shade nets. Shade netting did not have any effect on the composition of á-pinene, sebinene, 1. 8 myrcene, ipsenone, ipsedienone, b -caryophyllen and germacrene-D. For commercial usage of myrcene, white net (10 %) would be best suited for L. javanica production. To obtain information about indigenous knowledge of L. javanica, a survey was carried out among street traders, traditional healers, hawkers and farmers in Gauteng. The age group was between 20 and 73. The majority of respondents, who were self employed, were traditional healers followed by farmers. Most (98 %) of the respondents indicated that they collected L. javanica from the veld by cutting the plant, whereas other respondents uprooted the whole plant when harvesting. Amongst the different uses of L. javanica mentioned, treatment of colds and coughs through steaming was stated by most (47 %) of the respondents. Most (88 %) of the respondents felt that it was important to conserve the plant for future generations and also to prevent the plant from becoming extinct. Traditional healers knew the uses and other important aspects of L. javanica than the farmers. Dissertation (M Inst Agrar (Agronomy)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2007.

40|$|Rice {{is often}} damaged by birds, {{especially}} sparrows, in Asia. <b>Bird</b> <b>nets</b> are sometimes used as countermeasures; however {{this approach is}} expensive and labor intensive. For this reason, farmers generally eschew <b>bird</b> <b>nets,</b> even though no alternative countermeasures are available. This study focused on exploiting the bird behavior of scanning for predators to reduce crop damage. When birds forage for seeds on the ground they often stop pecking and briefly raise their heads, apparently to scan for predators. Low visibility habitats increase scanning behavior and increased scanning behavior reduces habitat quality from the bird’s perspective; therefore, this study tested the relationship between rice damage rate and visibility at the periphery of rice fields, where tree sparrows rest after feeding. Overall, low visibility reduced damage to rice. Because visibility was mainly affected by weeds, weed management techniques contribute to crop damage management. To reduce damage, weeding can be decreased; therefore, this technique is cost- and labor-efficient...|$|R

50|$|For example, damage by birds or rabbits to {{ornamental}} shrubs or garden {{plants can}} be reduced inexpensively by placing <b>bird</b> <b>netting</b> over the plants to keep the pests away. On the other hand, fencing out deer from a lawn or garden can be more costly. Materials needed for exclusion will depend upon the species causing the problem. Large mammals can be excluded with woven wire fences, poly-tape fences, and electric fences; but many communities forbid the use of electric fencing in their jurisdictions. Small mammals and some birds can be excluded with netting, tarp, hardware cloth or any other suitable material; nets come in different weave sizes suitable for different animals to be excluded.|$|R
