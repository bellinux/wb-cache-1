50|$|The chassis of Majestic Major was an {{evolution}} of the design introduced in 1937 with the Daimler New Fifteen. As with the New Fifteen and several derivatives in between, the Majestic Major had a cruciform-braced <b>box-section</b> <b>frame</b> with conventional coil-sprung independent front suspension and a live rear axle on semi-elliptic leaf springs. As with the Majestic, there were four-wheel Dunlop disc brakes with a vacuum servo.|$|E
50|$|Designed by Fritz Fiedler, the 326 {{featured}} a <b>box-section</b> <b>frame</b> that could readily be adapted for derivative models. Also innovative were the torsion bar rear suspension, {{inspired by the}} dead axle suspension of the Citroën Traction Avant, and the hydraulic braking system, {{the first to be}} used on a BMW car. Styled by Peter Schimanowski, the 326 was offered as a four-door sedan and as a two- or four-door cabriolet. The 326 sedan was the first BMW available with four doors. The BMW 320, BMW 321, BMW 327, and BMW 335 were based on the 326. The streamlined form of the body contrasted with previous relatively upright BMWs: drag was presumably reduced further by including a fixed cover over the spare wheel at the back.|$|E
5000|$|The main {{chassis member}} is a welded <b>box-section</b> <b>frame.</b> IWL scooters {{had a long}} {{wheelbase}} and the Troll 1 was taller than its predecessors, which made the seating position more comfortable but made the machine more vulnerable to crosswinds. In March 1964 Der deutsche Straßenverkehr strongly criticised this shortcoming, {{but in the same}} year Motor Jahr played it down by claiming [...] "Die Seitenwindempfindlichkeit des „Troll“ liegt in normalen Grenzen. Er reagiert auf Seitenböen nicht anders als durchschnittliche Zweiradfahrzeuge und is deshalb trotz seiner etwas höheren Schwerpunktlage auch in solchen Situationen risikilos zu fahren.". ("The Trolls crosswind stability lies within normal limits. It reacts to side gusts no differently than average two-wheeled vehicles and therefore despite a somewhat higher centre of gravity it is safe to ride in such conditions.") Customers were not fooled, and the Troll 1s crosswind instability damaged its reputation and was partly responsible for the model selling less well than its predecessors.|$|E

25|$|The chassis was a widened and {{reinforced}} Healey Silverstone <b>box-section</b> ladder-type steel <b>frame.</b> Independent front suspension, also Healey Silverstone, was by coil springs, trailing link, and a sway bar. The rear suspension featured Nash's rear end and coil springs replaced the Silverstone’s leaf springs, while the beam axle was located by Panhard rod.|$|R
2500|$|A {{more popular}} and {{practical}} high-performance {{model for the}} street was introduced in 1985, the FZ750. It was an innovative 750cc four-stroke inline four cylinder model. It was the first motorcycle to feature a five valve cylinder head, something Yamaha became well known for. [...] It also featured a cylinder block canted forward at 45 degrees, and a <b>box-section</b> steel perimeter <b>frame.</b> [...] Production of the FZ continued until 1991.|$|R
5000|$|The {{most famous}} motocycles made by Mars were {{the series of}} {{motorcycles}} called the Weiße Mars ("White Mars"), which included the A 20, A 23, MA 25, MA 27, and MA 1000 Sport. Designed by Claus Franzenburg, the A 20 and its derivatives had a <b>box-section</b> <b>frame</b> connecting the headstock to the rear wheel and housing the transmission and drive chain, while the engine was mounted in a subframe below. The flat-twin engine was designed by Franzenburg and manufactured for Mars by aircraft engine builder Maybach. It was mounted with its cylinders {{in line with the}} frame. was started with a hand crank, and had an enclosed primary drive to the transmission. The A 20, with a trailing-link fork, was made from 1920 to 1925; the MA 1000 Sport, with a girder fork and recirculating lubrication system in the engine, was made in 1928. Despite being called the [...] "White Mars", the motorcycles were also available in red and green.|$|E
5000|$|The G4 was a {{development}} of the G1, launched in 1926. All had an 8-cylinder inline engine, {{in the first three}} years of 5018 cc (306.2 cu in) displacement delivering [...] It was a 6x4 configuration with four-speed transmission (synchronised upper gears) that transferred drive to all four rear wheels via self-locking differentials, the front wheels did not drive. The rear wheels were attached to two rigid axles 950 mm apart, which were suspended in joint semi-elliptic leaf springs. The front axle was rigid with semi-elliptic springs. All six wheels had hydraulic brakes with servo assistance. The top speed was only 67 km/h, limited by the type of all-terrain tyres. Only 11 of these vehicles were delivered to the Wehrmacht. The car used an elongated <b>box-section</b> <b>frame</b> that allowed for generous interior room. Comfortable seating for up to seven was provided by benches (front and rear) and one middle row of two with separate arm rests.The vehicles were first delivered to the SS for use by Hitler and his adjutants painted with gloss gray bodies over gloss black fenders and running boards but, by the end of the war, they had all received anti-reflective matte and/or camouflage finishes in accordance with their military purpose. Many G4 vehicles belonging to the highest-ranking party members also featured rear-facing spotlights to be used to temporarily blind unauthorized drivers who followed too closely.|$|E
50|$|All trucks of {{the series}} share a modular design. They have a torsionally rigid <b>box-section</b> <b>frame</b> with highly mobile axles linked to the frame via coil springs. The engine is mounted inside the forward-control cab, which is {{separated}} into a driver and engine compartment by a firewall. As a distinctive feature, the engine is located {{to the rear of}} the driver compartment instead of beneath it. This way, the total height could be kept below 2.9 m, which means the trucks can be transported on standard railway flatcars. The characteristic, cut-away corners of the otherwise box-shaped cab ensure compliance with the railway loading gauge. The cab of the first batch does not tilt forward for maintenance because the vehicles were still based on the amphibious prototypes. The tilting cab was only introduced with the second batch in the mid-80s. The engine powers the front and rear axles via a torque converter, semi-automatic transmission and a transfer case. In the first batch KAT I, these components form a single, special unit. The later KAT I A1 series uses cheaper mass-produced, standard truck components. At the same time, this allowed to raise the number of gears from six to 16, and the theoretical top speed from 90 to about 130 km/h. This in turn led to much lower engine speeds at the usual top speed of 80 km/h, lowering fuel consumption. Vehicle voltage is standard 24 Volts. The tow hitch is a standard NATO coupling suitable for towing trailers even in difficult terrain, although they must be equipped with the matching lunette ring.|$|E
25|$|The curved-tube chassis was {{the more}} {{controversial}} of the two novel ideas. The existing Cooper 500 chassis design process {{had been one of}} evolution since the earliest production 500s rolled out of the Surbiton works in 1947, and had been based on simple, traditional twin longitudinal <b>box-section</b> ladder <b>frame.</b> With the introduction of the Mark V in 1950 this was augmented by a beefed-up and stiffened body support structure, creating a semi-space frame chassis. This was refined further over the next two years, with the Mark VI marking a switch to equally sized tubular upper and lower longerons, and the Mark VIIA introducing tubular upright sections as well. However, for 1953's Mark VIII the Coopers decided to start afresh with a completely new chassis design.|$|R
50|$|The {{aircraft}} fuselage is {{made with}} an aluminum <b>box-section</b> main <b>frame</b> and 4130 steel tubing for the twin tail booms and mounts an 8.84 m diameter rotor. The 1.21 m wide cabin is made from composites and can be flown doors-on or with the doors removed. The main landing gear legs are made from composites and the nose wheel is of the free-castering type, with steering accomplished by main wheel differential braking using the fitted hydraulic toe brakes. Because the aircraft is designed for the harsh operating conditions of the Australian outback the radiator is mounted above the engine, to preclude damage and a 130 L fuel tank gives extra range. The Kruza has an empty weight of 360 kg and a gross weight of 600 kg, giving a useful load of 240 kg.|$|R
