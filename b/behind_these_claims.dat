Obesity is the main precursor for metabolic syndrome that can be targeted in developing various therapies. With this view, several physical, psychological, pharmaceutical and dietary therapies have been proposed for the management of obesity. However, dietary strategies found more appropriate without any adverse health effects. Application of probiotics and prebiotics as biotherapeutics is the new emerging area in developing dietary strategies and many people are interested in learning the facts <b>behind</b> <b>these</b> health <b>claims.</b> Recent studies established the role of probiotics and prebiotics in weight management with possible mechanisms of improved microbial balance, decreased food intake, decreased abdominal adiposity and increased mucosal integrity with decreased inflammatory tone. Hence, the above "Pharmaco-nutritional" approach has been selected and extensively reviewed to gain thorough knowledge on putative mechanisms of probiotic and prebiotic action in order to develop dietary strategies for the management of metabolic syndrome...|$|R

There is now robust evidence that one type of mineral wealth, petroleum, has at least three harmful effects: it tends to make authoritarian regimes more durable, to increase certain types of corruption, and to help trigger violent conflict in low and middle income countries.

A summary of Braudel’s theses and evaluations by leading historians suggest that while Braudel’s book La Méditerranée et le monde méditerranéen à l’époque de Philippe II may have as many errors as insights, it remains alive as a source of inspiration for the history of early modern Italy, prior to the establishment of the nation state. By subordinating political history to all aspects of life through the investigative methodology of the social sciences and by changing {{the way we think about}} time, space, and subject matter in history, Braudel’s vision provides a point of departure both to look back at the historiographical tradition before the volume was first published in 1949 and again at its second edition in 1966, as well as to scan forward to the historiography it has spawned...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The Turing Machine {{model of}} {{computation}} captures {{only one of}} its fundamental tenets – the manipulation of symbols. Through this simplification it has relegated two important aspects of computation – time and energy – to the sidelines of computer science. This is unfortunate, because time and energy harbor the largest challenges to {{life as we know}} it, and are therefore key reasons why intelligence exists. As a result, time and energy must {{be an integral part of}} any serious analysis and theory of mind and thought. Following Turing's tradition, in a misguided effort to strengthen computer science as a science, an overemphasis on mathematical formalization continued as an accepted approach, eventually becoming the norm. The side effects include artificial intelligence research largely losing its focus, and a significant slowdown in progress towards understanding intelligence as a phenomenon.

We provide a simple network growth model, which matches the degree distributions of the non-scale-free networks by breaking the preferential attachment paradigm with a second internal linking process.

40|$|Access {{restricted}} to the OSU CommunityThis dissertation explores a corpus of formal, published dialogues between physicists, cognitive scientists, and Buddhist thinkers that have developed {{over the past four}} decades. These dialogues have been initiated by and promoted through the work of individual scholars, like between genetic-biologist-turned-monk Matthieu Ricard and physicist Trin Xuan Thuan; academic institutions like Stanfords Center for Compassion and Altruism Research and Education (CCARE); academic labs like Richard Davidson's Lab for Affective Neuroscience at the University of Wisconsin Madison; and independent organizations like the Mind and Life institute, a project founded by scientist Francisco Varela and businessman R. Adam Engle to record dialogues between the Dalai Lama and prominent scientists. In his 2008 book, Buddhism and Science, University of Michigan religious studies scholar Donald Lopez Jr. presents an historical timeline of the contact between Buddhism and Science, starting his analysis with a speech delivered {{by a member of the}} London Missionary Society in winter of 1870 - 71, with a central claim that "over the past 150 years, claims for the compatibility of Buddhism and Science have remained remarkably similar, both in their content and their rhetorical form," despite any changes to the definitions of both epistemologies over time. While the individual motivations <b>behind</b> <b>these</b> compatibility <b>claims</b> vary, <b>these</b> <b>claims</b> have continued to circulate, developing into a full-fledged public dialogue over the past four decades. This research uses discourse analytic tools related to intertextuality and stance-construction, to make visible the rhetorical negotiation of epistemic boundaries. I situate this analysis within rhetorical studies, by positing a synthesis of Kenneth Burke's conception of rhetorical motives and Chaïm Perelman's theories of dissociation and association. In particular, I demonstrate how participants in these dialogues dissociate Buddhism from 'religion' in tandem with (and often prior to specific instances of) association. By breaking the links between Buddhism and religious terminology like 'dogma', 'faith', and 'belief', interlocutors create space to redefine and re-identify Buddhism vis-á-vis scientific disciplines. As speakers orient towards novel associations, they enact different levels of investment and what I term associative motives for engagement. These dissociations and novel associations have distinct political and cultural ramifications and meanings, because they involve changes to either one or both systems of thought. In panicular, some people identifying with the Tibetan culture, government in-exile, and monastic world have articulated fears that Tibetan culture will eventually be lost in decontextualizing and translating Buddhist ideas to a secular, scientific discourse. Some in scientific communities have protested events like the Dalai Lama's talk at the 2005 Society for Neuroscience Convention in Washington DC, arguing that a religious figure has no place in a scientific meeting and framing Buddhism as anti-scientific, countering those who couch Buddhism not as a religion, but as a 'science of the mind', 'contemplative science', or 'inner science'. Thus, while those public figures engaged in these dialogues often treat their goals as transcendent and teleological, they are conducted amidst political, social, and cultural controversy...|$|R

40|$|The {{importance}} of attaining adequate macronutrient and micronutrient intake throughout {{the life course}} {{is essential for the}} maintenance of health. Claims have been made for the benefits of micronutrient supplementation in later life, and this review considers the strength of the evidence <b>behind</b> <b>these</b> <b>claims</b> focusing on studies with cardiovascular, cancer, eye health, immune, and cognitive end points. While observational data suggest the presence of a link between dietary micronutrient intake and health outcomes, evidence from large randomized controlled trials does not support the use of antioxidant vitamin or mineral supplements among well-nourished older populations. Moreover, there is evidence of possible adverse affects of micronutrient supplementation. In conclusion, the considerable enthusiasm for the use of micronutrient, especially antioxidant, supplements as anti-aging treatments or as treatments for specific diseases of later life is not supported by the currently available scientific literature.

40|$|Abstract. Hellaby & Dray have {{recently}} claimed that matter conservation fails under {{a change of}} signature, compounding earlier claims that the standard junction conditions for signature change are unnecessary. In fact, if the field equations are satisfied, then the junction conditions and the conservation equations are satisfied. The failure is rather that the authors did not {{make sense of the}} field equations and conservation equations, which are singular at a change of signature. In quantum cosmology, there are so-called real tunnelling solutions to the Wheeler-deWitt equation [1 – 8] which may be interpreted in a purely classical way as solutions to the classical field equations in which the metric changes signature from Lorentzian to Riemannian. In the quantum cosmology approach, the momentum fields are real in the Lorentzian region and imaginary in the Riemannian region, and so vanish at the junction. These junction conditions may also be derived by various purely classical methods [8 – 17]. Several authors omitted these junction conditions [18 – 26] and some subsequently claimed explicitly that they are unnecessary [20 – 22, 26]. Some of the mistakes <b>behind</b> <b>these</b> <b>claims</b> have been pointed out already [9, 10, 12, 14]. Unfortunately, some of these authors still insist that th...|$|E

IS theory violates the Bell inequalities by violating Measurement Independence. Despite this, IS theory is not fine tuned, is not conspiratorial, does not constrain experimenter free will and does not invoke retrocausality. The reasons <b>behind</b> <b>these</b> <b>claims</b> are discussed in this paper. These arise from properties not found in conventional ontic models: the invariant set has zero measure in its Euclidean embedding space, has Cantor Set structure homeomorphic to the p-adic integers (p 0) and is non-computable. In particular, it is shown that the p-adic metric encapulates the physics of the Cosmological Invariant Set postulate, and provides the technical means to demonstrate no fine tuning or conspiracy. Quantum theory can be viewed as the singular limit of IS theory when when p is set equal to infinity. Since it is based around a top-down constraint from cosmology, IS theory suggests that gravitational and quantum physics will be unified by a gravitational theory of the quantum, rather than a quantum theory of gravity. Some implications arising from such a perspective are discussed. Comment: In Proceedings QPL 2015, arXiv: 1511. 0118...|$|E
40|$|Since the Credit Crunch of 2007 - 08, {{a lot of}} {{academic}} and popular literature {{has focused on the}} strengths of Islamic banks in the face of financial crises. It is interesting to find out why the developing countries such as Pakistan weren‟t affected by the financial crisis. This paper explores the theory <b>behind</b> <b>these</b> <b>claims</b> by examining how the Islamic financial system increases market self-discipline by sharing the risks equitably between banks and depositors. It is found that this approach reduces moral hazard, asymmetric information and speculation, as well as reduces the different risks that banks face.

There has been very little literature provided on the credit crunch affecting the Islamic Banks of Pakistan. This paper focuses its study here for two reasons: first, there are opportunities to compare and contrast Islamic banks with conventional banks; second, why wasn‟t the Islamic Banking sector of Pakistan affected by the financial crisis which makes for a fascinating case study. By analysing the interviews taken at few Islamic banks this study will be carried on. It will talk about the future of Islamic Banks in Pakistan as well.

With e-tail spending in general having increased by over 400 % in the last 4 years and 17. 5 % of all retail spending now taking place online (IMRG, 2008), {{it is important to}} understand the environmental consequences of this shift in purchasing behaviour. The debate is particularly fierce in the groceries sector, with several of the large British supermarkets proclaiming the environmental benefits of their online operations. The truth <b>behind</b> <b>these</b> <b>claims</b> is very difficult to assess because of the complexity of the “last mile ” issues involved in comparing groceries sold online and conventionally. In order to gain an insight into the travel issues associated with online and conventional grocery shopping, a survey was carried out on the students of Heriot-Watt University’s Edinburgh campus in April 2008. This paper contains an analysis and discussion of the results of the survey and discusses the implications for green logistics. It shows that students shop for food online less than the general population and that their shopping online for food is statistically correlated with car ownership, where they live and nationality. Overall it appears that shopping online has made very little difference to the monthly car mileage of the respondents.

40|$|Recent {{strategy}} formation process {{literature has}} claimed organisations increasingly {{have to adjust}} dynamically their characteristics {{to the requirements of}} the environment by constantly changing their strategies and strategic capabilities (e. g. Brown & Eisenhardt, 1997; Bartlett & Ghoshal, 1998; Mintzberg, 1994). <b>Behind</b> <b>these</b> <b>claims</b> lies the interest to develop an interdisciplinary view of strategy that captures the interplay between the company and its business environment. This thesis makes a marked contribution to this debate by arguing that a key component in a firm’s strategic response to a change in market conditions {{is the result of the}} interpretation people develop about the event itself. It is argued that this development is a context dependent process, with outcomes emerging not merely as a product of bounded rational debates, but also shaped by the interest, commitment, and perception of individual organisational members. This study therefore argues that an understanding of the development of this cognition/action relationship is critical. This research seeks to shed light on the question: “How do managers of multinational firms perceive and respond to the impact of the Euro over time?” A qualitative case study methodology was used to examine the context dependent cognition/action relationship in eight multinational organisations by tracing the intended strategy before the event took place, and compare it with the realised strategy after the Euro was introduced. In total 87 interviews and 16 focus group discussions were conducted to capture the plausible and coherent explanations. Our study suggests the probability of firms introducing new strategies quickly and proactively depends on the anticipation, interpretation and capability of managers to recognise and to exploit changes. Motivation to do so is based on the perceived match or mismatch of the developments with the strategy in use prior to change...|$|E
40|$|Despite the {{prevailing}} assumption that hydrological flow variation is amplified and runoff increased with deforestation, evidence <b>behind</b> <b>these</b> <b>claims</b> is limited for very moist tropical regions. Data derived from field observations {{are needed to}} productively manage forested watersheds, optimize global climate models, and inform policymaking. First, I used a case study from mature forest and crop fields in Costa Rica to improve understanding of hydrological effects of forest conversion in tropical forests. Furthermore, I conducted a systematic review {{of the impact of}} public policies on forest cover in Mesoamerica. Examining micrometeorological differences between mature forest and cropland, leaf wetness duration (LWD) was 5 times longer in the forest. Within crop species, papaya dried significantly slower than the shorter taro and sweet potato. Average daily evapotranspiration (ETcrop) as calculated by the FAO 56 modified Penman-Monteith crop coefficient method was 2. 75 mm for forest compared to crop values for papaya (1. 83), taro (1. 76), and sweet potato (1. 43). These results suggest the possibility of higher runoff and alteration of rainfall recycling in the humid tropics following forest conversion to cropland. Canopy height and LWD seemed to be good indicators of differences in ETcrop. In order to successfully protect forests, the public policy type most likely to result in positive effects was market-based conservation, as zero cases were linked to increased deforestation or decreased forest cover. 81 % of the community based management policy cases and 66 % of the protected areas cases were positive. 83 % of the agricultural policy cases resulted in more deforestation. In order to increase effectiveness of forest conservation strategies, scientific reporting, such as this study, contributes knowledge to help inform policy. It can be inferred that longer LWD is associated with higher evapotranspiration of intercepted rainfall and lower runoff ratios in tropical forests compared to croplands. Therefore future policy directed at hydrological services should consider estimates of runoff from agricultural conversion in their decision-making process and target watersheds with high flood hazard potentials associated with large-scale deforestation...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, Australia’s {{proposed}} emissions trading regime. Following {{analysis of the}} international policy context {{which has led to}} climate mitigation scenarios both within Australia and abroad, the nature of Australia’s iron and steel industry is examined, as is its dynamic trade relationship with Chinese steel makers. Since Chinese participation is a critical component of post-Kyoto climate change mitigation, I analyse the role of China thus far in international negotiations. Within the context of iron and steel trade flows, the operation of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme and its likely effects on this industry’s international competitiveness are discussed. Common critiques of the proposed emissions trading scheme (including but not limited to carbon leakage, emissions capture, and emissions-intensive, trade-exposed industry assistance thresholds) are identified and subsequently contextualised against the backdrop of iron ore mining and steel manufacture. I propose, in addition to emissions leakage addressed in the literature, that domestic, intra-industry permit leakage would appear to exist as a result of poorly designed assistance thresholds. There is potential for industries that receive no government assistance to export emissions onto industries that receive most permits free. On the one hand, carbon leakage can act as a disincentive for net emissions reduction if trading partners are not forced to play by the same rules. On the other hand, inappropriate cost burdens could disadvantage Australian industries. If the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme is to be effective in the long run, it must address the tensions between comprehensive emissions control and administrative viability. If emissions capture is incomplete, mitigation efforts are notably ineffective. If certain industries beg concessions due to reduced competitiveness, then the cost burden on all other participating industries could reduce the scheme’s economic efficiency. In either case, the justification <b>behind</b> <b>these</b> <b>claims</b> is analysed in depth. Based on the findings of this thesis, I have concluded that the focus of critics on the tradeoffs between environmental effectiveness and economic efficiency sacrifices the ability of the proposed scheme to achieve maximum buy-in from industry interests and ignores the foreign policy implications of early climate policy action by Australia...|$|E
