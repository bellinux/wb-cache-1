5|$|The prince {{began to}} <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> unifier towards {{the middle of}} the 19th century. Such an {{interpretation}} is completely lacking in the historiography of the 17th-century chroniclers, and even in that of the Transylvanian School around 1800. What they emphasized, apart from the exceptional personality of Michael himself, were the idea of Christendom and his close relations with Emperor Rudolf. The conqueror's ambition is likewise frequently cited as a motivation for his action, occupying in the interpretative schema the place that was later to be occupied by the Romanian idea.|$|E
5|$|Convict {{cichlids}} {{may show}} extended biparental care and adopt unrelated young {{of the same}} species of similar or smaller body size compared to their own biological offspring. The parents may benefit by adopting smaller young by taking advantage of the dilution effect, which is when the risk of predation for an individual is reduced because the group size is larger. Another reason that has been considered is that foreign young that are larger than the biological offspring may be a direct predatory threat to them. However, {{it has been shown that}} as the biological offspring develop and become stronger swimmers, the parents are less active about rejecting larger foreign young, but when they do reject, often foreign young are rejected before they are large enough to <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> direct threat to the biological offspring. Thus, it can be concluded that the brood adoption and rejection rely more heavily on the protection of the biological offspring from differential predator instead of from larger adopted cichlids.|$|E

25|$|Relational constructivism can <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{relational}} {{consequence of}} the radical constructivism.

Therefore, humans {{are not able to}} come to objective conclusions about the world.|$|E
25|$|Welcome of emigrants by {{diaspora}} Jewish {{community is}} seen as a possible betrayal of the Zionist ideal—immigration to Israel—and endangerment of Israel's success in retaining and growing its Jewish population. Israel encouraged organized Jewish Diaspora communities not to offer Israeli emigrant services as this might <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> welcome or assistance which would encourage the Israeli emigrants to stay.|$|E
25|$|The steam {{content in}} the flue may produce visible fume from the stack, which can <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> visual pollution. It may be avoided by {{decreasing}} the steam content by flue-gas condensation and reheating, or by increasing the flue gas exit temperature well above its dew point. Flue-gas condensation allows the latent heat of vaporization of the water to be recovered, subsequently increasing the thermal efficiency of the plant.|$|E

25|$|Following Wolfgang Dietrich, Wolfgang Sützl and the Innsbruck School of Peace Studies, {{some peace}} thinkers have {{abandoned}} any single and all-encompassing definition of peace. Rather, they promote {{the idea of}} many peaces. They argue that since no singular, correct definition of peace can exist, peace should <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> plurality. This post-modern understanding of peace(s) {{was based on the}} philosophy of Jean Francois Lyotard. It served as a fundament for the more recent concept of trans-rational peace(s) and elicitive conflict transformation.|$|E
25|$|A {{congenital}} physical anomaly is an abnormality of {{the structure}} of a body part. An anomaly may or may not <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> problem condition. Many, if not most, people have one or more minor physical anomalies if examined carefully. Examples of minor anomalies can include curvature of the 5th finger (clinodactyly), a third nipple, tiny indentations of the skin near the ears (preauricular pits), shortness of the 4th metacarpal or metatarsal bones, or dimples over the lower spine (sacral dimples). Some minor anomalies may be clues to more significant internal abnormalities.|$|E
25|$|Senator William Jenner {{resigned}} {{shortly before}} the mid-term elections in 1958 and urged Handley to seek his seat. A plan was created where Handley would resign the governorship, his lieutenant would appoint him senator, and he could finish the term. When the plan was revealed to the party leadership, they strongly advised him to not implement the it because they feared it would hurt the party and <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> scandal. Handley then decided to have the Secretary of State order an election for the office in November, and Handley himself ran for the position.|$|E

25|$|It {{was only}} {{late in the}} Middle Ages that Götaland began to <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> part of Sweden. In Old Norse and in Old English sources, Gautland/Geatland is still treated as a {{separate}} country from Sweden. In Sögubrot af Nokkrum for instance, Kolmården between Svealand and Östergötland is described as the border between Sweden and Ostrogothia (...Kolmerkr, er skilr Svíþjóð ok Eystra-Gautland...), and in Hervarar saga, King Ingold I rides to Sweden through Östergötland: Ingi konungr fór með hirð sína ok sveit nokkura ok hafði lítinn her. Hann reið austr um Smáland ok í eystra Gautland ok svá í Svíþjóð. In 1384 Bo Jonsson (Grip) stated in his will that the kingdom consisted of Swerige (Sweden, i.e. Svealand), Österland (i.e. Finland) and Göthaland (i.e. Götaland).|$|E
25|$|Leake became First Lord of the Admiralty in the Harley Ministry in November 1710, but {{declined}} to take a political position in that role, and was re-appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Navy for expeditions in January 1711 (for trade protection in the Channel) and in April 1712 (for an attack on Dunkirk). He stood down as First Lord of the Admiralty in September 1712 and reverted to his former role as First Naval Lord on the Admiralty Board. He was re-appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Navy for yet another expedition in March 1713 before resigning from the Admiralty Board in October 1714. Knowing that he would <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Tory, following his active involvement in the Harley Ministry, he stood down from Parliament immediately prior to the general election in 1715.|$|E
25|$|That {{same year}} the band also {{recorded}} their debut album on Happy Face. Most {{commonly known as}} Lightning to the Nations, the collection was recorded in seven days at The Old Smythy Studio in Worcester, which the band described later as 'dead'. The album was packaged in a plain sleeve with no title or track listings, simply bearing a signature {{of one of the}} band members. The management thought that it should <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> 'demo' album so no fancy sleeve was required, making it very cheap to produce. the first 1000 copies were pressed and made available at concerts or via mail-order for £3.50. The only mail-order advertisement appeared in Sounds and ran for six weeks. The bands management did not pay for the advertisement and ended up being sued. The idea for recording this album came from Fellows and Linda Harris as an attempt to record tracks to entice attention from a record company, which would take care of the recording costs.|$|E

25|$|The dynastic founder Husayn ibn Ali (1669–1740, r.1705–1735), an Ottoman cavalry officer (agha of the spahis) of Cretan origin, {{managed to}} acquire the {{sovereign}} power in 1705. His military units were included in those Tunisian forces that fought and defeated the then Algerian invasion. The Turkish janissary then selected their own Dey as the new ruler. Husayn ibn Ali, however, opposed the Dey and sought the backing of Tunisian khassa (notables), the ulama and the religious, {{as well as local}} tribes. Thus, though also a Turkish-speaking foreigner, he worked to obtain native loyalties against the Turkish soldiery and eventually prevailed. Accordingly, as ruler he sought to <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> popular Muslim interested in local issues and prosperity. He appointed as qadi a Tunisian Maliki jurist, instead of an Hanafi preferred by the Ottomans. He also restricted the legal prerogatives of the janissary and the Dey. Under Husayn b. Ali as Bey of Tunis support was provided to agriculture, especially planting olive orchards. Public works were undertaken, e.g., mosques and madrassa (schools). His popularity was demonstrated in 1715 when the kapudan-pasha of the Ottoman fleet sailed to Tunis with a new governor to replace him; instead Husayn Bey summoned council, composed of local civil and military leaders, who backed him against the Ottoman Empire, which then acquiesced.|$|E
25|$|On 15 April 1961, {{at about}} 06:00 AM Cuban local time, eight Douglas B-26B Invader bombers in three groups {{simultaneously}} attacked three Cuban airfields at San Antonio de los Baños and at Ciudad Libertad (formerly named Campo Columbia), both near Havana, plus the Antonio Maceo International Airport at Santiago de Cuba. The B-26s {{had been prepared}} by the CIA on behalf of Brigade 2506, and had been painted with the false flag markings of the FAR, the air force of the Cuban government. Each was armed with bombs, rockets and machine guns. They had flown from Puerto Cabezas in Nicaragua, and were crewed by exiled Cuban pilots and navigators of the self-styled Fuerza Aérea de Liberación (FAL). The purpose of the action (code-named Operation Puma) was reportedly to destroy {{most or all of}} the armed aircraft of the FAR in preparation for the main invasion. At Santiago, the two attackers destroyed a C-47 transport, a PBY Catalina flying boat, two B-26s and a civilian DC-3 plus various other civilian aircraft. At San Antonio, the three attackers destroyed three FAR B-26s, one Sea Fury and one T-33, and one attacker diverted to Grand Cayman due to low usable fuel. Aircraft that diverted to the Caymans were aggressively seized since Great Britain was leery that the Cayman Islands might <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> launch site for the invasion. At Ciudad Libertad, the three attackers destroyed only non-operational aircraft such as two P-47 Thunderbolts. One of those attackers was damaged by anti-aircraft fire, and ditched about 50km north of Cuba, with the loss of its crew Daniel Fernández Mon and Gaston Pérez. Its companion B-26, also damaged, continued north and landed at Boca Chica field (Naval Air Station Key West), Florida. The crew, José Crespo and Lorenzo Pérez-Lorenzo, were granted political asylum, and made their way back to Nicaragua the next day via Miami and the daily CIA C-54 flight from Opa-locka Airport to Puerto Cabezas Airport. Their B-26, purposely numbered 933, the same as at least two other B-26s that day for disinformation reasons, was held until late on 17 April.|$|E

500|$|Dostoyevsky's Petersburg is {{the city}} of unrelieved poverty; [...] "magnificence {{has no place in}} it, because magnificence is external, formal abstract, cold". Dostoyevsky connects the city's {{problems}} to Raskolnikov's thoughts and subsequent actions. The crowded streets and squares, the shabby houses and taverns, the noise and stench, all are transformed by Dostoyevsky into a rich store of metaphors for states of mind. Donald Fanger asserts that [...] "the real city ... rendered with a striking concreteness, is also a city of the mind in the way that its atmosphere answers Raskolnikov's state and almost symbolizes it. It is crowded, stifling, and parched." [...] The inner turmoil suffered by Raskolnikov can also <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Shakespearean pathetic fallacy. For example, the great storm in Shakespeare's King Lear reflects the state of the titular character's mind, much like the chaos, disorder and noise of St. Petersburg reflects the state of Raskolnikov's mind.|$|E
