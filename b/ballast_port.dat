50|$|The Chief Mate, who was {{the watch}} officer, then ordered the {{assistant}} engineer to pump water for 15 minutes into the #18 starboard ballast tank, which corrected the port list. At 19:30 the captain, who was by then the watch officer, ordered the chief engineer to pump out the #18 starboard ballast tank. The ballast tanks were now all empty again, which left Valour with a slight starboard list. The weather continued to deteriorate, and by 21:30 the winds were south at 50 - 60 kn, gusting to 70 kn, with 10 ft seas. At 22:00 the chief mate went to the wheelhouse and told the captain {{that there was a}} slight starboard list (which was consistent with the stability letter). The wind and seas were also pushing the barge to the north, and that strain on the tow wire may have increased the list. At 22:15 the Captain ordered the chief engineer to pump water for 15 minutes into the #18 <b>port</b> <b>ballast</b> tank to correct for the starboard list. Because of poor communications and a lack of established ballasting procedures, water continued to be pumped into that tank for over one hour, at least 45 minutes longer than ordered. At around 23:00-23:15 Valour leveled off and began to list to port. At 23:16 Valour was listing to port and also began rolling to port, alarming the Captain, who then ordered the chief engineer to pump off all ballast. Twenty minutes later, that operation was stopped, and they then began transferring from the #18 <b>port</b> <b>ballast</b> tank to the #18 starboard ballast tank.|$|R

500|$|The Basic Design Section of the Navy Technical Department decided upon an {{enlarged}} and improved Hiry≈´ design with the island {{on the port}} side, amidships. After construction of the ships began, the Naval Air Technical Department (NATD) began having second thoughts about {{the location of the}} island because it thought that the portside location of the island on Hiry≈´ and Akagi had an adverse impact on airflow over the flight deck. Another issue identified was that the amidships position shortened the available landing area, which had the potential to be problematic in the future as aircraft landing speeds increased with their growing weight. To verify these assumptions, the NATD filmed hundreds of takeoffs and landings aboard Akagi in October‚ÄìNovember 1938 and decided to move the island over to the starboard side and further forward, about one-third of the length from the bow. Sh≈çkaku was the furthest advanced by this point and the supporting structure for the bridge had already been built; rebuilding it would have delayed construction so it was left in place. The changes that had to be made consisted of a [...] widening of the flight deck opposite the island and a corresponding [...] narrowing on the starboard side and the addition of [...] of <b>ballast</b> on the <b>port</b> side to re-balance the ship.|$|R
50|$|Both {{submarines}} sustained damage, but no {{casualties were}} reported. Russian reports and American aerial surveillance agree that Kostromas sail was dented {{on her front}} section. Russian navy sources reportedly found pieces of composite material from Baton Rouges anti-sonar tiles. The US Navy claimed that besides some scratches, dents, and two minor cuts on her <b>port</b> <b>ballast</b> tank, Baton Rouge did not suffer major damage. But in any case it was serious since any rupture on the single hull of Baton Rouge would have compromised her pressure resistance. The deactivation of Baton Rouge was announced on 17 September 1993, although some sources claim that the American submarine had already {{been taken out of}} service {{less than a year after}} the incident, in January 1993. According to Gregory Stitz, curator of Arkansas Inland Maritime Museum, and some European sources, the costs of repairing the damaged pressure hull, along with a programmed refueling, were well beyond the planned budget. Therefore, the US Navy chose to decommission the submarine. Russian naval officers alleged that the US submarine had become a constructive total loss right after the collision. As for Kostroma, she was laid up on 28 March 1992 and had been fully repaired at Nerpa shipyards in Snezhnogorsk by 29 June 1992. The Russian submarine was temporarily renamed Krab, before recovering her original name in November 1996. After a huge overhaul, again at Nerpa, she returned to service in 2005.|$|R
50|$|With {{improper}} ballast operations {{causing a}} substantial port list, fuel inadvertently began to flow by gravity (hydrostatic balancing) from starboard to port, thereby increasing {{the severity of}} the list and eventually causing the aft deck to become awash. An unknown amount of sea water is likely to have entered the #19 & 20 aft ballast tanks through their deck vents, reducing reserve buoyancy further and adding more free surface effect. To counteract this the Captain ordered all ballast to be pumped off, then agreed 20 minutes later to stop pumping ballast water out of the #18 <b>port</b> <b>ballast</b> tank and start pumping ballast water into the #18 starboard ballast tank from the sea (the vessel was not configured to allow internal ballast transfers), causing even more loss of reserve buoyancy. All the while, the barge had been creeping up on them and was now just off the port quarter, with the weight of the tow wire hanging off the port side of the tug. All of this was greatly compounded by the chief mate suffering a fatal fall down the ladder from the wheelhouse and then the loss of an able seaman overboard. Shortly after midnight on the 18th the crew finally released the tow to avoid being tripped. Valour continued to list and roll further to port until it was on its side, then sea water began entering the vessel through the engine room vents on the stack deck.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the night}} of 24 February 1944 Tally-Ho was ordered back to the Sembilan Islands, and while zig-zagging on the surface at night {{charging}} the batteries, lookouts spotted two wakes ahead. Believing {{there was a possibility}} of the two vessels being friendly (both [...] and [...] being in the area), Tally-Ho immediately altered course to avoid a collision with the rapidly approaching vessels. On making a challenge with the Aldis lamp the vessels responded by altering course straight towards them and dropping depth charges, leaving no doubt they were unfriendly vessels. At this point the closest ship fired a shell which passed dangerously close over Tally-Hos conning tower before the attacker passed closely by the submarine and then turned for another attack. During this encounter Tally-Ho had been unable to dive due to the proximity of the attackers and the shallowness of the waters in the straight, in addition, diving would have presented the attacking ships with the opportunity to ram or depth charge the submarine. In the darkness Tally-Ho manoeuvred to a parallel course to the approaching attacker and the enemy vessel passed closely by the submarine, a loud hammering and tearing noise being heard as the ship passed, the vessel being identified as a Hayabusa-class torpedo boat of 600 tons. As the attacker disappeared in the murk Tally-Ho took on a list to port and assumed a marked bow-down attitude. Bennington decided that the batteries would have sufficient charge to risk diving which Tally-Ho then did. Before closing the conning tower hatch, he noticed that the submarine had taken on a 12-degree list. Once submerged, the crew took stock of the damage, and apart from smashed light bulbs and gauge dial glasses, Tally-Ho appeared to be seaworthy, and she remained submerged until 06:30 of 24 February when Bennington brought Tally-Ho to periscope depth and observed his attacker making unusual manoeuvres apparently searching for the submarine on the starboard quarter some 4 mi off. Tally-Ho remained dived for the following 12 hours before surfacing after dark at 18:25. Upon surfacing it was noticed that the submarine's list had increased to 15 degrees, and it was possible to see the damage to the submarine's <b>port</b> <b>ballast</b> tanks which were all open at the top and beyond further use. With transfer of fuel and water from various tanks and moving of stores and torpedoes, the bow-down attitude was reduced to 4 degrees, and the three-day journey to Trincomalee commenced. This was uneventful apart from encountering a monsoon during the passage of the Bay of Bengal and the possibility of encountering a Japanese submarine close to home. Arriving at Trincomalee harbour on 29 February 1944, Tally-Ho missed her escort and found herself amongst Admiral James Sommerville's battle fleet at exercises. Later, upon examination in dry dock prior to repairs, the extent of the damage to Tally-Hos <b>port</b> <b>ballast</b> tanks became apparent. The rotating screws of the torpedo boat had run the length of the tanks, chewing large holes in them, phosphor bronze fragments of the attacker's propeller blades being discovered inside. Post-war enquiries learned that their attacker's behaviour after the attack had been due to a combination of Tally-Hos lowered port bow hydroplane having pierced the torpedo boat's hull, and the vessel's port screw having been shorn of its blades almost down to the hub.|$|R

Shipping {{moves over}} 80 % of the world‚Äôs commodities and transfers approximately 3 to 5 {{billion tons of}} ballast water internationally each year {{that is necessary to}} provides ships‚Äô trimming and stability. Many studies signified {{in different parts of the}} world have shown that ships‚Äô ballast water has very important role for the transfer aquatic organism, human pathogens, including bacteria and viruses. Therefore, the marine environment is at risk to happen a serious ecological problem during discharging ballast water. The introduction of marine invasive species to coastal waters when ships take on ballast water at one port and then discharge with water, sediments, and biofilms from ships‚Äô ballast water tanks it at other, ports is a significant threat to coastal and ocean ecosystems and economies. And, impacts on human and animal health, the environment and socio-economic activities appear. For example, the European zebra mussel has infested over 40 % of internal waterways in United States. In 2004, with ‚ÄòInternational Convention for the Control and Management of Ships' Ballast Water and Sediments‚Äô is adopted by International Maritime Organization, that describes D- 1 standard for ballast water exchange, D- 2 standard for ballast water performance, including the safety, testing requirements and procedures together with exceptional cases. Complying with the new ballast regulations is one of the most significant cost challenges the shipping industry can except to face over the next few years. According to the Ballast Water Management convention, D- 2 standard must be provided for the ballast water capacity less than 1500 m 3 (built from 2009) and the ballast water capacity greater than 5000 m 3 (built from 2012) until the end of 2016 and the ballast water capacity between 1500 ‚Äì 5000 m 3 (built from 2009) until the end of 2014. For this reason, all parties have been researching alternative systems as per International Maritime Organization regulations. This study describes ballast water treatment systems together with ballast water and invasive species description. The ballast water treatment technology used to treat ballast water has generally been derived from other treatment systems, in which forms of solid-liquid separation and disinfection processes were applied. There are three treatment technology types, which are generally combined that are mechanical, chemical and disinfection. Most systems employ a two-stage approach involving mechanical separation at the first stage, followed by a second stage physical or chemical treatment. At this stage some systems use a combination of two or more treatments. In this study summarizes some systems which were approved or designed and tested. Chemical treatment use active substances to treat microorganisms, and for this, sufficient stocks will have to be carried on board. Therefore, this treatment would not be preferred by shipowners due to producing by-products with their chemical reactions to cause environmental threat. There are so many treatment systems on the market. The existing vessels can be integrated and retrofitted with these systems. Following adoption of the Ballast Water Management Convention, interest in these alternatives to conventional Ballast Water Management has increased since they offer ways to avoid, or substantially reduce, the operational issues and costs of treating compartmentalized ballast water to meet the Convention‚Äôs respective D- 2 discharge standards, plus the cost of managing tank sediments. There is limited information in evaluating of these new technologies in reducing the transfer of harmful species in accordance with the goals of the Ballast Water Management Convention. This study gives informations and perspectives about intaking ballast water in the port reception facilities together with alternative methods related with the ballast water management. Ships that cannot meet this requirement for onboard ballast water treatment may be allowed to discharge ballast water to a port-based ballast water reception facility, which is generally understood to mean either a shore-based or barge-based ballast water treatment facility. This system has some disadvantages such as potential delays, sufficient space and equipment suitability. For this, in this study gives case study of port of Baltimore as an example to analyze economically and logistically port reception facilities. According to this case, port reception facility are feasible. On the other hand, technically that can be challenges. Additionally, port reception facilities evaluate in Turkey from this perspective and compared with the port of Baltimore for space situation. Some shipowners have not ballast water treatment system or, have treatment system but their system performance is not enough to discharge of ballast water at the special zones where exist a local standard. Therefore, complying with <b>ballast</b> water regulations, <b>port</b> reception facilities will be alternative solution in order to discharge ballast water. In this study gives information about waste reception facilities in Turkey to analyze challenges that can be occurred in port reception facilities. For this, when Borusan port where called 1717 vessels in 2013 is evaluated, it appears that ports need a <b>port</b> <b>ballast</b> water reception facilities which has more capacity than present waste reception facilities. Additionally, there are many concepts have been designed zero or minimal discharge (such as storm ballast, internal ballast and potable water), no ballast or continuous flow methods that are longitudinal trunks, ship buoyancy control and enhanced ballast water exchange concepts. All continuous flow systems readily exceed the performance required by the D- 1 exchange standard but this standard is to be withdrawn at the end of 2014 / 2016. In regard to other zero ballast methods that may include their high build costs and relatively large wetted surfaces when loaded. The amount will vary according to the design cargo type and capacity, cargo loading and unloading requirements and other trading factors. At the same time, solid ballast method can be alternatively used for the container vessel. As container vessels can be arranged for solid ballast with empty positioning in export and import leg on their rotation. This method would be more attractive for retrofits or new builds than modified container ships. Results of this study underline that alternative system is very crucial for removing invasive species. In the future studies, numeric analyses and assessments of port reception facilities and the other alternative systems such as ballast free and no ballast can be proposed. Y√ºksek LisansM.
