500|$|The {{sky hook}} used to rescue Bond {{at the end}} of the film was a rescue system used by the United States {{military}} at the time. At Thunderballs release, there was confusion as to whether a rebreather such as the one that appears in the film existed; most Bond gadgets, while implausible, often are based upon real technology. In the real world, a rebreather could not be so small, as it has no room for the <b>breathing</b> <b>bag,</b> while the alternative open-circuit scuba releases exhalation bubbles, which the film device does not. It was made with two CO2 bottles glued together and painted, with a small mouthpiece attached. For this reason, when the Royal Corps of Engineers asked Peter Lamont how long a man could use the device underwater, the answer was [...] "As long as you can hold your breath." ...|$|E

40|$|All {{halothane}} vaporizers {{tested for}} leakage when turned off, leaked {{significant amounts of}} halo-thane and this may represent a hazard to patients liable to develop halothane hepatitis or malignant hyperpyrexia. The hazard from leaking vaporizers may be reduced considerably {{by the use of}} well-designed bypass units. Circuit contamination by halothane may still result from such sources as neoprene seals around flowmeters, <b>breathing</b> <b>bags</b> and anaesthetic hose which have had previous contact with halothane vapour, whether or not an apparatus is in use. The hazard from contami-nated hoses and bags may be reduced considerably by washing and then hanging in a halothane-free atmosphere for a day. The hazard from contaminated rubber or plastic components of the anaesthetic machine can be eliminated only by using one apparatus without the vaporizers having been attached at any time during its working life. Similarly, hazards may arise from trichloro-ethylene vaporizers and from circuit components contaminated with trichloroethylene. Lowe, Titel and Hagler (1971) have shown that the anaesthetic hoses and reservoir bags will absorb considerable quantities of halothane.

2500|$|The first commercially {{practical}} scuba rebreather {{was designed}} and built by the diving engineer Henry Fleuss in 1878, while working for Siebe Gorman in London. His self contained breathing apparatus consisted of a rubber mask connected to a <b>breathing</b> <b>bag,</b> with (estimated) 50-60% O2 supplied from a copper tank and CO2 scrubbed by rope yarn soaked in a solution of caustic potash; the system giving a duration of about three hours. This apparatus was first used under operational conditions in 1880 by the lead diver on the Severn Tunnel construction project, {{who was able to}} travel [...] in the darkness to close several submerged sluice doors in the tunnel; this had defeated the best efforts of hard hat divers due to the danger of their air supply hoses becoming fouled on submerged debris, and the strong water currents in the workings.|$|E
2500|$|Sir Robert Davis, head of Siebe Gorman, {{improved}} the oxygen rebreather in 1910 with his {{invention of the}} Davis Submerged Escape Apparatus, the first rebreather {{to be made in}} quantity. While intended primarily as an emergency escape apparatus for submarine crews, it was soon also used for diving, being a handy shallow water diving apparatus with a thirty-minute endurance, and as an industrial breathing set. The Davis apparatus comprised a rubber <b>breathing</b> <b>bag</b> containing a canister of barium hydroxide to scrub exhaled carbon dioxide and a steel cylinder holding approximately [...] of oxygen at a pressure of , with a valve to allow the user to add oxygen to the bag.

2500|$|A {{downstream}} {{demand valve}} {{serves as a}} fail safe for over-pressurization: if a first stage with a demand valve malfunctions and jams in the open position, the demand valve will be over-pressurized and will [...] "free flow". Although it presents the diver with an imminent [...] "out of air" [...] crisis, this failure mode lets gas escape directly into the water without inflating buoyancy devices. The effect of unintentional inflation might be to carry the diver quickly to the surface causing the various injuries that can result from an over-fast ascent. There are circumstances where regulators are connected to inflatable equipment such as a rebreather's <b>breathing</b> <b>bag,</b> a buoyancy compensator, or a drysuit, but {{without the need for}} demand valves. Examples of this are argon suit inflation sets and [...] "off board" [...] or secondary diluent cylinders for closed-circuit rebreathers. When no demand valve is connected to a regulator, it should be equipped with a pressure relief valve, unless it has a built in over pressure valve, so that over-pressurization does not inflate any buoyancy devices connected to the regulator.|$|E

5|$|After the trachea {{has been}} intubated, a balloon cuff is {{typically}} inflated {{just above the}} far end of the tube to help secure it in place, to prevent leakage of respiratory gases, and to protect the tracheobronchial tree from receiving undesirable material such as stomach acid. The tube is then secured to the face or neck and connected to a T-piece, anesthesia <b>breathing</b> circuit, <b>bag</b> valve mask device, or a mechanical ventilator. Once there is no longer a need for ventilatory assistance and/or protection of the airway, the tracheal tube is removed; this is referred to as extubation of the trachea (or decannulation, in the case of a surgical airway such as a cricothyrotomy or a tracheotomy).|$|R

40|$|A {{screening}} of two collaborative video works with Julia Kouneski: "Scaling COPAN", 2009 and "Sensitising", 2009, alongside two performance events: "Breathing Propositions", 2017. with Julia Kouneski, and Goldsmiths students: Clementine Bedos, Jennifer Milner, Victoria Batt and Violeta Paez Armando. PRESS RELEASE 22 FEBRUARY – 18 MARCH 2017 Annka Kultys Gallery {{is pleased to}} present Concrete Jungle, an exhibition featuring video works curated by Alexandra White. Set within the iconic concrete architecture of the Brazilian Modernist architect Oscar Niemeyer, the works on view explore the physical and psychological boundaries between the human and architectural body within the specific context of Brazil. Concrete Jungle includes work by Copenhagen-based Brazilian video artist Tamar Guimarães, as well as collaborative videos by the artists Michelle Williams Gamaker and Julia Kouneski. As its title suggests, the exhibition plays {{with a series of}} dichotomies: concrete / jungle, man-made / nature, reality / fantasy. The most obvious juxtaposition, however, lies in contrasting the two buildings that serve as both backdrop and theme within the works. The Copan building, featured in Williams Gamaker and Kouneski’s Scaling Copan (2009) and Sensitising (plastic bags) (2009), is a monumental 38 -story residential building in Sao Paulo, designed by Niemeyer in 1951, while Casa das Canoas, the setting for Guimarães’ Canoas (2010), was the architect’s family home, constructed the following year, 1952, in the arboraceous outskirts of Rio de Janeiro. At the time of the buildings’ construction, Brazil aspired to be a Modernist utopia led by Niemeyer’s and fellow architect and urban planner, Lucio Costa’s, government-backed plans {{for the development of the}} new greenfield capital Brasilia, located on a tabula rasa in Brazil’s hinterland with its catchy slogan “fifty years in five. ” Out of this passion for progress came the shiny, undulating addition to São Paulo’s skyline, the Copan building, a social housing project intended to transcend class barriers and become the height of urban living. Niemeyer, however, despite the urban-centric focus, preferred to build Casa das Canoas as his own home on the periphery of bustling Rio to escape the anxieties of city life, in the more natural setting of Barra da Tijuca, a would-be tropical paradise. Yet this era of accelerated industrialisation and socialist dreams, known as Brazil’s “Golden Age,” was cut short by the military coup of 1964 which installed a torturous dictatorship lasting two decades. Influenced by the work of Brazilian artist Lygia Clark, Williams Gamaker and Kouneski have worked collaboratively to produce two performative video pieces. In Scaling Copan the artists — on hands and knees — scale the curvilinear ledge of the 22 nd floor of the Copan building. The anxiety-inducing performance lays bare the rawness of sensation; the climax being the point at which the artists dangle their feet over 22 floors. A second work from the series, Sensitising (plastic bags), is a five minute video of the artists on the same ledge <b>breathing</b> into plastic <b>bags.</b> An act reminiscent of hyperventilating, this work draws directly from Clark’s therapeutic practice, and her desire to abolish the borders between subject and object. The bag, for Clark, functions as an extended skin or connective tissue. In Guimarães’ 16 -mm film Canoas, Niemeyer’s home is the setting for a party as it unravels from beginning to end. With its large glass windows and distinctive Niemeyer curves, Casa das Canoas is on full display. The film shifts between discussions amongst invited guests — friends of the artist, academics and politicians — that range from Modernist architecture to the military dictatorship via the quality of Brazilian champagne. In one conversation, for example, guests lament the tendency for Brazilian Modernism to build luxury homes (such as Casa das Canoas) for the wealthy — on the backs of an underpaid labour force – rather than implementing the utopian vision of supplying social housing for the masses. While the guests discuss issues of race and class in Brazil, in between spurts of dancing and hanging out by the pool, black waiters serve champagne and cocktails. Through highlighting the contradictions of the intellectual elite, Canoas challenges the notion of Brazil as an exotic paradise, as mythologised in the writings of the anthropologist Gilberto Freyre, in which desire transcends class and racial divides. Concrete Jungle is presented at a time when, notwithstanding the international focus brought by the 2014 World Cup and the 2016 Summer Olympics, the utopian possibilities of Brazil have once again become a distant memory. Today, Niemeyer’s structures are permanent reminders of the promise of Modernism but also of Brazil’s continued reliance on a political system where social hierarchies have exacerbated the distance between the Haves and the Have-Nots...|$|R

The cylinder is equipped with a control valve and is connected to the <b>breathing</b> <b>bag.</b> Opening the cylinder's valve admits oxygen to the bag and charges it to the pressure of the surrounding water.|$|E
50|$|In 1878 he {{was granted}} a patent which {{improved}} rebreathers.

Fleuss tested his device in 1879 by spending an hour submerged in a water tank, then one week later by diving {{to a depth of}} 5.5m in open water, upon which occasion he was slightly injured when his assistants abruptly pulled him to the surface.|$|E
50|$|In {{some early}} oxygen rebreathers the diver had to {{manually}} {{open and close}} the valve to the oxygen cylinder to refill the counter-lung each time the volume got low. In others the oxygen flow is kept constant by a pressure-reducing flow valve like the valves on blowtorch cylinders; the set also has a manual on/off valve called a bypass. In some modern oxygen rebreathers, the pressure in the <b>breathing</b> <b>bag</b> controls the oxygen flow like the demand valve in open-circuit scuba; for example, trying to breathe in from an empty bag makes the cylinder release more gas.|$|E
