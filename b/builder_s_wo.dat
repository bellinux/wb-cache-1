An analysis of {{the negative consequences of}} previous development and of destruction wrought by war shows the strong impact on social, economic and cultural life in all types of Croatian rural settlements. This indicates the need to transform spatial structures, which gives a chance for their complete renewal. This article shows how the authorities in the Republic of Croatia organized the renewal of destroyed villages in this century, i. e. the advantages and failures of such renewal. As far as we know to date, two burnt villages were renewed in the interwar period: Donji Kraljevec (Međimurje — today in the Donji Kraljevec municipality) between 1934 and 1938, and Kolarec (near Križevci, today in the Sveti Petar Orehovec municipality) between 1938 and 1941. The architectural reconstruction of these villages did not entail any changes in the social structure of the population. The Croatian Peasant Party organized the complete renewal of Kolarec village (which lasted from 1938 to 1941), and collecting help for the work. The renewal of the village was first entrusted to the Hygienic Institute in Zagreb, and several weeks later it was entrusted to the <b>builder</b> <b>S.</b> Florschütz, who planned the village, designed the buildings, built them, and supervised the interior decoration. During the three years of renewal the Croatian Peasant Party planned a new, modern, model and hygienic village. The buildings were designed to correspond with the social ideas of that time, and Kolarec was to be a village with the ideal type of peasant house...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} WO 3 on the {{properties}} {{and structure of}} PbO-B 2 O 3 -P 2 O 5 -WO 3 quaternary system was studied. Glasses containing up to 60 mol% WO 3 were prepared and the variation of several physical properties was determined with respect to chemical composition in a broad compositional range. Chemical durability of WO 3 -containing glasses is very high and their thermal stability as well. Glass transition temperature increases with increasing WO 3 content up to 566 °C. Glass structure was studied by Raman spectroscopy and 31 P and 11 B MAS NMR spectroscopy. NMR spectroscopy reveals the formation of B-O-W linkages and also the existence of tetrahedral BO 4 units and trigonal units BO 3 in the glass structure. With increasing WO 3 content in the glasses, the number of starting tetrahedral B(OP) 3 O units decreases and B-O-P bridges are replaced gradually by B-O-W and B-O-B bridges, {{while the number of}} BO 3 units increases. Raman spectra of the studied glasses possess a doublet of strong vibrational bands in the range at 800 - 1000 cm- 1, assigned to vibrations of W-O- a W=O bonds in tungstate structural units. In glasses with a higher WO 3 content WO 6 octahedra form tungstate clusters interconnected by W-O-W bridges as reflected in the Raman spectra [...] The formation of strong P-O-W and B-O-W linkages in the studied glasses explains high chemical durability of the glasses and the observed increase in the glass transition temperature.
