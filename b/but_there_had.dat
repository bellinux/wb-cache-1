25|$|Brussels Airlines began {{trying to}} set up a {{regional}} airline in DR Congo in 2007. DR Congo used to be Belgian Congo and has strong business and political ties with Belgium. In that year, airDC was founded as a joint venture with Hewa Bora Airways, and the launch of commercial regional flights from Kinshasa-N'djili Airport using a fleet of BAe 146-200s handed over by Brussels Airlines was planned for early 2008. Concerns about the success of the project were voiced in 2008, when the disaster of Hewa Bora Airways Flight 122 revealed serious aviation safety flaws in the DR Congo. As a consequence, Hewa Bora was banned from operating within the European Union (any air carriers from the DR Congo had already been included in the EU blacklist since 2006 due to a lack or regulatory oversight in the country, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>had</b> been an exception for Hewa Bora's Brussels service). The airDC project was postponed indefinitely and eventually abandoned.|$|E
25|$|In 1962, Florance {{realised}} {{one of her}} theatrical ambitions in the Union Theatre's {{production of}} William Shakespeare's Macbeth (6 February 1962 – 3 March 1962), which starred Frank Thring {{in the title role}} and Florance as Lady Macbeth. Thring and Florance were old friends; they performed opposite each other in Oedipus Rex and in The Guardsman. He was a regular guest at her parties, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>had</b> always been tension between them on stage. Florance appeared in three more plays in 1962; Fritz Hochwälder's The Public Prosecutor (12 April 1962 – 5 May 1962) with Peter Adams, at the Little Theatre, Ray Lawler's Summer of the Seventeenth Doll (4 June 1962 – July 1962) with Carol Armstrong, Bunney Brooke and Syd Conabere at Russell Street Theatre, and Michael Redgrave's adaptation of Henry James' The Aspern Papers (24 September 1962 – 13 October 1962) with Gina Curtis, Marion Edward and Reg Livermore at the Union Theatre.|$|E
25|$|Bracton {{considered}} {{the case of}} when a tenant made a gift of frankalmoin - a gift of land to the Church. A wardship would be of no value at all. An escheat of the land (a reclamation of the land by the overlord) would allow the owner {{to take control of}} the land. But the act of placing the land in frankalmoin left it in the hands of a group of lawyers or others who allowed the use of the land by a Church organization. The overlord would have nominal control of the corporation which had never entered into a feudal homage arrangement. The corporation owed nothing to the overlord. Bracton was sympathetic to this arrangement. According to him the lord is not really injured. His rights to the land remain unscathed. It is true they have been significantly diminished. He had suffered damnum, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>had</b> been no iniuria. Bracton was of the opinion that a gift of land to the Church could be voided by the heirs, but not the lord.|$|E

25|$|In February, {{the people}} rose again: Alexius IV was imprisoned and executed, and Murzuphlus took the purple as Alexius V. He made some attempt {{to repair the}} walls and organise the citizenry, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>had</b> been no {{opportunity}} to bring in troops from the provinces and the guards were demoralised by the revolution. An attack by the Crusaders on 6 April failed, but a second from the Golden Horn on 12 April succeeded, and the invaders poured in. Alexius V fled. The Senate met in Hagia Sophia and offered the crown to Theodore Lascaris, who had married into the Angelid family, {{but it was too}} late. He came out with the Patriarch to the Golden Milestone before the Great Palace and addressed the Varangian Guard. Then the two of them slipped away with many of the nobility and embarked for Asia. By the next day the Doge and the leading Franks were installed in the Great Palace, and the city was given over to pillage for three days.|$|E
25|$|In {{any part}} of the world that uses organophosphates, C. megacephala could prove to be beneficial. Organophosphate {{compounds}} are used in agriculture and are highly toxic. Organophosphate poisoning often causes death, and in many cases, by evaluating the body tissue and fluids, the toxin can be identified as the source of the poisoning. However, it is somewhat difficult to evaluate the body tissue in a body that is exceedingly decomposed. Nevertheless, a medical examiner in Hawaii worked on a case in which poisoning by malathion, an organophosphate insecticide, was thought to be the cause of death. The victim’s stomach contents and body fat were examined and found to have contained malathion. The fly larvae of Chrysomya megacephala and Chrysomya rufifacies were also present at the scene on the body and were tested for malathion. Both of these species did contain malathion, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>had</b> been no previous record of organophosphates in their larvae. Studying larvae from decomposed remains may provide an effective method of determining the presence of these toxins in a body that is extremely decayed.|$|E
25|$|When Carnot {{began working}} on his book, steam engines had {{achieved}} widely recognized economic and industrial importance, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>had</b> been no real scientific study of them. Newcomen had invented the first piston-operated steam engine over a century before, in 1712; some 50 years after that, James Watt made his celebrated improvements, which were responsible for greatly increasing the efficiency and practicality of steam engines. Compound engines (engines {{with more than one}} stage of expansion) had already been invented, and there was even a crude form of internal-combustion engine, with which Carnot was familiar and which he described in some detail in his book. Although there existed some intuitive understanding of the workings of engines, scientific theory for their operation was almost nonexistent. In 1824 the principle of conservation of energy was still poorly developed and controversial, and an exact formulation of the first law of thermodynamics was still more than a decade away; the mechanical equivalence of heat would not be formulated for another two decades. The prevalent theory of heat was the caloric theory, which regarded heat as a sort of weightless and invisible fluid that flowed when out of equilibrium.|$|E

Constance Lily Morris, author of On Tour with Queen Marie, {{wrote that the}} people were excited for Marie's arrival mainly because of her almost mythical allure, which had been created by papers and rumour throughout her life; she observed that [...] "the modest Queen of the Belgians [...] had once come with her king for a brief visit and years ago the dusky Hawaiian ruler had honored us, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>had</b> been no others.

500|$|Geologists such as Adam Sedgwick, and Roderick Murchison continued, in {{the course}} of {{disputes}} such as The Great Devonian Controversy, to make advances in stratigraphy. They described newly recognized geological periods, such as the Cambrian, the Silurian, the Devonian, and the Permian. Increasingly, such progress in stratigraphy depended on the opinions of experts with specialized knowledge of particular types of fossils such as William Lonsdale (fossil corals), and John Lindley (fossil plants) who both {{played a role in the}} Devonian controversy and its resolution. By the early 1840s much of the geologic time scale had been developed. In 1841, John Phillips formally divided the geologic column into three major eras, the Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and Cenozoic, based on sharp breaks in the fossil record. He identified the three periods of the Mesozoic era and all the periods of the Paleozoic era except the Ordovician. [...] His definition of the geological time scale is still used today. It remained a relative time scale with no method of assigning any of the periods' absolute dates. It was understood that not only had there been an [...] "age of reptiles" [...] preceding the current [...] "age of mammals", <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>had</b> been a time (during the Cambrian and the Silurian) when life had been restricted to the sea, and a time (prior to the Devonian) when invertebrates had been the largest and most complex forms of animal life.|$|E
