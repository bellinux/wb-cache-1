Nanoemulsions, widely used in cosmetics and pharmaceuticals industries, are a dispersion system consisting droplets with sizes ranging from 20 to 200 nm. Among the low energy methods, phase inversion temperature (PIT) method was used to prepare nanoemulsions by heating an emulsion system to a temperature close to PIT point followed by a quenching process as it works with the changes in affinity of a non-ionic surfactant with temperatures. Phase inversion process was determined by plotting the conductivity of emulsions versus temperatures. The change of the phase inversion process and the decrease of the PIT temperature, with increasing oil concentration, were more significant in <b>brine</b> <b>system</b> especially at high salt concentration. At low surfactant concentration, the nanoemulsions were monodispersed in either pure water or <b>brine</b> <b>system,</b> when R was 0. 2 to 0. 4.

Taxonomic classification of the pyrosequenced 18 S rRNA amplicon reads showed that fungi highly similar to the species identified along the Arabic coast were almost ubiquitous in the water and sediment samples, supporting their wide distribution in various environments.

The observed bulk ice gas composition was 27. 5 % O 2, 71. 4 % N 2 and 1. 09 % Ar. Most previous studies suggest that convective transport is the main driver of gas displacement in sea ice and have neglected diffusion processes. According to our data, brines were stratified within the ice, so that no convective transport could occur within the <b>brine</b> <b>system.</b> Therefore, diffusive transport was the main driver of gas migration. By analysing the temporal evolution of an internal gas peak within the ice, we deduced the bulk gas transport coefficients for oxygen (DO 2), argon (DAr) and nitrogen (DN 222). The values fit to the few existing estimates from experimental work, and are close to the diffusivity values in water (10 - 5 cm 2 s- 124). We suggest that gas bubbles escaping from the brine to the atmosphere - as the ice gets more permeable during melt could be responsible for the previously reported high transport coefficients. These results underline that when there is no convective transport within the sea ice, the transport of gas by diffusion through the brines, either in the liquid or gaseous phases, is a major factor in controlling the ocean–atmosphere exchange.
