5|$|The kulintang gong {{itself is}} {{believed}} to have <b>been</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> foreign musical elements incorporated into kulintang music, derived from the Sundanese kolenang due to its striking similarities. Along with the fact that they play important roles in their respectively ensembles, both the kulintang and kolenang show striking homogeneity in tapered rims (as opposed to pronouncedly tapered Javanese bonang and non-tapered Laotian khong vong gongs). Even the word kulintang {{is believed to}} be just an altered form of the Sundanese word kolenang.|$|E
5|$|Little is {{recorded}} of Eardwulf's family, though his father, also named Eardwulf, {{is known to}} have been a nobleman. Eardwulf was married by the time he became king, though his wife's name is not recorded. It is possible he later wed an illegitimate daughter of Charlemagne. In 798, early in his reign, Eardwulf fought a battle at Billington Moor against a nobleman named Wada, who had <b>been</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> who killed King Æthelred. Wada was defeated and driven into exile. In 801, Eardwulf led an army against Coenwulf of Mercia, perhaps because of Coenwulf's support for other claimants to the Northumbrian throne.|$|E
5|$|By the 1330s, Southampton's {{prosperity}} {{was in a}} slow decline. In 1338 {{there was}} a successful French attack on the town, during which various buildings were burned and castle was damaged. The house may have <b>been</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> damaged in the raid, as the south-western {{corner of the building}} collapsed around that time and had to be quickly rebuilt; other alterations, including the addition of a fireplace, may have been carried out at the same time. Southampton's economy collapsed {{in the aftermath of the}} attacks and never fully recovered. The character of FrenchStreet began to change, as many houses were sub-divided or redeveloped to fit in more buildings. The Medieval Merchant's House ceased to be used by major merchants and by 1392 appears to have been rented out to tenants by Thomas Fryke and John Barflet, the latter a descendent of John Fortin, for whom the house was originally built.|$|E

5|$|Hamilton {{had been}} on duty as wing {{commander}} at RAF Turnhouse near Edinburgh when Hess had arrived, and his station had <b>been</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> that had tracked {{the progress of the}} flight. He arrived at Maryhill Barracks the next morning, and after examining Hess's effects, he met alone with the prisoner. Hess immediately admitted his true identity and outlined the reason for his flight. Hamilton told Hess that he hoped to continue the conversation with the aid of an interpreter; Hess could speak English well, but was having trouble understanding Hamilton. After the meeting, Hamilton examined the remains of the Messerschmitt in the company of an intelligence officer, then returned to Turnhouse, where he made arrangements through the Foreign Office to meet Prime Minister Winston Churchill, who was at Ditchley for the weekend. They had some preliminary talks that night, and Hamilton accompanied Churchill back to London the next day, where they both met with members of the War Cabinet. Churchill sent Hamilton with foreign affairs expert Ivone Kirkpatrick, who had met Hess previously, to positively identify the prisoner, who had been moved to Buchanan Castle overnight. Hess, who had prepared extensive notes to use during this meeting, spoke to them at length about Hitler's expansionary plans and the need for Britain to let the Nazis have free rein in Europe, in exchange for being allowed to keep its overseas possessions. Kirkpatrick held two more meetings with Hess {{over the course of the}} next few days, while Hamilton returned to his duties. Hess, in addition to being disappointed at the apparent failure of his mission, began claiming that his medical treatment was inadequate and that there was a plot afoot to poison him.|$|E
25|$|The {{onset of}} the Great Depression in 1929–1930 {{substantially}} reduced international trade, and many mercantile vessels were laid up in this period {{due to lack of}} work.

500|$|A 1937 Salt Lake Tribune article stated that, {{after the}} 1913 controversies, reproductions of September Morn were shown [...] "on {{the front page}} of every {{newspaper}} in the land". Ortiz required these newspapers to pay a charge and mention his copyright, otherwise face a penalty of $500 to $1000; Chase recalled that Vogue had <b>been</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> charged. These newspaper reproductions, however, were sometimes censored. Fred L. Boalt of The Seattle Star, covering a local exhibit of a reproduction, explained his newspaper's rationale for such censorship: [...] "For humane as well as other reasons, [...] the Star artist has painted in a short petticoat. He didn't want to do it. He suffered. But we made him do it." ...|$|E
500|$|Uzanne never married, and {{in later}} life he wrote in praise of celibacy; however, {{according}} to Remy de Gourmont, in writing about women Uzanne would not have <b>been</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> authors who [...] "exalted ambrosia without having tasted it". Uzanne's feelings toward women, {{as well as those}} of Jules Barbey d'Aurevilly, were ambivalent in nature, a mixture of attraction and indifference. He also explored the concept of woman artists, subscribing to the view that women lack creative ability, a quality he associated solely with men: [...] "The curious and paradoxical physiologist [...] has argued that the woman genius does not exist, and when such genius manifests itself it is a hoax of nature; in this sense, she is male." [...] Based on that, Uzanne said that women artists perpetrated mediocre studies and exhibitions of painting and sculpture, and used this argument to support the idea that gender difference is the foundation of creativity.|$|E
500|$|According to Davies, in {{an early}} draft, Elton would have been witness to more events in Doctor Who history: in this draft, Elton's third {{birthday}} party was evacuated because of the Dalek invasion of Shoreditch (Remembrance of the Daleks), his mother {{was killed by a}} plastic daffodil (Terror of the Autons) instead of an elemental shade, and he also would have <b>been</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> who saw the Loch Ness Monster rising from the Thames (Terror of the Zygons). Prior to the revival of Doctor Who, Davies had considered pitching this story idea to Doctor Who Magazine as a comics story. Davies had also considered making the viewpoint character of the story a woman but felt that he already had enough focus on female guest characters that series. Davies wanted Elton to be a [...] "normal guy" [...] and not geeky with a [...] "funny voice". It is noted Elton's memory may not be entirely reliable, so whether events in the episode happened the way he remembers them is debatable.|$|E

500|$|After the loss, {{there were}} calls for Playford {{to be offered}} the post of Governor of South Australia or Governor-General of Australia, but nothing came of that. Playford {{continued}} to lead the LCL opposition for a further {{one and a half}} years until he relinquished the leadership. In the subsequent ballot, Steele Hall, a small farmer like Playford, won and led the LCL to victory at the following election with the Playmander still in place. Contrary to perceptions, Playford was loath to favour or groom a successor, and he did not publicly hint at whom he voted for in the leadership ballot; there was speculation that the former premier may have <b>been</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> who abstained from the vote. Playford retired from politics at the same time, presumably for reasons of age, but stated that [...] "I couldn't cope with the change in the attitudes of some MPs, even some in the highest places... I found I could no longer cope with the change... I can't handle a liar who doesn't turn a hair while he's lying... I decided I couldn't take it any longer".|$|E
500|$|Richardson {{had gained}} a {{national}} {{reputation as a}} great actor while at the Old Vic; films gave {{him the opportunity to}} reach an international audience. Unlike some of his theatre colleagues, he was never condescending about film work. He admitted that film could be [...] "a cage for an actor, but a cage in which they sometimes put a little gold", but he did not regard filming as merely a means of subsidising his much less profitable stage work. He said, [...] "I've never <b>been</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> chaps who scoff at films. I think they're a marvellous medium, and are to the stage what engravings are to painting. The theatre may give you big chances, but the cinema teaches you the details of craftsmanship." [...] The Fallen Idol was followed by Richardson's first Hollywood part. He played Dr Sloper, the overprotective father of Olivia de Havilland in The Heiress, [...] based on Henry James's novel Washington Square. The film did not prosper at the box-office despite good reviews, [...] an Academy Award for Best Actress for Havilland, and nominations for the director (William Wyler) and Richardson.|$|E
500|$|In 1974, {{a writer}} began sending {{articles}} to Pagan newsletter The Wiccan, then edited by the Gardnerian Wiccan John Score, articulating an alternative account of Pickingill's life and {{relation to the}} British occult movement. First identifying himself only as [...] "a well wisher", he later began using the pseudonym Lugh, named for the Irish mythological figure. In 1977, Lugh ceased sending the articles to The Wiccan and instead began publishing them in a rival British magazine, The Cauldron, edited by Michael Howard; {{he claimed to have}} switched outlets because The Wiccan had been too dominated by Gardnerian perspectives. Lugh later revealed his name to be E.W. [...] "Bill" [...] Liddell, describing himself as an Englishman born in Essex. He added that circa 1960 he had moved to Auckland, New Zealand, before later relocating to Australia, from where he wrote his articles. In a 1984 letter he [...] noted that he was not born with the surname of Liddell but had instead adopted it later in life. Claiming that Pickingill had been the first-cousin of his paternal great-great grandfather, Liddell asserted that he had been initiated into his family's hereditary form of witchcraft in 1950, and that he had subsequently been initiated into both the Gardnerian and Alexandrian traditions of Wicca. His partner, Sylvia Tatham, had been heavily involved {{in the development of the}} Alexandrian tradition in the early 1960s, having <b>been</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> present when its founder, Alex Sanders, was initiated into the Gardnerian tradition. In 1982, Wiccan Publications collected together and published these articles as two pamphlets: Old George Pickingill and the Roots of Modern Witchcraft and Medieval Witchcraft and the Freemasons. The articles were republished in one single volume in 1994 as The Pickingill Papers, edited by Liddell and Howard.|$|E

2500|$|The ‘argument from hallucination’ has {{traditionally}} <b>been</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> used by {{proponents of the}} philosophical theory of representationalism against direct realism. [...] Representationalism holds that when perceiving the world {{we are not in}} direct contact with it, as common sense suggests, but only in direct contact with a representation of the world in consciousness. [...] That representation may be a more or less accurate one depending on our circumstances, the state of our health, and so on. [...] Direct realism, on the other hand, holds that the common sense or unthinking view of perception is correct, and that when perceiving the world we should be regarded as in direct contact with it, unmediated by any representation in consciousness.|$|E
2500|$|After this, {{there are}} no {{historical}} records about Chares for several years, during which he probably resided at Sigeion, which, according to Theopompus, was his favourite residence. But in a speech by Demosthenes delivered in 341 BC, Chares is spoken of as possessing much influence {{at that time in}} the Athenian councils. [...] Therefore, it is possible that Chares may have <b>been</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> who authorized and defended the proceedings of Diopeithes against king Philip in Thrace. In 340 BC, he was appointed to the command of the force which was sent to aid Byzantium against Philip; but he was distrusted by the Byzantines, and they refused to receive him. Chares was ineffective against the Macedonians—his only exploits it is said were against the allies of Athens, whom he appears to plundered unscrupulously. He was accordingly superseded by Phocion, who was very successful.|$|E
