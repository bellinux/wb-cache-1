500|$|The animators {{were told}} to make a {{detailed}} replica of the city. David Silverman was sent to Manhattan to take hundreds of pictures {{of the city and}} areas around the World Trade Center. When he returned, Lance Wilder and his team spent time creating new scenes and backgrounds, incorporating small details such as signs and hundreds of extras that would correctly illustrate the city. Oakley and Weinstein were pleased with the final results, and both noted that the buildings, streets, and even elevator cabins were detailed closely to their real life counterparts. In the final scene, as the family is seen driving away from New York on the George Washington Bridge, the credits roll with the [...] "camera" [...] gradually pulling back from a view of the car, to a view of the side, and then on to a panorama view of the city; as if the whole sequence was being shot from a helicopter. To achieve this effect, a computer model of the bridge pulling out was made and then printed out. With the print outs, photocopies were made traced onto the animation cels. The process took a long time and was expensive, as the use of computer animation was not widespread when the episode was produced. Director Jim Reardon wanted to replicate films that ended in a similar way, and commented, [...] "I remembered that every movie located in New York would pull <b>back</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> were leaving town on a bridge." [...] Shortly before the episode aired, the production staff contacted Fox to make sure they would not run commercials during the credits.|$|E
2500|$|Carolyn Van Wyck wrote {{a column}} for Photoplay, an {{upmarket}} magazine that featured articles on pop culture, advice on fashion, and even articles on helping readers channel their inner celebrity. In March 1926 an anonymous young woman wrote in describing petting as a problem, explaining [...] "The boys all seem {{to do it and}} don't seem to come <b>back</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> don't do it also. We girls are at our wits' end to know what to do. ... I'm sure that I don't want to marry anyone who is too slow to want to pet. But I want to discover what is right. Please help me." [...] Van Wyck sympathized with the problem the writer faced and added, [...] "It seems to me much better to be known as a flat tire and keep romance in one's mind than to be called a hot date and have fear in one's heart." ...|$|E
2500|$|Responding {{to recent}} Java {{security}} and vulnerability issues, security blogger Brian Krebs {{has called for}} users to remove at least the Java browser plugin and also the entire software. [...] "I {{look forward to a}} world without the Java plugin (and to not having to remind readers about quarterly patch updates) but it will probably be years before various versions of this plugin are mostly removed from end-user systems worldwide."" [...] "Once promising, it has outlived its usefulness in the browser, and has become a nightmare that delights cyber-criminals at the expense of computer users." [...] "I think everyone should uninstall Java from all their PCs and Macs, and then think carefully about whether they need to add it <b>back.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> are a typical home user, you can probably do without it. If you are a business user, you may not have a choice." ...|$|E

We'll sell the coats off our <b>backs,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> wish it. You shall never lose one {{shilling}} by Rubb and Mackenzie as long as I {{have anything to do with}} the firm. But I'm sure you will excuse me if I say that we can do nothing at the bidding of that old cormorant." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I oughtn't to {{have come}} <b>back.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> had not sent father, I would not have come. He's determined, but he's gentle. You know he sympathizes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This {{comes of}} driving 'em home," [...] she remarked. [...] "They always {{know the way}} <b>back</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> do that. They {{ought to have been}} carted over." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Are {{you staying}} over here, James? There {{is no reason}} why you should not come <b>back,</b> too. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> make up your mind to change your habits--" ...|$|R
6000|$|Ethelbertha said: [...] "If {{you want}} to wash yourselves when you have done you might go into the <b>back</b> kitchen, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> don't mind; the girls have just {{finished}} the bedrooms." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes; {{you come}} <b>back</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> don't find nothing. The tea and bread ain't much, and I don't mind it, and it's company {{to me to}} have you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{insist on}} knowing what binds {{you to that}} man," [...] I said. [...] "Let him come <b>back!</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> won't answer my question, I will put it to him." ...|$|E

6000|$|They {{stood looking}} at each other, and he said, {{with a kind of}} passionate self-denial, [...] "Yes, think it over for me, too. I will come <b>back,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> will let me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "At {{the next}} town we reach we can hire a horse," [...] said Matt. [...] "And you can go <b>back</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> wish. There is no telling how long this chase may last." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{he agreed}} {{with a hint of}} strain; [...] "it hurts very much. But you never leave them altogether. Things change, of course, but you can come <b>back</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> are wanted." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I thought {{somebody}} was dead," [...] said Agatha, [...] "you all look so funereal. Now, mamma, put your handkerchief <b>back</b> again. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> cry I will give Miss Wilson {{a piece of}} my mind for worrying you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{for some}} reason, Sir James is keen about {{bringing}} <b>you</b> <b>back,</b> and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> state the terms on which you'll come, I imagine he'll agree.

6000|$|... "No; {{let us go}} out and get {{a breath}} of air by the river-side. Come! take your hood and fan--it is getting dark--nobody will see us, and we can come <b>back</b> here, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> like, in half an hour." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "And as I {{think it}} {{not at all}} {{improbable}} that I may go <b>back</b> again, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> don't mind it, I will refuse." [...] Of course after that the Duke had no further arguments to use in favour of Sir Timothy's proposition.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Toad bowed very low. 'Yes'm,' said he very humbly. 'I'll {{go right}} <b>back</b> there <b>if</b> <b>you</b> say so. I thought {{there must be}} some things worth finding out on the land, and that I might be of some use in the Great World.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing," [...] the {{solicitor}} answered. [...] "Come <b>back,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> {{can make}} any definite arrangement, or telephone. The matter is really bothering me a little. I don't {{want to have}} the other people slip in now."...|$|E
