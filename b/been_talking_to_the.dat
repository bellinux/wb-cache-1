25|$|In the 2007–08 season, Kidd {{became the}} third player {{to get a}} triple-double in three {{straight}} games since 1989. He did so after he logged his 97th career triple-double in a 115–99 loss to the Charlotte Bobcats. Kidd was voted by the fans to start in the 2008 All-Star game in New Orleans as a guard along with Dwyane Wade. During that season Kidd had been mentioned in trade rumors, notably to the Los Angeles Lakers, but the deal fell through when the Lakers {{refused to give up}} their young center Andrew Bynum. On January 28, 2008, Kidd revealed that his agent had <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Nets' front office about a trade. On February 19, 2008, Kidd was traded to the Dallas Mavericks, the team that originally drafted him.|$|E
500|$|During the {{protracted}} negotiations, {{the company}} had also <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Aire and Calder about compartment boats, {{which resulted in a}} proposal to jointly fund and build a canal from Bramwith to the Aire and Calder. The [...] New Junction Canal was authorised in 1891, and finally opened in 1905. This removed the need to build a new port at Keadby, and the planned upgrade to take larger vessels was also shelved, because the company were unable to raise significant working capital. Despite the lack of investment and the difficulties of the First World War, the waterways were still quite busy, with traffic recovering from 381,727 tons in 1926, the year of the general strike, to over 800,000 tons in 1937. Bramwith lock, the first on the Stainforth and Keadby, was lengthened in 1932, and a new colliery layby was constructed to enable compartment boats to reach Hatfield Main Colliery. Stainforth lock, which connected the canal to the River Don, was closed in 1939. The winter of 1947 was particularly severe, and the Stainforth and Keadby was closed for a period due to ice. After the Second World War, the canals of the Sheffield and South Yorkshire Navigation were nationalised on 1 January 1948, together with most other operational canals in Britain.|$|E
