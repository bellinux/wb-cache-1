Up to twenty veterinarians worked at the shows {{to make sure the}} dogs were healthy and behaved. All of the dogs at the show had to stay on their benches until 10 PM when the show doors would close. They could only leave their benches at certain times to exercise. All of the Detroit Kennel Club <b>shows</b> are <b>benched</b> <b>shows</b> so that the audience can meet and pet the dogs. Today there are only five other <b>benched</b> <b>shows</b> in the United States including Chicago, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Portland and New York.The largest entry at the club was 3798 dogs in 1978.

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the feasibility of a 1 D tensile/compression force sensor for mechatronic systems. The main issue to address is the sensing of the static force component, dynamic force sensing is also required. Measurements on a test <b>bench</b> <b>show</b> that for a given vibration mode of the piezoelectric structure, the applied force (stress) has an effect on the material frequency response (electrical admittance). Furthermore, the sensitivity depends on the surrounding materials used in the resonant structure. Key elements are drawn based on the measurements to support modeling and optimal design activities...|$|E

40|$|AbstractâLow Voltage Ride Through is an {{important}} feature for wind turbine systems to fulfill grid code requirements. In case of wind turbine technologies using doubly fed induction generators the reaction to grid voltage disturbances is sensitive. Hardware or software protection must be implemented to protect the converter from tripping during severe grid voltage faults. In this paper two methods for {{low voltage ride through}} of symmetrical grid voltage dips are investigated. As a basis, an analysis of the rotor voltages during grid fault is given. First, the conventional hardware method using a crowbar is introduced. Then the stator current reference feedback solution is presented. Both methods are investigated and compared by simulation results using 2 MW wind turbine system parameters. Measurement results on a 22 kW laboratory DFIG test <b>bench</b> <b>show</b> the effectiveness of the proposed control technique. I...|$|E

In case of wind turbine technologies using doubly fed induction generators the reaction to grid voltage disturbances is sensible. Hardware or software protection must be implemented to protect the converter from tripping during severe grid voltage faults. In this paper the Dynamic Voltage Restorer (DVR) solution for LVRT of DFIG wind turbines is investigated by simulation results using a detailed converter model considering the switching and appropriate 2 MW wind turbine system parameter.

Different sensors were fabricated, starting from the thin grating approximation (TGA), where the grating thickness is deprecated. Then, these devices were modified by varying etching depths and duty cycles. The sensors were modeled utilizing the equivalent layer approximation (ELA), and then the coupling angles were measured in the optical <b>bench,</b> <b>showing</b> an excellent agreement between model and reality. The same approximation was used to investigate how to improve the sensitivity of these devices.
