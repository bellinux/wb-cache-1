50|$|Lucas {{continued}} {{drilling and}} on January 10, 1901, {{at a depth}} of 1,139 ft (347 m), {{what is known as the}} Lucas Gusher or the Lucas Geyser <b>blew</b> <b>oil</b> over 150 ft in the air at a rate of (4,200,000 gallons). It took nine days before the well was brought under control.|$|R
50|$|The {{end result}} of too high an oil {{pressure}} is the front or rear main engine seals will be blown and or <b>blow</b> the <b>oil</b> plugs out. In other words any possible entry into the crankcase that is sealed somehow could be <b>blown.</b> High <b>oil</b> pressure frequently means extremely high pressure on cold start-up, {{but this is a}} design flaw rather than an automatic consequence of high pressure. The observation “if you raise the maximum pressure, the cold pressure goes too high” is accurate, but not intentional.|$|R
50|$|Some {{common types}} of oils {{that can be}} <b>blown</b> include linseed <b>oil,</b> {{rapeseed}} oil, castor oil and soybean oil.|$|R
5000|$|The {{pollution}} {{threat to}} Cape Province beaches was initially considered [...] "enormous", {{according to a}} Cape Town port official. He said that the current could move the oil slick away from the coast but that a [...] northwesterly wind could <b>blow</b> the <b>oil</b> towards the coast.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an investigation on the strategies {{to increase the}} post consumer HDPE recycling of extrusion <b>blow</b> molded <b>oil</b> containers in Australia and proposes a novel oil drain rack designed to drain out the residual oil effectively from the used oil containers, based on {{the requirements of the}} clients...|$|R
5000|$|A {{small amount}} (generally 1-2nL) of {{solution}} is pipetted or <b>blown</b> into the <b>oil</b> in the wells using a micrometer syringe or a pulled capillary tube.|$|R

5000|$|The {{oil system}} has a wet sump which {{contains}} 16 quarts of SAE 70 mineral or synthetic racing oil. The pan {{is made of}} titanium or aluminum. Titanium {{can be used to}} prevent oil spills {{in the event of a}} <b>blown</b> rod. <b>Oil</b> pump pressure is somewhere around [...] during the run, [...] at start up, but actual figures differ between teams.|$|R
50|$|On September 21, militant unionists <b>blew</b> up an <b>oil</b> {{tank and}} a wooden mine structure. Four union members were killed, and twenty-seven union members, {{including}} Ed Boyce, were jailed. The strike was crushed.|$|R
50|$|Many of Ashe's {{paintings}} {{depicted the}} life of the working man in manufacturing and labor.Often the subject matter centered on industry jobs like steel-making, glass <b>blowing,</b> and <b>oil</b> drilling. In 1938, a series of his three paintings were commissioned for the Steidle Building of the College of Earth and Mineral Sciences at Pennsylvania State University, in University Park. These images portrayed the three major areas of business in Pennsylvania: steel, coal, and petroleum.|$|R
5000|$|Early twentieth-century {{drilling}} technology lacked such modern {{safety features}} as blowout preventers. When drilling reached 2440 ft on 14 March 1910, pressurized <b>oil</b> <b>blew</b> through well casing above the bit. An estimated [...] escaped before the gusher was {{brought under control}} in September 1911.|$|R
50|$|With a roar like {{a hundred}} express trains racing across the countryside, the well <b>blew</b> out, spewing <b>oil</b> in all directions. The derrick simply evaporated. Casings wilted like lettuce out of water, as heavy {{machinery}} writhed and twisted into grotesque shapes in the blazing inferno.|$|R
50|$|Taubira {{was married}} twice. She has four {{children}} with her second husband, Roland Delannon. They are divorced. Delannon is a separatist politician {{who founded the}} Decolonization and Social Emancipation Movement; he was jailed for 18 months for planning to <b>blow</b> up an <b>oil</b> and gas facility in the 1980s.|$|R
5000|$|The {{creation}} of Al Akhawayn University was largely funded by King Fahd of Saudi Arabia from an endowment {{intended for the}} cleanup of an oil spill {{off the coast of}} Morocco. The cleanup was never realized as the wind <b>blew</b> the <b>oil</b> spill away and the endowment was used to create the university. Al Akhawayn University was founded by Royal Decree (Dahir) in 1993 and officially inaugurated by the former King Hassan II of Morocco on January 16, 1995. The Arabic name al-akhawayn, literally the [...] "two brothers," [...] refers to the two respective kings.|$|R
5000|$|It {{was terribly}} {{frustrating}} because I remember I started with, [...] "Who am I? Why am I here?" [...] and I never {{got back to}} that because there was never an opportunity for me to explain my life to people. It was so different from Quayle and Gore. The four years in solitary confinement in Vietnam, seven-and-a-half years in prisons, drop the first bomb that started the ... American bombing raid in the North Vietnam. We <b>blew</b> the <b>oil</b> storage tanks of them off the map. And I never—I couldn't approach—I don't say it just to brag, but, I mean, my sensitivities are completely different.|$|R
50|$|Dana, meanwhile, {{extremely}} depressed {{about her}} unspectacular {{role in the}} mission, is summoned {{to the head of}} the commune's office. There, she and Eve, another cult member, are told that they are to participate in a Help Earth mission to <b>blow</b> up an <b>oil</b> tanker. Her attempts to warn the mission controllers fail, and she ends up having to stop the attack herself.|$|R
50|$|Guffey and Galey {{hired the}} Hamill {{brothers}} of Corsicana, Texas, the best rotary drillers available. Al and Curt Hamill arrived in Beaumont and began drilling on the adjoining McFaddin-Weiss & Kyle {{tract of land}} in October 1900. In spite of tremendous difficulties they reached 1,000 feet by Christmas. After returning from the holidays, they encountered new problems. Upon reaching solid rock, their drill lodged in a crevice at 1,060 feet. At approximately 10:30 a.m. on January 10, 1901, while the Hamill brothers were attempting to free their drill from the crevice, the famous Lucas Gusher <b>blew</b> in. <b>Oil</b> sprayed more than 100 feet above the derrick for nine days until the well was capped.|$|R
60|$|More every instant did he {{hate the}} clamor of the gale and {{the stream of}} minute drops of <b>oil,</b> <b>blown</b> back from the engine, that spattered his face. His ears {{strained}} for misfire of the engine, if it stopped he would be hurled to earth. And one cylinder was not working. He forgot that; kept the cloche moving; fought the wind with his will as with his body.|$|R
50|$|Authorities {{were unable}} to give an exact number of casualties, but the final number of {{confirmed}} dead was over 200 people. At least 150 people were at some time after the accident hospitalized after suffering burns. Railway services {{to the south of}} the country were cut off dealing another <b>blow</b> to Cameroon's <b>oil</b> industry, following a series of border skirmishes with Nigerian troops over control of the area two years previously.|$|R
50|$|Inasmuch as Oloibiri {{town was}} the 'birthplace' {{of oil in}} Nigeria, it is a sight for sore eyes. The place is under-developed, the people are poor peasants, the {{epidemic}} rate is off the charts, {{the unemployment rate is}} alarming, and their land has suffered deadly <b>blows</b> from <b>oil</b> spills. The oil in Oloibiri has since dried up but there is nothing to show that it was the place where Nigeria's oil breakthrough started. In plain terms, it could be said that the town of Oloibiri was used and 'dumped' after the oil explorers found no more use for it. Interestingly and disappointingly, the Federal Government of Nigeria once promised to build a museum in Oloibiri, but till date, that promise has not been fulfilled.|$|R
50|$|Towards {{the end of}} {{the third}} Grand Prix des Nations (1950), the engine of Alberto Ascari's Ferrari 340 <b>blew</b> up, pouring <b>oil</b> onto the corner at {{the end of the}} Avenue de la Paix. Behind him Luigi Villoresi, in a Ferrari 275, could not avoid the oil, his car skidded, went over the {{security}} barrier and ploughed into the crowd. Three spectators were killed, another twenty were injured. Villoresi survived with a severely fractured leg.|$|R
5000|$|On 9 August 2016, Niger Delta Greenland Justice Mandate {{declared}} its existence {{and threatened to}} destroy refineries in Port Harcourt and Warri within 48 hours, {{as well as a}} gas plant in Otu Jeremi within a few days. The next day, the group reportedly blew up a major oil pipeline operated by the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) in Isoko. On 12 August, the group warned that it will <b>blow</b> up additional <b>oil</b> installations in the future.|$|R
50|$|J.R. {{wanted the}} price of American crude to rise and {{he wanted it to}} happen as soon as possible. He met with General Longly, who was sacked from the {{military}} for war mongering. He put J.R. in touch with B.D. Calhoun who would go to the Middle East and start trouble by <b>blowing</b> up <b>oil</b> wells. However, the CIA had Calhoun under surveillance and made this known to J.R., who wanted out. However, B.D. would hold J.R. to his promise. J.R. informed the CIA as to Calhoun's mission, and the mission failed, with Calhoun's mercenaries dying in the process. Calhoun blamed J.R. for the whole mess and set out to exact revenge. B.D. kidnapped John Ross and threatened to kill him, but Ray killed B.D. in time. The CIA was involved and decided on a cover up to keep their involvement secret.|$|R

50|$|The {{race was}} {{dramatically}} {{won by the}} Ron Hodgson Motors entered Holden LH Torana SL/R 5000 L34 of Bob Morris and British driver John Fitzpatrick. The car slowed in the final laps trailing smoke but made to the finish. Television commentators and motoring journalists reported {{at the time that}} the Torana had broken an axle plus was having engine problems which accounted for the smoke. It was only later did the teams chief mechanic Bruce Richardson discover that there was no broken axle or engine trouble. What was actually slowing the car was a <b>blown</b> gearbox <b>oil</b> seal. The oil was leaking out onto the clutch causing it to slip badly. Second on the same lap was Holden Dealer Team Torana L34 of Colin Bond and John Harvey. Brothers Peter and Phil Brock in the Bill Patterson entered Torana L34 completed a second consecutive podium clean sweep for the Torana L34. In fact, Torana L34s filled the top seven places.|$|R
50|$|Rookie Jim Guthrie {{survived a}} slow, attrition-filled race to capture his first IRL victory. A {{seemingly}} minor design detail (an oil line fitting on the Oldsmobile Aurora engine) resulted in <b>blown</b> engines and <b>oil</b> spills throughout the afternoon. Tony Stewart assumed the lead {{at the start}} as expected, but was dogged by persistent rookie Jim Guthrie in his unsponsored car (for which {{he had taken a}} second mortgage on his house). The race got off with two caution flags in the first twenty laps, one for Arie Luyendyk's blown engine, the first of many throughout the day.|$|R
5000|$|As {{its name}} suggests, {{it is the}} first oil well in the Arabian side of the Persian Gulf and is located in Bahrain. The well is {{situated}} below Jebel Dukhan. It was operated by Bahrain Petroleum Company. Oil first spurted from this well on 16 October 1931, and the well finally began to <b>blow</b> heads of <b>oil</b> on the morning of 2 June 1932. The initial oil flow rate was by the 1970s the well produced , and after that it stabilized at about [...] Close to the well, which has been reconstructed to its first appearance, is a stable.|$|R
50|$|Kuwait and Saudi Arabia {{suffered}} gross {{environmental damage}} {{as a result}} of the Iraqi occupation, as the retreating Iraqi forces <b>blew</b> up <b>oil</b> wells and released millions of barrels (estimated as high as 11 million barrels) of crude oil into the Persian Gulf. In Kuwait the damage to the environment was largely terrestrial in the form of tarcrete and oil lakes surrounding the damaged wells. In 2001 the UNCC awarded Kuwait $108 million (the money to be taken from the Oil-for-food program) to study the effects of the environmental devastation to the desert and the coastline, and the effects of the oil fires on public health. Most of Kuwait's desert is in fact sparse shrubland and capable of sustaining sheep, goats and camels. Little damage was found to Kuwait's shoreline and fishing industry. As a result of these studies claims were prepared for several billion dollars worth of damages to the desert ecosystem resulting from the oil fires, uncontrolled oil releases, and military maneuvers by both Iraqi forces and coalition military.|$|R
6000|$|A {{service is}} finishing. The monks are seen {{on each side}} of the [...] altar {{kneeling}} in two rows. They are clad in grey gowns and their [...] heads are shaven. They sing the invocation to Buddha, repeating the [...] same words over and over again in a monotonous chaunt. DAISY [...] stands outside the sanctuary door, on the steps, listlessly. [...] The AMAH is squatting by her side. Now the service ends; the [...] monks form a procession and two by two, still singing, come down [...] the steps and go out. A tiny acolyte <b>blows</b> out the <b>oil</b> lamps and [...] with an effort shuts the temple doors.|$|R
50|$|During World War II, Yenangyaung was the {{location}} of a strategically and tactically important oil refinery. As a result of the speed and success of the Japanese advance through Burma during the Burma Campaign and the Battle of Yenangyaung, the retreating Allied forces were forced to <b>blow</b> up the <b>oil</b> fields and refinery to prevent them falling {{into the hands of the}} Japanese. This difficult task was left to a small group of men who had experience with explosives and demolitions, some from serving with the Bombay Pioneers, part of the British Indian Army, in World War I. The oil facilities were destroyed at 10 pm on 16 April 1942.|$|R
5000|$|There was {{drama in}} the final four laps. On lap 77, Andretti's engine <b>blew</b> and laid <b>oil</b> in turn 9 as he pulled into the pits. Patrese spun his Shadow in the turn 9 oil and into the second Hesketh of Rupert Keegan, which had crashed earlier in the race and had been left {{on the side of the}} track. Vittorio Brambilla then hit the oil and also spun his Surtees, {{collecting}} the wreckages of Keegan's and Patrese's cars. Danny Ongais was next in the Interscope Penske, but was able to continue. Finally Villeneuve spun, staying on the track only to break a driveshaft trying to pull away and retiring.|$|R
5000|$|On 3 January 2017, {{the militant}} {{wing of the}} ASMLA, the Brigades of the Martyrs Al-Nasser Mohiuddin, claimed to have <b>blown</b> up two <b>oil</b> {{pipelines}} in western Khuzestan province; the claim was denied by the Iranian government in Tehran, which maintained {{that there was no}} unrest in its Arab population. The ASMLA declared that the targeted pipelines had been completely destroyed, inflicting [...] "major damage and heavy fuel losses." [...] Following the attack, one of the field commanders of the Mohiuddin Brigade stated that 2017 would be different from previous years, as the movement had prepared a precise, specific plan of significant srikes against the vital, sensitive economic center of the [...] "Persian Enemy." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{weather was}} hot and at the start, and Musso took the lead. Maserati {{privateer}} Horace Gould hit a mechanic who was slow {{to get off the}} grid. Vanwall's challenge was blunted on the first lap when Brooks retired with mechanical troubles. Moss took the lead from Musso on lap two but the two car remained together. Fangio ran third but the field thinned out quickly as the hot temperatures took their tool with Lewis-Evans losing nearly a lap because of two tire failures, Behra suffering an engine failure. On lap 10 Musso disappeared when his engine <b>blew,</b> the <b>oil</b> causing Fangio to have a spin which damaged one of his wheels. By the time Fangio rejoined Moss was un-catchable. Moss's lead was even able to stop for a drink and to have his oil topped up, and he won the race ahead of Fangio. Schell finished third with Gregory fourth and Lewis-Evans grabbing fifth {{at the end of the}} race from the fourth Maserati factory driver Giorgio Scarlatti. The Coppa Acerbo was never again to be used for a Formula One championship race; the race was last held in 1961 as a sportscar race.|$|R
25|$|On lap four, {{the engine}} in Jody Scheckter's Tyrrell <b>blew,</b> and the <b>oil</b> dumping onto the circuit caused Alan Jones and Mark Donohue to crash. Three laps later, Hunt also slipped {{in the oil}} and crashed. The top three had become Andretti, Watson, and Stommelen. Watson's car {{suffered}} from vibrations and dropped out. Andretti's rear suspension lasted only seven more laps before it failed, causing him to crash out of the lead. Jean-Pierre Jarier and Brambilla stopped to change tyres, whilst Tom Pryce and Tony Brise tangled. Stommelen was now in the top spot, followed by Pace, Ronnie Peterson, Jochen Mass, and Ickx. On lap 24, Peterson was out after he tangled with François Migault while trying to lap the Frenchman.|$|R
5000|$|On 24 September, Niger Delta Avengers {{claimed they}} had blown up the Bonny pipeline. On 27 September, a militant group calling itself Niger Delta Volunteers (NDV) warned the {{government}} that it will cripple all its infrastructure that generated income, describing the bombing by Avengers on Bonny pipeline as a [...] "child's play". It also warned oil companies to evacuate their staff and suspend their operations, adding that their next strike will be deadly. Meanwhile, Niger Delta Justice Defence Group (NDJDG) <b>blew</b> up an <b>oil</b> pipeline in Gokana. On 28 September, NDJDG warned Buhari that they will destroy any national asset he tries to sell. Meanwhile, a militant was killed in clashes between NDA and Imo Security Network in Owerri. On 29 September, NDGJM claimed it had blown up the Unenurhie-Evwreni pipeline belonging to the NPDC.|$|R
