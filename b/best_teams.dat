5|$|Centre College {{was a small}} {{college in}} Danville, Kentucky. From 1917 to 1924, Centre {{compiled}} a 57–8 record while playing {{against some of the}} <b>best</b> <b>teams</b> in the nation. The 1919 team first brought the Praying Colonels to national attention. In 1921, the school's student body numbered just 274.|$|E

30|$|The {{main idea}} of the {{two-level}} framework is that the top- 2 <b>best</b> <b>team</b> can be discovered {{if and only if}} the top- 1 <b>best</b> <b>team</b> is found first. In other words, after excluding the top- 1 <b>best</b> <b>team</b> from the solution space, not only the size of the solution space is shrunken, but also the global top- 2 <b>best</b> <b>team</b> must be the local top- 1 <b>best</b> <b>team</b> in the shrunken solution space. The function of finding the local top- 1 <b>best</b> <b>team</b> is denoted as the top- 1 function in the first level, which will be described in details as the approximation algorithm and the exact algorithm in Sects. 3.2 and 3.3, respectively.|$|R

5|$|Harbaugh made {{headlines}} {{prior to the}} season by claiming 2007 would be Carroll's last year with USC before departing to the NFL, drawing a terse rebuke from Carroll; Harbaugh later called the 2007Trojans one of the <b>best</b> <b>teams</b> in history at the Pac-10 Media Day, reiterating the position in the week before their game. However, there were no hard feelings between the coaches. The two kept in cordial phone contact and Carroll made light of Harbaugh's comments {{several times during the}} season.|$|E
5|$|The {{all-time record}} between the clubs stood at 3–2 {{in favor of}} Seattle. The Sounders had beaten the Union {{earlier in the year}} during league play, but Philadelphia had {{improved}} since then. By the time of the final, the Union had a 10-game unbeaten streak at home. Seattle had recently lost three of five MLS matches but was still one of the <b>best</b> <b>teams</b> in the league. Seattle was the favorite, with one pundit comparing Philadelphia to perennial underdog Rocky Balboa of the film series Rocky.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{was neither}} aesthetically nor {{technically}} {{among the best}} batsmen, Leyland {{had a reputation for}} batting well under pressure. He performed most effectively against the <b>best</b> <b>teams</b> and bowlers, and in difficult situations; his Test batting record is better than his first-class figures, and against Australia his average is even higher. Outside of Tests, he had some success with the ball, and {{had it not been for}} the depth of spin bowling in Yorkshire, he might have been a leading bowler. He was one of the first to bowl left-arm wrist-spin, and may have invented the name to describe such deliveries—"chinamen". Very popular with team-mates and spectators, Leyland had a reputation as a humorist, and many stories were told about him.|$|E

5|$|Aston Villa Football Club {{were formed}} in March 1874, {{by members of}} the Villa Cross Wesleyan Chapel in Handsworth which is now part of Birmingham. The four founders of Aston Villa were Jack Hughes, Frederick Matthews, Walter Price and William Scattergood. Aston Villa's first match was against the local Aston Brook St Mary's Rugby team. As a {{condition}} of the match, the Villa side had to agree to play the first half under Rugby rules and the second half under Association rules. After moving to the Wellington Road ground in 1876, Villa soon established themselves as one of the <b>best</b> <b>teams</b> in the Midlands, winning their first honour, the Birmingham Senior Cup in 1880, under the captaincy of Scotsman George Ramsay.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, Virginia Tech {{received}} its first bid to a Bowl Coalition game. The Bowl Coalition, predecessor {{to the modern}} Bowl Championship Series, was intended to match up the two <b>best</b> <b>teams</b> in the Sugar, Orange, Fiesta, and Rose Bowls, with the two highest-ranked teams playing in a National Championship Game. Following the 1995-1996 college football season, Virginia Tech was selected {{to play in the}} 1995 Sugar Bowl {{as a result of this}} coalition. The No. 13 Hokies, who finished 9–2 during the regular season and were named Big East Conference champions, played against the No. 9 University of Texas, who finished 10–1–1 during the regular season en route to becoming Southwest Conference champions.|$|E
5|$|In the 2003 offseason, veteran stars Gary Payton and Karl Malone {{signed with}} the Lakers.

However, the Detroit Pistons, under coach Larry Brown, upset the Lakers in 5 games. Chauncey Billups was named the Finals MVP. Now established as one of the premier powerhouses of the East, the Pistons would return to the NBA Finals in the following year, bowing out to the Spurs in seven games.|$|E

5|$|McMillin's {{success in}} Louisiana {{allowed him to}} move on to Geneva College in Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania, where he was the school's 13th head {{football}} coach for three seasons (1925–1927). His coaching record at Geneva was 22 wins, 6 losses and 1 tie, and {{he is a member of}} the Beaver County Sports Hall of Fame. Geneva College fans generally consider McMillin among the best coaches in school history. His teams, renowned for playing some of the <b>best</b> <b>teams</b> in college football, prided themselves on a challenging schedule. Geneva opened the 1926 season with a 16–7 upset of Harvard.|$|E
5|$|Meredith had to {{deal with}} {{extremely}} physical defences, and was often boxed into the corner of the pitch by as many as four players. As his talents became widely regarded, more well organised defences would designate him with a man-marker, to try and isolate him from his teammates. This often left him reliant on an unselfish inside-right partner willing to fetch and carry the ball for him without expecting much in terms of goals or glory in return. A hard-working wing-half would also improve Meredith's effectiveness by winning the ball and sending him a pass down the flank. The <b>best</b> <b>teams</b> he played in also had a centre-forward able {{to make the most of}} his accurate crosses.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the summer}} of 1936, the Canadiens re-hired Cecil Hart to be {{the coach of the}} team. Hart agreed to the job on one condition: that the Canadiens bring Morenz back to the team. On September 1, 1936, Morenz once again joined the Canadiens, his {{contract}} being purchased by the team from the Rangers. The Canadiens spent most of the 1936–37 season as one of the <b>best</b> <b>teams</b> in the NHL; Morenz contributed regularly, occasionally showing the speed that had made him notable at the start of his career. By mid-January, he had 4 goals and 20 points, far better totals than previous years.|$|E

5|$|The Bulldogs' next {{opponent}} was the Akron Pros, {{who were}} undefeated {{at the time}} and were gaining attention around the league. The game was the first of a two-game series between the Bulldogs and Pros, considered to be two of the <b>best</b> <b>teams</b> in the country. In the first quarter, after an exchange of punts, Pros tackle Charlie Copley kicked a 38-yard field goal. On a Bulldog possession at midfield, a Gilroy pass was tipped by the Pros' Copley and Bob Nash. Pros tackle Pike Johnson caught the ball before it landed and ran 55 yards for a touchdown. In the third quarter, Jim Thorpe came into the game but could not get the Bulldogs back into the game.|$|E
5|$|The {{first stage}} of the Paralympic {{competition}} was the group stage, a round-robin tournament. The Gliders faced a formidable task just to make the finals, as their pool included Brazil, Great Britain, Canada and the Netherlands. Canada had beaten the Gliders in 2010, and the Netherlands was rated {{as one of the}} competition's <b>best</b> <b>teams.</b> After a narrow victory over Brazil, and an easier one against Great Britain, the Gliders were again defeated by Canada, but won their final match against the Netherlands to finish {{at the top of their}} pool. The Gliders went on to win the quarterfinal against Mexico and the semifinal against the United States, but lost to Germany in the final, winning silver.|$|E
5|$|With the new stadium, Barcelona {{participated in}} the inaugural version of the Pyrenees Cup, which, at the time, {{consisted}} of the <b>best</b> <b>teams</b> of Languedoc, MIDI and Aquitaine (Southern France), the Basque Country and Catalonia; all were {{former members of the}} Marca Hispanica region. The contest was generally considered the most prestigious in that era. From the inaugural year in 1910 to 1913, Barcelona won the competition four consecutive times. Carles Comamala played {{an integral part of the}} four-time champion, managing the side along with Amechazurra and Jack Greenwell. The latter became the club's first full-time coach in 1917. The last edition was held in 1914 in the city of Barcelona, which local rivals Espanyol won.|$|E

5|$|By {{the early}} 1980s, Real Madrid {{had lost its}} grasp on the Liga title until a new cohort of {{home-grown}} stars brought domestic success back to the club. Spanish sport journalist Julio César Iglesias gave to this generation the name La Quinta del Buitre ("Vulture's Cohort"), which {{was derived from the}} nickname given to one of its members, Emilio Butragueño. The other four members were Manuel Sanchís, Martín Vázquez, Míchel and Miguel Pardeza; all five footballers were graduates of Real Madrid's youth academy. With La Quinta del Buitre (reduced to four members when Pardeza left for Zaragoza in 1986) and notable players like goalkeeper Francisco Buyo, right-back Miguel Porlán Chendo and Mexican striker Hugo Sánchez, Real Madrid had one of the <b>best</b> <b>teams</b> in Spain and Europe {{during the second half of}} the 1980s, winning two UEFA Cups, five Spanish championships in a row, one Spanish cup and three Spanish Super Cups. In the early 1990s, La Quinta del Buitre split up after Martín Vázquez, Emilio Butragueño and Míchel left the club.|$|E
5|$|In the {{beginning}} of the 1980s, Benfica's domestic dominance had dwindled, leaving the team to play in second-level competitions, like the Cup Winners' Cup or UEFA Cup. In 1980–81, the team reached the Cup Winners' Cup semi-finals, but lost to Carl Zeiss Jena from East Germany. This performance was bested two seasons later, as Benfica reached the 1983 UEFA Cup Final, after overcoming a quarter-final bout against a Roma side featuring Falcão and Bruno Conti. In the two-legged final, Benfica faced Belgium's Anderlecht. In the first leg, on 4 May 1983, Benfica lost in Brussels with a sole goal from Kenneth Brylle. In the second leg, fourteen days later, Benfica's manager Sven-Göran Eriksson chose not to start Zoran Filipović and João Alves, both undisputed starters, and the team drew 1–1 and lost another European final. Benfica returned to the European Cup in the following two seasons, but defeats against Liverpool in both participations showed that the team was not yet ready to compete with Europe's <b>best</b> <b>teams.</b>|$|E
5|$|Leeman Bennett, {{the former}} {{head coach of the}} Atlanta Falcons and Tampa Bay Buccaneers, served as {{chairman}} of the selection committee, which had the task of picking the <b>best</b> <b>teams</b> from those made available by the selection criteria set by the two conferences. The committee would have approximately onemonth to select the twoteams that would attract the most people to the game and generate the largest possible television audience. This fact helped eliminate ACC runner-up Georgia Tech from the selection process, as the Yellow Jackets had already played Georgia earlier in the season, thus making a potential Georgia-Georgia Tech showdown less attractive. In addition, that matchup, while attractive to football fans in the Atlanta area (the site of the Chick-fil-A Bowl and home to Georgia Tech), would have less appeal to television viewers outside the Georgia area. Supervising the selection committee was the Chick-fil-A Bowl Executive Committee, which consisted of representatives from various Atlanta businesses and the Chick-fil-A corporation.|$|E
