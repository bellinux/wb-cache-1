Moreover, marked variation in potency and/or affinity of current ligands between human and rodent orthologs of GPR 35 has limited their productive use in rodent models of physiology. Based on the reported modest potency of the antiasthma and antiallergic ligands cromolyn disodium and nedocromil sodium, we identified the related compounds lodoxamide and <b>bufrolin</b> as high potency agonists of human GPR 35. Unlike previously identified high potency agonists that are highly selective for human GPR 35, both lodoxamide and <b>bufrolin</b> displayed equivalent potency at rat GPR 35. Further synthetic antiallergic ligands, either sharing features of the standard surrogate agonist zaprinast, or with lodoxamide and <b>bufrolin,</b> were also shown to display agonism at either human or rat GPR 35. Because both lodoxamide and <b>bufrolin</b> are symmetric di-acids, their potential mode of binding was explored via mutagenesis based on swapping between the rat and human ortholog nonconserved arginine residues within proximity of a key conserved arginine at position 3. 36. Computational modeling and ligand docking predicted the contributions of different arginine residues, other than at 3. 36, in human GPR 35 for these two ligands and were consistent with selective loss of potency of either <b>bufrolin</b> or lodoxamide at distinct arginine mutants. The computational models also suggested that <b>bufrolin</b> and lodoxamide would display reduced potency at a low-frequency human GPR 35 single nucleotide polymorphism. This prediction was confirmed experimentally...|$|E

40|$|G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are seven-pass {{integral}} membrane {{proteins that}} act as transducers of extracellular signals across the lipid bilayer. Their location and involvement in basic and pathological physiological processes has secured their role as key targets for pharmaceutical intervention. GPCRs are targeted {{by many of the}} best-selling drugs on the market and there are a substantial number of GPCRs that are yet to be characterised; these could offer interest for therapeutic targeting. GPR 35 is one such receptor that, as a result of gene knockout and genome wide association studies, has attracted interest through its association with cardiovascular and gastrointestinal disease. Elucidation of the basic physiological function of GPR 35 has, however, been difficult due a paucity of potent and selective ligands in addition to a lack of consensus on the endogenous ligand. Herein, a focussed drug discovery effort was carried out to identify agonists of GPR 35. Various in vitro cellular assays were employed in conjunction with N- or C-terminally manipulated forms of the receptor to investigate GPR 35 ’s signalling profile and to provide an assay format suitable for the characterisation of newly identified ligands. Although GPR 35 associates with both Gαi/o and Gα 13 families of small heterotrimeric G proteins, the G protein-independent β-arrestin- 2 recruitment format was found to be the most suited to drug screening efforts. Small molecule compound screening, carried out in conjunction with the Medical Research Council Technology, identified compound 1 as the most potent ligand of human GPR 35 reported at that time. However, the lower efficacy and potency of compound 1 at the rodent species orthologues of GPR 35 prevented its use in in vivo studies. A subsequent effort, carried out with Novartis, focused on mast cell stabilisers as putative agonists of GPR 35, revealed lodoxamide and <b>bufrolin</b> as highly potent agonists that activated human and rat GPR 35 with equal potency. This finding offered–for the first time–the opportunity to employ the same GPR 35 ligand between species at a similar concentration, an important factor to consider when translating rodent in vivo functional studies to those in man. Additionally, using molecular modelling and site directed mutagenesis studies, these newly identified compounds were used to aid characterisation of the ligand binding pockets of human and rat GPR 35 to reveal the molecular basis of species selectivity at this receptor. In summary, this research effort presents GPR 35 tool compounds that can now be used to dissect the basic biology of GPR 35 and investigate its contribution to disease...|$|E
