5|$|Early {{on in the}} force's history, most of its {{equipment}} and weapons had to <b>be</b> <b>imported</b> from abroad, {{due to the lack}} of indigenous Canadian industry. Its early saddlery and wagons were imported from the United States, although the police's uniforms were made locally. After 1887, political pressure grew to use Canadian suppliers whenever possible. Supplies of food and similar goods were initially bought from the major trading companies in the west, such as the Hudson's Bay Company, but this gradually changed once more of the territories were settled and goods could be purchased from smaller, local firms, with the police becoming an important source of business. Equipment and supplies had to be bought from companies that supported the government of the day, and after 1896 a formal list of politically approved suppliers was kept by the comptroller's office. All of the police's guns had to <b>be</b> <b>imported,</b> {{due to the lack of}} indigenous manufacturers, and by 1890s the force was still buying most of its ammunition from abroad, as Canadian-manufactured cartridges remained substandard.|$|E
5|$|In Japan, the two battleships of the 1903-4 Programme {{were the}} first to be laid down as all-big-gun designs, with eight 12-inch guns. However, the design had armor which was {{considered}} too thin, demanding a substantial redesign. The financial pressures of the Russo-Japanese War and the short supply of 12-inch guns which had to <b>be</b> <b>imported</b> from Britain meant these ships were completed with a mixed 10- and 12-inch armament. The 1903-4 design also retained traditional triple-expansion steam engines.|$|E
5|$|Karnataka's pre-history {{goes back}} to a paleolithic hand-axe culture {{evidenced}} by discoveries of, among other things, hand axes and cleavers in the region. Evidence of neolithic and megalithic cultures have also {{been found in the}} state. Gold discovered in Harappa was found to <b>be</b> <b>imported</b> from mines in Karnataka, prompting scholars to hypothesise about contacts between ancient Karnataka and the Indus Valley Civilisation ca. 3300 BCE.|$|E
50|$|There are no pigs in the Faroe Islands, but pork {{is quite}} popular, so it <b>is</b> <b>imported,</b> mostly from Denmark. Some farmers have cattle, {{but it is}} mainly dairy cattle. Veal <b>is</b> <b>imported.</b> Chicken and turkey <b>are</b> also <b>imported.</b> Most food in the {{supermarket}} <b>is</b> <b>imported</b> from other countries. Milk and yoghurt are produced in the Faroes and sold in the supermarkets, but cheese <b>is</b> <b>imported.</b> Fruit and vegetables <b>are</b> <b>imported</b> from various countries. Sometimes one can buy Faroese-grown potatoes and rutabaga in the super markets. Eggs <b>are</b> <b>imported</b> from Denmark and Sweden. The Faroe Islands imported {{more than a half}} billion (526,603,000) DKK in 2011 of foods, beverages and tobacco.|$|R

5|$|Brin had {{originally}} {{wanted to build}} three ships, but their great cost forced him to settle for two. At the time, Italy's industrial capacity was insufficient to build the ships out of domestic material. Everything from the iron used to build the hulls to the ships' machinery and guns had to <b>be</b> <b>imported.</b> The Caio Duilio class {{formed the basis for}} the following two ironclad designs, the , also designed by Brin and laid down in 1876, and the , designed by Giuseppe Micheli and laid down in 188182.|$|E
5|$|Bronze mirrors {{arrived to}} Japan from China {{as early as}} the Yayoi period and {{continued}} to <b>be</b> <b>imported</b> through the Tang Dynasty (618–907). During that period mirrors cast in Japan were imitations of Chinese prototypes and subsequently Japanese designs were established. All of these mirrors were generally circular, with a polished front, and a back decorated with molded or engraved reliefs, sometimes inlaid with gold or silver. Three mirrors or sets of mirrors decorated with floral and animal motifs have been designated as National Treasures.|$|E
5|$|Bumblebees are Northern Hemisphere animals. When {{red clover}} was {{introduced}} as a crop to New Zealand {{in the nineteenth}} century, it {{was found to have}} no local pollinators, and clover seed had accordingly to <b>be</b> <b>imported</b> each year. Four species of bumblebee from the United Kingdom were therefore imported as pollinators. In 1885 and 1886 the Canterbury Acclimatization Society brought in 442 queens, of which 93 survived and quickly multiplied. As planned, red clover was soon being produced from locally-grown seed. Bumblebees are also reared commercially to pollinate tomatoes grown in greenhouses. The New Zealand population of buff-tailed bumblebees naturally colonised Tasmania, 1,500 miles away, in 1992.|$|E
50|$|In {{the colonial}} period, hounds <b>were</b> <b>imported</b> into the United States for the popular sport of fox hunting. Various breeds of foxhounds and other hunting hounds <b>were</b> <b>imported</b> from England, Ireland, and France.|$|R

50|$|Most of the O type {{carriages}} {{were built}} at either Newport or Islington workshops, to pre-agreed designs. The initial sleeping cars <b>were</b> <b>imported</b> complete, {{and the final}} pair <b>were</b> <b>imported</b> as kits and constructed locally.|$|R
5|$|In 1609, the Spanish Manila galleon San Francisco {{encountered}} {{bad weather}} {{on its way}} from Manila to Acapulco, and was wrecked on the Japanese coast in Chiba, near Tokyo. The sailors were rescued and welcomed, and the ship's captain, Rodrigo de Vivero, former interim governor of the Philippines, met with the retired shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu. Rodrigo de Vivero drafted a treaty, signed on 29 November 1609, whereby the Spaniards could establish a factory in eastern Japan, mining specialists would <b>be</b> <b>imported</b> from New Spain, Spanish ships {{would be allowed to}} visit Japan in case of necessity, and a Japanese embassy would be sent to the Spanish court.|$|E
5|$|In 1946, the {{historian}} Boris Rybakov, while analysing miniatures of ancient Russian chronicles, {{pointed out that}} most of them, from the thirteenth century onward, display churches with onion domes rather than helmet domes. Nikolay Voronin, the foremost authority on pre-Mongol Russian architecture, seconded his opinion that onion domes existed in Russia {{as early as the}} thirteenth century, although they presumably could not be widespread. These findings demonstrated that Russian onion domes could not <b>be</b> <b>imported</b> from the Orient, where onion domes did not replace spherical domes until the fifteenth century.|$|E
5|$|On 26 April 1990, GM's New Zealand {{subsidiary}} Holden New Zealand {{announced that}} {{production at the}} assembly plant based in Trentham would be phased out and vehicles would <b>be</b> <b>imported</b> duty-free—this came after the 1984 closure of the Petone assembly line due to low output volumes. During the 1990s, Holden, other Australian automakers and trade unions pressured the Australian Government to halt the lowering of car import tariffs. By 1997, {{the federal government had}} already cut tariffs to 22.5percent, from 57.5percent ten years earlier; by 2000, a plan was formulated to reduce the tariffs to 15percent. Holden was critical, saying that Australia's population was not large enough, and that the changes could tarnish the local industry.|$|E

5|$|The {{sheer size}} and {{complexity}} of the planetary ecosystem has proved problematic for the design of practical measures to reach global sustainability. To shed light on the big picture, explorer and sustainability campaigner Jason Lewis has drawn parallels to other, more tangible closed systems. For example, he likens human existence on Earth— isolated as the planet is in space, whereby people cannot be evacuated to relieve population pressure and resources cannot <b>be</b> <b>imported</b> to prevent accelerated depletion of resources— to life at sea on a small boat isolated by water. In both cases, he argues, exercising the precautionary principle is a key factor in survival.|$|E
5|$|There {{were some}} reversals. The {{attempts}} of English merchants {{to break through}} the Hanseatic league directly into the Baltic markets failed in the domestic political chaos of the Wars of the Roses in the 1460s and 1470s. The wine trade with Gascony fell by half during the war with France, and the eventual loss of the province brought an end to the English domination of the business and temporary disruption to Bristol's prosperity until wines began to <b>be</b> <b>imported</b> through the city a few years later. Indeed, the disruption to both the Baltic and the Gascon trade contributed to a sharp reduction in the consumption of furs and wine by the English gentry and nobility during the 15th century.|$|E

5|$|Upon the {{inception}} of the program in 1955, around 20,000 CIP licenses were granted, but it was determined that the progress was too unwieldy to manage, so the number of licenses was decreased and people were obliged to assemble into conglomerates to access the scheme. At first, inflation was regarded as such a pressing concern that there were very few limitations on what could <b>be</b> <b>imported,</b> the most notable restrictions being alcohol and jewellery. It was reasoned that more restrictions on imports would cause a lack of supply of goods, causing price increases. However, restrictions were increased in the next three years to an average of 75.|$|E
5|$|Beer {{was such}} an {{important}} consumable to Americans that they would closely watch the stocks of barley held by farmers to ensure quality beer production. In John Adams' correspondence with his wife Abigail, he asked {{about the quality of}} barley crops to ensure adequate supply for the production of beer for himself and their friends. However, hops, essential to production of beer, did not grow well in the colonies. It only grew wild in the New World, and needed to <b>be</b> <b>imported</b> from England and elsewhere. In addition to these alcohol-based products produced in America, merchants imported wine and brandy. Beer was not only consumed for its flavor and alcohol content, but because it was safer to drink than water, which often harbored disease-causing microorganisms. Even children drank small beer.|$|E
5|$|By the Second Dynasty at latest, ancient Egyptian {{trade with}} Byblos yielded a {{critical}} source of quality timber {{not found in}} Egypt. By the Fifth Dynasty, trade with Punt provided gold, aromatic resins, ebony, ivory, and wild animals such as monkeys and baboons. Egypt relied on trade with Anatolia for essential quantities of tin as well as supplementary supplies of copper, both metals being necessary for the manufacture of bronze. The ancient Egyptians prized the blue stone lapis lazuli, which had to <b>be</b> <b>imported</b> from far-away Afghanistan. Egypt's Mediterranean trade partners also included Greece and Crete, which provided, among other goods, supplies of olive oil. In exchange for its luxury imports and raw materials, Egypt mainly exported grain, gold, linen, and papyrus, {{in addition to other}} finished goods including glass and stone objects.|$|E

5|$|Flight Unlimited III is a {{three-dimensional}} (3D) flight simulator video game, {{in which the}} player pilots virtual reproductions of real-world planes. Players may control ten aircraft: the Lake Turbo Renegade, Stemme S10, Mooney Bravo, Fokker Dr.I, Beechjet 400A and five planes first included in Flight Unlimited II. Plane cockpits feature simulated flight instruments such as variometers and primary flight displays, and allow for both visual and instrument navigation. The main airspace is 10,000 square miles of Seattle terrain; eight other Western American states are modeled as well, albeit in less detail. The California scenery from Flight Unlimited II may <b>be</b> <b>imported</b> to expand the airspace. The player shares the game's skies with artificially intelligent (AI) planes. Real-time, interactive air traffic control monitors the player's actions and tries to prevent mid-air collisions. Before a flight, the player may select which types of weather to encounter. Weather conditions such as cold fronts and thunderstorms develop in real-time.|$|E
5|$|J. B. Haggin, an American breeder {{and owner}} of Elmendorf Farm, had begun to ship large contingents of horses to England for sale, {{including}} the 1908 Grand National steeplechase winner Rubio, and the fear was that if other American breeders followed his lead, the English racing market would be overwhelmed. As a first step, the English racing authorities began {{to limit the number}} of training licences at Newmarket Racecourse, turning away a number of American breeders. The General Stud Book rules for registration were also amended in 1909 to restrict registration to horses whose ancestry entirely traced to horses already registered in the General Stud Book, but horses registered in other national stud books were still allowed to <b>be</b> <b>imported</b> and registered.|$|E
5|$|Looms {{were not}} {{controlled}} by the guilds. Dependent on a migrant workforce, their commercial activity was driven by entrepreneurs, who were usually painters. The entrepreneur would locate and commission patrons, hold a stock of cartoons and provide raw materials such as wool, silk, and sometimes gold and silver – which often had to <b>be</b> <b>imported.</b> The entrepreneur was {{in direct contact with}} the patron, and they would often go through the nuances of the design at both the cartoon and final stages. This examination was often a difficult business and necessitated delicate management; in 1400 Isabeau of Bavaria rejected a completed set by Colart de Laon having earlier approved the designs, to de Laon's – and presumably his commissioner's – considerable embarrassment.|$|E
