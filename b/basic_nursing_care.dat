The research survey was conducted in Strakonice Hospital, plc, and Písek Hospital, plc, where a total of 130 questionnaires were distributed, 119 questionnaires were returned. The research sample contained 113 properly completed questionnaires, which was defined as 100 %. The objective of this thesis was to identify the knowledge and skills of <b>nurses</b> in the <b>care</b> for patients during blood transfusion administration. The other objective was to find out what new knowledge would the nurses apply in the care for patients during blood transfusion administration. To meet these objectives, three following hypotheses were set.

40|$|In the {{framework}} of health services research sponsored by the Swiss National Science Foundation, a research was undertaken of {{the activity of the}} large majority of the public health nurses working in the Swiss cantons of Vaud and Fribourg (total population 700, 000). During one week, 130 nurses gathered, with a specially devised instrument, data on 4165 patient visits. Studying the duration of the contacts, one has distinguished contact duration per se (DC), duration of the travel time preceding the contact (DD), and total duration in relation with the contact (DTC-addition of the first two). It was noted that the three durations increased significantly with patient age (as regard travel time, this is explained by the higher proportion of home visits in higher age groups, as compared with visits at a health center). Examined according to location of the visit, contact duration per se (without travel) is higher for visits at home and in nursing homes than for those taking place at a health center. Looked at in respect to the care given (technical care, or <b>basic</b> <b>nursing</b> <b>care,</b> or both simultaneously), our data show that the provision of <b>basic</b> <b>nursing</b> <b>care</b> (alone or with technical care) doubles contact duration (from 20 to 42 - 45 '). The analyses according to patient age shows that, at an advanced age (beyond 80 years particularly), there is an important increase of the visits where both types of care are given. However, contact duration per se shows a significant raise with age only for the group "technical care only"; it can be demonstrated that {{this is due to the}} fact that older patients require more complex technical acts (e. g., bladder care, as compared with simpler acts such as injection). A model of the relationships between patient age and contact duration is proposed: it is because of the increase in the proportions of home visits, of visits including <b>basic</b> <b>nursing</b> <b>care,</b> and of more complex technical acts that older persons require more of the working time of public health nurses...|$|E

The target for analysis is basic nursing training guidance of instructor myself. In <b>basic</b> <b>nursing</b> <b>care</b> training in clinical settings, situations in which guidance is thought to be necessary were reconstructed and used as research materials. From the research materials the characteristics of instructor awareness and expression were derived from the speech and behavior of the patientsand students focused on by the instructor 2 ̆ 7 s awareness and the instructor 2 ̆ 7 s expression. Furthermore, the characteristics of the guidance process were highlighted upon the derivation of the meaning of basic training guidance such as what sort of guidance the students were given in the chosen situations. In instructor awareness when guidance is deemed necessary in each situation, it became clear that there were common factors such as the perception of discrepancies in the instructor 2 ̆ 7 s and student 2 ̆ 7 s image of patients and their description of it. These discrepancies are listed as follows. 1. It is perceived that instructor consciousness is aimed at patients while student consciousness is aimed at themselves. 2. It is perceived that instructor is linking patient reality, awareness, and social aspects, the passage of time and environmental conditions while students perceive these patient aspects in a fragmentary manner. 3. It is perceived that instructor describes a target feature and perceive the meaning of a phenomenon while students perceive the meaning of a phenomenon in their own fashion. Whenever guidance is deemed necessary, the discrepancies are seen in instructor awareness from guidance process characteristics. These discrepancies, the learning stage and skill of the nursing process development will be generalized toelements of an instructor awareness structure. 本研究の目的は,基礎看護実習において,指導が必要と判断するときの指導者の認識を明らかにし,指導者の認識の構造についての示唆を得ることである。分析対象は,自己の基礎看護実習指導である。基礎看護実習において,指導が必要と思いかかわった場面を再構成し,研究素材とした。研究素材の中から指導者が注目した患者・学生の言動,指導者の認識,指導者の表現から,指導者の認識と表現の特徴を導き出した。さらに,選択された場面は学生にとってどのような指導をうけた場面であったといえるのか,基礎実習指導上の意味を導き出した上で,指導過程の特徴を導き出した。各場面において指導が必要と判断するとき,指導者は,学生との間に意識が向かう先と患者像と患者像の描き方のいずれかの不一致を認識しているという共通性が明らかになった。不一致の内容を以下に示す。 1. 指導者は,患者に意識を向け,学生は自分自身に意識が向いている,ととらえている 2. 指導者は,患者の実体面,認識面,社会面,時の流れ,環境条件をつなげており,学生は患者の部分を断片的にとらえている,ととらえている 3. 指導者は,対象特性を描いて現象の意味をとらえ,学生は自己流に現象の意味をとらえている,ととらえている 指導が必要と判断するとき,指導者には学生との不一致が認識されており,これら不一致が学生の学習段階と,看護過程展開の技術の修得状況とともに指導者の認識の構造を構成する要素に概念化されることが示唆された...|$|E
40|$|The {{topic of}} the Bachelor Thesis is ?Quantification method of basic and special nursing care at an anaesthetic/resuscitation department?. Resuscitation and {{intensive}} care provides treatment to patients threatened or affected by failure of basic life functions and ensures their inevitable support or temporary substitution. In most cases this is a reversible state. These patients fully depend on health care staff that provides complex nursing care. The <b>basic</b> <b>nursing</b> <b>care</b> requires general skills and specific ability to recognize urgent clinical situations and respond to them properly. According to the Maslow?s hierarchy of needs these are physiological needs and safety needs. Specialized nursing care ensures diagnostic, therapeutic and monitoring procedures. The extent of the nursing care depends on the patient?s clinical condition. The thesis consists of a theoretical part and a research part. The theoretical part deals with development {{of the field of}} anaesthesiology and resuscitation from the very beginning in antiquity to the present, its organizational structure and the nursing care provided at an anaesthesiology/resuscitation department. The ?Therapeutic Intervention Scoring System? (TISS) method was used in the research, which is connected with the ?Nursing Care Quantification Method? elaborated by PhDr. Karla Pochylá and Ing. Otakar Pochylý. The research examination was performed by qualitative and quantitative methods. Data collection method, namely observation, was used as the qualitative method. The research sample consisted of 7 respondents whose respiration insufficiency was the main reason for resuscitation care involving artificial lung ventilation. The activities of the <b>basic</b> <b>nursing</b> <b>care</b> (not related to TISS scores) and the activities of special nursing care (related to TISS scores) were determined by the quantitative method. Time measurements of these activities were performed, and average values and standard deviations were determined from them. The aim of the work was to determine the average time demand of <b>basic</b> <b>nursing</b> <b>care</b> as well as the average time demand of special nursing care. The research shows that the basic care not related to the TISS method has a large proportion in working hours and insufficient remuneration of nurses. The contribution of the obtained results for the practice is in updating of the average time demand of the basic and special nursing care in the conditions of the present nursing care at an anaesthetic/resuscitation department. The basic care has proven to be more time consuming than special care. However we should also mention that these results were obtained from a relatively small sample of patients, which is why such measurements should be performed on a larger group of patients to gain more precise results. As the measured values depend on patient?s current condition as well as on his/her additional health problems (obesity, renal insufficiency, bronchial asthma etc) determination of the average time demand of the individual procedures on model groups of patients would be appropriate. Inspiration by the system elaborated in neighbouring Germany would also contribute to improvement of basic and special care quality. It is able to respond flexibly both, to patient?s clinical condition and to the caring staff needs, thanks to continuous everyday analysis of nursing care time demand...|$|E

Any handover error can endanger patient safety. Despite the importance of shift handover, there is no standard handover protocol in our healthcare settings. Methods In this one-group pretest-posttest quasi-experimental study conducted in spring and summer of 2011, we recruited a convenience sample of 56 ICU nurses. The Nurses’ Safe Practice Evaluation Checklist was used for data collection. The Content Validity Index and the inter-rater correlation coefficient of the checklist was 0. 92 and 89, respectively. We employed the SPSS 11. 5 software and the Mc Nemar and paired-samples t test for data analysis.

RESULTS: Most nurses, in all specialties, regularly made clinical decisions on direct patient care, which included providing <b>basic</b> <b>nursing</b> <b>care</b> and psychological support, and teaching patients and/or family members. Although nurses in all specialties regularly managed the work environment, they did not make decisions on the ward or unit budget, supervise junior staff or mentor student nurses. Critical care nurses regularly made decisions on their extended roles, such as acting in emergency situations and deciding to change patient medication, while medical and surgical nurses only did this occasionally. Length of clinical experience is {{significantly related to the}} frequency of decision-making. CONCLUSION: The decisions nurses make are directly related to the clinical areas in which they work. However, {{it would be interesting to}} know if nurses showed particular aptitudes for different types and levels of decision-making and if this is related to other factors such as personality, education and experience in nursing...|$|E

This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract The increasing HIV and AIDS epidemic in South Africa poses a substantial burden to older people, in particular older women who mainly provide care for sick adult {{children and their}} grandchildren who have become orphaned and rendered vulnerable by the death or illness of their parents. In this study, 202 isiXhosa speaking older caregivers from Motherwell in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa were trained to provide care for grandchildren and adult children living with HIV or AIDS. Based on a community needs assessment, a health education intervention comprising four modules was designed to improve skills and knowledge which {{would be used to}} assist older people in their caregiving tasks. Some topics were HIV and AIDS knowledge, effective intergenerational communication, providing home-based <b>basic</b> <b>nursing</b> <b>care,</b> accessing social services and grants, and relaxation techniques. Structured one-on-one interviews measured differences between pre-intervention and post-intervention scores among those who attended all four modules vs. those that missed {{one or more of the}} sessions. The results demonstrated that older people who participated in all four workshops perceived themselves more able and i...|$|E
40|$|Many of the {{residents}} of nursing homes have mental health problems. These can be expected to affect the quantity of <b>nursing</b> <b>care</b> they require. Analysis of 285 nursing home residents, most of whom had moderate behavioral problems, reveals that their mental health characteristics can be summarized in terms of three factors: cognition, affect and aggressiveness. Cognitive deficits significantly increase the quantity of <b>basic</b> <b>nursing</b> services patients require. Negative affect increases the amount of psychosocial care received. The results of the analysis are interpreted as indicating that nursing home reimbursement systems should account for moderate as well as severe mental illness. nursing homes reimbursement patient classification long-term care...|$|R

40|$|The Bachelor Thesis {{provides}} {{a lot of}} information on the general anaesthesia, presents different aspects of the <b>nursing</b> <b>care</b> including the most frequent diagnoses, mentions the most common complications which patients after the general anaesthesia suffer from, and the extent of knowledge the nurses have on complications which occur during the recovery after the general anaesthesia. It is mainly the <b>basic</b> knowledge of <b>nurses</b> concerning the complications after GA which helps to make proper nursing diagnosis, set the aims and decide on interventions in the process of <b>nursing</b> <b>care</b> for the patient after GA. Results of the research work are useful for making the <b>nursing</b> <b>care</b> standard concerning the patient after GA. This standard can serve as a brief and well-arranged manual in the process of nursing and can provide the patient with comfort and security which are necessary aspects of the quality <b>nursing</b> <b>care</b> after the general anaesthesia...|$|R
