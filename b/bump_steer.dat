25|$|The XM, {{released}} in 1964, {{was the first}} Falcon with an Australian-designed body; the rear taillights were raised for Australian conditions and the front end received a full-wrap chrome grill and surrounds. The steering linkage was upgraded with 9/16-inch tie rods instead of the 1/2-inch tie rods found in the US models. The suspension was also improved with the upper control arms lowered to reduce the notorious <b>bump</b> <b>steer</b> found in the North American Falcon (and early Mustangs), on which this model was based.|$|E
25|$|Steering angles {{are also}} crucial {{as the driver}} progresses. The first stage of these {{modifications}} is usually a modified steering knuckle or upright. Extended control arms can be employed on MacPherson strut vehicles like the Nissan S-Chassis, as to allow for more clearance for higher steering angles. Companies like Wisefab, IRP (Individual Racing Parts), Voodoo13, and Parts Shop MAX have developed full lock kits including modification of the vehicle's original scrub radius, kingpin axis, Ackermann angle, amount of <b>bump</b> <b>steer,</b> caster angle, and kinematics as to maximize front grip and eliminate mechanical bind at steering angles in excess of 60°. While MacPherson strut vehicles are prevalent in profession drifting, Double wishbone suspension vehicles can also be competitive, with often better caster and camber curves.|$|E
2500|$|With the 1988 {{model year}} came a {{completely}} new front and rear suspension with vented disc brakes at all four corners- what Pontiac's engineers had planned for the car to have from the beginning. The front suspension geometry was changed to decrease the scrub radius thus decreasing steering effort without adding a bulky power steering system. The camber curve was also much improved, the dampers are moved inside the coil springs, and new sealed bearing/hub units were used in 1988. The rear suspension featured multi-link (two lateral links and one trailing arm) Chapman strut suspension, and the tie-rod related <b>bump</b> <b>steer</b> experienced with the earlier suspension design was fixed. The brakes were also upgraded to [...] vented rotors {{on the front and}} rear with an improved slide caliper design having larger diameter slides. The Fiero Formula (new for 1988) and Fiero GT models also received a rear anti-sway bar to compliment non-progressive rate springs.|$|E

40|$|In the racecar {{design process}} the {{definition}} of suspension type and geometry is an important stage. A good design of the main parameters, in terms of static and dynamic angles in <b>bump</b> and <b>steer,</b> {{is the basis of}} a successful racecar quite often. This paper aims at introducing {{the development of a new}} software tool, called MLKrace, that can analyse the suspensions kinematics for a wide range of different layouts. There are today a lot of commercial tools that analyse or simulate suspension behaviour. In general their application is restricted to the classic double wishbone suspension and in this case the calculation of the kinematics is not so difficult. This layout is used on both ends of the majority of formula and sports race cars but it isn’t the only possible one. The MLKrace software is instead more suitable to analyse innovative suspension geometries, the mathematics being based on the resolution of the so-called Stewart platform, a method originally devised for parallel robot kinematics. Therefore full multilink or hybrid systems can be designed as easily as a double wishbone. In addition push rod, pull rod or outboard spring systems can be added and the driveshaft required float is computed. Multilink-McPherson hybrid suspensions can be designed as well. The flexibility is the great advantage of this new software. Apart from the mathematic model, a massive effort was devoted to the design of the Windows interface with the aim of making the designer’s job particularly easy and effective compared to outdated MS-Dos interfaces of most of the existing software. The output is shown in the form of 2 D and 3 D animations, a large number of predefined diagrams, numeric tables and regression functions...|$|R

50|$|Rear {{suspension}} can {{be designed}} a number of ways. Many modern vehicles have rear suspension designs that are opposite of the front suspension: Toe in under bump, and out under droop. They can also be designed to have very little or no <b>bump</b> <b>steer</b> at all. Cars with rear live axles, also known as solid axles do not exhibit true <b>bump</b> <b>steer,</b> but can still cause some steering over one wheel bumps, see Difference between <b>bump</b> <b>steer</b> and roll steer. if both wheels on a live axle move upwards by the same amount, they tend not to steer.|$|E
50|$|The {{linearity}} of the <b>bump</b> <b>steer</b> {{curve is}} important and relies {{on the relationship of}} the control arms and tie rod pickup points, and the length of each part. As the suspension goes through bump and droop, each part follows an arc resulting in a change of effective length. Whichever parts are longest tend to have less change in effective length because their arc radius is longer. This is the determining factor in designed <b>bump</b> <b>steer.</b> Another factor that affects <b>bump</b> <b>steer</b> is bushing compliance and deflection and arm bending. During a turn, if {{some or all of the}} bushings deflect then their pickup points have changed If any of the arms and tie rods bend then their effective length will change resulting in a change of toe.|$|E

50|$|<b>Bump</b> <b>steer</b> {{causes a}} vehicle to turn itself when one wheel hits a bump or falls down into a hole or rut. Excessive <b>bump</b> <b>steer</b> {{increases}} tire wear and makes the vehicle more difficult to handle on rough roads. For example, if the front left wheel rolls over a bump it will compress the suspension on that corner and automatically rotate to the left (toe out), causing the car to turn itself left momentarily without any input from the steering wheel. Another example, is that when most vehicles become airborne their front wheels will noticeably toe in.|$|E
50|$|Steering {{kickback}} {{should not}} be confused with torque steering, <b>bump</b> <b>steer</b> or roll steer. These are similar outside influences that affect the direction of travel, but they do not cause a movement at the driver's wheel.|$|E
50|$|The Montecarlo/Scorpion {{suffered}} from several issues. Between the taller springs used {{to meet the}} US height requirements, a lack of caster, and <b>bump</b> <b>steer,</b> handling of US market Scorpions {{did not meet the}} promises of the car’s design.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bump</b> <b>steer</b> or roll steer is {{the term}} for the {{tendency}} of {{the wheel of a}} car to steer itself as it moves through the suspension stroke. It is typically measured in degrees of steer per metre of upwards motion or degrees per foot.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bump</b> <b>steer</b> {{can become}} a problem when cars are {{modified}} by lowering or lifting, when a spring has become worn or broken causing a lower ride height, or if the vehicle is heavily loaded. When a car is lowered or lifted, the wheels' toe setting will change.|$|E
5000|$|In a <b>bump</b> <b>steer,</b> both wheels rise together. In roll steer {{as the car}} leans {{during a}} curve, the inside {{suspension}} extends and the outside suspension compresses. Typically this produces [...] "toe in" [...] on one wheel, and [...] "toe out" [...] on the other, thus producing a steering effect.|$|E
50|$|Compared {{with its}} Z3 predecessor, the Z4 is larger {{and has a}} stiffer chassis. As per the Z3, the front {{suspension}} is a Macpherson strut design. The rear suspension uses a multi-link design, instead of the semi-trailing design used by the Z3. Some reviewers have criticised the ride quality for being too harsh, and observed excessive <b>bump</b> <b>steer</b> from the rear suspension.|$|E
5000|$|The {{choice of}} front-wheel drive is {{unusual for a}} sports car, but {{according}} to Lotus sales literature, [...] "for a given vehicle weight, power and tyre size, a front wheel drive car was always faster over a given section of road. There were definite advantages in traction and controllability, and drawbacks such as torque steer, <b>bump</b> <b>steer</b> and steering kickback were not insurmountable." [...] This was the only front-wheel-drive vehicle made by Lotus. Every model made since the M100 Elan, such as the Lotus Elise, has been rear-wheel drive.|$|E
5000|$|One of the {{features}} that added to the roominess of the E30 was the suspension. The front MacPherson struts and rear semi-trailing arm suspension were a compact arrangement that left a lot of cabin and boot space for the car's overall size. The semi-trailing arms {{have been criticized for}} the dynamic toe & camber changes inherent to the suspension geometry, causing <b>bump</b> <b>steer</b> in hard cornering situations (such as racing and autocross). This has contributed to the E30 as having a reputation for [...] "tail happy" [...] handling, where rear grip is reduced in certain situations, leading to oversteer.|$|E

5000|$|Another Frenchman {{invented the}} De Dion tube, which is {{sometimes}} called [...] "semi-independent". Like a true independent rear suspension, this employs two universal joints or their equivalent {{from the center of}} the differential to each wheel. But the wheels cannot entirely rise and fall independently of each other; they are tied by a yoke that goes around the differential, below and behind it. This method has had little use in the United States, though it does not evidence the <b>bump</b> <b>steer</b> that a more expensive, true independent suspension does. Its use around 1900 was probably due to the poor quality of tires, which wore out quickly. By removing a good deal of unsprung weight, as independent rear suspensions do, it made them last longer.|$|E
50|$|Steering angles {{are also}} crucial {{as the driver}} progresses. The first stage of these {{modifications}} is usually a modified steering knuckle or upright. Extended control arms can be employed on MacPherson strut vehicles like the Nissan S-Chassis, as to allow for more clearance for higher steering angles.

5000|$|When a car {{is lowered}} or lifted, it will {{will have to be}} re-aligned to avoid {{excessive}} tire wear. This is accomplished through adjustment of the steering tie rod length. After the tie rod lengths are changed, <b>bump</b> <b>steer</b> values will also change. In some cases, the car will have less toe change, this can make the car exhibit less roll understeer and therefore feel more [...] "twitchy" [...] during a turn. Other vehicles after lowering will exhibit an increase in toe change compared to stock, this results in the car feeling very [...] "twitchy" [...] on straight, bumpy roads, {{and at the same time}} feeling unwilling to turn requiring more driver input than normal due to an increase in roll understeer.|$|E
50|$|Cars with rear live axles, {{also known}} as solid axles, tend to not have true <b>bump</b> <b>steer.</b> Since both wheels are {{connected}} to a single, rigid member they are incapable of having any toe angles under normal conditions. Rear live axle suspensions are therefore designed to exhibit roll understeer. During a curve, the entire axle will turn slightly to face {{the inside of the}} curve so that the car does not turn more sharply than anticipated by the driver, roll understeer. It is possible to design a rear live axle suspension that exhibits roll oversteer but it is highly undesirable for on road use. Roll oversteer is sometimes incorporated on extreme off-road vehicles because it can allow the rear wheels to help turn the vehicle extremely sharply in tight trail conditions.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Bump</b> <b>steer</b> - {{the effect}} of {{irregularity}} of a road surface on the angle or motion of a car. It {{may be the result}} of the kinematic motion of the suspension rising or falling, causing toe-in or toe-out at the loaded wheel, ultimately affecting the yaw angle (heading) of the car. It may also be caused by defective or worn out suspension components. This will always happen under some conditions but depends on suspension, steering linkage, unsprung weight, angular inertia, differential type, frame rigidity, tires and tire pressures. If suspension travel is exhausted the wheel either bottoms or loses contact with the road. As with hard turning on flat roads, it is better if the wheel picks up by the spring reaching its neutral shape, rather than by suddenly contacting a limiting structure of the suspension.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bump</b> <b>steer</b> can be {{adjusted}} by moving any of the front suspension components pickup points Up, down, in or out. For example: Say the inner tie rod mounting point is moved up either by moving the rack or modifying the pitman arm mounting point or arm drop. The result is the tie rod's arc will change. It will then require {{a change in the}} tie rod length to be in proper alignment so the radius of the arc will change as well. If the radius arc of the tie rod is longer than stock on a front steer setup then the car will have more toe understeer. If the same scenario was applied to a rear steering design, then the car would exhibit less toe understeer. This is because the effective length of the tie rods is affected by its static length/arc radius, its pickup points and the angle of its arc during each phase of suspension travel in relation to the control arms.|$|E
50|$|Ackermann {{steering}} {{separates the}} steering movement into two pivots, one near {{the hub of}} each front wheel. The beam axle between them remains fixed relative to the chassis, linked by the suspension. Ackermann steering has the two advantages that it reduces tyre scrub, the need to drag tyres sideways across their tread when turning the steering, and also it reduced <b>bump</b> <b>steer,</b> suspension and road bumps tending to upset the steering direction. The kingpins were now fixed to the axle ends and the hub carriers pivoted upon them. Most commonly {{the centre of the}} kingpin was fixed in the axle and the hub carrier was forked to fit over this, but some vehicles, including the Ford Model T illustrated, used a forked axle and a kingpin fixed into a single piece carrier. Kingpins were always clamped in the centre and the swivel bearings at the ends, to increase the lever arm and so reduce the bearing load.|$|E

40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper {{would be on the}} design of {{steering}} system for a small formula race type vehicle. The design would consist of determining steering geometry with the use of tire models and optimizing the deign to have the best possible design. Ackermann Geometry, Anti Ackermann, parallel steer will be discussed and the ways to obtain the desired geometries will also be focussed on. The effect of steering on other parameters like roll centre will also be discussed. The importance of reducing <b>bump</b> <b>steer</b> and the methods of doing it will also be discussed...|$|E
40|$|To {{close the}} gap between the {{automotive}} industry and newly graduated engineers the graduates need to have a better understanding for how their design affects the end result. This thesis focuses on producing 3 D printed suspension scale models with correct kinematics to help students better understand how different types of suspensions behave. The suspension types chosen for the models are MacPherson and double wishbone for the front suspensions and trailing arm multi link suspension and a live axle for the rear. These models were designed in Catia V 5 and then 3 D printed in a scale of 1 : 5 and assembled together with some off-the-shelf components such as coilover dampers and ball joints. The models for the MacPherson and the trailing arm are based on Chalmers suspension setups while the live axle is based on modified values of the trailing arm. The double wishbone however is primarily based on given requirements and guidelines from the Chalmers suspension setup. The two front suspensions feature functioning steering and the MacPherson one also has a differential to illustrate the function of having a propulsion system. These suspensions are mounted on two vehicle chassis where the front suspensions can be swapped so all the combinations can be shown. The curves for camber gain and <b>bump</b> <b>steer</b> are plotted for the MacPherson and double wishbone suspensions. The 3 D printed models have similar kinematics to the original models. Because of the limited accuracy of 3 D printing there is some play in the suspension components reducing the similarity between the curves and the real behavior when manipulating the suspensions by hand...|$|E
40|$|Master's thesis in Structural engineeringThe University of Stavanger (UiS) is {{competing}} in a Formula Student competition at Silverstone in spring 2013 with a Formula Student racing car. This Master Thesis aims to design, analyze {{and test the}} steering system of the racing car. The car is built {{during the process of}} writing the thesis. A manual steering system was preferred as the weight of the car is low and {{to reduce the risk of}} spillage due to the hydraulic pump that would be necessary with a power-assisted steering system. With an electrical driven system, additional weight would be added with an extra or heavier battery. The car was designed for optimal performance in the skid-pad event with a reversed-Ackermann design. The Ackermann angle of the offset arm was set to 39. 3 degrees giving the outer wheel an angle of 13 degrees and the inner wheel an angle of 11 degrees in a turn with a radius of 7583 mm. The steering rack was placed in a far-front position to avoid big buildups of momentum during driving. The tie rods were angled at a same angle as the lower a-arm to reduce the <b>bump</b> <b>steer.</b> The biggest lateral force occurred during cornering and this was used for the design of the tie rods. During the analysis of the system, a bigger force occurred on the tie rod during braking, and the system was rechecked and approved for this force. MSC Adams was used in the design and analysis phase to consider the functionality and behavior of the steering system. Due to limitations in the budget, the team used the same Hoosier tires as last year. The 2014 team should pay to get access to the Milliken Research Associates, which is a tire test consortium, to obtain tire test data and make a decision if another brand of tire would fit the project better. The budget for the steering system should also be raised to be able to buy a lighter steering rack to lower the total weight of the steering system. The total weight of the 2013 steering system is 3957. 8 grams. The 2013 budget for the steering system was set to 5500 NOK. A new quick release mechanism had to be bought which raised the total amount for the system to 6228. 56 NOK. It should be possible to use the same quick release mechanism next year...|$|E
