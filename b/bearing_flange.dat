The Erskine Bridge {{played an important role in}} preserving year round links between the towns of Adelaide and Callington and its associated mines. The bridge is a utilitarian structure that remains largely in its original form, except for the replacement of timber decking by concrete. The bridge is typical of its type and demonstrates the simple use of stone piers and rivetted cast iron trusses. The bridge was named after Mr West-Erskine MP. The current bridge was opened in 1890 and comprises sandstone piers topped with iron trusses. The piers are ashlar faced with some tooling to quoins at the abutments. The road deck was originally timber, spanning across the two rivetted wrought iron trusses. The timber deck was replaced in 1943 with a concrete deck; further extensive repairs were carried out in 1979 to replace expansion <b>bearings,</b> <b>flange</b> plates and to provide corrosion protection to the bridge superstructure. The Erskine Bridge is relatively short and narrow and is supported by a central pier. The abutments and pier are rusticated and the former are battered against the river face.

A block consists of a grooved wheel, known as a sheave (pronounced [...] "shiv"), steel side plates, spacers, shaft, <b>flange</b> <b>bearings,</b> mounting angles and clips, etc. Blocks are sized based on anticipated live loads, operating speeds, line type and other factors. Sheaves were traditionally fabricated of cast iron, but steel and nylon sheaves are now common.|$|R

The simulation shows that the bolt fracture is due to relaxation caused by bolt slewing <b>bearing</b> and a <b>flange</b> partial slip on.

The housing for such {{bearings}} can consist of a through-hole of uniform diameter, but the entry face of the housing (which may be either the outer or inner face) must be machined truly normal to the hole axis. However such flanges are very expensive to manufacture.A more cost effective arrangement of the bearing outer ring, with similar benefits, is a snap ring groove at either or {{both ends of the}} outside diameter. The snap ring assumes the function of a flange.|$|R

This connection would be useful with deep deck (thickness greater than 3 in.) composite slabs as well as with commonly used deck where floor-to-floor height needs to be minimized. Five girder specimens were loaded until yielding during the initial phase of the research. The analysis section consists of the yield line theory and finite element study that were used to develop a model to predict the collapse loads of the girder sections. These results from the model were then compared to the experimental loads. A design procedure utilizing the proposed model and future work recommendations are then presented...|$|R
500|$|Like Probactrosaurus, the {{scapular}} {{blade of}} Eolambia is nearly rectangular, with {{the sides of}} the blade being straight and meeting the end of the blade at an almost-right angle. The humerus is bowed towards the midline, and the deltopectoral crest on the humerus is prominently thickened. A knob is present on the outer surface of the joint with the radius on the humerus. Both the ulna and the radius are relatively straight bones. The top of the ulna bears three [...] "prongs", namely the olecranon process and two additional triangular flanges. Meanwhile, the radius bears a flattened inner surface at the top end, and a distinct platform on the inner surface at the bottom end, both for articulating with the ulna. The hand has five digits. Among the metacarpal bones of the hand, the second is curved, the third is straight, and the fourth is strongly curved. Like Iguanodon, Probactrosaurus, and other basal iguanodonts, the claw on the first digit is distinctively conical. The second and third claws are hoof-like, with the third claw <b>bearing</b> roughened <b>flanges</b> on its sides – a trait also shared with other iguanodonts.|$|R
40|$|EnThe {{skeleton}} of Ionoscopus petrarojae, an ionoscopiform fish (Halecomorphi) from the marine Albian of Pietraroja (Campania, southern Italy), is studied in details. The fish exhibits all the anatomical features {{that characterize the}} family Ionoscopidae, a maxillary sensory canal, a dermosphenotic fused to the skull roof and <b>bearing</b> an innerorbital <b>flange,</b> a dermopterotic longer than the parietal, pitted infraorbitals, onospondylous vertebrae, fossae on the lateral faces of the vertebrae, more than 15 supraneurals and amioid-like scales. Ionoscopus petrarojae differs from the well known Ionoscopus cyprinoides by numerous osteological characters. The erection of a new genus for I. cyprinoides is suggested. Comparisons are done between I. petrarojae and the ionoscopid species Oshunia brevis and Quetzalichthys perrilliatae. Comments are given on the systematic position of I. petrarojae within Ionoscopidae. I. petrarojae is the plesiomorphic member of the family. It still has a large dermosphenotic that covers the autosphenitic, as in Ophiopsidae. “Ionoscopus” cyprinoides, O. brevis and Q. perrilliatae share a new derived character. The dermosphenotic is reduced. The autosphenotic is no more hidden and becomes a visible part of the skull roof...|$|R
40|$|Cold-formed steel {{members have}} many {{advantages}} over hot-rolled steel members. However, they {{are susceptible to}} various buckling modes at stresses below the yield stress of the member because of their relatively high width-to-thickness ratio. Web crippling {{is a form of}} localized failure mode that can occur when the members are subjected to transverse high concentrated loadings and/or reactions. The four common loading conditions are the end-one-flange (EOF), interior-one-flange (IOF), end-two-flange (ETF) and interior-two-flange (ITF) loadings. Recently a test method has been proposed by AISI to obtain the web crippling capacities under these four loading conditions. Using this test method 42 tests were conducted in this research to investigate the web crippling behavior and strengths of unlipped channels with stocky webs under ETF and ITF cases. DuraGal sections having a nominal yield stress of 450 MPa were tested with different web slenderness and <b>bearing</b> lengths. The <b>flanges</b> of these channel sections were not fastened to the supports. In this research the suitability of the currently available design rules for unlipped channels subject to web crippling was investigated, and suitable modifications were proposed where necessary. In addition to this, a new design rule was proposed based on the direct strength method to predict the web crippling capacities of tested beams. This paper presents the details of this experimental study and the results. Full Tex...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Rail {{transportation}} plays a {{major role}} in the transportation sector of South Africa and many other countries of the world. Trains are locomotives and carriages that travel on rail tracks. The trains steer with the wheel flange against the inside vertical face of the rail head or crown. This steering action produces wear due to the friction between the two steel surfaces moving relative to one another. It is observed that wear at curves is severe due to the high lateral forces of the wheel <b>flange</b> <b>bearing</b> against the rail crown, with very undesirable economic consequences. This study investigated steel rail material degradation at play between the sliding and the rubbing surfaces of the wheel flange on track by characterising some worn rail samples from Mayfair, Johannesburg, South Africa, rail line, with the aim to gain a better understanding of their wear mechanism. Chemical composition analysis of steel rail sample was conducted. Hardness and tensile behaviour of steel rail were measured and calculated, respectively. Microstructure features of the worn rail samples were also examined, using the stereoscope, microscope, and the Scanning Electron Microscope. Topography and roughness test analyses were also conducted. It was discovered that the examined worn out rail, which was originally produced from high carbon steel with pearlites and ferrites microstructure, undergoes a micro-structural evolution to form martensitic structure over the years of usage and exposure to environmental conditions mostly at the surface of the rail, which tends to become brittle. Some welded particles were also found to be interlocked in between the surfaces of the rail, causing gradual degradation and breakdown of the rail. These were caused by pressure shock and impact forces between the movement of the rail and the wheel flange. Hardness tests carried out on the top surfaces of 429, 432 and 591 VHN readings of steel rail compared to that of the sub inner part of 359, 352 and 338 VHN readings of steel track, found the top-surface to be harder. The surface worn-out particles were found to be oxidised. Topography tests were conducted to consider the roughness rate of steel rail track.
