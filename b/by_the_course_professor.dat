5000|$|In 1879 {{he passed}} the Entrance Examination and took {{admission}} into the Metropolitan Institution (later Vidyasagar College) which was established by Pandit Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar. At that time the Metropolitan Institution had no science classes or laboratories and Ray attended lectures on physics and chemistry in the Presidency College as an external student. Here he was specially attracted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> chemistry <b>courses</b> of <b>professor</b> Alexander Pedler. While studying for his BA examination, he applied for and was awarded in 1882 {{one of the two}} Gilchrist Prize Scholarships after an all-India competitive examination. Without completing <b>the</b> <b>course</b> for his degree, Prafulla Chandra proceeded to Britain and enrolled in the BSc programme of Edinburgh University where he studied physics, chemistry and biology amongst other subjects. But Ray did not confine his studies to only natural sciences. He also developed a strong interest in history and read books like Rousselet's L'Inde des Rajas, Lanoye's L'Inde contemporaine, Revue dex deux moneds. He also read Fawcett's book on political economy and Essays on Indian Finance. After obtaining his BSc degree from Edinburgh University, Ray embarked on his doctoral thesis (DSc) in the same university and completed his doctorate in 1887. He was awarded the Hope Prize which allowed him to work on his research for a further period of one year after completion of his doctorate. His thesis title was [...] "Conjugated Sulphates of the Copper-magnesium Group: A Study of Isomorphous Mixtures and Molecular Combinations". While a student he was elected Vice-President of Edinburgh University Chemical Society in 1888.|$|R
30|$|Higher {{education}} is now taking its first {{steps into the}} unchartered territory of <b>the</b> possibilities opened <b>by</b> AI in teaching, learning, and higher education organization and governance. Implications and possibilities of these technological advances can already be seen. By way of example, recent advancements in non-invasive brain-computer interfaces and artificial intelligence are opening new possibilities to rethink {{the role of the}} teacher, or make steps towards the replacement of teachers with teacher-robots, virtual “teacherbots” (Bayne 2015; Botrel et al. 2015). Providing affordable solutions to use brain computer interface (BCI) devices capable to measure when a student is fully focused on the content and learning tasks (Chen et al. 2015; González et al. 2015) is already possible, and super-computers, such as IBM’s Watson, can provide an automated teacher presence for the entire duration of a <b>course.</b> <b>The</b> possibility to communicate and command computers through thought and wider applications of AI in teaching and learning represents the real technological revolution that will dramatically change the structure of higher education across the world. Personalized learning with a teacherbot, or ‘cloud-lecturer’, can be adopted for blended delivery courses or fully online courses. Teacherbots—computing solutions for the administrative part of teaching, dealing mainly with content delivery, basic and administrative feedback and supervision—are already presenting as a disruptive alternative to traditional teaching assistants. An example is offered <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>course</b> offered <b>by</b> <b>Professor</b> Ashok Goel on knowledge-based artificial intelligence (KBAI) in the online Master in Computer Sciences program, at Georgia Tech in the USA. The teaching assistant was so valued by students that one wanted to nominate her to the outstanding TA award. This TA managed to meet the highest expectations of students. The surprise at the end of <b>the</b> <b>course</b> was to find out that Jill Watson was not a real person, but a teacherbot, a virtual teaching assistant was based on the IBM’s Watson platform (Maderer 2016).|$|R

40|$|Within the {{paradigm}} of Sociocultural Theory, and using Activity Theory as a data-gathering and management tool, this microgenetic case study examined the processes - the growth, change, and development - engaged in by student-teachers {{in a foreign language}} education program as they worked together to complete an activity. The activity involved digital video recording and editing, mediators which were intended to facilitate the iterative review of and subsequent reflection and action upon the content of the video during its creation. By investigating the process of contextual interaction between learners and the mediational elements of their environment as the activity progressed, this study intended to further understanding of preservice teacher development in at least two important ways. The aims of this study were to discover a) tangible evidence of cognitive transformation (development in the form of regulation), as well as b) aspects of professionalization into a community of skilled second language teachers (as evidenced by activity). The present study took place in a graduate-level foreign language/TESOL education practicum course. The activity involved the making of a digital video to explain and exemplify a given second language instructional approach, as well as the rationale behind and methods of targeting a specific language skill. Using theoretical constructs previously shown to be effective in the pedagogy of teacher preparation, the creators of this task endeavored to design a socially- and artifact-mediated activity with the potential to broaden and deepen student-teachers 2 ̆ 7 pedagogical and professional knowledge. The student-teachers failed to engage in meaningful dialogical or critical reflection as they engaged in the task, and made no perceptible regulative movement. What ultimately was revealed {{in the case of the}} study participants was a disconnect between the intentions of the core-task designers and the outcomes effected by the student-teachers. The data gleaned from this close examination of student-teacher processes was revelatory in terms of the quantity and types of factors that appeared to significantly impact the outcomes of the project. These factors have the potential to inform the process of translating socio-cultural theory into pedagogical practice, and should be of interest to anyone involved in the development of student-teachers, including those who design or deliver preservice teacher curricula. Discussed are the possible explanations for the disconnect between the designers and administrators of the activity and the participants in the study. Also considered are the potentially serious implications for second language teacher education programs and their curricula in terms of the application of sociocultural constructs to learning tasks and environments. Recommendations include increased scaffolding <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>professor</b> through direct guidance, as well as by structuring tasks to facilitate students 2 ̆ 7 ability to collaborate and to perceive and resolve the conflicts, contradictions, and tensions that arise during the course of the activity. On a broader level, serious examinations of teacher education programs and curricula are also recommended to look for ways to better understand, align, and achieve the goals of teacher developers and those of their student-teachers...|$|E
40|$|Using Social Media to Create a Global Community of Sustainability- Engaged Students Programs {{that enable}} {{engineering}} students to study {{outside of the}} United States have been effectively integrated with engineering education (Trotz et al., 2009). These programs are exposing students to global concepts of sustainability (Hokanson et al., 2007) and helping them develop core competencies in engineering while simultaneously building higher cognitive levels in some skills and in attitudes and identity outcomes (Bielefeldt et al., 2010). However, not every student can travel outside of the country. Social networking sites, such as Twitter, have not only been embraced by students from younger generations, they are also being used to communicate science (Darling et al. 2013). This study seeks to answer the question: can social media {{be used to create}} a global community of students that are engaged in learning about sustainability? In 2013, the University of South Florida (USF) and the University of the Virgin Islands (UVI) launched “Reclaim” as a way to create a community that connects researchers around the world from different disciplines who are dedicated to the recovery of resources from waste. “Reclaim” utilizes a website (usf-reclaim. org) with a blog, a YouTube channel (youtube. com/usfreclaim),and a Twitter account (@USF_Reclaim) to create this global community and disseminate research findings and educational materials. In addition, a one-credit course is currently being offered to students from USF and UVI, designed to operate entirely through the use of the sesocial networking platforms. The overall purpose of the course is to inform students about the professional meaning of sustainability across different disciplines, and help them develop skillsets to become globally competent in science and engineering, with a particular focus on sustainable engineered, environmental, and social systems. Each week, one or two students produce a 10 - 15 minute video and select reading materials related to a topic selected <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>professor.</b> Case studies are used to explore interdisciplinary solutions to context-sensitive systems. The responsible students host a Twitter chat each week about the topic covered in the video, the readings, or the case study. The content and substance of conversations taking place during weekly Twitter discussions and the interaction between students in different geographic locations and from different disciplines is currently being measured. After the first four weeks, the Twitter chats have seen participate on from over 40 people from different disciplines (engineering, anthropology, education, philosophy, marine science, biochemistry, and microbiology) representing nine different universities in the United States, the U. S. Virgin Islands, Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Bolivia, and the United Kingdom. Analysis of YouTube analytics data and data from the Twitter chats suggests several findings: 1) participants from outside of the United States are viewing online material {{for a longer period of}} time on average than participants from the United States; 2) most students used Twitter infrequently before the course and none of them used it in this way; 3) while multiple conversational strands occur simultaneously in the Twitter discussions, participants maintain conversations for up to nine turns over a 15 minute time interval; 4) content analysis of tweets suggests that most tweets are structured as reasoned claims with some arguments framed as syllogisms; and 5) new conversational strands have emerged during Twitter chats as participants asked questions that either challenged a comment made by others in a tweet or requested clarification of points...|$|E
