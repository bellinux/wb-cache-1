5|$|After this, the alchemist Agathodaemon (around 300) {{spoke of}} a mineral that when mixed with natron {{produced}} a 'fiery poison'. He described this poison as 'disappearing in water', giving a clear solution. Emsley speculates that the 'fiery poison' was arsenic trioxide, the unidentified mineral having to have <b>been</b> <b>either</b> realgar or orpiment, due to {{the relation between the}} unidentified mineral and his other writings.|$|E
5|$|In the comitatus, {{there is}} {{consensus}} that vexillationes were c. 500 and legiones c. 1,000 strong. The greatest uncertainty concerns {{the size of}} the crack auxilia palatina infantry regiments, originally formed by Constantine. The evidence is contradictory, suggesting that these units could have <b>been</b> <b>either</b> c. 500 or c. 1,000 strong, or somewhere in between. If the higher figure were true, then there would be little to distinguish auxilia from legiones, which is the strongest argument in favour of c. 500.|$|E

5|$|Though {{relationships}} within the Abelisauridae are debated, Carnotaurus is consistently {{shown to be}} one of the most derived members of the family by cladistical analyses. Its nearest relative might have <b>been</b> <b>either</b> Aucasaurus or Majungasaurus; this ambiguity is largely due to the incompleteness of the Aucasaurus skull material. A recent review suggests that Carnotaurus was not closely related with either Aucasaurus or Majungasaurus, and instead proposed Ilokelesia as its sister taxon.|$|E

5|$|About 20 large (40–150m across) ejecta blocks {{have been}} identified, {{embedded}} in Ida's regolith. Ejecta blocks constitute the largest {{pieces of the}} regolith. Because ejecta blocks are expected to break down quickly by impact events, those present on the surface must have <b>been</b> <b>either</b> formed recently or uncovered by an impact event. Most of them are located within the craters Lascaux and Mammoth, {{but they may not}} have been produced there. This area attracts debris due to Ida's irregular gravitational field. Some blocks may have been ejected from the young crater Azzurra {{on the opposite side of}} the asteroid.|$|E

5000|$|We {{approach}} {{the proof of}} Theorem 2 by successively restricting the class of all formulas φ for which we need to prove [...] "&phi; <b>is</b> <b>either</b> refutable or satisfiable". At the beginning we need to prove this for all possible formulas φ in our language. However, suppose that for every formula φ there is some formula ψ taken from a more restricted class of formulas C, such that [...] "&psi; <b>is</b> <b>either</b> refutable or satisfiable" [...] → [...] "&phi; <b>is</b> <b>either</b> refutable or satisfiable". Then, once this claim (expressed in the previous sentence) is proved, it will suffice to prove [...] "&phi; <b>is</b> <b>either</b> refutable or satisfiable" [...] only for φ's belonging to the class C. Note also that if φ is provably equivalent to ψ (i.e., (φ≡ψ) is provable), then it is indeed the case that [...] "&psi; <b>is</b> <b>either</b> refutable or satisfiable" [...] → [...] "&phi; <b>is</b> <b>either</b> refutable or satisfiable" [...] (the soundness theorem is needed to show this).|$|R
5|$|As the 5th century progressed, {{many of the}} Empire's {{original}} borders had <b>been</b> <b>either</b> wholly or partially denuded {{of troops}} to support the central field army. In 395, the Western Roman Empire had several regional field armies in Italy, Illyricum, Gallia, Britannia and Africa, and about twelve border armies. By about 430, two more field armies were established in Hispania and Tingitania but the central government had lost control of Britannia as well as much of Gaul, Hispania, and Africa. In the same period, the Eastern Roman Empire had two palatine field armies (at Constantinople), three regional field armies (in the East, in Thrace, and in Illyricum) and fifteen frontier armies.|$|E
5|$|During the 2016–17 NHL season {{a number}} of Toronto Maple Leafs team records have <b>been</b> <b>either</b> tied or broken by Hyman. On February 6, 2017, Hyman scored his third short-handed goal of the season, surpassing the {{previous}} Maple Leafs record for number of short-handed goals scored by a rookie which had been held by Gus Mortson since 1946-47. At six games with an assist, Hyman also tied for the most consecutive games with an assist by a rookie with Dan Daoust, Bob Nevin, and Frank Nigro. On March 28, 2017, when playing the Florida Panthers, Hyman set the Toronto Maple Leafs record for most short handed goals in a single season by a rookie with four.|$|E

5|$|Henry {{was staying}} safely at Corfe Castle in Dorset {{with his mother}} when King John died. On his deathbed, John {{appointed}} a council of thirteen executors to help Henry reclaim the kingdom, and requested that his son be placed into the guardianship of William Marshal, {{one of the most}} famous knights in England. The loyalist leaders decided to crown Henry immediately to reinforce his claim to the throne. William knighted the boy, and Cardinal Guala Bicchieri, the papal legate to England, then oversaw his coronation at Gloucester Cathedral on 28 October. In the absence of the archbishops of Canterbury or York, he was anointed by the bishops of Worcester and Exeter, and crowned by Peter des Roches. The royal crown had <b>been</b> <b>either</b> lost or sold during the civil war, so instead the ceremony used a simple gold corolla belonging to Queen Isabella.|$|E

5|$|Most of the Scarborough-based {{news media}} have <b>been</b> <b>either</b> {{weekly or monthly}} publications. The {{earliest}} newspaper was the Scarborough News and Advertiser which was published weekly starting in September 1921. It lasted until the 1930s. Other short-lived papers and magazines included The Enterprise (1945–1966), Scarborough Mail (1946–1955) and The News (1952–1995) and 54east magazine (2005–2009). The only remaining English language local newspaper is the Scarborough Mirror, which started publication in 1962 and was later acquired by the Toronto Star's community news division, Metroland. A Scarborough edition of the Toronto-wide photography publication SNAP Scarborough was launched in 2009. Ming Pao Daily News is a Chinese language newspaper whose headquarters are in Scarborough. They started publication in 1993.|$|E

5|$|On 1 February, Jirgalang {{announced}} that the Shunzhi Emperor, {{who was about to}} turn thirteen, would now assume full imperial authority. The regency was thus officially abolished. Jirgalang then moved to the attack. In late February or early March 1651 he accused Dorgon of usurping imperial prerogatives: Dorgon was found guilty and all his posthumous honors were removed. Jirgalang continued to purge former members of Dorgon's clique and to bestow high ranks and nobility titles upon a growing number of followers in the Three Imperial Banners, so that by 1652 all of Dorgon's former supporters had <b>been</b> <b>either</b> killed or effectively removed from government.|$|E

5|$|Pembrokeshire and Cardiganshire are {{adjoining}} historical {{counties in}} SW Wales.

Further theories {{on the origin of}} the Pembroke variety suggest that they may have originated from central European herding breeds from the area around modern Germany.

5|$|Seattle {{was also}} the home base of {{impresario}} Alexander Pantages who, starting in 1902, opened a number of theaters in the city exhibiting vaudeville acts and silent movies. His activities soon expanded, and the thrifty Greek went on {{and became one of}} America's greatest theater and movie tycoons. Between Pantages and his rival John Considine, Seattle was for a while the western United States' vaudeville mecca. B. Marcus Priteca, the Scottish-born and Seattle-based architect, built several theaters for Pantages, including some in Seattle. The theaters he built for Pantages in Seattle have <b>been</b> <b>either</b> demolished or converted to other uses, but many other theaters survive in other cities of the U.S., often retaining the Pantages name; Seattle's surviving Paramount Theatre, on which he collaborated, was not a Pantages theater.|$|E
5|$|Shay {{was found}} dead in a Kansas City hotel room on December 1, 1927. He was found with a gunshot wound to the head. Police {{officials}} initially said that the manner of death could have <b>been</b> <b>either</b> suicide or murder. Shay stayed in his room on the day that he died. A porter went to check on him that evening and found him on the floor with a pistol a few inches from his right hand. When physicians examined Shay's body, they found that a bullet had entered the right ear and exited the back of the head. Shay had lost the use of his right arm and hand after a stroke. Police said that if Shay were holding the gun in his left hand, {{it would not have been}} easy for him to shoot himself in the right side of the head.|$|E
