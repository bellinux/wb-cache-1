5|$|Female taiko {{performance}} has {{also served as}} a response to gendered stereotypes of Japanese women as being quiet, subservient, or a femme fatale.

50|$|Beginning in the 1830s, a pidgin {{language}} {{began taking}} form between Norwegians and Russians, Russenorsk.

5|$|In {{addition}} to the speeches, there are fifty-six prologues (openings of speeches). They were collected for the Library of Alexandria by Callimachus, who believed them genuine. Modern scholars are divided: some reject them, while others, such as Blass, <b>believe</b> <b>they</b> are authentic. Finally, six letters also survive under Demosthenes's name and their authorship too is hotly debated.|$|E
5|$|In medicine, kitsunetsuki is a culture-bound {{syndrome}} {{unique to}} Japanese culture. Those {{who suffer from}} the condition <b>believe</b> <b>they</b> are possessed by a fox. Symptoms include cravings for rice or sweet adzuki beans, listlessness, restlessness, and aversion to eye contact. Kitsunetsuki is similar to but distinct from clinical lycanthropy.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, No. 7 Wing SAAF {{shot down}} another 16 Italian SM.82s. The {{ease with which}} they caught fire led the Allied pilots to <b>believe</b> <b>they</b> were carrying precious fuel cargoes. Among those units involved were No. 54 Squadron SAAF, No. 2 Squadron SAAF. Another source gives Axis losses as 10 destroyed and four crash landed.|$|E

5|$|Alexander Karelin {{was awarded}} for his {{recognition}} {{as the greatest}} wrestler of all time (from antiquity to the present day). He was a Greco-Roman wrestler in the Olympics, and in his career he won 887 bouts and lost only 2 times. His losses are controversial because commentators <b>believe</b> <b>they</b> were caused by trivial rule changes, not a bona fide athletic defeat.|$|E
5|$|Chess is a two-player {{board game}} {{utilizing}} a chessboard and sixteen pieces of six types for each player. Each type of piece moves in a distinct way. The {{goal of the}} game is to checkmate (threaten with unescapable capture) the opponent's king. Games do not necessarily end with checkmate; players often resign if they <b>believe</b> <b>they</b> will lose. A game can also end in a draw in several ways.|$|E
5|$|Enterprise {{heads to}} Andoria after Ambassador Soval informs {{them that the}} Vulcans <b>believe</b> <b>they</b> have been {{developing}} Xindi weapon technology. Soval guides Enterprise to a nebula where the Andorian fleet is hiding. Commander Shran is dubious, and abducts and tortures Soval. After believing him, Enterprise joins a fleet of six Andorian ships to intercept the Vulcans. Commander Tucker attempts to buy time by ordering Enterprise directly between the two fleets — this works for a while until Administrator V'Las orders them to be targeted too.|$|E

The group incorporates elements of African-American culture into their interpretation of the Bible. They do not recognize rabbinical Jewish interpretations such as the Talmud. The Black Hebrews observe Shabbat and biblically ordained Jewish holidays such as Yom Kippur and Passover.|$|E
5|$|The prisoners <b>believe</b> <b>they</b> {{have won}} the study, but the guards have tricked them into winning, {{allowing}} them to escape. Keith tells the police the story of Kendall and Cormac's deaths: Kendall gave Keith a valuable painting disguised as money in a case, and Cormac tried to kill Kendall and Keith to get the case's contents. Cormac killed Liam out of anger {{that there was no}} money. The episode concludes with Logan streaking through sociology class, fulfilling a bet made earlier in the episode.|$|E
5|$|The {{scattered}} {{nature of}} the airborne landings caused some confusion among the German high command. At the LXII Corps headquarters, several reports of the landings exaggerated their strength, causing the Germans to <b>believe</b> <b>they</b> were faced with a far greater force. Also, 600 dummy paratroops that had landed {{to the north and}} west of Toulon, as part of the Allied deception plan, convinced the Germans another landing had taken place there.|$|E

5|$|There {{have been}} at least 11 {{documented}} cases of blue whale-fin whale hybrid adults in the wild. Arnason and Gullberg describe the genetic distance between a blue and a fin as about the same as that between a human and a gorilla.

5|$|Amundsen's initial plans {{had focused}} on the Arctic and the conquest of the North Pole {{by means of an}} {{extended}} drift in an icebound ship. He obtained the use of Fridtjof Nansen's polar exploration ship Fram, and undertook extensive fundraising. Preparations for this expedition were disrupted when, in 1909, the rival American explorers Frederick Cook and Robert E. Peary each claimed to have reached the North Pole. Amundsen then changed his plan and began to prepare for a conquest of the South Pole; uncertain {{of the extent to which}} the public and his backers would support him, he kept this revised objective secret. When he set out in June1910, he led even his crew to <b>believe</b> <b>they</b> were embarking on an Arctic drift, and revealed their true Antarctic destination only when Fram was leaving their last port of call, Madeira.|$|E
5|$|Cookbooks, or more specifically, recipe collections, {{compiled}} in the Middle Ages {{are among}} the most important historical sources for medieval cuisine. The first cookbooks began to appear {{towards the end of the}} 13th century. The Liber de coquina, perhaps originating near Naples, and the Tractatus de modo preparandi have found a modern editor in Marianne Mulon, and a cookbook from Assisi found at Châlons-sur-Marne has been edited by Maguelonne Toussaint-Samat. Though it is assumed that they describe real dishes, food scholars do not <b>believe</b> <b>they</b> were used as cookbooks might be today, as a step-by-step guide through the cooking procedure that could be kept at hand while preparing a dish. Few in a kitchen, at those times, would have been able to read, and working texts have a low survival rate.|$|E

5|$|Kira learns of his origins from ZAFT {{commander}} Rau Le Creuset {{during these}} battles. Kira is the Ultimate Coordinator; his fetus was artificially developed outside his mother's womb and his genetic enhancements {{were intended to}} be superior to all other Coordinators. Kira was the only fetus to survive the process. He was born as the twin brother of his comrade Cagalli Yula Athha but does not learn about this relationship until {{the latter half of}} the series. Kira was adopted by his aunt Caridad and uncle Haruma Yamato and was led to <b>believe</b> <b>they</b> were his biological parents. Despite being shocked by his origins as the Ultimate Coordinator, Kira continues to fight alongside the Archangel until their opponents, including Rau, have been defeated and the war comes to end.|$|E
5|$|Large, heavy horses, {{weighing}} from , {{the ancestors}} of today's draught horses, were used, particularly in Europe, from the Middle Ages onward. They pulled heavy loads like supply wagons and were disposed to remain calm in battle. Some historians <b>believe</b> <b>they</b> may have carried the heaviest-armoured knights of the European Late Middle Ages, though others dispute this claim, indicating that the destrier, or knight's battle horse, was a medium-weight animal. It is also disputed whether the destrier class included draught animals or not. Breeds at the smaller end of the heavyweight category may have included {{the ancestors of}} the Percheron, agile for their size and physically able to manoeuvre in battle.|$|E
5|$|Locusts are {{eaten in}} the Arabian Peninsula, {{including}} Saudi Arabia, where consumption of locusts spiked around Ramadan {{especially in the}} Al-Qassim Region in 2014, since many Saudis <b>believe</b> <b>they</b> are healthy to eat; however, the Saudi Ministry of Health warned that pesticides they used against the locusts made them unsafe; and Kuwait. Yemenis also consume locusts, and expressed discontent over governmental plans to use pesticides to control them. ʻAbd al-Salâm Shabînî described a locust recipe from Morocco. 19th century European travellers observed Arabs in Arabia, Egypt, and Morocco selling, cooking, and eating locusts. They reported that in Egypt and Palestine locusts were consumed. They reported that in Palestine, around the River Jordan, in Egypt, in Arabia, and in Morocco that Arabs ate locusts, while Syrian peasants did not eat locusts.|$|E
