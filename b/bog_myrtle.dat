5|$|Heather moor {{containing}} ling, bell heather, cross-leaved heath, <b>bog</b> <b>myrtle</b> and fescues {{is everywhere}} abundant. The high Black Cuillins weather too slowly {{to produce a}} soil that sustains a rich plant life, but each of the main peninsulas has an individual flora. The basalt underpinnings of Trotternish produce a diversity of Arctic and alpine plants including alpine pearlwort and mossy cyphal. The low-lying fields of Waternish contain corn marigold and corn spurry. The sea cliffs of Duirinish boast mountain avens and fir clubmoss. Minginish produces fairy flax, cats-ear and black bog rush. There is {{a fine example of}} Brachypodium-rich ash woodland at Tokavaig in Sleat incorporating silver birch, hazel, bird cherry, and hawthorn.|$|E
25|$|Where {{the floods}} are less {{frequent}} the hardwoods themselves are absent, {{giving way to}} open country. The country is thus a prairie and, sometimes, this prairie finishes by transforming into bog. The vegetation of the prairies is characterized by calamagrostides blanch√¢tres, by purple moor grass, bogbean, yellow loosestrife, swamp cinquefoil, lesser spearwort, common marsh-bedstraw, kingcup, purple loosestrife and violettes, the last being an endangered species in the country. In the bogs, vegetation is poor, with mainly <b>bog</b> <b>myrtle,</b> bog-rosemary, common cottongrass and species of Carex. The soil is often covered in peat mosses and other mosses.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} 19th century Patrick Neill {{wrote of the}} local flora that [...] "Eda is a mossy island; {{a great part of}} it {{consisting}} of barren marshy heaths. Juncus uliginosus here covers whole acres; and the pretty little plant Radiola millegran, or all-seed, is everywhere strewed." [...] Over 120 species of wild plants have been recorded on the island including <b>bog</b> <b>myrtle</b> found nowhere else in Orkney.|$|E
500|$|The {{total number}} of {{vascular}} species is low by world standards, {{partly due to the}} effects of Pleistocene glaciations (which eliminated all or nearly all species) and the subsequent creation of the North Sea (which created a barrier to re-colonisation). Nonetheless, {{there are a variety of}} important species and assemblages. Heather moor containing Ling, Bell Heather, Cross-leaved Heath, <b>Bog</b> <b>Myrtle</b> and fescues is generally abundant and contains various smaller flowering species such as Cloudberry and Alpine Ladies-mantle. Cliffs and mountains host a diversity of [...] arctic and alpine plants including Alpine Pearlwort, Mossy Cyphal, Mountain Avens and Fir Clubmoss. On the Hebridean islands of the west coast, there are plantago pastures, which grow well in locations exposed to sea spray and include Red Fescue, Sea Plantain and Sea Pink. The machair landscapes include rare species such as Irish Lady's Tresses, Yellow Rattle and numerous orchids along with more common species such as Marram and Buttercup, Ragwort, Bird's-foot Trefoil and Ribwort Plantain. Scots Lovage, (Ligusticum scoticum) first recorded in 1684 by Robert Sibbald, and the Oyster Plant are common plants of the coasts.|$|E
2500|$|For {{around a}} {{thousand}} years in Finland, brewsters (female brewers) created a beer called Sahti in villages throughout the country. The recipe usually contained hops, juniper twigs, and barley and rye grains which had been malted and then smoked in a sauna. Finnish legends include the story of , a woman who invented beer by mixing bear's saliva with honey. Raugutiene, was a Baltic and Slavic goddess, who was the protector of beer. Alan D. Eames, a beer anthropologist, wrote an article in 1993 stating that the Norse Vikings, only allowed women to brew their ale. Archaeologists have uncovered graves of pre-Viking Nordic people which indicate that women {{were the ones who}} made and served alcohol. In the grave of the [...] "Egtved Girl", a bucket of grog buried at her feet showed that the drink was made from a mixture of wheat, rye and barley as a base and included cranberries, honey, and lingonberries, as well as herbs, like birch resin, <b>bog</b> <b>myrtle,</b> juniper, and yarrow, to spice the drink. Danish women were the primary brewers until the establishment of guilds in the Middle Ages. While guilds controlled production for the crown and military, as well as for those in cities, women continued to be the primary brewers in the countryside. Even within the guilds, while higher positions were occupied by men, many of their wives held lower positions; in addition, there is evidence to suggest {{that the majority of the}} brewing performed by these families was carried out by the wives.|$|E

50|$|The use of hops {{also has}} the advantage, in {{perception}} or fact, that beer made with hops lasts longer and resists spoilage better than that made with gruit.

50|$|Williams Bros started brewing in 1988. Their first ale was {{inspired}} by a 17th-century Gaelic recipe for leann fraoich (heather ale). The heather ale is made using <b>bog</b> <b>myrtle</b> and heather flowers, and was named Fraoch, after the legendary Gaelic hero Fr√°ech (or Fraoch). The ale was produced in a tiny brewery in Taynuilt railway station, which could make no more than five barrels per batch, just enough to supply five pubs across Scotland. As demand grew, the recipe was taken to the old Maclay's Brewery in the Scottish brewing town of Alloa.|$|E

50|$|Western {{blanket bog}} and {{heathland}} {{are the most}} common vegetation of Connemara National Park. The boglands are situated in the wet low lying environments whereas the blanket bog exists within the drier mountain atmosphere. Purple moorgrass is the most bountiful plant, creating colorful landscapes throughout the country side. Carnivorous plants {{play an important role in}} the park's ecosystem, the most common being sundew and butterworts trap. Bogs hold very little nutrients so many plants obtain their energy from the digestion of insects.
