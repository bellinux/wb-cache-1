5|$|Submarine {{films like}} Robert Wise's 1958 Run Silent, Run Deep {{constitute}} a distinctive subgenre {{of the war}} film, depicting the stress of submarine warfare. The genre makes distinctive use of the soundtrack, which attempts to <b>bring</b> <b>home</b> the emotional and dramatic nature of conflict under the sea. For example, in the 1981 Das Boot, the sound design works together with the hours-long film format to depict lengthy pursuit with depth charges and the many times repeated ping of sonar, {{as well as the}} threatening sounds of a destroyer's propellor and of an approaching torpedo.|$|E
5|$|The gharial is {{featured}} in the folk tales of India. In one story, a gharial and a monkey become friends when the monkey gives the gharial fruit. The gharial's wife demands that her husband <b>bring</b> <b>home</b> the monkey to eat, believing that the fruit made the monkey's heart sweet. The gharial complies at first and attempts to lure the monkey to his home, but soon comes clean about the plan. Their friendship ends after that. Similar stories exist in Native American legends, and in the African American folktale of an alligator and Br'er Rabbit.|$|E

5|$|Baron Hector Hulot is {{a living}} manifestation of male sexual desire, {{unrestrained}} and unconcerned with its consequences for the man or his family. As the novel progresses, he becomes consumed by his libido, even in a physical sense. When Valérie tells him to stop dyeing his hair, he does so to please her. His financial woes and public disgrace lead him to flee his own home; {{by the end of}} the book he is an elderly, decrepit shell of a man. Baron Hulot is so overcome by his taste for female flesh that he even asks his wife– without irony– if he can <b>bring</b> <b>home</b> his fifteen-year-old mistress.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} summer of 1855, Gray made his third trip to Europe. This was an {{emergency}} trip to <b>bring</b> <b>home</b> his ill brother-in-law from Paris. Gray spent only three weeks in London and Paris, {{and on the way}} back he read the newly published Géographie botanique raisonnée by Alphonse deCandolle. This was a ground-breaking book {{that for the first time}} brought together the large mass of data being collected by the expeditions of the time. The natural sciences had become highly specialized, yet this book synthesized them to explain living organisms within their environment and why plants were distributed the way they were, all upon a geologic scale. Gray instantly saw that this brought taxonomic botany into focus.|$|E
5|$|Robben {{first came}} to {{prominence}} with Groningen, for whom he was {{player of the year}} for the 2000–01 Eredivisie season. Two years later he signed for PSV, where he became the Netherlands' Young Player of the Year and won an Eredivisie title. The following season Robben's signature was pursued by leading English clubs, and after protracted transfer negotiations he joined Chelsea in 2004. Robben's Chelsea debut was delayed through injury, but upon returning to fitness he helped Chelsea <b>bring</b> <b>home</b> two consecutive Premier League titles, and was the FA Premier League Player of the Month in November 2005. After a third season in England which was punctuated by injury, Robben moved to Spanish club Real Madrid for €35million.|$|E

5|$|Submarine {{films have}} their own {{particular}} meanings and conventions, concerned specifically with giving the effect of submarine warfare. A distinctive element in this subgenre is the soundtrack, which attempts to <b>bring</b> <b>home</b> the emotional and dramatic nature of conflict under the sea. For example, in Wolfgang Petersen's 1981 Das Boot, the sound design works together with the hours-long film format to depict lengthy pursuit with depth charges, the ping of sonar, and threatening sounds such as of the propellors of enemy destroyers and torpedoes. Classic films in the genre include The Enemy Below (1957) and Run Silent, Run Deep (1958), both based on novels by naval commanders. Run Silent, Run Deep is a movie full of tension, both with the enemy and between the contrasting personalities of the submarine Commander and his Lieutenant, played by Clark Gable and Burt Lancaster.|$|E
5|$|Veronica {{realizes that}} Logan's letter was never found, and {{searches}} Lilly's room during {{a dinner party}} at the Kane's household. Duncan enters the room and they discover several videotapes which show Lilly {{having an affair with}} Logan's father, Aaron Echolls (Harry Hamlin). Veronica believes that Lilly found the tapes and refused to return them, which angered Aaron and he killed her; Duncan arrived home to find Lilly dead and had an epileptic fit, at which time Jake and Celeste returned home. While an unseen person watches them from a closet, Veronica calls Keith and tells him that she will <b>bring</b> <b>home</b> the tapes, noting that Aaron is at the party. Before she leaves, Veronica tells Duncan that they are not related. Meanwhile, Logan is drunk and stands on a bridge railing. Weevil and the PCHers arrive and they initiate a fight.|$|E
5|$|With a 24-match unbeaten run in Serie A, Roma {{became the}} only challengers to Inter {{in the last three}} rounds for the league title that season, {{ultimately}} finishing runners-up after the final game. Despite suffering several injury problems, he surpassed former prolific strikers such as Gabriel Batistuta, Giuseppe Signori, and Kurt Hamrin, putting him in sixth place in the all-time Serie A scoring records. Totti also played in the Coppa Italia final against Inter on 5 May 2010, but received a red card in the closing minutes of the second half for kicking Mario Balotelli; Roma lost the match 0–1, thus failing to <b>bring</b> <b>home</b> a record tenth Coppa Italia title.|$|E

5|$|Chicago White Sox manager Al López {{watched the}} game {{along with his}} {{pitching}} coach to scout their potential NL opponents for the World Series. The start of Game 1 was delayed 45 minutes due to rain, leaving only 18,297 fans in the stadium once the game was underway. The Dodgers opened the game quickly as Charlie Neal singled with one out, advanced to second base on a ground out, and scored on a single by Norm Larker to give the Dodgers an early 1–0 lead. Dodgers starter Danny McDevitt held the Braves scoreless in the first inning, but was driven from {{the game in the}} second. After a line out to open the inning Johnny Logan walked, Del Crandall singled, and Bill Bruton singled to <b>bring</b> <b>home</b> Logan and tie the game at 1. Larry Sherry entered in relief of McDevitt, who pitched just 1 innings. Carl Willey, the Braves' pitcher, reached base on an error to load the bases. Crandall then scored on a ground out by Bobby Ávila to give the Braves a 2–1 lead before Sherry finished out the second.|$|E
5|$|Ending {{his playing}} career, Bauer became coach, {{general manager and}} {{president}} of the Dutchmen in 1952. He coached the team to two OHA senior championships and Allan Cup victories: 1952–53 and 1954–55. As the top senior team in the nation, the Dutchmen were sent to Italy to represent Canada at the 1956 Winter Olympics. Bauer was pleased with the way his team adapted to European rules and the Dutchmen were expected to <b>bring</b> <b>home</b> the gold medal. However, the team was shocked by the American entry, a 4–1 loss. Though they still had a chance at gold due to the round robin format of the tournament, the Dutchmen were defeated by the Soviet Union – at the time a relatively unknown and emerging hockey power – by a 2–0 score despite outshooting the Soviets 23–9. Canada was relegated to the bronze medal, at the time the worst finish in the nation's Olympic hockey history.|$|E

5|$|The first {{nationalist}} tensions {{arise in}} the 19th century, with {{the outbreak of the}} First Serbian Uprising in present-day central Serbia. The Turks construct a blockhouse on the bridge, decorating it with stakes on which they pin the heads of suspected rebels. One evening, the blockhouse burns down. In the ensuing decades, as the Ottoman Empire continues to decline, Bosnia is ravaged by plague. After the Congress of Berlin in 1878, Serbia and Montenegro become fully independent countries. Austria-Hungary receives a right to occupy Bosnia-Herzegovina and turns it into a protectorate. The occupation comes as a shock to the residents of the town, which has remained largely unchanged since the time of the bridge's completion, and the local people experience difficulties accepting the numerous changes and reforms that accompany Austro-Hungarian rule. A barrack is built {{at the site of the}} caravanserai and the town experiences a substantial influx of foreigners. People from all parts of Austria-Hungary arrive, opening new businesses and bringing the customs of their native regions with them. A narrow gauge railway line is built to Sarajevo and the bridge loses much of its strategic importance. Local children begin to be educated in Sarajevo, and some go on to continue their studies in Vienna. They <b>bring</b> <b>home</b> new social and cultural ideas from abroad, among them the concepts of trade unions and socialism, while newly established newspapers acquaint the town's inhabitants with nationalism. Tensions flare following the assassination of Empress Elisabeth of Austria in 1898. In 1908, Austria-Hungary formally annexes Bosnia-Herzegovina, sparking tensions with Serbia, which the Austro-Hungarians come to regard as a serious obstacle to their further conquest of the eastern Balkans. The Balkan Wars of 1912–13 see the Ottomans almost completely forced from the region, and relations between Austria-Hungary and Serbia deteriorate further. The significance of the middle portion of the bridge also becomes undermined, as residents of different ethnicities become suspicious and wary of one another.|$|E
