40|$|Statement of the ProblemThe {{paramount}} {{purpose of}} the study was to develop a model disaster plan to assist practicing school administrators in being prepared for fiscal loss impacts after major man-made or natural disasters. Procedure UsedThe study was limited to agencies, persons, and materials relating to fiscal losses resulting from major disasters. Department of education officials in eight states that had been repeatedly plagued by major natural disasters submitted information regarding what steps a school administrator should take to offset fiscal loss impact resulting from a major disaster. Officials ofthree major insurance companies were interviewed to provide defined procedures for underwriters to follow in writing exposure coverage when Insuring public school corporations. Data were gathered from literature and personal Interviews. Persons Interviewed Included school officials, Insurance officials, and underwriters. FindingsFindings were based on the data gathered. 1. There was a lack of conformity In writing insurance schedules. 2. School administrators generally, did not exhibit insurance schedule writing and marketing. 3. Clear guidelines for school administrators in handling fiscal losses resulting from major disasters were not being provided by any of the state departments of education. 4. The school corporations studied were found to have insufficient insurance coverage and had depended upon P. L. 81 - 815 and P. L. 81 - 874 for funds to offset fiscal losses. 5. School administrators frequently were reluctant to purchase contingency insurance for added fiscal protection in the event of fiscal disaster. ConclusionsConclusions based on the findings were as follows: l. A reluctancy exists among school officials to plan adequately for future disasters by carrying adequate insurance. 2. Generally, administrators lack knowledge in insurance programming. 3. Educational inventories are, in general, outdated and Incomplete. 4. Fiscal losses arise from inept selection of underwriters or marketing the schedule of exposures. GuidelinesThe following recommendations are guidelines to aid acting school administrators in offsetting fiscal losses caused by major disasters. The recommendations, based on the findings and conclusions of the study were divided into two categories: (I) pre-disaster action and (2) post-disaster action. I. Pre-disaster Action:A. Conduct a complete inventory of educational property initially. 1. Attach a replacement cost of each category of property to the inventories. 2. Update the inventories at least once each year. B. Have all educational facilities evaluated by professional appraisers. 1. Subsequent inventory reevaluation should be conducted by professional appraisersannually. 2. Inventories should be maintained under custodial care in a safe guarded place,protected from storm and fire. C. Use updated appraisal inventory as a basis for the purchase of necessary disaster insurance coverage. D. Utilize risk managers, professional appraisers, and insurance underwriters in preparing <b>blanket</b> <b>insurance</b> coverage as dictated by Inventories II. Post-disaster Action:Design a hazard survey chart to determine the losses and particular areas effected. B. Ascertain to what extent the losses are covered by insurance. Use immediate means and agencies to offset fiscal loss due to disaster. D. Immediately set about planning for reestablishing the educational curricular instructional programs. Recommendations for Further ResearchThe following recommendations for further research were generated as a result of the findings ofthe study. 1. Research should be conducted to determine attitudes of school boards about allocating resources for the purchase of sufficient insurance to offset fiscal losses resulting from man-made or natural disasters. 2. A study should be conducted to determine what school administrative courses should provide preparation for school administrators in insurance programming and the marketing of insurance schedules. 3. A similar study with a broader based sample should be undertaken to validate and/or improve upon the guidelines for school administrators generated from this study. Thesis (Ed. S. ...|$|E

5000|$|For instance, in vehicle {{insurance}} {{a typical}} Personal Auto Policy will cover {{not only the}} original named insured that purchased the auto policy, but will also cover additional persons while they are driving the auto with permission of the named insured. This is a simple type of <b>blanket</b> additional <b>insurance</b> arrangement, {{because it does not}} identify the additional insured by name, but by a [...] "blanket" [...] general description that will automatically apply to many persons. Similarly, in liability insurance, all directors, officers, and employees of a named insured company will also enjoy the status of being an insured, so long as they are acting in their capacity of carrying out the business of the named insured company. These persons enjoy insured status only while they pursue the business of the named insured. If they deviate to pursue their own affairs, they lose this extension of coverage. This extension of coverage to people with a constant and close relationship to the named insured company is accomplished via the [...] "Who Is An Insured" [...] section of the liability policy. In other cases, the original named insured wishes to extend coverage to others who would not come within these standard categories. To extend coverage further, Additional Insured Endorsements are added to the policy.|$|R
