40|$|Native {{speakers}} of English and non-native {{speakers of}} English come from different backgrounds, like ethnic, social and educational backgrounds, so communication <b>break</b> <b>down</b> occurs in NS-NNS? conversations. In {{order to get}} a two-way communication, NS uses repairing strategies to repair this communication <b>break</b> <b>down.</b> The writer uses Wardhaugh theory of Communication <b>Break</b> <b>Down</b> (1985) and Long theory of Repairing Strategies (1983) in this research. She analyzed NS-NNS? conversations based on Communication <b>Break</b> <b>Down</b> theory and Repairing Strategies theory.

5|$|Hygrophoropsis aurantiaca secretes {{large amounts}} of oxalic acid—a {{reducing}} agent and relatively strong acid—into the soil around its woody substrate. This chemical stimulates weathering of the humus layer of forest soil, as the organic matter in soil <b>breaks</b> <b>down</b> into smaller molecules. This influences the solubility and turnover of nutrients (particularly phosphorus and nitrogen), which in turn affects their availability for use by forest trees.|$|E

5|$|The fungus {{contains}} a cyclopropylglutamine compound called coprine.

5|$|A single fungal serpin {{has been}} {{characterized}} to date: celpin from Piromyces spp. strain E2. Piromyces is a genus of anaerobic fungi found in the gut of ruminants and is important for digesting plant material. Celpin is predicted to be inhibitory and contains two N-terminal dockerin domains {{in addition to its}} serpin domain. Dockerins are commonly found in proteins that localise to the fungal cellulosome, a large extracellular multiprotein complex that <b>breaks</b> <b>down</b> cellulose. It is therefore suggested that celpin may protect the cellulosome against plant proteases. Certain bacterial serpins similarly localize to the cellulosome.|$|E
