25|$|The Netherlands - Dutch {{police and}} local {{supervisors}} (known as buitengewoon opsporingsambtenaar, or BOA) fine citizens for throwing away cans, <b>bottles</b> or <b>wrappers</b> on the street.|$|R
50|$|Another {{example of}} C2C design is a {{disposable}} cup, <b>bottle,</b> or <b>wrapper</b> made {{entirely out of}} biological materials. When the user is finished with the item, it can be disposed of {{and returned to the}} natural environment; the cost of disposal of waste such as landfill and recycling is eliminated. The user could also potentially return the item for a refund so it can be used again.|$|R
50|$|In the Netherlands, the County Board {{municipalities}} {{as well as}} Rijkswaterstaat {{play a role in}} {{cleaning up}} litter. The Dutch police and local supervisors (known as buitengewoon opsporingsambtenaar, or BOA) fine citizens for throwing away cans, <b>bottles</b> or <b>wrappers</b> onto the street. The standard fine is 90 euro, unless the defendant is between the ages of 12 and 16. In that case, the penalty is halved to 45 euro.|$|R
5000|$|... “As I gazed {{from the}} deck at the surface of what {{ought to have been}} a {{pristine}} ocean,” Moore later wrote in an essay for Natural History, “I was confronted, {{as far as the eye}} could see, with the sight of plastic. It seemed unbelievable, but I never found a clear spot. In the week it took to cross the subtropical high, no matter what time of day I looked, plastic debris was floating everywhere: <b>bottles,</b> <b>bottle</b> caps, <b>wrappers,</b> fragments.” An oceanographic colleague of Moore’s dubbed this floating junk yard “the Great Pacific Garbage Patch,” and despite Moore’s efforts to suggest different metaphors — “a swirling sewer,” “a superhighway of trash” connecting two “trash cemeteries” — “Garbage Patch” appears to have stuck.|$|R
60|$|As to the {{neighbourhood}} {{which had}} hesitated {{to acknowledge the}} railroad in its straggling days, that had grown wise and penitent, as any Christian might in such a case, and now boasted of its powerful and prosperous relation. There were railway patterns in its drapers' shops, and railway journals {{in the windows of}} its newsmen. There were railway hotels, office-houses, lodging-houses, boarding-houses; railway plans, maps, views, <b>wrappers,</b> <b>bottles,</b> sandwich-boxes, and time-tables; railway hackney-coach and stands; railway omnibuses, railway streets and buildings, railway hangers-on and parasites, and flatterers out of all calculation. There was even railway time observed in clocks, as if the sun itself had given in. Among the vanquished was the master chimney-sweeper, whilom incredulous at Staggs's Gardens, who now lived in a stuccoed house three stories high, and gave himself out, with golden flourishes upon a varnished board, as contractor for the cleansing of railway chimneys by machinery.|$|R
