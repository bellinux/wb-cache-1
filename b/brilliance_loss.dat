40|$|The UNILAC will be {{upgraded}} as a {{high current}} injector for SIS. This paper focuses on beam dynamics studies in the newly designed stripper section, the poststripper Al-varez accelerator and the transport line to SIS considering space charge effects along the UNILAC. Simulation results for the matching to the Alvarez linac, emittance growth ef-fects in the poststripper linac and the beam transfer line to the SIS including the modified foilstripper and charge sep-aration system will be discussed. The beam <b>brilliance</b> <b>loss</b> due to foil straggling and space charge forces will be cal-culated. Beam experiments at the present UNILAC under comparable space charge conditions are reported. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{inclined}} crystal geometry {{has been}} suggested {{as a method of}} reducing the surface absorbed power density of high-heat-load monochromators for third-generation synchrotron radiation sources. Computer simulations have shown that if the crystals are perfectly aligned and have no strains then the diffraction properties of a pair of inclined crystals are very similar to a pair of conventional flat crystals with only subtle effects differentiating the two configurations. However, if the crystals are strained, these subtle differences in the behavior of inclined crystals can result in large beam divergences causing <b>brilliance</b> and flux <b>losses.</b> This manuscript elaborates on these issues and estimates potential <b>brilliance</b> and flux <b>losses</b> from strained inclined crystals at the APS...|$|R
