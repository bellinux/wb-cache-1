40|$|Eight healthy volunteers {{received}} a 1, 000 -mg single oral dose of 2085 P {{which consisted of}} 800 mg of pivampicillin and 200 mg of <b>brobactam.</b> Concentrations of ampicillin and <b>brobactam</b> in plasma, inflammatory fluid, and urine were measured over the subsequent 24 h. Pivampicillin and <b>brobactam</b> were moderately rapidly absorbed. The mean (standard deviation) maximum concentration in plasma (Cmax) of ampicillin was 8. 2 (1. 9) micrograms/ml, and that of <b>brobactam</b> was 2. 1 (2. 0) micrograms/ml at mean times of 1. 9 (0. 5) and 2. 3 (0. 8) h, respectively. The elimination half-lives in plasma were 1. 8 (0. 5) and 1. 6 (2. 0) h, respectively. Both agents penetrated the experimentally induced inflammatory fluid, reaching a mean maximum at 3 h. The Cmax of ampicillin was 6. 8 (2. 3) micrograms/ml, and that of <b>brobactam</b> was 1. 0 (0. 4) micrograms/ml. The penetration (derived by comparing the area under the concentration-time curve from 0 h to infinity for inflammatory fluid with that for plasma) was 97. 3 % (26. 0 %) for ampicillin and 81 % (22. 3 %) for <b>brobactam.</b> The 24 -h urinary recovery was 54. 2 % (16. 6 %) of the administered dose for ampicillin and 40. 2 % (11. 4 %) for <b>brobactam.</b> These data suggest that this combination of beta-lactam and inhibitor should be efficacious in treating infections caused by ampicillin-resistant pathogens...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} analyze its kinetic parameters, an Ambler class A {{carbapenemase}} NMC-A was purified. NMC-A demonstrated unusually strong hydrolytic activity towards imipenem and meropenem. Moreover, it hydrolyzed cephamycins with & values uncommonly high for {{this class of}} P-lactamases. Clavulanic acid and tazobactam had comparable inhibitory activity against NMC-A, whereas ulbactam was the least active inhibitor. Noticeably, NMC-A was more readily inhibited by <b>brobactam.</b> All these catalytic properties uggest that NMC-A possesses an original structure of its active site allowing hydrolysis of p-lactams usually stable to the hydrolytic activity of class A p-lactamases...|$|E
40|$|Five plasmid-mediated P-lactamases conferring {{high-level}} {{resistance to}} ceftazidime were isolated from Klebsiellapneumoniae strains {{in the same}} hospital. These enzymes had isoelectric points ranging from 5. 3 to 6. 5 (CAZ- 1, 5. 55; CAZ- 2, 6. 0; CAZ- 3, 5. 3; CAZ- 6, 6. 5; and CAZ- 7, 6. 3). All isolates and their Escherichia coli transconjugants were highly resistant to amoxicillin (MICs,> 4, 096,ug/ml), piperacillin (64 to 256,ug/ml), cephalothin (32 to 256,ug/ml), and ceftazidime (32 to 512,ig/ml) but remained moderately susceptible to cefotaxime (0. 5 to 8,ug/ml). Only CAZ- 6 - and CAZ- 7 -producing strains were highly resistant to aztreonam (64 to 128,ug/ml). All the isolates remained susceptible to moxalactam and imipenem. The reduced activity of piperacillin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, or aztreonam was restored by 2,ug of clavulanate, sulbactam, tazobactam, or <b>brobactam</b> per ml for E. coli producing CAZ- 2, CAZ- 3, and CAZ- 7. Sulbactam had a lowe...|$|E
40|$|IRT- 14 (TEM- 45) {{is a new}} mutant TEM-type {{beta-lactamase}} {{that was}} isolated from clinical Escherichia coli P 37 and that confers resistance to broad-spectrum penicillins with reduced sensitivity to beta-lactamase inhibitors. The MICs of amoxicillin alone and of amoxicillin combined with 2 micrograms of clavulanic acid or 2 micrograms of tazobactam per ml were 4, 096, 2, 048, and 1, 024 micrograms/ml, respectively. The strain was susceptible to cephalosporins, aztreonam, moxalactam, and imipenem. The enzyme was purified to homogeneity, {{and values of the}} kinetic parameters Kcat, Km, and Kcat/Km were determined for different substrates. This enzyme, with a pI of 5. 2, was found to have reduced affinity for broad-spectrum penicillins and cephalosporins. The values of 50 % inhibitory concentrations of clavulanic acid, sulbactam, tazobactam, and <b>brobactam</b> are correlated with the higher KmS for substrates. The resistance of E. coli P 37 to mechanism-based inactivators results from a higher level of production of the TEM-derived enzyme due to the G-to-T substitution at position 162 (G- 162 [...] >T) in the promoter region of blaTEM and from the structural modifications resulting from the Met- 69 [...] >Leu and Arg- 275 [...] >Gln substitutions that characterize IRT- 14 beta-lactamase...|$|E

Only CAZ- 6 - and CAZ- 7 -producing strains were highly resistant to aztreonam (64 to 128 micrograms/ml). All the isolates remained susceptible to moxalactam and imipenem. The reduced activity of piperacillin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, or aztreonam was restored by 2 micrograms of clavulanate, sulbactam, tazobactam, or <b>brobactam</b> per ml for E. coli producing CAZ- 2, CAZ- 3, and CAZ- 7. Sulbactam had a lower protective effect than other inhibitors for E. coli harboring CAZ- 1 and especially CAZ- 6. Except for CAZ- 1, which was mediated by a 150 -kilobase (kb) plasmid (pCFF 14), the other ceftazidimases were mediated by plasmids of 85 kb with EcoRI digestion patterns {{similar to that of}} pCFF 04 encoding CTX- 1 beta-lactamase. A TEM probe hybridized with a 19 -kb EcoRI fragment of all these closely related plasmids...|$|E
