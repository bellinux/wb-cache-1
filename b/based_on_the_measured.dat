500|$|Silicate volcanism, {{involving}} basaltic lava with mafic to ultramafic (magnesium-rich) compositions, {{was confirmed}} by the Galileo spacecraft in the 1990s and 2000s from temperature measurements of Io's numerous hot spots, locations where thermal emission is detected, and from spectral measurements of Io's dark material. Temperature measurements from Galileos Solid-State Imager (SSI) and Near-Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (NIMS) revealed numerous hot spots with high-temperature components ranging from at least [...] {{to a maximum of}} , like at the Pillan Patera eruption in 1997. Initial estimates {{during the course of the}} Galileo mission suggesting eruption temperatures approaching [...] have since proven to be overestimates because the wrong thermal models were used to calculate the temperatures. Spectral observations of Io's dark material suggested the presence of orthopyroxenes, such as enstatite, magnesium-rich silicate minerals common in mafic and ultramafic basalt. This dark material is seen in volcanic pits, fresh lava flows, and pyroclastic deposits surrounding recent, explosive volcanic eruptions. <b>Based</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>measured</b> temperature of the lava and the spectral measurements, some of the lava may be analogous to terrestrial komatiites. Compressional superheating, which could increase the temperature of magma during ascent to the surface during an eruption, may also be a factor in some of the higher temperature eruptions.|$|E

2500|$|The Columbia River Basalt Group flows exhibit {{essentially}} uniform {{chemical properties}} through {{the bulk of}} individual flows, suggesting rapid placement. Ho and Cashman (1997) characterized the -long Ginkgo flow of the Columbia River Basalt Group, determining {{that it had been}} formed in roughly a week, <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>measured</b> melting temperature along the flow from the origin to the most distant point of the flow, combined with hydraulics considerations. The Ginkgo basalt was examined over its [...] flow path from a Ginkgo flow feeder dike near Kahlotus, Washington to the flow terminus in the Pacific Ocean at Yaquina Head, Oregon. The basalt had an upper melting temperature of 1095 ± 5°C and a lower temperature to 1085 ± 5°C; this indicates that the maximum temperature drop along the Ginkgo flow was 20°C. The lava must have spread quickly to achieve this uniformity. Analyses indicate that the flow must remain laminar, as turbulent flow would cool more quickly. This could be accomplished by sheet flow, which can travel at velocities of [...] without turbulence and minimal cooling, suggesting that the Ginkgo flow occurred in less than a week. The cooling/hydraulics analyses are supported by an independent indicator; if longer periods were required, external water from temporarily dammed rivers would intrude, resulting in both more dramatic cooling rates and increased volumes of pillow lava. [...] Ho’s analysis is consistent with the analysis by Reidel et al. (1994), who proposed a maximum Pomona flow emplacement duration of several months based on the time required for rivers to be reestablished in their canyons following a basalt flow interruption.|$|E

The infrared surface brightness of the Galactic cirrus must correlate with the neutral hydrogen column densities, since they originate from the same, low density structure.
