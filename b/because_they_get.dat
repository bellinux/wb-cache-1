5|$|The addax are amply {{suited to}} live in the deep desert under extreme conditions. They can survive without free water almost indefinitely, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> {{moisture}} from their food and dew that condenses on plants. Scientists believe the addax has a special lining in its stomach that stores water in pouches to use in times of dehydration. They also produce highly concentrated urine to conserve water. Pale colour of the coat reflects radiant heat, and the length and density of the coat helps in thermoregulation. In the day the addax huddle together in shaded areas, and in cool nights rest in sand hollows. These practices help in dissipation of body heat and saving water by cooling the body through evaporation.|$|E

Agricultural feedstocks are considered renewable <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> energy from the sun using photosynthesis, provided that all minerals required for growth (such as nitrogen and phosphorus) are returned to the land. Ethanol can be produced {{from a variety of}} feedstocks such as sugar cane, bagasse, miscanthus, sugar beet, sorghum, grain, switchgrass, barley, hemp, kenaf, potatoes, sweet potatoes, cassava, sunflower, fruit, molasses, corn, stover, grain, wheat, straw, cotton, other biomass, as well as many types of cellulose waste and harvesting, whichever has the best well-to-wheel assessment.|$|E
25|$|Among the Pros the Cumulative {{method is}} preferred. Not only <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> to race more, it lessens {{the chance of}} luck playing {{as a factor in}} any given race event. In 1985 Greg Hill staged a {{personal}} boycott of ABA nationals in part of his dislike of the transfer system. Cumulative scoring is not only used in the ABA and NBL pro qualifying motos but in the mains, in which the pros are required to race the mains three times to win points and prize money. Cumulative scoring, also known as Olympic scoring, is used by the UCI in their international BMX program and was used in the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China for both amateurs and professionals. The ABA continues to use the Transfer System for its amateur classes.|$|E

25|$|The Gullah {{have also}} {{struggled}} {{to preserve their}} traditional culture {{in the face of}} much more contact with modern culture and media. In 1979, a translation of the New Testament into the Gullah language was begun. The American Bible Society published De Nyew Testament in 2005. In November 2011, Healin fa de Soul, a five-CD collection of readings from the Gullah Bible, was released. This collection includes Scipcha Wa De Bring Healing ("Scripture That Heals") and the Gospel of John (De Good Nyews Bout Jedus Christ Wa John Write). This was also the most extensive collection of Gullah recordings, surpassing those of Lorenzo Dow Turner. The recordings have helped people develop an interest in the culture, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> to hear the language and learn how to pronounce some words.|$|E
500|$|Weinstein {{said that}} this episode was an {{opportunity}} for him, Oakley, and Swartzwelder to [...] "go nuts" [...] with the [...] "Burns-ism". He said that they enjoy writing for characters such as Burns and Abe Simpson because of their [...] "out-datedness", and <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> to use thesauruses for looking up [...] "old time slang". For example, Burns answers the phone by saying [...] "Ahoy, hoy!", which was suggested by Alexander Graham Bell {{to be used as}} the proper telephone answer when the telephone was first invented. Burns' kitchen is full of [...] "crazy old-time" [...] devices and contraptions. For inspiration, Weinstein brought in [...] "a bunch" [...] of old books with designs of old kitchen devices. Oakley commented that the stuffed polar bear had always been in Burns' office, and they were excited to [...] "finally" [...] have a use for it.|$|E
500|$|<b>Because</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> {{so little}} energy from their diet, koalas must limit their energy use and sleep 20 {{hours a day}}; only 4 hours a day are spent in active movement. They are {{predominantly}} active at night and {{spend most of their}} waking hours feeding. They typically eat and sleep in the same tree, possibly for as long as a day. On very hot days, a koala may climb down to the coolest part of the tree which is cooler than the surrounding air. [...] The koala hugs the tree to lose heat without panting. On warm days, a koala may rest with its back against a branch or lie on its stomach or back with its limbs dangling. During cold, wet periods, it curls itself into a tight ball to conserve energy. On windy days, a koala finds a lower, thicker branch on which to rest. While it spends most of the time in the tree, the animal descends to the ground to move to another tree, walking on all fours. The koala usually grooms itself with its hindpaws, but sometimes uses its forepaws or mouth.|$|E

2500|$|... "Stag profit" [...] is a {{situation}} {{in the stock market}} before and immediately after a company's Initial public offering (or any new issue of shares). A [...] "stag" [...] is a party or individual who subscribes to the new issue expecting the price of the stock to rise immediately upon the start of trading. Thus, stag profit is the financial gain accumulated by the party or individual resulting from the value of the shares rising. [...] This term is more popular in the United Kingdom than in the United States. [...] In the US, such investors are usually called flippers, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> shares in the offering and then immediately turn around [...] "flipping" [...] or selling them {{on the first day of}} trading.|$|E

[...] It may seem cruel that those whose sufferings are real, whose illness has been brought on by enemy action and very likely in the course of patriotic service, should be treated with such apparent callousness. [...] But there can be no doubt that in an overwhelming proportion of cases, these patients succumb to 'shock' <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> something out of it. [...] To give them this reward is not ultimately a benefit to them because it encourages the weaker tendencies in their character.

He played 177 matches in all, taking 593 wickets at just 24.67. He claimed five wickets in an innings 35 times and ten wickets in a match on ten occasions. He was no batsman, scoring 1117 runs at 6.76 with a top score of 33. He took 48 catches.

2500|$|The {{lack of a}} State Government {{contingency}} plan was criticised by Robert Amin, Curtin University's chair of Petroleum Engineering {{and chair of the}} Woodside Research Foundation, who said the Government should have stored enough gas in underground reservoirs to power the state for at least one month, to mitigate a potential crisis. Amin said gas could be stored in parts of the Perth Basin depleted of gas, like Dongara, and companies could be offered tax incentives. Federal Opposition spokesperson for trade, Ian Macfarlane, called for a national audit of all gas pipelines, and highlighted the vulnerability of the single pipeline that carries WA's gas from the North West Shelf. Macfarlane said, [...] "At the very least this event comes as a wake-up call {{for the construction of a}} second pipeline from the North West shelf to supply gas to industry especially in the south-western part of Western Australia." [...] Professor Dong-ke Zhang, Director of the Centre for Petroleum, Fuels and Energy at the University of Western Australia, said, [...] "I would have thought it was quite silly for a very advanced state like WA that we are not able to cope with an incident like this by not having the ability to divert gas from an LNG plant to the domestic pipeline. At a policy level, the infrastructure needs to be longer term and the Government should encourage major players like Woodside and Chevron to invest in the infrastructure and give the incentives for the industry to come to the party <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> much bigger margins by selling LNG overseas." ...|$|E
