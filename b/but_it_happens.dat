My first thought would be, 'Maybe I could call her up, maybe I could get on that record.' The most obvious [...] is it's neither one of our records. It's not like you made an {{original}} idea. She's not in hip-hop, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>happens</b> in hip-hop often. We go to sample the same thing and my record came out first. I'm sorry. What can I do?" [...] He went on saying that if he had known they were both planning to sample the same Tupac song, he would have arranged a duet with her.|$|E
500|$|Bridges {{opined that}} Tron: Legacy was evocative {{of a modern}} myth, adding that ideas {{alluding}} to technological advancement were prevalent throughout the film. To Cyriaque Lamar of io9, the film's approach to technology was reminiscent of a kōan. [...] "One {{of the things that}} brought me to this film," [...] affirmed Bridges, [...] "was the idea of helping to create a modern-day myth to help us navigate through these technological waters [...] I dig immediate gratification as much as anybody, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>happens</b> so fast that if you make a decision like that, you can go far down the wrong path. Think about those plastic single-use water bottles. Where did that come from? Who decided that? You can have a couple of swigs of water [...] and those bottles don't disintegrate entirely. Microscopic animals eat the plastic, and the fish eat those, and we're all connected. It's a finite situation here." ...|$|E
2500|$|His {{first goal}} of the season came in a 3–0 win at Yeovil Town on 24 August, which was quickly {{followed}} up by his first career hat-trick in a 5–1 win at Millwall on 14 September, which {{was also the first}} league hat-trick by a Derby player since Paul Simpson in April 1996. After a 1–0 defeat at Nottingham Forest, with the club having won only once in the last six matches, having failed to win at home, and lying in 14th place, manager Nigel Clough was sacked. Bryson was saddened by the move, saying it came as a [...] "shock", adding that Clough [...] "has been excellent for me, he brought me down from Scotland and gave me my chance in England. So obviously I was sad to see him go. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>happens</b> in football {{and you just have to}} get on with it." [...] Clough was replaced by Steve McClaren and Bryson said that he was looking forward to working with the new manager.|$|E

"Of course," [...] {{continued}} the managing director, [...] "I need not say to you, that his independent spirit would never permit him to accept of {{assistance in the}} form which would be most immediately beneficial to him.

There is no collateral testimony: Middleton knew nothing of it; Anderson knew nothing of it; it was not directly communicated to the faithful Larkins or the trusty Croftes;--which proves, indeed, the facility of concealment. The fact is, you find the application always upon the discovery. But concealment or discovery is a thing of accident.|$|E

60|$|At {{another time}} Elizabeth might have turned upon him and rent {{him for that}} speech. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>happened</b> {{that she was in}} high good-humour that afternoon, and {{disposed}} to indulgence.

60|$|<b>But,</b> <b>it</b> <b>happens</b> very unluckily, that, {{for some}} time past, all {{endeavours}} or proposals from private persons, to advance the public service; however honestly and innocently designed, have been called flying in the King's face: And this, to my knowledge, hath been the style of some persons, whose ancestors, (I mean those among them who had any) and themselves, have been flying in princes' faces these fourscore years; and from their own inclinations would do so still, if their interest did not lead them rather to fly {{in the face of}} a kingdom; which hath given them wings to enable them for such a flight.|$|E
60|$|From this {{it will be}} {{seen that}} I am not {{claiming}} a discovery; that what I have called a secret of the charm of flowers is a secret known to every man, woman, and child, even to those of my own friends who stoutly deny that they have any such knowledge. But I think it is best known to children. What I am here doing is merely to bring together and put in form certain more or less vague thoughts and feelings which I (and therefore all of us) have about flowers; {{and it is a}} small matter, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>happens</b> to be one which no person has hitherto attempted.|$|E
60|$|He {{returned}} to America {{in the autumn}} of 1874, after some summer wanderings that are shewn by the 'Transatlantic Sketches' to have taken him through Holland and Belgium. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>happens</b> that at this point there is an almost empty gap of a year and more in his surviving correspondence, and {{it is not possible to}} follow him closely. He disappears with the still agitating question upon his hands--where was he to live?--his American loyalty still fighting it out with his European inclination. The steps are lost by which the doubt was determined in the course of another year at home. It is only certain that when he next came to Europe, twelve months later, it had been quieted for ever.|$|E
