5|$|Greek {{officials}} and the public were enthusiastic about the experience of hosting an Olympic Games. This feeling was shared {{by many of the}} athletes, who even demanded that Athens be the permanent Olympic host city. The IOC intended for subsequent Games to <b>be</b> <b>rotated</b> to various host cities around the world. The second Olympics was held in Paris.|$|E
5|$|Neutron {{interferometry}} {{has been}} used to investigate the Aharonov–Bohm effect, {{to examine the effects of}} gravity acting on an elementary particle, and to demonstrate a strange behavior of fermions that is at the basis of the Pauli exclusion principle: Unlike macroscopic objects, when fermions are rotated by 360° about any axis, they do not return to their original state, but develop a minus sign in their wave function. In other words, a fermion needs to <b>be</b> <b>rotated</b> 720° before returning to its original state.|$|E
5|$|On 15 March 2012, The Swarm officially {{opened to}} the public. In January 2013, Thorpe Park {{announced}} that the last two rows on The Swarm would <b>be</b> <b>rotated</b> to face backwards for 2013, a first for a Wing Coaster. The park's tag line for this experience is 'THE SWARM- Brave It Backwards'. The park additionally announced that they were adding a damaged, mangled billboard, which the train travels through. In 2016 the seats were returned to all facing forwards.|$|E
50|$|Alternative Johnson solids, {{constructed}} by rotating different cupolae of a rhombicosidodecahedron, are:the gyrate rhombicosidodecahedron (J72) where only one cupola <b>is</b> <b>rotated,</b> the metabigyrate rhombicosidodecahedron (J74) where two non-opposing cupolae <b>are</b> <b>rotated</b> and the trigyrate rhombicosidodecahedron (J75) where three cupolae <b>are</b> <b>rotated.</b>|$|R

5|$|On 28 November—after 23 October 1983 Beirut barracks bombing—the U.S. {{government}} announced that New Jersey would be retained off Beirut although her crew would <b>be</b> <b>rotated.</b> On 14 December, New Jersey fired 11 projectiles from her 16-inch (406mm) guns at hostile positions inland of Beirut. These {{were the first}} 16-inch (406mm) shells fired for effect {{anywhere in the world}} since New Jersey ended her time on the gunline in Vietnam in 1969.|$|E
5|$|Originally, the {{standard}} complement of each submarine was six officers and thirty-six sailors, with facilities to carry an additional twelve personnel (usually trainees). This number was minimised by the RAN during design, which insisted that functions be automated where possible; the RAN also requiring that each sailor {{have his own}} rack and {{did not need to}} 'hot bunk'. It was originally intended that multiple ship's companies be established per submarine, and that these <b>be</b> <b>rotated</b> to maximise the submarines' time at sea without adversely affecting personnel, but difficulties in maintaining submariner numbers made this plan unworkable. Enlisted submariners are accommodated in six-bunk cabins.|$|E
5|$|Royal Air Force policy {{required}} {{pilots to}} <b>be</b> <b>rotated</b> to home establishment for rest and instructional duties after nine to twelve months in combat. Promoted to captain in March 1918, Holden was posted to England in May as a flying instructor with No.6 (Training) Squadron at Minchinhampton. His unit {{was part of}} the 1st Training Wing, led by Lieutenant Colonel Watt, the former commanding officer of No.2 Squadron. Holden briefly took command of No.6 Squadron from 25 July to 11 August. He was awarded the Air Force Cross, promulgated on 3 June 1919, for his skill as an instructor.|$|E

5|$|The inputs {{operated}} by the bomb-aimer's mate drove a mechanical calculator inside the console, or computor. The output of the calculator drove flexible shafts that rotated the sight head to the proper angles in azimuth and altitude, representing the wind drift and range angle. The sight head replaced the older wire crosshairs with a modern reflector sight that {{was easy to see}} at night. The sight could <b>be</b> <b>rotated</b> manually to view objects well in front of the aircraft, allowing the bomb aimer to select among a wider variety of objects to use for drift measurements.|$|E
5|$|There is some {{spiraling}} of {{the tool}} as it cuts, so the form {{at the bottom of}} the workpiece may <b>be</b> <b>rotated</b> with respect to the form at the top of the hole or profile. Spiraling may be undesirable because it binds the body {{of the tool}} and prevents it from cutting sharply. One solution to this is to reverse the rotation in mid cut, causing the tool to spiral in the opposite direction. If reversing the machine is not practical, then interrupting the cut is another possible solution.|$|E
5|$|Franklin's machine used a {{belt and}} pulley system that could be {{operated}} by one person turning a crank. A large pulley {{was attached to the}} crank-handle, and a much smaller pulley was attached to a large glass globe. An iron axle passed through the globe. This allowed the globe to <b>be</b> <b>rotated</b> at high speed. When the crank was turned, the glass globe rubbed against a leather pad, which generated a large static charge, similar to the electrical charge that could be created by rubbing a glass tube with wool cloth by hand. The machine was unique improvement over others made in Europe at the time, as the glass globe could be spun faster with much less labor. A few revolutions of the handle was all that was needed to charge a Leyden jar.|$|E

5|$|The CAB {{carried out}} flight tests using a DC-6. They {{found that if}} the {{propellers}} were reversed prior to take-off they would not, if the flag was not raised, <b>be</b> <b>rotated</b> automatically again {{in the air to}} produce forward thrust if full power was applied. Tests performed by United Airlines showed that, if the propellers of just one engine were reversed and full power was applied to all four engines, then the aircraft would spiral into a dive. If METO (maximum except take-off) power was applied to Nos. 1, 2 and 3 engines, and full reverse thrust was applied to engine No. 4, then the aircraft would become uncontrollable.|$|E
5|$|The first udema {{was built}} in 1760 and had two masts (mainmast and foremast) that were {{originally}} rigged with lateen sails. It was later provided with a square sail rig {{similar to that of}} a polacca bark without topgallant sails. It had a low hull with a small quarterdeck structure and an arrangement of guns that was unique for its time. Its main armament consisted of a single line of eight 12-pound guns along the centerline of the ship and two 12-pounders in the bow facing forwards. The centerline guns used pivoting carriages that could <b>be</b> <b>rotated</b> 360 degrees and aimed to either side of the ship, similar to the main guns of the dreadnought battleships of the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|There are two new battle mechanics: Triple Battles and Rotation Battles. In Triple Battles, {{both teams}} must send out three Pokémon {{in a row}} at once; Pokémon on {{the left or right}} side can only attack the opponent's Pokémon on the same side or in the center. Changing {{position}} takes up one turn. In Rotation Battles, each side sends out three Pokémon at once, but they are arranged in a circle that can <b>be</b> <b>rotated</b> at will. Black has more Rotation Battles than Triple Battles, and the opposite is true in White. Another introduction is Combination Moves: a starter Pokémon can be taught one of three moves, and using them together in Double or Triple battles produces more powerful attacks. In the wild, walking through different-colored tall grass can trigger Double Battles against wild Pokémon rather than only Single Battles as usual.|$|E

The cutters that <b>are</b> <b>rotated</b> <b>are</b> timed with the workpiece. This process produces internal gears, external gears, and integral gear-pinion arrangements.|$|R
50|$|Three {{scenarios}} were {{suggested by}} Newton {{to answer the}} question of whether the absolute rotation of a local frame can be detected; that is, if an observer can decide whether an observed object <b>is</b> <b>rotating</b> or if the observer <b>is</b> <b>rotating.</b>|$|R

5|$|Grabbed by the Ghoulies is a 3D action-adventure {{game with}} {{platforming}} elements. Breaking with {{the style of}} previous Rare platformers, the gameplay is simple in design, utilising the premise of moving through areas of the game's mansion and completing the required beat 'em up challenges in each room. Such challenges include eliminating all ghouls in a room, beating only a specified kind of ghoul while avoiding eliminating the rest or defeating a boss before the player-character, Cooper, can continue. All combat and melee attacks are manoeuvred by the control sticks, whereas the game's camera can <b>be</b> <b>rotated</b> by both triggers. When the player fails a challenge or takes longer than a set time limit to complete one, the Grim Reaper chases after the player-character; the Reaper will rip out Cooper's soul if the character does not leave the room in time. Standard enemies in the game include zombies, mummies, imps, skeletons and zombie pirates. There are also various bosses that must be defeated in order to advance. Many objects in the game with which the character can interact—including chairs, knives, and axes—can be used as weapons.|$|E
5|$|In 1848–49, Hippolyte Fizeau {{determined}} {{the speed of}} light between an intense light source and a mirror about 8km distant. The light source was interrupted by a rotating cogwheel with 720 notches that could <b>be</b> <b>rotated</b> at a variable speed of up to hundreds of times a second. (Figure1) Fizeau adjusted the rotation speed of the cogwheel until light passing through one notch of the cogwheel would be completely eclipsed by the adjacent tooth. Spinning the cogwheel at 3, 5 and 7 times this basic rotation rate also resulted in eclipsing of the reflected light by the cogwheel teeth next in line. Given the rotational speed of the wheel and the distance between the wheel and the mirror, Fizeau was able to calculate a value of 315000km/s for {{the speed of light}}. It was difficult for Fizeau to visually estimate the intensity minimum of the light being blocked by the adjacent teeth, and his value for light's speed was about 5% too high. Fizeau's paper appeared in Comptes Rendus: Hebdomadaires de scéances de l’Academie de Sciences (Paris, Vol. 29 , pp.90–92).|$|E
5|$|In 1926–1927, a royal {{commission}} into bribery {{of members}} of the police by bookmakers was conducted, finding that it was probable that two detectives and several plainclothes constables were guilty of taking bribes. After considering the report of the royal commission, Leane submitted his own report to the government, in which he criticised the vague nature of its findings, and while accepting that some police may have accepted bribes, he asserted that corruption was not widespread. One detective and three constables were offered the opportunity to resign and took it, and another plainclothes constable was returned to uniformed duty. During the course of the royal commission, several other plainclothes constables had resigned. Before the commission concluded, Leane recommended to the Chief Secretary, James Jelley, who was the minister responsible for the police, that the plainclothes branch of the police be abolished, with uniformed constables to <b>be</b> <b>rotated</b> through those duties as required. His recommendation was accepted. In January 1927, the design by Leane's brother-in-law, Louis Laybourne Smith, was selected for the National War Memorial in Adelaide. In early 1928, Leane became a foundation member and the inaugural president of the Legacy Club of Adelaide, established to assist the dependents of deceased ex-servicemen.|$|E
50|$|Just as J is the {{generator}} for rotation operators, L and S are generators for modified partial rotation operators. The operatorrotates the position (in space) of all particles and fields, without rotating the internal (spin) state of any particle. Likewise, the operatorrotates the internal (spin) state of all particles, without moving any particles or fields in space. The relation J=L+S comes from:i.e. if the positions <b>are</b> <b>rotated,</b> {{and then the}} internal states <b>are</b> <b>rotated,</b> then altogether the complete system has <b>been</b> <b>rotated.</b>|$|R
50|$|It can be {{constructed}} as a rhombicosidodecahedron with three pentagonal cupolae rotated through 36 degrees.Related Johnson solids arethe gyrate rhombicosidodecahedron (J72) where one cupola is rotated,the parabigyrate rhombicosidodecahedron (J73) where two opposing cupolae <b>are</b> <b>rotated</b> andthe metabigyrate rhombicosidodecahedron (J74) where two non-opposing cupolae <b>are</b> <b>rotated.</b>|$|R
50|$|The three {{infantry}} battalions and armoured squadron {{assigned to}} Berlin <b>were</b> <b>rotated</b> regularly; the single armoured squadron was detached from an armoured regiment assigned to I (BR) Corps. The infantry battalions <b>were</b> <b>rotated</b> every two years. All other units were permanently based in Berlin.|$|R
5|$|After {{reaching}} the Utah Line, 27th Brigade was {{withdrawn from the}} front on 17 April, handing over its positions to the South Korean 6th Division. Burke subsequently ordered his battalions into reserve positions north of the previously destroyed village of Kapyong, {{on the main road}} from Seoul to the east coast. Intelligence indicated that a new Chinese offensive was imminent, and while the brigade settled in to rest it remained on three hours notice to move to support IX Corps. Having been on operations continuously for the past seven months, the British intended to relieve the bulk of the brigade during its period in reserve. The two British battalions—the Argylls and the Middlesex—would be replaced by two fresh battalions from Hong Kong, while Burke and the headquarters of 27th Brigade would be replaced by Brigadier George Taylor and the headquarters of 28th Brigade in late-April. The Canadians were scheduled to transfer to the newly raised 25th Canadian Brigade in May as part of Canada's increased commitment to the war. Advance parties from Brigade Headquarters and the Argylls departed for Seoul en route for Hong Kong on 19 April, while the remaining British battalions were scheduled to depart two weeks later. 3 RAR would not <b>be</b> <b>rotated</b> and remained a part of the brigade for the entire war, operating on an individual reinforcement system instead.|$|E
5|$|As an {{adaptation}} for navigating its complex reef environment, the epaulette shark moves by seemingly walking, bending its body from side-to-side and pushing {{off of the}} substrate with its paddle-shaped pectoral and pelvic fins. Its gait {{is similar to that}} of salamanders, an example of convergent evolution. The shark is capable of swimming, but often prefers to walk along the sandy or coral bottom even when the water is deep enough to allow it to swim freely. The cartilaginous supports of the epaulette shark's paired fins are reduced and separated when compared to other sharks, allowing them to <b>be</b> <b>rotated</b> for use as limbs. This mode of locomotion even enables the shark to crawl out of the water to access isolated tidal pools. The gait of the epaulette shark is convergently similar to those of tetrapods such as salamanders, suggesting that the movements needed for walking on land may predate, and facilitated the evolution of, the first terrestrial vertebrates. Epaulette sharks are largely nocturnal and are most active in low water. They often hide inside or below coral heads, though it is enough for the head to be covered even if the rest of the body is exposed. Sometimes they perch in the open on sandy flats or atop reefs facing into the current, a form of orientation known as rheotaxis that may improve respiration or predator awareness.|$|E
5|$|The 767 was {{the first}} Boeing {{wide-body}} to be designed with a two-crew digital glass cockpit. Cathode ray tube (CRT) color displays and new electronics replaced {{the role of the}} flight engineer by enabling the pilot and co-pilot to monitor aircraft systems directly. Despite the promise of reduced crew costs, United Airlines initially demanded a conventional three-person cockpit, citing concerns about the risks associated with introducing a new aircraft. The carrier maintained this position until July 1981, when a US presidential task force determined that a crew of two was safe for operating wide-body jets. A three-crew cockpit remained as an option and was fitted to the first production models. Ansett Australia ordered 767s with three-crew cockpits due to union demands; it was the only airline to operate 767s so configured. The 767's two-crew cockpit was also applied to the 757, allowing pilots to operate both aircraft after a short conversion course, and adding incentive for airlines to purchase both types. Although nominally similar in control design, flying the 767 feels different from the 757. The 757's controls are heavy, similar to the 727 and 747; the control yoke can <b>be</b> <b>rotated</b> to 90 degrees in each direction. The 767 has far lighter control feel in pitch and roll, and the control yoke has approximately 2/3 the rotation travel.|$|E
