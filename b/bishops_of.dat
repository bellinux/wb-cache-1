50|$|Hippolytus of Rome was {{a disciple}} of Irenaeus, a disciple of Polycarp, a disciple of Apostle John. Hippolytus's works were {{considered}} lost {{prior to their}} discovery at a monastery on Mt. Athos in 1854. While his major work The Refutation of All Heresies was readily accepted (once the false attribution to Origen was resolved), his two small works, On the Twelve Apostles of Christ and On the Seventy Apostles of Christ, are still regarded as dubious, put in the appendix of his works in the voluminous collection of the writings of early church fathers. Here is the complete text of Pseudo-Hippolytus's On the Seventy Apostles of Christ:# James the Lord's brother, <b>bishop</b> <b>of</b> Jerusalem.# Cleopas, <b>bishop</b> <b>of</b> Jerusalem.# Matthias, who supplied the vacant place {{in the number of}} the twelve apostles.# Thaddeus, who conveyed the epistle to Augarus.# Ananias, who baptized Paul, and was <b>bishop</b> <b>of</b> Damascus.# Stephen, the first martyr.# Philip, who baptized the eunuch.# Prochorus, <b>bishop</b> <b>of</b> Nicomedia, who also was the first that departed, 11 believing together with his daughters.# Nicanor died when Stephen was martyred.# Timon, <b>bishop</b> <b>of</b> Bostra.# Parmenas, <b>bishop</b> <b>of</b> Soli.# Nicolaus, <b>bishop</b> <b>of</b> Samaria.# Barnabas, <b>bishop</b> <b>of</b> Milan.# Mark the Evangelist, <b>bishop</b> <b>of</b> Alexandria.# Luke the Evangelist.These two belonged to the seventy disciples who were scattered by the offence of the word which Christ spoke, “Except a man eat my flesh, and drink my blood, he is not worthy of me.” But the one being induced to return to the Lord by Peter’s instrumentality, and the other by Paul’s, they were honored to preach that Gospel on account of which they also suffered martyrdom, the one being burned, and the other being crucified on an olive tree.Silas, <b>bishop</b> <b>of</b> Corinth.Silvanus, <b>bishop</b> <b>of</b> Thessalonica.Crisces (Crescens), <b>bishop</b> <b>of</b> Carchedon in Gaul.Epænetus, <b>bishop</b> <b>of</b> Carthage.Andronicus, <b>bishop</b> <b>of</b> Pannonia.Amplias, <b>bishop</b> <b>of</b> Odyssus.Urban, <b>bishop</b> <b>of</b> Macedonia.Stachys, <b>bishop</b> <b>of</b> Byzantium.Barnabas, <b>bishop</b> <b>of</b> HeracleaPhygellus, <b>bishop</b> <b>of</b> Ephesus.

5|$|A crypt was {{constructed}} beneath the former Chapel of St. Anthony in 2009 {{to house the}} remains of former <b>Bishops</b> <b>of</b> Hong Kong.

5|$|Hugh {{afterwards}} became archdeacon of York and {{treasurer of}} York, sometime around 1143, probably through the patronage of William FitzHerbert {{while he was}} serving his first term as Archbishop of York.

5|$|In 787, Pope Hadrian sent a pallium to Hygberht of Lichfield, {{elevating}} Lichfield to an archbishopric, and Ecgfrith was crowned.

5|$|John's {{attempt to}} impose de Gray's {{election}} as Archbishop of Canterbury in 1205 {{was the beginning}} of the king's long quarrel with Pope Innocent III. After Hubert Walter's death in July 1205, the selection of a successor was hindered by doubts about what the proper procedure should be, something that commonly happened with elections to Canterbury. John postponed a decision while delegations from the <b>bishops</b> <b>of</b> England and the monks of the cathedral chapter went to Rome to seek guidance from the pope. The <b>bishops</b> <b>of</b> the province of Canterbury claimed the right to a say in who was elected, as whoever was chosen would be their superior, but according to canon law the monks of the cathedral chapter had the right to elect the new archbishop. The king also had a say in the election, as the archbishop was a major tenant-in-chief and was traditionally one of the principal royal advisers.|$|E
