40|$|Optical linear {{properties}} of quadrupoles are usually {{described in the}} rectangular model approximation, in which the first order transport matrix {{is defined by the}} magnetic length of the quadrupole and by its gradient. This is a very good approximation as long as the ratio between the <b>bore</b> <b>radius</b> and the magnetic length is small. As this ratio increases the field gradient longitudinal behaviour cannot be approximated by a rectangle and the description by the usual matrix is not sufficiently accurate. The deviation of the effective linear transport matrix from the rectangular model increases with the gradient value. A discussion of these deviations for the different types of quadrupoles in DAΦNE is given in the following. DAΦNE Main Ring Quadrupoles In the DAΦNE Main Rings there are eight types of quadrupoles, as reported in the following table. The magnetic length Lq, the <b>bore</b> <b>radius</b> R, and the maximum gradient Gmax (nominal for the permanent magnet types) comes from the lattice design...|$|E

40|$|The {{problem of}} producing, {{preserving}} and stably colliding low emittance bunches {{for long periods}} of time is a formidable problem involving questions of jitter, dynamic alignment and reproducibility associated with magnetic and mechanical hysteresis. Permanent magnets provide ideal solutions for lower capital and operating costs. Because they are light in weight, compact and require no power or cooling they are easy to use, stable and uniquely reliable. With their low permeability, this implies a minimal impact on the surrounding environment and vice versa. For example, they are ideal for final focus systems embedded in particle detectors with strong solenoidal fields while their strength and compactness minimizes the solid angle they subtend around the interaction point(IP) as well a. s their target thickness along the beam line. We discuss calculations where g is a nonlinear, anisotropic function of l?. The results explain discrepancies observed between measurement and calculation of permanent magnet syst,ems and indicate good multipoles are possible with far higher strengths than previously obtained. We extend previous calculations on the obtainable gradients for different types of quadrupoles down to 1 mm <b>bore</b> <b>radii</b> where 2000 T/m appears possible with conventional designs and available materials.

Physical mechanisms of halo production and establishment of uniform distribution inside core for matched and mismatched beams are described. The computer codes KERN+HALO generated for redistribution process of charge density and kinetic and potential energies visual representation are described. We have a clear knowledge of matched (or ideal) beam only in case when space charge does not change a frequency of transverse oscillations. The matched (or ideal) beam is a one which transverse behavior is repeated (or has a smooth change) from one period to the next. The question "What a matched beam imply? ” is arisen when the above definition is extended on the case when space charges essential for transverse oscillation frequency. We can denote that ideal beam has well-known K-V distribution and this distribution must be used for focusing field calculation and for a choice of <b>bore</b> <b>radius.</b> But real beam distributions differ from K-V one and its redistribution during beam transport leads to beam size and emittance growths.

This has been derived {{by studying the}} effects of various parameters such asforging load, forging temperature, die preheat temperature and spark gap on final forged dimensions. Experimental results compare well with theoretical predictions. It has been found for circular forgings that thefinish forged diameter increases {{with an increase in}} forging load, but ifloading is such that it induces an axial stress greater than twice theflow stress of the workpiece material, the dimension offinished product remains constant. Dimension-al variation of forgings due to elastic die deflection decreases when forging temperature increases and at high temperatures is insigniji-cant compared to other factors. For a given die preheat temperature, the higher the forging temperature the greater the increase in forging dimension due to thermal expansion of the die. Thermal shrinkage of the forging is the overwhelming factor influencing forged dimensions at medium and high temperatures. Although friction, work hardening and heat loss were neglected, the close agreement between experimental and theoretical results shows that the theory can be usefully employed in practical situations.

Pulse reflectometry {{has been used in}} the physical modelling of actual musical wind instruments, but the technique has recently been improved to give significantly more accurate results. A previous paper [1] reported on the use of an algorithm to allow for losses caused by signal attenuation over the windway. The technique at this stage still required the manual estimation of DC offset by iteration using a directly-measured <b>bore</b> <b>radius</b> in the test object.

It is shown that SCD-beam bunching depends on two main parameters: {{the first one}} determines the bunching quality, another one is measure for bunching process duration. The changes in bunching process depending on this parameters and on low of RF-field amplitude increase are described. The optimal conditions of SCD-beam bunching are discussed. The computer codes ZHALO generated for bunching beam characteristic visual representation are described. An adiabatic bunching section must be presented at a high-current ion linac for beam loss prevention. The problem is to choose an optimal length of the section as well as optimal values for synchronous phase and accelerating field amplitude. In order to clear up the main regularities of the bunching process the simplest model was used by analogy with the previous case. In {{the context of this}} model the beam without transverse motion and with fixed transverse size is moving inside a channel with <b>bore</b> <b>radius</b> R. Synchronous phase is equal- 90 degrees and the beam is bunching without acceleration. During bunching process the uniform beam gets a longitudinal charge density modulation. The distribution of potential can be obtained {{in the form of an}} expansion into a series by solving a Poisson equation for the beam with periodical charge density modulation and uniform density in any transverse crossection U(r, z) = − ρ x k =...|$|E
40|$|The {{cooling channel}} of the CERN {{reference}} scenario [1] {{for a possible}} neutrino factory [2] requires an approximately 200 m long lattice, which provides solenoidal magnetic fields plus longitudinal electric fields at the same time. The electric real estate field gradient along the structure shall be 2 MV/m at 44 MHz, or 4 MV/m at 88 MHz, respectively. The CERN approach incorporates the solenoids into the cavity geometry {{in order to avoid}} the large dimensions of solenoids surrounding the cavity structure. Since the idealistic assumption of a constant solenoidal field along the cooling channel is broken by this approach, an iteration between beamdyA mics requirements and RF engineering feasibility is necessary to define an optimized structure. In this paper we describe the various cavity design options that have been considered up to now and we report on the preparation of a cavity test stand for a 88 MHz cavity. Geneva, Switzerland September 2001 1 FirstGeneration The high field strength (2 - 6 T) of the superconducting solenoids imposes the use of normalconducting technology for the RF cavities. To accommodate the large phase space of the muon beam a large acceptance is needed,y ielding low frequencies, high gradients, and a large <b>bore</b> <b>radius</b> (see Table 1). These contradicting requirements can only be fulfilled by accepting a relatively poor power e#ciency and bulky amplifiers with high peak power. A common feature of all presented designs is the avoidance of thin conducting windows, which could be used to straighten the field lines in the gap, but which would complicate the mechanical design as well as the beam dy namics of the muon beam. The first preliminary design approach tackled the problem of incorporating a superconducting solenoid into a cavity without substa [...] ...|$|E
