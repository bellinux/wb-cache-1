5|$|I heard {{dance and}} techno {{and was always}} {{interested}} in it but didn't really know where to go. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> to a club one night and saw that people were losing their mind to these dance tracks. It wasn't really that I wanted to mimic that sound. I just wanted to have that energy and have people going crazy. So I knew the fusion was putting R with trance.|$|E
5|$|I never {{warmed up}} ten, fifteen minutes {{before a game}} like most {{pitchers}} do. I'd loosen up, three, four minutes. Five at the outside. And I never went to the bullpen. Oh, I'd relieve all right, plenty of times, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> right from the bench to the box, and I'd take a few warm-up pitches and be ready. Then I had good control. I aimed to make the batter hit the ball, and I threw as few pitches as possible. That's why I was able to work every other day.|$|E
25|$|I {{said nothing}} to my brothers. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> {{immediately}} to the show and took my painting home in a taxi. It was really {{a turning point in}} my life, I can assure you. I saw that I would not be very much interested in groups after that.|$|E

6000|$|The way is {{long and}} cold and lone-- [...] <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>go!</b> [...] It leads where pines forever moan [...] Their weight of snow-- [...] <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>go!</b> [...] There are voices in the wind which call [...] There are shapes which beckon to the plain [...] I must journey where the peaks are tall, [...] And lonely herons clamor in the rain.|$|R
60|$|Monsieur, I am uneasy. <b>I</b> have foreboding. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>go.</b> What choice? We go in a taxi-cab to the Cats' House.|$|R
500|$|After {{a mysterious}} phone call, [...] politely {{asked me to}} stop {{training}} and get dressed. He 'insisted' that I accompany him downtown to {{what was supposed to}} be a commercial audition, [...] turned out to be an interview for The Wanderers. I thought acting was for sissies, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> anyway.|$|E
500|$|Conversely, The A.V. Club {{reviewer}} Myles McNutt {{gave the}} episode a C- rating and criticized the episode's lack of complexity. He wrote that, [...] "I would argue, though, that [...] {{part of the}} show’s problem right now" [...] and noted that Tate's performance was expanded [...] "little ... beyond her initial appearance last season." [...] In a review for the subsequent episode, [...] "After Hours", however, McNutt acknowledged that, [...] "If I'm being honest with , last week's probably should have been above a 'C-,' <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> with my gut and have to stand by that decision." ...|$|E
500|$|On December 16, 1956, American Broadcasting Company {{president}} Oliver E. Treyz announced Aubrey {{would immediately}} become the network's head of programming and talent. [...] ABC, the weakest {{of the three}} networks, was a perennial also-ran with a weak roster of affiliates and programs, something comparable to {{the early days of}} the Fox Network. Aubrey later said [...] "at that time, there was no ABC. The headquarters was an old riding stable. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> because [...] Leonard Goldenson in effect said, 'Look, I don't know that much about TV, I'm a lawyer.' And he let me have autonomy." ...|$|E

500|$|According to the Church of Scientology, [...] "even some {{fifty years}} later, those who sailed with Mr. Hubbard in 1932 would still speak of that voyage {{as the one}} grand {{adventure}} in the twilight of their youth." [...] Hubbard put it somewhat differently, writing in 1935 that the expedition [...] "was a crazy idea at best, and I knew it, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> ahead anyway, chartered a four-masted schooner and embarked with some fifty luckless souls who haven't stopped their cursings yet." [...] He told Look magazine in 1950 that the Caribbean Motion Picture Expedition [...] "was a two-bit expedition and financial bust, and I quit the ship at Puerto Rico in 1933." [...] The collapse of the expedition led a number of its members to make legal claims against Hubbard for refunds.|$|E
500|$|Hubbard {{blamed the}} expedition's {{problems}} on the captain: [...] "the ship's dour Captain Garfield proved himself far less than a Captain Courageous, requiring Ron Hubbard's hand at both the helm and the charts." [...] Specimens and photographs collected by the expedition are said by Scientology accounts to have been acquired by the University of Michigan, the U.S. Hydrographic Office, an unspecified national museum and the New York Times, though none of those institutions have any record of this. Hubbard later wrote that the expedition [...] "was a crazy idea at best, and I knew it, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> ahead anyway, chartered a four-masted schooner and embarked with some fifty luckless souls who haven't stopped their cursings yet." [...] He called it [...] "a two-bit expedition and financial bust", which resulted in some of its participants making legal claims against him for refunds.|$|E
2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of August, Ponor had a minor medical procedure to correct a congenital heart defect that was causing an arrhythmia {{and was able to}} resume training the same week.

2500|$|Of the {{incident}} Duchamp later recalled, [...] "I {{said nothing to}} my brothers. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> immediately to the show and took my painting home in a taxi. It was really {{a turning point in}} my life, I can assure you. I saw that I would not be very much interested in groups after that." [...] Yet Duchamp did appear in the illustrations to Du [...] "Cubisme", he participated in the La Maison Cubiste (Cubist House), organized by the designer André Mare for the Salon d'Automne of 1912 (a few months after the Indépendants); he signed the Section d'Or invitation and participated in the Section d'Or exhibition during the fall of 1912. The impression is, Brooke writes, [...] "it was precisely because he wished to remain part of the group that he withdrew the painting; and that, far from being ill treated by the group, he was given a rather privileged position, probably through the patronage of Picabia".|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} about Armageddon Sebastian spoke {{of how much}} The Memphis Album still influences his music, [...] "I headed across to Memphis and was very inspired by the music scene there. I got to work with some people who were instrumental in shaping the careers of artists who heavily influence me. Artists like Otis Redding, Sam & Dave and Sam Cooke. Being entrenched {{in that sort of}} environment really caused me to go 'You know what dude. Do what you want to do. Do what comes natural to you'." [...] Sebastian said it was a turning point for him, adding, [...] "From that Memphis thing a few years ago it's always going to start with me being true to who I want to be and what I enjoy singing." [...] Sebastian feels his soul roots remained even when he delved into electro dance music with the single [...] "Who's That Girl" [...] from his previous album, explaining it was an old school Sam Cooke type of melody, with modern lyrics, over a dance track. He said, [...] "I had that melody, and I could have gone so many ways with it. I could have produced an old-school soul song, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> towards what you hear on the radio." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{music videos}} {{presented}} by Skinny Puppy are often graphic and disturbing in nature, featuring heavy uses of blood, gore, and violence. It {{is because of}} this nature {{that the majority of}} the group's videos have received little commercial airplay, or have been banned outright. The music video for [...] "Stairs and Flowers" [...] was banned by the Canadian Censorship Bureau because of scenes depicting [...] "an excrement-covered woman being beaten by soldiers". The woman in question was in fact a mud soaked Nivek Ogre. The letterbox effect seen in the [...] "Dig It" [...] video was accused by the Bureau and as well as MuchMusic to be portraying pornography; the letterbox actually portrayed stock market footage. Also banned was the video for [...] "Testure", an action resulting from a poll held by CityTV, and the video for the song [...] "Worlock" [...] was banned from MTV. Ogre, a self-described horror fan, defended the [...] "Worlock" [...] video by saying [...] "I knew there was no way they'd play [...] "Worlock' there [...] <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> out to make that video so no one would play it!"; Ogre has affirmed that the video was meant to draw attention to censorship in horror films. Some of Skinny Puppy's music videos have received airplay, such as those for the promotional singles [...] "Killing Game" [...] and [...] "Pro-test"; [...] "Dig It" [...] was also occasionally played on MTV. A 30-second television promo was produced for the band by Capital Records in 1987, featuring a mix of scenes from the [...] "Stairs and Flowers" [...] and [...] "Dig It" [...] videos.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{very kind}} of you to ask me," [...] he said. [...] "Don't think me churlish, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> nowhere. <b>I</b> am trying to make up, you see, for my years of idleness." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You sing of {{the young}} gods easily [...] In the days when you are young; [...] <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> smelling yew and sods, [...] And I know there are gods behind the gods, [...] Gods that are best unsung.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not exactly cold," [...] replied Slaty, [...] "but a lot {{cooler than}} it is down here. <b>I</b> don't <b>go</b> as far north to nest as Snowflake does, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> far enough to be fairly comfortable. I don't see how some folks can stand hot weather." ...|$|R
2500|$|Upon {{his release}} from San Quentin in 1960, Haggard started digging ditches for his brother's {{electrical}} contracting company. Soon, he was performing again, and later began recording with Tally Records. The Bakersfield sound was developing in the area as a reaction against the overproduced honky tonk of the Nashville sound. Haggard's first record for Tally was [...] "Singing My Heart Out" [...] backed by [...] "Skid Row"; {{it was not a}} success, and only 200 copies were pressed. In 1962, Haggard wound up performing at a Wynn Stewart show in Las Vegas and heard Wynn's [...] "Sing a Sad Song." [...] He asked for permission to record it, and the resulting single was a national hit in 1964. The following year, he had his first national top-10 record with [...] "(My Friends Are Gonna Be) Strangers," [...] written by Liz Anderson, mother of country singer Lynn Anderson, and his career was off and running. Haggard recalls having been talked into visiting Anderson—a woman he did not know—at her house to hear her sing some songs she had written. [...] "If there was anything I didn't wanna do, it was sit around some danged woman's house and listen to her cute little songs. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> anyway. She was a pleasant enough lady, pretty, with a nice smile, but I was all set to be bored to death, even more so when she got out a whole bunch of songs and went over to an old pump organ.... There they were. My God, one hit right after another. There must have been four or five number one songs there...." ...|$|E
60|$|She gave a {{start and}} I felt her large eyes look at me, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> {{on with it}} and with my needlework.|$|E

6000|$|Jack {{read the}} letter and sighed bitterly. [...] "Well, I did take him for another guess sort of fine gentleman. Still, if my duty isn't his, it's mine all the same. I judge no man; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>go,</b> Mr. Cary." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Alas!" [...] {{said the}} preacher, [...] "I have no better earthly refuge {{for the present}} than these {{frowning}} towers, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> thither trusting to aid which is not of this earth--But thou, good youth, needest thou trust thyself in this dangerous den?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Macallister's Castilian was uncouth, but Miguel understood. [...] "It is not good, Don Pedro! A bad {{coast and}} a treacherous people, but {{one is not}} disturbed. Some of the saints were fishermen, and mine is king of all. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> to try the after well." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I {{lived in}} Ouray some time, {{and also in}} Silverton, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> here, there, and everywhere, {{prospecting}} and buying up old claims cheap." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should say}} so; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> toward the west, and after {{travelling}} until noon struck across this way, so {{have no idea}} of the distance." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> {{so far as}} {{this one}} day. I said, [...] "How would you like your {{soldiers}} to come alive, Gip, and march about by themselves?" ...|$|E
60|$|My only hope, you see, lay now in evasion, {{and it was}} {{for this}} that I was thus craftily preparing. Once out of Castile I could deal with Philip, and he should not find me as impotent, as toothless as he believed. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> too fast.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't suppose {{anything}} will do. We {{all know}} {{what happens to the}} child who cries for the top brick of the chimney. The child has to do without it. The child goes to bed and forgets it; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> to bed,--and can't forget it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I wonder is {{the mother}} over there waitin' fer me?" [...] he half whispered. [...] "If ye are, your soul will be {{floating}} far above me in the light, while I--burdened by me sins--must wallow below in purgatory. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>go,</b> and the divil take his toll." ...|$|R
