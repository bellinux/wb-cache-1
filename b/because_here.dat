In Hergé's revised edition, he adopts a more florid prose style: [...] "This is to tell you, oh highly esteemed friend, that I entrust to you Abdullah, my adored son. <b>Because</b> <b>here</b> the situation is serious. Should misfortune descend on me like the hawk on an innocent gazelle (for the world is made of life and death) I am sure that Abdullah will find you with warmth and affection, refuge and peace.

500|$|Marcel {{provided}} Warren with a filming slot on {{the wooded}} backlot of Shepperton Studios, {{located on the}} River Ash. Several scenes feature a bridge that had previously appeared in Dr. Terror's House of Horrors (1965). In addition, production designer Hayden Pearce secured {{the use of the}} manor house in Littleton Park (the studios' original site) to serve as the location of Jessica and Jo's country home. Of the filming arrangements, Warren comments: [...] "This really was quite a unique situation <b>because</b> ... <b>here</b> we were in a studio looking at a real house and real rooms as if shooting on location." [...] The crew were permitted to redecorate the rooms as necessary and, to this end, make use of any of the items in the studios' prop store. Warren states that this resulted in a [...] "crazy" [...] mixture of decors that [...] "certainly helped create the right atmosphere" [...] for the film.|$|E
500|$|The {{first of}} Britten's song cycles to gain {{widespread}} popularity was Les Illuminations (1940), for high voice (originally soprano, later more often sung by tenors) with string orchestra accompaniment, setting words by Arthur Rimbaud. Britten's music reflects the eroticism in Rimbaud's poems; Copland commented {{of the section}} [...] "Antique" [...] {{that he did not}} know how Britten dared to write the melody. [...] "Antique" [...] was dedicated to [...] "K.H.W.S.", or Wulff Scherchen, Britten's first romantic interest. Matthews judges the piece the crowning masterpiece of Britten's early years. By the time of Britten's next cycle, Seven Sonnets of Michelangelo (1942) for tenor and piano, Pears had become his partner and muse; in Matthews's phrase, Britten wrote the cycle as [...] "his declaration of love for Peter". It too finds the sensuality of the verses it sets, though in its structure it resembles a conventional 19th-century song cycle. Mason draws a distinction between this and Britten's earlier cycles, <b>because</b> <b>here</b> each song is self-contained, and has no thematic connection with any of the others.|$|E

2500|$|Heninghan critiques the book, {{claiming}} that it courts a European audience because the exoticism of Guatemala that {{conforms to the}} Parisian expectation. Therefore Henighan thinks that Leyendas de Guatemala is both genuine and fake; Asturias' accomplishment in creating the illusion of fiction was entirely stimulated by the perceived expectation of the French audience. According to such interpretations, the book is based in French Orientalist fantasies. However, Henighan claims that [...] "Leyendas de Guatemala deforms the Orientalist assumption <b>because</b> <b>here</b> the 'explorer' transmitting the magical world back to the Parisian readers is a native Guatemalan himself". He says that Asturias uses strategies to persuade the validity and trustworthiness of his writing to the European audience he targets; {{this is the reason}} he included pictures, the introductory preface by Paul Valéry, impersonal narration, and disclaimers such as 'that no one believes the legends of the past'.|$|E
2500|$|I am {{told that}} the more you rehearse, the better you play. This is wrong. We often try to reduce the {{unforeseen}} to a controllable level, to prevent a sudden impulse that escapes our ability to control, yet also responds to an obscure desire. Let's allow improvisation to have its place and play its role. I think that the true interpreter {{is the one who}} improvises. We have mechanized the art of conducting to an awful degree, in the quest of perfection rather than of dream [...] As soon as rubato is obtained and calculated scientifically, it ceases to be true. Music making is something else than searching to achieve an accomplishment. But striving to attain it is beautiful. Some of Michelangelo's sculptures are perfect, others are just outlined and the latter ones move me more than the first perfect ones <b>because</b> <b>here</b> I find the essence of desire, of the wakening dream. That's what really moves me: fixing without freezing in cement, allowing chance its opportunity.|$|E

Perfectly reasonable, you might think [...] but no! Our plucky hero Barry comes to her rescue, gently persuading her that she's just a little over-emotional and, phew – thank God he did, <b>because</b> <b>here</b> we are with a happy new family that might otherwise never have been. Dappy Natalie nearly screwed everything up.

2500|$|My Krazy Life {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 80, based on 16 reviews. Brandon Soderberg of Spin called the album [...] "a developed, knotty and, ultimately, deeply moral narrative," [...] {{comparing it to}} Kendrick Lamar's Good Kid, m.A.A.d City. Christopher R. Weingarten of Rolling Stone stated, [...] "A 46-minute tale of celebrations and regrets, the debut album from West Coast hot property YG is the most ambitious hip-hop concept LP in a minute." [...] Michael Madden of Consequence of Sound said, [...] "YG's Def Jam debut is earning comparisons to The Chronic for its swerving synth-wheeze and good kid, m.A.A.d City for its cinematic elements (skits, storylines, rapped dialogues). Neither is far off, <b>because</b> <b>here,</b> the gritty, prodigiously horny rapper from Compton has blown the ceiling off his once limited-sounding style." [...] Writing for Pitchfork, Craig Jenkins stated, [...] "It's a record that's always posted up in sunny SoCal, and whether it's serving up carefree party anthems or dispensing crass advice on whose houses to knock over and what to take, L.A. feels like {{the capital of the}} country when it’s playing." [...] David Jeffries of AllMusic said, [...] "The album's secret weapon is DJ Mustard who offers numerous productions that are pop like Young Money and bottom-heavy with G-Funk as the blueprint. Think of 50 Cent's Get Rich or Die Tryin delivered by an inspired rapper in a post-Nicki Minaj world and you're close to the thrill of this inspired debut." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sound {{design for}} the film was handled by Martín Hernández, {{who has worked on}} all the director's feature films. The {{production}} sound his team was given was [...] "surprisingly perfect and clean", so they didn't need to spend much time tidying it. The lack of visual cuts in the film meant a departure from the usual way Hernández edited sound though. [...] "Normally Alejandro likes, as he calls it, 'the clashing of the sounds.' The camera changes angle within the scene and there is a change of everything backgrounds, texture, dialog. Obviously, that would not work on Birdman <b>because</b> <b>here,</b> everything is flowing." [...] Additionally, the sound of objects in the film needed to be coordinated with their position onscreen, a non-trivial task since the camera was nearly always moving. Hernández also helped to cut Sánchez's tracks, selecting and editing moments from the New York recordings against the film. When the tracks were re-recording in Los Angeles, in order [...] "to have distance, and closeness and resonance" [...] the team used thirty two microphones for each take. Hernández described the job as [...] "crazy". A large challenge of the post-production soundwork was designing the sound of the theatre audience, particularly in the scene when Mike is drunk and comes out of character. Iñárritu knew how he wanted the audience to respond, but figuring out the sound of their reaction took four months of work from five sound designers. Hernández said he thought, for a film in general, that the narrative created by sound [...] "provokes more 'explosions'" [...] than that created by images, and that in Birdman [...] "Alejandro has sound exploding all throughout the film." ...|$|E
