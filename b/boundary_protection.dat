In the proposed scheme, the equivalent resonance component with a certain central frequency is sleeve-mounted {{at the beginning of}} protected zone. The ‘Line Boundary ’ is built by using boundary effect, which is created by introducing impedance in the primary-side of line. The ‘Line Boundary ’ is significantly different from line wave impedance. Therefore, the <b>boundary</b> <b>protection</b> principle can be applied to power distribution line without line traps. To analyze the frequency characteristic corresponding to traveling-waves of introducing impedance in the primary-side of line, distributed parameters model of equivalent resonance component is established.

40|$|Current fight {{boundary}} of the envelope protection in icing conditions is usually defined by the critical values of state parameters; however, such method does not take the interrelationship of each parameter {{and the effect of}} the external disturbance into consideration. This paper proposes constructing the stability {{boundary of}} the aircraft in icing conditions through analyzing the region of attraction (ROA) around the equilibrium point. Nonlinear icing effect model is proposed according to existing wind tunnel test results. On this basis, the iced polynomial short period model can be deduced further to obtain the stability boundary under icing conditions using ROA analysis. Simulation results for a series of icing severity demonstrate that, regardless of the icing severity, the {{boundary of the}} calculated ROA can be treated as an estimation of the stability boundary around an equilibrium point.

40|$|Abstract — The main {{objectives}} of transmission line protection scheme are precisely differentiate the faults zone and indicate exact fault type using one end data only {{so that only}} faulted line will be removed. Fault generates transient current wave contained distinct frequency bands. In this paper discrete wavelet transform is used to capture two bands of frequencies from the transient current signal using db 1 as a mother wavelet. The spectral energies of these two bands are obtained to determine the fault zone. The faulted phase selection {{is done by the}} discrete wavelet transform using Haar as the mother wavelet. The coefficient of a frequency band in the range of 1 KHz- 3 KHz are obtained for the three phase and ground currents. The average value of the coefficients of each current wave is then computed and used to classify the faulted phase. Fault simulations are performed using MATLAB/Simulink and then the results are interfaced to MATLAB where the algorithm is implemented.

40|$|Programs {{written in}} the C {{language}} often suffer from nasty errors due to dangling pointers and buffer overflow. Such errors in Internet server programs are often exploited by malicious attackers to “crack ” an entire system, and {{this has become a}} problem affecting society as a whole. The root of these errors is usually corruption of on-memory data structures caused by out-of-bound array accesses. The C language does not provide any protection against such out-of-bound access, although recent languages such as Java, C#, Lisp and ML provide such protection. Nevertheless, the C language itself should not be blamed for this shortcoming—it was designed to provide a replacement for assembly languages (i. e., to provide flexible direct memory access through a light-weight high-level language). In other words, lack of array <b>boundary</b> <b>protection</b> is “by design. ” In addition, the C language was designed more than thirty years ago when there was not enough computer power to perform a memory boundary check for every memory access.

Yet the prevailing approach {{to the study of}} ethnocentrism, ingroup bias, and prejudice presumes that ingroup love and outgroup hate are reciprocally related. Findings from both cross-cultural research and laboratory experiments support the alternative view that ingroup identification is independent of negative attitudes toward outgoups and that much ingroup bias and intergroup discrimination is motivated by preferential treatment of ingroup members rather than direct hostility toward outgroup members.

40|$|Abstract — Two of {{the most}} {{expected}} objectives of transmission line protection are: a) differentiating precisely the internal faults from external, and b) indicating exactly the fault type using one end data only. This paper proposes an improved solution based on wavelet transform and self-organized neural network. The measured voltage and current signals are preprocessed first and then decomposed using wavelet multi-resolution analysis to obtain the high frequency details and low frequency approximations. The patterns formed based on high frequency signal components are arranged as inputs of neural network # 1, whose task is to indicate whether the fault is internal or external. The patterns formed using low frequency approximations are arranged as inputs of neural network # 2, whose task is to indicate the exact fault type. The new method uses both low and high frequency information of the fault signal to achieve an advanced line protection scheme. The proposed approach is verified using frequency-dependent transmission line model and the test results prove its enhanced performance. A discussion of the application issues for the proposed approach is provided at the end where the generality of the proposed approach and guidance for future study are pointed out.

In this way corporates improved productivity, employee retention, flexible work environment, IT value-added to business and reduced running costs.

40|$|Identity {{studies of}} {{immigrants}} are complex because of multiple influences affecting identity reconstruction during immigration and acculturation: nationality, socio-cultural differences, occupations, education, spatial and geographic locations, age, gender, and personal attributes. Most immigrant identity studies deal with lower-income immigrants, {{who do not}} have the resources of middle- and upper-middle-class immigrants. South Florida is “home” to many middle-class immigrants, including Dominican-Americans. This dissertation interviewed sixty-six Dominican immigrants in South Florida, in order to determine their reconstructed identities after immigration/resettlement and to discover what influences contributed to these changes in identities. ^ The research design of this dissertation utilized an inductive, qualitative model, with the “grounded theory” method of data collection, categorization, and analysis. Participants were selected by a snowball sampling and interviewed with an informal questionnaire. Results were transcribed, categorized, tabulated, and analyzed for conclusions and theorization on immigrant identity. ^ The dissertation addressed numerous influences relating to identity reconstruction: the differing circumstances of immigration, the unique resources of middle- and higher-class immigrants, the nurturing environment of South Florida for immigrants with education and professional skills, and the <b>boundary</b> <b>protection</b> offered by suburban spaces. The interviewees displayed a wide range of age, length of residence in the United States, reasons for immigration, entry ports, settlement, relocations, occupations, and claimed identities. Identity was cross-tabulated with the various influences, as a means of invalidating certain influences and indicating possible trends. ^ The dissertation concluded that middle-class immigrant identities are diverse and multiple, as are the related influences. None of these immigrants had become totally assimilated, nor have they retained dual, non-overlapping attachments or frames of reference. Instead, many of the immigrants seemed to have developed or negotiated two or more identities, according to need, context, and personal interest. A cosmopolitan community such as South Florida seems to have encouraged such multiplicity of identity. However, rather than forming free-flowing identities, most of these immigrants eventually developed diverse and hybrid identities that have bounded attachments to various networks, groups, and places in South Florida. ...|$|E

Splitting object-oriented hierarchies across <b>protection</b> <b>boundaries</b> is particularly attractive for the purposes of providing a uniform programming model to objectoriented applications and for implementing a minimal object-oriented kernel.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} studied new {{transmission line}} fault diagnosis approaches using {{new technologies and}} proposed a scheme to apply those techniques in preventing and mitigating cascading blackouts. The new fault diagnosis approaches are based on two time-domain techniques: neural network based, and synchronized sampling based. For a neural network based fault diagnosis approach, a specially designed fuzzy Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART) neural network algorithm was used. Several ap- plication issues were solved by coordinating multiple neural networks and improving the feature extraction method. A new <b>boundary</b> <b>protection</b> scheme was designed by using a wavelet transform and fuzzy ART neural network. By extracting the fault gen- erated high frequency signal, the new scheme can solve {{the difficulty of the}} traditional method to differentiate the internal faults from the external using one end transmis- sion line data only. The fault diagnosis based on synchronized sampling utilizes the Global Positioning System of satellites to synchronize data samples from the two ends of the transmission line. The effort has been made to extend the fault location scheme to a complete fault detection, classification and location scheme. Without an extra data requirement, the new approach enhances the functions of fault diagnosis and improves the performance. Two fault diagnosis techniques using neural network and synchronized sampling are combined as an integrated real time fault analysis tool {{to be used as a}} reference of traditional protective relay. They work with an event analysis tool based on event tree analysis (ETA) in a proposed local relay monitoring tool. An interactive monitoring and control scheme for preventing and mitigating cascading blackouts is proposed. The local relay monitoring tool was coordinated with the system-wide monitoring and control tool to enable a better understanding of the system disturbances. Case studies were presented to demonstrate the proposed scheme. An improved simulation software using MATLAB and EMTP/ATP was devel- oped to study the proposed fault diagnosis techniques. Comprehensive performance studies were implemented and the test results validated the enhanced performance of the proposed approaches over the traditional fault diagnosis performed by the transmission line distance relay...|$|E
