The TV Company argued that Ecclestone and Mosley were in breach of commercial clauses in the Treaty of Rome; following the court's decision Mosley appealed the judgement and cancelled the series until further notice. On appeal, the court ruled that the series organiser should <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> the television rights to whoever they felt was the best option for coverage and the FIA reinstated the European Truck Racing Cup.|$|E
5|$|The 1894-S Barber dime {{is one of}} {{the great}} numismatic rarities, with a {{published}} mintage of 24 proof pieces. Various stories attend the question of how so few came to be coined. According to Nancy Oliver and Richard Kelly in their 2011 article for The Numismatist, the San Francisco Mint in June 1894 needed to coin $2.40 in silver left over from the melting of worn-out coins, just enough to coin 24 dimes. More ten-cent pieces were expected to be struck there later in the year, but this did not occur. Breen, on the other hand, related that San Francisco Mint Superintendent John Daggett had the dimes struck for a group of banker friends, giving three to each. He also gave three to his young daughter Hallie, telling her to retain them until she was as old as he was, and she would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> them for a good price. According to the story, she spent one on a dish of ice cream, but kept the other two until 1954. One of the approximately nine known dimes was retrieved from circulation in 1957, and Breen speculated this may have been the ice cream specimen. One sold for $1,552,500 at auction in 2007.|$|E

Unfortunately, the catacombs were not a success and only about 500 of the many thousands of places in them were sold. The Metropolitan Interments Act 1850 gave the government powers to purchase commercial cemeteries.

Despite having talented younger wrestlers like Chris Jericho, Chris Benoit, Dean Malenko, Billy Kidman, Chavo Guerrero, Jr., Eddie Guerrero, Perry Saturn, Raven, Booker T., and Rey Mysterio, Jr. on its roster, they were kept away from the main event scene. Of these wrestlers listed, five {{would go on to}} headline main events in WWF/E and become World Champions (Both Eddie Guerrero and Booker T have also since been inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame for their in-ring achievements), something WCW bookers believed these men would never <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> as.|$|E
25|$|Influenced {{by events}} in the United States, the {{government}} of Sir William Hearst introduced prohibition of alcoholic drinks in 1916 {{with the passing of}} the Ontario Temperance Act. However, residents could distill and retain their own personal supply, and liquor producers could continue distillation and export for sale, allowing this already sizeable industry to strengthen further. Ontario became a hotbed for the illegal smuggling of liquor and the biggest supplier into the United States, which was under complete prohibition. Prohibition in Ontario came to an end in 1927 with the establishment of the Liquor Control Board of Ontario under the government of Howard Ferguson. The sale and consumption of liquor, wine, and beer are still controlled by some of the most extreme laws in North America to ensure that strict community standards and revenue generation from the alcohol retail monopoly are upheld. In April 2007, Ontario Member of Provincial Parliament Kim Craitor suggested that local brewers should <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> their beer in local corner stores; however, the motion was quickly rejected by Premier Dalton McGuinty.|$|E

25|$|While a {{large number}} of Dvořák's works were given opus numbers, these did not always bear a logical {{relationship}} to the order in which they were either written or published. To achieve better sales, some publishers such as N. Simrock preferred to present budding composers as being well established, by giving some relatively early works much higher opus numbers than their chronological order would merit. In other cases, Dvořák deliberately provided new works with lower opus numbers to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> them outside contract obligations to other publishers. An example is the Czech Suite which Dvořák didn't want to sell to Simrock, and had published with Schlesinger as Op. 39 instead of Op. 52. In this way it could come about that the same opus number was given to more than one of Dvořák's works; for example the opus number 12, which was assigned, successively, to: the opera King and Charcoal Burner (1871), the Concert Overture in F (1871, derived from the opera), the String Quartet No. 6 in A minor (1873), the Furiant in G minor for piano (1879), and the Dumka in C minor for piano (1884). In yet other cases, a work was given as many as three different opus numbers by different publishers.|$|E

No one since would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> pollution as the necessary underside of progress so easily or uncritically." [...] Carson's work, and the activism it inspired, are at least partly responsible for the deep ecology movement, and the overall strength of the grassroots environmental movement since the 1960s. It was also influential on the rise of ecofeminism and on many feminist scientists.|$|E

500|$|Illinois Representative Chauncey Reed had {{introduced}} the Elgin coin legislation at Rovelstad's behest, {{and both the}} sculptor and Hoffecker worked with him to advance the bill through Congress. [...] In February 1936, Hoffecker, who had been appointed by ANA President T. James Clarke to lead a committee against abuses in the issuance of commemorative coins, went to Washington, passing through Chicago {{on his way to}} visit Rovelstad. [...] The two men had hoped to keep the mintage to 10,000, to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> the coins at a higher price. [...] Congress, however, was not minded to create a low-mintage commemorative, as there had been several issues which had been struck in small numbers only to sell at high prices, and the bill was amended to provide for 25,000 half dollars. Hoffecker hoped to lower the number, urging the sculptor to lobby for a decrease. [...] Hoffecker noted it would be much more work to sell 25,000, and they could not command as high a price. There were a large number of commemorative coin bills in Congress in 1936, and the dealer feared that President Franklin D. Roosevelt would start vetoing them. [...] Hoffecker visited Washington twice more in May, once meeting Rovelstad there, where they lobbied members of Congress.|$|E
500|$|Development of the Nintendo DSi {{started at}} the end of 2006. It was the first time Masato Kuwahara of Nintendo's Development Engineering Department served as a {{hardware}} project leader. Work went at a quick pace to meet deadlines; his team had to devise a theme for the new DS in time for a late December presentation, and by February 2007, most specifications for a chipset had to be completed. Kuwahara reported that his team had difficulty determining the potential market for the handheld during the design process; he said of their goal, [...] "We have to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> the console on its own [...] It also {{has to be able to}} meld into the already-existing DS market." [...] The console's digital cameras were considered early in development: Nintendo president and Chief Executive Officer Satoru Iwata described the touchscreen as the Nintendo DS's sense of touch, and the microphone as its [...] "ears"; a co-worker suggested that it should have [...] "eyes". Kuwahara's team originally wanted one camera with a swivel mechanism, but this was abandoned due to concerns of reliability, cost, and the need of a thicker console. Owing to consumer demand, Nintendo also improved the handhelds' volume and audio quality and made it slimmer with larger screens compared to the Nintendo DS Lite. However, to improve portability without sacrificing durability, the GBA cartridge slot present on earlier models was removed. To compensate, Nintendo continued to support the DS Lite as long as there was consumer demand for it.|$|E

500|$|In 2007, the Australian {{government}} decided to retire {{all of the}} F-111s by 2010, and acquire 24 F/A-18F Super Hornets as an interim replacement, pending {{the arrival of the}} F-35 LightningII JSF then under development. The F-111 fleet was considered to be at risk owing to fatigue issues, and too expensive to operate as each aircraft required 180 hours of maintenance for every hour of flying time. No.82 Wing began re-equipping with the Super Hornet in 2010, and the last F-111s were retired on 3December that year. FACDU was combined with the RAAF Special Tactics Project in July 2009 to form No.4 Squadron. The following year, No.82 Wing became home to No.5 Flight, which was responsible for training personnel to operate the RAAF's two IAI Heron unmanned aerial vehicles based at Kandahar in Afghanistan. The Air Force acquired a third Heron in 2011, based in Australia and operated by No.5 Flight. As of that year, the F-35 was not expected to enter Australian service until 2018. The RAAF hoped to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> off its Super Hornets [...] "with very low kilometres on the clock" [...] by 2020, but this would depend on delivery of the replacement F-35s. In April 2013, No.5 Flight was transferred from No.82 Wing to Surveillance and Response Group's No.92 Wing. The following month, the Federal government announced plans to purchase twelve Boeing EA-18G Growlers to supplement the Super Hornet fleet. No.6 Squadron is expected to begin taking delivery of the Growlers in 2017, at which point its Super Hornets will be transferred to No.1 Squadron.|$|E
