It would always have been important to know the names of poisonous and edible plants and animals in order to communicate this information to other members of the family or group. Medicinal plant illustrations show up in Egyptian wall paintings from c. 1500 BC, indicating that the uses of different species were understood and that a basic taxonomy was in place.|$|E
5|$|The European {{debt crisis}} (often also {{referred}} to as the Eurozone crisis or the European sovereign debt crisis) is a multi-year debt crisis that has <b>been</b> <b>taking</b> <b>place</b> in the European Union since the end of 2009. Several eurozone member states (Greece, Portugal, Ireland, Spain and Cyprus) were unable to repay or refinance their government debt or to bail out over-indebted banks under their national supervision without the assistance of third parties like other Eurozone countries, the European Central Bank (ECB), or the International Monetary Fund (IMF).|$|E

5|$|In March 1864, Dixon {{accompanied}} Kentucky Governor Thomas E. Bramlette and John Marshall Harlan, the state's attorney general, to {{an audience}} with President Lincoln to protest the recruitment of blacks {{into the ranks of}} the Union Army. The governor eventually agreed to allow the practice, but only when whites failed to meet their draft quotas. Since recruitment of blacks had <b>been</b> <b>taking</b> <b>place</b> in the Commonwealth for more than two months already, the concession {{was little more than a}} face-saving gesture by Bramlette. Following the end of the Civil War, Dixon retired from public life. He died in Henderson on April 23, 1876, and is buried in Fernwood Cemetery.|$|E
5|$|To {{rebuild the}} damaged {{parts of the}} site, the {{relevant}} approval from Dacorum Borough Council would be needed. The BP section of the site {{is a good way}} from the explosion and survived with very little damage, but it was inoperative as of 2009. BP is exploring plans for the future use of this part of the site, and has indicated a number of priorities, including the reopening of the fuel pipelines to Heathrow. It is considering using its section to store aviation fuel and as a distribution centre for motor fuel, but at a much-reduced level. In late 2009, Total UK submitted plans for the reconstruction of the oil depot. The reconstruction of the site has <b>been</b> <b>taking</b> <b>place</b> since March 2013.|$|E
5|$|To {{suggest that}} the BBC, forming opinion {{in the minds of}} the people of England, has been an {{influence}} for good in any way, when you consider the criminality of large areas of London; when you consider the Mods and Rockers, and all those other things; when you consider the total moral underminings which have <b>been</b> <b>taking</b> <b>place</b> in England, much to all our distress, in the last fifteen to twenty years, the Hon.

5|$|As {{sovereign}} of Madagascar, Ranavalona III {{became a}} pawn in the endgame of the maneuvering that had <b>been</b> <b>taking</b> <b>place</b> between the British and French {{since the beginning}} of the century. The tension between France and Madagascar had grown especially acute in the three years prior to Ranavalona's succession, with an intensification of attacks in the months prior to her coronation. In February 1883 the northwestern coast was bombarded, followed by the occupation of Mahajanga by the French in May, and bombardment and capture of Toamasina in June. Attacks along the northern coast were ongoing at the time Ranavalona III was crowned in the summer of 1883. Shortly after the French initiated this latest round of hostilities, Prime Minister Rainilaiarivony decided to engage Lieutenant Colonel Digby Willoughby, a Briton who had gained combat experience in the Anglo-Zulu War (but without having been a member of the British armed forces), to oversee the nation's military affairs and train the queen's army to defend the island against the seemingly inevitable French invasion.|$|E
