It is a [...] fuel cell <b>battery</b> <b>vehicle</b> {{that is designed}} halfway between a twenty-first century automobile and an ordinary gasoline fire engine. The front part carries two firemen, and the rear is a large water-tank with a ladder on top. The state-of-the-art vehicle makes its own hydrogen and oxygen needed to supply the fuel cell battery that operates the vehicle, water pump, smoke extractors, and electronic equipment.|$|E
50|$|The 30К6Е {{control system}} can be {{integrated}} with the S-400 Triumph 98ZH6E system; the S-300PMU2 (through the 83М6Е2 control system); the S-300PMU1 (through the 83М6Е control system); the Tor-M1 through the Ranzhir-M battery-command post; the Pantsir-S1 through the lead <b>battery</b> <b>vehicle.</b> The Protivnik-GE and Gamma-DE radars, integrated with the 92H6E radar system, enables communication between each battery with Baikal-E senior command posts and similar types; nearby 30К6Е, 83М6Е and 83М6Е2 administration systems; the Polyana-D4М1 command post; fighter-aircraft command post, and mobile long-range radars. The Nebo-M system is designed to hunt the F-35 joint-strike fighter. The system's VHF component provides sector search and tracking, with the X- and L-band components providing fine-tracking capability. Good placement of the radars relative to the threat axis enables the L- and X-band components to illuminate the incoming target from angles where the target RCS is sub-optimal. Attempts to jam the Nebo-M would be problematic, since all the radars have passive angle track capability against jammers; jamming permits passive triangulation of the target using three angle-track outputs. The RLM-S and RLM-D have better elevation-tracking accuracy than the RLM-M, and the Nebo M should be capable of producing high-quality tracks suitable for mid-course guidance of modern surface-to-air missiles and trajectory guidance of legacy SAMs.|$|E

The two largest renewable sources {{likely to be}} widely used in the near future, photovoltaic (PV) and wind turbines, are both intermittent (Kelly & Weinberg 1993). Intermittency can be managed either by backup or storage. In terms of V 2 G, backup can be provided by the fueled vehicles (fuel cell and hybrid running motor-generator).

40|$|Abstract—Vehicle-to-grid (V 2 G) {{networks}} are important com-ponents of the smart grid (SG) for their capability of providing better ancillary services and facilitating {{the adoption of}} renewable resources. The operation of the V 2 G networks is based on con-tinuously monitoring the status of individual <b>battery</b> <b>vehicle</b> (BV) {{as well as a}} carefully designed incentive scheme to attract suffi-cient participating BVs. However, the close monitoring tends to raise privacy concerns from the BV owners about identity and loca-tion information leakage, which have not been considered in pre-vious works. In this paper, we make the first attempt to identify the privacy-preserving issues and propose a precise reward scheme in V 2 G networks, both of which are important towards bringing the concept of V 2 G network into practice. In V 2 G networks, it is the service providers (individual BVs) who need privacy protec-tion rather than the service consumer (power grid). This unique characteristic renders privacy protection solutions proposed for conventional network systems not directly applicable. To protect privacy of BVs in V 2 G networks, we present, a secure commu-nication architecture which achieves privacy-preserving for both BVs ’ monitoring and rewarding processes. Extensive performance analysis shows that only incurs moderate communication and computational overheads. Index Terms—Secure communication, smart grid, V 2 G net-works. I...|$|E

Also, all the used nowadays testing cycles were designed for internal combustion engine vehicles and take into account not only energy and mechanical aspects, but also pollution and internal combustion engine characteristics. The paper presents a collection of sample signals developed to explore and simulate multiple system impacts to emulate different reference and load conditions. The study describes the major driving modes, such as the constant-speed cruising, speeding up and braking, typical parking regimes, uphill and downhill motion, and taking a turn. The developed testing equipment and software are described. Responses of the <b>battery</b> <b>vehicle</b> drives to the changeable controls and disturbances were studied in the laboratory test bench. The set of test cycles prepared in the frame of the ABB control arrangement was applied to the system evaluation and assessment. The developed methodology can be recommended to adjust the electric drives for different kinds of testing equipment. Experimental validation of the described approach has demonstrated the broad possibilities for the steady-state and transient modes of vehicle quality evaluation. It suits for recommendations that can be made with regard to the tuning of the drive regulators, control looping, sensor allocation, and feedback arrangements...|$|E
40|$|In this study, electric-drive {{vehicles}} with series powertrains were configured to utilize a lithium-ion battery with very high power and achieve sport-sedan performance and excellent fuel economy. The battery electrode materials are LiMn 2 O 4 and Li 4 Ti 5 O 12, which provide a cell area-specific impedance of about 40 % of {{that of the}} commonly available lithium-ion batteries. Data provided by EnerDel Corp. for this system demonstrate this low impedance and also a long cycle life at 55 oC. All the batteries for these vehicles were designed to deliver 100 kW of power at 90 % open-circuit voltage to provide high battery efficiency (97 – 98 %) during vehicle operation. This heats the battery by only 1. 8 oC per hour of travel on the urban dynamometer driving schedule (UDDS) cycle, which essentially {{eliminates the need for}} battery cooling. Three vehicles were designed, each with series powertrains and simulation test weights between 1, 575 and 1, 633 kg: a hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) with a 45 -kg battery, a plug-in HEV (PHEV) 10 with a 60 -kg battery, and a PHEV 20 with a 100 -kg <b>battery.</b> <b>Vehicle</b> simulation tests on Argonne National Laboratory’s simulation software, the Powertrain System Analysis Toolkit (PSAT), which was developed with MATLAB/Simulink, showed that these vehicles could accelerate to 60 miles per hour in 6. 2 to 6. 3 seconds and achieve fuel economies of 50 to 54 miles per gallon on the UDDS and highway fuel economy test (HWFET) cycles. This type of vehicle shows promise of having a moderate cost if it is mass produced because there is no transmission, the engine and generator may be less expensive since they are designed to operate at only one speed, and the battery electrode materials are inexpensive...|$|E
40|$|The HyLite Project is a {{joint project}} of 10 {{supplier}} companies and the German Aerospace Center (DLR) to develop a fuel cell powered vehicle, wich shall serve as a "technology carrier". The majority of companies develops advanced components for the fuel cell system comprising essential components of air supply subsytem (e. g. advanced air compressor), heat and water management, hydrogen supply system and the control system. Some companies support DLR in the system integration. The basic vehicle for {{the integration of the}} PEM fuel cell system is a battery car, wich was produced by a German manufacturer in a small scale production of nearly 150 vehicles. One objective of the project was to replace the battery pack of that base vehicle by an electrical power generation system with a fuel cell system. As basis {{for the development of the}} power supply system the <b>battery</b> <b>vehicle</b> has been characterized in a condensed measuring campaign. The paper reports about the results of the vehicle characterization, e. g. driving resistance parameters, performance curves and as well as NEDC characteristics. Based on the findings of the vehicle characterization it was decided to apply a hybrid fuel cell system, whereby the power distribution between battery and fuel cell system is realized by means of a bidirectional DC/DC converter. Further, the paper describes the layout of the fuel cell power unit and gives details about components - especially the fuel cell system. The vehicle management unit, wich handles the overall vehicle control, and the energy managment unit, wich controls fuel cell system and battery, are explained in detail.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} include improvement of {{the efficiency of the}} aluminum/air battery system and demonstration of its ability for vehicle applications. The aluminum/air battery system can generate enough energy and power for driving ranges and acceleration similar to that of gasoline powered cars. Therefore {{has the potential to be}} a power source for electrical vehicles. ^ Aluminum/air <b>battery</b> <b>vehicle</b> life cycle analysis was conducted and compared to that of lead/acid and nickel-metal hydride vehicles. Only the aluminum/air vehicles can be projected to have a travel range comparable to that of internal combustion engine vehicles (ICE). From this analysis, an aluminum/air vehicle is a promising candidate compared to ICE vehicles in terms of travel range, purchase price, fuel cost, and life cycle cost. ^ We have chosen two grades of Al alloys (Al alloy 1350, 99. 5 % and Al alloy 1199, 99. 99 %) in our study. Only Al 1199 was studied extensively using Na 2 SnO 3 as an electrolyte additive. We then varied concentration and temperature, and determined the effects on the parasitic (corrosion) current density and open circuit potential. We also determined cell performance and selectivity curves. To optimize the performance of the cell based on our experiments, the recommended operating conditions are: 3 – 4 N NaOH, about 55 °C, and a current density of 150 – 300 mA/cm 2. ^ We have modeled the cell performance using the equations we developed. The model prediction of cell performance shows good agreement with experimental data. For better cell performance, our model studies suggest use of higher electrolyte flow rate, smaller cell gap, higher conductivity and lower parasitic current density. ^ We have analyzed the secondary current density distributions in a two plane, parallel Al/air cell and a wedge-type Al/air cell. The activity of the cathode has a large effect on the local current density. With increases in the cell gap, the local current density increases, but the increase is not as significant as the increase in the current density away from the entrance. By extending the cathode below the anode, the high local current density can be reduced. ...|$|E
40|$|This report {{presents}} {{the results of the study}} on the implementation of an In-Wheel Motor (IWM) propulsion system and the design of a rear suspension for such a system for a Volkswagen Lupo. Previous research has been conducted at the Eindhoven University of Technology on the impact of in-wheel motors on the ride comfort of electric cars. The study shows that addition of unsprung mass reduces ride comfort and can increase suspension travel and dynamic wheel loads. But additional sprung mass, due to batteries in an electric vehicle in fact improves ride comfort. The study also concluded that improvements to the suspension system can mitigate the issues caused by unsprung mass. Designing and implementing the IWM propulsion system in an already existing ICE vehicle like the VW Lupo 3 L would need further study with respect to the suspension design and its kinematics. The University is currently converting a VW Lupo diesel to a <b>battery</b> <b>vehicle</b> which uses a conventional front wheel drive system, i. e. a centrally mounted motor powers the wheels via drive shafts and a single reduction gear. It is called the Lupo EL, with EL being the abbreviation for Electric Lightweight. The technical specifications of several electric cars are studied to get an idea of the common design solutions of several manufacturers, especially in the area of battery capacity and motor specifications. These specifications, including others such as the vehicle mass and range gives an idea of where the Lupo EL stands in comparison to the electric vehicles on the market today. In order to design an IWM propulsion system for a car, the application of the car has to be understood. Based on the application, a set of performance requirements for the car are formulated. The electric motor specifications are then calculated for these requirements. Since the University is already working on converting a ICE VW Lupo 3 L, the specifications of the Lupo EL are used to make a first estimation of the range that the IWM propelled car can achieve. The car will be called the Lupo EL 2, with the two in-wheel motors at the rear. Furthermore, the design and layout of the Lupo EL’s battery compartment and rear suspension is described in this report. The current suspension system is not a feasible solution for the Lupo EL 2. Initial simulation results of a SimMechanics multibody model of the Lupo EL 2 shows that the car would lift considerably while accelerating forward. Also, assembling the IWM’s in this current configuration is found to be difficult. Hence,a new battery box design and several rear suspension designs have been proposed. The proposed designs are only preliminary and further simulations will have to be conducted...|$|E

40|$|The {{transportation}} {{sector is}} responsible {{for a quarter of}} all greenhouse gas emissions in Europe. Though the transport system may be difficult to change into a less polluting system, electric vehicles may be a possible approach. For personal use, there are today different models of <b>battery</b> electric <b>vehicles,</b> and plug-in hybrid electric <b>vehicles</b> available. Though <b>battery</b> electric <b>vehicles</b> have the bigger potential for reducing emissions, they also have the biggest hurdle in terms of range limitation and investment cost. In this thesis we have assessed <b>battery</b> electric <b>vehicles</b> performance as replacements for conventional cars using GPS-based driving pattern analysis. We have found that for common <b>battery</b> electric <b>vehicle</b> ranges of 120 km, a noteworthy adaptation is required for the average user. However, it is possible to specifically adopt <b>battery</b> electric <b>vehicles</b> within multi-car households to significantly reduce the need for adaptation. When applying a cost, resembling that of a rental car, for the days that the <b>battery</b> electric <b>vehicle</b> cannot fulfill the driving need of the user, close to 14 % of the second cars in multi-car households would have a lower total cost of ownership as a <b>battery</b> electric <b>vehicle</b> compared to a conventional car in Sweden. We have also assessed the degree of adaptation in a small set of Swedish two-car households who adopted a <b>battery</b> electric <b>vehicle</b> for 3 - 4 months. Though the data set is small, it displays a large degree of heterogeneity in behavior, with some households increasing the use of the <b>battery</b> electric <b>vehicle</b> compared to the replaced car, while some decrease it, and others make virtually no change in travel behavior. Overall, we do not see a large increase in driving of the <b>battery</b> electric <b>vehicle</b> compared to the replaced car. We have also done methodological development by analyzing the effect of modelling driving data with three probability distributions. Contrary to earlier literature we find that the Weibull and Log-Normal distributions overall fit driving data better than the Gamma distribution. Additionally, for electric vehicles there are specific applications that are interesting, for battery electric vehicles: estimating the frequency of long-distance driving above the range limitation; and for plug-in hybrids, estimating the frequency of short-distance driving that may give rise to a high electric drive fraction. With regards to these applications, we find that the distributions systematically give different estimates, and that a researcher may choose distribution according to the chosen research question. Finally, we have analyzed the usage of fast charging infra-structure in Sweden to support assumptions made for a queueing model of charging infra-structure usage developed at Fraunhofer ISI, in Karlsruhe, Germany...|$|R
