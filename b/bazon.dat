50|$|The public artwork {{began on}} 1 January 2010 and ended December 31 {{of the same}} year. During this time, over 1,300 visitors, in the {{tradition}} of <b>Bazon</b> Brock’s visitors’ school at documenta 4 (1968), spent time in the streets as art. The “visitors’ school in 2-3 streets”, turned the reality of everyday life on the streets into an aesthetic experience. Sociologists, cultural scientists and town planners undertook scientific studies, and the media threw an additional light on what were otherwise marginal and often problematic districts with a high percentage of migrant unemployment. New public spheres were created, allowing each street to develop a new image of itself. While year after year, the cities of the Ruhr continue to shrink, over half of the participants of “2-3 Streets” decided {{at the end of the}} artwork to continue living in their streets as new residents of the region.|$|E
5000|$|Brock {{was born}} in Stolp, Pomerania, now in Poland. His father, a historian, was {{executed}} by the Soviets for collaborating with Hitler. The family fled to Denmark. After two years of internment, they settled in Itzehoe in 1947. Brock attended and graduated from the Kaiser-Karl-Gymnasium, a gymnasium {{with a focus on}} the humanities, Latin and Greek. The name <b>Bazon</b> is Greek for chatterer and was applied to him at school by his Latin teacher. From 1957 to 1964, he studied German studies, art history, philosophy and political science at the universities of Zurich, Hamburg and Frankfurt. He did not study art at a university. During this period, he published poems and [...] "Aktionslehrstücke" [...] (plays), using [...] "Bazon" [...] as his pen name. In 1957, he trained as a dramaturge at the theater of Darmstadt and in 1960, began working at the Lucerne Municipal Theatre.|$|E
5000|$|The {{award was}} first {{distributed}} over a twenty-year period (1975-95) and included the categories Literature and Translation. Then {{it was followed}} for a decade (1999-2009) by a Hermann-Lenz-Preis and resumed in 2010. The first jury consisted of fluxus participant <b>Bazon</b> Brock, poets Michael Krüger and Nicolas Born, and novelist Peter Handke. When the prize resumed in 2010, Peter Handke and Michael Krüger still were on the jury, together with the authors Alfred Kolleritsch (himself awarded in 1978) and Peter Hamm. [...] "We want to support a national and regional culture in Europe," [...] founder Hubert Burda initially said at the 2011 awards. An explicit goal was to watch out all over Europe for authors who gave a distinctive voice to their prevailing culture. The Petrarca-Preis consisted of 20,000 €, {{and it could be}} shared between several winners. The ceremony was usually held in places which Francesco Petrarch at some point visited.|$|E
5000|$|In 1995 {{the gallery}} owner Hans Mayer shows an {{extensive}} solo exhibition of Wandrey's works at his commercial gallery in Düsseldorf. It meets with such unexpected success, particularly among young audiences, {{that it is}} extended twice. Aesthetics professor <b>Bazon</b> Brock holds the opening speech and writes an article about Wandrey's [...] "digitalist" [...] experiments for Der Spiegel special magazine."His focus is not on computer aided image production. Wandrey does not pretend to create art with software, as unfortunately legions of naïve technology disciples tend to do. If the medium in itself is the message - holy McLuhan -, then the message cannot be 'art' but only the medium again: Graphic-Computer-In-Action. … Or, {{in the case of}} Wandrey, hardware has to become heartware."In 1999 the Leipzig Museum of Applied Arts hosts the exhibition Petrus Wandrey Retrospective. The curator is Prof. Dr. David Galloway, who also publishes the exhibition catalogue at Oktagon Publishing House, Köln (Cologne).|$|E
5000|$|In the 1960s, Brock {{participated in}} happenings with Friedensreich Hundertwasser, Joseph Beuys and Wolf Vostell. In a 1968 exhibition, he showed a metal {{plate in the}} style of a {{high-voltage}} warning: [...] "death must be abolished, this damned mess must stop. He who speaks a word of consolation is a traitor" [...] ("der Tod muß abgeschafft werden, diese verdammte Schweinerei muß aufhören. Wer ein Wort des Trostes spricht, ist ein Verräter") and signed <b>Bazon</b> Brock. The text is a truncated version of his eulogy for Siegfried Kracauer, which continued, [...] "betrays the solidarity of all human beings against death ... Death ... is a scandal, a beastly mess! ... Don't let yourselves submit to it, understand death ... is a monstrous scandal, against which I protest.") ("ist ein Verräter an der Solidarität aller Menschen gegen den Tod ... Der Tod ist ein Skandal, eine viehische Schweinerei! ... Lasst euch nicht darauf ein, versteht: der Tod ... ist ein ungeheuerlicher Skandal, gegen den ich protestiere.") ...|$|E
