5|$|UFA Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs) <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Brownlee as {{a better}} leader than the indecisive Greenfield. A group of them {{attempted}} to force Greenfield to resign in Brownlee's favour. Though Brownlee opposed these attempts, initially threatening to resign if Greenfield did, he was eventually persuaded {{to accept the}} premiership if Greenfield willingly relinquished it. Brownlee became premier November 23, 1925.|$|E
5|$|With the {{weakening}} of Byzantium, Venice <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Ragusa as a rival who needed to be brought under her control, but the attempt to conquer the city in 948 failed.

5|$|Bakshi's frustrations {{with his}} failing {{marriage}} {{and the state of}} the planet further drove his need to animate. In 1959, he moved his desk to join the rest of the animators; after asking Rasinski for material to animate, he received layouts of two scenes: a hat floating on water and Deputy Dawg, the lead character of one of Terrytoons' syndicated television series, running. Despite threats of repercussion from the animators' union, Rasinski fought to keep Bakshi as a layout artist. Bakshi <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Rasinski as a father figure; Rasinski, childless, was happy to serve as Bakshi's mentor.|$|E
5|$|Early monasteries {{throughout}} Europe helped preserve Greek and Roman classical civilisation. The Church {{eventually became}} the dominant influence in Western civilisation {{into the modern}} age. Many Renaissance figures were sponsored by the church. The 16th century, however, <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> challenges to the Church, in particular to its religious authority, by figures in the Protestant Reformation, {{as well as in}} the 17th century by secular intellectuals in the Enlightenment. Concurrently, Spanish and Portuguese explorers and missionaries spread the Church's influence through Africa, Asia, and the New World.|$|E
5|$|In 1910 Yeats {{thought his}} {{horoscope}} suggested {{a return to}} Olivia; he distanced himself from Maud and in June <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Olivia more frequently. Pound was fond of Olivia, which may have caused Yeats some jealousy as when, for example, Pound met the two at the theatre and took them afterward to tea—an occasion when Yeats was extremely rude to Pound. A year later, Olivia introduced Yeats to Georgie Hyde-Lees, her 18-year-old step-niece and Dorothy's best friend, whom Yeats eventually married.|$|E

5|$|In April 1903, she was {{introduced}} to a Blue Cuirassier Guards officer Nikolai Kulikovsky by her brother Michael during a royal military review at Pavlovsk Palace. Olga and Kulikovsky <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> each other, and exchanged letters regularly. The same year, {{at the age of}} 22, she confronted her husband and asked for a divorce, which he refused with the qualification that he might reconsider after seven years. Nevertheless, Oldenburg appointed Kulikovsky as an aide-de-camp, and allowed him to live in the same residence as Oldenburg and the Grand Duchess on Sergievskaya Street. The relationship between Kulikovsky and the Grand Duchess was not public, but gossip about their romance spread through society.|$|E
5|$|Late 18th-century critics {{felt that}} Smart's madness {{justified}} them in ignoring his A Song to David, {{but during the}} following century Robert Browning and his contemporaries considered his condition {{to be the source}} of his genius. It was not until the 20th century, with the rediscovery of Jubilate Agno (not published until 1939), that critics reconsidered Smart's case and <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> him as a revolutionary poet, the possible target of a plot by his father-in-law, a publisher, to silence him.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the other}} claimants to the Duchy <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that Sforza {{would be a}} greater threat than the Ambrosian Republic. Louis of Savoy invaded in spring of 1449, and Sforza sent Colleoni (who had earlier defected) to defeat him at Borgomanero, leading to an uneasy peace. Sforza also faced treachery within his own ranks, added {{with the fact that}} he rashly {{accepted}} the defection of his great enemies the Piccinino brothers, who, upon gaining access to Monza, promptly returned it to Milan.|$|E

5|$|Now a five-piece, Uncle Tupelo {{recorded}} {{their major}} label debut at Cedar Creek studio in Austin, Texas in early 1993. Anodyne consisted of live-in-the-studio recordings and included {{a duet with}} Farrar and Doug Sahm of the Sir Douglas Quintet. The album sold 150,000 copies, and was their only entry on the Billboard Heatseekers chart. The group toured {{until the end of}} the year, finishing with a sold out concert at Tramps in New York City. Because of their concert draw, major executives at Sire <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the band as a potential hit.|$|E
5|$|Starting in {{the early}} 1990s, St. Louis became home to a {{substantial}} Bosnian immigrant community, which became the second-largest in the United States in 1999. The city also <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> an increase in immigrants from Mexico, Vietnam, Ethiopia, and Somalia. Many immigrants reported moving to St. Louis, particularly its south side Bevo Mill neighborhood, due to the low cost of living compared to other American cities. Despite this increase, the foreign-born population of the St. Louis region was roughly one-third of the national average in 2010.|$|E
5|$|Targeted Killings: Law and Morality in an Asymmetrical World {{begins with}} an {{introduction}} by Andrew Altman. This is followed by eighteen essays broken into five sections arranged by topic. The work says that after the Al-Qaeda attacks in the United States on 11 September 2001, the US and other countries <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the tactic of targeted killing differently. The practice of targeted killing had previously been accepted in situations of self-defense in military settings; after the attacks {{it was used to}} kill non-combatants and those not directly involved in a particular armed force.|$|E

5|$|The {{reign of}} PedroII thus {{came to an}} unusual end—he was overthrown while highly {{regarded}} by the people and {{at the pinnacle of}} his popularity, and some of his accomplishments were soon brought to naught as Brazil slipped into a long period of weak governments, dictatorships, and constitutional and economic crises. The men who had exiled him soon <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> in him a model for the Brazilian republic. A few decades after his death, his reputation was restored and his remains were returned to Brazil with celebrations nationwide. Historians have regarded the Emperor in an extremely positive light and several have ranked him as the greatest Brazilian.|$|E
5|$|Titian was a {{personal}} friend of Charles; the commissioning of the portrait was most likely intended by Paul as a signal of allegiance to the emperor. Pressure from reforming monarchs in France and Spain, coupled with a general shift of influence in France's favour, ended the Farnese hold on the papacy soon after Paul's death. Ottavio excelled as a military commander and was awarded the Golden Fleece by the emperor. While the post had been given {{as a means to}} strengthen the family position, it did not come without cost. His success bred resentment amongst his family, as he <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> himself unaccountable to Rome.|$|E
5|$|Vytautas became duke of Hrodna and Podlaskie; Jogaila known now by his Christian name Władysław II (Władysław II Jagiełło) {{designated}} {{his brother}} Skirgaila regent in Lithuania. Skirgaila, who also ruled Vytautas' patrimony in Trakai, was disliked by the Lithuanian nobility. Vytautas, {{on the other}} hand, became increasingly popular; Władysław II <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> him as a rival. Vytautas was supported by Lithuanians who resented the Polish interpretation of the recent Union of Krewo. These Lithuanians wished to maintain distinct legal structures and reserve official posts for Lithuanians. The Lithuanian elites also resented the changes in government that king Władysław II implemented there.|$|E

5|$|Because of his stammer, Albert dreaded public speaking. After {{his closing}} {{speech at the}} British Empire Exhibition at Wembley on 31 October 1925, one which was an ordeal for both him and his listeners, he <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Lionel Logue, an Australian-born speech therapist. The Duke and Logue practised {{breathing}} exercises, and the Duchess rehearsed with him patiently. Subsequently, {{he was able to}} speak with less hesitation. With his delivery improved, the Duke opened the new Parliament House in Canberra, Australia, during a tour of the empire in 1927. His journey by sea to Australia, New Zealand and Fiji took him via Jamaica, where Albert played doubles tennis partnered with a black man, Bertrand Clark, which was unusual at the time and taken locally as a display of equality between races.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} half of the 20th century, Peking opera {{witnessed}} a steady decline in audience numbers. This has been attributed both to a decrease in performance quality and an inability of the traditional opera form to capture modern life. Furthermore, the archaic language of Peking opera required productions to use electronic subtitles, which hampered the development of the form. The influence of Western culture has also left the younger generations impatient with the slow pacing of Peking opera. In response, Peking opera <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> reform starting in the 1980s. Such reforms have taken the form of creating a school of performance theory to increase performance quality, employing modern elements to attract new audiences, and performing new plays outside of the traditional canon. However, these reforms have been hampered by both a lack of funding and an adverse political climate that makes the performance of new plays difficult.|$|E
5|$|Early on Boxing Day 1964, Hindley {{left her}} {{grandmother}} at a relative's house {{and refused to}} allow her back to Wardle Brook Avenue that night. On the same day, 10-year-old Lesley Ann Downey disappeared from a funfair in Ancoats. Despite a huge search, she was not found. The following day, Hindley brought her grandmother back home. By February 1965, Patricia Hodges had stopped visiting 16Wardle Brook Avenue, but David Smith was still a regular visitor. Brady gave Smith books to read, and the two discussed robbery and murder. On Hindley's 23rd birthday, her sister and brother-in-law, who had until then been living with relatives, were rehoused in Underwood Court, a block of flats not far from Wardle Brook Avenue. The two couples <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> each other more regularly, but usually only on Brady's terms.|$|E
