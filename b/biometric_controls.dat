40|$|The border {{has been}} called the {{fundamental}} political institution; and the bordering process {{is one of the most}} important roles for community, delineating between inside and outside, us and them, safe and dangerous, known and unknown. Borders represent both an appeal to the limits in politics and of political community, and a technology of limits – a means of defining what is possible in the governing of life itself. Yet, even as border management has taken on a renewed emphasis for policy makers, assessing the border’s status as a definable, concrete entity or process has become increasingly problematic. As we write this editorial, for example, the British government announces the extension of <b>biometric</b> <b>controls,</b> security gates, scanning and screening into the public spaces of the railway station, shopping mall and sports stadium. In addition to its traditional geo-physical characteristics, the border has taken on virtual, de-territorialized attributes as well. Castles, walled cities, and extensive border battlements have been replaced by gated communities, expansive border zones, and management by “remote control. ” The contemporary border is constituted as much by data-flows, artificial zones and spaces of enclosure that seep into the city and the neighbourhood, as by older state and geographi...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Biometric {{recognition}} {{is the use}} of individual biometric characteristics, such as fingerprint, face, and signature for automatically computerized recognition systems. Fingerprints are the most widely used form of biometric recognition system successfully. However, fingerprint images are rarely of perfect quality. They may be degraded and corrupted due to variations in skin and impression conditions. Thus, image enhancement techniques are employed prior to minutiae extraction to obtain a more reliable estimation of minutiae locations. Minutiae extraction yielded many minutiae resulting from fingerprint irregularities. The aim of this work is the development of a <b>biometric</b> access <b>control</b> system for restricted areas based on individual finger print and Gabor filter for enhancement process. The development system architecture, demonstrating the components, enhancement, minutiae extraction and matching techniques are presented. A software application is written in Matlab and C # to implement algorithms for enhancement, minutiae extraction and matching processing. The resulting minutiae information will be used as a method of identifying matching fingerprints. Also it will be used to register this fingerprint in system database. Finally, verification system, and identification system are implemented. Registration system has facilities namely; automatic registration, manual registration and update for the database to help the administrator to update required information. Based on that processing, an integrated secure system for <b>biometric</b> access <b>control</b> is developed for restricted area with acceptable security level...|$|R

40|$|Voting {{process in}} today’s era is behind its time {{in respect of}} the usage of modern ICT. The voting process is being seen mostly as a manual and paper based one. This process can be overwhelming, {{time-consuming}} and prone to security breaches and electoral fraud. Over the years technology related systems were being developed to resolve {{some of the issues}} like electoral fraud, impersonation, double voting etc. One such system is Electronic based voting that has been actively used for voting in countries like India. However, these systems seem to be prone to electoral frauds and voters have to make tremendous effort to cast their ballots. There are still a few very important areas which have to be identified and addressed viz., the Security which involves a person be able to vote in a secure manner, the time spent for voting by voters, the efficiency in counting of votes and the cost involved in employing people towards monitoring the voting process.

It is not uncommon for individual users to be faced with a half-dozen or more passwords and personal identification numbers. The ubiquity of passwords actually relaxes system security since many users tend to use the same password across all applications, or collect the various passwords in a single location. The use of biometrics not only recovers the ability to secure sensitive systems and data, but also does so in a user-friendly manner. The successful use of biometrics in distributed systems addresses several key concerns. First, the authentication strategy must maintain acceptable levels of security.

Illustrated through the example of the provision of manipulated feeder documents, the chapter subsequently outlines six features that practices of appropriation share irrespective of their form. Apart from demonstrating that moments of autonomy of migration persist within biometric border regimes, the chapter thus introduces the notion of appropriation as an alternative concept to theorise migrants’ capacity to subvert border controls...|$|R
40|$|The {{security}} {{industry has}} undergone dramatic {{growth over the}} last twenty years due to a burgeoning of demand for security products and services. The protection of people, assets and information has been prominent among the concerns of business, industry and the broader community. Crimes against domestic, commercial, and industrial premises, small and large, are a commonplace occurrence and security has therefore become an essential component of any facility 2 ̆ 7 s continual operation. The security industry has been quick to respond to these concerns through the rapid development {{of a wide range of}} products and services. Growth in security as an academic discipline has paralleled these recent concerns. However. the discipline of security lacks format tools that can be used by security managers, consultants and employees when attempting to create effective security. This is because of security 2 ̆ 7 s relative age as a discipline - theories and tools are still being developed. Biometrics is the science of using a measurable physical characteristic or behavioural trait to recognise the identity, or verify the claimed identity, of a person through automated means. When used in conjunction with an access control system, a very high level of security can be achieved. <b>Biometric</b> access <b>control</b> technologies emerged in the late 1950 s. The use of biometrics has been repeatedly forecast to dramatically increase, however these predictions have not been realised. The reason for the low growth in biometric technology use has been attributed, in part, to user acceptance problems. The aim of this study was to contribute to the security discipline by exploring and analysing the concept of user acceptance for <b>biometric</b> access <b>control</b> technologies. The study set out to define user acceptance, identify and discuss user acceptance issues, and develop frameworks for the identification and treatment of user acceptance issues. Researching the area of user acceptance, and then testing people 2 ̆ 7 s attitudes towards user acceptance issues achieved this. The results of the testing process demonstrated an acknowledgement by the eighty respondents to the Likert test that user acceptance is indeed an issue for biometric technologies. The respondents identified hygiene, ease of use and user reticence as low magnitude user acceptance issues. The intrusiveness of the data collection method, enrolment time, system failure, speed and throughput rate, system control, and biometrics versus other technologies were all identified as issues of high magnitude. This study developed a range of outcomes that can be used for the definition, identification and treatment of user acceptance problems. A definition of user acceptance issues for biometric technologies was developed. A total of nine user acceptance dimensions were identified and described in detail. A framework for the identification of user acceptance issues for any biometric application was created. A framework for the treatment of user acceptance issues was also developed. This study sought to compile a comprehensive picture of user acceptance issues for <b>biometric</b> access <b>control</b> technologies.

3000|$|Among the {{different}} types of access <b>control</b> systems, <b>Biometric</b> Access <b>Control</b> (BAC) systems pose the most direct threat to privacy. BAC systems control allocation of resources based on highlydiscriminative physical characteristics of the user such as fingerprints, iris images, voice patterns, or even DNA sequences. As a biometric signal is based on [...] "who you are" [...] rather than [...] "what you have," [...] BAC systems excel in authenticating a user's identity. While the use of biometrics enhances system security and alleviates users from carrying identity cards or remembering passwords, it creates a conundrum for privacy advocates as the knowledge of the identity makes it much harder to keep users anonymous. A curious system operator or a parasitic hacker can infer the identity of a user based on his/her biometric probe. Furthermore, as biometrics is immutable from systems to systems, it can be used by attackers to cross-correlate disparate databases and cause damages far beyond the coverage of any protection schemes for individual database systems.|$|R
