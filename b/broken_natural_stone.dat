50|$|According to Rupert Gunnis a Dutchman named Van Spangen {{set up an}} {{artificial}} stone manufactury at Bow in London in 1800. Having later gone into partnership with a Mr. Powell the firm was broken up in 1828, and the moulds sold to a sculptor, Felix Austin who had a premises in New Road (now Euston Road), London, England. His material {{was not the same}} as the ceramic body used by Mrs. Coade, (although he is known to have copied old Coade stone designs), but made from 'Portland cement, <b>broken</b> <b>natural</b> <b>stone,</b> pounded marble and coarse sand' (The Builder, 1868, now Building). Around 1840 Austin entered into partnership with John Seeley. Seeley had trained at the Royal Academy Schools and also made {{an artificial}} stone, which he called 'artificial limestone', before entering into partnership with Austin. In 1841 Austin and Seeley published their first catalogue, 'Collection of Ornaments at Austin & Seeley's Artificial Stone Works for Gardens, Parks and Pleasure Grounds'. The firm continued in production until about 1872.|$|E

5000|$|Modern {{synthetic}} stones are generally of equal quality to <b>natural</b> <b>stones,</b> {{and are often}} considered superior in sharpening performance due to consistency of particle size and control over {{the properties of the}} stones. For example, the proportional content of abrasive particles as opposed to base or [...] "binder" [...] materials can be controlled to make the stone cut faster or slower, as desired. <b>Natural</b> <b>stones</b> are often prized for their <b>natural</b> beauty as <b>stones</b> and their rarity, adding value as collectors' items. Furthermore, each <b>natural</b> <b>stone</b> is different, and there are rare <b>natural</b> <b>stones</b> that contain abrasive particles in grit sizes finer than are currently available in artificial stones.|$|R
40|$|<b>Natural</b> <b>stones,</b> {{each with}} {{particular}} physical, mechanical, chemical and mineralogical and petrographic properties, {{are used as}} covering or pavement materials and thus are important because of their practical uses. The physical and mechanical properties of these materials used as the pavement of buildings in open areas are affected by temperature variations especially in cold regions. In construction projects, particularly in areas exposed to temperature variations, gloss value {{is one of the}} most essential physical features of <b>natural</b> <b>stones</b> that will be used as covering or pavement materials. Wetting-drying, heating-cooling, and freezing-thawing are environmental factors of considerable importance in the aging of <b>natural</b> <b>stones.</b> In order to determine the stone which is most suitable for use in the areas exposed to temperature variation under non-stable climatic conditions, gloss value (the surface brightness of the polished <b>natural</b> <b>stones</b> after freezing-thawing) was investigated using a thermostatic chamber. In this study, the effect of temperature variation on the surface brightness of polished <b>natural</b> <b>stones</b> (gloss value) and the relationship between gloss value and some physical, mechanical properties of <b>natural</b> <b>stone</b> samples and also calcite grain size were elucidated. As a result, it is revealed that <b>natural</b> <b>stone</b> samples except limestone used in the study are not suitable for outdoor applications in cold regions due to high variations in their gloss values...|$|R

40|$|<b>Natural</b> <b>stone</b> {{has been}} used as a {{flooring}} material for centuries all over the world. In addition to its timeless aesthetic qualities, <b>natural</b> <b>stone’s</b> durability, low maintenance profile, and recyclability make it a sustainable flooring choice. This case study examines the benefits associated with the use of <b>natural</b> <b>stone</b> flooring in high traffic areas. Durability & Expected Life Flooring materials show age differently and at different rates. Flooring options, such as vinyl composition tile, require frequent refinishing and lose surface quality relatively quickly. In contrast, <b>natural</b> <b>stone</b> flooring ages gracefully and can last for centuries, as many historic examples illustrate. While some estimates indicate a 50 -year lifetime for flooring, the National Association of Home Builders expect <b>natural</b> <b>stone,</b> particularly granite, marble, and slate, to last approximately 100 years with proper maintenance. Though <b>natural</b> <b>stone</b> flooring will last the life of a building, its useful life need not end with the building. <b>Natural</b> <b>stone’s</b> durability makes it an ideal material for reclamation and reuse in a variety of applications; see the NSC’s case study on the application of salvaged stone for suggestions. (For use in structural projects, be sure to test the stone as would be conducted for virgin material.) This capability constitutes savings not only in installation costs but also in environmental expenses. When stone is given a second life, consumption of the energy, water, and materials needed for extraction and processing is avoided.
