50|$|Like the IS-5, the IS-9 had a {{steel tube}} boom {{and a very}} similar {{empennage}} {{to that of the}} glider. Its ply covered fin extended both above and below the boom, carrying a fabric covered, rounded, equally deep unbalanced rudder, broad at its heel. The fin also mounted a straight edged, ply covered tailplane placed just above the boom which carried rounded elevators, mass balanced by a <b>bob</b> <b>weight</b> inside the fuselage, with gaps at their roots to clear the fin and a small cut out for rudder movement; the elevators were fabric covered over ply skins like the ailerons and had a starboard side trim tab.|$|E
5000|$|The {{solution}} {{developed for}} high-speed steam engines was the [...] "automatic" [...] governor. Rather than controlling the flow rate of steam, it controlled the timing or 'cut-off' of the inlet valves. This governor was interspersed between the crankshaft and the eccentric driving the valve gear. It was often made {{as part of}} the engine's flywheel. A centrifugal <b>bob</b> <b>weight</b> in the governor moved out against a spring with increasing speed. This caused the eccentric's position to shift relative to the crank, changing the valve timing and causing an early cut-off. As this control acted directly at the cylinder port, rather than through a long pipe from a throttle valve, it could be very fast-acting.|$|E

50|$|The {{fuselage}} of the IS-10 was an oval section, slender plywood monocoque. The pilot {{sat in a}} semi-reclining {{position in}} a long, single-seat cockpit under a single-piece, side-opening perspex canopy which, with a short fixed transparency behind it. stretched from the nose into {{the leading edge of}} the wing. Its undercarriage comprised a short, rubber-sprung skid from the nose to only about halfway to the wing. A fixed, unsprung monowheel was semi-recessed into the fuselage under the wing and fitted with a brake. Further aft the fuselage tapered to a conventional empennage. A narrow, ply-covered fin and a fabric-covered rudder, which extended down to the keel, together formed a straight-tapered, flat-topped vertical tail. The fin also mounted a straight-edged, fabric-over-ply-covered tailplane placed just above the fuselage, which carried straight-tapered, similarly skinned elevators. These were balanced by a <b>bob</b> <b>weight</b> within the fuselage and had gaps both at their roots to clear the fin and at their tips to clear rearward tailplane extensions, with a small central cut out for rudder movement. A small tail bumper was fitted under the rudder hinge.|$|E

50|$|The DAF 600 was {{the first}} car to have a {{continuously}} variable transmission (CVT) system - the innovative DAF Variomatic., the same system was carried over to the 750 and its variants. The DAF Variomatic employs centrifugal weights to control the drive ratio of the transmission and is enhanced by the engine manifold vacuum. The action of the bob weights and inlet vacuum combined to pull together the cheeks of two, variable diameter, driving pulleys, driven directly from the engine. These were connected, by rubber 'V' belts, to two similar driven pulleys, connected to the drive wheels. The cheeks of the driven pulleys were held together by spring tension, which was progressively overcome as the drive pulleys expanded and the tension of the belts increased. The DAF Variomatics were thereby the only cars ever produced which went faster by the simple expedient of gently and gradually releasing the accelerator once top engine speed had been reached, as the increased vacuum took over from the reducing <b>bob</b> <b>weight</b> speed. The Variomatic also permitted increased engine braking by operating a switch on the dashboard which reversed {{the action of the}} vacuum on the pulley's diaphragm, seeking a lower ratio with increased manifold vacuum. Two separate transmissions ran the two driving wheels, eliminating the need for a differential. The two transmissions could provide different drive ratios, permitting the wheels to rotate at different speeds. The duplication also provided redundancy. If one belt broke, the vehicle could still be driven.An interesting feature: putting the car in reverse reversed the entire drive system. This enabled the vehicle, at least the earlier examples, in theory to reach the same top speed in reverse as forward.|$|E

40|$|The {{technique}} of deriving phonocardiogramsfrom the 'pixie ' accelerometer record by appropriate filters is described and typical examples are shown. Velocity and displacement traces {{have also been}} obtained by successive integrations of the praecordial acceleration trace, which compare closely with those recorded by conventional photoelectric methods. An accelerometer is a small transducer which senses the acceleration of any object {{to which it is}} attached. It usually consists of a small <b>bob</b> <b>weight</b> supported on a cantilever spring (Fig. i) : upward acceleration of the base causes a downward movement of the bob relative to the base, of a magnitude dependent on the mass of the bob, the stiffness of the spring, and proportional to the acceleration applied to the base. The resonant frequency of the spring bob combination {{is a function of the}} mass of the bob and the stiffness of the spring. If a high resonant frequency is required, the spring stiffness must be high in relation to the mass, and the deflection is correspondingly small. When adjusted to give a resonant fre-quency of i kc/sec, the spring mass combina-tion is such that the movement of the <b>bob</b> <b>weight</b> for an acceleration of i g (98 I cm/sec 2) is about 02,Lm...|$|E
5000|$|... :Gabriel [...] "Gabe" [...] Duncan (Bradley Steven Perry) is {{the middle}} Duncan sibling, being both the younger brother of Teddy and PJ and the older brother of Charlie and Toby. From the {{beginning}} Gabe doesn't approve of Charlie's arrival and is the last {{one of the family}} to get used to her, but finally he reaches the point of reluctantly assisting in her care and demonstrating some fondness of her. He is a prankster and troublemaker, often sarcastic and lazy, but can also be dutiful and determined at times. He is front-man {{when it comes to the}} Duncans' running rivalry with their neighbor Mrs. Dabney, who is often the target of Gabe's pranks and stunts—which is the only time the family doesn't mind them. Although he doesn't like Mrs. Dabney, he ends up dating a relative of Mrs. Dabney, Lauren. He and Toby are the only brown-haired Duncans; all of the others are blondes. A running gag in the show is that he insults <b>Bob's</b> <b>weight</b> and baldness, Amy's cooking, PJ being a goofball, Teddy being a [...] "goody-goody," [...] and occasionally Charlie. He also likes to harass and tease Mrs. Dabney, whom he finds annoying. He also won the right to name his baby brother Toby; in one episode, he tried to impress a girl by making video diaries for Toby, ending them with [...] "Good Fortune, Toby!". It has been revealed that Gabe was a calm and docile baby.|$|R

2500|$|The first {{device to}} {{compensate}} for this error was the mercury pendulum, invented by George Graham in 1721. [...] The liquid metal mercury expands in volume with temperature. In a mercury pendulum, the pendulum's <b>weight</b> (<b>bob)</b> is a container of mercury. With a temperature rise, the pendulum rod gets longer, but the mercury also expands and its surface level rises slightly in the container, moving its centre of mass closer to the pendulum pivot. By using the correct height of mercury in the container these two effects will cancel, leaving the pendulum's centre of mass, and its period, unchanged with temperature. Its main disadvantage was that when the temperature changed, the rod {{would come to the}} new temperature quickly but the mass of mercury might take a day or two to reach the new temperature, causing the rate to deviate during that time. [...] To improve thermal accommodation several thin containers were often used, made of metal. Mercury pendulums were the standard used in precision regulator clocks into the 20th century.|$|R
5000|$|Over at Comeback Canyon, {{newcomer}} Rondalee {{is preparing}} to take on reigning champion Damien. She currently weighs 221 pounds and would love to get below 218, her plateau <b>weight.</b> <b>Bob's</b> plan is to ignite her fire and teach her to love herself for who she is. She lost three pounds last week, so she's primed for a big weight loss this week. Always a competitor, the former volleyball star says, [...] "To be the best, you have to beat the best." [...] And she knows Damien is the best. At the weigh-in, Rondalee meets her goal, dropping four pounds to 217. She's elated, as it's been eight years since she weighed less than 218 pounds. Damien, who currently weighs 306, now needs to lose at least six pounds to win. He steps on the scale and drops a whopping 11 pounds, landing him at 295! Damien couldn't be happier - he hasn't weighed less than 300 pounds since middle school. With his 3.59% weight loss, Damien becomes the second person to win Comeback Canyon two weeks in a row.|$|R
40|$|Dear Sir or Madam, My name is David Longman and I {{am looking}} a {{position}} in race engineering, engineering design or race mechanics. Over the last 10 years, I have combined my motorsports experience with formal education to enhance my race engineering design skills. I am currently working as an engineer at Porter's Fabrications, a multi-million dollar manufacturing facility. On a daily basis I deal with complex engineering drawings which require prototype construction and I determine the methods for manufacturing. These methods include laser cutting, bending/forming, machining, welding and powder coating. I graduated from UNC-Charlotte {{with a degree in}} mechanical engineering, physics, a math minor and a concentration in motorsports. Having this vast amount of education has helped me with my problem solving skills and knowing where to look for answers. In my senior year, I designed and built a revolutionary alignment rig for the Formula SAE car. The rigs accuracy was based on the true axis of wheel rotation not on how true parts where machined. This allowed the user to measure toe and camber free wheel or tool defects. Lastly, I used system of conveyor rollers, wheel plates, plumb <b>bobs</b> and corner <b>weight</b> scales {{for the rest of the}} rig...|$|R
60|$|Bob Gayner, as he {{was usually}} called, {{was one of the}} best gentlemen riders in the country. He came from County Roscommon,--the county, by the by, which can {{probably}} boast the best riders in Ireland,--where he had a small property of his own, near Athlone; but the chief part of his time was spent in riding races and training for them. He had been at it all his life--and certainly, if there be any merit in the perfection of such an art, Bob was entitled to it, for he rode beautifully. It was not only that he could put his horse at a fence without fear, and sit him whilst he was going over it--any man with practice could do that; but Bob had a sympathy with the animal he was riding, which enabled him not only to know what he could do himself, but also what the horse could do. He knew exactly where a horse wanted assistance from his rider. And he had another knack too, not unfrequently made use of in steeple-chases--Bob seldom let his own horse baulk, but he very generally made those that others were riding do so. And then, at a finish, how admirable was Bob! In leap races the finish is seldom so near a thing as in flat races; but when it did come to be neck and neck at the post, there was no man in Ireland could give a horse a stretch and land him in a winner like Bob. He had also an exquisite genius for tumbling. Horses will occasionally fall, and when they do, riders must follow them; but no one fell so safely, recovered so actively, and was again so instantly in the saddle as our friend; and, consequently, wherever there was a steeple-chase to be run, where pluck, science, and practice were wanting, there Bob was in requisition, and there he usually was found. It was a great thing to secure his services; and knowing this, Tony McKeon had, in his own way, long since, made Gayner his fast friend; how, I cannot say, for Bob was much above being bought, and though, no doubt, he made money by his races, he would have thought little of shooting any one who was bold enough to offer to pay him for riding. When in his cap, jacket, boots, and breeches, he would, if he thought occasion required or his interests demanded it, wrangle like a devil. Though its back were turned to him, he could see a horse go on the wrong side of a post; and woe betide the man who came to the scales as a winner an ounce below the <b>weight.</b> <b>Bob,</b> from long practice, knew all these dodges, and he made the most of them. But when once his cap was off, and his coat was on, he was a quiet, easy, unassuming fellow--liked and petted by all he knew; for he never spoke little of others nor bragged of himself.|$|R
