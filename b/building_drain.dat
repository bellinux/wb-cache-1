50|$|The geology of the Bangkok area is {{characterized}} by a top layer of soft marine clay known as Bangkok clay, averaging 15 m in thickness, which overlies an aquifer system consisting of eight known units. This feature has contributed to the effects of subsidence caused by extensive ground water pumping. First recognized in the 1970s, subsidence soon became a critical issue, reaching a rate of 120 mm per year in 1981. Ground water management and mitigation measures have since lessened the severity of the situation, although subsidence is still occurring at a rate of 10 to 30 mm per year, and parts of the city are now 1 m below sea level. There are fears that the city may be submerged by 2030. Subsidence has resulted in increased flood risk, as Bangkok is already prone to flooding due to its low elevation and inadequate drainage infrastructure resulting from rapid urbanization. The city now relies on flood barriers and augmenting drainage from canals by pumping and <b>building</b> <b>drain</b> tunnels, but parts of Bangkok and its suburbs are still regularly affected by flooding.

40|$|Autumn QuarterThe {{majority}} of the Autumn Quarter was spent developing a suitable program. This was impeded {{by the lack of}} specific verbage both from Dr. Michael and the Office of Extended Services, and the lack of data on the subject of Continuing Education for research purposes. The client had only an approximate idea of what he wanted, and could be specific in only the number of residential units and administrative offices. The site analysis was again hindered by lack of information. The size of the site was much larger than was needed, making it difficult to do detailed research. The schematics done during this period established the basic relationships, both horizontal and vertical, between general spatial categories. Winter QuarterAfter investigating various organizations it was decided that a lineal design was most appropriate. A strong central circulation spine would enable many differing spatial types and functions to be related to one another. In addition, mechanical systems and services would have their horizontal movement concentrated in this core. The initial scheme at mid-quarter was essentially linear with a series of activity nodes along the central spine. The spine was bent for the following reasons: 1. to provide closer physical relationships between the terminal areas of the spine; 2. to provide segregation of various spatial groups in terms of noise; and 3. to provide a semi-enclosed outdoor area. After re-examining the initial scheme, other lineal schemes were investigated. The lower twenty-acre portion of the site was decided the best location and more defined circulation and site zoning concepts were developed. The residential sector of the program, primarily because of privacy, was imposed over the other activity areas, and various schemes evolved. The final scheme incorporated a central spine terminated by entrances and registration areas for out of town and community and university participants. Administrative spaces, laboratories and studios, were organized {{on the north side of}} the spine; and the dining, recreation, and remaining conference and learning areas, on the south. Residential spaces were arranged on a single-loaded corridor. The corridor related to the spine and the rooms received southern sunlight. The auditorium and resource center are centrally located as is the service entrance. Spring QuarterThe largest part of the spring was expended in developing the mechanical, electrical and structural systems for the building. The heating system is a high velocity air system with air handling units distributed in the two central and two terminal equipment areas. Fifty-five degree air is supplied at 3000 feet per minute to attenuation/reheat/distribution boxes that are each controlled by separate thermostats. Air is returned at 1500 FPM. The residential floors are air-conditioned by fan-coil units in the individual spaces. The boilers, shillers, domestic hot water and incinerator are located in the central mechanical equipment spaces and two cooling towers are on the auditorium roof. The storm sewer runs along the central core west to the end of the building and south to Bethel Pike. The sanitary sewer comes in at the service entrance from McGalliard joining the <b>building</b> <b>drain</b> which runs along the central core. Electrical service is from the east end of the building and transformer vault, emergency generators and main switchboards are located at the east end of the basement. Panelboards are located in conjunction with the elevator towers and mechanical chases. The structural system consists of reinforced concrete bearing walls and precast concrete deck. The only exception to this is in the auditorium where the roof is framed with long span structural steel bar joists. The bearing walls gain lateral stability at the terminations of the linear core where they are turned out and in the stair and elevator towers where they are turned in and out again at the interior of the central core.

40|$|Sinkhole Mapping of Woodford County Kentucky Utilizing LiDAR Authors: Kalli Beasley and Adam Nolte Faculty Mentor: Junfeng Zhu Department: Kentucky Geologic Survey, University of Kentucky Abstract: This project {{utilizes}} LiDAR (light {{detection and}} ranging) {{in conjunction with}} GIS (Geographical Information System), aerial photography, and field-checking to delineate, verify, and map sinkholes in Woodford County, Kentucky. LiDAR is a remote-sensing technology that provides detailed topographic maps of the land surface, which are ideal for identifying sinkholes in karst areas. Sinkholes are common geologic hazards that can severely damage <b>buildings,</b> <b>drain</b> farm ponds, damage roads, and wreck farming equipment. In Kentucky, sinkholes cause an estimated $ 23 million in damages annually. Woodford County {{is located in the}} Bluegrass Region, a karst-dominated terrain, with bedrock consisting of Ordovician limestones and shales. Its land-surface is characterized by sinkholes, springs, underground streams, and caves. Previous mapping of sinkholes using topographic maps identified 1, 386 sinkholes in Woodford County. LiDAR detected 2, 307 sinkholes, an increase of 937 (41 percent) from the previous effort. This project demonstrates that LiDAR is a highly accurate method for identifying and mapping sinkholes...|$|R

40|$|Slope {{stability}} around {{railway tunnel}} in Gunung Gajah Village, Lahat District {{needs to be}} analysed due to landslide which occurred on January, 23 th 2016. That analysis {{needs to be done}} so that the railway transportation system can run safely. The purposes of this research are: to find out the factors that cause slope instability, to find out peak acceleration caused by railway traffic and earthquakes and its effects to the safety factor of slope, and determine stabilization method in order to prevent the occurrence of further landslide. The research activities include surveying, sampling, laboratory testing and analyzing slope stability using pseudo-static approach. Based on research result, the main factors that cause slope instability are morphology, structural geology, and ground vibration caused by earthquakes. Ground vibration are correlated to the slope instability. It shows that the higher of peak acceleration the lower of safety factor of slope. To prevent the occurrence of further landslide around research area, stabilization method should be applied in accordance with the conditions in that area such as building a retaining wall to increase safety factor of slope, <b>building</b> <b>draining</b> channels to reduce run off and performing shotcrete in the wall of landslide in order to avoid weathering...|$|R

40|$|This Corrective Action Investigation Plan {{contains}} the US Department of Energy, Nevada Operations Office's approach {{to collect the}} data necessary to evaluate corrective action alternatives appropriate for the closure of Corrective Action Unit (CAU) 254 under the Federal Facility Agreement and Consent Order. Corrective Action Unit 254 consists of Corrective Action Site (CAS) 25 - 23 - 06, Decontamination Facility. Located in Area 25 at the Nevada Test Site (NTS), CAU 254 was used between 1963 through 1973 for the decontamination of test-car hardware and tooling used in the Nuclear Rocket Development Station program. The CAS is composed of a fenced area measuring approximately 119 feet by 158 feet that includes Building 3126, an associated aboveground storage tank, a potential underground storage area, two concrete decontamination pads, a generator, two sumps, and a storage yard. Based on site history, {{the scope of this}} plan is to resolve the problem statement identified during the Data Quality Objectives process that decontamination activities at this CAU site may have resulted in the release of contaminants of concern (COCs) onto building surfaces, down <b>building</b> <b>drains</b> to associated leachfields, and to soils associated with two concrete decontamination pads located outside the building. Therefore, the scope of the corrective action field investigation will involve soil sampling at biased and random locations in the yard using a direct-push method, scanning and static radiological surveys, and laboratory analyses of all soil/building samples. Historical information provided by former NTS employees indicates that solvents and degreasers may have been used in the decontamination processes; therefore, potential COCs include volatile/semivolatile organic compounds, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act metals, petroleum hydrocarbons, polychlorinated biphenyls, pesticides, asbestos, gamma-emitting radionuclides, plutonium, uranium, and strontium- 90. The results of this field investigation will support a defensible evaluation of corrective action alternatives in the corrective action decision document...|$|R
