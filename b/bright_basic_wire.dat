To avoid conflicts it is recommended that business analysts who understand the user requirements, create a <b>basic</b> <b>wire</b> frame and then work with designers to further improve the wireframes.

50|$|Sensory {{maps are}} formed largely by experience. <b>Basic</b> <b>wiring</b> {{of the brain}} is {{established}} in vivo {{by a variety of}} molecular guidance cues, and the wiring is then refined by patterns of neural activity based in sensory experience. For synchronization of multiple maps, replay of sensory input in circuits allows neurons to be organized into vertical topographic functional units before horizontal integration. Neurons become specialized: in the big brown bat, delay-tuned neurons encode a target range and act as probability encoders, and this comes from experience. In the owl, auditory units responded to specific locations in space, and units were arranged systematically according to the relative locations of their receptive fields, thereby creating a physiological map of auditory space. The receptive fields of the neurons found in the midbrain auditory nucleus had receptive fields independent of nature and intensity of the sound.|$|R
40|$|The quandary {{of how to}} {{classify}} neurons in mammalian nervous systems is a serious one for understanding the <b>basic</b> <b>wiring</b> of the brain (Masland, 2004; Bota and Swanson, 2007).

40|$|The <b>basic</b> <b>wiring</b> of {{the brain}} is first {{established}} before birth by {{using a variety of}} molecular guidance cues. These connections are then refined by patterns of neural activity, which are initially generated spontaneously and subsequently driven by sensory experience. In the superior colliculus, a midbrain nucleus involved in the control of orienting behaviour, visual, auditory, and tactile inputs converge to form superimposed maps of sensory space. Maps of visual space and of the body surface arise from spatially ordered projections from the retina and skin, respectively. In contrast, the map of auditory space is computed within the brain by tuning the neurons to different localization cues that result from the acoustical properties of the head and ears. Establishing and maintaining the registration of the maps in the face of individual differences in the size and relative positions of different sense organs is an activity-dependent process in which the synaptic circuits underlying the auditory representation are modified and calibrated under the influence of both auditory and visual experience.

40|$|We {{model the}} {{functioning}} of different wiring schemes in visual projections using artificial neural networks and so speculate on selective factors underlying taxonomic variation in neural architecture. We model the high connective overlap of vertebrates (where networks have a dense mesh of connections) and the less overlapping, more modular architecture of arthropods. We also consider natural variation in these <b>basic</b> <b>wiring</b> schemes. Generally, arthropod networks are as efficient or more efficient in functioning compared to vertebrate networks. They do not show the confusion effect (decreasing targeting accuracy with increasing input group size), and they train as well or better. Arthropod networks are, however, generally poorer at reconstructing novel inputs. The ability of vertebrate networks to effectively process novel stimuli could promote behavioral sophistication and drive the evolution of vertebrate wiring schemes. Vertebrate networks with less connective overlap have, surprisingly, similar or superior properties compared to those with high connective overlap. Thus, the partial connective overlap seen in real vertebrate visual projections may be an optimal, evolved solution. Arthropod networks with and without whole‐cell neural connections within neural layers have similar properties. This indicates that neural connections mediated by offshoots of single cells (dendrites) may be fundamental to generating the confusion effect...|$|R

MethodsA Literature search was performed on pubmed using combinations of the following keywords; endovascular, skills, training, simulation, assessment and learning curve. Additional articles were retrieved from the reference lists of identified papers as well as discussion with experts in the arena of medical education. ResultsAvailable alternatives to training on patients inclue synthetic models, anesthetized animals, human cadavers and virtual reality (VR) simulation. VR simulation is a useful tool enabling objective demonstration of improved skills performance both in simulated performance and in subsequent in-vivo performance. Assessment modalities reviewed include time action analysis, error analysis, global rating scales, procedure specific checklists and VR simulators. Assessment in training has been widely validated using VR simulation.

40|$|Brain derived {{neurotrophic}} factor (BDNF) plays key roles in several neurodevelopmental disorders {{and actions of}} pharmacological treatments. However it is uncealr how specific BDNF’s effects are on diffeerent circuit components. Current studies have largely focused {{on the role of}} BDNF in modification of synaptic development. The precise roles of BDNF in the refinement of a functional circuit in vivo remain unclear. Val 66 Met polymorphism of BDNF may be associated with increased risk for cognitive impairments and is mediated at least in part by activity-dependent trafficking and/or secretion of BDNF. Using mutant mice that lacked activity-driven BDNF expression (bdnf-KIV), we previously reported that experience regulation of the cortical GABAergic network is mediated by activity-driven BDNF expression. Here, we demonstrate that activity-driven BDNF’s effects on circuits formed by the layer IV spiny stellate cells are highly specific. Structurally, dendritic but not axonal morphology was altered in the mutant. Physiologically, GABAergic but not glutamatergic synapses were severely affected. The effects on GABA transmission occurs via presynaptic alteration of calcium-dependent release probability. These results suggest that neuronal activity through activity-driven BDNF expression, can selectively regulate specific features of layer IV circuits in vivo. We postulate that the role of activity-dependent BDNF is to modulate the computational ability of circuits that relate to the gain control (i. e. feed-forward inhibition); whereas the <b>basic</b> <b>wiring</b> of circuits relevant to the sensory pathway is spared. Gain control modulation within cortical circuits has broad impact on cognitive processing and brain state-transitions.

40|$|Background and Aims: Most central venous {{catheters}} {{are placed}} using Seldinger guide wires. EN ISO 11070 is the guideline for testing guide wire flexing performance and tensile strength, {{and we can}} safely assume that guide wires in use meet these requirements. Unfortunately, EN ISO 11070 guidelines {{do not reflect the}} clinical requirements and we continue to see mechanical failures and their associated complications. Material and Methods: This in vitro study was performed in an accredited laboratory. With regard to flexing, we: (1) Established the minimum flexing performance needed to meet clinical requirements, (2) developed flexing performance tests which mimic clinical requirement, and (3) evaluated the mechanical properties of various guide wires relative to these requirements. With regard to tensile strength, we used the testing method prescribed in ISO 11070, but did not end the test at 5 Newton (N). We continued until the guide wire was damaged, or we reached maximum tractive force. We then did a wire-to-wire comparison. We examined two <b>basic</b> <b>wire</b> constructions, monofil and core and coil. Results: Tensile strength: All wires tested, except one, met EN ISO 11070 requirements for 5 N tensile strength. The mean of the wire types tested ranged from 15. 06 N to 257. 76 N. Flexing performance: None of the wires kinked. The monofil had no evidence of bending. Two core/coil wires displayed minor bending (angle 1. 5 °). All other wires displayed bending angles between 22. 5 ° and 43. 0 °. Conclusion: We recommend that: (1) Clinicians use guide wires with high-end mechanical properties, (2) EN ISO 11070 incorporate our flexing test into their testing method, raise the flexing requirement to kink-proof, (3) and raise the tensile strength requirement to a minimum of 30 N, and (3) all manufacturers and suppliers be required to display mechanical properties of all guide wire, and guide wire kits sold...|$|R
