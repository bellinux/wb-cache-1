5|$|Ford had 20 career fumble {{recoveries}} at {{the time}} of his retirement. Ford was successful in part because of his combination of quickness and size. Few players of his era who were as tall and <b>big</b> <b>as</b> he was could move as fast; only Larry Brink of the Rams was close to him in proportions.|$|E
5|$|Friendship {{is another}} {{prominent}} element of Live and Let Die, where {{the importance of}} male friends and allies shows through in Bond's relationships with Leiter and Quarrel. The more complete characters profiles in the novel clearly showed the strong relationship between Bond and Leiter. In turn this provides a strengthened motive for Bond to chase Mr <b>Big</b> <b>as</b> revenge for the shark attack on Leiter.|$|E

Unlike the traditional Windows service packs, the standalone installer, {{which could be}} downloaded once and installed {{as many times as}} needed, requires a Windows 8.1-specific product key. On July 1, 2014, acknowledging difficulties users may have had through the Windows Store update method, Microsoft began to phase in an automatic download process for Windows 8.1.|$|E

5|$|Both the Blazers and Mavericks started Game 4 {{with a quiet}} first half, with Dallas leading slightly. The Blazers then {{missed their}} first 15 shots after halftime as the Mavs' lead grew as <b>big</b> <b>as</b> 67–44. Roy then made a three-pointer {{near the end of}} the third to cut the lead to 67–49. In the fourth quarter, Roy scored 18 points after going 1-for-3 the {{previous}} 3 quarters, including a clutch 4-point play to tie the game and a bank shot from the middle of the paint with 49 seconds left to give his team the lead for good, finishing with 24 points to lead the Blazers to an improbable 84–82 win to tie the series. The Blazers would go on to lose the series in 6 games, but it gave hope for Roy to start again next season.|$|E
5|$|Crocodilians are {{opportunistic}} predators {{that are}} at their most dangerous in water and {{at the edge of}} water. Eight species are known to attack humans and may do so to defend their territories, nests, or young; by mistake, while attacking domestic animals such as dogs; or for food, as larger crocodilians can take prey as <b>big</b> <b>as</b> or bigger than humans. The species on which there is most data are the saltwater crocodile, the Nile crocodile, and the American alligator. Other species which have sometimes attacked humans are the black caiman, the Morelet's crocodile, the mugger crocodile, the American crocodile, the gharial, and the freshwater crocodile.|$|E
5|$|This is {{the manner}} in which they are made; two (parallel) walls of very thick wooden (planking) are raised, and across the space between them are placed very thick planks (the bulkheads) secured {{longitudinally}} and transversely by means of large nails, each three ells in length. When these walls have thus been built, the lower deck is fitted in, and the ship is launched before the upper works are finished. The pieces of wood, and those parts of the hull, near the water(-line) serve for the crew to wash and to accomplish their natural necessities. On the sides of these pieces of wood also the oars are found; they are as <b>big</b> <b>as</b> masts, and are worked by 10 or 15 men (each), who row standing up.|$|E

5|$|Theophrastus groups {{together}} the cereals and the legumes (peas and beans), and includes millet and other many-seeded plants like sesame also. These {{can only be}} grown from seed. They can be sown early, as with wheat, barley and beans, or in spring after the equinox, for plants like lentils, tares and peas. Vetch and chickpeas can, he reports, be sown at either season. When sprouting, beans form a shape like a penis, from which the root grows down and the leafy stem upwards. Wheat and barley flower {{for four or five}} days, whereas the legumes flower for much longer. Theophrastus reports that these plants grow differently according to the region, so for instance crops in Salamis appear earlier than those elsewhere in Attica. Wheat varieties are recorded as being named for their localities; they differ in colour, size, growth habit and food value. In a place near Bactra in Asia the wheat grains are said to grow as <b>big</b> <b>as</b> the stone of an olive, whereas pulses do not in Theophrastus's view vary to the same extent.|$|E

25|$|At {{this time}} crowds were as <b>big</b> <b>as</b> they ever were. Soon afterwards, however, {{interest}} in the WAFL began a slow decline, as it became increasingly obvious that even larger numbers of the WAFL's best players were going to head east.|$|E
