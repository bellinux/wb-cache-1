They began the season ranked #1 and started off 20–1, but then they slumped and lost six of their final nine games, including a loss to Bucknell {{in the first round}} of the NCAA Tournament. The team finished 23–7 and settled for a Big 12 co-championship with Oklahoma.|$|E

25|$|Leading {{into the}} 2013 AFL Draft, head coach Guy McKenna {{revealed}} {{he was looking}} to sign a rebounding defender to fill {{a hole in the}} team. It was highly speculated that the Suns would use the fifth pick in the draft to sign talented Tasmanian defender Kade Kolodjashnij. The speculation became reality when Kolodjashnij was taken by the Gold Coast at pick 5. <b>Big</b> <b>things</b> were expected of the highly touted duo in Kolodjashnij and Jack Martin leading into the 2014 AFL season. Like O'Meara a year before him, Jack Martin was required to spend the entire 2013 season in the Gold Coast's reserves team before being eligible to make his senior debut in 2014.|$|E
25|$|The Vikings {{boosted by}} return of Captain Ian Cahill {{for the final}} felt {{it was time for}} them to win their first {{silverware}} since 2010. However, the Trinity team who had scouted the previous game and had fresh legs started quick and were 2 scores up within the first quarter. The Vikings rattled responded positively with some outstanding Defensive play from the entire squad Ian Cahill, Donogh Flannery, Pat Noonan, Brian Kelly, Rob Crimin, Lorcan Crean, Ray Burke, Craig Switzer, Kevin Flaherty, Bono and Alvaro. However, despite several turnovers the Vikings offence struggled and the 2 games started to take their tole on an impressive offensive line. The Vikings played out the game and ultimately the scores remained 14–0. The Vikings battled valiantly with their most impressive rookie class in memory which surely bode well for the coming season. Impressive displays by the entire team and toughness shown by the offence through their struggles showed positive signs for the Vikings going forward. The Vikings then regrouped and disbanded before pre-season training began again in mid-January. With some hard work on offence and continued effort on Defence the Vikings team looks like it's ready for <b>big</b> <b>things</b> n 2014.|$|E
25|$|Successful former Rangers manager Walter Smith {{took over}} from Kendall {{in the summer}} of 1998 and <b>big</b> <b>things</b> were {{expected}} along with some high-profile signings but his first season saw another relegation battle, and only a late run of four wins from their final six games saw them earn safety a 14th-place finish. During the 1998–99 season striker Duncan Ferguson was sold to Newcastle United without Smith's knowledge. The resulting outrage from supporters regarding the manner of the sale lead to chairman Peter Johnson stepping down from his post. Theatrical producer Bill Kenwright bought control of the club and installed Philip Carter as the new chairman. Smith's chances of success were hampered by continuing financial constraints which had also contributed to the club's decline in previous years. 1999–2000 proved to be a better campaign, and the club looked to have an outside chance of qualifying for the UEFA Cup for much of the season. In the reverse of the previous year though, Everton fell apart in the final months of the campaign, claiming just two victories from their last twelve games and finishing in 13th, just one place higher than the previous year. 2000–01 saw a major step back however, and the club once again fell into a relegation battle, not helped by long-term injuries to several key players.|$|E

He has described how some songs he writes are suited to other vocal ranges. [...] "Quite often, I'm {{trying to write}} {{a certain kind of}} song and it's more ambitious than what my voice will get to. That's how I started writing songs with other people in mind". Kelly and Carmody's [...] "From Little Things <b>Big</b> <b>Things</b> Grow" [...] was analysed by Sydney University's Linguistics professor James R Martin.

She subconsciously finds herself drawn to parts that are in tandem with her personal struggles at certain points in her life. She finds it difficult to detach herself from her roles, saying that [...] "you have to confront your true feelings every single day. And that’s pretty exhausting. Then you have to go home and make dinner". Even so, she finds it therapeutic to perform. Winslet is known for her willingness to perform nude scenes, having done so in 12 of her films, although she considers its contribution to the narrative before agreeing to it. She believes that these scenes promote a positive body image among women.|$|E

Stone argued the season premiere should focus on the economy because it was the biggest news item at the time, but Parker felt they needed more time to craft the script, and that the Jonas Brothers would be a funny season opener.

[...] "From Little Things <b>Big</b> <b>Things</b> Grow", a seven-minute track from the album, was co-written by Kelly and Kev Carmody. It highlights the Gurindji Strike and Vincent Lingiari {{as part of}} the Indigenous Australian struggle for land rights and reconciliation. Forster indicates it has Dylanesque influences, and shows Kelly [...] "honing the skills of a fine balladeer and storyteller". A cover version that was released in May 2008 by The GetUp Mob, part of the GetUp! advocacy group, peaked at No.4 on the ARIA singles charts. This version included samples from speeches by Prime Ministers Paul Keating in 1992 and Kevin Rudd in 2008. It featured vocals by Carmody and Kelly, as well as other Australian artists.

However upon release, the song failed to garner enough airplay to chart, despite topping the US Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs chart. Lopez subsequently left Epic Records, citing that she had fulfilled her contractual obligations and now wished to release Love? under a new label.
