40|$|In {{the quest}} of why {{there should be}} a single {{transition}} temperature in a multi-gapped system like Fe-based materials we use two band model for simplicity. The model comprises of spin density wave (SDW), orbital density wave (ODW) arising due to nested pieces of the electron and hole like Fermi surfaces; together with superconductivity of different pairing symmetries around electron and hole like Fermi surfaces. We show that either only intra or only inter <b>band</b> <b>pairing</b> is insufficient to describe some of the experimental results like large to small gap ratio, thermal behaviour of electronic specific heat jump etc. It is shown that the inter-band pairing is essential in Fe-based materials having multiple gaps to produce a single global T_c. Some of our results in this scenario, matches with the earlier published work two-band-prb, and also have differences. The origin of difference between the two is also discussed. Combined intra-inter <b>band</b> <b>pairing</b> mechanism produces the specific heat jump to superconducting transition temperature ratio proportional to square of the transition temperature, both in the electron and hole doped regime, for sign changing s^± wave symmetry which takes the d+s pairing symmetry form. Our work thus demonstrates the importance of combined intra-inter <b>band</b> <b>pairing</b> irrespective of the pairing mechanism. Comment: Accept for publicatio...|$|E

40|$|The non-Abelian gauge fields play a {{key role}} in {{achieving}} novel quantum phenomena in condensed-matter and high-energy physics. Recently, the synthetic non-Abelian gauge fields have been created in the neutral degenerate Fermi gases, and moreover, generate many exotic effects. All the previous predictions can be well understood by the microscopic Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory. In this work, we establish an SU(2) Ginzburg-Landau theory for degenerate Fermi gases with the synthetic non-Abelian gauge fields. We firstly address a fundamental problem how the non-Abelian gauge fields, imposing originally on the Fermi atoms, affect the pairing field with no extra electric charge by a local gauge-field theory,and then obtain the first and second SU(2) Ginzburg-Landau equations. Based on these obtained SU(2) Ginzburg-Landau equations, we find that the superfluid critical temperature of the intra- (inter-) <b>band</b> <b>pairing</b> increases (decreases) linearly, when increasing the strength of the synthetic non-Abelian gauge fields.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{validate}} the vertebral <b>band</b> <b>pair</b> deposition rate for Common Threshers (Alopias vulpinus) in the northeastern Pacific Ocean (NEPO). Vertebrae of 37 Common Threshers marked with oxytetracycline (OTC) were collected from tag-recapture efforts and used in this study.

Shark size at time of injection with OTC ranged from 63 to 128 cm fork length (FL) and from 83 to 168 cm FL at recapture. Vertebral <b>band</b> <b>pair</b> counts distal to the OTC marks indicate one <b>band</b> <b>pair</b> (1 translucent and 1 opaque) form annually for Common Threshers of the size range examined in the NEPO.

40|$|We {{study the}} effect of doping away from half-filling in weakly (but finitely) {{interacting}} N-leg Hubbard ladders using renormalization group and bosonization techniques. For a small on-site repulsion U, the N-leg Hubbard ladders are equivalent to a N-band model, where at half-filling the Fermi velocities are v_{ 1 }=v_{N}<v_{ 2 }=v_{N- 1 }< [...] . We then obtain a hierarchy of energy-scales, where the <b>band</b> <b>pairs</b> (j,N+ 1 -j) are successively frozen out. The low-energy Hamiltonian is then the sum of N/ 2 (or (N- 1) / 2 for N odd) two-leg ladder Hamiltonians without gapless excitations (plus a single chain for N odd with one gapless spin mode), similar to the N-leg Heisenberg spin-ladders. The energy-scales lead to a hierarchy of gaps. Upon doping away from half-filling, the holes enter first the band(s) with the smallest gap: For odd N, the holes enter first the nonbonding band (N+ 1) / 2 and the phase is a Luttinger liquid, while for even N, the holes enter first the <b>band</b> <b>pair</b> (N/ 2,N/ 2 + 1) and the phase is a Luther-Emery liquid, similar to numerical treatments of the t-J model, i. e., at and close to half-filling, the phases of the Hubbard ladders for small and large U are the same. For increasing doping, hole-pairs subsequently enter at critical dopings the other <b>band</b> <b>pairs</b> (j,N+ 1 -j) (accompanied by a diverging compressibility) : The Fermi surface is successively opened by doping, starting near the wave vector (pi/ 2,pi/ 2).

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to use hyperspectral MIVIS data to map the Posidonia oceanica prairies in a coastal lagoon (Stagnone di Marsala). It is approximately 12 km long and 2 km wide and is linked to the open sea by two shallow openings. This environment is characterised by prairies of phanerogams, the most common of which is Posidonia oceanica, an ideal habitat for numerous species of fish, molluscs and crustaceans. A knowledge of the distribution of submerged vegetation is useful to monitor the health of the lagoon. In order to classify the MIVIS imagery, the attenuation effects of the water column have been removed from the signal using Lyzenga’s technique. A comparison between classifications using indices obtained using <b>band</b> <b>pairs</b> from only the first spectrometer, and using <b>band</b> <b>pairs</b> of the first and second spectrometers, shows that the best classification is obtained from some indices derived from the first spectrometer. Field controls carried out in July 2002 were used to determine the training sites for the supervised classification.

The methodology applied demonstrates that hyperspectral sensors can be used to effectively map submerged vegetation in shallow waters. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} {{dimensional}} crossover from 1 D to 2 D in half-filled and lightly doped, weakly interacting N-leg Hubbard ladders. In this case, the Hubbard ladders are {{equivalent to a}} N-band model. Using renormalization group techniques, we find, that the half-filled ladders exhibit (in the spin-sector) an odd-even effect only below a crossover energy E_c∝ exp[-a exp(c N) ] (a<< 1 and c∼ 1), i. e., below E_c, the interactions take place only within <b>band</b> <b>pairs</b> (j,N+ 1 -j) [and within the band (N+ 1) / 2 for N odd], such that even-leg ladders are an insulating spin-liquid, while odd-leg ladders have one gapless spinon-mode. In contrast, above the energy-scale E_c, all bands are interacting {{with each other and}} the system is a 2 D-like (insulating) antiferromagnet; we obtain an analytical expression for the Hamiltonian which is similar to the 2 D Heisenberg antiferromagnet. Bosonization techniques show, that the Mott insulator is as well below and above E_c of the same type as in N/ 2 half-filled two-leg ladders; the charge-sector is therefore the same in 1 D and 2 D. Doping away from half-filling, we find that the effect of an increasing doping is very similar to decreasing the number of legs N: In both cases interactions between unpaired bands are suppressed and the antiferromagnetic correlations are reduced. The resulting <b>band</b> <b>pairs</b> (j,N+ 1 -j) are then insulating spin-liquids and when doped, there is a spin-gap, but phase coherence exists only within pairs of Fermi momenta (k_Fj,pi-k_Fj) and (pi-k_Fj,k_Fj). At higher doping levels delta_c=delta_c(N), phase coherence between all bands sets in and the system becomes a 2 D-like d-wave superconductor (delta_c goes to 0 in the 2 D limit).
