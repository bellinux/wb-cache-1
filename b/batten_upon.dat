60|$|He {{was a good}} Catholic, and, moreover, a Catholic who did {{not take}} things for granted. The sloth and self-indulgence of the clergy in Portugal, being his first glimpse of conventuals in Latin countries, had deeply shocked him. The vows of a monastic poverty that was kept {{carefully}} beyond {{the walls of the}} monastery offended his sense of propriety. That men who had vowed themselves to pauperism, who wore coarse garments and went barefoot, should <b>batten</b> <b>upon</b> rich food and store up wines that gold could not purchase, struck him as a hideous incongruity.|$|E
6000|$|There was a {{time when}} I was the newly {{appointed}} occupant of a college chair and had to address the Owl's Club. It is a penalty that all new professors pay; and the Owls <b>batten</b> <b>upon</b> them like bats. It is one of the compensations of age that I am free of the Owl's Club forever. But in the days when I still had to address them, I used to {{take it out of the}} Owls in a speech, delivered, in imagination only and not out loud, to the assembled meeting of the seventeen Owls, after the chairman had made his concluding remarks. It ran as follows: ...|$|E
60|$|If I survive, I {{shall have}} Clinton to dinner: it is plain I must make hay while the sun shines; I shall not long keep a footing {{in the world}} of penny writers, or call them obolists. It is a world full of surprises, a romantic world. Weg, I was known there; even I. The obolists, then, {{sometimes}} peruse our works. It is only fair; since I so much <b>batten</b> <b>upon</b> theirs. Talking of which, in Heaven's name, get The Bondage of Brandon (3 vols.) by Bracebridge Hemming. It's the devil and all for drollery. There is a Superior (sic) of the Jesuits, straight out of Skelt.|$|E
6000|$|... 'There is {{a friend}} whom Sir Gervas Jerome did commend to my care,' I remarked; 'I have, however, already taken {{measures}} to have his wishes carried out. There is naught else save to assure all in Havant that a King who hath <b>battened</b> <b>upon</b> his subjects, as this one of ours hath done, is not one who is like to keep his seat very long upon the throne of England. When he falls I shall return, and perhaps it may be sooner than folk think.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It did not bleed," [...] he cut in, [...] "because {{you are not}} a knave. That is {{the only}} reason. This man who was here before you was an impious rogue. He was no priest. He was a {{follower}} of Simon Mage, trafficking in holy things, <b>battening</b> <b>upon</b> the superstition of poor humble folk. A black villain who is dead--dead and damned, for he was not allowed time when the end took him to confess his ghastly sin of sacrilege and the money that he had extorted by his simonies." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'OH, {{my friends}}, the down-trodden {{operatives}} of Coketown! Oh, {{my friends and}} fellow-countrymen, the slaves of an iron-handed and a grinding despotism! Oh, my friends and fellow-sufferers, and fellow-workmen, and fellow-men! I {{tell you that the}} hour is come, when we must rally round one another as One united power, and crumble into dust the oppressors that too long have <b>battened</b> <b>upon</b> the plunder of our families, upon the sweat of our brows, upon the labour of our hands, upon the strength of our sinews, upon the God- created glorious rights of Humanity, and upon the holy and eternal privileges of Brotherhood!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{differ from}} you, Anderson," [...] said Lord Menteith; [...] "I think this fellow Dalgetty {{is one of}} those horse-leeches, whose {{appetite}} for blood being only sharpened by what he has sucked in foreign countries, he is now returned to <b>batten</b> <b>upon</b> that of his own. Shame on the pack of these mercenary swordmen! they have made the name of Scot through all Europe equivalent to that of a pitiful mercenary, who knows neither honour nor principle but his month's pay, who transfers his allegiance from standard to standard, at the pleasure of fortune or the highest bidder; and to whose insatiable thirst for plunder and warm quarters we owe much of that civil dissension which is now turning our swords against our own bowels. I had scarce patience with the hired gladiator, and yet could hardly help laughing at the extremity of his impudence." ...|$|E
5000|$|In the {{following}} pages I have endeavoured to show the witch as she really was - an evil liver: a social pest and parasite: the devotee of a loathly and obscene creed: an adept at poisoning, blackmail, and other creeping crimes: {{a member of a}} powerful secret organisation inimical to Church and State: a blasphemer in word and deed, swaying the villagers by terror and superstition: a charlatan and a quack sometimes: a bawd: an abortionist: the dark counsellor of lewd court ladies and adulterous gallants: a minister to vice and inconceivable corruption, <b>battening</b> <b>upon</b> the filth and foulest passions of the age.|$|R
60|$|Typhus is the creature's name. At {{first it}} lurks there unnoticed, <b>battening</b> <b>upon</b> the rich, rank food it finds around it, until, grown {{too big to}} hide longer, it boldly shows its hideous head, and the white face of Terror runs swiftly through alley and street, crying as it runs, forces itself into John Ingerfield's counting-house, and tells its tale. John Ingerfield sits for a while thinking. Then he mounts his horse and rides home at as hard a pace as the {{condition}} of the streets will allow. In the hall he meets Anne going out, and stops her.|$|R
60|$|Upon one {{of these}} steps Tansey seated himself and bethought him of his love, and how she might never know she was his love. And of Mother Peek, fat, {{vigilant}} and kind; not unpleased, Tansey thought, that he and Katie should play cribbage in the parlour together. For the Cut-rate had not cut his salary, which, sordidly speaking, ranked him star boarder at the Peek's. And he thought of Captain Peek, Katie's father, a man he dreaded and abhorred; a genteel loafer and spendthrift, <b>battening</b> <b>upon</b> the labour of his women-folk; a very queer fish, and, according to repute, not of the freshest.|$|R
6000|$|... "She is {{fraudulent}} {{from beginning}} to end," [...] the writer passionately declared. [...] "From her heart outward she is as vile, as remorseless, as mysterious as a vampire. No one knows from what foul nest she sprang. She <b>battens</b> <b>upon</b> the sick, the world-weary, the sorrowing. Her hokus-pokus is so simple that it would deceive no one but those who are blinded by their own tears. She has just one human trait. She {{is said to be}} educating a son at an Eastern university on the profits of her vile trade. It is said that she is keeping him in ignorance of her way of life." ...|$|R
6000|$|Below the thunders of {{the upper}} deep; [...] Far, far beneath in the abysmal sea, [...] His antient, dreamless, uninvaded sleep [...] The Kraken sleepeth: faintest sunlights flee [...] About his shadowy sides: above him swell [...] Huge sponges of millennial growth and height; [...] And far away into the sickly light, [...] From many a wondrous grot and secret cell [...] Unnumber'd and {{enormous}} polypi [...] Winnow with giant arms the slumbering green. [...] There hath he lain for ages and will lie [...] <b>Battening</b> <b>upon</b> huge seaworms in his sleep, [...] Until the latter fire shall heat the deep; [...] Then once by man and angels to be seen, [...] In roaring he shall rise and on the surface die.|$|R
60|$|Gaston Isbel {{bowed to}} this ultimatum, {{scarcely}} less agitated than when Esther Isbel had denounced him. His rabid and morbid hate of Jorth had eaten into {{his heart to}} take possession there, like the parasite that <b>battened</b> <b>upon</b> the life of its victim. Blue's steely voice, his cold, gray eyes, showed the unbiased truth of the man, {{as well as his}} fidelity to his creed. Here again, but in a different manner, Gaston Isbel had the fact flung at him that other men must suffer, perhaps die, for his hate. And the very soul of the old rancher apparently rose in Passionate revolt against the blind, headlong, elemental strength of his nature. So it seemed to Jean, who, in love and pity that hourly grew, saw through his father. Was it too late? Alas! Gaston Isbel could never be turned back! Yet something was altering his brooding, fixed mind.|$|R
60|$|It {{was on a}} Monday {{evening that}} the Lord Chief Justice made his entry. From {{one of the windows}} of the room in which we were {{confined}} I saw him pass. First rode the dragoons with their standards and kettledrums, then the javelin-men with their halberds, and behind them the line of coaches full of the high dignitaries of the law. Last of all, drawn by six long-tailed Flemish mares, came a great open coach, thickly crusted with gold, in which, reclining amidst velvet cushions, sat the infamous Judge, wrapped in a cloak of crimson plush with a heavy white periwig upon his head, which was so long that it dropped down over his shoulders. They say that he wore scarlet in order to strike terror into the hearts of the people, and that his courts were for the same reason draped in the colour of blood. As for himself, it hath ever been the custom, since his wickedness hath come to be known to all men, to picture him as a man whose expression and features were as monstrous and as hideous as was the mind behind them. This {{is by no means the}} case. On the contrary, he was a man who, in his younger days, must have been remarkable for his extreme beauty.(1) He was not, it is true, very old, as years go, when I saw him, but debauchery and low living had left their traces upon his countenance, without, however entirely destroying the regularity and the beauty of his features. He was dark, more like a Spaniard than an Englishman, with black eyes and olive complexion. His expression was lofty and noble, but his temper was so easily aflame that the slightest cross or annoyance would set him raving like a madman, with blazing eyes and foaming mouth. I have seen him myself with the froth upon his lips and his whole face twitching with passion, like one who hath the falling sickness. Yet his other emotions were under as little control, for I have heard say that a very little would cause him to sob and to weep, more especially when he had himself been slighted by those who were above him. He was, I believe, a man who had great powers either for good or for evil, but by pandering to the darker side of his nature and neglecting the other, he brought himself to be as near a fiend as it is possible for a man to be. It must indeed have been an evil government where so vile and foul-mouthed a wretch was chosen out to hold the scales of justice. As he drove past, a Tory gentleman riding by the side of his coach drew his attention to the faces of the prisoners looking out at him. He glanced up at them with a quick, malicious gleam of his white teeth, then settled down again amongst the cushions. I observed that as he passed not a hat was raised among the crowd, and that even the rude soldiers appeared to look upon him half in terror, half in disgust, as a lion might look upon some foul, blood-sucking bat which <b>battened</b> <b>upon</b> the prey which he had himself struck down.|$|R
6000|$|Hermes. I have indeed, methinks, {{said much}} in vain, [...] For still thy heart beneath my showers of prayers [...] Lies dry and hard--nay, leaps {{like a young}} horse [...] Who bites against the new bit in his teeth, [...] And tugs and struggles against the new-tried rein,-- [...] Still fiercest in the feeblest thing of all, [...] Which sophism is; since {{absolute}} will disjoined [...] From perfect mind is worse than weak. Behold, [...] Unless my words persuade thee, what a blast [...] And whirlwind of inevitable woe [...] Must sweep persuasion through thee! For at first [...] The Father will split up this jut of rock [...] With the great thunder and the bolted flame [...] And hide thy body where a hinge of stone [...] Shall catch it like an arm; and when thou hast passed [...] A long black time within, thou shalt come out [...] To front the sun while Zeus's winged hound, [...] The strong carnivorous eagle, shall wheel down [...] To meet thee, self-called to a daily feast, [...] And set his fierce beak in thee and tear off [...] The long rags of thy flesh and <b>batten</b> deep [...] <b>Upon</b> thy dusky liver. Do not look [...] For any end moreover to this curse [...] Or ere some god appear, to accept thy pangs [...] On his own head vicarious, and descend [...] With unreluctant step the darks of hell [...] And gloomy abysses around Tartarus. [...] Then ponder this--this threat is not a growth [...] Of vain invention; it is spoken and meant; [...] King Zeus's mouth is impotent to lie, [...] Consummating the utterance by the act; [...] So, look to it, thou! take heed, and nevermore [...] Forget good counsel, to indulge self-will.|$|R
