5|$|Barkley's message {{sparked a}} great public {{debate about the}} nature of role models. He argued, I think the media demands that athletes be role models because there's some jealousy involved. It's as if they say, this is a young black kid playing a game for a living and making all this money, so we're going to make it tough on him. And what they're really doing is telling kids to look up to someone they can't become, because not many people can <b>be</b> <b>like</b> we are. Kids can't <b>be</b> <b>like</b> Michael Jordan.|$|E

Work on consciousness has typically dealt with the latter while employing the language of the former. I propose several ways of analyzing what it <b>is</b> <b>like</b> to <b>be</b> a certain kind of creature and find problems with them all. The upshot is that even if there is something it <b>is</b> <b>like</b> to have certain kinds of experience, it does not follow that there is anything it <b>is</b> <b>like</b> to <b>be</b> a certain kind of creature. Skepticism about the existence of something that it <b>is</b> <b>like</b> to <b>be</b> an F is recommended...|$|R

5|$|According to the NPD Group, Brütal Legend sold {{approximately}} 215,000 {{copies in}} the United States in October 2009, with about 150,000 copies being for the Xbox 360 platform, {{making it the}} 12th-top-selling game in that month. These numbers were {{not considered to be}} strong, and were attributed to the difficult marketing of the game, which emphasized Jack Black's involvement and the heavy metal nature of the game, but did not assert what the gameplay would actually <b>be</b> <b>like,</b> with the possibility that the mention of the RTS elements of the game would have possibly driven more players away from the game. In an interview in February 2011, Schafer claimed that the game had sold over 1.4 million copies. According to data collected through Nielsen SoundScan, some songs contained within Brütal Legends soundtrack saw digital sales increases of up to 700% following the game's release, similar to the effects of Guitar Hero and Rock Band, though impact on overall sales of these songs was rather small.|$|E
