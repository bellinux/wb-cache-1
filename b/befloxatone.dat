40|$|Synthelabo is {{developing}} <b>befloxatone,</b> a long-acting selective and reversible monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) inhibitor, {{for the treatment}} of depression, social phobias and panic disorders. Phase III trials have commenced in France for depression. In 1995, phase II trials began in Europe and the US {{for the treatment of}} depression, social phobias and panic disorders. The results of a dose-ranging study conducted in Europe in patients with major depressive disorders confirmed the product's safety. <b>Befloxatone</b> has a good safety profile, lacking sedative, convulsant, anticholinergic and cardiovascular effects [...] particularly important is its negligible tyramine effect. Results from phase I trials suggest that it will be suitable for once-daily oral dosage. It has an elimination half-life of approximately 11 h in man and is rapidly absorbed with a Tmax of around 2. 5 h. In a trial of <b>befloxatone</b> in 12 healthy elderly volunteers, an oral dose of 10 mg was administered and psychomotor and cognitive function were assessed using objective tests such as critical flicker fusion (CFF), body sway and learning memory tasks amongst others and subjective tests such as the visual analog scale and a sleep questionnaire. Using these criteria, the 10 mg dose of <b>befloxatone</b> was shown not to produce any detrimental effects in skilled performance while a significant improvement in long term memory was shown. It appears to have no significant effects on skilled performance, memory or sleep patterns. [11 C]-befloxatone was evaluated and found to be an excellent ligand for the study of MAO-A by positron emission tomography...|$|E

40|$|International audienceIt {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the beta-carbolines harmane and norharmane may be involved in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease, psychosis and addiction, but the mechanisms of these possible effects remain to be elucidated. In the present study, the effects of the two compounds were examined by using in vivo extracellular recordings of ventral tegmental dopamine neurons. The effects of harmane (2 mg/kg) and norharmane (2 mg/kg), were compared to those of nicotine (11 microg/kg), of cotinine (0. 5 mg/kg), of the monoamine-oxidase-A inhibitor <b>befloxatone</b> (0. 12 mg/kg), and of the monoamine-oxidase-B inhibitor selegiline (0. 5 mg/kg). The effects of harmane were also tested after pre-treatment with the nicotine receptor antagonist mecamylamine. The results show that all substances, except <b>befloxatone,</b> activate the firing and/or burst activity of dopamine neurons. The increase in firing rate produced by harmane was approximately 18 times greater than that produced by nicotine. Such powerful excitation of dopamine neurons by harmane may in part explain its involvement in neurotoxicity, psychosis and addiction. The absence of effect of <b>befloxatone</b> supports the hypothesis that the effect of harmane is not related to its monoamine-oxidase-A inhibitory properties. Mecamylamine inhibited by approximately 80 % the activity of harmane, indicating that the activating effect of harmane on dopamine neurons involves several mechanisms, among which activation of nicotinic receptors likely has a prominent importance. The {{results of the present study}} support the hypothesis that harmane could be a tobacco (or smoke) component other than nicotine involved in tobacco dependence...|$|E
40|$|C- 11]befloxatone is a high-affinity, reversible, and {{selective}} radioligand for the in vivo visualization of the monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) binding sites using {{positron emission tomography}} (PET). The multi-injection approach was used to study in baboons the interactions between the MAO-A binding sites and [C- 11] <b>befloxatone.</b> The model included four compartments and seven parameters. The arterial plasma concentration, corrected for metabolites, was used as input function. The experimental protocol-three injections of labeled and/or unlabeled befloxatone-allowed the evaluation of all the model parameters from a single PET experiment. In particular, the brain regional concentrations of the MAO-A binding sites (B-max(')) and the apparent in vivo <b>befloxatone</b> affinity (K-d) were estimated in vivo for the first time. A high binding site density was found in almost all the brain structures (170 +/- 39 and 194 +/- 26 pmol/mL in the frontal cortex and striata, respectively, n = 5). The cerebellum presented the lowest binding site density (66 +/- 13 pmol/mL). Apparent affinity {{was found to be}} similar in all structures (KdVR = 6. 4 +/- 1. 5 nmol/L).

40|$|A novel {{series of}} 5 -substituted- 3 -(1 H-pyrrol- 2 -yl) - 2 -oxazolidinones 2 a-s has been {{described}} as pyrrole analogues of toloxatone and <b>befloxatone,</b> two phenyl-oxazolidinones active as anti-MAO agents and used in antidepressant therapy. Tested against MAO-A and MAO-B enzymes, the majority of 2 a-s show highly potent inhibitory effect against the A isoform of the enzyme, with Ki values in the range 0. 52 - 0. 004 μM, whilst their anti-MAO-B activity is considerably lower (Ki = > 100 - 0. 5 μM). Structurally, 2 a-s differs for the substituent inserted at the C 5 position of the 2 - oxazolidinone ring (hydroxymethyl (2 a-d), methoxymethyl (2 e-h), azidomethyl (2 i-l), methylaminomethyl (2 m-p), and aminomethyl (2 q-s)), {{and the size of the}} alkyl chain at the pyrrole N 1 position (methyl, ethyl, allyl, or benzyl). As a rule, apart from the C 5 substitution, the bulkier is the alkyl group at the pyrrole-N 1, the lower is the anti-MAO-A activity of the compounds, being the N 1 -methyl derivatives 2 a, 2 e, 2 i, and 2 q among the most potent (KiMAO-A = 0. 087 - 0. 004 μM) and A-selective (A-selectivity ratio: > 11, 111 - 41) compounds in this series. Exceptions are represented by the N 1 -benzyl derivative 2 d (KiMAO-A = 0. 009 μM) and the N 1 -allylpyrrole 2 o (KiMAO-A = 0. 04 μM). In comparison with the reference drugs, these highly active derivatives are more potent than toloxatone, slightly less potent than <b>befloxatone,</b> and several times more A-selective than both the references. Such results indicate that 2 a-s may represent a new promising series of antidepressant agents...|$|E

In particular, nonsaturable uptake, obtained after a pretreatment {{with a high}} dose of unlabeled <b>befloxatone,</b> is very low and represents only 3 % of the total uptake [12]. [11 C]Befloxatone has good imaging characteristics and {{has been used in}} positron emission tomography (PET) studies to quantify in vivo MAO-A in rats [13], nonhuman primates [12, 14], and humans. In humans, it has been used to compare MAO-A binding potential in smokers and nonsmokers [7]; however, a rigorous kinetic modeling study in humans has never been performed. This paper sought to (1) quantify the uptake of [11 C]befloxatone in the human brain, both at the regional and voxel level, using an arterial input function; and (2) explore the possibility of replacing the arterial input function with a less invasive approach based on sampling of arterialized venous blood.|$|E
30|$|The whole plasma time-activity curves {{were taken}} as input {{functions}} {{because in a}} previous series of (yet unpublished) four human scans from our laboratory, chromatograms obtained with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) did not show any detectable radiometabolites in the plasma, even at late time points. The technique we {{used to measure the}} amount of unchanged radiotracer in the plasma was similar to that described in [14]. Specifically, after deproteinization with acetonitrile, the samples were centrifuged and the supernatant was injected directly into the HPLC column. A reverse-phase μBondapak C 18 column (300 [*]×[*] 7.8  mm, 10  μm; Waters, Milford, MA, USA) was eluted applying a gradient from 20 % acetonitrile in 0.01  M phosphoric acid up to 80 % in 5.5  min, to 90 % at 7.5  min, and returning to 20 % at 7.6  min with a total run length of 10  min.

40|$|Monoamine oxidase A (MAO A) catalyses the {{oxidation}} of both neurotransmitter and ingested amines. The {{mechanism of}} catalysis involves the covalently bound FAD cofactor. Although substrates and inhibitors alter the thermodynamic and kinetic {{properties of the}} flavin, how the ligands interact with the flavin is unknown. This work characterises the spectral changes that occur on inhibitor binding to MAO A and examines how the binding influences the flavin. The inhibitors, D-amphetamine, harmine, tetrindole, and <b>befloxatone</b> all induce similar (but not identical) changes in the spectrum of MAO A, consistent with stacking of inhibitor with the flavin in the active site. D-Amphetamine, harmine, and tetrindole stabilise the semiquinone form of FAD during reduction of MAO A by dithionite and no further reduction of these inhibitor-MAO A complexes has been observed. In contrast, semiquinone is never observed during reduction of the befloxatone-MAO A complex. Instead, partial reduction directly to the FADH, form occurs extremely slowly. Thus, inhibitor binding has a strong, structure-dependent influence on {{the environment of the}} flavin that alters its electronic properties. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V.

40|$|In {{the last}} few years, {{a growing body of}} {{evidence}} revealed the involvement of the serotonin (5 -HT) system in the therapeutic effect of antidepressant treatments. Hence, several investigations have suggested that long-term treatments with various classes of antidepressant drugs lead to an enhanced 5 -HT neurotransmission. By using electrophysiological paradigms in the rat, the present research endeavour was undertaken to (1) investigate the role of different factors modulating central 5 -HT neurotransmission and to assess interactions between the 5 -HT and noradrenergic (NA) systems; (2) to further confirm the presence of an enhanced 5 -HT neurotransmission following chronic antidepressant treatments. The study of the automodulation of 5 -HT system via 5 -HT 3 / 4 receptor subtypes suggested that the suppressant effect, observed in vivo, of the prototypical 5 -HT 3 receptor agonist 2 -methyl- 5 -HT on the firing activity of somatosensory and hippocampus pyramidal neurons was not mediated via 5 -HT 3 receptors but rather via 5 -HT 1 A receptors. In contrast, the enhancing effect, observed in vitro, of 2 -methyl- 5 -HT on the electrically-evoked release of [3 H]- 5 -HT was mediated via 5 -HT 3 receptors. The reducing action of the 5 -HT 3 / 4 receptor ligand R-zacopride on the endogenous release of 5 -HT induced by the electrical stimulation of the ascending 5 -HT pathway was mediated via 5 -HT 4 receptors. The studies of the heteromodulation of 5 -HT system induced by the alpha 2 -adrenoceptor antagonist mirtazapine showed that acute administration of mirtazapine produced a transient increase of the firing activity of dorsal raphe 5 -HT and locus coeruleus NA neurons whereas long-term mirtazapine treatment produced a sustained increase of the firing activity of these two types of neurons. Both acute and chronic administration of mirtazapine antagonized the activation of alpha 2 -adrenergic auto- and heteroreceptors in the dorsal hippocampus. The sustained enhancement of the firing activity of 5 -HT and NA neurons and the desensitization of alpha 2 -adrenergic heteroreceptors on 5 -HT terminals produced by long-term mirtazapine administration have been proposed to underlie the antidepressant activity of this drug. The study of the modulation of the 5 -HT system via monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A) inhibition revealed that short-term administration of the selective and reversible MAO-A inhibitor <b>befloxatone</b> reduced the firing activity of 5 -HT neurons which is followed by a recovery after its long-term administration. Given that the firing activity of 5 -HT neurons was even above the control value following short-term treatment with both <b>befloxatone</b> and the 5 -HT 1 A receptor antagonist ( [...] ) pindolol, it is sug...|$|E
40|$|We report {{here the}} first direct {{functional}} {{evidence of an}} increase in the tonic activation of postsynaptic 5 -HT 1 A receptors by antidepressant treatments. Because 5 -HT 1 A receptor activation hyperpolarizes and inhibits CA 3 pyramidal neurons in the dorsal hippocampus, we determined, using in vivo extracellular recording, whether the selective 5 -HT 1 A receptor antagonist WAY 100635 could disinhibit these neurons. Unexpectedly, no disinhibition could be detected in controls. However, after long-term treatment with the tricyclic antidepressant imipramine, the selective 5 -HT reuptake inhibitor paroxetine, the reversible monoamine oxidase-A inhibitor <b>befloxatone,</b> the � 2 -adrenergic antagonist mirtazapine, or the 5 -HT 1 A receptor agonist gepirone or multiple electroconvulsive shock (ECS) administration, WAY 100635 markedly increased (60 – 200 %) the firing activity of CA 3 pyramidal neurons. Such a disinhibition was absent in rats treated with the nonantidepressant drug chlorpromazine, in rats receiving only one ECS, or in rats receiving multiple ECSs in combination with an intrahippocampal pertussis toxin treatment to inactivate G i/o-coupled 5 -HT 1 A receptors. These data indicate that such antidepressant treatments, acting on entirely different primary targets, might alleviate depression by enhancing the tonic activation of forebrain postsynaptic 5 -HT 1 A receptors...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of resistance by the antibiotics in the Gram-positive pathogenic bacteria {{over the last}} twenty years and continuing today has created a need for new antibiotic classes, which may be unaffected by existing bacterial resistance. The oxazolidin- 2 -ones represent not only a new class with a novel mechanism of action, but also satisfy the requirement for overcoming the resistance mechanisms. Both linezolid and eperozolid, the first chemical candidates, arose from the piperazine subclass, with the first one being chosen further development because of its enhanced pharmacokinetic properties. The main attractive traits of the oxazolidinone series has encouraged further work in the area, and the patent literature reveals that extensive chemical investigation is currently being made. The unexpected early resistance development emphasizes the need for further exploration of features of the oxazolidinone to eliminate these deficiencies. Recently, several changes, involving the C 5 side chain as well the N-phenyl heterocyclic ring, give promise for such improvement. Oxazolidinone antibacterial agents comprise also ketolides, derivatives of macrolides, such as erythromycin A, with a newly formed carbamate cycle, with a largely unexplored potential. The oxazolidinone nucleus does not appear only in the structures of antimicrobial drugs, but a number of biological activities are connected with frameworks including the oxazolidinone ring. A partial list of these activities comprises enzyme inhibitors, agonists and antagonists, with a particular citation {{for a new generation of}} selective monoamino oxidase inhibitors (<b>befloxatone).</b> The oxazolidinone moiety was found in the structure of few biologically active natural products, such as (-) -cytoxazone and streptazolin. Moreover, in some cases the oxazolidinone ring has been chosen for the preparation of isosteric aza analogues of natural compounds (podophyllotoxin, pilocarpine) that can be more easily synthesised and more hardly inactivated. Finally, the participation of oxazolidinone chiral auxiliaries to several syntheses of natural products must be acknowledged...|$|E
