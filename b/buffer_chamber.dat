40|$|This work {{describes}} an organic molecular beam deposition system with substrate entry/exit chamber, <b>buffer</b> <b>chamber</b> {{and with the}} possibility to transfer substrate from a III–V molecular beam deposition system. Flux calibrations of organic molecules and the initial growth of organic layers are described. For this purpose, the molecules 3, 4, 9, 10 perylene tetra carboxylic dianhydride and copper phtalocyanine were used. Layers were grown on oxidized and hydrogen passivated Si(100), Indium tin oxide and glass respectively. The growth was investigated with atomic force microscopy, reflection {{high energy electron diffraction}} and ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy. An investigation with x-ray photoelectron and Raman spectroscopy on the effect of atmospheric exposure is also included, showing little effect of surface pollution when the samples were handled carefully.

40|$|AbstractBased on the {{structure}} of a certain type of aviation axial-piston pump’s valve plate which adopts a pre-pressurization fluid path (consisting a damping hole, a <b>buffer</b> <b>chamber,</b> and an orifice) to reduce flow ripple, a single-piston model of the aviation axial-piston pump is presented. This single-piston model comprehensively considers fluid compressibility, orifice restriction effect, fluid resistance in the capillary tube, and the leakage flow. Besides, the instantaneous discharge areas used in the single-piston model have been calculated in detail. Based on the single-piston model, a multi-piston pump model has been established according to the simple hydraulic circuit. The single- and multi-piston pump models have been realized by the S-function in Matlab/Simulink. The developed multi-piston pump model has been validated by being compared with the numerical result by computational fluid dynamic (CFD). The effects of the pre-pressurization fluid path on the flow ripple and the instantaneous pressure in the piston chamber have been studied and optimized design recommendations for the aviation axial-piston pump have been given out...|$|E

40|$|High {{throughput}} DNA sequencing {{has been}} performed {{by using a}} microfabricated 96 -channel radial capillary array electrophoresis (μCAE) microchannel plate detected by a 4 -color rotary confocal fluorescence scanner. The microchannel plate features a novel injector for uniform sieving matrix loading as well as high resolution, tapered turns that provide an effective separation length of 15. 9 cm on a compact 150 -mm diameter wafer. Expanded common <b>buffer</b> <b>chambers</b> for the cathode, anode, and waste reservoirs are used to simplify electrode addressing and to counteract buffering capacity depletion arising from the high electrophoretic current. DNA sequencing data from 95 successful lanes out of 96 lanes run in parallel were batch-processed with basefinder, producing an average read length of 430 bp (phred q ≥ 20). Phred quality values were found to exceed 40 (0. 01 % probability of incorrectly calling a base) for over 80 % of the read length. The μCAE system demonstrated here produces sequencing data {{at a rate of}} 1. 7 kbp/min, a 5 -fold increase over current commercial capillary array electrophoresis technology. Additionally, this system permits lower reagent volumes and lower sample concentrations, and it presents numerous possibilities for integrated sample preparation and handling.

40|$|Maximizing {{equipment}} throughput on multi-chambered cluster tools is {{an ongoing}} objective for semiconductor fabs. The increasing use of dual-armed robots {{and the need to}} process multiple products simultaneously complicates this objective. Typically, when a new processing technology is introduced, one chamber inside the tool is dedicated to the new process, while the other chambers are assigned to run normal production wafers. This results in multiple wafer flows or “parallel routes ” within the tool. Determining and implementing optimal robot schedulers to efficiently handle the complexities within the tool is key to maximizing equipment throughput. This paper introduces the components of a multi-chambered cluster tool and discusses how simulation was used at Infineon to develop, test, and optimize efficient wafer selection rules. Several real-world cases are detailed and reported. into one of the load ports in front of the tool, and will remain at the tool until all wafers complete the processing requirements. The EFEM consists of an atmospheric robot (and possibly an aligner and/or <b>buffer</b> <b>chamber),</b> and is responsible for moving wafers between the respective FOUP and the load locks. An atmospheric robot may service up to four load port positions. Figure 1 illustrates the basic components of a cluster tool. ...|$|E
40|$|Molecular beam {{epitaxial}} (MBE) {{growth and}} lasing operation of quaternary GaInAsSb/AlGaAsSb-based optically-pumped vertical-external-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VECSEL) emitting at a wavelength of 2. 0 ?m are reported. MBE growth of such structures is particularly challenging as it requires, {{apart from the}} large total thickness of the epitaxial layer stack of 10 – 12 ?m a change of group-III fluxes {{for the growth of}} AlAsSb and low Al-content AlGaAsSb. Two different growth schemes are compared. The first one is the conventional growth procedure in which the wafer remains in the growth chamber and the growth is interrupted at the interfaces before and after the active region to adjust the group-III cell temperatures for different flux settings. At the interfaces where the growth had to be interrupted, secondary-ion mass-spectrometry revealed the unintentional incorporation of In at a concentration equivalent to 1 – 2 monolayers. Here we introduce a new growth procedure—the sequential growth scheme where each section of the VECSEL is grown separately, and after the growth of a section, the sample is taken out of the growth chamber and stored in the <b>buffer</b> <b>chamber</b> while the group-III cell temperatures are adjusted. After the new group-III fluxes have been stabilized, the wafer is transferred back into the growth chamber and the next section of the laser is grown. This way the unintentional incorporation of In at interfaces between different sections of the VECSEL structure can be avoided. A comparison of nominally identical VECSEL structures grown within the same growth campaign using the two different growth procedures reveals an increase of the maximum output power of nearly 100 % for a 2. 0 ?m emitting VECSEL structure grown with the sequential growth scheme accompanied by an improvement of the optical-to-optical power conversion efficiency from 14. 4 % to 21. 5 %...|$|E
5000|$|To perform SCODA {{concentration}} of DNA molecules the sample must be {{embedded in the}} separation media (gel) in locations where the electrophoretic field is of optimal intensity. This initial translocation of the sample into the optimal concentration position {{is referred to as}} [...] "injection". The optimal position is determined by the gel geometry and location of the SCODA driving electrodes. Initially the sample is located in a buffer solution in the sample chamber, adjacent to the concentration gel. Injection is achieved by the application of a controlled DC electrophoretic field across the sample chamber which results in all charged particles being transferred into the concentration gel. To obtain a good stacking of the sample (i.e. tight DNA band) multiple methods can be employed. One example is to exploit the conductivity ratio between the sample <b>chamber</b> <b>buffer</b> and the concentration gel buffer. If the sample <b>chamber</b> <b>buffer</b> has a low conductivity and the concentration gel buffer has a high conductivity this results in a sharp drop off in electric field at the gel-buffer interface which promotes stacking.|$|R

40|$|Bradykinin {{has been}} shown to have a {{positive}} modulatory role in the ovulatory process. In the present study, the contractile properties elicited by bradykinin (10 ~ 12 - 10 ~ 5 M) in the isolated human follicular wall were examined. Strips from the follicular base and apex were mounted separately and supervised at 37 °C with oxygenated HEPES <b>buffer</b> in tissue <b>chambers.</b> The contractile activity was recorded isometrically by a force transducer (Grass model FT 03), under a passive tension of 5 mN. Preovulatory follicles (cycle day 10 - 14) were more sensitive to bradykinin than follicles of an earlier developmental stage (cycle day 1 - 9). The response to bradykinin was not altered by the addition of indomethacin (10 ~ 7 M), atropine (10 ~ 6 M) or phenoxy-henzamine (10 7 M). These data suggest that the contraction caused by bradykinin is a specific effect, which, under physiological conditions, might contribute to the ovulatory process by inducing a rise in tone in the follicle thereby facilitating the extrusion of the oocyte through the digested follicular apex.

50|$|In an Advanced Primer Ignition Blowback design {{such as the}} MK 108, {{this problem}} is {{prevented}} by using a longer chamber, which allows the cartridge {{to enter into the}} chamber a small distance past the breech face. When the trigger is pressed, the bolt is moved forward by expansion of the <b>buffer</b> spring. It <b>chambers</b> the cartridge, but instead of coming to rest against the breech face, it follows the case a small distance into the chamber. A cartridge case with a rebated rim is used, so that the extractor claw can hook over the rim and still fit within the chamber. Primer ignition is timed so that the bolt is still moving forward when the propellant is ignited. The expanding gases from the fired round stop the forward motion of the bolt, then reverse its motion, expelling it from the chamber, along with the spent cartridge case, which, as the bolt moves rearward, strikes the ejector, throwing it from the mechanism. The heavy bolt continues rearward, compressing the buffer spring, which then expands, pushing the bolt forward again, picking up a fresh cartridge from the magazine (or belt in a belt-fed weapon) and chambering it. This cycle of events continues until the trigger is released. Before this sequence of events occurs, the projectile has already left the muzzle, allowing the propellant gas to escape, reducing the chamber pressure to a safe level.|$|R
40|$|Laboratory {{diagnostics}} are {{an essential}} and indispensible component of modern medicine. Large central laboratories {{have led to}} vast improvements {{in health care and}} now {{play a key role in}} the diagnosis and monitoring of therapy. Recent trends, however, indicate a rising need for on-site testing, for instance, in medical practices, operating theatres, outpatient clinics or emergency rooms. Cleverly engineered, compact products made possible due to advances in nanotechnology, molecular diagnostics, information technology and microfluidics can now meet this demand. These portable devices offer immediate access to a range of diagnostic parameters and thus help the medical caregiver to diagnose a case faster and make timely decisions about therapy. The commercial availability of compact and portable diagnostic devices has led to the widespread practice of what is now termed ‘Point-of-Care Testing’ (POCT). In this work, a microfluidic based platform for sensitive and quantitative detection of diagnostic targets suitable for POCT is reported. The analyte particles are detected through a magnetic bead based fluorescence sandwich immunoassay. The beads constitute both the solid phase for immobilization of capture molecules and enable active manipulation by external magnetic fields. Rather than pumping various assay <b>buffers</b> into a <b>chamber,</b> the solid phase is moved through stationary aqueous buffer contained in several chambers. This is done by focusing the beads into a tiny aggregate, which then is moved through capillary stop valve structures separating the chambers. After traversing such a valve, the bead aggregate is re-dispersed to form pearl-chain microstirrers using rotating magnetic field actuation. In this way efficient and fast incubation and washing procedures are enabled. The assay scheme includes i) incubation of the sample with beads, ii) washing, iii) labeling with fluorescence detection antibody and iv) fluorescence detection. The cartridge itself is manufactured by cost effective microinjection molding and the periphery consist of magnets mounted onto translational stages. The assays chosen for the evaluation included a biomarker (Interleukin- 8) and a viral pathogen (Hepatitis A Virus), which yielded detection limits of 1. 49 pg/mL (0. 188 pM) for the biomarker assay and 104 virus particles/ml for the virus assay. The biomarker assay run on the platform was as sensitive as the reference method (Luminex) and the virus assay showed an improvement in sensitivity in comparison to the employed reference (ELISA). With the biomarker assay though the assay time was not decreased, the total hands-on time and handling was reduced due to the automatisation. The virus assay demonstrated a 17. 5 times increase in sensitivity compared to the reference method and was three times faster...|$|R

Investigators must be aware that {{they will need to}} tailor the following protocol for their own research objectives and tissue under study*. This method is used to detect genomic DNA deletions in tumor cells. For a more detailed discussion of applying this approach to microdissected samples, see [Allelic Loss Studies]([URL] in [Prostate MP at NCI]([URL] ### Reagents 1. DNA sample (see [Processing of Microdissected Tissue - DNA-based Analysis]([URL] - Proteinase K (Sigma) - Proteinase K buffer (0. 05 M tris-HCL, 0. 001 M EDTA, 1 % Tween 20, 0. 1 mg/ml proteinase K, pH 8. 0) - Ampli Taq Gold Buffer (Perkin Elmer) - dNTP mixture (Perkin Elmer) - Primers - DEPC-treated H 2 O - Ampli Taq Gold Polymerase (Perkin Elmer) - a- 32 P dCTP, 6000 Ci/mmol (NEN Dupont) - Formamide, 99 % (Fluka) - Bromophenol blue-Xylene cyanole (Sigma), reconstituted as directed - Gel Mix- 6 sequencing gel solution (Life Technologies) - Ammonium persulfate (Biorad) - 10 X TBE buffer (0. 89 M Tris Base, 0. 89 M Boric Acid 0. 02 M Disodium EDTA) (Advanced Biotechnologies) - Acrylease (Stratagene) - Glass cleaner (e. g., Windex, Glass Plus) - 95 % ethanol ### Equipment 1. Thermal cycler (MJ Research) - Sequencing gel electrophoresis apparatus (Gibco BRL) - High voltage power supply - Gel dryer (Life Technologies) - Glass plates, 31. 0 x 38. 5 cm (Life Technologies) - 0. 4 mm spacers (Life Technologies) - Casting boot (Life Technologies) - Shark tooth comb (Life Technologies) - Small clamps - Whatman blotting paper, 3 mm thickness - Kodak Biomax MR or AR film - Film cassette (Amersham Life Science) - Film processor ### Time Requirements 1. Gel preparation: 1. 5 - 2 hours. Polymerization requires 1 hour, but may stand overnight. - LOH reactions: 2. 5 hours (approximately 1 hour for set-up, 1. 5 for PCR) - High-resolution denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis: 1 - 3 hours. Twenty minutes for set-up. Electrophoresis time varies according to product size. - Gel drying: 1 hour - Autoradiography: 1 hour- 2 days ### Methods *TIP: Investigators must be especially careful when using this methodology to analyze archival tissue specimens. Formalin fixation in particular results in DNA that is difficult to amplify and often produces inconsistent PCR results, including artifactual allelic loss and poor amplification of large products. Therefore, when this technique is used to analyze archival samples, it is highly recommended that replicate experiments (multiple independent dissections, triplicate PCR reactions, etc.) be used to verify results*. **A: LCM and Proteinase K Treatment** 1. Obtain microdissected cells using the [LCM procedure]([URL] - *TIP: The number of cells needed to successfully perform the assay varies depending on the quality and processing conditions of the tissue samples. One thousand cells is recommended as a good starting point*. - Suspend approximately 1000 microdissected cells in 20 µl proteinase K buffer. - Incubate overnight at 37 °C. **B: Prepare the Glass Plates** *TIP: Use Accuwipes for cleaning purposes, as they will not leave lint behind and are non-abrasive*. 1. Clean glass plates twice with glass cleaner. - Repeat using 95 % EtOH. - Spray small plate with Acrylease. - Spread Acrylease evenly using a circular motion. - Buff dry. - Quickly assemble the plates without touching the clean surface. - Place 0. 4 mm spacers on the edges of the larger plate. - Place the smaller glass plate on top of the larger plate and spacers. - Secure the plates with a casting boot (tape or clamps may be substituted for the casting boot). **C: Polymerize the Gel** *TIP: Acrylamide is a neurotoxin. Be sure to wear gloves and a labcoat when working with this substance*. 1. Add 480 µl of 10 % ammonium persulfate to 75 ml of Gel-mix- 6. - Mix by inversion. - Hold the nozzle of the bottle {{at the corner of the}} gel cast. - Hold the gel cast at a 45 o angle to the bench and pour the gel between the plates. If bubbles get trapped between the plates, remove them by tapping the outside of the plates or by tipping the plates upright. - Insert the straight side of the comb approximately 1 cm into the gel. If bubbles are introduced at this point, remove the comb and use the teeth of the comb to sweep out small bubbles. - Clamp the top of the plates together. - Allow the gel to polymerize for at least one hour. - *TIP: The gel can be left to polymerize overnight. However, if bubbles appear, the gel has begun to separate from the plates. To minimize separation, wrap the gel in plastic film and store at 4 °C until use*. **D: PCR Reaction** *TIP: Investigators must be especially careful when using this methodology to analyze archival tissue specimens. Formalin fixation in particular results in DNA that is difficult to amplify and often produces inconsistent PCR results, including artifactual allelic loss and poor amplification of large products. If this technique is to be utilized for analysis of archival samples, we highly recommend that replicate experiments (multiple independent dissections, triplicate PCR reactions, etc.) be used to verify results*. 1. Remove reagents from the freezer before beginning the procedure. - Thaw thoroughly before use. - Prepare all reactions on ice. - Prepare the reduced cytosine mixture prior to beginning the LOH reaction setup. - Vortex all reagents, with the exception of Taq Gold Polymerase before beginning the PCR reaction setup. - Prepare 320 µl reduced nucleotide mixture: ![Table 1]([URL] "Table 1 ") 3. Aliquot 1 µl of each DNA sample into a separate PCR tube and set aside. - *TIP: DNA that is recovered from microdissected samples and "semi-purified" using a one-step proteinase K buffer will sometimes produce "non-specific" PCR products in addition to the true alleles. Moreover, larger alleles will sometimes amplify much less well than smaller alleles. Thus, normal-cell DNA recovered from the same tissue section as the tumor DNA serves as the best control for determining the presence or absence of allelic loss*. 4. Prepare sufficient volume of the reaction mixture in a separate tube for all reaction tubes: ![Table 2]([URL] "Table 2 ") 5. Thoroughly mix the reaction mixture by pipetting and dispense 9 µl of the reaction mixture into each tube containing DNA sample. - *TIP: Be sure to mix the LOH reaction mixture with the DNA sample by pipetting. This is especially critical for DNA from microdissected samples that has been processed through a one-step proteinase K-based "purification. "* 6. Cap the reaction tubes and place them in a thermal cycler. 7. Cycle the reactions according to Tm of the specific primer set. 8. After PCR, remove the samples from the thermal cycler and dispense 2 µl of formamide/dye solution (95 % formamide, 20 mM EDTA, 0. 05 % bromophenol blue, 0. 05 % xylenecyanole) into each reaction tube. 9. Store reactions at 4 °C until the gel is ready for loading. - *TIP: Investigators may want to consider the "touchdown" procedure for PCR by Don RH, Cox PT, Wainwright BJ, Baker K, Mattick JS: "Touchdown" PCR to circumvent spurious priming during gene amplification. Nucl Acids Res 19 : 4008, 1991. Advantages include*: - Much cleaner bands, since by starting with a high annealing temperature of 66 degrees and lowering 1 degree every cycle, the first PCR products are the most specific ones. - The exact same protocol can be used for all primers. **E: Finalize Gel Preparation** 1. Remove the gel from the casting boot. - Push the spacers into the gel until they are flush with the smaller glass plate to prevent the buffer from leaking during electrophoresis (spacers tend to get pushed out of the gel during polymerization). - Place the gel in the sequencing apparatus and close the buffer release valve. - Pour 500 ml of 0. 5 X TBE buffer in the upper chamber and 500 ml of 1 X TBE buffer in the lower chamber. - Remove the comb and clear bubbles from the loading area with a pipette. - Insert the teeth of the comb approximately 1 mm into the gel. - Pre-heat the gel at 1700 volts for 15 - 20 minutes. **F: Gel Loading** 1. Remove the samples from the freezer. - Denature the samples in a thermal cycler at 95 °C for 5 mins. - Remove samples from the thermal cycler and immediately place on ice, with an ice pack on top of the samples, for 1 min. - Turn off the power supply. - Adjust comb if it has been pushed out of the gel during pre-heating. - Load 4 µl of each sample per well. - TIP: It is best to skip lanes to avoid contamination caused by leaking between the wells. - Run the gel at 1700 volts for 1 - 2 hours (running time based on PCR product size). **G: Separate the Gel** 1. Turn off the power supply. - Drain <b>buffer</b> <b>chambers</b> (<b>buffer</b> must be disposed of in a liquid radioactive waste carboy). - Remove the gel from the sequencing apparatus. - Separate the plates by removing the spacers and inserting the tips of two thin spatulas in their place. - Gently lift the spatulas until the top plate separates from the lower plate and gel. - Place Whatman paper on the gel. - Slowly peel the Whatman paper and gel off the glass plate. - Cover the gel with plastic wrap and dry on a gel dryer for 1 hour. **H: Autoradiography** 1. Remove the plastic wrap from the gel. - Place the gel in an autoradiography cassette. - Expose film 1 hour- 2 days using Kodak BioMax MR or AR film. - *TIP: Use MR film for maximum resolution of bands. An intensifying screen is useful when analyzing PCR products from small numbers of microdissected cells*. ### References 1.
