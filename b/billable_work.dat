40|$|Construction {{organizations}} {{carry out}} projects {{in areas such}} as residential and commercial building, industrial plants, healthcare and education. Companies bid on projects and expect to obtain a profit that is the difference between the revenues they obtain from the owners of the projects and the cost that is incurred on them to execute the project according to the schedule, quality and safety required. The intent of the study is to develop a protocol for data collection and profitability analysis in order to assess the overall profitability of construction firms. This research states that a construction company is a profit generating entity that is composed of profit centers and cost centers that interact {{with each other and with}} entities outside the company. A profit center is an entity that creates <b>billable</b> <b>work</b> that is reimbursed by the clients of the construction company. A cost center is another entity within that organization that provides services to fulfill the activities of a profit center in order to achieve the profitability requirements of the company. ^ The protocol developed in this research will present a framework to obtain the correct data that allows the analysis of the changes in profit margins of different projects undertaken by a construction company. Analysts using the protocol examine relationships between entities outside the company with the cost centers and the profit centers. Furthermore, the relationships between cost centers are analyzed to understand how they affect the profitability of the profit centers. The interactions between profit centers and cost centers also play an important role in understanding how profit margins of projects vary. Finally, the way profit centers influence each other has been inspected. A specific scale to measure the performance of the different entities of the company has been created, and the protocol has been applied to three different projects executed at the same time by a construction company based in Kuwait. Using the protocol generates results that are essential in order to evaluate the overall profitability of a construction company to identify problems within the organization that could be corrected in order to improve its overall profitability. ...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{describe}} the main obstacles for innovation in Dutch consultancy firms by focusing on the strength of informal knowledge sharing as an avenue for innovation. Design/methodology/approach: This paper is the result of an empirical study based on in-depth interviews with 29 consultants in the Netherlands. Findings: The process of innovation can be problematic in consultancy firms. Consultants do simply not find the time to innovate, since they are mainly rewarded for client related <b>work</b> (<b>billable</b> hours). In order to innovate consultants need to share knowledge with clients, colleague consultants and their experienced superiors. The knowledge sharing routes the consultant can use, as described in this paper, are: codified, formal knowledge and informal knowledge sharing. This paper claims that the most fruitful route to innovation is informal knowledge sharing. Originality/value: The importance of informal knowledge is supported by Hofstede's description of the Dutch business culture as being feminine, cultivating low power distance (low degree of inequality) and being highly individualistic. However, despite the support of the Dutch cultural setting, which supports informal knowledge sharing, this research describes the lack of management support in the innovation process as one of the main barriers to innovation.
