40|$|Abstract This work {{studies the}} column-base {{connection}} by external socket in precast structures. A parametric {{study of the}} geometric characteristics of the external <b>socket</b> <b>base</b> with smooth interface is presented. In this parametric study, the consumption of concrete and steel are analyzed. The column cross section, the embedded length of the column in the <b>socket</b> <b>base</b> and {{the thickness of the}} wall of the <b>socket</b> <b>base</b> were the variables considered in this study. It was observed that with the increase of the embedded length, the minimum cross section of the main horizontal reinforcement reduces. With this modification, the walls of the <b>socket</b> <b>base</b> that are perpendicular to the direction of the applied loads presented a reduction of their stiffness. Besides the parametric study, this paper presents a verification model. This part of the study shows the possibility to generate abacuses that simplifies the project of the <b>socket</b> <b>base</b> foundation. Moreover, a comparative analysis becomes easier to be accomplishe...|$|R

40|$|The {{curing process}} of {{prosthetic}} <b>socket</b> <b>base</b> materials requires attention owing {{to a series}} of associated problems that are yet to be addressed and solved. However, to date, few relevant studies have been reported. In this paper, nanodiamonds modified with a silane coupling agent were dispersed into a prosthetic <b>socket</b> <b>base</b> material, and the performance of the modified base materials was investigated. Adding a predetermined amount of nanodiamonds to the prosthetic <b>socket</b> <b>base</b> material increased the glass transition temperature, improved the mechanical properties of the cured base material, and reduced the influence of the volatile gas formed during the curing process on the environment. With increasing nanodiamond contents, the glass transition temperature increased and the mechanical properties improved slightly. Owing to the high thermal conductivity of the nanodiamonds, the localized heat, {{as a result of the}} curing process, could be dissipated and released. Thus, adding nanodiamonds led to a more uniform temperature field forming in the curing system. This improved the curing process and reduced the formation of volatile monomers, thereby decreasing the adverse impact of the generated volatile gases on the environment. All of these provide a potential strategy for modifying prosthetic <b>socket</b> <b>base</b> materials...|$|R

40|$|To {{evaluate}} the main design models for <b>socket</b> <b>base</b> connections of precast concrete structures, an experimental investigation {{was carried out}} on specimens of this connection with smooth and rough interfaces in contact with cast-in-place concrete. The specimens consisted of pedestal walls and were submitted to loads with large eccentricities. Based on the experimental results, two rational design models are proposed for this connection. One of these models accounts for the friction and is applied to <b>socket</b> <b>bases</b> with smooth interfaces. The main behavior model was verified for sockets {{with this type of}} interface and the design of the longitudinal walls as corbels is also suggested in this case. Because the behavior of the rough interface specimens was very close to a monolithic connection, the other proposed model is an adaptation of the bending theory to calculate the vertical reinforcement of <b>socket</b> <b>bases</b> with rough interfaces...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—A new {{addressing}} and routing design {{called the}} Less-Is-More Architecture (LIMA) is proposed as an inter-domain solution {{for a future}} Internet. Unlike recently proposed identifierlocator split solutions, LIMA uses just (topological) locationindependent names and location-dependent addresses. The feasibility of using a policy combination of restricting stubs to provider-aggregatable addressing only, and disallowing stub-level reachability from being propagated into the global routing tables, is studied. This policy combination results in significantly smaller global routing tables but creates four challenges of address renumbering (when stubs change providers), multihoming, mobility, and traffic engineering. Solutions to these challenges {{include the use of}} multiaddressing, name <b>based</b> <b>sockets,</b> a LIMA concept of address dismemberment, transport protocols such as SCTP that are capable of dynamic address reconfiguration, and new management-plane and control-plane procedures. Preliminary RIB data analysis quantify the benefit of LIMA in global routing table size reduction (to 6815 entries from today’s 335 K entries), and a cost of LIMA in terms of number of provider changes made by stubs {{in the last six months}} (about 2450 provider changes per month across 33 K stubs).
