40|$|Germination of 10 {{native and}} exotic grasses was {{compared}} for temperature regimes representing abruptly and gradually fluctuating minimum and maximum wet seedbed temperatures in summer, spring, and winter, respectively, {{in the desert}} grassland. Gradually fluctuating temperatures produced similar total percent germination but more rapid germination than abruptly alternating temperatures and constant 25 degrees C. Lehmann lovegrass (Eragrostis lehmanniana) and 7 native grasses were sown into stands of Lehmann lovegrass that were left intact, burned, sprayed with herbicide and left standing, or sprayed and mowed. In 1992 mow and dead standing treatments reduced Lehmann lovegrass seedling density and improved establishment of cane <b>beardgrass</b> (Bothriochloa barbinodis), Arizona cottontop (Digitaria californica), green sprangletop (Leptochloa dubia), and plains bristlegrass (Setaria leucopila) compared to burn and control treatments.

40|$|The project {{assembled}} {{basic information}} to allow effective management and manipulation of native pastures {{in the southern}} Maranoa region of Queensland. This involved a range of plant studies, including a grazing trial, to quantify the costs of poor pasture composition. While the results focus on perennial grasses, we recognise the important dietary role played by broad-leaved herbs. The plant manipulation studies focussed on ways to change the proportions of plants in a grazed pasture, eg. by recruitment or accelerated morbidity of existing plants. As most perennial grasses have {{a wide range of}} potential flowering times outside of mid-winter, rainfall exerts the major influence on flowering and seedset; exceptions are black speargrass, rough speargrass and golden <b>beardgrass</b> that flower only for a restricted period each year. This simplifies potential control options through reducing seedset. Data from field growth studies of four pasture grasses have been used to refine the State's pasture production model GRASP. We also provide detailed data on the forage value of many native species at different growth stages. Wiregrass dominance in pastures on a sandy red earth reduced wool value by only 5 - 10...|$|E
40|$|Attempts to {{establish}} native grasses in revegetation projects in semidesert grasslands in the Southwestern United States often fail whereas revegetation of non-native lovegrasses (Eragrostis spp.) is frequently more successful. The reasons for differential establishment are unclear. Species may be differentially vulnerable to variable patterns of soil moisture availability during germination and seedling growth. Field experiments described within this dissertation investigated {{the effects of}} planting date and species on germination, emergence, mortality, survival, and seedling growth of native and non-native warm-season perennial grasses seeded in southeastern Arizona. Native species [Sideoats grama (Bouteloua curtipendula (Michx.) Torr.), cane <b>beardgrass</b> (Bothriochloa barbinodis (Lag.) Herter), green sprangletop (Leptochloa dubia (H. B. K.) Nees), and Arizona cottontop (Digitaria californica (Benth.) Chase) ] germinated rapidly, produced a few, large cohorts of seedlings, and retained limited residual germinability following initial rain events. In contrast, Lehmann lovegrass (Eragrostis lehmanniana Nees) germinated more slowly, produced more, smaller cohorts throughout the growing season, and retained more residual germinable seeds following initial rains. Mortality of all species was highest {{in the first week}} following emergence. Early development of adventitious roots and relatively high rates of biomass accumulation exhibited by Lehmann lovegrass are potentially advantageous under variable environmental conditions. Establishment of fast-germinating native species is favored by rainfall patterns that support early seedling growth subsequent to initial rains; the risk of seeding failure for these species increases when lengthy dry periods follow initial rain events. Years in which summer soil moisture conditions are highly variable would tend to favor Lehmann lovegrass establishment. Gradual depletion of the seedbank, early seedling growth characteristics, and rapid production of seed in response to drought increase the probability that at least one cohort will establish or will survive long enough to replenish the seedbank for subsequent years. In southeastern Arizona, the probability of intermittent dry periods decreases as rainstorm frequency increases near the end of July, yet the recommended time to reseed is early summer. Adjusting the planting date to late July or early August may improve the potential for successful revegetation of native species that germinate rapidly and produce few cohorts following initial rains...|$|E
40|$|Reports were scanned {{in black}} and white at a {{resolution}} of 600 dots per inch and were converted to text using Adobe Paper Capture Plug-in. Prior to their eradication in 1987, feral pigs (Sus scrofa) were a common source of ground disturbance in the mountain parkland ecosystem of Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park, especially in grasslands. In 1985 - 1986, 27, 2 x 5 m plots were established in 9 open, grassy sites recently damaged by pigs. No pig digging occurred after the plots were initially established. The purpose of monitoring vegetation changes was to evaluate the efficacy of pig control in promoting community recovery and to detect any changes that might need further management intervention. Percent cover of plants was determined by point-intercept methods, and woody plants were counted in height classes in 1985, 1986, 1987, 1989, and 1992. The 27 plots were stratified into 5 plant communities based on a Braun-Blanquet analysis of surrounding vegetation, and successional changes were graphed. Deschampsia nubigena, a native bunchgrass, consistently increased in cover in most communities where it was originally a dominant or codominant species in surrounding vegetation. It did not increase in cover where it was initially a minor component. These trends suggest that Deschampsia will continue to increase in importance. Velvet grass (Holcus lanatus), the main competitor with Deschampsia in mid and upper elevation sites, recovered rapidly at first but generally declined from its maximum cover after 2 - 4 years. However, Holcus cover may be stable at upper elevation sites where it was dominant prior to disturbance. In lower and mid elevation sites, Holcus species may continue to decline in importance, while other alien grass species, e. g., sweet vernal grass (Anthoxanthum ordoratum) and <b>beardgrass</b> (Schizachyrium condensatum), show signs of becoming more abundant. There was some recruitment of native shrubs in the disturbed areas, especially at lower elevations. Koa (Acacia koa), a root-sprouting, clonal tree in the study area, invaded many sites. The continued expansion of koa colonies may, at least locally, be more ecologically important than competition between Deschampsia and alien grasses.

40|$|Reports were scanned {{in black}} and white at a {{resolution}} of 600 dots per inch and were converted to text using Adobe Paper Capture Plug-in. Three forested craters, Pu'u Huluhulu, Kane Nui O Hamo, and Napau Trail Pit Crater located on Kilauea volcano's East Rift Zone, were surveyed for feral pig (Sus scrofa) activity, alien plant species, and endangered, rare, and uncommon native plant species in 1995 - 1997. Plant species lists were prepared and Braun-Blanquet releve method was used to determine cover and abundance of vegetation. Releve plots were established at all three craters (two in Pu'u Huluhulu, two in Napau Trail Pit Crater, and five in Kane Nui O Hamo) to characterize forest type, species diversity, and species density occurring at these craters. These plots were replicated in exterior forests near these craters for qualitative comparison between interior and exterior forests. A total of eighteen plots were established. The craters have very steep interior walls inhibiting feral pig ingression. Using USGS-Biological Resources Division feral pig activity survey protocol it was determined that feral pigs have not been present recently within these forested craters. Sources of disturbance to interior crater forests are localized events such as tree and rock fall. Twenty-one alien plant species were located in the survey areas; nine at Kane Nui O Hamo, six at Napau Trail Pit Crater, and fifteen at Pu'u Huluhulu. The most aggressive alien plant species included firetree (Myrica faya), kahili ginger (Hedychium gardnerianum), yellow Himalayan raspberry (Rubus ellipticus), and <b>beardgrass</b> (Andropogon virginicus). Alien plant species diversity in the craters is very low, much lower than the surrounding forests. We attribute this finding to the absence of feral pig disturbance, low levels of natural disturbance such as rock and tree fall, and a high diversity and density of native plant species which enhance recovery of disturbed sites. Thirteen rare and uncommon plant species were located in the survey areas. Two of these species, Phyllostegia floribunda, and pawale (Rumex giganteus), had not previously been recorded for the ERZ. Persistence of rare and uncommon native plant species may be attributed to steep interior crater walls and rough and variable terrain of crater floors which act as natural barriers to feral pigs, low intensity of natural disturbance, high diversity and density of other common native plant species, and a unique microclimate and microhabitat.

40|$|A {{review of}} {{previous}} environmental work conducted at Patrick Air Force Base (PAFB) indicated that several threatened, endangered, or species of special concern occurred or {{had the potential}} to occur there. This study was implemented to collect more information on protected species at PAFB. A map of landcover types was prepared for PAFB using aerial photography, groundtruthing, and a geographic information system (GIS). Herbaceous vegetation was the most common vegetation type. The second most abundant vegetation type was disturbed shrubs/exotics. The beach and associated dune vegetation comprised 3. 2 % of the land area, but was the most extensive natural community within PAFB. A few isolated mangrove communities exist along the Banana River. Seventy-seven species of vascular plants occurred on the dunes, including four species listed by state agencies: spider lily (Hymenocallis latifolia), prickly pear cactus (Opuntia stricta), beach star (Remirea maritima), and inkberry (Scaevola plumien). Surveys of other habitats revealed eighty-four species of vascular plants including two state-listed species: spider lily and prickly pear cactus. Many of these areas are dominated by invasive, exotic species, particularly Brazilian pepper (Schinus terebinthifolius) and Australian pine (Casuarina equisetifolia), and native species of open or disturbed sites such as camphorweed (Heterotheca subaxillaris) and <b>beardgrass</b> (Andropogon spp.). Due to the isolation of PAFB from other natural areas, most exotic plant populations on the base are not an immediate threat to intact native plant communities. Dune habitat was surveyed for the southeastem beach mouse (Peromyscus polionotus niveiventris) by quarterly trapping along eight 100 m transects. No beach mice were found. The limited extent of dune habitat, its fragmented condition, and the isolation of PAFB from extant populations of the beach mouse probably accounts for its absence. Surveys of birds on PAFB found an avifauna characteristic of species that occur in the Indian River Lagoon system. Twenty-five species of waterbirds were observed during quarterly surveys on PAFB, including five species listed as species of special concern by the state of Florida: Snowy Egret (Egretta thula), Little Blue Heron (Egretta caerulea), Tricolored Heron (Egretta tricolo 4, White Ibis (Eudocimus albus), and Brown Pelican (Pelecanus occidentalis). The Golf Course was used extensively by almost all species of waterbirds on PAFB. Twenty-two species of shorebirds were observed on PAFB. Although no listed species were observed, the potential exists for several protected species of shorebirds to use the beach at PAFB during some parts of the year. The Airfield runways and associated grass areas were important sites at PAFB for loafing and feeding for some shorebirds. Surveys of rooftop nesting by Least Terns (Stema antillarum) on PAFB found a large colony on a rooftop in the PAFB Industrial Area. This colony produced some independent young. Two rooftop Least Tern colonies reported from previous years were inactive during 1996. A small number of Black Skimmers (Rhynchops nigee attempted to nest at the Least Ten colony but were unsuccessful. Surveys for the gopher tortoise (Gopherus polyphemus) revealed burrows and tortoises only at the Waste Study Site; five burrows and three tortoises were observed. No Florida scrub lizards (Sceloporus woodi), eastern indigo snakes (Drymarchon corais couperl), or diamondback terrapins (Malademys terrapin terrapin) were observed. American alligators (Alligator mississippiensis) were observed on the Golf Course and using ditches, ponds, and areas along the Banana River. The amount of dune habitat could be expanded by not mowing areas adjacent to the dunes to allow dune species to colonize and expand. Planting dune species as part of the beach renourishment project will also increase this habitat. Exotic plants dominate several areas on the base and are used by threatened, endangered, and species of special concern. However, the use of native vegetation in landscaping projects throughout the base would improve habitat for wildlife, and invasive, exotic plants should not be used in any horticultural plantings. Water quality of ponds, ditches, and canals is important for waterbirds; it should be maintained and protected from contamination. Nesting Least Terns are sensitive to disturbance; rooftops used for nesting should be protected from disturbance. Monitoring of Least Tern and Black Skimmer nesting should be continued to determine what roofs are being used and whether nesting is successful. Furthermore, based on the large numbers of waterbirds observed on PAFB, continued monitoring of them is recommended...|$|E
