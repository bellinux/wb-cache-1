40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{evaluate}} load cell moving deformable <b>barrier</b> (LCMDB) <b>tests</b> as a means of assessing frontal impact compatibility between vehicles. An LCMDB is employed to enable assessment of relevant partner-protection characteristics in addition to self-protection performance in a front-to-front crash test. The ability to control key characteristics of compatibility in LCMDB tests enables force measurements on the load cell wall to be used to assess structural interaction, frontal force level and passenger compartment strength. In this study, LCMDB tests have been conducted with various deformable elements to determine how well they correlated with fixed <b>barrier</b> <b>tests</b> or vehicle-to-vehicle <b>tests.</b> Firstly, <b>barrier</b> load cell data measured in a full-frontal LCMDB-to-vehicle crash test are compared with data measured in a full width deformable <b>barrier</b> (FWDB) <b>test</b> at 56 km/h. In addition, some compatibility metrics such as average height of force (AHOF) and force distribution are compared. Secondly, an offset-frontal LCMDB-to-vehicle crash test has been conducted to evaluate the passenger compartment strength for small cars in an overload condition. Force measurements of the load cell wall are compared with data obtained from an offset deformable <b>barrier</b> (ODB) <b>test</b> at 64 km/h. Finally, an oblique-frontal LCMDB-to-vehicle crash test has been conducted and the test results are compared with vehicle-to-vehicle tests and with fixed oblique <b>barrier</b> <b>tests</b> at 50 km/h in terms of the vehicle and occupant kinematics. The study has shown that the LCMDB-to-vehicle test offers a realistic simulation of the effect of differences in mass in vehicle-to-vehicle impacts, and enables compatibility metrics to be evaluated...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To improve vehicle {{safety in}} frontal collisions, the crash {{compatibility}} between the colliding vehicles is crucial. Compatibility aims to improve both {{the self and}} partner protection properties of vehicles. Although compatibility has received worldwide attention for many years, no final assessment approach has been defined. Methods: Within the Frontal Impact and Compatibility Assessment Research (FIMCAR) project, different frontal impact test procedures (offset deformable barrier [ODB] test as currently used for Economic Commission for Europe [ECE] R 94, progressive deformable <b>barrier</b> <b>test</b> as proposed by France for a new ECE regulation, moveable deformable <b>barrier</b> <b>test</b> as discussed worldwide, full-width rigid <b>barrier</b> <b>test</b> as used in Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard [FMVSS] 208, and full-width deformable <b>barrier</b> <b>test)</b> were analyzed regarding their potential for future frontal impact legislation. The research activities focused on car-to-car frontal impact accidents based on accident investigations involving newer cars. Test procedures were developed with both a crash test program and numerical simulations. Results: The proposal from FIMCAR {{is to use a}} full-width test procedure with a deformable element and compatibility metrics in combination with the current offset test as a frontal impact assessment approach that also addresses compatibility. Conclusions: By adding a full-width test to the current ODB test it is possible to better address the issues of structural misalignment and injuries resulting from high acceleration accidents as observed in the current fleet. The estimated benefit ranges from a 5 to 12 percent reduction of fatalities and serious injuries resulting from frontal impact accidents. By using a deformable element in the full-width test, the test conditions are more representative of real-world situations with respect to acceleration pulse, restraint system triggering time, and deformation pattern of the front structure. The test results are therefore expected to better represent real-world performance of the tested car. Furthermore, the assessment of the structural alignment is more robust than in the rigid wall test. Supplemental materials are available for this article.

40|$|With {{the current}} global focus on {{strengthening}} HIV prevention through greater testing and treatment uptake, {{it is increasingly}} salient to identify and address <b>barriers</b> to <b>testing.</b> A review of the published, peer-reviewed literature and national reports from Australia, Canada, and the UK (2003 - 2013) on <b>barriers</b> to HIV <b>testing</b> was conducted to provide new information relevant to Australia and to complement earlier reviews from Canada and the UK. A systematic database search using keywords {{and a set of}} inclusion criteria yielded 36 studies (Australia = 13; Canada = 6; and the UK = 17). In addition 17 unpublished reports were included in the review. Our study uses a novel, comprehensive framework to describe <b>barriers</b> to HIV <b>testing,</b> and thus contributes to moving beyond the traditional patient-provider-system categorization. Within that framework, barriers are categorized as either intrapersonal (reported in 15 studies), interpersonal (21), or extrapersonal (16) and conceptualized within wider sociocultural and structural contexts. People 2 Ì 7 s abilities and motivations to test (intrapersonal factors) are influenced by a host of interconnected factors spanning relationship (interpersonal) and broader socioeconomic, political and cultural (extrapersonal) factors. We suggest that the relative effects of interventions targeting <b>barriers</b> to HIV <b>testing</b> at the intrapersonal and interpersonal levels are limited by {{the extent to which the}} social determinants of health are addressed.

40|$|Introduction: HIV diagnoses among gay and {{bisexual}} men have {{increased over the}} past decade in Australia. HIV point-of-care testing (POCT) was introduced in Australia in 2011 as a strategy to increase HIV testing by making the testing process more convenient. We surveyed gay {{and bisexual}} men undergoing POCT to assess <b>barriers</b> to HIV <b>testing</b> and characteristics associated with not having previously tested for HIV (never testing). Methods: During 2011 and 2012, gay and bisexual men who were undergoing POCT at four Sydney sexual health clinics self-completed questionnaires assessing testing history and psychological and structural <b>barriers</b> to HIV <b>testing.</b> Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression was used to assess associations between patient characteristics and never testing. Results: Of 1093 participants, 981 (89. 9 %) reported ever testing for HIV and 110 (10. 1 %) never testing. At least one <b>barrier</b> to <b>testing</b> was reported by 1046 men (95. 7 %), with only 47 men (4. 3 %) not reporting any <b>barrier</b> to <b>testing.</b> The most commonly reported <b>barriers</b> to <b>testing</b> were annoyance at having to return for results (30. 2 %), not having done anything risky (29. 6 %), stress in waiting for results (28. 4 %), being afraid of testing positive (27. 5 %) and having tested recently (23. 2 %). Never testing was independently associated with being non-gay-identified (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 1. 9; 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1. 1 â 3. 2), being aged less than 25 years (AOR: 2. 4; 95 % CI: 1. 6 â 3. 8), living in a suburb with few gay couples (AOR: 1. 9; 95 % CI: 1. 2 â 3. 0), being afraid of testing HIV-positive (AOR: 1. 6; 95 % CI: 1. 0 â 2. 4), not knowing where to test (AOR: 3. 8; 95 % CI: 1. 3 â 11. 2) and reporting one or no sexual partners {{in the last six months}} (AOR: 2. 7; 95 % CI: 1. 2 â 6. 2).

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effects that disposable infection control barriers and physical damage through use had on the power output from dental light curing units (LCUs) and light curing tips (LCTs). Five disposable infection control <b>barriers</b> were <b>tested</b> {{on a number of}} LCUs and LCTs. Testing involved the repeated measurement of power output of LCUs and LCTs on a radiometer. Two of the <b>barriers</b> <b>tested</b> caused statistically significant reductions in the mean light output intensity when compared to the no barrier control groups. One barrier type reduced the power output by 30 to 40 %. It was also noted that physical damage to the LCTs affected power output by between 20 and 30 %, which was then further reduced by the disposable barrier. This study showed that three of the five disposable infection control barriers had little effect on the overall efficiency of the power output of the LCUs. It also showed that physical damage to LCUs and LCTs can affect power output significantly. Infection control measures should be carefully considered before use to avoid undue effects on power output delivered from the LCUs/LCTs to ensure that the degree of polymerisation within the resin-based composite and curing efficiency are not affected unduly.
