5000|$|Nevertheless, after {{cleaning}} of the icon art critics were so amazed by its beauty that some theories arose {{about it being}} created by an Italian painter. The first person to make the suggestion was Dmitry Rovinsky even before the cleaning, but his idea [...] "was immediately extinguished by the note from metropolitan Philaret; and again, {{on the basis of}} the legend, the icon was attributed to Rublev. It continued to serve to those who studied this painter's style as one of his main works of art". Dmitry Aynalov, Nikolai Sychyov and then Nikolay Punin all compared The Trinity to the works of Giotto and Duccio. Viktor Lazarev compared it to the works of Piero della Francesca. However, they most likely intended to point out the high quality of the painting because none of them claimed that it was created under the influence of the Italians. Viktor Lazarev sums it up: [...] "In the light of recent analysis we can definitely state that Rublev was not familiar with the works of Italian art and therefore could not <b>borrow</b> <b>anything</b> <b>from</b> that. His main source was the Byzantine art of the Palaiologos era, in particular the paintings created in its capital, Constantinople. The elegance of his angels, the inclined heads motive, the rectangular shape of the meal were derived exactly from there".|$|E
40|$|Much {{has been}} written about the {{relationship}} between these two poets, but few have wondered – how compatible were they in reality, when their poetry, ethics, philosophy of life, and even politics, were so radically different? In this new essay Peter Cochran tries to take an unsentimental view of how Byron and Shelley related, in both social and literary terms. What did each really think of the other? Were they friends to the end? Did Shelley <b>borrow</b> <b>anything</b> <b>from</b> Byron’s verse, or Byron from Shelley’s? Cochran looks at these questions, taking in en route the relationship between Alastor and Manfred, and – most controversially – Adonais and The Vision of Judgement. His conclusion is more disturbing than usual...|$|E

60|$|Dick's {{first act}} {{had been to}} shave off his {{characteristic}} beard and mustache, and even to submit his long curls to the village barber's shears, while a straw hat, which he bought {{to take the place}} of his slouched sombrero, completed his transformation. His host saw in the change only the natural preparation of a voyager, but Dick had really made the sacrifice, not from fear of detection, for he had recovered his old swaggering audacity, but from a quick distaste he had taken to his resemblance to the portrait. He was too genuine a Westerner, and too vain a man, to feel flattered at his resemblance to an aristocratic bully, as he believed the ancestral De Fontonelles to be. Even his momentary sensation as he faced the Cure in the picture-gallery was more from a vague sense that liberties had been taken with his, Dick's, personality, than that he had <b>borrowed</b> <b>anything</b> <b>from</b> the portrait.|$|R
500|$|One of the {{problems}} that the All-China Women's Federation has identified is that women in China do not understand the federation’s contributions, or its significance in the women’s movement. [...] The members of the ACWF identified two potential sources for the lack of understanding. The first is that the ACWF has many roles and branch organizations which may be obscuring the contribution it is making. The second is that it has lacked consistency in how it has represented women, especially during its early years. Another problem facing the ACWF is its relationship with the international women’s movement. [...] The relationship between the Marxist view of feminism and current international views on feminism are often viewed as contradictory. Marxism often labels feminist movements as bourgeois because it focuses on the betterment of only one segment of society instead of society as a whole, and states capitalism, not the patriarchy, is the creator of gender inequality. The ACWF struggles with how to engage both, sometimes denying to have <b>borrowed</b> <b>anything</b> <b>from</b> international feminism.|$|R
5000|$|As an artist, Donray {{describes}} himself as fiercely independent in both his work and his influences, and as such has been influenced not only by Expressionism, Futurism, Surrealism and Fauvism, but also by movements including Baroque, Romanticism, and German Expressionism. In commenting on the artist's statement he posted to his website in 2010, he said, [...] "I reject the labels that have been placed upon me {{by those who have}} written about my work. While some of what has been written about my art contains a measure of truth, the labels are meaningless. I acknowledge the influence of some artists that have come before me, but I am not an 'expressionist' nor am I a 'surrealist,' a 'fauvist' or a 'futurist.' My goals and aspirations are different from those who were categorized as such and so is my art. If I have <b>borrowed</b> <b>anything</b> <b>from</b> any of those artists or movements, it has been to use as components to forge a new form of expression that is my own." ...|$|R

40|$|Taiwan’s {{painters}} were dynamic {{contributors to}} {{a revolution in}} color that dramatically reshaped East Asian art. During the early twentieth century, new techniques of on-site sketching {{and the introduction of}} oil paint shook the foundations of Chinese and Japanese ink painting as it had been practiced for centuries. The Japanese colonization of Taiwan, a period when educators such as Ishikawa systematically introduced European painting methods, produced a cohort of painters in Taiwan professionally trained and committed to watercolor and oil painting. Building on international art trends like Impressionism and Fauvism, these painters developed a sense of color distinctly their own. Influences from ink painting, local geography, temple architecture, and folk customs shaped the ways in which this Taiwan school of painting conceptualized and applied color. Painters who moved from China to Taiwan after 1949, like Chang Dai-ch’ien and Liang Dan-Fong, remained more closely wedded to Chinese traditions. They saw themselves as the proud ambassadors of a resilient art form centered on brushwork practice. Their ability to travel internationally did not persuade them to adopt Western approaches. It confirmed their determination to modernize Chinese painting from within. They boldly experimented with color without consciously <b>borrowing</b> <b>anything</b> <b>from</b> the West...|$|R
40|$|Among the {{hundreds}} of artificial languages put forth as possible international auxiliary languages, relatively few (e. g. Esperanto, Interlingua) have seen {{a substantial amount of}} actual use. Given this, one might think that the study of such languages might have little to offer pragmaticists, and indeed there has been very little pragmatic work on them. However, I would argue that the pragmatic investigation of artificial languages can provide useful insights and information. Most designers of artificial languages are not professional linguists. Although they usually say little or nothing about the pragmatics of their languages, what they do say can reveal popular ideas about pragmatics, which may otherwise be difficult to discover. I shall present and discuss relevant remarks by some artificial language designers. I shall also look at several pragmatic features of artificial languages. Although the amount of textual material available in most artificial languages is limited, what exists can be subjected to pragmatic analysis. Perhaps most intriguing are the a priori artificial languages (e. g. aUI), attempts to build a language without <b>borrowing</b> <b>anything</b> <b>from</b> natural languages, as, on the surface, these languages can appear quite odd. I shall present some texts from several artificial languages with a view to seeing whether even apparently exotic artificial languages have the same pragmatic properties as natural languages. Such work can be seen as contributing to the study of cross-linguistic pragmatics...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, Dept. of EnglishDirectors world-wide {{have made}} countless film adaptations of Shakespeare’s works, so a {{somewhat}} heated debate exists {{in terms of}} what deserves the label “Shakespearean film,” initiating conversation regarding what constitutes use of the word “Shakespearean. ” Without a doubt, and for any given play, Shakespeare <b>borrowed</b> <b>anything</b> <b>from</b> character names to plots, settings, etc. —all the items that form the bulk of his plays. One cannot, however, limit consideration of a signature element to these items, for they exist as stock elements that have repeated and resurfaced over the span of the ages. The language, all inclusively—the diction, puns, measure, etc. —makes Shakespeare’s plays Shakespeare’s. In Romeo and Juliet, Shakespeare writes, “[w]hat’s in a name? That which we call a rose / By any other word would smell as sweet” (2. 2. 43 - 4); however, can this statement metaphorically apply to that which we have come to know as Shakespearean film? In other words, when a filmmaker removes Shakespeare’s language, thereby removing Shakespeare’s signature from the work, would the film “smell as sweet,” so to speak, as Shakespeare’s play, purely on the basis that it names Shakespeare as its source material? My project will look at two of Shakespeare’s plays—Macbeth and King Lear—and Japanese director Akira Kurosawa’s corresponding film versions—Throne of Blood and Ran, and will assess what happens to the Shakespearean element of these films when Kurosawa translates the plays not only into another medium, but another language...|$|R
60|$|Those who so {{confidently}} tell us {{that the}} soul always actually thinks, I would they would also tell us, what those ideas are that are in the soul of a child, before or just at the union with the body, before it hath received any by sensation. The dreams of sleeping men are, as I take it, all made up of the waking man's ideas; though for the most part oddly put together. It is strange, if the soul has ideas of its own that it derived not from sensation or reflection, (as it must have, if it thought before it received any impressions from the body,) that it should never, in its private thinking, (so private, that the man himself perceives it not,) retain any of them the very moment it wakes out of them, and then make the man glad with new discoveries. Who can find it reason that the soul should, in its retirement during sleep, have so many hours' thoughts, and yet never light on any of those ideas it borrowed not from sensation or reflection; or at least preserve the memory of none but such, which, being occasioned from the body, must needs be less natural to a spirit? It is strange the soul should never once in a man's whole life recall over any of its pure native thoughts, and those ideas it had before it <b>borrowed</b> <b>anything</b> <b>from</b> the body; never bring into the waking man's view any other ideas but what have a tang of the cask, and manifestly derive their original from that union. If it always thinks, and so had ideas before it was united, or before it received any from the body, it is not to be supposed but that during sleep it recollects its native ideas; and during that retirement from communicating with the body, whilst it thinks by itself, the ideas it is busied about should be, sometimes at least, those more natural and congenial ones which it had in itself, underived from the body, or its own operations about them: which, since the waking man never remembers, we must from this hypothesis conclude either that the soul remembers something that the man does not; or else that memory belongs only to such ideas as are derived from the body, or the mind's operations about them.|$|R
