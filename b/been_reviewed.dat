5|$|Hambro {{made his}} {{literary}} debut in 1958 with the non-fiction book Frankrike ("France"), and released {{his first novel}} two years later. The novel, entitled De frafalnes klubb ("The Club of the Estranged"), was favourably commented upon by contemporary critics, but failed to arouse much subsequent interest from scholars. Hambro's reputation as a novelist rests more on his trilogy about the fictional character Nico Dietmeyer, deemed a Bildungsroman by academics. That work, serialised in the 1960s, was Hambro's first major commercial success, and has <b>been</b> <b>reviewed</b> in detail both by contemporaneous commentators and modern literary scholars. After a few unsuccessful novels in the late 1960s and early 1970s, Hambro turned his writings towards non-fiction, especially focusing on linguistics and politics, fields of interest that he had inherited from his father, who became fascinated by Sanskrit and East Asian poetry during his philology studies. The younger Hambro's most well-known and successful book within linguistics was the 1969 Ting, tanke, tale ("Thing, Thought, Speech"), followed by Språket i funksjon ("Language in Operation") in 1972.|$|E
