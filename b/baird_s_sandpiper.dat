40|$|On 23 December 1994, Gordon Brown and I {{were walking}} the North Platte River below Keystone Dam {{as part of}} the Lake McConaughy Christmas Bird Count (CBC). At {{approximately}} 8 : 30 a. m. MST, about 0. 5 mi below the dam, we observed a group of 8 Killdeer and a smaller shorebird, which we immediately recognized as a 2 ̆ 2 peep. 2 ̆ 2 We studied the bird for about 30 minutes at distances as close as 40 feet and then returned in the afternoon to photograph it. The size and black legs immediately eliminated Least Sandpiper, and the dark rump eliminated White-rumped Sandpiper. The remaining possibilities were semipalmated, western, and Baird 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Sandpipers,</b> or the remote possibility of something like a stint. The bill was straight, thin, and pointed, very unlike the bill of a Semipalmated. Additionally, the bird had a very elongate body shape like a Baird 2 ̆ 7 s and unlike either Semipalmated or Western. This and other features led us to conclude that it was a Baird 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Sandpiper</b> (Calidris bairdii). The following is {{a detailed description of the}} bird. Its size was about half that of a Killdeer, though it was proportionally slimmer and longer-winged. The slender shape was accentuated by the short legs, and by wingtips that extended beyond the tail tip. The bill was black, straight, and thin, pointed at the tip. The throat was white, neatly separated from the buff-colored breast. The crown, face, and upper breast were buff-colored. There were no obvious darker streaks on the breast. The lower belly and undertail were white. A clear line separated the buff upper breast from the white underparts, like that of a Pectoral Sandpiper. The supercilium was faintly white and most visible when looking at the bird head-on. The mantle was uniformly gray-brown, lacking pale feather edgings. The scapulars were paler and appeared worn. The upperwing on the perched bird was uniformly dark brown, except that the outer two primaries (and possibly the third) were worn, and appeared pale brown and tattered near the tips. We were unable to ascertain the amount of wear on the inner primaries. The legs were short and jet black. The bird vocalized several times when flushed, uttering a high-pitched 2 ̆ 2 kreep, 2 ̆ 2 short and abrupt. The call seemed shorter and higher-pitched than that of a Pectoral Sandpiper, and was immediately recognizable as the call note of a Baird 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Sandpiper...</b>|$|R

40|$|Cryptosporidium spp. are {{potential}} contaminants of food. Suspected cases of food-borne cryptosporidiosis are rarely confirmed {{because of the}} limited numbers of oocysts in the samples {{and the lack of}} sensitive detection methods adaptable to food. PCR was investigated as a means of overcoming this problem. A PCR assay was designed for the specific amplification of a previously sequenced portion of an oocyst protein gene fragment of Cryptosporidium parvum (N. C. Lally, G. D. <b>Baird,</b> <b>S.</b> J. McQuay, F. Wright, and J. J. Oliver, Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 56 : 69 - 78, 1992) and compared with the primer set of Laxer et al. (M. A. Laxer, B. K. Timblin, and R. J. Patel, Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 45 : 688 - 694, 1991). The PCR products were hybridized with digoxigenin-labeled internal probes and detected by chemiluminescence to enhance sensitivity. The two sets of primers were compared with regard to their sensitivity and specificity by using a variety of human and animal isolates of C. parvum and related parasites. Both assays enabled the detection of 1 to 10 oocysts in 20 ml of artificially contaminated raw milk. The assay based on the PCR set and probe of Laxer et al. detected DNAs from Eimeria acervulina and Giardia intestinalis. The new assay has good specificity for C. parvum bovine isolates and hence has a better potential for monitoring the prevalence of C. parvum in raw milk and other environmental samples...|$|R

40|$|First, some {{housekeeping}} is in order.... You {{will also}} notice {{the new order}} of species (AGAIN!!), reflecting the latest American Ornithologists 2 ̆ 7 Union Checklist, published this spring. The most noticeable change concerns the placement of shrikes and vireos between flycatchers and corvids; but the order of species within some genera also differs, especially among the waterfowl, where, for instance, swans now follow the geese. And now let 2 ̆ 7 s turn to the birds! As in most summers, many species went about their business in routine fashion, hence the notation 2 ̆ 2 Routine Reports 2 ̆ 2 for many. We encourage observers to note and to forward evidence of breeding for all species, including dates for nests, eggs, and young. These data help us document changing patterns for various species. Interesting developments this summer in terms of breeding populations include {{the expansion of the}} Eurasian Collared-Dove 2 ̆ 2 colony 2 ̆ 2 at the Newcomb residence in Kearney; the continued presence of an outlying population of Chuck-will 2 ̆ 7 s-widow at Morse Bluff; further evidence of the northward spread of Acadian Flycatcher in the Missouri Valley; expansion of the Cordilleran Flycatcher population in the western Pine Ridge; continuation of the outlying Say 2 ̆ 7 s Phoebe group in Dixon Co; an increased population of Cassin 2 ̆ 7 s Kingbird and Blue-gray Gnatcatcher in the Panhandle, and expansion (probably temporary) of Cassin 2 ̆ 7 s Sparrow into the southwest Sandhills.
