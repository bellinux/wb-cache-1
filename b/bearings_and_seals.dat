25|$|Some {{types of}} Stirling engines have the <b>bearings</b> <b>and</b> <b>seals</b> {{on the cool}} side of the engine, where they require less {{lubricant}} and last longer than equivalents on other reciprocating engine types.|$|E
50|$|Traditional boats use an inboard motor {{powering}} a propeller {{through a}} propeller shaft complete with <b>bearings</b> <b>and</b> <b>seals.</b> Often a gear reduction {{is incorporated in}} order to be able to use a larger more efficient propeller. This can be a traditional gear box, coaxial planetary gears or a transmission with belts or chains. Because of the inevitable loss associated with gearing, many drives eliminate it by using slow high-torque motors. The electric motor can be encapsulated into a pod with the propeller and fixed outside the hull (saildrive) or on an outboard fixture (outboard motor).|$|E
5000|$|The {{leading cause}} of low oil {{pressure}} in an engine is wear on the engine’s vital parts. Over time, engine <b>bearings</b> <b>and</b> <b>seals</b> suffer from wear and tear. Wear can cause these parts to eventually lose their original dimensions, and this increased clearance allows for a greater volume of oil to flow over time which can greatly reduce oil pressure. For instance, [...]001 of an inch worn off of the engine’s main bearings can cause up to a 20% loss in oil pressure. [...] Simply replacing worn bearings may fix this problem, but in older engines {{with a lot of}} wear not much can be done besides completely overhauling the engine.|$|E
40|$|The {{recent studies}} of the dynamic {{stiffness}} properties of fluid lubricated <b>bearing</b> <b>and</b> <b>seals</b> by the authors have yielded most of the generalized characteristics discussed and used in this paper. They include <b>bearing</b> <b>and</b> <b>seal</b> nonlinear fluid film properties associated with stiffness, damping, and fluid average circumferential velocity ratio. Analytical relationships yield the rotor system's dynamic stiffness characteristics. This paper shows {{the combination of these}} data to provide the fluid-induced rotor stability equations...|$|R
40|$|Vibration data {{obtained}} during several rotor instability investigations {{is presented to}} illustrate the effect of changes in system parameters on overall rotor stability. The data includes the effects of <b>bearing</b> <b>and</b> <b>seal</b> changes {{as well as those}} due to variations in speed and pressure ratio. Field Problems indicate that the stability of rotors is often highly sensitive to fairly minor variations in <b>bearing</b> <b>and</b> <b>seal</b> parameters. Measured field data is valuable in normalizing analytical computer models so that effective solutions can be obtained...|$|R
50|$|Anyone new to {{variable}} stators had {{to overcome}} {{the complexity of the}} linkages and the difficulty of <b>sealing</b> the pivots <b>and</b> airfoil root/casing clearances. Two spools needed more knowledge about <b>bearings</b> <b>and</b> <b>sealing.</b> GE studied both options for nearly a year before deciding, in 1952, that they should pursue variable stators for the 12:1 pressure ratio(PR) compressor. Rolls-Royce had tested a rig compressor with four stages of variable stators in 1949 but did not pursue the idea at the time for the 6.5:1(PR) Avon. Connors tells us that Pratt and Whitney chose two spools for the 12:1(PR) J57 as they knew a lot more about <b>bearings</b> <b>and</b> <b>sealing</b> than about variable stators.|$|R
50|$|Bishopp's engine {{met with}} some scepticism from the trade press {{when it was}} {{launched}} on the market. But Bishopp had opted to revert to the Dakeynes' original design which had a yoke which took most of the dynamic forces and greatly reduced the load on the <b>bearings</b> <b>and</b> <b>seals.</b> In the event {{that there was any}} leakage, the seals were adjustable. In addition, Bishopp had his engines produced by companies with recognised engineering capabilities rather than carrying out his own manufacturing; as well as Donkin's, some of his first engines were built by Joseph Whitworth & Co of Manchester. Another engineering company with a very good reputation was G. Rennie and Son of London who were so convinced of the engine's potential that in 1849 they employed Bishopp as their foreman of works with specific responsibility for the disc engine.|$|E
5000|$|The {{four main}} {{components}} of a centrifugal supercharger are the volute (compressor housing), diffuser, impeller and transmission. Volutes are typically cast into a form from aluminum rather than other metals due to the combination of strength, weight, and resistance to corrosion. Volutes are then precision machined to match the impeller design. [...] Impellers are designed in many configurations, and Euler’s pump and turbine equation {{plays an important role}} in understanding impeller performance. Impellers are often formed by casting metals into a form and then machined, with the highest quality impellers machined from solid billet. The transmission provides a step-up ratio from the input shaft (driven from the engine crankshaft) to the output shaft, to which the impeller attaches (it is not uncommon for centrifugal supercharger impeller speeds to exceed 100,000 rotations per minute). The basic components of the gear drive centrifugal transmission are shafts, gears, <b>bearings,</b> <b>and</b> <b>seals.</b> Because of the high speeds and loads the transmission must endure, components are machined, ground and assembled to extremely close tolerances.|$|E
50|$|The world’s {{first patent}} for a slurry ice {{generator}} was filed by Sunwell Technologies Inc. of Canada in 1976. Sunwell Technologies Inc. introduced slurry ice under the trade name deepchill ice, {{in the late}} 1970s. Slurry ice is created {{through a process of}} forming spherical ice crystals within a liquid. The slurry ice generator is a scraped-surface vertical shell and tube heat exchanger. It consists of concentric tubes with refrigerant flowing between them and the water/freezing point depressant solution in the inner tube. The inner surface of the inner tube is wiped using a wiping mechanism which in the original Sunwell design consists of a central shaft, spring-loaded plastic blades, <b>bearings</b> <b>and</b> <b>seals.</b> The small ice crystals formed in the solution near the tube surface are wiped away from the surface and mixed with unfrozen water, forming the slurry.Other slurry ice generators adapted the first idea of the scraped surface wiping the surface by using an auger originally designed to create flake ice. Wipers can be also brushes or fluidized bed heat exchanger for ice crystallization. In this heat exchangers steel particles circulate with the fluid mechanically removing the crystals from the surface. At the outlet steel particles and slurry ice are separated.|$|E

5000|$|As {{the turbine}} or {{propeller}} turns, mechanical energy {{is transferred to}} the water due to turbulence and friction. The shock caused by the acceleration of the water as it passes from pockets in the stator to the pockets in the spinning rotor requires energy. That energy heats the water due to the friction as the water moves through the water brake. Almost all of the horsepower of the system turning the rotor (usually an internal combustion engine) is converted into a temperature change of the water. A very small amount of energy is taken by the <b>bearings</b> <b>and</b> <b>seals</b> within the unit. Therefore, water must constantly move through the device at a rate proportional to the horse power that is being absorbed. Water temperature exiting the unit must be kept under 120-160F (50-70 °C) to prevent scale formation and cavitation. The water enters {{in the center of}} the device and after passing through the pockets in the stator and rotor exits the outside of the housing though a controlled orifice. The amount of loading is dependent on the level of water inside the housing. Some water brakes vary the load by controlling the inlet water volume only and have a set outlet orifice size depending on the desired hp to be absorbed and some control both input and output orifices at the same time which allows greater control over outlet water temperatures. The housing is vented to the outside to allow air to displace the water as the water level in the unit rises and falls. [...] The amount of torque that can be absorbed is defined by the equation T=kN2D5 where T = torque, N = RPM, D = the diameter of the rotor and k = a constant dependent on the size and shape and angle of the rotor/stator pockets.|$|E

40|$|LecturePg. 1 - 10 The {{evaluation}} of rotor system stability, {{which has become}} {{an essential part of}} rotordynamic analyses and rotating machinery design, relies heavily on the <b>bearing</b> <b>and</b> <b>seal</b> dynamic coefficient modeling to obtain an accurate prediction of the turbomachinery behavior. Lacking experimental validation, analytical predictions can be widely varied and even divergent as more complex procedures and models are created. To measure the variability of <b>bearing</b> <b>and</b> labyrinth <b>seal</b> coefficient predictions, a survey of 60 turbomachinery users, manufacturers, consultants, and academicians was conducted {{under the auspices of the}} American Petroleum Institute (API). Coefficients received from the respondents were incorporated into a common rotordynamic model to determine the impact on the predicted rotor stability. In addition, several of the most popular analytical codes for the prediction of tilt pad journal bearings are compared. Starting with an iso-viscous prediction and proceeding through more complicated thermal and structural deformation solutions, the authors compare the variability and divergent nature of these codes. The measured variability of the data collected clearly illustrates the need for the resolution of fundamental bearing issues (i. e., synchronously versus nonsynchronously reduced <b>bearing</b> coefficients) <b>and</b> labyrinth <b>seal</b> prediction based on repeatable experimental data...|$|R
