5|$|By January 1944 the Soviets {{were aware}} of {{successful}} British and American jet aircraft projects and that the Germans were about to deploy jet and rocket-propelled aircraft of their own. The GKO ordered on 18 February that the NKAP (People's Commissariat for Aviation Industry) centralize jet research under its control and that the NKAP was to present proposals to alleviate the situation within a month. As {{a result of this}} meeting the NKAP ordered the Lavochkin, Sukhoi, Yakovlev and Mikoyan-Gurevich design bureaux (OKBs) to develop and build jet aircraft with the utmost dispatch. Aware of earlier problems encountered with other novel propulsion systems such as ramjets both Sukhoi and Mikoyan-Gurevich chose to use the VRDK <b>booster</b> <b>engine</b> that had been under development since 1942.|$|E
25|$|In Australia, Victorian Railways {{equipped}} {{all but one}} of its X class 2-8-2 locomotives (built between 1929 and 1947) with a 'Franklin' two cylinder <b>booster</b> <b>engine</b> {{after the}} successful trial of the device on a smaller N class 2-8-2 in 1927. The South Australian Railways 500 class 4-8-2 heavy passenger locomotives were rebuilt into 4-8-4s {{with the addition of a}} booster truck from 1929 onwards.|$|E

25|$|Despite these changes, the {{failures}} kept coming. After a six-month gap, Midas 5 orbited on April 9, 1962. The satellite reached orbit successfully, but experienced a massive power failure during the sixth orbit. Eight months later, Midas 6 lifted off (December 17) but {{never made it}} to orbit. At liftoff, an improper disconnect of the hydraulic rise-off caused loss of <b>booster</b> <b>engine</b> hydraulics fluid during ascent. The Atlas drifted off its flight path and the Range Safety destruct command was sent 82 seconds into the launch.|$|E
25|$|In 1927, {{class leader}} N 110 was {{equipped}} with a two-cylinder Franklin <b>booster</b> <b>engine</b> which drove the trailing truck axle. Based {{on the success of}} this device, VR built all but two of the much larger X class 2-8-2s with booster engines. VR also modified the design of the Delta trailing truck on the second (1930-31 built) batch of N class locomotives to enable easy retrofitting of booster engines. Despite this, no further boosters were ever fitted, and in 1945, N 110's booster was removed and fitted to one of the two non-booster equipped X class locomotives.|$|E

2500|$|All but {{two were}} built with a {{featured}} a Franklin C2 type <b>Booster</b> <b>engine</b> on the trailing truck axle, following a successful {{trial of a}} booster on the smaller N class light lines 2-8-2. The booster allowed an additional [...] tractive effort at starting and low speeds to increase the hauling power of the locomotive, particularly on heavy grades. X36 and X37 were built without boosters and were rostered for 'plains working' on the relatively flat line between Gheringhap and Maroona stations. X37 was equipped with a booster in March 1932, however X36 was never fitted with one, even though its trailing truck axle was equipped with the necessary pinion gear wheel.|$|E
2500|$|The DF-3 (CSS-2) {{is often}} {{considered}} China's first [...] "domestic" [...] intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM). The common ICBM design was {{greatly influenced by}} soviet R-14 Chusovaya missile and the first stage engine itself was a direct copy of С.2.1100/С.2.1150 La-350 <b>booster</b> <b>engine</b> developed by Isayev OKB-2 (NII-88). The responsibility for the development guidance {{has been attributed to}} both Tu Shou'e (屠守锷) and Sun Jiadong (孙家栋), and the missile as produced at Factory 211 (Capital Astronautics Co., (首都航天机械公司), also known as Capital Machine Shop, (首都机械厂). [...] The 2,500km DF-3 was originally designed with 2,000kg payload to carry an atomic (later thermonuclear) payload. [...] A further improved DF-3A with 3,000km range (~4,000km with reduced payload) was developed in 1981, and exported to Saudi Arabia with conventional high-explosive warhead. Their range of 2,810km means they fall just short of being able to target Guam, although the 2012 DOD report on China's military power states that they have a range of 3,300km, which would be enough to target Guam. The 2013 Pentagon report on China's military power confirms the DF-3's 3,300km range, and its maps show Guam being within the DF-3's range. All DF-3/DF-3A's were retired by the mid-2010s and replaced by the DF-21.|$|E

The flight trajectory was slightly more lofted than nominal due to the DC voltage in the booster electrical system being about 0.7 volts above normal, this was counteracted by the higher than nominal <b>booster</b> <b>engine</b> performance.|$|E
