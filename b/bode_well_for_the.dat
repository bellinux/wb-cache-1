5|$|The club's League title win in 1986 {{saw them}} {{qualify for the}} European Cup in 198687, where Celtic {{eliminated}} Shamrock Rovers 30 on aggregate in the first round. The next round saw Celtic take on Soviet champions Dynamo Kyiv, a side comprising {{a large number of}} players in their national side. A hard-fought 11 draw in the first leg at Parkhead did not <b>bode</b> <b>well</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> return match in Kiev. Oleh Blokhin's free-kick in the second leg gave the Soviet's an early lead, but Mark McGhee levelled the tie shortly after half-time. Dynamo regained the lead later on in the second half, but Celtic continued to press. A late third goal from Dynamo, however, saw them clinch the tie.|$|E
5|$|Command, control, and {{coordination}} {{of the operation}} {{was going to be}} problematic, especially in the highly politicized South Vietnamese command structure, where the support of key political figures was of paramount importance in promotion to and retention of command positions. Lieutenant General Lê Nguyên Khang, the Vietnamese Marine Corps commander and protege of Vice President Nguyen Cao Ky, whose troops were scheduled to participate in the operation, actually outranked General Lãm, who had the support of President Nguyễn Văn Thiệu. The same situation applied to Lieutenant General Dư Quốc Đống, commander of ARVN Airborne forces also scheduled to participate in the operation. After the incursion began, both men remained in Saigon and delegated their command authority to junior officers rather than take orders from Lãm. This did not <b>bode</b> <b>well</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> success of the operation.|$|E
5|$|Most in {{the crowd}} {{believed}} they knew what would follow; Constantine and Maxentius, the only adult sons of a reigning emperor, men who had long been preparing to succeed their fathers, would be granted the title of caesar. Constantine had traveled through Palestine at the right hand of Diocletian, and {{was present at the}} palace in Nicomedia in 303 and 305. It is likely that Maxentius received the same treatment. In Lactantius' account, when Diocletian announced that he was to resign, the entire crowd turned to face Constantine. It was not to be: Severus and Maximin were declared caesars. Maximin appeared and took Diocletian's robes. On the same day, Severus received his robes from Maximian in Milan. Constantius succeeded Maximian as augustus of the West, but Constantine and Maxentius were entirely ignored in the transition of power. This did not <b>bode</b> <b>well</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> future security of the tetrarchic system.|$|E

25|$|After {{the fall}} of Landrecies the Austrians did nothing for eleven days, {{as if they had}} {{forgotten}} why the fortress had been taken in the first place. Only on 12 May did operations of the combined Austro-Dutch forces resume near Le Cateau-Cambrésis. A chance to cut off Pichegru was missed, however, because of hesitation by the Emperor. This did not <b>bode</b> <b>well</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> remainder of the campaign. Indeed the tide eventually turned in favor of the French and they retook Landrecies on 17 July 1794 after a brief siege.|$|E
25|$|Contact with Europeans {{brought a}} series of devastating {{epidemics}} of diseases from Europe the people had no immunity to. The result was a dramatic population collapse, culminating in the 1862 Smallpox outbreak in Victoria that spread throughout the coast. European settlement did not <b>bode</b> <b>well</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> remaining native population of British Columbia. Colonial officials deemed colonists could make better use of the land than the First Nations people, and thus the land territory be owned by the colonists. To ensure colonists {{would be able to}} settle properly and make use of the land, natives were relocated onto reserves, which were often too small to support their way of life. By the 1930s, British Columbia had over 1500 reserves.|$|E
25|$|The Vikings {{boosted by}} return of Captain Ian Cahill {{for the final}} felt {{it was time for}} them to win their first {{silverware}} since 2010. However, the Trinity team who had scouted the previous game and had fresh legs started quick and were 2 scores up within the first quarter. The Vikings rattled responded positively with some outstanding Defensive play from the entire squad Ian Cahill, Donogh Flannery, Pat Noonan, Brian Kelly, Rob Crimin, Lorcan Crean, Ray Burke, Craig Switzer, Kevin Flaherty, Bono and Alvaro. However, despite several turnovers the Vikings offence struggled and the 2 games started to take their tole on an impressive offensive line. The Vikings played out the game and ultimately the scores remained 14–0. The Vikings battled valiantly with their most impressive rookie class in memory which surely <b>bode</b> <b>well</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> coming season. Impressive displays by the entire team and toughness shown by the offence through their struggles showed positive signs for the Vikings going forward. The Vikings then regrouped and disbanded before pre-season training began again in mid-January. With some hard work on offence and continued effort on Defence the Vikings team looks like it's ready for big things n 2014.|$|E

25|$|The Vikings {{came into}} the game with great {{confidence}} internally but none by the wider league. They showed {{what it meant to}} be Vikings on that day player all phases and pushing the Undefeated Champions, who won the Bowl by a huge margin against the Dublin Rebels, to their limits. It was not enough and in the end a 22-man squad could not last against the huge numbers and freshness of the Belfast Trojans team. Many players felt it was one of the gutsiest Vikings performances in recent years but just not good enough. Excellent young players like Sean Goldrick, Ian Cahill, Paul Keane, Shane Gleeson and Eoin Whelan matured on the field and <b>bode</b> <b>well</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Future of the team. Overall, the Vikings learned the hard way that you can't win if you don't score no matter how good your Defence is as was the story of their entire season and many seasons past. The future is bright for this new generation of Vikings and keep a close eye on 2014 which is sure to be a huge one for this team.|$|E

However, she opined that Cavallari's appearance at the wedding [...] "does not <b>bode</b> <b>well</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> future of The Hills". A writer for Entertainment Weekly described the reconciliation between Conrad and Montag an [...] "ideal end" [...] to the series, and noted Cavallari's addition as a [...] "questionable choice". Furthermore, it was included on the magazine's list of [...] "25 TV Shows That Missed Cue for a Graceful Exit". In contrast, Jim Cantiello of MTV News noted that Conrad [...] "came to the realization that she had been replaced", and complimented the manner in which Cavallari was integrated into the series.

[...] Jensen was critical {{of the first half}} of the episode, noting that the pre-marital tension between Clark and Lois did not <b>bode</b> <b>well</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> story. However, he felt that the last 10 minutes made up for the slow parts in the episode. He ultimately concluded that the finale was [...] "radically cornball and goosebumpingly geektastic, and the fanboy in me was satisfied". Chris Carabott of IGN awarded the episode a 9.5 out of 10, citing an [...] "amazing" [...] episode. He argued that it [...] "succeeded in delivering the moments we wanted to see" [...] and that [...] "this finale delivered some of the most memorable moments of the series and successfully transformed Clark Kent into Superman".

[...] She added that because Gail is so possessive of David, [...] "it doesn't <b>bode</b> <b>well</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> future." [...] Shepherd added that they are [...] "the match made in hell" [...] and revealed that David lets her do as she pleases because he is in love with her.

He concluded: [...] "I think he's keener on her than she is on him." [...] David fools Kylie into believing he owns a salon. Lane explained [...] "Kylie sees an opportunity for a better life, but not in a money-grubbing, scheming way. She does love David, and she's not doing anything wrong."

The loss of Kanouté for nearly one-third of the season, and Di Canio {{at exactly the same}} period, resulted in the teenage Jermain Defoe leading the line on his own. The loss of form of key players such as Trevor Sinclair, 2001–02 Hammer of the Year Sebastian Schemmel and Michael Carrick, who was still nursing a groin problem, combined with [...] the absence of a dependable left back or left midfielder, merely exacerbated an already difficult situation.
