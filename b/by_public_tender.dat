2500|$|During her {{crossing}} of the Atlantic she ran into Force K, a number of British ships that had been deployed {{in search of the}} German commerce raider the Admiral Graf Spee. Attached to the force was the aircraft carrier , whose aircraft had spotted another disguised German merchant the previous month, when on 9 October they had sighted the German tanker Altmark. The Altmark had been disguised as the American Delmar, and consequently had escaped unmolested. The Uhenfels was not so fortunate. Detected on 5 November the aircraft reported the German ship, and the destroyer [...] was directed to secure the German merchant. The crew attempted to scuttle the ship but a boarding party from the Hereward was able to prevent this. The captured ship was brought into Freetown the following day. The 61 crew were marched off to a prison camp ashore, defiantly singing Nazi songs. By the time she had been captured the Uhenfels was running short of food. Uhenfels was then taken to Gibraltar for drydocking and inspection, arriving on 18 March. She arrived at London on 5 April 1940, the first captured German vessel to arrive in port there. Her cargo consisted maize, palm kernels and other foodstuffs from the West Indies.

40|$|ABSTRACT School {{transport}} in Spain {{is conceived}} administratively as a regular, but special, {{public transport service}} financed by the Spanish regional govern-ments through private sector contracts adjudicated <b>by</b> <b>public</b> <b>tendering.</b> As such it has two special features in comparison to systems elsewhere. First, larger operators use conventional buses (rather than special school buses) and these {{can also be used}} for regular services during school hours. Second, as these are regional services, often only regional operators bid for these tenders, so contract assignment resembles a bargaining process between operators and administra-tions, tempering an adequate operation of the market. This problem is common to all Spanish regions. The situation described has generated high costs (i. e. 15 % increase in contract costs in the past year although the number of contracts did not vary significantly). For this reason the Government of Cantabria commis-sioned research to examine the problem. A simple cost allocation model allowed us to detect that school transport costs were, on average, approximately 18 % higher than what could be deemed reasonable. This article describes the problem...|$|R

50|$|No copper mines {{were active}} {{in the country in}} 2006.

Copper mineralization at Aynak in Logar Province was stratabound and characterized by bornite and chalcopyrite disseminated in dolomite marble and quartz-biotite-dolomite schists of the Loy Khwar Formation. Although a resource of 240 million metric tons at a grade of 2.3% copper had been reported, a number of small ore lenses were potentially not practically and economically minable. Open pit and underground mining would be needed to exploit the main ore body, and other infrastructure problems, such as inadequate power and water, were also likely.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} whether green public procurements {{are potential}} drivers {{for the development}} of a landscape architecture professional field in urban design. It proposes an analysis based on the nature of professional skill sets requested and selected <b>by</b> the <b>public</b> <b>tendering</b> process in France. To conduct this research, an analysis of 196 public ‘calls for tender’ and their results are undertaken. Depending on the consideration of ecological concerns, two types of projects are identified: traditional projects and green projects. We examine the impact that ecological issues assert on the position of landscape architecture within the requested skills and within the winning design team. Our main results show that the emergence of green public procurements in France has a significant impact on the demand for new types of professional ‘competencies’ and disciplinary collaborations but not on the results after the selection process. It appears that clients request more multidisciplinarity collaborations to address green criteria. In addition, the landscape architect is always associated with multidisciplinary teams in the requirements of the <b>public</b> call for <b>tender.</b> However, the emergence of new professional skills in the environmental field challenges the expertise of landscape architects and constitutes a competitive field. Counter to the ‘call for tender’ requirements, the selection process favours monodisciplinary teams, often the architect, who is also the favourite for the lead-consultant role. Finally, we discuss how the recognition of landscape architecture as an academic discipline can influence landscape education and how a strong professional body can protect a professional title...|$|R
