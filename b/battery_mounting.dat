According to Pigot's Directory of 1824, the barracks housed two companies of foot, had apartments for three officers, a bomb and waterproof magazine and an artillery <b>battery</b> <b>mounting</b> three 12-pound guns. The Directory also states that the barracks was formerly a nunnery (possibly that of Saint Rynagh, which would have been founded around 580) and communicated with Saint Rynagh's Old Abbey by a subterranean passage of some 400yards. Although the British garrison had left the town in 1863, the barracks was looted and burned shortly after the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921â€“22.|$|E

60|$|On the 9th of April {{they reached}} {{an island in}} the river, called San Bartolomeo, which the Spaniards had fortified, as an outpost, with a small semicircular <b>battery,</b> <b>mounting</b> nine or ten swivels, and manned with sixteen or {{eighteen}} men. It commanded the river in a rapid and difficult part of the navigation. Nelson, {{at the head of a}} few of his seamen, leaped upon the beach. The ground upon which he sprung was so muddy that he had some difficulty in extricating himself, and lost his shoes: bare-footed, however, he advanced, and, in his own phrase, BOARDED THE BATTERY. In this resolute attempt he was bravely supported by Despard, at that time a captain in the army, afterward unhappily executed for his schemes of revolutionary treason. The castle of San Tuan is situated about 16 miles higher up; the stores and ammunition, however, were landed a few miles below the castle, and the men had to march through woods almost impassable. One of the men was bitten under the eye by a snake which darted upon him from the bough of a tree. He was unable to proceed from the violence of the pain; and when, after a short while, some of his comrades were sent back to assist him, he was dead, and the body already putrid. Nelson himself narrowly escaped a similar fate. He had ordered his hammock to be slung under some trees, being excessively fatigued, and was sleeping, when a monitory lizard passed across his face. The Indians happily observed the reptile; and knowing what it indicated, awoke him. He started up, and found one of the deadliest serpents of the country coiled up at his feet. He suffered from poison of another kind; for drinking at a spring in which some boughs of the manchineel had been thrown, the effects were so severe as, in the opinion of some of his friends, to inflict a lasting injury upon his constitution.|$|E

5000|$|Some sources {{state that}} Fort Allen dates from 1775 and was {{originally}} named for Revolutionary War hero Ethan Allen.

Fort Allen was rebuilt in 1814 with city resources, adding a magazine and barracks due to the British capture of Eastport and Castine in the War of 1812. A plaque at the park states that at this time it was named for Master Commandant William Henry Allen, a naval officer mortally wounded in the War of 1812.|$|E

In this capacity he was present at the Battle of Rappahannock River in April 1813, and took part in the various actions against Joshua Barney's Chesapeake Bay Flotilla in mid-1814. In January 1815, while commanding the Albion he conducted a boat expedition up St. Marys River, Georgia, before returning to Cumberland Island, with a ship loaded with timber, and an English East Indiaman which had been captured by an American privateer. He also embarked all the produce collected at the town of St. Mary's in the vessels taken there by Captain Robert Barrie, blew up the fort on Point Peter and a <b>battery</b> (<b>mounting</b> six 24-pounders and two brass 6-pounders) and destroyed the barracks and storehouses, together with some merchandise and guns that were not deemed fit to bring away.|$|E

Remains of structures within the enclosure include a barrel-vaulted powder magazine built around 1806, with a gun platform above.

5000|$|These {{are rarely}} {{converted}} {{due to their}} excessive weight, and aerodynamic inefficiencies. To make the situation worse, many modern trucks and SUVs continue to get bulkier, heavier, and their high stance means {{the height of the}} center of gravity leads to instability while making high speed turns, a distinct disadvantage if there is not enough room between the frame rails to enable low <b>battery</b> <b>mounting.</b> As a direct result, the payload carrying capacity and thus the GVWR of the vehicles goes down. Such a trait is not desirable because it limits the weight of the battery pack that can be carried, limiting the maximum battery-to-vehicle weight ratio that could be achieved for the vehicle when converted to an EV. (Such considerations are important due to price, weight, and performance limitations of current battery technologies.) For a given battery type, reducing the battery-to-vehicle weight ratio always results in reduced vehicle range per charge. However, despite these mostly unavoidable limitations, several SUVs and larger trucks have been successfully converted to electric power by hobbyists. Some examples include the [...] "Gone Postal" [...] van converted to an EV racer by Roderick Wilde and Suckamps EV Racing, the Land Rover EV converted by Wilde Evolutions, and the 1988 Jeep Cherokee EV converted by Nick Viera.|$|E
