50|$|Ohio University {{plans to}} reduce {{greenhouse}} gas emissions 20 percent from 2004 levels by 2014. Alden Library located on campus has a program to automatically shut down all computers once the library closes, having most computers already containing energy efficient LED monitors. A campus-wide efficiency upgrade beginning in April 2000 started a 10-year campus renewal project through a performance contract with the company Vestar. Completed projects through the 10-year plan include: “Carbon-dioxide monitors were installed in Morton and Boyd Halls,; Heat recovery and heat exchangers were installed in the Life Science Center, Installation of power factor correction capacitor bank—the {{second half of the}} 69 kV system had new 1,340 kVAR capacitors installed to reduce KVA <b>billing</b> <b>demand</b> costs; Heat economizers were installed in Lausche Heating Plant” just to name a few. Ohio has also successfully developed the Green House Project that offers incentives of at least $500 to landlords for improving their energy efficiency in off-campus housing which has achieved annual reductions of more than 67,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity and more than 74 tons of avoided carbon emissions.|$|E
50|$|Originally AMR devices just {{collected}} meter readings electronically and matched {{them with}} accounts. As technology has advanced, additional data {{could then be}} captured, stored, and transmitted to the main computer, and often the metering devices could be controlled remotely. This can include events alarms such as tamper, leak detection, low battery, or reverse flow. Many AMR devices can also capture interval data, and log meter events. The logged data {{can be used to}} collect or control time of use or rate of use data {{that can be used for}} water or energy usage profiling, time of use <b>billing,</b> <b>demand</b> forecasting, demand response, rate of flow recording, leak detection, flow monitoring, water and energy conservation enforcement, remote shutoff, etc. Advanced Metering Infrastructure, or AMI is the new term coined to represent the networking technology of fixed network meter systems that go beyond AMR into remote utility management. The meters in an AMI system are often referred to as smart meters, since they often can use collected data based on programmed logic.|$|E

40|$|Demand charges {{account for}} one-third to {{one-half}} {{of industrial and}} commercial electricity bills, and yet they have been virtually ignored, both theoretically and practically, {{as a component of}} residential tariffs. Our objective here is twofold: (1) to model and test the effects of a time-of-use demand charge on residential consumer behavior and (2) to evaluate, theoretically and empirically, its influence on utility system peak. Among the pragmatic issues are the effects of sustained hot weather on household response and the effects of the charge on demand at time of system peak compared to <b>billing</b> <b>demand.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|After the {{oil crisis}} of 1973, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) in 1976 ordered Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PGandE) to charge its large nonresidential {{customers}} with monthly <b>billing</b> <b>demand</b> of over 4000 kilowatts (kW) mandatory time-of-use rates. Using a translog (TLOG) specification attributable to Christensen, Jorgenson, and Lau (1973), Chung and Aigner (1981) estimate the electricity demand price elasticities by time-of-use for 64 of these customers in 13 Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code groups. Own-price elasticity estimates are generally around - 0. 1 {{and at times}} can {{be as high as}} - 0. 5, or they have the wrong sign. Cross-price elasticity estimates indicate that electricity usages by time-of-use are mostly substitutes. However, the estimated price responsiveness typically is larger than observed usages (see below and the section, Experimental Design and Data). Moreover, positive own-price elasticity estimates, though not statistically significant, raise further doubts about the validity of empirical results. ...|$|E

40|$|Work Description: The Commission {{had ordered}} Con Edison {{and all other}} New York State {{electric}} utilities to implement a reactive-power demand charge for all customers with electric <b>billed</b> <b>demand</b> over 500 kW. In order to meet this regulatory mandate, {{it is necessary to}} upgrade qualifying customer metering to measure and record interval-usage data in both kWh and kVar. It is also necessary to contact the meters on a daily basis to obtain the usage data for customer presentment online and for monthly billing calculation. Reactive power billing has been implemented as required for customers with monthly <b>billed</b> <b>demands</b> between 1, 000 kW and 1, 499 kW and with demand between 500 kW and 999 kW. Meter exchanges for the remaining customers with demands over 1, 499 kW will be complete by the end of 2014. The costs below are associated with on-going communication costs for the data transmitted over the teleservice provider’s line. Additional costs are associated with operators of the Meter Data Management System (MDMS) to manage the flow of interval data, Senior Customer Service Representatives to provide customer service functions, and to provide customer outreach and education encouraging customers to take positive action in mitigating the charge, and in-turn benefiting Con Edison’s distribution system.

50|$|Embraer {{intended}} to use components from the Embraer E-190 {{to allow for a}} quick development, but the Brazilian Air Force (paying the <b>bill)</b> <b>demanded</b> performance at least equal to the C-130. Before 2009, Embraer decided to develop the KC-390 from scratch, having nothing in common with the E-190. In Embraer's view, the jet engine is sufficiently resilient to dust ingestion, whereas propeller tips close to the ground are susceptible to damage. Embraer also chose the V2500 engines for efficiency in ordinary conditions rather than performance in unusual conditions.|$|R

These arguments, and above all the fear of provoking a ministerial crisis, triumphed over the resistance of a part of the republicans.

50|$|The most {{prominent}} {{sport in the}} rivalry is football. The two teams began competing {{against each other in}} 1970. The football series between the two teams was suspended in 1987.

NC State’s athletics administration had publicly warned ECU and Pirate fans after two consecutive years of minor vandalisms to the stadium. The schools would not meet again until the 1992 Peach Bowl. In 1996, the two schools met in Charlotte's Bank of America Stadium rather than on either school's home field.
