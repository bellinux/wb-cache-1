25|$|Also in late 2012, using systems {{metabolic}} engineering, a Korean {{research team}} at the former Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) has succeeded in demonstrating an optimized process to increase butanol production by generating an engineered bacterium. Professor Sang Yup Lee at the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, KAIST, Dr. Do Young Seung at GS Caltex, a large oil refining company in Korea, and Dr. Yu-Sin Jang at BioFuelChem, a startup butanol company in Korea, applied a systems metabolic engineering approach to improve the production of butanol through enhancing the performance of Clostridium acetobutylicum, {{one of the best}} known butanol-producing bacteria. In addition, the downstream process was optimized and an in situ recovery process was integrated to achieve higher butanol titer, yield, and productivity. The combination of systems metabolic engineering and <b>bioprocess</b> optimization resulted {{in the development of a}} process capable of producing more than 585g of butanol from 1.8kg of glucose, which allows the production of this important industrial solvent and advanced biofuel to be cost competitive.|$|E

[...] A key ability of microbial cellulose for medical applications {{is that it can}} easily be molded into various shapes while still retaining all of its useful properties. [...] By molding microbial cellulose into long, hollow tubes, they can be used as replacement structures for several different areas, such as the cardiovascular system, the digestive tract, urinary tract, or the trachea. [...] A recent application of microbial cellulose has been as synthetic blood vessels and stents.

40|$|Good {{physiological}} {{performance of}} industrial microbes {{is crucial for}} successful <b>bioprocesses.</b> Conventional metabolism-oriented engineering strategies often fail to obtain expected phenotypes owing to focusing narrowly on targeted metabolic capabilities while neglecting microbial physiological responses to environmental stresses. To meet the new challenges posed by the biotechnological production of fuels, chemicals and materials, microbes should exert strong physiological robustness and fitness, in addition to strong metabolic capabilities, {{to enable them to}} work efficiently in actual <b>bioprocesses.</b> Here, we address the importance of engineering physiological functionalities into microbes and illustrate the operation procedure.

Ideally, future <b>bioprocesses</b> will meet the demands of commercial chemical markets in an economical fashion while being sustainable through the use of renewable starting materials. A number of different renewable and abundant biopolymers (e.g., cellulose, hemicelluloses, lignin, and chitin) are potential starting material for sustainable <b>bioprocesses,</b> but a broad challenge remains on how to efficiently depolymerize these biopolymers to generate monomeric sugars that can be metabolized by industrial microorganisms or other useful building block chemicals. Indeed, a variety of specialty chemicals may be able to be generated from these various monomers. This review focuses on the biopolymer chitin and discusses research and knowledge relevant to chitin degradation and potential chemical products that can be made from chitin degradation products.|$|R

40|$|Although biogeomorphological {{research}} is well-established, with many studies {{on a range}} of two-way interrelations between organisms and geomorphology in different environments, there is little consensus over what constitutes biogeomorphology, why it might be useful and where it is heading. Starting with definitions of core biogeomorphic processes, we consider the need for future biogeomorphological studies to evaluate the crucial links between <b>bioprocesses,</b> biological community dynamics and ‘inorganic’ earth surface processes. Five key applications of biogeomorphological research are identified; the roles of organisms in environmental reconstruction, trace fossil analysis, extraterrestrial geomorphology, environmental engineering and the built environment. Some key research directions and methodological challenges for future biogeomorphological research include expanding the spatial and temporal coverage of datasets, investigating the role of <b>bioprocesses</b> in landform development, tackling scale issues, investigating the relevance of nonlinear dynamical ideas to biogeomorphology and developing better sampling and monitoring techniques for <b>bioprocesses...</b>|$|R
40|$|Recently {{there is}} a great demand for {{extending}} high throughput life science research to biomanufacturing. However, {{there is a}} gap from life science research to bio-manufacturing. Most of existing Bio-workflow tools/systems only provide an isolated solution to help bioscientist to orchestrate bio-R&D operations such as bio-database query, bio-computation and analysis etc for specific small bio-problems. They are static and lack of ability to adapt themselves in a dynamic changing environment. Bio-manufacturing involves many <b>bioprocesses,</b> each of which needs to choreographs a set of bio-workflows. Currently, none of the existing workflow systems support integrations of workflows from different workflow tools. Bio-scientists have to manually define and manage the workflows for <b>bioprocesses</b> through different workflow tools. This paper proposes a novel goal-oriented approach to modeling <b>bioprocesses,</b> to choreographing bio-workflows from different workflow tools, and to integrating agents, web services and workflows for automated execution. It also demonstrates how a multi-agent system can be further derived to adapt and automate complex bio-manufacturing workflow/processes in a dynamic changing environment. I...|$|R
