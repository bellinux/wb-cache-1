25|$|A {{conclusion}} {{from the}} above is that the <b>buckling</b> <b>load</b> of a column may be increased by changing its material to one with a higher modulus of elasticity (E), or changing {{the design of the}} column's cross section so as to increase the its moment of inertia.

25|$|The {{buckling}} {{strength of a}} member {{is less than the}} elastic {{buckling strength}} of a structure if the material of the member is stressed beyond the elastic material range and into the non-linear (plastic) material behavior range. When the compression load is near the <b>buckling</b> <b>load,</b> the structure will bend significantly and the material of the column will diverge from a linear stress-strain behavior. The stress-strain behavior of materials is not strictly linear even below the yield point, hence the modulus of elasticity decreases as stress increases, and significantly so as the stresses approach the material's yield strength. This reduced material rigidity reduces the buckling strength of the structure and results in a bucking load less than that predicted by the assumption of linear elastic behavior.|$|E

Issues that cause {{deviation from the}} pure Euler column behaviour include imperfections in geometry of the column in combination with plasticity/non-linear stress strain behaviour of the column's material.

40|$|When a pin-ended {{circular}} steel arch {{having a}} radius R {{is subjected to}} a uniform radial load q, the arch is trivially considered in the uniform axial compression N = qR without bending. However, the transverse loading may produce bending as well as axial compression in the arch, particularly in shallow arches, and the arch may deform considerably prior to buckling.

The effects of gradient parameters on the critical <b>buckling</b> <b>loads</b> are elucidated. Finally, we give an example to illustrate the enhancement of the load-carrying capacity of tapered beams for admissible shape profiles with constant volume or weight.

Three-dimensional finite element models of laminated plates with four layers have been established. The square delaminations exist between second/third layers.
