5|$|TNA {{held the}} first-ever <b>Barbed</b> Wire Massacre at Turning Point between Abyss and Sabu. TNA advertised the <b>Barbed</b> Wire Massacre between Abyss and Sabu on the November19 episode of Impact!. The {{reasoning}} behind the match stipulation {{had to do}} with Abyss fearing <b>barbed</b> wire in the storyline. Abyss challenged this fear on the December3 episode of Impact!, by bashing Sabu over the head with a <b>barbed</b> wire wrapped steal chair. Sabu defeated Abyss at the event to end their rivalry.|$|E
5|$|A spine is a sharp, {{needle-like}} structure used {{to inflict}} pain on predators. An {{example of this}} seen in nature is in the Sohal surgeonfish. These fish have a sharp scalpel-like spine {{on the front of}} each of their tail fins, able to inflict deep wounds. The area around the spines is often brightly colored to advertise the defensive capability; predators often avoid the Sohal surgeonfish. Defensive spines may be detachable, <b>barbed</b> or poisonous. Porcupine spines are long, stiff, break at the tip, and are <b>barbed</b> to stick into a would-be predator. In contrast, the hedgehog's short spines, which are modified hairs, readily bend, and are <b>barbed</b> into the body, so they are not easily lost; they may be jabbed at an attacker.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} years border fortifications inside the city mostly {{consisted}} of brick walls with a top made of <b>barbed</b> wire. Clay bricks and concrete slabs were used for construction. Further obstacles of <b>barbed</b> wire and upstate walls delimitated the East and at some places, like Bernauer Straße, bricked-up buildings formed the boundary line. The buildings were situated on East-Berlin territory, whereas the pavement {{in front of the}} houses belonged to West-Berlin. In many places safety installations of West-Berlin's outer ring consisted of metal fences and <b>barbed</b> wire barriers. Technologically advanced upgrading took place later on and only in 1975 L-shaped concrete segments that were known from the fall of the Wall were added.|$|E
5|$|Projectile points {{featuring}} more Archaic characteristics, including early <b>barbed</b> {{and early}} stemmed, share an overlapping chronology with Golondrina.|$|E
5|$|TNA {{held the}} first-ever <b>Barbed</b> Wire Massacre at Turning Point between Abyss and Sabu. This match {{was the result}} of a long-standing rivalry between the two that began at Unbreakable. There, Abyss {{defeated}} Sabu in a No Disqualification match. Abyss and Sabu competed in a Monster's Ball match at Bound for Glory alongside Jeff Hardy and Rhino, which Rhino won. At Genesis, Abyss defeated Sabu in another No Disqualification match. TNA advertised the <b>Barbed</b> Wire Massacre between Abyss and Sabu on the November19, 2005 episode of Impact!. The reasoning behind the match stipulation had to do with Abyss fearing <b>barbed</b> wire in the storyline. Abyss challenged this fear on the December3 episode ofImpact!, by bashing Sabu over the head with a <b>barbed</b> wire wrapped steel chair.|$|E
5|$|The Joseph F. Glidden House {{is located}} in the United States in the DeKalb County, Illinois city of DeKalb. It was the home to the famed {{inventor}} of <b>barbed</b> wire Joseph Glidden. The barn, still located on the property near several commercial buildings, is said to be where Glidden perfected his improved version of <b>barbed</b> wire which would eventually transform him into a successful entrepreneur. The Glidden House was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. The home was designed by another <b>barbed</b> wire patent holder in DeKalb, Jacob Haish.|$|E
5|$|Unsuitable {{backyard}} {{fruit tree}} netting also kills many animals and may {{bring them into}} close contact with humans, but can be avoided by using wildlife-safe netting. <b>Barbed</b> wire may also lead to casualties; this can be ameliorated by removing old or unnecessary <b>barbed</b> wire or marking it with bright paint.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to normal-length spines, {{members of the}} subfamily Opuntioideae have relatively short spines, called glochids, that are <b>barbed</b> along their length and easily shed. These enter the skin and are difficult to remove, causing long-lasting irritation.|$|E
5|$|Judas Mesias and Abyss {{continued}} their feud heading into Against All Odds. There, Abyss fought Mesias in the second-ever <b>Barbed</b> Wire Massacre. Abyss won the contest, ending the feud.|$|E
5|$|Next was a Hardcore {{match between}} Randy Orton and Cactus Jack for the WWE Intercontinental Championship. One {{spot in the}} match saw Cactus lie a <b>barbed</b> wire {{baseball}} bat between Orton's legs and perform a leg drop. Cactus continued to use the bat, as he poured gasoline on it and tried to light it on fire. Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff interrupted and informed Cactus {{that he would be}} disqualified and the event would end if he lit the bat on fire. Orton executed an RKO on Cactus onto the <b>barbed</b> wire baseball bat to retain the title.|$|E
5|$|The {{bags are}} laid in courses, with <b>barbed</b> wire between each course to prevent slipping. Each course is tamped {{after it is}} laid.|$|E
5|$|There were {{no major}} issues {{suffered}} from the <b>Barbed</b> Wire Massacre. It was reported after the event that there were issues ordering the show in the Australian market.|$|E
5|$|An {{unexpected}} {{bonus of}} the Bruneval raid was the Germans' {{efforts to improve}} defences at Würzburg stations and prevent similar attacks. The radars were surrounded by rings of <b>barbed</b> wire which increased their visibility from the air, making them easier to target prior to Operation Overlord.|$|E
5|$|Crossing {{points in}} the defence network– bridges, tunnels and other weak spots– were called nodes or points of resistance. These were {{fortified}} with removable road blocks, <b>barbed</b> wire entanglements, and land mines. These passive defences were overlooked by trench works, gun and mortar emplacements, and pillboxes. In places entire villages were fortified using barriers of scaffolding, sandbagged positions and loopholes in existing buildings.|$|E
5|$|Cubes, {{cylinders}} and pimples {{were deployed}} in long rows, often several rows deep, to form anti-tank barriers at beaches and inland. They {{were also used}} in smaller numbers to block roads. They frequently sported loops at the top for the attachment of <b>barbed</b> wire. There was also a tetrahedral or caltrop-shaped obstacle, although it seems these were rare.|$|E
5|$|The 42nd Division's {{participation}} in the Meuse-Argonne Offensive began on 14 October when it attacked with both brigades. That evening, a conference was called to discuss the attack, during which Charles Pelot Summerall, commander of the First Infantry Division and V Corps, telephoned and demanded that Châtillon be taken by 18:00 the next evening. An aerial photograph had been obtained that showed {{a gap in the}} German <b>barbed</b> wire to the northeast of Châtillon. Lieutenant Colonel Walter E. Bare—the commander of the 167th Infantry—proposed an attack from that direction, where the defenses seemed least imposing, covered by a machine-gun barrage. MacArthur adopted this plan. He was wounded, but not severely, while verifying the existence of the gap in the <b>barbed</b> wire.|$|E
5|$|The second-ever <b>Barbed</b> Wire Massacre was {{promoted}} for Against All Odds between Abyss and Judas Mesias. The feud for this match began in mid-2007 when Abyss' former manager Father James Mitchell returned {{and began a}} storyline with Abyss. Mesias made his debut on the September 13, 2007 episode of Impact! attacking Abyss {{at the request of}} Mitchell. After months of inactivity, Mesias returned on the December 13, 2007 episode of Impact! attacking Abyss. At Final Resolution, Mesias defeated Abyss with help from Mitchell. On the January 24 episode of Impact!, Mitchell finally announced his reasons for feuding with Abyss, that he was Abyss' father and Mesias was Abyss' half-brother in the narrative. TNA promoted a <b>Barbed</b> Wire Massacre match between Abyss and Mesias at Against All Odds sometime after this.|$|E
5|$|The second-ever <b>Barbed</b> Wire Massacre was {{the sixth}} match {{on the card}} between Abyss and Judas Mesias, who was {{accompanied}} by Father James Mitchell. Its duration was fourteen minutes and fifty-one seconds. It was featured from the TNA Impact! Zone in Orlando, Florida, because the city of Greenville, SC refused to allow a match that violent to take place live. In <b>Barbed</b> Wire Massacre, the ring ropes are switched with strands of barbed-wire and several weapons are featured wrapped in barbed-wire. The match falls under no disqualifications rules and is won by either a pinfall or submission. Mesias bashed Abyss {{over the head with}} a barbed-wire wrapped chair, which caused Abyss to bleed from the forehead. Abyss performed his signature Black Hole Slam maneuver on Mitchell after he interfered in the bout. Abyss won the contest after using the Black Hole Slam to drop Mesias onto a barbed-wire wrapped board.|$|E
5|$|The video {{opens with}} a bench chair inside a pale-blue room, {{surrounded}} by interior waterfalls. Glitches of Hamasaki appears, and she starts singing the song while seated. The next scene features damaged–archive footage of a destroyed town, fenced in with <b>barbed</b> wires. A young boy, with pale white skin, blonde dreads, and angel wings, appears in the distance. Several scenes features the boy looking towards the camera, which then inter cuts to scenes with Hamasaki singing the song in the room. The young boy wonders through the destroyed town, observing damaged homes and objects. The boy places his hands upon a dying tree, where he envisions the events of how the town became destroyed and dismantled. These scenes include burning flowers, falling construction, and broken religious statues. The second chorus has Hamasaki singing, and the song break shows the boy observing a blossoming flower which hasn't died. Smiling, he walks towards it, unbeknown that there is sharp <b>barbed</b> wire surrounding it. Scenes features Hamasaki singing, and shows brief inter cut scenes of <b>barbed</b> wire wrapped around the young boy. Struggling to become free from the wire, the young boy dies and leaves behind a large pile of angel feathers. The final scene features Hamasaki wearing exactly the same outfit as the angel, trapped in a large bird cage, in the room the video started with. The video zooms out on the overall appearance of her.|$|E
5|$|The {{village of}} Villy lies about one {{kilometer}} {{to the northwest}} of ouvrage La Ferté. Villy itself was fortified {{with more than a}} dozen blockhouses, along with networks of <b>barbed</b> wire and tank obstacles. The blockhouses were primarily prepared, reinforced firing positions and did not necessarily possess fixed armament.|$|E
5|$|To deter pursuits of marching {{infantry}} or riding cavalry, the Han Chinese made caltrops (<b>barbed</b> iron balls {{with sharp}} spikes sticking {{out in all}} directions) that could be scattered {{on the ground and}} pierce the feet or hooves of those who were unaware of them.|$|E
5|$|With all the {{evidence}} pointing to an impending Turkish assault, the ANZAC troops were ordered to stand-to at 03:00, half an hour earlier than normal, and they improvised defences by throwing out rolls of <b>barbed</b> wire on rests {{to the front of}} their lines.|$|E
5|$|World War I saw great {{changes in}} the use of cavalry. The mode of warfare changed, and the use of trench warfare, <b>barbed</b> wire and machine guns {{rendered}} traditional cavalry almost obsolete. Tanks, introduced in 1917, began to take over the role of shock combat.|$|E
5|$|After the new Burgundians realise {{they are}} not subject to post-war {{rationing}} or other bureaucratic restrictions, the district is quickly flooded with black marketeers and shoppers; Spiller is unable to handle the rising problems by himself. In response, the British authorities surround the Burgundian territory with <b>barbed</b> wire. The residents retaliate against what they see as heavy-handed bureaucratic action; they stop a London Underground train as it passes through Burgundy, and ask to see passports of all passengers: those without documents are unable to proceed.|$|E
5|$|Another of the property's buildings, {{commonly}} called the carriage house, never {{lived up to}} its popular name. The building never housed any carriages; it was, in fact, built to house automobiles. The southern section of the carriage house was constructed sometime between 1908 and 1912 and features a mansard roof. The building is sheathed in stucco and presently houses a collection of antique carriages and sleighs as well as a <b>barbed</b> wire history museum.|$|E
5|$|At {{about this}} time, Nasu's left wing battalions {{finally began to}} reach the Marine defenses. At 00:30 on 25 October, the 11th Company of Nasu's 3rd Battalion under Captain Jiro Katsumata found and {{attacked}} Company A of Puller's battalion. Katsumata's attack was impeded by heavy <b>barbed</b> wire {{in front of the}} Marine line and then hit heavily by American machine gun, mortar, and artillery fire. By 01:00, the Marine fire had killed most of Katsumata's company.|$|E
5|$|Aware of {{the time}} constraints, Otway decided he could wait no longer, and the reduced {{battalion}} headed for the battery and joined up with Major Smith's reconnaissance party just outside the village of Gonneville en Auge. The reconnaissance party had cut a way through the <b>barbed</b> wire, and marked four routes through the minefield. Otway divided his men into four assault groups, and settled down to await {{the arrival of the}} three gliders.|$|E
5|$|Beaches {{were blocked}} with {{entanglements}} of <b>barbed</b> wire, {{usually in the}} form of three coils of concertina wire fixed by metal posts, or a simple fence of straight wires supported on waist-high posts. The wire would also demarcate extensive minefields, with both anti-tank and anti-personnel mines on and behind the beaches. On many of the more remote beaches this combination of wire and mines represented {{the full extent of the}} passive defences.|$|E
5|$|Between 1994 and 2003, five flint {{artefacts}} {{were discovered}} near the Shimna River. A flake, two blades and a concave scraper {{were found in}} two locations in Tollymore Forest. The flake, scraper {{and one of the}} blades were identified as prehistoric. The second blade was identified as Late Mesolithic or Early Neolithic. A Bronze Age <b>barbed</b> and tanged arrowhead was found in a nearby field.|$|E
5|$|De Hauteclocque {{broke his}} leg {{in two places}} in a fall from his horse in 1936. He told his company {{that it was his}} own fault for riding on the {{shoulder}} of the road. Thereafter he frequently walked with a cane. After another mishap involving losing his way during a tactical exercise and getting stuck in a field cordoned off with <b>barbed</b> wire, he told them that when you have done something really stupid, it is best to admit it.|$|E
5|$|Ecologically, {{woodpeckers}} {{help to keep}} trees healthy {{by keeping}} them from suffering mass infestations. The family is noted {{for its ability to}} acquire wood-boring grubs from the trunks and branches, whether the timber is alive or dead. Having hammered a hole into the wood, the prey is extracted by use of a long, <b>barbed</b> tongue. Woodpeckers consume beetles that burrow into trees, removing as many as 85 percent of emerald ash borer larvae from individual ash trees.|$|E
5|$|Following the Royal Rumble, Randy Orton and Kurt Angle began feuding with The Undertaker and Shawn Michaels, respectively. The Big Show faced JBL in {{the first}} ever <b>barbed</b> wire steel cage match for the title at No Way Out, which JBL won to retain the title. Orton briefly feuded with Christian {{before moving on to}} feud with The Undertaker, which spanned nine months. After losing his title match at No Way Out, The Big Show faced Akebono in a sumo match at WrestleMania, and he briefly feuded with Carlito afterwards.|$|E
5|$|From {{the time}} of the invasion, {{significant}} numbers of Belgian men had attempted to flee the occupied territories to join the Belgian army on the Yser front, via the Netherlands which were neutral. In order to stop this, the Germans began work on a <b>barbed</b> wire and electric fence across the length of the border. The fence, dubbed the Wire of Death (Dodendraad), was also guarded by German sentries. Between 2,000 and 3,000 civilians are believed to have been killed attempting to cross the border during the conflict.|$|E
5|$|Imaginative spectators {{would climb}} {{the church and}} watch a {{football}} game from the rooftop however they have now been deterred from doing so with the installation of security measures such as <b>barbed</b> wire and anti-climb paint. In addition, {{the introduction of the}} 'all-seater' ruling following the Taylor Report has meant that spectators no longer resort to climbing nearby buildings for a glimpse of the event as a seat is guaranteed with a purchased ticket.|$|E
5|$|Sir Arthur Churchman bought Orford Castle in 1928, and in 1930 {{gave the}} {{property}} to the Orford Town Trust; an appeal for money to maintain and restore it began shortly afterwards. During the Second World War the castle was refortified with <b>barbed</b> wire to form what was originally intended to be an anti-aircraft emplacement, with Nissen huts erected around the keep. The castle was instead used as a radar emplacement, and a concrete floor was installed in the south-east tower to support the equipment. These buildings were removed {{at the end of}} the conflict.|$|E
5|$|Ten miles (16km) of <b>barbed</b> wire {{was used}} to secure Wembley Stadium against {{unauthorised}} entry. The pre-match entertainment was music by the Band of the Irish Guards, and communal singing backed by the band of the Royal Horse Guards. Inclement weather prevented the attendance of King George V. Instead the guest of honour was the Duke of York. Other guests present included Baron Wigram, Admiral Sir Lionel Halsey, Austrian envoy Baron von Franckenstein and the West Indies cricket team.|$|E
