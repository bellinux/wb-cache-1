40|$|Abstract: <b>Video</b> <b>clip</b> {{retrieval}} plays {{a critical}} role in the content-based video retrieval. Two major concerns in this issue are: (1) automatic segmentation and retrieval of similar <b>video</b> <b>clips</b> from <b>video</b> database; (2) similarity ranking of similar <b>video</b> <b>clips.</b> In this paper, motivated by the maximal matching and optimal matching in graph theory, a novel approach is proposed for <b>video</b> <b>clip</b> retrieval based on matching theory. To tackle the clip segmentation and retrieval, the retrieval process is divided into two phases: shot-based retrieval and clip-based retrieval. In shot-based retrieval, a shot is temporally partitioned into several sub-shots based on motion content. The similarity among shots is measured according to the color content of sub-shots. In clip-based retrieval, candidates of similar <b>video</b> <b>clips</b> are selected by modeling the continuity of similar shots. Maximal matching based on Hungarian algorithm is then adopted to obtain the final similar <b>video</b> <b>clips.</b> To rank the similarity of the selected <b>video</b> <b>clips,</b> four different factors: visual similarity, granularity, interference and temporal order of shots are taken into consideration. These factors are modeled by optimal matching based on Kuhn-Munkres algorithm and dynamic programming. Experimental results indicate that the proposed approach is effective and efficient in retrieving and ranking similar <b>video</b> <b>clips...</b>|$|R
40|$|Recently, <b>video</b> <b>clips</b> {{have become}} very popular online. Massive influx of <b>video</b> <b>clips</b> has created an urgent need for video search engines to {{facilitate}} retrieving relevant clips. Different from traditional long <b>videos,</b> a <b>video</b> <b>clip</b> is a short video often expressing a moment of significance. Due to high complexity of video data, efficient <b>video</b> <b>clip</b> search from large databases {{turns out to be}} very challenging. We propose a novel <b>video</b> <b>clip</b> representation model called Bounded Coordinate System (BCS), which is the first single representative capturing the dominating content and content changing trends of a <b>video</b> <b>clip.</b> It summarizes a <b>video</b> <b>clip</b> by a coordinate system, where each of its coordinate axes is identified by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and bounded by the range of data projections along the axis. The similarity measure of BCS considers the operations of translation, rotation and scaling for coordinate system matching. Particularly, rotation and scaling reflect the difference of content tendencies. Compared with the quadratic time complexity of existing methods, the time complexity of measuring BCS similarity is linear. The compact video representation together with its linear similarity measure makes real-time search from <b>video</b> <b>clip</b> collections feasible. To further improve the retrieval efficiency for large video databases, a two-dimensional transformation method called Bi-Distance Transformation (BDT) is introduce...|$|R
