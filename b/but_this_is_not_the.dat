5|$|It {{is true that}} a {{house that}} is between two {{destroyed}} homes can be undamaged, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> result of a tornado skipping, as some previously thought. After the 1974 Super Outbreak, Dr. Ted Fujita studied many films of tornadoes from that day. Included in his review was damage and tornado film footage of F4 and F5 tornadoes. Fujita concluded that multiple vortices, highly volatile tornadic satellites transiting within a parent tornado at high speeds, are responsible for making tornadoes appear to skip houses. The phenomenon of satellite tornadoes, where a smaller tornado orbits a larger companion tornado, {{can also lead to}} gaps in damage between the two tornadoes.|$|E
5|$|Many {{crocodilians}} are {{hunted for}} their skins, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> {{case with the}} Cuvier's dwarf caiman. This may be because the ventral skin in this species is too heavily armoured {{to make it easy}} to tan. Some individuals are killed by indigenous peoples for food and others, particularly in Guyana, are collected for the pet trade; but {{there is no evidence that}} populations are dwindling as a result. There are some threats to this species from habitat destruction, including the mining of gold, but these are not thought to be of great significance. The estimated total population is over one million individuals.|$|E

5|$|More recently, {{research}} at the Duke Lemur Center {{has shown that the}} ring-tailed lemur can organize sequences in memory and retrieve ordered sequences without language. The experimental design demonstrated that the lemurs were using internal representation of the sequence to guide their responses and not simply following a trained sequence, where one item in the sequence cues the selection of the next. <b>But</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> limit of the ring-tailed lemur's reasoning skills. Another study, performed at the Myakka City Lemur Reserve, suggests that this species along with several other closely related lemur species understand simple arithmetic operations.|$|E

25|$|Eyes {{in various}} animals show {{adaptation}} to their requirements. For example, {{the eye of}} a bird of prey has much greater visual acuity than a human eye, and in some cases can detect ultraviolet radiation. The different forms of eye in, for example, vertebrates and molluscs are examples of parallel evolution, despite their distant common ancestry. Phenotypic convergence of the geometry of cephalopod and most vertebrate eyes creates the impression that the vertebrate eye evolved from an imaging cephalopod eye, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> case, as the reversed roles of their respective ciliary and rhabdomeric opsin classes and different lens crystallins show.|$|E

25|$|Mary, {{the wife}} of Clopas, is named only once in the New Testament, in , where she is listed as one of four women {{standing}} by the Cross, the others being Mary the mother of Jesus, her sister (or perhaps cousin, the Aramaic words being the same), and Mary Magdalene. An alternative reading is that the list is of only three women, and that Mary of Clopas is also the sister (or cousin) of Mary the mother of Jesus, as some traditions maintain. The passage could also be interpreted to mean that Mary of Clopas is Clopas' daughter, rather than his wife, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> general view.|$|E
25|$|The {{environmental}} effects of motorized bicycles varies according to the power source. Most electric bicycles are considered {{by some to be}} zero-emissions vehicles, as they emit no combustion byproducts. However, the {{environmental effects}} of electricity generation and power distribution from plants generating power from fossil fuels, as well as manufacturing and disposing of (limited life) high storage density batteries containing toxic materials must also be taken into account. Older two stroke engines, commonly use in motorized bicycles powered by internal combustion engines often emitted more pollution than automobiles due to partial combustion of oil included in the fuel, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> case with four-stroke or newer 2 stroke motor designs.|$|E
25|$|The native {{language}} of the Urapmin {{is known as the}} Urapmin or Urap language (Urap: urap weng), a member of the Mountain Ok subfamily of the Ok languages. Although Urap is linguistically intermediate between its geographic neighbors Telefol and Tifal, it is not a dialect of either. Multilingualism among the Urapmin has led many Telefolmin to believe that the Urapmin speak Telefol among themselves, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> case. Although the Urapmin view the Tifal language as being closer to Urap than the Telefol language is, and an early account claimed that the Urapmin speak Tifal, more recent research indicates that they should not be considered the same language. Urap remains in vigorous use among the Urapmin, and is the main language that they use.|$|E

25|$|The Bell Beaker {{culture is}} {{understood}} as not only a particular pottery type, but also a complete and complex cultural phenomenon involving metalwork in copper, gold and later bronze, archery, specific types of ornamentation and shared ideological, cultural and religious ideas. The Bell Beaker period marks a period of cultural contact in Atlantic and Western Europe on a scale not seen previously, nor seen again in succeeding periods. It can be seen initially as the western equivalent of the contemporary Corded Ware culture, though from c. 2400 BC Bell Beaker expanded eastwards over parts of Central and Eastern Europe where Corded Ware previously thrived. Thus in parts of Central and Eastern Europe, as far east as Poland, there is a sequence from Corded Ware to Bell Beaker, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> case in Iberia, France or the British Isles, where Corded Ware is unknown.|$|E
25|$|A {{family is}} indexed by an index set. In {{the case of}} a family of {{operations}} forming an algebra, the indices are called operation symbols, constituting the language of that algebra. The operation indexed by each symbol is called the denotation or interpretation of that symbol. Each operation symbol specifies the arity of its interpretation, whence all possible interpretations of a symbol have the same arity. In general it is possible for an algebra to interpret distinct symbols with the same operation, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> case for the prototype, whose symbols are in one-one correspondence with its operations. The prototype therefore has 22n n-ary operation symbols, called the Boolean operation symbols and forming the language of Boolean algebra. Only a few operations have conventional symbols, such as ¬ for negation, ∧ for conjunction, and ∨ for disjunction. It is convenient to consider the i-th n-ary symbol to be n'f'i as done below in the section on truth tables.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} avian species use nasal salt glands, {{alongside}} their kidneys, to control hypertonicity {{in their blood}} plasma. However, the common ostrich shows no nasal glandular function in regard to this homeostatic process. Even {{in a state of}} dehydration, which increases the osmolality of the blood, nasal salt glands show no sizeable contribution of salt elimination. Also, the overall mass of the glands was less than that of the duck’s nasal gland. The common ostrich, having a heavier body weight, should have larger, heavier nasal glands to more effectively excrete salt from a larger volume of blood, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> case. These unequal proportions contribute to the assumption that the common ostrich’s nasal glands do not play any role in salt excretion. The nasal glands {{may be the result of}} an ancestral trait, which is no longer needed by the common ostrich, but has not been bred out of their gene pool.|$|E

25|$|Between 1977 and 1979 (possibly at {{the time}} of Macleod-Greensborough duplication, '79) a 'back platform' was {{constructed}} at Macleod, the approach to which is approximately on the former Mont Park line alignment. It is a common misconception that the track into the back platform is the remaining section of the Mont Park line formerly used for stabling, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> case, it does not curve in the same direction and is of a different gradient. At {{the same time as the}} back platform was constructed, three stabling sidings were built at the Up end. The back platform is not used for stabling, although it is often used as a head-shunt for the yard. The path of the line, beyond its crossing of Wungan Street at its intersection with Cherry Street, extends through the bushland adjacent to the Harry Pottage Memorial Park for several hundred metres, much of which is still reasonably visible, albeit overgrown. The only remains other than the alignment are the bases of several overhead wiring poles, as well as one complete pole where the section of track retained for stabling once ended. Land formerly occupied by the Mont Park Asylum is now part of La Trobe University, and private housing developments.|$|E
