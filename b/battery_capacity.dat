5|$|The {{federal tax}} credit for new plug-in {{electric}} vehicles is worth $2,500 plus $417 for each kilowatt-hour of <b>battery</b> <b>capacity</b> over 5 kWh, and {{the portion of the}} credit determined by <b>battery</b> <b>capacity</b> cannot exceed $5,000. Therefore, the total amount of the credit allowed for a new PEV is $7,500. Several states have established incentives and tax exemptions for BEVs and PHEV, and other non-monetary incentives.|$|E
5|$|CryoSat-2 {{was built}} as a {{replacement}} for CryoSat-1, whose Rokot carrier rocket was unable to achieve orbit, resulting in the loss of the satellite. Compared to its predecessor, CryoSat-2 features software upgrades, greater <b>battery</b> <b>capacity</b> and an updated instrument package. Its main instrument is an interferometric radar range-finder with twin antennas, which measures the height difference between the upper surface of floating ice and surrounding water. This is often known as 'free-board'.|$|E
5|$|One {{reviewer}} {{criticized the}} decision to underclock the ATI Mobility Radeon X1600 graphics card by about 30percent its original speed. The notebook was also noted for running hot. Users complained that upgrading system memory was harder than in older Apple notebooks. Since the dimensions for the 15-inch MacBook Pro were tweaked slightly from the 15-inch PowerBook G4, older accessories such as notebook sleeves did not work with the new models. Some users noted a slight flickering when the screen was on lower brightness settings. Apple increased the <b>battery</b> <b>capacity</b> by 10 Wh, going from 50 in the PowerBook G4 to 60, but the more powerful Core Duo CPU required more power. Battery life therefore remained {{about the same as}} in previous models, at three-plus hours.|$|E
40|$|System {{lifetime}} {{is a major}} {{design constraint}} for attery-powered mobile embedded systems. The increasing gap between the energy demand of portable devices and their <b>battery</b> <b>capacities</b> is further limiting durability of mobile devices. Thus, the guarantees over Quality of Service (QoS) of battery-constrained devices under strict <b>battery</b> <b>capacities</b> are of primary interest for mobile embedded systems’ manufacturers and stakeholders. This paper presents a novel approach for deriving QoS of applications modelled as synchronous dataflow (SDF) graphs. We map these applications on heterogeneous multiprocessor platforms that are partitioned into Voltage and Frequency Islands, together with multiple kinetic battery models (KiBaMs). By modelling the whole system as hybrid automata, and applying model-checking, we evaluate, (1) system lifetime; and (2) minimum required initial <b>battery</b> <b>capacities</b> to achieve the desired application performance. We demonstrate that our approach shows a significant improvement in terms of scalability, as compared to a priced timed automata based KiBaM model. This approach also allows early detection of design errors via model checking...|$|R
30|$|As the {{cooperative}} willingness of selfish nodes {{is affected by}} their resource constraint, in this section, we compare the performance of proposed protocols under different <b>battery</b> <b>capacities</b> and buffer sizes.|$|R
50|$|A 10 amp-hour battery {{could take}} 15 hours {{to reach a}} fully charged state from a fully {{discharged}} condition with a 1 amp charger as it would require roughly 1.5 times the <b>battery's</b> <b>capacity.</b>|$|R
25|$|On October 3, the U.S. {{enacted the}} Energy Improvement and Extension Act of 2008. The {{legislation}} provided {{tax credits for}} the purchase of plug-in electric vehicles of <b>battery</b> <b>capacity</b> over 4 kilowatt-hours. The federal tax credits were extended and modified by the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009, but now the <b>battery</b> <b>capacity</b> must be over 5 kWh and the credit phases out after the automaker has sold at least 200,000 vehicles in the U.S.|$|E
25|$|As {{defined by}} the 2009 ACES Act, a PEV is a vehicle which draws {{propulsion}} energy from a traction battery with at least 4 kwh of capacity and uses an offboard source of energy to recharge such battery. The tax credit for new plug-in electric vehicles is worth $2,500 plus $417 for each kilowatt-hour of <b>battery</b> <b>capacity</b> over 4 kwh, and {{the portion of the}} credit determined by <b>battery</b> <b>capacity</b> cannot exceed $5,000. Therefore, the maximum amount of the credit allowed for a new PEV is $7,500. Both the Nissan Leaf electric vehicle and the Chevrolet Volt plug-in hybrid, launched in December 2010, are eligible for the maximum $7,500 tax credit. The Toyota Prius Plug-in Hybrid, released in January 2012, is eligible for a $2,500 tax credit due to its smaller <b>battery</b> <b>capacity</b> of 5.2 kWh. All Tesla cars and Chevrolet Bolts are eligible for the 7,500 tax credit.|$|E
25|$|After 38 {{minutes of}} flying various manoeuvres, <b>battery</b> <b>capacity</b> may be 25%. From the inside, the Electro {{is very similar}} to the {{gasoline-powered}} version, but from the outside, the Electro is much quieter. Electricity costs are about 1/10 of gasoline.|$|E
50|$|Charge and {{discharge}} rates are often denoted as C or C-rate, {{which is a}} measure of the rate at which a battery is charged or discharged relative to its capacity. As such the C-rate is defined as the charge or discharge current divided by the <b>battery's</b> <b>capacity</b> to store an electrical charge. While rarely stated explicitly, the unit of the C-rate is h−1, equivalent to stating the <b>battery's</b> <b>capacity</b> to store an electrical charge in unit hour times current in the same unit as the charge or discharge current. The C-rate is never negative, so whether it describes a charging or discharging process depends on the context.|$|R
50|$|Since {{the unit}} of the C-rate is {{typically}} implied, some care is required with its notation to avoid confusing it with the <b>battery's</b> <b>capacity</b> to store a charge, which in the SI has unit coulomb with unit symbol C.|$|R
50|$|Battery {{redistribution}} {{is sometimes}} distinguished from battery balancing {{by saying the}} latter stops at matching the cell's state of charge (SOC) only at one point (usually 100% SOC), so that the <b>battery's</b> <b>capacity</b> is only limited by the capacity of its weakest cell.|$|R
25|$|The R-class {{submarines}} were a {{class of}} 12 small British diesel-electric submarines built for the Royal Navy during World War I, and were forerunners of the modern attack submarine, in that they were designed specifically to attack and sink enemy submarines, their <b>battery</b> <b>capacity</b> and hull shape being optimized for underwater performance.|$|E
25|$|The {{battery and}} drive unit are covered {{for eight years}} or 125,000 miles (200,000km in metric countries) for the 60kWh base model, or eight years and {{unlimited}} distance for all 70 and 85kWh models. The unconditional battery warranty covers everything except deliberate damage, even including user error. However, loss of <b>battery</b> <b>capacity</b> over time or usage is not covered under warranty.|$|E
25|$|Germany {{enlarged}} the ocean-going type IX U-boat {{design to}} an extended range type IXD1 variant with torpedo tubes removed and <b>battery</b> <b>capacity</b> reduced to increase cargo capacity for transport of strategic materials between German and Japanese ports. After the Italian submarines were converted for this cargo role, {{most of the}} extended range design were completed as an armed type IXD2 variant.|$|E
5000|$|In {{order to}} {{maximize}} the <b>battery's</b> <b>capacity,</b> and to prevent localized under-charging or over-charging, the BMS may actively ensure that all the cells that compose the battery are kept at the same voltage or State of Charge, through balancing. The BMS can balance the cells by: ...|$|R
50|$|Apple Inc. clarifies that {{a charge}} cycle means using all the <b>battery's</b> <b>capacity,</b> but not {{necessarily}} by full charge and discharge; e.g., using half the charge of a fully charged battery, charging it, and then using {{the same amount of}} charge again count as a single charge cycle.|$|R
30|$|First, {{autonomy}} duration is chosen, {{and then}} PVG and <b>Battery</b> <b>capacities</b> are calculated using Eqs.  16 and 17. Then, k 1 and k 2 are calculated based on Eqs.  14 and 15. These values {{are applied to}} the storage model to calculate unmet load with {{the same manner as}} for GA method.|$|R
25|$|The {{pre-production}} test {{cars are}} based on a third generation Toyota Prius (model ZVW30) outfitted with 5.2 kWh lithium-ion batteries. The selected <b>battery</b> <b>capacity</b> is the minimum required for the Prius Plug-in to be eligible for the U.S. federal tax credit of , which is applicable to the first 200,000 plug-ins sold by Toyota according to the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009.|$|E
25|$|Nissan {{added more}} <b>battery</b> <b>capacity</b> which {{increased}} {{the range of}} the car on a full charge. A larger 30kWh battery is on the SL and SV trims, and the S trim initially kept the smaller 24kWh battery found in earlier Leafs. However, midway through the 2016 model year, Nissan changed the battery in the base Leaf S model from 24 kWh to 30 kWh.|$|E
25|$|<b>Battery</b> <b>capacity</b> and the {{capability}} of handling faster charging are both increasing, and methods of charging have needed to change and improve. New options have also been introduced (on a small scale, including mobile charging stations and charging via inductive charging mats). The differing needs and solutions of various manufacturers has slowed the emergence of standard charging methods, and in 2015, {{there is a strong}} recognition of the need for standardization.|$|E
50|$|In 1965 the Hawker Siddeley Group bought Lister and in 1968 the {{electrical}} equipment company Crompton Parkinson too. Soon after this, Crompton produced a battery-powered electric {{version of the}} Auto-Truck.

5000|$|A <b>battery’s</b> <b>capacity</b> {{turnover}} is {{the amount}} of possible energy throughput in relation to the <b>capacity</b> of the <b>battery.</b> It is a normalized measure of how many times the theoretical <b>capacity</b> of a <b>battery</b> can be used over its lifetime.

40|$|We {{consider}} the achievable average rates of a multiple-access system, {{which consists of}} N energy-harvesting users (EHUs) that transmit information over a block fading multiple-access channel (MAC) and a base station (BS) that broadcasts radio frequency (RF) energy to the EHUs for wireless power transfer. The information (over the uplink) and power (over the downlink) can be transmitted either in time division duplex or frequency division duplex. For the case when the EHUs <b>battery</b> <b>capacities</b> {{and the number of}} transmission slots are both infinite, we determine the optimal power allocation for the BS and the optimal rates and power allocations for the EHUs that maximize the achievable rate region of the MAC. The resulting online solution is asymptotically optimal, and also applicable for a finite number of transmission slots and finite <b>battery</b> <b>capacities.</b> Comment: 4 pages, 1 figur...|$|R
25|$|The <b>battery</b> <b>capacity</b> of a {{fully charged}} {{electric}} vehicle from electric vehicle automakers (such as Nissan) is about 20kWh, providing {{it with an}} electrical autonomy of about 100 miles. Tesla Motors initially released their Model S with battery capacities of 40kWh, 60kWh and 85kWh with the latter having an estimated range of approximately 480km; as of May 2017 they have three models, 70kWh, 90kWh and 100kWh. Plug in hybrid vehicles have capacity of roughly 3 to 5kWh, for an electrical autonomy of 20 to 40 kilometres, but the gasoline engine ensures the full autonomy of a conventional vehicle.|$|E
25|$|During World War II, {{the first}} {{submarine}} snorkels came into service. These allowed diesel submarines to operate near the surface, using their diesel engines, and {{without being seen}} by surface search radar. Designs such as the German type XXI U-boat were the first submarines designed to operate primarily submerged, rather than as submersibles that navigated {{on the surface and}} could submerge as a means to escape detection or launch an attack. After World War II, this emphasis on submerged operation, <b>battery</b> <b>capacity</b> and higher submerged speed continued. In the US, the GUPPY program rebuilt wartime submarines to emphasise this. New Soviet Union submarines, primarily of the Whiskey class, were based on the four Type XXIs that were assigned to them by the Potsdam Agreement.|$|E
25|$|Following World War II, {{advanced}} German submarines, {{especially the}} Type XXI U-boat, became {{available to the}} Allies, particularly the United States Navy and the Soviet Navy. Initially, the Type XVII U-boat, with a Walter hydrogen peroxide-fueled gas turbine allowing high sustained underwater speed, {{was thought to be}} more developed than was actually the case, and was viewed as the submarine technology of the immediate future. However, the Type XXI, streamlined and with a high <b>battery</b> <b>capacity</b> for high submerged speed, was fully developed and became the basis for most non-nuclear submarine designs worldwide through the 1950s. In the US Navy, the Greater Underwater Propulsion Power Program (GUPPY) was developed to modernize World War II submarines {{along the lines of the}} Type XXI.|$|E
40|$|The {{number of}} {{embedded}} systems is increasing and a remarkable percentage is designed as mobile applications. For the latter, the energy consumption is a limiting factor because of today's <b>battery</b> <b>capacities.</b> Besides the processor, memory accesses consume a high amount of energy.

50|$|The Militky MB-E1 was a {{modified}} HB-3 with an 8-10 kW (11-13 hp) Bosch KM77 electric motor. It {{was the first}} full-sized, manned aircraft to be solely electrically powered. Flights of 12 minutes duration at up to an altitude of 380 m were just within the Ni-Cd <b>battery's</b> <b>capacity.</b> Its first flight was on 23 October 1973.|$|R
50|$|A <b>battery's</b> <b>capacity</b> {{depends upon}} its cell {{chemistry}} and current draw. Energizer brand rates its alkaline D cell at approximately 20,000mAh at 25mA draw, but estimates performance closer to about 10,000mAh at 500mA draw. This effect is generally less pronounced in cells with NiCd and NiMH chemistries; see Peukert's law. Many commonly available size D rechargeable cells are actually sub-C cells in a D-sized holder.|$|R
25|$|PHEVs {{and fully}} {{electric}} cars may allow for more {{efficient use of}} existing electric production capacity, much of which sits idle as operating reserve most of the time. This assumes that vehicles are charged primarily during off peak periods (i.e., at night), or equipped with technology known as charge control to shut off charging during periods of peak demand. Another advantage of a plug-in vehicle is their potential ability to load balance or help the grid during peak loads. This is accomplished with vehicle-to-grid technology. By using excess <b>battery</b> <b>capacity</b> to send power back into the grid and then recharge during off peak times using cheaper power, such vehicles are actually advantageous to utilities {{as well as their}} owners. Even if such vehicles just led to an increase in the use of nighttime electricity they would even out electricity demand which is typically higher in the daytime, and provide a greater return on capital for electricity infrastructure.|$|E
500|$|The Volt's nominal usable <b>battery</b> <b>{{capacity}}</b> is [...] The Volt's {{fuel tank}} capacity is [...] Aside from charge sustaining modes of operation, the <b>battery</b> <b>capacity</b> is completely used first, and then the fuel is consumed. In {{the event that the}} car is operated until it runs out of gasoline, the gasoline-powered generator shuts down, and the Volt continues to operate, tapping into a reserve portion of the <b>battery</b> <b>capacity</b> which is below the regular minimum state-of-charge. The reserve <b>battery</b> <b>capacity</b> provides an extra [...] If this reserve <b>battery</b> <b>capacity</b> is also exhausted, the Volt slows to a stop.|$|E
500|$|According to the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) definitions, the Volt is a plug-in hybrid vehicle, {{due to the}} {{combination}} of an internal combustion engine and two electric motors, along with a battery that can accept off-board energy. The Volt operates as a purely electric vehicle for the first [...] in charge-depleting mode. When the <b>battery</b> <b>capacity</b> drops below a pre-established threshold from full charge, the vehicle enters charge-sustaining mode, and the Volt's control system will select the most optimally efficient drive mode to improve performance and boost high-speed efficiency.|$|E
50|$|Due to its {{cylindrical}} shape, high aspect-ratio, self-assembling nature, {{and ability}} to incorporate metal coatings (nickel and cobalt) into its shell, TMV is an ideal candidate to be incorporated into battery electrodes Addition of TMV to a battery electrode increases the reactive surface area by an order of magnitude, resulting {{in an increase in}} the <b>battery's</b> <b>capacity</b> by up to six times compared to a planar electrode geometry.|$|R
