5|$|Active and cheerful, the Russian Toy was {{originally}} bred <b>both</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> anti-rat dog and a watch dog. The second quality is still {{active in the}} breed, {{and they can be}} very vocal. They can become quite attached to their family, regardless of the ages of the family members. Russian Toys are usually very reserved with strangers, but very loyal to their owners, always ready to protect them from any perceived danger.|$|E
5|$|Due to its {{architectural}} {{and artistic}} value, the Church of St George {{has been part}} of the list of Bulgaria's monuments of cultural of national importance since 1927. With the reorganization of the list in the 1960s, it was included on it <b>both</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> architectural and as an artistic monument, in 1968 and 1969 respectively. Together with the native house of Dimitar Peshev and the city art gallery, since 2010 it has been listed as number 26 among the 100 Tourist Sites of Bulgaria.|$|E
5|$|HIV/AIDS {{has had a}} {{great impact}} on society, <b>both</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> illness and as a source of discrimination. The disease also has large {{economic}} impacts. There are many misconceptions about HIV/AIDS such as the belief that it can be transmitted by casual non-sexual contact. The disease has become subject to many controversies involving religion including the Catholic Church's position not to support condom use as prevention. It has attracted international medical and political attention as well as large-scale funding since it was identified in the 1980s.|$|E

5|$|Timberlake's primary {{legacy is}} the journal he kept while {{living with the}} Cherokee. The volume was {{published}} in 1765, likely following Timberlake's death in September of that year. The journal is of importance <b>both</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> ethnological study, as it contains detailed descriptions of various facets of Cherokee society, and as a historical account, as it gives insight into Cherokee political decision-making and the tribe's early reactions to the encroaching European colonists.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{agreed that}} the game's {{graphics}} were good, enjoyed Uematsu's score, and several praised the concepts behind the Job and leveling systems. Alongside this, unanimous criticism was laid against the gameplay pace, its convoluted interface, bugs and glitches, and {{the slow pace of}} the story. It was generally seen as a great disappointment <b>both</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> MMORPG and a mainline entry in the Final Fantasy series. Later, as part of an interview concerning the game's later development, 1UP.com commented that subsequent patches and overhauls had turned the game into something more playable.|$|E

5|$|I have {{a rather}} more {{favourable}} {{opinion of the}} 'Vestiges' than you appear to have. I do not consider it a hasty generalization, but rather as an ingenious hypothesis strongly supported by some striking facts and analogies, but which remains to be proven by more facts and the additional light which more research may throw upon the problem. It furnishes a subject for every student of nature to attend to; every fact he observes will make either for or against it, and it thus serves <b>both</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> incitement to the collection of facts, and an object to which they can be applied when collected.|$|E
5|$|In 1817 Heber {{accepted}} {{the post of}} canon at St Asaph, the relative proximity of which enabled the extra duties {{to be carried out}} without interfering with his parish work. His main literary task during these years was a biography and critical study of the complete works of the 17th-century cleric Jeremy Taylor; the works, with Heber's critique, were published in 15 volumes between 1820 and 1822. This period of Heber's life was saddened by the death, on 24 December 1818, of his infant daughter after a short illness. Two more daughters were born later, in 1821 and 1824 respectively; both lived to adulthood. In 1822 Heber was elected to the church office of Preacher of Lincoln's Inn, which would require a regular term of residence in London. He saw this <b>both</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> extension of his service to the Church and as a means of renewing contact with old friends.|$|E
5|$|McCoy enjoys hunting, fishing, {{and playing}} golf. He was the roommate of his {{favorite}} receiving target at Texas, Jordan Shipley, also an avid outdoorsman. McCoy's father was the roommate of Shipley's father at Abilene Christian University. Colt's younger brother Case and Jordan's younger brother Jaxon were also roommates at the University of Texas and played the same positions as Colt and Jordan. Case McCoy now resides and works in the Austin area. McCoy's grandfather, Burl McCoy, {{is a member of}} the Abilene Christian University (ACU) Sports Hall of Fame for his exploits <b>both</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> athlete and as the former women's basketball coach.

5|$|The Comet {{is widely}} {{regarded}} <b>both</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> adventurous step forward and a supreme tragedy; nevertheless, the aircraft's legacy does include numerous advances in aircraft design and in accident investigations. The inquiries into the accidents that plagued the Comet 1 were {{perhaps some of the}} most extensive and revolutionary that have ever taken place, establishing precedents in accident investigation; many of the deep-sea salvage and aircraft reconstruction techniques employed have remained in use within the aviation industry. In spite of the Comet being subjected to what was then the most rigorous testing of any contemporary airliner, pressurisation and the dynamic stresses involved were not thoroughly understood {{at the time of the}} aircraft's development, nor was the concept of metal fatigue. While these lessons could be implemented on the drawing board for future aircraft, corrections could only be retroactively applied to the Comet.|$|E
5|$|Whistler {{created the}} {{painting}} {{in the winter of}} 1861–62, though he later returned to it and made alterations. It was rejected both at the Royal Academy and at the Salon in Paris, but eventually accepted at the Salon des Refusés in 1863. This exhibition also featured Édouard Manet's famous Déjeuner sur l'herbe, and together the two works gained a lot of attention. The White Girl shows clearly the influence of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, with whom Whistler had recently come in contact. The painting has been interpreted by later art critics <b>both</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> allegory of innocence and its loss, and as a religious allusion to the Virgin Mary.|$|E

Samus has appeared in Nintendo games such as Super Mario RPG, Tetris (Nintendo Entertainment System version), Tetris DS, Galactic Pinball, Kirby Super Star, Kirby's Dream Land 3 and WarioWare. Several characters and game environments {{have appeared in the}} Super Smash Bros. series. Samus is a playable character in all four Super Smash Bros. games. Super Smash Bros.

CoSIDA has selected Academic All American teams since 1952. To be nominated, a student-athlete {{must be a}} starter or important reserve {{with at least a}} 3.30 cumulative grade point average (on a 4.0 scale) at his/her current institution. Nominated athletes must have participated in at least 50 percent of the team’s games at the position listed on the nomination form (where applicable). No student-athlete is eligible until he has completed one full calendar year at his current institution and has reached sophomore athletic eligibility. In the cases of transfers, graduate students and two-year college graduates, the student-athlete must have completed one full calendar year at the nominating institution to be eligible. Nominees in graduate school must have a cumulative GPA of 3.30 or better <b>both</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> undergrad and in grad school.
