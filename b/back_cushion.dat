50|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, the Healthy Back Store {{acquired}} three Natural Back Stores in California, bringing the chain to 8 locations. Healthy Back bought out the Maryland-based Joanne's Bed and Back chain of stores for $600,000 in 2008 following the latter's filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy earlier that year. At {{the time of}} the merger, Healthy Back's sales were $40 million per year, and Joanne's $10 million. Joanne's had played a role in Mazlish's entry into the back business, when he purchased a <b>back</b> <b>cushion</b> from the chain's Tyson's Corner location upon first moving to the District in 1993.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—A new {{flexible}} contour backrest for wheelchairs {{was designed}} with {{the objectives of}} offering adequate posture, uniform pressure distribution, and comfort to the users while keeping the advantages of conventional sling backrests, such as easy to fold, light weight, unobtrusive, and airy. The {{purpose of this study}} is to compare the new backrest with two commer-cially available wheelchair backrests, an adjustable-tension (AT) backrest and a <b>back</b> <b>cushion</b> on a rigid support (RS), in terms of pressure distribution, back profile accommodation, and short-term comfort. Evaluations were done with 15 nonim-paired subjects in a static position. It was shown that the new backrest distributes pressure in a more uniform way than the AT and in a way similar to the RS, while giving a better fit to subjects ' trunks than other backrests because of its multiple adjustments. Finally, subjects felt that the new backrest is as comfortable as the RS and more comfortable than the AT...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} 24 {{full-scale}} experiments was {{conducted during the}} summer of 2008 {{to examine the effects of}} alarm type (photoelectric, ionization, and dual sensor), alarm location, fabric type (100 % cotton and 100 % polyester), polyurethane foam density, ignition scenario, and room configuration, on smoke alarm performance. A two-level, fractional factorial design of eight experimental configurations was developed around the five factors: fabric type, foam density, fire location, ventilation, and ignition scenario. A structure, designed to represent a single-story home or apartment, was constructed inside the Large Fire Laboratory at the National Institute for Standards and Technology for the experiments. The fire source was a chair mockup consisting of a seat and <b>back</b> <b>cushion</b> of a specific cover fabric and foam density, weighing between 5. 5 kg and 8. 3 kg. It rested on a metal frame and was subjected to a small propane gas flame, or an electric cartridge heater to initiate smoldering. Each experimental configuration was conducted three times. Smoldering fires were allowed to progress until they naturally transitioned to flaming fires except for one test that was terminated early due to time constraints. Th...|$|E

40|$|Annoyance, fatigue, and {{musculoskeletal}} pain {{have been}} reported during prolonged exposures to propulsion-generated vibration in military propeller aircraft 1. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the vibration mitigation properties of selected seat cushions and the effects of occupant seating posture during exposure to higher frequency multi-axis vibration associated with military propeller aircraft. Methods A Navy E- 2 C Hawkeye crew seat was mounted onto the Six Degree-of-Freedom Motion Simulator (SIXMODE). Six seat pan cushion configurations were tested during exposure to an E- 2 C vibration signal collected in the field 1. Seat pan cushions 1 - 5 were used with the original E- 2 C seat <b>back</b> <b>cushion.</b> Cushion configuration 6 included seat pan cushion 5 with a prototype seat <b>back</b> <b>cushion.</b> Triaxial accelerometer pads were mounted onto the seat pan and seat back cushions to measure the vibration entering the human. Data were collected for seven subjects seated upright with their backs in contact with the seat (back-on) and not in contact with the seat (back-off). Spectral analysis techniques were used to analyze data at the two dominant frequencies associated with the propulsion system (propeller rotation frequency (PRF) ~ 18. 5 Hz, and blade passage frequency (BPF) ~ 73. 5 Hz). Overall accelerations were also calculated between 1 and 80 Hz. Vibration Total Values (VTVs) were calculated using the weighted seat pan and seat back (back-on only) accelerations and compared to the comfort reactions given in ISO 2631 - 1 : 19972. Results In general, the highest accelerations observed at the seat pan occurred in the fore-and-aft (X) direction at both the PRF and the BPF for all cushions and both postures. The most pronounced effect was at the BPF in the X direction, where all configurations showed significantly lower seat pan accelerations than configuration 1 (original E- 2 C cushion) with the back-on posture. Configuration 5 was the exception with the back-off posture (Fig. 1 A, Repeated Measures ANOVA, P< 0. 05). The most pronounced effect of posture occurred at the PRF in the X direction, where all cushion configurations showed significantly lower seat pan accelerations with the back-off posture (Fig. 1 B). All configurations except configuration 2 showed similar VTVs as compared to Configuration 1 (Fig. 2, P< 0. 05). Configuration 2 tended to show the lowest weighted acceleration levels. The overall VTVs (back-on only, Fig. 2 B) showed significantly higher accelerations as compared to both the back-on and back-off seat pan point VTVs (Figs. 2 A...|$|E
40|$|Air-containing fashion, {{which can}} offer diverse {{functions}} through the inflow and outflow of air, is highly relevant in today's mobile society, {{where people are}} experiencing {{a wider range of}} environments. This study attempts to suggest the possibility of air-containing multi-functional fashion that could continuously be utilized by developing a design for an air-containing jacket using modular systems. In this research, the modular systems in architecture and furniture design were referenced through {{a review of the literature}} for the purpose of establishing modular systems in fashion. Functions relevant to the mobility of today’s society are derived from the results of advanced research and applied to the design of modules of the jacket. The modules are integrated through the modular systems. The folding and unfolding structure in architecture and furniture is applied as a folding system in fashion, the vertical accumulation structure as a layering system, and the horizontal integration structure as a combining system, and in addition, the containing system has emerged in fashion. Each module is designed to fulfill certain functions, such as cushioning, heat insulation, and portability. The folding system is utilized in designing the cushion module to support the neck and back of a wearer by making its hood and hem fold in the back. The application of a layering system was suggested by making the vest, combined with the neck cushion and <b>back</b> <b>cushion</b> via the combining system, layered with its insulation module. By applying the combining system, the hoo...|$|E
