50|$|In {{addition}} to the spindle and its bearings, the headstock often contains parts to convert the motor speed into various spindle speeds. Various types of speed-changing mechanism achieve this, from a cone pulley or step pulley, to a cone pulley with <b>back</b> <b>gear</b> (which is essentially a low range, similar in net effect to the two-speed rear of a truck), to an entire gear train {{similar to that of}} a manual-shift auto transmission. Some motors have electronic rheostat-type speed controls, which obviates cone pulleys or gears.|$|E
5000|$|Roberts built a {{range of}} machine tools, some to his own design, the first being a gear-cutting machine. For {{accurately}} checking {{the dimensions of the}} gears he adapted the sector, which he developed for sale to other engineers. [...] Roberts adopted rotary cutters, which he had seen used at Maudslays. This is one of the earliest records of a milling cutter used in engineering. In 1816 he made the first reliable wet gas meter. In 1817 he made a lathe able to turn work 6 ft. This had a <b>back</b> <b>gear</b> to give an increased range of speeds, and a sliding saddle to move the tool along the work. The saddle was driven by a screw through gearing which could be disengaged when the end of the cut was reached. Also in 1817 he built a planing machine to allow the machining of flat surfaces. Previous to this flat surfaces were laboriously made by hand with the fitter using hammers and chisels, files and scrapers to get a true surface.|$|E
5000|$|Engine lathe is {{the name}} applied to a {{traditional}} late-19th-century or 20th-century lathe with automatic feed to the cutting tool, as opposed to early lathes which were used with hand-held tools, or lathes with manual feed only. The usage of [...] "engine" [...] here is in the mechanical-device sense, not the prime-mover sense, as in the steam engines which were the standard industrial power source for many years. The works would have one large steam engine which would provide power to all the machines via a line shaft system of belts. Therefore, early engine lathes were generally 'cone heads', in that the spindle usually had attached to it a multi-step pulley called a cone pulley designed to accept a flat belt. Different spindle speeds could be obtained by moving the flat belt to different steps on the cone pulley. Cone-head lathes usually had a countershaft (layshaft) {{on the back side}} of the cone which could be engaged to provide a lower set of speeds than was obtainable by direct belt drive. These <b>gears</b> were called <b>back</b> <b>gears.</b> Larger lathes sometimes had two-speed <b>back</b> <b>gears</b> which could be shifted to provide a still lower set of speeds.|$|R

40|$|For machine {{components}} like gears and bearings, working life calculation {{is one of}} the complex issues to deal with. This is because the mechanics of their operation is dependent on many parameters, like loading, friction and lubrication etc. Also the influence of these parameters on the component failure modes cannot be perfectly idealized. But in this regard, standards like AGMA (American Gear Manufacturers Association); ISO (International Standard Organization) and BS (British Standards) are quite useful on the basis of which theoretical working life for {{machine components}} under a specific failure mode can be predicted. In this paper with linear pitting failure mode assumptions, theoretical working life calculation has been made for a helical gear. BS-ISO 6336 - 2 standard is used for the gear theoretical life calculations. Furthermore, a wear debris analysis based experiment has been performed for the validation of theoretical calculation. A back to <b>back</b> <b>gear</b> testing rig has been used for the experimental validation. The experimental results show that the theoretical life calculation {{made on the basis of}} BS-ISO 6336 - 2 standards is fairly accurate...|$|E
40|$|This {{project work}} {{focused on the}} design and testing of gearbox for fault detection. Gearboxes are very {{important}} things in many industries applications. Thus the interest for their health monitoring is growing and effective diagnostic techniques and methodologies are the objective of previous studies. Here {{we are going to}} detect different types of fault which occurs in gearbox. There are mainly three types of fault occurs. These faults are slightly worn, medium worn, broken teeth. With the help of vibration study (due to gears fault) through oscilloscope we can design such kind of system which can detect what kind of fault a gearbox has. A multistage faulty gearbox is used in the present study. The test setup comprises of a multistage gearbox, driven by an induction motor and loaded by a generator or by a brake motor. The gearbox is an automotive transmission gearbox with five gears including <b>back</b> <b>gear,</b> such as 1 st, 2 nd, 3 rd, 4 th and back gears, under synchrony-meshed condition. Here each gear will be tested under the constant load and constant speed (RPM) conditions. ...|$|E
50|$|The press style used is {{in direct}} {{correlation}} {{to the end}} product. Press types are straightside, BG (<b>back</b> <b>geared),</b> geared, gap, OBI (open back inclinable) and OBS (open back stationary). Hydraulic and mechanical presses are classified by the frame the moving elements are mounted on. The most common are the gap-frame, also known as C-frame, and the straightside press. A straightside press has vertical columns {{on either side of}} the machine and eliminates angular deflection. A C-frame allows easy access to the die area on three sides and require less floor space. A type of gap-frame, the OBI pivots the frame for easier scrap or part discharge. The OBS timed air blasts, devices or conveyor for scrap or part discharge.|$|R

50|$|For 1923 {{with the}} OE engine the {{straight}} cut <b>back</b> axle <b>gear</b> {{was replaced by}} a spiral bevel with a higher 3.3:1 reduction ratio. The chassis and wheelbase were lengthened four inches and the chassis was also strengthened by widening the cross-section of the side rails. The body was widened three inches. Rear axle torque was now taken through a banjo-shaped torque arm alongside the propellor shaft.|$|R
500|$|While {{the game}} has been praised for the {{addition}} of a deeper plot than the original Gears of War and being highly polished, reviewers noted that the multiplayer experience did not resemble the previous game especially in its quick pace and enjoyability. IGN noted that while the first four acts of the game were satisfying, in the final act [...] "the last boss is a complete joke and the ending feels just a tad too abrupt," [...] and that there were some bugs and lag in the online multiplayer. Overall, IGN stated that [...] " [...] has its flaws {{when it comes to the}} technical side of multiplayer and the last act of the campaign and the voice acting might turn some off. Still, none of that comes close to holding <b>back</b> <b>Gears</b> of War 2 from its destiny: being one of the best games available on the Xbox 360." [...] Also, even though the new plot was praised, critics such as Official Xbox Magazine scrutinized the game's middle acts saying that most of the plot [...] "falls flat." ...|$|R

50|$|Early {{immigrants}} to the New World brought with them the technology of windmills from Europe. On US farms, particularly on the Great Plains, wind pumps were used to pump water from farm wells for cattle. In California and some other states, the windmill {{was part of a}} self-contained domestic water system, including a hand-dug well and a redwood water tower supporting a redwood tank and enclosed by redwood siding (tankhouse). The self-regulating farm wind pump was invented by Daniel Halladay in 1854. Eventually, steel blades and steel towers replaced wooden construction, and at their peak in 1930, an estimated 600,000 units were in use, with capacity equivalent to 150 megawatts. Very large lighter wind pumps in Australia directly crank the pump with the rotor of the windmill. Extra <b>back</b> <b>gearing</b> between small rotors for high wind areas and the pump crank prevents trying to push the pump rods down on the downstroke faster than they can fall by gravity. Otherwise pumping too fast leads to the pump rods buckling, making the seal of the stuffing box leak and wearing through the wall of the rising main (UK) or the drop-pipe (US) so all output is lost.|$|R

On some of the little concussions when I got smashed I had nausea, felt like spewing, I was light-headed and you do lose your sense of balance, all of that, it all comes with it. As soon as I’d got into the next tackle my body would just click <b>back</b> into <b>gear,</b> sort of like driving a manual car. Im sure there is after-effects. But I loved every minute of it.

50|$|On 10 November 1928, {{a regular}} locomotive-hauled {{passenger}} train replaced the railcar, {{but this was}} not the end of its life. It was assigned to run various services in Otago and Southland for a number of years, but after eleven total years of operation, it was withdrawn. Railcar technology was improving (the Vulcan railcars were ordered not long after the Clayton retired) and there was little need or economic justification for an older, somewhat unreliable steam-powered railcar that was not suitable for the rugged terrain that typified many lines in New Zealand. It was withdrawn and did not survive to be preserved. Its sandbox was appropriated for use as a <b>back</b> sand <b>gear</b> on AB 810.|$|R
50|$|The {{cars have}} a bump shift for easier gear shifting: the driver bumps the shifter forward {{to go up}} a <b>gear,</b> and <b>back</b> to go <b>back</b> a <b>gear.</b> In order to reverse, the driver twists {{the top of the}} shifter and bumps it {{forwards}} or backwards. The emergency brake automatically releases when the driver lets go. The show cars are lightweight, at 1322 lb, and are rear-wheel drive to allow the cars to drift. The drivers wear heavy protective suits; to keep the drivers cool, a cooling system {{in the rear of the}} car pumps water through the suits. The show also features jet skis on the small canal at the front of the theater, and motorcycles which maneuver around the cars.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{raises some}} {{specific}} issues concerning {{the choice of}} exchange rate regime in transition countries during the run-up to EU/EMU membership. It argues {{that there is no}} "one-size-fits-all" exchange rate regime that accession countries should uniformly adopt. It also argues that the Maastricht criterion on inflation is inconsistent with the catching-up process because of the Balassa-Samuelson effect and that this inconsistency will encourage a "weighing-in" syndrome: like the boxer who refrains from eating for hours prior to the weigh-in only to consume a big meal once the weigh-in is over, the candidate country will maintain very tight monetary policy and resort to all sorts of techniques (freezing of administered prices, lowering of consumption taxes, etc.) to squeeze down inflation prior to accession only to shift <b>back</b> <b>gears</b> after it has joined the EMU. Indeed, the convergence of short-term interest rates to EMU levels that will come with accession will automatically mean a loosening of monetary policy after the country has {{become a member of the}} monetary union. That loosening will be reinforced if the country had previously allowed its exchange rate to appreciate against the euro. The result of this stop-go cycle is that the efficiency of economic management will suffer. It would be better to recognize the principle of the Balassa-Samuelson effect explicitly in the Maastricht criteria by giving more room for maneuver than the one provided by the present rule. The paper makes suggestions on how the Maastricht criterion on inflation could be adjusted and discusses their merits. It concludes that a reasonable compromise would be to define the permissible inflation deviation in reference to the average inflation rate of the euro zone, not the three EU members with the lowest inflation rate. ...|$|R

25|$|Tulsa {{played their}} second {{straight}} Wednesday game on October 21, {{traveling to the}} Sun Bowl {{to take on a}} team they had defeated in a 77–35 shootout the previous season. This time, the Miners were better prepared, building up a 13-0 lead in the first quarter. However, the momentum appeared to shift in the second after Tulsa got on the board with a 19-yard run from A.J. Whitmore and two long UTEP drives were ended by interceptions. The Golden Hurricane continued to roll after halftime, scoring 17 straight to take an 11-point lead. Tulsa appeared set to cruise to another easy win, but the tide of the game turned again {{in the middle of the}} fourth quarter when UTEP finally got their offense <b>back</b> in <b>gear</b> and cut the deficit to 3 with a touchdown and two-point conversion.

With two home games next, United was able to secure a draw against the Union, despite an early goal by former D.C. United regular Brian Carroll. United scored the tying goal on an own goal that came on a free kick taken by Branko Bošković, but Bošković was ejected 20 minutes later because of a scrum after De Rosario had {{seemingly}} earned the win for United with penalty kick goal in the 87th minute.
