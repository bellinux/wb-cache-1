5000|$|The first MythBusters episode {{involving}} {{the company was}} “busting” the myth that a duck's quack will not echo.

After that, he may continue to hit himself to chance if he can get higher points, or <b>bust.</b> <b>This</b> feature gives a perception of 'another lifeline' as the dealer with a bad card like 16 or 17 points can eliminate players with 3 or 4 cards on the likelihood that they have busted, before attempting another attempt to beat players with 2 cards which are likely to be good cards (18 to 21).|$|E

50|$|Austrian {{economics}} {{argue that}} the crisis {{is consistent with the}} Austrian Business Cycle Theory, in which credit created through the policies of central banking gives rise to an artificial boom, which is inevitably followed by a <b>bust.</b> <b>This</b> perspective argues that the monetary policy of central banks creates excessive quantities of cheap credit by setting interest rates below where they would be set by a free market. This easy availability of credit inspires a bundle of malinvestments, particularly on long term projects such as housing and capital assets, and also spurs a consumption boom as incentives to save are diminished. Thus an unsustainable boom arises, characterized by malinvestments and overconsumption.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} prudential {{controls on}} capital flows to emerging markets {{from the perspective}} of a Pigouvian tax that addresses externalities associated with the deleveraging cycle. It presents a model in which restricting capital inflows during boom times reduces the potential outflows during <b>busts.</b> <b>This</b> mitigates the feedback effects of deleveraging episodes, when tightening financial constraints on borrowers and collapsing prices for collateral assets have mutually reinforcing effects. In our model, capital controls reduce macroeconomic volatility and increase standard measures of consumer welfare. ...|$|R

50|$|The {{hourglass}} {{is one of}} four female body shapes. The other shapes are the rectangular, inverted triangle, and spoon. The hourglass {{shape is}} defined as a woman whose body measurements, the circumference of the bust, waist, and hips, are a wide bust, a narrow waist, and a wide hip that has similar measurements to that of the <b>bust.</b> <b>This</b> body shape is aptly named for its resemblance to that of an hourglass where the upper and lower half are wide while the portion at middle is narrow in circumference making the ratio wide-narrow-wide. Women who exhibit the hour glass figure are proven to be more admired which puts pressure on other women who are less attractive to strive to achieve the hour glass figure. This in return leads to body dissatisfaction which can cause eating disorders in young women from all over the globe.|$|E

30|$|Recently, convincing {{evidence}} has been presented that the recession {{in the wake of}} the recent financial crisis resulted primarily from an overly levered housing sector that was forced to deleverage and cut consumption spending when faced with collapsing housing prices. Following this interpretation it is argued that, as opposed to the consensus view on monetary policy in the vicinity of the ZLB, optimal monetary policy may involve an interest rate increase if the ZLB threatens to become a binding constraint in the aftermath of an asset price <b>bust.</b> <b>This</b> result delivers arguments to advocate a— in the previous literature less favored— pre-emptive tightening policy in an asset price boom.|$|E
40|$|The Financial Crisis and the Great Recession that {{followed}} illustrate {{the sensitivity of}} the economy to a housing <b>bust.</b> <b>This</b> paper shows that financial integration both amplified the volatility of housing prices and economic sensitivity to housing-price shocks. We exploit variation credit-supply subsidies across local markets from the Government-Sponsored Enterprises to construct an instrument for housing price changes unrelated to fundamentals. Using this instrument, we find that a 1 % rise in housing prices causes a 0. 25 % increase in economic growth. This effect is larger in localities more financially integrated with other markets through bank ownership ties. Financial integration thus raised the effect of collateral shocks on the economy, thereby increasing economic volatility...|$|E

It focuses on five OECD countries : the United States, Ireland, Finland, the Netherlands because they are leading ICT countries, and France as a national reference. For {{a better understanding of how}} each country has been performing since the Internet bubble burst, we first describe the importance of the ICT sector in these countries through a set of variables underlining the role of ICT in each economy. We then describe the timing and the nature of the downturn, insisting more on the United States because of its leading role. The ICT sector has been strongly hit and is still restructuring. But its growth potential is also still high. ...|$|E

40|$|This work {{discusses}} the {{boom and bust}} dynamics which are a common feature of a large range of different industries. especially but not only new born ones. The common managerial behavior underpinning such dynamics is aggressive capacity expansion in the boom period ultimately yielding excess capacity turning the boom into <b>bust.</b> <b>This</b> paper examines the underlying cognitive and behavioral factors responsible for strategic decisions driving boom and busts, nested in the interaction between cognitive biases and capacity adjustment delay, and together tries to identify some tentative heuristics which tend to mitigate them. At the same time, we shall conjecturally conclude, {{there might be a}} positive collective side to boom and bust behavio r fostering accumulation of knowledge and physical infrastructure, especially regarding new technological paradigms.

40|$|Africa has not {{suffered}} a chronic failure of growth. African {{growth has been}} recurring. This paper reviews some growth spurts to substantiate that claim. The proximate cause of low income in Africa is the sequence of boom and <b>bust.</b> <b>This</b> significantly reorients the central research question—away from {{a search for the}} root causes of African underdevelopment and towards explaining causes and effects of growth and decline. The growth spurts are approached as local responses to a global demand for African produced commodities. It is argued that these supply responses involved more than a reallocation of land and labour; they entailed investment and institutional change. It is precisely because these periods of rapid economic change and accumulation caused important social and organizational changes that they cannot be ignored, as they have tended to be in the search for a root cause of chronic failure...|$|E

While the policy debate on {{how to respond to}} boom-bust credit cycles remains unsettled, it has been conjectured that credit subsidies may provide a particularly effective policy tool to counter a credit <b>bust.</b> <b>This</b> paper reports on a rare policy experiment where credit subsidies were used to buffer the impact of the global financial crisis on Serbia in 2009. Model simulations suggest that credit subsidies in Serbia helped to mitigate the slump in output.
