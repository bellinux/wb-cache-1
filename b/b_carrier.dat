5000|$|Backhaul {{is needed}} to connect the small cells to the core network, {{internet}} and other services. For in-building use, existing broadband internet can be used. In urban outdoors, mobile operators consider this more challenging than macrocell backhaul because a) small cells are typically in hard-to-reach, near-street-level locations rather than in more open, above-rooftop locations and <b>b)</b> <b>carrier</b> grade connectivity must be provided at much lower cost per bit. In one survey, 55% of operators listed backhaul {{as one of their}} biggest challenge for small cell rollout. Many different wireless and wired technologies have been proposed as solutions, and it is agreed that a ‘toolbox’ of these will be needed to address a range of deployment scenarios. An industry consensus view of how the different solution characteristics match with requirements is published by the Small Cell Forum. [...] The backhaul solution is influenced by a number of factors, including the operator’s original motivation to deploy small cells, which could be for targeted capacity, indoor or outdoor coverage.|$|E

Method: Between the periods of 1 st JAN 2004 to 31 th DEC 2008, newborns from Hepatitis <b>B</b> <b>carrier</b> mother followed up by Fong Son Tong (CSSL) health centre in Macau {{were selected for}} study. There were a total of 108 newborns but only 78 newborns meet the criteria for enrollment. Hepatitis <b>B</b> <b>carrier</b> status was defined as patient who has Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) during blood test. All eligible subjects received both HBIG and 1 st dose of HBV during birth, followed by 2 nd and 3 rd dose of HBV vaccine at first and six month of age. Blood test for HBsAg and Hepatitis B surface antigen antibody (Anti-HBs) were performed after 6 months of age to check for Hepatitis B infection and antibody level for Hepatitis B surface antigen. Results: All 78 babies studied were negative for HBsAg, 70 out of 78 babies developed adequate immune protection (as defined by antibodies level more than 10 mIU/ml) from Hepatitis B virus after 3 doses of HBV. Conclusion: Active and passive immunization with HBV and HBIG for newborn of Hepatitis <b>B</b> <b>carrier</b> mother is highly effective in preventing vertical transmission of Hepatitis B virus. No subject was infected during the study period. After a single course of 3 doses HBV, about 89. 7 % of babies developed adequate protection against Hepatitis B virus.

40|$|Hepatocellular {{carcinoma}} (HCC) killed 1286 {{people in}} 1996 in Hong Kong. It {{is the second}} most common cancer death for men and the fourth for women. Over 90 % of HCC occur after the age of 40 and 84 % are in chronic hepatitis <b>B</b> <b>carriers.</b> The only cure for HCC is surgical resection when it is small. This article applies current evidence to our local epidemiological data to estimate the cost-effectiveness of different HCC screening programmes for hepatitis <b>B</b> <b>carriers</b> aged 40 to 69. The estimated number of persons needed to screen (NNT) for 30 years is 16 for men and 44 for women and the cost is HK$ 1. 30 million for men and HK$ 3. 56 million for women per life saved by four-monthly ultrasonography and serum alpha foetal protein (α-FP) screening. The cost per life saved is lower for the less intensive screening programmes but some potentially preventable HCC deaths may be missed. HCC screening for chronic hepatitis <b>B</b> <b>carriers</b> is more cost-effective than mammogram screening and is comparable to cervical cancer screening. Screening for HCC satisfies nearly all the principles for screening, but its effectiveness and feasibility have to be proven by further clinical trials. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectivesThe {{objective}} of this cross-sectional {{study was to determine}} seroprevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen and related risk factors among new recruits in a military unit in Turkey. MethodsEight thousand five hundred eighty-nine newly-recruited soldiers were enrolled in the study. Blood samples were drawn from them between January 2006 and December 2006 and ELISA technique was applied to the samples. In addition, questions on the risk factors of hepatitis B exposure were asked to the participants in the survey. ResultsThe results demonstrated that HBsAg seroprevalence was 2. 8 %. Further survey results indicated that seropositivity increased depending on certain risk factors. In multiple regression analysis, significant correlations were determined between HBsAg positivity and certain risk factors such as living in the Southeast Anatolia region (p< 0. 01), having a history of living with a hepatitis <b>B</b> <b>carrier</b> (p< 0. 001), and presence of a hepatitis <b>B</b> <b>carrier</b> in the neighborhood or at work (p< 0. 05).

40|$|We {{previously}} {{determined that}} a linear co-polymer of histidine and lysine (HK) in combination with liposomes enhanced the transfection efficiency of cationic liposomes. In the current study, we designed a series of HK polymers with increased branching and/or histidine/lysine ratio to determine if either variable affects transfection efficiency. In the presence of liposomes, the branched polymer with {{the highest number of}} histidines, HHK 4 b, was the most effective at enhancing gene expression. Furthermore, when serum was added to the medium during transfection, the combination of HHK 4 b and liposomes as a gene-delivery vehicle increased luciferase expression 400 -fold compared to liposomes alone. In contrast to linear HK polymers, the higher branched HHK polymers were effective carriers of plasmids in the absence of liposomes. Without liposomes, the HHK 4 <b>b</b> <b>carrier</b> enhanced luciferase expression 15 -fold in comparison with the lesser branched HHK 2 <b>b</b> <b>carrier</b> and increased expression by 5 -logs in comparison with the HHK or HK carrier. The interplay of several parameters including increased condensation of DNA, buffering of acidic endosomes and differential binding affinities of polymer with DNA have a role in the enhancement of transfection by the HK polymers. In addition to suggesting that branched HK polymers are promising gene-delivery vehicles, this study provides a framework for the development of more efficient peptide-bond-based polymers of histidine and lysine...|$|E
40|$|Earlier work (Oster, 2005) has argued, {{based on}} {{existing}} medical literature {{and analysis of}} cross country data and vaccination programs, that parents who are carriers of hepatitis B have a higher offspring sex ratio (more boys) than non-carrier parents. Further, since a number of Asian countries, China in particular, have high hepatitis <b>B</b> <b>carrier</b> rates, Oster(2005) suggested that hepatitis B could explain a large share – approximately 50 % – of Asia’s “missing women”. Subsequent work has questioned this conclusion. Most notably, Lin and Luoh (2008) use data from a large cohort of births in Taiwan and find only a very tiny effect of maternal hepatitis carrier status on offspring sex ratio. Although this work is quite conclusive for the case of mothers, it leaves {{open the possibility that}} paternal carrier status is driving higher sex offspring sex ratios. To test this, we collected data on the offspring gender for a cohort of 67, 000 people in China who are being observed in a prospective cohort study of liver cancer; approximately 15 % of these individuals are hepatitis B carriers. In this sample, we find no effect of either maternal or paternal hepatitis <b>B</b> <b>carrier</b> status on offspring sex. Carrier parents are no more likely to have male children than non-carrier parents. This finding leads us to conclude that hepatitis B cannot explain skewed sex ratios in China. ...|$|E
