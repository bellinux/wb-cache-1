6000|$|So to Florence we went. My first {{idea was}} to travel by the <b>Brenner</b> <b>route</b> through the Tyrol; but a queer little episode which met us at the outset on the Austrian {{frontier}} put a check to this plan. We cycled to the border, sending our trunks on by rail. When we went to claim them at the Austrian Custom-house, we were told they were detained 'for political reasons.' ...|$|E
5000|$|The Tuxer Joch is a {{mountain}} {{pass in the}} Zillertal Alps at a height of [...] that links the lower Zillertal valley with the <b>Brenner</b> <b>route</b> {{just north of the}} Brenner Pass. To the northeast just below the summit lies the Tuxer Joch-Haus.|$|E
50|$|The Franciscan Friary, Bolzano (Franziskanerkloster, Bozen; Convento dei Francescani, Bolzano) is a Franciscan friary in {{the city}} of Bolzano, in South Tyrol, {{northern}} Italy. It was founded in 1221, less than a century after Bolzano was refounded as a trading centre on the important <b>Brenner</b> <b>route</b> connecting the March of Verona and Italy with the Holy Roman Empire north of The Alps.|$|E
2500|$|Free {{movement}} of goods within the European Union is achieved by a customs union, and the principle of non-discrimination. The EU manages imports from non-member states, duties between member states are prohibited, and imports circulate freely. In addition under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union article 34, 'Quantitative restrictions on imports and all measures having equivalent effect shall be prohibited between Member States'. In Procureur du Roi v Dassonville the Court of Justice held that this rule meant all [...] "trading rules" [...] that are [...] "enacted by Member States" [...] which could hinder trade [...] "directly or indirectly, actually or potentially" [...] would be caught by article 34. This meant that a Belgian law requiring Scotch whisky imports to have a certificate of origin was unlikely to be lawful. It discriminated against parallel importers like Mr Dassonville, who could not get certificates from authorities in France, where they bought the Scotch. This [...] "wide test", to determine what could potentially be an unlawful restriction on trade, applies equally to actions by quasi-government bodies, such as the former [...] "Buy Irish" [...] company that had government appointees. It also means states can be responsible for private actors. For instance, in Commission v France French farmer vigilantes were continually sabotaging shipments of Spanish strawberries, and even Belgian tomato imports. France was liable for these hindrances to trade because the authorities 'manifestly and persistently abstained' from preventing the sabotage. Generally speaking, if a member state has laws or practices that directly discriminate against imports (or exports under TFEU article 35) then it must be justified under article 36. The justifications include public morality, policy or security, [...] "protection of health and life of humans, animals or plants", [...] "national treasures" [...] of [...] "artistic, historic or archaeological value" [...] and [...] "industrial and commercial property." [...] In addition, although not clearly listed, environmental protection can justify restrictions on trade as an overriding requirement derived from TFEU article 11. More generally, it has been increasingly acknowledged that fundamental human rights should take priority over all trade rules. So, in Schmidberger v Austria the Court of Justice held that Austria did not infringe article 34 by failing to ban a protest that blocked heavy traffic passing over the A13, <b>Brenner</b> Autobahn, en <b>route</b> to Italy. Although many companies, including Mr Schmidberger's German undertaking, were prevented from trading, the Court of Justice reasoned that freedom of association {{is one of the}} 'fundamental pillars of a democratic society', against which the free {{movement of}} goods had to be balanced, and was probably subordinate. If a member state does appeal to the article 36 justification, the measures it takes have to be applied proportionately. This means the rule must be pursue a legitimate aim and (1) be suitable to achieve the aim, (2) be necessary, so that a less restrictive measure could not achieve the same result, and (3) be reasonable in balancing the interests of free trade with interests in article 36.|$|R
50|$|In early {{times there}} was a busy bridle path over the Tuxer Joch from the <b>Brenner</b> <b>route</b> into the Zillertal valley. As early as prehistoric times the saddle was known to humans. Finds of tools made of hornstein and south Alpine flints {{indicate}} that the Tuxer Joch was crossed by Stone Age peoples. A decorative pin from the Bronze Age was found at the pass. Farmers drove their cattle over the saddle, and farmers and traders also crossed the pass bearing local products. Occasionally funeral processions also passed this way, because the village of Tux once belonged to the parish of Schmirn {{on the other side}} of the saddle, so the dead had to be carried there. Later this parochial structure was changed, but the secular administrative arrangement was not altered until 1926. But the Tuxer Tal had long been oriented towards the Zillertal and when it was subsequently linked by a road in the 19th century, the Tuxer Joch lost its importance for local traffic and has since acted merely as a transit path for walkers.|$|E
50|$|In the 1830s Emperor Francis I of Austria {{wanted to}} build a {{defensive}} system on the strategic important <b>Brenner</b> <b>route,</b> for fear of an invasion from the south; the village was settled for strategic purposes; it is well protected by the surrounding mountainous and can block the entrance to the Eisack valley. Work began on June 17, 1833, and the Franzensfeste Fortress was inaugurated by Franz' successor Emperor Ferdinand I of Austria on August 18, 1838. The construction of the fortress and later of the Brenner railway, helped thousands of workers who found accommodation in Franzensfeste contributing to the development and growth of the village.In 1867 {{with the opening of the}} Brenner railway line, Franzensfeste consolidated its role as a transport hub not only on the north-south direction, but also with the eastern branch-off into the Puster Valley, to Carinthia and the Austrian Southern Railway line at Maribor in Styria, opened in 1871. The Franzensfeste Fortress, however, lost its strategic importance with the signing of the Triple Alliance military agreement by Germany, Austria-Hungary and the Kingdom of Italy in 1882. The fortifications were transformed into a military ammunition depot, which kept even when was transferred to Italy according to the 1919 Treaty of Saint-Germain.|$|E
50|$|The Mont Cenis was the {{upgrading}} and successor of the French Rapide Le Transalpin running since 1954 between Lyon and Milan on {{the same}} route. In 1957 the TEE network was split in a northern and southern part. Centre of the southern part was Milan and it was planned to have four TEE services from and to Milan. However the Italian ALn 442-448 trains weren't available {{in time for the}} launch of the TEE network on 2 June 1957, and consequently, the Mont Cenis, operated with French RGP-825, was the only one entering service on time. The RGP-825 was replaced by the Italian ALn 442-448 diesel multiple units on 29 May 1960, so the entire southern part of the TEE network was operated by Ferrovie dello Stato. This replacement wasn't an improvement at all because the ALn 442-448 trains could hardly cope, as seen before on the <b>Brenner</b> <b>route</b> (TEE Mediolanum), with the slopes in mountainous aerea's, and the average speed dropped from 85 km/h to 75 km/h. In 1966 Le Catalan was introduced on the Geneva - Portbou relation and {{in order to create a}} timed connection at the crossing point Chamb√©ry the schedule of the westbound Mont Cenis was put forward half an hour, thus creating a first-class link between Milan and Spain.|$|E
40|$|In {{a report}} {{completed}} in late 1997, the EU Commission {{found that the}} measures of the Transit Agreement were an effective means to reduce the environmental burden caused by truck transit through Austria. Yet {{in spite of the}} ceiling set on overall transit rates, truck traffic on the <b>Brenner</b> <b>route</b> continued to grow.
