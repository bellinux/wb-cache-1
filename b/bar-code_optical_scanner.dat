40|$|Optical {{scanning}} {{is one of}} {{the emerging}} evaluation tools used for obtaining dose distributions in gel dosimetry. A radiation field analyzer adapted into an <b>optical</b> CT <b>scanner</b> to evaluate an irradiated Fricke gel has been already reported by others. This prototype <b>optical</b> CT <b>scanner</b> functions like a first generation x-ray CT scanner in the translate-rotate fashion. A similar scanner was constructed in our department for optical scanning of irradiated FX gel. At first, an aquarium was constructed and fitted into the water phantom of the RFA with provision to place the gel phantom to be scanned along with a light source and detector. The movements of the RFA were utilized to scan the gel phantom. A scan of a cuvette filled with colored solution was carried out and the resulting images were reconstructed and profiles obtained to evaluate the working of the <b>optical</b> <b>scanner.</b> A scan of the gel phantom was then obtained to evaluate the performance of the scanner. Thus a radiation field analyzer (DYNASCAN) was successfully adapted to an <b>optical</b> <b>scanner</b> to evaluate Fricke gels in our department...|$|R
