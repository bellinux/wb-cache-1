5|$|Pair {{formation}} in the <b>black-necked</b> <b>grebe</b> usually starts during pauses in the migration to the breeding grounds, although it occasionally occurs before, in wintering pairs. This pair formation continues after this grebe has arrived to its breeding grounds. Courtship occurs when it arrives at the breeding lake. The displays are performed {{in the middle of}} the lake. There is no territory involved in courting; individuals used the whole area of the lake. When advertising for a mate, a <b>black-necked</b> <b>grebe</b> will approach other black-necked grebes with its body fluffed out and its neck erect. It closes its beak to perform a call, poo-eee-chk, with the last note only barely audible. Courtship generally stops at the start of nesting.|$|E
5|$|The <b>black-necked</b> <b>grebe</b> is {{socially}} monogamous. Conspecific or intraspecific brood parasitism, where the female lays {{eggs in the}} nest of others of their own species is common with nearly 40% of nests being parasitized on average. In terms of territory, this grebe will only defend its nest site.|$|E
5|$|The <b>black-necked</b> <b>grebe</b> forages {{mainly by}} diving from the water, with dives usually lasting less than 30 seconds. These dives are usually shorter in time when in more shallow water. In between dives, this grebe rests {{for an average}} of 15 seconds. It also forages by {{gleaning}} foliage, plucking objects off of the surface of water, having its head submerged while swimming, and sometimes capturing flying insects.|$|E
5|$|The <b>black-necked</b> <b>grebe</b> uses {{multiple}} foraging techniques. Insects, {{which make}} {{up the majority of}} this bird's diet, are caught either {{on the surface of the}} water or when they are in flight. It occasionally practices foliage gleaning. This grebe dives to catch crustaceans, molluscs, tadpoles, and small frogs and fish. When moulting at saline lakes, this bird feeds mostly on brine shrimp. The <b>black-necked</b> <b>grebe</b> makes a floating cup nest on an open lake. The nest cup is covered with a disc. This nest is located both in colonies and by itself. During the breeding season, which varies depending on location, this species will lay one (sometimes two) clutch of three to four eggs. The number of eggs is sometimes larger due to conspecific brood parasitism. After a 21-day incubation period, the eggs hatch, and then the nest is deserted. After about 10 days, the parents split up the chicks between themselves. After this, the chicks become independent in about 10 days, and fledge in about three weeks.|$|E
5|$|When {{breeding}} is over, the <b>black-necked</b> <b>grebe</b> usually partakes in a moult {{migration to}} saline lakes. It especially prefers lakes {{with large numbers}} of invertebrate prey, so that it can fatten up while moulting and before going on its winter migration. Some birds, although, moult when on the breeding grounds, but most do not moult {{until the end of the}} moult migration. This migration is dangerous, with hundreds and sometimes thousands of birds being killed by snowstorms when traveling to places such as Mono Lake.|$|E
5|$|As of 2016, the <b>black-necked</b> <b>grebe</b> is {{classified}} as least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The trend {{of the population is}} uncertain, as some populations are decreasing, whereas others are stable, have an uncertain trend, or are increasing. The justification for the current classification of this species is its very large population (estimated around 3.9–4.2 million individuals) combined with a large estimated extent of occurrence (about 155 million km2 (60 million sq mi)). This grebe is probably the most numerous grebe in the world.|$|E
5|$|This {{species was}} first {{described}} by Carl Ludwig Hablitz in 1783 as Colymbus caspicus, from {{a bird in}} Bandar-e Anzali. This was originally {{thought to be a}} synonym for the horned grebe, until Erwin Stresemann discovered that the description applied more to the <b>black-necked</b> <b>grebe</b> in 1948. Before this, the earliest description was thought to be by Christian Ludwig Brehm in 1831, who gave this bird its current scientific name of Podiceps nigricollis from a German bird. To resolve this, the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature suppressed the name C. caspicus. The genus name Dytes is sometimes used for this species, a placement which was formalized by Robert Ridgway in 1881.|$|E
5|$|When {{disturbed}} while incubating, {{this bird}} usually (just under 50% of the time) partly covers its eggs with nest material when the disruption is not sudden, but a bird with an incomplete clutch usually does {{not attempt to}} cover the eggs. When the disruption is sudden, on the other hand, the <b>black-necked</b> <b>grebe</b> usually (just under 50% of the time) does not cover its eggs. In comparison, other species of grebes cover up their eggs when leaving the nest. Predation is usually not {{the primary cause of}} egg loss, with most nesting failures occurring after the chicks have hatched. A major cause of this is the chilling of the young.|$|E
5|$|The <b>black-necked</b> <b>grebe</b> (Podiceps nigricollis), {{known in}} North America as the eared grebe, {{is a member}} of the grebe family of water birds. It was {{described}} in 1831 by Christian Ludwig Brehm. There are currently three accepted subspecies, including the nominate subspecies. Its breeding plumage features a distinctive ochre-coloured plumage that extends behind its eye and over its ear coverts. The rest of the upper parts, including the head, neck, and breast, are coloured black to blackish brown. The flanks are tawny rufous to maroon-chestnut, and the abdomen is white. When in its non-breeding plumage, this bird has greyish-black upper parts, including the top of the head and a vertical stripe on the back of the neck. The flanks are also greyish-black. The rest of the body is a white or whitish colour. The juvenile has more brown in its darker areas. The subspecies californicus can be distinguished from the nominate by the former's usually longer bill. The other subspecies, P. n. gurneyi, can be differentiated by its greyer head and upper parts and by its smaller size. P. n. gurneyi can also be told apart by its lack of a non-breeding plumage. This species is present in parts of Africa, Eurasia, and the Americas.|$|E
25|$|The {{valley of}} the Charente {{upstream}} from Angoulême is a Natura 2000 zone with remarkable species: 64 species of birds. Among them are species for marshland and wetland; and at Angoulême {{it is common to}} see diving and swimming birds, swans (mute swan), grebes (<b>black-necked</b> <b>grebe,</b> little grebe, horned grebe, great crested grebe), geese (greylag goose), ducks (gadwall, pintail, wigeon, shoveler), teal (garganey, teal) and scaup (pochard, tufted duck) on the Charente. It is more rare to see waders. Terns, gulls (laughing gull), great cormorants, return during periods of storms from far upstream on the river.|$|E
500|$|When breeding, the <b>black-necked</b> <b>grebe</b> gives a quiet [...] "ooeek" [...] that ascends {{in pitch}} from an already high pitch. This call {{is also used}} as a {{territorial}} call, {{in addition to a}} low and fast trill, which itself is also used during courtship. Another call is a short [...] "puuii" [...] or [...] "wit". This grebe is silent when it is not the breeding season and when it is feeding or resting.|$|E
500|$|The {{juvenile}} <b>black-necked</b> <b>grebe</b> {{is similar}} to the non-breeding adult. There are differences, however, including the fact that the dark areas are usually more brownish in the juvenile, with less black. The [...] are often tinged pale grey, with whitish marks behind the eye. On the sides of the head and upper neck, there is a buffy or tawny tinge. The chick is downy and has a blackish-grey head with stripes and spots that are white or pale buff-grey. The throat and foreneck are largely pale. The upper parts are mostly dark grey in colour, and the abdomen is white.|$|E
500|$|Although it {{generally}} avoids flight, the <b>black-necked</b> <b>grebe</b> travels {{as far as}} [...] during migration. In addition, it becomes flightless for two months after completing a migration to reach an area where it can safely moult. During this moult, the grebe can double in weight. The migrations to reach these areas are dangerous, sometimes with thousands of grebe deaths. In spite of this, it is classified as a least concern species by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN). It is likely {{that this is the}} most numerous grebe in the world. There are potential threats to it, such as oil spills, but these are not likely to present a major risk to the overall population.|$|E
500|$|The <b>black-necked</b> <b>grebe</b> usually {{measures}} between [...] {{in length}} and weighs [...] The nominate subspecies in breeding plumage has the head, neck, breast, and upper parts coloured black to blackish brown, {{with the exception of}} the ochre-coloured fan of feathers extending behind the eye over the eye-coverts and sides of the nape.

The [...] is blackish to drab brown in colour and has a white patch formed by the secondaries and part of the inner primaries. The flanks are coloured tawny rufous to maroon-chestnut and have the occasional blackish fleck. The [...] and abdomen is white, with an exception to the former being the dark tertials and the mostly pale grey-brown outer primaries. The legs are a dark greenish grey. The sexes are similar.|$|E
500|$|The {{peregrine}} falcon hunts most often {{at dawn and}} dusk, when prey are most active, but also nocturnally in cities, particularly during migration periods when hunting at night may become prevalent. Nocturnal migrants taken by peregrines include species as diverse as yellow-billed cuckoo, <b>black-necked</b> <b>grebe,</b> virginia rail, and common quail. The peregrine requires open space in order to hunt, and therefore often hunts over open water, marshes, valleys, fields, and tundra, searching for prey either from a high perch or from the air. Large congregations of migrants, especially species that gather in the open like shorebirds, can be quite attractive to hunting peregrines. Once prey is spotted, it begins its stoop, folding back the tail and wings, with feet tucked. Prey is typically struck and captured in mid-air; the {{peregrine falcon}} strikes its prey with a clenched foot, stunning or killing it with the impact, then turns to catch it in mid-air. If its prey is too heavy to carry, a peregrine will drop {{it to the ground}} and eat it there. If they miss the initial strike, peregrines will chase their prey in a twisting flight. Although previously thought rare, several cases of peregrines contour-hunting, i.e. using natural contours to surprise and ambush prey on the ground, have been reported and even rare cases of prey being pursued on foot. In addition, peregrines have been documented preying on chicks in nests, from birds such as kittiwakes. Prey is plucked before consumption. [...] A recent study showed the presence of peregrines benefits non-preferred species {{while at the same time}} causing a decline in its preferred prey.|$|E
2500|$|Further up-river, the Sutton and Lound gravel pits {{are still}} part of an active {{quarrying}} operation which {{is run by the}} construction group Tarmac, but some 316 hectares have been designated as an SSSI. They provide an important wetland habitat for a large variety of birds. The pits won the 2008 [...] "British Trust for Ornithology - British Energy Business Bird Challenge" [...] in the category for quarries over 100 ha. A total of 172 different species of birds were recorded, including a number of birds which normally occupy the coastal fringes rather than inland sites. These include ringed plover, little ringed plover, shelduck and oystercatchers. Other birds seen include the <b>black-necked</b> <b>grebe,</b> which is rare in the United Kingdom, and the nightingale, which was extinct in Nottinghamshire before 2004. The Nottinghamshire Wildlife Trust have been active in planting reeds to improve the habitat, which are grown at Langford Quarry in a joint venture between Tarmac and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds.|$|E
