5|$|As {{discussed}} above, any non-pseudoforest graph contains as a subgraph a handcuff, {{figure 8}}, or theta graph; any handcuff or figure 8 graph may be contracted {{to form a}} butterfly graph (five-vertex figure 8), and any theta graph may be contracted to form a diamond graph (four-vertex theta graph), so any non-pseudoforest contains either a butterfly or a diamond as a minor, {{and these are the}} only minor-minimal non-pseudoforest graphs. Thus, a graph is a pseudoforest if and only if it does not have the butterfly or the diamond as a minor. If one forbids only the diamond <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> butterfly, the resulting larger graph family consists of the cactus graphs and disjoint unions of multiple cactus graphs.|$|E
