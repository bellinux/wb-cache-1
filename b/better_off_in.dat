500|$|De Ruyter also {{disagreed}} that [...] "detached" [...] {{schools were}} {{the only means of}} inculcating capacity for autonomy, and argued for [...] "autonomy enhancing education" [...] over [...] "autonomy imposing education". In her criticism, de Ruyter wrote that Levinson lacked critical distance from her idea of a [...] "detached" [...] school, which were presented in [...] "utopian character", with no concrete examples of such a school in existence, and as inexplicably immune from [...] "capitalist-dominated education". She added that [...] "detachment" [...] was vague in definition, that more important was detachment from absolutist or divisive stances of [...] "the good life", and that curriculum and school management were better correlative factors towards liberal schools. De Ruyter concluded that [...] "autonomy imposing schools" [...] would be more harmful than respectful and [...] "autonomy-friendly ... reduced plural environments", as a child would be <b>better</b> <b>off</b> <b>in</b> an imperfect pluralist than a homogenous fundamentalist classroom.

500|$|Douglas Jackson Brooks (born June 19, 1956), known professionally as Doug Stone, is an American {{country music}} singer. He debuted in 1990 {{with the single}} [...] "I'd Be <b>Better</b> <b>Off</b> (<b>In</b> a Pine Box)", the first release from his 1990 self-titled debut album for Epic Records. Both this album and its successor, 1991's I Thought It Was You, earned a {{platinum}} certification from the Recording Industry Association of America. Two more albums for Epic, 1992's From the Heart and 1994's More Love, are each certified gold. Stone moved to Columbia Records to record Faith in Me, Faith in You, which did not produce a Top Ten among its three singles. After suffering {{a heart attack and}} stroke in the late 1990s, he exited the label and did not release another album until Make Up in Love in 1999 on Atlantic Records. The Long Way was released in 2002 on the Audium label (now part of E1 Music), followed by two albums on the independent Lofton Creek Records.|$|E

Mac McAnally, Mark O'Connor, Paul Franklin, Brent Rowan, and Willie Weeks were among the session musicians on it. Contributing songwriters included David Lee Murphy, Larry Boone, Randy Boudreaux, A.L. [...] "Doodle" [...] Owens, and Keith Palmer, who would later chart two singles for Epic in 1991.

In addition, the single {{was nominated for a}} Grammy Award for Best Country Song, and the album was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for U.S. shipments of one million copies. The album's next two singles were both Top Ten singles as well: [...] "Fourteen Minutes Old" [...] at No.6 and [...] "These Lips Don't Know How to Say Goodbye" [...] at No.5.

2500|$|The {{political}} left {{is often}} associated with support for trade unionism. However, some groups and individuals have taken a less positive view.

2500|$|He also {{announced}} {{a far more}} radical series of reforms intended to simplify the benefits and tax credits scheme into a single payment {{to be known as}} Universal Credit. A major aim of welfare reform was to ensure that low earners would always be <b>better</b> <b>off</b> <b>in</b> employment. [...] "After years of piecemeal reform the current welfare system is complex and unfair," [...] said Duncan Smith, citing examples of people under the existing system that would see very little incremental income from increasing their working hours due to withdrawal of other benefits. Outlining the scheme in more detail in November 2010, Duncan Smith promised [...] "targeted work activity for those who need {{to get used to the}} habits of work" [...] and sanctions, including the possible removal of benefits for up to three years for those who refused to work. He said welfare reform would benefit all those who [...] "play by the rules" [...] and ensure [...] "work always pays more" [...] by easing the rate at which benefits are withdrawn as income rises.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the end of}} May, Andrea {{had decided}} that his uncle would be <b>better</b> <b>off</b> <b>in</b> the Italian climate, and three outside {{physicians}} were called in for their opinions. Their report concluded with the advice that he leave for Italy without delay. [...] But, as Andrea began to make plans for his uncle's journey to and upkeep in Bergamo, he was forced by the Paris Prefect of Police to have his uncle undergo another examination by other physicians appointed by the Prefect. Their conclusion was the opposite of that of the previous doctors: [...] "we are {{of the opinion that}} the trip should be forbidden formally as offering very real dangers and being far from allowing hope of any useful result." [...] With that, the Prefect informed Andrea that Donizetti could not be moved from Ivry. Andrea saw little use in remaining in Paris. [...] He sought a final opinion from the three doctors practicing at the clinic, and on 30 August, they provided a lengthy report outlining step-by-step the complete physical condition of their declining patient, concluding that the rigours of travel—the jolting of the carriage, for example—could bring on new symptoms or complications impossible to treat on such a journey. Andrea left for Bergamo on 7 (or 8) September 1846 taking with him a partial score of Le duc d'Albe, the completed score of Rita, and a variety of personal effects, including jewelry.|$|E
2500|$|In [...] November {{he opened}} at 1632, 2nd Avenue West, Fairview, in Vancouver, a hostel called the Swadesh Sewak [...] (‘Servant of the Motherland’) [...] : in {{addition}} to a night school of [...] Shashida type, to teach English and Mathematics, the building was used for the office and the press of the a monthly paper of the same name [...] that he published in Gurumukhi, broadly reflecting the objectives of [...] Free Hindustan edited by Taraknath Das. [...] "Its tone generally became more and more objectionable, and as it was addressed principally to the Sikhs in the Indian Army in their own language, and was being sent out to India in considerable numbers (…) Its importation into India was prohibited in March 1911, under the Sea Customs Act." [...] (Ker, pp230–231). With a new immigration law passed on 9 May 1910, when the condition of Indians in British Columbia further deteriorated, Kumar as the Secretary of the local Hindustani Association wrote, on 28 June, to the Prime Minister of Canada to protest against the unfair move. Availing of Tarak’s return to Vancouver in September, they utilised the temper of the Indians to organise among them a revolutionary movement. (Bose, p53). [...] These grievances were to bring about much trouble in the future years. For example, reports of two meetings held at Vancouver on 24 April and at Victoria on 15 May 1910, Kumar in the May issue of his paper discussed: (1) The law creates an unfair distinction between the European and the Indian subjects of the British Government. (2) Indians are subjected to an additional disgrace in that even Japanese are admitted more readily than they are. (3) Only Indians who have come direct from an Indian port are admitted: two examples of the working of this rule are given. (4) As there is no direct route from India to Canada, the above rule operates to prevent immigration altogether. (5) Other countries, e.g., the United States, have laws to prohibit the immigration of Chinese and other labourers; but Canada prohibits even the immigration of Indian merchants and students {{as in the case of}} Jogesh Chandra Misra who was sent out by a Kolkata association as a student, was prevented from landing, and is now studying at Seattle University. (6) Even the members of the families of Indians owning land in Canada have to show 200 dollars each on landing. (7) The present law is a restriction on the liberty of the subject. (8) Other British subjects get a vote after six months’ residence, but Indians do not. No doubt such anti-Indian distinctions exist in America, Germany or Japan; the result of the Canadian law is that Indians have to admit with regret that they are <b>better</b> <b>off</b> <b>in</b> foreign countries than in British territory. (Ker, pp231–232). The paper came to an end in 1911. In spite of a considerably moderate [...] tone than that of the Free Hindustan, Kumar as much as Das raised the presumption of sedition, as confirmed by the discovery early in 1911 that [...] they distributed, among other harmful publications, [...] the Bande Mataram published by Madame Cama and the Talvar by Virendranath Chattopadhyay from Paris. They drew the attention of Sikhs in America and India to the [...] "vulgar effusions" [...] of certain Canadian papers on the immigration question.|$|E
