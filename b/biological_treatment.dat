5|$|Biogas, or {{landfill}} gas, is a biofuel produced {{through the}} intermediary stage of anaerobic digestion consisting mainly of 45–90% biologically produced methane and carbon dioxide. In early 2007 a thermophilic anaerobic digestion facility was commissioned in Stornoway in the Western Isles. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) and the Renewable Energy Association are also {{leading the way}} towards {{the establishment of a}} digestate standard to facilitate the use of solid outputs from digesters on land. Anaerobic digestion and mechanical <b>biological</b> <b>treatment</b> facilities have been planned at a number of other locations in Scotland, such as Westray.|$|E
25|$|A {{mechanical}} <b>biological</b> <b>treatment</b> (MBT) {{system is}} a type of waste processing facility that combines a sorting facility with a form of <b>biological</b> <b>treatment</b> such as composting or anaerobic digestion. MBT plants are designed to process mixed household waste as well as commercial and industrial wastes.|$|E
25|$|For {{many types}} of reuse {{applications}} wastewater must pass through numerous sewage treatment process steps {{before it can be}} used.

25|$|In {{addition}} to waste reduction and recycling strategies, {{there are various}} alternatives to landfills, including waste-to-energy incineration, anaerobic digestion, composting, mechanical <b>biological</b> <b>treatment,</b> pyrolysis and plasma arc gasification. Depending on local economics and incentives, these can be made more financially attractive than landfills.|$|E
25|$|Alternative {{technologies}} are available or in development such as mechanical <b>biological</b> <b>treatment,</b> anaerobic digestion (MBT/AD), autoclaving or mechanical heat treatment (MHT) using steam or plasma arc gasification (PGP), which is incineration using electrically produced extreme high temperatures, or combinations of these treatments.|$|E
25|$|Countries {{including}} Germany, Austria, Sweden, Denmark, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Switzerland, {{have banned}} {{the disposal of}} untreated waste in landfills.

30|$|<b>Biological</b> <b>treatments</b> {{methods have}} {{traditionally}} been used {{for the management of}} pharmaceutical wastewaters. They are subdivided into aerobic and anaerobic processes which include the use of activated sludge, membrane batch reactor, sequence batch reactor, anaerobic sludge reactors, anaerobic film reactors and anaerobic filters. The wastewater characteristics {{play a key role in}} the selection of <b>biological</b> <b>treatments.</b> However, hydraulic retention time (HRT), temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), organic load, microbial community, presence of toxic and recalcitrant substances and the batch operation of the pharmaceutical production are the few variables that require modifications for adaptation to pharmaceutical wastewater to enhance the efficiency of the biodegradability and mineralization capability of biological processes.|$|R

Agricultural wastewater may be treated in agricultural wastewater treatment processes, whereas industrial wastewater is treated in industrial wastewater treatment processes.|$|E
40|$|The mode {{of action}} of {{bacterial}} silage feed additives was proposed by McDonald (1981) who concluded that silages are characterized by having low pH values, usually between 3. 7 and 4. 2, and containing high concentration of lactic acid. Noton (1982) confirmed that anaerobic bacteria fermentation converts sugary compounds in the material into lactic acid inhibiting normal aerobic bacterial action. If air is {{kept out of the}} silage, it is preserved efficiently and stably. As a result of agriculture practices, million tons of agriculture are produced as a secondary or by-products; however, with low nutritive values. Many methods are applied to improve the nutritive value and increase its utilization in ruminant’s nutrition. The <b>biological</b> <b>treatments</b> are the most common with more safe-treated products. In most cases, the <b>biological</b> <b>treatments</b> are paralleled with decreased crude fiber and fiber fractions content with increased crude protein content.

40|$|A {{greenhouse}} {{experiment was}} conducted at Agricultural Biotechnology Research Institute, Central Region of Iran to evaluate the effects of some plant growth promoting bacteria and fungi inoculation on growth and minituber yield of potato cultivars. The experiment was arranged as a factorial based on a completely randomized design with ten replications. Three potatoes (Solanum tuberosum L.) genotypes (Agria, Marfona and Aranda) were treated by eleven <b>biological</b> <b>treatments</b> including bacillus, azotobacter, pseudomonas, glomus, combination of bacillus + glomus, pseudomonas + glomus, azotobacter + glomus, azotobacter + bacillus, azotobacter + pseudomonas, azotobacter + bacillus + glomus, and azotobacter + pseudomonas + glomus during vegetative stage. Analysis of variance {{results indicated that the}} effects of <b>biological</b> <b>treatments</b> on number of minituber, yield, and total dry weight of minituber were significant at 1 % probability level. But there was not any significant difference in terms of size and weight of each minituber. The interaction of <b>biological</b> <b>treatments</b> and genotypes was also significant for yield and total dry weight of minituber. The highest tuber yield and total dry weight were observed for the Aranda genotype treated with azotobacter + pseudomonas + glomus. Moreover, the results revealed that azotobacter + glomus and azotobacter had the highest plant height and number of lateral shoot, respectively, as compared to other treatments...|$|R
25|$|Some home sewage {{treatment}} systems use <b>biological</b> <b>treatment,</b> usually beds {{of plants and}} aquaria, that absorb nutrients and bacteria and convert greywater and sewage to clear water. This odor- and color-free reclaimed water {{can be used to}} flush toilets and water outside plants. When tested, it approaches standards for potable water. In climates that freeze, the plants and aquaria need to be kept in a small greenhouse space. Good systems need about as much care as a large aquarium.|$|E
25|$|In towns, {{wastewater}} collection provides about 70% of {{the water}} supply. Although towns have <b>biological</b> <b>treatment</b> equipment, as much as 50% of such equipment is rated as ineffective. The major sources of toxic waste in the water supply are the mercury mining combine at Haidarkan; the antimony mine at Kadamzai; the Kadzyi Sai uranium mine, which ceased extraction in 1967 but which continues to leach toxic materials into nearby Ysyk Köl; the Kara-Balta Uranium Recovery Plant; the Min Kush deposit of mine tailings; and the Kyrgyz Mining and Metallurgy Plant at Orlovka.|$|E
25|$|The {{level of}} {{contamination}} of the feedstock material is a key consideration. If the feedstock to the digesters has significant levels of physical contaminants, such as plastic, glass, or metals, then processing to remove the contaminants will be required for the material to be used. If it is not removed, then the digesters can be blocked and will not function efficiently. It is with this understanding that mechanical <b>biological</b> <b>treatment</b> plants are designed. The higher the level of pretreatment a feedstock requires, the more processing machinery will be required, and, hence, the project will have higher capital costs.|$|E

25|$|Effluent {{from the}} {{pulp and paper}} {{industry}} is generally high in suspended solids and BOD. Plants that bleach wood pulp for paper making may generate chloroform, dioxins (including 2,3,7,8-TCDD), furans, phenols and chemical oxygen demand (COD). Stand-alone paper mills using imported pulp may only require simple primary treatment, such as sedimentation or dissolved air flotation. Increased BOD or COD loadings, as well as organic pollutants, may require <b>biological</b> <b>treatment</b> such as activated sludge or upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactors. For mills with high inorganic loadings like salt, tertiary treatments may be required, either general membrane treatments like ultrafiltration or reverse osmosis or treatments to remove specific contaminants, such as nutrients.|$|E
25|$|Pollutants and {{contaminants}} can {{be removed}} from ground water by applying various techniques thereby making it safe for use. Ground water treatment (or remediation) techniques span biological, chemical, and physical treatment technologies. Most ground water treatment techniques utilize a combination of technologies. Some of the <b>biological</b> <b>treatment</b> techniques include bioaugmentation, bioventing, biosparging, bioslurping, and phytoremediation. Some chemical treatment techniques include ozone and oxygen gas injection, chemical precipitation, membrane separation, ion exchange, carbon absorption, aqueous chemical oxidation, and surfactant enhanced recovery.

25|$|Ash ponds, a type {{of surface}} impoundment, are a widely used {{treatment}} technology at coal-fired plants. These ponds use gravity to settle out large particulates (measured as total suspended solids) from power plant wastewater. This technology does not treat dissolved pollutants. Power stations use additional technologies to control pollutants, depending on the particular wastestream in the plant. These include dry ash handling, closed-loop ash recycling, chemical precipitation, <b>biological</b> <b>treatment</b> (such as an activated sludge process), membrane systems, and evaporation-crystallization systems. Technological advancements in ion exchange membranes and electrodialysis systems has enabled high efficiency treatment of flue-gas desulfurization wastewater to meet recent EPA discharge limits.
