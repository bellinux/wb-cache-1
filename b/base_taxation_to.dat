40|$|Australian {{metropolitan}} {{strategic plans}} seek {{to ensure a}} balanced approach {{to the development of}} new residential areas with infrastructure facilities provided as housing construction progresses. Critical questions relate to the setting of infrastructure standards; what levels of provision are appropriate; how should shared infrastructure be costed and who should pay? A shift away from infrastructure funding <b>based</b> on general <b>taxation</b> <b>to</b> user pays approaches, raises questions about social and intergenerational equity. Using a multidisciplinary perspective we report on case study evidence from new housing developments to illustrate the variety of experience. We seek to identify trends such as the increasing movement towards the use of community titling and identify best practice taking economic legal and planning aspects into account. We aim to reach conclusions on strategic questions of policy in respect of provision of infrastructure for future urban development in Australian cities.

40|$|In this paper, {{an outline}} of the {{consequences}} of the increased use of ICT on international corporate taxation, namely on the tax attributes and the scope of taxation, is given. It is argued that the concept of capital export neutrality shall prevail, as it is deemed to be the most appropriate to the changed economic structure. With regard to the tax attributes in the source state, an enlargement of the notion of a permanent establishment in order to shift tax revenues to the source state is not recommendable. Concerning the tax attributes in the residence state, it is shown in how far problems might arise and which alternatives might constitute a solution. As regards the scope of taxation, we recommend that international corporate <b>taxation</b> shall be <b>based</b> on <b>taxation</b> according <b>to</b> the residence principle.

40|$|The {{harmonization}} {{of accounting}} among {{the member states}} of the EU {{has been going on}} since the late 1960 s. In 2001 it was decided that all listed groups within the EU should use the accounting standards IAS/IFRS issued by the International Accounting Standards Board in their consolidated accounts from 2005. All countries are also free to allow use of IAS/IFRS in individual accounts as well if they want to, which would be a step towards further harmonization. The use of these standards imply a changed way of accounting, adapted to provide relevant information to the capital market instead of the traditional continental European use of the prudence concept of conservatism to protect creditors. The use of these new standards creates problems in relation to the Swedish connection between accounting and taxation which implies that the financial accounting is the <b>base</b> for <b>taxation.</b> <b>To</b> continue to use this connection while introducing IAS/IFRS in individual accounts would have effects on the tax base as there will be a risk of distribution of untaxed profits and having to pay tax on unrealized profits. Therefore the purpose of this thesis is to investigate how the most practical connection between accounting and taxation in Sweden should be formulated within the near future in relation to the use of IAS/IFRS and the development of accounting harmonization within the EU. To gain relevant data to be able to fulfill our purpose we have chosen a qualitative method. We have conducted four semi-structured interviews with five interviewees knowledgeable in accounting and taxation. The data retrieved through the interviews have been analyzed by the use of data reduction in matrixes. Our overall conclusion is that the connection between accounting and <b>taxation</b> needs <b>to</b> be changed. The most likely and suitable solution in the near future would be to keep the connection where the accounting is used as a <b>base</b> for <b>taxation</b> and remove the connection where tax rules affects the accounting. We advocate a use of IAS/IFRS in individual accounts for larger companies and that potentially arising issues due to the kept connection will be solved with specific tax rules. We do not deem complete disengagement with development of a new tax rule system to be a usable solution at the moment. Furthermore, we cannot see any signs of accounting harmonization among SME:s within the near future...|$|R

40|$|In 2001, the European Commission {{endorsed}} a future company tax strategy {{that would allow}} EU companies the option of calculating their EU profits on a common consolidated tax base and allow Member States to tax their share of that base at national rates. Implementing this strategy requires developing a formula to distribute the common tax base across the Member States. Although EU Member States currently do not use formulary methods to distribute a common consolidate tax base across national boundaries, Canada and the United States have extensive experience using formulary methods to distribute income across sub-national boundaries. Thus, the European Union can turn to North America to gain valuable insights into {{the design of a}} formulary apportionment system with common <b>base</b> <b>taxation.</b> This paper evaluates key issues that may arise when implementing common consolidated <b>base</b> <b>taxation</b> with formulary apportionment in the EU. These issues include the formula design, the definition of the company group and the definition and scope of the tax base. The paper also discusses potential economic consequences that may arise and suggests a potential apportionment system for the European Union.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{efficiency}} impacts of two methods of consolidated <b>base</b> <b>taxation</b> with formula allocation under {{consideration in the}} European Union. The first method, common (consolidated) <b>base</b> <b>taxation</b> (CCBT), would allow companies to choose a single tax base for their EU-wide operations. This tax base would be common throughout the participating member states. The second method, Home State taxation (HST), would also allow companies to choose a single tax base for their EU-wide operations. But, unlike with CCBT, the tax base would be defined {{according to the rules}} in the company's residence, or "home," state. Thus, several different tax bases would exist within the EU. Both methods would use a common formula to distribute profits across countries. This paper finds that since countries continue to set corporate income tax rates, economic inefficiencies continue to exist under both methods. However, under HST, since the tax base differs according to residence, additional inefficiencies may arise depending on whether countries reduced their tax rates to combat the incentive for companies to relocate to locations with narrow tax bases...|$|R
