25|$|The cell {{suspension}} is entrained {{in the center}} of a narrow, rapidly flowing stream of liquid. The flow is arranged so that there is a large separation between cells relative to their diameter. A vibrating mechanism causes the stream of cells to break into individual droplets. The system is adjusted so that there is a low probability of more than one cell per droplet. Just <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>stream</b> breaks into droplets, the flow passes through a fluorescence measuring station where the fluorescent character of each cell of interest is measured. An electrical charging ring is placed just at the point where the stream breaks into droplets. A charge is placed on the ring based immediately prior to fluorescence intensity being measured, and the opposite charge is trapped on the droplet as it breaks from the stream. The charged droplets then fall through an electrostatic deflection system that diverts droplets into containers based upon their charge. In some systems, the charge is applied directly to the stream, and the droplet breaking off retains charge of the same sign as the stream. The stream is then returned to neutral after the droplet breaks off.|$|E

60|$|Then he {{knew what}} this curious premonition of coming {{happiness}} had meant, and his heart leaped like a boy's, whilst the colour burned in his cheeks. She was coming home, coming back to him, the days of her exile were over--the days of her exile and his probation. He snatched at a time-table with trembling fingers, called for his servant, ordered a hansom. He forgot his play, and did not even {{send a message to}} the theatre. A galloping hansom, with the prospect of a half-sovereign fare, seemed to him to crawl to Charing Cross like a snail across a window-pane. He caught the train--had he missed it he would have ordered out a special--and even the express rushing seawards with mails and a full load of Continental passengers seemed like a stage-coach. He paced up and down the narrow corridor till the steward looked at him curiously, and people began to regard him with suspicion as a possible criminal. He made himself a nuisance to the ticket-inspector, and when they waited for ten minutes outside the harbour station he dragged out his watch every few moments, and made scathing comments upon the railway company and every one connected with it. Nevertheless, he found himself in ample time to smoke a dozen spasmodic cigarettes <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>stream</b> of passengers from the boat at last crossed the gangway--and amongst them Emily de Reuss.|$|E
6000|$|But he {{must go to}} Plumstead {{before he}} could go to Allington. He was engaged to spend his Christmas there, and must go now at once. There was not time for the journey to Allington before he was due at Plumstead. And, moreover, though he could not bring himself to resolve that he would tell his father {{what he was going to}} do;--"It would seem as though I were asking his leave!" [...] he said to himself;--he thought that he would make a clean breast of it to his mother. It made him sad to think that he should cut the rope which {{fastened}} his own boat among the other boats in the home harbour at Plumstead, and that he should go out all alone into strange waters,--turned adrift altogether, as it were, from the Grantly fleet. If he could only get the promise of his mother's sympathy for Grace it would be something. He understood,--no one better than he,--the tendency of all his family to an uprising in the world, which tendency was almost as strong in his mother as in his father. And he had been by no means without a similar ambition himself, though with him the ambition had been only fitful, not enduring. He had a brother, a clergyman, a busy, stirring, eloquent London preacher, who got churches built, and was heard of far and wide as a rising man, who had married a certain Lady Anne, the daughter of an earl, and who was already mentioned as a candidate for high places. How his sister was the wife of a marquis, and a leader in the fashionable world, the reader already knows. The archdeacon himself was a rich man, so powerful that he could afford to look down upon a bishop; and Mrs. Grantly, though there was left about her something of an old softness of nature, a touch of the former life which had been hers <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>stream</b> of her days had run gold, yet she, too, had taken kindly to wealth and high standing, and was by no means one of those who construe literally that passage of scripture which tells us of the camel and the needle's eye. Our Henry Grantly, our major, knew himself to be his mother's favourite child,--knew himself to have become so since something of coolness had grown up between her and her august daughter. The augustness of the daughter had done much to reproduce the old freshness of which I have spoken in the mother's heart, and had specially endeared to her the son who, of all her children, was the least subject to the family failing. The clergyman, Charles Grantly,--he who had married the Lady Anne,--was his father's darling in these days. The old archdeacon would go up to London and be quite happy in his son's house. He met there the men whom he loved to meet, and heard the talk which he loved to hear. It was very fine, having the Marquis of Hartletop for his son-in-law, but he had never cared to be much at Lady Hartletop's house. Indeed, the archdeacon cared to be in no house in which those around him were supposed to be bigger than himself. Such was the little family fleet from out of which Henry Grantly was now proposing to sail alone with his little boat,--taking Grace Crawley with him at the helm. [...] "My father is a just man at the bottom," [...] he said to himself, [...] "and though he may not forgive me, he will not punish Edith." ...|$|E
30|$|Based {{on the law}} of Horton (1945), <b>the</b> total <b>stream</b> lengths have {{an inverse}} {{relation}} with <b>stream</b> order. <b>The</b> law proposed that the total length decreases as <b>stream</b> order increases. <b>The</b> analysis of cumulative stream lengths helps to know the drainage characteristics and movements of the water at different basins (Altaf et al. 2013). Furthermore, <b>the</b> analysis of <b>stream</b> length of individual stream order helps to estimate the amount of discharges traveling to downstream. Higher stream orders (3 rd and 4 th) are passing through {{the heart of the city}} carrying large volume of water collected from the upper catchment and made the risk of flooding very high and challenging to handle.
