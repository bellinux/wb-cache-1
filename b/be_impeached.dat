5|$|Once elected for a four-year-term, Federal Councillors {{can neither}} be voted {{out of office}} by a motion of no {{confidence}} nor can they <b>be</b> <b>impeached.</b> Re-election is possible for an indefinite number of terms.

In practice, therefore, Councillors serve until they decide to resign and retire to private life, usually after three to five terms of office.|$|E

25|$|Great-grandson Archibald Cox {{served as}} a U.S. Solicitor General and special {{prosecutor}} during President Richard Nixon's Watergate scandal, whereas Evarts defended a U.S. President (Andrew Johnson) in his impeachment trial.

An impeachment trial was not held in Nixon's case: Nixon resigned before the House of Representatives acted on the House Judiciary Committee's recommendation that Nixon <b>be</b> <b>impeached.</b>|$|E
