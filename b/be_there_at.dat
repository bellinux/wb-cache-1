5|$|Evans was {{the only}} member of the Apple entourage to be invited to attend (and be a witness) when McCartney and Linda Eastman were married at Marylebone Registry Office on 12 March 1969. Evans wrote in his diary that he was due to <b>be</b> <b>there</b> <b>at</b> 9.45am, but McCartney's brother, Michael's train from Birmingham was late. Peter Brown and Evans passed the {{register}} office at 9.15, and saw that there were only a few photographers and ardent fans standing in the rain, but when they left, after the wedding at 11.30am, they were mobbed by a crowd of about 1,000 people. When the Beatles played on the roof of Apple's offices in Savile Row, Evans was told to delay the policemen (who had arrived to stop the concert), as long as was possible.|$|E
25|$|Glamorgan batted {{first at}} Cardiff, coming out finally at 2.30pm as rain delayed the start. Matthew Elliott was then {{dismissed}} first ball. However, Mark Wallace performed better, adding 86 from 107 balls to still <b>be</b> <b>there</b> <b>at</b> {{the close of}} play. Surrey probably had {{the best of the}} day, which ended with the Dragons on 238 for 9. However, {{it could have been a}} lot worse for Glamorgan, as David Hemp was dropped three times. Mohammad Akram got good rewards for his bowling, taking four wickets.|$|E
500|$|San Jose and the South Bay {{area had}} a bustling scene {{featuring}} the Chocolate Watchband, the Count Five, and the Syndicate of Sound. [...] The Chocolate Watchband released several singles in 1967, including [...] "Are You Gonna <b>Be</b> <b>There</b> (<b>at</b> the Love In)", {{which was also}} featured on their debut album No Way Out. [...] The album's opening cut was a rendition of [...] "Let's Talk About Girls", previously recorded by the Tongues of Truth (aka the Grodes).|$|E

500|$|Nolan {{shoots the}} {{entirety}} of his films with one unit, rather than using a second unit for action sequences. In that way, Nolan keeps his personality and {{point of view in}} every aspect of the film. [...] "If I don't need to be directing the shots that go in the movie, why do I need to <b>be</b> <b>there</b> <b>at</b> all? The screen is the same size for every shot... Many action films embrace a second unit taking on all of the action. For me, that's odd because then {{why did you want to}} do an action film?" [...] A famously secretive filmmaker, Nolan is also known for his tight security on scripts, even going as far as telling the actors of The Dark Knight Rises the ending of the film verbally to avoid any leaks and also keeping the Interstellar plot secret from his composer Hans Zimmer.|$|E
500|$|After {{everyone}} {{finds out}} about Martha's situation, {{they try to}} stop her working in the club. Kate Ritchie who plays on-screen friend Sally Fletcher discussed how Martha would not take any advice from those closest to her and how Sally and Alf {{have to pick up}} the pieces for her in the end. She compared Martha's pole dancing to many real life experiences ordinary people go through. Sally's interference made Martha's situation worse, of this Ritche added: [...] "It's been hard for Sally to realise and Alf as well, just that you just have to stand back and let it run its course and <b>be</b> <b>there</b> <b>at</b> the end." [...] Of Martha's downward spiral and pushing her friends away, Gordon stated: [...] "Now she's found herself in this hole, she ruined all these relationships with her family, her friends, Jack, everyone's trying to help her and she's really against everyone, she's in a really bad place at the moment".|$|E
500|$|Meredith won {{his first}} cap for Wales in a 2–2 draw with Ireland on 16 March 1895 in Belfast. He won 12 caps in the 1890s, but was forced to miss six games as his club would not let him play in games that clashed with league fixtures. Wales could compete with Ireland, but were {{regularly}} beaten by Scotland and England. On 26 March 1900, Wales played {{for the first time}} in South Wales, at Cardiff Arms Park, and Meredith scored a goal to earn the Welsh a celebrated 1–1 draw with England. After serving his suspension, he returned to Wales for the British Home Championship title victory in 1907, the nation's first success in the competition. In those three games, he scored against Ireland in a 3–2 victory, and captained Wales to a 1–0 win over Scotland and a 1–1 draw with England. Wales were denied a late penalty against the English, and Meredith was later recorded to have said [...] "never mind, little Wales will win some day [...] May I <b>be</b> <b>there</b> <b>at</b> the death." ...|$|E

Thevar supported this reform, saying, [...] "I would <b>be</b> <b>there</b> <b>at</b> the entrance of the Meenakshi Temple. Those who dare to prevent the Dalits' entry into the temple, could come there and meet me. I will answer them".|$|E
2500|$|The film is {{a comedy}} drama, set around leading cricketer Sam Palmer's last {{appearance}} for England. He desperately wants his son to <b>be</b> <b>there</b> <b>at</b> The Oval to witness this, but the son {{is more concerned with}} meeting a leading poet Alexander Whitehead. Whitehead, it turns out, is more interested in cricket. [...] Whitehead takes Reggie along to the match, in time to see Sam get out for a duck.|$|E

The Casados and topasses were arranged into small squads called [...] "companion groups" [...] and deployed with the regular troops to strengthen the defenses.|$|E

2500|$|Unlike animals, {{plants are}} limited {{in their ability to}} seek out {{favorable}} conditions for life and growth. As a result, plants have evolved many ways to disperse their offspring by dispersing their seeds (see also vegetative reproduction). A seed must somehow [...] "arrive" [...] at a location and <b>be</b> <b>there</b> <b>at</b> a time favorable for germination and growth. When the fruits open and release their seeds in a regular way, it is called dehiscent, which is often distinctive for related groups of plants; these fruits include capsules, follicles, legumes, silicles and siliques. [...] When fruits do not open and release their seeds in a regular fashion, they are called indehiscent, which include the fruits achenes, caryopsis, nuts, samaras, and utricles.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the same}} Entertainment Weekly article, Corgan {{disclosed}} that {{things went wrong}} {{at some of the}} very first recording sessions. [...] "...it was like, 'What do you mean the guitar's out of tune? What do you mean I have to <b>be</b> <b>there</b> <b>at</b> 11? What do you mean I can't order $100 of lobster every day?' I mean, like, bad. But it was too late. It was already public. The album was going out. So I did what I always did: try {{to make the best of}} a situation and start covering up. Put on a good face. And honestly, I'm glad the thing didn't sell, because if it had sold well it would have been really tough. I would look like I was going to walk away from something that I'd just built." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{the tour}} progressed, Vaughan was longing {{to work on}} {{material}} for his next LP, but in January 1987, he filed for a divorce from Lenny, which restricted him of any projects until the proceedings were finalized. This prevented him from writing and recording songs for almost two years, but Double Trouble wrote the song [...] "Crossfire" [...] with Bill Carter and Ruth Ellsworth. Layton recalled: [...] "Basically, we wrote the music, {{and they had to}} write the lyrics. We had just gotten together; Stevie was unable to <b>be</b> <b>there</b> <b>at</b> that time. He was in Dallas doing some things, and we just got together and started writing some songs. That was the first one we wrote." [...] On August 6, 1987, Double Trouble appeared at the Austin Aqua Festival, where they played to one of the largest audiences of their career. According to biographer Craig Hopkins, as many as 20,000 people attended the concert. Following a month-long tour as the opening act for Robert Plant in May 1988, which included a concert at Toronto's Maple Leaf Gardens, the band was booked for a European leg, which included 22 performances, and ended in Oulu, Finland on July 17. This would be Vaughan's last concert appearance in Europe.|$|E

2500|$|... a {{congregation}} consisting of 10,000 souls, streaming into the hall, mounting the galleries, humming, buzzing, and swarming– a mighty hive of bees– eager to secure {{at first the}} best places, and, at last, any place at all. After waiting {{more than half an}} hour– for if you wish to have a seat you must <b>be</b> <b>there</b> <b>at</b> least that space of time in advance... Mr. Spurgeon ascended his tribune. To the hum, and rush, and trampling of men, succeeded a low, concentrated thrill and murmur of devotion, which seemed to run at once, like an electric current, through the breast of everyone present, and by this magnetic chain the preacher held us fast bound for about two hours. It is not my purpose to give a summary of his discourse. It is enough to say of his voice, that its power and volume are sufficient to reach every one in that vast assembly; of his language that it is neither high-flown nor homely; of his style, that it is at times familiar, at times declamatory, but always happy, and often eloquent; of his doctrine, that neither the 'Calvinist' nor the 'Baptist' appears in the forefront of the battle which is waged by Mr. Spurgeon with relentless animosity, and with Gospel weapons, against irreligion, cant, hypocrisy, pride, and those secret bosom-sins which so easily beset a man in daily life; and to sum up all in a word, it is enough to say, of the man himself, that he impresses you with a perfect conviction of his sincerity.|$|E
