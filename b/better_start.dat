5|$|Following the {{retirement}} of long-standing WIBF belt holder Regina Halmich, Kentikian unified the WBA and vacant WIBF Flyweight titles {{in her hometown of}} Hamburg on December 7, 2007. She met Nadia Hokmi in a rematch of their contest six months earlier. The French boxer again proved to be a tough opponent and the fight developed very similarly to their first encounter. Once more, Kentikian had the <b>better</b> <b>start,</b> but Hokmi scored {{during the second half of}} the fight, again making it a close bout. This time however, Kentikian was ahead on all three of the judges' scorecards, winning by unanimous decision.|$|E
5|$|Frentzen {{also got}} a <b>better</b> <b>start</b> than Villeneuve and overtook him. Under the orders of the Williams team, on lap eight Frentzen let {{teammate}} Villeneuve past. Schumacher made his first pit-stop on lap 22 and Villeneuve made his first stop the following lap. Both retained their positions. During {{the first round of}} pitstops the McLarens swapped places with David Coulthard leading Mika Häkkinen and Frentzen dropped to fifth position behind both of them. The order of the leaders after the second round of pitstops on lap 43 and lap 44 remained the same but with Villeneuve closer to Schumacher.|$|E

As the season progressed, however, Perry began to find his scoring touch, ultimately finishing the season with 15 goals and 36 points. In a game against the Minnesota Wild, Perry delivered a late hit to the head of Jason Zucker. After a review of the hit by NHL executive Rob Blake, Perry was given a four-game suspension.|$|E

The infantrymen of the X Corps had a <b>better</b> <b>start</b> to the day, as Brig. Gen. Alfred H. Terry's division broke through the Confederate line. Wright's Brigade was hit hard and retreated, opening a significant gap. The heavily wooded terrain prevented Birney and Hancock from understanding that they had reached a position of advantage and they were unable to exploit it before Field rearranged his lines to fill the gap and drive back the Federals.|$|E
25|$|Ralf Schumacher {{had made}} a much <b>better</b> <b>start</b> than Montoya and jumped ahead of his {{teammate}} off the grid and through the first corner. As they came down the front straight to start the second lap, however, with their BMW engines turning over 19,000 RPM, the fastest ever by any car {{in the history of}} the Speedway, the two collided. Montoya pulled ahead on the outside of Schumacher approaching the turn and so had the better line. When Schumacher turned into the corner from his inside position, he ran over the plastic curbing and his rear end slid around and contacted the side of Montoya's car as it went by. Schumacher subsequently made a pit stop for a new rear wing.|$|E

Even so, four wickets fell before close of play and Pakistan went into the rest day on 158 for four, still 140 in arrears. On the fourth day (Monday), Brian Statham took two quick wickets and Pakistan's fate was sealed despite resistance by Saeed Ahmed, who scored 65. England's bowlers shared the wickets: Statham took six in the match, Allen and Tony Lock five each and Fred Trueman four. The match ended on Monday afternoon, Pakistan all out for 274 and England winning by an innings and 24 runs.|$|E

25|$|The final {{took place}} on 7 October, between England and Australia in Colombo. England {{maintained}} their tactic of bowling first when Edwards won the toss, although it was Australia who made the far <b>better</b> <b>start,</b> scoring 47 off their first 6 overs during the powerplay without losing a wicket. Lanning and Alyssa Healy were dismissed soon afterwards, with Colvin taking 2-21 off her 4 overs, but Jess Cameron scored 45 off 34 balls. Although after Cameron's dismissal Australia only scored 23 runs off their final 23 balls, they posted a competitive score of 142-4. England were unable to match Australia's fast start, and with the run rate climbing, Australia {{were able to take}} crucial wickets at important times, Ellyse Perry making a huge impact in having Taylor caught behind and taking the catches for both Edwards and Greenway's dismissals. When Brunt was bowled by Jess Jonassen first ball of the 17th over, England needed 42 off 23 balls with just 3 wickets left. Despite valiant efforts from Jenny Gunn and Danielle Hazell, Hazell was unable to hit the final ball of the match for six off Erin Osborne, and Australia won by 4 runs.|$|E
25|$|The {{start of}} the race was delayed by rain and {{lightning}} {{in the vicinity of}} the speedway for nearly 30 minutes. The drivers were called to their cars at 8:40p.m. and rolled off pit road around 8:57. Under night Tennessee skies, Carl Edwards led the field to the green flag at 9:03. Teammate Denny Hamlin got a much <b>better</b> <b>start</b> and led the first lap. Chase Elliott worked his way up to Hamlin and passed him for the lead on the ninth lap. Kyle Busch reeled him in to pass under him in turn 4 to take the lead on lap 23. The first caution of the race flew on lap 30 for rain. It picked up in intensity to the point that the race was red-flagged on lap 38. The red flag period lasted for one hour, 24 minutes and four seconds before engines were refired at 10:42 and the cars rolled back onto the track. After eight laps riding around, the rain returned with greater intensity and the race was red-flagged a second time at lap 48. Just past 11:00, the rest of the race was postponed to Sunday at 1:00p.m.|$|E
25|$|Chaz Mostert {{took his}} first V8 Supercar pole {{position}} when he qualified fastest for the first race of the Ubet Perth Super Sprint. His teammate Mark Winterbottom qualified second {{and went on to}} score pole position for the second race. Winterbottom made a <b>better</b> <b>start</b> than Mostert in the first race and the pair went on to finish first and second, while Craig Lowndes finished in third. Jamie Whincup, after qualifying in 21st place, managed to finish in 15th place but lost the championship lead to Lowndes. Winterbottom won the second race ahead of Whincup and Fabian Coulthard. With Lowndes finishing fifth, Winterbottom took the championship lead. Mostert took his second pole in qualifying for the Sunday race. The session saw Lee Holdsworth make a mistake at turn six and his car rolled onto its side after digging into the sand trap. Despite starting off the front row, Mostert and Winterbottom finished fourth and 15th respectively after their tyre strategy was ruined by a safety car on lap 48. Will Davison won the race, taking Erebus Motorsport's second ever victory, after passing Lowndes for the lead with five laps remaining. Coulthard finished third despite starting 24th. With Winterbottom finishing down the order, Lowndes left the event with the championship lead.|$|E

Enzymes in superfamilies {{such as the}} α/β-hydrolase fold superfamily have similar structures and active sites because they evolved from a common ancestor.

Our hypothesis is that promiscuous ancestral enzymes may be <b>better</b> <b>starting</b> points to obtain new catalytic activities compared to modern enzymes. To test this hypothesis, I tried to improve the promiscuous and unnatural nitroaldol activity in both a modern and an ancestral hydroxynitrile lyase using semi rational and random approaches.

Usually the Adelaide Oval was the flattest in Australia, but the Sheffield Shield match {{beforehand}} {{had been}} affected by a dust-storm followed by a sudden 22 degree drop in temperature. The wicket planned for the MCC match was unusable and an old wicket from a state match was used instead. Captain Les Favell (9) and Lynn Marks (30) added 25 for the first wicket, after which six wickets fell in nine oversr as David Larter (3/29), Dave Brown (3/35) and Dave Allen (4/24) bowled them out for 103. Geoff Boycott (94) and John Edrich (61) passed this with an opening stand of 116 in 83 minutes. Boycott had been ill and this was his first innings in Australia, hitting his first ball for four. After they were out only Ken Barrington (69) made any runs as Neil Hawke (3/71) and David Sincock (5/113) took control, and the MCC were out for 310. Les Favell (96) and Marks (67) gave South Australia a <b>better</b> <b>start</b> with 150 for the first wicket, the wicketkeeper Barry Jarman made 61 and Alan Shiell 83 {{in a total of}} 364. Thanks to their low first innings this only gave the MCC 158 runs to win and they made them for the lost of 4 wickets on the fourth morning, Barrington making 51 and Hawke (2/49) and Sincock (2/67) against the best bowlers.|$|E
