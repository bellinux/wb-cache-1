25|$|The {{first three}} Yugo {{vehicles}} (Red, White, and Blue) {{were introduced to}} the U.S. public at the Greater Los Angeles Auto Show in May 1984 held at the Los Angeles Convention Center.

Front page articles about the Yugo appeared in the Los Angeles Times (<b>Business</b> <b>Section),</b> New York Times, and The National Enquirer. However, problems soon arose as one car was sent to the California Air Research Board (CARB) for emissions testing– it failed abysmally.

500|$|News of the April {{meetings}} between the senators and the FHLBB officials {{first appeared in}} National Thrift News in September 1987, but was only sporadically covered by the general media {{for the next year}} and a half. In early 1988, The Detroit News ran a story on Riegle's participation, which Riegle responded to on Meet the Press by denying an interceding on Lincoln's behalf, before returning Keating's campaign contributions back to him. In spring 1988, the Los Angeles Times ran a short piece in their <b>business</b> <b>section,</b> but their political reporters did not follow up on it; two isolated, inside page mentions by The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal similarly failed to develop further. As media critic Howard Kurtz would later write, [...] "the saga of Charles Keating took years to penetrate the national consciousness." [...] The political fortunes of the senators involved did not suffer at this time. During the 1988 U.S. presidential election, McCain was mentioned by the press as a vice-presidential running mate for Republican nominee George H. W. Bush, while Glenn was one of the two vice-presidential finalists in Michael Dukakis' selection process, losing out to Lloyd Bentsen.|$|E
500|$|Development of Silent Hill 2 {{began in}} June 1999, {{directly}} {{after the completion}} of its predecessor. The game was created by Team Silent, a production group within Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo. The story was conceived by CGI director Takayoshi Sato, who based it on Russian author Fyodor Dostoyevsky's novel Crime and Punishment (1866), with individual members of the team collaborating on the actual scenario. The main writing was done by Hiroyuki Owaku and Sato who provided the dialog for the female characters. Silent Hill 2s budget has been estimated at US$7–10 million by Sato, in contrast with the previous installment's estimated cost of US$3–5 million. The decision to produce a sequel to Silent Hill was partly a financial one, as it had been commercially successful, and partly a creative one, as the team had faced difficulties while working on the original game. The team was given a small window to settle on a platform. As it was unable to gather information on the then-unannounced GameCube and Xbox consoles, they began production of the game for the PlayStation 2. Producer Akihiro Imamura stated that the decision was also influenced by [...] "a wish from the <b>business</b> <b>section</b> that we move rapidly on the PS2. You know, it is currently the market focus". Imamura read all comments about the original game and kept them in mind while working on Silent Hill 2. He estimated that a total of fifty people worked on the game: while the creative team from the first game remained, they had to bring in thirty people from Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo. Developed at the same time, the PlayStation 2 version of Silent Hill 2 and its Xbox port debuted at the March 2001 Tokyo Game Show to positive reactions.|$|E
