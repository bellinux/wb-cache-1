5|$|After {{intercontinental}} compatibility tests, Petersen and Bermudes {{suggested that}} <b>bioluminescence</b> and compatibility were independent since <b>bioluminescence</b> {{seemed to be}} geographically restricted. This suggested that the ability or potential to interbreed must have been preserved since separation of P.stypticus into geographically isolated areas.|$|E
5|$|Non-marine <b>bioluminescence</b> is less widely distributed, the two best-known cases {{being in}} fireflies and glow worms. Other {{invertebrates}} including insect larvae, annelids and arachnids possess bioluminescent abilities. Some forms of <b>bioluminescence</b> are brighter (or exist only) at night, following a circadian rhythm.|$|E
5|$|Animal {{coloration}} may be {{the result}} of any combination of pigments, chromatophores, structural coloration and <b>bioluminescence.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Bioluminescence</b> is the {{production}} and emission of light by a living organism. It {{is a form of}} chemiluminescence. <b>Bioluminescence</b> occurs widely in marine vertebrates and invertebrates, as well as in some fungi, microorganisms including some bioluminescent bacteria and terrestrial invertebrates such as fireflies. In some animals, the light is bacteriogenic, produced by symbiotic organisms such as Vibrio bacteria; in others, it is autogenic, produced by the animals themselves.|$|E
5|$|Both the mycelia and {{the fruit}} bodies of M.haematopus (both young and mature specimens) are {{reported}} to be bioluminescent. However, the luminescence is quite weak, and not visible to the dark-adapted eye; in one study, light emission was detectable only after 20hours of exposure to X-ray film. Although the biochemical basis of <b>bioluminescence</b> in M.haematopus has not been scientifically investigated, in general, <b>bioluminescence</b> {{is caused by the}} action of luciferases, enzymes that produce light by the oxidation of a luciferin (a pigment). The biological purpose of <b>bioluminescence</b> in fungi is not definitively known, although several hypotheses have been suggested: it may help attract insects to help with spore dispersal, it may be a by-product of other biochemical functions, or it may help deter heterotrophs that might consume the fungus.|$|E
5|$|In {{common with}} some {{plant and animal}} species, more than 70 fungal species display <b>bioluminescence.</b>|$|E
5|$|The comb rows of most planktonic ctenophores {{produce a}} rainbow effect, {{which is not}} caused by <b>bioluminescence</b> but by the {{scattering}} of light as the combs move. Most species are also bioluminescent, but the light is usually blue or green and can only be seen in darkness. However some significant groups, including all known platyctenids and the cydippid genus Pleurobrachia, are incapable of <b>bioluminescence.</b>|$|E
5|$|A few {{bacteria}} have {{chemical systems}} that generate light. This <b>bioluminescence</b> often occurs in bacteria {{that live in}} association with fish, and the light probably serves to attract fish or other large animals.|$|E
5|$|Counter-illumination through <b>bioluminescence</b> on the {{underside}} (ventral region) {{of the body is}} found in many species that live in the open ocean down to about 1000 metres. The generated light increases an animal's brightness when seen from below to match the brightness of the ocean surface; it is an effective form of active camouflage. It is notably used by some species of squid, such as the midwater squid, Abralia veranyi. These have light-producing organs (photophores) scattered all over their undersides, creating a sparkling glow that prevents the animal from appearing as a dark shape when seen from below. Counter-illumination camouflage is the likely function of the <b>bioluminescence</b> of many marine organisms, though light is also produced to attract or to detect prey and for signalling.|$|E
5|$|Dinoflagellates may use <b>bioluminescence</b> for defence against predators. They shine {{when they}} detect a predator, {{possibly}} making the predator itself more vulnerable by attracting {{the attention of}} predators from higher trophic levels. Grazing copepods release any phytoplankton cells that flash, unharmed; if they were eaten they would make the copepods glow, attracting predators, so the phytoplankton's <b>bioluminescence</b> is defensive. The problem of shining stomach contents is solved (and the explanation corroborated) in predatory deep-sea fishes: their stomachs have a black lining {{able to keep the}} light from any bioluminescent fish prey which they have swallowed from attracting larger predators.|$|E
5|$|The mycelia (but not {{the fruit}} bodies) of Armillaria gallica {{are known to}} be bioluminescent. Experiments have shown that the {{intensity}} of the luminescence is enhanced when the mycelia are disturbed during growth or when they are exposed to fluorescent light. <b>Bioluminescence</b> is caused by the action of luciferases, enzymes that produce light by the oxidation of a luciferin (a pigment). The biological purpose of <b>bioluminescence</b> in fungi is not definitively known, although several hypotheses have been suggested: it may help attract insects to help with spore dispersal, it may be a by-product of other biochemical functions, or it may help deter heterotrophs that might consume the fungus.|$|E
5|$|Among the anecdotes of {{navigation}} by <b>bioluminescence,</b> the Apollo 13 astronaut Jim Lovell recounted how as a navy pilot {{he had found}} {{his way back to}} his aircraft carrier USS Shangri-La when his navigation systems failed. Turning off his cabin lights, he saw the glowing wake of the ship, and was able to fly to it and land safely.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bioluminescence</b> {{attracted}} the attention of the United States Navy in the Cold War, since submarines in some waters can create a bright enough wake to be detected; a German submarine was sunk in the First World War, having been detected in this way. The navy was interested in predicting when such detection would be possible, and hence guiding their own submarines to avoid detection.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bioluminescence</b> occurs widely among animals, {{especially}} in the open sea, including fish, jellyfish, comb jellies, crustaceans, and cephalopod molluscs; in some fungi and bacteria; and in various terrestrial invertebrates including insects. About 76% of the main taxa of deep-sea animals produce light. Most marine light-emission is in the blue and green light spectrum. However, some loose-jawed fish emit red and infrared light, and the genus Tomopteris emits yellow light.|$|E
5|$|Bioluminescent {{organisms are}} {{a target for}} many areas of research. Luciferase systems are widely used in genetic {{engineering}} as reporter genes, each producing a different colour by fluorescence, and for biomedical research using <b>bioluminescence</b> imaging. For example, the firefly luciferase gene was used as early as 1986 for research using transgenic tobacco plants. Vibrio bacteria symbiose with marine invertebrates such as the Hawaiian bobtail squid (Euprymna scolopes), are key experimental models for <b>bioluminescence.</b> Bioluminescent activated destruction is an experimental cancer treatment. See also optogenetics which {{involves the use of}} light to control cells in living tissue, typically neurons, that have been genetically modified to express light-sensitive ion channels, and also see biophoton, a photon of non-thermal origin in the visible and ultraviolet spectrum emitted from a biological system.|$|E
5|$|Carbon dioxide (CO2), {{adenosine}} monophosphate (AMP) and phosphate groups (PP) are released as waste products. Luciferase catalyzes the reaction, {{which may be}} mediated by cofactors such as calcium (Ca2+) or magnesium (Mg2+) ions, and for some types of luciferin (L) also the energy-carrying molecule adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The reaction can occur either inside or outside the cell. In bacteria such as Aliivibrio, the expression of genes related to <b>bioluminescence</b> {{is controlled by the}} lux operon.|$|E
5|$|In {{a general}} sense, the {{principal}} chemical reaction in <b>bioluminescence</b> involves some light-emitting molecule and an enzyme, generally called the luciferin and the luciferase, respectively. Because these are generic names, the luciferins and luciferases are often distinguished by including the species or group, i.e. Firefly luciferin. In all characterized cases, the enzyme catalyzes the oxidation of the luciferin.|$|E
5|$|In ctenophores, <b>bioluminescence</b> {{is caused}} by the {{activation}} of calcium-activated proteins named photoproteins in cells called photocytes, which are often confined to the meridional canals that underlie the eight comb rows. In the genome of Mnemiopsis leidyi ten genes encode photoproteins. These genes are co-expressed with opsin genes in the developing photocytes of Mnemiopsis leidyi, raising the possibility that light production and light detection may be working together in these animals.|$|E
5|$|In general, <b>bioluminescence</b> {{is caused}} by the action of luciferases, enzymes that produce light by the {{oxidation}} of a luciferin (a pigment). Several studies have evaluated the biochemical basis of light production in Panellus stipticus, and concluded that there is no specific fungal luciferase. The fungus was shown in 1988 to contain the sesquiterpene panal, which has a cadinene keto-aldehyde chemical structure. Later, two additional precursors were isolated, PS-A (1-O-decanoylpanal) and PS-B (1-O-dodecanoylpanal). If these compounds are treated with salt of ammonia or primary amines in the presence of iron(II), hydrogen peroxide, and a cationic surfactant, light is emitted by a chemiluminescence reaction, suggesting that panal and its derivatives are fungal luciferins, and that the chemiluminescence reaction is the cause of in vivo <b>bioluminescence.</b> In the fungus, the level of activity of the enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD) appears to {{play a critical role in}} the amount of light emission. SOD quenches the effect of the superoxide (O2−) anion required in the reaction, and thus SOD activity has to be inhibited for the reaction to occur.|$|E
5|$|In some species, the {{luciferase}} requires other cofactors such as calcium or magnesium ions, {{and sometimes}} also the energy-carrying molecule adenosine triphosphate (ATP). In evolution, luciferins vary little: one in particular, coelenterazine, {{is found in}} eleven different animal (phyla), though in some of these, the animals obtain it through their diet. Conversely, luciferases vary widely between different species, and consequently <b>bioluminescence</b> has arisen over forty times in evolutionary history.|$|E
5|$|Reynolds {{became the}} Class of 1909 Professor of Physics in 1978, and Professor Emeritus 1987. For 31 years he {{combined}} {{his interest in}} the sea and science by working during the summer at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, where he studied marine <b>bioluminescence.</b> He also worked at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.|$|E
5|$|The French {{pharmacologist}} Raphaël Dubois {{carried out}} work on <b>bioluminescence</b> {{in the late}} nineteenth century. He studied click beetles (Pyrophorus) and the marine bivalve mollusc Pholas dactylus. He refuted the old idea that <b>bioluminescence</b> came from phosphorus, and demonstrated that the process was related to the oxidation of a specific compound, which he named luciferin, by an enzyme. He sent Harvey siphons from the mollusc preserved in sugar. Harvey had become interested in <b>bioluminescence</b> as a result of visiting the South Pacific and Japan and observing phosphorescent organisms there. He studied the phenomenon for many years. His research aimed to demonstrate that luciferin, and the enzymes that act on it is to produce light, were interchangeable between species, showing that all bioluminescent organisms had a common ancestor. However, he found this hypothesis to be false, with different organisms having major differences in the composition of their light-producing proteins. He spent the next thirty years purifying and studying the components, but it fell to the young Japanese chemist Osamu Shimomura {{to be the first to}} obtain crystalline luciferin. He used the sea firefly Vargula hilgendorfii, but it was another ten years before he discovered the chemical's structure and was able to publish his 1957 paper Crystalline Cypridina Luciferin. More recently, Martin Chalfie, Osamu Shimomura and Roger Y. Tsien won the 2008 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their 1961 discovery and development of green fluorescent protein as a tool for biological research.|$|E
5|$|The <b>bioluminescence</b> of O.nidiformis fruit bodies is best seen in low-light {{conditions}} {{when the}} viewer's eyes have become dark-adapted. The gills {{are the most}} luminescent part of the fungus, emitting a greenish light that fades with age. Although {{the intensity of the}} luminescence is variable, William Henry Harvey once reported that it was bright enough to read a watch face by. It is not known if the mycelium is also luminescent.|$|E
5|$|The cookiecutter shark uses <b>bioluminescence</b> to {{camouflage}} its underside by counterillumination, but a {{small patch}} near its pectoral fins remains dark, appearing as a small fish to large predatory fish like tuna and mackerel swimming beneath it. When such fish approach the lure, they are bitten by the shark.|$|E
5|$|The uses of <b>bioluminescence</b> by animals include counter-illumination camouflage, mimicry {{of other}} animals, for example to lure prey, and {{signalling}} to other individuals {{of the same}} species, such as to attract mates. In the laboratory, luciferase-based systems are used in genetic engineering and for biomedical research. Other researchers are investigating {{the possibility of using}} bioluminescent systems for street and decorative lighting, and a bioluminescent plant has been created.|$|E
5|$|While most marine <b>bioluminescence</b> {{is green}} to blue, some deep sea barbeled dragonfishes in the genera Aristostomias, Pachystomias and Malacosteus emit a red glow. This {{adaptation}} allows {{the fish to}} see red-pigmented prey, which are normally invisible in the deep ocean environment where red light has been filtered out by the water column.|$|E
5|$|A {{fungus gnat}} from New Zealand, Arachnocampa luminosa, {{lives in the}} predator-free {{environment}} of caves and its larvae emit bluish-green light. They dangle silken threads that glow and attract flying insects, and wind in their fishing-lines when prey becomes entangled. The <b>bioluminescence</b> of the larvae of another fungus gnat from North America which lives on streambanks and under overhangs has a similar function. Orfelia fultoni builds sticky little webs and emits light of a deep blue colour. It has an inbuilt biological clock and, even when kept in total darkness, turns its light on and off in a circadian rhythm.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Reynolds began a long {{academic}} career at Princeton University. He {{was director of}} the Princeton's High Energy Physics Program from 1948 until 1970, when he became the first director of Princeton's new Center for Environmental Studies. He combined his interest in the sea and science by working during the summers at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, where he studied marine <b>bioluminescence.</b> He also worked at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bioluminescence</b> {{is used by}} {{a variety}} of animals to mimic other species. Many species of deep sea fish such as the {{anglerfish}} and dragonfish make use of aggressive mimicry to attract prey. They have an appendage on their heads called an esca that contains bioluminescent bacteria able to produce a long-lasting glow which the fish can control. The glowing esca is dangled or waved about to lure small animals to within striking distance of the fish.|$|E
5|$|Bioluminescent {{tissue in}} the mature fruit body is {{restricted}} {{to the edge of}} the gills (as well as the cross-veins that connect them), the junction of the gills with the stem, and the inrolled cap edge. Distribution of <b>bioluminescence</b> along the gill edge corresponds to the position of the cheilocystidia. Less than 10% of the light emitted from both the young and mature fruit bodies is from other tissues, including the fertile hymenial area and the stem. Fruit body luminescence is highly variable between fruit bodies found on different logs in different environments.|$|E
5|$|Both Aristotle and Pliny the Elder {{mentioned}} that damp wood sometimes gives off a glow and many centuries later Robert Boyle showed that oxygen {{was involved in}} the process, both in wood and in glow-worms. It was not until the late nineteenth century that <b>bioluminescence</b> was properly investigated. The phenomenon is widely distributed among animal groups, especially in marine environments where dinoflagellates cause phosphorescence in the surface layers of water. On land it occurs in fungi, bacteria and some groups of invertebrates, including insects.|$|E
5|$|Counter-illumination means {{producing}} {{light to}} match a background that is brighter than an animal's body or military vehicle; it {{is a form}} of active camouflage. It is notably used by some species of squid, such as the firefly squid and the midwater squid. The latter has light-producing organs (photophores) scattered all over its underside; these create a sparkling glow that prevents the animal from appearing as a dark shape when seen from below. Counterillumination camouflage is the likely function of the <b>bioluminescence</b> of many marine organisms, though light is also produced to attract or to detect prey and for signalling.|$|E
5|$|In evolution, luciferins {{generally}} vary little: one in particular, coelenterazine, is {{the light}} emitting pigment for nine ancient phyla (groups of very different organisms), including polycystine radiolaria, Cercozoa (Phaeodaria), protozoa, comb jellies, cnidaria including jellyfish and corals, crustaceans, molluscs, arrow worms and vertebrates (ray-finned fish). Not all these organisms synthesize coelenterazine: {{some of them}} obtain it through their diet. Conversely, luciferase enzymes vary widely and tend to be different in each species. Overall, <b>bioluminescence</b> has arisen over forty times in evolutionary history.|$|E
5|$|In {{many animals}} {{of the deep}} sea, {{including}} several squid species, bacterial <b>bioluminescence</b> is used for camouflage by counterillumination, in which the animal matches the overhead environmental light as seen from below. In these animals, photoreceptors control the illumination to match {{the brightness of the}} background. These light organs are usually separate from the tissue containing the bioluminescent bacteria. However, in one species, Euprymna scolopes, the bacteria are an integral component of the animal's light organ.|$|E
5|$|Panellus stipticus uses a heterothallic, tetrapolar mating system: each {{basidiospore}} develops into a self-sterile mycelium which, when grown alone, remains homokaryotic (i.e., {{with all}} cells genetically identical) indefinitely. Researchers have paired collections of P.stipticus from Japan and Eastern North America, and later, collections from New Zealand and Russia. Although the separated allopatric populations differ in <b>bioluminescence</b> and taste, {{the results revealed}} a universal intercompatibility group over these geographical regions. In a 2001 study, Jin and colleagues also paired geographically representative collections of the fungus, but observed a reduced ability to cross between Northern Hemisphere and Oceanian collections, {{as well as between}} and within Oceanian collections.|$|E
5|$|Using {{techniques}} of genetic complementation, Macrae paired nonluminescent monocaryons with luminescent ones, {{and concluded that}} luminosity in P.stipticus is an inherited character, and governed by {{a single pair of}} alleles in which luminosity was dominant over nonluminosity. Luminosity factors were independent of intersterility factors. In 1992, Lingle and colleagues agreed with Macrae about luminosity and stated that at least three different gene mutations could lead to the loss of luminescence. They also reported that the maximum <b>bioluminescence</b> was found at 525nm, and shifted to 528nm in deeply pigmented fruit bodies.|$|E
