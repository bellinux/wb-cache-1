60|$|Tying up a Prisoner for the night.--If {{a man has}} to be kept {{prisoner}} all night, it is {{not sufficient}} to tie his hands, as he will <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> his time and run away. It is therefore necessary to tie them round a standing tree, or a heavy log of wood. A convenient plan is to fell a large forked bough, and to make the man's arms fast round one of the branches. It is thus impossible for him to slip away, as the fork on one side, and the bushy top of the branch on the other, prevent his doing so; and, notwithstanding his cramped position, it is quite possible for him to get sleep.|$|E
60|$|Tom asked no {{questions}} about the horses; he had thought of them a score of times as he stood on guard, and the thought had {{occurred to him that}} it was possible the shots he had heard while they were building the wall on the previous afternoon, had been the death shots of the horses. It did not occur to him when Sam was telling the story about the bear, that this was a got-up tale, but when he came to think it over, he thought it probable that it was so. Sam himself was not much of a shot, but Ben, although inferior to Harry or either of the two Indians, shot as well as Jerry, and would hardly have missed a bear three or four times running. Each time the thought of the horses occurred to him he resolutely put it aside, and concentrated his mind upon the probable perils of the passage down the cañons and the wonderful gorges they would traverse, and the adventures and excitement they were sure to pass through. He thought how fortunate it was they had taken the precaution of sending their specimens of quartz back to the fort; for were they in the canoes, the fruits of the journey would be irrevocably lost were these to upset; for now the Indians had twice discovered the presence of whites in the valley they would <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> it closely, and it would not be possible {{to go up to the}} mine again unless in strong force.|$|E

The media hounds Susan and goads her into outbursts of profanity to write about in their papers, with headlines like [...] "Hairy Angel, Never Been Kissed" [...] ("Mad World"). Then come the broadcasts of the semi-final and final, where after seventeen agonising seconds an exhausted Susan hears that she finished as runner-up to the Diversity dance troupe. Susan feels desolate, convinced that losing means any chance for a singing career is gone ("End of the World").|$|E

60|$|Scipio {{remained}} in Africa till he had arranged matters and won {{such a claim}} to Massinissa's gratitude that this king of Numidia <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> over the interests of Rome. Scipio then returned home, and entered Rome with a grand triumph, all the nobler for himself {{that he did not}} lead Hannibal in his chains. He had been too generous to demand that so brave an enemy should be delivered up to him. He received the surname of Africanus, {{and was one of the}} most respected and beloved of Romans. He was the first who began to take up Greek learning and culture, and to exchange the old Roman ruggedness for the graces of philosophy and poetry. Indeed the Romans were beginning to have much to do with the Greeks, and the war they entered upon now was the first for the sake of spreading their own power. All the former ones had been in self-defence, and the new one did in fact spring out of the Punic war, for the Carthaginians had tried to persuade Philip, king of Macedon, to follow in the track of Pyrrhus, and come and help Hannibal in Southern Italy. The Romans had kept him off by stirring up the robber Ætolians against him; and when he began to punish these wild neighbors, the Romans leagued themselves with the old Greek cities which Macedon oppressed, and a great war took place.|$|R

We consulted our guide and found that a line of steamers sailed from Hull to Bremen once a week.

There they waited for further instructions. I sent the instructions by a thoroughly capable and trustworthy man--an Italian courier, known to me by an experience of twenty years. Shall I confess it? I thought I had done rather a clever thing in providing Mrs. Linley with a friend in need while I was away from her." ...|$|R

Michael Rechtshaffen of The Hollywood Reporter said [...] "There's a fresh {{candidate}} in the running for worst movie of 2007 honours. [...] "I Know Who Killed Me", a ridiculous thriller (minus the thrills) starring the embattled Lindsay Lohan in a dual role, has all the hallmarks necessary for qualification: A nonsensical plot that grows sillier by the second, tawdry special effects, heavy-handed symbolism that's big on electric-blue hues and mechanical performances are all culprits {{as far as the}} title's concerned."

Well, if you do, <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> never <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> this, because it will spoil those memories forever. We could forgive Lohan for wanting to make a racier, adult thriller.

2500|$|The series {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics. Anime News Network's Nick Creamer gave a series a 4 out 5 stars, saying that [...] "After watching {{half a dozen}} premiers that just wouldn't stop with the exposition, it <b>sure</b> <b>is</b> nice <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> a show that actually has confidence in its own storytelling. Iron-Blooded Orphans hits the ground running, establishing its world in the natural conversations of its many characters." [...] He criticized that [...] "Mari Okada's an inconsistent writer, but definitely a talented one, and given {{the focus of a}} traditional Gundam-style opening, her gift for illustrating character shines through." [...] Zac Bertschy gave the series a 4.5 for the first episode, saying [...] "Iron-Blooded Orphans has a lot of moving parts, but it's only deceptively complex; this episode starts out confusing (due to the relatively haphazard way they introduce all the various factions and the sizable cast) but as it goes on it all becomes very clear". He also adds [...] "Instantly likable characters, desperate battles, a broad science fiction story about a colony struggling for independence, giant robots and even a Char-like smooth-talking pretty boy weirdo who's working with the bad guys; what's not to love?" ...|$|R

I had no fear of being overtaken, for although the Boers would all have their horses close, in readiness to mount if we should try to break out, I must have got a good quarter of a mile start, and they were not likely to keep up the chase long, as they could not tell which way I might have doubled, and if they pursued far, it would be in the direction of Greytown. It was about a seventy-mile ride, and as I started about twelve, I have done it in nine hours. I foundered the horse, but fortunately he did not drop till I was within half a mile of the camp. Now, where can I find the general?" ...|$|R
500|$|Listed at 5ft 10 in (1.78 m) and 160 pounds (73kg), Pierce {{was also}} among the more {{diminutive}} pitchers to enjoy great success, and is likely the smallest pitcher since the 1920s to win 200 games. Sherm Lollar, his catcher for ten years in Chicago, noted that his lack of size didn't diminish his velocity, noting, [...] "He isn't too big, but he has wonderful coordination. And he <b>sure</b> <b>is</b> pretty <b>to</b> <b>watch,</b> the way he pumps and rocks and throws. Sometimes, when I'm not catching a game, I'll just go {{off to one side}} and watch him pitch." [...] And Paul Richards noted, [...] "Pierce is a perfectionist who has achieved maximum potential out of the equipment nature gave him." [...] Pierce's size also belied his durability, as {{he was one of the}} few pitchers under [...] in height to lead the league in complete games since the 1920s, with Ned Garver, Frank Lary, Camilo Pascual and Fernando Valenzuela – all of whom were an inch taller and outweighed Pierce by at least 20 pounds – being the only other pitchers under six feet tall to lead the league more than once since the early 1930s. He remains the last pitcher to lead the AL in complete games three years in a row.|$|R

I had rather hoped that our coming back so soon might lead her to think that something was wrong, for she would have known that we could scarce have gone to Amsterdam and discharged, loaded up again, and then back here, especially as the wind had been light ever since she sailed. And sure enough the thought had struck her; for when I caught sight of the garden gate one of your sisters was there on the lookout, and directly she saw me she ran away in. I hurried on as fast as I could go then, for I knew that Mistress Martin would be sorely frightened when she heard that it was neither your father nor you. As I got there your mother was standing at the door. She was just as white as death. 'Cheer up, mistress,' I said as cheery as I could speak.
