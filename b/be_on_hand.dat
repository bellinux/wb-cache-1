5|$|The {{views of}} Whitehall were not echoed by the naval commanders, {{especially}} Sir Varyl Begg, Commander-in-Chief of British {{forces in the}} region, who believed that the carrier {{was too weak to}} defend herself against Indonesian attack or strike in turn against them. Begg adjudged that the narrowness of the Strait combined with local geographical features restricted the ships' movement and negated their radar, while custom prevented the carrier from flying its aircraft or even carrying them on deck, rendering it and the escorts extremely vulnerable in case of attack. He offered instead to send the destroyers, which were far more expendable pieces than a fleet carrier. His views were supported by the High Commissioner to Malaysia, Lord Antony Head, who argued that there would be very little gain for Indonesia and loss for Britain if the carrier was not risked. Luce, however, remained adamant that the Victorious must sail through herself, but in order to assuage Begg's fears assured him that the more modern carrier HMS Centaur would <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>hand</b> to provide air cover for the task force. Reinforcements were also rushed to Singapore to meet any Indonesian provocation. Thorneycroft ordered Begg to begin planning for the forced passage of the Strait, as officials determined on 3–4 September that the carrier must not be diverted.|$|E

Bell had worried that the flight was too dangerous and had arranged for a doctor to <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>hand.</b> With the successful flight, the AEA disbanded and the Silver Dart would revert to Baldwin and McCurdy who began the Canadian Aerodrome Company and would later demonstrate the aircraft to the Canadian Army.|$|E

Health officials would <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>hand</b> at international border checkpoints to ensure anyone found to be infected could be treated immediately. Each machine could cost about US$25,000. The decision to buy them was made after the government found visitors to Laos included people coming from the United States, Spain and other affected countries.|$|E

25|$|The Home Defense League was {{established}} in New York City in 1916 under Police Commissioner Arthur Woods to supplement the police force. Many police officers had joined the armed forces as the war in Europe progressed.

In a matter of months, 22,000 people had volunteered for the Home Defense League. They were required to attend trainings on handling prisoners, protecting themselves, and using weapons. They received no pay.

However, the Saturday night game between the teams was going into extra innings when Scully arrived in town, {{so he went to}} the Astrodome instead of his hotel. He picked up the play-by-play, helping to relieve the other Dodger announcers, who were doing both {{television}} and radio, and broadcast the final 13 innings (after already calling 10 innings in St. Louis), as the game went 22 innings. He broadcast 23 innings in one day in two different cities.|$|E
25|$|On July 14, 1877, Courtney was to {{race against}} James E. Riley at Greenwood Lake in New Jersey. Both men were {{considered}} the best amateur rowers at that time. Both had announced that after the race they would be turning professional. The 36‑year‑old Courtney came into the race undefeated and had beaten Riley twice before {{in the summer of}} 1875. These victories came in Riley’s first two competitive single scull races. One of Courtney victories was only by a quarter boat length. Since that time, the 29‑year‑old Riley had rowed 13 races (winning only 8), but did have the fastest time on record. A large crowd was expected to <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>hand</b> to watch the scullers. The Montclair and Greenwood Lake Railway added extra trains to meet the demand of rowing fans that wanted to witness the event.|$|E

500|$|Evans {{remembered that}} the {{location}} work involving Gabriel, conducted in and around Burnham Beeches in Buckinghamshire {{in the autumn of}} 1968, proved to be arduous because the low levels of light hampered filming. On occasion, just two minutes of new footage would be recorded at each session. On the subject of the remote-control steering, he stated, [...] "I remember standing out of shot and having to 'drive' [...] down the road while it was out of view. Often I didn't know where it was, or where and when it had stopped." [...] A location unit member would <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>hand</b> to stop the car with a large cushion if it went out of control.|$|E
500|$|Between 15 September and 15 November 1942, groups under Herbert Anderson and Walter Zinn {{constructed}} sixteen experimental reactors (known at {{the time}} as [...] "piles") under the Stagg Field stands. Fermi designed a new uranium and graphite pile that could be brought to criticality in a controlled, self-sustaining nuclear reaction. Construction at Argonne fell behind schedule due to Stone & Webster's difficulty recruiting enough skilled workers and obtaining the required building materials. This led to an industrial dispute, with union workers taking action over the recruitment of non-union labor. When {{it became clear that the}} materials for Fermi's new pile would <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>hand</b> before the new structure was completed, Compton approved a proposal from Fermi to build the pile under the stands at Stagg Field.|$|E
500|$|The Age {{commented that}} the [...] "ready {{availability}} of fire-extinguishers and official TV teams {{and the lack of}} verification about the victims" [...] raised questions about whether authorities had advanced knowledge of the self-immolation. Police were on the scene of the self-immolation within 90 seconds carrying numerous pieces of firefighting equipment. A European journalist was quoted as saying [...] "I have never seen policemen patrolling on Tiananmen Square carrying fire extinguishers. How come they all showed up today? The location of the incident is at least 20 minutes roundtrip from the nearest building – the People's Great Hall." [...] John Gittings of The Guardian stated, however, that it was common practice in many countries for police camera operators to <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>hand</b> when a public disturbance is anticipated; the police used small-scale fire-extinguishers of the type carried in public vehicles, many of which are routinely on the square.|$|E

500|$|On 25 June, the Army and the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD) had {{selected}} {{a site in}} the Argonne Forest near Chicago for a plutonium pilot plant. This became known as Site A. [...] were leased from Cook County in August, but by September {{it was apparent that}} the proposed facilities would be too extensive for the site, and it was decided to build the pilot plant elsewhere. The subcritical piles posed little danger, but Groves felt that it would be prudent to locate a critical pile—a fully functional nuclear reactor—at a more remote site. A building at Argonne to house Fermi's experimental pile was commenced, with its completion scheduled for 20 October. Due to industrial disputes, construction fell behind schedule, and it became clear the materials for Fermi's new pile would <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>hand</b> before the new structure was completed. In early November, Fermi came to Compton with a proposal to build the experimental pile under the stands at Stagg Field.|$|E
500|$|Orders {{went out}} on 24 February 1944 for a {{reinforced}} squadron of the 1st Cavalry Division {{to carry out a}} reconnaissance in force in just five days time. If the Admiralty Islands were indeed evacuated, they would be occupied and a base developed. If the enemy was unexpectedly strong, then the force could be withdrawn. General MacArthur and Vice Admiral Thomas C. Kinkaid, the commander of Allied Naval Forces in the South West Pacific Area, would <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>hand</b> to make the decision but otherwise they delegated command to Rear Admiral William Fechteler, the commander of Amphibious Group8 of Rear Admiral Daniel E. Barbey's VII Amphibious Force. To accommodate them, the light cruiser [...] was ordered to sea. At the time, she was in Brisbane, with over 300of her crew on shore leave. Trucks with bull horns broadcast the code word recalling the crew. In order to achieve surprise, and to reach the Admiralty Islands in just five days, high speed transports (APDs) were required; Landing Ships, Tank (LSTs) were too slow to make the required distance in the time.
