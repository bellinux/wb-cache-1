50|$|The term 'power {{hydraulic}} brakes' {{can also}} refer to systems operating on very different principles where an engine-driven pump maintains continual hydraulic pressure {{in a central}} accumulator. The driver's brake pedal simply controls a valve to <b>bleed</b> <b>pressure</b> into the brake units at the wheels, rather than actually creating the pressure in a master cylinder by depressing a piston. This form of brake is analogous to an air brake system but with hydraulic fluid as the working medium rather than air. However, on an air brake air is vented from the system when the brakes are released and the reserve of compressed air must be replenished. On a power hydraulic brake system fluid at low pressure is returned from the brake units at the wheels to the engine-driven pump as the brakes are released, so the central pressure accumulator is almost instantly re-pressurised. This makes the power hydraulic system highly suitable for vehicles that must frequently stop and start (such as buses in cities). The continually circulating fluid also removes problems with freezing parts and collected water vapour that can afflict air systems in cold climates. The AEC Routemaster bus is a well-known application of power hydraulic brakes and the successive generations of Citroen cars with hydropneumatic suspension also used fully powered hydraulic brakes rather than conventional automotive brake systems.|$|E

40|$|Various control-volume models used {{to analyze}} the shock {{boundary}} layer bleed interaction were investigated. The bleed assumptions of the models and their influence on the analytical solutions are discussed. The results of the analysis using these models are compared with experimental boundary-layer data taken in a supersonic inlet. The experimental Mach number upstream of the interaction was 1. 66, and the oblique-shock pressure ratio was 1. 33. The boundary layer data included bleed flow rates up to approximately 0. 6 of the upstream boundary layer mass flow rate. The first model assumed the bleed was removed from the control volume with a momentum that was characterized by a pressure intermediate between the upstream and downstream pressures. The second model assumed the control volume was bounded by a streamline dividing the bleed and residual flows and eliminated the need to specify the momentum of the bleed flow.

40|$|El objetivo del {{proyecto}} es el desarrollo de un método para optimizar el tren de calentadores de una central térmica subcrítica de carbón. Dicho método consistirá en la utilización de un algoritmo genético, que buscará maximizar el rendimiento de la central y minimizar el coste de la electricidad. El diseño de centrales térmicas con rendimientos elevados es fundamental para el sector energético. Mejoras marginales en el funcionamiento de las instalaciones de producción de energía eléctrica disminuyen significativamente el coste de generación. La obtención de estas mejoras permite a las empresas del sector ser más competitivas en los mercados eléctricos modernos. El conjunto de parámetros que gobierna el rendimiento de la central es numeroso, e incluye el número de calentadores cerrados, la presión de las extracciones o las temperaturas en los calentadores. Incrementar el rendimiento termodinámico de una central térmica supone un aumento del coste de los componentes de la misma. Esto da lugar a que la optimización de una central térmica sea un problema complejo que no tiene solución única, y que debe tener en cuenta las limitaciones técnicas de los propios componentes de la instalación. Para el desarrollo del programa de optimización se utilizó el software Matlab, que permite implementar un algoritmo genético de forma sencilla y construir una interfaz de usuario para el programa. La herramienta informática desarrollada permite la configuración de los parámetros que definen a la central de manera intuitiva, permitiendo escoger entre establecer las variables de diseño como valores fijos o rangos. Cuando una variable se establece como rango, el algoritmo genético busca el valor óptimo dentro del rango proporcionado. El tren de calentadores de una central térmica cumple la función de elevar el rendimiento termodinámico del ciclo. Mediante la extracción de vapor procedente de las turbinas del ciclo, se eleva la temperatura del agua de alimentación de la caldera. El aumento de rendimiento se produce al disminuir el consumo de combustible, puesto que la carga del generador de vapor se reduce. Físicamente, el tren de calentadores está compuesto por intercambiadores de calor cerrados y un intercambiador abierto. Se detalla en este proyecto un método de cálculo para resolver un ciclo termodinámico Rankine y obtener el coste de la electricidad de una central térmica. Adicionalmente se dimensionarán los calentadores cerrados que componen el tren de calentadores. Se han estudiado diversas configuraciones del tren de calentadores en centrales térmicas mediante el programa creado. Tras el análisis de las soluciones óptimas, se concluye que es posible mejorar los diseños industriales modernos mediante la modificación de la presión de las extracciones y la temperatura de los calentadores. Aunque las configuraciones existentes hoy en día se acercan a los valores óptimos, mejorar el tren de calentadores puede suponer incrementos de entre el 0. 5 y el 1 % de rendimiento, y disminuciones de entre el 1 y el 2 % del coste. Debe notarse {{sin embargo}} que estos resultados están sujetos a la incertidumbre de las funciones de costes, y a que se deben analizar aspectos adicionales del funcionamiento de una central térmica (como pueden ser los procesos de arranque y operación a carga parcial) para validar los resultados. The {{purpose of this}} project {{is to develop a}} method for the optimization of the feedwater heater train of a subcritical coal power plant. Using a genetic algorithm, the thermodynamic efficiency will be maximized and the cost of electricity minimized. Thus, the mathematical problem becomes a multi-objective optimization. The design of high-performance power stations is a matter of great importance for the electric power industry. Marginal improvements in power plant operations and efficiency can have a substantial impact in the cost of generation. In order to better compete in the evolving electricity markets, utilities are in a constant pursuit of these advances. The set of parameters which determines the efficiency of a coal power plant has several components, such as the number of closed feedwater preheaters, the turbine steam bleed pressures, or the temperatures in the feedwater preheaters. The design trade-offs between increasing the efficiency and decreasing the cost of electricity are a significant challenge for engineers. Due to this trade-offs, the design problem has multiple solutions. To guarantee the validity of the solutions, the technical limitations of the power plant equipment must be always accounted for. The optimization software has been developed using the Matlab environment, which provides the user with a simple method for the implementation of a genetic algorithm, and also includes the tools needed to develop a graphical user interface. The developed software tool allows the user to set the values of the optimization parameters in a simple way, and to choose which parameters shall be fixed or shall be a range. When a range is chosen, the genetic algorithm will search for an optimal value within the range provided. The feedwater heater train fulfills the purpose of increasing the thermodynamic efficiency of the cycle. By means of bleed steam from the turbine, the water heading to the steam generator is heated up. The efficiency rises {{as a consequence of the}} reduced thermal load in the steam generator, which leads to a reduced fuel consumption. The feedwater heater train itself is composed of several closed heat exchangers and one open heat exchanger. In this project, a method to solve a Rankine thermodynamic cycle and calculate the cost of electricity is described. Additionally, the closed feedwater heaters will be dimensioned. Several different feedwater heater train configurations were studied using the developed software. After analysing the results, it is concluded that modern industrial designs can be improved through a combination of modifying the steam <b>bleed</b> <b>pressure</b> and the feedwater heater temperature. Though the configurations used today are close to the optimal values, enhancing the feedwater heater train can lead to increases of between 0. 5 and 1 % in thermodynamic efficiency, and to reductions of between 1 and 2 % in the cost of electricity. However, it should be noticed that these results are subject to uncertainties in the cost functions, and that additional aspects of a power plant operation -such as startup procedures and partial load operation- should be analysed in order to validate the solutions.
