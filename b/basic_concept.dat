5|$|The {{tables were}} {{adopted by the}} Royal Navy in 1908. The Haldane tables of 1906 are {{considered}} to be the first true set of decompression tables, and the <b>basic</b> <b>concept</b> of parallel tissue compartments with half-times and critical supersaturation limits are still in use in several later decompression models, algorithms, tables and decompression computers.|$|E
5|$|The <b>basic</b> <b>concept</b> of Gibanica, a cake or pie {{involving}} {{a combination of}} pastry with cheese in differentiated layers often combined with layers of various other fillings, is common in the cuisines of the Balkans, Anatolia, and the Eastern Mediterranean. For example, a similar dish known as Shabiyat (Sh'abiyat, Shaabiyat) {{is part of the}} cuisine of Syria and Lebanon. Gibanica can also be considered to resemble a type of cheese strudel, with which it likely shares a common ancestry in the pastry dishes of the region, and the cuisines of the Byzantine and Ottoman empires.|$|E
5|$|The system, {{then known}} as RDF 1.5, would require {{a large number of}} {{ground-based}} transmitters to work in an operational setting. Moreover, good reception was only achieved when the target, interceptor, and transmitter were roughly in a line. Due to these limitations, the <b>basic</b> <b>concept</b> was considered unworkable as an operational system, and all effort moved to designs with both the transmitter and receiver in the interceptor aircraft.|$|E

To achieve this objective, a clear understanding of the <b>basic</b> <b>concepts</b> is one prerequisite. This paper makes an effort at clarifying some of the <b>basic</b> <b>concepts</b> independently of standardized or non-standardized formal description techniques. Among the <b>basic</b> <b>concepts</b> considered here are: agent, action, interaction, interaction point, architecture, behaviour, system, composition, refinement, and abstraction. In a case study, it is then shown how these <b>basic</b> <b>concepts</b> can be represented in a formal specification written in temporal logic...|$|R
40|$|Properties of {{the logical}} {{reloading}} in the Euclidean geometry are considered. The logical reloading {{is a logical}} operation which replaces one system of <b>basic</b> <b>concepts</b> of a conception by another system of <b>basic</b> <b>concepts</b> of the same conception. The logical reloading does not change propositions of the conception. However, generalizations of the conception are different for different systems of <b>basic</b> <b>concepts.</b> It is conditioned by the fact, that some systems of <b>basic</b> <b>concepts</b> contain not only propositions of the conception, but also some attributes of this conception description. Properties of the logical reloading are demonstrated in {{the example of the}} proper Euclidean geometry, whose generalization leads to different results for different system of <b>basic</b> <b>concepts.</b> Comment: 15 pages, 0 figures, correction of misprint...|$|R

5|$|With the <b>basic</b> <b>concept</b> proven, {{the team}} then {{looked for a}} {{suitable}} aircraft to carry the receiver. Martlesham provided a Handley Page Heyford bomber, a reversal of duties from the original Daventry Experiment {{that led to the}} development of CH in which a Heyford was the target. One reason for the selection of this design was that its Rolls-Royce Kestrel engines had a well-shielded ignition system which gave off minimal electrical noise.|$|E
5|$|The {{process of}} {{selecting}} appropriate permanent repositories for high level waste and spent fuel {{is now under}} way in several countries with the first expected to be commissioned some time after 2017. The <b>basic</b> <b>concept</b> is to locate a large, stable geologic formation and use mining technology to excavate a tunnel, or large-bore tunnel boring machines (similar to those used to drill the Chunnel from England to France) to drill a shaft 500–1,000 meters below the surface where rooms or vaults can be excavated for disposal of high-level radioactive waste. The goal is to permanently isolate nuclear waste from the human environment. However, many people remain uncomfortable with the immediate stewardship cessation of this disposal system, suggesting perpetual management and monitoring would be more prudent.|$|E
5|$|To {{make the}} new game feel refreshing, only certain {{multiplayer}} elements were retained as the small team took {{the game in}} a different direction. They evaluated {{the core of the}} Rainbow Six series, which they thought was about being a member of a counter-terrorist team traveling around the globe to deal with dangerous terrorist attacks – operations which are usually intense confrontations between attackers and defenders. However, the team wanted to fit these ideas into a multiplayer format which would increase the game's sustainability. These became the <b>basic</b> <b>concept</b> ideas for the game. As the development team hoped that the game can be replayed frequently, the team decided to devote all the resources into developing the game's multiplayer and abandoned the single-player campaign.|$|E

5|$|For an answer, McElroy {{turned to}} the Re-entry Body Identification Group (RBIG), a {{sub-group}} of the Gaither Committee led by William E. Bradley, Jr. that had been studying the issue of penetrating a Soviet ABM system. The RBIG had delivered an extensive report on the topic on 2 April 1958 which suggested that defeating a Soviet ABM system would not be difficult. Their primary suggestion was to arm US missiles {{with more than one}} warhead, a concept known as Multiple Re-entry Vehicles (MRV). Each warhead would also be modified with radiation hardening, ensuring only a near miss could damage it. This would mean that the Soviets would have to launch at least one interceptor for each US warhead, while the US could launch multiple warheads without building a single new missile. If the Soviets added more interceptors to counter the increased number of US warheads, the US could counter this with a smaller number of new missiles of their own. The cost balance was always in favor of the offense. This <b>basic</b> <b>concept</b> would remain the primary argument against ABMs for the next two decades.|$|E
5|$|Holmes {{spent the}} next five years {{gathering}} supporters for his grassroots movement, traveling at his own expense to gather petition signatures from across the state. On January 14, 1855, Holmes went to the state capital of Lansing to lobby the legislature for an agricultural college. He {{spent the next}} four weeks championing the bill he wrote and cementing support in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. Though many legislators supported the <b>basic</b> <b>concept</b> of a state-funded agricultural college, there was strong opposition from University of Michigan president Henry Tappan, who wanted the agriculture program to be part of his school. Nevertheless, Holmes prevailed. On February 12, 1855, Michigan Governor Kinsley S. Bingham signed Act 130, establishing the Agricultural College of the State of Michigan, the school that would become Michigan State University. The final draft of the bill held only two significant differences from the one that Holmes presented: that the purchase price not exceed US $15 per acre, rather than the $25 Holmes desired; and that the site must be within ten miles (16km) of Lansing, a provision added to silence the various factions that wanted the new college built in their own backyards.|$|E
5|$|In {{this book}} I {{maintained}} that a sphere of freedom is still desirable {{even in a}} socialist state, but this sphere has to be defined afresh and not in liberal terms. This doctrine I still hold. The thesis of this book seems to me important, and I hoped that it would attract more attention than it has done. It {{was intended as a}} refutation both of Marx and of the classical economists, not on a point of detail, but on the fundamental assumptions that they shared. I argued that power, rather than wealth, should be the <b>basic</b> <b>concept</b> in social theory, and that social justice should consist in equalisation of power to the greatest practicable degree. It followed that State ownership of land and capital was no advance unless the State was democratic, and even then only if methods were devised for curbing the power of officials. A part of my thesis was taken up and popularised in Burnham's Managerial Revolution, but otherwise the book fell rather flat. I still hold, however, that what it has to say is of very great importance if the evils of totalitarianism are to be avoided, particularly under a Socialist régime.|$|E

5|$|When {{developing}} {{plans for}} Blood-C, {{it was decided}} to shift its setting based on positive feedback from the change of setting between Blood: The Last Vampire and the franchise's first anime series Blood+. The only elements to be retained were the first name of the main character, having a katana as her weapon, and the basic premise of her defeating monsters with that sword. The wish for the project to be distinct from earlier entries was what spurred the collaboration with CLAMP, which became {{a large part of the}} anime's marketing campaign. Fujisaku, when asked in an interview to describe his one creative ambition for the series, said that it was to fully expand and build upon the <b>basic</b> <b>concept</b> established in Blood: The Last Vampire. The choice of a school setting, the first of its kind to be featured in the Blood franchise, was chosen because Mizushima wanted to portray a school life for Saya. When asked, Mizushima did not find the change from his previous comedy anime-based turnout a barrier to his work, but did feel pressure when handling a project within the Blood franchise.|$|E
5|$|Each fusion {{event in}} the D-T fusion reactor gives off an alpha {{particle}} and a fast neutron with around 14MeV of kinetic energy. This is enough energy to cause fission in U-238, and many other transuranic elements as well. This reaction is used in H-bombs to increase the yield of the fusion section by wrapping it in a layer of depleted uranium, which undergoes rapid fission when hit by the neutrons from the fusion bomb inside. The same <b>basic</b> <b>concept</b> {{can also be used}} with a fusion reactor like LIFE, using its neutrons to cause fission in a blanket of fission fuel. Unlike a fission reactor, which burns out its fuel once the U-235 drops below a certain threshold value, these fission–fusion hybrid reactors can continue producing power from the fission fuel as long as the fusion reactor continues to provide neutrons. As the neutrons have high energy, they can potentially cause multiple fission events, leading to the reactor as a whole producing more energy, a concept known as energy multiplication. Even leftover nuclear fuel taken from conventional nuclear reactors will burn in this fashion. This is potentially attractive because this burns off many of the long lived radioisotopes in the process, producing waste that is only mildly radioactive and lacking most long-lived components.|$|E
5|$|On September 7, 2005, the mobile-game {{publisher}} Gameloft {{announced that}} they would bring Meteos and Q Entertainment's other puzzle game, Lumines, to cell phones. The game was released on March 30, 2006, as Meteos Astro Blocks. In 2006, Buena Vista Games announced they would publish four Q Entertainment games, including the then-unannounced Meteos: Disney Magic for the Nintendo DS. A sequel to Meteos, Meteos: Disney Magic, developed by Platinum Egg and Aspect Co., follows Meteos <b>basic</b> <b>concept</b> {{with a number of}} changes—most notably, replacing the game's alien species with Disney characters. The Nintendo DS was held sideways, creating a taller playing field on the touchscreen. Disney characters Mickey Mouse, Jack Sparrow, and Winnie the Pooh are featured in the game, whose plot involves restoring order in the storybook vault after its contents are mysteriously rearranged. A significant change in gameplay was the ability to drag tiles left and right; in Meteos, tiles could only be moved up and down. Meteos: Disney Magic was released in North America on February 22, 2007, and in Europe on June 1. It had a cooler reception than its predecessor, with a score of 74 out of 100 from Metacritic. Phil Theobald, who also reviewed the first Meteos, while enjoying Disney Magic, thought that the lowered difficulty made it less fun.|$|E

5|$|The <b>basic</b> <b>concept</b> of SaGa Frontier {{is based}} on its Free Scenario System, in which one can play as any of seven {{different}} protagonists, all of whom exist in the same setting: a solar system known as The Regions, a group of planets, {{each with its own}} culture, game-level of technology, and form of magic. The game is considered non-linear, in that from the beginning many of the characters are free to go almost anywhere and interact with almost anyone. Travel through most of the Regions is easy due to inter-regional ships traveling regularly between them. The player controls the protagonist on the field screen, a set of interconnecting pre-rendered backgrounds, and is able to speak with a slew of other characters in order to gather information, recruit party members, and initiate quests. Each character has his or her own storyline and a main quest to fulfill, but there are also several optional quests that any of the characters can participate in. Some of the main characters even encounter each other during their quests. The storyline of each character also changes depending on who is chosen, what is said in conversation, what events have already occurred, and who the protagonist has in his or her party, a concept first introduced in Romancing SaGa 2.|$|E
