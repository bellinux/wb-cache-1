5|$|<b>Because</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{pipeline}} {{was built}} above permafrost, {{each of the}} pipes holding up the raised sections of pipeline contained a sealed tube of ammonia. As the permafrost below the pipeline warms, the ammonia absorbs the heat and rises to a radiator {{on top of each}} stanchion. The ammonia is cooled by the outside air, condenses, and falls back {{to the bottom of the}} tube, where the process repeats.|$|E
5|$|During the 1920s, the ACLU's {{primary focus}} was on freedom of speech in general, and speech within the labor {{movement}} particularly. <b>Because</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ACLU's efforts {{were associated with the}} labor movement, the ACLU itself came under heavy attack from conservative groups, such as the American Legion, the National Civic Federation, and Industrial Defense Association and the Allied Patriotic Societies.|$|E
50|$|Bhavni Bhavai {{received}} a wide critical acclaim {{and is considered}} one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> best Gujarati films of all time.

5|$|However, as the Channel Islands lacked {{strategic}} significance, the Allies bypassed {{them when}} they invaded Normandy. As a result, the German garrisons stationed on the islands did not surrender until 9 May 1945—one day after Victory in Europe Day. The garrison on Alderney did not surrender until 16 May. <b>Because</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> German garrisons surrendered peacefully, the Channel Islands are host {{to some of the}} best-preserved Atlantic Wall sites.|$|E
5|$|It has a humid {{subtropical}} climate (Cfa {{according to the}} Köppen climate classification). whose main features are high temperatures and abundant rainfall throughout the year. This year-round rainfall occurs <b>because</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> region lies north of the subtropical high pressure belt even in winter, exposing it to moist easterly winds from the Atlantic Ocean throughout the year. Water deficiencies and extended periods of drought are uncommon, {{and much of the}} region has a positive water balance (i.e. the precipitation exceeds the potential evapotranspiration).|$|E

5|$|<b>Because</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{associated}} convective {{activity was}} {{east of the}} center of circulation, Louisiana and Mississippi received minimal damage. However, on Dauphin Island, Alabama, the storm caused coastal flooding which closed roads and forced the evacuation of residents. Florida received high wind gusts, heavy rainfall, and strong surf that resulted in the deaths of three swimmers. 20,000homes in the state lost electricity. The heavy rainfall progressed into Georgia, where significant flooding occurred. Crop damage was extensive, and about 335 structures were damaged by the flooding. The storm caused a total of about $20million (2002USD; $23.96million 2008USD) in damage.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, a {{team at the}} Carnegie Institute of Washington {{reported}} the most precise measurement of the isotopic signatures of lunar rocks. To their surprise, the team found that the rocks from the Apollo program carried an isotopic signature that was identical with rocks from Earth, and were different from almost all other bodies in the Solar System. <b>Because</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> material that went into orbit to form the Moon was thought to come from Theia, this observation was unexpected. In 2007, researchers from the California Institute of Technology announced that there {{was less than a}} 1% chance that Theia and Earth had identical isotopic signatures. Published in 2012, an analysis of titanium isotopes in Apollo lunar samples showed that the Moon has the same composition as Earth, which conflicts with what is expected if the Moon formed far from Earth's orbit or from Theia. Variations on the giant impact hypothesis may explain this data.|$|E

5|$|In November 2000, Fantasia was {{released}} on video for the second time, this time along with Fantasia 2000, on DVD with 5.1 surround sound. The films were issued both separately and in a three-disc set called The Fantasia Anthology. A variety of bonus features {{were included in the}} bonus disc, The Fantasia Legacy. This edition attempted to follow as closely as possible the runtime and format of the original roadshow version, and included additional restored live-action footage of Taylor and the orchestra, including the bookends to the film's intermission. In the 2000 and 2010 releases, Deems Taylor's voice has been dubbed throughout by Corey Burton <b>because</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> audio tracks to Taylor's restored scenes have been lost.|$|E
5|$|Landscape was a {{secondary}} concern to Netherlandish painters before the mid 1460s. Geographical settings were rare {{and when they}} did appear usually consisted of glimpses through open windows or arcades. They were rarely based on actual locations; the settings tended to be largely imagined, designed to suit the thematic thrust of the panel. <b>Because</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> works were donor portraits, very often the landscapes were tame, controlled and served merely to provide a harmonious setting for the idealised interior space. In this, the northern artists lagged behind their Italian counterparts who were already placing their sitters within geographically identifiable and closely described landscapes. Some of the northern landscapes are highly detailed and notable in their own right, including van Eyck's unsentimental c.1430 Crucifixion and Last Judgement diptych and van der Weyden's widely copied 1435–40 Saint Luke Drawing the Virgin.|$|E
5|$|Lincoln did {{not stay}} long, and soon {{returned}} to Northampton, where {{he passed the}} bar. He established a practice in Worcester in 1775, where his business flourished <b>because</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Worcester lawyers had been Loyalist and had fled to Boston. From 1775 to 1781, he served as {{clerk of the court}} and probate judge of Worcester County, and served the town of Worcester in a variety of posts into the 1790s. He was elected in 1779 to the state convention that drafted the state constitution. During these years, Lincoln rose in prominence {{to become one of the}} largest landowners in Worcester. He was a charter member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1780.|$|E

5|$|On 11 November 1942, Dukovac {{was flying}} his 12th mission, escorting Junkers Ju 87 Stuka dive bombers to Lazarevskoye. During the mission {{he and his}} {{companion}} were intercepted by Polikarpov I-16 Rata fighters, and Dubovac downed one of the attackers over the city of Tuapse to register his first confirmed aerial victory. Dukovac was unable to build upon his success at this time, as four days later the whole Staffel rotated back to the NDH <b>because</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> personnel had endured a year of constant combat. The men of 15./JG 52 had a break of three months, commencing their return journey on 12 February 1943, collecting their aircraft at Kraków in German-occupied Poland on 18 February then flying to Lvov. They flew on to Nikolayev on 21 February. The Eastern Front had changed significantly during their absence, with the strategic initiative passing to the Soviets.|$|E
5|$|The {{early stages}} of the {{organization}} were characterized by a focus on Marxist–Leninist ideology. The CPC viewed the women’s movement {{as a part of the}} larger Chinese revolution against the feudal past, but some leaders in the CPC argued that <b>because</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> women continued to do domestic work, and did not actively participate in the revolution, this contradicted the Marxist–Leninist ideology. The ACWF contested this assertion, stating that the economic conditions were not at the point where jobs could be provided to all women. Therefore, housekeepers, wives and mothers who were dedicated to their work could indeed be seen as contributing to socialism.|$|E
5|$|The film's {{director}} is unknown, {{but it may}} have been Barry O'Neil or Lucius J. Henderson. Credit is sometimes given to Theodore Marston, an error that apparently originates with the American Film-Index 1908–1915. Film historian Q. David Bowers consulted one of the co-authors of the book, Gunnar Lundquist, and confirmed that the credit of Marston as director was in error. Marston worked with Pathé, Kinemacolor, Vitagraph and other companies, but there is no record of him working with Thanhouser. This error has persisted in several works including The Complete Index to Literary Sources in Film. Cameramen employed by the company at the time the film was made include Blair Smith, Carl Louis Gregory and Alfred H. Moses, Jr., but the role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions. This production is unique for having the cast members known, <b>because</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> credits in Thanhouser's 1910 productions are fragmentary.|$|E

5|$|The loss of {{the weight}} of the gas taken from the {{cylinder}} makes the cylinder and diver more buoyant. This can be a problem if the diver is unable to remain neutrally buoyant {{towards the end of the}} dive <b>because</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gas has been breathed from the cylinder. The buoyancy change due to gas usage from back mounted cylinders is easily compensated by carrying sufficient diving weights to provide neutral buoyancy with empty cylinders at the end of a dive, and using the buoyancy compensator to neutralise the excess weight until the gas has been used.|$|E
5|$|The {{other main}} sources of {{information}} are maps, particularly those published {{at the time the}} canal was to be converted into a railway. These clearly show twin-track inclines at Capel Ifan and Pont Henry, and <b>because</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> traffic was in the downhill direction, a simple counterbalanced system was probably employed, although it has also been suggested that the barge may have been balanced by a water tank on the second track to more easily control the speed of descent. The Hirwaunissa incline was longer and narrower than the other two, and only included a single track. Recent research has suggested that the incline was powered by a water wheel, with the waste water running down the incline in a side channel, in order to supply the lower levels of the canal.|$|E
