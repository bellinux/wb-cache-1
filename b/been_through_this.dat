Gone were the tenders proclaiming the railway companies' logos, emblems and even coats of arms, {{to be replaced by}} the stark 'BRITISH RAILWAYS' lettering. The enormity of this task meant that the necessary repainting was not necessarily carried out to coincide with an overall repaint. For the Coronation Class, all locomotives had <b>been</b> <b>through</b> <b>this</b> process by the end of 1948 except for Nos. 6223, 6238, 6248, 6250, and 6252–6255, a total of 29 locomotives. Only thirteen locomotives out of the 29 received new liveries to accompany their renumbering.|$|E

[...] "Kat is understandably very nervous and anxious about having another baby. Her head is all over the place. But before she has a chance {{to get used to the}} idea she suffers a miscarriage.

[...] Michele also stated, [...] "I didn't want to find songs that I had to change myself for. I wanted to find songs that would only highlight my sound and were unique to me. I didn't want to fit any mold. I wanted it to be something that couldn't be replicated by anyone else. It was important to me that the album began with [...] "Cannonball" [...] and ended with [...] "If You Say So". I have to acknowledge what I've <b>been</b> <b>through</b> <b>this</b> year. It was really difficult, which I think is represented in [...] "If You Say So" [...] and a song like [...] "Cannonball" [...] represents finding strength and hope. These are the two sides of my life right now. The grief, but also the search for strength and hope. I really wanted those two songs to bookend the album.
