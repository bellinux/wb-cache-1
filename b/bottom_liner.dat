40|$|A {{laboratory}} {{investigation was}} conducted {{to determine the effects}} of temperature and moisture on the shear strength of textured geomembrane (T-GM) and geosynthetic clay liner (GCL) interface. Several landfill slope failures involving geosynthetics have occurred within the past three decades. Interface shear strength of T-GM/GCL is well documented for testing conducted at laboratory temperatures and at moisture contents associated with GCLs in submerged conditions. However, in-service conditions for landfill liner systems include a wide range of temperatures (extending from below 0 °C to above 40 °C) and a wide range of moisture conditions. Large-scale interface direct shear tests were performed at normal stresses of cover liners (10, 20, and 30 kPa) and bottom liners (100, 200, and 300 kPa). Cover liner specimens were subjected to temperatures of 2, 20 and 40 °C; and <b>bottom</b> <b>liner</b> specimens were subjected to temperatures of 20 and 40 °C. Both cover and <b>bottom</b> <b>liner</b> specimens were prepared at moisture contents of as-received (approx. 18 - 19 %), 50 %, and 100 %. Cover liner specimens exhibited decreased peak interface shear strength (tp) with increasing temperature. Specimens sheared at 2 °C exhibited greater tp than those sheared at 20 °C by as much as 27 %. Specimens sheared at 20 °C exhibited greater tp than those sheared at 40 °C by as much as 16 %. Large-displacement interface shear strength (tld) generally exhibited a bell-shaped relationship with increasing temperature with the greatest tld at 20 °C. A bell-shaped relationship was exhibited between temperature and peak and large-displacement interface friction angle (dp and dld). dp ranged from 17. 4 to 26. 3 °, 23. 8 to 29 °, and 20. 4 to 22. 2 ° for 2, 20, and 40 °C, respectively. dld ranged from 12. 7 to 18. 2 °, 18. 2 to 20. 6 °, and 15. 9 to 16. 7 ° for 2, 20, and 40 °C, respectively. Decreased d at 2 and 40 °C were largely attributed to increased geosynthetic damage. <b>Bottom</b> <b>liner</b> specimens exhibited decreased tp and tld with increasing temperature by up to 12 % and 16 %, respectively. <b>Bottom</b> <b>liner</b> specimens exhibited decreased tp and tld with increasing moisture content by up to 14 % and 36 %, respectively. For <b>bottom</b> <b>liner</b> specimens, a trend of decreased dp with increased temperatures was exhibited. dp ranged from 20 to 24. 7 ° and 19. 5 to 22. 2 ° for 20 °C and 40 °C, respectively. dld ranged from 10. 4 to 15. 6 ° and 8. 9 to 13. 9 ° for 20 °C and 40 °C, respectively. Decreased d at 40 °C was largely attributed to increased geosynthetic damage and increased bentonite extrusion. Increased moisture content resulted in decreased dp and dld by up to 4. 7 and 5. 1 °, respectively. Results of this testing program indicated that T-GM/GCL interface shear strengths are influenced by temperature and moisture content within ranges representative of field conditions. Interpolation factors and reduction factors were developed for use to avoid overestimation of d when determined at standard laboratory temperatures. For cover liners, reduction factors of 0. 8 and 0. 85 are recommended for dp and dld, respectively. For bottom liners, reduction factors of 0. 9 and 0. 85 are recommended for dp and dld, respectively...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Composite liners, {{consisting}} of a geomembrane overlying a soil liner, are often required as <b>bottom</b> <b>liners</b> for waste containment systems. In many applica-tions, regulations prescribe the type of liner that must be installed. However, regula-tions often have provisions that permit an alternative liner design, provided that the alternative liner is equivalent to, or as effective as, the prescriptive liner. The current approach for demonstrating equivalency is based on comparing leakage rates for the alternative and prescriptive liners. This approach is too simplistic because leakage rate is not always indicative {{of the mass of}} contaminants discharged from the liner. In this paper, practical equations are presented for predicting the discharge of contaminants from composite liners and for designing alternative liners. The equations can be imple-mented using hand-held calculators or computer spreadsheet applications. Some of these equations are shown to provide predictions of mass flux and contaminant break-through that are similar to predictions made with more complex one- and three-dimen-sional numerical models for composite liners having perfect contact, circular defects,...|$|R

40|$|The {{applicability}} of bentonite as a lining material for isolation of waste disposal sites was investigated on laboratory and field scale. The permeability of sand-bento-nite mixtures {{depends on the}} type of bentonite, the bentonite content in the mixture and the dry bulk density. In laboratory experiments the saturated conductivity decreased at low hydraulic head gradients, indicating that water flow in these mix-tures does not obey Darcy’s law. The swelling of the bentonite, which is responsible for the low permeability, is a time-dependent process. The permeability decreased with time and even after two months the permeability had not reached a constant level. In sand-bentonite mixtures with 5 % (w/w) bentonite, the saturated conduc-tivity ultimately reached a level below 1 x 10 - 10 m s- 1, which is sufficiently low for surface capping of waste disposal sites. The sand-bentonite mixtures were 10 - 100 times more permeable for landfill leachate than for clean water. <b>Bottom</b> <b>liners</b> should, therefore, contain considerably more bentonite to prevent infiltration of leachate in the subsoil.

40|$|When {{geosynthetic}} clay liners (GCLs) {{are applied}} as <b>bottom</b> <b>liners</b> at waste containment facilities, they are naturally prehydrated by absorbing {{moisture in the}} underlying base layers. In order to evaluate the effects of cations contained in waste leachates, this study investigated {{the effects of the}} water content distribution of the GCLs prehydrated with actual soils on their hydraulic conductivities against CaCl 2 solutions. The "prehydration tests", which were conducted prior to the hydraulic conductivity tests, showed that the water content distribution of the prehydrated GCLs depends on the properties of the GCLs and the base layers. In particular, drastic differences between GCLs with powdered ben-tonite and GCLs with granular bentonite were observed in the prehydration water content and its distribution. Prehydrated GCLs with powdered bentonite had a higher water content and a more homogenous distribution than those with granular bentonite. The hydraulic conductivity tests showed that most of the prehydrated GCLs exhibit a low hydraulic conductivity of k ≈ 1. 0 x 10 - 8 cm/s against CaCl 2 solutions with 0. 1 - 0. 5 M. However, GCLs with granular bentonite may be difficult to homogeneously prehydrate and exhibit an unstable hydraulic conductivity, which varies from A: = 2. 9 x 10 - 9 cm/s to k= 1. 5 x 10 - 6 cm/s.

Researches towards the effective incorporation of wastes as cement blenders and enhancers with environmental friendly impacts are increasing. This paper channeled the utilization of commercially available industrial waste- Fly ash (FA) in South Africa towards the modification and improvement of kaolinitic clay sampled from a disposal site. One-dimensional consolidation tests were conducted to investigate the effect of integrating varied proportions of FA on the compressibility behavioral patterns of a parent compressible landfill material. Compacted specimens were modified at optimum water content (OWC) and maximum dry unit weight (MDUW) by the incorporation of an industrial waste material to the parent soil.

40|$|ABSTRACT Geosynthetic clay liners (GCLs) are {{increasingly}} used in <b>bottom</b> <b>liners</b> for landfills {{because of their}} low hydraulic conductivity to water and ease of installation. The evaluation of GCL performances as pollutant barriers needs an adequate theoretical approach for modeling the simultaneous migration of water and solutes through bentonite. Bentonite is a clay soil containing typically at least 70 % of the three layered (2 : 1) clay mineral montmorillonite, which {{is characterized by a}} very high total specific surface and a negative electric charge. The ultra-fine pore size (< 100 Å) of this clay soil and the electric interaction between montmorillonite particles and ions in pore solution determine macroscopic phenomena that can not be modeled {{on the basis of the}} advective-diffusive transport theory, normally used to describe the movement of water and solutes through porous media. Therefore, the equations that describe the macroscopic transport of a solution containing a binary electrolyte through a semi-permeable membrane are derived following the approach of the Thermodynamics of Irreversible Processes. This approach for the description of the macroscopic transport of the solution does not provide any physical interpretation of the phenomena involved. In order to provide a physical interpretation of the phenomenological parameters, a complementary macroscopic transport model is also proposed. Such a model is able to explain the dependency, observed in laboratory experiments, of the chemico-osmotic efficiency coefficient on the solute concentration and the bentonite porosity. A comparison between GCLs and compacted clay liners is presented accounting for semi-permeable membrane behavior, which is shown to play a relevant role at low salt concentration...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{gathered}} available {{flow and}} transport solutions {{and used them}} for two composite liners, consisting of geomembrane (GM) overlying either a compacted clay liner (CCL) or a geosynthetic clay liner (GCL). Its aim {{is to provide a}} guiding framework for the possible choices of (a) approaches to <b>bottom</b> <b>liner</b> design, (b) respective analytical solutions to flow and transport equations, as well as (c) parameters required for each type of solution. On the basis of the obtained results, the following recommendations are made. When the goal of analysis is to determine material equivalency, leachate flow rate is an adequate key parameter for GM-CCL composite liners. For GM-GCL composite liners, it is necessary to compute contaminant concentration or mass flux, considering (a) transport through defects for inorganic contaminants and (b) diffusion and the contribution of any available attenuation layer for organic contaminants. When the goal of analysis is to assess impact to groundwater, it is advised to calculate both discharge rate and contaminant mass flux regardless of liner type.

40|$|Uncontrolled {{leachate}} {{emissions are}} one of the key factors in the environmental impact of municipal solid waste (MSW) landfills. The concentration of ammonium, given the anaerobic conditions in traditional landfills, can remain significantly high for a very long period of time, as degradation does not take place and volatilisation is not significant (the pH is not high enough to considerably shift the equilibrium towards un-ionised ammonia). Recent years have witnessed a continuous enhancement of landfill technology in order to minimize uncontrolled emissions into the environment; bottom lining systems have been improved and more attention has been devoted {{to the study of the}} attenuation of the different chemicals in leachate in case of migration through the mineral barrier. Different natural materials have been considered for use as components of landfill liners in the last years and tested in order to evaluate the performance of the different alternatives. Among those materials, bentonite is often used, coupled with other materials in two different ways: in addition to in situ soil or in geocomposite clay liner (GCL). A lab-scale test was carried out in order to further investigate the influence of bentonite on the attenuation of ammonium in leachate passing through a landfill liner. Two different tests were conducted: a standardized batch test with pulverized bentonite and a batch test with compacted bentonite. The latter was proposed in order to better simulate the real conditions in a landfill liner. The two tests produced values for the partition coefficient K-d higher than the average measured for other natural materials usually utilized as components of landfill liners. Moreover, the two tests showed similar results, thus providing a further validation of the suitability of the standard batch test with pulverized bentonite. A thorough knowledge of attenuation processes of ammonium in landfill liners is the basis for the application of risk analysis models for the evaluation of the failure of <b>bottom</b> <b>liners</b> or their components...|$|R
40|$|The most {{important}} trends in landfill management policy {{over the last}} decade have been the universal adoption of the containment approach to emission control and the increasing legal requirement to install artificial membranes as <b>bottom</b> <b>liners</b> and caps to landfills which is now mandatory in many countries. The landfill cover is one of the {{most important}} aspects when designing and constructing landfills. The cover should minimize the quantity of water that infiltrates to the body of the solid waste landfills, reduce the rate of leachate generation, segregate solid waste from the surrounding environment, and control the risk of additional groundwater contamination and gas migration. Landfill covers are not standardized. Different covers have been proposed and executed all over the world. The selection of the suitable cover type is a big challenge especially in arid and semi-arid countries. Jordan is considered to be a semi-arid country. In Jordan, more than 20 landfills are in operation. Landfilling practiced in Jordan is generally dumping the waste in trenches with leveling and compacting by trash compactors to reduce the size and the thickness of the layers, and finally covering the waste with 0. 5 m from the landfill soil in daily basis. This cover usually ends to be the cap during landfill working time and sometimes after closing. To assess the efficiency of a certain cover with particular concentration on landfills in arid and semi-arid areas, many field studies should be adopted along an extensive time period, confirming the efficiency of the landfill cover. Cost, time, and labor demands are still the major obstacles for conducting such field studies. Other methods should be considered for evaluation of the landfill cover efficiency and also supporting correct evaluation of the performance of landfill covers. Numerical simulation with appropriate soil parameters is an inexpensive, fast, and labor saved tool for modeling water flow and solute transport in saturated and unsaturated media...|$|R
40|$|The <b>bottom</b> <b>liners</b> in the {{municipal}} landfill sites {{are expected to}} prevent the migration of pollutants (leachate) to the groundwater. Different types of liner materials are {{being used in the}} construction of liners of municipal landfills over the world. Compared to the liner materials such as Geosynthetic Clay Liners (GCL) and High Density Polyethythene (HDPE), Compacted Clay Liners (CCL) are more economical, if materials are locally available. Different types of clay have been experimented for their suitability as liner materials in many countries. An expansive soil however, having a high plasticity index can be expected to absorb more volume of water emanating from the leachate and as a result it can withstand longer dry periods before cracks develop. Further, even if cracks do develop during a prolonged dry period, the cracks may self heal with the subsequent exposure to a rainy period as the shrink-swell behavior of expansive soils is reversible. Therefore, in this study, the suitability of a locally available expansive soils in which the major clay mineral is montmorillonite was investigated for use in landfill liners. For this purpose expansive soils obtained from Digana and Moragahakanda areas of Sri Lanka were chosen as candidate soils. The Rowe Cell apparatus was used to measure the hydraulic conductivity of the consolidated soil sample using de-aired water as the permeant liquid. The results showed that for all the test specimens hydraulic conductivity was less than 1 x 10 - 9 m/s conforming to the requirements of maximum hydraulic conductivity recommended for liner materials. Similar tests were performed on expansive soils obtained from Moragahakanda amended by the addition of 5 % bentonite (Sodium Bentonite). Addition of bentonite resulted in a decrease of hydraulic conductivity by a significant amount. Therefore, it can be concluded that subjected to the satisfaction of durability criteria the expansive soils of Digana and Moragahakanda are suitable as liner materials and have the potential to be incorporated into a relatively thin liner by amending with bentonite...|$|R
