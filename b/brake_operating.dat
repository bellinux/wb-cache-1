5|$|The {{locomotives}} received transformers in 1947, {{which were}} installed in Oslo, and 2064 was delivered on 24 May. The {{cost of the}} three locomotives was 1,297,905 million Norwegian krone. At first, only one unit was transferred to Flåm. The other two remained in Eastern Norway; one was stationed as a shunter at Oslo West Station, the other in Skien. The units operating in Oslo and Skien had problems with the rheostatic <b>brake</b> <b>operating</b> differently depending on the direction the train was running, something which was not observed in Flåm. The issue was fixed by marginally changing the excitation voltage. The unit stationed in Flåm was periodically sent for service in Oslo, and when this happened, a new unit would be stationed in Flåm. From 21 January 1949, 2064 was returned to Flåm without the other unit being sent back. From 17 February 1955, all three were stationed in Flåm. During the late 1950s, one of the units was stationed as Voss Station for shunting duty. Starting in the late 1950s, the class was also used on the Hardanger Line.|$|E
50|$|The {{braking system}} {{consisted}} of a hand-powered spindle <b>brake</b> <b>operating</b> on the tender axles, and a Hardy-type vacuum <b>brake</b> <b>operating</b> on {{the first and third}} coupled axles and both tender axles. For service on the inclined sections, a supplementary counter-pressure brake of Riggenbach type was fitted.|$|E

50|$|The {{hydraulically}} controlled drum <b>brakes</b> <b>operated</b> on {{all four}} wheels while the hand <b>brake</b> <b>operated</b> via a cable linkage to the rear wheels. Steering was of the then common worm and roller type.|$|R
25|$|All {{powered axles}} have clasp <b>brakes</b> <b>operating</b> {{on the wheel}} tread.|$|R
50|$|The car {{sat on a}} U-profile {{pressed steel}} chassis with rigid axles and semi-elliptical leaf springing. It came as a P6 version with a six-seater open-topped body or as a P11, {{featuring}} a more sporty open-topped four-seater body. The mechanically linked foot <b>brake</b> <b>operated</b> on the drive shaft, while the hand <b>brake</b> <b>operated</b> directly against the rear wheels.|$|R
50|$|The Massif has {{all round}} disc brakes with {{ventilated}} discs {{on the front}} axle and simple discs on the rear axle. The hand brake is also a disc <b>brake,</b> <b>operating</b> on the transmission.|$|E
50|$|Early {{motorcycles}} {{which were}} essentially a bicycle with a motor attached {{and did not}} have any braking system beyond slowing the motorcycle down and putting a foot out. One of the first motorcycles to have any sort of braking mechanism was made by Steffey Motorcycles of Philadelphia in 1902. This used a spoon <b>brake</b> <b>operating</b> on the front wheel only. Around 1909 band brakes were introduced, these used a band contracting round the outside of a drum.|$|E
50|$|The brakes would {{probably}} not seem inadequate {{in the world of}} 1914. The foot <b>brake</b> <b>operating</b> on the transmission is exceedingly powerful but gets very hot and needs regular adjustment to maintain effectiveness. The handbrake on the rear wheels can be used for long descents but the drums are too small to provide dramatic stopping power. Front brakes would make a big difference but in 1914 front brakes were still {{the exception rather than the}} rule.|$|E
5000|$|Hand <b>brake</b> <b>operated</b> {{shoes in}} a brake drum mounted {{at the back}} of the gearbox ...|$|R
50|$|Brakes: Foot <b>brake</b> <b>operates</b> on transmission. Hand brake is a {{conventional}} drum brake {{on the rear}} wheels only.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the same}} year the {{manufacturer}} announced a more powerful engine, unchanged in size, but now providing [...] of power at 1,750 rpm. [...] Unusually at this time the four cylinders were in a single block formed from a single casting, rather than being set {{in a pair of}} two twin-cylinder blocks. The mechanically controlled <b>brakes</b> <b>operated</b> on the drive shaft until 1925 when the braking system was reconfigured and the <b>brakes</b> <b>operated</b> on all four wheels.|$|R
50|$|The Palmerston had a 6-9 hp Coventry-Victor water cooled, flat {{twin engine}} driving {{the rear wheels}} through a cone clutch, {{separately}} mounted three speed gearbox and bevel geared rear axle. The brakes acted on the rear wheels using a hand lever with the foot <b>brake</b> <b>operating</b> a transmission brake on the drive shaft behind the gearbox. The steel section chassis had quarter elliptic leaf springs front and rear. The early cars had wire spoked wheels later replaced by steel disc type.|$|E
50|$|The Light 20 has a {{top speed}} of 50 mph (52 mph on the TT versions) and the Heavy 20 47 mph. This speed would be reduced if a heavy body was fitted. There is a {{transmission}} <b>brake</b> <b>operating</b> on a drum fitted behind the gearbox operated by foot pedal and internal expanding drum brakes on the back axle operated by the handbrake lever. Suspension is by semi-elliptic leaf springs on both front and rear axles with an additional crossways helper spring on the rear. Artillery type wheels with wooden spokes were fitted.|$|E
50|$|The car has a {{top speed}} of 55 mph. There is a {{transmission}} <b>brake</b> <b>operating</b> on a 12.5 in drum fitted behind the gearbox operated by foot pedal and internal expanding 12 in drum brakes on the back axle operated by the handbrake lever. Suspension is by semi-elliptic leaf springs on both front and rear axles with an additional crossways helper spring on the rear. The axle is located by a triangular strut linking axle and chassis and the main drive thrust is transmitted to the car by links between the ends of the axle and forward spring brackets. By this means the springs are only responsible for suspension. Artillery type wheels with wooden spokes were fitted.|$|E

50|$|The drum <b>brakes</b> <b>operated</b> on {{all four}} wheels. Suspension was traditional, {{involving}} rigid axles front and back with semi-elliptic leaf springs and “friction dampers”.|$|R
5000|$|The {{front wheels}} were {{suspended}} using a transversely mounted leaf-spring, combined with [...] "friction shock-absorbers". [...] The <b>brakes</b> <b>operated</b> {{only on the}} rear wheels.|$|R
50|$|The Premier cyclecar was {{launched}} in 1912. Described at the 1912 Motor Cycle and Cycle Car Show as 'a smart looking two-seater vehicle with coachwork torpedo-type body at 100 guineas'. The engine was a 998 cc air-cooled V-twin (85mm bore, 88mm stroke) with special heavy flywheel for cyclecar work and Bosch magneto. The transmission included a leather cone clutch and two speed gearbox (with reverse), and the rear axle included a differential, there was enclosed chain drive throughout. The chassis was of 'tubular trussed construction' with half elliptic front springing and quarter elliptic rear. The brakes comprised a foot operated band <b>brake</b> <b>operating</b> on the transmission countershaft, and two internally expanding brakes on the rear axle operated by the hand brake lever.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{the advent}} of the Prussian T 20 (DRG Class 95) in 1922 with its 1'E1' axle {{arrangement}} and better qualities than the initial Gt 2x4/4 series, a second series was built and deployed between 1922 (no. 5766) and 1923 (nos. 5767-5775). They were improved in comparison with their predecessors: greater evaporative heating area, capable of holding half a ton of coal more, greater axle load and service weight, short chimney (without a cap). Both series were later modified in different ways after being taken over by the Deutsche Reichsbahn, and incorporated into its classification scheme as Class 960. All locomotives were equipped with a Westinghouse compressed-air double <b>brake,</b> <b>operating</b> on all wheelsets from the front, the sand pipes initially served the second and fourth wheelsets of the front drive. After the modification of the second series in 1926, they were additionally fitted with a Riggenbach counter-pressure brake, and seven axles sanded to increase adhesion. To begin with the locos ran with three headlights at the front, but just two after 1926.|$|E
50|$|The {{system of}} {{automatic}} train operation developed for the Victoria line, and hence the 1967 Stock, used two types of coded signals, which were fed into the running rails, and pickup up by two independent sets of coils on the train. The first was the safety signalling system, which used a continuous signal encoded at 125 Hz. This was used to pass codes at 420, 270 or 180 pulses per minute (ppm) to the control circuits. Failure to receive any of these codes resulted in the emergency <b>brake</b> <b>operating.</b> 180 ppm allowed the train to operate at speeds up to 25 mph but did not allow power to be applied if it had previously been shut off. 270 ppm allowed the train to operate up to the same speed, but power could also be re-applied if it had previously been shut off. Finally, 420 ppm allowed the train to run at the speeds set by the driving command system, which was {{the second of the}} two coded message systems.|$|E
50|$|The {{suspension}} configuration {{followed the}} conventions of the time, using rigid beam axles and semi-elliptic leaf springs. <b>Braking</b> <b>operated</b> on all four wheels using a cable linkage.|$|R
50|$|BMW Motorrad uses {{a system}} called Integral ABS, {{in which the}} front <b>brake</b> lever <b>operates</b> both {{the front and rear}} brakes, while the <b>brake</b> pedal <b>operates</b> only the rear brake. In the inverse, Honda's system that {{features}} both combined brakes and anti-lock brakes is dubbed Combined ABS. In this system, the rear <b>brake</b> pedal <b>operates</b> both front and rear brake, and the front <b>brake</b> lever <b>operates</b> the front calipers, which in turn activates a secondary master cylinder to engage the rear brake. ABS modulators are installed on both the front and rear wheel.|$|R
5000|$|The {{brake and}} other pedals are {{independent}} of the frame. Beneath the floor boards there is a hand wheel for primary adjustment of the 4-wheel brakes which have enclosed brake drums. The hand <b>brake</b> <b>operates</b> separate shoes in the rear drums and may be adjusted {{from the top of}} the lever. The rear <b>brakes</b> are <b>operated</b> by a single cable which gives compensation and an even pressure to each rear wheel and the front <b>brakes</b> are <b>operated</b> by pull-rods. Unusually for this period and price range there is a brake servo motor in the bottom of the gearbox.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the design of}} control, measurement and power electronics department for dynamic loading of electronically commutated motors with electric brakes. After comparing {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of possible conceptions the proposal focuses on electric <b>brake</b> <b>operating</b> in generator mode and the value of load is controlled by the current dissipated in a dummy load...|$|E
40|$|Brakes squeal {{remains an}} elusive {{problem in the}} {{automotive}} industry. There have been many proposals proposed to tackle these problems but very few are effective to suppress and eliminate it. This paper proposes a solution to suppress disc brake using the finite element method. First a three dimensional finite element (FE) model of a real disc brake assembly is developed and validated. Then, complex eigenvalue analysis made available in commercial FE software package is performed to determine stability of the brake system where positive real parts of the complex eigenvalue indicate unstable system and in turn exhibit squeal generation in the brake assembly. Then, various disc modifications are proposed to reduce the brake squeal. A good modification {{should be able to}} reduce and eliminate squeal at various <b>brake</b> <b>operating</b> condition...|$|E
50|$|The Görlitz weight brake (Görlitzer Gewichtsbremse), a form {{of cable}} <b>brake,</b> <b>operates</b> {{in a similar way}} to the Heberlein brake, but differs {{markedly}} in its design details, as does the Schmid continuous spiral-toothed gear brake.|$|R
50|$|The new Rover 12 {{was first}} {{displayed}} at the November 1911 Olympia Motor Show as a 4-cylinder supplement to the 2-cylinder sleeve valve cars. It was designed by Owen Clegg who had joined Rover from Wolseley. It had a four-cylinder, water-cooled, side-valve engine of 2297 cc with an SU carburettor made by Rover under licence. Around 5000 were made before World War I. The transmission was three-speed, separate from the engine, and drove the rear axle which had a worm drive. Semi elliptic leaf springs were fitted front and rear. Rear wheel <b>brakes,</b> <b>operated</b> by the hand lever were fitted, with a transmission <b>brake</b> <b>operated</b> by the foot pedal.|$|R
40|$|As an {{important}} device {{of the aircraft}} landing system, the antilock braking system (ABS) has a function to avoid aircraft wheels self-locking. To deal with the strong nonlinear characteristics, complex nonlinear control schemes are applied in ABS. However, none of existing control schemes focus on the <b>braking</b> <b>operating</b> status, which directly reflects wheels self-locking degree. In this paper, the <b>braking</b> <b>operating</b> status region {{is divided into three}} regions: the healthy region, the light slip region, and the deep slip region. An ABLF-based wheel slip controller is proposed for ABS to constrain the <b>braking</b> system <b>operating</b> status in the healthy region and the light slip region. Therefore the ABS will be prevented from operating in the deep slip region. Under the proposed control scheme, self-locking is avoided completely and zero steady state error tracking of the wheel optimal slip ratio is implemented. The Hardware-In-Loop (HIL) experiments have validated the effectiveness of the proposed controller...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the effects of}} brake lining thickness due to wear on drum brake squeal. Brake lining will be worn out and subsequently its thickness will be reduced after a few number of braking applications. Hence dynamic properties of the lining, such as its natural frequency, might be changed. In this work, two different sets of brake lining, i. e., new and worn lining are used to investigate its effect on squeal generation. First, modal testing is performed to determine natural frequencies of those brake linings at free-free boundary condition. Later, squeal tests are carried out using brake dynamometer and squeal frequency is measured up to 10 kHz. Several squeal results are plotted over <b>brake</b> <b>operating</b> conditions to observe the influence of different lining thickness. In addition to these, squeal mechanisms, i. e., modal coupling due to closeness of the natural frequency between drum brake components and negative damping due to negative friction-velocity slope {{that contribute to the}} squeal generation are also investigated and discussed...|$|E
50|$|The car {{sat on a}} U-profile {{pressed steel}} chassis with rigid axles and semi-eliptical leaf springing. It was offered only as a four-door sedan/saloon. The {{mechanically}} linked foot <b>brake</b> <b>operated</b> directly on all four wheels, while the handbrake operated on the rear wheels.|$|R
5000|$|A skilled driver {{can control}} the {{movement}} of the car even while skidding by steering, throttling and pulling the hand brake (given that the hand <b>brake</b> <b>operates</b> the rear wheels as in most cases, with some Citroen and Saab models being notable exceptions).|$|R
50|$|The MB.141 had a fixed {{tail wheel}} {{undercarriage}} with a track of 2.80 m; its main wheels were mounted on vertical, faired oleo struts and had <b>brakes</b> <b>operated</b> by a lever {{on the control}} column. Its small, castoring tail wheel also had a shock absorber.|$|R
50|$|Power was {{transmitted}} to the rear wheels via a single dry-plate clutch and a four-speed all-synchromesh gear box, controlled using a conventional floor mount gear lever. There were 200 mm brake drums on all four wheels: <b>braking</b> <b>operated</b> via a single circuit hydraulic system.|$|R
