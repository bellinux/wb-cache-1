5|$|The {{only other}} {{significant}} human impact {{is a small}} prefabricated hut which is used by researchers while staying on the island. The hut includes a few <b>bunk</b> <b>beds</b> and a solar power source to drive an emergency radio and other key electronics. All visitors check themselves and belongings to ensure no seeds are accidentally introduced by humans to this ecosystem. It is believed that some young boys tried to introduce potatoes, which were promptly dug up once discovered. An improperly handled human defecation resulted in a tomato plant taking root which was also destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Twenty-one cabins {{can be used}} by {{visitors}} at Black Moshannon State Park. Thirteen are rustic cabins, built by the CCC, with electric lights, a kitchen stove and a wood-burning stove, refrigerator, and <b>bunk</b> <b>beds.</b> Six are modern cabins, including the former ski lodge, with electric heat, a bedroom, living room, kitchen, and bath. There are also two deluxe camping cottages with electric heat and similar amenities as the rustic cabins. All cabin renters need to bring their own household items such as linens and cookware. Pets are prohibited in all cabins in the park.|$|E

5|$|The Beatles first {{played a}} full show with Best on 17 August 1960 at the Indra club in Hamburg, {{and the group}} slept in the Bambi Kino cinema in a small, dirty room with <b>bunk</b> <b>beds,</b> a cold and noisy former {{storeroom}} directly behind the screen. Upon first seeing the Indra, where they were booked to play, Best remembered it as a depressing place filled with a few tourists, and having heavy, old, red curtains that made it seem shabby compared to the larger Kaiserkeller. As Best {{had been the only}} group member to study O-Level German at school, he could talk with the club's owner, Bruno Koschmider, and the clientele. After the Indra closed due to complaints about the noise, the group started a residency in the Kaiserkeller.|$|E
5|$|During the {{construction}} of residential housing and other buildings on the site in 1988–89, several underground sections of the bunker complex were uncovered by work crews. In April 1988, the East German government allowed several visits to the site by photo-journalists. Water was pumped out of the Vorbunker for four days before access could be made via the underground passageway which led from the Chancellery. The interior floor of the Vorbunker {{was covered with a}} muddy sludge from having been underwater for so many years. Old empty wine bottles were found {{on the floor of the}} kitchen and wine store room. Still present in the room next to the kitchen were the broken frames of the <b>bunk</b> <b>beds</b> used by the Goebbels children. At the end of the hallway were the stairs leading down to the Führerbunker. However, the men could go no further than the mid-landing, as the Führerbunker was still underwater and the ceiling beyond the doorway had collapsed due to the demolitions performed in 1947. After these inspections, work crews for the most part removed and destroyed the bunker complex. The Vorbunkers top and external walls were the first structures to be torn down. The construction of buildings in the area around the complex was a strategy for ensuring the surroundings remained anonymous and unremarkable. The emergency exit point for the Führerbunker (which had been in the Chancellery gardens) was occupied by a car park.|$|E
25|$|After {{some time}} {{access to the}} school study centre based in the station house was {{negotiated}} (when {{it was not in}} use); this provided relative luxury – <b>bunk</b> <b>beds</b> (in the old waiting room) and proper washing and cooking facilities (an old Rayburn stove).|$|E

25|$|The {{campground}} has 262 {{sites for}} tent or trailer camping. 149 {{of these sites}} have an electrical connections. The campground has modern washhouses with flush toilets, showers, drinking water, and two sanitary dump stations. There is one walled tent that is available for rent, which sleeps up to six people and has a refrigerator and <b>bunk</b> <b>beds.</b>|$|E
25|$|There {{are cases}} of young {{children}} playing (on or near <b>bunk</b> <b>beds,</b> trees, clothes lines, play equipment etc.) suffering death or severe brain damage {{as a result of}} hanging by the straps of their bicycle helmets. European Standard EN 1080, which uses a weak retention system designed to open under load, was published in 1997 to address this problem.|$|E
25|$|The Retreat House is {{situated}} behind the Kinder One building. It can house two simultaneous class recollections. The two-story building has identical facilities on both floors: Conference room {{which can be}} converted to a chapel, dining hall, kitchen, dormitory, showers, and lavatories. The dormitories are furnished with <b>bunk</b> <b>beds</b> which can accommodate a class of about 55 (full) and is air-conditioned.|$|E

50|$|The {{facility}} has four general population housing units with double <b>bunked</b> <b>beds.</b> Each unit houses up to 192 men. In addition the prison has two administrative segregation units, including a special use unit.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} type is the {{standard}} <b>bunk</b> <b>bed</b> which has two same size mattresses stacked one directly over the other. A twin over full <b>bunk</b> <b>bed</b> is arranged as a standard except that the bottom mattress is a full size and the upper is a twin size. A full over full <b>bunk</b> <b>bed</b> is otherwise called as the wider bed which means both top and bottom has the same wider size. They both have a double bed {{and a total of}} four people can sleep in it at the same time.A futon bunk is also arranged like a standard bunk except the lower bunk is a Western-style futon couch which converts into a bed rather than a standard mattress. Futon bunks can be used to save space in small apartments or rooms, because the lower bed converts to a couch for use during the daytime. In an L-shape <b>bunk</b> the bottom <b>bed</b> is oriented at a right angle to the top bed such that when viewed from above the beds form an L. This also creates a small alcove where a desk or bookshelf can be placed.|$|R
25|$|Prisoners {{that fall}} into the medium {{security}} group may sleep in cells, but share them two and two, and use <b>bunk</b> <b>beds</b> with lockers to store their possessions. The cell may have showers, toilets and sinks, but it's not a strictly enforced rule. Cells are locked at night {{with one or more}} correctional officers supervising. There is less supervision over the internal movements of prisoners. The perimeter is generally double fenced and regularly patrolled.|$|E
25|$|Boarding schools {{generally}} have dormitories as resident halls {{at least for}} junior or younger children around age 4 to 9 years of age. In classic British boarding schools these typically have <b>bunk</b> <b>beds</b> that have traditionally come {{to be associated with}} boarding schools. The Department for Children, Schools and Families, in conjunction with the Department of Health of the United Kingdom, has prescribed guidelines for dormitories in boarding schools. These regulations come under what is called as the National Boarding Standards.|$|E
25|$|Deluxe Camping Cottage: Located in the campground, the deluxe cottage has two rooms. The bedroom sleeps {{five people}} in <b>bunk</b> <b>beds</b> (three twin {{mattresses}} and one full size mattress). The kitchen/dining area contains a stove, microwave, refrigerator, countertop, table, chairs, and electric heat and outlets. There is no {{water in the}} cottage, but water {{is available at the}} nearby shower house. Outside there is a picnic table on the porch and a nearby fire ring. The camping season begins the second Friday in April and ends in early December.|$|E
25|$|In India normal {{carriages}} {{often have}} double height seating, with benches (berths), {{so that people}} can sit above one another (not unlike a <b>bunk</b> <b>bed),</b> in other countries true double decker carriages are becoming more common.|$|R
50|$|A triple loft bed is an {{arrangement}} involving {{a total of}} three bunks. These bunks are a combination of bed types, where a loft bed is perpendicularly attached to a <b>bunk</b> <b>bed</b> to form an L-shape.|$|R
50|$|A loft bed is an {{elevated}} bed {{similar to a}} <b>bunk</b> <b>bed,</b> but without the lower beds - freeing floor space for other furniture (such as a desk) which might be built into the loft bed.|$|R
25|$|These {{were the}} basic soldiers' camps, {{made up of}} wooden barrack huts 10m wide and 50m long, covered with tar on the outside. Each hut held around 250 prisoners. A central {{corridor}} provided access on each side to <b>bunk</b> <b>beds,</b> with straw- or sawdust-filled palliasses. Furniture was kept to a minimum, and generally limited to a table, chairs or benches and a stove. The camps also included barracks for guards, a Kantine (cafeteria) where prisoners could sometimes buy small luxuries and supplementary food, a parcels office, a guardhouse, and kitchens. Some camps had additional amenities, including sanitary facilities, or cultural facilities such as a library, a theatre/concert hall, or a space for worship.|$|E
25|$|At the camp, counselors Ned, Jack, Bill, Marcie, Brenda, and Alice, {{along with}} the owner Steve Christy, {{refurbish}} the cabins and facilities. As a thunderstorm approaches, Steve leaves the campground to stock supplies. Soon after, Ned sees someone walk {{into one of the}} cabins, and follows. As Jack and Marcie have sex in one of the cabin's <b>bunk</b> <b>beds,</b> they are unaware of Ned's body directly above them, his throat slit. Soon after, Jack is killed when his throat is pierced by an arrow from beneath the bed, and the killer murders Marcie by slamming an axe into her face. Brenda hears a child's voice calling for help and ventures outside her cabin to the archery range, only for the range lights to turn on as she is attacked off-screen. Eventually, Steve returns to the camp and is killed.|$|E
25|$|The Attacker class {{comprised}} eight ships {{built in}} the United States for the Royal Navy during the Second World War. They were all built between 1941 and 1942 by Ingalls Shipbuilding or Western Pipe & Steel shipyards; both companies completed four ships. They were then supplied {{under the terms of}} Lend-Lease to the Royal Navy for their use. The ships had a complement of 646 men. Crew accommodations were significantly different from the normal for the Royal Navy at the time. Instead of food being prepared by separate messes, it was cooked in the galley and served cafeteria-style in a central dining area. Unlike British-built ships, they were equipped with a modern laundry and a barber shop. The traditional hammocks were replaced by three-tier <b>bunk</b> <b>beds,</b> 18 to a cabin, which were hinged and could be tied up to provide extra space when not in use.|$|E

50|$|Marty Morrisey, a 36-year-old from Belmont, Nova Scotia, was {{drinking}} with two {{friends in a}} cabin. Morrisey and his friend Adrian Teed sawed the barrel off a shotgun. Morrisey told Teed the gun was {{for the purpose of}} committing a robbery when in fact he was intending to kill himself due to recent relationship problems. Morrisey drove the third friend home, and {{when he returned to the}} cabin Teed was sleeping in a <b>bunk</b> <b>bed.</b> Morrisey leaped onto the <b>bunk</b> <b>bed</b> while holding the loaded shotgun. He subsequently fell off the bed, likely due to his intoxication, and the gun accidentally discharged, fatally wounding Teed.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to a bed (or, if shared by two or more children, a <b>bunk</b> <b>bed),</b> a child's bedroom may include a small closet or dressers, a toy box or computer game console, bookcase or other items.|$|R
25|$|Many {{prisons in}} the United States are overcrowded. For example, California's 33 prisons {{have a total}} {{capacity}} of 100,000, but they hold 170,000 inmates. Many prisons in California {{and around the country}} are forced to turn old gymnasiums and classrooms into huge bunkhouses for inmates. They do this by placing hundreds of <b>bunk</b> <b>beds</b> next to one another, in these gyms, without any type of barriers to keep inmates separated. In California, the inadequate security engendered by this situation, coupled with insufficient staffing levels, have led to increased violence and a prison health system that causes one death a week. This situation has led the courts to order California to release 27% of the current prison population, citing the Eighth Amendment's prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment. The three-judge court considering requests by the Plata v. Schwarzenegger and Coleman v. Schwarzenegger courts found California's prisons have become criminogenic as a result of prison overcrowding.|$|E
25|$|Tahiti left New Zealand on 10 July 1918 with 1,117 troops onboard and 100 crew members, {{bound for}} England. When {{she met the}} rest of her convoy at Freetown in Sierra Leone, reports of disease ashore led to a {{quarantine}} order for the ships. However, the ships were resupplied by local workers, and officers attended a conference onboard HMS Mantua, an armed merchant cruiser, which had experienced an influenza outbreak three weeks previously. The first soldiers suffering from Spanish influenza began reporting to the hospital on Tahiti on 26 August, the day that she left Freetown. By the time she arrived at Devonport on 10 September 68 men had died and a further nine died afterwards, an overall mortality rate of 68.9 persons per 1,000 population. It is estimated that more than 1,000 of those on board had been infected with the disease. A later enquiry found that mortality was worst in those over 40 years and that those over 25 had a higher mortality than those under 25. Mortality was also higher in those sleeping in <b>bunk</b> <b>beds</b> rather than in hammocks. The conclusion of the enquiry was that overcrowding and poor ventilation had contributed to the exceptionally high infection rate and death toll. It {{was one of the worst}} outbreaks worldwide for the 1918/19 pandemic in terms of both morbidity and mortality.|$|E
500|$|Another {{method of}} {{peaceful}} protesting was {{demonstrated in the}} formation of Camp Solidarity which was located {{in the center of the}} protesting, in southern Virginia. Supporters came from all over the country to show their outrage against the actions of Pittston but there was no place that they could stay. Although many people in the local towns would offer shelter, they could not provide enough beds and food for all the people who came. Union member supporters found a solution to the problem. [...] A local recreational park near Castlewood, Virginia was turned into a campground where these supporters could stay. A small shelter equipped with <b>bunk</b> <b>beds</b> was built and an already existing snack bar was opened to provide food for the people staying at Camp Solidarity. Because the location was a recreational park, there was plenty of space for others to bring campers and tents into the area.|$|E
50|$|The ranch {{is about}} a 15-minute drive from the theme parks. Cabins include a TV, double <b>bed,</b> a <b>bunk</b> <b>bed</b> and {{convertible}} sofa bed. It is similar to Walt Disney World's Disney's Fort Wilderness Resort & Campground.|$|R
50|$|The top bunk of a <b>bunk</b> <b>bed</b> may be {{lined with}} safety rails {{to keep the}} user from rolling out and falling to the floor while sleeping. Beds that do not include rails may be {{retrofitted}} to include them.|$|R
50|$|Hostels provide budget-oriented, sociable {{accommodation}} where {{guests can}} rent a <b>bed,</b> usually a <b>bunk</b> <b>bed,</b> in a dormitory and share a bathroom, lounge {{and sometimes a}} kitchen. Rooms can be mixed or single-sex, and private rooms may also be available.|$|R
