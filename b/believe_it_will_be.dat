25|$|Lake {{expressed}} interest in renegotiating her deal with Paramount:The studio feels that way about it too. They have indicated {{they are going to}} fuss more about the pictures in which I appear. I think I'll enjoy being fussed about... I want this to be the turning point and I think that it will. I am free and clear of unpleasant characters, unless they are strongly justified. I've had a varied experience playing them and also appearing as heroines. The roles themselves haven't been noteworthy and sometimes not even especially spotlighted, but I think they've all been beneficial in one way or another. From here on there should be a certain pattern of development, and that is what I am going to fight for if necessary, though I don't <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> because they are so understanding here at Paramount.|$|E

Her friend Arthur Maynwaring wrote that she was more capable of business than any man. Although she never came to like Blenheim Palace – describing it as [...] "that great heap of stones" [...] – she became more enthusiastic about its construction and wrote to the Duke of Somerset about the new waterworks: [...] "I <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> beautiful.

2500|$|The Cycle Super Highways are {{a series}} of bike paths that connect Copenhagen to nearby suburbs. This {{initiative}} began in 2009 when both Copenhagen and the neighboring cities realized that building new infrastructure would allow commuters to bike into the city and create more sustainable transportation options. Since traffic planners <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> very difficult to raise the modal share substantially beyond the current 50% for its own residents, the city has begun targeting commuters entering the city from surrounding municipalities on trips in the [...] range, aiming {{to increase the number of}} bicycle commuters by 30% throughout the capital region. The project involves a [...] network of 26 named and signposted routes following a uniform standard with high maintenance and good services such as automatic air-pumps and prioritized snow removal. While international media has created some hyperbole around the concept, labelling the network as bicycle superhighways, they are largely not grade separated. Rather the routes are regular cycle tracks receiving smaller targeted upgrades.|$|E
2500|$|Jeanne-Claude was a {{firm believer}} in the {{aesthetic}} beauty of works of art; she said, “‘We want to create works of art of joy and beauty, which we will build because we <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> beautiful.’” However, {{that does not mean that}} Jeanne-Claude and Christo’s artworks were without larger political connotations. Jeanne-Claude and Christo created a piece in response to the building of the Berlin Wall, in 1962. They blocked off the Rue Visconti in Paris with a wall of oil drums. The 4-meter-high wall built with oil barrels completely closed the street and blocked all communication between Rue Bonaparte and Rue de Seine. They said, [...] "This 'iron curtain' can be used as a barricade during a period of public work in the street, or to transform the street into a dead end. Finally its principle can be extended to a whole area or an entire city." [...] As the police approached, Jeanne-Claude firmly stood her ground and guarded the art piece, arguing for it to stay in place just for a few more hours.|$|E
