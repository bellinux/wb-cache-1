5000|$|Paleontological {{evidence}} has suggested an {{origin of the}} red wolf line 1-2 Ma, branching from a wolf-coyote ancestor, which itself appeared about 4.9 Ma. Between 150,000-300,000 years ago, the North American branch evolved into the red wolf, eastern wolf and the coyote. [...] Another wolf-like branch migrated to Eurasia and evolved into the gray wolf, which later migrated to North America.It is thought that its original distribution included much of eastern North America, where red wolves were found from Maine south to Florida and in south central US westward to Texas.

40|$|Up to 1949, the Fish and Game Branch {{employed}} personnel, some of {{whom were}} temporary, to attempt control of the extremely high wolf popÂ¬ulations of the central and northern portions of British Columbia. Coyotes were also very numerous in the central and southern regions and had to be considered because of their depredations. The field men were keen and conscientious but their efforts were not co-ordinated. Control areas were severely restricted in size as techniques were not adaptable enough and {{because of a lack of}} manpower. Eventually, sheepmen went out of business entirely over wide areas, cattlemen were subjected to huge annual losses, and sportsmen were very concerned. However, stock losses constituted the major complaint and resulted in ranchers demanding action* Two major changes came out of this. First, the bounty on wolves was raised and second, the present Predator Control Division was formed. The administration was convinced that a force of experienced, fully-trained field staff under a single supervision would be far more effective than <b>bounty</b> <b>payments.</b> Unfortunately, <b>bounties</b> were in vogue during that time and forced the necessity of proving the worth of organized controls before any consideration could be given to the elimination of the bounty system...|$|R

40|$|Three of five {{species of}} rat-kangaroo have {{declined}} to extinction within New South Wales since European settlement, and a fourth now occupies less than 2 % of the state. This paper provides new evidence on the timing of those extinctions and details the spatial pattern of collapse of their populations. Data come from detailed records of <b>bounty</b> <b>payments</b> paid in districts throughout much of New South Wales for their control as pests of agriculture Nearly 3 million rat-kangaroos were harvested during the period 1883 - 1920. Rat-kangaroo populations survived the colonization of New South Wales by the European rabbit in the period 18701900, the build up of sheep numbers to a record 55 million in New South Wales in 1892, and the major changes in Vegetation structure and biomass that would have resulted. They also survived the major drought of 1888. The European red fox invaded New South Wales from {{the south in the}} late 1890 s and occupied the entire state, apart from the far north-east, by 1915. Rat-kangaroo decline is closely associated with the south-north advance of the fox. In the south and central regions, the decline coincided with the drought of 1902. However, in the north, where foxes were yet to arrive, rat-kangaroo populations recovered strongly from that drought, only to collapse 10 years later as foxes advanced into the region...|$|R
40|$|The sheep grazing {{industry}} has been an economic mainstay of New South Wales from the early period of European settlement. The dingo quickly established itself as a predator of sheep and a pest of the pastoral industry. In the latter decades of the nineteenth century, a system was established under which bounties were paid {{on a wide range}} of species, but bounties paid for dingoes were far in excess of those paid for other species. In addition, an exclusion fence was built, spanning 8, 614 km and three States, to prevent dingoes from reinvading south-eastern Australia. This level of control effort reflects the importance of the dingo as a pest of the sheep industry. In the period between 1883 and 1930, over 280, 000 bounties were paid for dingoes in New South Wales. At the beginning of this period, dingoes appeared to be distributed throughout New South Wales. By 1930, dingoes were scarce in all but the north-eastern corner of the State. The highest numbers of sheep were grazed in the areas that showed the most rapid decline in dingo numbers, while relatively low numbers were grazed in the areas where dingoes remained common. No relationship was observed between the value of bounties offered and the number of scalps submitted. The main incentive for the destruction of dingoes by humans is likely to have been the protection of stock, rather than the monetary reward of the <b>bounty</b> <b>payments...</b>|$|R
40|$|For centuries, bounty hunts for seals (Phoca vitulina) were {{conducted}} in the Province of Zeeland (SWNetherlands). Records of bounties paid for seals hunted in that area have been archived by the province of Zeelandfrom the 16 th until the 20 th century. These hunting records were used to reconstruct the numbers of seals caughteach year in order to subsequently investigate the effect of social and historical events on the hunt. Based on thetype of records we discerned three periods in the bounty hunts: 16 th until 19 th century, 19 th century, and 20 th century. During these periods large fluctuations in numbers of seals killed were observed. In the first period, highyields were achieved when experienced hunters (Frisians) came to the area, whereas the presence of privateers- and to a much lesser extent war activities - lead to significant lower seal catches. The effects of these events onthe hunt appear to be so significant that it impairs {{the reconstruction of the}} population size in the pre- 20 th centuryperiod. This is different for the 20 th century. Besides the periods during the two World Wars, no large scalechanges in environmental conditions occurred. Efficacy of hunting methods took effect from 1900 onwards, whenfirearms became increasingly accurate. When <b>bounty</b> <b>payments</b> stopped in 1934, the seal hunt still continued andcatches were registered. When the hunt was finally closed in 1961, the population in the SW-Netherlands had beendecreased to approximately five percent of its estimated size around 1900. It has not recovered since then, mainlydue to lack of immigration, high mortality, excessive disturbance, and low reproduction...|$|R
40|$|Persecution causes {{population}} declines {{only if it}} adds to {{the natural}} mortality and does not merely replace it. Large raptor species with slow breeding rates are less able to withstand heavy losses than are small species with fast breeding rates. Over the last 150 years, persecution has eliminated some of the bigger species from large parts of Europe and is still responsible for restricting the distribution of others. In Britain over this peri-od, the ranges of several species have contracted and expanded again with the rise and partial decline in game preservation, with temporary expansions during two wars wh, en gamekeepers were otherwise employed. Persecution is still restricting the breeding range of the Golden Eagle, the Buzzard, and the Hen Harrier in the British Isles to about half the potential. In some lists of <b>bounty</b> <b>payments,</b> certain species declined or disappeared in the re-cords during {{the operation of the}} scheme, suggesting that the killing itself reduced or exterminated them. But in other lists, no declines in numbers killed occurred over a long period, suggesting that hunters were merely cropping the population and causing no long-term decline. The importance of deliberate killing of raptors is shown by the large proportions of banded birds that were later recovered, and by the proportions of these recovered birds reported as shot. Recovery rates were as high (or higher) for some Eu-ropean raptors as for many game-bird and waterfowl populations exposed to regular hunting seasons. Widespread use of poison on meat baits has had the most damaging effects on European raptor populations, often where the procedure was aimed primarily against wolves or foxes. In recent years, the most commonly used poisons include strych-nine, phosdrin, and alpha-chlorolose...|$|R
