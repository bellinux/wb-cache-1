40|$|Piezoelectric {{properties}} and dielectric losses have been measured in polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) /polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) blends {{to assess the}} value of this class of polymers as ultrasonic transducer materials. The electromechanical coupling factor k(t) has been found to become vanishingly small in blends having a PMMA content of about 20 % by weight. For the same blend composition, the peak of dielectric losses, which at room temperature is located in the low megahertz range, decreases only by 20 %. For low PMMA content <b>blends</b> at <b>room</b> temperature, the slow decrease of dielectric losses and the slight frequency shift of the loss peak in the megahertz region are ascribed to the presence of two conjugate amorphous phases. This structure prevents much stronger effects on dielectric losses which could be expected from blending PVDF with a polymer having a high glass transition temperature, such as PMMA. PVDF-PMMA blends, therefore do not represent an attractive class of ultrasonic transducer materials...|$|R

In addition, the effect of characteristics of MgO on the hydration process was discussed. It was found that the synthesis of magnesium silicate hydrate was highly dependent on the reactivity of the precursors. MgO and silica with higher reactivity resulted in higher formation rate of magnesium silicate hydrate.

40|$|PLLA is a {{thermoplastic}} biopolymer {{and can be}} used {{in industrial}} applications for medical and filtration applications. The brittleness of PLLA is attributed to slow crystallization rates and its glass transition temperature (Tg) is high (60 °C); for this reason, its applications are limited. The orientation, morphology, and crystal structure of the electrospun fibers was investigated by SEM, POM, DSC, FTIR, XRD, and SAXS. Combining with additives leads to a large decrease of fiber diameter, viscosity, and changes of fiber morphology and crystal structure compared to pure PLLA. DSC showed that the Tg of PLLA decreased about 15 °C and there was no change in relaxation enthalpy by the addition of plasticizer. FT-IR indicate a strong interaction between PLLA and additives; a new band appears in the PLLA blend at 1, 756 cm− 1 at room temperature as a crystalline band without any annealing. In addition, WAXD indicated that the intensities of the two peaks at (200 / 110) and (203) increased for the <b>blend</b> at <b>room</b> temperature without any annealing in comparison with PLLA; this means that PHB crystallizes in the amorphous region of PLLA.

So far most studies {{relate to the}} mechanical deformation and to the change of nano-scale electrical properties. We present an attempt to utilize multi wall carbon nanotubes for developing a new flexible composite for macro-scale pressure sensors. Two simultaneously existing effects – mechanical strain sensing and organic solvent vapour sensing – were found and investigated in polyisoprene – multi wall carbon nanotube composites. Elastomer composites containing dispersed nano-size particles, for example, polyisoprene – multi wall carbon nanotube composites were prepared by treatment of the composite matrix with chloroform providing an increase of mobility and better dispersion of the nano-particles within the matrix.

40|$|Imide units copolymerized with MMA {{units have}} been {{selected}} {{in order to improve}} compatibility between PC and acrylics through specific interaction or internal repulsion. Good dispersion of acrylic inside a PC matrix has been observed upon melt mixing, which can be partially explained by the good rheological agreement between these two polymers. Transmission electron microscopy has shown that the system remains phase separated from 5 to 95 wt % of PC. Phase diagrams for three different imide concentrations have been drawn. Results obtained by DSC (conventional and with enthalpy relaxation) are similar to those obtained by optical cloud point detection. The phase diagrams show the raise of the PC/PMMA demixtion curve (LCST type) when percentage of imide increases in the acrylic phase. Theoretical calculations on binary interaction energy density show a slight improvement of the interaction between acrylic and PC when imide percentage increases. Cloud point measurements on 50 / 50 PC/acrylic blends varying the imide concentration show that the improvement of compatibility deduced from the raise of the demixtion curve (LCST type) is more related to a kinetic effect (the high T-g of imidized samples is reducing macromolecule mobility) than specific interactions. The calculated favorable interactions are probably too weak to be detected with cloud point measurements. The microstructures obtained after crystallization of the PC phase under solvent vapors is phase separated PC/acrylics blends can also be explained by T-g effects. Moreover, solvent vapor exposure could be a powerful tool to determine the real thermodynamic behavior of the <b>blends</b> at <b>room</b> temperature. (C) 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Biopolymers of hard, brittle and low {{flexible}} polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) and a {{soft and}} high elastic natural-latex rubber are <b>blended</b> at <b>room</b> temperature by using a combination technique. Concentrations of the PHAs solution are constituted at 1 %, 2 % and 3 % w/v and mingled with fresh natural latex in different ratios (PHAs: Latex Rubber = 0 : 10, 1 : 9, 2 : 8, 3 : 7, 4 : 6, 5 : 5, 6 : 4, 7 : 3, 8 : 2, 9 : 1 and 10 : 0). After vigorous blending, forming polymeric sheets leave a dried-film pattern. Only the best 3 different ratios (4 : 6, 5 : 5 and 6 : 4) are selected by evaluating morphological-based information. These lead to actually define and characterize for their morphological and mechanical properties. The morphological attributes are exemplified by polarized optical microscopy and X-ray diffractometry (XRD) while the thermal characterization is determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Morphological analysis for the criterion of blending achievement indicated {{that there is a}} significant relationship among porosity, texture and shrinkage. The porosity shows obviously low to high for gradually increasing PHAs and decreasing the latex. Thus, dense texture and shrinkage relate to blending compositions between PHAs and latex. The XRD and DSC reveal certain aspects of decreasing crystallinity arising from enhancing of the latex content. A high degree of crystallinity and melting temperature relates to greater PHAs ratio. The mechanical investigations have revealed complex localization patterns of tensile strength and elastic modulus. The more PHAs concentration at 2 % w/v indicates the greater elastic modulus than 3 % and 1 % w/v. Significant differences are found on polymeric composites of mechanical analyses between PHAs and natural latex. The constituted superiority in the ratio of 5 : 5 significantly differs in extension to break. Additionally, both tensile strength and elastic modulus of 2 % w/v PHAs present the maximum value among them...|$|R
40|$|Intellectual Merit: 	The {{goal of this}} {{dissertation}} is {{to investigate}} the electrochemical properties and microstructure of thin film polymer electrolytes with enhanced electrochemical performance. Solid electrolyte architectures have been produced by <b>blending</b> novel <b>room</b> temperature ionic liquid (RTIL) chemistries with ionically conductive polymer matrices. A variety of microstructure and electrical characterization tools have been employed to understand the hybrid electrolyte's performance. 	Lithium-ion batteries are limited because of {{the safety of the}} electrolyte. The current generation of batteries uses organic solvents to conduct lithium between the electrodes. Occasionally, the low boiling point and high combustibility of these solvents lead to pressure build ups and fires within cells. Additionally, there are issues with electrolyte loss and decreased performance that must be accounted for in daily use. Thus, interest in replacing this system with a solid polymer electrolyte that can match the properties of an organic solvent is of great interest in battery research. However, a polymer electrolyte by itself is incapable of meeting the performance characteristics, and thus by adding an RTIL it has met the necessary threshold values. 	With the development of the novel sulfur based ionic liquid compounds, improved performance characteristics were realized for the polymer electrolyte. The synthesized RTILs were blended with ionically conductive polymer matrices (polyethylene oxide (PEO) or block copolymers of PEO) to produce solid electrolytes. Such shape-conforming materials could be lead to unique battery morphologies, but more importantly the safety of these new batteries will greatly exceeds those based on traditional organic carbonate electrolytes. Broader Impacts: 	The broader impact of this research is that it will ultimately help push forward an attractive alternative to carbonate based liquid electrolyte systems. Development of these alternatives has been slow; however bypassing the current commercial options will lead to not only safer and more powerful batteries. The polymer electrolyte system offers flexibility in both mechanical properties and product design. In due course, this will lead to batteries unlike any currently available on the market. RTILs offer quite an attractive option and the electrochemical understanding of novel architectures based upon sulfur will lead to further potential uses for these compounds...|$|R

Three different sets of latexes were synthesized: PBA latex (diameter 97 nm), pyrene (P) -labeled large PS (LgPS; diameter 900 nm), and small PS (SmPS; diameter 320 nm). Two different series of latex blends (LgPS/PBA and SmPS/PBA) were prepared with varying <b>blend</b> composition at <b>room</b> temperature separately. Films were then annealed at elevated temperatures above glass transition (T(g)) temperature of PS. Fluorescence intensity (I(P)) from P and photon transmission intensity (I(tr)) were measured after each annealing step to monitor the stages of film formation. The results showed that a significant change occurred in I(P) and I(tr) at a certain critical weight fraction (R(c)) of PBA. Below R(c), two distinct film formation stages, which are named as void closure and interdiffusion, were seen. However, at PBA concentrations nearer to or above R(c), no film formation can be achieved. Comparing to the LgPS/PBA, the sintering process of SmPS/PBA particles occurred at much lower temperatures. Film formation stages for R < R(c) were modeled, and related activation energies were calculated. Void closure (Delta H) and interdiffusion (Delta E) activation energies for SmPS/PBA were also found smaller in comparing with LgPS/PBA series. However, Delta H and Delta E values were not changed much with the blend composition for both series. POLYM. COMPOS., 31 : 1637 - 1652, 2010. (C) 2009 Society of Plastics Engineer...|$|R
