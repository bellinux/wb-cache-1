5|$|The early {{development}} of cultigen taxonomy follows that of plant taxonomy in general {{as the early}} listing and documentation of plants made little distinction between those that were anthropogenic and those that were natural wild kinds. Formal botanical nomenclature and classification evolved from the simple <b>binomial</b> <b>system</b> of folk taxonomy {{and it was not}} until the mid-19th century that the nomenclatural path of cultigens began to diverge from mainstream plant taxonomy.|$|E
5|$|Botany {{originated}} in prehistory as herbalism with {{the efforts of}} early humans to identify – and later cultivate – edible, medicinal and poisonous plants, {{making it one of}} the oldest branches of science. Medieval physic gardens, often attached to monasteries, contained plants of medical importance. They were forerunners of the first botanical gardens attached to universities, founded from the 1540s onwards. One of the earliest was the Padua botanical garden. These gardens facilitated the academic study of plants. Efforts to catalogue and describe their collections were the beginnings of plant taxonomy, and led in 1753 to the <b>binomial</b> <b>system</b> of Carl Linnaeus that remains in use to this day.|$|E
5|$|Mycology is a {{relatively}} new science that became systematic after the development of the microscope in the 17th century. Although fungal spores were first observed by Giambattista della Porta in 1588, the seminal work in the development of mycology is considered to be the publication of Pier Antonio Micheli's 1729 work Nova plantarum genera. Micheli not only observed spores but also showed that, under the proper conditions, they could be induced into growing into the same species of fungi from which they originated. Extending the use of the <b>binomial</b> <b>system</b> of nomenclature introduced by Carl Linnaeus in his Species plantarum (1753), the Dutch Christian Hendrik Persoon (1761–1836) established the first classification of mushrooms with such skill so as to be considered a founder of modern mycology. Later, Elias Magnus Fries (1794–1878) further elaborated the classification of fungi, using spore color and various microscopic characteristics, methods still used by taxonomists today. Other notable early contributors to mycology in the 17th–19th and early 20th centuries include Miles Joseph Berkeley, August Carl Joseph Corda, Anton de Bary, the brothers Louis René and Charles Tulasne, Arthur H. R. Buller, Curtis G. Lloyd, and Pier Andrea Saccardo. The 20th century has seen a modernization of mycology that has come from advances in biochemistry, genetics, molecular biology, and biotechnology. The use of DNA sequencing technologies and phylogenetic analysis has provided new insights into fungal relationships and biodiversity, and has challenged traditional morphology-based groupings in fungal taxonomy.|$|E

500|$|Linnaeus {{travelled}} clockwise {{around the}} coast of the Gulf of Bothnia, making major inland incursions from Umeå, Luleå and Tornio. He returned from his six-month-long, over [...] expedition in October, having gathered and observed many plants, birds and rocks. Although Lapland was a region with limited biodiversity, Linnaeus described about 100 previously unidentified plants. These became the basis of his book [...] However, on the expedition to Lapland, Linnaeus used Latin names to describe organisms because he had not yet developed the <b>binomial</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The most {{important}} of these names was the nomen gentilicium, or simply nomen, a hereditary surname that identified a person {{as a member of a}} distinct gens. [...] This was preceded by the praenomen, or [...] "forename", a personal name that served to distinguish between the different members of a family. [...] The origin of this <b>binomial</b> <b>system</b> is lost in prehistory, but it appears to have been established in Latium and Etruria by at least 650 BC. [...] In written form, the nomen was usually followed by a filiation, indicating the personal name of an individual's father, and sometimes the name of the mother or other antecedents. [...] Toward the end of the Roman Republic, this was followed by the name of a citizen's voting tribe. [...] Lastly, these elements could be followed by additional surnames, or cognomina, which could be either personal or hereditary, or a combination of both.|$|E
2500|$|Antoine Lavoisier is {{commonly}} {{cited as a}} central contributor to the chemical revolution. His precise measurements and meticulous keeping of balance sheets throughout his experiment were vital to the wide spread acceptance {{of the law of}} conservation of mass. His introduction of new terminology, a <b>binomial</b> <b>system</b> modeled after that of Linnaeus, also helps to mark the dramatic changes in the field which are referred to generally as the chemical revolution. However, Lavoisier encountered much opposition in trying to change the field, especially from British phlogistic scientists. Joseph Priestley, Richard Kirwan, James Keir, and William Nicholson, among others, argued that quantification of substances did not imply conservation of mass. Rather than reporting factual evidence, opposition claimed Lavoisier was misinterpreting the implications of his research. One of Lavoisier's allies, Jean Baptiste Biot, wrote of Lavoisier's methodology, [...] "one felt the necessity of linking accuracy in experiments to rigor of reasoning." [...] His opposition, however, that a precision in experimentation did not imply precision in inferences and reasonings. Despite opposition, Lavoisier continued to use precise instrumentation to convince other chemists of his conclusions, often results to five to eight decimal places. Nicholson, who estimated that only three of these decimal places were meaningful, stated: If it be denied that these results are pretended to be true in the last figures, I must beg leave to observe, that these long rows of figures, which in some instances extend to a thousand times the nicety of experiment, serve only to exhibit a parade which true science has no need of: and, more than this, that when the real degree of accuracy in experiments is thus hidden from our contemplation, we are somewhat disposed to doubt whether the exactitude scrupuleuse of the experiments be indeed such as to render the proofs de l'ordre demonstratif.|$|E

60|$|In {{accordance}} with the Rules of the British Association, I have faithfully endeavoured to give to each species the first name attached to it, subsequently {{to the introduction of}} the <b>binomial</b> <b>system,</b> in 1758, in the tenth edition[1] of the 'Systema Naturæ.' In {{accordance with}} the Rules, I have rejected all names before this date, and all MS. names. In one single instance, for reasons fully assigned in the proper place, I have broken through the great law of priority. I have given much fewer synonyms than is usual in conchological works; this partly arises from my conviction that giving references to works, in which there is not any original matter, or in which the Plates are not of a high order of excellence, is absolutely injurious to the progress of natural history, and partly, from the impossibility of feeling certain to which species the short descriptions given in most works are applicable;--thus, to take the commonest species, the Lepas anatifera, I have not found a single description (with the exception of the anatomical description by M. Martin St. Ange) by which this species can be certainly discriminated from the almost equally common Lepas Hillii. I have, however, been fortunate in having been permitted to examine a considerable number of authentically named specimens, (to which I have attached the sign (!) used by botanists,) so that several of my synonyms are certainly correct.|$|E

40|$|DEICTIC SYSTEMS IN BALTIC DIALECTS Summary The {{article is}} an attempt to {{investigate}} the Baltic deictic systems and to present the motivation of their systematic restructuring. The following conclusions can be drawn: 1. <b>Binomial</b> deictic <b>systems</b> appear to predominate in Baltic dialects. 2. The <b>binomial</b> deictic <b>systems</b> (as well as the one-member system in the Samogitian dialect) derive from three-member systems. 3. The reconstruction of the common Baltic three-member deictic protosystem could be considered valid if it were to be assumed that the pronoun *vin(E) (j) is → viņš “that” had been early substituted for the Proto-Latvian pronoun *anas (cf. o-trs “second” < *an-taras). 4. Diachronically Lithuanian and Prussian stand in closer affinity to each other than to Lat­vian; the latter possesses a different pronoun to indicate non-proximity in its three-member deic­tic system. 5. Synchronically the Latgalian and the Lithuanian East Highland (Aukštaičiai) subdialects are, however, in closer affinity to each other; they are characterized by structurally similar bino­mial deictic systems, cf. Lat. itys / tys and Lith. itas / tas. 6. The Lithuanian Samogitian dialect and some Latvian Liiv subdialects come close by their one-member deictic systems. 7. The marked members of modern deictic systems, such as Lith. šitas, itas, Lat. šitas, itys, sitȩntas, šitȩnais, are independent derivatives of individual Baltic dialects. The derivatives in ques­tion appeared in dialects after the phonological changes in word-final position. 8. New deictic systems of demonstrative pronouns can be formed by: a) combining a demonstrative word (local adverb) with a demonstrative pronoun, e. g. Lat. *it(E) “here” + ti/ys → iti/ys, Lith. it(ai) or *it(E) “here” + tas → itas, Lat. šitȩn “here” + tas → šitȩ ntas, *šitȩnE “here” + (j) is → šitȩnais, šitȩneis; b) combining stems of two demonstrative pronouns of a similar deictic meaning, e. g. Lith. ši- + tas → šitas “this”. 9. Typologically the Prussian language and the Western dialects of East Baits, characterized by <b>binomial</b> deictic <b>systems,</b> approach the Finno-Ugrian languages which have <b>binomial</b> deictic <b>systems</b> as well, cf. Lat. šis / tas (Puze, Skrunda), Pruss. schis / stas and Est. see / too. 10. The <b>binomial</b> deictic <b>systems</b> of the Baltic Eastern dialects are structurally {{similar to those of the}} East Slavonic languages, cf. Lat. itys j tys, Lith. itas / tas and Russ. этот / mom, Byeloruss. гэтот / тот, йэтот / mom. 11. The Samogitian dialect and some Liiv subdialects are typologically similar to the Liiv and the Swedish languages by their one-member deictic systems, cf. Liiv sìe, Lat. and Sam. tas, Sw. den. The opposition proximity / non-proximity is expressed by the words “here”/“there”, cf. Sam. šitã˙- tas “this”/ untã˙ tàs “that”, Lat. tas te “this”/ tas tur “that” and Sw.

40|$|Computational {{algebraic}} geometry {{is the study}} of roots of polynomials and polynomial systems. We are familiar with the notion of degree, but {{there are other ways to}} consider a polynomial: How many variables does it have? How many terms does it have? Considering the sparsity of a polynomial means we pay special attention to the number of terms. One can sometimes profit greatly by making use of sparsity when doing computations by utilizing tools from linear programming and integer matrix factorization. This thesis investigates several problems from the point of view of sparsity. Consider a system F of n polynomials over n variables, with a total of n + k distinct exponent vectors over any local field L. We discuss conjecturally tight bounds on the maximal number of non-degenerate roots F can have over L, with all coordinates having fixed phase, as a function of n, k, and L only. In particular, we give new explicit systems with number of roots approaching the best known upper bounds. We also give a complete classification for when an n-variate n + 2 -nomial positive polynomial can be written as a sum of squares of polynomials. Finally, we investigate the problem of approximating roots of polynomials from the viewpoint of sparsity by developing a method of approximating roots for <b>binomial</b> <b>systems</b> that runs more efficiently than other current methods. These results serve as building blocks for proving results for less sparse polynomial systems...|$|R
