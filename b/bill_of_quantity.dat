40|$|Abstract: Under {{the current}} {{construction}} cost management system, <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>quantity</b> {{is only applicable}} to project transaction period and project implementation period, while the earlier stage of project which is decisive for construction cost control still adopts estimation and budget estimate under quota mode. However, hysteresis quality of quota cannot timely reflect the current situations of market, causing the interface failure between the two modes, and even the failure of investment control. The paper, in light of foreign advanced experience and China’s national condition characteristics, puts forward the design philosophy of information data base of construction cost which is more suitable for valuation with bill quantity, which provides completed construction cost data as basis for the construction cost overall-process management based on <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>quantity...</b>|$|E
40|$|Producing a <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>quantity</b> is a knowledge-based, {{dynamic and}} {{collaborative}} process, and evolves with variances and current evidence. However, {{within the context}} of information system practice in BIM, knowledge of cost estimation has not been represented, nor has it been integrated into the processes based on BIM. This paper intends to establish an innovative means of taking data from the BIM linked to a project, and using it to create the necessary items for a <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>quantity</b> that will enable cost estimation to be undertaken for the project. Our framework is founded upon the belief that three components are necessary to gain a full awareness of the domain which is being computerised; the information type which is to be assessed for compatibility (syntax), the definition for the pricing domain (semantics), and the precise implementation environment for the standards being taken into account (pragmatics). In order to achieve this, a prototype is created that allows a cost item for the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>quantity</b> to be spontaneously generated, by means of the semantic web ontology and a forward chain algorithm. Within this paper, ‘cost items’ signify the elements included in a <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>quantity,</b> including details of their description, quantity and price. As a means of authenticating the process being developed, the authors of this work effectively implemented it in the production of cost items. In addition, the items created were contrasted with those produced by specialists. For this reason, this innovative framework introduces the possibility of a new means of applying semantic web ontology and forward chain algorithm to construction professional practice resulting in automatic cost estimation. These key outcomes demonstrate that, decoupling the professional practice into three key components of syntax, semantics and pragmatics can provide tangible benefits to domain use...|$|E
40|$|The {{population}} growth in Malaysia {{has contributed to the}} increasing number of construction industry for building and residential area. However, the rising price for building materials has influence the rising price of housing. This issue has affected the small construction industries in Malaysia especially in housing construction. Thus, many developers and parties are trying to find ways to construct affordable houses with shortest time. However, most of them are not aware about new method of construction which is interlocking block method. By using this method, many problems can be overcome especially the duration of construction and offers good solution in construction of affordable housing. The aim of this project is to make a feasibility study on interlocking block building system as an alternative to conventional building system for affordable housing. A sample of single storay house was chosen to calculate the cost of project which is applies conventional and interlocking block method. The difference in cost is compared using <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>quantity</b> calculation and questionnaire method. Briefly, the results show that from survey, interlocking block system help to reduce cost and can be save up to 11. 36 % and 2. 6 % from <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>quantity</b> calculation method. From these findings, interlocking block building system can overcome the wastage of formwork problem and reduce the number of skilled labor. Indirectly the cost of construction can be reduced...|$|E

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The aim {{of this research is}} to improve the efficiency of the construction process through the application of electronic data interchange (EDI). This thesis describes the development and application of EDI messages. The messages described are targeted to provide a means for transferring construction specific information during the construction process. The definition of electronic data interchange and its technical issues are first described. The nature of EDI, replacing paper based communication with electronic messages, impacts on the way in which business is conducted, and also has far reaching legal implications due to the reliance of many legal systems on paper documents and signatures. The business and legal implications are therefore discussed in detail. The application of EDI in the construction industry is investigated by means of a literature review. This work is furthered by a longitudinal study of the construction industry's application of EDI, which consisted of two surveys at a five year interval. A model of the information flows within the traditional construction process is developed to assist in the identification of information flows suitable for EDI. A methodology for message development was produced. The methodology was then applied to develop a description data model that could be utilised in the existing <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>quantity</b> and trading cycle messages. The <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>quantity</b> message set was at a stage ready for trial. To determine the issues related to implementation specifically in the construction industry a trial implementation of this message set was undertaken. The official implementation undertaken by EDICON is described. Software was also developed to undertake the trial. This software was tested and proved the message set developed was suitable for the transfer of <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>quantity</b> related information during a construction project. The factors causing the failure of the implementation of the bill of quantities message set are discussed. A number of these factors are considered valid for all construction project information flows. Finally, the use of shared project models to re-engineer construction information tasks is recommended as a means of achieving significant benefit from electronic data exchange in the construction process...|$|E

The objectives for this study are to determine the cost for single, 2 -storey and 3 -storey house by using the conventional method, to determine the cost for single, 2 -storey and 3 -storey house by using the interlocking block system and to determine the most economic construction between conventional and interlocking block system in term of material, manpower and time.
