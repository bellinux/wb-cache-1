We hit the road in hopes of catching sunset over the Mackinaw Bridge and arrived in Mackinaw City in no time. By this time it was close to dinner time and our bellies were growling with hunger so we decided to indulge on pizza and beer.

5000|$|At age eight, Spears and {{her mother}} Lynne {{traveled}} to Atlanta, Georgia to audition for the 1990s revival of The Mickey Mouse Club. Casting director Matt Casella rejected her as too young, but introduced her to Nancy Carson, a New York City talent agent. Carson was impressed with Spears's singing and suggested enrolling her at the Professional Performing Arts School; shortly after, Lynne and her daughters moved to a sublet apartment in New York. Spears was hired for her first professional role as the understudy for the lead role of Tina Denmark in the Off-Broadway musical Ruthless!. She also appeared as a contestant on the popular television show Star Search and was cast {{in a number of}} commercials. In December 1992, she was cast in The Mickey Mouse Club alongside Christina Aguilera, Justin Timberlake, Ryan Gosling, and Keri Russell. After the show was canceled in 1996, she returned to Mississippi and enrolled at McComb's Parklane Academy.

40|$|A {{large number}} of studies have shown that {{depressed}} individuals have difficulty retrieving memories that refer to a single episode in response to emotional cue words. Instead of these specific memories (e. g., "when my <b>boyfriend</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> had a picnic in Central Park during our trip to New York three years ago", in response to the cue word happy), they rather recall memories that summarize categories of similar events, so-called categoric memories (e. g., "when my <b>boyfriend</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> go for a picnic"). This phenomenon has been termed overgeneral (autobiographical) memory (OGM). Research over the past 25 years has indicated that OGM is not simply a symptom of depression but functions as a trait marker or vulnerability factor for this disorder. In the functional avoidance account, avoidant affect regulation has been identified as one of the key mechanisms underlying the development and maintenance of OGM (Hermans et al., 2008; Raes et al., 2003; Williams et al., 2007). The core idea of this account is that people learn to abort the hierarchical retrieval process at the stage of overgeneral memories to avoid the (anticipated) reactivation of negative emotions, associated with the retrieval of specific negative experiences. In this view, OGM is thus considered a cognitive avoidance strategy. In the general introduction, we review the evidence for the functional avoidance theory by discussing studies on (a) the relationship between OGM and trauma, (b) the association between OGM and (trauma-related) avoidance, and (c) short-term affect regulatory benefits of limited memory specificity. We propose a new developmental framework, in which the development of OGM as an avoidant coping strategy is considered a staged process, influenced by environmental as well as personality factors. All studies that are included in the present doctoral thesis were conducted in nonclinical groups. One of the main problems that researchers often encounter when investigating OGM in nonclinical groups is that the Autobiographical Memory Test (AMT; Wiliams & Broadbent, 1986), with its explicit instruction to respond with specific memories, is insufficiently sensitive to detect OGM in healthy individuals. In a first study, we found that an adapted "Minimal Instructions" version of the AMT, in which the instruction to respond with specific memories is omitted, is more sensitive to detect OGM in nonclinical individuals. In a first major research line, we investigated the basic assumption of the functional avoidance account, namely that OGM is a learned passive avoidance strategy, based on principles of operant conditioning. We developed a new experimental paradigm in which participants are instructed to retrieve memories in response to a large set of cue words. Depending on the condition, they are punished for the retrieval of specific or nonspecific memories with a loud, aversive sound. The effect of this operant conditioning procedure on memory specificity was studied in three experiments in student samples. Our findings showed that operant learning processes can shape the specificity of AM retrieval, but that this process is, at least partially, cognitively mediated. In a second major research line, we conducted three experiments on the flexible use of OGM as an avoidant coping strategy in nonclinical individuals. More specifically, we tested the hypothesis that the induction of an avoidant coping state activates OGM in so-called flexible users, that is, in those healthy individuals who flexibly reduce and augment their memory specificity to regulate affect. In three experiments in student samples we measured autobiographical memory specificity before and after the activation of an avoidant state. It was found (a) that activation of an avoidant state leads to a decrease in memory specificity or increase in memory overgenerality in high avoiders and (b) that associations between OGM and trait avoidance only become apparent after the induction of an avoidant state. In each chapter, we dilate upon the limitations of the conducted studies and offer suggestions for future research. In a general discussion, we discuss the findings of our two major research lines in the light of our new developmental framework and their clinical implications. nrpages: 268 status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Amber Whittaker {{went to see}} {{her family}} {{physician}} about a sore throat. Amber, 19, and her family have been patients of Dr Christine Nowak for 15 years. The Whittakers and Dr Nowak {{are members of the}} same evangelical church, Riverwood Community Church, and they have grown to be friends over the past few years. Dr Nowak examined Amber, performed a rapid strep test, which was positive, and informed her that she had a streptococcal pharyngitis. “Try not to kiss any boys this week, ” Dr Nowak said with a smile. “Actually, now that you mention it, ” Amber said, “that’s something I wanted to ask you about. My <b>boyfriend</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> have been together {{for more than a year}} now, and we’ve been talking seriously about marriage. ” “That’s great! I’m glad to hear things are going well, ” Dr Nowak said. “Well, that’s not all: we feel we’re ready to start having sex, and I need to ask you to write me a prescription for birth control pills. ” Dr Nowak paused for a moment, then explained, “You know, Amber, I appreciate you sharing this with me, but I imagine you know how I feel about premarital sex. As your doctor, friend, and fellow Christian, I think this is an unwise decision, and I can’t in good conscience help you do something I think is wrong. ” “But doctor, we’ve both thought about it, and we love each other, so why put it off any longer?” “As a physician, ” Dr Nowak replied, “I’m committed to doing what’s in my patients’ best interest. And I believe, based on the Scriptures we both read and on our common understanding of God’s nature and purposes for us, that sex is the consummation of a spiritual union between husband and wife. Sex is created by God to be enjoyed in the context of marriage, and saving it for that moment makes it all the more special. I realize that’s difficult, and it’s not what our culture at large believes. But if we call ourselves Christians, we need to carry our beliefs into every aspect of our identity? including something as personal as our sexuality. ...|$|E
