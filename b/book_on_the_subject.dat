5|$|Domitian was {{allegedly}} extremely sensitive regarding his baldness, which he disguised {{in later life}} by wearing wigs. According to Suetonius, he even wrote a <b>book</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> of hair care. With regard to Domitian's personality, however, the account of Suetonius alternates sharply between portraying Domitian as the emperor-tyrant, a man both physically and intellectually lazy, and the intelligent, refined personality drawn elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} decade, Galileo stayed {{well away from}} the controversy. He revived his project of writing a <b>book</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject,</b> {{encouraged}} by the election of Cardinal Maffeo Barberini as Pope Urban VIII in 1623. Barberini was a friend and admirer of Galileo, and had opposed the condemnation of Galileo in 1616. Galileo's resulting book, Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems, was published in 1632, with formal authorization from the Inquisition and papal permission.|$|E
5|$|Cook's {{education}} {{includes a}} background in physics. Prior to {{his work on the}} book, Cook founded the website Skeptical Science, which compiles peer-reviewed evidence of climate change. He placed on the site the most common assertions made by individuals arguing against the scientific consensus for climate change, with evidence to refute each point they made. After the publication of Climate Change Denial: Heads in the Sand, Cook coauthored another <b>book</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject,</b> Climate Change Science: A Modern Synthesis: Volume 1– The Physical Climate (2013). In 2015, Cook served as the climate communication fellow at the University of Queensland.|$|E

5|$|Meher Baba's teachings can roughly {{be divided}} into two main categories: his metaphysics {{on the nature of the}} soul and the Universe, and {{practical}} advice for the spiritual aspirant. The two are interrelated. His metaphysics is mostly found in his principal <b>book</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject,</b> God Speaks. It contains detailed statements on his cosmology and the purpose of life as well as the progression of the soul, while his elucidations on the practical spiritual life are mostly contained in Discourses, although it also covers many metaphysical areas mirroring or amplifying God Speaks.|$|E
5|$|Returning to {{differential}} equations, Hamming studied {{means of}} numerically integrating them. A popular approach {{at the time}} was Milne's Method, attributed to Arthur Milne. This had the drawback of being unstable, so that under certain conditions the result could be swamped by roundoff noise. Hamming developed an improved version, the Hamming predictor-corrector. This was in use for many years, but has since been superseded by the Adams method. He did extensive research into digital filters, devising a new filter, the Hamming window, and eventually writing an entire <b>book</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject,</b> Digital Filters (1977).|$|E

5|$|Since the 2002 {{publication}} of The Rise of the Creative Class, Florida has enjoyed academic and commercial success {{in his study}} and promotion {{of the concept of}} a creative class, or a cohort of highly innovative, highly creative individuals who are sought after by businesses. Who's Your City?, Florida's fourth <b>book</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject,</b> combines scholarly research with a lighthearted self-help tone. Some critics questioned the assumption that the target audience, those easily able to move, would consult the book for advice on moving, but also found the book provides a valuable insight into the impacts of locational choices on the urbanized world.|$|E
5|$|Stolen Childhood: Slave Youth in Nineteenth-Century America broadly {{documents}} {{nineteenth century}} slave {{children and their}} lives. It was the first full-length <b>book</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject,</b> {{and at the time}} of its publishing, the topic of enslaved children was underrepresented in American slavery scholarship. The book is part of Indiana University Press's Blacks in the Diaspora series, and was first published in 1995, with a revised edition in 2011.

5|$|Stolen Childhood: Slave Youth in Nineteenth-Century America is a 1995 {{history book}} about nineteenth century slave {{children}} in America by Wilma King. As the first full-length <b>book</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject,</b> it began the scholarship of slave childhood. The book uses historical documents {{to argue that}} enslaved children were deprived of experiences now understood to constitute childhood, due to early work responsibilities, frequent bodily and emotional trauma, and separations from family. The book covers themes of the children's education, leisure, religion, transitions to freedmen, and work expectations. It {{was published in the}} Indiana University Press's Blacks in the Diaspora series, and a revised edition was released in 2011.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the court {{vacation}} in August 1904, Hastings decided that {{it would be best to}} find a tenancy in a more prestigious set of chambers; Corbet only dealt with two or three cases a year, and solicitors were unlikely to give briefs to a barrister of whom they had never heard. The set of chambers below Corbet's was run by Charles Gill, a well-respected barrister. Hastings would be able to improve his career through an association with Gill, but Gill did not actually know Hastings and had no reason to offer him a place in his chambers. Hastings decided he would spend the court vacation writing a law book, and introduce himself to Gill by asking if he would mind having the book dedicated to him. Hastings wrote the <b>book</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> of the law relating to money-lending, something he knew very little about. He got around this by including large extracts from the judgements in cases related to money-lending, which increased the size of the book and reduced how much he would actually have to write.|$|E
5|$|On 2 October the RPF {{suffered}} a significant reversal, when leader Fred Rwigyema {{was shot in}} the head and killed. There is a dispute about the exact circumstances of Rwigyema's death; the official line of Kagame's government, and the version mentioned by historian Gérard Prunier in his 1995 <b>book</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject,</b> was that Rwigyema was killed by a stray bullet. In his 2009 book Africa's World War, however, Prunier states that it is likely Rwigyema was killed by his subcommander Peter Bayingana, following an argument over tactics. According to this account, Rwigyema was conscious of the need to move slowly, and attempt to win over the Hutu in Rwanda before assaulting Kigali, whereas Bayingana and fellow subcommander Chris Bunyenyezi, wished to strike hard and fast, to achieve power as soon as possible; the argument boiled over, causing Bayingana to shoot Rwigyema dead. Another senior RPF officer, Stephen Nduguta, witnessed this shooting and informed President Museveni; Museveni sent his brother Salim Saleh to investigate, and Saleh ordered Bayingana and Bunyenyezi's arrest and eventual execution.|$|E
