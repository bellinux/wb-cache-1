500|$|On 3 November 1941, Browning was {{promoted}} to major-general, and appointed as the first General Officer Commanding (GOC) of the newly created 1st Airborne Division. The division initially comprised the 1st Parachute Brigade, under Brigadier Richard Gale, and the 1st Airlanding Brigade, under Brigadier George Hopkinson. In this new role he was instrumental in parachutists adopting the maroon beret, and assigned an artist, Major Edward Seago, to design the Parachute Regiment's now famous emblem of the warrior Bellerophon riding Pegasus, the winged horse. However, Browning [...] "designed his own uniform, made of <b>barathea</b> with a false Uhlan-style front, incorporating a zip opening at the neck to reveal regulation shirt and tie, worn with medal ribbons, collar patches, and rank badges, capped off with grey kid gloves, and a highly polished Guards Sam Browne belt and swagger stick", {{all of which were}} worn in the field. He qualified as a pilot in 1942, and henceforth wore the Army Air Corps wings, which he also designed himself.|$|E
2500|$|Black, {{or other}} solid colour, <b>barathea</b> jacket with silver buttons — Regulation Doublet, Prince Charlie (coatee), Brian Boru, Braemar, and black mess jackets are suitable. There is some {{contention}} {{about whether the}} Duke of Montrose and Sheriffmuir doublets are too formal for black-tie occasions. The Argyll jacket is a popular alternative choice; however, it should be worn with a three button waistcoat rather than the five button vest.|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} and most formal model of dinner jacket is the single-breasted model. The typical black-tie jacket is single-breasted with one button only, with [...] and is of black or midnight blue; usually of wool or a wool–mohair, or wool-polyester blend, although other materials, especially silk, are seen. Although other materials are used, {{the most appropriate}} and traditional for the dinner jacket are wool <b>barathea</b> or superfine herringbone. Double breasted models are less common, but considered equally appropriate. Dinner jackets were commonly ventless before World War I, but today come ventless, with side vents, or with center vents. The ventless style is considered more formal, whilst the centre vent is the least formal. The lapels (traditionally pointed and shawl) are usually faced with silk in either a grosgrain or a satin weave, but can also be silk <b>barathea.</b> According to the Black Tie Guide, the peaked lapel and shawl collar are equally authentic and correct. The buttons should be covered in similarly coloured material to {{the main part of}} the jacket, which would ideally be either self-faced or covered with the same material as the lapels. Some higher-end single-breasted jackets, both new and vintage, tend to be fastened with a link front closure which is visually similar to a cufflink; this method of closure is still common in the United Kingdom.|$|E
2500|$|A cummerbund may be {{worn with}} a dinner jacket {{in lieu of}} a {{waistcoat}} and, although it is considered slightly less formal, it is equally correct. It looks especially good with a shawl collar dinner jacket but may be worn in conjunction with peak lapels. The material of the cummerbund should be silk satin, grosgrain (or faille), or <b>barathea</b> to match that of the bow tie. [...] It features upward facing folds, which were originally used to store theatre or opera tickets, and are now considered to be more decorative than functional. Just like the waistcoat, cummerbunds are not worn with a double breasted jacket.|$|E
2500|$|The CWAC {{had many}} jobs with {{different}} uniforms. A canteen worker could wear overalls, a radioman could wear the battledress trousers and the battledress jacket (most common). Uniforms came {{in many different}} forms. Home front women usually wore dress skirts (or trousers) and round hats. If it was a job that meant getting your hands dirty, such as working on an engine of an airplane or vehicle, they would wear normal hardy clothing. Official regulations regarding uniforms were that the women must wear a: [...] "Khaki greatcoat, <b>barathea</b> skirt and hip-length jacket, peak cap with high crown, and a cap badge with three maple leaves on a stem on which was inscribed 'Canadian Women's Army Corps'. Helmeted head of Athene appears on buttons and badges." ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Barathea,</b> {{sometimes}} spelled barrathea, is a soft fabric, with a {{hopsack twill}} weave giving a surface that is lightly pebbled or ribbed. The yarns use cover various combinations of wool, silk and cotton. Worsted <b>barathea</b> (made {{with a smooth}} wool yarn) is often used for evening coats, such as dress coats, dinner jackets, and military uniforms, in black and midnight blue. Silk <b>barathea,</b> either all silk, or using cotton weft and silken warp, is widely used in the necktie industry.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Barathea</b> then proved {{his ability}} to compete at a range of {{distances}} by finishing a close fourth against specialist sprinters in the July Cup. He was thereafter campaigned exclusively at a mile. A narrow defeat to the three-year-old Distant View in the Sussex Stakes, {{was followed by a}} disappointing effort behind East of the Moon in the Prix Jacques Le Marois. In the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes, <b>Barathea</b> defeated several of the best European milers including Bigstone, Distant View and East of the Moon, but was unable to catch the front-running 66-1 ousider Maroof. As the only horse in the field without a previous Group One win, Maroof had been regarded as [...] "cannon fodder" [...] and the result was greeted with [...] "universal amazement".|$|E
50|$|<b>Barathea</b> was undefeated in two {{starts as}} a two-year-old in October 1992, beating a field {{including}} the future Derby Italiano winner White Muzzle in the Westley Maiden Stakes at Newmarket, and following {{up in the}} Houghton Stakes over the same course and distance two weeks later.|$|E

5000|$|Bigstone {{returned}} to England for the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes at Ascot Racecourse on 25 September when his opponents included Kingmambo, <b>Barathea</b> and Sayyedati. Ridden {{for the first}} time by the Irish jockey Pat Eddery, he started at odds of 100/30 on [...] "good to soft" [...] ground. Eddery restrained the colt towards the rear of the nine runner field before making headway in the straight. He took the lead a furlong from the finish and won by one and a half lengths from <b>Barathea</b> with Kingmambo two and a half lengths back in third. On his final appearance of the season, Bigstone was sent to the United States to contest the Breeders' Cup Mile on firm ground at Santa Anita Park. Ridden again by Eddery he finished sixth of the thirteen runners behind Lure.|$|E
5000|$|In June Owington {{was sent}} to Royal Ascot and was made {{favourite}} for the Cork and Orrery Stakes (then a Group Three race). His sixteen opponents included Catrail (Challenge Stakes), Redoubtable (National Stakes), So Factual (European Free Handicap), College Chapel (winner of the race in 1993), Keen Hunter, Piccolo and Lake Coniston. The favourite was restrained by Hills {{in the early stages}} before making progress and taking the lead approaching the final furlong. He held off the challenge of So Factual by half a length, with two lengths back to Catrail in third. On 7 July Owington was partnered by Paul Eddery when he started 3/1 second favourite behind the six-year-old mare Lochsong in the July Cup. Catrail, Piccolo and Redoubtable were again in opposition with the four other runners being <b>Barathea,</b> Dolphin Street (Prix de la Foret), Lavinia Fontana (Prix du Petit Couvert) and Splice (Abernant Stakes). After tracking the leaders, Owington began to make progress in the last quarter mile and overtook the leader <b>Barathea</b> inside the final furlong. He held off a strong late challenge from Dolphin Street to win by a head with Catrail taking third just ahead of <b>Barathea.</b> Cash Asmussen, who rode the runner-up said [...] "I got there to do him, but the bastard Owington was just idling and he pulled out a bit more".|$|E
