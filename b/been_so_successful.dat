5|$|The 1907 Tour de France {{incorporated}} 14 stages, {{which was}} one more than in 1906. For the first time, roads in Switzerland were included. The mountain stages in 1906 had <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>successful,</b> according to the organiser Henri Desgrange, that the western Alps {{were included in the}} race for the first time.|$|E
5|$|Three years later, in 1876, Colorado {{became a}} state. At the time {{settlement}} had pushed as far west from its capital, Denver, as Leadville. There was {{a variety of}} metals and minerals in the surrounding mountains, and some miners had become rich from their claims there. Those who had not <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>successful</b> heard about reports from prospectors of abundant silver deposits further west, over the Divide.|$|E
5|$|By the 1990s, the Federal {{government}} had reversed its views on wolves. In a controversial {{decision by the}} U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (which oversees threatened and endangered species), northwestern wolves imported from Canada were reintroduced into the park. Reintroduction efforts have been successful with populations remaining relatively stable. A survey conducted in 2005 reported that there were 13 wolf packs, totaling 118 individuals in Yellowstone and 326 in the entire ecosystem. These park figures were lower than those reported in 2004 but may be attributable to wolf migration to other nearby areas {{as suggested by the}} substantial increase in the Montana population during that interval. Almost all the wolves documented were descended from the 66 wolves reintroduced in 1995–96. The recovery of populations throughout the states of Wyoming, Montana and Idaho has <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>successful</b> that on February 27, 2008, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service removed the Northern Rocky Mountain wolf population from the endangered species list.|$|E

5|$|In the 1960s, as {{evolutionary}} theorists {{explored the}} possibility of multiple units of selection, ecologists turned to evolutionary approaches. In population ecology, debate over group selection was brief but vigorous; by 1970, most biologists agreed that natural selection was rarely effective above the level of individual organisms. The evolution of ecosystems, however, became a lasting research focus. Ecology expanded rapidly {{with the rise of}} the environmental movement; the International Biological Program attempted to apply the methods of big science (which had <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>successful</b> in the physical sciences) to ecosystem ecology and pressing environmental issues, while smaller-scale independent efforts such as island biogeography and the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest helped redefine the scope of an increasingly diverse discipline.|$|E
5|$|Quimby {{accepted}} each Academy Award for Tom and Jerry's without inviting Hanna and Barbera onstage. The cartoons {{were also}} released with Quimby {{listed as the}} sole producer, following the same practice {{for which he had}} condemned Ising. When Quimby retired in late 1955, Hanna and Barbera were placed in charge of MGM's animation division. As the studio began to lose more revenue due to television, MGM soon realized that re-releasing old cartoons was far more profitable than producing new ones. In 1957, MGM ordered Hanna and Barbera's business manager to close the cartoon division and lay off everyone by a phone call. Hanna and Barbera found the no-notice closing puzzling because Tom and Jerry had <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>successful.</b>|$|E
5|$|Under {{the command}} of Lieutenant Colonel Harold Elliot, the {{battalion}} was brigaded with the 5th, 6th and 8th Battalions to form the 2nd Brigade under Brigadier James Whiteside McCay. Elliott took personal control over the recruitment process, selecting only those officers that he had known from his service in the Citizens Forces as his company commanders, who he in turn entrusted with choosing their own subordinates. Recruitment was conducted {{over a period of}} three weeks {{and by the end of}} the period the process had <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>successful</b> that the battalion was over establishment. Initially, the battalion was organised into eight companies, designated 'A' to 'H', while recruitment and initial training was undertaken at Broadmeadows, however, this was later reduced to the standard four companies, designated 'A' to 'D'.|$|E

5|$|Around mid-afternoon on July 9, {{observers}} {{with the}} 1st Battalion, 21st Infantry spotted {{a column of}} 200 vehicles led by 11 North Korean T-34 tanks, subsequently calling for an airstrike. For {{the next few hours}} the U.S. Air Force ravaged the North Korean column with repeated bombings and strafing, and by sunset half of the vehicles were destroyed or burning and {{a large portion of the}} infantry had also been killed. The next day, a similar airstrike by B-26 Invaders, F-80 and F-82 Twin Mustang aircraft of the Fifth Air Force took place around Pyongtaek, with 38 North Korean tanks, seven half-tracks and 117 other trucks destroyed, in addition to a large number of infantry. Much of the village of Chonui was left burning, although it had already been abandoned by South Korean soldiers and civilians. In addition, the airstrikes caused some of the largest losses of North Korean armor of the war, and were a major blow against the T-34 tanks which had <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>successful</b> during previous encounters.|$|E
5|$|Montejo {{then set}} out to pacify the north coast, leaving Xuárez de Ávila {{commanding}} Gracias a Dios. He first went to San Pedro to present his formal documents of governorship. He was recognised as governor on 16 April, and the following day he annulled all encomiendas issued by Pedro de Alvarado in both the district of San Pedro and in that of Gracias a Dios; he then re-partitioned the province to his own soldiers and supporters. Montejo then sent Alonso de Reinoso with about a hundred soldiers into the mountains around San Pedro to put down native resistance. Montejo marched to Naco, where previous campaigns by Cerezeda and Alvarado had left a large indigenous population dispersed from their settlements and hostile to the encroaching Spanish. Victory was rapid, and many native rulers came to swear allegiance to Montejo. They implored him to protect the trade route to Yucatán, and offered their loyalty in return. Montejo accepted their supplications, and considered a large stretch of the north coast to be at last conquered, and under effective Spanish control. He applied the same moderate treatment to the natives that had <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>successful</b> around Gracias a Dios, with similar results; many returned to their villages and the encomienda system began to function.|$|E
5|$|However, South Vietnamese {{officers}} were often reluctant to absorb heavy casualties. On several occasions, Cao's forces {{were in an}} excellent position to trap and wipe out whole battalions of Viet Cong, but he would fail to close the trap on one pretext or another and allow the enemy to escape. This behavior initially mystified Vann, who was attempting to build Cao into an aggressive commander. Unknown to Vann, Diem would reprimand or demote any officer who lost too many men, no matter how successful the operation. Diem {{was more interested in}} using the military to protect his regime than to take on the Viet Cong. His solution was to fill the ARVN with Catholic political cronies and friends like Cao, Lê Quang Tung, and Tôn Thất Đính, who had little military ability, but were very likely to help stop a coup attempt. After a skirmish on a highway that resulted in a small number of South Vietnamese casualties along with several trucks destroyed, Cao was called to Saigon and reprimanded by Diem. Upon his return, Vann and his group of advisers were forced to end the joint planning sessions that had <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>successful</b> earlier, and action essentially wound down in their region. Cao used the excellent military intelligence network they had developed to find areas devoid of the Viet Cong, and planned operations only in those areas. In many other cases, operations were executed on paper only, in order to report an increasing tempo of operations that did not actually exist.|$|E

25|$|Coelacanths are {{opportunistic}} feeders, hunting cuttlefish, squid, snipe eels, small sharks, {{and other}} fish {{found in their}} deep reef and volcanic slope habitats. Coelacanths are also known to swim head down, backwards or belly up to locate their prey, presumably using their rostral glands. Scientists suspect one reason this fish has <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>successful</b> is that specimens are able to slow down their metabolisms at will, sinking into the less-inhabited depths and minimizing their nutritional requirements {{in a sort of}} hibernation mode.|$|E

A new Honda factory in Guangzhou was built in 2004 solely for the export market and was expected to ship 30,000 passenger vehicles to Europe in 2005. By 2004, 12 major foreign automotive manufacturers had joint-venture plants in China. They produced {{a wide range of}} automobiles, minivans, sport utility vehicles, buses, and trucks. In 2003 China exported US$4.7billion worth of vehicles and components. The vehicle export was 78,000 units in 2004, 173,000 units in 2005, and 340,000 units in 2006. The vehicle and component export is targeted to reach US$70billion by 2010.|$|E
25|$|Detroit's economy fell {{greatly to}} the Great Recession, causing {{airlines}} such as British Airways to drop flights to London–Heathrow and other airlines such as KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and Virgin Atlantic to utilize codeshare flights through Delta Air Lines. While the city has lost population, Detroit Airport has since re-grown, and airlines are looking to expand or begin service once again. JetBlue Airways began flights to Boston, which have <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>successful</b> that the airline began a Fort Lauderdale service on April 30, 2015, and has been looking to expand service to Orlando, and New York–JFK. United Airlines has announced the return of nonstop flights to San Francisco in June 2017 in efforts to boost competition in Detroit. Spirit Airlines has also grown in the Detroit market, adding service to more East and West Coast cities.|$|E
25|$|The {{team that}} had <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>successful</b> in the 1990s began to break up {{at the start of}} the 2000s. Since winning their last trophy in 1998, the team has lost eight semi-finals and two finals. In 2008 Lancashire managed to finish second in the County Championship. The {{competition}} was divided into two divisions for the 2000 season, with Lancashire in the first division. Lancashire's one day form began to fluctuate in 2000, losing to Gloucestershire in the semi-finals of both the B Cup and the NatWest Trophy, and being relegated in the National League. In 2001, Lancashire avoided relegation by just 5 points and were not promoted in the National League. The end of the season saw the retirement of Ian Austin from first-class cricket and of Mike Atherton from all forms of cricket. John Crawley left the club in the winter after not being retained as captain. Between 2001 and 2002 saw the squad change significantly, with players recruited from Essex, Northamptonshire, Worcestershire, and Yorkshire; the most notable additions to the squad were Stuart Law and David Byas– the Yorkshire captain of the previous season. After a quiet 2001 season– finishing mid-table in the county championship and again failing to secure promotion in the National League– 2002 was far more encouraging. Mike Watkinson was appointed cricket manager, and Stuart Law and Alec Swann both scored over 1,000 first-class runs and Peter Martin and Glen Chapple both took more than 50wickets; the find of the season was that of James Anderson, who burst onto the scene with 50wickets in the second half of the season, earning him a promotion to the England side. At the end of the season, Lancashire stalwarts Neil Fairbrother and Graham Lloyd retired.|$|E
