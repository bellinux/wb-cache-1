5|$|Steep {{contacts}} between the thick basal <b>breccia</b> of Mount Silverthrone and older crystalline rocks of adjacent peaks {{suggest that the}} <b>breccia</b> {{is part of a}} caldera-fill succession. The presence of irregular subvolcanic intrusions and a profusion of dikes within the breccia—but not in adjacent country rock—provide further evidence of the Silverthrone Caldera. Potassium-argon dates of 750,000 and 400,000 years on rhyolitic lava domes above the basal <b>breccia</b> are consistent with the high rates of uplift and erosion recorded elsewhere in the Coast Mountains.|$|E

40|$|Lunar impact-melt <b>breccias</b> contain metal grains {{from the}} meteorites {{that formed the}} <b>breccias.</b> Because the <b>breccias</b> contain clastic {{material}} that may derive from older <b>breccias,</b> metal grains from earlier impacts may be present, too. The large subset of moderately mafic (8 - 12 % FeO), KREEP-rich ("LKFM") melt <b>breccias</b> is particularly important because: (1) these are the melt <b>breccias</b> {{most likely to have}} been produced in basin-forming impacts, (2) it is from these <b>breccias</b> that many of the approx. 3. 9 Gyr ages that are so common in lunar samples derive, (3) the <b>breccias</b> contain large proportions of FeNi metal, more than 1 % in some types of Apollo 16 <b>breccias,</b> and (4) the metal potentially provides information about the impactors causing the apparent cataclysm at 3. 9 Gyr...|$|R
40|$|Meteorite <b>breccias</b> provide {{information}} about impact processes on planetary bodies, their collisional evolution and structure. Fragmental and regolith <b>breccias</b> are abundant in both differentiated and chondritic meteorite groups and together with rarer impact melt rocks provide constraints on cratering events and catastrophic impacts on asteroids. These <b>breccias</b> also constrain the stratigraphy of differentiated and chondritic asteroids and the relative abundance of different rock types among projectiles. Accretional chondritic <b>breccias</b> formed at low impact speeds (typically tens or hundreds of m/s), while other <b>breccias</b> reflect hypervelocity impacts at higher speeds (~ 5 km/s) after asteroidal orbits were dynamically excited. Iron and stony-iron meteorite <b>breccias</b> only formed, when their parent bodies were partly molten. Polymict fragmental <b>breccias</b> and regolith <b>breccias</b> in some meteorite groups contain unique types of clasts that do not occur as individual meteorites in our collections. For example ureilite <b>breccias</b> contain feldspathic clasts from the ureilite parent body as well as carbonaceous chondritic projectile material.

40|$|The Apollo 16 {{regolith}} <b>breccias</b> {{were characterized}} {{in terms of}} petrography, grain-size distribution, porosity, major and trace element composition, noble gas contents, and ferromagnetic resonance properties. Significant variation was found with respect to density and porosity; the more dense <b>breccias</b> displayed substantial shock damage. The <b>breccias</b> resembled the soils in grain-size distribution and in petrological components, though many {{were found to be}} compositionally different from the Apollo 16 soils in that a mafic component was lacking. Nearly all <b>breccias</b> showed evidence of irradiation at the lunar surface, and analyses of disaggregated <b>breccias</b> indicated that this irradiation occurred before compaction. The concentration of surface irradiation parameters were far less than those of lunar soils or <b>breccias</b> of other Apollo missions. Observations with respect to the argon isotope ratio and Xe presence have led to the possibility that breccia-surface irradiation occurred as early as four billion years ago, and that most Apollo 16 regolith <b>breccias</b> were not formed from any known Apollo 16 soil...|$|R
40|$|Six lunar <b>breccias</b> {{were studied}} in detail by optical and {{transmission}} electron microscopy and separated into two classes {{on the basis of}} presence or absence of recovery and recrystallization textures: Class A <b>breccias</b> with no recrystallization include samples 14063, 14301, and 15498; Class B <b>breccias</b> with recrystallization include samples 14321, 15455, and 15418. Samples of Apollo 16 soil (65010) experimentally shocked to 50, 100, and 250 kilobars pressure were sectioned and studied for comparison with the <b>breccias.</b> It is concluded that the Class A <b>breccias</b> were formed from unconsolidated lunar regolith by deformation due to shock waves of a few tens of kilobars. The Class B <b>breccias</b> could also have been produced from unconsolidated material at higher shock stresses, the annealing being achieved by the heating resulting from the shock deformation...|$|R
5|$|Before the {{construction}} of the Bjorøy Tunnel, the geology of the area was thought to consist entirely of metamorphic basement rocks similar to those exposed on the surrounding islands. The Jurassic sediments encountered in the tunnel included <b>breccia</b> and conglomerate in contact with the underlying gneisses and a sandstone with coal fragments, some of which was quite unconsolidated. Spore and pollen samples gave an Oxfordian age (Late Jurassic) for the sequence. The sedimentary rocks appear to have been deposited into an eroded depression caused by a fault zone, which later reactivated, disrupting the bedding and causing steep dips.|$|E
5|$|Claims {{to three}} lode mines {{and a single}} coal mine were made within the Goat Rocks Wilderness, but the United States Bureau of Mines has no record of {{production}} from any of these claims. Historically, two claims have actually been staked in the area, the Mosquito lode near Walupt Lake in 1934, and later, the Glacier lode near Packwood Glacier in 1939. Neither show evidence of assessment work, and both deposits are now abandoned. Miners may have been drawn to the area by news of lode deposits containing gold, silver, and copper along <b>breccia</b> and shear zones {{to the north of}} the wilderness area.|$|E
5|$|Data {{collected}} on Apollo 17 {{show that the}} valley is composed primarily of feldspar-rich <b>breccia</b> in the large massifs surrounding the valley and basalt underlying the valley floor, covered by an unconsolidated layer of regolith, or mixed materials, formed by various geologic events.

40|$|On the Dinaric {{carbonate}} platform along {{the margin of}} the Upper Malmian shelf carbonate <b>breccias</b> were formed. The most typical, various and extended <b>breccias</b> outcrop at Korinj in the Suha Krajina area.

The study shows that <b>breccias</b> from different stratigraphiclevels were formed in different ways and environments. Generally, the sedimentary succession consists of limestones, dolomites and carbonate <b>breccias.</b> The sedimentary structures of the succession indicate high energy shallow-water environment.

5|$|Remains of Megalomys audreyae {{were found}} by John Walter Gregory among cave <b>breccia</b> on Barbuda around 1900. The exact {{locality}} is unknown. In his 1901 description of Oryzomys luciae, Charles Immanuel Forsyth Major mentioned the Barbuda animal as {{another member of}} the Megalomys group, but he never published a description of the latter. Édouard Louis Trouessart gave the name Oryzomys (Megalomys) majori to it in his Catalogus Mammalium, but he did not describe it and therefore the name is a nomen nudum.

40|$|It is {{proposed}} that Apollo 14 type <b>breccias</b> lithify by sintering of particles of matrix glass under stress-free conditions. Meteorite impacts generate the heat necessary for sintering. Compacted angular particles of glass with {{the composition of}} an Apollo 14 rock were sintered experimentally. Loose clods of sub 37 micron grains form in several days at 700 C. Synthetic rocks, which texturally resemble the <b>breccias,</b> were produced at 795 C and above in 7. 5 hours. Glass devitrified with increasing temperature. At 850 C, devitrification prevents much further densification of the synthetic <b>breccias</b> after 2 hours. Experiments compressing glass at 500 bars at 600 C produced dense vitreous masses which did not resemble lunar <b>breccias.</b> Confining pressure does not {{play a major role}} in lithifying the <b>breccias.</b> It is concluded that Apollo 14 type lunar <b>breccias</b> form at shallow depths at 800 C+ in a period of minutes to days...|$|R
40|$|The Apollo 14 <b>breccias</b> {{are complex}} and are {{characterized}} by {{a wide range of}} clast types and textures. The principal fragment types in the <b>breccias</b> are (1) hornfelsed noritic microbreccias; (2) micronorite hornfels; (3) devitrified glass; and (4) ophitic and other kinds of basalt. Based on fragment population, nature of the matrix, grain size and porosity, metamorphic history, and bulk chemical composition, the Apollo 14 <b>breccias</b> can be classified chiefly into regolith microbreccias, Fra Mauro <b>breccias,</b> and spherule-rich microbreccias. Further subdivisions are based principally on the interpretation of metamorphic history. Twenty-six Apollo 14 <b>breccias</b> have been so classified. The complex fragment types contained in Apollo 14 <b>breccias</b> represent multiple episodes of heating and fragmentation. They probably are pre-Imbrian and were not produced by the impact effects of a single event. The variability of their fragment populations is important in the interpretation of pre-Imbrian geologic history...|$|R
5|$|The 1908 Ordnance Survey map of Gibraltar reveals Flat Bastion Magazine {{within the}} east side of the bastion. The British version of the {{magazine}} dates back to at least 1873, as documented on a keystone above one of the magazine's doorways (pictured right). It is considered likely that a magazine was present at that site previously. The magazine was constructed on scree <b>breccia,</b> with underlying limestone bedrock.

5|$|Evidence {{from the}} Apollo 17 mission {{shows that the}} massifs {{surrounding}} the valley are composed primarily of feldspar-rich <b>breccia</b> and that basalt underlies the valley floor, {{a result of the}} lava flows during the valley's history. Seismic studies suggest that the basalt below the valley floor is about 1400 metres (4593.2feet) thick. Above the layer of subfloor basalt lies a deposit of unconsolidated material of various compositions ranging from volcanic material to impact-formed regolith. The valley floor's unusually low albedo, or reflectivity, {{is a direct result of}} the volcanic material and glass beads located there. The deeper craters on the valley floor act as 'natural drill holes' and allowed the astronauts to sample the subfloor basalt. These basalt samples are composed primarily of plagioclase, but also contain amounts of clinopyroxene and other minerals.|$|E
5|$|Exposed {{along the}} Cheakamus River {{and its tributaries}} are the Cheakamus Valley basalts. Although not {{necessarily}} mapped {{as part of the}} Cayley field, this sequence of basaltic lava flows is geologically similar and comparable in age to volcanic features that are part of this volcanic field. At least four basaltic flows comprise the sequence and were deposited during periods of volcanic activity from an unknown vent between 0.01and 1.6million years ago. Pillow lava is abundant along the bases the flows, some of which are underlain by hyaloclastite <b>breccia.</b> In 1958, Canadian volcanologist Bill Mathews suggested that the lava flows were erupted during periods of subglacial activity and traveled through trenches or tunnels melted in glacial ice of the Fraser Glaciation. Mathews based this on the age of the underlying till, the existence of pillow lava close to the bottom of some lavas, indicating subaqueous volcanism, the columnar jointing {{at the edges of the}} lavas, indicating rapid cooling, and the absence of apparent palaeogeography.|$|E
40|$|The {{first step}} in a petrologic study must be a {{classification}} based on observed textures and mineralogy. Lunar rocks, may be classified into three major groups: (1) coarse-grained igneous rocks, (2) fine-grained igneous rocks and (3) <b>breccias.</b> Group 1 is interpreted as primitive lunar crustal rocks that display various degrees of crushing and/or annealing. Group 2 is interpreted as volcanic rocks. Group 3 is interpreted as resulting from impacts on the lunar surface and is subdivided on the basis of matrix textures into fragmental <b>breccias,</b> crystalline <b>breccias</b> that have been annealed, and crystalline <b>breccias</b> with igneous matrices. A synthesis of the relevant data concerning lunar highlands polymict <b>breccias</b> from the fields of petrography, chemistry, photogeology, and impact studies compels the prediction that the <b>breccias</b> should have homogeneous matrices from rock to rock within regions of the highlands of limited size where impact mixing has been efficient and extensive...|$|R

Evidence points to pristine norites as substantial contributors to highlands breccias; the bulk major element compositions of <b>breccias</b> average noritic anorthosite, and norites are the second-most abundant of pristine samples. In addition, plots of element abundances in <b>breccias</b> indicate that KREEP in highlands <b>breccias</b> is not of Apollo 14 composition but is higher in Ti and Sc, and probably lower in incompatibles...|$|R
40|$|We have {{examined}} unmineralized and weakly mineralized magnetite-matrix hydrothermal <b>breccias</b> from the Cloncurry region, Australia. These <b>breccias</b> {{are similar in}} texture and mineralogy to regional and international IOCG deposits. Comparing mineralized and barren hydrothermal <b>breccias</b> affords {{a rare opportunity to}} define the critical factors that must be present to generate economic Cu-Au mineralization. Such comparisons also may lead to geochemical features that fingerprint mineralization. Here we compare rock textures, mineralogy, magnetite trace element geochemistry, and fluid inclusion petrography and geochemistry among barren magnetite <b>breccias</b> and IOCG deposits from Australia and Brazil. Magnetite from barren <b>breccias</b> is enriched in V and depleted in Mn relative to ore-related magnetite from Ernest Henry Cu-Au deposit. In contrast, fluid inclusion compositions in the barren <b>breccias</b> are similar to compositions of fluids from the Carajas IOCG deposits, Brazil, both of which differ markedly from brines related to porphyry copper mineralization. The similarity in brine composition between IOCG fluids and fluids from barren magnetite <b>breccias</b> suggests similar brine sources and fluid-rock reaction pathways for both mineralized and unmineralized systems, while the difference in magnetite chemistry may result from mineral equilibrium assemblage at the site of magnetite deposition...|$|R

Soils were further enriched over the millennia by alluvial deposits from the River Taff. The bedrock under the whole area is predominantly sandstone, dating from both the Devonian period (Old Red Sandstone) and the Triassic (New Red Sandstone) laid down in arid conditions. These may subsequently have been ground down by the Taff valley glacier during the last ice age around 18,000 years ago.

5|$|The ancient font by {{the west}} door dates from the twelfth century, and has an arcaded basin. The plain pointed arch forms the only {{ornament}} on the font, which has an octagonal ashlar shaft now mounted on a platform, and supporting the octagonal basin. Unfortunately the font has been subject to extensive and clumsy repair. Unusually, it is made of Purbeck marble, which is normally found in churches in south and eastern England; the only other example in Wales is in St David's Cathedral. Documentary {{evidence suggests that the}} massive stem dates from at least the nineteenth century, and stylistic evidence suggests that it is probably a lot earlier; the font basin itself is undoubtedly ancient. Seddon's restoration work in the church commenced in 1869, and included dismantling the font.

5|$|The {{sapphire}} bearing Yogo dike is a {{dark gray}} to green intrusive rock known as a lamprophyre. The lamprophyre is an unusual igneous rock that contains a low content of silica. The rock has a porphyritic texture with large crystals of orthopyroxene and phlogopite set in a fine grained matrix. The phlogopite crystals {{have been used to}} determine the age of the dike and its crystallization temperature (900°C (1,650°F)). The dike also contains fragments of other rock types. These xenoliths include pieces of limestone, clastic sedimentary rocks, and gneiss. In some locations, due to the abundance of xenoliths, the dike has the appearance of a limestone <b>breccia</b> in an igneous matrix. One gneiss fragment found as a xenolith contains corundum. The Yogo sapphires themselves are rimmed with a reaction layer of spinel and are etched, indicating that the sapphires were not in chemical equilibrium with their host, the lamprophyre magma. This suggests the sapphire crystals may have originated in an earlier rock, such as a corundum-bearing gneiss, later assimilated by the lamprophyre magma at depth. Earlier investigators had assumed that the sapphire had crystallized from the magma with the necessary high aluminium content provided by assimilation of clay rich shales of the Proterozoic Belt Supergroup sediments which are known to be present at depth in the region.|$|E
