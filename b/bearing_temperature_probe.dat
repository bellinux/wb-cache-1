Moreover, when the phonon re-emits into the system from the <b>temperature</b> <b>probe,</b> energy changing is necessary to realize thermal rectification. Another necessary condition is the different asymmetries for phonons with different frequencies, which is reflected by the dependence of the ratio _RC(!) /_RL(!) on !, the phonon’s frequency, where _RC(!) and _RL(!) are respectively the transmission coefficients from two asymmetric terminals to the <b>temperature</b> <b>probe.</b> The analytical results areconfirmed by extensive numerical simulations...|$|R

40|$|An {{experimental}} study {{of the influence of}} applied load and oil supply temperature on the performance of a 100 mm plain journal bearing with two axial grooves located at ± 90 º to the load line has been carried out. Hydrodynamic pressure at the mid-plane of the <b>bearing,</b> <b>temperature</b> profiles at the oil-bush and oil-shaft interfaces, bush torque, oil flow rate and shaft position were measured for variable operating conditions. The applied load varied from 2 to 10 kN, whereas the supply temperature ranged from 35 to 50 ºC. Bearing performance is strongly dependent on these parameters. It was found that the cooling effect of the downstream groove increases when the applied load increases. The opposite occurs with the upstream groove. Shaft temperature was found to be close to the maximum <b>bearing</b> <b>temperature</b> for low applied loads, but was significantly lower than this value for high loads.
