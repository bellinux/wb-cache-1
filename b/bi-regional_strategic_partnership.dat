The study concludes with tailor-made recommendations in order to advance the EU’s engagement and cooperation with individual Latin American countries and with the region as a whole, both through traditional cooperative channels and through closer parliamentary links within the framework of EuroLat. nrpages: 87 status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|As negociações entre União Europeia e Mercosul com o objetivo de estabelecer uma relação estratégica birregional e um acordo {{comercial}} estão estagnadas desde 2004. Mesmo assim, o comércio vem aumentando substancialmente, e a UE consolidou-se como principal origem dos Investimentos Diretos Externos na região. Em consequência da crise financeira e econômica, está ocorrendo um refluxo das instituições multilaterais, particularmente da Organização Mundial do Comércio, impulsionando, mesmo que por motivos distintos, a reabertura das negociações entre ambos os blocos. Neste quadro, a entrada em vigor do Tratado de Lisboa introduziu modificações no design institucional europeu, que alteraram o quadro normativo no qual as negociações ocorrem. The {{negotiations between}} the EU and Mercosul with the objective {{to set up a}} <b>strategic</b> <b>bi-regional</b> <b>partnership</b> and a trade agreement are stagnant since the year 2004. Even with the interruption of the negotiation process, the trade flows between the two regions have been increasing substantially, and the EU has consolidated its position as the main source of Foreign Direct Investment in the Mercosul. On the other hand, one of the consequences of the global crisis is the retrocession of the role of Multilateral Institutions, particularly the case of the World Trade Organization, which stimulate the retaking of inter-regional block negotiations. In this relative new world configuration, the adoption of the Lisbon Treaty by all the EU-members introduces changes in the European institutional design of regional integration, which have affected the normative framework of international negotiations. The aim of the present paper is to address the effects of the Lisbon Treaty on the foreign trade policy of the EU, as well as the effects on the relationships between the EU and Latin America...|$|R

40|$|Bilateral <b>strategic</b> <b>partnerships</b> {{between the}} European Union (EU) and major global actors are an {{emerging}} feature of EU foreign policy. This chapter reviews the ongoing academic and policy debates {{on the concept}} and practice of <b>strategic</b> <b>partnerships,</b> highlighting the considerable scepticism surrounding their development. It goes on to argue that, despite their flaws, <b>strategic</b> <b>partnerships</b> are an important and multi-purpose tool in the EU foreign policy arsenal, potentially fulfilling reflexive, relational and structural goals at once. Based on this original analytical perspective, the chapter suggests that <b>strategic</b> <b>partnerships</b> are those that help pave the way from bilateral transactions to cooperation in broader mini-lateral and multilateral formats. After reviewing the performance of EU <b>strategic</b> <b>partnerships</b> at these three levels of analysis, and delivering a sobering but not dismissive picture of their output to date, the chapter addresses {{the connection between the}} EU discourse on <b>strategic</b> <b>partnerships</b> and policy-making in the postLisbon institutional context. It detects piecemeal progress in agenda-setting and representation but exposes a serious deficit of coordination among EU bodies and with member states, which as yet prevents the EU from devising an integrated approach to its <b>strategic</b> <b>partnerships.</b> SCOPUS: ch. binfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

40|$|When the EU and South Africa acceded to a <b>strategic</b> <b>partnership,</b> they {{expanded}} into new areas of partnership. One {{of these areas}} was peace and security, which {{is the focus of}} this article. The article argues that although {{there appears to be a}} shared understanding of what security means, the <b>strategic</b> <b>partnership</b> has not been utilised significantly to further this understanding in practice. This is largely due to the EU’s preferences for a continental, multilateral approach over the bilateralism of a <b>strategic</b> <b>partnership.</b> At the same time, South Africa sees its <b>strategic</b> <b>partnership</b> with the EU as being outside of its broader commitment to regional security. As a result the peace and security element of the <b>strategic</b> <b>partnership</b> has not been leveraged effectively despite several entry points for action. The article thus concludes that both the EU and South Africa need to re-think the current arrangement...|$|R
