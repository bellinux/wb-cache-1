The three shared interests in survivalism. They expressed anger at the federal government's handling of the 1992 Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) standoff with Randy Weaver at Ruby Ridge {{as well as the}} Waco siege—a 1993 51-day standoff between the FBI and Branch Davidian members which began with a botched ATF attempt to execute a search warrant leading to a fire fight (it is unknown whether ATF agents or <b>Branch</b> <b>Davidians</b> fired the first shot) and ended with the burning and shooting deaths of David Koresh and 75others. In March 1993, McVeigh visited the Waco site during the standoff, and then again after its conclusion. McVeigh later decided to bomb a federal building {{as a response to the}} raids.|$|E

Snow recounts results from a study of 353 former members of 48 cults in the United States, who recounted experiences after leaving their respective groups. After leaving the groups, 23 percent of former members stated they had attempted suicide, 63 percent had suicidal ideation, and 93 percent had experienced anxiety attacks. Snow devotes a chapter to deprogramming and advice on how individuals can avoid joining these groups from the outset.|$|E
25|$|During the 1993 Waco Siege of the <b>Branch</b> <b>Davidians,</b> {{elements}} of the Alabama and Texas Army National Guard were called in to assist the ATF and the follow on effort by the Federal Bureau of Investigation; the National Guard's involvement was limited to several specific areas; surveillance and reconnaissance, transport, maintenance and repairs, training and instruction, helicopters, unarmed tactical ground vehicles. The Army National Guard helicopters were also used to do photographic reconnaissance work. Training for ATF agents included such subjects as Close Quarters Combat, and combat medical instruction, and a mock up of the Mount Carmel complex was constructed at Fort Hood, Texas for rehearsals. ATF also received several surplus helmets, flack vests, canteens, first aid dressings, empty magazines, and some night-vision equipment, in addition to MREs and diesel fuel. The FBI would request and receive the use of Bradley Armored Fighting Vehicles, and tank retrieval vehicles, as well as overflights by UH-1 and CH-47 helicopters.|$|E

In 2003 testimony submitted to the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee Barr wrote: [...] "here remains time to turn back the constitutional clock and roll back excessive post-9/11 powers before we turn the corner into another Japanese internment or, closer to our own experiences, before we witness a legally sanctioned Ruby Ridge or Waco scenario." ...|$|E

Allegedly, the children had been physically and sexually abused long before the raid.On April 19, 1993 the FBI moved for a final siege of the compound using large weaponry such as [...]50 caliber (12.7 mm) rifles and armored Combat Engineering Vehicles (CEV) to combat the heavily armed <b>Branch</b> <b>Davidians.</b> The FBI attempted to use tear gas to flush out the <b>Branch</b> <b>Davidians</b> without bloodshed.

The film challenged the mainstream news reports of the <b>Branch</b> <b>Davidian</b> siege and created a small sensation, alleging a government coverup of the events surrounding the siege.

The legal case between her and surviving Koresh loyalists is still being fought in the courts, but has taken a twist following the recent takeover of the site by Charles Pace, another <b>Branch</b> <b>Davidian</b> leader. Amo Roden also drew attention in 2001, when she drove to the Oklahoma City bombing memorial site in her pickup truck with <b>Branch</b> <b>Davidian</b> slogans, creating a brief bomb scare.|$|R
