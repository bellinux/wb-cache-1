5|$|Since 1966, over 630,000 men, 100,000 tons of foodstuffs, 400,000 weapons, and 50,000 tons of {{ammunition}} had traveled {{through the maze}} of gravel and dirt roads, paths, and river transportation systems that crisscrossed southeastern Laos. The trail also linked up with a similar logistical system in neighboring Cambodia known as the Sihanouk Trail. However, following the overthrow of Prince Norodom Sihanouk in 1970, the pro-American Lon Nol regime had denied the use of the port of Sihanoukville to communist shipping. Strategically, this was an enormous <b>blow</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> North Vietnamese effort, since 70 percent of all military supplies that supported its effort in the far south had moved through the port. A further <b>blow</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> logistical system in Cambodia had come {{in the spring and summer}} of 1970, when U.S. and ARVN forces had crossed the border and attacked PAVN/NLF Base Areas during the Cambodian Campaign.|$|E

5|$|Both of the {{targeted}} airfields contained sector operations rooms {{from which the}} British fighters were directed into action.

5|$|In the 17th century, Banagher was {{the centre}} of a flourishing woollen trade. In 1699, the impost placed on the export of woollen goods to England {{practically}} killed the woollen trade.
