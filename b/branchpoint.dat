25|$|This is {{an example}} of exon skipping. The intron {{upstream}} from exon 4 has a polypyrimidine tract that doesn't match the consensus sequence well, so that U2AF proteins bind poorly to it without assistance from splicing activators. This 3' splice acceptor site is therefore not used in males. Females, however, produce the splicing activator Transformer (Tra) (see below). The SR protein Tra2 is produced in both sexes and binds to an ESE in exon 4; if Tra is present, it binds to Tra2 and, along with another SR protein, forms a complex that assists U2AF proteins in binding to the weak polypyrimidine tract. U2 is recruited to the associated <b>branchpoint,</b> and this leads to inclusion of exon 4 in the mRNA.|$|E

We now demonstrate that GRP and GRP receptor genes {{are expressed in}} fetal mouse lung as early as embryonic day 12 (E 12), when lung buds are beginning to branch. By in situ hybridization, GRP receptor transcripts were at highest levels in mesenchymal cells at cleft regions of branching airways and blood vessels. To explore the possibility that bombesin-like peptides might {{play a role in}} branching morphogenesis, E 12 lung buds were cultured for 48 hr in serum-free medium. In the presence of 0. 10 - 10 microM bombesin, branching was significantly augmented as compared with control cultures, with a peak of 94 % above control values at 1 microM (P < 0. 005). The bombesin receptor antagonist [Leu 13 - psi(CH 2 NH) Leu 14]bombesin alone (100 nM) had no effect on baseline branching but completely abolished bombesin-induced branching. A bombesin-related peptide, [Leu 8]phyllolitorin also increased branching (65 % above control values at 10 nM, P < 0. 005). [Leu 8]Phyllolitorin also significantly augmented thymidine incorporation in cultured lung buds. Fibronectin, which is abundant at <b>branchpoints,</b> induces GRP gene expression in undifferentiated cell lines. These observations suggest that BLPs secreted by pulmonary neuroendocrine cells may contribute to lung branching morphogenesis. Furthermore, components of <b>branchpoints</b> may induce pulmonary neuroendocrine cell differentiation as part of a positive feedback loop, which could account in part for the high prevalence of these cells at <b>branchpoints...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Modern {{multislice}} X-ray CT scanners provide high-resolution volumetric {{image data}} containing {{a wealth of}} structural and functional information. The size of the volumes makes it {{more and more difficult}} for human observers to visually evaluate their contents. Similar to other areas of medical image analysis, highly automated extraction and quantitative assessment of volumetric data is increasingly important in pulmonary physiology, diagnosis, and treatment. We present a method for a fully automated segmentation of a human airway tree, its skeletonization, identification of airway branches and <b>branchpoints,</b> as well as a method for matching the airway trees, branches, and <b>branchpoints</b> for the same subject over time and across subjects. The validation of our method shows a high correlation between the automatically obtained results and reference data provided by human observers. ...|$|R

We have {{investigated}} what {{internal and external}} signals spatially direct mitosis within these hyphal cells. Mitoses are most common near cortical septin rings found at growing tips and <b>branchpoints.</b> In septin mutants, mitoses are no longer concentrated at <b>branchpoints,</b> suggesting that the septin rings function to locally promote mitosis near new branches. Similarly, cells lacking AgSwe 1 p kinase (a Wee 1 homologue), AgHsl 1 p (a Nim 1 -related kinase), and AgMih 1 p phosphatase (the Cdc 25 homologue that likely counteracts AgSwe 1 p activity) also have mitoses distributed randomly in the hyphae as opposed to at <b>branchpoints.</b> Surprisingly, however, no phosphorylation of the CDK tyrosine 18 residue, the conserved substrate of Swe 1 p kinases, was detected in normally growing cells. In contrast, abundant CDK tyrosine phosphorylation was apparent in starving cells, resulting in diminished nuclear density. This starvation-induced CDK phosphorylation is AgSwe 1 p dependent, and overexpressed AgSwe 1 p is sufficient to delay nuclei even in rich nutrient conditions. In starving cells lacking septins or AgSwe 1 p negative regulators, the nuclear density is further diminished compared with wild type. We have generated a model in which AgSwe 1 p may regulate mitosis in response to cell intrinsic morphogenesis cues and external nutrient availability in multinucleated cells...|$|R

50|$|U2 spliceosomal RNA {{is a small}} nuclear RNA (snRNA) {{component}} of the spliceosome (involved in pre-mRNA splicing). Complementary binding between U2 snRNA (in an area lying towards the 5′ end but 3′ to hairpin I) and the <b>branchpoint</b> sequence (BPS) of the intron results in the bulging out of an unpaired adenosine, on the BPS, which initiates a nucleophilic attack at the intronic 5′ splice site, thus starting {{the first of two}} transesterification reactions that mediate splicing.|$|E
50|$|Spliceosomal and self-splicing {{transesterification}} reactions occur via two sequential transesterification reactions. First, the 2'OH of {{a specific}} <b>branchpoint</b> nucleotide within the intron, defined during spliceosome assembly, performs a nucleophilic attack on the first nucleotide of the intron at the 5' splice site, forming the lariat intermediate. Second, the 3'OH of the released 5' exon then performs a nucleophilic attack at the first nucleotide following the last nucleotide of the intron at the 3' splice site, thus joining the exons and releasing the intron lariat.|$|E

In this work, a hierarchical tree search algorithm is proposed, which efficiently computes a matching between <b>branchpoints</b> of anatomical trees, which can be used as landmarks for an elastic registration. The algorithm is designed to be general and robust in order to be applicable to a variety of different datasets, which are acquired by different sensors or under different conditions.

40|$|Recently, we {{discovered}} a new role for the well-known axonal growth inhibitory molecule Nogo-A as a negative regulator of angiogenesis in the developing central nervous system. However, how Nogo-A affected the three-dimensional (3 D) central nervous system (CNS) vascular network architecture remained unknown. Here, using vascular corrosion casting, hierarchical, synchrotron radiation μCT-based network imaging and computer-aided network analysis, we found that genetic ablation of Nogo-A significantly increased the three-dimensional vascular volume fraction in the postnatal day 10 (P 10) mouse brain. More {{detailed analysis of the}} cerebral cortex revealed that this effect was mainly due to an increased number of capillaries and capillary <b>branchpoints.</b> Interestingly, other vascular parameters such as vessel diameter, -length, -tortuosity, and -volume were comparable between both genotypes for non-capillary vessels and capillaries. Taken together, our three-dimensional data showing more vessel segments and <b>branchpoints</b> at unchanged vessel morphology suggest that stimulated angiogenesis upon Nogo-A gene deletion results in the insertion of complete capillary micro-networks and not just single vessels into existing vascular networks. These findings significantly enhance our understanding of how angiogenesis, vascular remodeling, and three-dimensional vessel network architecture are regulated during central nervous system development. Nogo-A may therefore be a potential novel target for angiogenesis-dependent central nervous system pathologies such as brain tumors or stroke. status: publishe...|$|R
50|$|During the {{formation}} of the spliceosome, the 5’ end of U11 and U12 snRNAs interact with the 5’ splice site and <b>branchpoint</b> sequence of the mRNA respectively, through base pairing. U11 snRNP binds to a tandem repeat known as U11 snRNP-binding splicing enhancer (USSE) and initiates the splicing process. Since both U11 and U12 snRNAs come together as a bicomplex, they form a molecular bridge between two ends of introns in the pre-spliceosomal complex. The U11-48K and U11/U12-65K proteins recognize the splice site of U12 type intron and stabilize the U11/U12 bi-complex. After activating the spliceosomal complex, U11 snRNA leaves the assembly.|$|E
