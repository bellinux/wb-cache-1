40|$|We {{present a}} novel {{approach}} to fast on-the-fly low order finite <b>element</b> <b>assembly</b> for scalar elliptic partial differential equations of Darcy type with variable coefficients optimized for matrix-free implementations. Our approach introduces a new operator that is obtained by appropriately scaling the reference stiffness matrix from the constant coefficient case. Assuming sufficient regularity, an a priori analysis shows that solutions obtained by this approach are unique and have asymptotically optimal order convergence in the H^ 1 - and the L^ 2 -norm on hierarchical hybrid grids. For the pre-asymptotic regime, we present a local modification that guarantees uniform ellipticity of the operator. Cost considerations show that our novel approach requires roughly {{one third of the}} floating-point operations compared to a classical finite <b>element</b> <b>assembly</b> scheme employing nodal integration. Our theoretical considerations are illustrated by numerical tests that confirm the expectations with respect to accuracy and run-time.
