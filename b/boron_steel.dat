40|$|Abstract This thesis {{studies the}} factors that govern {{transverse}} cracking during continuous casting of low carbon, niobium microalloyed and <b>boron</b> microalloyed <b>steels.</b> Crack susceptibility in the thick slab, billet and thin slab casting processes are compared by using typical conditions in laboratory hot ductility tests. There is limited published literature on hot ductility in aluminium-killed and siliconkilled <b>boron</b> microalloyed <b>steels</b> and the proposed mechanisms of failure by transverse cracking are contradictory. Few published papers specifically compare hot ductility behaviour of any steels between thick slab, billet and thin slab continuous casting processes. Thus, {{the basis of this}} research is to assess the influence of casting parameters and compositional variations on hot ductility behaviour in low carbon steels, niobium microalloyed <b>steels,</b> aluminium-killed <b>boron</b> microalloyed <b>steels</b> and silicon-killed, <b>boron</b> microalloyed <b>steels.</b> The typical temperature ranges, cooling rate and strain rate conditions of the continuous casting processes were used in reheated and in situ melted hot tensile tests performed on steel specimens. Solidification, transformation and precipitation temperatures were calculated using solubility equations and modelled using the Thermo-CalcTM thermodynamics program. Scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy were used to determine the modes of failure in the tested specimens. In the low carbon steels, hot ductility was improved by increasing the strain rate; by calcium treatment, which minimises copper sulphide and iron sulphide formation; and by maintaining a nickel to copper ratio of 1 : 1. It was shown that thin slab casting conditions provided the best hot ductility results for the low carbon steels. All the niobium steels showed poor ductility in the single-phase austenite temperature region, indicating that intergranular precipitation of fine niobium carbonitrides was the cause of the poor ductility. It was shown that the hot ductility was greatly improved by calcium treatment, by decreasing the cooling rate and by increasing the strain rate. Slow iv thin slab and thick slab casting conditions provided the best hot ductility results for the niobium steels. Hot ductility was substantially improved in the aluminium-killed <b>boron</b> <b>steels</b> by increasing the boron to nitrogen ratio from 0. 19 to 0. 75. The results showed that, at cooling rates generally associated with thick slab, bloom and slow thin slab casting, a boron to nitrogen ratio of ≥ 0. 47 was sufficient to avoid a ductility trough altogether. However, under conditions typically experienced in fast thin slab and billet casting, a boron to nitrogen ratio of 0. 75 was required to provide good hot ductility. The mechanism of the ductility improvement with increasing boron to nitrogen ratio was found to be enhanced precipitation of boron nitride, leading to a decrease in nitrogen available for aluminium nitride precipitation. In the silicon-killed <b>boron</b> <b>steels,</b> {{it was found that the}} boron to nitrogen ratio had the overriding influence on hot ductility and hence on crack susceptibility. Excellent hot ductility was found for boron to nitrogen ratios above 1. Additionally, analysis of industrial casting data showed that the scrap percentage due to transverse cracking increased significantly at manganese to sulphur ratios below fourteen. An exponential decay relationship between the manganese to sulphur ratio and the average scrap percentage due to transverse cracking was determined as a tool to predict scrap levels in the casting plant...|$|R

Boron is the important absorber used {{for the production of}} <b>boron</b> alloyed <b>steel</b> to serve in long term storage of spent nuclear fuel or nuclear waste disposals. Due to the high neutron absorption of <b>boron</b> compared to <b>steel,</b> the neutron radiography is a powerful tool for the nondestructive investigation. This paper concerns quantitative estimations of secondary effects on the neutron transmission measurements through thermal neutron shielding materials such as beam hardening, background, and inhomogeneous absorber distribution within the samples, which decrease the neutron attenuation in absorber materials.

40|$|High {{strength}} <b>boron</b> <b>steels</b> {{are commonly}} used as structural reinforcements or energy absorbing systems in automobile applications due to their favourable strength to weight ratios. The high strength of these steels leads to several problems during forming such as poor formability, increased spring back, and tendency to work-harden. In view of these difficulties, high strength <b>boron</b> <b>steels</b> are usually formed by press hardening at elevated temperatures {{with a view to}} facilitate forming and simultaneous hardening by quenching of complex shaped parts. The high strength steel sheets are used with an Al–Si coating with a view e. g. to prevent scaling of components during hot-metal forming. The Al-Si coated high strength steel can lead to problems with galling (i. e. material transfer from the coated sheet to the tool surface) which have a negative influence {{on the quality of the}} produced parts as well as the process economy. The available results in the open literature pertaining to high temperature galling are very scarce. With this in view, the friction and wear behaviours of different tool steel coatings and different roughness lay directions sliding against Al–Si-coated high-strength steel at elevated temperatures have been investigated by using a high-temperature reciprocating friction and wear tester at temperature of 900 °C. The results have shown that parallel sliding with respect to the surface roughness lay reduces the severity of galling compared to perpendicular sliding. None of the coatings included in this study have shown beneficial effects in view of galling. The DLC coating experienced less galling compared to the AlCrN and TiAlN.
