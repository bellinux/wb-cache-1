He thus decides that the <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> to focus on {{emptiness}} and think of Gaston.|$|E
500|$|Others {{have noted}} {{that the lack of}} {{coverage}} is not simply a media issue. Peter Fahy, the spokesman on race issues for the Association of Chief Police Officers said: [...] "A lot of police officers and other professionals feel almost the <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> to try and avoid [...] for fear of being criticised. This is not healthy". Montague suggests the lack of police appeals in cases involving white victims may be a cause of the lack of media coverage. Evidence of this was seen in the Parker case, with the police initially appearing keen to dismiss the possible racist aspect of the murder, stating [...] "there was {{no reason to believe that}} the attack was racially motivated".|$|E
500|$|... 2003 {{marked a}} {{significant}} {{turning point in}} Sarsgaard's career, when he starred in the feature film Shattered Glass. He depicted journalist Charles Lane, the lead editor of The New Republic. Shattered Glass {{is based on the}} real events of journalist Stephen Glass' career at The New Republic during the mid-1990s and his fall when his widespread journalistic fraud is exposed. During promotion of the film, Sarsgaard noted of his portrayal of Lane: [...] "I just wanted to get his perspective on the actual events. [...] I think that I tried to have some respect for myself and that way you're respecting the real person you're playing. I've done it a number of times. And it's always a little bit confusing. The <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> just to ignore the fact, I think, that you're playing somebody who is a real life character." [...] According to the San Diego Union-Tribune, [...] "Peter Sarsgaard is appealingly level, a stolid straight-shooter as Lane". A reviewer from the Chicago Tribune noted that Sarsgaard plays Lane with [...] "great subtlety and grace". The newspaper concluded with, [...] "The character doesn't seethe with personal resentment; when he does a slow burn, he conveys a much deeper sense of a man's value system being violated past the breaking point." [...] Sarsgaard's performance in the film earned him his first Golden Globe Award nomination and an Independent Spirit Award nomination.|$|E

2500|$|Both [...] "deaf" [...] and [...] "heaven" [...] (here scanned as one syllable) have tonic stress, {{but that}} of [...] "deaf" [...] is {{normally}} subordinated to that of [...] "heaven", allowing them comfortably to fill odd/even positions, but not even/odd. A reversal of the third ictus (as shown above) is normally preceded by at least a slight intonational break, which [...] "deaf heaven" [...] does not allow. Peter Groves calls this a [...] "harsh mapping", and recommends that in performance [...] "the <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> to prolong the subordinated S-syllable ... {{the effect of this}} is to throw a degree of emphasis on it".|$|E
2500|$|Mr Dinos {{remained}} in {{training as a}} six-year-old but failed to regain his old form. After an absence of a year he started a 20/1 outsider for the 2005 [...] "Ascot" [...] Gold Cup which was run at York and never looked likely to win, finishing eighth behind Westerner. He was then dropped in class for the Listed Esher Stakes over two miles at Sandown on 2 July. After racing in second place {{for most of the}} way he dropped away in the straight and finished fifth of the seven runners. He suffered further injury problems and was retired from racing {{at the end of the}} year. Cole said that the horse was never the same after the 2004 Gold Cup and added [...] "He's a horse who owes us nothing, and the <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> retire him".|$|E

So you drink it and get all the nutrients, and also it gets in your body faster because your body doesn’t have to break it down or anything. Juicing is one of the <b>best</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> heal or replenish your body and get rid of all the toxins ...
