She insisted on playing it on everything {{so we had to}} figure out ways to separate her voice from it as much as possible and then find instrumental voices that would be compatible with the harmonium track... As an arranger you're usually trying to take the songs and put a structure on them, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> thought was valuable was when you took the centre out of the track and worked around the central core of the tonality and changes. That left you with a sort of floating free-form tapestry behind what she was doing, which is when things became more abstract.|$|E

500|$|Ben Croshaw of Zero Punctuation {{gave the}} game the only entirely {{positive}} review in the show's history, calling it [...] "the most fun you'll have with your PC until they invent a force-feedback codpiece". Croshaw went on to say: [...] "I went in expecting a slew of interesting portal-based puzzles and that's exactly what I got, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> wasn't expecting was some of the funniest pitch black humor I've ever heard in a game". He states that, while the game was short, the two- to three-hour length of the game was perfect as the game did not outstay its welcome, and called the ending [...] "balls-tighteningly fantastic", while praising the game as [...] "absolutely sublime from start to finish" [...] (adding that he would jam forks in his eyes if he ever praised a game so highly ever again).|$|E

[...] Due to band's various misfortunes with the suicide of band members, Toshi's {{brainwashing}} and lack of overseas success, X Japan have been described in The Times as: [...] "The world's unluckiest band", {{in an article published}} on Friday the 13th October, 2017. When asked in an interview if the band was unlucky, Yoshiki answered: [...] "Kinda? I mean, you know, with so much crazy drama that has happened over the years. But at the same time, we have amazing fans around the world so I can't say 'the world's unluckiest band', <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> can say is 'the world's luckiest band'.

After a day of fasting, the Assembly took a vow, as directed by Parliament, to [...] "not maintain any thing in Matters of Doctrine, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> think, in my conscience, to be truth". The divines organized themselves into three standing committees, though each committee was open to any member of the Assembly. The committees would be assigned topics and prepare propositions for debate in the full Assembly following each morning of committee meetings. In addition, over 200 ad hoc committees were appointed for tasks such as examination of candidate preachers, college fellows, and suspected heretics.|$|E
500|$|... "Monster" [...] {{was written}} by Lady Gaga, RedOne and Space Cowboy, with RedOne {{producing}} the track. The song was recorded at the Record Plant Studio in Los Angeles. In an interview with MTV News, Gaga said that [...] "Monster" [...] describes her fear of sex and relationships and the literal meaning is about a [...] "guy with a big dick". She elaborated, [...] "It's the fear of attachment {{and the fear of}} loving something that's bad for you... If you listen to the lyrics, it's like being in love with the bad boy all the time, and you keep going back for more." [...] Gaga added that the fear in [...] "Monster" [...] erupted from her need to have a stable relationship. [...] "I keep falling in love with the monster... <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> really need is the security and the safety and the womanhood, responsibility of my femininity. And so that's what that song is about.|$|E
500|$|Makeba {{said that}} she did not perform {{political}} music, but music about her personal life in South Africa, which included describing the pain she felt living under apartheid. She once stated [...] "people say I sing politics, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> sing is not politics, it is the truth", an example of the mixing of personal and political issues for musicians living during apartheid. When she first entered the US, she avoided discussing apartheid explicitly, partly out of concern for her family still in South Africa. Nonetheless, she is known for using her voice to convey the political message of opposition to apartheid, performing widely and frequently for civil rights and anti-apartheid organisations. Even songs that did not carry an explicitly political message were seen as subversive, due to their being banned in South Africa. Makeba saw her music as a tool of activism, saying [...] "In our struggle, songs are not simply entertainment for us. They are the way we communicate." ...|$|E

500|$|Santer, {{who stood}} down as {{executive}} producer after the episode's transmission, succeeded by Bryan Kirkwood, commented {{that he was}} happy, relieved and proud with the broadcast. Santer stated: [...] "I just think everyone did brilliantly tonight—the cast, the crew, everyone. It's everything I wished for and more. I'm thrilled with how it went. It was quite remarkable. Everything went to plan. I spotted a couple of little wobbles <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> was proudest of was the recovery. The technical crew, the cast—every time we maybe veered slightly off course, they pulled it back round." [...] Santer explained that he had always intended for Stacey to be revealed as Archie's killer, and was never tempted to air a different conclusion, despite at least ten characters having strong motives. Turner {{was surprised to learn}} that Stacey was the killer, and hoped that viewers would sympathise with her character, observing: [...] "She not only has to deal with the guilt of what she did but she also knows that she's inadvertently responsible for Bradley's death. I think that's going to hurt her more than anything." ...|$|E
500|$|Throughout the video, Jackson shows {{a sexual}} {{attraction}} towards the dancing woman—played by Sybil Azur. Jackson caresses her ankle, calf, knee and thigh, {{and at one}} stage looks up her dress. The woman is then seen opening a flick knife as the pair engage in a final courtship dance. The video closes {{in the same manner}} it began, with the switchblade impaling the spray painted image. The music video won the Brazilian TVZ Video Award: Best International Music Video of the Year. Interviewed on her experience during the video one of the dancers, Carmit Bachar (of The Pussycat Dolls) noted, [...] "I was called in by Vincent Paterson for 'Blood on the Dance Floor'. It was to have a Latin feel, some sort of mambo. I arrived wearing a little salsa dress, fish nets, heels, and my hair was up in a kind of bun with a flower. I was 'camera ready'. I showed up with the whole outfit. It's not that producers can't see what they like, or the potential in somebody, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> do helps them to see their vision more".|$|E
500|$|He {{wished to}} set the film in a field he {{understood}} and opted for broadcast journalism. After talking with network journalists at the 1984 Republican National Convention, Brooks realised it had [...] "changed so much since I had been near it", and so [...] "did {{about a year and}} a half of solid research," [...] into the industry. When he began writing the screenplay, Brooks felt he [...] "didn't like any of the three [...] characters", but decided not to change them and after two months had reversed his original opinion. Brooks stated that this also happens to the audience: [...] "You're always supposed to arc your characters and you have this change and that's your dramatic purpose. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> hope happens in this film is that the audience takes part in the arc. So what happens is that the movie doesn't select its own hero. It plays differently with each audience. The audience helps create the experience, depending on which character they hook onto." [...] He did not decide on the ending of the film until the rest of it had been completed. Brooks was nominated for the Academy Awards for Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay for Broadcast News. At the 38th Berlin International Film Festival, the film was nominated for the Golden Bear and Holly Hunter won the Silver Bear for Best Actress.|$|E

500|$|The lyrics on {{the rock}} album {{tried to focus on}} [...] "general themes that {{everyone}} can get their hands on", while the acoustic had introspective lyrics that are [...] "vulnerable and revealing", with things Grohl [...] "wouldn't say out loud, wouldn't even admit to myself." [...] Grohl declared that [...] "when you're writing songs that have a sort of anthemic quality, you can't really go lighthearted and sing about bullshit. You have to dig into a deeper place to find the words", and that [...] "I don't know what it is about, this album, that makes it sound more heartfelt or deeper or more emotional, but when I listen to it, it really is." [...] These include [...] "Friend of a Friend", a song which Grohl wrote in the 1990s about himself and his former Nirvana bandmate Kurt Cobain during the time they shared an apartment together in 1990, and [...] "Still", talking about a suicide Grohl saw when he was ten in Virginia, by a boy who jumped on the train tracks. Much of the album's theme and content, including the title, came after Grohl spent time on the campaign trail with John Kerry during the 2004 presidential election. [...] "We'd pull in to small towns, and thousands of people would come to be rescued by this man", said Grohl. [...] "It's not a political record, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> saw inspired me." ...|$|E
500|$|There was {{significant}} resistance to this system, {{both within and}} outside South Africa. Opposition outside the country often took the form of boycotts of South Africa. Within the country, resistance ranged from loosely organised groups to tightly knit ones, and from non-violent protests to armed opposition from the African National Congress. Through this entire process, music played a large role in the resistance. Music had been used in South Africa to protest racial segregation before apartheid began in 1948. The ANC had been founded in 1912, and would begin and end its meetings with its anthem [...] "Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika", an early example of music in the resistance to racial segregation. Another such example was [...] "iLand Act" [...] by R. T. Caluza, which protested the Native Land Act, and was also adopted as an anthem by the ANC. Commentator Michela Vershbow has written that the music of the movement against apartheid and racial segregation [...] "reflected [...] widening gap" [...] between different racial groups and was also an attempt [...] "to communicate across it". Music in South Africa had begun to have explicitly political overtones in the 1930s, as musicians tried to include African elements in their recordings and performances to make political statements. In the 1940s, artists had begun to use music to criticise the state, not directly in response to racial segregation, but as a response to persecution of artists. Artists did not see their music as being directly political: Miriam Makeba would state [...] "people say I sing politics, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> sing is not politics, it is the truth".|$|E
