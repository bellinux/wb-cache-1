5|$|According to the Indonesian film scholar Misbach Yusa Biran, {{the films}} {{released}} {{during this period}} could not <b>be</b> <b>classified</b> <b>as</b> truly Indonesian films as {{there was no sense}} of nationalism within them. The American visual anthropologist Karl G. Heider writes that all films from before 1950 are lost. However, JB Kristanto's Katalog Film Indonesia (Indonesian Film Catalogue) records several as having survived at Sinematek Indonesia's archives, and Biran writes that several Japanese propaganda films have survived at the Netherlands Government Information Service.|$|E
5|$|Although {{plants are}} {{better known for}} {{defensive}} mimicry, there are exceptions. For example, many flowers use mimicry to attract pollinators, while others may trick insects into dispersing their seeds. Nonetheless, most mimicry in plants would not <b>be</b> <b>classified</b> <b>as</b> aggressive, as although luring pollinators is similar to cases above, they are certainly not eaten by the plant. However some carnivorous plants {{may be able to}} increase their rate of capture through mimicry. For example, some have patterns in the ultraviolet region of the electromagnetic spectrum, much like the spider webs described above.|$|E

5|$|As a halogen, {{astatine}} {{tends to}} <b>be</b> <b>classified</b> <b>as</b> a nonmetal. It has some marked metallic properties and is sometimes instead classified {{as either a}} metalloid or (less often) as a metal. Immediately following its production in 1940, early investigators considered it a metal. In 1949 {{it was called the}} most noble (difficult to reduce) nonmetal as well as being a relatively noble (difficult to oxidize) metal. In 1950 astatine was described as a halogen and (therefore) a reactive nonmetal. In 2013, on the basis of relativistic modelling, astatine was predicted to be a monatomic metal, with a face-centred cubic crystalline structure.|$|E
5|$|Centaurs {{typically}} behave with {{characteristics of}} both asteroids and comets. Centaurs can <b>be</b> <b>classified</b> <b>as</b> comets such as 60558 Echeclus, and 166P/NEAT. 166P/NEAT was discovered while it exhibited a coma, {{and so is}} classified as a comet despite its orbit, and 60558 Echeclus was discovered without a coma but later became active, and was then classified as both a comet and an asteroid (174P/Echeclus). One plan for Cassini involved sending it to a centaur, but NASA decided to destroy it instead.|$|E

There is a separate section of Reddiars called Konda Reddy who were considered Shudras in British surveys, who follow tribal customs. Recently, Konda Reddys in Odissa have been pressing for inclusion in the Scheduled Tribes list.|$|R
