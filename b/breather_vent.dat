40|$|This study {{applied a}} pilot-scale trickle-bed air {{biofilter}} (TBAB) system for treating waste gas emitted from the <b>breather</b> <b>vent</b> of a vertical fixed roof storage tank containing p-xylene (p-X) liquid. The {{volatile organic compound}} (VOC) concentration of the waste gas was related to ambient temperature as well as solar radiation, peaking at above 6300 ppmv of p-X and 25000 ppmv of total hydrocarbons during the hours of 8 AM to 3 PM. When the activated carbon adsorber was employed as a VOC buffer, the peak waste gas VOC concentration was significantly reduced resulting in a stably and efficiently performing TBAB system. The pressure drop appeared to be low, reflecting that the TBAB system could be employed in the prolonged operation with a low running penalty. These advantages suggest that the TBAB system is a cost-effective treatment technology for VOC emission from a fixed roof storage tank...|$|E
50|$|Usually the {{lubrication}} system has subsystems that deal individually with the lubrication supply system of an engine, scavenging (oil return system), and a <b>breather</b> (<b>venting</b> excess air from internal compartments).|$|R
25|$|Additional {{facilities}} are provided for a centrifugal oil breather, {{to separate the}} drive lubricating oil from the overboard <b>breather</b> air <b>vent.</b> Also access for hand-turning the engine, during ground maintenance.|$|R
40|$|Moisture traps in roof systems {{should be}} avoided. Where a double {{membrane}} {{system is to}} be provided {{this can be accomplished}} by designing a <b>vented</b> system. <b>Breather</b> <b>vents</b> can relieve vapour pressure and provide for drying of small quantities of moisture over a relatively long period of time. They tend to be unsuccessful in drying wet roofs unless wetting can be eliminated at the source and the venting system designed to facilitate drying. Venting can be achieved without stack vents [see CBD- 99] or systems can be used that do not need vents [see CBD- 150].
