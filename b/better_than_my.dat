500|$|The sketch {{became an}} instant cult classic hit among Star Trek and science fiction fans. Captain Kirk actor William Shatner was asked which Star Trek parody was his favorite: Belushi's {{impression}} of himself, or the later satire wherein Shatner appeared on Saturday Night Live in a sketch telling Star Trek fans known as Trekkies to [...] "Get a life". Shatner said he preferred Belushi's impression {{to his own}} later appearance on the comedy television program. Shatner commented: [...] "I like Belushi's work as Kirk <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>my</b> own".|$|E
500|$|The novel {{examines}} the nature versus nurture debate in detail. At {{the beginning of}} the novel, Cal writes, [...] "Sing now, O Muse, of the recessive mutation on my fifthchromosome." [...] He then apologizes, saying, [...] "Sorry if I get a little Homeric at times. That's genetic, too." [...] This is an allusion to the poet Homer, who was also captivated with the nature versus nurture debate. In fact, Cal himself confesses, [...] "If you were going to devise an experiment to measure the relative influences of nature versus nurture, you couldn't come up with anything <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>my</b> life." ...|$|E

500|$|In his {{petition}} to Huckabee, Clemmons wrote {{he came from}} [...] "a very good Christian family" [...] and was [...] "raised much <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>my</b> actions speak". Clemmons claimed he had just moved from Seattle, Washington, to Arkansas as a teenager, and {{because he had no}} friends he gave in to peer pressure and [...] "fell in with the wrong crowd" [...] to be accepted by his young peers, which led him to commit his crimes. Although he apologized for his actions, Clemmons also complained that he received overly harsh sentences. He also claimed to have changed and expressed regret that his mother had recently died without seeing him turn his life around. Clemmons' clemency application was supported by Pulaski County Circuit Court Judge Marion Humphrey, who argued the cumulative sentence was excessive and cited Clemmons' young age at the time he committed the crimes.|$|E
500|$|The synergy between Taylor Street’s Little Italy and the Hull House complex; i.e., the {{settlement}} {{house and its}} summer camp, the Bowen Country Club, is well documented. [...] Alice Hamilton, medical professional and early member of that elite Hull House hierarchy, wrote in her autobiography, [...] "Those Italian women knew what a baby needed, far <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>my</b> Ann Arbor professors did." [...] The ancillary literature between, among and about members of Hull House's inner sanctum of sociologists and philanthropists is littered with such comments, reinforcing the relationship that existed between Taylor Street's Little Italy and Hull House. [...] A review of the ethnic composition of those who registered for and utilized the services provided by the Hull House complex, during its 74 years as a tenant of the near-west side, suggests an ethnic bias. Of the 257 known WWII veterans who were alumni of the Bowen Country Club, [...] "virtually all had a vowel {{at the end of}} their names...denoting their Italian heritage." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Weird Al" [...] Yankovic {{included}} the chorus in his polka medley [...] "Polka Face" [...] from his 2011 album Alpocalypse. The song was parodied by British comedy group The Midnight Beast. The parody discusses youthful {{subjects such as}} attempting to view the nude bodies of women and dodging parents' anger. After Kesha discovered the parody, she {{left a message on}} her Twitter account: [...] "holy. shit. this is <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>my</b> version." [...] Released to iTunes on January 15, 2010, the song peaked at number four on the Australian Singles Chart, and at thirty-nine on the Irish Singles Chart. Comedian Julie Brown parodied the song with the single [...] "Another Drunk Chick" [...] on her album Smell the Glamour (2011). Jarett Wiselman [...] of The New York Post stated it was [...] "one of the year's best comedy albums." [...] Avril Lavigne performed an acoustic version of the song in her setlist for BBC's Radio 1.|$|E

500|$|When he {{returned}} to the Tigers for spring training in 1952, Tigers' manager Red Rolfe noted, [...] "Artie could be our best pitcher. He's the slump-breaking type, a guy who can throw a shutout once in a while". After a poor season without Houtteman in 1951, Rolfe predicted, [...] "We'll be back in the first division this season because Art Houtteman is back. Houtteman makes us at least a dozen games better than [...] ". Houtteman worked out in Detroit with pitcher Ted Gray over the winter before the 1952 season. Before the season started, Houtteman said, [...] "It all depends on how I get off. I'm anxious to get into the season. My arm doesn't feel any different than it did in '50. I hope I can do even <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>my</b> last year". Houtteman also took number21 on his uniform, the number he had when he first arrived with the Tigers, because he felt that it had given both him and teammate George Kell, who won a batting title with the number, good luck.|$|E
2500|$|Having {{grown up}} among people, Travis had been socialized to humans since birth. A {{neighbor}} said {{he used to}} play around with Travis and wrestle with him. He said the animal always knew when to stop and paid close attention to its owner. [...] "He listened <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>my</b> nephews", the neighbor said, after Travis had mauled Nash. [...] "I just don't know why he would do that".|$|E
2500|$|Cain {{himself was}} {{very pleased with the}} way his book turned out on the screen. After seeing the picture half a dozen times he was quoted as saying, [...] "...It's the only picture I ever saw made from my books that had things in it I wish I had thought of. Wilder's ending was much <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>my</b> ending, and his device for letting the guy tell the story by taking out the office dictating machine – I would have done it if I had thought of it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Private Baldrick {{never got}} to tell the {{audience}} his final [...] "cunning plan" [...] to escape the trenches, as he is sent [...] "over the top" [...] before he can reveal it to Blackadder, George and Captain Darling, though it possibly involved a splinter on the ladder. However, Baldrick stated that Blackadder was correct in the final plan being [...] "as cunning as a fox who's just been appointed Professor of Cunning at Oxford University". Blackadder admits that [...] "whatever it was, it was <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>my</b> idea of pretending to be mad. Who'd ever notice another mad man round here?" [...] The episode's ending implies that Baldrick is killed in that attack.|$|E
2500|$|... "Stugotz' Weekend Observations" [...] — on Mondays, Stugotz {{gives his}} game {{notes from the}} {{previous}} weekend's sporting events. Before the segment, Papi claims, [...] "Nobody in the media {{will tell you what}} happened <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>my</b> boy Stu." [...] Weiner frequently shouts, [...] "Daaaaan!" [...] before he gives a hot take, and has been known to use very anti-climactic knock-knock jokes. [...] After each game note, Mike gives a beep sound. Stugotz has understandably been known to put Sean Miller on blast during this segment, and often closes the segment by telling sports figures or teams that they should say hello to Art Briles in Hell. Dan Le Batard has been openly opposed to this segment, but the listeners have frequently voted in favor of this segment. In June 2016, much to the disappointment of his fans, Stugotz admitted that he doesn't write all of the game notes.|$|E
2500|$|The catchphrase [...] "I have a cunning plan" [...] {{made its}} first {{appearance}} in the pilot episode, {{but it is not}} regularly used until the third series; Blackadder had mentioned the phrase twice in the first series and Baldrick once. Baldrick had also claimed to have [...] "a plan" [...] in a [...] "cunning" [...] voice on one occasion in Blackadder II. In the final episode of the last series, Blackadder Goes Forth, Baldrick announces that he has a cunning plan to save the main characters from [...] "going over the top", although it is never revealed what this plan might be (other than that it is [...] "as cunning as a fox who's just been appointed Professor of Cunning at Oxford University"). Blackadder, perhaps realising he cannot postpone going into battle (and certain death) indefinitely, dismisses it, telling Baldrick [...] "Whatever it was, I'm sure it was <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>my</b> plan {{to get out of here}} by pretending to be mad. I mean, who would have noticed another madman around here?" ...|$|E

2500|$|With the {{unprecedented}} media interest raising {{the stakes in}} the contest, Ip's supporters have been waging a campaign of increasing bitterness. While Ip officially adopted [...] "I'll do <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>my</b> best" [...] as a campaign slogan, Chan uses [...] "vote with your conscience" [...] on her election posters. Ip's supporters, however, have put up banners attacking Chan personally. After their surprise victories in the District Council elections the week before, [...] "Ip's supporters ... have escalated their dogging of Chan {{to the point of}} harassment, if not outright intimidation" [...] according to political commentator, Michael DeGolyer. This type of direct face-to-face violence has never been seen in Hong Kong politics: a Civic Party member was sent to hospital after he was injured when an Ip supporter, a failed DAB District Council candidate, tried to snatch his mobile phone, while he took pictures of their activities. [...] "The violence has been worse than in previous elections," [...] Audrey Eu said. She said there had been allegations of candidates, supporters and campaign posters having been targeted; the printer of election materials had his shop damaged and a supporter's taxi had its windows smashed." ...|$|E
