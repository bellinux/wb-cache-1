40|$|Alternative fuel vehicle (AFV) fleet {{adoption}} {{is an attractive}} mitigative measure to reduce environmental externalities from transportation activities of logistics. However, adequate economic and environmental attractions should be in place to encourage organisations to invest in AFVs. This paper introduces the alternative fuel vehicle routing problem (AFVRP), which is proposed to assist companies with an AFV fleet through both reducing the consumption level and optimising the utilisation of the alternative fuel. Distinguishing two dominant categories of AFVs as dedicated AFVs and bi-fuel vehicles, another extension of the problem as <b>bi-fuel</b> <b>vehicle</b> routing problem (BFVRP) is also studied. Experiments were run and {{the results indicated that}} for urban logistics networks a reduction by up to 35 % in CO 2 emissions and by up to 16 % in costs is possible by using an AFV fleet and the proposed methodology instead of gasoline vehicles and the conventional VRP with a simple distance minimisation objective...|$|E
50|$|<b>Bi-fuel</b> <b>vehicles</b> or {{otherwise}} known as dual fuel are vehicles with multifuel engines capable of running on two fuels. On internal combustion engines one fuel is gasoline or diesel, {{and the other is}} an alternate fuel such as natural gas (CNG), LPG, or hydrogen. The two fuels are stored in separate tanks and the engine runs on one fuel at a time in some cases, in others both fuels are used in unison. <b>Bi-fuel</b> <b>vehicles</b> have the capability to switch back and forth from gasoline or diesel to the other fuel, manually or automatically.|$|R
500|$|<b>Bi-fuel</b> <b>{{vehicles}}.</b> The term flexible-fuel vehicles {{is sometimes}} used to include other alternative fuel vehicles that can run with {{compressed natural gas}} (CNG), liquefied petroleum gas (LPG; also known as autogas), or hydrogen. However, all these <b>vehicles</b> actually are <b>bi-fuel</b> and not flexible-fuel vehicles, because they have engines that store the other fuel in a separate tank, and the engine runs on one fuel at a time. <b>Bi-fuel</b> <b>vehicles</b> {{have the capability to}} switch back and forth from gasoline to the other fuel, manually or automatically. The most common available fuel in the market for bi-fuel cars is natural gas (CNG), and by 2008 there were 9,6 million natural gas vehicles, led by Pakistan (2.0 million), Argentina (1.7 million), and Brazil (1.6 million). [...] Natural gas vehicles are a popular choice as taxicabs in the main cities of Argentina and Brazil. Normally, standard gasoline vehicles are retrofitted in specialized shops, which involve installing the gas cylinder in the trunk and the CNG injection system and electronics.|$|R

40|$|Compared {{with other}} {{alternative}} fuel vehicles (AFV), LPG vehicles (LPGV) have lower economic and technological barriers, leading to its faster growth in some developing countries in recent years. By means of regulation, Shanghai managed to have nearly all taxis converted to LPGV {{in the early}} 2000 s, and all taxis and 80 % of buses in Guangzhou are LPGV. Nevertheless, LPGV diffusion in China (excluding Hong Kong) has been slow and even showing signs of retreating. By 2008, less than 5 % of taxis in Shanghai were LPGV. This paper looks into the problem by comparing the LPGV development of Shanghai, Guangzhou versus that of Hong Kong where the LPGV development seems to be running well. The obstacles of LPGV development in China include a lack of policy coherence between the central and local governments; insufficient price advantage of Autogas; not enough fueling stations; and high maintenance costs due to immature technology and poor quality control. Bi-fuel system has further magnified the problems in China. In order to facilitate the use of alternative fuel, efforts {{should be made to}} increase the number of AFVs as well as to ensure the availability and price-competitiveness of the alternative fuel concerned.

40|$|Road {{transportation}} {{is a big}} contributor to the existing CO 2 emissions, among other greenhouse gases (GHGs) and air pollutants. The amount of emitted pollutants by a vehicle depends {{on the amount of}} fuel consumed and the type of fuel utilised. Moreover, the fuel consumption level is dependent on distance, load, speed, road gradient, driving pattern and many more factors. This paper extends vehicle routing problem (VRP) literature by developing a new variant as a green routing problem (GRP) which deals with optimising CO 2 emissions and costs from a <b>bi-fuel</b> <b>vehicle</b> fleet, which runs on both the main fuel and the cleaner alternative fuel. The modelling approach deals with not only the fuel consumption level, but also with the optimised utilisation of the alternative fuel of the vehicle. To analyse environmental and economic performance of the GRP, two extensions as P-GRP and CB-GRP were developed and implemented in an Iranian case study, with a bi-fuel (gasoline/CNG) fleet. Results of the case study and computational experiments suggest a possible reduction in CO 2 emissions by up to 27. 38 % and in costs by up to 18. 76 %, when compared with CVRP with a simple distance minimisation objective, using the conventional gasoline as the fuel...|$|E
40|$|Fast {{depletion}} {{of fossil fuels}} and their detrimental {{effect on the environment}} is demanding an urgent need of alternative fuels for meeting sustainable energy demand with minimum environmental impact. A lot of research is being carried out throughout the world to evaluate the performance, exhaust emission and combustion characteristics of the existing engines using several alternative fuels such as hydrogen, compressed natural gas, alcohols, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), biogas, producer gas, bio-diesels developed from vegetable oils, and others (Roy et. al, 2010). LPG and CNG are the alternative fuels to be widely adopted for use in the world. Gaseous fuel mix uniformly with air which burns precisely during combustion than liquid fuels. It has minimum carbon deposition & negligible physical delay. Internal combustion engines running on liquid petroleum gas (LPG) are well-proven technologies and work much likegasoline-powered spark-ignition engines. They are normally used as spark-ignition engines for bi-fuelled (gasoline/CH 4) cars, but have also been used, for example, in compression-ignition engines for heavy-duty vehicles. Both LPG and NG are not used alone, but always in <b>bi-fuel</b> <b>vehicles,</b> in combination with gasoline. In <b>bi-fuel</b> <b>vehicles</b> two fuels are stored in separate tanks and the engine runs on one fuel at a time. <b>Bi-fuel</b> <b>vehicles</b> have the capability to switch back and forth from gasoline to the other fuel, manually or automatically. As a fuel for spark-ignition engines LPG have some advantages over gasoline, such as a better anti-knock characteristic and reduced CO and unburned HC emissions (Hsieh et al., 2002). Environmental point of view is that there is an increasing interest among the suppliers to investigate LPG as a transportation fuel. It was found that the liquid petroleum gas, roughly a mixture of propane and butane, which gives a benefit in terms of toxic hydrocarbons emissions and ozone formation due to its composition and CO 2 emission levels (Heffel, 2003) ...|$|R
5000|$|Bi-fuel vehicle: Liquified {{petroleum}} gas {{and natural gas}} {{are very different from}} petroleum or diesel and cannot be used in the same tanks, so {{it would be impossible to}} build an (LPG or NG) flexible fuel system. Instead vehicles are built with two, parallel, fuel systems feeding one engine. For example, some Chevrolet Silverado 2500 HDs can effortlessly switch between petroleum and natural gas, offering a range of over 1000 km (650 miles). [...] While the duplicated tanks cost space in some applications, the increased range, decreased cost of fuel, and flexibility where LPG or CNG infrastructure is incomplete may be a significant incentive to purchase. While the US Natural gas infrastructure is partially incomplete, it is increasing at a fast pace, and already has 2600 CNG stations in place. [...] With a growing fueling station infrastructure, a large scale adoption of these <b>bi-fuel</b> <b>vehicles</b> could be seen in the near future. Rising gas prices may also push consumers to purchase these vehicles. When gas prices trade around $4.00, the price per MMBTU of gasoline is $28.00, compared to natural gas's $4.00 per MMBTU. [...] On a per unit of energy comparative basis, this makes natural gas much cheaper than gasoline. All of these factors are making CNG-Gasoline <b>bi-fuel</b> <b>vehicles</b> very attractive.|$|R

40|$|M. Ing. (Mechanical Engineering) Abstract: A {{fundamental}} shift towards {{alternative sources of}} energy particularly in the transport sector {{has led to the}} use of fuels such as liquefied petroleum gas and natural gas in spark ignition (SI) engines. However, these fuels retain the challenges associated with fossil fuels which are primarily their finite reserves and negative effects on the ecosystem. This study assesses the use of biogas, a renewable and environmentally friendly high octane fuel in the more popular spark ignition powered passenger vehicle using the simplest single-point fuel delivery conversion kit available on the market. The vehicle powered by a 1. 5 litre 1 UF-ZE spark ignition engine was converted to a <b>bi-fuel</b> <b>vehicle.</b> Torque, power, and transient emissions were measured with a single roller chassis dynamometer and a gas analyser while running on vehicle quality biogas also referred to as biomethane. The data collated from the use of biogas was pitched with that of petrol in the same system to compare performance and tailpipe emissions. The biogas was simulated by mixing 95 % methane (CH 4) with 5 % carbon dioxide (CO 2). The experiments also afforded the opportunity to validate biogas similarity with natural gas (CNG) when used to power vehicles. The research further looked into enhancing system efficiency by investigating the addition of a measure of 2 % hydrogen to create a biomethane-hydrogen mix (HCBG) which is within allowable limits of the mix used in a conventional spark ignition (SI) system to curb the negative impacts associated with hydrogen use as a fuel in internal combustion engines. The HCBG was derived by mixing 93 % CH 4 with 5 % CO 2 and 2 % H 2. Biogas recorded a reduction of 16 % in maximum power and torque values when pitched with petrol while similar maximum power and torque values to that of biogas were derived from the experiments using natural gas to power the same vehicle. When the hydrogen-biomethane mix was utilised, a 1 % power drop was noticed. However, slight increments in power and torque values at mid-speed ranges showed promise for higher hydrogen concentrations in the HCBG in fine-tuned systems. With respect to the mass emission of pollutants, the Inspection and Maintenance 240 (IM 240) Drive Cycle was employed to determine the carbon dioxide (CO 2), carbon monoxide(CO), hydrocarbon (HC), nitrous oxide (NOx) values in grammes per kilometer (g/km). Biogas recorded an 18 % CO 2 emission reduction compared to the data obtained using petrol (152. 2 g/km). With reference to biogas, CNG recorded 0. 4 g/km more CO 2 mass emissions while the enhanced HCBG [...] ...|$|E

For some <b>bi-fuel</b> <b>vehicles,</b> which can also fuel with conventional gasoline or diesel, limited availability will not necessarily limit vehicle sales but can limit fuel use. The impact of limited availability on vehicle purchase decisions is largely a function of geographic coverage and consumer perception. In this paper we review previous attempts to quantify the value of availability and present results from two studies that rely upon distinct methodologies. The first study relies upon stated preference data from a discrete choice survey and the second relies upon a station clustering algorithm and a rational actor value of time framework. Results from the two studies provide an estimate of the discrepancy between stated preference cost penalties and a lower bound on potential revealed cost penalties. Analysis of the stated preference survey data suggests that household consumers may perceive a purchase price penalty ranging from $ 750 to $ 4, 000 for retail station coverage at 1 to 10 percent of existing gasoline stations within metropolitan (urban) areas.

In Malaysia, most <b>bi-fuel</b> <b>vehicles</b> are fuelled with compressed natural gas (CNG) and gasoline. However, CNG flame speed is lower than gasoline resulting in, reduced power and range of the vehicle when operating on CNG. The lower flame speed also increases exhaust temperatures {{and can lead to}} premature exhaust valve degradation. Increasing the turbulence via swirl effect, can help improve the flame speed. A dissimilar valve lift profile was used to generate the swirl followed with engine testing concluding the performance, efficiency and emissions as the engine operates {{as a function of the}} air flow and fuel. Firstly, a flow bench was used to analyse swirl generated by dissimilar valve lift (DVL) profiles on the intake valve to find the conditions with the best swirl conditions. After that, a 3 -dimensional engine simulation was used to predict the best DVL. In the simulation, both air intake and combustion of the engine was simulated. It was found that flame propagation was increased by 32. 2 %. During the intake the swirl number (2. 25 SN) an increment of the turbulence kinetic energy (TKE) level was seen, which improves fuel mixing and flame speed.

With the aim to exploit the high knock resistance of NG maintaining the good performances of gasoline, the authors experienced, in a previous work [1], the simultaneous combustion of NG-gasoline mixtures on a series production Spark Ignition (SI) engine, obtaining, with respect to pure gasoline operation, strong reduction in pollutant emissions, noticeable efficiency increase and no significant power losses. In order to ascertain the knock resistance increase due to the addition of natural gas to gasoline, and given the total absence of such information in the scientific literature, the authors decided to carry out a dedicated experimental campaign: a standard Cooperative Fuel Research (CFR) engine, properly upgraded to inject both fuels in the intake duct, has been employed to determine the Motor Octane Number (MON) of several fuel mixtures following the ASTM Standard D 2700. The results showed a non-linear relation between mixture knock resistance and natural gas concentration, correctly interpolated by a polynomial law.
