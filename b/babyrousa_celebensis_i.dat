50|$|The North Sulawesi babirusa, <b>Babyrousa</b> <b>celebensis,</b> is a pig-like animal {{native to}} Sulawesi and some nearby islands (Lembeh, Buton, and Muna Islands) in Indonesia. It has {{two pairs of}} large tusks {{composed}} of enlarged canine teeth. The upper canines penetrate {{the top of the}} snout, curving back toward the forehead. The North Sulawesi babirusa is threatened from hunting and deforestation.|$|R
50|$|Wallacea has a {{total of}} 223 native mammal species. 126 of them are endemic to this region. 124 bat species {{can be found in}} this area. Sulawesi is the largest island in this region and has 136 mammal species, of which 82 species and one-quarter of the genera are endemic. Species such as anoa (Bubalus depressicornis) and {{babirusa}} (<b>Babyrousa</b> <b>celebensis)</b> live on this island. At least seven species of macaques (Macaca spp.) and at least five species of tarsier (Tarsius spp.) are also unique to this island.|$|R
50|$|Endemic Sulawesi mammals {{found in}} the {{national}} park include the Tonkean macaque (Macaca tonkeana), Anoa (Anoa depressicornis), North Sulawesi babirusa (<b>Babyrousa</b> <b>celebensis),</b> pygmy tarsier (Tarsius pumilus), Dian's tarsier (Tarsius dianae), Sulawesi bear cuscus (Ailurops ursinus), Sulawesi dwarf cuscus (Strigocuscus celebensis), Celebes rat (Taeromys celebensis), Sulawesi palm civet (Macrogalidia musschenbroekii) and Sulawesi stripe-faced fruit bat (Styloctenium wallacei). Endemic Sulawesi birds found in Lore Lindu include the maleo (Macrocephalon maleo), purple-bearded bee-eater (Meropogon forsteni), geomalia (Geomalia heinrichi), and many others. Reptiles and amphibians include the gold snake (Elaphe erythrura and E. janseni) and Sulawesian toad (Ingerophrynus celebensis). The fish Oryzias bonneorum and Oryzias sarasinorum, and the Parathelphusid crab Parathelphusa linduensis are endemic to Lake Lindu.|$|R
40|$|Surprisingly {{little is}} known about the Moluccan Babirusa Babyrousa babirussa despite the fact that this animal was first {{described}} by Europeans in 1582 (Macdonald et al., 2016). Most of the research on the biology of the animals of the genus Babyrousa has been conducted on animals from, or descended from those on, the island of Sulawesi, where <b>Babyrousa</b> <b>celebensis</b> occurs (Macdonald, 2017). A recently rediscovered book (Anonymous, 1770), published by Jan Monterre in 1770 and republished in Afrikaans as Anonymous 2011, contains information about this poorly known Babirusa; the chapter on the ‘BabiRoesa, VarkensHert’ was compiled by an unknown author, and as acknowledged, is largely derived from the book by Valentijn (1726). The latter has been said to contain the observations collected by Georg Everhard Rumphius for his unpublished books ‘concerning Land, Airand Sea animals of these islands’ (Beekman, 1999). The general quality and accuracy of the observations in the manuscript indicate that the original author was wellinformed, and this gives a sense of reliability to this historical information. Importantly, this 246 year old book chapter provides us with a glimpse of a past when apparently the Moluccan Babirusa was still very common...|$|R
40|$|Food {{preparation}} behaviour of sand-contaminated food {{articles by}} two zoo-based Sulawesi babirusa (<b>Babyrousa</b> <b>celebensis)</b> was observed and recorded as video imaging data at Bali Zoo, Indonesia during an observation period of six days in July 2012. In earlier preliminary studies of four animals, comprising two mother-infant pairs, three animals held pieces of cut sweet potatoes in the mouth, carried {{them to a}} neighbouring water trough, dropped or dipped them in the water, and then began eating. This behaviour was repeated at almost every feeding time. To characterise and elucidate this food preparation behaviour further, and within the management constraints of a zoo environment, experiments with various test feeds were designed; the dipping of food articles into water was video-recorded on 37 occasions. This behaviour by the babirusa was related to (1) deliberate sandcontamination of {{the surface of the}} food; (2) deliberate provision of large-sized pieces of food, and (3) the supply of large amounts of food at one time. The distance of the water source from the food seemed {{to play a role in}} the expression of the ‘food washing’ behaviour, with short (1. 5 m) distances preferred over longer (6 m) distances. The frequency of this type of babirusa food preparation behaviour was higher during the second half of a feeding period...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to evaluate the ecosystem functions through vegetation and wildlife indicators.   Methods used are vegetation analysis and direct indirect method to count wildlife.   Results show that the dominant type of land coverage in Gunung Ambang Nature Reserve is open secondary forest, where shrubs, rattan, and epiphytes dominated.   This might lead to vulnerability of the site toward disturbance.   Furthermore, it was indicated that this area still contains local wildlife species such as <b>Babyrousa</b> babyrussa <b>celebensis.</b>   Eventhough land degradation has become a significant issue, the status of Gunung Ambang as nature reserve has limited restoration attempts both vegetatively and mechanically...|$|R
50|$|Hooijer {{published}} 267 scientific {{articles about}} vertebrate fossils from Indonesia, Africa, the Near East (especially Israel), the Netherlands, the Antilles, and South America.

He described six new genera, including Celebochoerus, Chilotheridium, Epileptobos, Paradiceros, Paulocnus, and Spelaeomys and 47 new species and subspecies, including <b>Babyrousa</b> bolabatuensis, Elephas <b>celebensis</b> and the Flores Cave Rat.|$|R
40|$|With {{the current}} rate of loss of {{biological}} diversity worldwide estimated at 100 - 1000 x the natural background rate, solutions are urgently needed to avoid a catastrophic and irreversible loss of species. Conservation breeding is a tool now widely used to assist in maintaining populations in a safe environment until such time as they can be released back into their natural habitat. The babirusa (<b>Babyrousa</b> <b>celebensis)</b> is a threatened species for which conservation breeding {{is an integral part of}} its conservation management. Native to a few Indonesian islands, the babirusa is under threat from habitat destruction and hunting and is estimated to have a wild population of only a few thousand. Conservation breeding was established in 1972 with the translocation of animals from Sulawesi to the Surabaya Zoo in Java, Indonesia. It is thought that 1. 2 animals founded what is now a worldwide ex-situ population of around 200 individuals. With concerns mounting regarding likely levels of inbreeding and reduced reproductive success, particularly within the European population, this thesis aimed to utilise a number of techniques to assist the conservation breeding programme. Extensive studbook analysis was used to assess typical reproductive parameters for the babirusa in a captive setting; genetic analysis using microsatellite and mitochondrial DNA markers was used to clarify some aspects of the studbook and to estimate the level of variation within and between populations in different geographical areas; and faecal steroid analysis has been used to shed light on the physiological processes underpinning female reproduction. The combined output from these studies has added to our knowledge of this species and its performance in an ex-situ setting, and has now been used to inform future management of the conservation breeding programme...|$|R
40|$|The {{process of}} sex-determination {{can be better}} {{understood}} through examinations of developing organs and cells, which {{are involved in the}} formation of undifferentiated gonad. This mechanisms show in fish a broad variety, ranging from hermaphroditism to gonochorism and environmental to genetic sex determination. Hormones and abiotic factors such as temperature and pH can influence teleost development and reproductive traits. These factors are vulnerable to pollutants and climate changes. Therefore, it is important to examine gonad development and sex-determination/differentiation in teleost fish. Teleost fish are the largest known group of vertebrates with approximately 25, 000 species and are used for such kind of examinations as model organisms. Recently, in Oryzias latipes (medaka), dmrt 1 bY (or dmy), a member of the Dmrt gene family, has been described as testis-determining gene. However, this gene is not the universal master sex-determining gene in teleost fish. Although dmrt 1 bY is present in the most closely related species of the genus, namely Oryzias curvinotous, it is absent from other Oryzias species, like Oryzias celebensis, and other fish. During my thesis, I studied gonad development in medaka and in the closely related species Oryzias celebensis. Germ cell specification in medaka seems to be dependent on maternally provided cytoplasmatic determinants, so called germ plasm. Nanos and vasa are such germ cell specific genes. In zebrafish they are asymmetrically localized in the early embryo. I have shown that nanos mRNA is evenly distributed in the early embryo of medaka. A similar pattern has been already described for the medaka vasa homolog, olvas. This suggests differences in PGC specification in zebrafish and medaka. Further, the vasa homolog was isolated and the expression pattern examined in O. celebensis. The results show that it {{can be used as a}} germ cell specific marker. Additionally, the primordial germ cell migration in O. celebensis was followed, which is similar to medaka PGC migration. Primordial germ cell migration in vertebrates is dependent on the chemokine stromal cell-derived factor 1 (Sdf- 1). Medaka has two different sdf- 1 genes, sdf- 1 a and sdf- 1 b. Both genes are expressed in the lateral plate mesoderm (LPM). During late embryonic development, I could show that sdf- 1 a is expressed in newly formed somites and not longer in the LPM. Sdf- 1 b expression persisted in the posterior part of the lateral plate mesoderm in the developing gonad. In terms of early and late functions, this suggests subfunctionalization of sdf- 1 a and sdf- 1 b. In “higher” vertebrates, genes that are involved in the process of gonad development have been studied in detail, e. g. Wt 1, Sox 9, and Amh. I have analyzed the expression pattern of wt 1 and sox 9 co-orthologs and amh. In both, the medaka and O. celebensis, wt 1 a transcripts were localized in the LPM and its expression was similar to sdf- 1 a gene expression in medaka. Wt 1 b expression was restricted to the developing pronephric region. During later embryonic development, wt 1 a is specifically expressed in the somatic cells of the gonad primordium in both sexes. This is the first time that in fish wt 1 gene expression in developing gonads has been described. Therefore, this result suggests that wt 1 a is involved in the formation of the bipotential gonad. Furthermore, I have analyzed the gonad specific function of the wt 1 co-orthologs in medaka. I could show that a conditional co-regulation mechanism between Wt 1 a and Wt 1 b ensures PGC maintenance and/or survival. The expression of sox 9 genes in medaka and sox 9 b in O. celebensis were detected in the somatic cells of the gonad primordium of both sexes. Additionally, I have shown that amh and amhrII in medaka are expressed in somatic cells of the gonad primordium of both sexes. This suggests that sox 9 b, amh and amhrII are involved in gonad development and have specific functions in the adult gonad. In O. <b>celebensis</b> <b>I</b> could detect an expression of dmrt 1 already six days after fertilization in half of the embryos, which is similar to the dmrt 1 bY expression in medaka. Whether the expression of dmrt 1 is male specific in O. celebensis is currently under investigation. Altogether, the obtained results provide new insights into gene expression patterns during the processes of gonad development. Furthermore, no differences in the expression pattern of wt 1 a and sox 9 b during gonad development between the medaka and O. celebensis could be detected. This might indicate that the genetic mechanisms during gonad development are similar in both species. Die Untersuchung der Keimzellwanderung in O. celebensis zeigte hohe Ähnlichkeiten zu der bereits Beschriebenen im Medaka. Die Keimzellwanderung in Wirbeltieren ist abhängig von stromal cell-derived factor 1 (Sdf- 1), einem chemotaktisch wirkendem Zytokinin. Im Medaka existieren zwei sdf- 1 Gene, sdf- 1 a und sdf- 1 b, die während der embryonalen Entwicklung im Seitenplattenmesoderm (LPM) exprimiert werden. Die Expression der beiden Gene unterscheiden sich jedoch zeitlich und auch örtlich im LPM. Dies lässt vermuten, dass sich im Verlauf der Evolution eine frühe und eine späte keimzellspezifische Funktion zwischen sdf- 1 a und sdf- 1 b aufgeteilt hat. In „höheren“ Wirbeltieren wurden schon verschiedene Gene, z. B. Wt 1, Sox 9 und Amh, in dem Prozess der Gonadenentwicklung beschrieben. Die Expressionsmuster von wt 1 und sox 9 Co-Orthologen und amh habe ich während meiner Arbeit untersucht. Im Medaka und in O. celebensis wird wt 1 a im LPM transkribiert und ähnelt der von sdf- 1 a im Medaka. Die Expression von wt 1 b erfolgt hingegen nur in der Region der Vorläufer-Niere. Im weiteren Verlauf der Embryogenese ließen sich wt 1 a Transkripte erstmalig in somatischen Zellen des Gonaden-Vorläufers nachweisen. Wt 1 a spielt vermutlich eine Rolle in der Entwicklung der bipotentialen Gonade. Die funktionelle Analyse von wt 1 Genen im Medaka zeigte, dass durch eine konditionale Co-Regulation zwischen wt 1 a und wt 1 b die Keimzellen überleben bzw. erhalten bleiben. Die Expression von sox 9 b im Medaka und in O. celebensis ließ sich in somatischen Zellen des Gonaden-Vorläufers nachweisen. Zusätzlich werden amh und amhrII ebenfalls in somatischen Zellen beider Geschlechter exprimiert, daher kann man eine wichtige Rolle dieser Gene während der Gonadenentwicklung und in der adulten Gonade annehmen. Die Expression von dmrt 1 in O. celebensis konnte ich, in etwa der Hälfte der beobachteten Embryonen, bereits schon früh in der embryonalen Entwicklung (6 Tage nach der Befruchtung) nachweisen. Das Transkriptionsmuster von dmrt 1 in O. celebensis ist ähnlich der Expression von dmrt 1 bY im Medaka. Inwieweit diese Expression in O. celebensis spezifisch für Männchen ist wird zurzeit noch untersucht. Die erhaltenen Ergebnisse zeigen neue Einblicke in die Genexpressionsmuster der Gonadenentwicklung von Medaka und O. celebensis und weisen neue Möglichkeiten für weitere Forschungen auf. Des Weiteren konnte ich im Verlauf der Gonadenentwicklung keine Unterschiede in der Genexpression von wt 1 a und sox 9 b zwischen Medaka und O. celebensis nachweisen. Dies deutet an, dass die genetischen Mechanismen der Gonadenentwicklung zwischen den beiden nahverwandten Arten sehr ähnlich sind...|$|R
