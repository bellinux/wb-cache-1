5|$|Although Fresnel's {{hypothesis}} was empirically successful in explaining Fizeau's results, many leading {{experts in the}} field, including Fizeau himself (1851), Éleuthère Mascart (1872), Ketteler (1873), Veltmann (1873), and Lorentz (1886) were united in considering Fresnel's partial aether-dragging hypothesis to be on shaky theoretical grounds. For example, Veltmann (1870) demonstrated that Fresnel's formula implies that the aether {{would have to be}} dragged by different amounts for different colors of light, since the index of refraction depends on wavelength; Mascart (1872) demonstrated a similar result for polarized light traveling through a <b>birefringent</b> medium. In other words, the aether must be capable of sustaining different motions at the same time.|$|E
5|$|When {{used as a}} tunable {{narrow band}} filter, Michelson interferometers exhibit a number of {{advantages}} and disadvantages when compared with competing technologies such as Fabry–Pérot interferometers or Lyot filters. Michelson interferometers have the largest field of view for a specified wavelength, and are relatively simple in operation, since tuning is via mechanical rotation of waveplates rather than via high voltage control of piezoelectric crystals or lithium niobate optical modulators as used in a Fabry–Pérot system. Compared with Lyot filters, which use <b>birefringent</b> elements, Michelson interferometers have a relatively low temperature sensitivity. On the negative side, Michelson interferometers have a relatively restricted wavelength range and require use of prefilters which restrict transmittance.|$|E
25|$|Polarized light {{microscopy}} {{is commonly used}} in biological tissue, as many biological materials are <b>birefringent.</b> Collagen, found in cartilage, tendon, bone, corneas, and several other areas in the body, is <b>birefringent</b> and commonly studied with polarized {{light microscopy}}. Some proteins are also <b>birefringent,</b> exhibiting form birefringence.|$|E
25|$|An ideal <b>birefringent</b> crystal {{transforms}} the polarization state of an electromagnetic wave without loss of wave energy. <b>Birefringent</b> crystals therefore provide an ideal test bed for examining the conservative transformation of polarization states. Even though this treatment is still purely classical, standard quantum {{tools such as}} unitary and Hermitian operators that evolve the state in time naturally emerge.|$|E
25|$|Birefringence is {{the optical}} {{property}} of a material having a refractive index {{that depends on}} the polarization and propagation direction of light. These optically anisotropic materials are said to be <b>birefringent</b> (or birefractive). The birefringence is often quantified as the maximum difference between refractive indices exhibited by the material. Crystals with non-cubic crystal structures are often <b>birefringent,</b> as are plastics under mechanical stress.|$|E
25|$|Cotton fiber is <b>birefringent</b> {{because of}} high levels of {{cellulosic}} material in the fiber's secondary cell wall.|$|E
25|$|Within the cyst wall, a thick cellulose-like layer {{called the}} {{endospore}} is present which is <b>birefringent</b> under crossed nichols.|$|E
25|$|A {{mathematical}} {{description of}} wave propagation in a <b>birefringent</b> medium is presented below. Following is a qualitative {{explanation of the}} phenomenon.|$|E
25|$|For example, {{ordinary}} cellophane is <b>birefringent.</b> Polarizers {{are routinely}} {{used to detect}} stress in plastics such as polystyrene and polycarbonate.|$|E
25|$|While {{the initial}} state was linearly polarized, the final state is elliptically polarized. The <b>birefringent</b> crystal alters the {{character}} of the polarization.|$|E
25|$|In practice, {{some light}} {{is lost in}} the {{polarizer}} and the actual transmission will be somewhat lower than this, around 38% for Polaroid-type polarizers but considerably higher (>49.9%) for some <b>birefringent</b> prism types.|$|E
25|$|When an {{arbitrary}} {{beam of light}} strikes {{the surface of a}} <b>birefringent</b> material, the polarizations corresponding to the ordinary and extraordinary rays generally take somewhat different paths. Unpolarized light consists of equal amounts of energy in any two orthogonal polarizations, and even polarized light (except in special cases) will have some energy in each of these polarizations. According to Snell's law of refraction, the angle of refraction will be governed by the effective refractive index which is different between these two polarizations. This is clearly seen, for instance, in the Wollaston prism which is designed to separate incoming light into two linear polarizations using a <b>birefringent</b> material such as calcite.|$|E
25|$|In <b>birefringent</b> media {{there is}} no {{attenuation}} but two modes accrue a differential phase delay. Well known manifestations of linear birefringence (that is, in which the basis polarizations are orthogonal linear polarizations) appear in optical wave plates/retarders and many crystals. If linearly polarized light passes through a <b>birefringent</b> material, its state of polarization will generally change unless its polarization direction is identical {{to one of those}} basis polarizations. Since the phase shift, and thus the change in polarization state, is usually wavelength dependent, such objects viewed under white light in between two polarizers may give rise to colorful effects, as seen in the accompanying photograph.|$|E
25|$|In practice, {{some light}} {{is lost in}} the {{polariser}} and the actual transmission of unpolarised light will be somewhat lower than this, around 38% for Polaroid-type polarisers but considerably higher (>49.9%) for some <b>birefringent</b> prism types.|$|E
25|$|The LCD {{backlight}} {{systems are}} made highly efficient by applying optical {{films such as}} prismatic structure to gain the light into the desired viewer directions and reflective polarizing films that recycle the polarized light that was formerly absorbed by the first polarizer of the LCD (invented by Philips researchers Adrianus de Vaan and Paulus Schaareman), generally achieved using so called DBEF films manufactured and supplied by 3M. These polarizers consist of a large stack of uniaxial oriented <b>birefringent</b> films that reflect the former absorbed polarization mode of the light. Such reflective polarizers using uniaxial oriented polymerized liquid crystals (<b>birefringent</b> polymers or <b>birefringent</b> glue) are invented in 1989 by Philips researchers Dirk Broer, Adrianus de Vaan and Joerg Brambring. The combination of such reflective polarizers, and LED dynamic backlight control make today's LCD televisions far more efficient than the CRT-based sets, leading to a worldwide energy saving of 600 TWh (2017), equal to 10% of the electricity consumption of all households worldwide or equal to 2 times the energy production of all solar cells in the world.|$|E
25|$|Thin-film polarizers {{generally}} do not perform as well as Glan-type polarizers, but they are inexpensive and provide two beams that are about equally well polarized. The cube-type polarizers generally perform better than the plate polarizers. The former are easily confused with Glan-type <b>birefringent</b> polarizers.|$|E
25|$|Media {{that have}} {{different}} indexes of refraction for different polarization modes are called <b>birefringent.</b> Well known manifestations of this effect appear in optical wave plates/retarders (linear modes) and in Faraday rotation/optical rotation (circular modes). If the path length in the <b>birefringent</b> medium is sufficient, plane waves will exit the material with a significantly different propagation direction, due to refraction. For example, {{this is the}} case with macroscopic crystals of calcite, which present the viewer with two offset, orthogonally polarised images of whatever is viewed through them. It was this effect that provided the first discovery of polarization, by Erasmus Bartholinus in 1669. In addition, the phase shift, and thus the change in polarization state, is usually frequency dependent, which, in combination with dichroism, often gives rise to bright colours and rainbow-like effects. In mineralogy, such properties, known as pleochroism, are frequently exploited for the purpose of identifying minerals using polarization microscopes. Additionally, many plastics that are not normally <b>birefringent</b> will become so when subject to mechanical stress, a phenomenon which is the basis of photoelasticity. Non-birefringent methods, to rotate the linear polarization of light beams, include the use of prismatic polarization rotators which use total internal reflection in a prism set designed for efficient collinear transmission.|$|E
25|$|Wearers of {{polarized}} sunglasses will occasionally observe inadvertent polarization effects such as color-dependent <b>birefringent</b> effects, {{for example}} in toughened glass (e.g., car windows) or items made from transparent plastics, in conjunction with natural polarization by reflection or scattering. The polarized light from LCD monitors (see below) is very conspicuous when these are worn.|$|E
25|$|When groove spacing is {{less than}} half the {{wavelength}} of light, the only present order is the m = 0 order. Gratings with such small periodicity are called subwavelength gratings and exhibit special optical properties. Made on an isotropic material the subwavelength gratings give rise to form birefringence, in which the material behaves as if it were <b>birefringent.</b>|$|E
25|$|Birefringence {{also plays}} an {{important}} role in second-harmonic generation and other nonlinear optical components, as the crystals used for this purpose are almost always <b>birefringent.</b> By adjusting the angle of incidence, the effective refractive index of the extraordinary ray can be tuned in order to achieve phase matching, which is required for efficient operation of these devices.|$|E
25|$|For instance, needle {{aspiration}} {{of fluid}} from a gouty joint will reveal negatively <b>birefringent</b> monosodium urate crystals. Calcium pyrophosphate crystals, in contrast, show weak positive birefringence. Urate crystals appear yellow, and calcium pyrophosphate crystals appear blue when their long axes are aligned parallel {{to that of}} a red compensator filter, or a crystal of known birefringence is added to the sample for comparison.|$|E
25|$|By {{observing the}} {{polarization}} {{of light from}} the sky. Vikings used <b>birefringent</b> crystals of Iceland spar to navigate across the Atlantic Ocean by this method at about the same time. Iceland spar is found in China, as well as in Iceland and some other places. Insects such as bees can respond to sky polarization and use it to find their way home. Whether the Chinese used it is hypothetical, but it is certainly possible.|$|E
25|$|Although {{there is}} no axis of symmetry, there are two optical axes or binormals which are defined as {{directions}} along which light may propagate without birefringence, i.e., directions along which the wavelength is independent of polarization. For this reason, <b>birefringent</b> materials with three distinct refractive indices are called biaxial. Additionally, there are two distinct axes known as optical ray axes or biradials along which the group velocity of the light is independent of polarization.|$|E
25|$|The {{bioluminescence}} of {{the larvae}} of fireflies is also circularly polarized, {{as reported in}} 1980 for the species Photuris lucicrescens and Photuris versicolor. For fireflies, {{it is more difficult}} to find a microscopic explanation for the polarization, because the left and right lanterns of the larvae were found to emit polarized light of opposite senses. The authors suggest that the light begins with a linear polarization due to inhomogeneties inside aligned photocytes, and it picks up circular polarization while passing through linearly <b>birefringent</b> tissue.|$|E
25|$|Waveplates are {{constructed}} {{out of a}} <b>birefringent</b> material (such as quartz or mica), for which the index of refraction is different for different orientations of light passing through it. The behavior of a waveplate (that is, {{whether it is a}} half-wave plate, a quarter-wave plate, etc.) depends on the thickness of the crystal, the wavelength of light, and the variation of the index of refraction. By appropriate choice of the relationship between these parameters, it is possible to introduce a controlled phase shift between the two polarization components of a light wave, thereby altering its polarization.|$|E
25|$|In media termed <b>birefringent,</b> {{in which}} the amplitudes are {{unchanged}} but a differential phase delay occurs, the Jones matrix is a unitary matrix: |g1| = |g2| = 1. Media termed diattenuating (or dichroic {{in the sense of}} polarization), in which only the amplitudes of the two polarizations are affected differentially, may be described using a Hermitian matrix (generally multiplied by a common phase factor). In fact, since any matrix may be written as the product of unitary and positive Hermitian matrices, light propagation through any sequence of polarization-dependent optical components can be written as the product of these two basic types of transformations.|$|E
25|$|Birefringence {{is used in}} many optical devices. Liquid-crystal displays, {{the most}} common sort of flat panel display, cause their pixels to become lighter or darker through {{rotation}} of the polarization (circular birefringence) of linearly polarized light as viewed through a sheet polarizer at the screen's surface. Similarly, light modulators modulate the intensity of light through electrically induced birefringence of polarized light followed by a polarizer. The Lyot filter is a specialized narrowband spectral filter employing the wavelength dependence of birefringence. Wave plates are thin <b>birefringent</b> sheets widely used in certain optical equipment for modifying the polarization state of light passing through it.|$|E
25|$|A Wollaston prism {{is another}} <b>birefringent</b> {{polarizer}} {{consisting of two}} triangular calcite prisms with orthogonal crystal axes that are cemented together. At the internal interface, an unpolarized beam splits into two linearly polarized rays which leave the prism at a divergence angle of 15°–45°. The Rochon and Sénarmont prisms are similar, but use different optical axis orientations in the two prisms. The Sénarmont prism is air spaced, unlike the Wollaston and Rochon prisms. These prisms truly split the beam into two fully polarized beams with perpendicular polarizations. The Nomarski prism is {{a variant of the}} Wollaston prism, which is widely used in differential interference contrast microscopy.|$|E
25|$|In a <b>birefringent</b> material, a wave {{consists}} of two polarization components which generally are governed by different effective refractive indices. The so-called slow ray is the component for which the material has the higher effective refractive index (slower phase velocity), while the fast ray is the one with a lower effective refractive index. When a beam is incident on such a material from air (or any material with a lower refractive index), the slow ray is thus refracted more towards the normal than the fast ray. In the figure {{at the top of}} the page, it can be seen that refracted ray with s polarization in the direction of the optic axis (thus the extraordinary ray) is the slow ray in this case.|$|E
25|$|A Nicol prism was {{an early}} type of <b>birefringent</b> polarizer, that {{consists}} of a crystal of calcite which has been split and rejoined with Canada balsam. The crystal is cut such that the o- and e-rays are in orthogonal linear polarization states. Total internal reflection of the o-ray occurs at the balsam interface, since it experiences a larger refractive index in calcite than in the balsam, and the ray is deflected {{to the side of}} the crystal. The e-ray, which sees a smaller refractive index in the calcite, is transmitted through the interface without deflection. Nicol prisms produce a very high purity of polarized light, and were extensively used in microscopy, though in modern use they have been mostly replaced with alternatives such as the Glan–Thompson prism, Glan–Foucault prism, and Glan–Taylor prism. These prisms are not true polarizing beamsplitters since only the transmitted beam is fully polarized.|$|E
25|$|The photo-isomerization of {{azobenzene}} {{is a form}} of light-induced molecular motion. This isomerization {{can also}} lead to motion on larger length scales. For instance, polarized light will cause the molecules to isomerize and relax in random positions. However, those relaxed (trans) molecules that fall perpendicular to the incoming light polarization will {{no longer be able to}} absorb, and will remain fixed. Thus, there is a statistical enrichment of chromophores perpendicular to polarized light (orientational hole burning). Polarized irradiation will make an azo-material anisotropic and therefore optically <b>birefringent</b> and dichroic. This photo-orientation can also be used to orient other materials (especially in liquid crystal systems). For instance, it has been used to orient liquid crystal domains selectively, and to create nonlinear optical (NLO) materials.-sonogel glasses|journal=Journal of Sol-Gel Science and Technology|year=2010|volume=56|issue=1|pages=7–18|doi=10.1007/s10971-010-2265-y|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/f06488h188176783/}} Azo isomerization can also be used to photo-switch the liquid crystal phase of a material from cholesteric to nematic or to change the pitch of a cholesteric phase.|$|E
25|$|Because the {{quarter-wave plate}} {{is made of}} a <b>birefringent</b> material, when in the wave plate, the light travels at {{different}} speeds depending on the direction of its electric field. This means that the horizontal component which is along the slow axis of the wave plate will travel at a slower speed than the component that is directed along the vertical fast axis. Initially the two components are in phase, but as the two components travel through the wave plate the horizontal component of the light drifts farther behind that of the vertical. By adjusting {{the thickness of the}} wave plate one can control how much the horizontal component is delayed relative to vertical component before the light leaves the wave plate and they begin again to travel at the same speed. When the light leaves the quarter-wave plate the rightward horizontal component will be exactly one quarter of a wavelength behind the vertical component making the light left-hand circularly polarized when viewed from the receiver.|$|E
25|$|A {{general state}} of {{polarization}} launched into the medium {{can always be}} decomposed into two waves, one {{in each of those}} two polarizations, which will then propagate with different wavenumbers |k|. Applying the different phase of propagation to those two waves over a specified propagation distance will result in a generally different net polarization state at that point; this is the principle of the waveplate for instance. However, when you have a wave launched into a <b>birefringent</b> material at non-normal incidence, the problem is yet more complicated since the two polarization components will now not only have distinct wavenumbers but the k vectors will not even be in exactly the same direction (see figure {{at the top of the}} page). In this case the two k vectors are rather solutions of eqn. 6 constrained by the boundary condition which requires that the components of the two transmitted waves' k vectors, and the k vector of the incident wave, as projected onto the surface of the interface must all be identical.|$|E
25|$|A {{waveplate}} {{works by}} shifting the phase between two perpendicular polarization {{components of the}} light wave. A typical waveplate is simply a <b>birefringent</b> crystal with a carefully chosen orientation and thickness. The crystal is cut into a plate, with {{the orientation of the}} cut chosen so that the optic axis of the crystal is parallel to the surfaces of the plate. This results in two axes in the plane of the cut: the ordinary axis, with index of refraction no, and the extraordinary axis, with index of refraction ne. The ordinary axis is perpendicular to the optic axis. The extraordinary axis is parallel to the optic axis. For a light wave normally incident upon the plate, polarization component along the ordinary axis travels through the crystal with a speed vo = c/no, while the polarization component along the extraordinary axis travels with a speed ve = c/ne. This leads to a phase difference between the two components as they exit the crystal. When ne< no, as in calcite, the extraordinary axis is called the fast axis and the ordinary axis is called the slow axis. For nenbsp&> no the situation is reversed.|$|E
25|$|One can {{visualize}} {{the case of}} linear birefringence (with two orthogonal linear propagation modes) with an incoming wave linearly polarized at a 45° angle to those modes. As a differential phase starts to accrue, the polarization becomes elliptical, eventually changing to purely circular polarization (90° phase difference), then to elliptical and eventually linear polarization (180° phase) perpendicular to the original polarization, then through circular again (270° phase), then elliptical with the original azimuth angle, and finally {{back to the original}} linearly polarized state (360° phase) where the cycle begins anew. In general the situation is more complicated and can be characterized as a rotation in the Poincaré sphere about the axis defined by the propagation modes. Examples for linear (blue), circular (red), and elliptical (yellow) birefringence are shown in the figure on the left. The total intensity and degree of polarization are unaffected. If the path length in the <b>birefringent</b> medium is sufficient, the two polarization components of a collimated beam (or ray) can exit the material with a positional offset, even though their final propagation directions will be the same (assuming the entrance face and exit face are parallel). This is commonly viewed using calcite crystals, which present the viewer with two slightly offset images, in opposite polarizations, of an object behind the crystal. It was this effect that provided the first discovery of polarization, by Erasmus Bartholinus in 1669.|$|E
500|$|As a {{gemstone}} used in jewelry, {{silicon carbide}} is called [...] "synthetic moissanite" [...] or just [...] "moissanite" [...] after the mineral name. Moissanite {{is similar to}} diamond in several important respects: it is transparent and hard (9–9.5 on the Mohs scale, compared to 10 for diamond), with a refractive index between 2.65 and 2.69 (compared to 2.42 for diamond). Moissanite is somewhat harder than common cubic zirconia. Unlike diamond, moissanite can be strongly <b>birefringent.</b> For this reason, moissanite jewels are cut along the optic axis of the crystal to minimize <b>birefringent</b> effects. It is lighter (density 3.21 g/cm3 vs. 3.53 g/cm3), and much more resistant to heat than diamond. This results in a stone of higher luster, sharper facets and good resilience. Loose moissanite stones may be placed directly into wax ring moulds for lost-wax casting, as can diamond, as moissanite remains undamaged by temperatures up to 1800°C. Moissanite has become popular as a diamond substitute, and may be misidentified as diamond, since its thermal conductivity is closer to diamond than any other substitute. Many thermal diamond-testing devices cannot distinguish moissanite from diamond, but the gem is distinct in its birefringence and a very slight green or yellow fluorescence under ultraviolet light. Some moissanite stones also have curved, string-like inclusions, which diamonds never have.|$|E
