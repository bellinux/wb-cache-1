In order to define design criteria to promote surface <b>bio-activation</b> of metal surfaces we employed molecular simulations of different protein sequences. We have studied the conformational behavior of a previously selected gold-binding peptide on gold surface, alone and in conjugation with cell binding motifs, via molecular dynamics simulations. We found the conjugation of the peptide with the cell ligand sequence IKVAV offers the possibility to employ non covalent binding moieties to promote surface <b>bio-activation</b> of gold. This in silico approach could represent a tool to screen other sequences and characterize their adsorption to promote <b>bio-activation</b> not only of gold but also of other metal surfaces...|$|E

One example is the <b>bio-activation</b> of the anti-tubercular pro-drug ethionamide, which activity could be enhanced by inhibiting the transcriptional repressor EthR. Recently, we discovered that inhibition of a second transcriptional repressor, EthR 2, leads to the awakening of a new ethionamide <b>bio-activation</b> pathway. The x-ray structure of EthR 2 was solved at 2. 3  Å resolution in complex with a compound called SMARt- 420 (Small Molecule Aborting Resistance).

40|$|The {{transcriptional}} regulator EthR from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, {{a member}} of the TetR family of prokaryotic homo-dimeric transcriptions factors, controls the expression of the mycobacterial mono-oxygenase EthA. Due to the fact that EthA is responsible for the <b>bio-activation</b> of the second-line tuberculosis pro-drug ethionamide, EthR inhibitors have been shown to boost drug efficacy by increasing EthA levels.

40|$|The {{mechanistic}} {{basis for}} the resistance ofMycobacterium tuberculosis to para-aminosalicylic acid (PAS), an important agent {{in the treatment of}} multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, has yet to be fully defined. As a substrate analog of the folate precursor para-aminobenzoic acid, PAS is ultimately bioactivated to hydroxy dihydrofolate, which inhibits dihydrofolate reductase and dis-rupts the operation of folate-dependent metabolic pathways. As a result, the mutation of dihydrofolate synthase, an enzyme needed for the bioactivation of PAS, causes PAS resistance inM. tuberculosis strain H 37 Rv. Here, we demonstrate that various missense mutations within the coding sequence of the dihydropteroate (H 2 Pte) binding pocket of dihydrofolate synthase (FolC) confer PAS resistance in laboratory isolates ofM. tuberculosis andMycobacterium bovis. From a panel of 85 multidrug-resistant M. tuberculosis clinical isolates, 5 were found to harbor mutations in the folC gene within the H 2 Pte binding pocket, resulting in PAS resistance. While these alterations in the H 2 Pte binding pocket resulted in reduced dihydrofolate synthase activity, they also abolished the bioactivation of hydroxy dihydropteroate to hydroxy dihydrofolate. Consistent with this model for abolished <b>bio-activation,</b> the introduction of a wild-type copy of folC fully restored PAS susceptibility in folCmutant strains. Confirmation o...|$|E

The mechanism by which the vasculature protects itself from these chemicals is unknown. This study investigates whether the pregnane X receptor (PXR), the major transcriptional regulator of hepatic drug metabolism and transport that responds to such xenobiotics, mediates vascular protection by co-ordinating a defence gene program in the vasculature. Methods and Results PXR was detected in primary human and rat aortic endothelial and smooth muscle cells and blood vessels including human and rat aorta. Metabolic PXR target genes cytochrome P 450 3 A, 2 B, 2 C and glutathione-S-transferase mRNA and activity were induced by PXR ligands in rodent and human vascular cells and absent in the aortas from PXR null mice stimulated in vivo or in rat aortic smooth muscle cells expressing dominant negative PXR. Activation of aortic PXR by classical agonists had several protective effects; increased xenobiotic metabolism demonstrated by <b>bio-activation</b> of the pro-drug clopidogrel, which reduced adenosine diphosphate-induced platelet aggregation; increased expression of multidrug resistance protein 1, mediating chemical efflux from the vasculature; and protection from reactive oxygen species-mediated cell death.

40|$|Abstract. Rabbit liver microsomes {{of control}} (non-treated) or animals induced either by ethanol (EtOH) or {{phenobarbital}} (PB) were incubated with N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) or N-nitrosomethylaniline (NMA). Difference spectroscopy showed that NMA {{is bound to}} the substrate-binding site of cytochrome P- 450 (CYP) isoforms as heme ligand in control and EtOH pre-treated microsomes. On the other hand, PB-induced microsomes exhibit with NMA substrate type of spectra. NDMA does not provide any type of binding spectra with used microsomal systems. Oxidative <b>bio-activation</b> of N-nitrosamines by the microsomal CYP isoforms was measured as formaldehyde formation. Analysis of reaction kinetics in control microsomes revealed, for both substrates, two values of Michaelis–Menten constant (Km) for,Km values of 0. 03 and 0. 13 mmol/l for NDMA, and 0. 30 and 0. 82 mmol/l for NMA. Induction of animals with EtOH resulted in {{a decrease in the}} Km value for both substrates. In contrast, PB treatment caused an elevation of Km value for NDMA. Based on these data, we conclude that EtOHinducible microsomal CYP isoforms (mainly CYP 2 E 1) are responsible for binding and N-demethylation metabolism of both studied N-nitrosamines in rabbit liver microsomal system.

Bilateral wounds provide the possibility of making internal comparisons that minimize artifacts among individuals as well as of decreasing the number of animals needed for the study.

As cytochrome P 450 could {{be involved in}} the bioactivation of niclosamide, we investigated which sub-family was involved. We used liver microsomal fractions from rats treated with phenobarbital/β-naphthoflavone (PB/β-NF), benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) or cyclohexanol, which are known to induce different cytochrome P 450 subfami-lies, such as CYP 2 B, CYP 1 A 1, CYP 1 A 2 and CYP 2 E 1. We also inhibited CYP 1 A and CYP 2 E using α-NF and diethyl-dithiocarbamate to identify the cytochrome P 450 involved. Liver-S 9 fractions obtained from PB/β-NF- and BaP-treated rats significantly increased the number of rever-tants induced by niclosamide, while the CYP 1 A 1 inhibitor α-NF decreased the number of revertants. The incubation of niclosamide with CYP 1 A 1 Supersomes ™ increased the number of revertants, suggesting that CYP 1 A 1 is respon-sible for the bioactivation of niclosamide. Nitroreduction is also involved in niclosamide bioactivation, as the nitroreductase-deficient strain YG 7132 did not respond to the niclosamide treatment.

The availability of similarly reliable biomarkers of early effect or susceptibility could greatly improve the risk assessment process {{to such an extent that}} risk could even be assessed at the individual level. As to susceptibility biomarkers, functional genetic polymorphisms of relevant biotransformation enzymes may modulate the risk of adverse effects (NQO 1) and the levels of biomarkers of internal dose, in particular S-phenylmercapturic acid (GSTM 1, GSTT 1, GSTA 1). Among biomarkers of early effect, genotoxicity indicators, although sensitive in some cases, are too aspecific for routine use in occupational health surveillance programmes.

40|$|Ethionamide (ETH) {{is part of}} {{the drug}} arsenal {{available}} to treat multi-drug resistant tuberculosis. The current paradigm of this pro-drug activation involves the mycobacterial enzyme EthA and the transcriptional repressor, EthR. However, several lines of evidence suggest the involvement of additional players. The ethA/R locus was deleted in Mycobacterium bovis BCG and three Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) strains. While complete resistance to ETH was observed with BCG ethA/R KO, drug susceptibility and dose-dependent killing were retained in the ethA/R KO MTB mutants, suggesting the existence of an alternative pathway of ETH <b>bio-activation</b> in MTB. We further demonstrated that this alternative pathway is EthR-independent, whereby re-introduction of ethR in ethA/R KO MTB did not lead to increased resistance to ETH. Consistently, ethA KO MTB (with intact ethR expression) displayed similar ETH susceptibility profile as their ethA/R KO counterparts. To identify the alternative ETH bio-activator, spontaneous ETH-resistant mutants were obtained from ethA/R KO MTB and whole genome sequencing identified single nucleotide polymorphisms in mshA, involved in mycothiol biosynthesis and previously linked to ETH resistance. Deletion of mshA in ethA/R KO MTB led to complete ETH resistance, supporting that the role of MshA in ETH killing is EthA/R-independent. Furthermore mshA single KO MTB displayed levels of ETH resistance similar or greater than those obtained with ethA/R KO strains, supporting that mshA is as critical as ethA/R for ETH killing efficacy...|$|E

However, {{little attention has been}} paid to the metabolic pathways in mammalians and to the combined effect of individual metabolites. Several hydroxylated metabolites of benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) and chrysene (CHN) were formed by rat liver microsomal cytochrome P 450 (CYP) activity, some of which possess estrogenic activity. All mono- and several dihydroxylated metabolites of BaP and CHN were tested for ER affinity and estrogenic activity in a proliferation assay (E-screen) and in a reporter-gene assay (ER-CALUX). Twelve estrogenic metabolites were identified with EC 50 values ranging from 40 nM to 0. 15 mM. The combined effect of a mixture of seven PAH-metabolites was also studied in the ER binding assay. At concentrations that show little activity themselves, their joint action clearly exhibited significant estrogenic activity. BaP itself exhibited estrogenicity in the ER-CALUX assay due to <b>bio-activation</b> into estrogenic metabolites, probably via aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) induced CYP activity. Furthermore, 2 -hydroxy-CHN (2 -OHCHN) induced supra-maximal (400 %) estrogenic effects in the ER-CALUX assay. This effect was entirely ER-mediated, since the response was completely blocked with the ER-antagonist ICI 182, 780. We showed that 2 -OHCHN increased ER-concentration, using ELISA techniques, which may explain the observed supra-maximal effects. Co-treatment with the AhR-antagonist 3 ′, 4 ′-dimethoxyflavone (DMF) enhanced ER-signaling, possibly via blockage of AhR-ER inhibitory cross-talk. © 2004 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

In the present study, the cloning of CYP 4 B 1 in the wallaby (Macropus eugenii) and their expression across marsupials is described. Rabbit anti-mouse CYP 4 B 1 antibody detected immunoreactive proteins in lung and liver microsomes from all test marsupials, with relative weak signal detected from the koala, suggesting a species-specific expression.

The CYP 1 A 1 gene codifies the phase I enzyme aryl hydrocarbon hydroxilase (AHH) belonging to the cytochrome P 450 system that {{plays a major role in}} the <b>bio-activation</b> of tobacco procarcinogenes. Two CYP 1 A 1 polymorphisms, m 1 (T 6235 C transition) and m 2 (A 4889 G transition), are associated with greater enzymatic activity and have been described as genetic susceptibility factors for lung cancer. The aim of this study was to verify if this association holds true in blood samples of 175 lung cancer pa tients and 217 non-cancer patients from Portugal’s midlands region. The samples were studied by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) assay. The allelic frequencies of the mutant alleles were 0. 12 for allele C and 1. 14 for allele G in the control population. The results were not statistically different from those alleles in the patient population. There was also no statistically significant difference in genotype distribution in lung cancer patients and controls even when combining high risk genotypes. In our control sample, as in other populations of different ethnic origin, both polymorphisms also seem to be in linkage disequilibrium. We conclude that in this sample of the Portuguese population, CYP 1 A 1 m 1 and m 2 polymorphisms are too rare to be of clinical relevance, and do not seem to be associated with susceptibility to lung cancer.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{moderate}} alcohol consumption on liver fibrosis {{is not well}} understood, but evidence suggests that adenosine {{may play a role}} in mediating the effects of moderate ethanol on tissue injury. Ethanol increases the concentration of adenosine in the liver. Adenosine 2 A receptor (A 2 AR) activation is known to enhance hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation and A 2 AR deficient mice are protected from fibrosis in mice. Making use of a novel mouse model of moderate ethanol consumption in which female C 57 BL/ 6 J mice were allowed continued access to 2 % (vol/vol) ethanol (11 % calories) or pair-fed control diets for 2 days, 2 weeks or 5 weeks and superimposed with exposure to CCl 4, we tested the hypothesis that moderate ethanol consumption increases fibrosis in response to carbon tetrachloride (CCl 4) and that treatment of mice with an A 2 AR antagonist prevents and/or reverses this ethanol-induced increase in liver fibrosis. Neither the expression or activity of CYP 2 E 1, required for <b>bio-activation</b> of CCl 4, nor AST and ALT activity in the plasma were affected by ethanol, indicating that moderate ethanol did not increase the direct hepatotoxicity of CCl 4. However, ethanol feeding enhanced HSC activation and exacerbated liver fibrosis upon exposure to CCl 4. This was associated with an increased sinusoidal angiogenic response in the liver. Treatment with A 2 AR antagonist both prevented and reversed the ability of ethanol to exacerbate liver fibrosis.

No {{significant increase in the}} number of somatic mutations was observed with the essential oil tested using both the standard (ST) and high <b>bio-activation</b> (HB) cross. In order to investigate the antimutagenic effect of the essential oil, we have tested the effect on the indirect-acting mutagen urethane (URE), as well as the direct-acting mutagen methyl methanesulfonate (MMS). O. compactum essential oil showed a strong inhibitory effect against URE-induced mutagenicity, especially with the HB cross. However, only a weak inhibitory effect on the mutagenicity induced by MMS was observed. These results suggest that the detected antimutagenicity could be mediated by an inhibitory effect on metabolic activation. The essential oil was fractionated to identify the components responsible of the suppressing effect detected. Seven fractions were obtained: two of them showed the most potent inhibitory effect against URE-induced mutagenicity and were further fractionated. The sub-fractions obtained from the second chromatographic fractionation were tested for their antimutagenic activity, together with carvacrol and thymol. The highest antimutagenic effect obtained with the sub-fractions was similar to the effect of the crude essential oil, as well as to the effect of carvacrol alone. These results suggest the absence of a synergic antimutagenic effect between the components of O. compactum essential oil and indicate that carvacrol was the most active oil component. © 2007 Elsevier B.

However, the scientific literature on their pathogenic potential remains incomplete, which could affect the current understanding of the associated health risks. This review provides current information based on recently improved research techniques to evaluate gasoline toxicity profiles for humans. Our current knowledge provides insight into the intricate mechanism of gasoline-induced adverse effects, including the formation of reactive metabolites via <b>bio-activation</b> and subsequent generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress, which are involved in multiple mechanisms that are central to the aetiology of gasoline-induced toxicity. These mechanisms include covalent binding to deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), leading to oxidative damage, tumor-suppression gene activity, and activation of pro-oncogenes. Furthermore, it results in induction of autoimmunity and local inflammatory responses, disruption of multiple neurotransmitters and immune cell function, derangement of various enzyme activities (e. g., sodiumpotassium adenosine triphosphate (Na+/K+/ATPase) activity, cytochrome P 450 (CYP 450), nitric oxide synthase (NOS), antioxidant enzyme activities, etc.), conjugation of bile, and non-specific cell membrane interaction, leading to damage of the membrane lipid bilayer and proteins. Available data suggests that exposure to gasoline or gasoline constituents have the potential to cause different types of illnesses. The data highlights the need to maintain safety measures via suitable research, medical surveillance, regulatory control, life style modification, early detection, and intervention to minimize exposure and manage suspected cases.

The studied clones showed up to sixfold differences in resistance to fenitrothion. The lack of correlation between in vitro sensitivity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) to fenitrooxon and resistance to fenitrothion indicated that insensitivity of AChE to the most active oxen metabolite was not involved in the observed differences in resistance. Inhibition of mixed-function oxidases (MFOs) by piperonyl butoxide (PBO) increased the tolerance to fenitrothion by almost 20 -fold in all clones without altering their relative ranking, of resistance. Conversely, when exposed to fenitrooxon, the studied clones showed similar levels of tolerance, thus indicating that clonal differences in the conversion of fenitrothion to fenitrooxon by MFOs were involved in the observed resistance patterns. Despite that resistant clones showed over 1. 5 higher activities of carboxilesterase (CbE) than sensitive ones, toxicity tests with 2 -(O-cre-syl) - 4 H- - 1, 3, 2 -benzodioxaphosphorin- 2 oxide, which is a specific inhibitor of these enzymes, evidenced that this system only contributed marginally to the observed clonal differences in tolerance. Glutathione-S-transferases activity (GST) varied across clones but not under exposure to fenitrothion, and was only related with tolerance levels in the field clones. In summary, our results indicate that MFO mediated differences on the <b>bio-activation</b> of the phosphorotionate OP pesticide to its active oxon metabolite contributed mostly in explaining the observed moderate levels of resistance, whereas the activities of CbE and GST had only a marginal role.

40|$|Metabolism of {{xenobiotics}} by cytochrome P 450 s (encoded by the CYP genes) {{often leads}} to <b>bio-activation,</b> producing reactive metabolites that interfere with cellular processes and cause DNA damage. In the testes, DNA damage induced by xenobiotics {{has been associated with}} impaired spermatogenesis and adverse effects on reproductive health. We previously reported that chronic exposure to the reproductive toxicant, acrylamide, produced high levels of DNA damage in spermatocytes of Swiss mice. CYP 2 E 1 metabolises acrylamide to glycidamide, which, unlike acrylamide, readily forms adducts with DNA. Thus, to investigate the mechanisms of acrylamide toxicity in mouse male germ cells, we examined the expression of the CYP, CYP 2 E 1, which metabolises acrylamide. Using Q-PCR and immunohistochemistry, we establish that CYP 2 E 1 is expressed in germ cells, in particular in spermatocytes. Additionally, CYP 2 E 1 gene expression was upregulated in these cells following in vitro acrylamide exposure (1 µM, 18 h). Spermatocytes were isolated and treated with 1 µM acrylamide or 0. 5 µM glycidamide for 18 hours and the presence of DNA-adducts was investigated using the comet assay, modified to detect DNA-adducts. Both compounds produced significant levels of DNA damage in spermatocytes, with a greater response observed following glycidamide exposure. A modified comet assay indicated that direct adduction of DNA by glycidamide was a major source of DNA damage. Oxidative stress played a small role in eliciting this damage, as a relatively modest effect was found in a comet assay modified to detect oxidative adducts following glycidamide exposure, and glutathione levels remained unchanged following treatment with either compound. Our results indicate that the male germ line has the capacity to respond to xenobiotic exposure by inducing detoxifying enzymes, and the DNA damage elicited by acrylamide in male germ cells is likely due to the formation of glycidamide adducts.

In this work, the non-fluorescent 6 -nitroquinoline (42) was used to investigate the production of a fluorescent 6 -aminoquinoline (43) and other metabolites under bio-reducing hypoxic conditions. In the presence of the enzymatic reducing system NADPH:cytochrome P 450 reductase/NADPH, 6 -nitroquinoline (42) produced the fluorescent helicene (44), along with the non-florescent azo (45). An authentic sample of (44) was chemically synthesized and characterized and used to confirm the production of this molecule in the enzymatic process. Interestingly, the expected fluorophore (43) is not produced by NADPH:cytochrome P 450 reductase/NADPH. In another study, the enzymatic reducing system xanthine/xanthine oxidase was used to reduce (42) under hypoxia to obtain (43). In these experiments (43) was produced and the yield is increased with xanthine concentration. Metabolic identification revealed that intermediates of typical nitro reduction pathway are present along with 6 -nitroquinolone (51). which is formed by xanthine oxidase mediated oxidation of (42). The absence of (44) as a metabolite with xanthine/xanthine oxidase system highlights the complexity of bioreduction of nitroaromatics under hypoxia. In our laboratory, <b>bio-activation</b> of di-N-oxides such as tirapazamine (TPZ, 42) has been studied.

Our evidence suggests that upon undergoing bio-reduction, TPZ produces hydroxyl radical as the DNA damaging radical species. Others have suggested another mechanism, which proposes the formation benzotriazine radical (38) upon dehydration process over the bio-reduction step.

In the presence of the enzymatic reducing system NADPH:cytochrome P 450 reductase/NADPH, 6 -nitroquinoline (42) produced the fluorescent helicene (44), along with the non-florescent azo (45). An authentic sample of (44) was chemically synthesized and characterized and used to confirm the production of this molecule in the enzymatic process. Interestingly, the expected fluorophore (43) is not produced by NADPH:cytochrome P 450 reductase/NADPH. In another study, the enzymatic reducing system xanthine/xanthine oxidase was used to reduce (42) under hypoxia to obtain (43). In these experiments (43) was produced and the yield is increased with xanthine concentration. Metabolic identification revealed that intermediates of typical nitro reduction pathway are present along with 6 -nitroquinolone (51). which is formed by xanthine oxidase mediated oxidation of (42). The absence of (44) as a metabolite with xanthine/xanthine oxidase system highlights the complexity of bio-reduction of nitroaromatics under hypoxia. In our laboratory, <b>bio-activation</b> of di-N-oxides such as tirapazamine (TPZ, 42) has been studied. TPZ undergoes one-electron bio-reduction to produce oxidizing radical, which causes DNA damage under hypoxia. In our laboratory, the mechanism by which TPZ mediated DNA damage has been investigated using TPZ and its analogs. Our evidence suggests that upon undergoing bio-reduction, TPZ produces hydroxyl radical as the DNA damaging radical species. Others have suggested another mechanism, which proposes the formation benzotriazine radical (38) upon dehydration process over the bioreduction step. In the current work, TPZ analog 1, 2, 4 -benzotraizine- 1, 4 -dioxide (55) and deuterated (60) were used to test the dehydration mechanism. Isotopic content analysis of metabolites, derived from bio-reducing metabolism of (55) and its deuterated analog (60), using HRMS show evidence against the dehydration mechanism...|$|E
40|$|Arylamine N-acetyltransferases are {{xenobiotic}} metabolising enzymes, {{involved in}} metabolic pathways leading to either detoxification or <b>bio-activation</b> {{of drugs and}} carcinogens. In humans, polymorphisms of the two functional NAT genes (NAT 1 and NAT 2 } have been implicated to cancer susceptibility. The genomic region of the NAT 1 loci, 8 p 22, is often deleted in tumours and is believed to contain tumour suppressor genes. Two previously developed cosmid probes, carrying either NAT 1 or NAT 2, were tested as probes for FISH analysis using nuclei from healthy lymphocytes and the RT 112 urothelial carcinoma cell line (Chapter 3). FISH analysis of cells obtained from barbotage samples of bladder cancer patients was performed and deletion of the NAT genomic region was a common observation (Chapter 6). To allow refined mapping of the NAT region on 8 p 22, a series of PAC clones carrying the NAT loci were isolated by PCR screening of a genomic library (Chapter 3). Furthermore, the NAT 1 and NAT 2 isoenzymes were studied in healthy intestinal and mammary tissue, {{as a first step}} towards understanding their potential involvement in these two types of cancer (Chapter 6). The mouse has been extensively used as a model for studying NAT. Three functional Nat genes are present in the mouse genome. A fine restriction map was generated for the Nat 1 and Nat 2 genomic region in mice, using Nat -positive genomic DNA plasmid clones previously isolated from the fast acetylator Balb/c and 129 /Ola strains. The Nat 1 and Nat 2 genes were mapped 9. 4 kb apart and no polymorphisms were detected between the two strains for the restriction enzymes used for mapping (Chapter 4). The 129 /Ola restriction map has since been the basis for the production of a construct for Nat 2 knockout and transgenic mouse strains. PAC clones positive for Nat were isolated from a mouse genomic library and used as FISH probes to map the three murine Nat genes on chromosome 8, band B 3. 1 - 3. 3. One PAC clone contained all three Nat loci, establishing co-localisation of Nat 3 with the other two Nat genes in mice. The minimum distance of Nat 3 from Nat 1 and Nat 2 was estimated to be 22 kb, while the three loci are within 130 kb. YAC clones carrying the Nat genes were also isolated to facilitate physical mapping of the Nat cluster in mice (Chapter 5). This will allow integration of cytogenetic, physical and previous genetic data for comparative studies. </p...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION & OBJECTIVES: The {{peripheral}} zone (PZ) of {{the prostate}} presents with a higher occurrence of adenocarcinoma (CaP) compared to transition zone (TZ). Environmental procarcinogens and endogenous hormones implicated in the aetiology, often requires <b>bio-activation</b> to DNA-binding species (that form DNA-carcinogen adducts) which are done by phase I cytochrome P- 450 (CYP) isoenzymes (CYP 1 A 1, CYP 1 A 2 and CYP 1 B 1) and, the phase II N-acetyl transferases (NAT 1 and NAT 2) and catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT). The objective {{of this study is}} to assess intra- (PZ vs. TZ) and inter-individual variations in the gene expression of phase I and II enzymes using quantitative real-time RT-PCR in CaP-free tissues. MATERIAL & METHODS: With ethical approval, prostate tissue sets (PZ and TZ) (n= 27) were obtained from patients (inclusion criteria - low PSA (< 20 mg/l serum) and/or low volume disease ≤two/eight core biopsies positive for CaP)) undergoing radical prostatectomy, isolated from a lobe preoperatively identified as negative for CaP. Real-time RT-PCR was employed to quantitatively examine CYP 1 A 1, CYP 1 A 2, CYP 1 B 1, NAT 1, NAT 2 and COMT. Immunohistochemistry (with polyclonal anti-CYP 1 B 1 antibody) was employed to assess CYP 1 B 1 protein and location in the prostate. In all cases, retrospective analysis (after H&E) of adjacent tissue by a pathologist was performed to determine the cancer-free nature of the tissue. RESULTS: CYP 1 B 1, NAT 1 and COMT gene expression was detected in both zones of all tissue sets (n= 27) examined. CYP 1 A 1 (23 / 27) and NAT 2 (26 / 27) mRNA transcripts were also detected. CYP 1 A 2 (14 / 27) transcripts, although detectable, were unquantifiable. Inter-individual variations (up to 10 -fold) were noted in CYP 1 A 1, CYP 1 B 1, NAT 1, NAT 2 or COMT expression levels. In an intraindividual analysis, in cancer-free (n= 19) tissue sets, CYP 1 B 1 mRNA transcript levels (18 / 19) were 2 - to 50 -fold higher in the PZ compared to the TZ. Such a differential expression profile was not observed for other genes. In 13 / 27 tissue sets examined, intra-individual expression of these latter genes were equivalent or higher in the TZ. A retrospective finding of CaP was consistently associated with an altered expression profi le i. e. CYP 1 B 1 was expressed was higher in the cancer zone, be it PZ or TZ (7 / 8). Immunohistochemistry (n= 12) in the cancer-free tissues showed strong CYP 1 B 1 staining (nuclear in nature) in the basal epithelial cells; some nuclear staining was also observed in the stroma. In CaP tissue, sheaths of cells exhibiting both nuclear staining and cytoplasmic staining were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates the expression in the prostate of phase I and II enzymes. And CYP 1 B 1 expression is particularly high in peripheral zone. Its role as a target either for chemoprevention/treatment strategies remains to be investigated...|$|E
40|$|The {{androgenic}} steroid hormones {{are essential}} for the physiological development of the prostate gland and are also implicated in pathological processes such as benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer. The systemic effect of endocrine activity in the prostate gland {{has so far been}} considered of minor importance. The overall aim of this thesis is to further investigate the role of the prostate in androgen <b>bio-activation</b> and inactivation and relate these processes to prostate cancer susceptibility. Conjugation by UDP-glucuronosyl transferases (UGTs) is considered a major inactivation route for androgens in the prostate. Of these UGT 2 B 15 and UGT 2 B 17 are expressed in the prostate. Functional polymorphisms have been identified in both of these enzymes and were associated with intraprostatic androgen glucuronide levels (Paper IV). In paper I we investigated the UGT 2 B 17 deletion polymorphism and found a 2. 2 -fold increased risk for prostate cancer for individuals with the deletion allele. In order to evaluate these findings we repeated the genotype association in a considerably larger population-based case-control study (paper II). In contrast to our previous results no association between the UGT 2 B 17 deletion polymorphism and prostate cancer rate was found. The dihydrotestosterone (DHT) metabolite 5 alpha-androstane- 3 beta, 17 beta-diol (3 betaAdiol) has been proposed as an intraprostatic ligand of the estrogen receptor beta (ERbeta) promoting anti-proliferative activity. For the first time significant 3 betaAdiol levels were detected in human prostate tissue (paper IV). The cytochrome P 450 7 B 1 (CYP 7 B 1) enzyme is a putative regulator of intraprostatic 3 betaAdiol levels. In paper III we demonstrated increased CYP 7 B 1 protein expression in malignant areas in the prostate and that the CYP 7 B 1 /ERbeta mRNA ratio was increased in prostate cancer compared to benign tissue. The transcriptional activity of the CYP 7 B 1 gene is regulated by methylation. Many studies have investigated the association between circulating sex hormones and prostate cancer risk, but the conclusion from these studies may be wrong since the correlation between intraprostatic androgen metabolism and systemic androgens is poor. In paper IV we measured peripheral and local peri-prostatic androgen and gonadotropin levels in men undergoing radical prostatectomy (RP) for localized prostate cancer. There was an almost two-fold higher DHT concentration and a fifteen percent lower luteinizing hormone (LH) concentration in local prostatic serum compared to peripheral serum levels. A significant positive correlation between prostate weight and local DHT levels was observed. The correlation studies also indicate that 28 % of the systemic DHT variance can be explained by prostatic DHT production. In paper V we investigated the serum and urine hormonal changes after RP. We measured serum levels of testosterone, DHT, sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), luteinizing hormone LH, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and inhibin B preoperatively and 90 days postoperatively. Steroid urine profile was also determined pre- and postoperatively in 18 patients. There were significant increases in serum LH and FSH and a 13 % decrease in DHT levels. Urinary levels of DHT glucuronides (DHT-G) decreased by 67 % while Androsterone-G and 3 alphaAdiol-G increased. Inhibin B levels correlated inversely with both FSH and LH. Thus RP leads to significant DHT decrease in both serum and urine and we conclude that the observed increase in gonadotropin levels is a consequence of the DHT changes...|$|E
40|$|Thesis {{submitted}} in fulfilment of {{the requirements}} for the degree Doctor of Technology: Biomedical Technology in the Faculty of Health and Wellness Sciences at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology 2014 According to the World Health Organization, cancer {{is the leading cause}} of death in the developed world, while it is the second leading cause of death in the developing world. In particular, liver cancer is the fifth most commonly diagnosed cancer in men, however, it is the second most frequent cause of death, responsible for an estimated 700, 000 deaths annually. General limited access to health services, including treatment and the overall management of cancer in developing countries often contribute to the increased mortality rates when compared to developed countries. For centuries, medicinal plants have been used to prevent, and to a certain extent, treat cancer as a readily available and affordable alternative. In many instances, the curative or preventative claims still remain anecdotal. However, increasing evidence suggest that polyphenolic components of plants possess antioxidant activities, which are credited with curative/beneficial properties of medicinal plants. The curative properties could either be related to the primary compounds present in the plant itself, or the <b>bio-activation</b> products of plant components affecting hepatic drug metabolising and antioxidant enzymes systems related to carcinogen metabolism and maintaining oxidative homeostasis, respectively. Similarly, chronic consumption of medicinal plants could also result in hepatotoxicity, either caused by the primary plant components or <b>bio-activation</b> products. Due to these observations it is paramount to understand the mechanisms involved in the metabolism of plant components to critically assess beneficial versus potential harmful properties associated with chronic consumption. The focus of the current study was aimed at elucidating the bio-activity of four multipurpose indigenous plants to Southern Africa, i. e. Adansonia digitata, Agathosma betulina, Siphonochilus aethiopicus and Myrothamnus flabellifolius. Traditionally, A. digitata has been used as an immunostimulant, anti-inflammatory and analgesic agent, while also as an antipyretic agent in the treatment of diarrhoea and dysentery. Similarly, traditional medicinal uses of A. betulina include treatment cholera, haematuria, calculus, kidney diseases, as well as infections of the bladder, urethra, and prostate among others. S. aethiopicus was traditionally employed to treat infections associated with pains and fevers, whereas M. flabellifolius served as treatment of conditions ranging from respiratory ailments, backache, kidney problems, haemorrhoids, chest pain, and asthma. In the first part of this study, the polyphenolic contents and antioxidant capacities of the four plants were characterised. The emphasis was placed on using different solvents, namely water, ethanol and acetone for the extraction of the plant material and different methodologies to assess the antioxidant contents and -capacities of the various extracts as both these factors can influence the outcome. When considering the antioxidant contents, total polyphenols, flavanols, and flavonols of the different solvent extracts prepared from the four plants were determined, whereas three different assays were used for the antioxidant capacities, i. e. oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC), trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) and ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assays. The A. digitata acetone extract had the highest (7. 121 mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE) /milligram (mg) soluble solids), whereas the water extract of the same plant had the lowest total phenolic content (0. 008 mg GAE/mg soluble solids). In general, the acetone extracts demonstrated the highest total polyphenol, flavanol, and flavonol contents, followed by the ethanol extracts, with the water extracts having the lowest contents. M. flabellifolius was the only distinct deviation from this rule, where the water extract demonstrated the highest total polyphenol content. Considering antioxidant capacities, the acetone extracts provided the highest antioxidant capacities for all plants when assessed using the TEAC (8. 56 - 32. 68 milimole (mmole) trolox equivalent (TE) /mg soluble solids) and FRAP (5. 69 - 37. 39 mmole ascorbic acid equivalent/mg soluble solids) antioxidant assays, with the exception of M. flabellifolius where the water extract demonstrated the highest activity (22. 73 mmole ascorbic acid equivalent/mg soluble solids). Antioxidant capacity determinations with TEAC and FRAP assays followed similar patterns, which were different from capacities determined by the ORAC (0. 46 - 533. 54 mmoleTE/mg of soluble solids) assay. Corroborating the antioxidant content findings, the acetone extracts also demonstrated the highest antioxidant capacities (140. 41 - 533. 54 mmoleTE/mg of soluble solids), followed by ethanol (94. 62 - 151. 29 mmoleTE/mg of soluble solids) and water (0. 46 - 134. 02 mmoleTE/mg of soluble solids). Only M. flabellifolius (TEAC and FRAP) and S. aethiopicus (FRAP) deviated from this trend. Correlations between the polyphenolic contents and antioxidant capacities indicated that acetone and ethanol were more effective in extracting polyphenolic compounds than water, while also providing extracts with superior antioxidant activities. Furthermore, ORAC assay was the antioxidant capacity determining assay of choice for the aqueous plant extracts, whereas the TEAC and FRAP assays were more suitable when determining the antioxidant capacities of the acetone and ethanol plant extracts. These results confirm the notion that no single assay can comprehensively determine the antioxidant activities of plant extracts and that a battery of assays should be used, as the various antioxidant capacity determination techniques use different substrates with different targets for measurement. The second part of this study comprised an in vivo experimental animal model to assess the potential toxicity, antioxidant status and modulation of the hepatic phase 2 drug metabolising enzymes following chronic consumption of the various plant extracts in male Fisher rats. Rats consumed aqueous extracts of the various plants (2 % and 5 % (w/v)) as the sole source of drinking fluid for 90 days, and the serum chemical pathology parameters for monitoring liver and kidney function conducted. These included alkaline phosphatase (ALP), aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), total iron (Fe), and creatinine (CREA). Parameters for blood and hepatic redox status included total polyphenols, ORAC, reduced glutathione (GSH), oxidised glutathione (GSSG), their ratio (GSH:GSSG), conjugated dienes (CD) and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS). Assessment of the phase 2 hepatic xenobiotic metabolising enzymes included glutathione S-transferase (GST)  and activity in the cytosolic fraction and, UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UDP-GT) activity in liver microsomes. When considering the liver and kidney function none of the plant extracts induced any significant toxicity, while 2 % A. digitata significantly increased serum Fe. When considering the redox status, the whole blood and liver samples yielded similar results, with significant decreases in oxidised glutathione (GSSG) in rats consuming the 2 % M. flabellifolius (82. 76 mole/L) and 5 % A. digitata (90. 42 mole/L) with a resultant significant increase in the glutathione redox status (GSH:GSSG ratio of 5. 69 and 5. 64, respectively) when compared to rats consuming water (4. 77). The GSH:GSSG ratio was also significantly increased by consumption of 2 % A. betulina (8. 45) and 5 % S. aethiopicus (5. 99). The consumption of all plant extracts, except 5 % A. betulina and M. flabellifolius, significantly increased lipid peroxidation in the plasma CDs assay. These results indicated an increased antioxidant capacity in the liver with/without an associated reduced cellular oxidative stress status, which could be interpreted as a reduced susceptibility to oxidative damage. When considering the phase 2 hepatic enzymes, none of the plant extracts caused any significant changes in GST, GST or UDP-GT activities. The third part investigated the chemoprotective properties against cancer promotion in the liver utilising diethylnitrosamine (DEN) as cancer initiator and maize culture material of Fusarium verticillioides, containing the fumonisin B mycotoxins, as promoters in male Fischer rats. The rats consumed 2 % (w/v) aqueous extracts of A. digitata, A. betulina, and S. aethiopicus over 28 days after cancer initiation and liver sections subjected to glutathione-S-transferase placental form positive GSTP+ staining and pre-cancerous liver foci categorised according to size. In addition, blood and liver analyses were done as described in the chronic feeding study above. Consumption of the A. digitata and, to a certain extent, S. aethiopicus extracts, altered the oxidative stress status in the liver as indicated by the increased lipid peroxidation, as determined by significantly increased liver CDs and the decreased GSH:GSSG ratio in the blood. This can be related to a subchronic toxicity due to the high total polyphenol intake as mentioned above. These underlying sub chronic toxic effects of A. digitata and S. aethiopicus are likely to be responsible for the observed inhibitory effect on the proliferation of GSTP+ minifoci in the liver. Hepatic phase 2 metabolising enzyme activities were not significantly altered by A. digitata and S. aethiopicus consumption, while GST activity was significantly increased by A. betulina treatment. Based on the findings of the current study, aqueous extracts of A. digitata, A. betulina, and S. aethiopicus may serve as hepatoprotectors with a potential to modulate liver carcinogenesis, specifically cancer promotion. To our knowledge, no other studies have attempted to describe the possible chemoprevention mechanisms of these indigenous medicinal plants. Assessments of phase 1 hepatic enzymes and other antioxidant enzymes are suggested for future studies to further describe biochemical and molecular mechanisms associated with consumption of these extracts. Additionally, identifying main compounds present in the plant extracts could culminate in development of drugs and novel nutraceuticals. It is also recommended that increasing concentrations of the plant extracts and/or the ethanol extracts to be used in future studies to better describe dose-responses of the different plants in liver carcinogenesis...|$|E
