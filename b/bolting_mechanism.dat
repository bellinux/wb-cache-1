2500|$|Some {{would say}} that Lyman C. Smith {{was the father of}} the L. C. Smith shotgun, however, [...] "the heart of the gun," [...] its rotary <b>bolting</b> <b>mechanism</b> was invented in March 1883, by Brown. It is {{suspected}} by some that Brown was given the task of [...] "circumventing" [...] the Baker patents. On July 13, 1886, he was issued patent 345,362 on which the hammerless L. C. Smith shotgun was based. His last known gun patent was 381,109, issued on April 17, 1888 for an air rifle.|$|E
40|$|In this quarter, the {{research}} effort {{is to develop}} the drill control unit (DCU) that acquire, store drilling parameters and control the drilling operation. The relevant publications have been reviewed and the methodology developed by previous researchers has been evaluated using the collected data in our laboratory and field tests conducted {{prior to the start}} of this project. Numerical modeling for exploring roof <b>bolting</b> <b>mechanism</b> has been started...|$|E
30|$|Rock <b>bolting</b> <b>mechanism</b> is {{different}} from that of supports acting on the roadway surface. As rocks basically belong to non-continuum, the method used for continuum is not applicable in analyzing the functions of rock bolting. To fully exert the function of rock bolts, enough anchoring force is necessary, moreover, spreading the bolt resistance force into the rocks is also important. The non-continuous deformations, caused by separation, slip, fracture opening and new-born cracks, are the key factors to prevent the bolt resistance force from spreading into rocks. Lots of underground practices have shown that rock bolts should be installed with enough pretension as soon as the roadway is excavated, the initial separation of rocks can be restrained, and the bolting performance is best (Zhang and Gao 2004; Kang et al. 2007 a). However, if rock bolts are installed in broken and separated rocks, even the bolts were heavily loaded, the bolting performance is poor. Therefore, the bolting theory with high pretension and extra high strength was proposed (Kang et al. 2007 b, 2009 c), the cores of which emphasize the decisive roles of bolt pretension and its spreading into rocks on bolting performance. The rock bolting with high pretension and extra high strength can effectively reinforce roadways once for all without twice or more supporting.|$|E

5000|$|Operation: Currently {{a hybrid}} gas & recoil {{operating}} group. Gas powers the <b>bolt</b> <b>mechanism</b> while recoil drives the barrel/barrel extension and the feed system. Design changes are underway to totally eliminate the gas system to provide increased reliability and reduced complexity.|$|R
50|$|According to a United States Army Materiel Command analysis, the Type 67 {{uses the}} DP trigger mechanism, the quick-change {{barrel of the}} SG-43, a gas {{regulator}} similar to the RPD, the ZB vz. 30 <b>bolt</b> <b>mechanism,</b> and a modified Maxim-type feed mechanism.|$|R
50|$|The {{firearms}} of the ČZ 2000 series family {{fall under}} the category of automatic weapons - selective fire, gas-operated and locked with rotary <b>bolt</b> <b>mechanism.</b> Cartridge casings are extracted from the chamber with a spring-loaded claw extractor and ejected by a protrusion in the receiver housing.|$|R
50|$|APC uses {{straight}} blowback function. It fires {{from the}} closed bolt and features a <b>bolt</b> lock-back <b>mechanism</b> thus facilitating quick reloads. This overcomes {{one of the}} major issues with the H&K MP5 family of weapons, which do not have a <b>bolt</b> lock-back <b>mechanism</b> (though H&K's UMP series does).|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Lifting {{the feed}} tray cover reveals the rotary <b>bolt</b> locking <b>mechanism.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Locked recoil systems rely {{on timing}} to allow safe operation. A very heavy <b>bolt</b> <b>mechanism</b> {{can be used}} (such as in Sub-Machineguns) to slow the rate of {{movement}} and reduce the rate of fire. [...] This is not adequate with higher velocity and higher energy cartridges. Rifles and most handguns use locked breech designs to control recoil safely.|$|R
50|$|Like the HK416, the HK417 is gas-operated with a short-stroke piston design {{similar to}} that of the Heckler & Koch G36. The short-stroke piston is more {{reliable}} than the original direct impingement operation of the AR-15 design because, unlike these weapons, it does not vent propellant gases directly into the receiver, which deposits carbon fouling onto the <b>bolt</b> <b>mechanism</b> as well as heating it up.|$|R
50|$|While the Chassepot's {{ballistic}} {{performance and}} firing rates were excellent for the time, burnt paper residues {{as well as}} black powder fouling accumulated in the chamber and <b>bolt</b> <b>mechanism</b> after continuous firing. Also, the bolt's rubber obturator eroded in action, although it was easily replaced in the field by infantrymen. The older Dreyse needle gun and its cartridge had been deliberately constructed {{in a way to}} minimize those problems but to the detriment of its ballistic properties.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, the classic Mannlicher {{designs for the}} Austro-Hungarian army {{were based on the}} en-bloc magazine, a straight-pull <b>bolt</b> <b>mechanism</b> and were {{designed}} for obsolete large caliber cartridges. Following the introduction of smokeless powder in the Lebel rifle {{at the end of the}} century, the Steyr factory worked on new Mannlicher designs, using more effective modern cartridges. These were offered for the consideration of the Austro-Hungarian Army, for export to other armies and for the civilian market.|$|R
50|$|For {{maintenance}} {{the weapon}} is field stripped {{into the following}} components: the receiver and barrel, bolt carrier, <b>bolt,</b> return <b>mechanism,</b> gas tube, receiver cover and magazine.|$|R

50|$|The MAS direct {{impingement}} design {{reduced the}} number of bolt moving parts to only six: the bolt carrier, then the rear locking tilting bolt which carries the extractor, the ejector and the firing pin, and lastly the recoil spring. It takes only a few seconds to disassemble the entire <b>bolt</b> <b>mechanism</b> for cleaning. The MAS-49 had a reputation for reliability in conditions of poor maintenance, sometimes being cleaned with nothing more than rags and motor oil. The rifle could also endure harsh service environments (MAS rifles saw service in Algeria, Djibouti, Indochina, and French Guiana).|$|R
50|$|For regular field {{maintenance}} and cleaning, the firearm is disassembled {{into the following}} components: the receiver and barrel group, bolt carrier, <b>bolt,</b> return <b>mechanism,</b> gas tube, receiver dust cover and magazine.|$|R
50|$|After the Great War, {{modifications}} {{were made}} on the 95M carbines, recalibrating the sights to the newly adopted metric system, and later adopting the Austrian-developed longer spitzer cartridge, all this resulting in the 31M rifle. But the army was not satisfied. After analytic World War I performance, amongst deficiencies were listed that the straight-pull Mannlicher could freeze in great cold; that the bolts were hand-fitted thus non-interchangeable, and could be replaced only by trained gunsmiths; and a cock on opening operation. In {{the end it was}} decided that the new rifle should use the simpler, more conventional Mannlicher-Schönauer rotating <b>bolt</b> <b>mechanism.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Vickers-Berthier (VB) {{light machine}} gun {{manufactured}} by Vickers-Armstrong {{was based on a}} French design of just before World War I intended for use on aircraft. In 1925 Vickers in Britain purchased licence rights for production in their Crayford factory, and as a replacement for the Lewis Gun. It was an alternative to the water-cooled Vickers machine gun of same manufacture. The weapon used a similar gas and tipping <b>bolt</b> <b>mechanism</b> to the Bren gun, and also had a removable barrel, and was air-cooled like the Bren. It was adopted by the Indian Army in 1933.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} design for igniting the powder propellant charge involved {{the insertion of}} a standard artillery [...] "T friction tube" [...] into a hole near {{the base of the}} barrel. The Royal Artillery had a higher priority in receiving the already insufficient number of tubes so ignition was changed to use a Lee-Enfield <b>bolt</b> <b>mechanism</b> and chamber screwed into a socket in the barrel near the base. A special blank rifle cartridge was loaded and fired via a lanyard from a sheltered position if possible due to the risk of bombs falling short. This ignited the propellant charge and launched the bomb.|$|R
50|$|The OTs-14-4A is a {{small arms}} weapon system based on the 5.45×39mm AKS-74U carbine. It is a {{selective}} fire, air-cooled magazine-fed rifle with a gas-actuated piston operating system and a rotary <b>bolt</b> locking <b>mechanism.</b>|$|R
50|$|Weatherby's {{requirements}} {{included a}} bolt face which was countersunk into the bolt which would enclose the cartridge's casehead while the bolt head was enclosed in a counterbored barrel breach, {{which in turn}} would prevent the casehead from rupturing. If a rupture should occur, the bolt would have holes through which hot gases could be vented safely towards the side {{and away from the}} shooter's face. Further as an extra safety measure he required an enclosed or shrouded bolt sleeve that would prevent the hot gases from making their way through the <b>bolt</b> <b>mechanism</b> to the shooter's face. To Weatherby, the safety and strength of the design were paramount.|$|R
5000|$|The Model L is a {{selective}} fire, roller-delayed blowback firearm. The weapon features a semi-rigid two-piece <b>bolt</b> <b>mechanism</b> {{that consists of}} a bolt head and a supporting angular locking piece. During the [...] "unlocking" [...] sequence, the two cylindrical rollers contained in the bolt head are cammed inward against inclined flanks of the barrel extension and act upon the locking piece and bolt carrier, propelling it rearward at a velocity {{greater than that of}} the bolt, which remains closed until the fired bullet has left the barrel and pressures inside the bore have been reduced to a safe level before withdrawing together with the bolt carrier.|$|R
40|$|Many plasma-facing {{components}} in today's experiments are inertially cooled. Graphite tiles are {{mounted on a}} water-cooled steel plate using a spring and <b>bolt</b> <b>mechanism.</b> When exposed to high heat flux, such a shield can take loads {{only for a few}} seconds without becoming overheated. To operate in high intensity long pulsed/steady-state conditions, new actively cooled heat shields of brazed and non-brazed types are under development. With clamped (form-locked) monoblock tiles a prototype of non-brazed heat shield structure underwent its first high heat flux tests for divertor applications in the Julich MARION ion source [1]. The test results are encouraging, and validated a finite element model as discussed in this paper. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
50|$|The {{receiver}} was a sophisticated, machined alloy forging {{with the}} magazine housing {{placed on the}} left-hand side and the ejection port on the right. The seemingly awkward placement of the magazine housing (horizontally to the side rather than directly beneath the receiver) allowed the <b>bolt</b> <b>mechanism</b> to extend into the buttstock assembly, effectively reducing the overall length of the weapon as the magazine well did {{not interfere with the}} location of the pistol grip. The pistol grip was integrated into the trigger group assembly, a separate housing containing the trigger mechanism and fire control components, and was formed from pressed sheet metal during fabrication from two separate halves and then welded together.|$|R
50|$|Mexico {{assembled}} FN-made components into complete rifles at {{its national}} arsenal in Mexico City. The FAL was also exported {{to many other}} countries, such as Venezuela, where a small-arms industry produces some basically unchanged variants, as well as ammunition. By modern standards, one disadvantage of the FAL {{is the amount of}} work which goes into machining the complex receiver, bolt and bolt carrier. Some theorized that the movement of the tilting <b>bolt</b> <b>mechanism</b> tends to return differently with each shot, affecting inherent accuracy of the weapon, but this has been proven to be false. The FAL's receiver is machined, while most other modern military rifles use quicker stamping or casting techniques. Modern FALs have many improvements over those produced by FN and others in the mid-20th-century.|$|R
50|$|To {{minimize}} heating during rapid fire, the gun used a {{very heavy}} straight contour barrel (finned for ventilation on later variants), bringing its weight up to 35 pounds. The standard tripod mount with seat for the gunner added another 56 pounds. Despite the heavy barrel, the closed <b>bolt</b> <b>mechanism</b> would cook off shots if a round was left chambered in a hot barrel. This required that the gun be unloaded immediately after an extended burst of firing. During testing of the gun, it {{was found to be}} capable of firing extended bursts of over 1,000 rounds before the barrel overheated and bullets began to tumble out of control; upon stopping, the red-hot barrel cooked off four or five additional shots before cooling down.|$|R
50|$|DuBiel rifles were {{constructed}} using only patented DuBiel actions which feature a five lug <b>bolt</b> locking <b>mechanism</b> {{resulting in a}} 36 degree bolt rotation. The short rotation produced the fastest bolt-action rifle available at the time. The actions were produced in three lengths, both right and left hand configurations.|$|R
25|$|The rotary <b>bolt</b> locking <b>mechanism</b> {{consists}} of two steel locking lugs that engage locking recesses in the breech, and is identical to that used in the SG 540. A spring-loaded extractor is incorporated into the bolt while a fixed protrusion {{on one of the}} receiver's internal guide rails ejects the spent cartridge casings.|$|R
50|$|While the gun {{is thought}} of {{by some to be}} the first bolt-action rifle, in reality it bears little {{resemblance}} to modern bolt-action rifles, except for the bolt principle itself which was applied to close the breech. Ammunition for the Dreyse rifle was made up of paper cartridges holding the bullet into a sabot. The gun's needle penetrated the paper cartridge before igniting the black powder charge. The Dreyse's simple construction made it relatively easy to keep clean and in operation. For instance, worn needles could be quickly replaced without dismantling the <b>bolt</b> <b>mechanism.</b> The Dreyse rifle was a significant ordnance improvement for its time, since it permitted a much faster rate of fire than the muzzle-loading rifled muskets which were the standard of world's armies until the mid-1860s. It also enabled riflemen to reload without standing and exposing themselves to fire.|$|R
5000|$|The DIO {{promotes}} the KH2002 as a [...] "low-recoil, highly accurate, lightweight" [...] weapon, with [...] "modular construction for easy maintenance" [...] and a rotating <b>bolt</b> locking <b>mechanism,</b> presumably designed to facilitate ambidextrous firing, protected under a carrying handle {{that contains the}} rear sight. The carrying handle {{can also be used}} to mount optical or night sights.|$|R
50|$|Design-wise, the SKS {{relies on}} the AVS-36 (developed by the same designer, Simonov) {{to a point that}} some {{consider}} it a shortened AVS-36, stripped of select-fire capability and re-chambered for the 7.62×39mm cartridge. This viewpoint is problematic, as the AVS uses a sliding block bolt locking device, while the SKS employs a more reliable tilting-bolt design, an entirely different style. The <b>bolt</b> <b>mechanism</b> is one of the defining features of a rifle, having a different bolt means the SKS and AVS merely appear similar in layout, while differing vastly in bolt lockup, caliber, size, and that one has a fixed magazine and the other has a detachable magazine. It also owes a debt to the SVT-40 and M44 that it replaced, incorporating both the semi-automatic firepower of the SVT (albeit in a more manageable cartridge) and the carbine size and integral bayonet of the bolt-action M44.|$|R
25|$|Both the {{propellant}} charge {{appropriate for}} the required range and the bomb were loaded via the muzzle. Usually a Lee–Enfield rifle's <b>bolt</b> action <b>mechanism</b> was screwed into the breech. A special blank rifle cartridge was loaded and was triggered by pulling a lanyard, and fired into an igniter {{at the base of}} the mortar chamber, igniting the propellant charge and launching the bomb.|$|R
50|$|The Mini-Beryl’s design {{combines}} features {{from both}} the wz. 1989 Onyks carbine and the wz. 1996 Beryl rifle; the principal components that were modified include the barrel, barrel trunnion, upper and lower handguards, muzzle device and magazine. The weapon’s method of operation, the rotary <b>bolt</b> locking <b>mechanism</b> and ammunition are identical {{to those of the}} wz. 1996 Beryl standard rifle.|$|R
40|$|The corner bolt is {{proved to}} be {{effective}} in the control of floor deformation of roadway, and the relevant studies on <b>bolting</b> <b>mechanisms</b> are of great significance in improving roadway stability. In this paper, two types of shear tests on six forms of bolts are performed by using self-designed shear test device, the electro-hydraulic servo triaxial testing system. The shear characteristics of different types of bolts are obtained. The results show that different bolt rods or different internal filling conditions result in large differences in shear resistance and different deformation adaptability. We find that the filling materials added can improve the shear performance of bolt significantly, and the bolt with steel not only can improve the strength of bolt body, but also has the bimodal characteristic that makes the bolt have the secondary bearing capacity and withstand larger deformation range during the process of shear, and shows a better support performance. Hoping to provide the experiment basis for support design and field application in the future...|$|R
40|$|Short {{encapsulated}} pullout {{tests are}} frequently {{used in the}} laboratory and {{in the field to}} examine the bond performance of rock bolting. Because of the restriction of sample conditions and of testing apparatus, push testing is usually used instead in the laboratory. Rock bolts have a better performance in push testing and this is a thought to be attributed to Poisson 2 ̆ 7 s ratio effect of the steel rebar. In this paper Poisson 2 ̆ 7 s ratio effect in short encapsulated push/pull tests is evaluated analytically. The percentage difference of axial load in push and pull tests is calculated based on the failure mode analysis and the corresponding mechanical models of rock <b>bolting</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> Analytical results show that Poisson 2 ̆ 7 s ratio effect is closely related to the radial stiffness and embedded length. The theoretical predictions were compared with experimental data and showed good agreement, and so {{can be used as a}} guideline in laboratory testing design...|$|R
