40|$|Objective: Although several {{hypotheses}} {{have been}} suggested, the underlying mechanism of coronary slow flow phenomenon (CSFP) {{has not been}} well established yet. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the roles of plasma apolipoprotein-B 100 (Apo-B) and apolipoprotein-A 1 (Apo-A 1) in CSFP which have an atherogenic effect and anti-atherogenic effects respectively. Methods: The study consisted of 31 patients with CSFP (group 1), 28 normal subjects as control group(group 2) and 30 patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) (group 3) detected by coronary angiography. CSFP was diagnosed by the TIMI frame count method. Blood Apo-B, Apo-A 1, Apo-B/Apo-A 1 ratio, and demographic parameters were compared <b>between</b> the <b>groups.</b> Results: The Apo-B values were 93 ± 25 mg/dL, 90 ± 26 mg/dL, and 106 ± 27 mg/dL in groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively (p= 0. 048 <b>between</b> <b>group</b> 1 and 3, p= 0. 041 <b>between</b> <b>group</b> 2 and 3, p= NS <b>between</b> <b>group</b> 1 and 2). TheApo-A 1 values were 127 ± 14 mg/dL, 125 ± 21 mg/dL and 106 ± 27 mg/dL in groups 1, 2 and 3 respectively (p= 0. 028 <b>between</b> <b>group</b> 1 and 3, p= 0. 021 <b>between</b> <b>group</b> 2 and 3, p= NS <b>between</b> <b>group</b> 1 and 2). The apo-B/apo-A 1 ratio were 0. 73 ± 0. 18, 0. 69 ± 0. 23 and 0. 98 ± 0. 20 in groups 1, 2 and 3 respectively (p= 0. 017 <b>between</b> <b>group</b> 1 and 3, p= 0. 010 <b>between</b> <b>group</b> 2 and 3, p= NS <b>between</b> <b>group</b> 1 and 2). Conclusion: Although lower levels of plasma Apo-A 1 and higher levels of Apo-B and the ratio of Apo-B to Apo-A 1 are related with CAD, there is no relationship between these apolipoproteins and CSFP...|$|R

40|$|Background : Diabetes melitus {{may lead}} to serious {{disorders}} of reproduction system. One {{of them can be}} the increase on abnormal morphology of sperm, that can cause infertility. This condition can occur because testosterone, which have main effect on spermatogenesis, decrease in diabetes melitus. From previous study, it had been known that Nigella sativa can increase testosterone level if it is used continually. The {{purpose of this study was}} to know the effect of Nigella sativa on sperm morphology of alloxan-induced diabetic mice. Method : This experimental research used Post Test-Only Control Group Design. The sample were 30 Balb/c male mice, which divided into five groups. Group K 1 (negative control) was untreated group. Group K 2 (positive control), P 1, P 2, and P 3 (treated group) were given a single intraperitoneal injection of alloxan with dosage 3, 75 mg on 1 st day. On 4 th day until 15 th day, group P 1, P 2 and P 3 were given Nigella sativa oil everyday. The dosage for each group was 0, 1 ml, 0, 2 ml and 0, 3 ml. On 16 th day all mice were sacrificed and the sperm morphology was examined. Result : Based on examination in sperm morphology, it was found that abnormal morphology of group K 2 was significantly higher than K 1 (p= 0, 005), and P 3 (p= 0, 049). There wasn’t significant difference <b>between</b> <b>group</b> K 1 and P 1 (p= 0, 688) as well as <b>between</b> <b>group</b> K 1 and P 2 (p= 0, 654), and <b>between</b> <b>group</b> K 1 and P 3 (p= 0, 810). Data analyzed <b>between</b> <b>group</b> K(2) and P(1) showed no significant difference (p= 0, 077) as well as <b>between</b> <b>group</b> K(2) and P(2) (p= 0, 086). Data analyzed <b>between</b> <b>group</b> P 1 and P 2 showed no significant difference (p= 1, 000), as well as <b>between</b> <b>group</b> P 1 and P 3 (p= 0, 999), and <b>between</b> <b>group</b> P 2 and P 3 (p= 0, 999).

A wavering scream may be used in bluff charges against intruders, while a low growl is used for aggressive warning. Hums and coos are more reassuring within the group. Whistles may be used as advance warning of nonhostile intent <b>between</b> <b>groups,</b> although evidence is limited. Newborn pups squeak to elicit attention, while older young whine and wail when they begin to participate in group activities.

5|$|The {{reactions}} of the native Aboriginal inhabitants to the sudden arrival of British settlers in Australia were varied, but were inevitably hostile when the settler's presence led to competition over resources, and to the occupation of the indigenous inhabitants' lands. European diseases decimated Aboriginal populations, and the occupation or destruction of lands and food resources sometimes led to starvation. By and large neither the British nor the Aborigines approached the conflict in an organised sense and conflict occurred <b>between</b> <b>groups</b> of settlers and individual tribes rather than systematic warfare. At times, however, the frontier wars did see the involvement of British soldiers and later mounted police units. Not all Aboriginal groups resisted white encroachment on their lands, while many Aborigines served in mounted police units and were involved in attacks on other tribes.|$|E
