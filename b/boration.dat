50|$|Soluble poisons, {{also called}} {{chemical}} shim, produce a spatially uniform neutron absorption when dissolved {{in the water}} coolant. The most common soluble poison in commercial pressurized water reactors (PWR) is boric acid, which {{is often referred to}} as soluble boron. The boric acid in the coolant decreases the thermal utilization factor, causing a decrease in reactivity. By varying the concentration of boric acid in the coolant, a process referred to as <b>boration</b> and dilution, the reactivity of the core can be easily varied. If the boron concentration is increased, the coolant/moderator absorbs more neutrons, adding negative reactivity. If the boron concentration is reduced (dilution), positive reactivity is added. The changing of boron concentration in a PWR is a slow process and is used primarily to compensate for fuel burnout or poison buildup. The variation in boron concentration allows control rod use to be minimized, which results in a flatter flux profile over the core than can be produced by rod insertion. The flatter flux profile occurs because there are no regions of depressed flux like those that would be produced in the vicinity of inserted control rods. This system is not in widespread use because the chemicals make the moderator temperature reactivity coefficient less negative. All commercial PWR types operating in the US (Westinghouse, Combustion Engineering, and Babcock & Wilcox) employ soluble boron to control excess reactivity. US Navy reactors and Boiling Water Reactors do not.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe Uni ed Modeling Language (UML) {{currently}} {{proposes a}} mechanism to model recurrent design structures: the parameterized collaborations. The main goal of this mechanism is to model the struc- ture of Design Patterns. This is an interesting feature because it can help designers to point out pattern application without spending time with intricate design details. Moreover, it can also help designers to better document their systems and to manage their own design pattern library, {{which could be used}} in di erent systems or projects. However, from a tool perspective, the semantics associated to parameterized collaborations is still vague. To put it more precisely, the underlying representation of a design pattern and of its application, and the binding between these two levels is not exactly de ned, and therefore, can be interpreted in di erent ways. This article has two purposes. First, we point out ambiguities and clarify some misunderstanding points concerning parameterized colla- <b>borations</b> in the ø cial" UML literature. We also show the limits of this mechanism when e ectively modeling design patterns.

Allyl-, allenyl-, and propargylboronate nucleophiles react with carbonyl-containing compounds in a predictable and regioselective manner. Nucleophilic <b>borations</b> using these reagents are known to occur through six-membered transition states, where the carbonyl carbon is activated from the complexation to Lewis acidic boronate species. The ability of boronates to participate in facile and dynamic ligand exchange reactions with chiral alcohols provides opportunity for asymmetric catalysis through the formation of highly reactive chiral boronate nucleophiles in situ. Improved ketone allylborations were achieved using stable cyclic allyldioxaborinanes and BINOLs as chiral catalysts. Enhancement of boronate ligand exchange was revealed through the addition of the sterically hindered Lewis base tert-butanol to promote highly enantioselective allyl- and crotylborations to produce optically enriched tertiary homoallylic alcohols. The asymmetric boronate exchange method was later extended to ketone allenylborations using cyclic allenylboronates with chiral BINOLs to provide tertiary homopropargyl alcohols in excellent enantioselectivities and yields. Cyclic propargylboronates with varying ysubstitutions were then applied to aldehyde allenylborations using vaulted biphenol VANOL as a chiral catalyst in the catalytic boronate exchange method. Propargylborations with dioxaborinanes were determined to be highly enantioselective for a broad range of aldehydes providing various substituted α-allenic alcohols as reaction products...|$|R

40|$|A {{transition}} metal catalyzed benzannulation of alkynylboronates and dienes/diene equivalents {{has been developed}} for the synthesis of aromatic boronic esters. Alkynylboronates participate in a regioselective cycloaddition with 1, 3 -butadiene derivatives, under ambient conditions {{in the presence of}} a cobalt catalyst. The methodology provides a convenient and general route to access 1, 2 -di-substituted, 1, 2, 3 - or 1, 3, 4 -tri-substituted and 1, 2, 3, 4 -tetra-substituted benzene based systems incorporating a boronate moiety. The newly formed aromatic boronic esters can undergo a Suzuki cross-coupling to afford functionalized aminopyridine derivatives. In addition, alkynylboronates participate in benzannulation reactions with cyclobutenones, at room temperature under nickel catalysis. The strategy provides an easy access to highly (tetra/penta) substituted phenol boronic ester derivatives in a remarkably regioselective manner. This chemistry offers an efficient route to quinone boronic esters, as well as the opportunity to carry out benzannulation and cross-coupling reactions in one-pot with a single pre-catalyst. To extend the general strategy, an alternative sequence that employs a palladium catalyzed cyclisation process involving o-alkynylanilines is terminated by a <b>boration</b> reaction to furnish the corresponding indole boronic ester derivatives.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} assessment {{results for}} the Natural Circulation Interruption (NCI) phenomenon during the cooldown phase in a nuclear Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR). This phenomenon could take place due to several circumstances such as an asymmetric cooldown after {{the loss of the}} forced primary flow. Under NCI conditions, the connection of the Reactor Coolant System (RCS) to the Residual Heat Removal System (RHRS) and the homogeneous <b>boration</b> of the RCS could be hindered. Moreover, at very low or no primary flow rates and an operating Safety Injection (SI) system, a Pressurized Thermal Shock (PTS) could occur in the reactor vessel due to cold fluid stratification in the loops. It is therefore important to understand the cause of loop flow stagnation and what could be the appropriate operator actions in order to avoid such phenomenon. The main goal of the current study is to assess the effect of a cooldown strategy upon the single-phase NCI occurrence. For this purpose, two scenarios with asymmetric cooling between the reactor cooling loops were investigated: the first one concerns a Feed Water Line Break (FWLB) combined with a Loss Of Offsite Power (LOOP), while the second one is limited to the LOOP (or any other transient leading to the loss of the forced primary flow). The analyses were carried out using the CATHARE 2 /V 2. 5 _ 1 mod 8. 1 thermal-hydraulic system code. The calculation results emphasize, mainly, the effect of the cooldown rate and the opening strategy of the main steam Atmospheric Discharge Valve (ADV) upon the occurrence of the NCI phenomenon. JRC.

This highly encouraging biological profile makes discodermolide a promising candidate for the synergistic cancer treatment therapy and for clinical development as a chemotherapeutic agent for Taxol-resistant carcinoma. Epothilone is currently under Phase II clinical trials and is 10 folds more effective against multi-drug resistant tumor cells than Taxol. We undertook the synthesis of two microtubule stabilizing agents, discodermolide and epothilone A. 2 ̆ 2 Allyl 2 ̆ 2 <b>boration</b> with a novel aryloxyallylborane based on α-pinene and ring closing metathesis were utilized as the key steps for the synthesis of goniodiol, epigoniodiol and deoxygoniopypyrone. A practical procedure was developed for the large scale preparation of γ-γdimethylallyldiisopinocampheylborane and was utilized for the preparation of C 1 -C 7 subunit of epothilone A. A novel protocol for the synthesis of β-hydroxy-δ-lactones was developed via diastereoselective dihydroxylation and regioselective deoxygenation of α-pyrones and this protocol was applied for the synthesis of C 1 -C 8 and C 15 -C 21 subunits of discodermolide as well as the C 1 -C 6 subunit of epothilone A. An improved methodology based on the bromination of the vinylboronates was developed for the stereoselective synthesis of trisubstituted (Z) -bromoalkenes. This protocol was utilized as a key step for the synthesis of C 9 -C 14 subunit of discodermolide. In conclusion, we have synthesized three cytotoxic natural products goniodiol, epigoniodiol, deoxygoniopypyrone, the C 1 -C 8, C 9 -C 14 and C 15 -C 21 subunits of (+) -discodermolide, and the C 1 -C 6 and C 7 -C 21 subunits of epothilone A. Formal syntheses of both epothilone A and discodermolide were achieved via the synthesis of all the required subunits. ...|$|E
40|$|Purpose / Context - As the {{emerging}} digital technology, Building Information Modelling {{has been applied}} in the multidiscip linary design work for sustainable houses. This study aims to input the real - world design context into the BIM pedagogy and to demons trate the capacity of BIM in e n- hancing teamwork in the cross - disciplinary collaboration. Methodology / Approach – A case study of a Saint Lucia - based residential house project was adopted by utilizing BIM as the platform {{to carry on the}} redesign plan di ffering from an existing design. Nine different student design teams from the University of Nottingham Ningbo China, each team consisting of students from architecture, civil engineering, and architectural environmental engineering, worked in the BIM - based platform to provide solutions on architectural model, stru c- tural design, cost estimate, and sustainability in terms of energy efficiency. Each team’s design plan was presented and evaluated by academics, the client, and construction professionals. Results – The case study demonstrates the capacity of BIM in assisting the cross - disciplinary project design. BIM learners gained the practical experience in the team design work. As the pr o- ject deliverable, different design plans were evaluated by the cli ent and the contractor for fu rther developments. The BIM project experience from team members wa s also presente d in this study. Key Findings / Implications – The BIM education provides the insights of how colleague educ a- tion could equip students with the state - of - the - art learning experience by incorporating the real - world project into the BIM pedagogy. BIM, as the coordination platform, could be fully utilized to implement the building design. This case project serves as an example of briding the gap b etween BIM academia and industry. Future BIM education could continue adopting the case study - based experiential learning approach and expand BIM applications from design to the construction stage.   Originality – This work provides the case study in the pedagogical practice demonstrating the BIM - enabled multidisciplinary colla <b>boration</b> in architectural visualization, structural design, budg et control, and sustainability str ategies...|$|E
40|$|The United States (U. S.) nuclear industry, like similar {{process control}} industries, has moved toward {{upgrading}} its control rooms. The upgraded control rooms typically feature digital control system (DCS) displays {{embedded in the}} panels. These displays gather information from the system and represent that information on a single display surface. In this manner, the DCS combines many previously separate analog indicators and controls into a single digital display, whereby the operators can toggle between multiple windows to monitor and control {{different aspects of the}} plant. The design of the DCS depends on the function of the system it monitors, but revolves around presenting the information most germane to an operator at any point in time. DCSs require a carefully designed human system interface. This report centers on redesigning existing DCS displays for an example chemical volume control system (CVCS) at a U. S. nuclear power plant. The crucial nature of the CVCS, which controls coolant levels and <b>boration</b> in the primary system, requires a thorough human factors evaluation of its supporting DCS. The initial digital controls being developed for the DCSs tend to directly mimic the former analog controls. There are, however, unique operator interactions with a digital vs. analog interface, and the differences have not always been carefully factored in the translation of an analog interface to a replacement DCS. To ensure safety, efficiency, and usability of the emerging DCSs, a human factors usability evaluation was conducted on a CVCS DCS currently being used and refined at an existing U. S. nuclear power plant. Subject matter experts from process control engineering, software development, and human factors evaluated the DCS displays to document potential usability issues and propose design recommendations. The evaluation yielded 167 potential usability issues with the DCS. These issues should not be considered operator performance problems but rather opportunities identified by experts to improve upon the design of the DCS. A set of nine design recommendations was developed to address these potential issues. The design principles addressed the following areas: (1) color, (2) pop-up window structure, (3) navigation, (4) alarms, (5) process control diagram, (6) gestalt grouping, (7) typography, (8) terminology, and (9) data entry. Visuals illustrating the improved DCS displays accompany the design recommendations. These nine design principles serve as the starting point to a planned general DCS style guide that can be used across the U. S. nuclear industry to aid in the future design of effective DCS interfaces...|$|E
40|$|The {{interest}} on scenarios {{dealing with the}} boron dilution events in PWR-NPP has been increased among the scientific community in the last decades so that research programs have been performed to investigate the boron issue. The nuclear industry pays a special care to the same issue due to the implications on the safety and licensing aspects for the presently operated and new designed Nuclear Power Plants. The boron issue is entirely addressed to five main associated aspects: the formation of diluted boron plugs in specific zones of the primary system, the transport of these slugs, the mixing of the boron diluted plugs, the deboration and <b>boration</b> processes (loss or gain of boron from primary system, respectively) and the reactivity feedback due to entrance of the borated diluted plug in the core. These aspects may be investigated at system level (dilution and boron transport) and at local level (boron mixing) with Thermal Hydraulic System Codes and CFD Codes respectively, in parallel or subsequently to dedicated experimental test campaigns for the investigation on the process mechanism and for the constitution of an experimental data base of test results {{to be used for}} code validation. The assessment of various accident scenarios which might give rise to boron dilution and transport shows that in particular Small Break LOCAs and Natural Circulation scenarios should be investigated to this respect. In fact, during the SBLOCA a diluted borated water slug is formed in the loop seal after a certain period characterized by the natural circulation flow rate at core inlet almost equal to zero or non existent; then the sudden restart of the circulation following primary coolant mass inventory recovery eventually after ECCS actuation is able to transport the boron diluted slug to core inlet. The present research activity is devoted to the analysis of the boron issue through the boron dilution and transport processes based on the analysis {{of the results of the}} experimental test campaign performed at the PKL Integral test facility (under OECD/CSNI projects) addressed to scenarios of Small Break LOCA and Natural Circulation. The study of the experimental tests, the simulation of the experiments using the Relap 5 System Code, the code assessment against these experiments and the characterization of the boron dilution and transport phenomena have been carried out. The boron distribution in the primary system has been characterized, the results of the simulation compared with analogous results of Cathare code and a scaling calculation to NPP have been performed. In order to fulfil the requirement of the OECD/SETH and OECD-PKL projects the data and the results of the boron dilution PKL test campaign are proprietary and cannot be disclosed. Since, in the present thesis, an extensive analysis of the results of the tests and the performance of the system codes to predict the relevant phenomena has been performed and the experimental data are compared with the calculations results, the respect of the above mentioned requirement imposes the restriction on the publication of the chapters 2 and 3 of the thesis and the appendixes...|$|E
