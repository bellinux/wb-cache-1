5|$|Although Bosch's career flourished {{during the}} High Renaissance, {{he lived in}} an area where the beliefs of the medieval Church still held moral authority.

5|$|Although remembered {{primarily}} {{for his role}} in the establishment of the Federal Reserve, Owen worked on a wide range of other issues during his time in the Senate, many of which either reflected the policy agenda of the Progressive Movement or had a direct <b>bearing</b> <b>on</b> the interests of his constituents.|$|E
5|$|As a {{description}} of the origin of the universe, the Big Bang has significant <b>bearing</b> <b>on</b> religion and philosophy.

5|$|Several {{other matters}} were also raised, {{relating}} to particular {{parts of the}} evidence (specifically, relating to the witness testimony of Yahya Goba, one of the Buffalo Six), but these matters had little <b>bearing</b> <b>on</b> the final outcome of the case, and were dealt with only briefly by the court.

5|$|Almost {{all members}} of the Council are members of a {{political}} party at national level, and most of these are members of a European-level political party. However the Council is composed to represent the EU's states rather than political parties and the nature of coalition governments {{in a number of states}} means that individual configurations would vary on which domestic party was assigned the portfolio. However the broad ideological alignment of each state does have a <b>bearing</b> <b>on</b> the nature of the law the Council produces and the extent to which the link between domestic parties puts pressure on the members in the European Parliament to vote a certain way.|$|E
5|$|Counsel {{assisting}} the Inquiry, Henry Winneke, advocated {{that the cause}} of the accident was Spence's diabetes. Justice Simpson was critical of the Director-General's investigation panel for considering 25 possible causes of the accident but failing to consider that the Department's negligence in licensing a diabetic pilot might have been the root cause of the accident. After the inquiry had received all available information related to Spence's diabetes, Justice Simpson said the insulin reaction of the pilot might have had a considerable <b>bearing</b> <b>on</b> the accident.|$|E
5|$|In his welterweight debut and {{his first}} fight under Team Rough House affiliation, Wallhead was victorious. The fight took place at Cage Warriors: Strike Force 3 where Wallhead faced Greco-Roman wrestler Steve Singh-Sidhu. Though Wallhead had dropped to welterweight, {{he still had a}} {{considerable}} weight advantage over his opponent who weighed in at 3.5kg less than Wallhead. This perhaps was significant as Singh-Sidhu's strikes seemed to have little <b>bearing</b> <b>on</b> Wallhead, who was able to land takedowns and a standing choke. Midway through the first round, Singh-Sidhu appeared to be backing away from Wallhead, who chased him down with punches and knees to the head. After a shin strike to the head, Singh-Sidhu's corner threw in the towel, resulting in a first-round TKO victory for Wallhead.|$|E

5|$|Justice Potter Stewart, {{joined by}} Justice Hugo Black, dissented. Stewart {{acknowledged}} that the Wolf River Treaty unquestionably conferred hunting and fishing rights on the tribe and its members. He stated that the Termination Act subjected {{the members of the}} tribe to the same laws that all other citizens of Wisconsin were held to, including hunting and fishing regulations. In Stewart's opinion, Public Law 280 had no <b>bearing</b> <b>on</b> the case and the rights were not protected by the Termination Act, so they were lost. Stewart did note that this would have also made the claim for compensation valid under Shoshone Tribe v. United States, regardless of whether Congress intended it or not. He would have reversed the decision of the Court of Claims.|$|E
5|$|The {{meaning of}} the word law in Article 9(1) has a direct <b>bearing</b> <b>on</b> the scope of the Article. If law is read broadly (for example, as {{incorporating}} customary international law principles), the scope of the fundamental liberties would be wider. It would be narrower if, on the other hand, law is construed narrowly, as the Legislature would be able to curtail such rights through legislation more easily. This could lead to a watering-down of the emphasis on fundamental liberties, as any infringement might be considered legitimate so long as the statute in question was validly enacted.|$|E
5|$|Whorf's views {{have been}} {{compared}} to those of philosophers such as Friedrich Nietzsche and the late Ludwig Wittgenstein, both of whom considered language to have important <b>bearing</b> <b>on</b> thought and reasoning. His hypotheses have also {{been compared to}} the views of psychologists such as Lev Vygotsky, whose social constructivism considers the cognitive development of children to be mediated by the social use of language. Vygotsky shared Whorf's interest in gestalt psychology, and he also read Sapir's works. Others have seen similarities between Whorf's work and the ideas of literary theorist Mikhail Bakhtin, who read Whorf and whose approach to textual meaning was similarly holistic and relativistic. Whorf's ideas have also been interpreted as a radical critique of positivist science.|$|E

5|$|An {{individual}} {{domestic animal}} {{could also be}} regarded as a zduhać, such as a shepherd dog, ox, bellwether, horse, or billy goat. If an animal habitually made vocal sounds in sleep, it was assumed to be a zduhać. Such an animal was cherished, and was not for sale. The spirit of the animal zduhać would leave its body in sleep and fight against the enemy zduhaći, to protect its own flock or herd. Only the fertility of the livestock depended on the outcome of the battles fought by the animal zduhaći; they had no <b>bearing</b> <b>on</b> the crop yield. In the region of Užice, western Serbia, it was believed that storms and hail clouds were led by zduhaći who flew above them in the form of big birds. A black ox and a three-year-old rooster defended their village from them—especially the rooster, for which reason he was not killed for food, but kept as a home guardian. In folk spells for repelling hail clouds in Serbia, these clouds were called white cattle. This could be compared with the idea of the black ox as a defender from hail.|$|E
5|$|Beebe was {{relatively}} undeterred by the scientific community's acceptance of Heilmann's rejection of his theory, as {{is evidenced by}} the fact that he was still writing about his Tetrapteryx hypothesis well into the 1940s. His adherence to his theory was well-placed, as in 2003 a revolutionary discovery was made in the early Cretaceous Jiufotang Formation of Liaoning, China: Microraptor gui, the small, four-winged dromaeosaur that had led to renewed credence of the arboreal model for the origin of bird flight. This animal's most remarkable feature was the existence of long, pennaceous feathers on both its arms and legs, forming a set of four aerodynamic wings that its discoverers theorized were used for gliding. This discovery had the immediate effect of resurrecting the idea that leg feathers may have had some <b>bearing</b> <b>on</b> the origin of flight in birds, building on the idea originally proposed by Beebe and rejected by Heilmann.|$|E
5|$|Gotland, {{as a free}} {{republic}} loosely {{associated with}} the Swedish crown, had already borne a ram with a banner (Agnus Dei) as a well-known city seal by 1280. Although the island belonged to Denmark at the time, its arms were present at Gustav Vasa's funeral procession in 1560; the arms of Gotland disappeared from the Swedish rolls in 1570 but returned with the transfer of Gotland to Sweden in 1645. The coat of arms is represented with a ducal coronet. Blazon: Azure, a ram statant argent armed Or, <b>bearing</b> <b>on</b> a cross-staff of the same a banner Gules bordered and with five tails of the third.
