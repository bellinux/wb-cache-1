5|$|George Harrison met his wife-to-be, Patricia Boyd, {{on the set}} {{when she}} made a brief (uncredited) {{appearance}} {{as one of the}} schoolgirls on the train. His initial overtures to her were spurned <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> boyfriend at the time but he persisted and they were married within 18 months. The girl with Boyd in the dining car scene is Prudence Bury. Phil Collins, within a few years a band member of Genesis, was an uncredited schoolboy extra in the concert audience.|$|E
5|$|Her first {{position}} as a professor was at Rutgers School of Law–Newark in 1963. The appointment was not without its drawbacks; Ginsburg was informed she would be paid less than her male colleagues <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> husband with a well-paid job. At the time Ginsburg entered academia, {{she was one of}} fewer than twenty female law professors in the United States. She was a professor of law, mainly civil procedure, at Rutgers from 1963 to 1972, receiving tenure from the school in 1969.|$|E
5|$|She {{attended}} Northwest Missouri State Teachers College, {{majoring in}} mathematics {{with a minor}} in English and graduating in 1945. Jennings was awarded the only mathematics degree in her class. Although she had originally intended to study journalism, she decided to change to mathematics <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> bad relationship with her adviser. Later in her life, she earned a master's degree in English at the University of Pennsylvania in 1967 and was awarded an honorary doctorate degree from Northwest Missouri State University in 2002.|$|E

5|$|The Flapper awoke {{from her}} {{lethargy}} of sub-deb-ism, bobbed her hair, {{put on her}} choicest pair of earrings {{and a great deal}} of audacity and rouge and went into the battle. She flirted because it was fun to flirt and wore a one-piece bathing suit <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> good figure... she was conscious that the things she did were the things she had always wanted to do. Mothers disapproved of their sons taking the Flapper to dances, to teas, to swim and most of all to heart.|$|E
5|$|Although Susan Hayward was {{reported}} to be in the running for one of the two female leads, Julie Harris was chosen for the role of Eleanor Lance. Wise had seen Harris on stage, and felt she was right for the part of the psychologically fragile Eleanor. Harris agreed to do the film in part because the role was complex and the idea of the house taking over Eleanor's mind was interesting. But she also chose it <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> long-standing interest in parapsychology. English actress Claire Bloom was cast as Theo. In part, however, the decision to cast Bloom and Johnson was because of Eady Levy requirements that the cast be partly British. To make Bloom's character appear more bohemian, beatnik clothing designer Mary Quant was hired to design mod clothing specifically for the Theodora character.|$|E
5|$|During the match, she {{was knocked}} onto her right side, and {{her right arm}} became trapped {{underneath}} her wheelchair, causing a tendon in her elbow to rupture. Tracey Ferguson, the Canadian player who knocked her down tried to block the way for Australian officials to help her up. Carter lost considerable mobility in her right arm, and required an elbow reconstruction. She spent 11 weeks on a continuous passive motion machine getting treatment. Nine operations were required to treat the elbow. <b>Because</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> pre-existing condition, the insurance company refused {{to pay for her}} treatment, although it paid her $7,500 in return for agreeing not to take legal action. Carter carried a lot of anger towards the Canadian in the first year following her accident. By 2004, she still could not fully flex her hand. Following her accident, she occasionally required the use of an electric wheelchair because of the severity of her injury, and needed the assistance of the Council's Home Care to clean her home. Before 2000, she had mostly been coached by national team coach Peter Corr.|$|E

5|$|In the meantime, Miceli {{became an}} {{instructor}} at the WCW Power Plant, where she helped train women such as Nora Greenwald (Molly Holly) to wrestle. Before WCW's collapse, she engaged in a brief feud with Torrie Wilson and Shane Douglas, who defeated her and partner Billy Kidman at Fall Brawl in a Mixed Tag Team Scaffold match. Madusa took a big bump during this match and wasn't seen again on WCW TV. She left the company when she heard that Vince McMahon, {{the owner of the}} World Wrestling Federation, was going to buy WCW. <b>Because</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> previous falling-out with McMahon, she opted not to stay with the company. She retired from professional wrestling for good in 2001 because she did not like the direction in which women's wrestling was going; according to her, it was becoming less about real wrestling and more about Bra and Panties matches.|$|E
25|$|In late March 1680, Shivaji {{fell ill}} with fever and dysentery, dying around 3–5 April 1680 {{at the age}} of 52, on the eve of Hanuman Jayanti. Putalabai, the childless eldest of the {{surviving}} wives of Shivaji committed sati by jumping in his funeral pyre. The other surviving spouse, Sakwarbai, was not allowed to follow suit <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> young daughter.|$|E
25|$|On Saturday, August 15, 1998, an 8-year-old girl {{died of a}} {{heart attack}} a week before her 9th birthday, after she rode the Screaming Yellow Eagle (now known as Danny Phantom Ghost Zone), a {{rotating}} platform ride from Chance Rides. Her parents said she died from a heart attack <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> history of heart problems for five years before her death. The ride was normally operating properly.|$|E

25|$|In January 2006, Paxman was {{the subject}} of an episode of the BBC {{genealogy}} series Who Do You Think You Are?. The documentary concluded that he was descended from Roger Packsman, a 14th-century politician from Suffolk who had changed his name to Paxman in order to impress the electorate (pax being Latin for 'peace'). Paxman's maternal grandmother was born in Glasgow, Scotland. The programme generated much publicity before its transmission by displaying him with tears in his eyes on camera when informed that his impoverished great-grandmother Mary McKay's poor relief had been revoked <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> child out of wedlock.|$|E
500|$|A provincial tour of Pagan in the Parlour {{began in}} September 1952 and it {{appeared}} that the play would be a hit. However, Hermione Baddeley, starring in the play as the cannibal [...] "Noo-ga", was drinking heavily and began engaging in bizarre antics and disrupting performances. <b>Because</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> run of the play contract she could not be replaced and so producers were forced to close the show.|$|E
500|$|Woo {{appeared}} for {{the first}} time in the second season as a client suing a Howard Stern-like talk show host named Wick. [...] She was suing because Wick's programs contributed to sexual harassment in her workplace. [...] Wick claimed Woo brought suit <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> [...] "slutty little Asian thing going", and Woo said that she wanted to sleep with Wick because if she did, she would kill him. The character proved to be a hit, and Liu was signed on as a regular for the series.|$|E

500|$|Mansfield's derrière is also {{repeatedly}} {{referred to}} in popular culture. On an episode of Gilmore Girls, Lorelai goes fishing with Alex. She catches a fish, brings it home and names it Jayne Mansfield <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> [...] "great tail switch." [...] In a sketch entitled The Worst Job I Ever 'Ad in the 1976 LP Derek and Clive Live by comedians Peter Cook and Dudley Moore, known as Derek and Clive, Clive (Cook) had the terrible job of retrieving lobsters from Mansfield's derrière. In The Broom of the System, a novel by David Foster Wallace, much of the story happens in East Corinth, a Cleveland suburb designed to look like Mansfield's curves from a bird's eye view.|$|E
500|$|On {{hearing of}} the twins' {{interest}} in the show, Brock Akil asked them if their management was aware of her writing style. When questioned by Brock Akil, Tia responded: [...] "I'm a woman, Mara. I can do this." [...] Though Tia was chosen for the part, Tamera later appeared as a guest star during the show's fifth season. Brock Akil said that Tia won the role over Tamera <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> more [...] "serious personality" [...] and [...] "made all the necessary adjustments to get this part". The producer explained that she appreciated Tia's work ethic and her strong {{desire to be a}} part of the series; she described Tia's audition as [...] "fighting everybody's preconceived notions of her" [...] by playing the more mature Melanie.|$|E
500|$|... was {{in trouble}} at that time <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> couple of engagements that she didn't keep up. But what people didn't realise at that time, that she really knew, and in fact I didn't even know it when we were making the record, and now looking at the whole thing; {{she knew that she}} was in a lot of trouble; that she wasn't going to live. And it wasn't drugs. It was alcohol toward the end... It was such a sad thing because... she was the only singer that really sang what I call the 'right way' because she was a great jazz-pop singer... She was really a great jazz singer. A true jazz singer. And I regret that because that's the 'right way' to sing.|$|E

50|$|Sasamoto {{was born}} in Tokyo, Japan. She went to college of home economics, but quit <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> {{ambition}} to become a painter. After the dropout, she went to an institute of painting (without telling parents) and a dressmaking school.|$|R
500|$|Despite this success, the Shaughnessy {{connection}} {{was not the}} breakthrough she had hoped for. Schuur failed to impress bandleader Doc Severinsen, who turned her down when she auditioned for a guest spot on Johnny Carson's Tonight Show. Some {{people in the industry}} dubbed her [...] "Lady Overkill" [...] <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> tendency to oversing or tried to put everything she knew into a brief space. For the next three years, Shuur performed in clubs and sharpened her skills. Jazz saxophonist Stan Getz, who had been impressed when he heard her sing [...] "Amazing Grace" [...] at Monterey in 1979, did not give up on her. He became her advisor and coach. Discussing Getz in this role, Schuur stated, [...] "he really was a mentor of mine. He taught me that less is more." ...|$|E
500|$|Dame Kelly Holmes, who was {{mentioned}} in the episode, was considered for {{the part of the}} torchbearer, but was committed to Dancing On Ice at the time. Nina Sosanya and Abdul Salis had both appeared in the 2003 film Love Actually. Abisola Agbaje, who portrayed Chloe, was discovered at an after-school drama club, where casting director Andy Pryor had held auditions for the part. Agbaje had to play both Chloe's normal character and her character while being possessed by the Isolus, which Agbaje felt was [...] "weird". When performing as the Isolus she had to whisper, and an echo was added in post-production. Agbaje found it [...] "a bit hard to whisper" [...] <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> husky voice. A hand double for Agbaje drew the pictures, while the series' storyboarder Shaun Williams drew the father in the cupboard.|$|E
500|$|The {{death of}} Capt. William P. Halliday {{is a great}} loss to Cairo. [...] It will take {{the people of this}} city a long time to {{appreciate}} how much of a friend he was. [...] His resources were so great and his willingness to help was always to be relied upon. [...] Cairo has won a great reputation as a host, but it was <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> Capt. Halliday. [...] When there was any entertainment of distinguished guests to be planned, it was done on a magnificent scale because Capt. Halliday’s purse was drawn upon for such {{a large part of the}} bill. [...] In this way Cairo won fame as a hospitable city. [...] She was able to outdo her rivals who had no Capt. Hallidays. [...] Now Cairo will have to fall back on a plane with the others.|$|E
