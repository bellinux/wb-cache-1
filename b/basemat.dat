40|$|In the United States, about {{a hundred}} million gallons of {{high-level}} nuclear waste are stored in underground containments. Basically, these containments are of two different designs: single-shell and double-shell structures. The single-shell structures consist of reinforced concrete cylindrical walls seated on circular mats and enclosed on top with torispherical domes or circular flat roofs. The walls and the <b>basemats</b> are lined with carbon steel. The double-shell structures provide another layer of protection and constitute a completely enclosed steel containment within the single-shell structure leaving an annular space between the two walls. Single-shell containments are of earlier vintage and {{were built in the}} period 1945 - 1965. Double-shell structures were built through the 1960 s and 1970 s. Experience gained in building and operating the single-shell containments was used in enhancing the design and construction of the double-shell structures. Currently, there are about 250 underground single-shell and double-shell structures containing the high-level waste with an inventory of about 800 million curies. During their service lives, especially in early stages, these structures were subjected to thermal excursions of varying extents; also, they have aged in the chemical environment. Furthermore, in their remaining service lives, the structures may be subjected to loads for which they were not designed, such as larger earthquakes or chemical explosions. As a result, the demonstration of safety of these underground nuclear containments poses a challenge to structural engineers, which increases with time. Regardless of current plans for gradual retrieval of the waste and subsequent solidification for disposal, many of these structures are expected to continue to contain the waste through the next 20 - 40 years. In order to verify their structural capabilities in fulfilling this mission, several studies were recently performed at Brookhaven National Laboratory...|$|R

The North Anna NPP is operated by the Virginia Electric and Power Company (VEPCO) commonly called Dominion Power Company and has two pressurized water re-actor (PWR) units that began operation in 1978 and 1980. Following the earthquake, both units were safely shut down. The strong-motion records were processed to get velocity, displacement, Fourier amplitude, and 5 %-damped response spectra.

40|$|SC wall piers are {{composite}} {{alternatives to}} conventional reinforced concrete (RC) shear walls where the steel rebar curtains {{are replaced by}} steel faceplates on the exterior surfaces of the walls. This approach expedites construction by {{eliminating the need for}} additional formwork and staging of concrete casting. This approach can also provide structural efficiency if the SC wall cross-section is detailed appropriately with adequate connector elements, i. e. shear connectors and tie bars. The connector elements provide composite action and also restrain the steel faceplates from buckling prematurely (before yielding). Additionally, the concrete infill prevents the steel faceplates from buckling inwards thus improving their stability. ^ Steel-plate composite (SC) walls are being used in the third generation (Gen. III) of safety-related nuclear facilities and they are also being considered for small modular reactors (SMRs) of the future. There is also growing interest in the use of SC walls for commercial building applications in seismic regions. This interest stems from the perceived structural efficiency and construction (or schedule) economy of modular composite construction. This study describes the seismic behavior, analysis and design of steel-plate composite (SC) walls and their <b>basemat</b> anchorage connections. Three sets of large scale tests were conducted to investigate: (i) the in-plane behavior and design of rectangular SC wall piers without boundary elements, (ii) the performance of two different SC wall pier-to-concrete <b>basemat</b> connections, and (iii) the direct shear strength of reinforcement bar-coupler anchors for SC walls. Test results were used to benchmark 3 D nonlinear inelastic finite element models including material inelasticity and geometric nonlinearity. The benchmarked models were used to conduct parametric studies to evaluate the effects of reinforcement ratio, wall thickness, and aspect ratio (wall height/wall length) on the in-plane behavior of SC wall piers.

Selected regulatory instruments, such as the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), Regulatory Guides, and ASME Codes, were investigated {{to determine the extent}} to which these regulations apply aging management to selected safety-related components in nuclear power plants. The Regulatory Instrument Review was funded by the NRC under the Nuclear Plant Aging Research (NPAR) program.

This model, designed and constructed by the Nuclear Power Engineering Corp., was subjected to seismic simulation tests using the high-performance shaking table at the Tadotsu Engineering Laboratory in Japan. A group of tests representing design-level and beyond-design-level ground motions were first conducted to verify design safety margins.

The analysis was performed by ANATECH Corp. and Sandia National Laboratories for the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission, employing state-of-the-art finite-element software specifically developed for concrete structures. Three-dimensional time-history analyses were performed, first as pre-test blind predictions to evaluate the general capabilities of the analytical methods, and second as post-test validation of the methods and interpretation of the test result.

40|$|The molten core-concrete {{interaction}} (MCCI) {{is treated}} {{as one of the}} important phenomena that may lead to the late containment failure by <b>basemat</b> penetration in a hypothetical severe accident of light water reactors (LWRs). The earlier research has showed that heat transfer limitation exists for the coolability of ex-vessel corium by atop water flooding due to crust formation on the melt/water interface that will isolate melt from water. However, several cooling mechanisms were identified in a series of intense investigations. A code (CORQUENCH) was developed and updated to incorporate the newly identified cooling mechanisms for the better predictions of cavity erosion and corium cooling behaviors. A description about such cooling mechanisms (i. e., bulking cooling, water ingression, eruption and crust breach) and the concrete ablation models implemented in the code is presented in this thesis. The technical work in the thesis includes two parts: first, the verification and validation of the code were performed against the CCI tests from the OECD/MCCI projects; and then a reactor-scale simulation was carried out for MCCI and ex-vessel corium coolability of a reference PWR with LCS concrete. The calculations of CCI tests have a plausible agreement with the experimental data. The calculation predicts an optimistic result for the reactor case, and a fast quenching achieved at about 145 minutes. In addition, a sensitivity study was also conducted on several important parameters, i. e., concrete type, corium composition, water flooding time, atmosphere pressure, concrete ablation temperature, initial temperature, decay power, cavity geometry, concrete decomposition model and melt upper heat transfer model. An attempt to explain the physics of the different predicted phenomena is presented as well. Finally, comparative calculations were performed by the other codes (ASTEC and FinCCI) for the same reactor-scale configuration. Discrepancies are found in the results.

40|$|The {{early stages}} of a severe {{accident}} are characterised by a loss of cooling capability in the reactor core and subsequent rise in {{temperature of the fuel}} & cladding to well in excess of typical operating temperatures. This results in various interactions and reactions between the UO 2 fuel, Zircaloy cladding, moderator and reactor internal structures to produce a high temperature aggressive liquid, or corium, capable of dissolving the remaining reactor internal materials (in-vessel scenario), or even penetrate the reactor vessel wall and react with the <b>basemat</b> of multiphase concrete (ex-vessel scenario). Research on these various and complex high-temperature systems is clearly needed on a broad front. This includes both the determination of single compound thermodynamic properties and large-scale integral tests to test complex corium phases. Experimental data can support and validate modelling of properties of simpler and more complex systems. At JRC-ITU small scale testing of typical high temperature systems for the in-vessel scenario, as well as examination of irradiated fuel/cladding interactions has been and is carried out {{in the context of the}} main international research programmes on severe accidents.

These will be compared with other results of corium structure analysis stemming from major irradiated fuel examinations such as Phébus PF project or the TMI- 2 post-accident investigation programmes.

40|$|Although {{extensive}} {{research has been}} conducted {{over the last several years}} in the areas of Core-Concrete Interaction (CCI) and debris coolability, two important issues warrant further investigation. The first issue concerns the effectiveness of water in terminating a CCI by flooding the interacting masses from above, thereby quenching the molten core debris and rendering it permanently coolable. This safety issue was investigated in the EPRI-sponsored Melt Attack and Coolability Experiments (MACE) program. The approach was to conduct large scale, integral-type reactor materials experiments with core melt masses ranging up to two metric tons. These experiments provided unique, and for the most part repeatable, indications of heat transfer mechanism(s) that could provide long term debris cooling. However, the results did not demonstrate definitively that a melt would always be completely quenched. This was due to the fact that the crust anchored to the test section sidewalls in every test, which led to melt/crust separation, even at the largest test section lateral span of 1. 20 m. This decoupling is not expected for a typical reactor cavity, which has a span of 5 - 6 m. Even though the crust may mechanically bond to the reactor cavity walls, the weight of the coolant and the crust itself is expected to periodically fracture the crust and restore contact with the melt. Although crust fracturing does not ensure that coolability will be achieved, it nonetheless provides a pathway for water to recontact the underlying melt, thereby allowing other debris cooling mechanisms to proceed. A related task of the current program, which is not addressed in this particular report, is to measure crust strength to check the hypothesis that a corium crust would not be strong enough to sustain melt/crust separation in a plant accident. The second important issue concerns long-term, two-dimensional concrete ablation by a prototypic core oxide melt. As discussed by Foit the existing reactor material database for dry cavity conditions is solely one-dimensional. Although the MACE Scoping Test was carried out with a two-dimensional concrete cavity, the interaction was flooded soon after ablation was initiated to investigate debris coolability. Moreover, due to the scoping nature of this test, the apparatus was minimally instrumented and therefore the results are of limited value from the code validation viewpoint. Aside from the MACE program, the COTELS test series also investigated 2 -D CCI under flooded cavity conditions. However, the input power density for these tests was quite high relative to the prototypic case. Finally, the BETA test series provided valuable data on 2 -D core concrete interaction under dry cavity conditions, but these tests focused on investigating the interaction of the metallic (steel) phase with concrete. Due to these limitations, there is significant uncertainty in the partition of energy dissipated for the ablation of concrete in the lateral and axial directions under dry cavity conditions for the case of a core oxide melt. Accurate knowledge of this 'power split' is important in the evaluation of the consequences of an ex-vessel severe accident; e. g., lateral erosion can undermine containment structures, while axial erosion can penetrate the <b>basemat,</b> leading to ground contamination and/or possible containment bypass. As a result of this uncertainty, there are still substantial differences among computer codes in the prediction of 2 -D cavity erosion behavior under both wet and dry cavity conditions. In light of the above issues, the OECD-sponsored Melt Coolability and Concrete Interaction (MCCI) program was initiated at Argonne National Laboratory. The project conducted reactor materials experiments and associated analysis to achieve the following technical objectives: (1) resolve the ex-vessel debris coolability issue through a program that focused on providing both confirmatory evidence and test data for the coolability mechanisms identified in MACE integral effects tests, and (2) address remaining uncertainties related to long-term 2 -D core-concrete interactions under both wet and dry cavity conditions. Data from the various tests conducted as part of the program are being used to develop and validate models and codes that are used to extrapolate the experimental findings to plant conditions. Achievement of these technical objectives will demonstrate the efficacy of severe accident management guidelines for existing plants, and provide the technical basis for better containment designs of future plants.

Ex-vessel coolability of a molten pool and/or debrisis, perhaps the most vexing remaining issue, needingresolution, in the beyond the design-base safety assessment forthe current and the future light water reactor plants. Latephase of the progression of a severe accident is associatedwith corium-melt discharge from the Reactor Pressure Vessel(RPV) and its relocation on the concrete <b>basemat</b> in the form ofa debris bed consisting of liquid/particulate corium. The coredebris generates decay heat and attacks the concrete basematand the containment structures and continues to do so, untilthe coolability of debris bed is achieved. Failure to assurethe coolability of the debris bed is tantamount to the failureto assure the termination of the severe accident. A researchprogram named DECOBI was developed at the Nuclear Power Safetydivision of the Royal Institute of Technology to study thecoolability of melt pools with bottom coolant injection whichoccurs passively through nozzles embeddedin concrete whichopen after ablation of a predetermined depth of concretebasemat. The research objective was to explore the mechanism ofhigh heat transfer and in particular the large scale porosityformation. In the DECOBI program first a series of experimentswere performed at low temperature, by using transparent pooland coolant that allows the visualization of the flow patternduring the pool-coolant interaction. The parameters governingthe early stages of the coolant phase change and dispersion inthe pool are identified through these visual experiments. Experiments were performed also with metallic (Pb) andbinary oxide simulants (CaO-B 2 O 3, MnO-TiO 2, CaO-WO 3), such that a substantial range of parametersinfluencing coolant-melt interaction and the subsequent debrisstructure was investigated. The molten metal (Pb) has highconductivity and low viscosity, which results in a high heattransfer rate and mixing of pool and coolant. The coolingprocess occurs rapidly and the porosity, after solidificationhas a fine and quite uniform structure. On the contrary theoxide mixture CaO-B 2 O 3 has high temperature, low conductivity, highviscosity and glassy material structure, which resulted inlower heat transfer rate and more difficult pool-coolantmixing. In the coolant-contacted regions, directly above thenozzle locations, an interconnected branched channel typeporosity was obtained. These regions had high porosity and theyquenched due to the continuous passage of coolant, even longafter solidification. The other regions did not developporosity because the crust formed outside the quenched regions,prevented the direct contact of coolant with these regions. These regions, however, could conduct heat to the adjacent coldregions and cooled eventually. The experiments performed usingtheoxide mixtures CaO-WO 3 and MnO-TiO 2 (which have lower viscosity compared to that ofCaO-B 2 O 3 and a ceramic material structure) showed betterpool-coolant mixing and rapid quenching of the melt. Theporosity obtained was uniformly distributed throughout themelt. DECOBI program, thus, reveals that, through this schemeof coolant injection the debris arriving in the containment asa result of vessel failure can be quenched in a relativelyshort time. Analysis performed, based on the insights gainedfrom the experiments, estimates the amount of porosity that canbe obtained with a single nozzle. Thesecond partof the thesis is focused on the issue of thelight gas effects on the efficiency of a Passive ContainmentCooling System (PCCS) for a Boiling Water Reactor. The presenceof hydrogen affects the efficiency of PCCS, sincenon-condensable gases reduce the steam condensation rate andconsequently the efficiency of the condensers. The gasdistribution not only influences the PCC performance but alsoaffects the containment pressure build-up. The data and someanalysis of a series of four system transient tests performedin the PANDA facility, show that retention of non-condensablegas in the DW could mitigate the system pressure. The PCC(Passive Cooling Condenser) operation modes are qualitativelydiscussed and the PCCS performance is analyzed for one test byquantifying the major heat sinks (PCC pools, wetwell pool, RPVwater, structural materials, etc) and comparing them during thetest period with the decay heat (heat source) generated in theRPV. The heat transfer coefficients in one PCC have beendetermined for one test at selected times before, during andafter helium injection. In this way, the effect of light gashas been quantified in term of variation of heat transferrate. Keywords:DECOBI, nuclear severe accident, PANDA,PCCS...|$|E
