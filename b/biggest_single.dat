The purchase of the two jets, valued at 3,534.36 million Bhutanese ngultrum (BTN), was the <b>biggest</b> <b>single</b> purchase ever made by Bhutan, and was largely responsible for a 250 percent increase in the Bhutanese trade deficit over the previous year for the financial year 2004–2005.

5|$|Refrigerated {{ships were}} also made {{possible}} {{through the ice}} trade, allowing perishable goods to be exported internationally, first from the U.S. and then from countries such as Argentina and Australia. Early ships had stored their chilled goods along with the main cargo of ice; the first ships to transport chilled meat to Britain, designed by Bate, adapted the railroad refrigerator cars, using ice {{at either end of}} the hold and a ventilation fan to keep the meat cool. An improved version, invented by James Craven, piped a brine solution through the ice and then the hold to keep the meat cool, and created a drier atmosphere in the hold, preserving the meat better. Natural ice was also used in fishing industries to preserve catches, initially in the eastern American fisheries. In 1858 the Grimsby fishing fleet began to take ice out to sea with them to preserve their catches; this allowed longer journeys and bigger catches, and the fishing industry became the <b>biggest</b> <b>single</b> user of ice in Britain.|$|E

Thus other people pay the price of water pollution, while the private firms' profits are not redistributed to the local population, victims of this pollution.

Local people claim that the amount of Iraqi dead only totalled four, which was seen as more palatable number to acknowledge by the senior British commanders due to the political instability in the region at that time.|$|E
