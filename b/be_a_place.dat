5|$|Capodacqua of La Repubblica {{believed}} that the route favored a rider that could defend well {{and put in a}} good time during the uphill time trial. La Stampa writer Gianni Ranieri felt the two non-uphill time trials would favor Gianni Bugno, while the up-hill time trial could <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> where Claudio Chiappucci could gain time on the field. Pedro Delgado believed the race to be tougher than the Tour de France that same year. The Cima Coppi – the highest point in altitude the race reached – was scheduled to be the Passo dello Stelvio, but the pass was scrapped from the race and the Passo Pordoi – the next highest mountain – became the new Cima Coppi.|$|E
5|$|Stalinist {{officials}} allocated no {{funding for}} the design competition nor for the memorial, and the committee disbanded in 1948; by then many survivors had left the country. In 1949, the town of Sokołów Podlaski protected the camp with a new fence and gate. A work crew with no archaeological experience was sent in to landscape the grounds. In 1958, {{after the end of}} Stalinism in Poland, the Warsaw provincial council declared Treblinka to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> of martyrology. Over the next four years, 127 hectares (318 acres) of land that had formed part of the camp was purchased from 192 farmers in the villages of Prostyń, Grądy, Wólka Okrąglik and Nowa Maliszewa.|$|E
5|$|All the maqamat of Bani Zeid were {{designed}} differently, with some being rustic tombstones and others built more elaborately. The latter types {{consisted of a}} domed mausoleum known as a qubba, a shelter known as a makan nawm, a garden, a well and either a distinguishable olive or oak tree. Most of the upkeep of the buildings was provided by awqaf ("religious endowments"). One of the shrines was considered by the local peasantry to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> to safeguard firewood and outside the reach of potential thieves. The maqamat were also divided by status, with some bearing significance only to an individual village or clan and some collectively revered by {{the residents of the}} sheikhdom. Of all the sites in the Bani Zeid sheikhdom, the most venerated shrine was that of Nabi Salih, dedicated to the prophet (nabi) Salih, which held special significance beyond Bani Zeid.|$|E

5|$|Jerry {{knows what}} the {{situation}} is. I think he's done very well for us, considering we plucked him out of non-league football at Yeovil.

That doesn't mean I don't appreciate what Jerry has done for me since I signed him three-and-a-half years ago. There isn't a more reliable player at the club than Jerry Gill. He captains my reserve team, his fitness is of a very high standard and he has endless enthusiasm. When I put him in the first team, he never lets me down.

5|$|The {{president}} and general manager of Pacific Northwest Theatres, Inc., Harry C. Arthur, believed Seattle to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> of growing importance in the motion picture industry in the mid-1920s, and consequently as the place to invest for the long term. Arthur's company absorbed a competing chain of 40 theatres by 1926, and sought further expansion. A large holder of the theatre company's stock and debt was C. D. Stimson who sat on the board of directors of both Pacific Northwest Theatres and the Metropolitan Building Company, developer of what became known as the Metropolitan Tract. Stimson promoted the establishment of a theatre district like that which had developed around a theatre he had built in Los Angeles, California. The planned Skinner Building with a theatre owned by Arthur's company would complete the Stimson development of the Metropolitan Tract.|$|E

25|$|Brazil {{continued}} {{to try to}} remain neutral to the United States and Germany because {{it was trying to}} make sure it could continue to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> of interest for both opposing countries.

Eventually Brazil decided to stop trading with Germany once Germany started attacking offshore trading ships resulting in Germany declaring a blockade against the Americas in the Atlantic Ocean. Furthermore, Germany also ensured that they would be attacking the Americas soon.|$|E

25|$|Newman {{believed}} {{in a middle}} way between free thinking and moral authority – one that would respect the rights of knowledge {{as well as the}} rights of revelation. His purpose was to build a Catholic university, in a world where the major Catholic universities on the European continent had recently been secularised, and most universities in the English-speaking world were Protestant. For a university to claim legitimacy in the larger world, it would have to support research and publication free from church censorship; however, for a university to be a safe place for the education of Catholic youth, it would have to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> in which the teachings of the Catholic church were respected and promoted.|$|E
25|$|As {{the number}} of {{settlers}} in the area grew, so did demand for a local bench of magistrates as the nearest ones were 100–200 miles away in Tumut and Binalong. In April 1847 {{it was announced that}} Wagga Wagga was to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> for holding petty sessions, dispensing justice and maintaining law and order over an area up to 100 miles away. The courthouse was located with the beginnings of a village formed near the ford used by most traffic passing through the area. The village included a crude blacksmith's shop and hotel. A post office was established in January 1849 and later that year the town was marked out by surveyor Thomas Townshend and formally gazetted as a village on 23 November 1849.|$|E
25|$|In 1960, English {{along with}} Mollie Randle and Councillor Sir Frank Price {{composed}} {{a proposal for}} the creation of an arts centre in the city of Birmingham which they delivered {{to the members of the}} City Council. Between the three of them, they lobbied Birmingham City Council to assist them in their ambitious idea; to which in 1962, the council approved their proposal and responded with a substantial largesse; they donated a site in Cannon Hill Park for the sole use of the MAC; the Midlands Arts Centre for Young People was born. The English's were heavily active in the amateur theatre scene within the city and as a result of the Arena Theatre Company and their experiences during their time there in promoting the arts to a younger generation, in which the concept and ideals of a permanent arts centre became apparent. It would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> to allow younger people to experience a wider range of art forms as well as their practises and traditions. Building work was completed in the mid-1960s with the two small theatres and the studios making up what was now called the Midlands Arts Centre, making it the first centre of its kind in Britain. John English featured in a short Central Office of Information documentary in 1969 titled; The Pacemakers, where he discussed the origins of the MAC, and its ever-changing programme. After 16 years at the helm, he retired from his role of director of the MAC in 1976.|$|E
