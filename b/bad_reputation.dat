40|$|Although a users' opinion or a live {{voice is}} a very useful {{information}} for text mining of the business, {{it is difficult to}} extract good and <b>bad</b> <b>reputations</b> of users from texts written in natural language. The good and <b>bad</b> <b>reputations</b> discussed here depend on users' claims, interests and demands. This paper presents a method of determining these reputations in commodity review sentences. Multi-attribute rule is introduced to extract the reputations from sentences, and four-stage-rules are defined in order to evaluate good and <b>bad</b> <b>reputations</b> step by step. A deterministic multi-attribute pattern matching algorithm is utilized to determine the reputations efficiently. From simulation results for 2, 240 review comments, it is verified that the multi-attribute pattern matching algorithm is 63. 1 times faster than the Aho and Corasick method. The precision and recall of extracted reputations for each commodity are 94 % and 93 % respectively. Moreover, the precision and recall of the resulting reputations for each rule are 95 % and 95 % respectively.

5|$|It was {{originally}} intended to use a gear-driven valve gear, but space restrictions within the frames and wartime material shortages led Bulleid to design his novel chain-driven valve gear. This component was unique amongst British locomotive design practices. It later gained a <b>bad</b> <b>reputation,</b> because it could cause highly irregular valve events, a problem compounded by the fast-moving Bulleid steam reverser. The entire system was located in a sealed oil bath, another unique design, providing constant lubrication to the moving parts.|$|E
5|$|The poem was {{revised and}} {{included}} in Keats's 1820 collection of poetry titled Lamia, Isabella, the Eve of St. Agnes, and Other Poems. Although the publishers Taylor and Hessey feared {{the kind of}} bad reviews that had plagued Keats's 1818 edition of Endymion, {{they were willing to}} publish the collection after the removal of any potentially controversial poems to ensure {{that there would be no}} politically motivated reviews that could give the volume a <b>bad</b> <b>reputation.</b>|$|E
5|$|By 2005, the disused eastern {{trackbed}} {{was filled}} with rubble, brambles and weeds, and the station had acquired a <b>bad</b> <b>reputation</b> due to muggings {{and the use of}} illegal drugs on the station premises. A community garden project, Eastside Roots, was set up in the disused trackbed by local permaculture enthusiast Nick Ward. It was built using sustainable materials, including bricks dug out during the construction of the Cabot Circus shopping centre. The project led to a general improvement of the station ambience, and residents were more willing to use it. The footbridge was replaced in 2013 to allow for electrification of the line, but the new, higher, bridge angered local residents who felt it infringed on their privacy.|$|E

5|$|In all, 45 Israelis were killed, 50 were wounded, and 5 {{captured}} by Egypt. Of them, 29 killed and 34 wounded were from Zur's 54th Company. Egyptian sources reported 15 killed and 30 wounded, although {{this does not}} include the casualties suffered by the intercepted reinforcements from Majdal. Even before the final retreating troops came home, the Givati command had issued a new operation order, calling for renewed artillery and air bombardment of Isdud, and small harassment operations. The 57th Battalion, which gained a <b>bad</b> <b>reputation</b> after its failures in Yibna and Isdud, carried out several such successful operations, regaining prestige in the brigade.|$|E
5|$|The {{greatest}} {{offense to}} the Chinese was the supposed kidnapping of children by the Portuguese {{so they could}} eat them. In reality, Simão had earned the Portuguese a <b>bad</b> <b>reputation</b> for buying young Chinese slaves, presumably {{some of whom were}} kidnapped after Simão offered local Chinese huge sums of money for child slaves. In fact, some boys and girls from wealthy Chinese families were later found by Portuguese authorities at Diu in western India. However, there were no official reports of Simão's abuses, even though he stayed until September 1520; yet rumors of his behavior (which became associated with all Portuguese) no doubt reached as far as the court of Beijing, which would soon condemn the Portuguese for this and other reasons.|$|E
5|$|According to the Arab chroniclers, the {{realization}} of Egypt's vulnerability from the sea led, after {{a long period of}} neglect, to the urgent strengthening of Egypt's maritime defences by Governor Anbasah. Within nine months of the raid, Damietta was refortified along with Tinnis and Alexandria. Various works were undertaken at Rosetta, Borollos, Ashmun, at-Tina, and Nastarawwa. Ships were constructed and new crews were raised. Most seamen were forcibly conscripted from among the Copts and the Arabs of the interior, earning Anbasah a <b>bad</b> <b>reputation</b> in contemporary sources. Complaints against him were directed to Caliph al-Mutawakkil. Later Arabic sources like al-Maqrizi and Coptic sources confirm that the new fleet was used in raids against the Byzantines in subsequent years, although no details are recorded. This activity is generally held to have marked the rebirth of the Egyptian navy. Under the Tulunid dynasty (868–905) it numbered 100 ships and reached its peak later under the Fatimids (969–1171).|$|E

50|$|As Rome grew, so did its tabernae, {{becoming}} more luxurious and acquiring good or <b>bad</b> <b>reputations</b> {{as the case}} may be. One of the best hotels was the Tabernae Caediciae at Sinuessa on the Via Appia. It had a large storage room containing barrels of wine, cheese and ham. Many cities of today grew up around a taberna complex, such as Rheinzabern in the Rhineland, and Saverne in Alsace.|$|R

5|$|Because of {{the large}} number of factions created for the game, {{developers}} reintroduced the reputation system that was first used in Fallout 2 and had been absent in Fallout 3. Much like Karma, a player's standing with a faction can change depending on how they interact with them and what decisions they make. If, for example, players help a faction, their reputation with them improves in all locations controlled by that faction; opting to kill their members will cause a loss of reputation. The type of reputation the player has with each faction affects how non-player characters (NPCs) behave towards them; a good reputation might make completing some quests easier, provide discounts with the faction's vendors, and cause faction members to offer gifts; a <b>bad</b> <b>reputation</b> may lead to the faction refusing to help the player or attacking them on sight, or sending thugs after the player.|$|E
5|$|By the mid-1970s, Thin Lizzy had stabilised around {{founding}} members, {{lead singer}} and bassist Phil Lynott and drummer Brian Downey, alongside guitarists Scott Gorham and Brian Robertson. The band had found commercial success with several hit singles {{and developed a}} strong live following, including headlining the Reading Festival. Robertson had briefly left the band in 1977 but subsequently returned. The group had planned {{to make a new}} studio album at the start of 1978. Working with producer Tony Visconti, Thin Lizzy retained commercial success with the album <b>Bad</b> <b>Reputation,</b> and the group wanted to work with him again. However, Visconti had a very tight schedule and had committed to producing several albums for other artists, so Lynott suggested instead that they spend two weeks together compiling a live album from earlier recordings.|$|E
5|$|The Finns {{had many}} reasons {{to turn down the}} Soviet proposals. Finland had started {{negotiations}} for a military co-operation with Sweden, and the Finns had great hopes for the joint Finnish–Swedish defense for the Ålands islands {{and did not want to}} jeopardize these negotiations. In addition, the violent collectivization, purges, show trials and executions in Stalin's Soviet Union had given the country a <b>bad</b> <b>reputation.</b> Furthermore, most of the Finnish Communist leadership in the Soviet Union was executed during the Great Purge. The Soviet Union did not therefore seem to be a reliable contracting party. The Soviet envoys sent to negotiate with Finns were officially of relatively low rank, but as Väinö Tanner put it later, the Finns assumed rightly that they represented of some higher organ of State, probably the Soviet secret police NKVD.|$|E
60|$|For months, Mabel {{had been}} servantless {{in the big}} house, keeping the home {{together}} in penury for her ineffectual brothers. She had kept house for ten years. But previously, it was with unstinted means. Then, however brutal and coarse everything was, the sense of money had kept her proud, confident. The men might be foul-mouthed, {{the women in the}} kitchen might have <b>bad</b> <b>reputations,</b> her brothers might have illegitimate children. But so long as there was money, the girl felt herself established, and brutally proud, reserved.|$|R
5000|$|Heron {{has also}} {{released}} {{a number of}} solo recordings, mostly more rock-oriented than the Incredible String Band material. The first of these, Smiling Men with <b>Bad</b> <b>Reputations,</b> released in 1971, {{when he was still}} a member of the ISB, took eclecticism to a new extreme, blending rock, folk and world music into an atmospheric whole. Contributing musicians included Pete Townshend, Keith Moon, Duncan Browne and Ronnie Lane (as [...] "Tommy & the Bijoux"), John Cale, Richard Thompson, Dave Mattacks, Simon Nicol, Dave Pegg, Dudu Pukwana, Elton John, and Steve Winwood.|$|R

5|$|The Trinity is {{a popular}} {{whitewater}} rafting and kayaking river. Dam releases for fish restoration have incidentally increased {{the amount of water}} available for boating year-round. The river has three main whitewater runs, all known for their scenery and wildlife. The Pigeon Point section, alongside Highway 299, contains Class II-III (beginner to intermediate) rapids. Below the takeout at Cedar Flat, the Trinity flows through the extremely hazardous Class V Burnt Ranch Gorge, which was first run in 1971 by three kayakers, one of whom {{died of a heart attack}} soon after finishing the run, due to the arduous work of portaging many rapids. This gave the area a <b>bad</b> <b>reputation</b> for many years; it was not until 1983 when commercial trips began on this section of the river. The lower Trinity, much of which flows through the Hoopa Valley Reservation, is a Class II river with gentler and lower gradient despite having a greater volume of water flow.|$|E
5|$|Crowley soon progressed {{through the}} lower grades of the Golden Dawn, {{and was ready}} to enter the group's inner Second Order. He was unpopular in the group; his {{bisexuality}} and libertine lifestyle had gained him a <b>bad</b> <b>reputation,</b> and he had developed feuds with some of the members, including W.B. Yeats. When the Golden Dawn's London lodge refused to initiate Crowley into the Second Order, he visited Mathers in Paris, who personally admitted him into the Adeptus Minor Grade. A schism had developed between Mathers and the London members of the Golden Dawn, who were unhappy with his autocratic rule. Acting under Mathers' orders, Crowley – {{with the help of his}} mistress and fellow initiate Elaine Simpson – attempted to seize the Vault of the Adepts, a temple space at 36 Blythe Road in West Kensington, from the London lodge members. When the case was taken to court, the judge ruled in favour of the London lodge, as they had paid for the space's rent, leaving both Crowley and Mathers isolated from the group. Spence suggested that the entire scenario was part of an intelligence operation to undermine Mathers' authority.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{analyzes}} {{the role of}} referrals {{in the provision of}} surgical services. Primary physicians in managed care control patient access to specialists, while referrals in traditional insurance plans are less constrained. The traditional, fee-for-service insurance market is shown to achieve appropriate incentives for high quality care. In contrast, physicians with <b>bad</b> <b>reputations</b> may not lose HMO's referrals, owing to differences in incentives to cut costs. Empirically, we find that managed care may protect a physician whose reputation has been damaged by providing a source of referrals when shunning occurs in the FFS sector following a malpractice claim...|$|R

25|$|On {{the other}} side {{there are some people}} who prefer to attend private {{institutions}} because they don't trust in the public educational infrastructure they have near their residential area.
