5000|$|While other prior Game Boy titles such as The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening use a <b>battery</b> <b>save</b> {{inside their}} cartridges, Monster Max employs a {{password}} system {{to prevent the}} loss of progress. This choice was made because the additional cost of integrating a <b>battery</b> <b>save</b> was either prohibitive or expensive for the publisher. Ritman also revealed that he passed on the earlier option of having the game published by Nintendo, which would have required replacing the protagonist with an unspecified character from the Mario universe. Although Monster Max was ostensibly released in late 1994, Titus was very slow in destributing it and copies of the game could not be bought until December 1995. As a result, sales for the game were poor. Despite this, it received extremely positive reviews. UK's GB Action magazine gave Monster Max a rating of 94%, while Super Gamer magazine awarded it a rating of 96% under the tagline, [...] "simply the best Game Boy title ever".|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Battery powered mobile devices {{suffer from}} signif-icant power {{consumption}} of the WiFi network interface during video calls. By utilizing the dynamic Power <b>Save</b> <b>Mode</b> (PSM), our study proposes an adaptive RTP packet transmission scheme for multimedia traffic. By merging the outbound packet delivery timing with inbound packet reception and estimating each delay component along the packet processing and trans-mission path, each client manages to meet the stringent end-to-end latency for packets while creating longer sleep intervals. As a benefit it involves no cross-layer communication overhead as the interface state transitions are completely transparent to the application. The experimental results show that 28. 53 % energy savings on the WiFi interface can be achieved while maintaining satisfactory application performance.

The stations that have successfully transmitted ATIM frame within the ATIM window will compete to transmit data frame {{in the rest of the}} beacon interval. The transmission of an ATIM frame depends on the CSMA/CA mechanism specified in the IEEE 802. 11 DCF. The probability of a successful transmission of an ATIM frame has a great impact on the performance of IBSS in power <b>save</b> <b>mode.</b> This paper presents an analytical model to calculate the throughput using the success probability of an ATIM frame transmission in ATIM window of fixed size.

50|$|Like Ethernet, 802.11 {{uses the}} same range of MAC {{addresses}} to map IP multicast addresses. However, an 802.11 wireless network will handle multicast traffic differently, depending on the configuration of delivery traffic indication message (DTIM), and beacon interval settings. If no stations within the basic service set are in power <b>save</b> <b>mode,</b> multicast packets are sent immediately when they arrive. If there are one or more stations in power <b>save</b> <b>mode,</b> access points then only deliver multicast traffic after each DTIM interval, and transmit {{at one of the}} supported rates in the basic rate set. In most retail wireless access points/routers, this interval is either 102.4 ms (Beacon interval = 100ms, DTIM = 1) or 204.8 ms (Beacon interval = 100ms, DTIM = 2) and the transmit rate is either 1 Mbit/s or 6 Mbit/s, depending on the operating band and protection mode. As a result, the DTIM and beacon interval settings should be adjusted for optimum performance when implementing multicast in wireless networks.|$|R

40|$|Wi-Fi is {{the most}} {{prominent}} wireless network interface in current smart devices. Due to its high power consumption, Power <b>Saving</b> <b>Mode</b> (PSM) schemes have been proposed to reduce power consumption. We show how the current popular PSM schemes implemented in nowadays smart devices are inefficient. In this paper, we propose A 2 PSM: an audio channel assisted power saving scheme for the Wi-Fi interface, which address the inefficiency of the existing power saving schemes in smart devices. In this scheme, we leverage the low power consumption of the audio interfaces (mic/speaker) to reduce the wakeup events of the Wi-Fi interface when it is in Power <b>Saving</b> <b>Mode.</b> In this paper, we develop a small-scale prototype testbed on real smartphones to evaluate the proposed A 2 PSM scheme. Experiments show that A 2 PSM could save {{up to more than}} 25 % more power than the existing schemes.
