25|$|The first 5700 locomotive, No. 7711, {{underwent}} trials from January to April 1956, first running between Finchley Road and Baker Street. Modifications {{were needed}} to the cab for clearance and the tripcock <b>brake</b> <b>valves</b> after problems were found when running in reverse. Curtains were also fitted to the cab to reduce smoke and fumes in tunnels. In May, the 5700s became the standard for engineering trains on London Transport when they bought No. 7711 (for £3,160), decided to buy another (No. 5752), and planned to buy more over the coming years.|$|E

50|$|The unit itself used air brakes, {{but it was}} {{equipped}} to operate trains with air or vacuum brakes. The brake system would be set up for either air or vacuum train working {{by means of a}} turning switch on the driver's brake valve and by pre-setting the appropriate <b>brake</b> <b>valves</b> in the corridor.|$|E
5000|$|The driver’s <b>brake</b> <b>valve</b> is self-lapping; the {{position}} of the valve activates a specific brake pressure in the brake cylinders and therefore a specific braking rate.|$|R

50|$|To {{address these}} problems, the TTC {{performed}} fixes taking 2-3 days per streetcar to implement. These included {{the installation of}} new air tanks and filters, the replacement of old tubing to the windshield wipers, repairs on the valves controlling air flow to the rail sanders, overhaul of the <b>brake</b> <b>valves,</b> and the correction of any suspension system deficiencies.|$|E

50|$|As {{had been}} {{specified}} in the original tender documents, the engines were set up with a single set of controls intended to have the long end leading, and this was called the No.1 end. If the short end were to lead, then the driver {{would have had the}} speedo and <b>brake</b> <b>valves</b> behind him, and he may {{not have been able to}} properly see all signals.|$|E
25|$|When {{the engine}} {{operator}} applies the brake by operating the locomotive <b>brake</b> <b>valve,</b> the train line vents to atmosphere at a controlled rate, reducing the train line pressure {{and in turn}} triggering the triple valve on each car to feed air into its brake cylinder. When the engine operator releases the brake, the locomotive <b>brake</b> <b>valve</b> portal to atmosphere is closed, allowing the train line to be recharged by the compressor of the locomotive. The subsequent increase of train line pressure causes the triple valves on each car to discharge {{the contents of the}} brake cylinder to the atmosphere, releasing the brakes and recharging the reservoirs.|$|R
50|$|The {{report found}} that the 7:40 railmotor train had a few {{shortcomings}} related to its equipment. The train could be stopped faster if it were running engine first because the driver could use the <b>brake</b> <b>valve</b> in the engine instead of the somewhat less effective <b>brake</b> <b>valve</b> in the autocoach. Also, {{the way that the}} mechanical linkages were arranged that connected the regulator control from the driving trailer was somewhat unreliable in that there was play in the system that prevented the regulator from being opened fully. There was also an issue where a connecting pin in the regulator linkage was prone to falling out.|$|R

5000|$|A {{steam brake}} acts {{directly}} and immediately; the sudden {{opening of the}} <b>brake</b> <b>valve</b> {{can result in a}} slight overbraking by locking the wheels. The operation of a steam brake therefore requires a great deal of experience from the engine driver.|$|R
5000|$|On a long {{train the}} brake force during a brake {{application}} was not consistent {{along the length}} of the train; the response to the driver’s operation of the <b>brake</b> <b>valve</b> varied according to train length and the variation caused longitudinal surging.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotive}} driver (US: engineer) worked {{on one side}} of the locomotive, and the fireman on the other; the fireboxes separated them. The regulators for both power bogies were located above the centre of the fireboxes, with the steam <b>brake</b> <b>valve</b> at one end.|$|R
