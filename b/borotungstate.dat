50|$|Methods of {{separation}} by specific gravity have a still wider application. The simplest {{of these is}} levigation, which is extensively employed in mechanical analysis of soils and treatment of ores, but is not so successful with rocks, as their components do not, as a rule, differ greatly in specific gravity. Fluids are used that do not attack most rock-forming minerals, but have a high specific gravity. Solutions of potassium mercuric iodide (sp. gr. 3.196), cadmium <b>borotungstate</b> (sp. gr. 3.30), methylene iodide (sp. gr. 3.32), bromoform (sp. gr. 2.86), or acetylene bromide (sp. gr. 3.00) are the principal fluids employed. They may be diluted (with water, benzene, etc.) or concentrated by evaporation.|$|E
40|$|New organophosphonate {{derivatives}} of monovacant Keggin-type polyoxotungstates {{that contain}} naphthyl {{groups have been}} synthesized and characterized in both solid state and solution. Single-crystal structural analysis shows that two phosphonate groups occupy the vacant position of the lacunary cluster unit in the isostructural compounds [N(C 4 H 9) 4] 3 [H(POC 11 H 9) 2 (α-HBW 11 O 39) ] (TBA- 1) and [N(C 4 H 9) 4] 3 [H(POC 11 H 9) 2 (α-SiW 11 O 39) ] (TBA- 2). Liquid-solution UV–Vis transmittance and solid-state diffuse reflectance spectroscopy studies reveal {{the presence of a}} new absorption band in the visible region, the charge transfer character of which has been further confirmed by time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations. The latter evidence that the charge transfer process is dominated by transitions from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), localized in the aromatic ring of the organic group, to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), localized in the Keggin anion. Photoluminescence studies show that the fluorescent properties of the 1 -naphthylmethylphosphonate group are quenched upon its incorporation into the inorganic oxo-tungstate skeleton. The solution stability of the hybrid clusters has been evaluated by a combination of 1 H-, 13 C- and 31 P-Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy and Electrospray Ionization-Mass Spectrometry. The hybrid polyanion [H(POC 11 H 9) 2 (α-HBW 11 O 39) ] 3 − (1) herein constitutes the first structurally characterized organo-p-block containing <b>borotungstate,</b> and hence it confirms that this strategy for the organic functionalization of polyoxometalate clusters can be applied to new platforms belonging to the family of group- 13 heteropolyoxotungstates...|$|E
