5|$|Harding {{wished to}} try again for {{elective}} office. Though a longtime admirer of Foraker (by then a U.S. senator), he had <b>been</b> <b>careful</b> to maintain {{good relations with the}} party faction led by the state's other U.S. senator, Mark Hanna, McKinley's political manager and chairman of the Republican National Committee (RNC). Both Foraker and Hanna supported Harding for state Senate in 1899; he gained the Republican nomination and was easily elected to a two-year term.|$|E
5|$|The direct {{predecessor}} to the Vlaams Blok was the People's Union, {{which was}} founded in 1954 as the successor to the Christian Flemish People's Union electoral alliance, that had successfully run for election earlier the same year. The party had <b>been</b> <b>careful</b> to choose its leaders from nationalist circles that had not collaborated with the Nazis. While Flemish separatists had been suspicious of the People's Union since its outset, it became clear by the 1970s that the party had moved to a moderate left-liberal course, which led to the defection of its more radical members. The remaining nationalist hardliners finally rejected the party's participation in a new five-party government coalition in 1977, and particularly the Egmont pact, believing it had conceded too much to the francophone government parties.|$|E
25|$|LGBT {{participation}} {{is a part}} of the long-governing Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). Since the triumph of the Liberals under President Benito Ju√°rez in the 1860s and the 1910 Revolution, there has been separation of church and state in Mexico. With morality generally considered the province of the Church, the PRI (which considers itself the party of the Revolution) has generally been reluctant to be seen as implementing the will of the Catholic Church. However, it has also <b>been</b> <b>careful</b> not to offend Catholic moral sensibilities.|$|E

25|$|The {{encounter}} between the 274th VC Main Force Regiment and the US 11th Armored Cavalry {{shown in the}} diagram above illustrates several facets of the contending forces. The ambush took place on Highway 1, a vital road artery close to Saigon. There seems to have <b>been</b> <b>careful</b> preparation by Communist forces, including pre-built bunkers to shelter troops from US firepower {{along the line of}} retreat. A number of vehicles were destroyed but US airpower broke up the VC concentrations. A follow-up sweep by US forces killed a small number of additional VC but the bulk of them escaped.|$|E
25|$|The {{new state}} was theocratic, and its system suited Mongols, {{but it was}} not {{economically}} efficient as the leaders were inexperienced in such matters. The Qing dynasty had <b>been</b> <b>careful</b> to check the encroachment of religion into the secular arena; that restraint was now gone. State policy was directed by religious leaders, with relatively little participation by lay nobles. The parliament had only consultative powers; in any event, it did not meet until 1914. The Office of Religion and State, an extra-governmental body headed by a lama, played a role in directing political matters. The Ministry of Internal Affairs was vigilant in ensuring that senior ecclesiastics were treated with solemn deference by lay persons.|$|E
25|$|It {{came as a}} {{shock when}} the first case of local HIV {{infection}} was reported in 1985. It galvanised a group of healthcare personnel (both gay and straight) to set up a non-governmental organisation (NGO) called Action For AIDS (AFA) in 1988 which provided support and counselling for AIDS victims as well as educating the public on safe sex. AFA was not technically part of the Singapore gay movement and has <b>been</b> <b>careful</b> to present itself as an NGO dealing with a public health issue. However, {{a significant portion of the}} energy and leadership behind it has been provided by gay people and in many practical ways AFA has rallied homosexuals around a cause.|$|E

25|$|Whilst in Calabria, Ipomadon {{takes on}} a number of disguises. As far as the King of Sicily's queen is concerned, her darling, whom she loves, hunts all day and, to the derision of her ladies-in-waiting, brings back nothing more honourable in the evening than venison to give to the king, who is engaged in the tournament. In reality, however, Ipomadon has been {{fighting}} at the tournament all day, winning horses for himself, and it is his tutor Ptolomy who has been hunting. Ipomadon fights on the first day in white armour, having changed into it deep in the forest, and wins the acclaim of all. On the second day he fights in red armour and on the third day, in black. Every day he wins the prize and the Proud is devastated when the winning knight does not show up the next morning; particularly so since she learns from her cousin Jason every evening that the victorious knight has been none other than her 'strange or unknown young man'. Ipomadon has <b>been</b> <b>careful</b> to seek out this cousin every evening after the fighting to declare his identity. Well, not quite his complete identity. Having won the fighting on three successive days, Ipomadon leaves secretly again, leaving the Proud once again distraught at his departure.|$|E
25|$|This brought Chichele into {{collision}} with Martin V. The struggle between {{them has been}} represented {{as one of a}} patriotic archbishop resisting the encroachments of the papacy on the Church of England. In point of fact it was almost wholly personal, and was rather an incident in the rivalry between the duke of Gloucester and his half-brother, Cardinal Beaufort, than one involving any principle. Chichele, by appointing a jubilee to be held at Canterbury in 1420, after the manner of the Jubilee ordained by the Popes, threatened to divert the profits from pilgrims from Rome to Canterbury. A ferocious letter from the pope to the papal nuncios, on 19 March 1423, denounced the proceeding as calculated to ensnare simple souls and extort, from them a profane reward, thereby setting up themselves against the apostolic see and the Roman pontiff, to whom alone so great a faculty has been granted by God (Cat. Pap. Reg. vii. 12). Chichele also incurred the papal wrath by opposing the system of papal provision which diverted patronage from English to Italian hands, but the immediate occasion was to prevent the introduction of the bulls making Beaufort a cardinal. Chichele had <b>been</b> <b>careful</b> enough to obtain Papal provisions for himself, his pluralities, his bishopric and archbishopric.|$|E
25|$|Constantius died in 421, {{after only}} seven months as Augustus. He had <b>been</b> <b>careful</b> {{to make sure}} that there was no {{successor}} in waiting, and his own children were far too young to take his place. Honorius was unable to control his own court and the death of Constantius initiated more than ten years of instability. Initially Galla Placidia sought Honorius's favour in the hope that her son might ultimately inherit. Other court interests managed to defeat her, and she fled with her children to the Eastern court in 422. Honorius himself died, shortly before his thirty-ninth birthday, in 423. After some months of intrigue, the patrician Castinus installed Joannes as Western Emperor, but the Eastern Roman government proclaimed the child Valentinian III instead, his mother Galla Placidia acting as regent during his minority. Joannes had few troops of his own. He sent Aetius to raise help from the Huns. An Eastern army landed in Italy, captured Joannes, cut his hand off, abused him in public, and killed him with most of his senior officials. Aetius returned, three days after Joannes' death, at the head of a substantial Hunnic army which made him the most powerful general in Italy. After some fighting, Placidia and Aetius came to an agreement; the Huns were paid off and sent home, while Aetius received the position of magister militum.|$|E

[...] Lucas Foster during production of the film stated in an interview: [...] "The ideas got so large, that they really couldn't fit into, you know, one or two movies, they needed to evolve over at least three movies. So we planned the story out over three movies and then we sliced it up in such a way as to leave room for the other two movies." ...|$|E
500|$|Under Walsh's management, Diageo has <b>been</b> <b>careful</b> to [...] "manage for value", and {{to avoid}} overpaying for assets. According to Nick Goodway of The Independent, Walsh [...] "has been canny in {{allowing}} others to bid for the really big rivals and then pick up the brands that fall out of those deals cheaply". Walsh has been criticised for his decision to exit the Indian spirits market in 2002 by disposing of Gilbey's Green Label, a strategy which he reversed in 2012 with the acquisition of a stake in United Spirits. David Wighton commented in The Times that Diageo's acquisition of United Spirits had seen the company's owner, Vijay Mallya, [...] "utterly outmanoeuvred by a canny rival prepared to play the long game." ...|$|E

However, his infatuation for his new lover [...] "had become both blatant and limitless", while his wife endured slights and became the object of gossip. PedroI was increasingly rude and mean toward Maria Leopoldina, left her short of funds, prohibited her from leaving the palace and forced her to endure Domitila's presence as her lady-in-waiting. In the meantime, his lover took advantage by advancing her interests, {{as well as those of}} her family and friends. Those seeking favors or to promote projects increasingly sought her help, bypassing the normal, legal channels.|$|E

500|$|Grant had <b>been</b> <b>careful</b> {{to watch}} the {{elections}} and secretly sent Phil Sheridan in to keep {{law and order in}} the state. Sheridan had arrived in New Orleans {{a few days before the}} January 4, 1875 legislature opening meeting. At the convention the Democrats again with military force took control of the state building out of Republican hands. Initially, the Democrats were protected by federal troops under Colonel R√©gis de Trobriand, and the escaped Republicans were removed from the hallways of the state building. However, Governor Kellogg then requested that Trobriand reseat the Republicans. [...] Trobriand returned to the State house and used bayonets to force the Democrats out of the building. The Republicans then organized their own house with their own speakers all being protected by the Federal Army. [...] Sheridan, who had annexed the Department of the Gulf to his command at 9:00 P.M., claimed that the federal troops were being neutral since they had also protected the Democrats earlier.|$|E
500|$|On August 3, 2013, Frank {{expressed}} {{sympathy with}} the host's atheism on the television program Real Time with Bill Maher. [...] In his biography, however, Frank states unequivocally {{that he is not}} an atheist and is uncomfortable expressing firm views on questions for which he is unable to provide an answer. Frank's agnosticism led him to resolve (if he had been appointed as interim Senator) to take the oath of office on the United States Constitution, rather than the Bible. For most of his life and entire Congressional career, Frank was known as a Jew. Frank continues to identify strongly with the Jewish community and has <b>been</b> <b>careful</b> throughout his career that his agnosticism not reflect negatively on other Jews. For example, when he stopped going to temple services on the High Holy Days he was careful to remain at home and {{out of the public eye}} in order that other Jews would not be criticized using his example.|$|E
500|$|Voeckler entered Paris‚ÄìNice optimistic for results, {{but with}} the {{realization}} that the stage 6 individual time trial would limit any chances he had on the overall crown. After finishing in the peloton for the first three stages, Voeckler figured into a winning breakaway in stage 4. He and recently ousted race leader Thomas De Gendt, with two others, broke away just [...] into the stage and stayed away by a margin of 13 seconds over the peloton at the finish. Voeckler won the four-man sprint at the end and took the stage win, as De Gendt had spent all his energies drilling the group to the line {{in order to get the}} time gap he needed to retake the race leadership. It was Voeckler's first career Paris‚ÄìNice stage win, after having competed in the race since 2003. Voeckler lost two minutes in the mountains the next day and any chance at the overall, but he rebounded to win stage 8 from another breakaway. Again joining the morning escape, Voeckler was one of relatively few riders who chose to complete the race by riding a slippery descent of the Col d'Eze, and stayed out front by 23 seconds over 's Diego Ulissi and one minute, 22 seconds over the peloton. He finished the race in 21st place overall. He added a sixth win on the season at the Giro del Trentino. Breaking away with Michele Scarponi on the climb to Ledro Bezzecca which closed out stage two, Voeckler defeated the Italian in the sprint 25 seconds ahead of the peloton. Upon seeing Scarponi make the juncture to him, he had <b>been</b> <b>careful</b> not to expend too much effort and leave himself fresh for the eventual sprint. Voeckler added further success at the Four Days of Dunkirk. While German sprinter Marcel Kittel won four of the race's five stages, Voeckler took the one that mattered as far as the overall classification was concerned. He put in a winning attack [...] from the end of the hilly fourth stage, as the chase group he had been in caught the day's morning breakaway. He finished safely in the peloton in the final stage the next day, comfortably maintaining his minute-plus lead to win the race overall.|$|E
