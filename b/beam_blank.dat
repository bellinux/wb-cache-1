Moreover, heat transfer simulation software was designed and developed by a 2 D mathematical Model based on FLUENT. The secondary development language UDF (User Define Function) and Scheme (a dialect of LISP) of FLUENT were used during the development.

Beam currents and accelerating voltages of 0.01 nA and 40 keV energy were typically used. The desired nanostructures were milled by rastering the ion beam and employing a <b>beam</b> <b>blanker.</b> The <b>beam</b> <b>blanker</b> shuts on and off according to a 8 -bit grayscale, 512 by 512 pixel image file. Tapered optical fiber tips with nanoapertures were fabricated by employing FIB milling at magnifications varying between 3000 × and 18000 × depending on the desired minimum aperture size. To form metallic nanostructures on the tips of optical fibers, a special fiber holder that could fit in the FIB stage was fabricated.|$|R

Relative to the time required for a forward scan, it then changes back relatively quickly to what's required to position the beam beyond the left edge of the visible (unblanked) area. This process occurs with all <b>beams</b> <b>blanked,</b> and is called the retrace. At the left edge, the field steadily decreases in magnitude to start another forward scan, and soon after the start, the beams unblank to start a new visible scan line.|$|R
40|$|A new <b>beam</b> <b>blanking</b> {{system was}} {{installed}} at the Lund Nuclear Microprobe and employed in proton beam lithography (PBL) for polymer microstructures fabrication. The blanker consists of two parallel plates connected to a high voltage generator. Measurement of the <b>beam</b> <b>blanking</b> time on a sample was performed {{by means of the}} standard PIXE system. The <b>beam</b> is <b>blanked</b> and returns to a sample within 200 ns. The blanking system is designed for the new sub-micrometer beamline under installation in the accelerator laboratory. A number of pilot MeV ion beam lithography experiments were performed to illustrate the possibility to use the blanking system in combination with the existing data acquisition and scanning system. A 2. 5 MeV proton beam was used to irradiate 50 mum SU- 8 negative resist. The blanker was shown to be a necessary part of the lithography system. It enables blanking between each pixel and hence fabrication of various patterns down to a single pixel. The blanker has significantly simplified beam control and enhanced process time and spatial resolution. Three-dimensional microstructures with 20 : 1 aspect ratio were fabricated...|$|R

Accurate cooling boundary conditions in the secondary cooling zone are involved, including spray water cooling, water evaporation cooling, radiation cooling and roll contact cooling in the casting direction and non-uniform distribution of spray water flow density in the cross-section. The causes of longitudinal crack at the fillet during Q 235 steel continuous casting were analysed {{on the basis of the}} simulation of the developed model, and then the spray water flow and the transverse nozzle layout were optimised.

40|$|The {{stability}} of the casting process and the wear of the mould {{as well as the}} quality of the product depend strongly on the mould design. This is particularly true when considering the production of beam blanks. If the mould is too tight, thermal contraction can generate considerable contact forces between the product and the mould on the inner surfaces of the flanges. If it is not tight enough, the thermal coupling between the mould and the <b>beam</b> <b>blank</b> is not sufficient to allow the solidification of a skin of the required thickness upon exit from the mould. A finite element model was developed to assist in the mould design. This model takes both the thermal and mechanical interaction between the mould and the product into account. The effect of solidification is implicitly included in the (thermal) finite element formulation while the ferro-static pressure is applied by the means of a specially developed element. The model was applied to a medium gage <b>beam</b> <b>blank</b> cast at ProfilARBED Differdange. The skin thickness as well as the localisation of the wear of the mould predicted by the model are in good agreement with observations made in industrial practice. ...|$|E

A fully three dimensional thermo-mechanically coupled FEM-simulation of an eleven pass hot rough rolling process of H-beam has been performed. Microstructure evolution equations available in literatures were incorporated into the commercial FE solver ABAQUS/Explicit, through user defined subroutine VUMAT, to simulate the microstructure evolution.

40|$|The flow {{transport}} of a 420 × 320 × 90 mm <b>beam</b> <b>blank</b> continuous casting mold that used open-stream pouring combined with submerged refractory funnels was studied. By considering the dynamic similarity, geometric similarity, and air entrapment quantity similarity, a full-size water model was established. Meanwhile, the 3 D mathematical models that included three phases were applied. Through {{the combination of}} the water model and the mathematical model, the distribution and morphology of the phases in the mold were investigated. The results indicate that bubbles existed in the molten steel due to entrapment and the flow pattern was {{different from that of the}} full protection-poured mold. Furthermore, the effects of funnel immersion depth and funnel diameter on the bubbles’ impact depth, funnel’s inside wall shear stress, and overall area of the air/steel interface were discussed. The results provide useful information for the industrial continuous casting process...|$|E
40|$|A {{numerical}} modelling {{study has been}} undertaken to analyze transport phenomena in various steel casters. During {{the course of this}} work, a general three-dimensional parabolic heat flow model was developed for casters of arbitrarily shaped mould using a body-fitted coordinate transformation technique. The heat flow model was specifically applied to a <b>beam</b> <b>blank</b> caster as well as to an industrial slab caster of regular rectangular cross section, so as to analyze solidification within casters. Furthermore, a fully coupled turbulent flow and solidification model was developed to describe the turbulent transport processes in the upper part of a steel slab caster as well as to evaluate the process variables affecting the casting. Solidification modelling was carried out using a fixed grid enthalpy method while the mushy zone was modelled based on a Darcy-porosity approach. A modified low-Reynolds number version of the $ kappa$-$ epsilon$ model of turbulence was employed to calculate eddy viscosity within the liquid and mushy regions. A control volume based on finite difference method was used to solve the transport equations, wherein a SIMPLER algorithm was adopted to resolve the velocity-pressure coupling in the momentum equations. In order to verify the turbulent flow model, a water modelling study was performed for fluid flow in the mould region of a slab caster. Reasonable agreement was obtained between the mathematical model's predictions, and water modelling experiments. Macrosegregation of carbon in a steel billet caster was also modelled based on a continuum formulation, in which the conservation equations are derived in terms of mixture dependent variables. The effect of turbulence on the transport of solute in the liquid and mushy regions was taken into account using the $ kappa$-$ epsilon$ model adopted in this work. Various parametric studies have been preformed on different casting systems, and their effects on temperature distributions and velocity fields within the strand, solidification profiles, and trajectories of inclusions were predicted. Typical predicted results of the models have been compared against the experimental measurements on operating casters reported in the literature and relatively good agreement was obtained...|$|E

This method of performing phosphorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (PLIM) represents an order of magnitude enhancement of the two-photon time-resolved emission imaging microscopy (TP-TREM) method, where in order to achieve a longer imaging window, the excitation laser repetition rate was reduced by cavity dumping [Chem. Sci., 2014, 5, 879]. The method complements and expands other existing imaging methodologies by enabling simultaneous PLIM and FLIM (fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy – recorded between <b>beam</b> <b>blanking),</b> whilst maintaining essential sub-micron spatial resolution. We demonstrate how the Pt(II) complex can be used to distinguish between cell nuclei and matrix proteins on the basis of emission lifetime, in both structured and homogeneous tissue sections; whilst also revealing how the Pt(II) emission lifetime varies with tissue matrix composition. The proposed imaging approach can be used in conjunction with any biocompatible emissive probe with a long emission lifetime – exemplified here by (1) – and for an array of fluorescent/phosphorescent labels, where discrimination is lifetime-based...|$|R

40|$|X-ray {{detection}} by energy-dispersive spectrometry in {{the analytical}} electron microscope (AEM) is often limited by low collected X-ray intensity (P), modest peak-to-background (P/B) ratios, and limitations on total counting time (tau) due to specimen drift and contamination. A new AFM {{has been designed}} with maximization of P. P/B, and tau as the primary considerations. Maximization of P has been accomplished by employing a field-emission electron gun, X-ray detectors with high collection angles, high-speed <b>beam</b> <b>blanking</b> to allow only one photon into the detector at a time, and simultaneous collection from two detectors. P/B has been maximized by reducing extraneous background signals generated at the specimen holder, the polepieces and the detector collimator. The maximum practical tau has been increased by reducing specimen contamination and employing electronic drift correction. Performance improvments have been measured using the NIST standard Cr thin film. The 0 - 3 steradian solid angle of X-ray collection is the highest value available. The <b>beam</b> <b>blanking</b> scheme for X-ray detection provides 3 - 4 times greater throughput of X-rays at high count rates into a recorded spectrum than normal systems employing pulse-pileup rejection circuits. Simultaneous X-ray collection from two detectors allows the highest X-ray intensity yet recorded to be collected from the NIST Cr thin film. The measured P/B of 6300 is the highest level recorded for an AEM. In addition to collected X-ray intensity (cps/nA) and P/B measured on the standard Cr film, the product of these {{can be used as}} a figure-of-merit to evaluate instruments. Estimated minimum mass fraction (MMF) for Cr measured on the standard NIST Cr thin film is also proposed as a figure-of-merit for comparing X-ray detection in AEMs. Determinations here of the MMF of Cr detectable show at least a threefold improvement over previous instruments...|$|R

50|$|A similar process occurs for the {{vertical}} scan, {{but at the}} display refresh rate (typically 50 to 75 Hz).

Once the last scan line is written, the vertical component of the magnetic field continues to increase by the equivalent of a few percent of the total height before the vertical retrace takes place. Vertical retrace is comparatively slow, occurring over a span of time required for several tens of horizontal scans. In analog CRT TVs, setting brightness to maximum typically made the vertical retrace visible as zigzag lines on the picture.|$|R

The microprojectile velocity was found to depend not only on the macroprojectile velocity but also on the microprojectile size and material, the bond strength with the macroprojectile and the gas flow that develops ahead of the macroprojectile. On average the microprojectile launch velocity was similar to the macroprojectile velocity. However, some tungsten particles had velocities twice this value.

40|$|We {{present a}} new method to create ultrashort {{electron}} pulses by integrating a photoconductive switch with an electrostatic deflector. This paper discusses {{the feasibility of}} such a system by analytical and numerical calculations. We argue that ultrafast electron pulses can be achieved for micrometer scale dimensions of the blanker, which are feasible with MEMS-based fabrication technology. According to basic models, the design {{presented in this paper}} is capable of generating 100 fs electron pulses with spatial resolutions of less than 10 nm. Our concept for an ultrafast <b>beam</b> <b>blanker</b> (UFB) may provide an attractive alternative to perform ultrafast electron microscopy, as it does not require modification of the microscope nor realignment between DC and pulsed mode of operation.

The use of a photoconductive switch ensures minimal jitter between laser and electron pulses. </p...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} work {{aimed at}} the development and application of a new lithography system for direct material patterning with the MeV proton beam at the Lund Nuclear Microprobe (NMP) facility. MeV proton beams are advantageous {{for use as a}} patterning tool due to their deep and well defined penetration through matter and their highly local energy deposition. This allows the fabrication of three dimensional microstructures with high aspect-ratio and density in various materials. This new and exciting application of nuclear microbeams is called Proton Beam Writing (PBW). In the work presented here, an MeV proton beam focused to micrometer size was used for high lateral resolution patterning. To achieve this, the existing beam and sample control and data-acquisition setups were complemented by use of nuclear electronics and a new <b>beam</b> <b>blanker,</b> resulting in a lithography system. The beam irradiation time and the position control were improved after the installation of a fast electrostatic <b>beam</b> <b>blanker</b> at the micro beamline. High-accuracy beam current measurement became possible when a new on-line pA-range measurement setup was added to the sub-micro beamline. Proton beam writing, using the new lithography system, was successfully performed and various complex microstructures in SU- 8 negative resist and porous silicon were produced. The exposure process was optimised to achieve the minimum structure size and structures with the highest aspect and density ratios for a given beam size and resist thickness. The smallest microstructures 1. 5 ?m in diameter, the highest density and aspect ratio of 4 : 1 and 20 : 1, respectively, in 4 - 95 ?m thick SU- 8 resist were fabricated. An inversed anodisation at low fluence in porous silicon was demonstrated. It was shown that, with large exposure latitude PBW is a simple and easily controlled fabrication method. Two new applications of the PBW technique were realised. Structures with high aspect ratio and high density were used for the fabrication of thin opaque phosphor micro-grids in metal. The micro-grids represented an order of magnitude improvement for single ion detection resolution in Ion Photon Emission Microscopy (IPEM). The other application utilises MeV proton beam patterned porous p-type silicon that serves as an anchor plate for sample deposition intended for Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Mass Spectrometry (MALDI MS).

40|$|Herein, we {{describe}} three advanced techniques for cathodoluminescence (CL) spectroscopy that {{have recently been}} developed in our laboratories. The first is a new method to accurately determine the CL-efficiency of thin layers of phosphor powders. When a wide band phosphor with a band gap (Eg > 5 eV) is bombarded with electrons, charging of the phosphor particles will occur, which eventually leads to erroneous results in {{the determination of the}} luminous efficacy. To overcome this problem of charging, a comparison method has been developed, which enables accurate measurement of the current density of the electron beam. The study of CL from phosphor specimens in a scanning electron microscope (SEM) is the second subject to be treated. A detailed description of a measuring method to determine the overall decay time of single phosphor crystals in a SEM without <b>beam</b> <b>blanking</b> is presented.

40|$|Surface and {{internal}} quality of continuous casts depends {{very much on}} the behaviour of the strand in the mould. Among the parameters likely to influence this behaviour, the mould taper takes a prominen tpart. In order to understand better the influence of this parameter, we build up a thermal-mechanical finite element model. A slice of the strand is modelled and its evolution is observed. The main results are temperature field and solidification evolution, stree, strain and strain rate fields and losses of contact and returns to contact analysis. The model includes an elastic-viscous-plastic law, to describe the behaviour of steel from liquid to solid state, a thermal-mechanical element that takes into account thermal expansion and mechanical behaviour of the strand, a unilateral contact element, z mobile rigid boundary element to model the mould and its taper and an adapted loading element to model the ferrostatic pressure according to the liquid or solid state.

The issue in question is the extent of the role played by acoustics directly on the imaging. In the present work, SEAM studies of a prepared test standard are presented which show that macroscopic elastic properties can play an important role in imaging. The SEAM technique uses Coordinate Modulation (CM) of the electron beam [2] rather than the more commonly used intensity modulation via <b>beam</b> <b>blanking.</b> Defects as deep as 26 thermal diffusion lengths in stainless steel have been clearly imaged with this technique. This work strongly supports the Jackson -Amer thermal bending model [3] for low frequency (up to approximately 100 kHz in small specimens) acoustic detection in the solid as compared to the theory of Opsal and Rosencwaig [4] which does not incorporate total specimen response to the thermal source.

Present work introduces the setup and the measurement chamber that was developed, constructed and assembled in IFJ PAN. The passage of single ions from vacuum to atmosphere (where the cell dish is located) is registered using the channeltron detector installed inside the chamber. Channeltron registers secondary electrons emitted from CsI layer covering the Si 3 N 4 exit window.
