The Br.121 was proposed with Turbomeca's Tourmalet engine for ECAT but Breguet preferred the RR RB.172 and their joint venture would use elements of both.

5|$|Corals are {{collected}} for the aquarium trade, {{and this may}} be done with little care for the long-term survival of the reef. Fishing among reefs is difficult and trawling does much mechanical damage. In {{some parts of the world}} explosives are used to dislodge fish from reefs, and cyanide may <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> same purpose; both practices not only kill reef inhabitants indiscriminately but also kill or damage the corals, sometimes stressing them so much that they expel their zooxanthellae and become bleached.|$|E
5|$|From 1932 to 1992, Birkebeinerrittet, a mass ski {{marathon}} between Rena and Lillehammer, {{has used}} Stampesletta as a start or goal area, depending on if the race ran from Lillehammer to Rena {{or in the}} opposite direction. Since 1992, the goal area was moved to Birkebeineren Ski Stadium. Birkebeinerrittet, a cycle version of the ski marathon, has its goal area at Stampesletta. The half-marathon terrain race Birkebeinerløpet uses Stampesletta as its start and goal area. During the 1994 Winter Olympics, Stampesletta was used for medal ceremonies for all non-skating events. The backdrops for the podium was built using ice and snow, with the podium itself being made from ice from the glacier Jostedalsbreen. This contrasted with the surrounding pine elements. Attendance was free, and between 25,000 and 30,000 people attended the medal ceremonies. Lillehammer is scheduled to host the 2016 Winter Youth Olympics. The Stampesletta area will <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> opening and closing ceremonies with a spectator capacity of 6,000 to 8,000; existing and new buildings nearby will <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Olympic Village.|$|E

5|$|From the {{beginning}} of the planning, things went awry for the Confederates. While Pickett's division had not been used yet at Gettysburg, A.P.

Some of Hill's corps had fought lightly on July 1 and not at all on July 2. However, troops that had done heavy fighting on July 1 ended up making the charge.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the actual formation, a phantom 76th Infantry Division was formed for deception.

5|$|The {{arrest of}} Zabiuddin Ansari alias Abu Hamza in June 2012 {{provided}} further clarity {{on how the}} plot was hatched. According to Abu Hamza, the attacks were previously scheduled for 2006, using Indian youth for the job. However, a huge cache of AK-47's and RDX, which were to <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> attacks, was recovered from Aurangabad in 2006, thus leading to {{the dismantling of the}} original plot. Subsequently, Abu Hamza fled to Pakistan and along with Lashkar commanders, scouted for Pakistani youth to <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> attacks. In September 2007, 10 people were selected for the mission. In September 2008, these people tried sailing to Mumbai from Karachi, but couldn't complete their mission due to choppy waters. These men made a second attempt in November 2008, and successfully managed to execute the final attacks. David Headley's disclosures, that three Pakistani army officers were associated with the planning and execution of the attack were substantiated by Ansari's revelations during his interrogation.|$|E
5|$|The {{portable}} electric {{fire engine}} would be efficient and practical only if {{a supply of}} electricity was available in a city for this purpose.

30|$|In {{the first}} experiment, Exp. 1, native Arabic {{speakers}} {{are involved in}} both the training and the testing. The WestPoint corpus is divided {{in such a way}} that 61 % of <b>the</b> corpus <b>is</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> training and 39 % <b>for</b> <b>the</b> test regardless of either gender or scripts. In the second experiment, Exp. 2, native speakers <b>are</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> training and only nonnative speakers are involved in the test phase. Then, the training uses 85 % of the corpus (native speakers), while 15 % of the corpus composed of nonnative speakers <b>is</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> test. In Exp. 3, all nonnative Arabic speakers <b>were</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> training and all Arabic native speakers <b>for</b> <b>the</b> test. In the fourth experiment, Exp. 4, only nonnative Arabic speakers <b>were</b> <b>used</b> in both training and testing systems. The nonnative speakers' part of the corpus is divided to obtain 67 % <b>for</b> <b>the</b> training, and 33 % <b>for</b> <b>the</b> test. In the fifth experiment, Exp. 5, both native and nonnative Arabic utterances are pooled to constitute the training data (69 % of the corpus) and testing data (31 % of the corpus). Experiments Exp. 6 to Exp. 9 are set up by varying the gender of the speakers in training and testing data. In Exp. 6, native male speakers <b>are</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> training and only nonnative male speakers are involved in the test. Thus the training uses 82 % of the corpus (male speakers only), while 18 % of the corpus composed of nonnative speakers <b>is</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> test. In Exp. 7, native female speakers <b>are</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> training and only nonnative female speakers are involved in the test. Hence the training uses 90 % of the corpus (female speakers only), while 10 % of the corpus composed of nonnative speakers <b>is</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> test. In Exp. 8, nonnative male speakers <b>are</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> training and only native male speakers are involved in the test. In this case, the training uses 18 % of the corpus (male speakers), while 82 % of the corpus composed of native male speakers <b>is</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> test. Finally, in Exp. 9, nonnative female speakers <b>are</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> training and only native female speakers are involved in the test. Thus the training uses 10 % of the corpus (female speakers), while 90 % of the corpus composed of nonnative speakers <b>is</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> test. The bigram language model was always derived from the total of prompts provided by WestPoint. This means that we use the same language model for all experiments.|$|R
