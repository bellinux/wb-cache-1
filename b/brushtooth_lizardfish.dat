50|$|Saurida undosquamis {{also known}} as the <b>Brushtooth</b> <b>lizardfish</b> or Large-scale grinner is a type of lizardfish, a {{demersal}} species that occurs in the Eastern Indian Ocean, Malay Peninsula, northern Java, Arafura Sea, Louisiade Archipelago, southern Philippines and northern Australia,. Reports of its occurrence in the Red Sea region and introduction to the Mediterranean are questionable,.|$|E
50|$|The 2004 marine {{production}} in Thailand was composed of: pelagic fish 33 percent, demersal fish 18 percent, cephalopod 7.5 percent, crustaceans 4.5 percent, trash fish 30 percent and others 7 percent. Trash fish refers to non-edible species, edible species of low commercial value and juveniles, which are {{released to the}} sea. Pelagic fishes were distributed between anchovies (Stolephorus spp., 19 percent), Indo-Pacific mackerel (Rastrelliger brachysoma, 18 percent), sardinellas (Sardinellars spp., 14 percent), scad (11 percent), longtail tuna (Thunnus tonggol, 9 percent), eastern little tuna (Euthynnus affinis, 6 percent), trevallies (6 percent), bigeye scad (5 percent), Indian mackerel (Rastrelliger kanagurta, 4 percent), king mackerel (Scomberomorus cavalla, 3 percent), torpedo scad (Megalaspis cordyla , 2 percent), wolf herrings (1 percent), and others (2 percent). Demersal fish production was dominated by purple-spotted bigeye (Priacanthus tayenus), threadfin bream (Nemipterus hexodon), <b>brushtooth</b> <b>lizardfish</b> (Saurida undosquamis), slender lizardfish (Saurida elongata) and Jinga shrimp (Metapenaeus affinis). Most species are overfished since the 1970s-1990s, except for Spanish mackerel (Scomberomorus commersoni), carangidae and torpedo scad (Meggalaspis spp.). The overall overfishing rate was 333 percent for pelagic and 245 percent for demersal species in 1991. Cephalopods are divided into squid, cuttlefish and molluscs, where squid and cuttlefish in Thai waters consists of 10 families, 17 genera and over 30 species. The main mollusk species captured in the Andaman Sea are scallop, blood cockle (Anadara granosa) and short-necked clam. Their collection requires bottom dredge gears, which damage the sea floor and the gears themselves and are becoming unpopular. So, the mollusk production has decreased from 27,374 tonnes in 1999 to 318 tonnes in 2004. While crustaceans composed only 4.5 {{percent of the total}} marine products in 2004 by volume, they accounted for 21 percent of the total value. They were dominated by banana prawn, tiger prawn, king prawn, school prawn, bay lobster (Thenus orientalis), mantis shrimp, swimming crabs and mud crabs. The total catch in 2004 was 51,607 tonnes for squid and cuttlefish and 36,071 tonnes for crustaceans.|$|E
40|$|The {{specimens}} for {{the present}} study were collected from the commercial trawlers operated from the Neendakara landing centre, Kollam, Kerala during January to December 2004. Specimens of were placed in an insulated box with ice and brought to the laboratory for biological analysis. During the study, a total of 492 fish specimens of different length groups were examined to study the feeding biology of The data on sex, stages of maturity in females and feeding conditions were collected from fresh specimens. The feeding intensity was assessed by visual estimation based on the distension of the gut and the quantity of food contained in it. The various stomach conditions were based on degree of fullness are expressed as grossed, full, full, full, full, trace and empty as suggested by Pillay 1952). In order to both qualitative and quantitative estimations were taken together, Index of Preponderance was employed for the quantification of the food items (Natarajan and Jhingran, 1961). The diversity of prey items was calculated using PRIMER v 6. For determining the size at first maturity, females in stages of III-V of maturation were used by grouping them into 10 mm length groups and their frequencies scaled to percentage. Size at first sexual S. undosquamis S. undosquamis. Lizard fishes belonging to the family Synodontidae contribute their mite to the demersal fishery resource of India. They range in size from 25 () to 67 cm (). They feed chiefly on teleost fishes, cephalopods and crustaceans. Among the four species of lizard fishes belonging to the genus occurring in the Indian waters (Jaiswer et al., 2002),, the <b>brushtooth</b> <b>lizardfish</b> is the second dominant one. The maximum body size is 36 cm (Nandha, 1980). It is found to inhabit muddy bottoms of the continental shelf down to about 100 m deep(FAO, 1974). This species is exploited by a variety of gears, however the majority comes from the bottom trawls (FAO...|$|E
