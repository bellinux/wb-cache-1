Due to the extensive use of cars at the time, hamburgers were often served at drive-ins, often by waiters known as carhops. Drive-in restaurants first appeared in the United States in the early 1930s, and gradually become a common sight across the country. The ability to serve hamburgers to customers in their cars was seen as a <b>business</b> <b>opportunity</b> by countless fast-food chains, especially McDonald's.

25|$|While {{building}} the North Midland Railway from Derby to Rotherham and Leeds, Stephenson had found rich coal seams in the Clay Cross area {{and he saw}} a new <b>business</b> <b>opportunity.</b> Crich was already well known {{for the quality of}} the limestone and Stephenson recognised that he could use the local coal and limestone to produce burnt lime for agricultural purposes, and then utilise the new railway to distribute it. Cliff Quarry, where Crich Tramway Village is now located, was acquired by Stephenson's company and to link the quarry with the limekilns he had built alongside the new North Midland Railway at Ambergate, Stephenson constructed a metre gauge line - apparently the first metre gauge railway in the world. Stephenson was born in Wylam in Northumberland in 1781, but he lived the last 10 years of his life in Chesterfield, often bringing visitors to Crich to see the mineral railway and take refreshment in one of the village inns. He died in 1848 and is buried in Holy Trinity Church, Chesterfield. Stephenson's railway soldiered on for many years.|$|E

40|$|The {{fundamentals}} of <b>business</b> <b>opportunities</b> identification {{are directly related}} to the entire process of entrepreneurship development for national economic transformation. There is abundance of <b>business</b> <b>opportunities</b> in the different sectors of the national economy yearning for exploitation. The {{purpose of the study was}} to identify these various sectors and determine the extent to which the identified <b>business</b> <b>opportunities</b> promote entrepreneurship development for national transformation. Two research questions guided the study. The population was 45 lecturers of the School of Business Education from nine Colleges of Education in the South East of Nigeria. A structured questionnaire with a five-point Likert Scale was used as the instrument for data collection. The instrument contained 28 items and mean was used in the analysis of the data. The findings showed that <b>business</b> <b>opportunities</b> exist in different sectors of the national economy and that these opportunities promote entrepreneurship culture and development, job creation, self-employment, self-reliance, economic transformation, creativity and innovation. They also provide the push, pull and drive for hard work that ensure success and the acquisition of employable skills for the unemployed, unemployable and the underemployed, thus leading to national transformation. Conclusions were drawn based on these findings. It was recommended that entrepreneurship curriculum in tertiary institutions should include how to identify the {{fundamentals of}} <b>business</b> <b>opportunities</b> and ways and means of identifying <b>business</b> <b>opportunities</b> in one’s environment...|$|R
