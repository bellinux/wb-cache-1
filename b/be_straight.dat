5|$|Several {{types of}} incense clock have been found, {{the most common}} forms include the incense stick and incense seal. An incense stick clock was an incense stick with calibrations; most were elaborate, {{sometimes}} having threads, with weights attached, at even intervals. The weights would drop onto a platter or gong below, signifying that {{a certain amount of}} time had elapsed. Some incense clocks were held in elegant trays; open-bottomed trays were also used, to allow the weights to be used together with the decorative tray. Sticks of incense with different scents were also used, so that the hours were marked by a change in fragrance. The incense sticks could <b>be</b> <b>straight</b> or spiraled; the spiraled ones were longer, and were therefore intended for long periods of use, and often hung from the roofs of homes and temples.|$|E
5|$|Theophrastus {{describes}} {{the wood of}} different trees, the effects of climate on wood, of knots and 'coiling' in timber and other differences in quality. He discusses which woods to use for specific purposes such as for carpentry, shipbuilding and for building houses, {{and the making of}} charcoal. The most useful trees are said to be silver-fir and fir, and they have the best wood in the largest sizes; the silver-fir is softer than the fir, and its wood has layers like an onion, and is made entirely of these layers. The strongest and most attractive wood is smooth, without knots. In Syria, terebinth wood is dark and close-grained, Theophrastus reports, and used both for the handles of daggers and, turned on the lathe, for making cups. He claims that the hardest timber is of oak and holm oak, while elm warps the least, so it is used for the pivots and sockets of doors, which must <b>be</b> <b>straight.</b> The wood of palms is light and soft like cork-oak, but is tougher and less brittle, so it is good for carving images. Timber from the cedar, ebony, box, olive, oak and sweet chestnut keeps well and resists decay. He asserts that Tamarisk wood from Greece is weak, but from the Arabian island of Tylos it is as strong as kermes-oak. The wood of oak and the knotted parts of fir and silver-fir are described as the hardest to work. Ships are generally made of silver-fir, fir, and Syrian cedar; in Cyprus they use Aleppo pine which is better than the fir that grows there. Theophrastus records that in the lowlands of Italy (the country of the Latins) they grow bay, myrtle and excellent beech trees long enough for the whole length of a ship.|$|E

40|$|A metric space X <b>is</b> called <b>straight</b> if any {{continuous}} real-valued function {{which is}} uniformly continuous on {{each set of}} a finite cover of X by closed sets, is itself uniformly continuous. Let C be the convergent sequence { 1 /n : n ϵ N} with its limit 0 in the real line with the usual metric. In this paper, we show that for a straight space X, X × C <b>is</b> <b>straight</b> {{if and only if}} X × K <b>is</b> <b>straight</b> for any compact metric space K. Furthermore, we show that for a straight space X, if X × C <b>is</b> <b>straight,</b> then X <b>is</b> precompact. Note that the notion of straightness depends on the metric on X.

25|$|Paths - Pathways {{should never}} <b>be</b> <b>straight.</b> They should meander like a stream. This helps deepen the {{landscape}} by adding layers.

The concept is to never create inorganic patterns, but instead to mimic the patterns that nature creates.|$|E
25|$|The outer part of {{the double}} coat should <b>be</b> <b>straight</b> and wiry in texture, never soft, silky, curly, wavy, or woolly as might be {{expected}} in the Kerry Blue Terrier. The coat should lie flat against the skin, and, though having some length, should never be so long as to hide the true shape of the dog. There are longer hairs on the legs, but never so much as a Wire Fox Terrier or Schnauzer. That means {{you have to have the}} coat trimmed often which can be expensive.|$|E

25|$|The coat is medium {{length and}} can <b>be</b> <b>straight,</b> wavy, or curly. There is {{frequently}} feathering on {{the legs and}} tail, {{as well as on}} the ear. As a working dog, the coat should be easy to keep, requiring very little grooming. Dirt tends to just fall away. English shepherds tend to shed quite a lot and fur may be found on and under furniture, clothes, and carpeting. The primary coat colors are: sable and white (clear and shaded), tricolor, black and white, and black and tan. Other variations such as solid dogs of any color, piebalds, and red nosed tricolors and sables also exist but are not common.|$|E
25|$|The {{traditional}} gait of a Rottweiler is a trot. Therefore, the Rottweiler is a trotter. Trotting in this breed is by {{no means}} a fault and is required. This movement comes naturally to the Rottweiler and should appear as such; any deviation may lead to a disqualification in the show ring. While walking, the Rottweiler's legs, both front and hind, should move in a straight forward and backward manner. As with the straight movement of the legs, the path the Rottweiler moves in should also <b>be</b> <b>straight.</b> The Rottweiler's gait is all about balance and effectiveness as the breed is still used as a herder today.|$|E
25|$|Only male dik-diks sport horns, {{which are}} {{approximately}} 3 inches long, corrugated, and backward-slanted. Horns of male Kirk's dik-dik may <b>be</b> <b>straight</b> or curved backwards from {{the profile of}} the face and the basal half of the horns have seven to nine annular ridges, that are frequently covered by the crest. Kirk's dik-dik are sexually dimorphic: females are larger and lack horns, while males sport a more developed muzzle, a longer crest, and tend to be lighter in color. Though physically very similar the Kirk's dik-dik can be distinguished from Guenthers’ dik-dik due to its longer nasals and premaxillae and shorter proboscis, which gives the head a more wedged-shaped profile than that of Guenther's dik-dik.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to its use as an herbicide, glyphosate is also used for crop desiccation (siccation) to increase harvest yield, {{and as a result}} of desiccation, to increase sucrose concentration in sugarcane before harvest. The application of glyphosate just before harvest on grains (like wheat, barley, and oats) kills the food crop so that it dries more quickly and evenly, similar to the use of dessicants. This dry crop does not have to be windrowed (swathed and dried) prior to harvest but can easily <b>be</b> <b>straight</b> cut and harvested. This saves the farmer time and money,which is important in northern regions where the growing season is short. Excess residue levels in beans resulting from incorrect application can render the crop unfit for sale.|$|E
25|$|Rim brakes require regular maintenance. Brake pads {{wear down}} {{and have to be}} replaced. And before they wear out completely, their {{position}} may need to be adjusted as they wear. Because the motion of most brakes is not perfectly horizontal, the pads may lose their centering as they wear, causing the pads to wear unevenly. Over longer time and use, rims become worn. Rims should be checked for wear periodically as they can fail catastrophically if the braking surface becomes too worn. Wear is accelerated by wet and muddy conditions. Rim brakes require that the rims <b>be</b> <b>straight</b> (not out-of-round or warped). If a rim has a pronounced wobble, then the braking force may be intermittent or uneven, and the pads may rub the rims even when the brake is not applied.|$|E
25|$|By {{looking at}} a {{cylindrical}} rod can one tell whether it is twisted? If the rod is perfectly cylindrical, then the circular symmetry of the cross section {{makes it impossible to}} tell {{whether or not it is}} twisted. However, if there were a straight line drawn along the length of the rod, then one could easily say whether or not there is a twist by looking at the state of the line. Drawing a line is gauge fixing. Drawing the line spoils the gauge symmetry, i.e., the circular symmetry U(1) of the cross section at each point of the rod. The line is the equivalent of a gauge function; it need not <b>be</b> <b>straight.</b> Almost any line is a valid gauge fixing, i.e., there is a large gauge freedom. To tell whether the rod is twisted, you need to first know the gauge. Physical quantities, such as the energy of the torsion, do not depend on the gauge, i.e., are gauge invariant.|$|E

25|$|Barbara shares news of her father's plan to Val; {{to cover}} the Goldmans' {{alternate}} lifestyle, she has told her parents that Armand is straight and cultural attaché to Greece. Armand dislikes the idea of deception, but agrees to play along, hiring contractors to redecorate the family's apartment to more closely resemble a traditional household. Albert initially wants to use his skills as a drag artist to play Val's mother, but Val and Armand fear that the trick will not work, and instead convince him to pose as Val's uncle. Armand contacts Katherine and explains the situation; she agrees to the farce, promising {{to come to the}} party and pretend to be his wife. Armand then tries to coach Albert on how to <b>be</b> <b>straight,</b> but Albert's flamboyant nature makes the task difficult. When Albert overhears Val and Armand discussing how he might ruin the whole charade, he takes offense and locks himself in his room.|$|E
25|$|Although {{playing with}} a suspect knee for his last few seasons at Richmond, Swift always gave his best; and, {{considering}} his knee problems, he had a surprising turn of speed. He ended his career at full-back, having played as a half-forward flanker and ruck-rover for his last few seasons, and only moving to full-back {{in the last half}} of his last season, in place of the injured Mick Erwin. Jack Dyer had suggested the move, {{on the basis of his}} own experience with a similar sort of knee injury, Dyer argued that, of all the positions on the field, full-back was the best for Swift, because he would have almost all of his play in front of him, and almost all of his running would <b>be</b> <b>straight</b> ahead, with a minimum of turns and sideways movement. In his first full match in 1967 at full-back, in round 16 (16 August 1967), against Hawthorn, at Glenferrie Oval, despite fears that he was too short to play against Hawthorn's champion full-forward, Peter Hudson, who was 3½ inches taller, Swift held Hudson to three goals, and Richmond won the match, thrashing Hawthorn 23.30 (168) to 7.12 (54).|$|E
25|$|Distinctive {{features}} include eyes {{that are very}} clear, of yellowish or amber hue, hindquarters as high or a trifle higher than the shoulders, and a double-coat that tends to wave on shoulders, neck, back, and loins. The waterproof coat feels slightly oily and {{is often associated with}} a slight musky odor. Three basic colors are generally seen in the breed: brown, which includes all shades from a light to a deep dark brown; sedge, which varies from a reddish yellow through a bright red to chestnut shades; and deadgrass in all its shades, varying from a faded tan to a dull straw color. The breed standard states that white may also appear but it must be limited to the breast, belly, toes, or back of the feet. The head is round and broad with a medium stop and muzzle. The lips are thin, and the ears are small and of medium leather. The forelegs should <b>be</b> <b>straight</b> with good bone. The hindquarters are especially strong and the toes webbed since excellent swimming ability is important for the Chesapeake. This breed is also known for its large and powerful chest, used to break apart ice when diving into cold water while duck hunting.|$|E

25|$|The northwest-trending {{component}} of the postulated global grid of fractures is markedly absent in the Borealis region. Northeast-trending scarps and troughs are conspicuous, however, across intercrater plains material and in crater fill (smooth plains material) between the 155° and 185° meridians, and from crater Van Dijck northward to crater Purcell and beyond. The scarps tend to <b>be</b> <b>straight</b> in intercrater plains material, but become notably lobate in crater fill (for example, within Saikaku). This set of northeast-trending scarps and troughs, and another set of north-trending scarps and troughs within and north of crater Van Dijck, probably follow zones of structural weakness in the mercurian crust. Ancient fractures that were reactivated by later impacts may have first provided the conduits for crater fill (smooth plains material) and later been propagated upward through the fill. That these ridges, scarps, and troughs are parts of a global grid of fractures cannot be stated conclusively because of their proximity to the terminator {{and the lack of}} photographic coverage beyond the 190° meridian. Some scarps probably were formed by normal faulting of the smooth plains material that covers some crater floors, as in the Kuiper quadrangle (Scott and others, 1980). We cannot, however, determine whether most lineaments are internal or are parts of a faulted and lineated facies associated with a nearby but unphotographed impact basin. Melosh (1977) predicted that normal east-trending faults would form in high Mercurian latitudes as a result of slight crustal shortening. His predicted faults may be represented by a generally east-northeast-trending scarp and a lineament that cut across intermediate plains material and the crater Jókai between the 125° and 155° meridians. The north pole is too close to the terminator to detect {{the presence or absence of}} a “polygonal arrangement without preferred orientation,” as predicted by Melosh and Dzurisin (1978, p. 233).|$|E
