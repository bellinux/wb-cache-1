40|$|Until {{recently}} inter-carrier {{sales and}} purchase of telecommunications transport capacities were mainly based on long-term bilateral contracts between capacity supplying and demanding operators.

Eleven electronic carrier capacity market places were identified around the globe and analyzed with regard to the volume and structure of carrier <b>capacity</b> <b>products</b> being traded. Results suggest that operators of electronic capacity markets face severe difficulties in motivating major carriers to participate in the market. Former transmission network monopoly holders are particularly reluctant to participate in electronic carrier capacity market places. Incumbents fear that their participation could accelerate the decline of transport capacity prices. On a more general level the analysis suggests that new intermediaries in electronic markets are likely to fail when (1) supply and demand is highly concentrated and (2) trust in the quality of the products traded and in the commercial settlement processes is not firmly established.

40|$|The hair cell's mechanoreceptive organelle, {{the hair}} bundle, is highly {{sensitive}} because its transduction channels open over {{a very narrow}} range of displacements. The synchronous gating of transduction channels also underlies the active hair-bundle motility that amplifies and tunes responsiveness. The {{extent to which the}} gating of independent transduction channels is coordinated depends on how tightly individual stereocilia are constrained to move as a unit. Using dual-beam interferometry in the bullfrog's sacculus, we found that thermal movements of stereocilia located as far apart as a bundle's opposite edges display high coherence and negligible phase lag. Because the mechanical degrees of freedom of stereocilia are strongly constrained, a force applied anywhere in the hair bundle deflects the structure as a unit. This feature assures the concerted gating of transduction channels that maximizes the sensitivity of mechanoelectrical transduction and enhances the hair <b>bundle's</b> <b>capacity</b> to amplify its inputs.

In this context, two strategies are compared: a product based assortment, in which products are included based on their expected individual contribution to the total net profit, and a customer based assortment, in which customers are included based on their expected contribution to the total net profit. Mathematical models are presented to calculate the net profit for each of the above two strategies for a manufacturer confronted with limited production capacity, setup times, setup cost, and holding cost. The results of a case study from practice show that an assortment made up of products selected based on their individual contribution may lead to a much lower expected total net profit than a customer based assortment.

40|$|Aurora kinases are key effectors of mitosis. Plant Auroras are {{functionally}} {{divided into}} two clades. The alpha Auroras (Aurora 1 and Aurora 2) associate with the spindle and the cell plate and are implicated in controlling formative divisions throughout plant development. The beta Aurora (Aurora 3) localizes to centromeres and likely functions in chromosome separation. In contrast to the wealth of data available {{on the role of}} Aurora in other kingdoms, knowledge on their function in plants is merely emerging. This is exemplified by the fact that only histone H 3 and the plant homolog of TPX 2 have been identified as Aurora substrates in plants. Here we provide biochemical, genetic, and cell biological evidence that the microtubule-bundling protein MAP 65 - 1 -a member of the MAP 65 /Ase 1 /PRC 1 protein family, implicated in central spindle formation and cytokinesis in animals, yeasts, and plants-is a genuine substrate of alpha Aurora kinases. MAP 65 - 1 interacts with Aurora 1 in vivo and is phosphorylated on two residues at its unfolded tail domain. Its overexpression and down-regulation antagonistically affect the alpha Aurora double mutant phenotypes. Phospho-mutant analysis shows that Aurora contributes to the microtubule <b>bundling</b> <b>capacity</b> of MAP 65 - 1 in concert with other mitotic kinases...|$|R

40|$|Integrated Gate Bipolar Transistors (IGBTs) {{generally}} {{have a high}} output power and generate significant amounts of heat, which needs {{to be removed from}} the chip to ensure continued operation. Since IGBT chips are commonly mounted on a layered assembly structure which is in turn mounted onto a heat sink assembly, the thermal dissipation properties of the layered structure are crucial in keeping temperatures within operational boundaries. Traditionally, the selection of materials for the layered structure has been largely influenced by the thermal conductivity for heat dissipation, the similarity of the coefficient of thermal expansion for physical integrity of the structure and to a lesser extent, the weight of the material. These principles of material selection are indeed adequate for steady state operation of IGBTs. However, IGBTs are often installed in applications where they are subjected to pulsed operation, which is predominantly transient. During transient operation, it was found that thermal conductivity was not necessarily the best criterion to use for material selection within the layered structure. In certain instances, materials that absorbed heat rather than conducting it yielded lower temperatures and higher cooling rates, which in turn resulted in lower start temperatures in the next pulse. This study therefore proposes an additional material selection criterion, one based on the density-specific heat <b>capacity</b> <b>product</b> that should be used in conjunction with thermal conductivity to guide the material selection process, opening the door to material combinations for specific applications that could enhance chip lifespan and reduce deliamination. Materials with high density-specific heat <b>capacity</b> <b>products</b> could also potentially be used to compensate for the thermal "bottlenecking" effect.
