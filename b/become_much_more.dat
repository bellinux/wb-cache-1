5|$|Decrease in the {{population}} of the addax has begun notably since the mid-1800s. More recently, addax were found from Algeria to Sudan, but due mainly to overhunting, they have <b>become</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> restricted and rare.|$|E
5|$|River otters {{are active}} year-round, and are most active {{at night and}} during crepuscular hours. They <b>become</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> nocturnal in the spring, summer, and fall seasons, and more diurnal during winter. They may migrate {{as a result of}} food {{shortages}} or environmental conditions, but they do not migrate annually. River otters only settle in areas that consist of vegetation, rock piles, and sufficient coverage.|$|E
5|$|Vampyr had {{a delayed}} release in Germany and opened to a {{generally}} negative reception from audiences and critics. Dreyer edited the film after its German premiere and it opened to more mixed opinions at its French debut. The film was long considered {{a low point}} in Dreyer's career, but modern critical reception to the film has <b>become</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> favorable with critics praising the film's disorienting visual effects and atmosphere.|$|E
50|$|The FALG <b>became</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> {{important}} in the 1990s as the PRC leadership <b>became</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> institutionalized and less focused on factional and informal politics. Since 1993 {{the leader of the}} group had also served as General Secretary of the Communist Party of China and President of the People's Republic of China.|$|R

50|$|By World War II, {{the use of}} {{the smaller}} divisions, platoons and {{companies}} <b>became</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> important as precise operations became vital. Instead of the locked trench warfare of World War I, during World War II, a dynamic network of battles developed where small groups encountered other platoons. As a result, elite squads <b>became</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> recognized and distinguishable.|$|R
5|$|In 1849 James Goodhue began {{publication}} of the Minnesota Pioneer newspaper in Saint Paul (the paper would later be renamed the St. Paul Pioneer Press). By the time the area achieved statehood 89 newspapers had been established. Information about Minnesota published in these periodicals spread throughout the United States and Europe. Advertising campaigns were launched in the northeastern U.S. and Europe to lure European settlers. These efforts met with limited success though they would <b>become</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> successful after statehood.|$|E
5|$|Like other {{rulers of}} the period, Henry donated to the Church and patronised various {{religious}} communities, but contemporary chroniclers did not consider him an unusually pious king. His personal beliefs and piety may, however, have developed {{during the course of}} his life. Henry had always taken an interest in religion, but in his later years he may have <b>become</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> concerned about spiritual affairs. If so, the major shifts in his thinking would appear to have occurred after 1120, when his son William Adelin died, and 1129, when his daughter's marriage teetered on the verge of collapse.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the debate}} in the 2008 {{legislative}} session centered on crafting a budget for the 2008–2010 biennium, a period when the state was projected to encounter a shortfall of nearly $1 billion. Beshear expressed surprise that the budget issues consumed so much of the Assembly's time during the session, but admitted that the legislature had <b>become</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> independent of the governor than it was when he was a legislator two decades earlier. He listed early childhood education and expanded health care for children among the priorities that he was unable to address in the session.|$|E

As stated earlier, her relationship with Commander Koenig <b>became</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> overt and demonstrative, with many public displays of affection in front of others. She also becomes close friends with Maya after the metamorph's arrival on Alpha.|$|R

5|$|The volcano's {{observed}} {{history has}} mostly {{been one of}} effusive eruptions; however, this is a relatively recent occurrence. Prior {{to the arrival of}} the first Europeans on the island, Kīlauea was the site of regular explosive activity, evidenced then by tribal chants referencing the volcano's fickle nature, and today by geological records of an explosively active mode of past activity. Although explosive activity still occurs at the volcano, it is not as intense as it once was, and the volcano would <b>become</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> dangerous to the general public if it returned to its old phase of activity once more.|$|E
5|$|Climate {{change and}} weather-related natural {{disasters}} also threaten lemur survival. For the last 1000 years, western and highland regions {{have been growing}} significantly drier, {{but in the past}} few decades, severe drought has <b>become</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> frequent. There are indications that deforestation and forest fragmentation are accelerating this gradual desiccation. The effects of drought are even felt in the rainforests. As annual rainfall decreases, the larger trees that make up the high canopy suffer increased mortality, failure to fruit, and decreased production of new leaves, which folivorous lemurs prefer. Cyclones can defoliate an area, knock down canopy trees, and create landslides and flooding. This can leave lemur populations without fruit or leaves until the following spring, requiring them to subsist on crisis foods, such as epiphytes.|$|E
5|$|In December 1996, former classmate Tuomas Holopainen invited Turunen to {{join his}} new {{acoustic}} mood music project, and she immediately agreed. At the recording session for the first demo Holopainen discovered that due to her classical singing lessons, Turunen's voice had <b>become</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> powerful than he recalled from their school days. At the following band practices, Emppu Vuorinen used an electric guitar instead of an acoustic guitar because he felt that it gave a better accompaniment to her voice. Holopainen later explained that the band members had gradually realised that Turunen's voice had become too dramatic for acoustic mood music and eventually {{came to the conclusion}} that the music had to be massive too. Hence Holopainen decided to form Nightwish as a metal band.|$|E

5|$|In late antiquity, {{historic}} accounts <b>become</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> diffuse, and the Iazyges generally {{cease to}} be mentioned as a tribe. In the late 4thcentury, two Sarmatian peoples were mentioned, the Argaragantes and the Limigantes, who lived {{on opposite sides of}} the Tisza river. One theory is that these two tribes were formed when the Iazyges were conquered by the Roxolani, with the Iazyges becoming the Limigantes, and the Roxolani becoming the Argaragantes. Another theory is that a group of Slavic tribesmen gradually migrated into the area, subservient to the Iazyges, and the Iazyges became known as the Argaragantes, and the Slavs were the Limigantes. Regardless of which is true, in the 5th century both of them were conquered by the Goths, and, by the time of Attila, they were absorbed into the Huns.|$|E
5|$|The twelve-minute sketch {{was written}} by Michael O'Donoghue who {{wanted to create a}} scene that would {{showcase}} the acting talents of John Belushi. O'Donoghue had been the one who had initially persuaded producer Lorne Michaels to hire Belushi for the new Saturday Night Live program. O'Donoghue and Belushi recognized that the original Star Trek series itself was not a ratings success during its initial run, but had <b>become</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> successful during syndication. Belushi enjoyed the Star Trek series and wanted the part of Captain Kirk. He demonstrated his intense desire to get the role by trimming his sideburns to closely resemble Kirk's facial appearance in the original series. They worked together on the sketch for thirty-days and scheduled it for the final episode of the 1976 season of the show when it would be hosted by Elliott Gould.|$|E
5|$|Mimicry of mutualistic {{species is}} seen in coral reef fish, where the models, certain cleaner fish, are greatly {{disadvantaged}} {{by the presence of}} the mimic. Cleaner fish are the allies of many other species, which allow them to eat their parasites and dead skin in a mutually beneficial cleaning symbiosis. Some allow the cleaner to venture inside their mouths and gill cavities to hunt these parasites. However, one species of cleaner, the bluestreak cleaner wrasse (Labroides dimidiatus), is the unknowing model of a mimetic species, the sabre-toothed blenny (Aspidontus taeniatus). This wrasse, shown in the image cleaning a grouper of the genus Epinephelus, resides in coral reefs in the Indian and the Pacific Oceans, and is recognized by other fishes who then allow it to clean them. Its imposter, a species of blenny, lives in the Indian Ocean and not only looks like it in terms of size and coloration, but even mimics the cleaner's 'dance'. Having fooled its prey into letting its guard down, it then bites it, tearing off scales or a piece of fin before fleeing the scene. Fish grazed upon in this fashion soon learn to distinguish mimic from model, but because the similarity is close between the two they <b>become</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> cautious of the model as well, such that both are affected. Due to victims' ability to discriminate between foe and helper, the blennies have evolved close similarity, right down to the regional level.|$|E
