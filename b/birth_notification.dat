50|$|Chishō {{was born}} in 1896 in Nara Prefecture, but her <b>birth</b> <b>notification</b> was {{registered}} at Osaka city hall by her parents. Her father was an alcoholic {{who worked as a}} blacksmith. When Chishō was two years old, her mother, Oda Tsuru, died. However, there is another theory that Tsuru ran away from home. She was brought up lovingly by her grandmother, and when she was seven years old, she worked in her aunt's tea parlor as a waitress. At 12 years old, her father lied to her and sold her into slavery, sending her to Oume Tsujii, courtesan of Onoe Kikugorō V. At 14 years old, upon being given 250 yen employment preparation money, she became the adopted daughter of Kagaya (Kashi zashiki), and debuted with the stage name Chiyoha. Her unusual beauty helped her gain popularity, and her mizuage was bought by a chairperson of an Ōsaka stock exchange transaction.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{demonstrate}} {{the use of}} aggregated, locally collected <b>birth</b> <b>notification</b> data to examine trends in birth-weight specific survival for singleton and multiple births. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of 171, 527 notified births and subsequent infant survival data derived from computerised community child health records. Validation of data completeness and quality was undertaken by comparison with birth and death registration records for the same period. SETTING: Notifications of births in 1989 - 1991 to residents of the North Thames (East) Region (formerly North East Thames Regional Health Authority). OUTCOME MEASURES: Birthweight specific stillbirth, neonatal, and postneonatal death rates. RESULTS: There was close correspondence between the notification and registration data. For 96 % of the registered deaths a <b>birth</b> <b>notification</b> record was identified and {{for the majority of}} these the death was already known to the Community Child Health Computer. Completeness of birth-weight data, particularly {{at the lower end of}} the range, was substantially better in <b>birth</b> <b>notification</b> data. Comparison with the most recent published national data relating to birthweight specific survival of very low birthweight singleton and multiple births suggests that the downward trend of mortality is continuing, at least in this Region. CONCLUSIONS: The use of routinely collected aggregated <b>birth</b> <b>notification</b> data provides a valuable adjunct to existing sources of information about perinatal and infant survival, as well as other information regarding process and outcome of maternity services. Such data are required for comparative audit and may be more complete than that obtained from registration or hospital generated data...|$|E

40|$|There is a {{need for}} {{accurate}} ascertainment of incidence and prevalence rates of congenital anomalies. In British Columbia the Registry for Handicapped Children and Adults used in conjunction with vital records has proved a valuable source of information. <b>Birth</b> <b>notifications</b> alone cannot be relied upon for incidence data. It was found that seven times as many cases of congenital heart disease were registered subsequently as were reported at birth. The estimated minimal incidence rates of mongolism and congenital heart disease per 1000 live births were 1. 46 and 4. 75, respectively. The well-known association of maternal age with mongolism was confirmed. Twice as many babies with congenital heart disease (without mongolism) were born to mothers over 39 years of age as would be expected {{on the basis of the}} maternal age distribution for all live births in the population.

40|$|A {{random sample}} of 617 primiparas was {{identified}} from <b>birth</b> <b>notifications</b> over a 12 month period and 534 of these were interviewed four weeks after confinement. Those breast feeding {{at the time of}} interview were contacted again at four months and those still breast feeding then were contacted at six and a half months. Duration of breast feeding was found to be significantly associated with five interassociated personal characteristics of the mother and with specific aspects of her knowledge and attitudes regarding breast feeding. In hospital the timing of the first breast feed and difficulties with subsequent feeds, were important indicators; while at home the use of additional formula feeds was associated with a reduced prevalence of breast feeding by 18 weeks. A combination of older maternal age at confinement and older age at leaving school showed a tenfold increase of prevalence rates in breast feeding at 16 weeks between groups of mothers. The use of these two factors alone may thus help doctors, midwives, and health visitors in assessing the risk of premature termination of breast feeding and in planning programmes of preventive care...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To {{assess the}} {{contribution}} of children with different birth weights to special educational needs within a single health district, and to determine whether this pattern changed over {{the time when the}} survival of very low birthweight (VLBW) infants was increasing. SETTING [...] An inner London health district. STUDY DESIGN [...] A cohort of children born to local parents between January 1974 and December 1980 was selected from <b>birth</b> <b>notifications,</b> including only those infants who survived for more than one month. Community child health records were then inspected to identify children from the cohort who had been formally assessed for special educational needs before their 8 th birthday. The risk of special educational needs was compared for the years 1974 - 77 and 1977 - 80 (the first and second halves of the period studied). SUBJECTS [...] The infant cohort consisted of 31, 846 children. Altogether 260 (0. 8 %) of these were later assessed formally. RESULTS [...] VLBW infants were 4. 4 {{times more likely to be}} assessed than normal birthweight infants. Formal assessment within the district occurred in three of 68 VLBW infants from the first half of the period studied, and three of 120 from the second half. CONCLUSION [...] Although VLBW infants are at higher risk, an increase in their survival was not associated with any increase in their contribution to the group with special educational needs within our district. Their contribution, as a group, to the total number of children with special educational needs is very small...|$|R

40|$|With {{the decline}} in {{mortality}} from other causes, congenital malformations represent an increasingly important cause of stillbirth and infant death. Malformations are also an important cause of spontaneous abortion and this paper examines the high fetal and infant loss associated with these conditions, using data collected on all births in 1964 - 66 to women resident in South Wales. The birth population and the ascertainment methods used in the survey have been described elsewhere (Richards and Lowe, 1971). Information on maternal age, parity, previous abortions, and parental occupation relating to all births in the survey years was abstracted from <b>birth</b> <b>notification</b> forms on to coding cards for punching and analysis. The Registrar General of England and Wales supplied photocopies of the registrations of all stillbirths and infant deaths occurring in South Wales among infants born {{in the three years}} of the survey; while it is possible that some deaths occurred outside the survey area, their number is likely to be so small as to have a negligible effect on the infant mortality rates reported here.

40|$|In April 2000 the Western Australian Birth Defects Registry {{held its}} 20 th Anniversary Scientific Symposium to signify the first 20 {{years of the}} Birth Defects Registry in Western Australia. At the Symposium, {{significant}} trends and occurrences in birth defects within Western Australia over the past 20 years were addressed. One factor highlighted in the Registry 2 ̆ 7 s 1980 - 1999 report was that birth defects were reported less frequently in rural regions compared with metropolitan areas. Data collected from the metropolitan area is considered by the Birth Defects Registry {{to be the most}} accurate. Therefore, incidence rates of birth defects in this area arc used as a benchmark for determining the incidence of birth defects throughout Western Australia. The aim {{of this study was to}} explore the lower incidence of birth defects in the Midwest of Western Australia compared with that of metropolitan Western Australia. The study investigated if the observed lower incidence of birth defects in the Midwest was due to case under reporting. The study target population included newborns whose mothers were Midwest residents at the time of their birth between the years of 1995 - 1999. A mixed methodological approach, combining capture-recapture and thematic analysis was used. The study was conducted in two phases. The first phase involved the collection of quantitative data. The potential target population in the Midwest consisted of 5066 births. A sample of 440 newborn case notes were selected randomly from the target population and accessed from client files held at Geraldton Regional Hospital. A record was made of any reportable birth defects. The result provided demographic and descriptive statistics, which were compared with data held by the Birth Defects Registry regarding the Midwest. This mode of sample collection is known as capture-recapture methodology. Comparison of data from the sample with data from the Registry was used to document the existence of discrepancies and to enable an ascertainment-adjusted analysis to be performed. To address the study 2 ̆ 7 s aims, the ascertainment adjusted rate was compared with the rates occurring in the metropolitan area. In Phase 1, quantitative findings showed the lower incidence of birth defects diagnosed in infants during the newborn period in the Midwest of Western Australia was unlikely to be due to case under reporting. Possible factors contributing to the lower incidence of birth defects in the Midwest compared to the Metropolitan area were discussed. These include the lower maternal age of Midwest mothers, a higher Aboriginal population, study sample bias and case under-reporting beyond the newborn period. Full exploration of these issues, however, was outside the scope of this study and is an area for future research. The second phase of the study involved collection of qualitative data. Health professionals reporting birth defects in the Midwest were asked to participate in focus group interviews. Three groups of health professionals were targeted: general practitioners; midwives; and child health nurses. Interview responses were transcribed and indexed according to common themes and issues. This analysis provided insight into the cause of empirical findings and discrepancies, allowing for recommendations focused on improving and/or sustaining <b>birth</b> defect <b>notification</b> practices of health professionals in the Midwest of Western Australia. Findings showed that a knowledge deficit regarding the reporting of birth defects exists in targeted Midwest health professionals. Possible reasons for the knowledge deficit included high transfer rates of newborns affected by birth defects, uncertainty regarding the responsibility of birth defect reporting, limited use of <b>birth</b> defect <b>notification</b> cards by health professionals and the lack of ongoing education and promotion of birth defects in the Midwest Region. Study recommendations include further research to explore factors contributing to the lower incidence of birth defects in the Midwest, education and promotion regarding birth defects and the role of the Birth Defects Registry, amending and centralising <b>birth</b> defect <b>notification</b> cards, and legislating the reporting of birth defects in Western Australia...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{methods for}} estimating {{the efficiency of}} measles and pertussis notification with particular reference to England and Wales. Crude estimates are obtained from a comparison of annual numbers of <b>births</b> and <b>notifications,</b> and this approach is modified to include detailed age-specific data. Other sources of data, notably the Hospital In-Patient Enquiry, are used to give detailed estimates over time. These analyses provide evidence for a strong positive correlation between notification efficiency and incidence for both diseases and for a dramatic fall in the notification efficiency for pertussis between 1957 and 1976. This decrease {{is of particular interest}} insofar as it could explain in part the apparent fall in size of successive pertussis epidemics during that period. It is estimated that since 1976 the spotter practices of the Royal College of General Practitioners General Practice Research Unit have been approximately 1. 5 times more efficient at reporting measles and 2. 5 times more efficient at reporting pertussis than the national average for reporting to the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys. Finally it is noted that estimates of notification efficiency are positively correlated with the assumed level of vaccine efficacy, and that all these methods require assumptions concerning the proportion of vaccinations which are recorded, the proportion of vaccinations which are successful in immunizing the recipient, and the proportion of the population which ultimately contracts the infection. In general, measles notification in England and Wales is considerably better than that for pertussis, being of the order of 40 - 60 % for the former and only 5 - 25 % for the latter...|$|R
40|$|Civil Registration (CR) of {{births and}} deaths is an {{essential}} component of any health information system. Globally, across low income countries, CR suffers from unacceptably poor quality coverage. This Health Information Systems Knowledge Hub (HIS Hub) working paper summarises and reports the results, conclusions and outlook from a small six-month project that investigated the potential of introducing a mobile phone step into the routine CR system in a rural district in Tanzania. The project developed a computer application that could receive SMS messages—from existing basic mobile phones of community-based CR officers—and feed them directly to the District Registrar’s office and computer. The message contained the details from the <b>birth</b> or death <b>notification</b> form. The system provided instant access to notifications and automatic feedback to the Village Executive Officer (VEO) if the family that experienced the birth or death event failed to register the event for certification. It also prompted the VEO to follow up with the family by conducting a questionnaire, administered by mobile phone, to determine and communicate the reasons for the non-registration. The District Civil Registrar was also able to monitor trends in these notifications via a user-friendly webbased browser and dashboard. The system was tested for six months and validated against an independent prospective household surveillance system that monitors pregnancies, births and deaths in the same period. In summary, the findings showed that the routine CR system notified only 28...|$|R
40|$|The new {{perinatal}} death certificate {{proposed by the}} World Health Organisation was examined in relation to existing measures for recording {{perinatal death}} statistics and also with regard to new information gathered. Present procedures appear to underestimate the number of perinatal deaths by roughly 10 %, though late registrations may lower this figure slightly. The use of a minimum birth weight as the criterion for inclusion in perinatal statistics removed much of the uncertainty associated with definitions of live birth and stillbirth. The new certificate led to duplication of some information already recorded through <b>birth</b> <b>notification</b> yet failed to provide information on some other factors generally considered relevant to perinatal mortality. The format proposed for recording cause of death provided a more logical presentation of events. Standardizing birth information recorded on all infants, modifying death certificates, and developing efficient record-linkage schemes would be more valuable than introducing the WHO certificate. Useful interpretation {{of the meaning of}} the characteristics of infants dying in the perinatal period awaits these timely changes...|$|E
40|$|The United Kingdom Congenital Malformations Notification Scheme {{began in}} 1964. It {{is based on}} notes added to <b>birth</b> <b>notification</b> forms.

The extent and nature of the deficiencies are described. They include defects of ascertainment of malformed infants and of major additional malformations in those infants who are in fact notified, overnotification of infants without significant malformations, and misclassification of the major malformations that were, in fact, notified. The defects arise partly from the defective design of the national scheme and partly from defective implementation and a lack of designated supervisory responsibilities.

40|$|To {{examine the}} changes in the {{maternal}} mortality ratio (MMR) and causes of maternal death in Taiwan based on nationwide linked data sets. We linked four population-based data sets (birth registration, <b>birth</b> <b>notification,</b> National Health Insurance inpatient claims, and cause of death mortality data) to identify maternal deaths for 2004 - 2011. Subsequently, we calculated the MMR (deaths per 100, 000 live births) and the proportion of direct and indirect causes of maternal death by maternal age and year. Based on the linked data sets, we identified 236 maternal death cases, of which only 102 were reported in officially published mortality data, with an underreporting rate of 57 % [(236 - 102) × 100 / 236]. The age-adjusted MMR was 18. 4 in 2004 - 2005 and decreased to 12. 5 in 2008 - 2009; however, the MMR leveled off at 12. 6 in 2010 - 2011. The MMR increased from 5. 2 in 2008 - 2009 to 7. 1 in 2010 - 2011 for patients aged 15 - 29 years. Women aged 15 - 29 years had relatively lower proportion in dying from direct causes (amniotic fluid embolism and obstetric hemorrhage) compared with their counterpart older women. Approximately two-thirds of maternal deaths were not reported in officially published mortality data. Routine surveillance of maternal mortality by using enhanced methods is necessary to monitor the health status of reproductive-age women.

40|$|AbstractObjective: Cleft lip with {{or without}} cleft palate (CL±P) or cleft palate (CP) are groups of malformations named {{orofacial}} clefts (OC), which are the second leading cause of birth defects. This study aimed to analyze clinical and epidemiological features of Brazilian patients with OC, studying cases treated in the reference center {{of the state of}} Paraná (PR). Methods: 2, 356 charts were reviewed and 1, 838 were evaluated by the same clinical geneticist. Data were collected in the reference center, and compared with those of the Health Department of the state of Paraná. Clinical characteristics, presence of other anomalies, and birth prevalence were evaluated. Results: 389 (21. 2 %) patients had CP, 437 (23. 8 %) had cleft lip (CL), and 1, 012 (55 %) had cleft lip and palate (CLP). Syndromic OC were identified in 15. 3 % of patients, 10. 4 % of patients with CL±P, and 33. 9 % of patients with CP. Common additional anomalies were: central nervous system, limbs, cardiovascular, and musculoskeletal defects. The number of syndromic cases was lower when clinical evaluation was performed by other medical specialists when compared to that of the clinical geneticist. Birth prevalence was 1 / 1, 010 live <b>births.</b> Lack of <b>notification</b> with the national birth registry was observed in 49. 9 % of CL±P. The present data suggests a decrease of 18. 52 % in the prevalence of non-syndromic OC after folic acid fortification in Brazil. Conclusion: Better understanding of clinical and epidemiological aspects of OC is crucial to improve the understanding of pathogenesis, promote preventive strategies, and guide clinical care, including the presence of clinical geneticists in the multidisciplinary team for OC treatment...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{setting for}} this {{analysis}} is the low tuberculosis (TB) incidence state of New South Wales (NSW), Australia. Local level analysis of TB epidemiology in people from high incidence countries-of-birth (HIC) in a low incidence setting has not been conducted in Australia {{and has not been}} widely reported. Local level analysis could inform measures such as active case finding and targeted earlier diagnosis. The aim {{of this study was to}} use a novel approach to identify local areas in an Australian state that have higher TB rates given the local areas’ country of birth profiles. Methods TB notification data for the three year period 2006 – 2008 were analysed by grouping the population into those from a high-incidence country-of-birth and the remainder. Results During the study period there were 1401 notified TB cases in the state of NSW. Of these TB cases 76. 5 % were born in a high-incidence country. The annualised TB notification rate for the high-incidence country-of-birth group was 61. 2 / 100, 000 population and for the remainder of the population was 1. 8 / 100, 000. Of the 152 Local Government Areas (LGA) in NSW, nine had higher and four had lower TB notification rates in their high-incidence country-of-birth populations when compared with the high-incidence country-of-birth population for the rest of NSW. The nine areas had a higher proportion of the population with a country of <b>birth</b> where TB <b>notification</b> rates are > 100 / 100, 000. Those notified with TB in the nine areas also had a shorter length of stay in Australia than the rest of the state. The areas with higher TB notification rates were all in the capital city, Sydney. Among LGAs with higher TB notification rates, four had higher rates in both people with a high-incidence country of birth and people not born in a high-incidence country. The age distribution of the HIC population was similar across all areas, and the highest differential in TB rates across areas was in the 5 – 19 years age group. Conclusions Analysing local area TB rates and possible explanatory variables can provide useful insights into the epidemiology of TB. TB notification rates that take country of birth in local areas into account could enable health services to strategically target TB control measures. </p...|$|R
40|$|Studies of postneonatal {{mortality}} in Nottingham between 1974 and 1977 showed a familiar pattern of high death rates in socially deprived {{parts of the}} city. A birth scoring system was devised, which identified at birth 9 % of infants in whom 53 % of postneonatal deaths {{could be expected to}} occur From 1 January 1978 this group was identified by midwives and followed up intensively by health visitors. The postneonatal {{mortality in}} the city of Nottingham fell from 8. 7 / 1000 live births in 1974 to 3. 6 / 1000 in 1981. It was not possible, however, to show that the rate of improvement after the introduction of the birth scoring system was greater than the trend present before its introduction. The causes of postneonatal death, and their geographical and seasonal distribution, were similar in 1978 - 81 and 1974 - 77, despite an absolute fall in numbers. By 1981 the important risk factors were either recorded on the <b>birth</b> <b>notification</b> or known to the health visitor in any case.

40|$|Objective: Pregnancy-associated {{death is}} defined by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists as “a death of a woman while {{pregnant}} or within 1  year of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the cause of death. ” We sought to determine pregnancy-associated mortality ratio (PAMR) in Taiwan and to compare the cause of death pattern with other countries to assess the national health status of Taiwanese women. Materials and methods: We linked four nationwide population-based data sets (birth registration, <b>birth</b> <b>notification,</b> National Health Insurance claims, and cause of death mortality) from 2004 to 2011 to identify women aged 15 – 49  years that died from pregnancy-associated deaths. We then calculated the PAMR and cause of death distribution by maternal age. Results: A total of 559 pregnancy-associated deaths were identified with an overall PAMR of 36 (deaths per 100, 000 live births). The J-shaped age-specific PAMR mortality pattern was noted, in which the PAMR was 32, 25, 24, 36, 71, 143, and 369 for women aged 15 – 19  years, 20 – 24  years, 25 – 29  years, 30 – 34  years, 35 – 39  years, 40 – 44  years, and 45 – 49  years, respectively. The age-standardized PAMR decreased drastically from 45 in 2004 – 2005 to 36 in 2006 – 2007 and 30 in 2008 – 2009, but leveled off to 33 in 2010 – 2011. The proportion of indirect causes increased from 2004 – 2007 to 2008 – 2011 among women aged 15 – 29  years and 35 – 49  years. Conclusion: Compared with previous studies, the PAMR of Taiwan is moderate. However, the proportion of external causes of pregnancy-associated deaths in Taiwan is the lowest compared with other regions.

40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE: The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to describe the epidemiology of neural tube defects (NTD) in the eastern region of Ireland using the EUROCAT register of congenital malformations. DESIGN, SETTING AND PATIENTS: EUROCAT registries monitor the prevalence of congenital anomalies in defined populations using multiple sources for case ascertainment. All cases of NTD on the Dublin EUROCAT register born between 1980 and 1994 were extracted and analysed. The crude birth prevalence rate for all NTD, spina bifida, anencephaly and encephalocoele were calculated for each year. Parameters measured were: sex ratio, stillbirth rate, proportion of low birth-weight babies (< 2500 g) and the proportion who were premature (< 37 weeks gestation). MAIN RESULTS: Of 821 NTD cases, 419 (51. 0 %) had spina bifida, 322 (39. 2 %) had anencephaly, 69 (8. 4 %) had encephalocoele and 11 (1. 3 %) were iniencephalic. The crude birth prevalence of NTD decreased fourfold from 46. 9 / 10, 000 births in 1980 to 11. 6 / 10, 000 in 1994. The downward trend ceased during the early 1990 's. Younger mothers had significantly higher rates of NTD affected births. Twenty two per cent of NTD cases had additional non-central nervous system anomalies. In 40 cases, there was a previous family history of NTD in siblings. Seasonal effects in birth prevalence were observed. <b>Birth</b> <b>notification</b> was the most frequent mechanism of ascertainment. CONCLUSION: There was a marked fall in the birth prevalence of NTD during the 15 year period. This change was real and not accounted for by pre-natal screening and diagnostic practises with termination of pregnancy, which is not legally permissible in Ireland. Dietary factors may have had an influence. Rates of NTD in this region are still higher than many other parts of Europe. Primary prevention strategies through increased folic acid intake are necessary to further reduce NTD affected births...|$|E

SUBJECTS [...] Cases were all infants born 1975 to 1987 who died of SIDS on whom <b>birth</b> <b>notification</b> information was available (n = 348). The live birth cohort 1980 - 87 (n = 55, 944) was used as the control population for risk factor identification. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS [...] The median ages of death for spring, summer, autumn, and winter born infants were 115, 103. 5, 91 and 78 days. Spring and summer born infants died at a significantly older median age than winter born infants. The month of birth distribution of SIDS cases did not alter significantly from a uniform, nonseasonal distribution (p greater than 0. 25) but month of death was seasonally distributed (p less than 0. 01). Premature and low birthweight infants died at an older median age (p less than 0. 05) than term and non-low-birthweight infants. An excess of male infant deaths and infant deaths to older mothers occurred during winter (p less than 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS [...] The pathogenesis of SIDS can be represented as a biphasic model with three pathways of risk factor operation. In this study, season influenced the age at death of SIDS infants. We propose that risk factors with a strong seasonal distribution are likely to be operating in the postnatal period...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Nearly half of births {{in low-income}} {{countries}} occur without a skilled attendant, {{and even fewer}} mothers and babies have postnatal contact with providers who can deliver preventive or curative services that save lives. Community-based maternal and newborn care programs with postnatal home visits have been tested in Bangladesh, Malawi, and Nepal. This paper examines coverage and content of home visits in pilot areas and factors associated with receipt of postnatal visits. METHODS: Using data from cross-sectional surveys of women with live births (Bangladesh 398, Malawi: 900, Nepal: 615), generalized linear models {{were used to assess}} the strength of association between three factors - receipt of home visits during pregnancy, birth place, <b>birth</b> <b>notification</b> - and receipt of home visits within three days after birth. Meta-analytic techniques were used to generate pooled relative risks for each factor adjusting for other independent variables, maternal age, and education. FINDINGS: The proportion of mothers and newborns receiving home visits within three days after birth was 57 % in Bangladesh, 11 % in Malawi, and 50 % in Nepal. Mothers and newborns were more likely to receive a postnatal home visit within three days if the mother received at least one home visit during pregnancy (OR 2. 18, CI 1. 46 - 3. 25), the birth occurred outside a facility (OR 1. 48, CI 1. 28 - 1. 73), and the mother reported a CHW was notified of the birth (OR 2. 66, CI 1. 40 - 5. 08). Checking the cord was the most frequently reported action; most mothers reported at least one action for newborns. CONCLUSIONS: Reaching mothers and babies with home visits during pregnancy and within three days after birth is achievable using existing community health systems if workers are available; linked to communities; and receive training, supplies, and supervision. In all settings, programs must evaluate what community delivery systems can handle and how to best utilize them to improve postnatal care access...|$|E
