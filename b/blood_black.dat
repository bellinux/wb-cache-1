5|$|Digestive tract telangiectasias may be {{identified}} on esophagogastroduodenoscopy (endoscopy of the esophagus, stomach and {{first part of}} the small intestine). This procedure will typically only be undertaken if there is anemia that is more marked than expected by the severity of nosebleeds, or if there is evidence of severe bleeding (vomiting <b>blood,</b> <b>black</b> stools). If the number of lesions seen on endoscopy is unexpectedly low, the remainder of the small intestine may be examined with capsule endoscopy, in which the patient swallows a capsule-shaped device containing a miniature camera which transmits images of the digestive tract to a portable digital recorder.|$|E
25|$|Galen's humoral {{theories}} were {{influential in}} Europe in the Middle Ages for centuries afterward. In this theory, stuttering {{was attributed to}} imbalances of the four bodily humors—yellow bile, <b>blood,</b> <b>black</b> bile, and phlegm. Hieronymus Mercurialis, writing in the sixteenth century, proposed methods to redress the imbalance including changes in diet, reduced libido (in men only), and purging. Believing that fear aggravated stuttering, he suggested techniques to overcome this. Humoral manipulation {{continued to be a}} dominant treatment for stuttering until the eighteenth century. Partly due to a perceived lack of intelligence because of his stutter, the man who became the Roman emperor Claudius was initially shunned from the public eye and excluded from public office.|$|E

The q-b ate her macaroon biscuits all through the streets, and we went towards the ship. The fat boatman hailed us to take us back. It was just about eight yards of water to row, the ship being moored on the quay: one could have jumped it. I gave the fat boatman two liras, two francs. He immediately put on the socialist-workman indignation, and thrust the note back at me. Sixty centimes more! The fee was thirteen sous each way! In Venice or Syracuse it would be two sous. I {{looked at him and}} gave him the money and said: [...] "Per Dio, we are in Trapani!" [...] He muttered back something about foreigners.

60|$|It {{was near}} midnight. Raphael {{had been sitting}} some three hours in Miriam's inner chamber, waiting in vain for her return. To recover, if possible, his ancestral wealth; to convey it, without a day's delay, to Cyrene; and, if possible, to persuade the poor old Jewess to {{accompany}} him, and there to soothe, to guide, perhaps to convert her, was his next purpose:--at all events, with or without his wealth, to flee from that accursed city. And he counted impatiently the slow hours and minutes which detained him in an atmosphere which seemed reeking with innocent <b>blood,</b> <b>black</b> with the lowering curse of an avenging God. More than once, unable to bear the thought, he rose to depart, and leave his wealth behind: but he was checked again {{by the thought of}} his own past life. How had he added his own sin to the great heap of Alexandrian wickedness! How had he tempted others, pampered others in evil! Good God! how had he not only done evil with all his might, but had pleasure in those who did the same! And now, now he was reaping the fruit of his own devices. For years past, merely to please his lust of power, his misanthropic scorn, he had been malting that wicked Orestes wickeder than he was even by his own base will and nature; and his puppet had avenged itself upon him! He, he had prompted him to ask Hypatia's hand.... He had laid, half in sport, half in envy of her excellence, that foul plot against the only human being whom he loved.... and he had destroyed her! He, and not Peter, was the murderer of Hypatia! True, he had never meant her death.... No; but had he not meant for her worse than death? He had never foreseen.... No; but only because he did not choose to foresee. He had chosen to be a god; to kill and to make alive by his own will and law; and behold, he had become a devil by that very act. Who can--and who dare, even if he could--withdraw the sacred veil from those bitter agonies of inward shame and self-reproach, made all the more intense by his clear and undoubting knowledge that he was forgiven? What dread of punishment, what blank despair, could have pierced that great heart so deeply as did the thought that the God whom he had hated and defied had returned him good for evil, and rewarded him not according to his iniquities? That discovery, as Ezekiel of old had warned his forefathers, filled up the cup of his self-loathing.... To have found at last the hated and dreaded name of God: and found that it was Love!.... To possess Victoria, a living, human likeness, however imperfect, of that God; and to possess in her a home, a duty, a purpose, a fresh clear life of righteous labour, perhaps of final victory.... That was his punishment; that was the brand of Cain upon his forehead; and he felt it greater than he could bear.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{compare the}} {{efficacy}} and reproducibility of <b>black</b> <b>blood</b> T 2 ∗ {{to the conventional}} bright blood sequence {{in the assessment of}} myocardial iron concentration. Materials and methods: We performed both conventional bright <b>blood</b> and <b>black</b> <b>blood</b> MRI T 2 ∗ sequences in 50 thalassemia major patients, the results were statistically analyzed to assess the correlation of techniques, study reproducibility and interobserver agreement. Results: Cardiac T 2 ∗ values ranged from 2. 39 to 47. 9  ms using bright blood sequence and 2. 07 to 46. 81 using the <b>black</b> <b>blood</b> sequence. There was positive significant correlation of both sequences in all patients. However the <b>black</b> <b>blood</b> technique was superior to bright blood technique as regards the study reproducibility (R 2 ∗ 1. 9  ±  versus 2. 4  ±  14. 7 p <  0. 001) in addition to the better inter-observer agreement of <b>black</b> <b>blood</b> technique compared to the bright blood technique (3. 2  ±  1. 2 versus 8. 3  ±  2. 4 p <  0. 001). Conclusions: <b>Black</b> <b>blood</b> T 2 ∗ technique provides clearly defined septal borders, avoids bright blood signal contamination of the myocardium, has superior study reproducibility and inter-observer agreement which favors this technique in the assessment of iron myocardial concentration...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Purpose To {{assess whether}} <b>black</b> <b>blood</b> T 2 * {{cardiovascular}} magnetic resonance {{is superior to}} conventional white blood imaging of cardiac iron in patients with thalassaemia major (TM). Materials and methods We performed both conventional white <b>blood</b> and <b>black</b> <b>blood</b> T 2 * CMR sequences in 100 TM patients to determine intra and inter-observer variability and presence of artefacts. In 23 patients, 2 separate studies of both techniques were performed to assess interstudy reproducibility. Results Cardiac T 2 * values ranged from 4. 5 to 43. 8 ms. The mean T 2 * values were not different between <b>black</b> <b>blood</b> and white blood acquisitions (20. 5 vs 21. 6 ms, p = 0. 26). Compared with the conventional white blood diastolic acquisition, the coefficient of variance of the <b>black</b> <b>blood</b> CMR technique was superior for intra-observer reproducibility (1. 47 % vs 4. 23 %, p Conclusions <b>Black</b> <b>blood</b> T 2 * CMR has superior reproducibility and reduced imaging artefacts {{for the assessment of}} cardiac iron, in comparison with the conventional white blood technique, which make it the preferred technique for clinical practice. </p...|$|R
