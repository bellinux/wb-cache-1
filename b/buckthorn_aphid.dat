50|$|The <b>Buckthorn</b> <b>aphid</b> or Buckthorn-potato aphid (Aphis nasturtii) is an aphid in the {{superfamily}} Aphidoidea in {{the order}} Hemiptera. It is a true bug and sucks sap from plants. It is a cosmopolitan species.|$|E
40|$|The soybean aphid can be {{a serious}} pest of soybeans. This insect reached high numbers {{during the summer of}} 2001 in extreme {{northeast}} Iowa. Populations during 2002 were too low to cause economic damage; however, in 2003 infestations reached historically high populations and were above economic thresholds throughout most of Iowa. The soybean aphid has up to 15 to 18 generations annually. Overwintering eggs survive on buckthorn (Rhamnus). The nymphs hatch in the spring, and after winged female generations are born, they fly in search of soybeans. Throughout the summer, winged and wingless individuals are born. They feed on soybeans, and once crowded, the winged aphids fly in search of non-colonized soybeans. During the later stages of maturity, increased aphid mortality occurs due to the depletion of their food source, and surviving winged aphids migrate back to <b>buckthorn.</b> <b>Aphid</b> infestations that peak at the R 1 -R 2 soybean growth stages may cause stunted plant growth with possible yellowing of leaves with reduced pod and seed counts. A black residue, sooty mold, grows on honeydew, a by-product excreted by aphids found on leaves, stems, and pods. Ants are usually present when ample honeydew is present. The objective of this experiment was to measure the performance of several insecticides for control of the soybean aphid...|$|E

40|$|The soybean aphid (Aphis glycines), {{native to}} China, {{has become the}} most {{economically}} damaging insect in soybeans in northeast Iowa. Soybean aphid may have up to 18 generations per year, beginning with overwintering eggs on the alternate host buckthorn. In spring, winged <b>aphids</b> migrate from <b>buckthorn</b> to nearby emerged soybeans. Generations advance in these fields, and then another winged migration occurs in summer spreading from these fields to others. A third migration occurs in fall with aphids moving back to buckthorn. Depending on the season, soybean proximity to <b>buckthorn,</b> and soybean <b>aphid</b> migration patterns, populations of aphids tend to peak in soybeans anywhere from late July to early September. With higher aphid populations, the production of honeydew (the excrement of the aphid) and the resulting black fungus that grows on it (sooty mold) may become apparent. Aphid feeding may cause stunted plants, reduced pods and seeds, and may also transmit viruses that could cause mottling and distortion of leaves, reduced seed set, and discolored seeds...|$|R
5000|$|In two studies, the {{quantity}} of overwintering eggs had a strong positive correlation with the severity of soybean aphid outbreaks in the following spring.Eggs begin to hatch into fundatrices when temperatures in the spring reach [...] Colonization of <b>buckthorn</b> by soybean <b>aphids</b> in the spring can lead to curling of leaves and twigs. Near the blooming stage of buckthorn, fundatrices reproduce parthenogenetically to give viviparous birth to alatae. These winged soybean aphids begin the spring migration to their secondary host, soybean. Soybean aphids go through approximately 15 generations on soybean, {{all of which are}} primarily composed of [...] females produced through viviparous parthenogenesis. Each generation passes through 4 instars and can range from 2 to 16 days in length, with higher temperatures increasing development and decreasing generation time.Feeding by soybean aphids injures soybean by interfering with photosynthetic pathways—more specifically, biological mechanisms responsible for restoring chlorophyll to a low energy state are impaired. This restoration process is known as quenching and is important for plants to execute light reactions properly. Reduction in photosynthetic capacity of soybean may occur before plants begin to display symptoms of injury.|$|R

Soybean aphid, Aphis glycines Matsumura, is an invasive arthropod pest of soybean {{which has been}} present in North America since 2000. Aphid outbreaks cause economic damage via increased insecticide use and reduced yield. Management of this pest has been achieved almost exclusively with foliar applications of broad spectrum insecticides. The purpose {{of this research is}} to determine how a fungal pathogen of soybean aphid, Pandora neoaphidis, can contribute to the natural regulation of aphid populations. Pandora neoaphidis is an endemic aphid pathogen and the most frequently reported pathogen infecting soybean aphid. Analysis and field validation of a mathematical model describing the soybean aphid-P. neoaphidis pathosystem has shown that the fungus can establish and persist when aphid densities are lower than the economic threshold of 250 per plant; thus confirming that P. neoaphidis is capable of contributing to aphid control before aphids reach damaging densities. Additionally, field experiments demonstrate that emerging aphid management tactics including aphid-resistant soybean plants and insecticide seed treatments have minimal impacts on aphid infection rates by P. neoaphidis and are likely compatible with this natural enemy. Cage studies demonstrate that the presence of Harmonia axyridis in soybean aphid colonies also harboring P. neoaphidis has no impact on aphid infection by the fungus. Pandora neoaphidis may also be an important regulator of aphid populations on the aphids’ primary host, Rhamnus cathartica, or common <b>buckthorn,</b> as soybean <b>aphid</b> morphs which occur on this host are the most susceptible to infection. However, fungicide applications to soybean can have lasting impacts on the beneficial fungi infecting soybean aphid as foliar fungicide applications to soybean reduced the rate of aphid infection both before and after aphids moved to the primary host in the autumn. In summary, P. neoaphidis is likely an important member of the natural enemy community which provides a significant level of aphid biological control...|$|R
