40|$|Despite {{evidence}} for the associations of positive affect to prosocial <b>behaviors</b> <b>and</b> internalizing problems, relatively {{little is known about}} the underlying etiology. The sample comprised over 300 twin pairs at age 3. Positive affect, prosocial <b>behaviors,</b> <b>and</b> internalizing problems were assessed using the Toddler Behavior Assessment Questionnaire (Goldsmith, 1996), the Revised Rutter Parent Scale for Preschool Children (Hogg, Rutter, & Richman, 1997), <b>and</b> the Child <b>Behavior</b> Checklist for ages 1. 5 - 5 (Achenbach, 1991), respectively. Positive affect correlated positively with prosocial <b>behaviors,</b> <b>and</b> negatively with internalizing problems. Prosocial behaviors were negatively associated with internalizing problems. The relations of positive affect to prosocial <b>behaviors</b> <b>and</b> internalizing problems were due to environmental effects (shared and nonshared). In contrast, the link between prosocial <b>behaviors</b> <b>and</b> internalizing problems was entirely explained by genetic effects. The current study has moved beyond prior emphasis on negative affect and elucidated the less understood etiology underlying the associations between positive affect, prosocial <b>behaviors,</b> <b>and</b> internalizing problems. This study could guide the development of programs for promoting prosocial <b>behaviors</b> <b>and</b> alleviating internalizing problems in children...|$|R

The study identified teaching <b>behaviors</b> <b>and</b> skills that have emerged from the teacher effectiveness research and determined which of those <b>behaviors</b> <b>and</b> skills the teacher education faculty in each of the colleges and universities of The Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod (1) regard as important, (2) allocate time to teach, and (3) use as criteria to evaluate student teachers. A survey, "The Teacher Education <b>and</b> Teacher Effectiveness <b>Behaviors</b> <b>and</b> Skills Survey," was developed and sent to each of the 56 education faculty of the seven colleges and two universities of The Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod. The survey included twenty commonly agreed upon teacher effectiveness <b>behaviors</b> <b>and</b> skills. The majority of the responses by the education faculty of the seven colleges and two universities of The Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod indicated that faculty members do regard the <b>behaviors</b> <b>and</b> skills that have emerged from the teacher effectiveness research as important.

40|$|This {{research}} {{explores the}} link between information cul-ture and information use in three organizations. We ask {{if there is a}} way to systematically identify information <b>behaviors</b> <b>and</b> values that can characterize the informa-tion culture of an organization, and whether this culture has an effect on information use outcomes. The primary method of data collection was a questionnaire survey that was applied to a national law firm, a public health agency, and an engineering company. Over 650 persons in the three organizations answered the survey. Data analysis suggests that the questionnaire instrument was able to elicit information <b>behaviors</b> <b>and</b> values that denote an organization’s information culture. Moreover, the information <b>behaviors</b> <b>and</b> values of each organiza-tion were able to explain 30 – 50 % of the variance in infor-mation use outcomes. We conclude that it is possible to identify <b>behaviors</b> <b>and</b> values that describe an organiza-tion’s information culture, and that the sets of identified <b>behaviors</b> <b>and</b> values can account for significant propor-tions of the variance in information use outcomes...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Objectives: Children {{learn by}} observing and imitating others, meaning that their eating <b>behaviors</b> <b>and</b> {{physical}} activity {{may be influenced}} by their peers. This paper systematically reviews how preschoolers’ eating <b>behaviors</b> <b>and</b> physical activity relate to their peers’ <b>behaviors,</b> <b>and</b> discusses avenues for future research. Methods: Six databases were searched for quantitative, peer-reviewed studies published up to July 2015 reporting on the correlates, predictors or effectiveness of peers on eating <b>behaviors</b> <b>and</b> physical activity in preschoolers. Risk of bias was independently assessed by two evaluators using the Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies. Results: Thirteen articles were included: six measured physical activity, and seven assessed eating behaviors. Four of the six physical activity studies reported that children were more active when peers were present, while large peer group size was negatively associated with physical activity in two cross-sectional studies. All nutrition interventions reported that children’s eating behaviors {{may be influenced by}} their peers. Conclusions: Although supported by weak evidence, peers appear to influence children’s eating <b>behaviors</b> <b>and</b> physical activity. However, this influence may be moderated by the number of peers, gender, age and the perceived status of the role models. Future obesity prevention interventions should consider involving peers as agents for positive eating <b>behaviors</b> <b>and</b> physical activity in preschoolers...|$|R

40|$|A {{novel and}} generic {{approach}} named as &quot;history-oriented envisioning &quot; is proposed to qualitatively envision {{all the possible}} and the sound situations focusing on our intended partial <b>behaviors</b> <b>and</b> actions of an objective system. Some basic notations called a &quot;partial history &quot; and a &quot;partial situation &quot; are introduced as the extensions of the conventional history and its situations representing qualitative, temporal <b>behaviors</b> <b>and</b> actions of the system.

A major characteristic of the envisioning proposed here is its low complexity attained by the specified history of <b>behaviors</b> <b>and</b> actions {{in addition to the}} conventional scenario. Another important characteristic is its incremental structure enabling the iterative import of the predicted and/or observed information of the objective system. The feasibility of the proposed method is demonstrated by an example of controlling a steam generator of a plant.
