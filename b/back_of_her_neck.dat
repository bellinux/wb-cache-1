5|$|Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea) {{is seated}} in a chair in Assistant Director Walter Skinner's office, where he is shown a video from the morgue. Skinner tells him that Miles is somehow alive and still out to get Scully and her unborn child. Suddenly, Agent Gene Crane comes to Doggett and tells him {{that there is a}} person—Knowle Rohrer—who wants to see him, about issues {{concerning}} Miles and Scully. This leaves Fox Mulder and Skinner to interrogate Krycek. Rohrer fabricates a story to Doggett that Miles is part of a Military Project to create a super soldier and that Scully had a chip put in the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>neck</b> during her abduction to make her pregnant with the first organic version of a super soldier.|$|E
5|$|Melvin Frohike visits Scully's {{apartment}} and shows her {{a newspaper article}} about Kenneth Soona's murder. When she returns to FBI headquarters, the metal detector curiously goes off. Scully presents Skinner with the newspaper article, thinking that the data from Soona's death can clear Mulder in his father's murder. Skinner, however, refuses to do any follow-up on it. After Scully leaves it is revealed that the Cigarette Smoking Man was waiting in an adjacent room to question Skinner about the exchange. Leaving the building, Scully has a hunch upon seeing the metal detector again that leads to locating metal in the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>neck.</b> Scully sees a doctor, who removes a small metal implant.|$|E
5|$|During the trip, The Smoking Man tells Scully that he {{believes}} he shares a special kinship with her because he once held her own life in his hands. Mulder finds a message Scully left on his phone suspicious and goes to her apartment, where the landlord tells him that she left with someone else. The Smoking Man and Scully arrive {{at the home of}} Marjorie Butters (Louise Latham), a 118-year-old gardener who also has the chip implanted in the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>neck.</b> Meanwhile, Mulder visits Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) to voice his concern, but Scully calls Skinner during the meeting and says that she is fine. At a gas station, Scully removes the wire, places it in an envelope, and mails it to Mulder. However, a man following the two removes the letter from the mailbox.|$|E
60|$|These sounds Cecilia heard, when, {{from the}} open door, she saw the thin <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> husband's <b>neck,</b> with its softly {{graduated}} hair, bent forward above the bureau. She stole over to him, and pressed herself against his arm.|$|R
60|$|Presently Malchus {{was sent}} for again, and found Julia {{sitting on the}} couch by the side <b>of</b> <b>her</b> mother, and he at once {{acknowledged}} to himself that he had seldom seen a fairer woman. She was tall, and her figure was full and well proportioned. Her glossy hair was wound in a coil at the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> head, <b>her</b> <b>neck</b> and arms were bare, and she wore a garment of light green silk, and embroidered with gold stripes along the bottom, reaching down to her knees, while beneath it a petticoat of Tyrian purple reached nearly to the ground.|$|R
50|$|At 9:55pm, a passerby dialed 911 {{to report}} a woman {{bleeding}} {{at the corner of}} Edgehill Road and East Rock Road,1.9 miles from the Yale campus where Jovin was last seen alive. When police arrived at 9:58pm, they found Jovin fatally stabbed 17 times in the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> head and <b>neck</b> and <b>her</b> throat slit. She was lying on her stomach, feet in the road, body on the grassy area between the road and the sidewalk. She was fully clothed and still wearing her watch and earrings, with a crumpled up dollar bill in her pocket. Her wallet was later found to be still in her room. Suzanne Jovin was officially pronounced dead at 10:26pm at Yale New Haven Hospital.|$|R
5|$|The Malaysian Penanggalan is a {{woman who}} {{obtained}} her beauty through the active use of black magic or other unnatural means, and is most commonly described in local folklore to be dark or demonic in nature. She is able to detach her fanged head which flies around in the night looking for blood, typically from pregnant women. Malaysians hung jeruju (thistles) around the doors and windows of houses, hoping the Penanggalan would not enter for fear of catching its intestines on the thorns. The Leyak is a similar being from Balinese folklore of Indonesia. A Kuntilanak or Matianak in Indonesia, or Pontianak or Langsuir in Malaysia, {{is a woman}} who died during childbirth and became undead, seeking revenge and terrorising villages. She appeared as an attractive woman with long black hair that covered a hole in the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>neck,</b> with which she sucked the blood of children. Filling the hole with her hair would drive her off. Corpses had their mouths filled with glass beads, eggs under each armpit, and needles in their palms to prevent them from becoming langsuir. This description would also fit the Sundel Bolongs.|$|E
25|$|Young moviegoers began emulating romantic {{stars on}} the screen, such as Ronald Colman and Rudolph Valentino, the latter known for ending his passionate scenes with a kiss. Valentino also began his romantic scenes with women by kissing her hand, {{traveling}} up her arm, and then kissing her on the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>neck.</b> Female actresses were often turned into stars based on their screen portrayals of passion. Actresses like Nazimova, Pola Negri, Vilma Bánky and Greta Garbo, became screen idols as a result.|$|E

She became an honorary citizen of Tirana, and was given the honorary title of Tirana Ambassador of Culture and Tourism in the World by Tirana mayor Lulzim Basha. Additionally, she was given honorary citizen status in her father's home town of Korçë, Albania.|$|E
5000|$|One <b>of</b> <b>her</b> {{works that}} {{depicted}} a pregnant female nude is Margaret Evans Pregnant (1978), {{now in a}} private collection. Margaret was painted while sitting on upright chair that forced her to expose her pregnant stomach even more, which became the central point in the canvas. Right behind the chair a mirror was placed which allowed the viewer to see the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> head and <b>neck.</b> However, the mirrored reflection did not look anything like Margaret's frontal portrait. The motive behind this particular section of the painting remains unknown, but art historian Jeremy Lewison says the image is [...] "an uncanny double of the sitter and the artist, presaging older age", and suggests that the reflection is of an older and wiser woman and perhaps a combination of Margaret and Neel's reflection. [...] Pamela Allara says Neel has been accurately characterized as a [...] "sort of artist-sociologist who revived and redirected the dying genre of ameliorative portraiture by merging objectivity with subjectivity, realism with expressionism. In visually interpreting a person's habitus, Neel understood {{that she could not}} be an objective observer, that <b>her</b> depictions would <b>of</b> necessity include <b>her</b> own response." ...|$|R
40|$|Problems {{encountered}} by a young, unmarried woman who, {{as a result}} of a spinal injury in an automobile accident, loses use of all four limbs and requires complex home health care services delivered by a network of health and social service agencies in a rural area of Kentucky. Economic, psychosocial, ethical, preventive, and medical aspects of health care are discussed. JOHN S. THOMPSON, M. D. (Chairman, Department of Medicine, Moderator) : Today's conference considers a 22 -year-old, unmarried woman who sustained a spinal injury in an automobile accident three years ago. The case will be presented by Dr. Flanigan. ROBERT C. FLANIGAN, M. D. (Associate Professor, Department ofSurgery) : I will present a brief summary of this patient's medical history for the three years following her accident. This 19 -year-old woman was driving alone on a state highway near her home in a rural area of Kentucky when she lost control of the car and was thrown from the vehicle when it left the road. She never lost consciousness and became immediately aware that she could not move her arms or legs. She was transferred to the emergency room of a local hospital reporting pain in the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> head and <b>neck,</b> and inability to move her extremities...|$|R
6000|$|With {{a slight}} {{deepening}} of the sardonic patience in his face, old Gaunt rose, took {{a bowl and}} spoon down from a shelf, and very slowly proceeded to make himself his evening meal. It consisted of crusts of bread soaked in hot water and tempered with salt, pepper, onion, {{and a touch of}} butter. And while he waited, crouched over the kettle, his son smoked his grayish clay and read his greenish journal; an old clock ticked and a little cat purred without provocation on the ledge of the tight-closed window. Then the door opened and the rogue-girl appeared. She shook her shoulders as though to dismiss the wetting she had got, took off her turn-down, speckly, straw hat, put on an apron, and rolled up her sleeves. Her arms were full and firm and red; the whole <b>of</b> <b>her</b> was full and firm. From her rosy cheeks to her stout ankles she was superabundant with vitality, the strangest contrast to her shadowy, thin old grandfather. About the preparation <b>of</b> <b>her</b> father's tea she moved with a sort of brooding stolidity, out of which would suddenly gleam a twinkle of rogue-sweetness, as when she stopped to stroke the little cat or to tickle the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> grandfather's lean <b>neck</b> in passing. Having set the tea, she stood by the table and said slowly: [...] "Tea's ready, father. I'm goin' to London." ...|$|R
25|$|In Season 2, Scully {{was kidnapped}} by an ex-FBI mental patient named Duane Barry, and then taken from Barry by a {{military}} covert operation that were working with the alien conspirators, but was later returned. In Season 3 she found out that a super hi-tech microchip has been implanted in the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>neck.</b> After having it removed, she developed cancer in the fourth season and was hospitalized after the cancer became terminal. She was saved after Mulder broke into the Department of Defense to retrieve another chip to be implanted back into her neck. At the time, Scully was also undergoing experimental medical treatments and was having a dramatic renewal of her faith.|$|E
25|$|Also spelled langsuir or lang suyar, {{it is said}} to be {{the ghost}} of a woman who died while giving birth to a {{stillborn}} child which turns into a pontianak, or during pregnancy before the forty days of uncleanness have expired. The mother's grief changes her into a type of flying banshee. To prevent a pregnant woman's corpse from becoming a lang suir, glass beads are placed into the mouth, an egg is placed in each armpit, and needles are placed in the hands. The lang suir can appear as a beautiful woman with long nails (a traditional mark of beauty), ankle-length hair and dressed in green. They also have the ability to take the form of an owl with long talons. Being fond of eating fish, they usually haunt coastal areas and attack pregnant women out of jealousy. It is possible to tame a lang suir by cutting off her long nails and stuffing the hair into the hole at the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>neck.</b>|$|E

500|$|The black hennin is long, {{truncated}} {{and relatively}} plain [...] with a transparent veil which falls around the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>neck,</b> resting briefly on her shoulder. Probably it was kept relatively unadorned {{so as not}} to distract from the [...] necklace. Her costume is mostly black or brown, with a wide but high neckline and white fur lined hems on the sleeves. Portinari has dark eyes, a strong nose, full lips and a pointed chin. Her visible hand, folded in prayer but unrealistically off center, wears what looks like a jeweled ring. The dark sleeves of her dress contain red or rouge velvet-like cloth tightened by a white belt. Her hair is shaved back to achieve the high forehead and sculptural look fashionable at the time.|$|E
500|$|The obverse {{depicts a}} head of Liberty in the Greco-Roman style, [...] facing left, with her hair pulled back—according to numismatists Jeff Garrett and Ron Guth, [...] "attractively"—in a bun. [...] Some of her hair descends the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>neck.</b> [...] She wears a coronet, inscribed [...] "Liberty", and is {{surrounded}} by thirteen stars, representative of the original states, and the year of issue. The reverse features a heraldic eagle, holding a double ribbon, on which [...] "E Pluribus Unum" [...] is inscribed. The double ribbon is an allusion by Longacre to the denomination of the piece he was designing. The design is a variant on the Great Seal of the United States; the eagle protects a shield, which represents the nation, and holds an olive branch and arrows. Above the bird, Longacre again placed thirteen stars, arranged as a halo, together with an arc of rays.|$|E
500|$|The video, which Beyoncé has {{considered}} intimate and romantic, begins as she stands against a wall, illuminated by light that {{passes through a}} window. In one scene, Beyoncé's character, dressed in a skin-tight leotard, performs a dance sequence while her love interest {{looks down at her}} from a balcony. According to Michael Slezak of Entertainment Weekly, the dance routines pay homage to the 1983 romantic drama film Flashdance. Beyoncé and Ealy later stare adoringly at each other as they snuggle on a sofa. During the climax of the video, Beyoncé is shown underwater, dressed in white, moving slowly upwards. As the chorus begins, she opens her eyes; after Ealy kisses the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>neck,</b> the pair come face to face in the final scene, in which Beyoncé lies in bed, with Ealy above her. Jennifer Cady of E! Online wrote that the bright shiny lights in the video [...] "make [...] look like an angel". Alison Maloney of The Sun praised Beyoncé's [...] "amazing figure". The video was ranked at number 74 on BET's Notarized: Top100 Videos of 2009 countdown.|$|E

60|$|Some {{of those}} who were present at Mrs. Grainger's that evening {{remember}} her entrance into the drawing-room.

Mr. Reginald Farwell, who was there, afterwards declared that she seemed to have stepped out of the gentle landscape of an old painting.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Behçet's disease {{commonly}} presents with recurrent {{oral and}} genital mucocutaneous ulcerations, uveitis and various skin manifestations. Other clinical symptoms include gastrointestinal ulcerations, arthritis, venous thrombosis, arterial aneurysms and {{central nervous system}} affection. Vasculitis underlies most clinical symptoms of Behçet's disease. CASE PRESENTATION: We report {{the case of a}} 62 -year-old European Caucasian woman with Behçet's disease who presented with persistent fever and neck soft-tissue swelling, despite broad antibiotic treatment, two weeks after acute tonsillitis and a tonsillectomy. Diffuse epi- and mesopharyngeal swelling shown on a computed tomography scan <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>neck</b> and persistently elevated serum markers of inflammation initially prompted suspicion of an infectious etiology. Magnet resonance imaging <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>neck</b> and a neck tissue biopsy finally confirmed small vessel vasculitis involving skin, subcutaneous tissue and muscle. Considering the clinical presentation, past medical history and histological findings, we interpreted our patient's symptoms as a flare of Behçet's disease. Immunosuppressive treatment led to rapid clinical improvement. CONCLUSION: A patient with Behçet's disease developed small vessel vasculitis of the soft tissue <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>neck</b> after tonsillitis and a tonsillectomy. Infection and surgery probably triggered a flare of Behçet's disease...|$|R
