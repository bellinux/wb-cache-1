40|$|Introduction. In Sub-Saharan Africa, {{excessive}} foetal <b>head</b> <b>moulding</b> {{is commonly}} associated with cephalopelvic disproportion and obstructed labour. This study set out to determine the associations of maternal pelvis height and maternal height with intrapartum foetal <b>head</b> <b>moulding.</b> Methods. This was a multisite secondary analysis of maternal birth records of mothers with singleton pregnancies ending in a spontaneous vertex delivery. A summary {{of the details of}} the pregnancy and delivery records were reviewed and analysed using multilevel logistic regression respect to foetal <b>head</b> <b>moulding.</b> The alpha level was set at P< 0. 05. Results. 412 records were obtained, of which 108 / 385 (28 %) observed foetal <b>head</b> <b>moulding.</b> There was a significant reduction in risk of foetal <b>head</b> <b>moulding</b> with increasing maternal height (Adj. IRR 0. 97, P= 0. 05), maternal pelvis height (Adj. IRR 0. 88, P< 0. 01), and raptured membranes (Adj. IRR 0. 10, P< 0. 01). There was a significant increased risk of foetal <b>head</b> <b>moulding</b> with increasing birth weight (Adj. IRR 1. 90, P< 0. 01) and duration of monitored active labour (Adj. IRR 1. 21, P< 0. 01) in the final model. Conclusion. This study showed that increasing maternal height and maternal pelvis height were associated with a significant reduction in intrapartum foetal <b>head</b> <b>moulding...</b>|$|R
40|$|Fetal <b>head</b> <b>moulding</b> is a {{phenomenon}} that happens {{during the process of}} human childbirth. Due to the highly deformable fetal scalp being in contact with the maternal anatomy, the shape of the fetal head changes. This can be benefi�cial when the fetal head dimensions are very similar to the dimensions of the female pelvis hence allowing the baby to progress safely through the birth canal. Conversely, excessive <b>head</b> <b>moulding</b> may have serious eff�ects on the baby's wellbeing. The fi�rst part of this thesis presents a computer-based �finite element model of fetal <b>head</b> <b>moulding</b> as an improvement on previously developed models. The second part of the research focuses on another cause of potentially excessive fetal <b>head</b> <b>moulding,</b> i. e. the incorrect use of obstetric instruments including the obstetric forceps and the ventouse (vacuum extractor). The degree of damage that may be caused by incorrectly placing a forceps (i. e. asymmetric placement of the blades) or a ventouse (i. e. placement on top of soft parts of the skull such as the fontanelles) was assessed by means of fi�nite element analysis after developing a set of software tools to facilitate these experiments. The fi�nal results of this research included: an improved and more realistic model of fetal <b>head</b> <b>moulding</b> under conditions of normal delivery, and results that reveal the great potential of severe damage that obstetric forceps and/or the ventouse may cause to the baby's head when applied incorrectly...|$|R
40|$|Fetal <b>head</b> <b>moulding</b> is a {{phenomenon}} which may contribute to satisfactory progress during delivery as it allows the fetal head to accommodate to the geometry of the passage. In contrast, excessive <b>head</b> <b>moulding</b> may result in cranial birth injuries and thus affect the infant shortly or even long after birth. One group of researchers in the past investigated the biomechanics of fetal <b>head</b> <b>moulding</b> from an engineering {{point of view and}} limited themselves to a static, linear model of the parietal bones. In this paper, we present a non-linear model of the deformation of a complete fetal skull, when subjected to pressures exerted by the cervix, during the first stage of labour. The design of the model involves four main steps: shape recovery of the fetal skull, the generation of a valid and compatible mesh for finite element analysis (FEA), the specification of a physical model and the analysis of deformation. Results of the analysis show good agreement with those obtained from clinical experiments on the quantitative assessment of fetal <b>head</b> <b>moulding.</b> The model also displays shapes after moulding which have been reported in previous studies and which are generall...|$|R

Francie was hugely popular there, and the Japanese market dolls, and exclusive fashions produced for them, are the most valuable and sought after items amongst collectors today. The rarest of all the Francie dolls is the Japanese Sun Sun Malibu Francie. Essesntialy a Malibu Francie with deep suntan, but using the original Francie <b>head</b> <b>mould</b> with rooted lashes and long Brunette Sidepart hair, {{as opposed to the}} American issue which used the Casey <b>head</b> <b>mould,</b> no rooted lashes, blue eyes and had blonde sideparted hair. The dolls were produced in extremely limited number and when they are marketed for sale on the collectors market they command a price of $1000 and upwards.|$|R
