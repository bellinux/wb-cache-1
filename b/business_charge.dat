40|$|In {{the last}} few years it has been {{possible}} to observe decreasing interest margins for German universal banks. At the same time, institutions increasingly moved part of their business from interest to fee-earning activities. This study analyzes the determinants of non-interest income and its impact on financial performance and the risk profile of German banks between 1995 and 2007. We find empirical evidence that for all German universal banks risk-adjusted returns on equity and total assets are positively affected by higher fee income activities. Additionally, for commercial banks we show that a strong engagement in fee-generating activities goes along with higher risk. In order to analyze possible cross-subsidization effects between interest and fee business we also examine how banks ’ expansion in fee-based services has affected their interest margin. For savings and commercial banks we find that institutions with a strong focus on fee <b>business</b> <b>charge</b> lower interest margins when credit risk is controlled...|$|E
