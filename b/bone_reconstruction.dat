50|$|Acellular dermal {{matrices}} {{have been}} successful {{in a number of different}} applications. For example, skin grafts are used in cosmetic surgery and burn care. The decellularized skin graft provides mechanical support to the damaged area while supporting the development of host-derived connective tissue. Cardiac tissue has clinical success in developing human valves from natural ECM matrices. A technique known as the Ross procedure uses an acellular heart valve to replace a defective valve, allowing native cells to repopulate a newly functioning valve. Decellularized allografts have been critical in bone grafts that function in <b>bone</b> <b>reconstruction</b> and replacing of deformed bones in patients.|$|E
50|$|Several {{surgical}} {{techniques have}} been proposed regarding the tri-dimensional <b>bone</b> <b>reconstruction</b> of the severely resorbed maxilla, using different types of bone substitutes that have regenerative, osseoinductive or osseoconductive properties. In cases where augmentation materials used are autografts or allografts the bone density is quite low and resorption of the grafted site in these cases can reach up to 30% of original volume. For higher predictability, nonresorbable titanium-reinforced d-polytetrafluoroethylene (d-PTFE) membranes—as a barrier against the migration of epithelial cells within the grafted site—are recommended. In patients with systemic problems interdisciplinary collaboration is indicated to adjust therapy background {{so that it does}} not adversely affect implanto-prosthetic treatment.|$|E

As Finite Element modeling has become a well-established method for analysis of complex structures, an algorithm has been developed to build a Finite Element mesh from three-dimensional reconstruction information in voxels. Generated mesh is loaded in a finite element analysis software in order to simulate micro-architecture mechanical behavior under compression conditions.

By the early 21st century, there were over 500 papers published on the topic of bioactive glasses from different laboratories and institutions around the world.

50|$|After four years, Żygadło {{moved to}} the Russian League, where he played for Fakel Novy Urengoy for one season, 2012/2013. Then he moved to another Russian club, Zenit Kazan. He signed a 2-year {{contract}} and replaced Italian setter Valerio Vermiglio. On October 6, 2013 he was injured during training. He lost season 2013/2014, because of injury. He broke his foot, which is after two surgeries and reconstructions of bone. In the club from Kazan he {{has been replaced by}} Serbian setter Nikola Grbić. After two surgeries, <b>bone</b> <b>reconstruction</b> and rehabilitation, Żygadło returned to training in March 2014. After the season 2013/2014 Żygadło left Zenit Kazan. The contract was terminated by mutual agreement of both parties. After two seasons spent in Russia Żygadło accepted an offer from Italian club Trentino Volley. He returned to the club, where he won several titles in 2008-2012. His official return to the club from Trentino was announced on July 10, 2014 and the player stated he was glad about his return to the city and the team. On May 13, 2015 he won title of Italian Champion with Trentino Volley.|$|E
5000|$|There is {{no single}} {{strategy}} for treatment of facial clefts, {{because of the large}} amount of variation in these clefts. Which kind of surgery is used depends on the type of clefting and which structures are involved. There is much discussion about the timing of reconstruction of bone and soft tissue. The problem with early reconstruction is the recurrence of the deformity due to the intrinsic restricted growth. This requires additional operations at a later age to make sure all parts of the face are in proportion. A disadvantage of early <b>bone</b> <b>reconstruction</b> is the chance to damage the tooth germs, which are located in the maxilla, just under the orbit. The soft tissue reconstruction can be done at an early age, but only if the used skin flap can be used again during a second operation. The timing of the operation depends on the urgency of the underlying condition. If the operation is necessary to function properly, it should be done at early age. The best aesthetic result is achieved when the incisions are positioned in areas which attract the least attention (they cover up the scars). If, however, the function of a part of the face isn’t damaged, the operation depends on psychological factors and the facial area of reconstruction. [...] The treatment plan of a facial cleft is planned right after diagnosis. This plan includes every operation needed in the first 18 years of the patients life to reconstruct the face fully. In this plan, a difference is made between problems that need to be solved to improve the health of the patient (coloboma) and problems that need to be solved for a better cosmetic result (hypertelorism). [...] The treatment of the facial clefts can be divided in different areas of the face: the cranial anomalies, the orbital and eye anomalies, the nose anomalies, the midface anomalies and the mouth anomalies.|$|E

30|$|Recently, bone {{substitute}} materials {{have been used}} in prosthetic treatment with dental implants to reduce surgical invasion, cost, and potential resorption. These products have shown predictable results for localized defects and sinus floor augmentation [1, 2]. However, autogenous particulate cancellous bone and marrow (PCBM) is still the gold standard for extensive <b>bone</b> <b>reconstructions</b> because of the high level of osteocompetent cells for new bone formation. The ilium is the best donor site in terms of cellular quality, and the posterior ilium contains the largest amount of PCBM [3]. The disadvantage of conventional harvesting methods from the iliac crest is the increased risk of postoperative meralgia paresthetica, gait disturbance, pain, and bleeding [4 – 6]. To prevent these complications, less invasive procedures are required. This case report describes an alveolar ridge reconstruction with harvested PCBM from the iliac crest using a new minimally invasive technique.|$|R

30|$|There {{are limited}} {{therapeutic}} options for reconstruction of bone damaged by irradiation due to fibrosis, cell necrosis, and severe impairment of vascular supply. Non-vascularized free bone grafts are less {{effective in the}} irradiated field; therefore, their use is discouraged [8, 9]. Microvascular free tissue transfer has thus been considered {{the gold standard for}} <b>bone</b> <b>reconstruction</b> in the field of irradiation, as it overcomes the limitations of non-vascularized grafts [10 – 12]. However, the disadvantages of microvascular free tissue transfer include donor site morbidity and prolonged duration of surgery and hospitalization time. Additionally, ischemia in recipient site and radiation-induced perivascular thrombosis can decrease the success rate of <b>bone</b> <b>reconstruction</b> following the microvascular free flap technique [13, 14]. Therefore, further investigation of <b>bone</b> <b>reconstruction</b> strategy in irradiated area must be performed.

40|$|AbstractLarge bone defect {{treatment}} {{represents a}} great challenge due {{to the difficulty of}} functional and esthetic <b>reconstruction.</b> Tissue-engineered <b>bone</b> grafts created by in vitro manipulation of bioscaffolds, seed cells, and growth factors have been considered potential treatments for <b>bone</b> defect <b>reconstruction.</b> However, a significant gap remains between experimental successes and clinical translation. An emerging strategy for bridging this gap is using the in vivo bioreactor principle and flap prefabrication techniques. This principle focuses on using the body as a bioreactor to cultivate the traditional triad (bioscaffolds, seed cells, and growth factors) and leveraging the body's self-regenerative capacity to regenerate new tissue. Additionally, flap prefabrication techniques allow the regenerated bone grafts to be transferred as prefabricated bone flaps for <b>bone</b> defect <b>reconstruction.</b> Such a strategy has been used successfully for reconstructing critical-sized bone defects in animal models and humans. Here, we highlight this concept and provide some perspective on how to translate current knowledge into clinical practice...|$|R
