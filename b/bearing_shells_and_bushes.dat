40|$|During {{the past}} years {{advances}} in fuel efficiency of car engines {{did not result}} in the expectable reduction of the overall fuel consumption of new car generations. One reason is the increasing vehicle weight. In an overall-weight analysis of an auto-mobile the engine and as part of it, the crankcase represents a single component with a high weight reduction potential. The application of lightweight materials for new crankcase concepts implies comprehensive design considerations to achieve weight reductions {{as close as possible to}} the potential of the selected material. This paper discusses weight reduction strategies using lightweight materials and modern design approaches. Different design concepts were investigated to ensure a stiff overall crankcase structure. FE analysis was conducted on deep-skirt concepts with standard bearing caps and alternatively with cast-in reinforcements and on bed-plate concepts with thick main <b>bearing</b> <b>shells</b> <b>and</b> optionally with reinforcing cast-in structures. The analysis takes static, dynamic and thermal loads into account and results in the peak firing pressure limits of each concept. The limits in combination with other rele-vant parameters are used to define the best-suited lightweight design concept for the specific structural requirements of each engine type. The results show, that AVL’s new lightweight design strategies allow a significant reduction of engine mass compared to conventional concepts and represent an important contribution to reduce the overall vehicle weight...|$|R
40|$|Hydrodynamic flexure pivot {{tilting pad}} gas {{bearings}} (FPTPGBs) can enable successful operation of oil-free microturbomachinery. This work presents the experimental and analytical study of such bearings with different damper configurations. A test rig was constructed that could safely operate a ~ 28. 6 mm, 0. 8 kg rotor beyond 120 krpm. A time domain orbit simulation, which integrates nonlinear {{equations of motion}} for the rotor-bearing elements, was implemented as the primary analysis tool to predict rotor-bearing responses to imbalance, the presence and location of critical speeds, etc. Complementary analyses were also performed with a model that uses linear bearing impedance coefficients to predict system natural frequencies. Imbalance response testing verified that the rotor-bearing system behaved linearly in the region above the critical speed, and orbit simulations predicted the response to a calibrated imbalance with notable agreement. Viscoelastic dampers added behind the FPTPGB pads delayed the onset of subsynchronous vibrations (from 43 krpm without damper to above 50 krpm with damper) of the system with bearing clearance increased by shims. Midrange subsynchronous vibrations initiated at ~ 20 krpm were eventually suppressed by ~ 25 krpm due to the stabilizing effect of rotor centrifugal growth. The viscoelastic dampers had a negligible effect on suppressing these midrange subsynchronous vibrations in experiments, {{but this was not}} demonstrated in simulations, presumably due to much lower stiffness contribution of the damper at lower frequencies. The ideal, perfectly aligned models in the simulations were able to tolerate shims up to only 10 % of nominal clearance, but the test rig exhibited surprising stability with shims as much as 200 % of nominal clearance; this increase may be caused by imposed eccentricities due to misalignments in the test rig. FPTPGBs supported by compliant bump foils can have the ability to tolerate rotor misalignments and shock loading like foil gas bearings. Simulation studies on imbalance response characteristics for several <b>bearing</b> <b>shell</b> mass <b>and</b> support stiffness configurations present initial design guidelines for the application. Namely, results showed that FPTPGBs favored large <b>bearing</b> <b>shell</b> mass <b>and</b> large support stiffness, while FPTPGBs with radial compliance favored small <b>bearing</b> <b>shell</b> mass with large support stiffness...|$|R
50|$|Many {{people think}} that {{long-term}} use may induce additional wear {{due to lack of}} oil lubrication. For the crankshaft <b>bearing</b> half <b>shells</b> <b>and</b> the big end bearings this can translate into frequent high-speed rotary movement before a hydrodynamic film is established. During this phase of boundary lubrication, metal-to-metal contact can occur between the crankshaft surface and the bearing’s sliding surface. This was not an issue while the number of engine restarts totaled at what was generally understood to be a normal magnitude. However, in a vehicle with start-stop system this effect can necessitate new technological solutions to avoid premature bearing wear, depending on the driving cycle. Consequently, future engines for start-stop applications need to be designed for 250,000 to 300,000 starts. Traditional <b>bearing</b> <b>shells</b> with aluminum or copper lining show severe wear after only 100,000 cycles. In a start stop system the short stop times keep the engine and oil warm, retaining lubrication. Some implementations do not use a starter motor, eliminating concerns of starter motor wear. Mazda i-stop used in their Mazda3/Axela line (in Europe and JDM) uses combustion to restart their engine by sensing the position of the piston in the cylinder. They claim quieter and quicker engine restart within 0.35 seconds.|$|R

40|$|Bearings today {{need to be}} able to run at {{very high}} speed, {{providing}} high positional accuracy for the structure that it supports, and requiring very little or no maintenance. For this to happen, bearings must have tight tolerances and very low or zero friction during operation. This pushes many traditional contact-type bearings to their limits as they often fail due to friction, generating heat and causing wear. By comparison, existing non-contact bearings fare better because of their very low or zero friction. But some have their own problem too. For example, the fact that aerostatic bearings require an air supply means having to use a separate air compressor and connecting hoses. This makes the installation bulky. Aerodynamic and hydrodynamic bearings cannot support loads at zero speed. Both hydrodynamic and hydrostatic bearings may cause contamination to the work-pieces and the work environment because of the use of lubricating fluid. A potential solution to the above-mentioned problems is the new squeeze film air bearing. It works on the rapid squeeze action of an air film to produce separation between two metal surfaces. This has the benefit of being compact with a very simple configuration because it does not require an external pressurized air supply, can support loads at zero speed and is free of contamination. For this research, two squeeze film air journal bearings, made from material of Al 2024 - T 3 and Cu - C 101 with the same geometry, were designed. The bearing is in the shape of a round tube with three fins on the outer surface and the journal, a round rod. When excited at a certain normal mode, the <b>bearing</b> <b>shell</b> flexes with a desirable modal shape for the squeeze film action. The various modes of vibration of Al bearing were obtained from a finite-element model implemented in ANSYS. Two Modes, the 13 th and 23 rd, at the respective frequencies of 16. 320 kHz and 25. 322 kHz, were identified for further investigation by experiments with respect to the squeeze film thickness and its load-carrying capacity. For Cu bearing, the two Modes are also 13 th and 23 rd at the respective frequencies of 12. 184 kHz and 18. 459 kHz. In order to produce dynamic deformation of the bearings at their modes, a single layer piezoelectric actuator was used as a driver. The maximum stroke length and the maximum blocking force of the single layer piezoelectric actuator were determined using manual calculation and ANSYS simulation. In the coupled-field analysis, the single layer piezoelectric actuator was mounted on the outside surface of the <b>bearing</b> <b>shell</b> <b>and</b> loaded with an AC and a DC voltage in order to produce the static and dynamic deformation. For the static analysis, the maximum deformation of Al <b>bearing</b> <b>shell</b> is 0. 124 μm when the actuators are driven at the DC of 75 V. For the dynamic analysis, the actuators are driven at three levels of AC, namely 55, 65 and 75 V with a constant DC offset of 75 V and the driving frequency coincided with the modal frequency of the bearing. The maximum dynamic deformation of Al <b>bearing</b> <b>shell</b> is 3. 22 μm at Mode 13 and 2. 08 μm at Mode 23 when the actuators were driven at the AC of 75 V and the DC of 75 V. Similarly, the FEA simulation was used for analyzing Cu bearing. Furthermore, the dynamic deformation of both Al and Cu bearing at Mode 13 and 23 are validated by experiments. This research developed two theoretical models that explain the existence of a net pressure in a squeeze film for the levitation. The first model uses the ideal gas law as first approximation whilst the second uses the CFX simulation to provide a more exact explanation. In terms of the load-carrying capacity, Mode 13 was identified to be better than Mode 23 for both bearings. However, at Mode 13, Al bearing has a higher load-carrying capacity than Cu bearing. This is due to Al bearing having a higher modal frequency and amplitude. Finally, the coupled-field analysis for fluid solid interaction (FSI) was studied at both Mode 13 and 23 for Al bearing. The findings are that: a) the fluid force in the squeeze film can affect the dynamic deformation of the <b>bearing</b> <b>shell,</b> especially at high oscillation frequency, more at Mode 13 than at Mode 23 due to the relatively high pressure end-leakage in the latter; b) the dynamic deformation of the <b>bearing</b> <b>shell</b> increases with the gap clearance in a logarithmic manner at Mode 13; and c) the micron levels of gap clearance provide a damping effect on the dynamic deformation of the <b>bearing</b> <b>shell</b> at Mode 13 and at Mode 23, though much less dominant.

40|$|The thermal {{behaviour}} of a 2. 4 l {{direct injection}} diesel engine {{has been investigated}} to identify how the fuel consumption penalty associated with operation during warm–up can be minimised. A version of PROMETS (Programme for Modelling Engine Thermal Systems) was developed to support the investigations. The developments improved the representation of thermal-friction conditions in the oil circuit, extended the piston heat transfer sub-model {{to account for the}} effects of piston cooling jets and introduced a main bearing thermal-friction model to predict friction and oil film temperatures. Computational studies were complemented by an experimental investigation of the effectiveness of pre-heating the oil feed to the bearings. Results show that heat transfer from the oil film to the <b>bearings</b> <b>shells</b> <b>and</b> crankshaft journal reduces the benefit in friction savings. Other measures considered were exhaust gas heat recovery, repositioning of the oil main gallery within the block, thermal energy storage, reductions in engine thermal capacity and a novel split-EGR cooler able to cool the EGR gases and heat either the coolant or oil streams. All of the above measures were investigated in isolation, but where appropriate different measures were adopted in conjunction to achieve even greater fuel savings. During warm-up the energy available to raise fluid temperatures is small. As a result, over the New European Drive Cycle, thermal energy storage showed the greatest benefits. Given an available source of thermal energy which can be transferred to the oil over a chosen time, simulations indicate that a higher power input over a shorter period is most beneficial. This reflects the increased sensitivity of oil viscosity to temperature changes at colder temperatures which in turn means that the potential to reduce friction is highest in the first minutes after engine start up but drops rapidly hereafter. Results also show how the balance of energy transfers out of the oil changes as the engine warms up and point to the importance of oil interaction with components in the lower parts of the engine which have a large thermal capacity, such as elements supporting the main bearings, the crankshaft and the lower liner which limit the rate of temperature rise of the oil. A combination of supplementary heat introduction into the oil circuit from a thermal store and an elimination of heat losses from the oil to the lower parts of the engine resulted in a fuel consumption saving close to that achieved by starting the engine fully warm, which equates to around 6 % improvement.

40|$|Abstract: Dynamic {{pressure}} {{oil film}} bearing {{is an important}} mechanical component of the ship. With the development of large-sized ships, their dynamic pressure oil films often run at high speed and under heavy load generating high oil film pressure. In addition, due to {{the increased use of}} thin walled <b>bearing</b> <b>shell</b> with materials of low elastic modulus, the elastic deformation of the <b>bearing</b> <b>shell</b> which is in dynamic pressure oil film bearing cannot be ignored. During computation, if the effect of elastic deformation on the performance of dynamic pressure oil film bearing is ignored as is usually the practise, the difference between the theoretical and the actual results will be enormous. Therefore, this article took the effect of <b>bearing</b> <b>shell's</b> elastic deformation on bearing performance as the research target. A coupling algorithm program in Matlab is written to simulate and solve the oil film bearing dynamic pressure lubrication theory, considering elastic deformation of <b>bearing</b> <b>shell</b> {{in a way that is}} more aligned with the actual working conditions. Conducted a comparison between the above results and the results with no consideration of elastic deformation and analyzed the process and regularity of the effect of elastic deformation and other factors on the performance of oil film <b>bearing</b> <b>shell</b> in operation under dynamic lubrication. Therefore more accurate theoretical basis can be provided for the design and fault diagnose of dynamic pressure oil film bearing of the ships...|$|R

A symbol without a bar refers only to the non-dimensional quantity. radial clearance in plain bearing, clearance of the inner film when ring and journal are con-centric (m) (Fig. 1) clearance of the outer film when ring and bearing are concentric (m) (Fig. 1) C 2 /C 1, clearances ratio FixAy pa R 2, film force components (N) hi C,, film thicknesses (m) hminC 1, minimum film thickness (m) H, R, thicknesses of the ring <b>and</b> the <b>bearing</b> <b>shell</b> (m) [= 1, 21 subscripts for the inner and the outer clearance spaces, also for the ring <b>and</b> the <b>bearing</b> <b>shell</b> ambient pressure (N/m 2) p i pa, pressures (subambient) in the clearance spaces (N/m 2) pi * pa, pressures (subambient) in porous media of the ring <b>and</b> the <b>bearing</b> <b>shell</b> (N/m 2) p, pa, supply pressure (N/m 2) P, ijR 4 w 2 /C,, viscous frictional power loss (W) QpR 2 C...|$|R

40|$|In modern {{construction}} thin-shell {{structures are}} very popular {{because they can}} be easily used to make different constructive and architectural shapes. The main value of such constructions is the ability to use them as load-bearing structures and as the element of architectural image of building at the same time. Thin-shell structures allow us to solve the problems of construction rigidness and stableness, therefore it is rational to use shells in high-rise building structures. At the same time construction of high-rise buildings is connected with a number of special requirements. Disregard of those requirements can cause destruction of the building. In this research there were considered some challenges of high-rise building design on the business complex example. The comparative analysis of two various <b>bearing</b> <b>shells</b> was made. The first case was a metal grid <b>shell,</b> <b>and</b> the second was the combination of metal elements and reinforced concrete ribs. The reinforced concrete ribs (stiffeners) were used to improve the rigidness of the whole structure and to increase the bearing capacity...|$|R
