Longwall extraction commenced in 1997 in the 3. 4 m thick Lilyvale Seam and seven panels have been mined to date in the current block. The roof strata are variable and include some of the weakest longwall mining conditions in Australia. The immediate roof is predominantly a 15 to 25 MPa thinly bedded sandstone but includes weaker siltstone layers, typically 1 m to 2 m thick, with an average strength of 10 MPa. In some parts of the mining area the whole of the immediate roof appears to change laterally to a laminated siltstone with a strength as low as 2. 5 MPa. As the presence of these weaker horizons can influence the effectiveness of the primary and secondary support, as well as the roof stability on the longwall face, delineation of <b>roof</b> <b>conditions</b> forms {{a significant part of the}} strata management process. Strata are interpreted into geomechanical units from the sonic velocity logs to enable zones of similar conditions to be identified. More detailed interpretations are made along section lines for maingate development and panel hazard plans.

40|$|<b>Roof</b> <b>conditions</b> in {{coal mines}} of the {{southern}} Sydney Basin, Australia, are typically poor due {{to the effect of}} a relatively high horizontal in situ stress field (horizontal to vertical stress ratio (ơ 1 ơ 3) is approximately 2 / 1). The Permian Bulli Coal seam is mined from a portion of the basin which has undergone relatively little tectonic deformation apart from faulting and regional warping. The ơ 1 orientation acting on mine roadways is determined using the mining induced shear fractures and is comparable to results from in situ overcore measurements. The angle between ơ 1 and the mine roadway (0 sr) together with the ơ 1 magnitude and the ơ 1 /ơ 2 ratio defines the range of <b>roof</b> <b>conditions</b> to be expected in a mine roadway. A twelve point scale of stress induced roof failure has been developed to rank the severity of stress acting across the mine roadway. For a given stress field the <b>roof</b> <b>conditions</b> expected over the range of Osr is defined by a Roof Failure curve. A number of Roof Failure Curves are able to define <b>roof</b> <b>conditions</b> for a varying stress field. The distribution of Roof Failure Curves represents the relative changes in stress field intensity across the mapped area. Mapping techniques are able to show the variability of both relative stress field intensity and lateral stress field orientation. Successful management of the in situ stress effects in mine development drivages and around longwall blocks is crucial to the economic viability of coal mines in the southern Sydney Basin. To further understand the origin of the in situ stress field a technique was developed to measure strain anisotropy in the coal maceral vitrinite. Vitrinite mean maximum reflectance (Ŕo max), using oil immersion, was measured from oriented sections normal to bedding and results indicate that the vitrinite in medium volatile bituminous coals has biaxial optical properties.

Paleochannels in the study mine consist of sandstone and/or siltstone and affect the Pittsburgh Coalbed through erosion and/or differential compaction. Differentially compacted sediments within and adjacent to channel deposits caused slip planes, faults, clay-dike faults, clastic dikes (clay veins), coalbed rolls, and slumped structures. Paleochannels can be predicted by recognizing these features and associated sediments, which allows for modification of long-and short-term mine planning and development.

However, the resolution of early satellite imagery was not sufficient to provide useful spatial features. The situation is changing with the advent of very-high-spatial-resolution (VHR) imaging sensors. This change makes it possible to use computer vision techniques to perform analysis of man-made structures. Meanwhile, the development of multi-view imaging techniques allows the generation of accurate point clouds as ancillary knowledge. This dissertation aims at developing computer vision and machine learning algorithms for high resolution aerial imagery analysis in the context of application problems including debris detection, building detection and <b>roof</b> <b>condition</b> assessment. High resolution aerial imagery and point clouds were provided by Pictometry International for this study. Debris detection after natural disasters such as tornadoes, hurricanes or tsunamis, is needed for effective debris removal and allocation of limited resources. Significant advances in aerial image acquisition have greatly enabled the possibilities for rapid and automated detection of debris. In this dissertation, a robust debris detection algorithm is proposed. Large scale aerial images are partitioned into homogeneous regions by interactive segmentation. Debris areas are identified based on extracted texture features. Robust building detection is another important part of high resolution aerial imagery understanding. This dissertation develops a 3 D scene classification algorithm for building detection using point clouds derived from multi-view imagery. Point clouds are divided into point clusters using Euclidean clustering. Individual point clusters are identified based on extracted spectral and 3 D structural features. The inspection of <b>roof</b> <b>condition</b> is an important step in damage claim processing in the insurance industry. Automated <b>roof</b> <b>condition</b> assessment from remotely sensed images is proposed in this dissertation. Initially, texture classification and a bag-of-words model were applied to assess the <b>roof</b> <b>condition</b> using features derived from the whole rooftop. However, considering the complexity of residential rooftop, a more sophisticated method is proposed to divide the task into two stages: 1) roof segmentation, followed by 2) classification of segmented roof regions. Deep learning techniques are investigated for both segmentation and classification. A deep learned feature is proposed and applied in a region merging segmentation algorithm. A fine-tuned deep network is adopted for roof segment classification and found to achieve higher accuracy than traditional methods using hand-crafted features. Contributions of this study include the development of algorithms for debris detection using 2 D images and building detection using 3 D point clouds. For <b>roof</b> <b>condition</b> assessment, the solutions to this problem are explored in two directions: features derived from the whole rooftop and features extracted from each roof segments. Through our research, roof segmentation followed by segments classification was found to be a more promising method and the workflow processing developed and tested.

The coal-bearing Permian Vryheid Formation of the Ecca Group (Karoo Supergroup) was {{investigated}} at New Denmark Colliery, {{situated in the}} north east section of the Karoo Basin, South Africa. The lithostratigraphy of the sequence is {{defined in terms of}} conventional lithostratigraphic terminology but also by applying detailed genetic stratigraphic schemes that have previously been proposed for the adjacent coalfields. The succession is divided up into depositional sequences named after the underlying and overlying coal seams, the No. 2, 3, 4 and 5 seam sequences. The sedimentary succession was divided up into five facies, namely: conglomerate facies, sandstone facies, interlaminated sandstone-siltstone facies, siltstone facies and coal facies. These were interpreted hydrodynamically. Facies assemblages were then interpreted palaeoenvironmentally. Glacial, fluvial, deltaic and transgressive marine sequences were responsible for forming this sedimentary succession. Attention was then focussed on the main economic No. 4 seam, which is mined underground at the colliery. Detailed subsurface geological cross-sections, core sequences and isopach maps of the No. 4 seam coal and the lithologies above, were used to determine specific aspects of the depositional environment that could contribute to unstable <b>roof</b> <b>conditions</b> above No. 4 seam. Coarsening-upward deltaic cycles, fining-upward bedload fluvial cycles, glauconite sandstone marine transgressions and crevasse-splay deposits are recognized in the overlying strata. Poor <b>roof</b> <b>conditions</b> occur parallel to palaeochannel margins because the interbedded channel sandstone and adjacent flood plain argillites cause collapsing along bedding plane surfaces. Rider coals overlying thin crevasse-splay sequences in close proximity to the No. 4 seam, create {{one of the most serious}} roof conditions; complete collapse occurs along the rider coal contact with the underlying splay deposits. Differential compaction of mudrock/shale/siltstone over more competent sandstone causes slickensided surfaces that weaken the roof lithologies.

40|$|Historically, {{coal miners}} {{have known that}} roof shales can {{deteriorate}} in contact with humid mine air, causing massive roof falls and injuries from falling rock. It is critical to recognize rocks prone to weathering and to adequately support these rocks {{in order to ensure}} the long-term stability of the openings. In a recent study, NIOSH has used a wet/dry cycling test to determine the moisture sensitivity of over 800 specimens of roof rock from 25 U. S. coal mines. Fireclays and some gray shales are the most moisture-sensitive. Rocks with disturbed bedding, in contrast to flat-bedded rocks, are also more sensitive to water. Black shales are relatively un-reactive to moisture and serve to protect more reactive gray shales above.

These loose rocks that injure miners are usually just a few inches thick, but on average weigh 280 pounds. NIOSH has found that most rock fall injuries can be prevented by installing roof screen during the bolting cycle. Roof screen is a sheet made of steel wires in a grid pattern. When screen is bolted up against the mine roof, it provides far more coverage than any common surface control used in the mines today. Because more mine roof is covered, there is less chance that a rock will fall and injure a miner.

40|$|A {{room and}} pillar coal {{operation}} in central Pennsylvania was experiencing roof cutters and long running roof falls caused by high horizontal stresses. The <b>roof</b> <b>conditions</b> created hazards for the miners, and caused several production panels to be abandoned prematurely. The mine requested assistance from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in applying the "advance and relieve" mining to reduce the affects of the horizontal stress during panel development. The "advance and relieve" plan that was developed called for removing a pillar {{on one side of}} the panel as it was being advanced, thus creating a cave. The caving then relieved a portion of the horizontal stress across the panel. Because the horizontal stress direction is key to the success of this method, stress mapping as well as mining experience was used to establish the direction of the horizontal stress. Subsequent field measurements provided an estimate of the stress magnitude. Three panels were mined using this technique, and good <b>roof</b> <b>conditions</b> were achieved in all these panels. Instrumentation was used to monitor the stress changes in the roof created by the cave. Stress relief of over 1, 000 psi was measured 120 ft from the cave and to depths of 20 ft into the roof.

Growing media must be chosen in accordance with load bearing capacities of structures and water requirements of the plant material. Plant species {{must be able to}} thrive in the climate of the green roof and withstand a green roof’s harsh environment. The objectives of this research were: (1) to determine which of three extensive green roof growing media support the most growth of Sedum, a proven extensive green roof plant genus; and (2) to determine which of four plant groups provides the most media coverage under extensive green <b>roof</b> <b>conditions.</b> Sedum growing in a granular growing media blend with higher organic matter and larger particles provided more coverage than Sedum growing in a medium with smaller particles with lower organic matter and an experimental foam medium.

NIOSH has found that most rock fall injuries can be prevented by installing roof screen during the bolting cycle. Roof screen is a sheet made of steel wires in a grid pattern. When screen is bolted up against the mine roof, it provides far more coverage than any common surface control used in the mines today. Because more mine roof is covered, there is less chance that a rock will fall and injure a miner. The facts about roof screen are shown in the new NIOSH video entitled "Make It Safer With Roof Screen. " Using extensive underground footage, the 7 -minute video shows how well screen keeps loose rock from falling in difficult <b>roof</b> <b>conditions.</b> Techniques for installing screen from both outside-controlled and walk-thru roof bolting machines are shown. The video also provides safe handling tips, best practices, and information about machine technology that can greatly improve material handling. An instructional booklet supplements the video with additional information.
