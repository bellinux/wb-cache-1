5000|$|On 25 November 1919, after {{fulfilling}} {{requirements of}} playing field size (90m x 45m) and suitable enclosures, the Lombardi Regional Committee officially endorsed US Codogno {{to the regional}} championship. Despite this endorsement, {{a number of problems}} arose. US Codogno was pitted against top level teams with advanced technical skills. An exchange of players with AC Fanfulla was unbalanced. Young players coming through the ranks who may have improved US Codogno's game, such as Mariano Tansini Arcari and the like, moved on to join more advanced teams. In some circumstances, US Codogno could not field a team. Progression to a higher division at this stage was impossible. US Codogno was included in the little-known Fourth Division. In addition, there was a legal dispute over {{the nature of the relationship}} between clubs and the FIGC.Nevertheless, by the end of the 1927 - 1928 season, when the FIGC had created a Series A and a Series <b>B,</b> <b>US</b> Codongo was promoted to part of the First Division (now [...] "Serie C1"). Since then, their success and level of playing has been variable. (See table below).|$|E

Duty aboard U.S. Navy, U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Navy Military Sealift Command, NOAA vessels, or aboard Army leased or foreign and non-military vessels may also qualify if soldiers serving on those vessels have a formally assigned primary mission that is accomplished underway, are in an active status, and are approved for creditable sea service by the Career Sea Pay Office. The Chief of the Marine Qualification Division is the approval authority for award of the ASDR to eligible service members. The ASDR may be awarded retroactively to those personnel who were credited with qualifying service, as defined in regulations, after August 1, 1952. [...] Subsequent awards are authorized upon completion of an additional two years of cumulative sea duty under qualifying conditions.|$|E

30|$|Applying Bond et al.’s [10] {{estimate}} for the BC GWP, {{we find that}} 51 [*]~[*] 175 Gg/year of BC emission reduction amounts to 0.046 billion - 0.159 billion carbon credits.
