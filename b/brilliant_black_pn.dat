40|$|Allosteric binding {{sites on}} the {{adenosine}} receptor family represent potential therapeutic targets {{for a number of}} conditions involving metabolic stress. This study has identified <b>Brilliant</b> <b>Black</b> BN as a novel allosteric modulator of the adenosine A 1 and A 3 receptors. In addition to being a food dye and pharmaceutical excipient, <b>Brilliant</b> <b>Black</b> BN is commonly used within calcium mobilization assays to quench extracellular fluorescence. <b>Brilliant</b> <b>Black</b> BN (5 – 500 μM) had no significant effect on the calcium mobilization stimulated by the nonselective adenosine receptor agonist 5 ′-(N-ethylcarboxamido) adenosine in Chinese hamster ovary cells stably transfected with the human adenosine A 1 or A 3 receptor. Likewise, calcium mobilization and radioligand binding assays found that <b>Brilliant</b> <b>Black</b> BN (5 – 500 μM) did not significantly influence the antagonism mediated by 8 -cyclopentyl- 1, 3 -dipropylxanthine (100 nM) at the A 1 receptor. In contrast, the affinity of N-[9 -chloro- 2 -(2 -furanyl) [1, 2, 4]-triazolo[1, 5 -c]quinazolin- 5 -yl]benzene acetamide (MRS 1220) at the A 3 receptor and xanthine amine congener (XAC) and XAC-X-BY 630 at the A 1 and A 3 receptors was significantly decreased in the presence of 500 μM <b>Brilliant</b> <b>Black</b> BN. A reduction in XAC potency at the A 1 and A 3 receptor was achieved within 1 min of <b>Brilliant</b> <b>Black</b> BN addition, despite receptors having been pre-equilibrated with antagonist. Dissociation kinetics of the fluorescent XAC derivative, XAC-X-BY 630, revealed that the decrease in affinity is probably due to a significant increase in dissociation rate of the antagonist in the presence of <b>Brilliant</b> <b>Black</b> BN. Taken together, these results suggest that <b>Brilliant</b> <b>Black</b> BN can act allosterically to modify ligand affinity at A 1 and A 3 receptors...|$|R

40|$|In this work, {{competitive}} adsorption of four food dyes (Sunset Yellow, Allura Red, tartrazine, and <b>Brilliant</b> <b>Black)</b> by heated pine wood is studied using multivariate calibration. Partial {{least squares}} PLS 1 and principal component regression PCR are effectively applied for simultaneous determination of food dyes with high accuracy (96. 2 – 103. 6 %) and low relative prediction error (2. 3 – 6. 9 %). Using multivariate calibration, the dyes are detected down to 0. 11, 0. 15, 0. 24, and 0. 29 mg L− 1. The removal of dyes increased at acidic solution and H-bonding {{is the main}} controlling mechanism. The maximum removal capacities (according to Langmuir model) are 3. 4, 2. 5, 4. 8, and 7. 1 mg g− 1 for tartrazine, <b>Brilliant</b> <b>Black,</b> Allura Red, and Sunset Yellow, respectively, at pH 2. 0 and 25 °C. The competition factors (CFs) are estimated from the isotherms to assess the degree of competition between dyes toward the surface. The CFs are 0. 64, 0. 66, 0. 77, and 0. 77 for <b>Brilliant</b> <b>Black,</b> Allura Red, Sunset Yellow, and tartrazine, respectively. Accordingly, <b>Brilliant</b> <b>Black</b> is the most affected dye while Sunset Yellow and tartrazine are the least affected in multi-solute adsorption.

40|$|The {{influence}} of the concentration of ascorbic acid on some azo food colorant (<b>Brilliant</b> <b>Black</b> BN, <b>Brilliant</b> Blue FCF, Chinoline Yellow, Indigotine, Patent Blue V and Tartazine) degradation in the solution has been studied. Rate constant (k), time of colorant half-life (t 1 / 2), {{as well as the}} type of the kinetic reaction have been determined. The colorants and the ascorbic acid have been determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with diode array detector (DAD) and UV-VIS spectrometry. It was found that the higher concentration of ascorbic acid leads to the higher rate constant and lower colorants half-life. The values of the rate constants are 2. 50 – 4. 25 times higher when the colorant degradation was run in the presence of 500 mg/L of ascorbic acid than {{in the case of the}} presence of 100 mg/L ascorbic acid for Brilliant Blue FCF, Chinoline Yellow, Patent Blue V and Tartazine. From the other side, the degradation of <b>Brilliant</b> <b>Black</b> BN and Indigotine is very fast with a total degradation for 6 – 9 days. Therefore, the rate constants for those two food colorants are much higher than for the other investigated colorants. According to the linearity of the kinetics curves (ln(c/co) v. s. time) it appeared to be first order kinetics for the interval up to 4 days.
