40|$|Abstract. In this study, {{a type of}} non-silicon oxygen <b>bleaching</b> {{stabilizer}} {{was used}} to cotton fabric in the hydrogen peroxide <b>bleaching</b> process. This type of novel non-silicon oxygen <b>bleaching</b> stabilizer was prepared mainly with ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) and magnesium chloride. The results showed that adding the non-silicon oxygen <b>bleaching</b> stabilizer into the <b>bleaching</b> solution obviously decreased the hydrogen peroxide decomposition rate and improved the fabric whiteness. Optimal conditions was found as follow: non-silicon oxygen <b>bleaching</b> stabilizer 4. 5 g/l; <b>bleaching</b> temperature 75 - 85 ℃; pH of <b>bleaching</b> liquid 11; <b>bleaching</b> time 40 - 45 min.

5|$|The Amylostereaceae {{are white}} rot pathogens. They {{disintegrate}} the lignin {{of the host}} wood, whereby the infested wood parts become less stable and take a fibrous structure. The wood bleaches as fungal enzymes break down and remove the brown-pigmented lignin. The distribution in wood takes place mainly along the transport channels in the xylem. If the wood is crosscut, the red rot is vertically positioned, on which <b>bleached,</b> infested areas contrast with intact wood. Symptoms of infestion by the symbiotic partner—wood wasps—include circular exit holes in the crust and acute stress through dryness, common in hanging, falling or tanning needles.|$|E
5|$|The {{photosensitivity}} of {{the silver}} halides allowed for their use in traditional photography, although digital photography, which does not use silver, is now dominant. The photosensitive emulsion used in black-and-white photography is a suspension of silver halide crystals in gelatin, possibly mixed in with some noble metal compounds for improved photosensitivity, developing, and tuning. Colour photography requires the addition of special dye components and sensitisers, so that the initial black-and-white silver image couples with a different dye component. The original silver images are <b>bleached</b> off and the silver is then recovered and recycled. Silver nitrate is the starting material in all cases.|$|E

Student t test showed that the laser <b>bleaching</b> group significantly outperformed the power <b>bleaching</b> group in changing ?E (p= 0. 977). Similarly, while comparing the groups in changing ?L, the laser <b>bleaching</b> group indicated significantly superior results (p= 0. 953). Statistical data from student t test while comparing the groups in changing the parameter of yellowness indicated that samples in laser <b>bleaching</b> group underwent a more significant reduction than power-bleached samples (p= 0. 85). Correspondingly, changes in whiteness were statistically tested through student t test, showing that laser <b>bleaching</b> technique increased whiteness of the samples significantly more than those treated by power <b>bleaching</b> (p= 0. 965). The digital color evaluation data was in accordance with spectrophotometry and showed that laser <b>bleaching</b> outperformed power <b>bleaching</b> technique.

Although Jackson, a black man, was diagnosed with the skin disorder vitiligo, which results in white patches on the skin, and said that he had not purposely <b>bleached</b> his skin but had used makeup to even out his skin tone, it was also widely suggested that his lighter skin tone was partly due to skin bleaching.|$|E
5|$|Stern shot Changeling in {{anamorphic}} format on {{35mm film}} using Kodak Vision 500T 5279 film stock. The film was shot on Panavision cameras and C-Series lenses. Due {{to the large}} number of sets, the lighting rigs were more extensive than on other Eastwood productions. The crew made several ceilings from <b>bleached</b> muslin tiles. Stern lit the tiles from above to produce a soft, warm light that was intended to evoke the period through tones close to antique and sepia. The crew segregated the tiles using fire safety fabric Duvatyn to prevent light spilling onto neighboring clusters. The key light was generally softer to match the warm tones given off by the toplights. Stern used stronger skypans—more intense than is commonly used for key lighting—to reduce contrasts when applying daytime rain effects, as a single light source tended to produce harder shadows.|$|E

5|$|Amanita nothofagi {{mushrooms}} can {{be confused}} with A.australis if the warts have been washed off and the colour has been <b>bleached.</b> A reliable method to distinguish the two is to check {{for the presence of}} clamp connections at the bases of the basidia, which are present in A.australis and absent from A.nothofagi. Ridley notes that the type collection was made with a dark grey specimen, and later collectors who found browner specimens have had difficulty in correctly identifying the species. Paler specimens resemble A.excelsa, which led some to incorrectly believe that the species occurs in New Zealand. Amanita luteofusca is also similar in appearance, spore size, amyloid reaction, and lack of clamp connections in the basidia. It is distinguished from A.nothofagi largely on the basis of colour—it is a greyish-brown to yellowish-grey brown that fades to pinkish-buff as it gets older. Tulloss suggests that the resemblance of a number of species from Australasia and Chile which lack brightly coloured fruit bodies and share similar greyish to brownish rings and volvas may indicate that they share Gondwanan ancestors.|$|E

5|$|Many other {{languages}} of the Mainland Southeast Asia linguistic area exhibit similar classifier systems, leading to {{speculation about the}} origins of the Chinese system. Ancient classifier-like constructions, which used a repeated noun rather than a special classifier, are attested in Old Chinese as early as 1400 BCE, but true classifiers did not appear in these phrases until much later. Originally, classifiers and numbers came after the noun rather than before, and probably moved before the noun sometime after 500 BCE. The use of classifiers did not become a mandatory part of Old Chinese grammar until around 1100 CE. Some nouns became associated with specific classifiers earlier than others, the earliest probably being nouns that signified culturally valued items such as horses and poems.

Yet Chinese hempen paper of the Western Han and early Eastern Han eras was of a coarse quality and used primarily as wrapping paper. The papermaking process was not formally introduced until the Eastern Han court eunuch Cai Lun (50–121 CE) created a process in 105 CE where mulberry tree bark, hemp, old linens, and fish nets were boiled together to make a pulp that was pounded, stirred in water, and then dunked with a wooden sieve containing a reed mat that was shaken, dried, and <b>bleached</b> into sheets of paper. The oldest known piece of paper with writing on it comes from the ruins of a Chinese watchtower at Tsakhortei, Alxa League, Inner Mongolia, dated precisely 110 CE when the Han garrison abandoned the area following a nomadic Xiongnu attack.

The earliest known piece of paper with writing on it was discovered in the ruins of a Chinese watchtower at Tsakhortei, Alxa League, where Han Dynasty troops had deserted their position in AD 110 following a Xiongnu attack. In the paper making process established by Cai in 105, a boiled mixture of mulberry tree bark, hemp, old linens and fish nets created a pulp that was pounded into paste and stirred with water; a wooden frame sieve with a mat of sewn reeds was then dunked into the mixture, which was then shaken and then dried into sheets of paper that were <b>bleached</b> under the exposure of sunlight; K.S.
