5|$|Actinium metal has <b>been</b> <b>prepared</b> by the {{reduction}} of actinium fluoride with lithium vapor in vacuum at a temperature between 1100 and 1300°C. Higher temperatures resulted in evaporation of the product and lower ones lead to an incomplete transformation. Lithium was chosen among other alkali metals because its fluoride is most volatile.|$|E

5|$|Fermium is a {{synthetic}} element with symbol Fm and atomic number 100. It {{is a member}} of the actinide series. It is the heaviest element that can be formed by neutron bombardment of lighter elements, and hence the last element that can be prepared in macroscopic quantities, although pure fermium metal has not yet <b>been</b> <b>prepared.</b> A total of 19 isotopes are known, with 257Fm being the longest-lived with a half-life of 100.5 days.|$|E

5|$|Many organosodium {{compounds}} have <b>been</b> <b>prepared.</b> Because of {{the high}} polarity of the C-Na bonds, they behave like sources of carbanions (salts with organic anions). Some well known derivatives include sodium cyclopentadienide (NaC5H5) and trityl sodium ((C6H5)3CNa). Because of the large size and very low polarising power of the Na+ cation, it can stabilize large, aromatic, polarisable radical anions, such as in sodium naphthalenide, Na+−, a strong reducing agent.|$|E
5|$|A {{committee}} {{was set up}} in October 1838 to investigate the viability of a causeway at the site. On 16 February 1839 plans which had <b>been</b> <b>prepared</b> by Roe were submitted by the committee's chairman to Henry Trigg, the Superintendent of Public Works. Trigg called for other plans and prepared estimates. At a meeting of the committee on 27 February 1839, Trigg submitted a plan designed by Major Frederick Irwin, which was estimated to cost £2,300. The committee cut the estimated figure to £1,800, and waited for Governor Hutt to specify how much could be funded by the government.|$|E

5|$|After a long {{spell of}} hot and dry weather through mid-1666, what later {{became known as}} the Great Fire of London started on 2 September 1666 in a bakehouse on Pudding Lane. Fanned by a strong easterly wind and fed by {{stockpiles}} of wood and fuel that had <b>been</b> <b>prepared</b> for the coming colder months, the fire eventually consumed about 13,200 houses and 87 churches, including St Paul's Cathedral. Charles and his brother James joined and directed the fire-fighting effort.

5|$|After {{this sudden}} spate of activity, Smoke Imix {{continued}} to rule until almost {{the end of}} the 7thcentury; he dedicated another nine known monuments and made important changes to the architecture of Copán, including the construction of Structure2, which closes the northern side of the Great Plaza, and a new version of Temple26, nicknamed Chorcha. Smoke Imix ruled Copán for 67years and died on 15June 695 at the age of 79, an age that was so distinguished that it is used to identify him in place of his name on AltarQ. His tomb had already <b>been</b> <b>prepared</b> in the Chorcha phase of Temple26 and he was buried just two days after his death.|$|E
5|$|All {{four main}} Einsatzgruppen {{took part in}} mass shootings {{from the early days}} of the war. Initially the targets were adult Jewish men, but by August the net had been widened to include women, children, and the elderly—the entire Jewish population. Initially there was a semblance of {{legality}} given to the shootings, with trumped-up charges being read out (arson, sabotage, black marketeering, or refusal to work, for example) and victims being killed by a firing squad. As this method proved too slow, the Einsatzkommandos began to take their victims out in larger groups and shot them next to, or even inside, mass graves that had <b>been</b> <b>prepared.</b> Some Einsatzkommandos started to use automatic weapons, with survivors being killed with a pistol shot.|$|E
