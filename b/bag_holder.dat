40|$|The {{contribution}} summarises a Master thesis in Industrial Design Engineering, {{carried out}} at Chalmers University of Technology {{in the second half}} of 2007 in collaboration with Semcon Sweden AB and Volvo Cars Corporation. In the beginning of this thesis an array of questions was put together. The most significant ones were: Is there a need among car owners of having a grocery <b>bag</b> <b>holder</b> in the car? As well as: Could the <b>bag</b> <b>holder</b> be totally self-instructing? Through research based upon gathered information this thesis tries to answer these and other raised questions. The information was gathered using, among other methods, literature and user studies, analyses of existing <b>bag</b> <b>holder</b> used by other brands, as well as through user interviews and observations. When this information had been put together, focus was shifted on to developing trough the use of various design methods, focus groups and engineering of concept models. A need among users could be found and the project was therefore continued towards a functional prototype. This prototype was designed using the Computer Aided Design (CAD) tool Catia V 5 and then engineered using rapid prototyping (SLS-technology). A critical review has been held throughout the project and work has been pushed forward through discussions within the group, with instructors from Chalmers, with Semcon and Volvo personnel as well as with contacts from other companies...|$|E

"To combat {{the possibility of}} transmission of malaria from returning servicemen to the civilian population, especially in the traditionally endemic malaria areas in the South, an emergency program directed against adult mosquitoes was initiated by the U. S. Public Health Service during the 1945 malaria season. The activity is called the Extended Malalaria Control Program and consists principally {{of the use of}} DDT as a residual spray on the interior of houses. This Extended Program is so named to distinguish it from the Malaria Control in War Areas Program which was carried on during the war to protect MILITARY personnel in this country from CIVILIAN malaria and which was the exact opposite aim of the Extended Program. In the Extended Malaria Control Program during the calendar year 1945 approximately 400, 000 houses were sprayed one or more times in 119 counties of 13 states, and expanded so that approximately 750, 000 houses were sprayed one or more times in 266 counties of 13 states during 1946. Figure 1 shows a map of all areas of operations in 1946. The Extended Program is based on results of laboratory work which demonstrated the residual effect of DDT and its lethal action against adult mosquitoes.

40|$|Today, {{most major}} grocery stores in Sweden offer self {{checkout}} services. The service allows customers to seamlessly use a mobile scanning unit {{to scan the}} items directly inside the store, while the groceries can be packed into grocery bags on an ongoing basis. The process offers customers direct control over the actual cost while saving time. The system works smoothly for customers who purchase large quantities of food and takes help of a shopping cart with a holder for the scanning unit. For those customers visiting the store to buy a smaller quantity of groceries that can fit in a standard plastic grocery bag and is not {{in need of a}} big basket, major flaws are found in the system. In these self checkout process situations arise where the customer’s hands is not sufficient to operate the scanning unit, shopping basket, bag and products simultaneously. This observation is the basis for this thesis and the focus has thus fallen to explore possibilities for improving the situation for these customers. The project began with contacting Nordiska Plast AB, a leading provider of shopping baskets and a specialist in injection molded plastic products. After having presented the project’s purpose it was decided that a collaboration would begin, where Nordiska Plast agreed to help with advice and guidance during the project. With this cooperation it was decided that the project’s results would include a physical plastic product intended to be produced by Nordiska Plast. The development was started with an extensive collection of information. As the project’s purpose and goal was to develop a product that solves the problem in a new way the market was examined for existing solutions, in order to evaluate and to niche the product away from those. After the initial data collection the process went into the creative concept phase, where a variety of creative methods and workshop resulted in three comprehensive solution principles. These principles was presented to Nordiska Plast, in consultation with the CEO Karl Tibratt it was decided to move forward with one of the solution principles. Then began a new round of creative methods that ultimately resulted in 24 concepts ideas. These 24 ideas formed the basis of four computer-modeled concept’s based on a tight integration with the scanning device. The concepts were designed to provide different look and feel, but with a distinct function and durability. The four concepts was rendered to help decide which concept’s that would be choosen for prototype building. Two concepts were considered to be more interesting, therefore, plastic prototypes using a 3 D printer was produced in order to evaluate the shape and feel in real life. At this stage, it became very clear which concept that eventually would be selected as the final concept. The result of this work is a carrying handle called Multigreppet, the idea behind the concept is that the scan device should be integrated into the carrying handle, while carrier bag is hung on the grip’s <b>bag</b> <b>holder.</b> It is a simple plastic product that solves the main problem in a very advantageous manner that makes it possible to easily carry the scaning unit and bag in one hand, while the customer gets a hand free to pick items that can easily be placed into the bag.

Rather than directing all <b>bag</b> <b>holders</b> to one security screening line, security officials allowed the lines to be clogged, preventing many people from entering the secured area to view/hear President Bush and Vice-President Cheney.

People’s association and positive or negative reactions to certain colours, forms and orientations are aspects of design which have not been extensively studied by most designers. From the larger purview of EP, this paper focuses {{on the issues of}} density and crowding, specifically the impact of crowding on urban female commuters travelling in the ladies compartment of Mumbai Local Trains. The paper looks at crowding and stimulus in local trains by studying the environment and design evolution of the train compartment and constructive coping mechanisms sought by the commuters. The research follows a participative approach where the conclusions are drawn post interaction with commuters. Different aspects of train design like, seating, racks and <b>bag</b> <b>holders,</b> GPS announcements, etc. are highlighted and alternatives (some suggested by the commuters) are expressed. The study delves on seminal theories in crowding psychology to support the conclusions. The paper also advocates the importance of early intervention and need for study of environmental psychology in the pedagogy of architecture...|$|R
