5|$|By {{the time}} the United States of America entered the war in 1917—three {{years after the first}} shots were fired—several Americans had already gone to fight as pilots by joining the Royal Flying Corps. These pilots {{reported}} to Canada, and after flight training were sent to fight as officers in the <b>British</b> <b>military.</b>|$|E
5|$|Imports to England {{during the}} inter-war years were chiefly from areas of <b>British</b> <b>military</b> {{influence}} and commerce: Bahrain, Egypt, Transjordan, and Iraq.

Despite substantial populations of Salukis in Germany, the Netherlands, and Sweden, none of these were imported to England.|$|E

5|$|RAF Chinooks {{have been}} widely {{deployed}} in support of <b>British</b> <b>military</b> engagements, serving their first wartime role in Operation Corporate, the Falklands War, in 1982. Chinooks were used in Operation Granby in the 1991 Gulf War, attached to large peace-keeping commitments in the Balkans, the continued British presence in Afghanistan, and in Operation Telic in the 2003 Iraq War. They provide routine supply and support missions to the <b>British</b> <b>military,</b> notably in Operation Banner in Northern Ireland. The helicopter has also been of use in military humanitarian missions and the extraction of civilians from warzones, such as the evacuation of Sierra Leone in 2000, and the evacuation from Lebanon in 2006.|$|E
5|$|The Belgian {{army had}} {{traditionally}} used French-style uniforms, {{along with the}} characteristic Adrian helmet, meaning that from the First World War both armies had a very similar appearance. After the war, influenced by the Free Belgians and by <b>British</b> <b>military</b> advisors, the Belgian military instead adopted British-style uniforms and British-produced equipment.|$|E

The new military's first {{commander}} was Colonel Daud Abdulle Hirsi, a former officer in the <b>British</b> <b>military</b> administration's police force, the Somalia Gendarmerie. Officers were trained in the United Kingdom, Egypt and Italy. Despite {{the social and economic}} benefits associated with military service, the armed forces began to suffer chronic manpower shortages only a few years after independence.|$|E
5|$|After the Japanese {{surrender}} in September 1945, Lieutenant-Colonel G. Archey of the <b>British</b> <b>Military</b> Administration {{took over}} Directorship of the Library and museum on 6 September. The Library only suffered minimal losses and damages {{during the three}} and a half years of Japanese Occupation, as the Japanese preserved the Library well due to its respected reputation in academia. Compared to other libraries in Malaya which lost nearly half of their collections, only some 500 reference books were looted according to a stocktake done after the war.|$|E
5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of World War II in September 1939, Edward {{was assigned to the}} <b>British</b> <b>Military</b> Mission in France.

5|$|Angered by the French surrender, {{and unhappy}} with British {{policies}} that affected them, an Ottawa chief named Pontiac organized 18 Native American tribes that attacked <b>British</b> <b>military</b> and civilian settlements beginning in April 1763. The tribes captured eight British forts {{and forced the}} evacuation of two more. General Amherst ordered the 17th to Albany in June 1763 to assist in combating the outbreak of hostilities.|$|E
5|$|Beato, who {{had covered}} {{military}} operations in India and China, was probably attracted by {{the news of the}} annexation. While he arrived in Burma after the main military operations ended, he would still get {{to see more of the}} action, as the annexation by the British led to an insurgency which lasted for the following decade. This allowed Beato to take a number of pictures of <b>British</b> <b>military</b> in operations or at the Royal Palace, Mandalay, as well as insurgency soldiers and prisoners.|$|E
5|$|<b>British</b> <b>military</b> leadership, {{which had}} been decisive up to Brock's death, {{suffered}} a blow with his loss. His direct successor, Major-General Sheaffe, although successful in his approach at Queenston Heights, {{was never able to}} live up to Brock's reputation. He was criticised by many, including John Strachan, for his retreat at the Battle of York, and was shortly after recalled to England, where he continued a successful, if not brilliant, military career.|$|E
