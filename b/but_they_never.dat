5|$|After another {{stint in}} Japan, Sing {{returned}} to Stampede Wrestling in late 1987 and was renamed Rhonda Singh by Stu Hart, {{the owner of}} the company. There were plans to pair her with Gama Singh, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>never</b> came to fruition. During 1987, she was named their first Women's Champion because she had defeated Wendi Richter prior to returning to Stampede. She held the title until September 22, 1988, when she lost to Chigusa Nagayo.|$|E
5|$|Watie {{formed the}} Cherokee Mounted Rifles. He was a guerrilla fighter {{commanding}} Cherokee, Seminole, Creek, and Osage Indian soldiers. They earned a notorious reputation for their bold and brave fighting. Yearly, Federal troops {{all over the}} western United States hunted for Watie, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>never</b> captured him. He surrendered on June 23 at Fort Towson, in the Choctaw Nations area at the village of Doaksville (now a ghost town) of the Indian Territory, being the last Confederate general to surrender in the American Civil War.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} sold to the Peruvian Navy in 1912, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>never</b> paid the last two {{installments}} and the ship remained inactive at Brest during World War I. The French agreed to take the ship back in 1917, keeping the money already paid, and they sold her in 1918 to a Belgian shipping company that converted her into a freighter. Renamed Péruvier, the ship's engines broke down {{and she had to}} be towed to her destination where part of her cargo of coal was discovered to be on fire during her maiden voyage as a merchant vessel in 1920. Deemed uneconomical to repair, Péruvier was towed to Antwerp and later scrapped in 1923.|$|E

5|$|Under the {{existing}} {{command and control}} arrangement between the CIA, the AIRA, and the Seventh Air Force, the Air Force wielded little actual control over air support. In order to increase its dominance, {{a reduction in the}} role of the Raven FACS was called for. Instead, greater use was to be made of Nail FACs from Nakhon Phanom's 23rd Tactical Air Support Squadron which had recently begun transitioning to OV-10 Bronco aircraft. In the end, the Nails made increasing appearances over Military Region 2, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>never</b> seriously encroached on the role of the Ravens.|$|E
5|$|Groups {{are often}} based on a single European {{political}} party such as the socialist group (before 2009). However, they can, like the liberal group, include more than one European party as well as national parties and independents. For a group to be recognised, it needs 25 MEPs from seven different countries. Once recognised, groups receive financial subsidies from the parliament and guaranteed seats on committees, creating an incentive {{for the formation of}} groups. However, some controversy occurred with the establishment of the short-lived Identity, Tradition, Sovereignty (ITS) due to its ideology; the members of the group were far-right, so there were concerns about public funds going towards such a group. There were attempts to change the rules to block the formation of ITS, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>never</b> came to fruition. The group was, however, blocked from gaining leading positions on committees— traditionally (by agreement, not a rule) shared among all parties. When this group engaged in infighting, leading to the withdrawal of some members, its size fell below the threshold for recognition causing its collapse.|$|E

25|$|The {{struggle}} {{continued in}} areas of the Deccan and Hyderabad such as Arcot, Wandewash, Tanjore and Cuddalore, culminating in 1761 when Col. Eyre Coote defeated a French garrison under de Lally, supported by Hyder Ali at Pondicherry. The French were returned Pondicherry in 1763 by way of the Treaty of Paris <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>never</b> again regained their former stature in India. The British would, in effect, emerge as rulers of the subcontinent in subsequent years.|$|E
25|$|The {{finding of}} good Gold in the Mines could {{sometimes}} cause the Club to renege on their obligations. On one occasion in the 1890s, {{a party of}} gentlemen from the Croydon Club came riding into town and claimed that they had arranged a match against the Warrandyte Club {{and there was no}} one to play them. They rode off in a huff. The Warrandyte Club apologised to them in the local press, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>never</b> came back until 1910.|$|E

25|$|While {{encouraging}} {{and supporting the}} public and private practice of medicine, the Roman government tended to suppress organizations of medici in society. The constitution provided for the formation of occupational collegia, or guilds. The consuls and the emperors treated these ambivalently. Sometimes they were permitted; more often they were made illegal and were suppressed. The medici formed collegia, which had their own centers, the Scholae Medicorum, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>never</b> amounted to a significant social force. They were regarded as subversive along with all the other collegia.|$|E
25|$|The Soviet {{government}} {{realized that}} a military solution to the conflict would require far more troops. Because of this they discussed troop withdrawals and searched for a political and peaceful solution as early as 1980, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>never</b> took any serious steps in that direction until 1988. Early Soviet military reports confirm the difficulties the Soviet army had while fighting on the mountainous terrain, for which the Soviet army had no training whatsoever. Parallels with the Vietnam War were frequently referred to by Soviet army officers.|$|E
25|$|Kansas City is {{most famous}} for its steak and barbecue, along with the typical array of Southern cuisine. During {{the heyday of the}} Kansas City Stockyards, the city was known for its Kansas City steaks or Kansas City strip steaks. The most famous of its steakhouses is the Golden Ox in the Kansas City Live Stock Exchange in the West Bottoms stockyards. These stockyards were second only to those of Chicago in size, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>never</b> {{recovered}} from the Great Flood of 1951 and eventually closed. Founded in 1938, Jess & Jim's Steakhouse in the Martin City neighborhood was also well known.|$|E
