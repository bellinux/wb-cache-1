2500|$|A 2015 {{documentary}} by Al Jazeera English {{asserted that}} up to 10% of New Caledonia's population is descended from around 2,000 Arab-Berber people deported from French Algeria in the late 19th century to prisons on the island in reprisal for the [...] in 1871.

Despite facing <b>both</b> <b>assimilation</b> into the Euro-French population and discrimination for their ethnic background, descendants of the deportees have succeeded in preserving a common identity as Algerians, including maintaining certain cultural practices (such as Arabic names) and Islamic religion. They commonly travel to Algeria as a rite of passage, though obtaining Algerian citizenship is often a difficult process.

5000|$|The Western Yiddish dialect—sometimes pejoratively labeled Mauscheldeutsch(i. e.

A Maskil (from the same root word as Haskalah) would write about and promote {{acclimatization}} to the outside world. Jewish children began attending secular schools where the primary language spoken and taught was German, not Yiddish.

50|$|Since 9/11, Moghaddam {{has applied}} his 'collectivist/normative' {{approach}} to explaining radicalization and {{terrorism in the}} context of accelerating fractured globalization. His staircase model of terrorism is a concrete outcome of this approach. His solution to radicalization is a new policy to managing intergroup relations, based on his alternative policy of omniculturalism, which focused on human commonalities and rejects <b>both</b> <b>assimilation</b> and multiculturalism. He has also worked to establish an empirical basis for universal human rights, and to explain {{the rise and fall of}} dictatorships through his springboard model. His claim is that in terms of personality characteristics, there are potential dictators in all human groups. The key is to understand the conditions that give rise to the springboard, which enables a potential dictator to spring to power.|$|E
50|$|Humanistic/forensic {{psychologist}} Louis Sundararajan also critiqued Keltner and Haidt’s {{model by}} arguing that being {{in the presence of}} a more powerful other elicits admiration, but does not require mental accommodation because admiration merely reinforces existing social hierarchies. Sundararajan expanded upon Keltner and Haidt’s model {{by arguing that}} first, an individual must be confronted with perceived vastness. If an individual can assimilate this perceived vastness into her or his existing mental categories, s/he will not experience awe. If an individual cannot assimilate the perceived vastness, then s/he will need to accommodate to the new information (change her or his mental categories). If this is not accomplished, an individual will experience trauma, such as developing PTSD. If an individual can accommodate, s/he will experience awe and wonder. By this model, the same vast experience could lead to increased rigidity (when assimilation succeeds), increased flexibility (when assimilation fails but accommodation succeeds), or psychopathology (when <b>both</b> <b>assimilation</b> and accommodation fail). Sundararajan did not speculate on the evolutionary origins of awe.|$|E
5000|$|The goal {{of genetic}} {{epistemology}} {{is to link}} the validity of knowledge to the model of its construction. It shows that how the knowledge was gained affects how valid it is. For example, our experience of gravity makes our knowledge of it more valid than our theory about black holes. Genetic epistemology also explains the process of how people develop cognitively from birth throughout their lives in four primary stages: sensorimotor (birth to age 2), pre-operational (2-7), concrete operational (7-11), and formal operational (11 years onward). The main {{focus is on the}} younger years of development. [...] occurs when the perception of a new event or object occurs to the learner in an existing schema and is usually used in the context of self-motivation. In Accommodation, one accommodates the experiences according to the outcome of the tasks. The highest form of development is equilibration. Equilibration encompasses <b>both</b> <b>assimilation</b> and accommodation as the learner changes how they think to get a better answer. This is the upper level of development.|$|E

40|$|The {{usage of}} Atmospheric Motion Vectors (AMVs) in the BUFR-encoded dataset (BUFR AMVs) {{generated}} from all geostationary satellites was revised in the JMA operational global 4 D-Var assimilation system on 18 October 2006, {{and in the}} JMA operational mesoscale 4 D-Var assimilation system on 7 December 2007. This revision included the replacement of SATOB AMVs with BUFR AMVs, the introduction of hourly MTSAT- 1 R AMVs and improvement of the pre-processing method in <b>both</b> <b>assimilation</b> systems. Before the revision, BUFR AMVs generated from only METEOSAT satellites and SATOB AMVs from MTSAT- 1 R and GOES satellites had been assimilated in both systems.

40|$|We {{present results}} from the {{assimilation}} of observed oceanic 3 -D temperature and salinity fields into the global coupled Max Planck Institute Earth system model with the SEIK filter from January 1996 to December 2010. Our study {{is part of an}} effort to perform and evaluate assimilation and prediction within the same coupled climate model without the use of re-analysis data. We use two assimilation setups, one where oceanic observations over the entire water column are assimilated, and one where only oceanic observations below 50 m depth are assimilated. We compare the results from <b>both</b> <b>assimilations</b> with an unconstrained control experiment. While we do not find significant improvements due to assimilation in terms of the root-mean-square error of simulated temperature, 0 – 700 m heat content, sea surface height (SSH), and the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) against observations, we find the variability in terms of correlation with observations significantly improved due to assimilation, most prominently in the tropical oceans. Improvements over the control experiment are stronger in the sub- 50 m assimilation experiment and in integrated quantities (SSH, AMOC) ...|$|R

30|$|Also worth {{discussing}} is {{the importance}} of the duration of the migration spell.

40|$|A mixed methods {{study of}} the two leading bilingual news {{publications}} in San Antonio, Texas, in 2009 reveals that the editors and journalists {{who are responsible for}} the content and direction of the publications have adapted the role of their publications to fit the evolving composition of the U. S. Hispanic population in San Antonio. This study incorporated content analysis based on 24 issues of two bilingual news publications and seven in-depth interviews with editors and journalists at the two publications. The results were examined within the frame of recent models of ethnic media functions and their use of assimilation and pluralism characteristics. The quantitative and qualitative findings show that the two publications utilize a convergence of <b>both</b> <b>assimilation</b> and pluralism elements within the content of their pages. The importance of research that combines the above elements centers on the central fact that the expanding Hispanic populace in America is characterized by its steady stream of newcomers combined with an existing population which often has many familial layers. This has created a need for a type of 2 ̆ 2 foreign-language 2 ̆ 2 press unlike any that preceded it. This press must meet the needs of both unassimilated newcomers and highly assimilated residents alike. The resulting picture that emerges is of a press that combines <b>both</b> <b>assimilation</b> and pluralistic functions, looking ahead while not forgetting the past...|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{carboxylates}} (organic acid anions) on NH 4 uptake was studied {{by changing the}} carboxylate level of roots prior to uptake experi ments. Succinate was the most effective stimulator of ammonium uptake. The oxocarboxylates (α-oxoglutarate, oxaloacetate and pyruvate) and malate also promoted NH 4 entry. Preloading of roots with citrate, acetate, oxalate, glyoxylate or malonate reduced subsequent ammonium uptake. It is concluded that oxocarboxylates are important compounds in <b>both</b> the <b>assimilation</b> and the uptake process of ammonium. All carboxylates tested enhanced K uptake, but repressed NO 3 uptake, except citrate which increased nitrate absorption. Carboxylate stimulation of NH 4 entry showed metabolic as well as non-metabolic aspects...|$|R

30|$|In sum, the {{differences}} among Cubans who uprooted at different times with different premigration experiences reveal that extant studies, which focus on contrasts between first and second generation immigrants, homogenize and ignore important differences in adaptation and transnational engagement among foreign-born.

It points to enduring cross-border influences of immigrants’ pasts that <b>both</b> <b>assimilation</b> and transnational analyses, to date, have left undocumented and unexplained. The “new thinking” also calls for compilation of new data, in order to assess, better, how premigration experiences influence immigrant lives.|$|E

40|$|Leaf {{isoprene}} emission scales {{positively with}} light intensity, is inhibited by high carbon dioxide (CO 2) concentrations, {{and may be}} enhanced or inhibited by low oxygen (O 2) concentrations, but the mechanisms of environmental regulation of isoprene emission are still not fully understood. Emission controls by isoprene synthase, availability of carbon intermediates, or energetic cofactors have been suggested previously. In this study, we asked whether the short-term (tens of minutes) environmental control of isoprene synthesis results from alterations in the immediate isoprene precursor dimethylallyldiphosphate (DMADP) pool size, {{and to what extent}} DMADP concentrations are affected by the supply of carbon and energetic metabolites. A novel in vivo method based on postillumination isoprene release was employed to measure the pool size of DMADP simultaneously with the rates of isoprene emission and net assimilation at different light intensities and CO 2 and O 2 concentrations. <b>Both</b> net <b>assimilation</b> and isoprene emission rates increased hyperbolically with light intensity. The photosynthetic response to CO 2 concentration was also hyperbolic, while the CO 2 response curve of isoprene emission exhibited a maximum at close to CO 2 compensation point. Low O 2 positively affected <b>both</b> net <b>assimilation</b> and isoprene emission. In all cases, the variation in isoprene emission was matched with changes in DMADP pool size. The results of these experiments suggest that DMADP pool size controls the response of isoprene emission to light intensity and to CO 2 and O 2 concentrations and that the pool size is determined by the level of energetic metabolites generated in photosynthesis...|$|R
