40|$|<b>Brain</b> <b>Storm</b> Optimization (BSO) is a newly-developed swarm {{intelligence}} {{optimization algorithm}} {{inspired by a}} human being’s be-havior of brainstorming. In this paper, a novel predator–prey BSO model, which is named Predator–prey <b>Brain</b> <b>Storm</b> Optimization (PPBSO), is proposed to solve an optimization problem modeled for a DC brushless motor. The Predator–prey concept is adopted to better utilize the global information and improve the swarm diversity during the evolution process. The proposed algorithm is applied to solve the optimization problems in an electromagnetic field. The comparative results demonstrate that both PPBSO and BSO can succeed in optimizing design variables for a DC brushless motor to maximize its efficiency. Simulation results show PPBSO has better ability {{to jump out of}} local optima when compared with the original BSO. In addition, it demonstrates satisfactory stability in repeated experiments.

Sanford served as councillor, secretary and then president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America (1966 to 1979.)
