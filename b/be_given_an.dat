5|$|Asche {{began the}} 2015 season among the team's hottest hitters, and a {{mainstay}} {{in the lineup}} as the team's starting third baseman. However, in late April, he began working on skills as an outfielder, ostensibly {{in preparation for the}} arrival of minor league prospect Maikel Franco, regarded as a stronger defensive third baseman. In fact, the Phillies optioned Asche back to Triple-A on May 12 to accelerate his development as a left fielder, as Franco was hitting very well in the minor leagues, and could be ready for a promotion. Although surprised and disappointed by the move, Asche sought to trust the organization and play wherever it needed him. Ultimately, Asche struggled to find playing time during the remainder of the season, although MLB.com writer Todd Zolecki said that Asche would <b>be</b> <b>given</b> <b>an</b> opportunity in 2016 as the Phillies like his makeup, but the burden will be on him to produce results to justify the playing time, given the amelioration of other options at his positions.|$|E

5|$|Emergency {{treatment}} {{is needed in}} a case of a severe allergic reaction. Before calling for help, laying a person down and elevating the legs is suggested. Depending on a patients needs, they will <b>be</b> <b>given</b> <b>an</b> EpiPen or an Anapen to use in case they are stung. In a scenario of experiencing anaphylaxis, further doses of adrenaline and intravenous infusions may be required. Some with severe anaphylaxis may suffer cardiac arrest and will need resuscitation. Inhalers may additionally be used in case a victim has asthma and experiences a reaction from a sting. The use of ACE inhibitors is not recommended, as it is known to increase the risk of anaphylaxis. Medications like antihistamines, H2 blockers, corticosteroids and anti-leukotrienes have no effect on anaphylaxis.|$|E
5|$|In late February–early March 1878, Louis {{was still}} {{serving on the}} Sultan as it lay in the Bosphorus during the Russo-Turkish War. He was criticised for visiting his brother, Prince Alexander, who was serving with the Russian forces, but an {{investigation}} cleared both Louis and Alexander, as well as Prince Alfred, of any wrongdoing. For {{the next two years}} Louis served on HMS Agincourt and on the Royal Yacht, HMY Osborne, but in October 1879 he refused further service on the Royal Yacht, saying it was damaging his professional career, and requested half-pay until he could <b>be</b> <b>given</b> <b>an</b> active duty. On 17 February 1880 he, his father, and Tsar Alexander II witnessed an explosion at the Winter Palace in Saint Petersburg, when Stephen Chalturin unsuccessfully attempted to assassinate the Tsar with dynamite beneath the great dining room.|$|E

5|$|Realizing his situation, Maroboduus {{requested}} Roman aid. It {{had been}} two years since the Marcommani refused to help Roman {{against the forces of}} Arminius, and so Tiberius refused to send aid. Instead, Tiberius sent Drusus to further Roman interests at Maroboduus' expense as he knew the Marcomanni were vulnerable. During the summer of 18, Drusus received intelligence from a former captive of Maroboduus, Catualda, that Maroboduus was weak and {{that it was a good}} time to attack. Hence, Drusus led a powerful force into the heart of the Marcomanni, and stormed their royal stronghold. Maroboduus fled, but was forced to seek asylum in Rome, which Tiberius granted. Later, Catualda lost a battle against the Hermunduri, and he too was granted asylum. The Senate decreed that Drusus <b>be</b> <b>given</b> <b>an</b> ovation for his success, which he received on his return to Rome on 28 May 20.|$|E
5|$|Shadow Dragon {{was first}} {{announced}} in October 2007 at a Nintendo conference, {{where it had}} yet to <b>be</b> <b>given</b> <b>an</b> official title. While a remake, Nintendo has included it in lists of Fire Emblem titles, variously calling it the eleventh or twelfth entry. It was confirmed for a Western release at a press summit in October 2008 for a North American release the following year, with the European release being planned for 2008. The game was localized for the West by external company 8-4: {{this was due to}} the large volume of text present in the story, which made localizing it internally difficult for Nintendo. Shadow Dragon was released in Japan on August 7, 2008; in Europe on December 5; in North America on February 16, 2009; and in Australia on February 26. The release of Shadow Dragon marked the first time any form of the first Fire Emblem game had been released outside Japan.|$|E

5|$|The Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) General P. P. Kumaramangalam was due {{to retire}} in June 1969. Though Manekshaw was the most senior {{commander}} in army, Defence Minister Sardar Swaran Singh was in favour of Lieutenant General Harbaksh Singh, who had {{played a key role}} as the GOC-in-C of Western Command during the 1965 Indo-Pakistani war. Despite this, Manekshaw was appointed as the 8th Chief of the Army Staff on 8 June 1969. As the Chief of the Army Staff, he developed the Indian Army into an efficient instrument of war. During his tenure as COAS, he was instrumental in stopping the implementation of reservations for scheduled castes and scheduled tribes in the army. Though he was Parsi, a minority group in India, Mankeshaw felt that implementing reservations would compromise the ethos of the army; he also felt all must <b>be</b> <b>given</b> <b>an</b> equal chance.|$|E

In the 2017 election which was reserved to the Malay community, the Community Committee rejected two declarations, one from a declarant who stated he belonged to the Chinese community, and one from a declarant who said he was not a member of either the Chinese community, Malay community, or Indian or other minority communities.

Producers for Coronation Street, however, were so impressed by Thompson that they asked him to audition for a different role. His try-out was successful and he was given a six-month contract, along with the option to extend it for up to a year. He was cast as Ryan Connor, a boy who moves to Weatherfield—the fictional Greater Manchester setting of Coronation Street—with his mother, Michelle (played by actress and former Hear'Say band member Kym Marsh), and her brothers, Liam (Rob James-Collier) and Paul (Sean Gallagher).

5|$|On 22 March 1933 he {{was invited}} for an {{interview}} for a commission in the Air Force in Pretoria. One of 30 applicants vying for three places, he was rejected for lack of flying experience. Determined to rectify this weakness, he went to Johannesburg and began taking flying lessons. To fund his new ambition, {{he worked for a}} mining company, Sheba Gold Mine. He enjoyed the work so much he considered studying for a degree in mining engineering. His passion for flying subsided, but an impromptu visit by a transport aircraft gave Pattle a close glimpse of it, which rekindled his interest. At around the same time, the Ministry of Defence created the Special Service Battalion to employ South African youth who were struggling to find work because of the Great Depression. He joined up in 1936 hoping it would lead to a career in the Air Force.

5|$|The legend tell of {{the demon}} Malla {{and his younger}} brother Mani, who had gained the boon of invincibility from Brahma, {{creating}} chaos on the earth and harassing the sages. When the seven sages approached Shiva for protection after Indra and Vishnu confessed their incapability, Shiva assumed the form (Avatar) of Martanda Bhairava, as the Mahatmya calls Khandoba, riding the Nandi bull, leading an army of the gods. Martanda Bhairava is described as shining like the gold and sun, covered in turmeric also known as Haridra, three-eyed, with a crescent moon on his forehead. The demon army was slaughtered by the gods and finally Khandoba killed Malla and Mani. While dying, Mani offers his white horse to Khandoba as an act of repentance and asks for a boon. The boon is that he be present in every shrine of Khandoba, that human-kind is bettered and that he <b>be</b> <b>given</b> <b>an</b> offering of goat flesh. The boon was granted, and thus he was transformed into a demigod. Malla, when asked by the deity if he asked for a boon, asks for the destruction of the world and human-flesh. Angered by the demon's request, Khandoba decapitates him, and his head falls at the temple stairs where it will trampled by devotees' feet. The legend further describes how two Lingas appeared at Prempuri, the place where the demons were killed.|$|E
