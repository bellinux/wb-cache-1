50|$|The iAUDIO 5 was {{introduced}} in December 2004. It was the successor to the popular iAUDIO 4 series and was powered by the same Sigmatel chipset {{that were used in}} the iAUDIO U2 and G3. The iAUDIO 5 was relatively similar to the aforementioned players. What set it apart from other players was the fact that it had 1000 different <b>backlight</b> <b>colour</b> combinations. It was powered by an AAA battery which allowed for a maximum playback time of up to 20 hours.|$|E
40|$|The minimum {{necessary}} gamut is calculated frame-by-frame and the primaries are desaturated dynamically by simultaneously turning on several <b>backlight</b> <b>colours</b> during each primary field. Depending {{on the display}} response, this leads to better backlight utilization, increased luminance, and/or enhanced moving image quality. For a fast-response, three-primary field-sequential-colour display, the luminance can be increased by up to 300 % for unsaturated content. 1...|$|R

50|$|The iAUDIO 4 was {{introduced}} December 2003. It came {{with most of}} the features that users of the CW200 and CW300 had been missing.Upgrades from previous players {{came in the form of}} UMS standard, BBE sound processing effects, line in recording and a 124 <b>colour</b> <b>backlight</b> LED display. This player used the STMP 3420 chipset by Sigmatel.|$|R
40|$|The present {{invention}} {{relates to}} {{a method for}} calibrating the colour of a colour monitor with LED backlighting, in which at least one area of an image displayed on the colour monitor (1) is remotely measured in a spatially resolved manner using a colour sensor (7) {{in the form of}} an image or line sensor, deviations of measured colour values from desired colour values are determined in a spatially resolved manner, and LED <b>backlighting</b> of the <b>colour</b> monitor (1) is controlled in order to locally correct the deviations. When the colour sensor (7) is integrated into the remote control (2) of a colour TV, the user only suitably orients the remote control (2) with respect to the TV, as a result of which the colour sensor (7) records a test image (3) of the colour TV and evaluates said image in order to determine colour corrections. The method makes it possible to easily calibrate the colour of a colour TV ex works or directly with the user...|$|R
5000|$|To {{overcome}} the aforementioned challenges with RGB and white LED backlights an 'advanced remote phosphor' [...] LED {{technology has been}} developed by NDF Special Light Products, specifically for high-end and long-life LCD applications such as cockpit displays, Air Traffic Control displays and medical displays. This technology uses blue pump LEDs in combination with a sheet on which phosphorous luminescent materials are printed for colour conversion. The principle is similar to Quantum Dots, but the phosphors applied are much more robust than the quantum dot nano-particles for applications that require long lifetime in more demanding operational conditions. Because the phosphor sheet is {{placed at a distance}} (remote) of the LED it experiences much less temperature stress than phosphors in white LEDs. As a result, the whitepoint is less dependent on individual LEDs, and degrading of individual LEDs over lifetime, leading to a more homogenous <b>backlight</b> with improved <b>colour</b> consistency and lower lumen depreciation.|$|R
