40|$|This paper {{presents}} a comprehensive {{analysis of the}} assembly processes for single-row ball bearings. There are {{two different types of}} assembly processes, which depend on ball numbers and <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>ring</b> designs. In the case of deep groove ball bearings, assembly is usually undertaken through slight deformation of the outer ring to increase clearance for insertion of the final ball. As a result, the outer ring takes an elliptical instead of a circular shape and requires deformation to be below a critical level to avoid fracture. Causal analysis of outer ring fracture during assembly is the main goal of the presented analysis, based on the expressions of the Theory of Elasticity for the thin ring exposed to bending, as well as Finite Element Analysis (FEA). The theoretical and numerical results have been verified by experimental testing...|$|E
40|$|Machining induced {{residual}} stress states {{contribute to the}} distortion of machined components during heat treatments. Thus, ideally a complete characterization of the components {{residual stress}} state is required. Magnetic and micromagnetic analysis of residual stresses can represent an important gain of time if compared to X-ray diffraction. Another important advantage is the access of inner faces of components like <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>rings.</b> This study presents a comparison of these two methods for the characterization of outer and inner surfaces of <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>rings.</b> A good calibration of micromagnetic measurements with X-ray diffraction data is necessary. Reliable results then can be achieved and the residual stress states of rings can be characterized. Effects of clamping systems and feed on the residual stress levels and distribution will be discussed, as well as complex interactions. An implementation of the presented micromagnetic method for non-destructive control in large manufacturing series could be possible...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Experimental {{investigation}} of residual stresses after heat treatment and grinding {{processes in the}} production of <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>rings</b> has been carried out. The residual stresses were measured by X-ray diffraction method utilizing chromium radiation, which has an average penetration depth of 5 µm incident on 100 Cr 6 (AISI-E 52100) <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> steel. The process parameters of heat treatment and grinding processes were varied so as to represent the extreme values that can be applied in the respective processes. Hardness and percent retained austenite limit the heat treatment process parameters; while roundness, surface roughness and form the grinding process. Tensile surface residual stresses on the raceway of <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>rings</b> changes to compression after grinding in both circumferential and axial directions. In grinding relatively higher compressive stresses were measured in axial direction compared to the circumferential direction. This experimental investigation also showed that the influence of heat treatment process parameters on the magnitude and distribution of residual stresses survived even after grinding process; i. e. heat treatment and grinding processes cannot be evaluated independently in process design for favourable residual stresses...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. It is {{necessary}} to slot a groove {{on the outside of}} the bearing’s raceway in order to embed micro-sensor for smart bearing. Reasonable choice of slotting parameters for different type of bearings is one of key problems to be solved in smart bearing design.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this thesis work was to halve the cycle time of a {{grinding}} process of the groove of carbonitrided <b>ball</b> <b>bearings</b> <b>rings.</b> The study was conducted as a Six Sigma project at SKF in Bari, Italy. Reaching the goal was important for the company as it meant avoiding the purchase of another grinding machine. The groove grinding process on carbonitrided rings features double the cycle time than the same process on through hardened rings and halving it was required to fulfill the volumes demanded. The Six Sigma methodology was applied through the implementation of DMAIC. The analysis of the problems and identification of areas for improvement were carried out deploying different tools such as an Ishikawa diagram, Hypothesis Testing and Statistical Process Control. The outcome of this was the need to optimize the carbonitriding process minimizing {{the depth of the}} layer without enlarged carbides in order to render the design of the part easier to machine and subsequently find the process parameters for the groove grinding yielding a cycle time of six seconds. Many trials were conducted with the supplier of carbonitriding, until the carbon and ammonia potentials were set at levels resulting in a depth of the layer allowing the change of the design. An optimizing DOE was instead performed for the grinding process which highlighted the parameters settings yielding the target cycle time. Finally actions and controls to perform {{in order to maintain the}} gains were defined...|$|R

During the 1950s the major product {{manufactured}} at the company was miniature <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> retainer <b>rings.</b> In 1958 Acme Spring was featured in the April 7th edition of Life magazine.

The product line was expanded to include orthodontic hardware in 1970 {{with the addition of}} rolling and wire shaping. By 1984 the company had merged with Monaco Spring, to create Acme Monaco, and its product line was increased to include springs, wireforms, and stampings. Non-sterile medical assemblies, such as surgical staples, guidewires, and stylets were added in 1983. In 1989 a second manufacturing facility was opened in Presque Isle, Maine, USA.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a research of deformations influence on duplex <b>ball</b> <b>bearings</b> dynamic behavior. Despite the common use of duplex <b>ball</b> <b>bearings,</b> bearings sub-components deformations are not thoroughly investigated. In order to investigate these effects, this study integrates {{the outcome of}} a 3 D dynamic model, developed for assessment of the defect pattern and experimental results from a full scale CH- 53 Swashplate test rig. The ability to withstand high radial and bi-directional axial loads makes duplex bearings common in aircraft applications and specifically in helicopter rotors. The swashplate of the CH- 53 is constructed of duplex angular contact <b>ball</b> <b>bearings.</b> Two spacers, internal between the static inner rings and external, between the rotating outer <b>rings</b> support the <b>bearing</b> <b>rings.</b> A structural defect is formed by a faulty external spacer, thus causing a lack of support to the top bearing and deformation of the outer rings. Model results indicate that the lack of support has a defect pattern in both radial and axial directions. Test rig data acquired by accelerometers was analyzed by several diagnostic techniques including order tracking, envelope analysis and dephased algorithm in order to recognize the simulated pattern. 1...|$|R
