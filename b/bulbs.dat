5|$|<b>Bulbs</b> {{offered for}} sale are {{referred}} to as either 'round' or 'double nose'. Round <b>bulbs</b> are circular in cross section and produce a single flower stem, while double nose <b>bulbs</b> have more than one bulb stem attached at the base and produce two or more flower stems, but <b>bulbs</b> with more than two stems are unusual. Planted narcissi <b>bulbs</b> produce daughter <b>bulbs</b> in the axil of the bulb scales, leading to the dying off of the exterior scales. To prevent planted <b>bulbs</b> forming more and more small <b>bulbs,</b> they can be dug up every 5–7 years, and the daughters separated and replanted separately, provided that a piece of the basal plate, where the rootlets are formed, is preserved. For daffodils to flower {{at the end of the}} winter or early spring, <b>bulbs</b> are planted in autumn (September–November). This plant does well in ordinary soil but flourishes best in rich soil. Daffodils like the sun but also accepts partial shade exposure.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bulbs</b> are {{harvested}} for {{market in the}} summer, sorted, stored for 2 – 3 weeks, and then further disinfected by a hot (43.5°C) bath. This eliminates infestations by narcissus fly and nematodes. The <b>bulbs</b> are then dried at a high temperature, and then stored at 15.5°C. The initiation of new flower development in the bulb takes place in late spring before the <b>bulbs</b> are lifted, and is completed by mid summer while the <b>bulbs</b> are in storage. The optimal temperature for initiation is 20°C followed by cooling to 13°C.|$|E

5|$|This group {{contains}} {{shallots and}} potato onions, {{also referred to}} as multiplier onions. The <b>bulbs</b> are smaller than those of common onions, and a single plant forms an aggregate cluster of several <b>bulbs.</b> They are propagated almost exclusively from daughter <b>bulbs,</b> although reproduction from seed is possible. Shallots are the most important subgroup within this group and comprise the only cultivars cultivated commercially. They form aggregate clusters of small, narrowly ovoid to pear-shaped <b>bulbs.</b> Potato onions differ from shallots in forming larger <b>bulbs</b> with fewer <b>bulbs</b> per cluster, and having a flattened (onion-like) shape. However, intermediate forms exist.|$|E

50|$|In most vertebrates, the {{olfactory}} <b>bulb</b> is {{the most}} rostral (forward) part of the brain, as seen in rats. In humans, however, the olfactory <b>bulb</b> is on the inferior (bottom) side of the brain. The olfactory <b>bulb</b> is supported and protected by the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone, which in mammals separates it from the olfactory epithelium, and which is perforated by olfactory nerve axons. The <b>bulb</b> {{is divided into two}} distinct structures: the main olfactory <b>bulb</b> and the accessory olfactory <b>bulb.</b>|$|R
40|$|Application of {{gibberellic}} acid (GA 3) and indoleacetic acid (IAA) increased the root number, root length and root weight, <b>bulb</b> diameter and <b>bulb</b> weight of onion. The highest <b>bulb</b> diameter and <b>bulb</b> weight {{was found at}} 200 ppm each of GA 3 and IAA. Better increase in <b>bulb</b> diameter and <b>bulb</b> weight was achieved by the double dose than single dose. Application of GA 3 and IAA increased the <b>bulb</b> yield. The highest <b>bulb</b> yield (15. 57 t ha - 1 ) was observed at 200 ppm GA 3 followed by 200 ppm of IAA (15. 53 t ha - 1 ). In conclusion, the yield contributing characters and yield of onion could be manipulated by the application of GA 3 and IAA...|$|R
50|$|Determining {{relative}} humidity: The percent {{relative humidity}} can be {{located at the}} intersection of the vertical dry <b>bulb</b> and diagonally down sloping wet <b>bulb</b> temperature lines. Metric (SI): Using a dry <b>bulb</b> of 25 °C and a wet <b>bulb</b> of 20 °C, read the relative humidity at approximately 63.5%. U.S/Imperial (IP): Using a dry <b>bulb</b> of 77 °F and a wet <b>bulb</b> of 68 °F, read the relative humidity at approximately 63.5%. In this example the humidity ratio is 0.0126 kg water per kg dry air.|$|R
5|$|For cut flowers, <b>bulbs</b> {{larger than}} 12cm in size are preferred. To bloom in December, <b>bulbs</b> are {{harvested}} in June to July, dried, stored {{for four days}} at 34°C, two weeks at 30 and two weeks at 17–20°C and then placed in cold storage for precooling at 9 degrees for about 15–16 weeks. The <b>bulbs</b> are then planted in light compost in crates in a greenhouse for forcing at 13°C–15°C and the blooms appear in 19–30 days.|$|E
5|$|I'itoi {{onion is}} a {{prolific}} multiplier onion cultivated in the Baboquivari Peak Wilderness, Arizona area. This small-bulb type has a shallot-like flavour and {{is easy to}} grow and ideal for hot, dry climates. <b>Bulbs</b> are separated, and planted in the fall 1in below the surface and 12in apart. <b>Bulbs</b> will multiply into clumps and can be harvested throughout the cooler months.

5|$|Most Hippeastrum <b>bulbs</b> are {{tunicate}} (a protective dry {{outer layer}} and fleshy concentric inner scales or leaf bases). The <b>bulbs</b> are generally between 512cm (2"5") {{in diameter and}} produce two to seven long-lasting evergreen or deciduous leaves that are 3090cm (12"36") long and 2.55cm (1"2") wide. The leaves are hysteranthous (develop after flowering), sessile, rarely persistent and subpetiolate.|$|E
5|$|Other {{companies}} {{followed with}} their own bubble light versions and other lighting novelties. In 1946, Sylvania introduced fluorescent pastel lights. In 1955, NOMA manufactured flashing lights. In 1958, GE launched Lighted Ice <b>Bulbs,</b> blue <b>bulbs</b> covered with 'ice' crystals. Fairy Lights were imported from Europe in 1950 and eventually morphed into the inexpensive mini-lights popular in the last decades of the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|People were {{purchasing}} <b>bulbs</b> {{at higher}} and higher prices, intending to re-sell them for a profit. However, such a scheme could not last unless someone was ultimately willing to pay such high prices and take possession of the <b>bulbs.</b> In February 1637, tulip traders could no longer find new buyers willing to pay increasingly inflated prices for their <b>bulbs.</b> As this realization set in, the demand for tulips collapsed, and prices plummeted—the speculative bubble burst. Some were left holding contracts to purchase tulips at prices now ten times greater than those on the open market, while others found themselves in possession of <b>bulbs</b> now worth {{a fraction of the}} price they had paid. Mackay claims the Dutch devolved into distressed accusations and recriminations against others in the trade.|$|E

50|$|<b>Bulb</b> exhibitions:Bulb {{cultivation}} {{emerged as}} the successor to herb cultivation. From 1880 the number of <b>bulb</b> growers and <b>bulb</b> fields grew to 250 and 252 hectares respectively, {{by the end of}} the 19th century. Tulips, daffodils and gladioli were grown, amongst other flowers. The majority of <b>bulb</b> fields lie behind the dunes as the sandy soil there is extremely suitable for cultivation. Noordwijk earned a national and international reputation for its impressive <b>bulb</b> exhibitions. In 1932 a Flora park was set up within the Offem country estate. Furthermore, Noordwijk entries could be admired at foreign <b>bulb</b> exhibitions and subsequently also in the flower exhibitions. Today the Noordwijk <b>bulb</b> area covers 311 hectares of land.|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} five {{systemic}} fungicides on <b>bulb</b> formation in onions were investigated. <b>Bulb</b> formation was decreased by repeated soil drenches of Sistesan, Bavistin and Plantvax: {{the decrease in}} <b>bulb</b> diameter was 40 %, 22 % and 14 % respectively; <b>bulb</b> fresh weight was decreased by 61 %, 32 % and 27. 5 % respectively and <b>bulb</b> dry weight by 62. 5 %, 41 %, 28 %.

5|$|Traditionally, sales {{took place}} in the {{daffodil}} fields prior to harvesting the <b>bulbs,</b> but today sales are handled by Marketing Boards although still before harvesting. In the Netherlands there are special exhibition gardens for major buyers to view flowers and order <b>bulbs,</b> some larger ones may have more than a thousand narcissus varieties on display. While individuals can visit these gardens they cannot buy <b>bulbs</b> at retail, which are only available at wholesale, usually at a minimum of several hundredweight. The most famous display is at Keukenhof, although only about 100 narcissus varieties are on display there.|$|E
5|$|William Joseph Hammer {{started to}} collect {{incandescent}} light <b>bulbs</b> from 1879 {{while they were}} being developed in the Edison laboratory in Menlo Park, New Jersey. He was an associate of Thomas Edison and in his engineering career {{he was able to}} collect early filament electric light <b>bulbs</b> from Edison and others because of his association in the field. The Hammer collection is the most comprehensive collection of incandescent electric light <b>bulbs</b> known in the world. It shows the technology development of the filament electric light bulb during Thomas Edison's lifetime.|$|E
5|$|Case No. 1 {{contained}} {{a selection of}} lamps that represented the basics of the technology involved {{in the early stages}} of the electric light bulb development. The case displayed actual physical light <b>bulbs</b> made by Thomas Edison and others from 1878 to 1883. Edison's earliest steps in the bamboo filament and graphite filament lamps are displayed in this case. The first lamp made in a pear shape was in this display, which was the universal shape for electric light <b>bulbs</b> for decades. These in this display case contained numbers that ranged from 1 – 109.|$|E

5|$|For potted flowers a lower {{temperature}} {{is used for}} precooling (5°C for 15 weeks), followed by 16°C–18°C in a greenhouse. For later blooming (mid- and late-forcing), <b>bulbs</b> are harvested in July to August and the higher temperatures are omitted, being stored a 17–20°C after harvesting and placed in cold storage at 9°C in September for 17–18 (cut flowers) or 14–16 (potted flowers) weeks. The <b>bulbs</b> can then be planted in cold frames, and then forced in a greenhouse according to requirements.|$|E
5|$|In Mackay's account, the panicked tulip speculators {{sought help}} from the {{government}} of the Netherlands, which responded by declaring that anyone who had bought contracts to purchase <b>bulbs</b> in the future could void their contract by payment of a 10 percent fee. Attempts were made to resolve the situation to the satisfaction of all parties, but these were unsuccessful. The mania finally ended, Mackay says, with individuals stuck with the <b>bulbs</b> they held {{at the end of the}} crash—no court would enforce payment of a contract, since judges regarded the debts as contracted through gambling, and thus not enforceable by law.|$|E
