60|$|And this <b>brings</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> affirmative, and inquire {{what the}} {{matters of fact}} are; what I have done, or have not done, on account of these {{obligations}} which I am under.|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{reminds me}} of it. The crowd {{consists}} partly of people going to the pro-Cathedral. The pro-Cathedral contains an altar. An altar suggests kneeling on hard stone; and that <b>brings</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> disease called 'housemaids' knee,' which {{was the subject of}} my reflections." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Who {{was it that}} strove <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Red Death before I {{reached the}} sanctuary? Who shot the {{poisoned}} arrow, Priest?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "O row your boat, my mariners, And <b>bring</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> land, For yonder I see my love's castle, Close by the sa't sea strand." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, now, that <b>brings</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> point. In {{the midst}} of all my other worriments, I am debating whether to marry a rich girl and escape work, or a poor girl and work harder, or to give the whole matter of {{marriage}} up forever." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now you understand, Miss Kingston, how anxious I am to {{get across}} the river, and that <b>brings</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{question}} of the information I {{want you to give}} me. How far is it from the next bridge on the south, and are there any Federal troops there?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you, Senator," [...] said Mr. Crewe, [...] "that <b>brings</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> very point I wish to emphasize. Everywhere in Leith I am {{met with}} the remark, 'Have you seen Job Braden?' And I always answer, 'No, I haven't seen Mr. Braden, and I don't intend to see him."' ...|$|E

6000|$|CHAPTER XVIII [...] It is not madness [...] That I have utter'd, <b>bring</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> test, [...] And I {{the matter}} will re-word, which madness [...] Would gambol from.|$|R
6000|$|... "Brawly," [...] said he. [...] "Andie picks {{him up at}} Gillane Sands to-morrow, Wednesday. He was keen to say good-by to ye, but the {{way that}} things were going, I was feared the pair of ye was maybe best apart. And that <b>brings</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> essential: how does your {{business}} speed?" ...|$|E
60|$|This <b>brings</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> real story. There {{is nobody}} else to write it; Oliver will not; Higgs cannot (outside of {{anything}} learned and antiquarian, he is hopeless); so I must. At any rate, {{if it is}} not interesting, the fault will be mine, not that of the story, which in all conscience is strange enough.|$|E
6000|$|And this <b>brings</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> affirmative part, or to {{what really}} I have done; and in this, I {{am sorry to}} say, I {{have one of the}} foulest, most unjust, and unchristian clamours to {{complain}} of, that any man has suffered, I believe, {{since the days of the}} tyranny of king James II. The fact is thus:-- ...|$|E
60|$|Wood. Mr Woodall, you rogue! {{that is my}} nomme de guerre. You know I {{have laid}} by Aldo, for fear that name should <b>bring</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> notice of my father.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh dear, oh dear!" [...] said poor Mollett. [...] "The unfortunate young man; that wretched, unfortunate, young man! He will <b>bring</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> grave at last--to {{the grave}} at last." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{will not}} stop,' said Hanrahan; 'my mind {{would be on}} the roads all <b>the</b> time, <b>bringing</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> woman that sent for me, and she lonesome and {{watching}} till I come.' ...|$|R
60|$|JAMES. [Much more gently] Now, my boy, what you've {{got to do}} is to put all {{the past}} behind you and build {{yourself}} up a steady reputation. And that <b>brings</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> second thing. This woman you were mixed up with you must give us your word, you know, to have done with that. There's no chance of your keeping straight if you're going to begin your future with such a relationship.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{scarcely}} {{think that}} goes quite far enough, as radicalism {{seems to be}} understood by its acknowledged leaders. Blatant is the adjective usually hurled at us; and no doubt I deserve it, as witness what you have endured to-night. Still, you see, I wasn't talking quite without a purpose, because I {{want you to understand}} my attitude--and that <b>brings</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> point. I'm afraid I can't play with you at the tournament, as was arranged." ...|$|E
60|$|And that <b>brings</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> second oversight. The {{surprise}} and conquest of Cahokia by Bowman {{and his men}} was like that of Kaskaskia. And the French there were loyal, too, offering their militia for service {{in the place of}} those men of Bowman's company who would not reenlist. These came to Kaskaskia to join our home-goers, and no sooner had the hundred marched out of the gate and taken up their way for Kentucky than Colonel Clark began the drilling of the new troops.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{would not}} press you to reveal any secrets, Mr. Black, yet I {{think you are}} safe <b>to</b> trust <b>me,</b> seeing that you know enough about my own secrets <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> gallows if so disposed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Aye, O Dream, I {{wished for}} vengeance upon Abi, the traitor, Abi the murderer of my father, who would <b>bring</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> last shame of womanhood. I wished for vengeance upon Abi, and all who cling to him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Shall I {{ever see}} the {{beautiful}} world again?" [...] sighed Ripple. [...] "It is indeed a dreadful road, and but for the seasons' gifts I should have died. Fly fast, dear wind, and <b>bring</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sunshine again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I've {{done very}} well," [...] {{returned}} Dobson; [...] "and I find the hunter's life so congenial, and withal so profitable, that I'm really thinking of adopting it as a profession. And that <b>brings</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> object of my visit here to-night. The fact is, my dear fellows, that men of your genius are not fit for farmers. It takes quiet-going men of sense to cultivate the soil. If you three were {{to live and}} dig {{to the age of}} Methuselah you'd never make a living out of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A curious thing, concentration," [...] said George, [...] "and {{why certain}} {{phenomena}} should {{prevent us from}} focusing our attention---- This <b>brings</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> vexed question of sleep. Why {{is it that we}} are able to sleep through some vast convulsion of Nature when a dripping tap is enough to keep us awake? I am told that there were people who slumbered peacefully through the San Francisco earthquake, merely stirring drowsily {{from time to time to}} tell an imaginary person to leave it on the mat. Yet these same people----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I was {{completely}} unprepared for this. I could only mutter and {{shake my head}} vaguely. Afterwards I am perfectly aware I cut a very poor figure trying to extricate myself out of this difficulty. From that moment, however, the old nakhoda became taciturn. He was not very pleased, I fear, and evidently I had given him food for thought. Strangely enough, {{on the evening of}} that very day (which was my last in Patusan) I was once more confronted with the same question, with the unanswerable why of Jim's fate. And this <b>brings</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> story of his love.|$|E
5000|$|While {{a student}} in New York, Estorick met the American {{photographer}} and gallery owner Alfred Stieglitz. Estorick later said: Meeting Stieglitz {{was one of the}} most important experiences of my life, <b>bringing</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> heart of the world of art.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I won't {{stand by}} and see it done, Fagin,' cried the girl. 'You've got the boy, and what more would you have?--Let him be--let him be--or I shall put that mark on some of you, that will <b>bring</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> gallows before my time.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The wild savages!" [...] exclaimed the King, [...] "would they limit {{our best}} and dearest royal privilege, that {{of putting a}} stop to strife, and crying truce to battle? Will they remove the only motive which could <b>bring</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> butcherly {{spectacle}} of their combat? Would they fight like men, or like their own mountain wolves?" ...|$|R
60|$|And this {{recollection}} {{of a personal}} wish, experienced upon several oceans, where {{the soul of the}} world has plenty of room to turn over with a mighty sigh, <b>brings</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> remark that in order to take a proper care of a ship's spars it is just as well for a seaman to have nothing the matter with his ears. Such is the intimacy with which a seaman had to live with his ship of yesterday that his senses were like her senses, that the stress upon his body made him judge of the strain upon the ship's masts.|$|E
6000|$|... "This <b>brings</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> subject before us. I {{have written}} to him, {{to say that}} I will send to him an English officer, capable of {{training}} and leading his troops, and whose advice {{may be useful to}} him upon all occasions; but that as, were it known that he had received a British officer, and was employing him to train his troops, it would excite the instant animosity of Bussy and of the Peishwar; I should send one familiar with the language, and who may pass as a native. Captain Clive has strongly recommended you for this difficult mission." ...|$|E
6000|$|Then Devine made a {{sign that}} he desired attention. [...] "When I told you this, I had a purpose," [...] he said. [...] "We are going to spend a pile of dollars on the Dayspring, and my part of the {{business}} lies in the city. Wilkins stays right at the Canopus, and while Allonby goes along with the mine it's too big a contract to reform him. That <b>brings</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> point. I want a man to take charge at the Dayspring under him, and though you were not exactly civil when I made you an offer once before, we might make it worth your while." ...|$|E
60|$|After that I {{looked up}} impatiently at the sails, which I now regretted having lowered so hastily, {{and for a}} moment thought of {{hoisting}} the main topsail again; but recollecting that it would take <b>me</b> full half-a-day <b>to</b> accomplish, and that, at the present rate of sailing, two hours would <b>bring</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> island, I immediately dismissed the idea.|$|R
60|$|This <b>brings</b> <b>me</b> back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{point at}} which I diverged--the Great Fish River, which takes its rise in the Sneewberg range.|$|R
5000|$|I have {{so often}} been asked the question: [...] "But {{how did you}} come <b>to</b> think of <b>The</b> Scarlet Pimpernel?" [...] And my answer has always been: [...] "It was God's will that I should." [...] And to you moderns, who perhaps do not believe as I do, I will say, [...] "In the chain of my life, there were so many links, all of which tended towards <b>bringing</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{fulfillment}} of my destiny." ...|$|R
