5|$|The DB9 is {{the first}} model to be built at Aston Martin's Gaydon {{facility}} in Warwickshire, England. In a 2007 interview, Aston Martin CEO Dr. Ulrich Bez stated that, though Aston Martin was traditionally a maker of more exclusive automobiles, he believed Aston Martin needed to be more visible and <b>build</b> <b>more</b> cars. At launch, Aston Martin planned to build between 1,400 and 1,500 DB9s per year.|$|E
5|$|The {{paradigm}} gave researchers {{license to}} study isolated problems and find solutions that were both verifiable and useful. It provided {{a common language}} to describe problems and share their solutions with each other, and with other fields that also used concepts of abstract agents, like economics and control theory. It was hoped that a complete agent architecture (like Newell's SOAR) would one day allow researchers to <b>build</b> <b>more</b> versatile and intelligent systems out of interacting intelligent agents.|$|E
5|$|A {{small number}} of motte-and-bailey castles were built outside of {{northern}} Europe. In the late-12th century, the Normans invaded southern Italy and Sicily; although they had the technology to <b>build</b> <b>more</b> modern designs, in many cases wooden motte-and-bailey castles were built instead for reasons of speed. The Italians came {{to refer to a}} range of different castle types as motta, however, and there may not have been as many genuine motte-and-bailey castles in southern Italy as was once thought {{on the basis of the}} documentary evidence alone. In addition, there is evidence of the Norman crusaders building a motte and bailey using sand and wood in Egypt in 1221 during the Fifth Crusade.|$|E

5|$|Although a {{small number}} of castles had been built in England during the 1050s, after the conquest the Normans began to build timber motte and bailey and ringwork castles in large numbers to control their newly {{occupied}} territories. During the 12th century the Normans began to <b>build</b> <b>more</b> castles in stone, with characteristic square keeps that supported both military and political functions. Royal castles were used to control key towns and forests, whilst baronial castles were used by the Norman lords to control their widespread estates; a feudal system called the castle-guard was sometimes used to provide garrisons. Castles and sieges continued to grow in military sophistication during the 12th century, and in the 13th century new defensive town walls were constructed across England.|$|E
5|$|Another {{meeting on}} the issue was called on 6 December 1966, {{attended}} by Johnson, McNamara, the deputy Secretary of Defense Cyrus Vance, Walt Rostow of the National Security Agency (NSA) and the Joint Chiefs. Rostow took {{the side of the}} JCS and it appeared that development would start. However, McNamara once again outlined the problems and stated that the simplest way to close the ABM gap was to simply <b>build</b> <b>more</b> ICBMs, rendering the Soviet system impotent and a great waste of money. He then proposed that the money sidelined by Congress for deployment be used for initial deployment studies while the US attempted to negotiate an arms limitation treaty. Johnson agreed with this compromise, and ordered Secretary of State Dean Rusk to open negotiations with the Soviets.|$|E
5|$|Around 1279BC, Ramesses II, {{also known}} as Ramesses the Great, ascended the throne, {{and went on to}} <b>build</b> <b>more</b> temples, erect more statues and obelisks, and sire more {{children}} than any other pharaoh in history. A bold military leader, Ramesses II led his army against the Hittites in the Battle of Kadesh (in modern Syria) and, after fighting to a stalemate, finally agreed to the first recorded peace treaty, around 1258BC. With both the Egyptians and Hittite Empire proving unable to gain the upper hand over one another, and both powers also fearful of the expanding Middle Assyrian Empire, Egypt withdrew from much of the Near East. The Hittites were thus left to compete unsuccessfully with the powerful Assyrians and the newly arrived Phrygians.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, a goalkeeper {{may also}} attempt to delay a penalty by {{cleaning}} his boots, asking the referee {{to see if}} the ball is placed properly and other delaying tactics. This method <b>builds</b> <b>more</b> pressure on the penalty taker, but the goalkeeper may risk punishments, most likely a yellow card.|$|R

5|$|Both {{linguistic}} and socio-cultural factors affect {{the rate at}} which vocabulary develops. Children must learn to use their words appropriately and strategically in social situations. They have flexible and powerful social-cognitive skills that allow them to understand the communicative intentions of others {{in a wide variety of}} interactive situations. Children learn new words in communicative situations. Children rely on pragmatic skills to <b>build</b> <b>more</b> extensive vocabularies. Some aspects of pragmatic behaviour can predict later literacy and mathematical achievement, as children who are pragmatically skilled often function better in school. These children are also generally better liked.|$|E
5|$|Jennings {{continued}} to promote internal infrastructure improvements throughout his term in Congress. He introduced legislation to <b>build</b> <b>more</b> forts in the northwest, to grant {{federal funding for}} improvement projects in Indiana and Ohio, and led the debate in support of using federal funds to build the nations longest canal, Wabash and Erie Canal, through Indiana. He introduced a legislative amendment that made a provision to locate and survey the National Road to the west, toward the Mississippi River, so {{the people living in}} Indiana and Illinois would have some assurance that the road's large federal appropriation would benefit them directly. Jennings helped secure appropriation of funds to survey the Wabash River and make it more accessible to year-round steamboat travel.|$|E
5|$|Since Carcharocles {{is derived}} from Otodus, and the two had teeth that bear a close {{similarity}} {{to those of the}} sand tiger shark (Carcharias taurus), megalodon may have had a <b>build</b> <b>more</b> similar to the sand tiger shark than to other sharks. However, this is unlikely since sand tiger sharks are axial swimmers that flex their body for propulsion, meaning that they are adapted for acceleration rather than for maintaining high cruising speeds. A large sand tiger shark would require large fins to propel itself, however this in itself would create more drag and offset efficiency, so it is unlikely that they had similar body shapes given how large megalodon was.|$|E

5|$|The Town Center {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} buildings in the game. Here villagers are created, and age advancement is researched. Most scenarios have each player begin with a single Town Center; the ability to build multiple Town Centers is unlocked by the construction of the Government Center during the Bronze Age. The Town Center provides population support for four units. In order to <b>build</b> <b>more</b> units, houses must be constructed. Each house supports four units, and although any number of houses can be built (a concept which was not maintained in later games like Age of Mythology), they can only support a maximum of fifty units.|$|E
5|$|Another {{very common}} {{component}} of distributed element filters is the stub. Over {{a narrow range}} of frequencies, a stub {{can be used as}} a capacitor or an inductor (its impedance is determined by its length) but over a wide band it behaves as a resonator. Short-circuit, nominally quarter-wavelength stubs (figure 3(a)) behave as shunt LC antiresonators, and an open-circuit nominally quarter-wavelength stub (figure 3(b)) behaves as a series LC resonator. Stubs can also be used in conjunction with impedance transformers to <b>build</b> <b>more</b> complex filters and, as would be expected from their resonant nature, are most useful in band-pass applications. While open-circuit stubs are easier to manufacture in planar technologies, they have the drawback that the termination deviates significantly from an ideal open circuit (see figure 4(b)), often leading to a preference for short-circuit stubs (one can always be used in place of the other by adding or subtracting λ/4 to or from the length).|$|E
5|$|As part {{of their}} Wizard research, the Air Force had {{developed}} a formula that compared {{the cost of an}} ICBM to the ABM needed to shoot it down. The formula, later known as the cost-exchange ratio, could be expressed as a dollar figure; if the cost of the ICBM was less than that figure, the economic advantage was in favor of the offense - they could <b>build</b> <b>more</b> ICBMs for less money than the ABMs needed to shoot them down. A variety of scenarios demonstrated that it was almost always the case that the offense had the advantage. The Air Force ignored this inconvenient problem while they were still working on Wizard, {{but as soon as the}} Army was handed sole control of the ABM efforts, they immediately submitted it to McElroy. McElroy identified this as an example of interservice fighting, but was concerned that the formula might be correct.|$|E

5|$|Bird {{eggs are}} usually laid in a nest. Most species create {{somewhat}} elaborate nests, {{which can be}} cups, domes, plates, beds scrapes, mounds, or burrows. Some bird nests, however, are extremely primitive; albatross nests {{are no more than}} a scrape on the ground. Most birds build nests in sheltered, hidden areas to avoid predation, but large or colonial birds—which are more capable of defence—may <b>build</b> <b>more</b> open nests. During nest construction, some species seek out plant matter from plants with parasite-reducing toxins to improve chick survival, and feathers are often used for nest insulation. Some bird species have no nests; the cliff-nesting common guillemot lays its eggs on bare rock, and male emperor penguins keep eggs between their body and feet. The absence of nests is especially prevalent in ground-nesting species where the newly hatched young are precocial.|$|E
5|$|Castles {{have played}} an {{important}} military, economic and social role in Great Britain and Ireland since their introduction following the Norman invasion of England in 1066. Although {{a small number of}} castles had been built in England in the 1050s, the Normans began to build motte and bailey and ringworks castles in large numbers to control their newly occupied territories in England and the Welsh Marches. During the 12th century the Normans began to <b>build</b> <b>more</b> castles in stone– with characteristic square keeps– that played both military and political roles. Royal castles were used to control key towns and the economically important forests, while baronial castles were used by the Norman lords to control their widespread estates. David I invited Anglo-Norman lords into Scotland in the early 12th century to help him colonise and control areas of his kingdom such as Galloway; the new lords brought castle technologies with them and wooden castles began to be established over the south of the kingdom. Following the Norman invasion of Ireland in the 1170s, under Henry II, castles were established there too.|$|E
5|$|Environmental impact studies {{began on}} the part of SR 125 south of SR 54 in 1987. In 1990, Caltrans {{proposed}} building the southern portion as a toll road, operated by private firms; California Transportation Ventures (CTV) and PrivaCAL both applied for the role. In September, state officials approved this proposal, which was expected to cost $400 million. In the 1991 agreement, Caltrans agreed not to <b>build</b> <b>more</b> than one high-occupancy vehicle lane in each direction on I-805 to reduce competition from SR 125. CTV soon declared that they would be considering many potential routings for the road, including some that Caltrans had declined. The next year, while the company hoped to start the environmental impact study, objections were raised about increased pollution and traffic from the road, as well as the part of the franchise agreement that would allow for the company to collect a settlement if SR 905 was constructed with more than six lanes, since it would compete with the proposed toll road.|$|E

5|$|In 1530, the Maltese islands {{along with}} the North African port city of Tripoli {{were given to the}} Order of Saint John by Emperor Charles V. The knights settled in the town of Birgu and made it their capital. Soon after their arrival, the Order rebuilt the Castrum Maris, calling it Fort Saint Angelo. Later on, the entire town of Birgu began to be {{surrounded}} by new fortifications, in a similar style to the Order's earlier defences in Rhodes. Birgu's land front was built by 1540. Following the attack of 1551, the Order realised the need to <b>build</b> <b>more</b> defences. Two forts were built in 1552 - Fort Saint Elmo {{at the tip of the}} Sciberras Peninsula, on the site of an Aragonese watchtower, and Fort Saint Michael on Isola. In 1553, a new fortified city began to be built around Fort Saint Michael, and it was named Senglea after the Grand Master who built it.|$|E
5|$|Players build a {{space station}} on a flat plane using tetromino-shaped floors that {{represent}} rooms. Rectangular workers generate the resources to <b>build</b> <b>more</b> spaces by working in these rooms. The workers occasionally must defend the base against attackers, who come in waves of increasing difficulty. The player can have the workers research four TMA-1-style monoliths for additional shield, speed, and generator upgrades. Rooms are used for special purposes: mineral mining (extractors), growing food (gardens), cooking it (kitchens), making workers (quarters), and creating power (reactors). The goal is to flourish and protect the station's inhabitants, but there are three concrete objectives: research all four monoliths, survive 28 waves, and research all monoliths in under 45 minutes. The game ends if all workers are killed. There is a tutorial, but no story. The player is not specifically told about the endgame goals.|$|E
5|$|Sabah's public {{infrastructure}} {{are still}} lagged behind mostly {{due to its}} geographical challenges as the second largest state in Malaysia. The Sabah Ministry of Infrastructure Development (formerly known as Ministry of Communication and Works) is responsible for all public infrastructure planning and development in the state. To narrow the development gap, the federal government are working to <b>build</b> <b>more</b> infrastructures and improve the already available one. In 2013, Sabah state government allocates RM1.583billion for infrastructure and public facilities development, of which the state were allocated another RM4.07billion {{by the federal government}} in 2015 Malaysian Budget. Since the Eight Malaysia Plan (8MP) until 2014, a total of RM11.115billion has been allocated for various infrastructure projects in the state.
