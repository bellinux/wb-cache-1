6000|$|It is {{difficult}} in the extreme {{to know exactly what}} is here meant. No doubt it is needless for a guide to drop a plumb-line down every crevasse that he has to cross.

60|$|This {{perversion}} is not {{the less}} fatal because the misrepresentation which give rise to it has what the artist considers a moral end. The thing for mankind to know is, not what are the motives and influences which the moralist thinks ought {{to act on the}} laborer or the artisan, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> motives and influences which do act on him. We want to be taught to feel, not for the heroic artisan or the sentimental peasant, but for the peasant in all his coarse apathy, and the artisan in all his suspicious selfishness.|$|E

6000|$|It {{would appear}} that this {{infiltration}} of Foraminifera shells with Glauconite does not take place at great depths, but rather {{in what may be}} termed a sublittoral region, ranging from a hundred to three hundred fathoms. It cannot be ascribed to any local cause, for it takes place, not only over large areas in the Gulf of Mexico and the Coast of Florida, but in the South Atlantic and in the Pacific. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> conditions which determine its occurrence, and whence the silex, the iron, and the alumina (with perhaps potash and some other ingredients in small quantity) of which the Glauconite is composed, proceed, is a point on which no light has yet been thrown. For the present we must be content with the fact that, in certain areas of the [...] "intermediate zone," [...] greensand is replacing and representing the primitively calcareo- silicious ooze.|$|E

6000|$|Again, it {{is claimed}} that {{the words of the}} Constitution are conclusive, and that the {{declaration}} that the publications of the Society shall be such as are [...] "satisfactory to all Evangelical Christians" [...] forbids by implication the issuing of any tract which could possibly offend the brethren in Slave States. The Society, it is argued, can publish only on topics about which all Evangelical Christians are agreed, and must, therefore, avoid everything in which the question of politics is involved. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> facts about matters other than Slavery? Tracts have been issued and circulated in which Dancing is condemned as sinful; are all Evangelical Christians agreed about this? On the Temperance question, against Catholicism,--have these topics never entered into our politics? The simple truth is that Slavery is the only subject about which the Publishing Committee have felt Constitutional scruples. Till this question arose, they were like men in perfect health, never suspecting that they had any constitution at all; but now, like hypochondriacs, they feel it in every pore, at the least breath from the eastward.|$|E
60|$|Now here we find {{ourselves}} confronted with an amazing fact. When, in the past, opinions so arguable have been enforced by State violence, it {{has been at the}} instigation of fanatics who held them for fixed and flaming certainties. If truths could not be evaded by their enemies, neither could they be altered even by their friends. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> certain truths that the secular arm must now lift the sword to enforce? Why, they are that very mass of bottomless questions and bewildered answers that we have been studying in the last chapters--questions whose only interest is that they are trackless and mysterious; answers whose only glory is that they are tentative and new. The devotee boasted that he would never abandon the faith; and therefore he persecuted for the faith. But the doctor of science actually boasts that he will always abandon a hypothesis; and yet he persecutes for the hypothesis. The Inquisitor violently enforced his creed, because it was unchangeable. The savant enforces it violently because he may change it the next day.|$|E
6000|$|... § 1. There are {{two kinds}} of sociological inquiry. In the first kind, the {{question}} proposed is, what effect will follow from a given cause, a certain general condition of social circumstances being presupposed. As, for example, what would be the effect of imposing or of repealing corn laws, of abolishing monarchy or introducing universal suffrage, in the present condition of society and civilization in any European country, or under any other given supposition with regard to the circumstances of society in general, without reference to the changes which might take place, or which may already be in progress, in those circumstances. But there is also a second inquiry, namely, what are the laws which determine those general circumstances themselves. In this last the question is, not what will be the effect of a given cause in a certain state of society, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> causes which produce, and the phenomena which characterize, states of society generally. In the solution of this question consists the general Science of Society; by which the conclusions of the other and more special kind of inquiry must be limited and controlled.|$|E
