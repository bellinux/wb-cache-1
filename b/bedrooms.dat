5|$|The late 18th {{century was}} a period of change in the {{interior}} design of English country houses. The Baroque concept of the principal floor, or piano nobile, with a large bedroom suite known as the state apartments, was gradually abandoned in favour of smaller, more private <b>bedrooms</b> on the upper floors. The principal floor became a series of reception rooms, each with a designated purpose, creating separate withdrawing, dining, music, and ballrooms. In the late-18th century, it became common to arrange reception and public rooms on a lower floor, with <b>bedrooms</b> and more private rooms above. West Wycombe perfectly reflects this arrangement.|$|E
50|$|The private rooms {{comprise}} a master <b>bedroom</b> and second <b>bedroom</b> opening off the central hall, and a side passage leading west {{from the central}} hallway to the dressing room, bathroom, and another <b>bedroom.</b> A small <b>bedroom</b> at {{the northwest corner of}} the house is accessed from the now enclosed rear verandah. There is another room, possibly a former <b>bedroom,</b> which also opens off the back verandah, but has been modified substantially.|$|R

5|$|Palladio {{would often}} model his villa {{elevations}} on Roman temple facades. The temple influence, {{often in a}} cruciform design, later became a trademark of his work. Palladian villas are usually built with three floors: a rusticated basement or ground floor, containing the service and minor rooms. Above this, the piano nobile accessed through a portico reached by a flight of external steps, containing the principal reception and <b>bedrooms,</b> and above it is a low mezzanine floor with secondary <b>bedrooms</b> and accommodation. The proportions of each room within the villa were calculated on simple mathematical ratios like 3:4 and 4:5, and the different rooms within the house were interrelated by these ratios. Earlier architects had used these formulas for balancing a single symmetrical facade; however, Palladio's designs related to the whole, usually square, villa.|$|E
