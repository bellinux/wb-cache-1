5|$|A {{midazolam}} overdose {{is considered}} a medical emergency and generally requires the immediate attention of medical personnel. <b>Benzodiazepine</b> overdose in healthy individuals is rarely life-threatening with proper medical support; however, the toxicity of benzodiazepines increases when they are combined with other CNS depressants such as alcohol, opioids, or tricyclic antidepressants. The toxicity of <b>benzodiazepine</b> overdose and risk of death is also increased in the elderly and those with obstructive pulmonary disease or when used intravenously. Treatment is supportive; activated charcoal can be used {{within an hour of}} the overdose. The antidote for an overdose of midazolam (or any other <b>benzodiazepine)</b> is flumazenil. While effective in reversing the effects of benzodiazepines it is not used in most cases as it may trigger seizures in mixed overdoses and <b>benzodiazepine</b> dependent individuals.|$|E
5|$|The <b>benzodiazepine</b> {{class of}} drugs also {{interact}} with peripheral <b>benzodiazepine</b> receptors. Peripheral <b>benzodiazepine</b> receptors {{are present in}} peripheral nervous system tissues, glial cells, {{and to a lesser}} extent the central nervous system. These peripheral receptors are not structurally related or coupled to GABAA receptors. They modulate the immune system and are involved in the body response to injury. Benzodiazepines also function as weak adenosine reuptake inhibitors. It has been suggested that some of their anticonvulsant, anxiolytic, and muscle relaxant effects may be in part mediated by this action.|$|E
5|$|A <b>benzodiazepine</b> {{dependence}} {{occurs in}} {{about one-third of}} individuals who are treated with benzodiazepines for longer than 4 weeks, which typically results in tolerance and <b>benzodiazepine</b> withdrawal syndrome when the dose is reduced too rapidly. Midazolam infusions may induce tolerance and a withdrawal syndrome {{in a matter of}} days. The risk factors for dependence include dependent personality, use of a <b>benzodiazepine</b> that is short-acting, high potency and long-term use of benzodiazepines. Withdrawal symptoms from midazolam can range from insomnia and anxiety to seizures and psychosis. Withdrawal symptoms can sometimes resemble a person’s underlying condition. Gradual reduction of midazolam after regular use can minimise withdrawal and rebound effects. Tolerance and the resultant withdrawal syndrome may be due to receptor down-regulation and GABAA receptor alterations in gene expression, which causes long-term changes in the function of the GABAergic neuronal system.|$|E
25|$|In a {{retrospective}} study of deaths, when <b>benzodiazepines</b> were {{implicated in the}} deaths, the <b>benzodiazepines</b> nitrazepam and flunitrazepam were the most common <b>benzodiazepines</b> involved. <b>Benzodiazepines</b> were a factor in all deaths related to drug addiction {{in this study of}} causes of deaths. Nitrazepam and flunitrazepam were significantly more commonly implicated in suicide related deaths than natural deaths. In four of the cases <b>benzodiazepines</b> alone were the only cause of death. In Australia, nitrazepam and temazepam were the <b>benzodiazepines</b> most commonly detected in overdose drug related deaths. In a third of cases <b>benzodiazepines</b> were the sole cause of death.|$|R
25|$|<b>Benzodiazepines</b> {{can cause}} serious {{addiction}} problems. A survey of doctors in Senegal {{found that many}} doctors feel that their training and knowledge of <b>benzodiazepines</b> is, in general, poor; a study in Dakar found that almost one-fifth of doctors ignored prescribing guidelines regarding short-term use of <b>benzodiazepines,</b> and almost three-quarters of doctors regarded their training and knowledge of <b>benzodiazepines</b> to be inadequate. More training regarding <b>benzodiazepines</b> has been recommended for doctors. Due to the serious concerns of addiction, national governments were recommended to urgently seek to raise knowledge via training about the addictive nature of <b>benzodiazepines</b> and appropriate prescribing of <b>benzodiazepines.</b>|$|R

5|$|Alprazolam, {{like other}} benzodiazepines, binds to {{specific}} {{sites on the}} GABAA (gamma-amino-butyric acid) receptor. When bound to these sites, which {{are referred to as}} <b>benzodiazepine</b> receptors, it modulates the effect of GABAA receptors and, thus, of GABAergic neurons. Long-term use causes adaptive changes in the <b>benzodiazepine</b> receptors, making them less sensitive to stimulation and thus making the drugs less potent.|$|E
5|$|Midazolam, {{when taken}} during the third {{trimester}} of pregnancy, may cause risk to the neonate, including <b>benzodiazepine</b> withdrawal syndrome, with possible symptoms including hypotonia, apnoeic spells, cyanosis, and impaired metabolic responses to cold stress. Symptoms of hypotonia and the neonatal <b>benzodiazepine</b> withdrawal syndrome {{have been reported to}} persist from hours to months after birth. Other neonatal withdrawal symptoms include hyperexcitability, tremor, and gastrointestinal upset (diarrhea or vomiting). Breastfeeding by mothers using midazolam is not recommended.|$|E
5|$|Alprazolam is classed as a high-potency triazolobenzodiazepine: a <b>benzodiazepine</b> with a {{triazole}} ring {{attached to}} its structure. As a <b>benzodiazepine,</b> alprazolam produces {{a variety of}} therapeutic and adverse effects by binding to the <b>benzodiazepine</b> receptor site on the GABAA receptor and modulating its function; GABA receptors are the most prolific inhibitory receptor within the brain. The GABA chemical and receptor system mediates inhibitory or calming effects of alprazolam on the nervous system. The GABAA receptor {{is made up of}} 5 subunits out of a possible 19, and GABAA receptors made up of different combinations of subunits have different properties, different locations within the brain, and, importantly, different activities with regard to benzodiazepines. Alprazolam and other triazolobenzodiazepines like triazolam that have a triazol ring attached to their structure appear to have antidepressant properties, since the structure resembles that of tricyclic antidepressants, which also have rings. Alprazolam causes a marked suppression of the hypothalamicpituitary-adrenal axis. The therapeutic properties of alprazolam are similar to other benzodiazepines and include anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, muscle relaxant, hypnotic and amnesic; however, it is used mainly as an anxiolytic.|$|E

25|$|Long-term use of <b>benzodiazepines</b> {{leads to}} {{increasing}} {{physical and mental}} health problems, and as a result, discontinuation is recommended for many long-term users. The withdrawal syndrome from <b>benzodiazepines</b> can range from a mild and short-lasting syndrome to a prolonged and severe syndrome. Withdrawal symptoms can lead to continued use of <b>benzodiazepines</b> for many years, long after the original reason for taking <b>benzodiazepines</b> has passed. Many patients know that the <b>benzodiazepines</b> no longer work for them but are unable to discontinue <b>benzodiazepines</b> because of withdrawal symptoms.|$|R
50|$|In {{studies in}} Sweden, {{flunitrazepam}} was the second-most-common drug used in suicides, being found in about 16% of cases. In a retrospective Swedish study of 1587 deaths, in 159 cases <b>benzodiazepines</b> were found. In suicides when <b>benzodiazepines</b> were implicated, the <b>benzodiazepines</b> flunitrazepam and nitrazepam were occurring in significantly higher concentrations, compared to natural deaths. In 4 of the 159 cases, where <b>benzodiazepines</b> were found, <b>benzodiazepines</b> alone {{were the only}} cause of death. It was concluded that flunitrazepam and nitrazepam might be more toxic than other <b>benzodiazepines.</b>|$|R
5|$|Benzodiazepines {{cross the}} placenta, enter the fetus, {{and are also}} {{excreted}} in breast milk. Chronic administration of diazepam, another <b>benzodiazepine,</b> to nursing mothers {{has been reported to}} cause their infants to become lethargic and to lose weight.|$|E
5|$|Clonazepam, a <b>benzodiazepine</b> is used {{to treat}} many forms of parasomnia. Rapid eye {{movement}} behavior disorder responds well to low doses of clonazepam. Restless legs syndrome can be treated using clonazepam as a third line treatment option {{as the use of}} clonazepam is still investigational.|$|E
5|$|Nonbenzodiazepines are {{contraindicated}} during <b>benzodiazepine</b> withdrawal as {{they are}} cross tolerant with benzodiazepines and can induce dependence. Alcohol is also cross tolerant with benzodiazepines and more toxic and thus caution is needed to avoid replacing one dependence with another. During withdrawal, fluoroquinolone-based antibiotics are best avoided if possible; they displace benzodiazepines from their binding site and reduce GABA function and, thus, may aggravate withdrawal symptoms. Antipsychotics are not recommended for <b>benzodiazepine</b> withdrawal (or other CNS depressant withdrawal states) especially clozapine, olanzapine or low potency phenothiazines e.g. chlorpromazine as they lower the seizure threshold and can worsen withdrawal effects; if used extreme caution is required.|$|E

500|$|<b>Benzodiazepines</b> {{enhance the}} effect of the {{neurotransmitter}} gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) at the GABAA receptor, resulting in sedative, hypnotic (sleep-inducing), anxiolytic (anti-anxiety), anticonvulsant, and muscle relaxant properties. High doses of many shorter-acting <b>benzodiazepines</b> may also cause [...] anterograde amnesia and dissociation. These properties make <b>benzodiazepines</b> useful in treating anxiety, insomnia, agitation, seizures, muscle spasms, alcohol withdrawal and as a premedication for medical or dental procedures. <b>Benzodiazepines</b> are categorized as either short-, intermediate-, or long-acting. Short- and intermediate-acting <b>benzodiazepines</b> are preferred for the treatment of insomnia; longer-acting <b>benzodiazepines</b> are recommended for the treatment of anxiety.|$|R
5|$|Substance misuse, {{dependence}} and withdrawal {{are associated with}} self-harm. <b>Benzodiazepine</b> dependence as well as <b>benzodiazepine</b> withdrawal is associated with self-harming behaviour in young people. Alcohol is a major risk factor for self-harm. A study which analysed self-harm presentations to emergency rooms in Northern Ireland found that alcohol was a major contributing factor and involved in 63.8% of self-harm presentations. A recent study in the relation between cannabis use and deliberate self-harm (DSH) in Norway and England found that, in general, cannabis use {{may not be a}} specific risk factor for DSH in young adolescents.|$|E

5|$|The {{short-term}} use of benzodiazepines adversely affects multiple {{areas of}} cognition, {{the most notable}} one being that it interferes with the formation and consolidation of memories of new material and may induce complete anterograde amnesia. However, researchers hold contrary opinions regarding the effects of long-term administration. One view {{is that many of}} the short-term effects continue into the long-term and may even worsen, and are not resolved after stopping <b>benzodiazepine</b> usage. Another view maintains that cognitive deficits in chronic <b>benzodiazepine</b> users occur only for a short period after the dose, or that the anxiety disorder is the cause of these deficits.|$|E
40|$|<b>Benzodiazepines</b> act on {{the central}} nervous system and can be {{prescribed}} for various medical conditions. They are usually classified by their duration of action. Patients using long-term <b>benzodiazepines</b> are at risk of dependence and tolerance. <b>Benzodiazepines</b> may also worsen or mask symptoms of depression and may cause cognitive and psychomotor impairment. Therefore, <b>benzodiazepines</b> should not be prescribed {{in the absence of a}} clear indication.

25|$|Concurrent use of {{buprenorphine}} {{with other}} CNS depressants (such as alcohol or <b>benzodiazepines)</b> is contraindicated {{as it may}} lead to fatal respiratory depression. <b>Benzodiazepines,</b> in recommended doses, are not contraindicated in individuals tolerant to either opioids or <b>benzodiazepines.</b>|$|R

5|$|They can be {{very useful}} in {{intensive}} care to sedate patients receiving mechanical ventilation or those in extreme distress.

5|$|A <b>benzodiazepine</b> can {{be placed}} into one of three groups by its {{elimination}} half-life, or {{time it takes for}} the body to eliminate half of the dose. Some benzodiazepines have long-acting active metabolites, such as diazepam and chlordiazepoxide, which are metabolised into desmethyldiazepam. Desmethyldiazepam has a half-life of 36–200 hours, and flurazepam, with the main active metabolite of desalkylflurazepam, with a half-life of 40–250 hours. These long-acting metabolites are partial agonists.|$|E
5|$|A major {{disadvantage}} of benzodiazepines that tolerance to therapeutic effects develops relatively quickly while many adverse effects persist. Tolerance develops to hypnotic and myorelexant effects within days to weeks, and to anticonvulsant and anxiolytic effects within weeks to months. Therefore, benzodiazepines {{are unlikely to}} be effective long-term treatments for sleep and anxiety. While BZD therapeutic effects disappear with tolerance, depression and impulsivity with high suicidal risk commonly persist. Several studies have confirmed that long-term benzodiazepines are not significantly different from placebo for sleep or anxiety. This may explain why patients commonly increase doses over time and many eventually take more than one type of <b>benzodiazepine</b> after the first loses effectiveness. Additionally, because tolerance to <b>benzodiazepine</b> sedating effects develops more quickly than does tolerance to brainstem depressant effects, those taking more benzodiazepines to achieve desired effects may suffer sudden respiratory depression, hypotension or death. Most patients with anxiety disorders and PTSD have symptoms that persist for at least several months, making tolerance to therapeutic effects a distinct problem for them and necessitating the need for more effective long-term treatment (e.g., psychotherapy, serotonergic antidepressants).|$|E

40|$|<b>Benzodiazepines</b> are {{the most}} {{commonly}} prescribed group of psychotherapeutic pharmaceuticals {{on a global scale}} and have been on the market since the 1960 s. <b>Benzodiazepines</b> remain in the aqueous effluent from sewage treatment plants and have been found in natural aquatic environments. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate if there is <b>benzodiazepines</b> in natural sediment from Lake Ekoln situated downstream River Fyris in Uppsala, where previous studies have detected high concentrations in the water. The study tested following hypotheses: (1) <b>benzodiazepines</b> are accumulating in sediments; and (2) breakdown of <b>benzodiazepines</b> is slow in sediment resulting in them being preserved in sediments that are several years/decades old. An extraction method for sediment was developed followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry for analysis of oxazepam, alprazolam, clonazepam, flunitrazepam, diazepam and prazepam. All investigated <b>benzodiazepines</b> occurred in the sediment of Lake Ekoln; hence, in line with hypothesis 1, <b>benzodiazepines</b> are accumulating in natural sediments. Further, all <b>benzodiazepines</b> were found in the upper 10 cm of the sediment and oxazepam, clonazepam and diazepam was found at depth below 20 cm, corresponding to an age of more than 20 years indicating that <b>benzodiazepines</b> resists degradation processes in sediment and are persistent for decades as predicted by hypothesis 2. To my knowledge this is the first study demonstrating that <b>benzodiazepines</b> are accumulated and preserved in natural sediments...|$|R

5|$|Alprazolam {{and other}} benzodiazepines may also cause the {{development}} of physical dependence, tolerance, and <b>benzodiazepine</b> withdrawal symptoms during rapid dose reduction or cessation of therapy after long-term treatment.

5|$|Alprazolam {{was first}} {{released}} by Upjohn (now {{a part of}} Pfizer) in 1981. The first approved use was of panic disorder, and within two years of its original marketing, Xanax became a blockbuster drug in the US. As of 2010, alprazolam is the most prescribed and the most misused <b>benzodiazepine</b> in the US. The potential for misuse among those taking it for medical reasons is controversial, with some expert reviews stating that the risk is low and {{similar to that of}} other <b>benzodiazepine</b> drugs. Others state that there is a substantial risk of misuse and dependence in both patients and non-medical users and that the high affinity binding, high potency, short elimination half-life, and rapid onset of action may increase the misuse potential of alprazolam. Compared to the large number of prescriptions, relatively few individuals increase their dose on their own initiative or engage in drug-seeking behavior. Alprazolam is classified as a Schedule IV controlled substance by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).|$|E
5|$|Although {{antidepressants}} with anxiolytic properties {{have been}} introduced, {{and there is}} increasing awareness of the adverse effects of benzodiazepines, prescriptions for short-term anxiety relief have not significantly dropped. For treatment of insomnia, benzodiazepines are now less popular than nonbenzodiazepines, which include zolpidem, zaleplon and eszopiclone. Nonbenzodiazepines are molecularly distinct, but nonetheless, they work on the same <b>benzodiazepine</b> receptors and produce similar sedative effects.|$|E
