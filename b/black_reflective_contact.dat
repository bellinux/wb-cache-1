40|$|A tandem device by {{stacking}} a normally <b>black</b> <b>reflective</b> {{liquid crystal}} display (NB-RLCD) and an organic light-emitting device (OLED) is demonstrated which can be operated under bright and dark ambient by switching between the two modes. The vertically integrated architecture increases the aperture ratio, brightness and resolution of the display. The normally black characteristic of the RLCD serves a function to increase the ambient contrast ratio (A-CR) under OLED mode operation. Under NB-RLCD mode operation, a high A-CR over 40 : 1 was obtained. Besides, a microlens array is embedded to the device for improving the viewing angle of the RLCD (CR> 2 : 1 over 55 o viewing cone) and enhancing (44 %) the external quantum efficiency of the OLED. 1...|$|R

Results obtained from social intervention programs using the arts, including music (Tunstall 2012) and literature (Trounstine & Waxler 2008) indicate {{this is the}} case.

I will examine the outcomes obtained in light of proposals made by philosopher Miranda Fricker on epistemic injustice (2007), and Byung-Chul Han on the social and neural roots of neurological illness such as depression, {{attention deficit hyperactivity disorder}} (ADHD), borderline personality disorder (BDO) and burnout syndrome today (2010).
