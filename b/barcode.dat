However, the scarcity of tools used for searching the booming reference database becomes an obstacle, currently with BLAST as the only practical choice.

40|$|DNA <b>barcoding</b> (using a {{standardized}} {{sequence of the}} mitochondrial CO 1 gene) {{was used to determine}} the aquatic insect species richness of two sites along White Clay Creek in Pennsylvania. Water quality assessment at the sites did not change from good (14. 6, previous MAIS score 13. 2) and fair (9. 4, earlier MAIS 7. 3), but <b>barcoding</b> increased the species richness and provided a much more detailed analysis by detecting cryptic species. Aquatic insect identifications by an amateur biologist and by expert taxonomists using traditional methods based on morphology were compared to DNA <b>barcoding.</b> The amateur biologist’s identifications were limited to order and family while expert taxonomists were able to identify 44 different species and DNA <b>barcoding</b> indicated 128 different species. 84 % of the 1786 specimens that were submitted for <b>barcoding</b> generated a successful DNA sequence. DNA <b>barcoding</b> revealed the presence of more species than expert taxonomists identified as shown in the following listing of insect orders with comparison of numbers of species identified by expert taxonomists and DNA barcoding: Diptera (23 expert spp. and 128 <b>barcoding</b> spp.), Ephemeroptera (6 expert spp. and 16 <b>barcoding</b> spp.), Plecoptera (0 expert spp. and 6 <b>barcoding</b> spp), Trichoptera (9 expert spp. and 14 <b>barcoding</b> spp), and Coleoptera (6 expert spp. and 6 <b>barcoding</b> spp). Station 12 had an overall higher species richness and abundance of Chironomidae; Chironomids accounted for 63 % of the specimens with 64 species. Chironomids made up only 30 % of the specimens at Station 11 and EPT richness was higher. The increase in the abundance and species richness of Chironomidae at Station 12 supported the previous findings of a lower water quality than that occurring at Station 11. <b>Barcoding,</b> when combined with traditional aquatic macroinvertebrate sampling, provides the most accurate and cost effective method to determine the water quality of fresh water ecosystems...|$|R

40|$|Several {{different}} <b>barcoding</b> {{methods of}} distinguishing {{species have been}} advanced, but which method is the best is still controversial. Chlorella is becoming particularly promising {{in the development of}} second-generation biofuels. However, the taxonomy of Chlorella-like organisms is easily confused. Here we report a comprehensive <b>barcoding</b> analysis of Chlorella-like species from Chlorella, Chloroidium, Dictyosphaerium and Actinastrum based on rbcL, ITS, tufA and 16 S sequences to test the efficiency of traditional <b>barcoding,</b> GMYC, ABGD, PTP, P ID and character-based <b>barcoding</b> methods. First of all, the <b>barcoding</b> results gave new insights into the taxonomic assessment of Chlorella-like organisms studied, including the clear species discrimination and resolution of potentially cryptic species complexes in C. sorokiniana, D. ehrenbergianum and C. Vulgaris. The tufA proved to be the most efficient <b>barcoding</b> locus, which thus could be as potential "specific barcode" for Chlorella-like species. The 16 S failed in discriminating most closely related species. The resolution of GMYC, PTP, P ID, ABGD and character-based <b>barcoding</b> methods were variable among rbcL, ITS and tufA genes. The best resolution for species differentiation appeared in tufA analysis where GMYC, PTP, ABGD and character-based approaches produced consistent groups while the PTP method over-split the taxa. The character analysis of rbcL, ITS and tufA sequences could clearly distinguish all taxonomic groups respectively, including the potentially cryptic lineages, with many character attributes. Thus, the character-based <b>barcoding</b> provides an attractive complement to coalescent and distance-based <b>barcoding.</b> Our study represents the test that proves the efficiency of multiple DNA <b>barcoding</b> in species discrimination of microalgaes...|$|R

40|$|Cellular <b>barcoding</b> is a significant, {{recently}} developed, biotechnology {{tool that}} enables the familial identification of progeny of individual cells in vivo.

With a view to overcoming this limitation, we propose a new design for a genetic <b>barcoding</b> construct based on the Cre Lox system that induces randomly created stable <b>barcodes</b> in cells in situ by exploiting inherent sequence distance constraints during site-specific recombination. Leveraging this previously unused feature, we identify the cassette with maximal code diversity.
