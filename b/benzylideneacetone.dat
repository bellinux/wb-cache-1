5000|$|The {{organometallic}} compound (benzylideneacetone)iron tricarbonyl is a reagent for transferring the Fe(CO)3 unit to other organic molecules.

40|$|<b>Benzylideneacetone</b> {{has been}} {{subjected}} to the Schmidt reaction in sulphuric acid under various conditions, and the only amide isolated was N-methylcinnamamide. Benzylideneacetons p-methoxy-, p-nitro- and m-nitro-benzylideneacetones were subjected to the Schmidt reaction in hydrochloric acid and in polyphosphoric acid. In hydrochloric acid each ketone gave a good yield of the N-methylcinnamamide. In polyphosphoric acid the nitrobenzylideneacetones gave a mixture of the N-styrylacetamide and the N-methylcinnamamide, <b>benzylideneacetone</b> gave mainly N-methylcinnamamide, only a trace of N-styrylacetamide being isolated in some runs of shortened duration, and the N-methylcinnamamide was the only amide isolated from p-methoxybenzyl-ideneacetone. The formation of aniline and p-anisidine during the reactions of <b>benzylideneacetone</b> and p-methoxybenzylidene-acetone in polyphosphoric acid has been explained. A mechanism has been proposed to explain the exclusive production of the N-methylcinnamamides in hydrochloric acid, and the novel variation of the amide ratio with solvent observed in the reactions with the nitrobenzylideneacetones. The Beckmann rearrangements of the alpha-oximes of <b>benzylideneacetone,</b> p-nitro- and m-nitro-benzylideneacetones have been re-examined. Methyl vinyl ketone, methyl isopropenyl ketone and mesityl oxide were subjected to Schmidt reaction conditions in hydrochloric acid. Ammonia was isolated from each reaction and, in addition methyl vinyl ketone gave diacetyl, methyl isopropenyl ketone gave methyl ethyl ketone, and mesityl oxide gave methylamine and acetone. Addition of hydrazoic acid to the olefinic bond of the ketones yielded azidoketones, decomposition of which in acids gave ammonia in each case, diacetyl and ethylenediamine from the azide of methyl vinyl ketone, shown to be 1 -azidobutan- 3 -one, and methylamine from the azide of mesityl oxide.

The reaction with <b>benzylideneacetone</b> leads initially to [OsH 2 (η 5 -C 5 H 5) {κ 1 -OC(CH 3) CH=CHPh}-(P iPr 3) ]BF 4 (3), which in dichloromethane {{is converted to}} the hydroxyallyl derivative [OsH-(η 5 -C 5 H 5) {η 3 -CH 2 C(OH) CHCH 2 Ph}(PiPr 3) ]BF 4 (4). Complex 4 releases 4 -phenylbutan- 2 -one, and the resulting metallic fragment activates a Cβ(sp 2) -H bond of a new molecule of <b>benzylideneacetone</b> to give [OsH(η 5 -C 5 H 5) {C(Ph) CHC(O) CH 3 }(PiPr 3) ]BF 4 (5), which affords Os(η 5 -C 5 H 5) {C(Ph) CHC(O) CH 3 }(PiPr 3) (6) by deprotonation with NaOCH 3. The reaction of 2 with methyl vinyl ketone gives ethyl methyl ketone and [OsH(η 5 -C 5 H 5) {CHCHC(O) -CH 3 }(PiPr 3) ]BF 4 (9).

30|$|Electroplating is {{a widely}} used {{technique}} to protect metal pieces from corrosion. There are different types of electroplating systems. Chromium electroplating and anodizing tanks are among the largest sources of chromium emissions in the USA. However, the use of zinc in electroplating baths is also widespread. The monitoring of additives in electrolytic baths is a fundamental task for proper coatings. <b>Benzylideneacetone</b> (BDA), benzoic acid (BA), and polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG 400) are easily found among the additives used in zinc baths (Barriola et al. 2012).

Results indicate that BA modifies the exchange current densities of zinc and cobalt such that the alloy is electrodeposited via a normal codeposition mechanism. Analysis of the deposits by Auger spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction shows that BA increases the cobalt concentration in the electrodeposited alloys and gives deposits with a constant concentration profile of both Zn and Co. BA also inhibits the formation of zinc hydroxide in the initial deposition stages, which supports the proposed mechanism of normal codeposition.

Kinetic studies and in situ spectroscopic anal. have provided a detailed insight into the reaction. Progress kinetic anal. demonstrated that neither catalyst decompn. nor product inhibition occurred during the catalysis. The reaction is first order in the palladium and aryl iodide, and zero order in the activated alkene, N-​heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligand, and DIPEA.

40|$|BYZX, [(E) - 2 -(4 -((diethylamino) methyl) benzylidene) - 5, 6 -dimethoxy- 2, 3 -dihydroinden-one], {{belongs to}} a series of novel {{acetylcholinesterase}} inhibitors and has been synthesized as a new chemical entity for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease symptoms. When incubated with human liver microsomes (HLMs), BYZX was rapidly transformed into its metabolites M 1, M 2, and M 3. The chemical structures of these metabolites were identified using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance, which indicated that M 1 was an N-desethylated and C=C hydrogenation metabolite of BYZX. M 2 and M 3 were 2 precursor metabolites, which resulted from the hydrogenation and desethylation of BYZX, respectively. Further studies with chemical inhibitors and human recombinant cytochrome P 450 s (CYPs), and correlation studies were performed. The results indicated that the N-desethylation of BYZX and M 2 was mediated by CYP 3 A 4 and CYP 2 C 8. The reduced form of b-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide 29 -phosphate was involved in the hydrogenation of BYZX and M 3, and this reaction occurred in the HLMs and in the human liver cytosol. The hydrogenation reaction was not inhibited by any chemical inhibitors of CYPs, but it was significantly inhibited by some substrates of a,b-ketoalkene C=C reductases and their inhibitors such as <b>benzylideneacetone,</b> dicoumarol, and indomethacin.

A study of the adsorption of additive molecules onto a Fe electrode surface at the open circuit potential (EOCP) using a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) disclosed that both PEG 200 and PEG 200 /BDA were adsorbed on the electrode, with a higher mass increase being observed for the system with PEG 200 /BDA. Cyclic voltammetry showed that the adsorption of PEG 200 /BDA partially inhibited the electroreduction of Zn at E =- 1. 12 V vs. SCE. This inhibition caused {{an increase in the}} overpotential for the discharge of Zn(II) ions, resulting in two reduction processes with different energies. A study of the reduction kinetics revealed that for both the PEG 200 and PEG 200 /BDA systems, the adsorption of additive molecules onto the electrode surface caused a decrease in the exchange current density (i 0), which made the kinetics of the process slower. When PEG 200 or PEG 200 /BDA was present in the electrolytic bath, the values of αc were slightly lower; this effect is associated with differences in the morphologies of coatings grown in the presence of additive molecules. The coatings grown {{in the presence of the}} PEG 200 /BDA additive mixture were compact, smooth and shiny materials comprised of flakes grouped in hemispherical clusters of uniform size...|$|E

The hydride ligand of 2 is fairly acidic. Thus, its treatment with sodium methoxide produces the deprotonation of the metal center to give Os{CHCHC(O) CH 3 } 2 (PiPr 3) 2 (3). The reaction is not reversible; the protonation of 3 with HBF 4 ·OEt 2 leads to [Os{CHCHC(O) CH 3 } {=CHCH 2 C(=O) CH 3 } (PiPr 3) 2]BF 4 (4), which in dichloromethane is unstable and evolves into [Os{CHCHC(O) CH 3 } Cl{≡CCH=C(CH 3) OH} (PiPr 3) 2]BF 4 (5), containing an enolcarbyne ligand. In the solid state the anion of 5 is associated with the OH-hydrogen of the enol, by means of an H⋯F hydrogen bond.
