40|$|This paper extends {{previous}} {{work on the}} fluidization regimes of the <b>bottom</b> <b>bed</b> of circulating flyidized bed (CFB) boilers. Pressure measurements were performed to obtain the time-average <b>bottom</b> <b>bed</b> voidage and to study the bed pressure fluctuations. The measurements were carried out in a 12 MWth CFB boiler operated at 850 °C and also under ambient conditions (40 °C). Two bubbling regimes were identified: a “single bubble regime” with large single bubbles present at low fluidization velocities, and, at high fluidization velocities, an “exploding bubble regime” with bubbles often stretching {{all the way from}} the air distributor to the surface of the <b>bottom</b> <b>bed.</b> The exploding bubble regime results in a high through-flow of gas, indirectly seen from the low average voidage of the <b>bottom</b> <b>bed,</b> which is similar to that of a stationary fluidized bed boiler, despite the higher gas velocities in the CFB boiler. Methods to determine the fluidization velocity at the transition from the single to the exploding bubble regime are proposed and discussed.

40|$|Characterization {{by means}} of Kolmogorov entropy shows that the {{dynamics}} of the <b>bottom</b> <b>bed</b> in small size circulating fluidized bed risers are significantly different from {{the dynamics of the}} dense <b>bottom</b> <b>bed</b> in large size risers and, as a consequence, two types of circulating regimes are introduced: the exploding bubble bed for large risers and the circulating ‘slugging’ bed for small risers, the latter at high superficial gas velocities. In a pictorial fluidization diagram ten gas—solid fluidization regimes are given, seven of which are experimentally identified with the Kolmogorov entropy by varying the superficial gas velocity, riser solids holdup and diameter (or width) of the riser: bubbling bed, slugging bed, exploding bubble bed, intermediate turbulent bed, circulating ‘slugging’ bed, intermediate dilute flow, and dilute transport flow. No transition could be identified between the exploding bubble bed at captive conditions and the exploding bubble bed at circulating conditions in the dense <b>bottom</b> <b>bed</b> of the two largest facilities in this study. This suggests that the dense <b>bottom</b> <b>bed</b> in large size risers can be considered as a bubbling bed. A turbulent bed was found in none of the facilities of this study with the Geldart B solids used. As well as by the Kolmogorov entropy (chaos analysis), the hydrodynamics have been characterized by amplitude of pressure fluctuations, while a solids distribution analysis has also been carried out. The study has been made in four (circulating) fluidized beds of different size and design, all operated with 0. 30 mm silica sand. The dimensions of the fluidized bed risers are 1. 47 × 1. 42 × 13. 5 m, 0. 70 × 0. 12 × 8. 5 m, 0. 12 m i. d. × 5. 8 m, and 0. 083 m i. d. × 4. 0 m...|$|E

It is found that the <b>bottom</b> <b>bed</b> of boilers is operated in a bubbling regime even at high gas velocities, accompanied by a tall splash zone, {{as long as there is}} sufficient bed material in the system. It is shown that conventional circulating fluidized bed boilers operate in a dilute suspension mode.

40|$|A {{model for}} gas phase mixing in {{fluidized}} bed boiler furnaces is presented. The model takes its basis in {{a description of}} the dynamics of the dense <b>bottom</b> <b>bed</b> which strongly govern the gas mixing up through the furnace. Thus, a time-resolved approach is used to link the modeling to the physics of the underlying processes determining the gas mixing. As output, the model gives the fluctuating flux of gas species, in contrast to the classical modeling approach which is limited to time-averaged gas fluxes. Such a dynamical approach allows assumption of the volatile combustion system as transport-controlled which avoids complete consumption of either oxygen or combustible gases in each modeled cell. Thus, the time-resolved analysis employed enables application of a realistic criterion for the mixing such as that reactants can coincide in both space and time in order to react. While fitting of kinetics is strongly dependent on the system and operational conditions, the present model integrates key system variables such as the <b>bottom</b> <b>bed</b> height and the characteristic pressure-drop constant over the primary air distributor, allowing application of transport-controlled (i. e. infinitely fast kinetics) volatile combustion. The model of the <b>bottom</b> <b>bed</b> divides the gas flow into two phases, a throughflow and an emulsion gas, and calculates their respective fluctuations in velocity and composition. Having these, in-furnace gas probe measurements can be simulated and compared with in-situ gas suction probe measurements, i. e. the probe signal is modeled. Such an approach is crucial in fluidized bed-boilers furnaces since in-situ gas probe measurements in regions with high fluctuations in gas velocity lead to results which are biased towards reducing conditions. Model results, including simulation of the gas suction probe, are analyzed and compared with experimental data from the Chalmers 12 MWth CFB boiler and a good agreement is obtained...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel technique for particle tracking in 2 -dimensional fluidized beds operated under ambient conditions. The method {{is applied to}} study the mixing mechanisms of fuel particles in fluidized beds {{and is based on}} tracking a phosphorescent tracer particle by means of video recording with subsequent digital image analysis. From this, concentration, velocity and dispersion fields of the tracer particle can be obtained with high accuracy. Although the method is restricted to 2 -dimensional, it can be applied under flow conditions qualitatively resembling a fluidized-bed combustor. Thus, the experiments cover ranges of bed heights, gas velocities and fuel-to-bed material density and size ratios typical for fluidized-bed combustors. Also, several fluidization regimes (bubbling, turbulent, circulating and pneumatic) are included in the runs. A pattern found in all runs is that the mixing pattern of the tracer (fuel) solids is structured in horizontally aligned vortexes induced by the bubble flow. The main bubble paths always give a low concentration of tracer solids and with the tracer moving upwards, while the downflow of tracer particles in the dense <b>bottom</b> <b>bed</b> is found to take place in zones with low bubble density and at the sidewalls. The amount of bed material (bed height) has a strong influence on the <b>bottom</b> <b>bed</b> dynamics (development and coalescence of bubbles) and, consequently, on the solids mixing process. Local dispersion coefficients reach maximum values around the locations of bubble eruptions, while, {{in the presence of a}} dense <b>bottom</b> <b>bed,</b> an increase in fluidization velocity or amount of bed material enhances dispersion. Dispersion is found to be larger in the vertical than in the horizontal direction, confirming the critical character of lateral fuel dispersion in fluidized-bed combustors of large cross section...|$|E

40|$|This work investigates how wall-sampled {{pressure}} measurements {{are to be}} interpreted with respect to dynamics of industrial fluidized bed units.

A substantial amount of the bed material in a circulating fluidized bed (CFB) boiler is present as a dense bubbling <b>bottom</b> <b>bed.</b> The <b>bottom</b> <b>bed,</b> characterized by a constant pressure gradient, was present in spite of fluidization velocities that were several times greater than the terminal velocity of an average sized bed particle. The gas velocity at which the <b>bottom</b> <b>bed</b> disappears depends not only on the particle properties, but also on the total amount of solids in the CFB loop, and the geometrical features of the CFB unit, such as the dimension of the return duct. The experimental work was carried out in a 12 MW th CFB boiler and in a cold CFB. Three different distributions of the bubble flow in time and space, termed fluidization regimes, were identified in the cold CFB: the multiple bubble regime with many small bubbles evenly distributed in the bed; the single bubble regime, characterized by the presence of only one bubble at a time in the bed; and the exploding bubble regime with large, single, irregular voids stretching from the air distributor to the bed surface. These bubbling conditions were observed during variations in the gas velocity and the distributor pressure drop. A comparison with the 2 m 2 cross-section CFB boiler showed that the boiler always operates in the single or in the exploding bubble regime, which indicates a bubble flow that is not continuous and not well distributed over the cross-section of the bed.

40|$|Caking coal is {{difficult}} to be gasified in fluidized bed (FB) because of the inevitable particle agglomeration caused by caking in the dense <b>bottom</b> of the <b>bed.</b> Literature {{studies have shown that}} pre-oxidizing the coal can suppress its caking propensity, while quick dispersion of coal particles, for example, by gas jetting in the plastic stage of heating is critical to such a suppression of the caking agglomeration. Thus, the so-called jetting pre-oxidation fluidized bed gasification (JPFBG) is devised in this study to gasify caking coal in FB. Coal particles usually below 5 mm are blown into the space above the <b>bottom</b> dense <b>bed</b> surface by an O- 2 -containing gas jet to disperse and meanwhile to pre-oxidize the particles. The resulting char particles with little, even without caking propensity fall into the dense <b>bottom</b> of the <b>bed</b> to allow their gasification there. After validating the destruction of caking agglomeration by jetting pre-oxidation in a laboratory FB apparatus, a 150 kg/h pilot JPFBG plant was built and the coal with the caking index of about 20 was successfully gasified in this plant using normal air and O- 2 -enriched air. The heating vale of the produced gas varied in 2. 9 - 5. 0 MJ/m(N) (3) and decreased with raising the oxygen percentage applied to the jet feeding. Raising the oxygen percentage for the jet caused more of the produced gas formed in the <b>bottom</b> dense <b>bed</b> of char gasification to burn off in the jetting zone. The optimal proportion of the oxygen applied to the jet feeding or coal pre-oxidation was found to be about 37 % against the total oxygen supply. Enriching the 02 content in the gasification agent to about 30 vol. % enhanced greatly the gasification rate of the tested low-reactivity coal in JPFB. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Two CLC reactors of vastly different size (bench and utility scale) are studied in order to discern the difference in effects related to up-scaling. A 1 -dimensional model is used in order to simulate the units studied. The model considers kinetics dependent on the degree of oxidation of the oxygen carrier and a population distribution of the oxygen carriers, whose mixing accounts for both convective and dispersive transport. The model is validated against bench scale data and applied to evaluate the performance of a 1000 MWth CLC fuel reactor using either syngas or methane as fuel. Using the model, sensitivity analyses are carried out to depict the effect on the fuel conversion of several parameters such as solids circulation, oxygen carrier reactivity, bed height and maximum bubble size allowed.

In particular, horizontal profiles of the local solids volume concentration have been measured with a capacitance probe and the vertical pressure profile has been measured by a probe with densely spaced pressure taps. Local velocities were measured by cross-correlating the signals of a twochannel capacitance probe. In order to get some information on the influence of the flow structure on local combustion conditions a probe has been used which combines both capacitance and zirconia-cell sensors.
