5|$|Branham {{claimed to}} have had a prophetic revelation in June, 1933 that {{comprised}} seven major events that would occur before the Second Coming of Christ.

The final two visions, one related to the Roman Catholic Church gaining power in the United States and the second detailing the destruction of the United States, would <b>be</b> <b>fulfilled</b> by 1977, subsequent to which Christ would return.

5|$|The cy-près {{doctrine}} in English law {{is an element}} of trusts law dealing with charitable trusts. The doctrine provides that when such a trust has failed because its purposes are either impossible or cannot <b>be</b> <b>fulfilled,</b> the High Court of Justice or Charity Commission can make an order redirecting the trust's funds to the nearest possible purpose. For charities with a worth under £5,000 and no land, the trustees (by a two-thirds majority) may make the decision to redirect the trust's funds. The doctrine was initially an element of ecclesiastical law, coming from the Norman French cy près comme possible (as close as possible), but similar and possibly ancestral provisions have been found in Roman law, both in the Corpus Juris Civilis and later Byzantine law.|$|E
5|$|While the {{persecution}} under Constantius was relatively light, {{there is no}} doubt about the force of {{the persecution}} in Maximian's domain. Its effects are recorded at Rome, Sicily, Spain, and in Africaindeed, Maximian encouraged particularly strict enforcement of the edict in Africa. Africa's political elite were insistent that the persecution <b>be</b> <b>fulfilled,</b> and Africa's Christians, especially in Numidia, were equally insistent on resisting them. For the Numidians, to hand over scriptures was an act of terrible apostasy. Africa had long been home to the Church of the Martyrsin Africa, martyrs held more religious authority than the clergyand harbored a particularly intransigent, fanatical, and legalistic variety of Christianity. It was Africa that gave the West most of its martyrdoms.|$|E
5|$|According to Theravada commentaries, {{there are}} five {{requisite}} factors that must all <b>be</b> <b>fulfilled</b> for an act to be both an act of killing and to be karmically negative. These are: (1) {{the presence of a}} living being, human or animal; (2) the knowledge that the being is a living being; (3) the intent to kill; (4) the act of killing by some means; and (5) the resulting death. Some Buddhists have argued on this basis that the act of killing is complicated, and its ethicization is predicated upon intent. Some have argued that in defensive postures, for example, the primary intention of a soldier is not to kill, but to defend against aggression, and the act of killing in that situation would have minimal negative karmic repercussions.|$|E

5|$|Because Irenaeus saw {{the purpose}} of the world to be the {{development}} of the moral character of humans, he believed that a good world would be best suited to that purpose. Irenaeaus believed that this world would include some suffering and evil to help people draw closer to God. He perceived God's declaration in the Book of Genesis that his creation was good to mean that the world is fit for purpose, rather than being free from suffering. To illustrate the benefits of suffering, Irenaeus cited the Biblical example of Jonah, from the Book of Jonah. His suffering, being swallowed by a whale, both enabled God's plan to <b>be</b> <b>fulfilled</b> and also brought Jonah closer to God: Jonah ended up repenting for his sin and the people of Nineveh turn to God.|$|E
5|$|Coutances {{returned}} to Normandy, and in December 1195 attempted to secure {{compensation for the}} losses his archdiocese had sustained in the warfare between King Richard and King Phillip. He sought compensation from both kings but obtained no satisfaction, and felt so ill-treated by the kings that he abandoned his see. The English and the French kings had required clergymen to guarantee the January 1196 Treaty of Louviers that the two kings arranged for themselves, with Richard nominating Coutances as his surety, or guarantor that {{the conditions of the}} treaty would <b>be</b> <b>fulfilled.</b> Part of the treaty laid out that if the archbishop laid an interdict or excommunicated anyone in the lands of King Philip or any subject of King Richard in the archdiocese of Rouen, then the archiepiscopal manor of Andeli should be forfeit to either king until after a special tribunal had determined if the archbishop's punishment was valid.|$|E
5|$|The cy-près {{doctrine}} {{is the idea}} that, where a charitable trust's purposes are impossible or cannot <b>be</b> <b>fulfilled</b> for whatever reason, the funds should be reapplied to purposes {{as close as possible}} to the trust's original goals. This is done through a formal application by the trustees, either to the High Court of Justice or the Charity Commission. This doctrine originated in ecclesiastical law, the name coming as a contraction of the Norman French cy près comme possible (as close as possible), It was originally justified in an ecclesiastical way; charitable gifts were provided to secure entry into heaven, and if the charitable gift failed, this would not be guaranteed. If it was re-purposed, however, entry would be granted. The local bishop, therefore, would usually simply apply the gift to the nearest possible purpose to the testator's original goals.|$|E

5|$|The Steam client, {{as part of}} {{a social}} network service, allows users to {{identify}} friends and join groups using the Steam Community feature. Users can use text chat and peer-to-peer VoIP with other users, identify which games their friends and other group members are playing, and join and invite friends to Steamworks-based multiplayer games that support this feature. Users can participate in forums hosted by Valve to discuss Steam games. Each user has a unique page that shows his or her groups and friends, game library including earned achievements, game wishlists, and other social features; users can choose to keep this information private. In January 2010, Valve reported that 10million of the 25million active Steam accounts had signed up to Steam Community. In conjunction with the 2012 Steam Summer Sale, user profiles were updated with Badges reflecting the user's participation in the Steam community and past events. Steam Trading Cards were introduced in beta in May 2013 and were fully supported by June 2013. By playing specific games, players would earn virtual trading cards, which they could trade with friends and use towards gaining rewards on the service such as game discounts, downloadable content, or in-game items, and customize their user profile page. In 2010, the Steam client became an OpenID provider, allowing third-party websites to use a Steam user's identity without requiring the user to expose his or her Steam credentials. In order to prevent abuse, access to most community features is restricted until a one-time payment of at least 5 is made to Valve. This requirement can <b>be</b> <b>fulfilled</b> by making any purchase of five dollars or more on Steam, or by adding at the same amount to their wallet.|$|E
