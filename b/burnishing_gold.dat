50|$|<b>Burnish</b> <b>Gold</b> or Best Gold {{is applied}} to the ware as a {{suspension}} of gold powder in essential oils mixed with lead borosilicate or a bismuth-based flux. This type of gold decoration is dull as taken from the kiln and requires burnishing, usually with agate, to bring out the colour. As the name suggests it is considered the highest quality of gold decoration. One solvent-free <b>burnish</b> <b>gold</b> composition was reported to consist of 10 to 40% gold powder, 2 to 20% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 3 to 30% an aqueous acrylate resin and 5 to 50% water.|$|R

60|$|In the meanwhile, {{the grain}} was {{ripening}} fast, {{and when the}} riotous Northwest wind began to die away the oats turned lemon and silver, and the wheat <b>burnished</b> <b>gold.</b> The mornings were now sharply cold, and as the green sunset faded the air grew wonderfully bracing.|$|R
60|$|It {{was high}} noon when the party {{set out on}} their mysterious journey, and a {{brighter}} glow than usual was suffusing the eastern sky, while a gleam of direct sunshine, the first seen that spring, was tipping the peaks of the higher bergs as if with <b>burnished</b> <b>gold.</b>|$|R

40|$|During {{the last}} decades {{synthetic}} polymers has been introduced {{as an alternative to}} traditional materials in conservation of gilding surfaces. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate where and when it is appropriate to use synthetic polymers and when traditional materials are preferred. The synthetic polymers which have been investigated as alternatives are polyvinyl alcohol for animal glue in <b>burnished</b> <b>gold,</b> acrylic dispersion for linseed oil in oil gilding, and acrylic gold paint for bronzing powder in shellac. Reference materials of the traditional materials were made. Solubility and mechanical strength tests were carried out. The solutions tested were; water, ethanol, acetone, ammoniac and white spirit. The mechanical tests were made with; finger, eraser and scalpel. From the results of the tests recommendations for cleaning could be presented. Light photomicrographs of both synthetic and traditional gilding types were created as an aid to visually compare them. A patch of <b>burnished</b> <b>gold</b> with polyvinyl alcohol as the medium was made upon the traditional <b>burnished</b> <b>gold</b> surface. The purpose was to see if it could discern the difference between traditional gilding and the synthetic alternative with the aid of the optical microscope. Recommendation for cleaning, consolidation and retouching could be presented. The recommendations are built on the work of two experts in gilding conservation; Malcolm Green at the Victoria and Albert Museum, London and Jonathan Thornton at Buffalo State University in the US. They have two very different attitudes and approaches to conservation of gilded surfaces. Their differing schools of thought are weighed against Munoz Vinas´s theories of conservation ethics of today.

50|$|The China Room {{is one of}} {{the rooms}} on the Ground Floor of the White House, the home of the President of the United States. The White House's {{collection}} of state china is displayed there. The collection ranges from George Washington's Chinese export china to Bill Clinton's ivory, yellow, and <b>burnished</b> <b>gold</b> china. The room is primarily used by the first lady for teas, meetings, and smaller receptions.|$|R
60|$|It {{seemed the}} forest now or nothing, and I {{was just on}} the point of motioning Tars Tarkas to follow me in that {{direction}} when the sun passed the cliff's zenith, and as the bright rays touched the dull surface it burst out into a million scintillant lights of <b>burnished</b> <b>gold,</b> of flaming red, of soft greens, and gleaming whites--a more gorgeous and inspiring spectacle human eye has never rested upon.|$|R
30|$|Various {{synthetic}} {{materials have}} been used for OAF closures. Use of gold foil and gold plate for the closure of OAFs was reported for the first time by Goldman and Salman, respectively [59, 60]. It is a simplified technique for the closure of oroantral fistulas. The technique consists of elevating the mucoperiosteum to expose the bony margins of the fistula. Then, the opening is covered with an overlapping margin of <b>burnished</b> <b>gold</b> foil.|$|R
5000|$|At Wellington's {{lying in}} state, his batons of {{military}} rank were placed alongside the coffin on eight velvet cushions each {{on a pedestal}} on gold lion supporters. The pedestals were more than two feet in height, each bearing the shield and banners of their respective nations. On two additional similar pedestals were placed Wellington's standard and guidon. The batons were described thus: *The Baton of Portugal is of burnished gold; it is surmounted by a crown, and on a shield are the arms of Portugal.*The Baton of Prussia is of <b>burnished</b> <b>gold,</b> and is of classic ornamentation; it bears two eagles displayed, holding the sceptre and orb of sovereignty.*The Baton of England is of gold, and is surmounted with the group of St. George and the Dragon. This baton is excessively rich in its decoration.*The Baton of the Netherlands. This {{is one of the}} simplest, but perhaps the most elegant of the batons, the Greek ornaments being introduced very tastefully. The arms of the Netherlands are in the upper division.*The Baton of Spain. Like that of Portugal, it is crowned; but it is shorter in its proportions. It is of <b>burnished</b> <b>gold,</b> and bears the armorial ensigns of Spain.*The Baton of Hanover. The crown and ends of the staff are gold; but the chief part of the baton is covered with crimson velvet, powdered with silver horses—the Hanoverian arms; and a silver horse is placed above the crown.*The Baton of Austria is of <b>burnished</b> <b>gold,</b> and the wreaths round it are in dead gold. The other portions are extremely plain.*The Baton of Russia is of gold, and the alternate wreaths of laurel and oak, which twine round it; and the collars round the staff are set with diamonds of great value. The ground is frosted gold. J. H. Stocqueler (1854) ...|$|R
50|$|There was a {{universal}} feeling expressed by those present {{who had not}} previously seen the interior {{that they had not}} dreamed that it would be so magnificent, the austerity of the exterior scarcely preparing them for the fine effect of the chancel, with its shining brass and gleaming silver and <b>burnished</b> <b>gold,</b> the splendid sweep of the interior arches, the spacious auditorium unbroken by a single pillar, and the lofty roof, where sunbeams glinted and shadows came and went.|$|R
60|$|A chariot {{was indeed}} {{approaching}} the opposite brow of the depression; {{there were two}} figures in it; by the side walked numerous figures, who, although too far off to be distinguished, were judged to be the attendants and courtiers of the king. The sun flashed {{from the side of}} the chariot, which appeared at this distance to be composed of <b>burnished</b> <b>gold.</b> Great fans carried on wands shaded the king from the heat of the sun.|$|R
60|$|The harness of the {{commanding}} officer was a solid mass of diamonds. Against the ebony background of his skin they blazed out with a peculiarly accentuated effulgence. The whole scene was enchanting. The handsome men; the barbaric splendour of the accoutrements; the polished skeel wood of the deck; the gloriously grained sorapus of the cabins, inlaid with priceless jewels and precious metals in intricate and beautiful design; the <b>burnished</b> <b>gold</b> of hand rails; the shining metal of the guns.|$|R

25|$|The {{custom of}} {{including}} {{a representation of}} the arms of the United States, by way of an eagle clutching an olive branch and arrows in its talons and a striped shield with stars became standard on invitations in the early 19th century. By the mid 19th century, the more formal Great Seal of the United States was placed at the head of invitations. Text was engraved in black script, allowing space for the guest's name to be added individually. The Great Seal was engraved in <b>burnished</b> <b>gold.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Prussian carp is a deep-bodied, robust fish which {{resembles the}} Crucian carp (Carassius carassius) and grows to about 10 to 35 cm in length. Its scales {{are larger than}} those of the Crucian carp, and it {{typically}} has 27 to 32 scales along the lateral line, whereas the Crucian carp usually has between 31 and 35. The species is silvery, sometimes with a faint golden tinge, while the Crucian carp has a <b>burnished</b> <b>gold</b> appearance. The Prussian carp's tail is more deeply forked than that of the Crucian carp.|$|R
60|$|But they're most æsthetic chimney-pots. Do {{come and}} look, Mrs. Murray. [BASIL and HILDA {{approach}} {{one of the}} windows, and he opens it.] And at night they're so mysterious. They look just like strange goblins playing on the house-tops. And you can't think how gorgeous the sunsets are: sometimes, after the rain, the slate roofs glitter like <b>burnished</b> <b>gold.</b> [To HILDA.] Often I think I couldn't have lived without my view, it says such wonderful things to me. [Turning to MABEL gaily.] Scoff, Mrs. Halliwell, I'm {{on the verge of}} being sentimental.|$|R
60|$|When {{the sun set}} {{they still}} {{continued}} to paddle onwards, the only difference being that instead of passing over a sea of crystal, they appeared to traverse an ocean of amber and <b>burnished</b> <b>gold.</b> All night they continued their labours. About daybreak the Chief permitted them to enjoy a somewhat longer period of rest, during which most of them, without lying down, indulged in a short but refreshing nap. Resuming the paddles, they proceeded until sunrise, when their hearts were gladdened {{by the sight of}} the blue hills of Raratonga on the bright horizon.|$|R
60|$|Then {{he noticed}} the pale primroses that pushed their yellow flowers up among the {{withered}} leaves, and the faint blue sheen beneath the beech trunks not far away. There was a vein of artistic daintiness in this man, and the elusive beauty of these things curiously appealed to him. He had seen the riotous, sensuous blaze of flowers kissed by Pacific breezes, and the <b>burnished</b> <b>gold</b> of wheat that rolled in mile-long waves; {{but it seemed to}} him that the wild things of the English North were, after all, more wonderful. They matched its deep peacefulness; their beauty was chaste, fairy-like, and ethereal.|$|R
6000|$|Well was he armed {{from head}} to heel, In mail and plate of Milan steel; But his strong helm, of mighty cost, Was all with <b>burnished</b> <b>gold</b> embossed; Amid the plumage of the crest, A falcon hovered on her nest, With wings outspread, and forward breast: E'en such a falcon, on his shield, Soared sable in an azure field: The golden legend bore aright, [...] "Who checks at me, to death is dight." [...] Blue was the charger's broidered rein; Blue ribbons decked his arching mane; The knightly housing's ample fold Was velvet blue, and trapped with gold.|$|R
5000|$|Hereupon Legrand arose, with a {{grave and}} stately air, and brought me the beetle from {{a glass case}} {{in which it was}} enclosed. It was a {{beautiful}} scarabaeus, and, at that time, unknown to naturalists - of course a great prize in a scientific point of view. There were two round black spots near one extremity of the back, and a long one near the other. The scales were exceedingly hard and glossy, with all the appearance of <b>burnished</b> <b>gold.</b> The weight of the insect was very remarkable, and, taking all things into consideration, I could hardly blame Jupiter for his opinion respecting it.|$|R
60|$|At {{last she}} turned to look behind her. There on the left stood rows of immense houses, barred and grated like jails or fortresses; palaces where lived the mighty ones of Chicago commerce. Before their doors {{carriages}} stood, with attendants in livery, such as she had read about and had never seen. Up and down the curving ribbon of lavender sand other carriages were driving, with jingle of silver chains and soft roll of wheels. The horses flung foam from their bits; they were magnificent horses (she knew horses as well as any coachman), and their brass-trimmed harnesses glittered in the sun like <b>burnished</b> <b>gold.</b>|$|R
60|$|On our {{way towards}} {{the door of the}} gallery, at our departure, we saw the cabinet of gems open, and again feasted our eyes with its {{concentrated}} brilliancies and magnificences. Among them were two crystal cups, with engraved devices, and covers of enamelled gold, wrought by Benvenuto Cellini, and wonderfully beautiful. But it is idle to mention one or two things, when all are so beautiful and curious; idle, too, because language is not <b>burnished</b> <b>gold,</b> with here and there a brighter word flashing like a diamond; and therefore no amount of talk will give the slightest idea of one of these elaborate handiworks.|$|R
60|$|Wyllard {{noticed the}} pale primroses that pushed their yellow flowers up among the {{withered}} leaves, {{and he took}} account of the faint blue sheen beneath the beech trunks not far away. There was a vein of artistic feeling in him, and the elusive beauty of these things curiously appealed to him. He had seen the riotous, sensuous blaze of flowers kissed by Pacific breezes, and the <b>burnished</b> <b>gold</b> of wheat that rolled in mile-long waves; {{but it seemed to}} him that the wild things of the English North were, after all, more wonderful. They harmonized with the country's deep peacefulness; their beauty was chaste, fairy-like and ethereal.|$|R
60|$|It was the {{beginning}} of March when I started. According to the old proverb, the dog was already seeking the shade: En Marzo busca la sombra el perro; the chilly Spaniard, loosening the folds of his capa, acknowledged that at mid-day in the sun it was almost warm. The winter rains appeared to have ceased; the sky over Seville was cloudless, not with the intense azure of midsummer, but with a blue that seemed mixed with silver. And in the sun the brown water of the Guadalquivir glittered like the scales on a fish's back, or like the <b>burnished</b> <b>gold</b> of old Moorish pottery.|$|R
