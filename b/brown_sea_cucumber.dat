40|$|Abstract: The <b>brown</b> <b>sea</b> <b>cucumber</b> {{fishery is}} active in the Galapagos Islands since the year 1991 after its col-lapse in {{mainland}} Ecuador. This paper analyzes the Galapagos Sea cucumber fishery {{over the past decade}} and the reasons for its management pitfalls and chronic over fishing, and proposes an improved strategy for estimating stock size and harvest potential. Based on the historical distribution of the fishing fleet and past fishery surveys, 15 macrozones were defined; their areas were estimated from the coastline to the 30 m isobaths and the numbers of sample replicates per macrozone were calculated for a density estimate precision of ± 25 %. Overall stock size was calculated by summing over all macrozones and was multiplied by 0. 122 to obtain the annual quota. This multiplier was derived by inserting an exploitation rate of E= 0. 3 and a published natural mortality value of M= 0. 17 into Cadimas formula, thereby obtaining a more conservative precautionary quota estimate. Pre-fishery stock densities in 2009 were below the legal threshold value and the fishery remained closed. Mean densities were significantly lower in the deeper (> 15 m) than in the shallower (< 15 m) stratum, contrary to fishermen expectations.

40|$|The Natural Protected Area Parque Nacional Bahia de Loreto, {{including}} five adjacent islands, {{was created in}} 1996. The park presents rocky and sandy shores, mangrove areas and small patches of reef corals, which {{have been used for}} fishing and ecotourism activities. The fishery of the <b>brown</b> <b>sea</b> <b>cucumber</b> Isostichopus fuscus {{is one of the most}} peculiar in the Gulf of California since early nineties and in the Park the fishery takes place since 2000 under special permits known as UMAS (units for wildlife management). However, little is known on the abundance of the resource in natural populations in México, crucial information to determine total allowable catch. The objective of this study was to assess the abundance of I. fuscus in the National Park Bahia de Loreto, Gulf of California, during the fishing season 2005 - 2006. Abundance was estimated through belt transects (25 x 2 m). A total of 29 sites or “banks” were visited, mostly sites where the fishery occurs. Data were analyzed to determine homoscedasticity and normality using the Levene and Kolmogorov-Smirnoff tests, respectively. To detect differences between the islands we used a one way ANOVA (model II; α= 0. 05) considering the islands as factors. We used linear regressions to detect geographic clines between population density and geographic location. The average abundance of I. fuscus in the PNBL was 1. 41 + 0. 02 individuals/transect, with an average density of 0. 028 + 0. 0004 ind/m 2. Density was slightly higher in the southern banks. The lowest value was found at isla Montserrat, which is close to the coastline of the Baja California Peninsula, where most of the fishery occurs. No relationship was found between population density and latitudinal gradient, nor with the distance from the coastline. We concluded that even though density levels were low in PNBL, the situation of I. fuscus does not seem critical to populations...|$|E

40|$|<b>Sea</b> <b>cucumber</b> {{aquaculture}} has flourished as {{a result}} of increasing demand coupled with declining wild fisheries and has been facilitated by technical progress in the production and grow-out phase of larvae and small juvenile <b>sea</b> <b>cucumbers.</b> China has developed a large and successful <b>sea</b> <b>cucumber</b> aquaculture industry based on the temperate species Apostichopus japonicus (Selenka, 1867). China consumes most of its domestic <b>sea</b> <b>cucumber</b> production (193, 705 tons: 2013), exporting only a few dozen tons. Much of the success of <b>sea</b> <b>cucumber</b> aquaculture in China came from advances in culture methods, especially for the early stages of broodstock conditioning, larval production and settlement, and the critical early juvenile development stage. These artificial approaches to production are a precondition for all aquaculture models, and the scientific procedures and management protocols must be strictly adhered to for success. Similarly, the grow-out phase of <b>sea</b> <b>cucumber</b> production in China has evolved from attempts using disused fish and shrimp ponds to new, dedicated ponds developed to meet the more sensitive requirements of <b>sea</b> <b>cucumbers</b> for water quality and substrate type and to the use of ocean ranching.

This difference supports the hypothesis that <b>sea</b> <b>cucumbers</b> in the same bay maintain distinctly different feeding histories, with those residing beneath mussel farming longlines deriving tissue carbon from sediment impacted by farming activities. This hypothesis is further supported by the finding that the isotope signature of sediment collected from beneath the mussel farm is consistent with the expectation that <b>sea</b> <b>cucumbers</b> were feeding on and consuming sediment enriched with bivalve waste (faeces and pseudo-faeces). In contrast the nitrogen stable isotope signature (δ 15 N) was found to be similar between sites, for both <b>sea</b> <b>cucumbers</b> and assumed food sources.
