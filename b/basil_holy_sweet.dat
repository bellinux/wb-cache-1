40|$|Objectives: Various {{antibacterial}} and antiplaque {{agents are}} used in chemical plaque control but none are without their shortcomings. Chlorhexidine considered a gold standard, also has an array of side effects. To overcome these, numerous herbal extracts have been tried and tested and one among them is <b>holy</b> <b>basil.</b> The present study evaluated the antibacterial efficacy of <b>holy</b> <b>basil</b> in vitro against some periodontopathogens and its antiplaque ef fect in vivo. Study Design: Thirty periodontally healthy volunteers were randomly divided into three groups and refrained from all mechanical oral hygiene measures for 4 days and used one of the randomly assigned mouthwash (1 - chlor - hexidine; 2 - holy basil; and 3 - sterile water [placebo]) twice daily. The Plaque Index (PI) was assessed at days 0 and 5. Aqueous extract of <b>holy</b> <b>basil</b> was tested against Prevotella intermedia (P. intermedia) and Fusobacterium nucleatum (F. nucleatum). Results: <b>Holy</b> <b>basil</b> extract showed inhibition of both the tested periodontopathogens (P. intermedia and F. nucleatum) at various concentrations. In all groups, the PI increased from baseline to day 5. There was {{a statistically significant difference}} (p <. 05) between the chlorhexidine and placebo rinse and the <b>holy</b> <b>basil</b> and placebo rinse, but no statis - tically significant difference was found between the chlorhexidine and <b>holy</b> <b>basil</b> rinse with respect to PI. Conclusions: These results indicate that the <b>holy</b> <b>basil</b> mouthwash has an antiplaque effect and is efficacious against P. intermedia and F. nucleatum strains in vitro. Hence <b>holy</b> <b>basil</b> mouthwash may have potential as an antiplaque mouthwash with prophylactic benefits...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Mediterranean climate {{conditions}} induce several stresses that plants {{have to cope}} with, especially during summer months when high temperature and radiation levels along with low water availability in the soil prevail for long periods. Variation in physiological traits such as photosynthesis and plant water status and their association with morphological characters {{can play an important}} role in the adaptability of the species to environmental constraints. The previous studies show that scorching weather not only affects the rate of gas exchange, but also results in diurnal changes in activity. Thus, the impact of environmental stresses on plants growing in these conditions should be assessed by examining the evolution of their diurnal variations on leaf gas exchange. Aromatic plants represent a renewable source of valuable compounds that can be used in food, perfumery, and pharmaceutical industry. Among these plants, <b>sweet</b> <b>basil</b> (Ocimumbasilicum), <b>holy</b> <b>basil</b> (Ocimum sanctum), lemon balm (Melissa officinalisL.) and catnip (Nepetacataria) are very important for different industries. Studies on environmental physiology of medicinal plants are relatively scarce and very few information is available concerning the physiological basis of medicinal plant response to heat stress that is one of the most important factors limiting production of medicinal plants in Khuzestan province. Material and methods: In order to evaluate the diurnal fluctuation of gas exchange of mentioned plants, an experiment was carried out in 2013 at research farm of Horticultural Science, Shahid Chamran University (31 ° 20 'N latitude and 48 ° 40 'E longitude and 22. 5 m mean sea level), Ahvaz (Iran), a site characterized by a semidry and scorching weather during late spring and summer. The experiment was arranged based on randomized complete block design (RCBD) with three replications and 4 × 8 factorial scheme (Four plants including lemon balm, catnip, <b>holy</b> <b>basil</b> and basil; and eight times of evaluation 7 : 00, 9 : 00, 10 : 00, 11 : 00, 12 : 00, 13 : 00, 17 : 00 and 20 : 00 h). Land preparation consisted of disking and the formation of raised beds (15 cm high and 45 cm wide across the top) using a press-pan-type bed shaper. The plants were arranged on two rows on each bed, with 20 cm in-row and 40 cm between-row spacing. The plants were irrigated weekly as needed. Gas exchange parameters were investigated from June 9 - 11 at end of vegetative phase under natural environmental conditions. The parameters of gas exchange were measured on the 5 th and 6 th nearly full expanded leaves between the hours of 07 : 00 and 20 : 00 during bright sunlight on clear and cloudless days. Determination of leaf net photosynthesis rate (Pn), stomatal conductance (gs) and transpiration (E) was made with Infra-red gas analyzer (LCA 4, ADC Co. Ltd., Hoddesdon, UK). Instantaneous water use efficiency (WUEinst) and apparent quantum yield(AQY) were calculated as Pn/E andPn/PPFD ratios, respectively. Result and discussion: The result showed that plant type had significant effect on all measured traits as well as record time. Interaction between plant type and record time were significant for PPFD, leaf temperature and net photosynthesis. The highest Pnof Lemon balm (8. 97 µmol CO 2 m- 2 s- 1), catnip (11. 2 µmol CO 2 m- 2 s- 1) and sweet basil (13. 75 µmol CO 2 m- 2 s- 1) were recorded at 9 : 00 when the photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) was 1488, 1598 and 1645 µmol photon m- 2 s- 1, respectively. <b>Holy</b> <b>basil</b> showed highest Pn (15. 47 µmol CO 2 m- 2 s- 1) at 10 : 00 when PPFD was 1821 µmol photon m- 2 s- 1. High irradiances caused photoinhibition of the four plants and it seems the four plants reach to light saturation point about 1500 µmol photon m- 2 s- 1. The midday depression of photosynthesis likely resulted primarily from long periods of high PPFD, limitation in stomatal conductance and high temperature. Catnip was more sensitive to high irradiance. The Pn had positive and significant correlation with gs in four plants. The stomatal conductance was also positively correlated with E in four plants. The plants represented double peak curve for WUE. The first and second peaks appeared at 9 : 00 and 17 : 00, respectively. The four plants also showed highest AQY at 7 : 00. There were significant difference between four plants for leaf temperature, gs, Pn, WUE and AQY. Lemon balm showed lower leaf temperature than other plants due to its high gs. The highest amounts of Pn, WUE and AQY were observed in <b>holy</b> <b>basil.</b> Conclusion: In regard to Pn, WUE and AQY, it seems <b>holy</b> <b>basil</b> and <b>sweet</b> basil can tolerate weather condition of Ahvaz...|$|R

50|$|Three {{types of}} basil are {{commonly}} used in Thai cuisine. First, Thai basil, or horapha (โหระพา), is widely used throughout Southeast Asia and plays {{a prominent role in}} Vietnamese cuisine. It is also the cultivar most often used for Asian cooking in Western kitchens. Second, <b>holy</b> <b>basil</b> (O. tenuiflorum), or kaphrao (กะเพรา), which has a spicy, peppery, clove-like taste, may be the basil Thai people love most. <b>Holy</b> <b>basil</b> is also known as Thai <b>holy</b> <b>basil</b> or by its Indian name, tulasi or tulsi; it is widely used in India for culinary, medicinal, and religious purposes. Finally, lemon basil (O. × citriodorum), or maenglak (แมงลัก), as its name implies, has undertones of lemon in both scent and taste. Lemon basil is the least commonly used type of basil in Thailand. It is also known as Thai lemon basil, in contradistinction to Mrs. Burns lemon basil, another cultivar of basil.|$|R

Additionally, their total phenolic contents were analyzed by Folin-Ciocalteau micro method. The result showed that red <b>holy</b> <b>basil</b> and red bird chili seemed to be better sources of antioxidant compounds, followed by green bird chili and red chili spur pepper, white <b>holy</b> <b>basil,</b> green chili spur pepper, garlic and pumpkin, respectively.
