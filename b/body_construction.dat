25|$|When the 501 was {{introduced}} in 1951, its cost of approximately DM15,000 was about four times the average German's earnings. It was also much heavier than expected and underpowered with a development of BMW's pre-war twolitre six.

25|$|The Elite's most {{distinctive}} feature was its highly innovative fibreglass monocoque construction, {{in which a}} stressed-skin GRP unibody replaced the previously separate chassis and body components. Unlike the contemporary Chevrolet Corvette, which used fibreglass for only exterior bodywork, the Elite used glass-reinforced plastic for the entire load-bearing structure of the car, although a steel subframe for supporting the engine and front suspension was bonded into {{the front of the}} monocoque, as was a square-section windscreen-hoop that provided mounting points for door hinges, jacking point for lifting the car and roll-over protection. The first 250 body units were made by Maximar Mouldings at Pulborough, Sussex. The <b>body</b> <b>construction</b> caused numerous early problems, until manufacture was handed over to Bristol Aeroplane Company.|$|E
25|$|In 1984 Guild {{released}} {{the first official}} Red Special replica for mass production, and made some prototypes specifically for May. However the solid <b>body</b> <b>construction</b> (the original RS has hollow cavities in the body) and the pick-ups (DiMarzio) that were not an exact replica of the Burns TriSonic did not make May happy, so the production stopped after just 300guitars. In 1993 Guild made a second replica of the RS, made in just 1000copies, of which May has some and used as a back-up. At the moment, he uses the two guitars made by Greg Fryer—the luthier who restored the Old Lady in 1998—as back-up. They are almost identical to the original, except for the Fryer logo on the headstock (May's original one has a sixpence).|$|E

[...] With the iris ring sitting inside the focussing ring {{it was impossible to}} focus at full aperture followed by stopping down, as this moved the point of focus. [...] What makes these lenses interesting is their very compact [...] "pancake" [...] design. The concept of the makers was to offer a sharp Tessar-type lens of the simplest possible <b>body</b> <b>construction,</b> leaving out all progress made in this field since 1945.

2500|$|Harold L. Hamilton and Paul Turner {{founded the}} Electro-Motive Engineering Corporation in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1922, soon {{renaming}} it to Electro-Motive Company (EMC). The company developed and marketed self-propelled railcars using General Electric's newly developed internal combustion-electric propulsion and control systems. [...] Hamilton started his railroading {{career as a}} fireman, then locomotive engineer, on the Southern Pacific Railroad, then became a manager with the Florida East Coast Railway. On leaving railroading for an automotive marketing position in Denver, Hamilton, aware of recent developments in electric propulsion, the technology of heavy vehicles, {{and the needs of}} branch line services of railroads, recognized the opportunities for internal combustion power with railroading. [...] Financing himself, he quit his truck sales position and set up shop in a hotel with his partner and a designer. [...] In 1923 EMC sold two gasoline-powered rail motor cars, one to the Chicago Great Western and the other to the Northern Pacific. EMC subcontracted the <b>body</b> <b>construction</b> to St. Louis Car Company, electrical components to General Electric, and the prime mover to Winton Engine Company. The motorcars were delivered in 1924 and worked well, fortunate for the fledgling company, because the sales were conditional on satisfactory performance. In 1925, EMC entered full-scale production, selling 27 railcars.|$|E
