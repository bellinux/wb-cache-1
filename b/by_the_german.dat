Kesselring's name headed the list of German officers blamed for a long series of atrocities perpetrated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>German</b> forces.|$|E

5|$|From late 1918, {{the ships}} {{were used to}} escort convoys part-way across the Atlantic. In late September, Minnesota struck a naval mine laid <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>German</b> U-boat U-117, causing serious damage that kept her out of service for five months. Convoy duty was cut short <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>German</b> {{surrender}} in November; thereafter, the Connecticuts were used to ferry American soldiers back from the battlefields of France. This work was completed by mid-1919. The ships briefly operated as training ships in the early 1920s, though {{under the terms of}} the Washington Naval Treaty, they were all sold for scrap by 1924 and broken up.|$|E

5|$|As in all {{occupied}} {{countries in}} Europe, food, fuel and clothing were strictly rationed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>German</b> authorities. Even with the stringent rationing, {{the food and}} materials which civilians should officially have been entitled to were not always available. A significant black market also existed in the country, supplying food illegally at very high prices to those that could afford it. Information and the press were strictly controlled <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>German</b> government and news was greatly restricted. Nevertheless, the sales of collaborationist newspapers like Le Soir and the newspapers of pro-collaborationist political parties like Le Pays Réel remained high. A large number of underground newspapers were also published and distributed – the underground paper La Libre Belgique achieved a circulation of 30,000.|$|E

5|$|Belgium had {{pursued a}} policy of {{neutrality}} since its independence in 1830, successfully avoiding becoming a belligerent in the Franco-Prussian War (1870–71). In World War I, the German Empire invaded Belgium. During the ensuing occupation, the Allies encouraged Belgian workers to resist the occupiers through non-compliance, leading to large-scale reprisals against Belgian civilians <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>German</b> army.|$|E
5|$|Both {{operations}} were hampered <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>German</b> need {{to rely on}} their Croatian allies {{as well as the}} fact that both forces were ill-equipped for operations in mountainous terrain during extreme winter conditions. The Croatian units had proven not to be a useful addition to the operation, as they possessed {{little in the way of}} fighting power, had little unit cohesion and suffered from serious supply problems.|$|E
5|$|By 1944, Belgian collaborationist groups {{began to}} feel {{increasingly}} abandoned <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>German</b> government as the situation deteriorated. As resistance attacks against them escalated, collaborationist parties became more violent and launched reprisals against civilians, including the Courcelles Massacre in August 1944.|$|E

50|$|Built at the Ateliers et Chantiers de Provence, Port-de-Bouc, {{the ship}} was laid down in December 1937, {{launched}} on 22 August 1939 and commissioned in March 1940. From June 1940 she was {{under the control of}} Vichy France. On 8 December 1942 she was captured <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Germans,</b> transferred to Italy, reclassified as a corvette and renamed FR51. After the Italian armistice she was scuttled <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> on 9 September 1943 at La Spezia. She was raised <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> and returned to service as SG23, and then renamed Uj2231. On 15 April 1945 she was scuttled at Genoa.|$|R

5|$|Due to {{the length}} of the front created <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>German</b> summer offensive, aimed at taking the Caucasus oil fields and the city of Stalingrad, German and other Axis forces were forced to guard sectors beyond the length they were meant to occupy. The {{situation}} was exacerbated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>German</b> decision to relocate several mechanized divisions from the Soviet Union to Western Europe. Furthermore, units in the area were depleted after months of fighting, especially those which took part in the fighting in Stalingrad. The Germans could only count on the XXXXVIII Panzer Corps, which had the strength of a single panzer division, and the 29th Panzergrenadier Division as reserves to bolster their Romanian allies on the German Sixth Army's flanks. In comparison, the Red Army deployed over one million personnel for the purpose of beginning the offensive in and around Stalingrad. Soviet troop movements were not without problems, due to the difficulties of concealing their build-up, and to Soviet units commonly arriving late due to logistical issues. Operation Uranus was first postponed from 8 to 17 November, then to 19 November.|$|E
