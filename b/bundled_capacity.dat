40|$|The hair cell's mechanoreceptive organelle, {{the hair}} bundle, is highly {{sensitive}} because its transduction channels open over {{a very narrow}} range of displacements. The synchronous gating of transduction channels also underlies the active hair-bundle motility that amplifies and tunes responsiveness. The {{extent to which the}} gating of independent transduction channels is coordinated depends on how tightly individual stereocilia are constrained to move as a unit. Using dual-beam interferometry in the bullfrog's sacculus, we found that thermal movements of stereocilia located as far apart as a bundle's opposite edges display high coherence and negligible phase lag. Because the mechanical degrees of freedom of stereocilia are strongly constrained, a force applied anywhere in the hair bundle deflects the structure as a unit. This feature assures the concerted gating of transduction channels that maximizes the sensitivity of mechanoelectrical transduction and enhances the hair <b>bundle's</b> <b>capacity</b> to amplify its inputs.

40|$|The multidrug {{therapy for}} Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is efficacious in suppressing viral production, whereby it can delay {{drug-resistant}} HIV strains emerging. However even this powerful therapy cannot completely eradicate HIV- 1 population from infected individuals. The {{ultimate goal of}} antiretroviral therapy {{is to establish a}} treatment method to recover fully from AIDS. The lethal mutagenesis approach ill a promissing treatment method for complete cure from AIDS, and it plunges viral activities into chaos by inducing excess mutations by mutagenic activity in the HIV RNA genome. The study [1] discussed availability of a lethal mutagenesis treatment and established a theoretical basis for the treatment works successfully. However concurrently mathematical analyses revealed the treatment became successful only when virulence of a virus was relatively low. To develop a new treatment to tackle HIV having high virus virulence, this study examines combination effects of a mutagenic agent and existing anti-HIV drugs such as a reverse transcriptase inhibitor, a protease inhibitor, and proves the combinational drug treatments with a mutagen are superior to by use of a mutagen on a <b>bundling</b> <b>capacity</b> of high virus virulence and treatment duraration...|$|R
40|$|Aurora kinases are key effectors of mitosis. Plant Auroras are {{functionally}} {{divided into}} two clades. The alpha Auroras (Aurora 1 and Aurora 2) associate with the spindle and the cell plate and are implicated in controlling formative divisions throughout plant development. The beta Aurora (Aurora 3) localizes to centromeres and likely functions in chromosome separation. In contrast to the wealth of data available {{on the role of}} Aurora in other kingdoms, knowledge on their function in plants is merely emerging. This is exemplified by the fact that only histone H 3 and the plant homolog of TPX 2 have been identified as Aurora substrates in plants. Here we provide biochemical, genetic, and cell biological evidence that the microtubule-bundling protein MAP 65 - 1 -a member of the MAP 65 /Ase 1 /PRC 1 protein family, implicated in central spindle formation and cytokinesis in animals, yeasts, and plants-is a genuine substrate of alpha Aurora kinases. MAP 65 - 1 interacts with Aurora 1 in vivo and is phosphorylated on two residues at its unfolded tail domain. Its overexpression and down-regulation antagonistically affect the alpha Aurora double mutant phenotypes. Phospho-mutant analysis shows that Aurora contributes to the microtubule <b>bundling</b> <b>capacity</b> of MAP 65 - 1 in concert with other mitotic kinases...|$|R

The heterogeneity of sensor types, data formats, and communication protocols had lead to various distinct systems with very little interoperability in between. New efforts driven by the Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) community address those problems and provide interesting solution approaches. The Sensor Web Enablement initiative by the Open Geospatial Consortium aims at standardizing the entire sensor web process of sensor description, sensor discovery, sensor tasking, and access of data observed by sensors. This article will illustrate two important standing legs of current developments towards interoperable sensor webs: First the research questions addressed by research institutes and standardizing consortia, and second by open source software initiatives like 52 north that help to <b>bundle</b> developer <b>capacities</b> and therefore accelerate the entire process to set up interoperable sensor webs, which are – despite all efforts – still in its infancy...|$|R

Impaired health and low work motivation or low self-perceived work ability might mutually influence the probability of labour market participation at advanced working age. Even when opportunities for compensation exist, impaired health can alter expectations of one’s own ability to perform work and lead to a shift of preferences in life. Therefore, disentangling “the <b>bundle</b> of health <b>capacities</b> that influence the ability to perform market work […] from the bundle that affect the preference for market work” (Chirikos 1993, p.  306) is necessary.|$|R
30|$|In conclusion, {{our results}} {{demonstrate}} that antimicrobial-impregnated CVCs were {{more effective than}} standard non-impregnated CVCs in decreasing the rate of CRBSIs per 1000 catheter-days and catheter colonization with the application of <b>bundles.</b> Moreover, the <b>capacities</b> of catheters impregnated with chlorhexidine/silver sulfadiazine and other antibiotic catheters (5 -fluorouracil, vancomycin, benzalkonium chloride, teicoplanin, miconazole/rifampicin, minocycline, and minocycline/rifampin) are superior to those of traditional catheters in preventing CRBSIs and catheter colonization when applied with bundles. Despite their demonstrated efficacy, we could not determine whether other antibiotic catheters are superior to chlorhexidine/silver sulfadiazine-impregnated catheters. Compared to silver ion-impregnated CVCs, chlorhexidine/silver sulfadiazine antiseptic catheters reduce microbial colonization but do not reduce CRBSIs.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{argues for}} an inflationary and capacity-relative {{understanding}} of human enhancement technology. In doing so it echoes the approach followed by Buchanan (2011 a, 2011 b). Particular {{emphasis is placed on}} the point that capacities themselves are relative to demands placed on the organism by its environment. In the case of human beings this environment is institutionally structured. On the basis of the inflationary and capacity relative concept of enhancement I argue that the subject of enhancement must be understood in terms of a <b>bundle</b> of <b>capacities</b> that is both extended (Clark 1998) and ecological. This consequence of the inflationary enhancement concept has some surprising upshots, namely that the subject itself must be considered as a technological enhancement and not a "platform" or subjectum upon which the enhancement enterprise builds. This conclusion clashes, I argue, with some of the presuppositions of liberal philosophy, which starts by assuming a reflective subject. The paper ends with some reflection on the desirability of reflective subjectivity for human flourishing and addressing the ecological crisis.

We have devised a novel approach to the network restoration problem; prior to a failure network redundant capacity is preconfigured, using a distributed design protocol, so that any failure can immediately be restored. This method can realize restorable designs with low capacity redundancy and potentially very rapid restoration. The protocol executes in a peer-to-peer manner in the network's nodes {{eliminating the need for}} a centralized design mechanism. The protocol is simulated using OPNET modeler and a platform independent Java animation tool is used for realtime replay of the OPNET generated trace data...|$|R

Efficient performance incentives are maintained from a load-following {{obligation to supply}} energy above the strike price. The capacity payment fully hedges load from high spot prices, and reduces supplier risk as well. Market power is reduced in the spot market, since suppliers enter the spot market with a nearly balanced position in times of scarcity. Market power in the reliability market is addressed by not allowing existing supply to impact the capacity price. The approach, which has been adopted in New England and Colombia, is readily adapted to either a thermal system or a hydro system. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} {{the architecture of}} a network, in which the traffic flow is controlled by a market. The network access is controlled by a trusted access node, that separates traffic into best effort and first class traffic, adds a source route header, and shapes the traffic. The network core consists of rapid forwarding devices, such as label switches, and source routing gateways. Network services, including dynamic routing, load balancing, and fault tolerance, are built by <b>bundling</b> the transmission <b>capacity</b> in several independent network domains into a service, a bundle of resources with the right properties. The service is priced as financial derivative contract, and traded on a market, independent of the network access control. Besides describing the network model, we show how to implement parts of the network access node functionality on a standard Linux machine. The implementation has been tested on a system of virtual Linux machines...|$|R

The canister has three versions, one for each reactor type in Finland. The fuel is sealed into the canisters in whole fuel assemblies including the possible flow channel outside the <b>bundle.</b> The <b>capacity</b> of the canister is 12 assemblies of BWR or VVER 440 fuel and 4 assemblies of EPR fuel. The canister shall be tight with a high probability for at least 100 000 years. The good and long lasting tightness requires: • Good initial tightness that is achieved by high quality requirements and extensive • Quality control, Good corrosion resistance (over pack of micro-alloyed oxygen-free copper) and Mechanical strength of the canister that is ensured by analyses; Following loads are considered: hydrostatic ground water pressure, even and uneven swelling pressure of bentonite, thermal effects, and elevated hydrostatic pressure during glaciations.

Design-Prospective study. Patients- 25 consecutive patients, all with chronic symptomatic drug refractory atrial fibrillation, underwent His bundle ablation. Before this intervention all patients were on antiarrhythmic drugs to attain acceptable heart rate control and to relief symptoms. Main outcome measures-Exercise capacity, including measurements of V over dot O- 2, was examined before and after a mean interval of seven months following His <b>bundle</b> ablation. Results-Exercise <b>capacity</b> after His <b>bundle</b> ablation increased from a mean of 109 (SD 49) W to 118 (46) W (P < 0. 002), but V over dot O- 2 at peak exercise did not change significantly.

40|$|The steel {{production}} {{is a highly}} capital and energy intensive industry that due to recent raw materials’ price increase and lowered demand, it has been squeezed and forced to look more deeply on how to add value to the customer at lower operative costs. The project was carried out on site at the ArcelorMittal’s millin Esch-Belval, Luxembourg which comprises an integrated melt shop, continuous casting plant and the rolling mill with the objectives of proposing optimization rules for the cold sector of the rolling mill and to analyze {{the impact of the}} future truckbay shipment area. The course of action followed was to draw a Value Stream Map (VSM) {{in order to understand the}} plants’ current status and serve as a roadmap to build a discrete event simulation model that after its validation, served as a support tool to analyze what-if scenarios. Similarly, a current status analysis of the  shipment/stock area was conducted collecting statistics about potential truckshipments and finally proposing a series of recommendations for its operation. The main proposed solutions to optimize the rolling mill’s cold sector were:(a) Integer programming model to globally optimize the scrap level when cutting the mother beams to customer size beams. (b) Updating pacemaker parameters and (c) Local process time improvements. Concerning the future truck loading, the simulation model was used as a support tool to dimension the transition area between the cranes’ and forklift operations resulting in a 6 - 9 <b>bundles</b> buffer <b>capacity.</b> Additionally, the current length-based storage policy was found to have competitive objectives so a turnover class-based storage policy is proposed with A, B, C classes which should provide an improved organization of the stock and travel distance of the cranes.

40|$|Membrane protein {{structure}} and function is critically dependent on the surrounding environment. Consequently, utilizing a membrane mimetic that adequately models the native membrane environment is essential. A range of membrane mimetics are available but none generates a better model of native aqueous, interfacial, and hydrocarbon core environments than synthetic lipid bilayers. Transmembrane a-helices are very stable in lipid bilayers because of the low water content and low dielectric environment within the bilayer hydrocarbon core that strengthens intrahelical hydrogen bonds and hinders structural rearrangements within the transmembrane helices. Recent evidence from solid-state NMR spectroscopy illustrates that transmembrane a-helices, both in peptides and full-length proteins, appear to be highly uniformbased on the observation of resonance patterns in PISEMA spectra. Here, we quantitate {{for the first time}} through simulations what we mean by highly uniform structures. Indeed, helices in transmembrane peptides appear to have backbone torsion angles that are uniformwithin± 4 °. While individual helices can be structurally stable due to intrahelical hydrogen bonds, interhelical interactions within helical bundles can be weak and nonspecific, resulting in multiple packing arrangements. Some helical <b>bundles</b> have the <b>capacity</b> through their amino acid composition for hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions to stabilize the interhelical conformations and solid-stateNMRdata is shownhere for both of these situations...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} rigid {{aromatic}} templates that vary in size, shape, and directionality {{have been investigated}} in template-assembled synthetic 4 alpha-helix peptide <b>bundles</b> for their <b>capacity</b> to enhance the alpha-helicity of an amphiphilic peptide (DAATALANALKKL-[NHCH 2 CH 2 SH]). In aqueous phosphate buffer (10 mM, pH 7) the peptide has some innate helicity (similar to 30 %) which is concentration-independent between 1 and 250 mu M. Helicity is enhanced to 64 - 75 % when 4 equiv of the peptide are connected to aromatic templates based on benzene, benzanilide, or a cyclic octapeptide. This effect is concentration-independent by circular dichroism spectroscopy (3 - 60 mu M [TASP]), the TASPs are monomeric by sedimentation equilibrium experiments, and have comparable thermodynamic stabilities. Thus these templates induce intra-rather than inter-molecular peptide association and are equally effective despite variations in size, shapes and directionality. When the linker between the template and peptides is sufficently long, as in these cases, TASP formation is less sensitive to {{the dimensions of the}} template than to the communication between hydrophobic peptide side chains, which are the main determinants of helix separation, 4 alpha-helix bundle size and stability. This greatly simplifies approaches to developing small molecule mimetics of interacting protein surfaces. However template size, shape, and directionality may still be important when the linker is short or when assembled peptide surfaces are isolated from one another and unable to communicate...|$|R

We describe an in vitro model of such restitution using a human intestinal epithelial cell line, T 84. T 84 cells were grown on novel optically transparent type 1 collagen membranes without underlying filter supports. Mono-layers so grown display substantial barrier function (400 - 500 ohm * cm 2; 1. 3 ± 0. 4 nmol * h- * cm- 2 mannitol flux). Wounds made with micropipettes {{were accompanied by}} a fall in resis-tance and rise in monolayer permeability to mannitol and inu-lin. After injury, cells shouldering wounds migrated, by exten-sion of lamellipodia-like processes, to reseal wounds as defined by structural and functional criteria. F actin arcs crossed {{the base of the}} lamellipodia-like extensions and F actin micro-spikes projected from the leading edge of these extensions. Vil-lin, an epithelial-specific cytoskeletal protein with both F actin <b>bundling</b> and severing <b>capacities,</b> was also expressed at the leading edge in a pattern consistent with a regulatory role in the dynamic restructuring of lamellipodia. Lastly, myosin II was predominantly localized to the basal regions of lamellipodia, though occasional staining was seen close to the advancing edge.
