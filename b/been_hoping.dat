5|$|Not {{long after}} Germanicus reached Pannonia, Severus was {{attacked}} in Moesia, but successfully repelled the rebels. By the time Germanicus arrived the rebels had withdrawn to mountain fortresses {{from which they}} launched raids. The Romans were tactically unsuited at countering raids, so Tiberius had to utilize his auxiliary forces and divided his army into small detachments to cover more ground. Tiberius {{appears to have been}} conducting a war of attrition against the rebels who were now occupying strong defensive positions. In addition, the Romans began working to drive the rebels out of the countryside offering forgiveness to any tribes that would lay down their arms, and a scorched earth policy was implemented through which Tiberius may have <b>been</b> <b>hoping</b> to starve the enemy out. While most of his detachments saw little action at the time, Germanicus did defeat the Mazaei, a Dalmatian tribe.|$|E
5|$|The German {{government}} had <b>been</b> <b>hoping</b> that the Ottomans {{would enter the}} war to support them but the government in Istanbul was undecided. The Germanophile Ottoman War Minister, Enver Pasha, began conspiring with the German ambassador to bring the empire into the war. Attempts to secure widespread support in the government failed, so Enver decided conflict {{would have to be}} instigated. With the help of the Ottoman naval minister and German Admiral Wilhelm Souchon, Enver arranged for the Ottoman fleet to go out to sea on 29 October supposedly to perform maneuvers. They were to provoke Russian vessels into opening fire and then accuse them of inciting war. Instead, Souchon raided the Russian coast in a flagrant display of hostility, causing little lasting damage but enraging the Russians.|$|E
5|$|The {{allies were}} aware of Rupert's {{approach}} and had <b>been</b> <b>hoping</b> that reinforcements from the Midlands under Sir John Meldrum and the Earl of Denbigh could ward off this threat, but they learned that these forces could not intervene in time. The allied armies around York were separated from each other by rivers, and if Rupert attacked them in their siege lines he could destroy any one army before the other two could come to its aid. Therefore, they abandoned the siege {{on the night of}} 30 June, and concentrated their forces near the village of Hessay before taking position on Marston Moor, where they blocked Rupert's expected direct march to York (along the old Roman road named Ermine Street, the modern A59), and could easily move to their left to prevent Rupert making any move to the south via Wetherby.|$|E

5|$|The company {{reported}} a A$64 million loss in its 2008 financial year. By 2009, {{the global economic}} downturn, and regulatory uncertainty associated with MIS schemes, was putting the company under financial pressure, and it was seeking to improve its situation both through asset sales and refinancing of debt. Its debt levels had risen significantly: it had extended its debt financing with its banks from A$245million to A$350million in 2007. By September 2008 its total debt had ballooned to A$820million, of which A$376million was owed to its lead bankers, ANZ, Commonwealth Bank, BankWest and Mizuho. Great Southern had also <b>been</b> <b>hoping</b> to see {{a rise in the}} price obtained for its woodchips, but was unsuccessful in its 2009 negotiations with Japanese customers.|$|E

His highlight was the 2–1 League Cup victory over local rivals Sheffield United and victory over Premier League West Ham United.|$|E
25|$|In the end, most {{airlines}} favored lower {{operating costs}} over a marginal increase in speed, {{and the project}} did not attract the interest for which Boeing had <b>been</b> <b>hoping.</b> The Sonic Cruiser project was finally abandoned by December 2002 {{in favor of the}} slower but more fuel-efficient 7E7 (later renamed Boeing 787 Dreamliner). Much of the research from the Sonic Cruiser was applied to the 787, including carbon fiber reinforced plastic for the fuselage and wings, bleedless engines, cockpit and avionics design.|$|E

25|$|Kidd {{kept the}} French passes of Quedagh Merchant, {{as well as}} the vessel itself. While the passes were at best a dubious defence of his capture, British {{admiralty}} and vice-admiralty courts (especially in North America) heretofore had often winked at privateers' excesses into piracy, and Kidd may have <b>been</b> <b>hoping</b> that the passes would provide the legal fig leaf that would allow him to keep Quedagh Merchant and her cargo. Renaming the seized merchantman Adventure Prize, he set sail for Madagascar.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the success}} of the evening, trouble begins when Senator Keeley's chauffeur betrays him to two tabloid journalists who have <b>been</b> <b>hoping</b> for a scoop on the Coalition story.

When she finally arrives, she unknowingly reveals the deceptions. Though Armand and Albert scramble to find a new cover story, Val instead confesses to the scheme and identifies Albert as his true parent.|$|E
25|$|By 12 October Third Army {{was held}} on the Selle River. On 14 October Plumer resumed his advance in the north, taking Roulers and {{reaching}} Courtrai. On the same day President Wilson rejected German peace overtures, causing the Germans to abandon the Belgian Coast {{and the city of}} Lille (17 October) which they had <b>been</b> <b>hoping</b> to hold as bargaining chips. On the same day Fourth Army crossed the River Sambre and plans were made to advance on the River Selle, amidst worrying signs of a stiffening of German resistance.|$|E

They were rarely in the same {{place at the same time}} due to their climbing projects. They also fought over whose projects had priority.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, King Phraates V of Parthia had seized Armenia {{with the help}} of a {{nationalist}} party, and expelled Tigranes IV, the king installed by Rome. Historian Ferrero speculates that Phraates may have <b>been</b> <b>hoping</b> to use Armenia as a bargaining chip to secure the release of his sons who were held captive by the Romans. Roman supremacy in Asia depended on its possession of Armenia as a protectorate. Before Rome could deal with the Parthians in Armenia, it would first need to make its Syrian legions available, which were still tied down in Palestine.|$|E
25|$|The {{military}} action at Waitara brought the result Kingi had <b>been</b> <b>hoping</b> for and within 10 {{days of the}} Te Kohia battle, about 500 warriors from the Taranaki, Ngati Ruanui and Nga Rauru iwi converged on the New Plymouth area to provide support. The warriors built an entrenched and stockaded pā named Kaipopo {{on one of the}} hills at Waireka, about 8km southwest of New Plymouth and 4km from the Omata stockade that lay {{on the road to the}} town. The area was scattered with some houses built by European settlers, and on 27 March, five settlers, including two boys, were either shot or tomahawked in the Omata district.|$|E

25|$|After his {{purchase}} in Bulgaria, Kamo {{traveled to}} Berlin and delivered {{a letter from}} Lenin to a prominent Bolshevik, Dr. Yakov Zhitomirsky, asking the doctor for medical assistance to treat Kamo's still injured eye. Lenin had <b>been</b> <b>hoping</b> to help {{the man who had}} successfully executed the robbery, but unintentionally turned Kamo over to a double agent. Zhitomirsky had been secretly working as an agent of the Russian government and quickly informed the Okhrana about his encounter with Kamo. The Okhrana then asked the Berlin police to arrest Kamo. When they did so, they found a forged Austrian passport and a suitcase with 200 detonators, which he was planning to use in another large bank robbery.|$|E
25|$|When Von Teese was a teenager, {{her mother}} {{took her to}} buy her first bra, made from plain white cotton, {{and gave her a}} plastic egg {{containing}} a pair of wrinkly, flesh-colored pantyhose. Von Teese says she was disappointed, as she had <b>been</b> <b>hoping</b> to receive beautiful lacy garments and stockings, of the type she had glimpsed in her father's Playboy magazines. This fueled her passion for lingerie. She worked in a lingerie store as a salesgirl when she was 15, eventually as a buyer. Von Teese has been fond of wearing elaborate lingerie such as corsets and basques with fully fashioned stockings ever since. In college, Von Teese studied historic costuming and aspired to work as a stylist for films. She is a trained costume designer, often designing (and copyrighting) her photo shoots herself.|$|E
25|$|In December 2010, {{organizers}} {{announced that}} they had reached a deal with BYU {{to play in the}} 2013 edition of the Fight Hunger Bowl. The Cougars, who became conference independent during the 2011 season, were scheduled to fill a slot originally allotted to a team from the Western Athletic Conference, which discontinued football prior to the 2013 season. After defeating the Boise State Broncos for their sixth win of the season on October 25, bowl director Gary Cavalli extended an invitation to play in the game. Cavalli stated in 2010 that he had <b>been</b> <b>hoping</b> to secure the Cougars' participation in the game since 2002. If the Cougars did not earn enough wins to become bowl eligible, an alternate team from the Atlantic Coast Conference would have replaced them; though they finished bowl eligible, one ESPN writer opined they were even better than their record indicated.|$|E

25|$|After the Sanhedrin trial Jesus {{is taken}} to Pilate's court in the praetorium. Only in the Gospel of Luke, finding that Jesus, being from Galilee, belonged to Herod Antipas' jurisdiction, Pilate decides to send Jesus to Herod. Herod Antipas (the same man who had {{previously}} ordered the death of John the Baptist) had wanted to see Jesus for a long time, because he had <b>been</b> <b>hoping</b> to observe one of the miracles of Jesus. However, Jesus says almost nothing in response to Herod's questions, or the vehement accusations of the chief priests and the scribes. Herod and his soldiers mock Jesus, put a gorgeous robe on him, as the King of the Jews, and sent him back to Pilate. And Herod and Pilate become friends with each other that day: for before they were at enmity. After questioning Jesus and receiving very few replies, Herod sees Jesus as no threat and returns him to Pilate.|$|E
25|$|George Profous, a {{forester}} {{for what}} had by then become the state's Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) wrote in an early 1990s planning document that the aged, deteriorating tower should be dismantled and removed, not only due to its age but because, out of use, {{it was no longer}} permitted on state-owned Forest Preserve land, which New York's constitution requires be kept forever wild. Worried residents of Denning and the nearby hamlet of Claryville contacted the Catskill Center for Conservation and Development, a regional advocacy group, to see what they could do to save it, a development Profous had <b>been</b> <b>hoping</b> for. DEC's guidelines governing the use of the Forest Preserve do allow the retention of otherwise incompatible structures within it if they enhance the public's understanding of the Forest Preserve, and many visitors and past observers wrote about how seeing the vastness of the Catskill wildlands at once helped them appreciate the importance of protecting it.|$|E
25|$|After issuing the {{challenge}} to McKinney, Joe begins to find himself becoming very popular around the office for his bravery. Meg and Natalie, however, do not feel fighting McKinney will solve anything, and both attempt to tell Joe as much, to no avail. Joe seeks out the aid of an ex B movie star-turned-martial arts instructor named Chuck Scarett (Jim Belushi) to teach him to defend himself. Things seem to finally be going right for Joe, as he has begun to see Meg and has even been given a promotion at work he had <b>been</b> <b>hoping</b> for. When Meg realizes Jeremy (Greg Germann), a colleague she works closely with for the company (who {{also happens to be}} attracted to her), only gave Joe a non-existing position at the office to prevent him from suing the company, she resigns in fear that she might one day have to demote or even fire Joe. Meg again tries to persuade Joe not to fight McKinney, and finally gives him an ultimatum: if he does not call off the fight with McKinney, their relationship is over.|$|E
