He used {{to take me to}} see cowboy movies all the time when I was a little boy <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> cowboy movies. He got a cowboy name for me, which was Smokey Joe. So from the time I was three years old if people asked me what my name was I didn't tell them my name was William, I told them my name was Smokey Joe. That's what everyone called me until I was about 12 and then I dropped the Joe part. I've heard that story about him giving it to me because I'm a light skinned Black man but that's not true.|$|E
500|$|The Film Book of J.R.R. Tolkien's the Lord of the Rings, {{published}} by Ballantine Books on October 12, 1978, still {{referred to the}} sequel in the book's inside cover jacket. Bakshi states {{that he would never}} have made the film if he had known what would happen during the production. He is quoted as saying that the reason he made the film was [...] "to save it for Tolkien, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> the Rings very much." ...|$|E
500|$|I {{spent a lot}} of {{time after}} [...] left the studio {{tightening}} up the rough. In fact, I'm sure she let me mix it just <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> the track so much! I mixed this in the fantastic penthouse room in Jungle City. This record was, of course, about the vocals — but a lot of it was about the production elements too. Everything had to be audible; there's some interesting percussion, and the hook had to feel nice and big.|$|E

500|$|Rita is {{presented}} in the series as a loving and caring mother. As a result of being abused by her husband, Rita has no interest in sex, which suits the asexual Dexter perfectly. She developed a strong character. At the beginning of season two, the producers approached Benz about character growth. They wanted to make Rita stronger and less shattered than she was in the first season. Benz has said that she was [...] "Very sad to hear that. <b>Because</b> <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> playing her in season one where she was this very damaged, fragile bird who was just struggling so hard to make a better world for her kids, but just could not do it." ...|$|E
500|$|Tim Burton {{first saw}} Stephen Sondheim's 1979 stage musical, , as a CalArts student in London in 1980. Burton {{recalled}} his experience {{of seeing the}} show, saying, [...] "I was still a student, I didn't know if I would be making movies or working in a restaurant, I {{had no idea what}} I would be doing. I just wandered into the theatre and it just blew me away because I'd never really seen anything that had the mixture of all those elements. I actually went three nights in a row <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> it so much." [...] Although not a fan of the musical genre, Burton was struck by how cinematic the musical was, and repeatedly attended subsequent performances. He described it as a silent film with music, and was [...] "dazzled both by the music and its sense of the macabre." [...] When his directing career took off in the late 1980s, Burton approached Sondheim with a view to making a cinematic adaptation, but nothing came of it. In Sondheim's words, [...] " [...] went off and did other things." ...|$|E
