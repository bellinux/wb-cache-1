A particular characteristic of this measuring technique is the encapsulation of the hardening cement-based material in a specially designed, corrugated polyethylene mould; this effectively prevents moisture loss and ensures insignificant restraint during the hardening of the specimen. The employed technique is computer-controlled, and allows measurements immediately after casting, but its use is limited to aggregates with maximum size of 2.5  mm.

Raman spectra {{have shown that the}} quality of the diamond eposited on the etched substrate was better than that on the as-polished substrate. The facet size of the diamond film surface on the as-polished substrate was smaller than that on the etched specimen.

In this thesis the adhesion between a multilayer ceramic chemical vapor deposition (CVD) coating and a cemented carbide with the alternative binder phases consisting of iron (Fe), nickel (Ni) and cobalt (Co) has been studied. First of all, the fracture surfaces showed that the CVD coating was able to grow on all cemented carbides, regardless of which <b>binder</b> <b>phase.</b> To evaluate the adhesion, scratch tests were performed on all samples. The results from the scratch tests were not as expected. No chipping of the coating down to the cemented carbide occurred on any of the samples and the samples with the hardest cemented carbide did not get the highest critical load, which it should according to the literature if all other parameters were the same. Instead the sample with the <b>binder</b> <b>phase</b> consisting of 73 wt% iron and 27 wt% nickel had the highest critical load.

High temperature compressive creep tests have been performed under a load of 900 MPa at 900, 1000 and 1100 °C and the test bars were deformed to different strains. Grain size measurements by the linear intercept method showed that WC grain growth took place during compressive creep testing of the Cr doped material, and that this growth took place preferentially in the plane perpendicular to the load axis. Transmission electron microscopy showed that the WC grains in the crept materials had a significantly increased dislocation density, {{with a large number}} of dislocation lines merging at the grain surfaces.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{understand}} the mechanisms behind the plastic deformation of WC‐Co based cemented carbides. The microstructure of two series with different WC grain size was investigated before and after creep deformation using quantitative microscopy, atom probe tomography, and transmission electron microscopy.

The second series consisted of two WC-Co based cemented carbides with coarser WC grain size used for mining applications, an un-doped and a Cr-doped WC-Co based materials. In both materials, the <b>binder</b> <b>phase</b> represented 10 vol% of the total volume. High temperature compressive creep tests were performed under a stress of 900 MPa at 900, 1000 and 1100 °C and 300 MPa at 1100 °C, and the test bars were deformed to different strains. A heat treatment was also performed at 1000 °C {{in order to see}} the effect of an applied load on WC grain growth. Preferential WC grain growth perpendicular to the applied load was found to occur during creep deformation at 1000 and 1100 °C. WC grains in the crept materials had a significantly increased dislocation density, with a large number of dislocation lines merging on the grain surfaces. It is suggested that merging matrix dislocations having a screw component may act as nucleation points to grow new layers of W and C. The <b>binder</b> <b>phase</b> grains became, on the other hand, smaller during creep deformation at 1000 °C, and lost their finger-like morphology. This may be explained by <b>binder</b> <b>phase</b> grain rotation caused by dislocation glide. The crept microstructures had an increased number of density of WC/WC grain boundaries infiltrated by the <b>binder</b> <b>phase.</b> This suggests that grain boundary sliding occurred, accommodated by <b>binder</b> <b>phase</b> infiltration. Some WC grain surfaces facing the infiltrated grain boundaries had a step surface of an angle of 90 and 120 °. The atoms at the surface were rearranged to reduce the surface energy. Intergranular cavities were also formed during creep deformation. This cavity formation indicates that also unaccommodated grain boundary sliding took place during creep deformation.

The titanium carbide based carbide composites (TiC-based cermets) are prospective candidates for tooling in sheet-metal forming (stamping) processes. The wear resistance (adhesive and functional) of some TiC-Fe/Ni cermets is better than that of hardmetals. Previous {{studies have shown that}} TiC carbide grains better absorb plastic deformation during cyclic loading (fatigue) and have lower fatigue sensitivity if compared to tungsten carbide grains in conventional hardmetal (WC-Co). The core-rim (double-carbide) structure of the carbide grains is characteristic for TiC-based cermets. The effect of core-rim structure on the behavior of the cermets is poorly investigated. Such a structure is highly dependent on the production technology (powder metallurgy routes) as the difference between the coefficients of thermal expansion of components is obvious cause of high residual stresses appearing after sintering of pressed powder parts. Although, the thermal expansion coefficients of TiC-based cermets are lower than those of WC-based hardmetals. The instrumented indentation technique is used to determine the scope of residual stresses in TiC-based cermets. The first steps are made for evaluation of the residual stresses proportions of the carbide and <b>binder</b> <b>phases,</b> core-rim structures in carbide composites...|$|R
40|$|TiC xN 1 -x- 15 wt. %Co cermets were {{obtained}} by a mechanically induced self-sustaining reaction (MSR) and sintered by spark plasma sintering (SPS) technique at different temperatures (1200 - 1400 Â°C) for 1 min in vacuum under a uniaxial load of 80 MPa. The evolution of microstructure and mechanical properties was investigated. SPS allowed high densification with limited grain growth at a relatively low temperature. Material sintered at 1300 Â°C showed a good combination of mechanical properties with Vickers hardness of 17. 1 Â± 0. 5 GPa, fracture toughness of 5. 51 Â± 0. 29 MPa m 1 / 2 and bending strength of 904 Â± 12 MPa. Lower sintering temperature resulted in a decrease in bending strength due to poor cohesion between the ceramic and <b>binder</b> <b>phases.</b> An increase in sintering temperature would allow tailoring the cermet microstructure and, therefore, adjusting the Vickers hardness/fracture toughness relation.

40|$|The 2 -dimensional XRD (GADDS) {{was used}} to {{characterize}} the microstructure of an applied self-leveling compound (SLC). A calcium aluminate cement based SLC was prepared on two different substrates (water absorbent and non-water absorbent) to determine the vertical distribution of the crystalline phases. The application of the GADDS enables the detection of the phase composition of the hydrating mortar in horizontal slices. Thus the analysis could be carried out in position-sensitive mode at three different areas: near bottom, in the center, {{and at the top}} of the mortar. For investigation of SLCs from the very early hydration stage up to 10 hours of hydration, a custom-made in-situ sample holder for the measurements was designed and constructed. The combination of the GADDS and the custom-made in-situ sample holder provides the possibility to characterize additionally the time-dependent phase composition within the SLC. The non-absorbent substrate has no effect on the hydration of the <b>binder</b> <b>phases</b> but the absorbent substrate influences the formation of ettringite. In the top layer of the SLC the ettringite content is reduced during the first hours of hydration. The absorbing forces of the substrate lead to migration of the mix water to the substrate. This lack of water results in reduced formation of ettringite...|$|R
