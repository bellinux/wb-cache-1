40|$|Biomarkers such as brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and fl uid-management {{protocols}} {{are emerging}} to improve {{weaning from mechanical ventilation}} and prevent complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 1, 2 However, there is scarce solid evidence to add both processes as real tools to make decisions. We read {{with great interest}} the study published in CHEST (July 2014) by Mekontso Dessap et al 3 report-ing on decreased incidence of VAP in patients on depletive fl uid management. However, there are some questions that should be addressed for proper clinical extrapolations. First, patients with “chronic heart diseases ” were included in the study.

30|$|The {{state of}} Ca and Mg {{on the surface}} of {{titanium}} (i.e., whether they are present as ions, crystals, etc.) remains unclear. In our pilot experiment, we tried to remove surface Ca or Mg using EDTA solutions, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> detected <b>Ca</b> and Mg peaks on the titanium surface even after the EDTA treatment (data not shown). In addition, despite the difference in experimental conditions (concentration, temperature, etc.), a possible calcium titanate peak was reportedly detected {{on the surface of}} titanium hydrothermally treated with CaCl 2 solution [21]. The resolution capability of our XPS apparatus was relatively low so that we could not obtain similar results; in our case, however, some Ca on the surface of titanium may also be present as calcium titanate. In addition, the surface of calcium titanate reportedly releases some Ca ions [22]. In this context, the state of surface Ca on the surface of titanium hydrothermally treated with CaCl 2 could be presumed to comprise both ion and stable compounds.|$|R
40|$|Abstract The Firing Squad Synchronization Problem {{is one of}} the {{classical}} problems for cellular automata. In this paper we consider the case of more than one general. A synchronous and an asynchronous version of the problem are considered. In the latter case the generals may start their activities at different times. In the synchronous case there are optimumtime solutions. Very simple and elegant techniques for constructing one of them are the main contribution of this paper on the algorithmic side. For the asynchronous case an exact formula for the optimum synchronization time of each instance is derived. We prove that no CA can solve all instances in optimum time, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> describe a <b>CA</b> whose running time is very close to it; it only needs additional log n steps...|$|R

40|$|We present several {{algorithms}} {{for identification}} of new proteins in superfamilies with low primary sequence conservation. The low conservation of primary sequence in protein superfamilies such as Thioredoxin-fold (Trx-fold) makes conventional {{methods such as}} hidden Markov models (HMMs) difficult to use. Therefore, we use structural properties to build our classifiers. These structural properties include secondary structure patterns as well as various properties of the residues in the protein sequences. We use this information to model proteins via hidden Markov models, support vector machines and algorithms in the multiple-instance learning model.
