Voorhis also opposed dominance of big business in the war effort. Congress, for the most part, ignored Voorhis's pleas.|$|E

25|$|For 20 years William McBurney, head of Belfast-based Outlet Records {{for over}} 40 years, {{received}} royalties from {{the sales of}} vinyl and CDs, including many compilations. He claimed that he bought the rights in good faith from Jim Slye, who managed Horslips from the late 1970s until the band's final gig. However, the quality of these releases left much to be desired. Shoddy artwork and poor sound meant {{that most of these}} releases were sold at <b>bargain</b> <b>prices,</b> leaving the five former band members disillusioned. They fought back and on 7 March 1999 won a court victory in Belfast for copyright ownership and a substantial financial settlement. Horslips are now once again fully in control of their music and they released the entire back catalogue on CD in 2000/2001 with updated artwork and digitally remastered sound.|$|E

[...] Drew defeated Diefenbaker for the leadership. [...] St. Laurent called an election for June 1949, and Howe again was successful in fundraising from corporate backers. Major corporations from the CPR to Eaton's contributed to the well financed Liberal campaign. The Liberals won a huge victory, taking 190seats to 40 for the Tories, and Howe again won Port Arthur easily. [...] Drew had used Howe's record as an election issue, accusing him of being power mad and of selling off Crown Corporations for <b>bargain</b> <b>prices,</b> but the allegations got little traction. According to Howe, the only result of Drew's attacks [...] "was {{to give me a}} record majority in Port Arthur!" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{game was}} later sold at <b>bargain</b> <b>prices,</b> bundled with Ace 2 and {{received}} several retrospect reviews. Commodore User rated the C64 bargain game 8/10 comparing it more to aerial combat simulator {{than just a}} flight simulator. They noted plenty of gameplay and some simulation to keep the player occupied. Computer and Video Games awarded the game 90% for C64 and 87% for Spectrum version praising the game and describing it as [...] "essential purchase". Zzap!64 gave Ace 67% and felt that, while the original reviewer's opinions held true, the game did not stand up to time, with graphics being tacky and sparse and having programming issues. Commodore Force later gave the game 57% and noted that, although receiving praise during release, its lacking gameplay did not age well. On the other hand, Commodore Format gave the game 3/4 points and lauded the game even by 1991's standards. While they noted simple start, they also noted good graphics, fast-paced gameplay with superb dogfights and basic simulation. Commodore Format rated the Ace and Ace 2 bundle at 89% calling it an [...] "indisputable bargain". They praised the fast and uncluttered gameplay with simple objectives, while remarked that the graphics were not the best. Your Commodore rated the bundle 87/100 describing the bundle as closer to arcade games rather than flight simulators, concluding that they were good games [...] "with a few bugs".|$|E
500|$|Residents of the company-owned {{houses were}} given the option to buy the {{structures}} at <b>bargain</b> <b>prices,</b> provided they move them out of town. For many, it took a great chunk of their life savings to relocate elsewhere, taking their homes in caravans along the highways and leaving behind empty foundations. Most Elcor residents purchased lots in the surrounding communities, trying to beat land speculators. In the few months after it became official that Elcor's fate was sealed, land prices skyrocketed. Lots that had originally been priced at $75 were now being sold {{for as much as}} $500. Most of the remaining families moved a mile west to Gilbert, although other homes were replanted in nearby McKinley. The last vestiges of the old mining community were gone by 1956. Every building was torn down or removed. All that remained for some years after were old foundations, sidewalks, rusting stoves, pipes, bottles and yard shrubbery, formerly visible from the old section of Minnesota State Highway 135 between Gilbert and Biwabik. A rusted fire hydrant adorned what was once a street corner, and a porcelain toilet bowl remained bolted to a concrete floor. An abandoned rail line for the Duluth, Missabe and Iron Range Railway went through {{what was left of the}} town site. Mine shafts were boarded up with old timbers. After everyone had left, the company dumped heaps of iron ore on the roads leading into Elcor, and in the process a ghost town was made out of what was once a thriving community.|$|E

Although the Curtiss JN series was {{originally}} produced as a training aircraft for the U.S. Army, the [...] "Jenny" [...] (the common nickname derived from [...] "JN-4", with an open-topped four appearing as a Y) continued after World War I as a civil aircraft, as it became the [...] "backbone of American postwar [...] aviation." [...] Thousands of surplus Jennys were sold at <b>bargain</b> <b>prices</b> to private owners in the years after the war and became central to the barnstorming era that helped awaken America to civil aviation through much of the 1920s.|$|E
2500|$|The {{political}} crisis of 1458 {{was the first}} serious challenge to the Medici rule. The cost of wars had been borne by the great families of Florence, and disproportionately so by Medici's opponents. A number of them (Serragli, Baroncelli, Mancini, Vespucci, Gianni) were practically ruined and had to sell their properties, and those were acquired by Medici's partisans at <b>bargain</b> <b>prices.</b> The opposition used partial relaxation of Medici control of the republic institutions to demand political reforms, freedom of speech in the councils and a greater share in the decision-making. [...] Medici's party response was to use threats of force from private armies and Milanese troops and arranging a popular assembly dominated by Cosimo's supporters. It exiled the opponents of the regime and introduced the open vote in councils, ``in order to unmask the anti-Medician rebels".|$|E
2500|$|Owing to the Yankees' {{ownership}} of the team, New York City FC announced on March 11, 2016 that its matches would also be subject to this policy. At the team's March 13, 2016 home opener, although the team stated {{that they would be}} phasing in mobile ticketing by introducing additional verification steps for printed tickets before the policy takes full effect in April, reports indicated that the stadium was turning away fans with printed tickets, leading to long queue lines, as well as few attendees inside the stadium itself. In an interview with WFAN radio, Yankees COO Lonn Trost explained that the measures were to help combat ticket resale, arguing that the team did not want fans to purchase [...] "premium" [...] seats at <b>bargain</b> <b>prices,</b> because they would be filled by [...] "someone who has never sat in a premium location [...] ".|$|E

2500|$|He had {{his local}} patrons and {{was known to}} all, since he could be found {{painting}} in distinctive places, always wearing a suit. From 5 to 15 July 1924, a retrospective of his work {{was held in the}} then new gymnasium of the Sichelschule. He was named an honorary citizen of the town in 1928; he presented the town with a self-portrait, and they bought two panoramas of the town with backgrounds of the Swabian Alps, in one case between Hohenzollern Castle and the Schalksburg and in the other between Lochenhörnle and the Plettenberg. All three pictures are preserved in the Eckenfelderzimmer (Eckenfelder Room) in the town hall, which is now used for weddings. A street was named in his honour in 1931, for his 70th birthday. To express his gratitude, Eckenfelder offered the town their choice of twelve pictures at <b>bargain</b> <b>prices.</b> Making their selection, they noted that [...] "the earlier pictures are significantly more valuable than the ones from the present".|$|E
2500|$|Speculative {{economic}} bubbles are {{an obvious}} anomaly, {{in that the}} market often appears {{to be driven by}} buyers operating on escalating market sentiment/ [...] irrational exuberance, who take little notice of underlying value. These bubbles are typically followed by an overreaction of frantic selling, allowing shrewd investors to buy stocks at <b>bargain</b> <b>prices.</b> Rational investors have difficulty profiting by shorting irrational bubbles because, {{in the words of a}} famous saying attributed to John Maynard Keynes, [...] "Markets can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent." [...] Sudden market crashes as happened on Black Monday in 1987 are mysterious from the perspective of efficient markets, but allowed as a rare statistical event under the weak-form of EMH. Benoit Mandelbrot has argued that market bubbles are not anomalous but rather characteristic of price dynamics described by power laws such as Pareto, Zipf [...] or Tracy-Widom [...] combined with persistence in price change trends.|$|E
2500|$|Shortly {{after the}} Confiscation Act of 1862 became {{effective}} in September General Butler increasingly relied upon it {{as a means}} of grabbing cotton. Since the Act permitted confiscation of property owned by anyone [...] "aiding the Confederacy," [...] Butler reversed his earlier policy of encouraging trade by refusing to confiscate cotton brought into New Orleans for sale. First he conducted a census in which 4,000 respondents failing to pledge loyalty to the Union were banished and their property seized. It was sold at ridiculously low auction prices where Andrew was often the prime buyer. Next the general sent expeditions into the countryside with no military purpose other than to confiscate cotton from residents assumed to be disloyal. Once brought into New Orleans the cotton would be similarly sold in rigged auctions. To maintain correct appearances, auction proceeds were dutifully held for the benefit of [...] "just claimants", but the Butler consortium still ended-up owning the cotton at <b>bargain</b> <b>prices.</b> Always inventive of new terminology to achieve his ends, Butler sequestered (i.e. made vulnerable to confiscation) such [...] "properties" [...] in all of Louisiana beyond parishes surrounding New Orleans.|$|E

2500|$|In March 1936, the Hammarlund Manufacturing Company {{initiated}} {{the first of}} the famous “Super-Pro” line, the SP-10 receiver, followed in January 1937 by the SP-100. Their efforts to improve the design resulted in October 1939 with the SP-200 series, an 18-tube, single conversion superhet receiver. The SP-200 series Super-Pro receivers were manufactured through 1945, with thousands delivered to the military during World War II; they saw wide use by the U.S. Signal Corps as the BC-779. During World War II, government agencies like the FBI used the 200 Series Super-Pro at their listening posts. [...] Many were used at ground stations in England to communicate with the Royal Air Force and U.S. Air Force armadas that flew bombing missions over Germany. According to a November 1940 QST Magazine ad, [...] "The fact that 'Super-Pro' receivers are used extensively by the U.S. Signal Corps and many other governmental departments, speaks for itself." [...] At the end of the war, the market was flooded with surplus Super-Pro receivers at <b>bargain</b> <b>prices,</b> which may be a reason many working examples of this model are still found today. From 1946 to 1948, Hammarlund produced the SP-400 Super Pro for the amateur radio market. In 1947 the SP-600 Super-Pro receiver, which surpassed the SP-200 in performance, was introduced. The SP-600 series were widely used throughout the world for military, laboratory and commercial application.|$|E

Oakland had entered upon a boom, and from the West Oakland stables had come an urgent letter for more horses. So Billy was out, early and late, {{scouring}} the surrounding country for young work animals. In this way, at the start, he learned his valley thoroughly. There was also a clearing out at the West Oakland stables of mares whose feet had been knocked out on the hard city pave meets, and he was offered first choice at <b>bargain</b> <b>prices.</b> They were good animals.
