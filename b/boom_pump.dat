25|$|Japan still {{struggles to}} keep {{water on the}} {{reactors}} to cool them and prevent further meltdown. Russian Antonov An-124 cargo planes fly out of Atlanta and Los Angeles, each carrying a huge concrete <b>boom</b> <b>pump.</b> The two 95-ton boom pumps, which TEPCO purchased for $2million each, can be operated from two miles away by remote control. Each <b>boom</b> <b>pump</b> can direct focused streams of water into the damaged reactors.|$|E
50|$|During the 2011 Japanese nuclear {{accidents}} at the Fukushima plant, multiple Putzmeister concrete boom pumps {{were flown}} to Japan from {{locations around the}} world. After the initial success of a M58-5 unit, additional M62-6s and 70Z's were transported to Japan on-board chartered Antonov An-124s, the world's second largest cargo plane. The 70Z is the world's largest <b>boom</b> <b>pump,</b> able to reach over 220 feet, and able to be controlled remotely from 2 mi away. The pumps will be deployed to try to stabilise the four reactors with additional water pumping capacity.|$|E
25|$|TEPCO {{does not}} plan to take a Chernobyl {{approach}} to resolving the nuclear power plant crisis by entombing the radioactive material in concrete. If this decision were to change, the <b>boom</b> <b>pumps</b> could be retrofitted to deliver concrete for that purpose.|$|R
50|$|The first type of {{concrete}} pump {{is attached to}} a truck or longer units are on semi-trailers. It is known as a <b>boom</b> concrete <b>pump</b> because it uses a remote-controlled articulating robotic arm (called a boom) to place concrete accurately. <b>Boom</b> <b>pumps</b> are used on most of the larger construction projects as they are capable of pumping at very high volumes and because of the labour saving nature of the placing boom. They are a revolutionary alternative to line-concrete pumps.|$|R
50|$|Since 1975, Conco {{has become}} one of the largest {{concrete}} pumping companies in the U.S., and has developed the required resources to customize concrete pumping for the most challenging projects. In an effort to improve the air quality at jobsites, Conco was one of the first companies on the West Coast to invest in long <b>boom</b> <b>pumps</b> that met all of the newest emissions standards. They have pumping equipment located in Northern California, Southern California and Washington State.|$|R
50|$|Greaves Cotton part of Thapar Group {{manufacturers}} of automotive engine (diesel and petrol engines for three- and four-wheelers), construction equipments gensets and farm equipments has their manufacturing unit at Ranipet, Vellore. Greaves Cotton {{plans to expand}} its construction equipment products range. This 1,700-crore multi-product company, has signed a pact with Samil of South Korea seeking technical know-how for products such as stationary concrete <b>pumps</b> and <b>boom</b> <b>pumps.</b> The company is also planning to expand its diesel engine manufacturing capacity at this plant.|$|R
5000|$|The massive mat pour {{required}} {{a fleet of}} 227 trucks that made 10 to 14 concrete drops {{for a total of}} 2,100 trips. Conco used eighteen concrete <b>boom</b> <b>pumps</b> strategically located around the site to place 82 million pounds of concrete to complete an almost 20 foot-thick foundation. The mat pour was for the new Wilshire Grand Center that is being built by the Turner Construction Company in downtown Los Angeles and is slated to become the tallest building in the U.S. west of the Mississippi. 5 ...|$|R
50|$|The second main type of {{concrete}} pump is either {{mounted on a}} truck or placed on a trailer, and it is {{commonly referred to as}} a line pump or trailer-mounted concrete pump. This pump requires steel or flexible concrete placing hoses to be manually attached to the outlet of the machine. Those hoses are linked together and lead to wherever the concrete needs to be placed. Line pumps normally pump concrete at lower volumes than <b>boom</b> <b>pumps</b> and are used for smaller volume concrete placing applications such as swimming pools, sidewalks, and single family home concrete slabs and most ground slabs.|$|R
25|$|During {{the morning}} Self-Defense Force {{helicopters}} drop water four {{times on the}} spent-fuel pools of units 3 and 4. They measure radiation field of 3.75 Sv/h above Unit 3. In the afternoon it is reported that the unit 4 spent-fuel pool was filled with water {{and none of the}} fuel rods were exposed. Construction work is started to supply a working external electrical power source to all six units of Fukushima I. Starting at 7pm, police and fire water trucks attempt to spray water into the unit 3 reactor with high pressure hoses. Japanese authorities inform the IAEA that engineers are laying an external grid power line cable to unit 2. After watching the helicopter effort on TV Kazunori Hasegawa, president of Chuo Construction, calls the government and offers the use of his two truck-mounted concrete <b>boom</b> <b>pumps</b> to spray water directly into the reactors. TEPCO did not respond for three days, and then stated it would wait for the arrival of similar pumps obtained elsewhere.|$|R
40|$|A new {{asbestos}} removal system called EnviroSystem(TM) {{has been developed}} by CUPS Systems, Inc., and GRI (Gas Research Institute). It basically comprises a portable line traveling system that is composed of a high-pressure water jet coating removal device, called HydroKleaner, a vacuum <b>pump,</b> a side <b>boom,</b> a <b>pump</b> sled, a process sled, and a 20 cu. yd. disposal container. The system is operated by workers wearing protective gear and clothing...|$|R
2500|$|On 1 September 1950, the {{squadron}} {{was the first}} to receive the improved KB-29P, which was equipped with a <b>boom</b> and used <b>pumps</b> to deliver the fuel more rapidly. [...] However, {{the squadron}} remained below strength until 1952.|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} for rapid appearance of Asian soybean rust has many growers re-evaluating sprayers. Because fungicide application requirements {{differ from those}} of commonly used systemic herbicides (e. g., glyphosate), in most cases nozzles will need to be changed and the adequacy of <b>pumps,</b> <b>booms,</b> and other plumbing system components will need to be checked. Due to lack of Midwestern experience in foliar fungicide application into the soybean canopy, current recommendations are based on other fungicide application work or experience in South America...|$|R
40|$|By {{far there}} {{is lack of}} {{research}} on different working conditions between rigid and flexible dynamics of truck mounted concrete <b>pump</b> <b>booms.</b> First a 3 D model has been established by using virtual prototyping technology of a 37 m long boom in Pro/Engineering software. Then the rigid body simulation model has been built. Next modal superimposition method is adopted to change the 4 rigid body booms into flexible ones. Kinematics law and dynamic characteristics of 4 common working conditions had been studied then. Next tip displacement and the first boom hydraulic cylinder force of the 4 working conditions between rigid and flexible models have been researched. Furthermore the first natural frequencies of the structure have been calculated. The {{results show that the}} frequency of the horizontal condition has the lowest of all and the roof condition has the largest of all. Besides the cylinder forces of the flexible model are larger than the corresponding rigid ones because of the flexible boom vibration. Finally an experiment has been done on a boom test rig which proved that the established simulation model is reasonable and the frequency results are correct. All of these provide design reference to mechanical manipulator as well as reducing product development cost of such mechanism...|$|R
50|$|After being {{anchored}} for a {{few days}} off the coast of A Coruña due to weather hazards, Aegean Sea was ordered into port by port authorities. Due to this, on 3 December 1992, the oil-ore Greek carrier ship Aegean Sea, ran aground off the coast of Galicia at nearly 5 AM. The ship was on its route to A Coruña, Spain, from Sullom Voe, Scotland. Allegedly, a heavy storm managed to push the ship off course and cause her to run aground. A rescue team was sent immediately but failed to keep the ship from breaking in half. This caused the cargo of light crude oil to be spilled which affected sea life. A temporary evacuation of the city of A Coruña was implemented {{in order to protect the}} citizens from the hazards of the oil smoke. Out of the 79,000 tonnes of crude oil that the ship was carrying, 67,000 tonnes managed to be spilled and the remaining was salvaged. The salvaged oil was retained through the use of <b>booms,</b> skimmers, and <b>pumps.</b> Since half of the ship was still above water, the rescue team used pumps to drain the still intact tanks. Soon after, the ship caught on fire and continued to burn for a period of five days. The remaining oil drifted with the strong currents produced by the wind, and as much as 300 km of coast line were affected by the spill. As for the thirty-two-man crew, a rescue helicopter managed to save all of them.|$|R
