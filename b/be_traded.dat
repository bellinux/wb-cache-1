On December 11, Ellis {{was traded to the}} New York Yankees of the American League (AL) along with pitcher Ken Brett and top infield {{prospect}} Willie Randolph, in exchange for pitcher Doc Medich.

5|$|Hartnett hit 24 {{home runs}} in 1925, {{breaking}} the single-season home run record for catchers set by Jack Clements in 1893. He finished second overall in the National League behind the 39 home runs hit by Rogers Hornsby. Although he led National League catchers in errors, he also led in range factor and in putouts, while his strong throwing arm helped him lead the league in assists and caught stealing percentage. Leo Durocher, who played against Hartnett and was a National League manager during Johnny Bench's career, stated that the two catchers had similarly strong throwing arms. During the major league baseball winter meetings in December 1925, it was rumored that Hartnett might <b>be</b> <b>traded</b> to the New York Giants for catcher Frank Snyder and outfielder Irish Meusel; however, Cubs president Bill Veeck, Sr., squelched the rumors saying that Hartnett would not <b>be</b> <b>traded</b> for anybody.|$|E
