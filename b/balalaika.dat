5|$|As {{part of her}} {{preparation}} for entering the studio, Bush toured pubs with the KT Bush Band. However, for her début album, The Kick Inside (1978), she was persuaded to use established session musicians, some of whom she would retain even after she had brought her bandmates back on board. Her brother Paddy played the harmonica and mandolin, unlike on later albums where he would play more exotic instruments such as the <b>balalaika</b> and didgeridoo. Stuart Elliott played some of the drums and would become her main drummer on subsequent albums.|$|E
25|$|The <b>balalaika</b> {{family of}} {{instruments}} includes instruments of various sizes, from the highest-pitched to the lowest: the piccolo <b>balalaika,</b> prima <b>balalaika,</b> secunda <b>balalaika,</b> alto <b>balalaika,</b> bass <b>balalaika,</b> and contrabass <b>balalaika.</b> There are <b>balalaika</b> orchestras which consist solely of different balalaikas; these ensembles typically play Classical music that has been arranged for balalaikas. The prima <b>balalaika</b> is the most common; the piccolo is rare. There have also been descant and tenor balalaikas, but these are considered obsolete. All have three-sided bodies; spruce, evergreen, or fir tops; and backs made of three to nine wooden sections (usually maple). They are typically strung with three strings, and the necks are fretted.|$|E

25|$|Through the 20th century, {{interest}} in Russian folk instruments grew outside of Russia, likely {{as a result}} of western tours by Andreyev and other <b>balalaika</b> virtuosi early in the century.

25|$|With the {{establishment}} of the Soviet system and the entrenchment of a proletarian cultural direction, the culture of the working classes (which included that of village labourers) was actively supported by the Soviet establishment. The concept of the <b>balalaika</b> orchestra was adopted wholeheartedly by the Soviet government as something distinctively proletarian (that is, from the working classes) and was also deemed progressive. Significant amounts of energy and time were devoted to support and foster formal study of the <b>balalaika,</b> from which highly skilled ensemble groups such as the Osipov State Russian Folk Orchestra emerged. <b>Balalaika</b> virtuosi such as Boris Feoktistov and Pavel Necheporenko became stars {{both inside and outside the}} Soviet Union. The movement was so powerful that even the renowned Red Army Choir, which initially used a normal symphonic orchestra, changed its instrumentation, replacing violins, violas, and violoncellos with orchestral balalaikas and domras.|$|E
25|$|Russians have {{distinctive}} {{traditions of}} folk music.

5000|$|AllMusic {{journalist}} Donald A.

25|$|The {{end result}} of Andreyev's labours was the {{establishment}} of an orchestral folk tradition in Tsarist Russia, which later grew into a movement within the Soviet Union. The <b>balalaika</b> orchestra in its full form consists of balalaikas, domras, gusli, bayan, Vladimir Shepherd's Horns, garmoshkas and several types of percussion instruments.|$|E
25|$|The prima <b>balalaika,</b> secunda and alto {{are played}} either with the fingers or a {{plectrum}} (pick), {{depending on the}} music being played, and the bass and contrabass (equipped with extension legs that rest on the floor) are played with leather plectra.

25|$|Early {{representations}} of the <b>balalaika</b> show it with anywhere from two to six strings, which resembles certain Central Asian instruments.
