5|$|The pair's latest book, The <b>Body</b> <b>Shape</b> Bible, was {{published}} on 18 September 2007. Through a survey about different body shapes conducted amongst women, Constantine and Woodall {{were able to}} discover the twelve most common women's body shapes. They used this information to write The <b>Body</b> <b>Shape</b> Bible which highlights these twelve shapes which have all been named in ways such as 'cornet' or 'brick'. In the fashion advice book, women can interpret which shape they are, and can then be given adequate fashion advice on their own individual shape. A few pages in the book are also devoted to illustrating some of Constantine and Woodall's own fashion disasters.|$|E
40|$|International audienceInfant {{responses}} to adult-defined unattractive male <b>body</b> <b>shapes</b> versus attractive male <b>body</b> <b>shapes</b> were assessed using visual preference and habituation procedures. Looking behavior indicated that 9 -month-olds have {{a preference for}} unattractive male <b>body</b> <b>shapes</b> over attractive ones; however, this preference is demonstrated only when head information is obscured. In contrast, 6 - and 3. 5 -month-olds did not show a preference for unattractive or attractive bodies. The 6 -month-olds discriminated between the two categories, whereas the 3. 5 -month-olds did not. Because unattractive <b>body</b> <b>shapes</b> are more common than attractive/athletic <b>body</b> <b>shapes</b> in our everyday environment, a preference for unattractive <b>body</b> <b>shapes</b> at 9 months of age suggests that preferences for particular human <b>body</b> <b>shapes</b> reflect level of exposure and familiarity rather than culturally defined stereotypes of body attractiveness...|$|R

40|$|Estimation of 3 D <b>body</b> <b>shapes</b> from dressed-human photos is an {{important}} but challenging problem in virtual fitting. We propose a novel automatic framework to efficiently estimate 3 D <b>body</b> <b>shapes</b> under clothes. We construct a database of 3 D naked and dressed body pairs, based on which we learn how to predict 3 D positions of body landmarks (which further constrain a parametric human body model) automatically according to dressed-human silhouettes. Critical vertices are selected on 3 D registered human bodies as landmarks to represent <b>body</b> <b>shapes,</b> {{so as to avoid}} the time-consuming vertices correspondences finding process for parametric body reconstruction. Our method can estimate 3 D <b>body</b> <b>shapes</b> from dressed-human silhouettes within 4 seconds, while the fastest method reported previously need 1 minute. In addition, our estimation error is within the size tolerance for clothing industry. We dress 6042 naked bodies with 3 sets of common clothes by physically based cloth simulation technique. To the best of our knowledge, We are the first to construct such a database containing 3 D naked and dressed body pairs and our database may contribute to the areas of human <b>body</b> <b>shapes</b> estimation and cloth simulation...|$|R

5|$|Although Herrerasaurus {{shared the}} <b>body</b> <b>shape</b> {{of the large}} {{carnivorous}} dinosaurs, it lived {{during a time when}} dinosaurs were small and insignificant. It was the time of non-dinosaurian reptiles, not dinosaurs, and a major turning point in the Earth's ecology. The vertebrate fauna of the Ischigualasto Formation and the slightly later Los Colorados Formation consisted mainly of a variety of crurotarsal archosaurs and synapsids. In the Ischigualasto Formation, dinosaurs constituted only about 6% {{of the total number of}} fossils, but by the end of the Triassic Period, dinosaurs were becoming the dominant large land animals, and the other archosaurs and synapsids declined in variety and number.|$|E
5|$|In 1986, J.Scott Turner and C.Richard Tracy {{proposed}} that {{the evolution of a}} sail in Dimetrodon was related to the evolution of warm-bloodedness in mammal ancestors. They thought that the sail of Dimetrodon enabled it to be homeothermic, maintaining a constant, albeit low, body temperature. Mammals are also homeothermic, although they differ from Dimetrodon in being endothermic, controlling their body temperature internally through heightened metabolism. Turner and Tracy noted that early therapsids, a more advanced group of synapsids closely related to mammals, had long limbs which can release heat {{in a manner similar to}} that of the sail of Dimetrodon. The homeothermy that developed in animals like Dimetrodon may have carried over to therapsids through a modification of <b>body</b> <b>shape,</b> which would eventually develop into the warm-bloodedness of mammals.|$|E

Based on this analysis, S.dudleyi {{is part of a}} clade of evolutionarily related taxa that includes the species S.occidentalis, S.emarginata, S.hosoyae, S.korfiana and S.mesocyatha. All of these species contain large oil droplets in their spores, in contrast to the other major clade of Sarcoscypha (containing the type species S.coccinea), characterized by having smaller, more numerous droplets.|$|E

5|$|The {{species of}} Psittacosaurus vary {{in size and}} {{specific}} features of the skull and skeleton, but share the same overall <b>body</b> <b>shape.</b> The best-known—P. mongoliensis—can reach 2metres (6.5ft) in length. The maximum adult body weight was most likely over 20kilogrammes (44lb) in P. mongoliensis. Several species approach P. mongoliensis in size (P. lujiatunensis, P. neimongoliensis, P. xinjiangensis), while others are somewhat smaller (P. sinensis, P. meileyingensis). The smallest known species, P. ordosensis, is 30% smaller than P. mongoliensis. The largest are P. lujiatunensis and P. sibiricus, although neither is significantly larger than P. mongoliensis. Psittacosaurus postcranial skeletons are more typical of a 'generic' bipedal ornithischian. There are only four digits on the manus ('hand'), {{as opposed to the}} five found in most other ornithischians (including all other ceratopsians), while the four-toed hindfoot is very similar to many other small ornithischians.|$|E

5|$|Labradors like to eat, {{and without}} proper {{exercise}} can become obese. Laziness is {{a contribution to}} this. Obesity is a serious condition and can be considered the number one nutritional problem with dogs. A study shows that at least 25% of dogs in the United States are overweight. Therefore, Labradors must be properly exercised and stimulated. A healthy Labrador can do swimming wind sprints for two hours, and should keep a very slight hourglass waist and be fit and light, rather than fat or heavy-set. Obesity can exacerbate conditions such as hip dysplasia and joint problems, {{and can lead to}} secondary diseases, including diabetes. Osteoarthritis is very common in older, especially overweight, Labradors. A 14-year study covering 48 dogs by food manufacturer Purina showed that Labradors fed to maintain a lean <b>body</b> <b>shape</b> outlived those fed freely by around two years, emphasising the importance of not over-feeding. Labradors should be walked twice a day for at least half an hour.|$|E
5|$|Temnospondyls like Sclerocephalus {{are known}} from both large adult {{specimens}} and small larvae, showing an extreme change in <b>body</b> <b>shape.</b> In these species, {{the shape and}} proportions of skull bones change {{in the early stages}} of development. The ornamentation on the surface of the skull roof also develops at this time. Small, regularly spaced pits are the first to form, followed by larger ridges. As development continues, the external gills disappear. Small teeth that once covered the palate are lost. The postcranial skeleton does not develop at the same rate as the skull, with ossification (the replacement of cartilage by bone) happening more slowly. Vertebrae and limb bones are poorly developed, ribs and fingers are absent in the early stages, and the scapulocoracoid and ischium are entirely absent through most of development. Once maturity is reached, most bones have fully formed and growth rate slows. The bones of some temnospondyls like Dutuitosaurus show growth marks, possibly an indication that growth rate varied with the change in seasons. Fossils of temnospondyls like Metoposaurus and Cheliderpeton show that individuals grew larger past maturity. The oldest individuals usually have more pitting on their skulls with deeper sulci.|$|E
5|$|To {{design the}} armour used by Charan {{in his role}} as Kalabhairava, art {{director}} R. Ravinder wanted the precise measurements of Charan's body; they used plaster of Paris to make a mould of Charan's <b>body</b> <b>shape</b> from which they created a statue. They designed costumes for the statue and had Charan try them on once they were satisfied with the designs. In an interview with Radhika Rajamani of Rediff.com, the film's stylist, Rama Rajamouli, said that it took one month to develop the right look for the olden period before she began working on the materials and costumes for the film. She added that all of the film's costumes were designed by her and stitched in Hyderabad, and that Kajal's costumes were heavily detailed as she needed to look rich, elegant and bright. Rajamouli had some disagreements with cinematographer K. K. Senthil Kumar over the colours of the costumes. Her decision of having Kajal wear a dress of baby pink and pista green during the war sequence at Bhairavakona was initially opposed by Rajamouli, but later agreed to after the director saw the final edit. She also used minimal jewellery for the princess's outfits.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} compared <b>body</b> <b>shapes,</b> measurements, {{ratios and}} fit problems of 234 African (109) and Caucasian (125) women.

Thereafter, circumferential and height ratios were computed. Drop values of key circumferential measurements {{were used to}} classify participants’ bodies; these were later visually confirmed and adopted. Results revealed that the triangle, hourglass and rectangle were the three most predominant shapes amongst African and Caucasian women.
