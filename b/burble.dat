25|$|The {{surviving}} water rats {{are left}} on the island to become peaceful creatures and farm the land, and the companions return home to Redwall, where Songbreeze Swifteye is named Abbess and Dannflor Reguba is named Abbey Champion by Cregga Rose Eyes, Redwall's blind badgermum. Dippler is named Log-a-log, and <b>Burble</b> is named Chief of the Watervoles.|$|E
25|$|Song, Dann, Dippler and <b>Burble</b> {{meet some}} new friends {{and set out}} into the great lake to the island. Mokkan finds that Silth has been killed {{by one of his}} sisters, Lantur. He {{promptly}} kills her by pushing her into the lake full of pike, proclaiming himself King. However, the companions arrive and overthrow the water rat army. Mokkan escapes in a boat, but an escaped slave, whom we find out is Nettlebud, throws a chain at him and knocks him into the lake, where he is eaten by pike.|$|E
25|$|Mokkan, {{one of the}} Marlfoxes, escapes {{with the}} tapestry, leaving his {{siblings}} behind. Three young Redwallers, Songbreeze Swifteye, Dannflor Reguba, and a Guosim shrew named Dippler set out after Mokkan, trying to retrieve the tapestry. They meet <b>Burble,</b> a water vole, and have many adventures and meet many friends who help them on their journey, such as the ginormous hedgehog Sollertree,who lost his daughter Nettlebud to the Marlfoxes and water rats, and the Mighty Megraw, a large osprey who used to live by the Marlfox island but was driven away in an ambush by magpies.|$|E

25|$|Known as o Bruxo (the Sorcerer), Pascoal {{often makes}} music with {{unconventional}} {{objects such as}} teapots, children's toys, and animals, as well as keyboards, button accordion, melodica, saxophone, guitar, flute, voice, various brass and folkloric instruments. Perhaps because {{he grew up in}} the countryside, he uses nature as a basis for his compositions, as in his Música da Lagoa, in which the musicians <b>burble</b> water and play flutes while immersed in a lagoon: a Brazilian television broadcast from 1999 showed him soloing at one point by singing into a cup with his mouth partially submerged in water. Folk music from rural Brazil is another important influence in his work.|$|E
500|$|Ripley {{graduated}} from drama school in 1990. Her first role afterwards was playing Osatko {{in the chorus}} of Around the World in 80 Days at the Liverpool Playhouse during the 1990–91 pantomime season. She had ten lines in Japanese. Her next role came {{at the end of}} the year in the Manchester Royal Exchange's production of Medea. Ripley recalled, [...] "It was only my second job, and I took it all very seriously, in my Greek sarong and my torch of fire, having to <b>burble</b> in tongues." ...|$|E

60|$|In {{another minute}} I could realize, though I couldn't see it, that a majestic {{figure in a}} white coat was moving down the line. All was still again except the quiet hum of the {{mechanical}} shampoo brush and the soft <b>burble</b> of running water.|$|E

60|$|I was now, {{beneath my}} dull display of submission, furiously angry with him. It {{occurred}} to me to ask myself why I should defer and qualify my opinions to him. Why should I pretend a feeling of intellectual and social inferiority toward him. He asked what I thought of <b>Burble.</b> I resolved to tell him--if necessary with arrogance. Then perhaps he would release me. I did not sit down again, but stood by the corner of the fireplace.|$|E

6000|$|All {{these forces}} working against me had, thus far, {{prevented}} me from experimenting, {{and perhaps even}} now the towering base-burner would have remained our family shrine had not Mary Isabel put in a wordless plea. Less than four hundred days old, she was, nevertheless wise in fireplaces. She had begun to <b>burble</b> {{in the light of}} the Severances' hearth in Minnesota, and her eyes had reflected the flame and shadow of a noble open fire in Katharine Herne's homestead on Peconic Bay. Her cheeks had reddened like apples in the glory of that hickory flame, and when she came to our small apartment in New York City she had seemed surprised and sadly disappointed by the gas pipes and asbestos mat, which made up a hollow show under a gimcrack mantel. Now here, in her own home, was she to remain without the witchery of crackling flame? ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{excellent}} <b>Burble</b> {{was a great}} {{shock to}} me. It seemed clear from his answers to the sceptic that the case for doctrinal orthodoxy and all that faded and by no means awful hereafter, which I had hitherto accepted as I accepted the sun, was an extremely poor one, and to hammer home that idea the first book I got from the Institute happened to be an American edition of the collected works of Shelley, his gassy prose {{as well as his}} atmospheric verse. I was soon ripe for blatant unbelief. And at the Young Men's Christian Association I presently made the acquaintance of Parload, who told me, under promises of the most sinister secrecy, that he was [...] "a Socialist out and out." [...] He lent me several copies of a periodical with the clamant title of The Clarion, which was just taking up a crusade against the accepted religion. The adolescent years of any fairly intelligent youth lie open, and will always lie healthily open, to the contagion of philosophical doubts, of scorns and new ideas, and I will confess I had the fever of that phase badly. Doubt, I say, but it was not so much doubt--which is a complex thing--as startled emphatic denial. [...] "Have I believed THIS!" [...] And I was also, you must remember, just beginning love-letters to Nettie.|$|E

50|$|The ballute (a {{portmanteau}} of balloon and parachute) is a parachute-like {{braking device}} optimized for use at high altitudes and supersonic velocities. Invented by Goodyear in 1958, the original ballute was a cone-shaped balloon with a toroidal <b>burble</b> fence fitted around its widest point. A <b>burble</b> fence is an inflated structure intended to ensure flow separation. This stabilizes the ballute as it decelerates through different flow regimes (from supersonic to subsonic).|$|E

About 20 meters before reaching the round about, a path heads off to the right, leading through enormous tree roots to a lookout, reached by a stone high above a <b>burbling</b> stream. Further up is another lookout. Then is found an artificial waterfall contrived by placing a stone slab between two rocks.|$|R
