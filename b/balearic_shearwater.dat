40|$|Land-based {{counts of}} {{migrating}} seabirds remain essential to increase knowledge about their numbers and movements. To assess {{the value of}} Cabo Carvoeiro (Peniche, Portugal) as a monitoring site in the East Atlantic, we studied seabird species composition, passage patterns and flock size during mid-October 2014. During standardized counts, we observed nearly 8 000 seabirds of 17 species. The ratio of individuals passing in a southerly to southwesterly direction was > 96 % in all species, showing that genuine migrants were counted. The passage rate (birds/hour) was higher for Northern Gannets Morus bassanus than for any other species, {{by a factor of}} approximately 50 (morning mean 906 /h, afternoon mean 1 153 /h). The globally endangered <b>Balearic</b> <b>Shearwaters</b> Puffinus mauretanicus, Great Skuas Stercorarius skua and Pomarine Skuas S. pomarinus had passage rates of 10 – 25 /h. Flock size distribution in the 11 most numerous species showed that most migrated singly or in groups of two. Flock size was larger in <b>Balearic</b> <b>Shearwaters</b> than in both Cory’s Calonectris borealis and Manx Shearwaters P. puffinus. Among skuas, flock size was larger in Pomarine than in Great Skuas. The passage rate of Manx Shearwaters was positively correlated with that of Northern Gannets, Great Skuas and Sandwich Terns Sterna sandvicensis. Northern Gannets showed a positive co-variation with Pomarine Skuas. <b>Balearic</b> and Sooty <b>Shearwaters</b> Ardenna griseus were the only species that did not show any significant co-variation with another species. Morning and afternoon passage rates did not differ significantly in any of the six most numerous species (Northern Gannets, Cory’s and <b>Balearic</b> <b>Shearwaters,</b> Great and Pomarine Skuas, and Sandwich Terns), or in Sooty Shearwaters (less numerous). Thus, the passage rates at Cabo Carvoeiro in October of <b>Balearic</b> <b>Shearwaters</b> and five other species were as high or higher than those reported from any other seawatch in Portugal, indicating the international value of seabird monitoring at Cabo Carvoeiro during the autumn migration...|$|R
50|$|Also, {{at least}} one mixed {{breeding}} colony of the yelkouan and the <b>Balearic</b> <b>shearwaters</b> exists on Minorca.

50|$|The {{yelkouan shearwater}} appears {{to belong to}} a group of Mediterranean and {{adjacent}} Atlantic shearwaters which includes the <b>Balearic</b> <b>shearwater</b> and one to three prehistorically extinct taxa, Hole's and possibly also lava shearwater as well as an undescribed population of uncertain distinctness from Menorca.

40|$|International audienceKnowledge {{about the}} spatial {{distribution}} of seabirds at sea is important for conservation. During marine conservation planning, logistical constraints preclude seabird surveys covering the complete area of interest and {{spatial distribution of}} seabirds is frequently inferred from predictive statistical models. Increasingly complex models are available to relate the distribution and abundance of pelagic seabirds to environmental variables, but a comparison of their usefulness for delineating protected areas for seabirds is lacking. Here we compare the performance of five modelling techniques (generalised linear models, generalised additive models, Random Forest, boosted regression trees, and maximum entropy) to predict the distribution of <b>Balearic</b> <b>Shearwaters</b> (Puffinus mauretanicus) {{along the coast of}} the western Iberian Peninsula. We used ship transect data from 2004 to 2009 and 13 environmental variables to predict occurrence and density, and evaluated predictive performance of all models using spatially segregated test data. Predicted distribution varied among the different models, although predictive performance varied little. An ensemble prediction that combined results from all five techniques was robust and confirmed the existence of marine important bird areas for <b>Balearic</b> <b>Shearwaters</b> in Portugal and Spain. Our predictions suggested additional areas that would be of high priority for conservation and could be proposed as protected areas. Abundance data were extremely difficult to predict, and none of five modelling techniques provided a reliable prediction of spatial patterns. We advocate the use of ensemble modelling that combines the output of several methods to predict the spatial distribution of seabirds, and use these predictions to target separate surveys assessing the abundance of seabirds in areas of regular use...|$|R
40|$|Surveys {{carried out}} in the 1980 s showed that 8, 000 - 10, 000 <b>Balearic</b> <b>shearwaters</b> {{regularly}} gathered in inshore waters of central and northern Biscay, particularly off the coast of Vendée and in the Mor-Braz area, western France. This distribution, apparently linked to particular oceanographical conditions (thermal front), was strikingly overlapping with that of clupeid fish, particularly anchovies. Recent surveys (1999 - 2000) have shown that the species has become far less numerous in these "traditional" haunts. Conversely, its abundance has increased in the western Channel, some hundreds of kilometres to the North, during the 1990 s. Reasons for this northward shift (e. g. changes in prey distribution due to fishing activities or water warming in Biscay) remain hypothetical and further study is needed...|$|R
40|$|Aim: Intraspecific {{variability}} in the migratory movements of seabirds is being revealed far more complex than hitherto recognized, and our lack of understanding undermines their effective protection. Our aim is to test whether the isotopic values of a single feather of two threatened seabirds, the Mediterranean (Puffinus yelkouan) and the <b>Balearic</b> (Puffinus mauretanicus) <b>shearwaters</b> allow the geographic assignment of birds to their non-breeding areas. Location: These two species are known to use three main non-breeding areas: the NE Atlantic Ocean, the W Mediterranean and the Aegean-Black seas. Methods: We clustered in three groups the δ 13 C and δ 15 N values of the first primary feather (P 1), inferred to be grown during the non-breeding period, of 34 Mediterranean and 56 <b>Balearic</b> <b>shearwaters</b> accidentally caught by longliners. To link the isotopic values of P 1 to its corresponding non-breeding area, we performed a discriminant function analysis (DFA) based on the three clusters and applied this function to feathers of known origin: P 1 from seven Mediterranean shearwaters from Hyères Archipelago (France) tracked with geolocators and body feathers from six chicks from <b>Balearic</b> <b>shearwaters.</b> To link the moulting patterns to the areas where the feathers were grown, we applied the DFA to a sequence of primary feathers of eight Balearic and five Mediterranean shearwaters (caught by longliners). Results: Isotopic and tracking data indicate {{that none of the}} Mediterranean shearwaters migrated to the Atlantic. The cluster and discriminant function analyses revealed that 8 % of Balearic and 54 % of Mediterranean shearwater moulted P 1 in the Mediterranean Sea. Migratory movements were reflected in the changing isotopic values of the primary sequences. Main conclusions: Stable isotope analyses (SIA) are a powerful approach to reveal the intraspecific {{variability in}} the migratory patterns of seabirds that use distinct isotopic areas over their annual cycle. The assignment of birds to their non-breeding areas by means of SIA is a simple and effective tool that can help to evaluate the impact of human activities in remote areas not only at population but also at individual level, which is an essential knowledge for the management and conservation of threatened species.

40|$|International audienceMarine {{protected}} areas (MPAs) are {{considered one of}} the main tools in both fisheries and conservation management to protect threatened species and their habitats around the globe. However, MPAs are underrepresented in marine environments compared to terrestrial environments. Within this context, we studied the Atlantic non-breeding distribution of the southern population of <b>Balearic</b> <b>shearwaters</b> (Puffinus mauretanicus) breeding in Ibiza during the 2011 - 2012 period based on global location sensing (GLS) devices. Our objectives were (1) to identify overall Important Atlantic Areas (IAAs) from a southern population, (2) to describe spatio-temporal patterns of oceanographic habitat use, and (3) to assess whether existing conservation areas (Natura 2000 sites and marine Important Bird Areas (IBAs)) cover the main IAAs of <b>Balearic</b> <b>shearwaters.</b> Our results highlighted that the Atlantic staging (from June to October in 2011) dynamic of the southern population was driven by individual segregation at both spatial and temporal scales. Individuals ranged in the North-East Atlantic over four main IAAs (Bay of Biscay: BoB, Western Iberian shelf: WIS, Gulf of Cadiz: GoC, West of Morocco: WoM). While most individuals spent more time on the WIS or in the GoC, a small number of birds visited IAAs at the extremes of their Atlantic distribution range (i. e., BoB and WoM). The chronology of the arrivals to the IAAs showed a latitudinal gradient with northern areas reached earlier during the Atlantic staging. The IAAs coincided with the most productive areas (higher chlorophyll a values) in the NE Atlantic between July and October. The spatial overlap between IAAs and conservation areas was higher for Natura 2000 sites than marine IBAs (areas with and without legal protection, respectively). Concerning the use of these areas, a slightly higher proportion of estimated positions fell within marine IBAs compared to designated Natura 2000 sites, with Spanish and Portuguese conservation areas being the most visited. Our results support the current design of conservation areas in Spain and Portugal regarding the protection of adult breeders of this highly mobile species...|$|R
40|$|Local trawler {{fisheries}} operate {{around the}} seabird colonies of the Ebro Delta and Majorca. The use {{made of the}} discards produced by this fishery by scavenging breeding seabirds was examined from 1992 to 1996. All breeding species at each site (except little terns at the Ebro Delta) were observed following trawlers while fishermen were discarding fish: Audouin’s, yellow-legged, lesser black-backed, black-headed and slender-billed gulls, common and Sandwich terns in the Ebro Delta area; and Audouin’s and yellow-legged gulls, Cory’s and <b>Balearic</b> <b>shearwaters,</b> storm-petrel and common shags in the Majorca area. Some non-breeding seabird species, such as gannets, skuas, and Chlydonias spp. terns were also recorded in small numbers. Nevertheless, species diversity of the seabird community associated with trawlers was significantly higher at the Ebro than at Majorca, because Procellariiformes, which breed only in the latter area, were displaced by large numbers of gulls.

40|$|International audienceContrasting to {{the overall}} {{oligotrophic}} Mediterranean Sea, the north-western basin is characterised by high productivity and marked by seasonality, which induces spatiotemporal heterogeneity of habitat. Cetaceans and seabirds are expected to perceive this repetition of the seasonal cycle and to anticipate the recurrent variability of their environment. Because phenology imposes strong constraints over marine predators, especially through reproduction, we expected them to exhibit variations in their habitat preferences over seasons. Indeed, during reproductive period, marine predators have to face their own needs and those of their young, while out of this period, they can focus on maximising their own survival only. We therefore hypothesised that some species would change their habitat preferences to exploit the most favourable habitat during each season, while other species might accommodate the same habitat all year-round, for example thanks {{to the use of}} an habitat favourable all the year. To explore these hypotheses, we used aerial surveys data conducted over north-western Mediterranean Sea during winter 2011 – 2012 and summer 2012. Generalised Additive Models were used to link the species density to a set of 12 physiographic and oceanographic predictors describing their environment. Habitat models resulted in deviances from 12 to 47 %. Our results provided the first assessment of habitat preferences for the winter season for most of our studied species. Small-sized delphinids (mostly stripped dolphins), fin whales, Globicephalinae (long-finned pilot whales and Risso׳s dolphins) and small-sized <b>shearwaters</b> (Yelkouan and <b>Balearic</b> <b>shearwaters)</b> exhibited no habitat variations between seasons, although for the first two, abundances were lower in winter. On the contrary, bottlenose dolphins switched from coastal habitat in summer to pelagic habitat in winter, while Cory׳s shearwaters and storm petrels exhibited the largest habitat variations between seasons with a complete absence during winter...|$|R
40|$|International audienceDietary {{studies of}} seabirds provide {{information}} on food webs and oceanographic variability. Studying fatty acid signatures (FAS), which reflect changes {{in the composition of}} the diet, has several advantages over traditional methods. In the context of the Mediterranean marine ecosystem, we studied tissue FAS in captive-fed and wild seabirds. Yellow-legged gulls Larus michahellis were experimentally fed either pelagic (sardine Sardina pilchardus) or demersal (spotted flounder Citharus linguatula) fish for 8 wk, and FAS in the birds' plasma and adipose tissue were studied. The FAS developed patterns characteristic of the sardine or flounder diet, showing the reliability of both types of samples. In addition, plasma samples of 20 endangered wild <b>Balearic</b> <b>shearwaters</b> Puffinus mauretanicus and their most likely prey items from the Mediterranean Sea were collected and analyzed for FAS. Based on FAS of Mediterranean fish, and the results from the feeding experiment, the diet of the endangered wild shearwaters was estimated. In terms of the composition of polyunsaturated fatty acids, the plasma FAS of the shearwaters resembled those of the captive gulls kept on a sardine diet, suggesting that pelagic feeding resources dominate shearwater diet. However, the high level of 20 : 1 n- 11, likely metabolized from 22 : 1 n- 11 by the birds themselves, suggested that the diet also contained a demersal component rich in 22 : 1 n- 11. Contrary to the situation in the open oceans, the levels of the C 20 and C 22 monounsaturated fatty acids are low in the Mediterranean food web and characteristic of most demersal species. Our results support the findings of previous field studies that the diet of the shearwaters is frequently supplemented by demersal fish from fishery discards...|$|R

Yellow-legged gull made the largest use of discards, albeit lower than expected by its Presence Index. Average percentage consumption was about 54 % of the edible discards, suggesting that yellow-legged gulls were not highly efficient at catching >discard>.
