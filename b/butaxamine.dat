50|$|A Beta-2 {{adrenergic}} antagonist (β2-adrenoceptor antagonist) is an adrenergic antagonist which {{blocks the}} beta-2 adrenergic receptors of cells, with either high specificity (an antagonist which is selective for β2 adrenoceptors) like <b>Butaxamine</b> and ICI-118,551, or non-specifically (an antagonist for β2 and for β1 or β3 adrenoceptors) like the non-selective betablocker Propranolol.|$|E
50|$|<b>Butaxamine</b> (INN, {{also known}} as butoxamine) is a β2-selective beta blocker. Its primary use is in {{experimental}} situations in which blockade of β2 receptors is necessary to determine {{the activity of the}} drug (i.e. if the β2 receptor is completely blocked, but the given effect is still present, the given effect is not a characteristic of the β2 receptor). It has no clinical use. An alternative name is α-(1-tert-butylaminoethyl)-2,5-dimethoxybenzyl alcohol.|$|E
