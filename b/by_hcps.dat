30|$|This study {{achieved}} {{its main}} objective of evolving {{an understanding of}} how HCPs perceive ethics and ethical challenges, and the impact that these issues have on them. Understanding moral distress as related <b>by</b> <b>HCPs</b> is the first step to understanding how the negative reactions can be alleviated. Being able to identify the ethical challenges experienced <b>by</b> <b>HCPs</b> and the impact they feel from them will assist organizations to plan suitable frameworks for training and guidance in ethical challenges. This will offer improved support for their HCPs and in turn improve public healthcare provision in the time of HCs. However, first humanitarian aid organizations must recognize the role they play in creating issues surrounding ethical decision making, in order to ever be able to fully support their workers. To build on this study, the next step would be to discuss these issues with a larger cohort of participants in order to gain an understanding of a wider range of experiences and perceptions in these topics.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Electronic {{documentation}} handling {{may facilitate}} information flows {{in health care}} settings to support better coordination of care among Health Care Providers (HCPs), but evidence is limited. Methods that accurately depict changes to the workflows of HCPs are needed to assess whether {{the introduction of a}} Critical Care clinical Information System (CCIS) to two Intensive Care Units (ICUs) represents a positive step for patient care. To evaluate a previously described method of quantifying amounts of time spent and interruptions encountered <b>by</b> <b>HCPs</b> working in two ICUs. Methods Observers used PDAs running the Work Observation Method By Activity Timing (WOMBAT) software to record the tasks performed <b>by</b> <b>HCPs</b> in advance of the introduction of a Critical Care clinical Information System (CCIS) to quantify amounts of time spent on tasks and interruptions encountered <b>by</b> <b>HCPs</b> in ICUs. Results We report the percentages of time spent on each task category, and the rates of interruptions observed for physicians, nurses, respiratory therapists, and unit clerks. Compared with previously published data from Australian hospital wards, interdisciplinary information sharing and communication in ICUs explain higher proportions of time spent on professional communication and documentation by nurses and physicians, as well as more frequent interruptions which are often followed by professional communication tasks. Conclusions Critical care workloads include requirements for timely information sharing and communication and explain the differences we observed between the two datasets. The data presented here further validate the WOMBAT method, and support plans to compare workflows before and after the introduction of electronic documentation methods in ICUs. </p...|$|E

30|$|Previous {{research}} {{focused on}} understanding {{the nature of}} ethical dilemmas and the moral reasoning employed <b>by</b> <b>HCPs</b> (e.g., Schwartz et al. 2010). The current study identified similar findings, specifically challenges between oneself and the organization, oneself and the cultural context in the HC, and internally within oneself. All of these experiences shared a core of personal conflict. The struggle {{was a result of}} the individual’s conception of their ethics interacting with the complex institutional, cultural, and personal environments in HCs. Studies have shown that HCPs who have encountered ethical dilemmas experienced symptoms of anxiety, distress, uncertainty, and remorse (Hunt et al. 2011; Nilsson et al. 2011). The findings in this study are strikingly similar. Participants elaborated on a variety of emotional suffering. They recounted a range of feelings including helplessness, outrage, abandonment, and despair.|$|E

40|$|Information {{privacy is}} a crucial aspect of eHealth. Appropriate privacy {{management}} measures are therefore essential for its success. However, traditional measures for privacy preservation such as rigid access controls (i. e., preventive measures) are not suitable to eHealth because of the specialised and information - intensive nature of healthcare itself, {{and the nature of}} the information. Healthcare professionals (HCP) require easy, unrestricted access to as much information as possible towards making well - informed decisions. On the other end of the scale however, consumers (i. e., patients) demand control over their health information and raise concerns for privacy arising from internal activities (i. e., information use <b>by</b> <b>HCPs).</b> A proper balance of these competing concerns is vital for the implementation of successful eHealth systems. Towards reaching this balance, we propose an information accountability framework (IAF) for eHealth systems...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. Nurs.), College of Nursing, Washington State UniversityPreventative {{health care}} {{is not a new}} concept and since the {{development}} of vaccines against communicable diseases, Health Care Providers (HCPs) have willingly received immunizations and lead the way in educating patients about the importance of prophylactic inoculation. Vaccines have improved public safety, lowered patient morbidity and mortality and reduced the financial burden on health care systems. HCPs recognize the importance of this health promotion modality, however, the 2009 flu season found many HCPs unwilling to receive the A (H 1 N 1) vaccine. The right of institutions to mandate seasonal influenza vaccine and the right of HCPs to refuse these immunizations created a quandary. This paper provides an historical account of the 2009 A (H 1 N 1) influenza season and the phenomenon surrounding the declination of the flu vaccine <b>by</b> <b>HCPs...</b>|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{explore the}} {{perceptions}} of multidisciplinary health care professionals (HCPs) and patients of the pharmaceutical care issues (PCIs) relating to rheumatoid arthritis (RA.). Design: Qualitative study using semistructured one to one interviews and focus groups to explore patient perceptions. Interviews and focus groups were taped and transcribed verbatim, then described and coded for meaning to produce 'invivo' codes, which were then grouped to form themes. Nominal group methodology was used to generate and rank a list of HCP perceptions of the key PCIs of RA patients. The PCIs were ranked according to clinical importance and order of occurrence from admission as perceived by the HCP group. Setting: Rheumatology ward and outpatient clinic in a teaching hospital. Main Outcome Measures: Generation and ranking of PCIs, generation of themes from patient interviews. Results: Optimisation of pain control was identified by the nominal group as being the primary aim for patients on admission and was also the most commonly described symptom by patients. Two PCIs not predicted by the HCPs' nominal group was the frequency of infections and the associated discharge and patients described experiencing 'overeducation' <b>by</b> <b>HCPs,</b> {{which could lead to}} anxiety. Complementary medicine in conjunction with traditional therapy was raised as a significant health benefit by patients. Conclusion: Many patients' views mirrored the PCIs identified <b>by</b> <b>HCPs,</b> but some were not anticipated; the value of patient interviews to ensure appropriate service development was demonstrated. Several PCIs emerged for future incorporation by the multidisciplinary team into standardised models of pharmaceutical care for use in secondary care and at the secondary/primary care interface for improvement of seamless care. There is a need to target educational interventions and to identify those who will benefit from advice on complementary medicine. Further work is required to develop a tool to identify the educational needs of RA patients and targeting of the information provided. This will help ensure the delivery of pharmaceutical care is designed to match the needs of individual patients...|$|E
30|$|Using {{secondary}} {{data from}} the official website of the Health Canada database in Phase II to compare serious ADRs reported <b>by</b> <b>HCPs</b> versus patients is considered cost-effective and time-efficient. Since the database contains {{a large number of}} ADR reports; sample size is not a problem. But because there is no limitation on the ATCs in the database, this would result in a broader scope of information that will be obtained and more manual work will be needed. One of the study limitation {{that needs to be addressed}} is the fact that one reporter can report more than one ADR per report, thus resulting in ADRs not being truly independent. It is important to note that when analysing data obtained from the Canada Vigilance Database, causality of a reaction by any given suspect drug cannot be assumed. In addition, comparisons between drugs cannot be made from the available data (Health Canada 2011).|$|E
30|$|The Canada Vigilance {{database}} {{contains all}} spontaneous ADR reports in Canada that were reported directly <b>by</b> <b>HCPs,</b> patients, and pharmaceutical companies.

Reports are categorized in the database by the degree of seriousness according to the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences criteria (Health Canada 2007). Health Canada Vigilance handles the ADR reports from the patients the same way it handles reports from other sources. The Canadian Vigilance database defines the following four categories of persons submitting reports to the database as: (1) community including patients, patients’ relatives, other members of the public; (2) hospital including HCPs such as physicians, pharmacists, and nurses; (3) MAHs including pharmaceutical companies; and (4) others including insurance companies.|$|E
