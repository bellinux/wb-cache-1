5|$|The genus {{name was}} changed to Glyptemys in 2001. The bog turtle and the wood turtle, Glyptemys insculpta, had until then been {{included}} in the genus Clemmys, which also included spotted turtles (C.guttata) and western pond turtles (C.marmorata). Nucleotide sequencing and ribosomal DNA analyses suggested that bog turtles and wood turtles are closely related, <b>but</b> <b>neither</b> <b>is</b> directly related to spotted turtles, hence the separation of the genus Glyptemys.|$|E
5|$|The {{seafood and}} poultry {{industries}} thrived {{through much of}} the 20th century, <b>but</b> <b>neither</b> <b>is</b> important to the island's economy today. Chincoteague is a major tourist destination on Virginia's Eastern Shore, with many coming to enjoy the beaches on Assateague Island. The success of Marguerite Henry's 1947 children's book Misty of Chincoteague and its sequels helped publicize Chincoteague, as did the 1961 film, Misty.|$|E
5|$|One {{attempt to}} {{overcome}} the above problems with transient phenomena reports was made during the Clementine mission by a network of amateur astronomers. Several events were reported, of which four of these were photographed both beforehand and afterward by the spacecraft. However, careful analysis of these images shows no discernible differences at these sites. This does not necessarily imply that these reports were a result of observational error, as {{it is possible that}} outgassing events on the lunar surface might not leave a visible marker, <b>but</b> <b>neither</b> <b>is</b> it encouraging for the hypothesis that these were authentic lunar phenomena.|$|E

5|$|Two fossils {{have been}} {{interpreted}} as isolated lower premolars of Ferugliotherium, <b>but</b> <b>neither</b> <b>is</b> still regarded as such. Two other teeth {{have been identified}} as upper premolars of Ferugliotherium; as with the jaw fragment, they may also represent an indeterminate multituberculate. One of the two preserves two longitudinal rows of cusps, of which one contains four and the other at least two cusps. The other is more poorly preserved, but may represent the same tooth position. These teeth resemble multituberculate upper premolars.|$|E
5|$|Koalas {{have few}} predators; dingos and large pythons may prey on them, while {{birds of prey}} (such as {{powerful}} owls and wedge-tailed eagles) are threats to young. They are generally not subject to external parasites, other than ticks in coastal areas. Koalas may also suffer mange from the mite Sarcoptes scabiei, and skin ulcers from the bacterium Mycobacterium ulcerans, <b>but</b> <b>neither</b> <b>is</b> common. Internal parasites are few and largely harmless. These include the tapeworm Bertiella obesa, commonly found in the intestine, and the nematodes Marsupostrongylus longilarvatus and Durikainema phascolarcti, which are infrequently found in the lungs. In a three-year study of almost 600 koalas admitted to the Australian Zoo Wildlife Hospital in Queensland, 73.8% of the animals were infected {{with at least one}} species of the parasitic protozoal genus Trypanosoma, the most common of which was T.irwini.|$|E

25|$|Nadolol {{is one of}} the {{preferred}} beta-blockers in the management of patients with LQTS for shortening of the QT interval and prevention of ventricular arrhythmia. It is more efficacious than metoprolol in the prevention of breakthrough cardiac events while on therapy and is equivalent to propranolol. Nadolol has the advantage of once daily dosing and thus improved patient compliance. For patients with decreased kidney function, nadolol may be dosed less often. It has also been found to be useful (off-label) for several neurological disorders such as the prevention of migraine attacks, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder(ADHD) and its use has been explored as a treatment for essential tremor and Parkinson's disease <b>but</b> <b>neither</b> <b>is</b> well established.|$|E
500|$|Wanting to do {{more than}} just {{represent}} life and death as an opposition, and instead to show the way in which each is inevitably and profoundly involved with the other, Kiarostami has devised a cinema that does more than just present the viewer with the documentable [...] "facts," [...] <b>but</b> <b>neither</b> <b>is</b> it simply a matter of artifice. Because [...] "existence" [...] means more than simply life, it is projective, containing an irreducibly fictive element, but in this [...] "being more than" [...] life, it is therefore contaminated by mortality. Nancy is giving an interpretation of Kiarostami's statement that lying is the only way to truth.|$|E

500|$|The skyline of {{the center}} panel (220 × 195cm, 87 × 77in) matches exactly {{with that of the}} left wing, while the {{positioning}} of its central pool and the lake behind it echoes the lake [...] in the earlier scene. The center image depicts the expansive [...] "garden" [...] landscape which gives the triptych its name. The panel shares a common horizon with the left wing, suggesting a spatial connection between the two scenes. The garden is teeming with male and female nudes, together with a variety of animals, plants and fruit. The setting is not the paradise shown in the left panel, <b>but</b> <b>neither</b> <b>is</b> it based in the terrestrial realm. Fantastic creatures mingle with the real; otherwise ordinary fruits appear engorged to a gigantic size. The figures are engaged in diverse amorous sports and activities, both in couples and in groups. Gibson describes them as behaving [...] "overtly and without shame", while art historian Laurinda Dixon writes that the human figures exhibit [...] "a certain adolescent sexual curiosity".|$|E
500|$|Todd McCarthy of Variety {{wrote that}} Valkyrie [...] "has visual splendor galore, {{but is a}} cold work lacking in the {{requisite}} tension and suspense". McCarthy considered Cruise as [...] "a bit stiff but still adequate" [...] as von Stauffenberg. The critic believed that McQuarrie's script was well-carpentered but felt that compressing and streamlining the events to make a known failed plot more thrilling lacked a [...] "sufficient sizzle into the dialogue or individuality into the characters". McCarthy missed [...] "many of the interesting personal and political nuances pertaining to these men" [...] that were not detailed. He thought that the production design by Lilly Kilvert and Patrick Lumb stood out, that Newton Thomas Sigel's cinematography had a [...] "restrained elegance", and that John Ottman performed well in his dual role as editor and composer. A similar sentiment was stated by Mike LaSalle in the San Francisco Chronicle, who wrote [...] "There's nothing inherently laughable about the spectacle of Tom Cruise with an eye patch and a missing hand, strutting around in a German colonel's uniform. <b>But</b> <b>neither</b> <b>is</b> there anything about him that truly suggests Claus von Stauffenberg, leader of the 1944 conspiracy to decapitate the Nazi government and stage a coup d'etat. Think of Valkyrie as a reasonably entertaining drama about the time Tom Cruise tried to kill Hitler. Do that, and it becomes possible to enjoy the movie.|$|E
500|$|Reactions against Davis {{also came}} from the White House, from Kentucky Governor Steve Beshear, and from {{candidates}} {{in the race for}} the 2016 presidential election. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said, [...] "No public official is above the rule of law. Certainly not the president of the United States, <b>but</b> <b>neither</b> <b>is</b> the Rowan County clerk." [...] Governor Beshear said the judge's decision [...] "speaks for itself", while his attorneys called the legal arguments in her suit against him [...] "absurd". Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said, [...] "Officials should be held to their duty to uphold the law– end of story." [...] Several Republican presidential candidates also called on Davis to comply with court orders. Donald Trump said, [...] "the decision's been made, and that is the law of the land." [...] Jeb Bush, former governor of Florida, said Davis [...] "is sworn to uphold the law", but also suggested that some sort of accommodation be made for her. Republican presidential candidates Carly Fiorina and Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina both suggested that Davis should comply with the court order or resign. Members of the Westboro Baptist Church protested against Davis for her multiple divorces and marriages, saying she is living in adultery. Westboro also stated [...] "God hates oath breakers", therefore Davis is obligated to follow the nation's law.|$|E

2500|$|In {{open loop}} control, the control {{action from the}} {{controller}} is independent of the [...] "process output" [...] (or [...] "controlled process variable" [...] - PV).

The control action is the timed switching on/off of the boiler, the process variable is the building temperature, <b>but</b> <b>neither</b> <b>is</b> linked.|$|E
