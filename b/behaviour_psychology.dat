5000|$|Employee voice {{refers to}} the {{participation}} of employees in influencing organisational decision making. Because research and analysis have grown around the voice concept {{in a variety of}} disciplines, ‘employee voice’ has become an elastic term meaning somewhat different things to different policy, academic and practitioner actors [...] In the many disciplines that cover voice, such as human resource management, political science, economics, organisational <b>behaviour,</b> <b>psychology</b> or law, perspectives toward the concept differ. Drawing on Dundon et al. voice can be seen with different lenses. First, voice is an articulation of individual dissatisfaction or concern that aims to address a specific problem or issue with management. Second, voice takes the form of collective organisation, where voice provides a countervailing source of power to management. Third, there is the role of voice as a contribution to management decision-making. Here the purpose is to gain employee input to improve work organisation and efficiency more generally, perhaps through quality circles or teamwork, or eliciting workforce engagement. Fourth voice can be seen as an instrument for mutual gain, with productive collaboration between capital and labour increasing the long-term viability of an organisation and economic well-being of employees The editors of the Elgar Handbook of Employee Voice [...] define employee voice as the ways and means through which employees attempt to have a say and potentially influence organisational affairs about issues that affect their work and the interests of managers and owners. This definition combines a variety of voice mechanisms that analysts often group in separate boxes (e.g. involvement or bargaining; union and non-union). It allows for employer implemented Non-union Employee Representative (NER) systems as a collective form of voice, be it chosen to marginalise a union presence or to provide an alternative to union influence In general, employee voice is about how employees are able to have a say over work activities and decisions within the organizations in which they work, regardless of the institutional channel through which it operates—whether through speak-up programmes, quality circles, teamwork, or collective negotiation.|$|E

As {{the scientific study of}} human thought and <b>behaviour,</b> <b>psychology</b> has much to offer in better understanding these issues, as well as fostering greater sustainability in human actions. Yet, despite this recognition, and increasing calls from leaders in psychology education to produce graduates capable of applying their disciplinary knowledge to such real-world issues to solve worldwide behaviourally-based problems; this may not be adequately addressed in current psychology training. The present study assessed the content of all APAC (Australian Psychology Accreditation Council) approved psychology programs within Australia to determine the proportion which offered a psychology-focused course (unit) specifically in conservation or sustainability. Based on the data advertised through each university website, it appears that only one of 39 programs currently offers such a course, with one other university implementing a conservation psychology course in 2013. Thus 95 % of current APAC-accredited programs in Australia do not have a strong focus on training psychology graduates to contribute to addressing these important issues.

40|$|Not refereed. Abstract only. The US auto {{industry}} has been in-and-out of crisis {{for a number of}} decades; the question is why? To begin answering this question, the present paper will undertake a case history dating from 1893 (the date of the first one-cylinder car) to the present day, focusing on the ‘boom’ of the early 1900 s and the industry’s recent history. In doing so, this paper will look at how theories in organisational <b>behaviour,</b> <b>psychology</b> and the decision sciences, as well as experimental economics, can benefit from such an historical study. And in a reciprocal nature how those fields of study inform our understanding of why the organisations within the industry behaved {{in the manner in which}} they did. More specifically, the paper will focus on the exploration-exploitation paradigm identified across the aforementioned literature, and will show how psychological factors led car companies to make suboptimal decisions, exploiting known alternatives rather than searching for new opportunities. Therefore the purpose of this paper is threefold. First, it seeks to undertake brief historical research into the US {{auto industry}}. Second, it seeks to show how such research will inform a wide-range of literature.

The {{method of data collection}} is library research. The theory used for analizing data are structural theory and <b>behaviour</b> <b>psychology</b> theory by B. F. Skinner. This thesis discusses intrinsic elements of drama My Boss My Hero, especially character and their personalities, plot, and setting, then the influence from environment that caused the changing of main character's psychology, also main character's inner conflicts. The results of this research are the main character of this drama is Sakaki Makio. The additional characters are Sakurakouji Jun, Umemura Hikari, Sakaki Kiichi, and Sakaki Mikio. This drama uses progressive plot. Hongkong, Makio's house, Sakurakouji's house, school, and park are location setting of this drama. The time setting are winter, summer, spring, autumn, and modern era. The condition setting are touching, sad, and happy. As the social setting, it has found that Makio is from a very wealthy family. Main character's inner conflict is triggered by the influence of his environment, which is antecendent, reinforcement, and punishment. Consequences that Makio recieves from his attitudes around strengthen his inner conflict. Makio's inner conflict happened when he wanted to protect the girl he likes and also when he lied to his teachers and friends.

40|$|What are {{moral values}} {{and where do}} they come from? David Hume argued that moral values were {{the product of a}} range of passions, {{inherent}} to human nature, that aim at the common good of society. Recent developments in game theory, evolutionary biology, animal <b>behaviour,</b> <b>psychology</b> and neuroscience suggest that Hume was right to suppose that humans have such passions. This dissertation reviews these developments, and considers their implications for moral philosophy. I first explain what Darwinian adaptations are, and how they generate behaviour. I then explain that, contrary to the Hobbesian caricature of life in the state of nature, evolutionary theory leads us to expect that organisms will be social, cooperative and even altruistic under certain circumstances. I introduce four main types of cooperation – kin altruism, coordination to mutual advantage, reciprocity and conflict resolution – and provide examples of ‘adaptations for cooperation ’ from nonhuman species. I then review the evidence for equivalent adaptations for cooperation in humans. Next, I show how this Humean-Darwinian account of the moral sentiments {{can be used to make}} sense of traditional positions in meta-ethics; how it provides a rich deductive framework in which to locate and make sense of a wide variety of apparently contradictory positions in traditional normative ethics; and how it clearly demarcates the problems of applied ethics. I defend this version of ethical naturalism against the charge that it commits ‘the naturalistic fallacy’. I conclude that evolutionary theory provides the best account yet of the origins and status of moral values, and that moral philosophy should be thought of as a branch of natural history...|$|E

40|$|M. Litt. et Phil. (Clinical Psychology) People {{are deeply}} {{influenced}} {{by what they}} believe. Their basic epistemology is embodied in everything they create, material or otherwise. Thus, for example, every person's epistemology is reflected in his <b>behaviour.</b> <b>Psychology</b> {{is more and more}} aware of this aspect and there are studies and literature investigating the presuppositions of individuals as possible sources of pathology. There are further studies investigating the prejudices of psychological theories in an effort to expose their suppositions. The possibility of these theories contributing to the creation of pathology is investigated. Furthermore there are studies that describe the general intellectual spirit of an epoch. This time-spirit can influence people living in the same era {{to the extent that they}} can look, think, feel and act in a similar way. This study tries to identify the present general time-spirit that would contribute the most to the creation of a certain epistemology in the broad life-attitude of the man on street. The spirit of the Reasonable and Scientific Enlightenment is identified as the most prevalent force and influence in the life of western man. The specific presuppositions of this school of thought are described. It is then indicated to what extent these prejudices generate certain pathological effects. Furthermore it is seen how these suppositions facilitate a particular cognitive style, namely exclusive dualistic conceptualisation, and how it can create anxiety. An attempt is made to identify the so-called new and Post-Modernistic time-spirit that is developing in other disciplines and which is opposing the spirit of the Enlightenment. This study suggests that the prejudices of the ecosystemic and interactional models in Psychology can be reconciled with the presuppositions of Post-Modernism. The possibility that the epistemology of Post-Modernism can have a healing effect on the. symptomatic behaviour facilitated by the spirit of the Enlightenment, is put forward...|$|E
