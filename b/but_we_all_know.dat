500|$|The supercouple {{pairing of}} Nick and Sharon has been met with notable {{popularity}} among viewers {{as well as}} critics. SoapNet placed them {{on a list of}} [...] "Best of 2000s Decade: Couples", stating: [...] "...They've been apart since the death of their daughter, Cassie, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>know</b> that they belong together". On a list of [...] "Greatest Soap Opera Supercouples" [...] by Kim Potts of The Huffington Post, Nick and Sharon were placed 16th.

Nick's relationship with Phyllis has also gained a fan following, who refer to them as [...] "Phick".|$|E
500|$|In May, Benfica {{had four}} matches to gain four points on Sporting. The first {{was at the}} Estádio da Madeira with Nacional. Knowing that Sporting had lost points to Académica, Benfica hoped to narrow the gsp between them to two points. After an uneventful first half, in the 56th minute Nenê scored the opening goal for Nacional. Eight minutes later, Rúben Micael {{extended}} the lead, with Reyes reducing it in the 67th minute. Benfica pressed unsuccessfully for the equaliser before Nacional scored again with Miguel Fidalgo. Sánchez Flores realised that winning the league title was now impossible. On 9 May, Benfica met Trofense at home. Valdomiro scored first for the visitors in the 31st minute before Benfica scored twice in two minutes, reaching half-time with a 2–1 lead. In the second half, Paulinho tied the score for Trofense. Sporting won that day, so Benfica trailed by seven points with two match days left and could not qualify for the Champions League. Sánchez Flores said, [...] "I know when to arrive and when to leave. I {{do not want to}} be a problem for the club." [...] Playing out the schedule, Benfica first visited the Municipal de Braga. They won 3–1, ending a five-year winless streak there. The victory was against Jorge Jesus, widely reported as Sánchez Flores' successor. A week later, Benfica ended their campaign with a 3–1 win against Belenenses. Sánchez Flores analysed the club's season: [...] "They asked me to improve the team and I did. <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>know</b> what happened last year; we should set realistic goals. Second place was possible, but we failed in the final third. I won a title and fought for another." [...] A short time later, he and the club terminated his contract.|$|E
2500|$|Consider some {{subtleties}} {{that people}} are not consciously aware of. The verb is may be used in its full form or its reduced form: people say Kim is happy or Kim’s happy. However, certain instances of is never reduce, for example, the underlined items in Kim is happier than Tim is or I wonder what the problem is in Washington. Most people are not aware of this, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>know</b> subconsciously not to use the reduced form here. How did we come to this? The question arises because the eventual knowledge is richer than relevant experience. As children, we heard instances of the full form and the reduced form, but we were not instructed to avoid the reduced form in certain places; we had no access to [...] "negative data," [...] information about what does not occur.|$|E
5000|$|Dr. Warren Francis Caire (born January 1934), a {{registered}} Democrat in St. John the Baptist Parish, recalled that his grandfather often {{talked about the}} gubernatorial race: [...] "He would recall the story with sincerity, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>knew</b> that {{he knew he had}} no chance of beating Huey." ...|$|R

2500|$|A {{memorandum}} {{from the}} President's Special Assistant, Walt Rostow, to President Johnson said: [...] "What's on the Arab Ambassadors' minds {{boils down to}} one big question: Will we make good on our pledge to support the territorial integrity of all states in the Middle East? Our best answer is that we stand by that pledge, {{but the only way}} to make good on it is to have a genuine peace. The tough question is whether we'd force Israel back to 4 June borders if the Arabs accepted terms that amounted to an honest peace settlement. Secretary Rusk told the Yugoslav Foreign Minister: 'The US had no problem with frontiers as they existed before the outbreak of hostilities. If we are talking about national frontiers--in a state of peace--then we will work toward restoring them.' <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>know</b> that could lead to a tangle with the Israelis." ...|$|E

She took their heads, switched them, like it was a sick game. Then she took their bodies, she switched them too.

6000|$|... "You'd better resolve {{not to make}} puddings of--" [...] began Felicity, {{then stopped}} as {{suddenly}} {{as if she had}} bitten off the rest of her sentence and swallowed it. Cecily had nudged her, so she had probably remembered the Story Girl's threat that she would never tell another story if she was ever twitted with the pudding she had made from sawdust. <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>knew</b> what Felicity had started to say and the Story Girl dealt her a most uncousinly glance.|$|R

5000|$|I {{told the}} actors that I felt {{something}} was lacking {{and that we}} needed something more explicit, a novelty. I opened a kind of contest and each one gave different options. Jorge Sanz {{came out with the}} idea of the handkerchief. The production was successful team collaboration. From the beginning at the preparation of the film, there was a spirit of team collaboration, something very positive that made our work fun.

60|$|Jackson, who {{had lost}} his arm in the Sierra Mills and {{who had been the}} cause of my own {{conversion}} into a revolutionist, I never saw again; <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>knew</b> what he did before he died. He never joined the revolutionists. Embittered by his fate, brooding over his wrongs, he became an anarchist--not a philosophic anarchist, but a mere animal, mad with hate and lust for revenge. And well he revenged himself. Evading the guards, in the nighttime while all were asleep, he blew the Pertonwaithe palace into atoms. Not a soul escaped, not even the guards. And in prison, while awaiting trial, he suffocated himself under his blankets.|$|R

5000|$|... — On 16 January, leader Muammar Gaddafi decried Ben Ali's removal in {{a speech}} on Libyan state television: [...] "You have {{suffered}} a great loss. There is none better than Zine to govern Tunisia. Tunisia, a developed country that is a tourist destination, is becoming prey to hooded gangs, to thefts and fire. conditions in Tunisia reflect chaos {{with no end in}} sight.

I do not know these new people, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>knew</b> Ben Ali and the transformation that was achieved in Tunisia. Why are you destroying all of that? not be fooled by WikiLeaks which publishes information written by lying ambassadors in order to create chaos." ...|$|R

Although he knew that Albert Collins was his cousin, they did not meet until 1974. Gates stated that [...] "My daddy’s brother {{had a lot of}} kids out there in Texas. I never met them as a child, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>knew</b> of each other. When Albert came to Milwaukee I showed him around and we did some gigs together.

Gates found {{employment}} with the house band at Wilson’s Club in Milwaukee, and remained there for 15 consecutive years. Over the years Gates has performed across the Midwest, plus his traveling has led him to play in California, Kansas, Alabama, and in Europe. He also played alongside Sonny Boy Williamson II, who also lived in Milwaukee for a while.|$|R

60|$|MRS. ERLYNNE. So {{pleased to}} meet you, Lady Jedburgh. [Sits {{beside her on the}} sofa.] Your nephew and I are great friends. I am so much {{interested}} in his political career.

He's such a brilliant talker, too. <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>know</b> from whom he inherits that.

60|$|Mr Moffat was, {{as we have}} said, a man of wealth; <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>know,</b> {{from the}} lessons of early youth, how the love of money {{increases}} and gains strength by its own success. Nor was he a man of so mean a spirit as {{to be satisfied with}} mere wealth. He desired also place and station, and gracious countenance among the great ones of the earth.
