50|$|Minutes {{before the}} start of the race, Roberts' Yamaha <b>blew</b> a <b>seal</b> and sprayed the bike with oil. His crew managed to replace the seal in time but, Roberts went to the {{starting}} line with his gloves coated with oil, causing his hand to slip on the throttle during the race.|$|R
5000|$|Why <b>Seals</b> <b>Blow</b> Their Noses (Whitecap Books, 1992, 1993, 1995, 1997 and Voyageur Press, 1994, {{illustrated}} by Doug Penhale); French edition: Pourquoi Les Phoques Ont-Ils Un Ballon Sur Le Nez? (Heritage jeunesse, 1995) ...|$|R
50|$|Borealis polyolefins {{are used}} to make {{applications}} possible in flexible packaging (including <b>blown</b> film, heat <b>seal</b> and extrusion coating); rigid packaging (caps and closures, bottles, thin wall packaging, thermoforming), non-woven and technical fibres, and appliances.|$|R
50|$|Prior to the {{creation}} of the flip-top bottle, bottles were often made from <b>blown</b> glass and <b>sealed</b> with a cork, which was difficult to open by hand and often unreliable, particularly for carbonated beverages such as mineral water or beer.|$|R
50|$|The {{device was}} hell on pellets, blowing out {{their heads and}} leaving the bodies trapped in the barrel, so round balls were the only {{recommended}} ammo. It also <b>blew</b> the leather <b>seals</b> out of the early guns. It {{was very difficult to}} get medical ether ampules, so the system was never popular.|$|R
50|$|The {{explosion}} {{occurred in}} the Dennis district at around 2am, {{the time when the}} men would be having their mid-shift snack. Only six men survived the blast. A fire followed the explosion, and the mine was sealed off {{at the end of the}} following day. On 25 September, rescuer George Brown was killed on the surface when another explosion <b>blew</b> a <b>seal</b> off the Dennis shaft and he was hit by flying debris. Only eleven bodies were ever recovered. The mine owners docked the men half a day's pay, as they had not completed a full day's shift.|$|R
5000|$|His book Frost On My Moustache is {{an account}} of a journey in which the author {{attempts}} to emulate Lord Dufferin's fearless spirit and enthusiastic adventuring, but comes to identify far more with Dufferin's permanently miserable butler, Wilson, as portrayed in Dufferin's travel book Letters From High Latitudes. The book title refers to a joke Moore retells to his Scandinavian shipmates: [...] "An Eskimo calls out a repair man to check his car. The mechanic checks under the bonnet and then offers a diagnosis: [...] "Looks like you've <b>blown</b> a <b>seal,</b> mate." [...] "No," [...] says the driver, nervously fingering his upper lip, [...] "it's just frost on my moustache."" ...|$|R
40|$|The {{pharmaceutical}} packaging {{market is}} constantly advancing and has experienced annual growth {{of at least}} five percent per annum {{in the past few}} years. The market is now reckoned to be worth over $ 20 billion a year. As with most other packaged goods, pharmaceuticals need reliable and speedy packaging solutions that deliver a combination of product protection, quality, tamper evidence, patient comfort and security needs. Constant innovations in the pharmaceuticals themselves such as, <b>blow</b> fill <b>seal</b> (BFS) vials, anti-counterfeit measures, plasma impulse chemical vapor deposition (PICVD) coating technology, snap off ampoules, unit dose vials, two-in-one prefilled vial design, prefilled syringes and child-resistant packs have a direct impact on the packaging. The review details several of the recent pharmaceutical packaging trends that are impacting packaging industry, and offers some predictions for the future...|$|R
25|$|The DIN fitting {{is a type}} {{of direct}} {{screw-in}} connection to the cylinder. The DIN system is less common worldwide, but has the advantage of withstanding greater pressure, up to 300 bar, allowing use of high-pressure steel cylinders. They are less susceptible to <b>blowing</b> the O-ring <b>seal</b> if banged against something while in use. DIN fittings are the standard in much of Europe and are available in most countries. The DIN fitting is considered more secure and therefore safer by many technical divers.|$|R
50|$|The Alaskan Malamute had a {{prominent}} role with their human companions - as a utilitarian dog, working, hunting, and living alongside humans. The dogs were renowned for their excellent hunting abilities and were used to hunt large predators such as bears. They also aided their owners in finding seals by alerting to <b>seal</b> <b>blow</b> holes. The interdependent relationship between the Mahlemut and their dogs fostered prosperity among both and enabled them to flourish in the inhospitable land above the Arctic Circle.|$|R
50|$|The Mountain-Crushing Kanabō (Yamakudaki no Kanabō) is {{an ancient}} iron rod capable of {{destroying}} a whole mountain with a single <b>blow.</b> It is <b>sealed</b> deep within a mountain, but when stolen, the mountain activates a sort of security system by sending Taro whose mission is to recover the stolen Precious. It is believed throughout the Task that Taro is Momotarō of Japanese folklore, sent to retrieve the Kanabo from the Oni that stole it, being the Questers Gai and Ley.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the third}} quarter, Kansas City fell big as blown {{coverage}} allowed Steve McNair {{to complete an}} 87-yard touchdown pass to Mark Clayton. The pass was the longest made by McNair in his career and Clayton's longest reception [...] The <b>blown</b> coverage would <b>seal</b> the loss for the Chiefs. The score put the Ravens up 13-0 with just under 6 {{and a half minutes}} left in the third quarter. Chiefs fans began to file out of Arrowhead Stadium, realizing their team lost {{for the first time in}} December at home in over a decade.|$|R
500|$|In the {{remaining}} 17 weeks of war the Jagdwaffe struggled to recover sufficiently from the 1 January operation to remain an effective force. In strategic terms, German historian Werner Girbig wrote, [...] "Operation Bodenplatte {{amounted to a}} total defeat". The exhausted German units were {{no longer able to}} mount an effective defence of German air space during Operation Plunder and Operation Varsity, the Allied crossing of the Rhine River, or the overall Western Allied invasion of Germany. Subsequent operations were insignificant as a whole, and could not challenge Allied air supremacy. The only service in the Luftwaffe capable of profitable sorties was the night fighter force. In the last six weeks of the war the Luftwaffe was to lose another 200 pilots killed. Girbig wrote, [...] "it was not until the autumn of 1944 that the German fighter forces set foot down the sacrificial path; and it was the controversial Operation Bodenplatte that dealt this force a mortal <b>blow</b> and <b>sealed</b> its fate. What happened from then on {{was no more than a}} dying flicker".|$|R
5|$|The {{process of}} {{breaking}} into and exploring the communist tunnels began on 9 January, {{with the objective}} now switching to the location, clearance and destruction of the tunnel complexes. Whereas standard US Army practice was to <b>seal,</b> <b>blow</b> up or otherwise attempt to render tunnel systems unusable with smoke, tear gas and explosives before quickly moving on, the Australians spent {{the next few days}} laboriously searching and mapping the complexes they found using military engineers. Led by MacGregor, the Australian sappers from 3 Field Troop systematically tackled the tunnels, using telephone line and compasses to plot the subterranean passages. Small-scale contacts between the communists and the Australians continued and MacGregor was later awarded the Military Cross for his leadership.|$|R
50|$|The yoke {{connector}} {{is vulnerable}} to <b>blowing</b> the O-ring <b>seal</b> when impacted against an overhead or other obstacle. As {{the loss of the}} o-ring that seals the first stage to the cylinder valve causes a major loss of breathing gas, this weakness of the yoke connector is unacceptable, considering that the alternative DIN connection is freely available and more resistant to loss of seal on impact. The DIN connection also has a slightly lower profile in the vulnerable manifold area and is therefore less likely to be impacted in the first place, particularly with normal outlets (outlets that are perpendicular to the cylinder axis, as opposed to those tilted at about 45°).|$|R
5|$|The series {{then moved}} on to Britain, where Roberts would be {{involved}} in one of the closest races in Grand Prix history. Roberts' battle with Sheene at the 1979 British Grand Prix at Silverstone has been cited {{as one of the greatest}} races of the 1970s. Minutes before the start of the race, Roberts' Yamaha <b>blew</b> a <b>seal</b> and sprayed the bike with oil. His crew managed to replace the seal in time, but Roberts went to the starting line with his gloves coated with oil, causing his hand to slip on the throttle during the race. The race began with Roberts, Sheene and Dutch rider Wil Hartog breaking away from the rest of the field of riders. Hartog eventually fell behind as Roberts and Sheene continued to battle for the lead. The event featured numerous lead changes throughout the 28 lap race, with Roberts winning ahead of Sheene by a narrow margin of just three-tenths of a second. A third-place finish in the season-ending French Grand Prix, along with a crash by his main championship rival Ferrari, secured his second consecutive world championship.|$|R
2500|$|The design {{popularized by}} von Liebig thus {{consisted}} of an inner, straight tube {{surrounded by an}} outer straight tube, with the outer tube having ports for fluid inflow and outflow, and with the two tubes sealed in some fashion at the ends (eventually, by a <b>blown</b> glass ring <b>seal).</b> Its simplicity made it convenient to construct and inexpensive to manufacture, the higher heat capacity of the circulating water (vs. air) allowed for maintaining near to constant temperature in the condenser, and so the Liebig type {{proved to be the}} more efficient condenser—capable of condensing liquid from a much greater flow of incoming vapor—and therefore replaced retorts and air condensers. An added benefit of the simplicity of the straight inner tube design of this condenser type is that it can be [...] "packed" [...] with materials that increase the surface area (and so the number of theoretical plates of the distillation column, see section below), e.g., plastic, ceramic, and metal beads, rings, wool, etc. [...] See Fractional Distillation.|$|R
50|$|The {{race was}} {{dramatically}} {{won by the}} Ron Hodgson Motors entered Holden LH Torana SL/R 5000 L34 of Bob Morris and British driver John Fitzpatrick. The car slowed in the final laps trailing smoke but made to the finish. Television commentators and motoring journalists reported {{at the time that}} the Torana had broken an axle plus was having engine problems which accounted for the smoke. It was only later did the teams chief mechanic Bruce Richardson discover that there was no broken axle or engine trouble. What was actually slowing the car was a <b>blown</b> gearbox oil <b>seal.</b> The oil was leaking out onto the clutch causing it to slip badly. Second on the same lap was Holden Dealer Team Torana L34 of Colin Bond and John Harvey. Brothers Peter and Phil Brock in the Bill Patterson entered Torana L34 completed a second consecutive podium clean sweep for the Torana L34. In fact, Torana L34s filled the top seven places.|$|R

50|$|Mercury (Quicksilver) - {{the most}} {{depressing}} {{side of the}} game; usually stories played in this mood end {{with the death of}} all the characters. The aim of this mood is to show that any kind of action undertaken is futile and that the war is already over, hence all the people are already dead, which is a fact they just need to realise. Example: a group of soldiers stationed in a bunker is awaiting an attack by mutants. They are well-armed and trained, but there is a mistake in the intelligence they were given and they do not know yet that they are seriously outnumbered. The attack commences at dusk and it is already too late to retreat, so the characters decide to seal off the bunker, hopeful that the mutants {{will not be able to}} get inside and simply go away. The mutants attack the bunker with chemical weapons instead. The characters do not have enough gas masks to go around. As an effect, those strong enough will kill the weaker ones to get their masks, not knowing that the mutants will <b>blow</b> up the <b>sealed</b> entrance the following morning.|$|R
5000|$|In 1979, magician and debunker James Randi {{engineered}} a hoax, now {{referred to}} as Project Alpha to encourage a tightening of standards within the parapsychology community. Randi recruited two young magicians and sent them undercover to Washington University's McDonnell Laboratory where they [...] " [...] fooled researchers ... into believing they had paranormal powers." [...] The aim was to expose poor experimental methods and the credulity thought to be common in parapsychology. Randi has stated that both of his recruits deceived experimenters {{over a period of}} three years with demonstrations of supposedly psychic abilities: <b>blowing</b> electric fuses <b>sealed</b> in a box, causing a lightweight paper rotor perched atop a needle to turn inside a bell jar, bending metal spoons sealed in a glass bottle, etc. The hoax by Randi raised ethical concerns in the scientific and parapsychology communities, eliciting criticism even among skeptical communities such as the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CSICOP), which he helped found, but also positive responses from the President of the Parapsychological Association Stanley Krippner. Psychologist Ray Hyman, a CSICOP member, called the results [...] "counterproductive".|$|R
5000|$|Bison {{is heavily}} {{featured}} {{as the primary}} antagonist of the UDON-published Street Fighter comic series. His story is mostly unchanged from the official version, portraying him as the dark and sinister leader of Shadaloo. He operates behind a veil of various agents and associates who do his bidding as well as having numerous enemies (such as Chun-Li and Guile). Bison is the student of a mysterious woman whose tribe has {{mastered the art of}} Soul Power. After being exiled from further training, he studies the forbidden texts of their people and learns the nature of Psycho Power, the negative half of Soul Power. He returns to her later in life and uses this power to massacre his mentor's tribe, leaving only one survivor (Rose). Like the official story, Bison has a great interest in Ryu after watching him defeat Sagat at the last Street Fighter tournament and observing the nature of the Satsui no Hadō. At {{the end of the first}} series of comics, Bison is defeated in a battle with his own creation (Charlie, who had been empowered with Shadaloo technology) when Charlie sacrifices himself to plunge Bison into a river. Bison survives the fall and his body is reanimated with the Psycho Drive, whereupon he resumes his role as Shadaloo dictator. As the comic moves forward, Bison announces his [...] "Street Fighter II" [...] tournament, the second global gathering of martial artists, and is documented in the Street Fighter II Turbo series of comics. The tournament itself runs smoothly up until what would have been the final battle between Ryu and Bison. At this point, Akuma intervenes (much like the official story) and demands a fight with Ryu. Bison senses the amount of great power Akuma carries and attempts to subdue him in combat, only to be halted by Rose's spirit who restrains him while Akuma delivers the final <b>blow</b> and <b>seals</b> Bison's soul for good.|$|R
50|$|To seal {{a lasting}} {{peace in the}} wake of the F'Dor's death, Rhapsody travels to the Great Bowl just outside Ylorc, wherein the Cymrian Council had convened in times past. <b>Blowing</b> the Great <b>Seal,</b> she calls the Cymrians into a third Great Moot, wherein she plans to re-establish the old Cymrian Alliance, {{traditionally}} led by a Lord and Lady. Despite opposition from the previous Lady Cymrian, the Seer Anwyn, Rhapsody is (to her own surprise) confirmed as Lady Cymrian. Ashe is, after more debate, named Lord Cymrian; a fact which causes Rhapsody no little concern, as she, though loving him, had thought him wedded to another for purposes of state. Ashe convinces Rhapsody that, in fact, Rhapsody was his wife (through a complicated series of events at the end of the previous book), and furthermore informs her that the F'Dor had lied when it claimed the Rakshas had intercourse with her (the growth of her belly was revealed to the product of a 'seed of doubt'.) Anwyn, infuriated by her rejection, steals the Great Seal, calls up a legion of the dead, and transforms into a dragon to wreak havoc. She is defeated by Achmed, though the Cymrians suffer considerable losses, and a new age begins.|$|R
50|$|MacGregor {{served in}} the Vietnam War as a captain, {{commanding}} the 3 Field Troop engineers from September 1965 to September 1966. MacGregor was the first anti-communist soldier to explore the Cu Chi tunnels. Whereas standard US Army practice had been to <b>seal,</b> <b>blow</b> up or otherwise attempt to render tunnel systems unusable with smoke, tear gas and explosives before quickly moving on, MacGregor and his men searched and mapped the tunnels they found, using telephone line and compasses to plot the subterranean passages. MacGregor {{was the first to}} head down the tunnels. With a torch in one hand and his army pistol in the other, he was lowered into a tunnel by his sergeant, who had tied a rope around one of his legs. Over a period of four days MacGregor and his men found ammunition, radio equipment, medical supplies, typewriters, over 100,000 pieces of paper and food as well as signs of considerable Viet Cong presence. One of the men under his command, Corporal Bob Bowtell, died from asphyxiation when he became trapped in a tunnel {{that turned out to be}} a dead end. At an international press conference in Saigon shortly after Operation Crimp, MacGregor referred to his men as tunnel ferrets. An American journalist, having never heard of ferrets, used the term tunnel rats instead. The term stuck, and has since been used to refer any soldiers who performed underground search and destroy missions during the Vietnam War. MacGregor was later awarded the Military Cross for his leadership and actions. He was also awarded a Bronze Star Medal by the United States Armed Forces.|$|R
50|$|While {{spending}} time in the WayneTech Labs in Pre-Crisis Gotham City, Supergirl of Earth-One notices a device which Lucius Fox of Earth-One explains is designed to read her subconscious physical reactions. With it, he hopes that she can help Superman of Earth-One rebuild the Phantom Zone Projector by sensing the correct placements of the parts that she subconsciously remembers from when her father Zor-El and uncle Jor-El built it {{when she was a}} girl. Superman of Earth-One hopes that by opening a way to the Phantom Zone, they'll be opening {{a way out of the}} dome that fell over Gotham City of Earth-One a year ago. However, the Phantom Zone is filled with Krypton's worst criminals. After the device that would provide a one-way trip to the Phantom Zone is created, Superman of Earth-One and Supergirl of Earth-One enter only to have the device <b>blow</b> up <b>sealing</b> them there. Suddenly from beyond the dome, Lucius Fox of Earth-One hears a voice warning that the dome will soon fall, and champions will be forced to rise from each of the cities on the planet Telos and to fight for the survival of their people. Superman of Earth-One and Supergirl of Earth-One wonder what the purpose of the dome was. Perhaps it was to protect Gotham City from a catastrophe. Perhaps it has made them features in a zoo or prisoners. Suddenly, they are overcome by shockwaves from nearby and decide to investigate the source. En route, Superman of Earth-One explains that he admires Supergirl of Earth-One for her proactive behavior. She uses her powers for good, but he always uses his to react. Without warning, the pair are attacked by Phantom Zone prisoners who are eager for revenge. Superman of Earth-One urges Kara of Earth-One to go on without him, but in so doing is overcome. Supergirl of Earth-One spots geysers of gas coming from the ground. In the gas, she sees visions of her own past, future, and inevitable death at the hands of the Anti-Monitor. Angrily, she dispels the gas as she doesn't want to see any further parts of her future. She worries that if she doesn't go back to Earth, her loved ones will die. If she does go back, she will die. Determinedly, she decides that if she is to die, it is necessary that she save others doing it. Supergirl of Earth-One gets lost in the gas, losing track of time. Eventually, she realizes that Superman of Earth-One should have been back by now, and searches for him. Supergirl of Earth-One discovers that Superman of Earth-One is surrounded by Phantom Zone prisoners. She takes out several of them leaving only two of them who are guarding Superman of Earth-One. After taking out the guards, Supergirl of Earth-One grabs Superman of Earth-One and they get away. While looking for a way out of the Phantom Zone and evading the gases, Superman of Earth-One and Supergirl of Earth-One are attacked by the Phantom Zone prisoners. Back at Gotham City of Earth-One, Lucius Fox of Earth-One is horrified when the dome goes down and the human-hating Apes from Earth-AD march into Gotham City of Earth-One.|$|R
