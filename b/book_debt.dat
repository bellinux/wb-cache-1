50|$|Siebe Gorman, {{a diving}} {{equipment}} company, granted a debenture {{in favour of}} Barclays Bank to secure a loan.

5000|$|CDA Loxton SC, {{on behalf}} of the appellants, contended that the plain, {{ordinary}} and popular meaning of the words [...] "and other debts and claims of whatsoever nature" [...] were not capable of being restricted to <b>book</b> <b>debts.</b> These words were unambiguous and were intended to give wider security. The clear intention of the parties was to cover all debts of whatsoever nature, including <b>book</b> <b>debts.</b> It was contended that so literal a construction of the cession would not lead to any absurdity; neither would it be contrary to the expressed intention of the parties.|$|R
40|$|AnalysisIn Agnew v Commissioner of Inland Revenue, the Privy Council {{decided that}} for a fixed charge to be created over a company's present and future <b>book</b> <b>debts,</b> the chargee must {{exercise}} control over both the uncollected <b>book</b> <b>debts</b> and their realised proceeds. Agnew has thus cast doubt upon the correctness of Siebe Gorman v Barclays Bank Limited, where the debenture in question did not specifically restrict the chargor's freedom {{to draw on the}} proceeds after they were paid into a designated account with the chargee. Recently, a Siebe Gorman-type debenture came under judicial scrutiny in National Westminster Bank plc v Spectrum Plus Limited. The English High Court held that the control conferred by a Siebe Gorman-type debenture was deficient, whereas the English Court of Appeal took a completely different view. The issue of control concerning charges over <b>book</b> <b>debts</b> is therefore still unsettled.

5000|$|The {{case was}} {{cited by the}} House of Lords with {{approval}} by Lord Scott in [...] (at paragraph 87) {{in relation to the}} recharacterisation of a charge described as a fixed charge over <b>book</b> <b>debts</b> as a floating charge.|$|R
5000|$|Because of the {{differences}} in priority of fixed charges and floating charges, security documents came to be drafted to contain as many charges expressed to be fixed charges as possible, and leave as little as possible covered by the floating charge, where it would have secondary priority to the claims of the preferential creditors. A number of judicial decisions gave conflicting interpretations over the characteristics that were definitive of a fixed charge, particularly with reference to charges over <b>book</b> <b>debts</b> (and a fixed charge that did not contain those characteristics would be [...] "recharacterised" [...] as a floating charge). The position was definitively resolved in NatWest v Spectrum Plus Limited when the House of Lords confirmed that a charge over <b>book</b> <b>debts</b> could be a fixed charge, provided that the secured creditor exhibited the necessary degree of control over the proceeds of the <b>book</b> <b>debts.</b> This would normally require that they either be paid into a blocked account, or that they be paid directly to the secured creditor. Any lesser degree of control was not consistent with a fixed charge, and such charges would be construed as floating charges, regardless of what label the parties had given them.|$|R

40|$|From {{the first}} English {{settlement}} in colonial America {{to the beginning}} of the Revolution, the legal status of account books evolved. During this period, there was a scarcity of hard currency which made commercial transactions largely dependent upon a credit based, barter based economic system. Business transactions often were represented by <b>book</b> <b>debt.</b> As merchants brought legal actions over <b>book</b> <b>debt</b> disputes, American colonial courts and legislatures began to examine the English common law rules that placed several restrictions on the introduction of account books into evidence. Responding to economic and social necessity, colonial America developed a legal system that was more flexible and pragmatic than was the English system in regard to admitting account books into evidence. Thus, American colonial courts and legislatures met the commercial needs of the new world, and in so doing, provided the impetus for examining accounting standards, fiduciary duty and financial statements in today’s American legal system...|$|E
