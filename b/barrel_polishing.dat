One possible way to reduce the susceptibility of the Ti- 6 Al- 4 V / Ti- 6 Al- 4 V interface to fretting is the surface modification of the Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy. Among the tested, industrially available surface treatments, a combination of two deep anodic spark deposition treatments followed by <b>barrel</b> <b>polishing</b> resulted in a four times lower material release with respect to untreated, machined fretting pad surfaces. The fretting release has been quantified by means of radiotracers introduced in the alloy surface by proton irradiation. In a simple sphere on flat geometry, the semispherical fretting pads were pressed against flat, dog-bone shaped Ti- 6 Al- 4 V fatigue samples cyclically loaded at 4 Hz. In this way a cyclic displacement amplitude along the surfaces of 20 μm has been achieved. A further simplification consisted in the use of deionized water as lubricant.

Previously, this rod configured approach has achieved average output powers in a single 5 cm long by 2 mm diameter Yb:YAG rod of 430 W cw and 280 W q-switched. High beam quality (M{sup 2 } = 2. 4) q-switched operation has also been demonstrated at over 180 W of average output power. More recently, using a dual rod configuration consisting of two, 5 cm long by 2 mm diameter laser rods with birefringence compensation, we have achieved 1080 W of cw output with an M{sup 2 } value of 13. 5 at an optical-to-optical conversion efficiency of 27. 5 %. With the same dual rod laser operated in a q-switched mode, we have also demonstrated 532 W of average power with an M{sup 2 } < 2. 5 at 17 % optical-to-optical conversion efficiency.

40|$|Driven by a {{requirement}} {{to extend the}} lifespan of self-aligning lined spherical bearings, this research investigates the use of Elid (electrolytic in-process dressing) {{as a method of}} improving ball surface finish. Elid is a continuous and self-regulating electrochemical dressing process that modifies the surface of a grinding, lapping, or superfinishing wheel. It provides improved grit protrusion, impedes wheel loading / glazing and promotes effective cutting. The characteristics of the newly-developed Elid superfinishing process are in many ways fundamentally different to conventional superfinishing. The main difference is that the use of super-abrasives prevents the wheel from self-sharpening; the normal mechanism by which dulled conventional abrasives are removed and a wheel’s surface refreshed. Because the wheel’s performance and condition is continually maintained inprocess by the Elid system, metal resin bonded (MRB) wheels containing very small super-abrasives can be used. It is the utilization of these fine abrasives (30 to 0. 12 μm) that enables surface roughness values below 5 nm Ra to be consistently produced on the spherical surface of corrosion-resistant steel balls. This research provides an in-depth understanding of the Elid spherical superfinishing process; investigating the most effective use of the Elid system, wheel dressing requirements and process performance. Optimisation is provided in terms of evaluating the critical operating parameters, the most effective superfinishing cycle and the implications to the complete ball production chain. A range of techniques are used to evaluate processing performance and ball output quality. These include in-process monitoring of Elid and wheel spindle power levels, analysis of wheel condition, rates of ball surface generation and material removal, ball finish and form. Although predominantly concentrated on corrosion-resistant steel, testing is also conducted on titanium and various ball coatings. In investigating various ways of using the Elid system, this work considers electrodischarge truing, pre-process dressing, Elid 1, Elid 2, Elid 3, and Elid combined with electrolytically assisted superfinishing. The initial process solution of Elid 3 (electrodeless) superfinishing provides the capability of working on all standard size balls, however the dressing system lacks stability. The development of a fixturing system that has a small separate electrode enables Elid 1 (conventional) to be used on the majority of ball sizes. Elid 1 allows more aggressive and consistent dressing, a faster rate of ball material removal and thus a substantially reduced processing time. Results with a # 12, 000 wheel show that surface quality is vastly improved through the use of Elid whilst maintaining current production standards of form accuracy. Surface finishes of 2 nm Ra are achieved, which is an order of magnitude better than balls currently produced using <b>barrelling</b> / <b>polishing.</b> Processing times are equivalent or faster when using Elid 1. Alternatively, consistently sub 10 nm Ra finishes can be reached with a # 2, 000 wheel using Elid 2 (interval dressing). Generally MRB-CBN wheels provide a more effective carbide cutting action than conventional superfinishing wheels. Controlling wheel condition and achieving full and even ball to wheel conformity are the two most significant contributory factors to the success of Elid spherical superfinishing. Insufficient control of these factors results in poor output quality. Monitoring of wheel spindle and Elid power usage provides useful information in assessing the condition of the wheel and identifying potential problems. High spindle power correlates with fast material removal and is a result of high loads and a free cutting action. Elid processing can be employed for improving surface finish after the conventional honing stage, or after cylindrical grinding for improving both ball form and finish.

40|$|The European XFEL and the International Linear Collider {{are based}} on superconductingrf cavities. In order to reach the {{theoretical}} gradient limits of the superconducting cavitiesit is necessary to increase the mechanical quality and chemical composition of the innersurface {{as well as to}} understand the reason for performance limitations. This work is basedon the diagnosis of over 100 XFEL and HiGrade cavities whose performance was limitedby several factors: eld emission on dust or surface defects, low-eld thermal breakdowncaused by the defects, Q-slope etc. It was found that some defects were produced during the mechanical production of thecavity and were not removed by electro-chemical polishing, a standard processing tech-nique of the inner cavity surface. On the other hand, some of the defects were producedduring the electro-chemical polishing process as the surface initially had imperfections orinclusions of foreign material. One of the opportunities to overcome the aforementioned drawbacks is to replace the" electro-chemical polishing process by mechanical centrifugal <b>barrel</b> <b>polishing.</b> Theparameters of the surface after each polishing step were studied using small samples, so-called coupons. An undersurface layer was investigated using metallographic techniquesand cross sectioning. The inuence of centrifugal polishing on the specic parameters ofa 9 -cell cavity (eld atness, eccentricity etc.) was investigated. As a result, a single-stepcentrifugal <b>barrel</b> <b>polishing</b> process followed by a standard " electropolishing wasproposed for industrial application. Although the performance-limiting mechanisms are understood in general, the origin ofthe quench of the cavity is often unclear. To determine the quench locations, a localisationtool for thermal breakdown using the sound" in superuid helium has been used. All components of this tool were improved to increase the accuracy of the measurements. A new program code for quench localisation calculating the path of the second-soundwave was developed. This allows the signals from all sensors to be used, regardlessof their position relative to the quench site. The new approach was validated usingadditional techniques such as a temperature mapping and an optical inspection of theinner cavity surface. Furthermore, a new multi-sensor for second-sound wave detection inthe helium vessel of a cavity was developed and successfully tested on a serial-productionXFEL cavity. The determined quench site location was conrmed by subsequent opticalinspection.

40|$|The {{performance}} of Superconducting radio frequency cavities (SRF) is {{strongly influenced by}} various impurities within the penetration depth (50 nm) of Nb, which in turn depends on the applied surface treatments. The effect of these surface treatments on the impurities of Nb has been explored using various surface analytical treatments. But, the results are still inadequate in many aspects {{and the effect of}} sequential SRF treatments on the impurity distribution has not been explored. The present study analyses various impurities within the penetration depth of Nb samples, treated by SRF cavity processing techniques like colloidal silica polishing (simulating centrifugal <b>barrel</b> <b>polishing),</b> buffer chemical polishing (BCP), high pressure rinsing (HPR) and degassing under high vacuum (HV) condition at 600 C for 10 hrs. Static, dynamic and slow sputtering modes of Time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOFSIMS) technique was employed to study the effect of the above treatments on interstitial impurities, hydrocarbons, oxides, acidic residuals, reaction products and metallic contaminations. The study confirms that the impurity distribution in Nb is not only sensitive to the surface treatment, but also to their sequence. Varying the treatment sequence prior to HV degassing treatments affected the final impurity levels in HV degassed bulk Nb samples. BCP treated samples, exhibited minimum hydrocarbon and metallic contamination but, led to extensive contamination of the oxide layer with residuals and reaction products of acids used in BCP solution. HPR treatment, on the other hand was effective in reducing the acidic impurities on the top surface.

40|$|Systematic field {{emission}} (FE) measurements on flat Nb, Cu and Mo surfaces relevant for typical accelerating structures or photocathode substrates of linear accelerators are reported. The emitter activation {{and the resulting}} emitter number density of such surfaces as function of the applied electric activation field E act were measured with a {{field emission}} scanning microscope. Furthermore, a statistical model for the activation of typical emitters on metallic surfaces is developed and shows good agreement with the obtained results. Finally the FE of the emission sites were characterized by local I(E) measurements. Correlated surface analysis techniques (e. g. scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, optical profilometry, atomic force microscopy) were used to identify {{the origin of the}} FE. Measurements on dry-ice-cleaned (DIC) single crystal Nb after electropolishing (EP) and buffered chemical polishing (BCP) showed first FE at E act ≥ 120 MV m - 1 with onset fields of E on ≥ 50 MV m - 1. Conditioning of typical emitters up to 1 µA did not weaken the FE significantly. An alternative polishing with a combination of centrifugal <b>barrel</b> <b>polishing</b> and light BCP resulted in first FE at E act = 175 MV m - 1 with E on ≥ 80 MV m - 1. Heat treatments (HT) of single crystal and large grain Nb after high-pressure rinsing showed strong FE activation at T HB ≤ 400 °C with E on ≥ 40 MV m - 1 due to the dissolution of the native Nb 2 O 5 -layer. Accordingly, thermal oxidation of single crystal Nb in air after DIC led to a reduction of FE and finally to an activation at E act ≥ 150 MV m - 1. The implications of these results for the superconducting accelerating structures of a future International Linear Collider are discussed. FE measurements on diamond-turned and partially etched Cu surfaces relevant for the future Compact Linear Collider accelerating structures showed FE at E act ≥ 30 MV m - 1 with E on ≥ 20 MV m - 1 caused by particulates. Cleaning with ionized N 2 (DIC) reduced the FE with activation at E act ≥ 130 MV m - 1 (E act ≥ 140 MV m - 1) and E on > 30 MV m - 1 caused by surface defects. Furthermore, a strong activation effect was observed. A possible breakdown mechanism based on this effect is discussed. Comprehensive investigations of the FE of annealed single crystal and polycrystalline Mo plugs used as substrates for actual photocathodes revealed no FE up to E act = 50 MV m - 1, but HT at T HB ≥ 400 °C activated FE with E on ≥ 20 MV m - 1. O 2 loading into the Mo surface, however, partially weakened these emitters. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy of comparable Mo samples showed the dissolution of the native oxide layer during such HT. These results reveal the suppression of FE by native Mo oxides...|$|E
