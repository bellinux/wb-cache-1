40|$|International audienceBelt drives {{employing}} a single, flat serpentine <b>belt</b> <b>tensioned</b> by a passive tensioner {{are found in}} automotive engine Front End Accessory Drive (FEAD) where the crankshaft supplies power to accessories like alternators, air-conditioning compressors, pumps, etc. [1]. When the FEAD undergoes forced vibration due to crankshaft excitation, dynamic tension fluctuations can cause the belt to slip on the accessory pulleys [2]. The probability of belt slip increases with the peak drop in <b>belt</b> <b>tension</b> over the <b>pulley</b> during steady state operation [3]. In this paper, one possible solution is analyzed, using a decoupler to isolate/separate the accessory inertia (e. g. alternator) from the FEAD system. This is achieved by placing between the pulley and the accessory {{a combination of a}} one-way rigid clutch and an isolator spring. In this study, the rotational response of a typical FEAD is extended to include the clutch and isolator. An analytical solution is then obtained by considering it as a piecewise-linearized system moving about an equilibrium angular displacements. The performance of the ordinary FEAD with regard to tension fluctuation is then compared to that of the system equipped with a decoupler/isolator. The results obtained indicate that within the practical working range of engine speeds, use of either an isolator or a decoupler-isolator could significantly lower the dynamic tension drop across the accessory pulley...|$|R

5000|$|Active {{seat-belt}} buckle with Pre-Safe {{function for}} rear occupants: the active seat-belt buckle is fully integrated in the vehicle's PRE-SAFE® system. Whenever PRE-SAFE® becomes active in critical driving situations {{or when the}} system detects the vehicle approaching other objects at a critical speed, reversible <b>belt</b> <b>tensioning</b> is also performed in the rear via the active seat-belt buckle function. The restraint system and the passengers are thus better prepared for a possible accident system. In contrast to its extended position to facilitate fastening of the seat belt, the belt buckle is retracted by approx. 40 millimetres instead. This reversible function increases the <b>belt</b> <b>tensioning</b> on the occupant by up to 80 millimetres. In addition, the belt buckle branches off at a lower point at the occupant's hip. This {{reduces the risk of}} the pelvis submarining under the belt. Securing the occupants more effectively in this way can reduce the strain to which they are exposed {{in the event of an}} accident. The active seat-belt buckle complements the pyrotechnic <b>belt</b> <b>tensioning</b> which has featured as standard in Mercedes-Benz vehicles for many years now, and is triggered in the event of an actual impact.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Monitoring of the {{electrocardiogram}} (ECG) in premature {{infants with}} conventional adhesive-backed electrodes can harm their sensitive skin. Use of an electrode belt prevents skin irritation, {{but the effect}} of belt pressure on respiratory function is unknown. A strain gauge sensor is described which measures applied <b>belt</b> <b>tension.</b> Method The device frame was comprised of an aluminum housing and slide to minimize the device weight. Velcro tabs connected housing and slide to opposite tabs located at the electrode belt ends. The slide was connected to a leaf spring, to which were bonded two piezoresistive transducers in a half-bridge circuit configuration. The device was tested for linearity and calibrated. The effect on infant respiratory function of constant <b>belt</b> <b>tension</b> in the normal range (30 g– 90 g) was determined. Results The mechanical response to a step input was second order (f n = 401 Hz, ζ = 0. 08). The relationship between applied tension and output voltage was linear in the range 25 – 225 gm of applied tension (r 2 = 0. 99). Measured device sensitivity was 2. 18 mV/gm tension using a 5 V bridge excitation voltage. When <b>belt</b> <b>tension</b> was increased in the normal range from 30 gm to 90 gm, {{there was no significant}} change in heart rate and most respiratory functions during monitoring.

Conclusion The mechanical and electrical design of a device for monitoring electrocardiogram electrode <b>belt</b> <b>tension</b> is described. Within the typical range of application tension, cardiovascular and respiratory function are not substantially negatively affected by electrode belt force. </p...|$|R

The objective {{of this study was to}} develop a model which is able to consider both single and multiple belt systems with a pivoted-arm automatic belt tensioner and determine the natural frequencies, mode shapes, forced response and dynamic <b>belt</b> <b>tension.</b> Experiments were conducted on two- and three-pulley systems, with and without an automatic belt tensioner, to investigate the angular vibration characteristics of simplified accessory drives. The results of these experiments were in good agreement with the analytical model.

50|$|Power is {{transmitted}} from the engine to the drive system through drive belts. Originally, the R22 used four separate v-belts running on multi-groove sheaves. This system proved problematic, as individual belts would sometimes roll over in their groove and fail. As a temporary measure, in 1982, R22 operators received a kit from Robinson that was installed in the cockpit and on the <b>belt</b> <b>tension</b> actuator, isolating the tensioning circuits and locking the clutch/drive system at take-off tension. The problem was ultimately solved by replacing the four individual v-belts with two dual v-belts. The upper, driven sheave is mounted on the main/tail rotor drive shaft incorporating flexible couplings, and is raised and lowered relative to the engine-mounted, driving sheave {{by means of a}} <b>belt</b> <b>tension</b> actuator. During shutdown, the actuator is used to lower the upper sheave to loosen the drive belts. For startup, the engine is started with the belts loose, allowing the engine to run without spinning the rotor system. Immediately after engine start, the clutch switch located in the cockpit is closed by the pilot, powering the actuator to slowly raise the upper sheave to flight position, which tightens the belts. The actuator is thereafter controlled by pressure-sensing column springs, automatically maintaining proper <b>belt</b> <b>tension</b> during flight as the belts wear and stretch. The shaft on which the upper sheave is mounted drives both the main and tail rotors; the main gear box delivers power to the main rotor shaft through a set of splash-lubricated spiral bevel gears.|$|R
50|$|The exposed drum shafts {{are used}} to install and fix the drum motor into the {{conveyor}} frame and do not rotate. The shaft can be a single “through” shaft where the motor and gearbox are assembled on, and fixed to, the shaft with keys or pins. However, this type of drum motor design has a limited maximum radial load due to the bending stresses caused by the normal <b>belt</b> <b>tension</b> of a conveyor and is therefore used mainly for small light duty conveyors and loads. For heavier loads the most common design is to use two separate shafts, one fixed to the motor housing and one fixed to the gearbox housing where the mass of metal from the motor and gearbox significantly increases {{the strength of the}} drum motor allowing much higher payloads and longer conveyor applications. Typically one shaft is short (stub shaft) with a consistent length and the other increases in length according to the drum shell or belt width. Over certain widths, the shaft can be further reinforced to prevent bending under high <b>belt</b> <b>tension.</b>|$|R
