5|$|ExxonMobil leads a {{consortium}} of Chevron and Petronas that has invested $3.7 billion to develop oil reserves estimated at one <b>billion</b> <b>barrels</b> in southern Chad. Oil production began in 2003 with {{the completion of a}} pipeline (financed in part by the World Bank) that links the southern oilfields to terminals on the Atlantic coast of Cameroon. As a condition of its assistance, the World Bank insisted that 80% of oil revenues be spent on development projects. In January 2006 the World Bank suspended its loan programme when the Chadian government passed laws reducing this amount. On 14 July 2006, the World Bank and Chad signed a memorandum of understanding under which the Government of Chad commits 70% of its spending to priority poverty reduction programmes.|$|E

25|$|Hubbert's 1956 {{production}} curves {{depended on}} geological estimates of ultimate recoverable oil resources, {{but he was}} dissatisfied by the uncertainty this introduced, given the various estimates ranging from 110 billion to 590 <b>billion</b> <b>barrels</b> for the US. Starting in his 1962 publication, he made his calculations, including that of ultimate recovery, based only on mathematical analysis of production rates, proved reserves, and new discoveries, independent of any geological estimates of future discoveries. He concluded that the ultimate recoverable oil resource of the contiguous 48 states was 170 <b>billion</b> <b>barrels,</b> with a production peak in 1966 or 1967. He considered that because his model incorporated past technical advances, that any future advances would occur at the same rate, and were also incorporated. Hubbert continued to defend his calculation of 170 <b>billion</b> <b>barrels</b> in his publications of 1965 and 1967, although by 1967 he had moved the peak forward slightly, to 1968 or 1969.|$|E
