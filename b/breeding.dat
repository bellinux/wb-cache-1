5|$|The red-billed tropicbird usually nests on {{isolated}} cliff faces, {{in loose}} colonies. It uses a simple scrape nest, {{located in a}} place it can easily take off from. The age of first <b>breeding</b> is usually five years, although this age is variable; a three-year-old tropicbird was once seen <b>breeding.</b> In some locations, <b>breeding</b> happens year-round, while in others, <b>breeding</b> occurs seasonally. For example, for islands in the California Current, <b>breeding</b> starts in November or December, while it occurs year-round in the Galapagos. <b>Breeding</b> {{is influenced by the}} availability of food, with an increase in food generally causing an increase in <b>breeding.</b> Individually, this bird only breeds every nine to twelve months. A <b>breeding</b> bird usually returns to its partner and nest location from the previous <b>breeding</b> cycle.|$|E

5|$|Although the Haflinger is {{now found}} {{all over the}} world, the {{majority}} of <b>breeding</b> stock still comes from Austria, where state studs own the stallions and carefully maintain {{the quality of the}} breed. However, there are <b>breeding</b> farms located in the United States, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, and England. As of 2007, Italian Haflingers had the largest population of any breed in that country. Due to selective <b>breeding</b> during the 1990s aiming to increase height, some breed lines became favored over others in Italy. A 2007 study found little inbreeding within the Italian Haflinger population as a whole, although certain less popular lines had a higher incidence due to the existence of fewer <b>breeding</b> stallions. Haflingers are bred throughout France, especially in the provinces of Brittany, Burgundy and Picardy, with between 350 and 400 foals born each year. Slovenia also has a small Haflinger population, with around 307 <b>breeding</b> mares and 30 <b>breeding</b> stallions as of 2008. A 2009 study found that although there was a very small amount of inbreeding in the population, it was increasing slightly over the years.

5|$|Although toads {{are usually}} solitary animals, in the <b>breeding</b> season, {{large numbers of}} toads {{converge}} on certain <b>breeding</b> ponds, where the males compete to mate with the females.

5|$|Australian ravens begin <b>breeding</b> {{once they}} are three years old. <b>Breeding</b> season is from July to September, with no {{substantial}} difference in timing across its range around the country despite it inhabiting a range of diverse climates and habitats across 19 degrees of latitude. Rowley has pointed out this is unusual for a bird species {{with a wide range}} and has postulated that <b>breeding</b> is initiated by day length. Rarely, <b>breeding</b> can take place in May, June or October. Australian ravens generally nest in tall trees, never near to the ground as some species do. The nest also functions as a lookout post and so tall or emergent trees are selected. The ravens occasionally nest on buildings, telegraph poles, or tall windmills which allow the species to occupy areas lacking in tall trees. Windmills may have assisted the spread of the species in North Queensland and the Northern Territory. The highest recorded corvid nest in Australia was found atop the AWA Tower in Sydney.|$|E
5|$|Because the kakapo is long-lived, with {{an average}} life {{expectancy}} of 58years and the maximum at about 90 years, it tends to have an adolescence before it starts <b>breeding.</b> Males start booming at about 5years of age. It was thought that females reached sexual maturity at 9 years of age, but this idea was debunked in the 2008 <b>breeding</b> season when two 6-year-old females named Apirama and Rakiura laid eggs. Generally females do not seek out males until they are between 9 and 11 years old. The kakapo does not breed every year and {{has one of the}} lowest rates of reproduction among birds. <b>Breeding</b> occurs only in years when trees mast (fruit heavily), providing a plentiful food supply.

40|$|Cows dairy {{reproduction}} and its level of efficiency are main topics of interest of our breeders. Constant downward trend of important reproduction indicators, often reaching critical values, is becoming main problem of many agricultural plants aligned to beef-raising. The higher attention to beef-raising is needed {{especially in the}} foothill areas and in regions with harder conditions (LFA areas). Beef-raising is not aimed to fulfil only a production, it also stands for unsubstituable reproduction functions. The aim of this thesis is to evaluate reproduction indicators in three different <b>breedings</b> in the five year range 2002 - 2006 (such as insemination interval, intersemination interval, servis cycle, insemination index, parturition interval and pregnancy percentage after first insemination) on the chosen dairycows. According the level the individual <b>breedings</b> were compared (Rychnov nad Malsi, Vlci Jamy, Tesov) testing the CESTR runt. In Rychnov nad Malsi, where the runt CESTR and HOLSTYN are breeded, the differences between these runts reproduction indicators were evaluated. The level of milk efficiency, the methods of beef-raising, month of calving and order of lactation were taken into account. The length of SP is unsatisfactory in all <b>breedings.</b> The average SP in the whole period under observation were in Rychnov nad Malsi 125, 2 days (CESTR), in Vlci Jamy 123, 5 days and in Tesov 125, 7 days.

These results correspond to a database, of epidemic studies carried out in the district of Quilcas - Huancayo for four years, for the members of the Laboratory of Preventive Veterinary Medicine of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine of the Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos - Lima Peru. The time of persistence of maternal antibodies was on the average of 148. 8, with a range of 117 to 242 days. With respect to the sex, it was found that in males it remained 146 days and in the females 155 days, not finding difference significant statistic. The time average in that the <b>breedings</b> of swinish positive to EITB for cisticercosis were infected with cisticercos, it was of 170 days, there not being difference significant statistic when evaluating the data among sexes. The 208 negative <b>breedings</b> to descending EITB of positive or negative mothers to EITB for cisticercosis, they were infected average of 193. 1 days at one time, with range of 98 to 588 days, having found difference significant statistic when evaluating among sexes. To determine the effect of the variables: mothers' immunologic state and sex and immunologic state of the <b>breedings</b> about the time of infection, were analyzed the data by means of the regression of Cox, having found that the variable sexe has effect. These results demonstrate that the maternal antibodies against cisticercosis swinish overdimension the results of the EITB when he/she takes a single sample for epidemic studies and these they contain <b>breedings</b> smaller than 8 months, since the test of EITB doesn't discriminate against if the detected antibodies are those transferred of their mothers or they are those formed by exhibition to cisticercos antigens.

Con el presente estudio se determinó el efecto de la persistencia de anticuerpos maternales contra Cisticercosis porcina sobre el EITB, después de haber analizado los resultados de 299 crías clasificados según el sexo, estado inmunológico de crías y sus madres. Estos resultados corresponden a una base de datos, de estudios epidemiológicos realizados en el distrito de Quilcas- Huancayo desde hace cuatro años, por los integrantes del Laboratorio de Medicina Veterinaria Preventiva de la Facultad de Medicina Veterinaria de la Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos - Lima Perú. El tiempo de persistencia de anticuerpos maternales fue de 148. 8 en promedio, con un rango de 117 a 242 días. Referente al sexo, se encontró que en machos permanecía 146 días y en las hembras 155 días, no encontrando diferencia estadística significativa. El tiempo promedio en que las crías de porcinos positivos a EITB para cisticercosis se infectaban con cisticercos, fue de 170 días, no habiendo diferencia estadística significativa al evaluar los datos entre sexos. Las 208 crías negativas a EITB descendientes de madres positivas o negativas a EITB para cisticercosis, se infectaron en un tiempo promedio de 193. 1 días, con rango de 98 a 588 días, habiendo encontrado diferencia estadística significativa al evaluar entre sexos. Para determinar el efecto de las variables: estado inmunológico de madres y sexo y estado inmunológico de las crías sobre el tiempo de infección, se analizó los datos mediante la regresión de Cox, habiendo encontrado que solo la variable sexo tiene efecto.
