5|$|Tracing in English {{law is a}} {{procedure}} to identify property (such as money) that has been taken from the claimant involuntarily. It is not in itself a way to recover the property, but rather to identify {{it so that the}} courts can decide what remedy to apply. The procedure is used in several situations, broadly demarcated by whether the property has been transferred because of theft, <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> <b>trust,</b> or mistake.|$|E

5|$|In 1868 and 1869, judgements {{went against}} the Met {{in a number of}} hearings, finding {{financial}} irregularities such as the company paying a dividend it could not afford and expenses being paid out of the capital account. In 1870, its directors were found guilty of a <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> <b>trust</b> and ordered to compensate the company. Although they all appealed and were allowed in 1874 to settle for a much lower amount, to restore shareholders' confidence the directors had all been replaced by October 1872 and Edward Watkin appointed chairman. Watkin was an experienced railwayman and already on the board of several railway companies, including the South Eastern Railway (SER), and had an aspiration to construct a line from the north through London to that railway.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, {{the tribe}} {{filed suit in}} the United States Court of Federal Claims, seeking $14,000,000 in damages for <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> <b>trust</b> by DOI. The tribe argued that the United States had {{exclusive}} control over the buildings and allowed them to fall into disrepair, {{a violation of the}} trust relationship established by the 1960 statute. Additionally, the tribe claimed that the Snyder Act and the National Historic Preservation Act applied in this case. The Snyder Act deals with appropriations to the BIA, and the National Historic Preservation Act discussed federal assistance for preservation programs. The United States moved for dismissal on the basis of lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim. In addition, the United States claimed that the statute of limitations had run under both the Tucker Act and the Indian Tucker Act, the acts governing claims in the Federal Court of Claims. The trial court dismissed the suit on the failure to state a claim.|$|E

25|$|When {{trustees}} fail {{in their}} main duties, the law imposes remedies {{according to the}} nature of the breach. In general, breaches of rules surrounding performance of the trust's terms can be remedied through an award of specific performance, or compensation. Breaches of the duty of care will trigger a right to compensation. Breaches of the duty to avoid conflicts of interest, and misapplications of property will give rise to a restitutionary claim, to restore the property taken away. In these last two situations, the courts of equity developed further principles of liability that could be applied even when a trustee had gone bankrupt. Some recipients of property that came from a <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> <b>trust,</b> as well as people who had assisted in a <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> <b>trust,</b> might incur liability. Equity recognised not merely a personal, but also a proprietary claim over assets taken in <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> <b>trust,</b> and perhaps also profits made in breach of the duty of loyalty. A proprietary claim meant that the claimant could demand the thing in priority to other creditors of the bankrupt trustee. Alternatively, the courts would follow an asset or trace its value if the trust property was exchanged for some other asset. If trust property had been given to a third party, the trust fund could claim back the property as of right, unless the recipient was a bona fide purchaser. Generally, any recipient of trust property who knew about the <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> <b>trust</b> (or maybe ought to have known) could be made to give back the value, even if they had themselves exchanged the thing for other assets. Lastly, against people who may never have received trust property but had assisted in a <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> <b>trust,</b> and had done so dishonestly, a claim arose to return the property's value.|$|E

50|$|Millett LJ allowed Mothew's appeal, {{and held}} that a causal link needed to be established. Just because the {{solicitor}} himself had fiduciary duties to his clients, that {{did not mean that}} every <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> duty of care was a <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> a fiduciary duty. When considering <b>breaches</b> <b>of</b> <b>trust,</b> causation need not be demonstrated, since these are concerned with acts of bad faith or <b>breaches</b> <b>of</b> the duty of loyalty that result in restitutionary damages. The building society had been fully informed and had consented to Mothew's course of action, which broke the causal link.|$|R
