5000|$|Another type of Chabutro, {{which can}} be seen in Gujarat & Rajasthan have {{different}} design and are built only for feeding & resting place for birds & not for <b>breeding</b> <b>purpose.</b> The upper enclosure of such Chabutra are artistically craved and designed like a window of house with conical dome or Chhatri. In English it can vaguely be defined as [...] "Pigeon-Tower" [...] or [...] "Pigeon-hole-tower". Actually, Chabutaro is a word of Gujarati language. In Gujarati language Pigeon is called Kabutar. The word Chabutro has arrived from word Kabutar, since Chabutaro is specially constructed for use and breeding of Pigeons only in Gujarat, especially Kutch. People and specially ladies of Gujarat, belonging to Hindu faith, consider it auspicious to feed Pigeons. Therefore, this structure is made in villages, where pigeons can live. In early morning, you can find ladies, children and gents alike feeding grains to Pigeons below Chabutro. The Chabutaro is, therefore, usually found in villages dominated or established by Hindu, Kshatriya & Brahmin communities of Gujarat.|$|E

40|$|Italy is {{the first}} sweet cherry {{producer}} in Europe. Its rich germplasm of local varieties has not been fully characterised or exploited in breeding programmes. Sweet cherry is a self-incompatible species; this trait is controlled by a gametophytically expressed multi-allelic (S) locus. The knowledge of sweet cherry S-alleles and cross-incompatibility groups is important for growers and breeders for choosing appropriate pollinators in the orchard and planning crosses. In this work, we analysed 94 sweet cherry cultivars native of {{large part of the}} Italian regions where cherry is grown. The microsatellite primer pair set and the reference cultivars agreed for cherry by the Prunus Working Group of the European Collaborative Programme for Genetic Resources (EPCGR) were used, as well as two consensus primer pairs for the incompatibility (S) locus. We assessed the genetic diversity and relatedness of this germplasm; unravelled a number of duplicates, synonyms and homonyms cases; assigned each accession to known or new S-(in) compatibility group. Differences in the relative occurrence of S-alleles were found in comparison to International cultivars reported in various published works.

40|$|Even {{though the}} {{repetitive}} and decentralized nature of plant organogenesis confers a large plasticity to plants, their architecture is highly organized throughout ontogeny and at different scales. Growth, branching and flowering constitute the main processes leading to plant architectures and are key determinants of plant productivity, whatever the target product (biomass, flowers, seeds or fruits). Their genetic and genomic study is thus {{of great interest}} for <b>breeding</b> <b>purpose.</b> However, progresses have been limited by many constraints resulting from the large size and long-live of trees and therefore the difficult to assess phenotypes on large numbers of individuals for exploring both the genetic effect or genetic by environment interaction. Despite these limitations, significant advances have been recently obtained in quantitative genetics studies performed on architectural traits in forest and fruit trees, and on the physiological and molecular comprehension of mechanisms underlying plant architectural edification. Moreover, tools and methods for describing plant architectures and for exploring genetic and molecular controls have been improved, leading to new perspectives in terms of high-throughput genotyping, phenotyping and genomic studies. In this chapter, we review the genetic, physiological and molecular analyses that have been performed {{in the last years}} on tree architecture, with a particular focus on advances realized on tree crops.

Likewise Sixty- seven serum samples were also collected from adult female yaks having history of abortion and retained placenta, and from male yaks used for <b>breeding</b> <b>purpose</b> from Mustang and Myagdi districts.

However, all the 67 serum samples examined were found negative to the Brucella abortus antibody on ELISA test suggesting that the yak population was free from brucellosis in these areas.
