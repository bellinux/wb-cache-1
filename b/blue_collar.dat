They represent the typical suburban family with traditional values. <b>Blue</b> <b>Collars</b> will usually be attracted to a city with available housing, but under certain circumstances will [...] "evolve" [...] from Have-Nots.

Have-Nots do not demand any services at all. In fact, they are content with having nothing more than a house and a job. Unlike Fringes and <b>Blue</b> <b>Collars,</b> Have-Nots are not too easily attracted to a city. In order for them to appear, the player will usually have to create a district focusing primarily on Have-Not jobs and leisure activities. It is also possible to attract Have Nots by having Fringes and <b>Blue</b> <b>Collars</b> [...] "devolve" [...] into Have-Nots. This is achieved when Fringes and <b>Blue</b> <b>Collars</b> remain unemployed for a certain amount of time.|$|R

5|$|Several journalists {{hypothesized}} that the Johnson–Bird rivalry was so appealing because it represented many other contrasts, such as the clash between the Lakers and Celtics, between Hollywood flashiness ("Showtime") and Boston/Indiana <b>blue</b> <b>collar</b> grit ("Celtic Pride"), and between blacks and whites. The rivalry was also significant because it drew national attention to the faltering NBA. Prior to Johnson and Bird's arrival, the NBA had gone through a decade of declining interest and low TV ratings. With the two future Hall of Famers, the league won {{a whole generation of}} new fans, drawing both traditionalist adherents of Bird's dirt court Indiana game and those appreciative of Johnson's public park flair. According to sports journalist Larry Schwartz of ESPN, Johnson and Bird saved the NBA from bankruptcy.|$|E
5|$|Born into a <b>blue</b> <b>collar</b> Irish-American {{family in}} upstate New York, LeHand studied {{secretarial}} science in high school, took {{a series of}} clerical jobs, and eventually began {{to work for the}} Franklin Roosevelt vice presidential campaign in New York. Following the Democrats' defeat, FDR's wife Eleanor invited her to join the family at their home in Hyde Park, New York to clean up the campaign correspondence. FDR subsequently hired LeHand to work for him on Wall Street, where he was the partner in a law firm and also worked for a bonding company. After FDR was partially paralyzed in August 1921, LeHand became his daily companion and one of the main people to encourage him to return to politics, along with Eleanor and his political strategist, Louis McHenry Howe. She remained his secretary when he became Governor of New York in 1929 and when he became president in 1933, serving until a 1941 stroke left her partially paralyzed and barely able to speak. She moved to her sister's home in Somerville, Massachusetts and died after another stroke in 1944.|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} of pathology in <b>blue</b> <b>collars</b> – mainly due to repetitive tasks - determines {{a serious problem}} for the organization safety, affecting company’s performances and organizational climate. After redesigning its main production lines, Electrolux Italia tested ‘Accomodation RAL’, a new procedure of re-integration in line of <b>blue</b> <b>collars</b> with functional limitation. The objective of the research is to detect the psychosocial impact {{of this kind of}} Diversity Management (DM) strategy and to measure its efficacy. The peculiarity of the study is to underline the strategic role of the worker’s involvement in the processes of change. The assumption of responsibilities, the research of meaning in its own job and role, the perception of a procedure based on the workers’ involvement result significant related to safety perception and performance. The huge literature about <b>blue</b> <b>collars</b> and the psychosocial factors about the work in line is mainly dedicated to monotony, stress, muscle-skeletal disorders. Rare are yet the researches (Rivilis et al., 2008) which examine the efficacy of involvement in DM.

5000|$|In game, the six {{classes are}} {{depicted}} in a circle. Clockwise {{from the top}} are Elites, Suits, <b>Blue</b> <b>Collars,</b> Have-Nots, Fringes, and Radical Chics. Each class can tolerate the two adjacent to it, but is hostile towards the three across the circle. Further, the income generated by businesses focusing on each class is indicated by its height on the circle, Have-Nots generating the least and Elites generating the most. Lastly, {{the left side of}} the circle favors education while the right side favors safety (e.g. police and fire department coverage). The higher classes are of course more demanding. When a city is founded, only Fringes, Have-Nots, and <b>Blue</b> <b>Collars</b> will settle there. The Suits must be attracted by having good conditions for the <b>Blue</b> <b>Collars,</b> the Radical Chics are attracted by good conditions for the Fringes, and the Elites are attracted by good conditions for both the Suits and the Radical Chics. Due to the literal class warfare, if classes that dislike each other live near each other, they will start riots and make complaints. Much of the gameplay focuses on arranging your city so that this will not occur.|$|R

40|$|We {{address the}} role of migrant workers from extra-EU {{countries}} in Italian manufacturing production at the firm-level. Cross price and demand elasticities confirm the complementarity found in previous studies between migrants and natives, which holds when native workers are split into white and <b>blue</b> <b>collars.</b> However, when measuring how the ratio of domestic to migrant (migrant to domestic) workers changes {{in response to a}} change in the migrant (domestic) wage - Morishima Elasticity of Substitution - we find that the two labour inputs are substitutes. We further analyse the effect of the use of foreign labour in manufacturing firms on the industry composition. We find that, ceteris paribus, had migrant labour not grown in our sample period, the weight of Low Skill intensive sectors would have been approximately 2 % lower and the white to <b>blue</b> <b>collars</b> ratio would have been slightly higher than observed, even accounting for the complementarity between natives and migrants.

30|$|INPS wage data lack {{separate}} {{information on}} the various components of wages {{in order to understand}} where the flexibility comes from. We separate the two parts using a unique dataset that has been hand-collected 15 and provides us with information over time about negotiated wages for two national contracts: metalwork industry and wholesale and retail trade. These national contracts cover respectively around 25 and 15 % of all employees in the private non-agricultural sector in Italy. As described in Section  2, negotiated wages set minima for workers according to their sector and contractual position. In the INPS data, we identify <b>blue</b> <b>collars,</b> white collars and middle managers. Since in the national contracts, these categories are finer (there are three categories for <b>blue</b> <b>collars,</b> four categories for white collars and two for middle managers), we need to aggregate them in order to match them with the social security data. Although this aggregation may result in some measurement error, this is less of a problem when we look at wage changes instead of wage levels, since the agreed percentage changes are usually similar across broad positions.|$|R

We have two main aims: discuss new ways of measuring organizational change, allowing for diversity in its orientation and analyze empirically how new organizational practices have been shaping production jobs in French manufacturing firms throughout the nineties. In the first section, we describe the statistical anatomy of organizational change, using the point of view given by management in the business section of the C. O. I survey. We then turn to the labor force section of the survey where we analyze the patterns of work organization in our samples of <b>blue</b> <b>collars</b> and of technicians and supervisors. We finally confront the information gathered on these two different levels. We find that a common ingredient to new organizational practices is the production of...|$|R
