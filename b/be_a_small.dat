5|$|At 3400 ton, {{the vessel}} is argued to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> frigate {{rather than a}} corvette, and poorly armed. It's also been alleged that the Indian Navy wanted a vessel with the {{endurance}} of a 3400-ton frigate and an armament of a 1200-ton corvette.|$|E
5|$|The volcano is {{currently}} considered dormant. Future eruptive activity may cause sector collapses, although they would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> danger to human life, {{given that the}} area is sparsely inhabited.|$|E
5|$|Between 1925 and 1929, the SS was {{considered}} to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> Gruppe (battalion) of the SA. Except in the Munich area, the SS was unable to maintain any momentum in its membership numbers, which declined from 1,000 to 280 as the SA continued its rapid growth. As Heiden attempted to keep the SS from dissolving, Heinrich Himmler became his deputy in September 1927. Himmler displayed good organizational abilities compared to Heiden. The SS established a number of Gaus (regions or provinces). The SS-Gaus consisted of SS-Gau Berlin, SS-Gau Berlin Brandenburg, SS-Gau Franken, SS-Gau Niederbayern, SS-Gau Rheinland-Süd, and SS-Gau Sachsen.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{its small}} size and {{location}} {{away from the}} plane of the Milky Way, Caelum is rather devoid of deep-sky objects, and contains no Messier objects. The only deep-sky object in Caelum to receive much attention is HE0450-2958, an unusual Seyfert galaxy. Originally, the jet's host galaxy proved elusive to find, and this jet appeared to be emanating from nothing. Although {{it has been suggested that}} the object is an ejected supermassive black hole, the host is now agreed to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> galaxy that is difficult to see due to light from the jet and a nearby starburst galaxy.|$|E
5|$|Similarly 'marked' {{armed guards}} arrive {{from the plant}} and take Dillon away. Whilst being taken Dillon threateningly tells Quatermass not to follow. After the guards' {{departure}} Quatermass speaks with a tramp, who explains that there used to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> government research unit consisting of a few huts by Winnerden Flats, and that a year ago they expanded and bulldozed the village, and built the plant and a prefab town for the construction workers. At the prefab town, Quatermass sees that 'the mark' and strange behaviour are associated with those who find the fallen meteorites, but before he can find out more the community police order him away.|$|E
5|$|The F-84 {{nomenclature}} can {{be somewhat}} confusing. The straight-wing F-84A to F-84E and F-84G models were called the Thunderjet. The F-84F Thunderstreak and RF-84F Thunderflash were different airplanes with swept wings. The XF-84H Thunderscreech (not its official name) was an experimental turboprop {{version of the}} F-84F. The F-84F swept wing version was intended to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> variation of the normal Thunderjet {{with only a few}} different parts, so it kept the basic F-84 number. Production delays on the F-84F resulted in another order of the straight-wing version; this was the F-84G.|$|E

5000|$|There {{are three}} primary types of microgrants; one <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> {{sum of money}} (~US$50-500) granted to an {{individual}} to start an income-generating project, another <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> grant (~$2,000-$10,000) to a community for an impact-oriented projects and <b>a</b> third <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> grant to <b>an</b> individual for any cause they see fit.|$|R
5|$|Visual {{differentiation}} {{from the}} fish crow (C. ossifragus) {{is extremely difficult}} and often inaccurate. Nonetheless, differences apart from size do exist. Fish crows {{tend to have more}} slender bills and feet. There may also <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> sharp hook {{at the end of the}} upper bill. Fish crows also appear as if they have shorter legs when walking. More dramatically, when calling, fish crows tend to hunch and fluff their throat feathers.|$|E
5|$|The XF-104 had {{a radical}} wing design. Most {{supersonic}} jets use a swept or delta wing. This allows a reasonable balance between aerodynamic performance, lift, and internal space for fuel and equipment. However {{the most efficient}} shape for high-speed, supersonic flight had been found to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>small,</b> straight, mid-mounted, trapezoidal wing of low aspect ratio and high wing loading. The wing was extremely thin, with a thickness-to-chord ratio of only 3.4%. The leading edges of the wing were so thin (0.016in/0.41mm) and so sharp that they presented a hazard to ground crews, and protective guards had to be installed during ground operations. The thinness of the wings meant that fuel tanks and landing gear had to be contained in the fuselage. The hydraulic actuators driving the ailerons were only one inch (25mm) thick {{to fit into the}} available space and were known as Piccolo actuators because of their resemblance to this musical instrument. The wings had electrically driven leading and trailing edge flaps to increase lift at low speed. The XF-104 did not feature the Boundary Layer Control System of the production aircraft.|$|E

25|$|In other cases, chip {{designers}} only integrate hardware {{using the}} coprocessor mechanism. For example, an image processing engine might <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> ARM7TDMI core {{combined with a}} coprocessor that has specialised operations to support {{a specific set of}} HDTV transcoding primitives.|$|E
25|$|Parties {{reported}} {{a high level}} of uncertainty in LUCF emissions, but in aggregate, there appeared to only <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> difference of 1.7% with and without LUCF. With LUCF, emissions were 11.9billiontonnes, without LUCF, total aggregate emissions were 11.7billiontonnes.|$|E
25|$|Since the Fermi level must be {{identical}} for both bands, {{this means that}} there will <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> surplus {{of the type of}} spin in the band that moved downwards. This effect is a weak form of paramagnetism known as Pauli paramagnetism.|$|E

25|$|Adena {{crops are}} part of the Eastern Agricultural Complex. They grew squash, {{sunflower}} (Helianthus annuus), sumpweed, goosefoot, knotweed, and maygrass. Gourds were grown for containers and rattles. What might <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> bird pen found at one Adena site suggests limited animal domestication, but Adena people are not known for animal husbandry.|$|E
25|$|The {{aerodynamic}} center is the conceptual {{starting point for}} longitudinal stability. The horizontal stabilizer contributes extra stability and this allows {{the center of gravity}} to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> distance aft of the {{aerodynamic center}} without the aircraft reaching neutral stability. The position of the center of gravity at which the aircraft has neutral stability is called the neutral point.|$|E
25|$|In Australia, the {{motoring}} press {{tends to}} distinguish between a light car such as the Daihatsu Charade or early models of the Holden Barina, and slightly larger models such as the Ford Fiesta which is considered to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> car.
