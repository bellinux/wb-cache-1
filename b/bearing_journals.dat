40|$|Abstract. Copper, {{aluminum}} and tin–lead based alloys {{are widely used}} as <b>journal</b> <b>bearing</b> materials in tri-bological applications. Bronze and brass are widely used as <b>journal</b> <b>bearing</b> materials for copper based alloys.

In addition, white metals are widely used as <b>journal</b> <b>bearing</b> materials for tin–lead based alloys. These alloys ensure properties expected from <b>journal</b> <b>bearings.</b> In this study, tribological and mechanical properties of these <b>journal</b> <b>bearings</b> manufactured by metals were investigated.

50|$|The crank {{cheeks were}} used as main <b>bearing</b> <b>journals,</b> and were 7.75 in in diameter.

50|$|This is {{important}} in manufacturing, such as for crankshafts and similar objects, where not only the roundness {{of a number of}} <b>bearing</b> <b>journals</b> must be measured, but also their alignment on an axis.

Such measurements are often performed by the same techniques as for roundness, but also considering the centre position and its relative position along an additional axial direction.|$|E
40|$|This work {{presents}} a sensibility {{analysis for the}} <b>journal</b> <b>bearings</b> of combustion engines mass balancing systems. Applying it, it's possible to improve the <b>journal</b> <b>bearings</b> and avoid possible failures. This analysis consists on studying {{the effects of the}} variation of the <b>journal</b> <b>bearings</b> main parameters (radial clearance, <b>journal</b> <b>bearing</b> diameter and <b>journal</b> <b>bearing</b> length) on the <b>journal</b> <b>bearings</b> operating conditions (minimum film thickness, maximum pressure and power loss). The analysis also includes the comparison and selection of the different metallic materials {{that can be used in}} these <b>journal</b> <b>bearings,</b> as well as the selection of the lubrication system groove suitable for the <b>journal</b> <b>bearings</b> used in this kind of application. This sensibility analysis shows that: increasing the radial clearance, the minimum film thickness increases, the maximum pressure remains approximately the same and the power loss decreases; increasing the <b>journal</b> <b>bearing</b> length, the minimum film thickness and power loss increase and the maximum pressure decreases; increasing the <b>journal</b> <b>bearing</b> diameter, the minimum film thickness and power loss increase and the maximum pressure decreases. At last, it's found that the white metals (Babbitts) are considered the most advantageous and indicated materials for these <b>journal</b> <b>bearings,</b> and that the lubrication system grooves should be circumferential.

By creating texture or micro dimple on a hydrodynamic <b>journal</b> <b>bearing,</b> pressure increases and significant improvement has been achieved in its load carrying capacity, lubricant flow rate, coefficient of friction etc. In a present work numerical analysis has been carried out to determine the effect of using negative spherical surface texture on hydrodynamic <b>journal</b> <b>bearing</b> surface and it is compared with normal <b>journal</b> <b>bearing</b> i. e. <b>journal</b> <b>bearing</b> without texture.

50|$|When {{describing}} a crankshaft design, {{the number of}} main bearings is generally quoted, {{as the number of}} crank pins is determined by the engine configuration. For example, a crankshaft for an inline six engine will be described as three bearing or four bearing depending on its number of main bearings; The crank pins are not counted in this description. Similarly, when speaking of a crankshaft, the journals are the main <b>bearing</b> <b>journals</b> only. The crank pins are not normally called journals although they form the centre shafts of the big end bearings and are therefore journals in the more general sense.|$|E
40|$|A new {{hydrodynamic}} bearing concept, the wave <b>journal</b> <b>bearing,</b> {{is being developed}} because it has better stability characteristics than plain <b>journal</b> <b>bearings</b> while maintaining similar load capacity. An analysis code to predict the steady state and dynamic performance of the wave <b>journal</b> <b>bearing</b> {{is also part of}} the development. To verify numerical predictions and contrast the wave <b>journal</b> <b>bearing's</b> stability characteristics to a plain <b>journal</b> <b>bearing,</b> tests were conducted at NASA Lewis Research Center using an air bearing test rig. Bearing film pressures were measured at 16 ports located around the bearing circumference at the middle of the bearing length. The pressure measurements for both a plain <b>journal</b> <b>bearing</b> and a wave <b>journal</b> <b>bearing</b> compared favorably with numerical predictions. Both bearings were tested with no radial load to determine the speed threshold for self-excited fractional frequency whirl. The plain <b>journal</b> <b>bearing</b> started to whirl immediately upon shaft start-up. The wave journal did not incur self-excited whirl until 800 to 900 rpm as predicted by the analysis. Furthermore, the wave bearing's geometry limited the whirl orbit to less than the bearing's clearance. In contrast, the plain <b>journal</b> <b>bearing</b> did not limit the whirl orbit, causing it to rub...|$|R

50|$|The {{crankshaft}} has {{a linear}} axis about which it rotates, typically with several <b>bearing</b> <b>journals</b> riding on replaceable bearings (the main bearings) {{held in the}} engine block. As the crankshaft undergoes {{a great deal of}} sideways load from each cylinder in a multicylinder engine, it must be supported by several such bearings, not just one at each end. This was a factor in the rise of V8 engines, with their shorter crankshafts, in preference to straight-8 engines. The long crankshafts of the latter suffered from an unacceptable amount of flex when engine designers began using higher compression ratios and higher rotational speeds. High performance engines often have more main bearings than their lower performance cousins for this reason.|$|E

5000|$|A {{crankcase}} {{often has}} {{an opening in}} the bottom to which an oil pan is attached with a gasketed bolted joint. Some crankcase designs fully surround the crank's main <b>bearing</b> <b>journals,</b> whereas many others form only one half, with a bearing cap forming the other. Some crankcase areas require no structural strength from the oil pan itself (in which case the oil pan is typically stamped from sheet steel), whereas other crankcase designs do (in which case the oil pan is a casting in its own right). Both the crankcase and any rigid cast oil pan often have reinforcing ribs cast into them, as well as bosses which are drilled and tapped to receive mounting screws/bolts for various other engine parts.|$|E
50|$|Factory {{machines}} today {{usually have}} lube systems, {{in which a}} central pump serves periodic charges of oil or grease from a reservoir through lube lines to the various lube points in the machine's bearing surfaces, <b>bearing</b> <b>journals,</b> pillow blocks, and so on. The timing and number of such lube cycles {{is controlled by the}} machine's computerized control, such as PLC or CNC, as well as by manual override functions when occasionally needed. This automated process is how all modern CNC machine tools and many other modern factory machines are lubricated. Similar lube systems are also used on nonautomated machines, in which case there is a hand pump that a machine operator is supposed to pump once daily (for machines in constant use) or once weekly. These are called one-shot systems from their chief selling point: one pull on one handle to lube the whole machine, instead of a dozen pumps of an alemite gun or oil can in a dozen different positions around the machine.|$|E

In some aspects it was advanced for its day, particularly in its use of components such as pistons being pre-graded into standardised sizes and marked as such. This avoided the need for costly hand-fitting during assembly and also simplified replacement in service. It {{was one of the first}} mass-production engines to use thin-wall bearings: a steel shell faced with whitemetal bearing material. Rather than re-metalling the <b>bearing</b> <b>journals</b> and hand-scraping a new bearing surface to fit the crankshaft, these bearings were disposable after use. Several replacement bearing shells were expected to be fitted before the crankshaft required re-grinding. Had the tractor been built at Ford, Dagenham as originally intended, it is likely that the engine would still have been designed around the whitemetal bearings that Ford continued with on small car engines throughout the 1950s.|$|E

The 3.0 mm thick flange effectively caused the connecting rods on the left-hand bank of cylinders (forward bank for FWD applications) to move 3.0 mm forward relative to the right-hand bank, but the engine block remained unchanged compared to the odd-fire engine. Since the cylinders center-lines were no longer centralized over the crank pin <b>bearing</b> <b>journals,</b> the connecting rods were re-designed with the big-ends offset from the piston pin ends by 1.5 mm.

[...] To compensate for the shorter stroke the pistons for the 351M have a taller compression height, so that it could use the same connecting rods as the 400. The result of the 351M using the longer 400 connecting rod was a higher connecting rod-to-stroke ratio of 1.88:1 than the 351C and 400's of 1.65:1. [...] Other than pistons and crankshaft the 351M shared all of its major components with the 400, and it also used the large 385 Series style bellhousing.

The SRT4 engine had many improvements, including: stronger crank case webbing, a thicker deck with 11 mm head bolts (vs 10 mm), an oil drain back for the turbo, a cast aluminum structural oil pan, a higher capacity oil pump, a crankshaft of higher hardness steel, improved machining of <b>bearing</b> <b>journals,</b> oil squirters (to cool underside of pistons), eutectic aluminum alloy pistons made specially by Mahle, and forged connecting rods with cracked caps and 9 mm bolts.

The PT Cruiser Turbo engine package differs from the SRT-4 because the intake manifold, turbocharger plumbing and intercooler are different.
