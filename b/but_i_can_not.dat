In {{a statement to the}} Cortes Generales, he said, [...] "I can take Biak-na-Bato, any military man can take it, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> answer that I could crush the rebellion." [...] Desiring to make peace with Aguinaldo, he sent emissaries to Aguinaldo seeking a peaceful settlement. Nothing was accomplished until Pedro A. Paterno, a distinguished lawyer from Manila perhaps wanting a Spanish nobility title, volunteered to act as negotiator. On August 9, 1897, Paterno proposed a peace based on reforms and amnesty to Aguinaldo. In succeeding months, practicing shuttle diplomacy, Paterno traveled back and forth between Manila and Biak-na-Bato carrying proposals and counterproposals. Paterno's efforts led to a peace agreement called the Pact of Biak-na-Bato. This consisted of three documents, the first two being signed on December 14, 1897, and the third being signed on December 15; effectively ending the Republic of Biak-na-Bato.|$|E

All the vast walls are made wholly of these precious stones, worked in, and in and in together in elaborate pattern s and figures, and polished till they glow like great mirrors with the pictured splendors reflected from the dome overhead. And before a statue of one of those dead Medicis reposes a crown that blazes with diamonds and emeralds enough to buy a ship-of-the-line, almost.

500|$|Mendes {{returned}} to Portugal {{ahead of the}} 2001–02 season, joining Primeira Liga club União Leiria on a season-long loan. Reflecting on his time in France, he said [...] "I never hid my desire to return to Portugal, <b>but</b> now <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> say anything more." [...] He made his debut on 11 August 2001 in a 0–0 draw at Braga. Mendes played regularly under the management of José Mourinho prior to his departure to Porto, but fell out of favour under his replacement, Vítor Pontes. He made 16 league appearances for Leiria, helping the club finish 7th in the Primeira Liga, before returning to Strasbourg. Upon his departure, Mendes was critical of the club's president João Bartolomeu, who he believed created instability at the club. [...] "The Union of Leiria is a complicated club at senior management level, especially the president, who sees things where they do not exist and it creates instability in the squad," [...] said Mendes who [...] "leaves great friends in Leiria".|$|R
6000|$|Now it {{does give}} me real pain to speak in this almost unappreciative way of the old masters and their martyrs, because good friends of mine in the ship--friends who do {{thoroughly}} and conscientiously appreciate them and are in every way competent to discriminate between good pictures and inferior ones--have urged me for my own sake not to make public the fact that I lack this appreciation and this critical discrimination myself. I believe that what I have written and may still write about pictures will give them pain, and I am honestly sorry for it. I even promised that I would hide my uncouth sentiments in my own breast. <b>But</b> alas! <b>I</b> never could keep a promise. I do not blame myself for this weakness, because the fault must lie in my physical organization. It is likely that such a very liberal amount of space {{was given to the}} organ which enables me to make promises, that the organ which should enable me to keep them was crowded out. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> grieve not. I like no half-way things. I had rather have one faculty nobly developed than two faculties of mere ordinary capacity. I certainly meant to keep that promise, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> find <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> do it. It is impossible to travel through Italy without speaking of pictures, and <b>can</b> <b>I</b> see them through others' eyes? ...|$|R

It would have been a long time before I could have accommodated myself comfortably with her, after this; and I really don't know, as Paul {{is going to be very}} grand, and these are people of condition, that she would have been quite presentable, and might not have compromised myself.

5000|$|However, The Telegraph's Clive James was {{far less}} enthusiastic. [...] "Some of the Comic Strip’s {{catalogue}} is very good. They did {{a version of the}} Arthur Scargill story as it would have looked if Hollywood had taken it over and cast Al Pacino in the lead. I remember laughing at that. They did a version of The Professionals in which the pair of style-free heroes ran around the entire time with their lips pursed. It was called The Bullshitters. I remember laughing very hard at that. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> already remember <b>not</b> laughing at The Hunt for Tony Blair even once. It made all the standard references to Blair the war criminal as if that was enough. Meanwhile it recreated The 39 Steps and a whole era of British film in which Britain’s short list of stars struggled to be glamorous. Tony Blair, in fact, looked a bit like John Gregson, remembered by dozens of people even today. But even as you admired the fidelity of the stylistics, the show refused to fizz." [...] But John Preston, another Telegraph reviewer appears to have had a more mixed opinion of the production, writing: [...] "I saw the Comic Strip Presents… The Hunt for Tony Blair (Friday, Channel 4), described in another paper as [...] "mercilessly satirical". If that was merciless, then give those thumbscrews an extra turn - <b>I</b> <b>can</b> take it! In fact, just like every other Comic Strip film there’s ever been, it was quite funny in parts, and entirely unfunny in others.|$|R
