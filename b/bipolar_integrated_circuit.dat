40|$|The PCA 9521 is a {{monolithic}} <b>bipolar</b> <b>integrated</b> <b>circuit</b> for bus buffering in applications including I 2 C-bus, SMBus, PMBus, and other systems based on similar principles. The buffer extends the bus load limit by buffering both the SCL and SDA lines. It supports up to 400 pF loads {{on each side}} of the buffer at 400 kHz. Higher capacitance is supported at lower speeds, and lower capacitance at higher speeds up to 1 MHz. The enable function allows sections of the bus to be isolated. Individual parts of the system can be brought on-line successively. This means a controlled start-up using a diverse range of components, operating speeds and loads is easily achieved. Systems employing removable components on a back-plane (for example, telecommunications racks) can use the enable pin and the high-impedance ports on power-down to safely install and remove components in active systems. Bus level translation between a very wide range of bus voltages, from 1. 8 V to 10 V, is supported. This feature provides enormous flexibility in interfacing systems of different technologies. The unique operation of the PCA 9521 provides one of the fastest response times of such bidirectional buffers, ensuring any glitches (common to other buffers) are kept well within the 50 ns I 2 C-bus specification.

Hot insertion logic allows the IC to be plugged into live backplanes without causing data corruption on the bus. The open-collector ready signal (RDY) indicates when the connection has been made. Precharging of the backplane ports minimizes disruptions to the bus during hot insertion. The enable function allows sections of the bus to be isolated.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this work is on robust high speed {{intelligent}} power electronics, i. e. power electronics that provide increased survivability due to the robust nature of the system components. Silicon carbide (SiC), due to its wide bandgap and superior physical properties, is an attractive material for applications in harsh environments especially high temperature electronics applications. An ideal device for these applications is the bipolar junction transistor (BJT). To exploit the full temperature capabilities of SiC, this work entails an exploratory development effort to investigate and create monolithic <b>bipolar</b> <b>integrated</b> <b>circuits</b> (ICs) capable of robust operation at temperatures above 300 °C.

40|$|A {{significant}} reduction in total dose damage is observed when <b>bipolar</b> <b>integrated</b> <b>circuits</b> are irradiated at low temperature. This can be partially explained by the Onsager theory of recombination, which predicts a strong temperature dependence for charge yield under low-field conditions. Reduced damage occurs for biased as well as unbiased devices because the weak fringing field in thick bipolar oxides only affects charge yield near the Si/SiO 2 interface, a relatively {{small fraction of the}} total oxide thickness. Lowering the temperature of bipolar ICs - either continuously, or for time periods when they are exposed to high radiation levels - provides an additional degree of freedom to improve total dose performance of bipolar circuits, particularly in space applications...|$|R
40|$|Total dose {{damage in}} <b>bipolar</b> <b>integrated</b> <b>circuits</b> is {{investigated}} at low temperature, {{along with the}} temperature dependence of the electrical parameters of internal transistors. Bandgap narrowing causes the gain of npn transistors to decrease far more at low temperature compared to pnp transistors, due to the large difference in emitter doping concentration. When irradiations are done at temperatures of - 140 deg C, no damage occurs until devices are warmed to temperatures above - 50 deg C. After warm-up, subsequent cooling shows that damage is then present at low temperature. This {{can be explained by}} the very strong temperature dependence of dispersive transport in the continuous-time-random-walk model for hole transport.

The artwork original which was called "Vorlage" was cut with a scale of about 200 : 1.

This reticle was then further reduced about 10 times by "step and repeat", using a projection microscope, to get a master mask known as the "Originalschablone" whose scale was then 1 : 1. By direct photocopying of the master mask one obtained a working mask which was called the "Arbeitsschablone".

40|$|Single Event Transients (SETs) {{originating}} in linear <b>bipolar</b> <b>integrated</b> <b>circuits</b> {{are known to}} undermine the reliability of electronic systems operating in the radiation environment of space. Ionizing particle radiation produces a variety of SETs in linear bipolar circuits. The {{extent to which these}} SETs threaten system reliability depends on both their shapes (amplitude and width) and their threshold energies. In general, SETs with large amplitudes and widths are the most likely to propagate from a bipolar circuit's output through a subsystem. The danger these SET pose is that, if they become latched in a follow-on circuit, they could cause an erroneous system response. Long-term exposure of linear bipolar circuits to particle radiation produces total ionizing dose (TID) and/or displacement damage dose (DDD) effects that are characterized by a gradual degradation in some of the circuit's electrical parameters. For example, an operational amplifier's gain-bandwidth product is reduced by exposure to ionizing radiation, and it is this reduction that contributes to the distortion of the SET shapes. In this paper, we compare SETs produced in a pristine LM 124 operational amplifier with those produced in one exposed to ionizing radiation for three different operating configurations - voltage follower (VF), inverter with gain (IWG), and non-inverter with gain (NIWG). Each configuration produces a unique set of transient shapes that change following exposure to ionizing radiation. An important finding is that the changes depend on operating configuration; some SETs decrease in amplitude, some remain relatively unchanged, some become narrower and some become broader...|$|R
