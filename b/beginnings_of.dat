5|$|Modern scholar Peter Davies surmises that Eusebius is {{referring}} to the same event as Lactantius, but that he heard of the event through public rumors and knew nothing of the privileged discussion at the emperor's private religion ceremony that Lactantius had access to. Since it was Galerius's army {{that would have been}} purgedDiocletian had left his in Egypt to quell continuing unrestAntiochenes would understandably have believed Galerius to be its instigator. The historian David Woods argues instead that Eusebius and Lactantius are referring to completely different events. Eusebius, according to Woods, describes the <b>beginnings</b> <b>of</b> the army purge in Palestine, while Lactantius describes events at court. Woods asserts that the relevant passage in Eusebius's Chronicon was corrupted in the translation to Latin and that Eusebius's text originally located the <b>beginnings</b> <b>of</b> the army persecution at a fort in Betthorus (El-Lejjun, Jordan).|$|E

40|$|PLATELET FUNCTION TESTS WERE PERFORMED ON FIFTEEN PATIENTS WITH GASTROINTESTINAL CARCINOMA: A) PREOPERATIVELY, B) DURING ANAESTHESIA AND C) 30 MINUTES AND THREE HOURS AFTER THE <b>BEGINNING</b> <b>OF</b> THE OPERATION. THE FOLLOWING TESTS WERE APPLIED: 1. PLATELET COUNT. 2. BLEEDING TIME (MIELKE ET AL 1969). 3. PLATELET ADHESIVENESS TEST (SALZMAN'S METHOD, MODIFIED). 4. PLATELET AGGREGATION BY ADP, COLLAGEN AND ADRENALINE. 5. "ADP RELEASE" FROM PLATELETS BY COLLAGEN. IT WAS FOUND THAT: A) DURING THE ANAESTHESIA PERIOD THE PLATELET ADHESIVENESS, PLATELED AGGREGATION AND ADP-RELEASE WERE SLIGHTLY REDUCED. B) AT 30 MINUTES AFTER THE <b>BEGINNING</b> <b>OF</b> THE OPERATION THE PLATELET AGGREGATION SHOWED A FURTHER SLIGHTREDUCTION AND THE BLEEDING TIME WAS SLIGHTLY PROLONGED. C) THREE HOURS AFTERTHE <b>BEGINNING</b> <b>OF</b> THE OPERATION THE PLETELET AGGREGATION WAS FURTHER REDUCED AND THE BLEEDING TIME WAS FURTHER PROLONGED. THE PROLONGATION OF THE BLEEDING TIME THE REDUCTION OF PLATELET AGGREGATION BY ADP AND THE PROLONGATION OF THE DELAY PERIOD OF THE COLLAGEN-INDUCED AGGREGATION AT 3 HOURS AFTER THE <b>BEGINNING</b> <b>OF</b> THE OPERATION COMPARED TO THE ANAESTHESIA PERIOD WAS STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT. HOWEVER, IN NO ONE CASE THE RESULTS WERE ABNORMALLY LOW. THESE CHANGES OF PLATELET FUNCTION CANNOT CAUSE DISTURBANCES OF THE HAEMOSTATIC MECHANISM. ...|$|R

SEEDS OF ALYSSUM AKAMASICUM, FERULAGO CYPRIA, ORIGANUM CORDIFOLIUM, PHLOMIS CYPRIA AND PHLOMIS BREVIBRACTEATA MATURE IN THE END OF SUMMER WHILE DISPERSAL TAKES PLACE MOSTLY AFTER THE <b>BEGINNING</b> <b>OF</b> THE RAINY SEASON, IN THE MIDDLE OF AUTUMN (BRADYCHORY). THE DISPERSAL MECHANISM IS OMBROHYDROCHORY. SEED GERMINATION IS FAVOURED BY RELATIVELY LOW TEMPERATURES. THE COMBINATION OF BRADYCHORY, OMBROHYDROCHORY, AND GERMINATION IN LOW TEMPERATURES IS BENEFICIAL BECAUSE THE SEEDS ARE PROTECTED INSIDE THE REPRODUCTIVE STRUCTURES AND ARE EXPOSED ON THE SOIL AT THE MOST APPROPRIATE PERIOD, AS FAR AS GERMINATION AND SEEDLING ESTABLISHMENTARE CONCERNED.

5|$|A musical {{instrument}} is an instrument created or adapted to make musical sounds. In principle, any object that produces sound {{can be considered}} a {{musical instrument}}—it is through purpose that the object becomes a musical instrument. The history of musical instruments dates to the <b>beginnings</b> <b>of</b> human culture. Early musical instruments may have been used for ritual, such as a trumpet to signal success on the hunt, or a drum in a religious ceremony. Cultures eventually developed composition and performance of melodies for entertainment. Musical instruments evolved in step with changing applications.|$|E
5|$|Accompanying the {{widespread}} printing of paper money was the <b>beginnings</b> <b>of</b> {{what one might}} term an early Chinese industrial revolution. For example, the historian Robert Hartwell has estimated that per capita iron output rose sixfold between 806 and 1078, such that, by 1078 China was producing 127000000kg (125,000t) in weight of iron per year. However, historian Donald Wagner questions Hartwell's method used to estimate these figures (i.e. by using Song tax and quota receipts).|$|E
