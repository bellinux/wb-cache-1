40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} crustal {{structure in the}} southwestern United States using different geophysical techniques. Surface wave analysis of paths in the SBR, CP, RGR, SRM and GP were conducted. The Moho of TUC-EPT path in the SBR is estimated at 30 km with upper mantle velocity of 7. 85 km/sec. The Moho for the TUC-ALQ path is estimated between 29 - 34 km with upper mantle velocity of 4. 2 km/sec. This path passes through SBR, CP and RGR. The Moho for the GOL-ALQ path in the SRM and RGR is estimated between 40 - 45 km with upper mantle velocity of 7. 9 km/sec. The Moho for ALQ-EPT path in the RGR is estimated between 32 - 37 km/sec showing thinning in crust toward the south. Crustal structure between EPT-JCT shows a gradual increase in velocity over the crust with the Moho estimated at 39 - 44 km depth, reflecting mostly the stable craton of the GP. The path between ALQ-LUB shows higher velocities in the lower crust of 4. 0 km/sec with the Moho estimated at 37 - 42 km depth {{which is similar to}} EPT-JCT, showing the more stable craton of the GP. ^ Shear wave velocities for the GOL-DAL-LUB path derived from the inversion are 3. 2 km/sec for the upper crust (17 km thick), 3. 9 km/sec for the lower crust (25 km thick), and 4. 1 km/sec for the uppermost mantle. Crustal structure for the path LUB-GOL-RCD path derived from the inversion shows a gradual increase of velocity with the Moho estimated at a depth of 42 - 47 km. Receiver function analysis was conducted for the Lajitas seismic station for all three <b>back</b> <b>azimuths,</b> NW, SE and SW. Moho depth is estimated at 34 - 36 km with shear wave velocities of 4. 2 km/sec in the uppermost mantle for all <b>back</b> <b>azimuths.</b> These results suggest that the RGR extends south, but its effect is minimized compared to the El Paso area. Receiver function results from the ANMO seismic station for all three <b>back</b> <b>azimuths</b> SW, SE and NW show the Moho at a depth of 36 km. ^ Analysis of three seismic lines in southern New Mexico show a Moho depth of 30 - 32 km with velocity of 7. 6 [...] 7. 7 km/sec Gravity database for the US was complied and bad, duplicate, redundant, erroneous points were removed from the dataset.

30|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to develop an {{improved}} method using infrasound observations at multiple seismoacoustic arrays for locating small-magnitude surface explosions at regional distances and to apply the method to ground-truth blasting events for validation. The location method is based on a nonlinear grid search using the travel times and <b>back</b> <b>azimuths</b> of infrasonic signals generated from the surface explosions and on seismic parameters that are independently determined by routine seismic monitoring systems. Specifically, the method utilizes wind-corrected infrasonic azimuths in grid searching to constrain the grids according to nearness to feasibly real observations. Ground-truth events were recorded by a seismo-acoustic station temporarily operated inside an open-pit mine and then used to investigate the improvement by the location method. The method improved the locating of ground-truth events by approximately 50 % compared to the seismic location results.|$|R

30|$|To corroborate {{the claim}} that our phase shifts are {{essentially}} caused by noise directivity, we propose a synthetic test with a homogeneous medium (constant phase speed of 2.45  km/s at 2 -s period). Using the work of Weaver et al. (2009) and Froment et al. (2010), we estimate the theoretical phase shifts predicted by a given azimuthal distribution of the noise energy (ADNE). We find that a simple synthetic ADNE made of two Gaussian functions centered at 150 ° and 300 ° (the principal <b>back</b> <b>azimuths</b> of the noise directivity observed in Figure  3) reproduces the main features (sinusoidal shape and amplitudes) of the phase shifts measured on real data. Because the synthetic medium is homogeneous, these phase variations can be attributed unambiguously to the noise directivity. Interestingly, {{as soon as the}} ADNE contains an isotropic component, however small (even 0.01 % of the dominant arrival), the phase shifts become negligible. This confirms the main conclusion of Weaver et al. (2009) and implies that a complete lack of coherent isotropic noise strengthens our observed phase variations.|$|R
40|$|We {{conducted}} a small-aperture seismic array observation at Suwanose-jima volcano {{for the period}} from 1 October to 18 November 2010. The seismic array consists of 13 elements of short-period seismometers and 5 data loggers. We perform array analysis for continuous seismic records observed during this period to investigate the wave-field properties of several episodes of volcanic tremors and 30 explosion earthquakes. Averages of the slowness values and <b>back</b> <b>azimuths</b> of volcanic tremors {{are estimated to be}} 0. 8 - 1. 4 s/km and 0 °- 40 °, respectively. This suggests that the tremor wave consists of body and surface waves that propagate from the active crater. The array analyses and particle motions of explosion earthquakes indicate that the initial parts of the waveforms of explosion earthquakes are S waves that come {{from the direction of the}} active crater. The slowness values of the S waves of the explosion earthquakes are 0. 3 - 0. 5 s/km. Variation of the slowness value reflects the depth change of the explosion sources...|$|R

The array record between February and September 2011 included explosion earthquakes and episodes of weak continuous tremor during eruption periods. We estimated slownesses and <b>back</b> <b>azimuths</b> of seismic waves on a sliding 1 -min window using the semblance method. The slownesses of the weak continuous tremor clustered within the range 0.2 – 0.8 s/km, consistent with a mix of body and surface waves. A probabilistic approach based on a grid search was used to estimate the source locations of the explosion earthquakes and weak continuous tremor. The sources of the explosion earthquakes were beneath the crater at depths of − 0.5 – 1 km above sea level, while the source of the weak continuous tremor was beneath the northern part of Shinmoedake at depths between 1 km below sea level and 1 km above sea level. This latter region corresponds to a shallow low-resistivity layer, suggesting that hydrothermal processes are more plausible than magmatic processes as the generating mechanism of the weak continuous tremor.|$|R

The results are compared with the slowness and <b>back</b> <b>azimuth</b> computed from the source location obtained by the analysis of data recorded by the Pacific Northwest seismic network (PNSN). This comparison has allowed a quantification of the errors associated with the estimation of slowness and <b>back</b> <b>azimuth</b> obtained through the analysis of array data. The statistical analysis gives σBP 10 ° and σBS 8 ° as standard deviations for the <b>back</b> <b>azimuth</b> and σSP 0 : 021 sec= km and σSS 0 : 033 sec =km for the slowness results of the P and S phases, respectively. These values are consistent with the theoretical relationship between slowness and <b>back</b> <b>azimuth</b> and their uncertainties. We have tested a probabilistic source location method on the local earthquakes based {{on the use of the}} slowness estimated for two or three arrays without taking into account travel-time information. Then we applied the probabilistic method to the deep, nonvolcanic tremor recorded by the arrays during July 2004. The results of the tremor location using the probabilistic method are in good agreement with those obtained by other techniques. The wide depth range, of between 10 and 70 km, and the source migration with time are evident in our results.

30|$|Stress {{inversion}} {{was applied}} to focal mechanisms at depths ranging from 50 to 80 km, leading to an acceptable misfit (∼ 47 °). The misfit level shows that a small level of heterogeneity {{is present in the}} stress regime that might be caused by pre-existing faults of different orientation. The value of R is 0.45, suggesting that the stress regime is triaxial. The best stress model has a maximum compression σ 1 trending 231 ° and is almost normal to the slab (dip ∼ 57 °), while the minimum compression σ 3 dips at 33 ° (Fig. 3). The minimum compression appears to be steeper than the slab if we accept a slab dip of around ∼ 30 °, as suggested by Papazachos et al. (2000) or ∼ 21 °, as reported by Suckale et al. (2009) (determined by backscattered P- and backscattered Sh-waves). The σ 3 axis follows the slab if we accept a slab dip of ∼ 34 ° (apparent only on the S-mode images of the northern <b>back</b> <b>azimuths</b> in the Suckale et al. (2009) study). The dipping directions of the σ 1 and σ 3 axes suggest that the slab plane is under extension. If the σ 3 axis is steeper than the slab, a component of slab-pull force is unbalanced by the subduction resistance. This unbalanced slab-pull force has been described by Scholz and Campos (1995) as the trench suction force, which contributes to the seismic decoupling at the plate interface. If we accept a σ 3 axis along the slab, then no suction force is required.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This is {{the first}} paper in a three-part series that {{examines}} formal inversion of the teleseismic P wave coda for discontinuous variations in elastic properties beneath dense, threecomponent, seismic arrays. In this paper, we develop the theoretical framework for a migration method that draws upon the tenets of inverse scattering theory and is amenable to practical implementation. The forward problem is formulated for two-dimensional (2 -D) heterogeneity in observance of formal sampling requirements and currently accessible instrumentation. A ray theoretic Green’s function, corresponding to a line source with axial component of forcing, is employed within the 2 -D Born approximation to accommodate planar, incident wave fields at arbitrary <b>back</b> <b>azimuths.</b> Both the forward scattered response generated by the upgoing incident wave field and the backscattered response created by its reflection at the free surface are included within the formulation. In accordance with the high-frequency and single-scattering approximations employed in the forward problem the inverse problem is cast as a generalized Radon transform. The resulting back projection operator is well suited to the teleseismic context in several respects. It is tolerant of irregularities in array geometry and source distribution and allows {{a full complement of}} global seismicity to be utilized through its accommodation of oblique incidence. By permitting both independent and simultaneous treatment of different scattering modes (reflections, transmissions, conversions) the inversion formula facilitates a direct appraisal of individual mode contributions to the recovery of structure. In particular, it becomes evident that incorporation of backscattered modes leads to (1) a better localization of structure than possible using forward scattered energy and (2) the imposition of complementary constraints on elastic properties. 1...|$|R
40|$|A {{feasibility}} {{study to determine}} range and back-azimuth detection methods for an isolated generator powering common loads was completed. The study deployed 3 -component E and B field sensors with sampling rates of 100 kHz in a low noise test location in Southern California. Scripted power and load cycling was recorded at ranges of 40 meters to 4 km from the generator/load source. Three loads were tested: a 100 meter string of lights, an inverter powering an air blower, and a resistive heater. No E-field or B-field radiated signals were detected at ranges greater than 40 meters with a signal-to-noise ratio greater than one. Large variations in the broadband background electromagnetic noise were observed {{and may have been}} responsible for null detections at some measurement locations. At the 40 -meter station, a frequency shift upon generator loading was observed for all load types. Harmonics from the detuned generator (operating at 56. 7 Hz) could be observed for all load types but were most pronounced for the inverter source. A back-azimuth estimation methodology was applied to detected harmonics with stable and consistent results. For the inverter source, consistent <b>back</b> <b>azimuths</b> to the source were determined for the fundamental and higher detected harmonics up to the 31 st. The method was applied to narrow band ''noise'' at 60 Hz and produced bimodal directions that roughly pointed to large population centers. Details of the method are withheld in this report pending a record of invention submittal. Although the generator/load combinations, which utilized wiring that tended to minimize stray signals, cannot yet be detected at large stand-off range without application of noise-filtering methods, the back-azimuth method appears promising and should be applied to other source types and frequency ranges where an E and B field can be detected.

40|$|Preliminary {{analysis}} of deep tremor recorded during July, 2004, in the Cascadia Subduction zone {{shows that the}} use of small aperture arrays can resolve the slowness and <b>back</b> <b>azimuth</b> of seismic waves with a useful resolution. Data were collected by three dense arrays of short-period seismometers specifically deployed in the Puget Sound area under an US-Italy-Canada cooperative effort. Slowness analyses at the three arrays indicate that the 2 - 4 Hz tremor wave-field is composed by waves propagating with apparent velocities higher than 4 km/s. Combining this with polarisation analysis show these waves to be transverse (SH) waves. However, P-waves, though smaller in amplitude, can be detected by different slowness values obtained for the radial and transverse components.

40|$|We study seismic noise {{recorded}} in the northeast of the Netherlands by beamforming and by using empirical Green’s functions obtained by seismic interferometry. From beamforming we found differences in noise directions in different frequency bands. The main source region for primary microseisms (0. 05 – 0. 08 Hz) is in the west-northwest direction, while the secondary microseisms (0. 1 – 0. 14 Hz) have a west-southwest <b>back</b> <b>azimuth.</b> Furthermore, we observed a fast (4 km/s) arrival corresponding to the Rayleigh wave overtone.

We measured phase velocity dispersion curves from both beamforming and noise cross-correlations, as well as group velocity from the latter.

40|$|The {{main goal}} of the thesis is to {{characterize}} the attributes of conventional and unconventional reservoirs through passive seismicity. The dissertation is comprised of the development and applications of three new methods, each of which focuses on a different aspect of fractures/faults and the resulting seismicity. In general, the thesis work discusses reservoir characterization from two aspects: 1) understanding fractures and faults in reservoirs as seismic sources with induced seismicity, and then inferring other properties of the reservoirs, such as stress regime and velocity structure (Chapters 2, 3, 4); 2) understanding the fractures in reservoirs as seismic scatterers (Chapter 5). First, I introduce a new method to determine the source mechanisms of the induced earthquakes by incorporating high frequency waveform matching, first P-arrival polarities and average S/P amplitude ratios. The method is applied to 40 induced earthquakes from an oil/gas field in Oman monitored by a sparse near-surface seismic network and a deep borehole seismic network. The majority of the events have a strike direction parallel with the major NE-SW faults in the region, and some events trend parallel with the NW-SE conjugate faults. The {{results are consistent with}} the in-situ well breakout measurements and the current knowledge of the stress direction of this region. The source mechanisms of the studied events together with the hypocenter distribution indicate that the microearthquakes are caused by the reactivation of preexisting faults. Then I introduce a new method to locate microseismic events induced by hydraulic fracturing with simultaneous anisotropic velocity inversion using differential arrival times and differential <b>back</b> <b>azimuths.</b> We derive analytical sensitivities for the elastic moduli (Cij) and layer thickness L for the anisotropic velocity inversion. The method is then applied to a microseismic dataset monitoring a Middle Bakken completion in the Beaver Lodge area of North Dakota. Our results show: 1) moderate-to-strong anisotropy exists in all studied sedimentary layers, especially in both the Upper Bakken and Lower Bakken shale formations, where the Thomsen parameters (E and y) can be over 40 %; 2) all events selected for high signal-to-noise ratio and used for the joint velocity inversion are located in the Bakken and overlying Lodgepole formations, i. e., no strong events are located in the Three Forks formation below the Bakken; 3) {{more than half of the}} strong events are in two clusters at about 100 and 150 meters above the Middle Bakken. Re-occurrence of strong, closely clustered events suggests activation of natural fractures or faults in the Lodgepole formation. Finally, I introduce a new hybrid method to model the shear (SH) wave scattering from arbitrarily shaped fractures embedded in a heterogeneous medium by coupling the boundary element method (BEM) and the finite difference method (FDM) in the frequency domain. The hybrid method can calculate scattering from arbitrarily shaped fractures very rapidly, thus Monte Carlo simulations for characterizing the statistics of fracture attributes can be performed efficiently. The advantages of the hybrid method are demonstrated by modeling waves scattered from tilted fractures embedded in complex media. Interesting behaviors of the scattered waves, such as frequency shift with the scattering order and coherent pattern of scattered waves through strong heterogeneities, are observed. This method can be used to analyze and interpret the scattered coda waves in the microseismic observations, e. g., the reverberating multiples in the Bakken microseismic data which cannot be explained by the determined layered anisotropic velocity model alone. by Junlun Li.

40|$|During the {{outburst}} {{flood of}} a glacier-dammed lake on Gornergletscher, Switzerland, in July 2004, the drained lake water triggered anomalous glacier motion. At {{the onset of}} the outburst, the ice-flow direction {{in the vicinity of the}} lake became closer to the central flowline. When the lake discharge magnitude decreased, the flow direction altered such that the ice moved <b>back</b> to the <b>azimuth</b> of the initial motion. At one of the survey points, where the ice flows parallel to the central flowline, the ice accelerated along the pre-event flow direction followed by a 180 ° backward motion that lasted over 2 days. These observations indicate the impact of the lake outburst on the subglacial and englacial stress conditions; however, the reversal in the flow direction is difficult to explain by drawing on our current understanding of glacier mechanics. The timing and the timescale of the flow-direction changes suggest that the elastic glacier motion and its rebound played a role under the rapidly changing stress conditions, but the Young’s modulus of ice is too large to cause the observed ice motion. Other processes, including basal separation and subglacial sediment deformation, are discussed as possible mechanisms for the reversal of the ice motion...|$|R
40|$|High {{frequency}} ice flow measurements during speed-up {{events in}} Gornergletscher, Switzerland, revealed intriguing ice motion {{which has never}} been reported in detail before. During the summer 2005, more than a 100 % flow speed increase was observed three times at four GPS stations installed across Gornergletscher. The speed-ups were accompanied by a decimeter scale surface uplift. Two of the events were triggered by intensive surface melt and rainfall, while the third one {{was due to the}} outburst of Gornersee, a glacier-dammed lake located 2 km upglacier. An interesting observation was ice motion deviating toward the side margins during the events. As the glacier accelerated, a transverse (cross glacier) velocity component was generated, turning the flow direction away from the central flow line toward the margins. When the glacier decelerated, the transverse velocity component reversed so that the ice flowed <b>back</b> to the <b>azimuth</b> of the initial flow direction. In the most significant case, the trajectory of the survey stake deviated from the original track by 0. 2 m in the transverse direction. We hypothesize that the observed lateral ice motion was caused by locally elevated subglacial water pressure. When the ice sole decoupled from the bed at a part of the glacier, a point source of vertical displacement was transmitted to the surface through viscous ice. This caused the transverse as well as vertical surface motion, as observed in ground motion during magma intrusion. The hypothesis was tested with a two-dimensional ice flow model applied to the transverse glacier cross section. The model confirmed that the surface ice would move toward the margins as observed in Gornergletscher, if subglacial water pressure exceeded the ice overburden pressure over a limited part of the bed...|$|R

40|$|Understanding {{the nature}} of the crust has long been a goal for seismologists when imaging the Earth. This is {{particularly}} true in volcanic regions where imaging melt storage and migration can have important implications for the size and nature of an eruption. Receiver functions and the H-κ stacking (Hκ) technique are often used to constrain crustal thickness (H) and the ratio of P to S wave velocities (κ). In this paper, I show that it is essential to consider anisotropy when performing Hκ. I show that in a medium with horizontally transverse isotropy a strong variation in κ with <b>back</b> <b>azimuth</b> is present, which characterizes the anisotropic medium. In a vertically transverse isotropic medium, no variation in κ with <b>back</b> <b>azimuth</b> is observed, but κ is increased across all back azimuths. Thus, estimates of κ are more difficult to relate to composition than previously thought. I extend these models to melt-induced anisotropy and show that similar patterns are observed, but with more significant variations and increases in κ. Based on these observations, I develop a new anisotropic H-κ stacking technique which inverts Hκ data for melt fraction, aspect ratio, and orientation of melt inclusions. I apply this to data for the Afar Depression and show that melt is stored in interconnected stacked sills in the lower crust, which likely supply the recent volcanic eruptions and dike intrusions. This new technique can be applied to any anisotropic medium where it can provide constraints on the average crustal anisotropy...|$|E
30|$|To {{estimate}} the spatial {{origin of the}} seismic noise over the whole period range of interest, we apply a classical beamforming technique (e.g., Rost and Thomas 2002) to the local monitoring network and the small aperture arrays. This technique allows us to determine the dominant <b>back</b> <b>azimuth</b> and phase velocity of an incoming seismic wave, {{so long as the}} network's station spacing is less than half the wavelength. By applying the method on a sliding window, we can {{estimate the}} directivity and phase velocity of the noise as a function of time. The longer the period of the noise to be processed, the wider the array must be.|$|E
40|$|We analyze eruptive tremor {{during one}} of the largest effusive eruptions in {{historical}} times in Iceland (2014 / 2015 Holuhraun eruption). Seismic array recordings are compared with effusion rates deduced from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer recordings and ground video monitoring data and lead to the identification of three coexisting eruptive tremor sources. This contrasts other tremor studies that generally link eruptive tremor to only one source usually associated with the vent. The three sources are (i) a source that is stable in <b>back</b> <b>azimuth</b> and shows bursts with ramp-like decrease in amplitude {{at the beginning of the}} eruption: we link it to a process below the open vents where the bursts correlate with the opening of new vents and temporary increases in the lava fountaining height; (ii) a source moving by a few degrees per month while the tremor amplitude suddenly increases and decreases: <b>back</b> <b>azimuth</b> and slowness correlate with the growing margins of the lava flow field, whilst new contact with a river led to fast increases of the tremor amplitude; and (iii) a source moving by up to 25 ∘ southward in 4 days that cannot be related to any observed surface activity and might be linked to intrusions. We therefore suggest that eruptive tremor amplitudes/energies are used with caution when estimating eruptive volumes, effusion rates, or the eruption explosivity as multiple sources can coexist during the eruption phase. Our results suggest that arrays can monitor both the growth of a lava flow field and the activity in the vents...|$|E
40|$|Island (Antarctica), {{recorded}} {{during three}} Antarctic summers (1994 - 1995, 1995 - 1996 and 1996 - 1997), are analyzed using a dense small-aperture (500 m) seismic array. The visual and spectral classification of the seismic events shows {{the existence of}} long-period and hybrid isolated seismic events, and of low-frequency, quasi-monochromatic and spasmodic continuous tremors, All spectra have the highest amplitudes in the frequency band between 1 and 4 Hz, while hybrids and spasmodic tremors have also significant amplitudes in the high-frequency band (4 - 10 Hz). The array analysis indicates that almost all the well-correlated low-frequency signals share similar array parameters (slowness and <b>back</b> <b>azimuth)</b> and have the same source area, close to the array site. The polarization analysis shows that phases at high-frequency are mostly composed of P waves, and those phases dominated by low frequencies {{can be interpreted as}} surface waves. No clear shear waves are evidenced. From the energy evaluation, we have found that the reduced displacement values for surface and body waves are confined in a narrow interval. Volcano-tectonic seismicity is located close to the array, at a depth shallower than 1 km. The wave-field properties of the seismovolcanic signals allow us to assume a unique source model, a shallow resonating fluid-filled crack system at a depth of some hundreds of meters. All of the seismic activity is interpreted as the response of a reasonably stable stationary geothermal process. The differences observed in the <b>back</b> <b>azimuth</b> between low and high frequencies are a near-field effect. A few episodes of the degassification process in an open conduit were observed and modeled with a simple organ pipe...|$|E
30|$|As {{described}} in Section 4, {{the means of}} the apparent slownesses and back azimuths for P waves of the explosion earthquakes were 0.3 s/km and 260 °, respectively, which we used to locate their sources. As shown in Section 5, the apparent slownesses and back azimuths of tremor corresponded to a mix of body and surface waves. It is difficult to discriminate phases of tremor for assigning wave types to the estimated apparent slowness. We assumed an apparent slowness of 0.4 s/km, corresponding to S waves, which is comparable to the slowness of 0.35 – 0.39 s/km for S waves from the explosion earthquakes (Fig. 3). We adopted the <b>back</b> <b>azimuth</b> of 265 ° for locating the source of the tremor.|$|E
