5|$|Despite these differences, {{the leading}} causes {{of death in the}} United States are remarkably similar for men and women, headed <b>by</b> <b>heart</b> disease, which {{accounts}} for a quarter of all deaths, followed by cancer, lung disease and stroke.

When it was only an inch or so away he still couldn't read it, and had to fish for a magnifying glass in his pocket to make the typing visible to him. It was an agonizing moment.|$|E

5|$|In an interview, Auerbach {{confessed that}} he lost {{interest}} in big-time managing in the early 1990s, preferring {{to stay in the}} background and concentrating on his pastimes, racquetball and his beloved cigar-smoking. He would, however, stay on with the Celtics as president until 1997, as vice chairman until 2001, and then became president again, a position he held until his death, although in his final years, he was weakened <b>by</b> <b>heart</b> problems and often used a wheelchair.|$|E
5|$|In the 2001 National Institute of Statistics census, El Hatillo Municipality had 54,225 inhabitants, but {{demographics}} show {{a rapidly}} rising population. With the progressive demographic increase, El Hatillo's population {{is no longer}} exclusive to any particular ethnic group.

5|$|Other strong quakes {{occurred}} on January 26, 1700 (estimated at 9magnitude), December 14, 1872 (7.3 or 7.4), April 13, 1949 (7.1), and April 29, 1965 (6.5). The 1965 quake caused three deaths in Seattle directly {{and one more}} <b>by</b> <b>heart</b> failure. Although the Seattle Fault passes {{just south of the}} city center, neither it nor the Cascadia subduction zone has caused an earthquake since the city's founding. The Cascadia subduction zone poses the threat of an earthquake of magnitude 9.0 or greater, capable of seriously damaging the city and collapsing many buildings, especially in zones built on fill.|$|E
5|$|In {{the remote}} Klondike, {{there was great}} demand for news and contact with the world outside. During {{the first months of}} the stampede in 1897, it was said that no news was too old to be read. In the lack of newspapers, some prospectors would read can labels until they knew them <b>by</b> <b>heart.</b> The {{following}} year, two teams fought their way over the passes to reach Dawson City first, complete with printing-presses, with the aim of gaining control of the newspaper market. Gene Kelly, the editor of the Klondike Nugget arrived first, but without his equipment, and it was the team behind the Midnight Sun who produced the first daily newspaper in Dawson. The Dawson Miner followed shortly after, bringing the number of daily newspapers in the town during the gold rush up to three. The Nugget sold for $24 ($680) as an annual subscription, and became well known for championing popular causes associated with miners and for its lucid coverage of scandals. Paper was often hard to find and during the winter of 1898–99, the Nugget had to be printed on butcher's wrapping paper. In the lack of paper, news could be told. In June, 1898, a prospector bought an edition of the Seattle Post-Intellinger at an auction and charged spectators a dollar each to have it read aloud in one of Dawson's halls.|$|E
