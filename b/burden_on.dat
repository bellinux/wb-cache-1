5|$|Another {{factor was}} the weather within the {{operational}} theater. The cyclical monsoon patterns {{meant that the}} weather was deplorable for flight operations eight {{months of the year}} (from late September to early May) when rain and fog tended to conceal targets. Lack of adequate all-weather and night-bombing capability made it necessary for the majority of U.S. missions to be conducted during daylight hours, thereby easing the <b>burden</b> <b>on</b> the air defense forces of North Vietnam.|$|E
3000|$|The ITEP {{analysis}} {{indicates a}} very strong positive correlation between the <b>burdens</b> <b>on</b> adjacent segments of the income distribution. The correlation between the <b>burdens</b> <b>on</b> the top 5 percent and the next 15 percent is [...]. 92. This strong correlation means that higher <b>burdens</b> <b>on</b> the next 15 percent in some states than others are not an indication of greater tax regressivity {{at the top of}} the income distribution. Hence, the revenue-dampening effect of higher <b>burdens</b> <b>on</b> the next 15 percent cannot be interpreted as an effect of regressivity on tax volatility. We suspect that the result is related to the very weak correlation between next- 15 burdens and changes in AGI.|$|R

5|$|Experience {{from the}} few cities where {{congestion}} pricing has been implemented shows that {{social and political}} acceptability is key. Public discontent with congestion pricing, or rejection of congestion pricing proposals, is due mainly to the inequality issues, the economic <b>burden</b> <b>on</b> neighboring communities, the effect on retail businesses and the economic activity in general, and the fears that the revenues will become just another tax.|$|E

5|$|As a {{consequence}} of the overall allied strategy of Vietnamization and with the Australian government keen to reduce its own commitment to the war, 8 RAR was not replaced {{at the end of its}} tour of duty in December 1970. 1 ATF was again reduced to just two infantry battalions, albeit with significant armour, artillery and aviation support remaining. The Australian area of operations (AO) remained the same however, with the reduction in forces only adding further to the <b>burden</b> <b>on</b> the remaining battalions. Regardless, following a sustained effort by 1 ATF in Phuoc Tuy Province between September 1969 and April 1970, the bulk of communist forces had become inactive and had left the province to recuperate.|$|E
