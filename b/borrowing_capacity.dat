40|$|This paper {{introduces}} adaptive dynamic <b>capacity</b> <b>borrowing</b> {{strategies for}} wireless networks covering a road. In a F/TDMA-based model, road traffic prediction models {{are used to}} characterise the movement of hot spots, such as traffic jams, and subsequently to predict the teletraffic load offered to the wireless network. A dynamic upper bound on the capacity required to achieve a specified Quality of Service level in the cells is computed. Restricting borrowing to neighbouring cells to avoid excessive re-allocation of <b>capacity,</b> optimal <b>capacity</b> <b>borrowing</b> strategies based on traffic movement and traffic density are given. These strategies can be characterised by a straightforward rule of thumb: <b>borrow</b> <b>capacity</b> from the cell on the steeper side of the traffic peak, that makes our strategy easily implementable. Results of a dynamic simulation under realistic load indicate a significant reduction of call blocking probabilities under our optimal <b>capacity</b> <b>borrowing</b> strategy.

The model is analytically tractable and delivers plausible orders of magnitude for <b>borrowing</b> <b>capacities,</b> and default and trading intensities. We offer simple explanations for several phenomena in the subprime market, such as the prevalence of “teaser rates ” and the clustering of defaults. In our model, the degree of income co-movement among households plays an important role. We find that both non-diversifiable and diversifiable income risks reduce debt capacities, although through quite distinct channels, and that debt capacities and home prices need not be higher when a larger fraction of income risk is diversifiable...|$|R

If all the channel are occupied than the new call is blocked in this system. There are however several dynamic radio-resource management schemes that can be combined with FCA.

If FCA {{is combined}} with spread spectrum, {{the maximum number of}} channels is not fixed in theory, but in practice a maximum limit is applied, since too many calls would cause too high co-channel interference level, causing the quality to be problematic. Spread spectrum allows cell breathing to be applied, by allowing an overloaded cell to <b>borrow</b> <b>capacity</b> (maximum number of simultaneous calls in the cell) from a nearby cell that is sharing the same frequency.|$|R

We build a simple theoretical framework of firms’ investment with credit rationing and real estate collateral. We show that real estate prices affect firms’ <b>borrowing</b> <b>capacities</b> through two channels. An increase in real estate prices raises {{the value of the}} firms’ pledgeable assets and mitigates the agency problem characterizing the creditor-entrepreneur relationship. It simultaneously cuts the expected profit due to the increase in the cost of inputs. While the literature only focuses on the first channel, the identification of the second channel allows for heterogeneous effects of real estate prices on investment across firms. We test our theoretical predictions using a large French database. We do find heterogeneous effects of real estate prices on productive investment depending on the position of the firms in the sectoral distributions of real estate holdings. Our preferred estimates indicate that a 10 % increase in real estate prices causes a 1 % decrease in the investment rate of firms in the first decile of the distribution but a 6 % increase in the investment rate of firms belonging to the last decile...|$|R
40|$|This thesis studies {{about the}} {{patterns}} of debt accumulation {{of the state and}} local governments in the United States, particularly by focusing on how intergovernmental fiscal relations, fiscal institutions, capital market, and electoral mechanisms might potentially influence {{the patterns of}} debt accumulation of the state and local governments. I develop empirical models to show that both fiscal institutions and intergovernmental fiscal relations have significant impacts on the patterns of debt accumulation of the state and local governments. I also discuss that political accountability and well-functioning capital market are important in stabilizing the patterns of debt management of the state and local governments. From the empirical analysis of the patterns of the debt accumulation of the state and local governments, I claim that US fiscal management is unique particularly in that {{there are a variety of}} patterns on how the state governments regulate the fiscal management of themselves and that of their subnational governments. From the empirical results, I suggest a possibility that the state governments sometimes supplement the lack of capacity of local governments in borrowing when some local governments face severer resource constraints in their fiscal decisions as well as are faced with the limitations on <b>borrowing</b> <b>capacities.</b> That is how I claim that the flexibility in the intergovernmental fiscal relationships is one of the advantages of the decentralized fiscal management in the United States. by Hiroshi Shibata.

Exports, minimum tolerable level of imports and foreign exchange rates (or reserves) provide a useful framework for the examination of optimum external borrowing. So, the most widely used quantitative indicator here is the optimum external debt ratios, which is the ratios of debt service to the level of exports of goods and services. As a suggested, indicator of the optimum external debt burden in the medium-term or in the long run, the ratio of external debt to GNP (Gross National Product) or of debt service to GNP may be superior to the ratio of debt service to exports because over time sizeable changes in the level of exports and imports in GNP can occur...|$|R

However, despite its critical function in meeting the requirements of the economy, foreign currency borrowing was also among the main factors triggering and/or deepening the financial crises hindering the development progress of these countries.

40|$|We {{present a}} continuous-time asset pricing {{model of the}} levered firm where {{shareholders}} select not only the timing but also the form of abandonment. Shareholders can {{walk out of the}} firm either by (i) defaulting on their debt obligations or (ii) selling their shares to alternative operators of the technologies, as in a corporation sale. The structural model relates shareholders' ex-post choice to both technological and financial factors. Considering that operators' technological supremacy is not universal, we obtain that whereas default necessarily involves an inefficient timing of ownership transfer, corporation sales do not. Then, the likelihood of default being chosen instead of a corporation sale increases with (i) the degree of leverage displayed by the firm and (ii) its technological supremacy. By ignoring corporation sales, existing defaultable bond pricing models have thus a tendency to exaggerate risk premia and underestimate the <b>borrowing</b> ability (debt <b>capacity)</b> of firms. ...|$|R

In 1542 the president of the Habsburg Council of State, Lodewijk van Schoor, proposed the levy of a number of taxes throughout the Habsburg Netherlands: a Tenth Penny (10 percent tax) on the income from real property and private loans, and excise taxes on beer, wine, and woollen cloth. These permanent taxes, collected by the individual provinces, would enable the provinces to pay enlarged subsidies to the central government, and (by issuing bonds secured by the revenue of these taxes) finance extraordinary levies (beden in old Dutch) in time of war. Other than expected, these reforms strengthened the position of the provinces, especially Holland, because as a condition of agreeing to the reform the States of Holland demanded and got total control of the disbursement of the taxes.|$|E
