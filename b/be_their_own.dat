5|$|The song's lyrics {{describe}} of {{the individual}} power that lies inside every person, their ability to <b>be</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> hero. According to author Carol K. Ingall, the song inspires anyone to be a hero. Ingall continued how due to a hero's power to transform and inspire those around them, so too every person has inside of them the light and force needed to help change the world. Similarly, author Darlene Wade connects the song's lyrical content to the power within the soul, however also with the inclusion of God.|$|E
5|$|While the 1st, 2nd and 4th Ranger Company each {{embarked}} for Korea {{shortly after}} their training was complete, the 3rd Ranger Company was retained at Fort Benning, {{to train the}} next cycle of Rangers along with the 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th Ranger Company. After providing fillers to 1st and 4th companies to cover their training losses, the 3rd had 40 men left. In mid-December, they took an additional 80 men from 7th Company and completed a second cycle of Ranger training. This proved beneficial to the 3rd Company, as it was given cold-weather training alongside the 5th and 8th companies at Fort Carson, Colorado. After the first training cycle was complete; the Ranger units already in Korea had not received this training and were thus unprepared for the Korean winter. The 3rd Company also received additional training which better prepared it for combat, including tactics of the People's Volunteer Army, which the other companies had learned in battle and tracer designation of targets during night attacks. They also received 57mm M18 Recoilless Rifles, however, these were kept on the cargo truck due to the necessity {{to break up a}} rifle team to man a crew-served weapon, which didn't happen. The entire company was trained to <b>be</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> forward observers for artillery. In March 1951, the 3rd, 5th, and 8th Companies sailed for Korea, a trip which was fraught with frequent discipline problems as the Rangers continuously got into fights with U.S. Marines on board the troopship while en route. After spending one night in Kobe, Japan, the next morning they sailed for Pusan, South Korea.|$|E

25|$|Since neutral kaons carry strangeness, they cannot <b>be</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> antiparticles. There must be {{then two}} {{different}} neutral kaons, differing by two units of strangeness. The question was then how {{to establish the}} presence of these two mesons. The solution used a phenomenon called neutral particle oscillations, by which these two kinds of mesons can turn from one into another through the weak interactions, which cause them to decay into pions (see the adjacent figure).|$|E
25|$|Khand (Evil) – Tolkien wrote {{even less}} about Khand {{than he did}} about Harad, though {{we know that the}} only thing implied about them is that the armor they wore covered - {{literally}} - their entire bodies ("Variags who hated the sun"), and that their weapons may <b>be</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> design of Haradrim and Easterling weapons. Games Workshop has based their Variags of Khand on the Mongols and the Japanese, featuring sashimonos and the unique chariots, despite the Easterlings being the only culture in Middle-earth with chariots in Tolkien's writings. It was suggested that the Gondorians were unaware of the lands further east, and thus the names of the Variags and Wainriders had been mixed-up. Khand allies with the Easterlings (and the Haradrim) frequently.|$|E

I {{consider}} the right of human beings to <b>be</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> masters a natural right. A right of which the Jews were deprived by history and which Zionism restored to them. That is its deep meaning. And as such, it is indeed a tremendous revolution that touches the lives of each of us. I felt that revolution when I immigrated to Israel alone at the age of 16. Only then, when I disembarked at Haifa from the ship Artza, did I stop being an object of others' action and became a subject. Only then did I become a person who is in control of himself and not dependent on others.|$|E
25|$|Omniscience is the {{capacity}} to know everything that {{there is to know}} (included in which are all future events), and is a property often attributed to a creator deity. Omniscience implies the existence of destiny. Some authors have claimed that free will cannot coexist with omniscience. One argument asserts that an omniscient creator not only implies destiny but a form of high level predeterminism such as hard theological determinism or predestination – that they have independently fixed all events and outcomes in the universe in advance. In such a case, even if an individual could have influence over their lower level physical system, their choices in regard to this cannot <b>be</b> <b>their</b> <b>own,</b> {{as is the case with}} libertarian free will. Omniscience features as an incompatible-properties argument for the existence of God, known as the argument from free will, and is closely related to other such arguments, for example the incompatibility of omnipotence with a good creator deity (i.e. if a deity knew what they were going to choose, then they are responsible for letting them choose it).|$|E

500|$|Dr. Octagonecologyst {{has been}} praised for its {{original}} sound, which {{has often been}} attributed to Nakamura. However, Thornton states that he was largely involved with {{the production of the}} album. Thornton is quoted as saying [...] "Automator and Kurt are probably receiving more credit than I did, but I was a big musical person behind Octagon." [...] Nakamura has said he wanted Dr. Octagonecologyst to stand out from other hip hop albums, citing the music of Eric B. & Rakim, Mantronix, and Run-D.M.C. as influences. [...] "Hip-hop was always inventive. Then the '90s hit and everyone wants to be Dr. Dre; no one wants to <b>be</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> thing anymore. Everyone now wants to have the Lexus and deal pounds of drugs. We don't do that. That's not our lifestyle. You don't see us coming out with the fur coat.

[...] "I wanted to die," [...] she says, close to tears. Outside the film, Bilheimer said that Angie's trafficker expected her to engage in forty sex acts a night, and threatened to kill her if she refused.

500|$|On 8December the Norwegians passed Shackleton's Farthest South {{record of}} 88°23′.

On the following day, 14December 1911, with the concurrence of his comrades Amundsen travelled {{in front of the}} sledges, and at around 3pm the party reached the vicinity of the South Pole. They planted the Norwegian flag and named the polar plateau [...] "King Haakon VII's Plateau". Amundsen later reflected on the irony of his achievement: [...] "Never has a man achieved a goal so diametrically opposed to his wishes. The area around the North Pole—devil take it—had fascinated me since childhood, and now here I was at the South Pole. Could anything be more crazy?" ...|$|E

In his book A Vision of the Future, Stephan Edward Poe writes that the idea built a foundation for a variety of storylines by providing: [...] "new ways for crew members to learn... to <b>be</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> heroes in self-directed sages, or even use their stories as a safe and acceptable means of released pent-up emotions." ...|$|E
