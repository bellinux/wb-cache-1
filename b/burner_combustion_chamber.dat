It {{is also known as}} a <b>burner,</b> <b>combustion</b> <b>chamber</b> or flame holder. In a gas turbine engine, the combustor or combustion chamber is fed high pressure air by the compression system. The combustor then heats this air at constant pressure. After heating, air passes from the combustor through the nozzle guide vanes to the turbine. In the case of a ramjet or scramjet engines, the air is directly fed to the nozzle.|$|E

In this thesis, advances in the computational ?uid dynamic modeling of moving bodies and combustive ?ows are investigated. Thus, the basic theory behind CFD is being extended to solve a new class of problems that are generally more complex. The ?rst chapter that investigates some of the results, chapter IV, discusses a technique developed to model unsteady aerodynamics with moving boundaries such as ?apping winged ?ight. This will include mesh deformation and ?uid dynamics theory needed to solve such a complex system. Chapter V will examine the numerical modeling of a combustive ?ow. A three dimensional single vane <b>burner</b> <b>combustion</b> <b>chamber</b> is numerically modeled. Species balance equations along with rates of reactions are introduced when modeling combustive ?ows and these expressions are discussed. A reaction mechanism is validated for use with in situ reheat simulations. Chapter VI compares numerical results with a laminar methane ?ame experiment to further investigate the capabilities of CFD to simulate a combustive ?ow. A new method of examining a combustive ?ow is introduced by looking at the solutions ability to satisfy the second law of thermodynamics. All laminar ?ame simulations are found to be in violation of the entropy inequality...|$|E

As such, this phenomenon has contributed to environmental pollution apart from these natural resources are increasingly reduced thus resulting in price increments. However, biodiesel fuel has recognized by many researcher as a potential replacement of fossil fuel. A study was conducted to investigate the performance of alternative energy sources that are environmentally friendly and renewable such as palm biodiesel. Therefore, this project presents an investigation on the combustion performance of Palm Methyl Ester (PME) which also known as Palm Biodiesel in an oil burner system. Several Carotino’s palm biodiesel blends (B 10, B 20, and B 40) also have been made by blended with Conventional Diesel Fuel (CDF). Examination of the fuel properties for each blends including CDF and PME have been carried out. The performance of the fuels have been studied based on its wall temperature profile and gas emissions generated such as nitrogen oxides (NOx) and carbon monoxide (CO). The test fuels have been burned in the oil <b>burner</b> <b>combustion</b> <b>chamber</b> at different equivalent ratios and using three different oil burner nozzles (1. 25, 1. 50 and 1. 75 USgal/h). From the test, PME is the lowest emission production compared to CDF but generate a low temperature. For example, at stoichiometric mixture with nozzle 1. 25 USgal/h, NOx and CO generated by PME decreased of 27 % and 30 % respectively compared to CDF. PME has recorded about 12 % drop in an average temperature compared to the CDF at the same condition. The higher fuel flow rate used, results more heat and emission generated.

50|$|The Doble Detroit {{incorporated}} key ignition, {{doing away}} {{with the need for}} manual ignition of the boiler system. John Doble also constructed a flash boiler with rectangular casing in which atomized kerosene fuel was ignited with a spark plug, in a carburetor-type venturi and used forced draft provided by an electrically driven fan. This rapidly heated the feedwater contained in vertical grids of tubes welded to horizontal headers. The steam-raising part of the boiler was partitioned off by a wall of heat-resisting material jacketed with planished steel from a smaller compartment in which were similar grids of tubes for feedwater heating. There seem to have been at least two versions of this boiler, the first with the <b>burner</b> and <b>combustion</b> <b>chamber</b> at the bottom, the other with them {{at the top of the}} casing; this led to the subsequent counterflow monotube boiler arrangement. Boiler operation was fully electro-mechanically automated: the bottom of the boiler housed a metal tray with a row of quartz rods.

40|$|The NOx {{emissions}} of a 40, 000 BTU/hr (11. 7 kW) natural {{gas water heater}} are studied at different primary equivalence ratios (Φ). CO emission, O 2 content in the flue gas and other related parameters are measured to assess the potential for NOx emission reductions with relatively modest changes in current <b>burner</b> and <b>combustion</b> <b>chamber</b> designs. In addition, N 2 is introduced into the primary fuel and air flow to simulate flue gas recirculation (FGR) in order to estimate what benefit such a strategy might provide. NOx concentration in the exhaust decreases from 84 ppm to 34 ppm (at 3 % dry O 2) when the primary equivalence ratio is decreased from 4. 8 to 1. 3. The flame structure also varies with primary equivalence ratio. When Φ is lower than 2. 1, the flame starts to show a highly unsteady structure, and NOx emissions fluctuate at this range of Φ. However, the observed NOx emissions decrease with a decreasing Φ indicates a potential method of significant NOx reduction in natural gas water heaters if the flame could be stabilized. Introducing 10 standard liters per minute (SLPM) N 2 (15 % of the primary air at Φ= 3) into the primary fuel and air flow further decreases NOx emission levels by 20 % to 29 %, which indicates that flue gas recirculation (FGR) may be a viable method of reducing NOx of natural gas water heaters using on pancake burners...|$|R

40|$|During {{recent years}} the methods of CARS {{spectroscopy}} have been applied to the studies of hydrogen-air and hydrogen-oxygen combustion processes. For accomplishment of spectroscopic gas temperature measurements usually CARS spectra of Q-branches of hydrogen are used in this case [1, 2]. Under the real conditions characterized by high pressures of 10 – 100 atmospheres and high temperatures of 2000 – 3000 K registration of CARS spectra should be accomplishes by knowledge of broadening and shift of the Q-branch lines, mainly perturbed by collisions with water molecules. Previous cell experiments conducted up to 900 K in a binary H 2 -H 2 O mixture show that for the hydrogen Q-branch lines there exists significant broadening and its dependence on temperature and rotational quantum number [3, 4]. In order to obtain line-broadening data for higher temperatures and densities we propose to use a high pressure pulsed H 2 -O 2 <b>burner.</b> The <b>combustion</b> <b>chamber</b> of the <b>burner</b> we used is filled during 30 msec {{with the help of}} pulsed valves by a H 2 /O 2 mixture that is later ignited by a spark plug.

One of them is tuned to selected hydrogen Q-branch rotational component with further investigation of the width and shift of the CARS line by a Fabry-Perot interferometer. Another spectrometer detects water and hydrogen spectra for density and temperature evaluation. In the present work preliminary results on characterization of our pulsed high pressure burner and some measurements of broadening and shift of the Q-branch lines of hydrogen in combustion products of the pulsed burner are given. ...|$|R

And {{it was revealed that}} the fire safety is not specifically regulated from the viewpoint of reaction-to-fire performance, such as fire propagation caused by combustible materials or products installed on the exterior side of fire-resistant load-bearing walls. Actual fire incidents in the world have shown that massive façade fire could occur at the exterior side of building wall even when the wall itself is fire resistant. In previous studies of the authors, a test method of façade fire was proposed for evaluating the vertical fire propagation over an external wall within the same building [1, 2]. Based on these studies, new domestic standard test method was established in Japan as JIS A 1310 : 2015, “Test method for fire propagation over building façades” at the end of January 2015 [3].

40|$|In {{this thesis}} a {{parameter}} {{study of a}} gas turbine burner used in the Siemens Gas Turbine SGT- 800 and SGT- 700 has been performed using computational fluid dynamics. The parameter study was aimed at determining the stability range of the flow field inside the <b>burner</b> and <b>combustion</b> <b>chamber.</b> To perform the study a simplified two dimensional model of the actual burner was developed. The software used for the simulations was Ansys CFX (versions 11. 0 and 12. 0) and the parameter that has been studied is the swirl number which {{can be described as}} a relation between the angular and axial momentum. To change the swirl number scale factors were introduced at the inlet allowing for the velocity profiles to vary. The results showed that the stability range where the flame inside the <b>combustion</b> <b>chamber</b> took the shape of a cone in between the limits of flameback or a rotating jet flame was narrower than assumed from the start. Also the influence of including combustion in the model showed similar results but an even narrower stability range. Besides the parameter study a model has been developed to account for the three dimensional swirling caused by the swirl cone, where forces were applied to force the flow to behave in a certain way. Even though the flow can be mimicked with this approach the fuel distribution in the burner is suffering from some absent three dimensional effect which causes the fuel distribution to be more uniform as compared to simulations made with the axisymmetric model. To validate the simulations the water rig located at Siemens was used where the goal was to examine the radial fuel distribution in five burners. This was done by recording movies of a laser sheet that illuminated water mixed with fluorescence representing fuel. These movies could then be evaluated using MATLAB and comparison to simulations again highlighted the inaccuracy of the fuel distribution in the two-dimensional axisymmetric model. One of the major conclusions of the thesis was that the developed two dimensional axisymmetric model is a valid instrument when performing parameter studies and it is recommended for future studies. When trying to account for the mixing effect of the swirl cone some three dimensional effect is lost and {{in order to be able}} to use the complete model of the whole burner this issue has to be resolved.

Due to the non-premixed nature of the combustion occurring in such engines, non-premixed combustion model of ANSYS FLUENT 14. 5 {{can be used to}} simulate the combustion process. A 4 -stroke diesel engine corresponds to one fuel injector hole without considering valves was modeled and combustion simulation process was studied. Here two types of <b>combustion</b> <b>chambers</b> were compared. <b>Combustion</b> studies of both chambers:- shallow depth and hemispherical <b>combustion</b> <b>chambers</b> were carried out. Emission characteristics of both <b>combustion</b> <b>chambers</b> had also been carried out. The obtained results are compared. It has been found that hemispherical <b>combustion</b> <b>chamber</b> is more efficient as it produces higher pressure and temperature compared to that of shallow depth <b>combustion</b> <b>chamber.</b> As the temperature increases the formation of NOx emissions and soot formation also get increased...|$|R
