5|$|After {{the release}} of Kids Can Say No!, many {{teachers}} who showed the film to their students reported receiving disclosures of abuse. <b>Because</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> teachers said they were unsure of {{how to deal with}} the disclosures, Harris and Skippon collaborated on the 1986 sequel Beyond the Scare. Kids Can Say No! encourages children to report abuse they experience and Beyond the Scare advises teachers about what to do if a child makes such a disclosure.|$|E
5|$|In the Georgian era, Norwich {{became an}} {{increasingly}} popular destination with travellers and {{developed into a}} fashionable shopping town. Buildings around the market were developed into luxury shops and coaching inns. The {{eastern side of the}} market was particularly fashionable and became known as Gentleman's Walk. The area around the market had become very congested by the 19thcentury, but the council was unable to raise funds for improvement and few alterations were made. <b>Because</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> market's stalls were privately owned, the council was unable to rearrange the market into a more rational layout.|$|E

5|$|Ironically, some pure-blooded desert-bred Arabians in Syria had {{enormous}} difficulties being accepted as registrable purebred Arabians <b>because</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bedouin who owned them saw {{no need to}} obtain {{a piece of paper}} to verify the purity of their horses. However, eventually the Syrians developed a stud book for their animals that was accepted by the World Arabian Horse Association (WAHO) in 2007.|$|E
5|$|Leonardo's notes {{appear to}} have been {{intended}} for publication <b>because</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sheets have a form and order that would facilitate this. In many cases a single topic, for example, the heart or the human fetus, is covered in detail in both words and pictures on a single sheet. Why they were not published during Leonardo's lifetime is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Program {{participants}} receive job training, {{are trained}} in culinary arts and attend arts and crafts classes. They are provided with two meals a day, a transportation stipend, life-skills coaching, individual and group therapy, and a bonus upon successful completion of the program. Language classes are offered in Arabic literacy (<b>because</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trainees are illiterate), English, and French. In partnership with Search for Common Ground, the center educates the trainees on subjects such as life planning, empowerment, Nonviolent Communication, and reproductive health. Center staff help participants find employment with outside businesses upon graduation.|$|E
50|$|In Thailand, this {{festival is}} called thetsakan kin che (เทศกาลกินเจ), the Vegetarian Festival.

5|$|Subterranean Jungle is {{the seventh}} studio album by the American punk rock band the Ramones, {{released}} by Sire Records in February 1983. The album appealed to a hardcore punk rock style rather than featuring several pop oriented pieces; {{this is because}} guitarist Johnny Ramone received more leeway with steering the overall genre with his hard rock influenced riffs. The recording sessions saw disputes between band members, mainly <b>because</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> band members were dealing with alcohol addiction, or in bassist Dee Dee Ramone's case, cocaine.|$|E
5|$|The season {{produced}} 16tropical depressions, {{of which}} 14 intensified into tropical storms, 8became hurricanes, and 1became a major hurricane. Although the season {{had the highest}} number of named storms at the time, it featured only two notable storms, primarily <b>because</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tropical cyclones remained either weak or at sea. The two most significant storms of the season, in terms of damage and loss of life, were Hurricane Diana and Tropical Storm Marco. However, the strongest tropical cyclone of the season was Hurricane Gustav.|$|E

5|$|Although minute {{quantities}} of some transuranic elements occur naturally, {{they were all}} first discovered in laboratories. Their production has expanded the periodic table significantly, {{the first of these}} being neptunium, synthesized in 1939. <b>Because</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> transuranic elements are highly unstable and decay quickly, they are challenging to detect and characterize when produced. There have been controversies concerning the acceptance of competing discovery claims for some elements, requiring independent review to determine which party has priority, and hence naming rights. In 2010, a joint Russia–US collaboration at Dubna, Moscow Oblast, Russia, claimed to have synthesized six atoms of tennessine (element 117), making it the most recently claimed discovery. It, along with nihonium (element 113), moscovium (element 115), and oganesson (element 118), are the four most recently named elements, whose names all became official on 28 November 2016.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{architecture}} of English cathedrals is so diverse and inventive, the internal appearances differ a great deal. However, in general, English cathedral interiors tend to give an impression of length. This is in part <b>because</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> buildings are actually very long, but also because {{more than in the}} medieval architecture of any other country, the horizontal direction is given as much visual emphasis as the vertical. This is particularly the case at Wells where, unlike most Gothic buildings, there are no vertical shafts that continue from the arcade to the vault and there is a very strong emphasis on the triforium gallery with its seemingly endless and undifferentiated row of narrow arches. Salisbury has a similar lack of verticals while the course below the triforium and the undecorated capitals of Purbeck stone create strong visual horizontals. In the cases of Winchester, Norwich and Exeter the horizontal effect is created by the emphasis on the ridge rib of the elaborate vaults.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, Clouzot was {{diagnosed}} with tuberculosis and was sent first to Haute-Savoie and then to Switzerland, where he was bedridden for nearly five years in all. Clouzot's time in the sanatorium would be very influential on his career. While bedridden, Clouzot read constantly and learned the mechanics of storytelling to help improve his scripts. Clouzot also studied the fragile nature {{of the other people}} in the sanatorium. Clouzot had little money during this period, and was provided with financial and moral support by his family and friends. By the time Clouzot left the sanatorium and returned to Paris, World War II had broken out. French cinema had changed <b>because</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> producers he had known had fled France to escape Nazism.|$|E

5|$|The {{primary focus}} of the society at this time was simple subsistence. To {{continue}} as a group, they had to focus all of their energies on producing food. This was problematic <b>because</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> members were becoming old and several suffered illnesses. Since the beginning, Beilhart {{and the other members}} had not actively sought out new members, believing that a small group was more viable. This proved to be their undoing as there were no younger members to sustain the farm. The original members, who had stayed with the group since its inception, began to leave and by 1928, only six were left. Financial strains forced them to relinquish the ranch and move to a house in the village of Soquel.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} {{locations where}} bog bodies {{have been discovered}} are the Northern European countries of Germany, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Ireland, and especially Denmark. The oldest of these bodies dates to about 8000 BC, although the majority of specimens in Denmark are from the Pre-Roman Iron Age to Roman Iron Age era (about 500 BC to 400 AD). As of 2006, more than 700ancient {{bodies have been discovered}} in these sites, although other estimates have placed the number in the thousands. It is difficult for scientists to ascertain a precise number <b>because</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bodies have been lost or destroyed. Before archaeologists began actively searching for bog bodies, the bodies were discovered mostly during the routine extraction of peat, and then reburied or discarded. After the discovery that systematic conservation of Iron Age bodies was attributable to the acidic anaerobic environs, major excavations have occurred in Jutland. Other bog bodies recovered on the Jutland peninsula which have undergone as extensive an analysis as the Haraldskær Woman include Tollund Man, Grauballe Man, Elling Woman, Huldremose Woman and the Borremose Woman.|$|E
5|$|The {{series has}} gained a strong {{popularity}} in not only Japan but also throughout the world. For instance, coverage of the anime appeared {{on the front page}} of the Hong Kong free newspaper am730 on May 27, 2013, concerning its popularity within Hong Kong as well as in China and Taiwan. However, the series also attracted criticism: the South Korean Electronic Times magazine accused Attack on Titan of having a militaristic message that serves Japanese Prime Minister Shinzō Abe's political leanings; while the series also resonated with Hong Kong youths who saw the invading Titans as a metaphor for mainland China. Hong Kong media commentator Wong Yeung-tat praised Isayama's style and the versatility of Attack on Titans setting, which opens itself to readers' various interpretations. In 2013, after media linked to a 2010 blog post by Isayama indicating that the design of the character Dot Pixis was based on the Imperial Japanese General Akiyama Yoshifuru, an Internet flame war about the general's war record (e.g. allowing the Port Arthur massacre to occur) ensued on his blog and included death threats to the author. <b>Because</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> threats written in Japanese had grammatical errors, it is believed that they were written by people outside of Japan.|$|E

5|$|To be {{considered}} a dictator novel, a story should have strong political themes drawn from history, a critical examination of the power held by the dictator, the caudillo, and some general reflection {{on the nature of}} authoritarianism. Although some dictator novels centre on one historical dictator (albeit in fictional guise), they do not analyze the economics, politics, and rule of the régime as might a history book. The dictator novel genre includes I, the Supreme (1974), by Augusto Roa Bastos, about Dr. Francia of Paraguay, and The Feast of the Goat (2000), by Mario Vargas Llosa, about Rafael Leónidas Trujillo of the Dominican Republic. Alternatively, the novelist might create a fictional dictator to achieve the same narrative end, as in Reasons of State (1974), by Alejo Carpentier, in which the dictator is a composite man assembled from historical dictators. The genre of the dictator novel has been very influential {{in the development of a}} Latin American literary tradition, <b>because</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> novelists rejected traditional, linear story-telling techniques, and developed narrative styles that blurred the distinctions between reader, narrator, plot, characters, and story. In examining the authority of leadership, the novelists also assessed their own social roles as paternalistic dispensers of wisdom, like that of the caudillo whose régime they challenged in their dictator novels.|$|E
