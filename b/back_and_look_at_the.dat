500|$|American Pharoah's {{pedigree}} includes horses {{adept at}} classic race distances on his sire's side and endowed with speed on his dam's side. Sire [...] the Nile won the Santa Anita Derby and ran {{second in the}} 2009 Kentucky Derby, {{with all of his}} wins at distances of [...] miles or more. Prior to American Pharoah, Pioneerof the Nile had sired five other winners of stakes races of a mile or more in his relatively new career as a stallion. Trainer Bob Baffert observed that Pioneerof the Nile also raced with [...] "a big, long stride" [...] and had [...] "that same springing motion as American Pharoah, whose acceleration is pretty remarkable." [...] He also praised Pioneerof the Nile's dam, Star of Goshen: [...] "She was a freaky filly, really, really fast." [...] To Baffert, American Pharoah's bloodline is a source of fascination: [...] "Every time I work him, I go <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> pedigree, and I go, What is going on here?" ...|$|E

"The {{guy who did}} {{the artwork}} for the first record, Jacob Escobedo, {{came up with that}} concept for the artwork , and in that moment we began talking about retro-futurism: so if you were to go <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> science fiction books {{released}} in the fifties and just how fascinating it is to see what people thought about the future. And for us, that kind of became like a theme. Brian's got all of this ancient gear - synthesisers from the time that synthesisers were being made - and they were incredibly futuristic at that time. And then as we got more into it ... the whole aesthetic started to evolve from there." ...|$|E
2500|$|On the {{television}} show Roger Ebert & the Movies, director Martin Scorsese named Eyes Wide Shut his fourth-favorite film of the 1990s. For the introduction to Michel Ciment's Kubrick: The Definitive Edition, Scorsese wrote: [...] "When Eyes Wide Shut came out {{a few months after}} Stanley Kubrick's death in 1999, it was severely misunderstood, which came as no surprise. If you go <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> contemporary reactions to any Kubrick picture (except the earliest ones), you'll see that all his films were initially misunderstood. Then, after five or ten years came the realization that [...] or Barry Lyndon or The Shining was like nothing else before or since." [...] Mystery writer and commentator Jon Breen agreed. In 2012, Slant Magazine ranked the film as the second greatest of the 1990s. The BBC listed it number 61 in its list of the 100 greatest American films of all time.|$|E

"We were {{surprised}} to {{find it in the}} possession of such men," [...] replied Harnett, with a laugh, [...] "and perhaps also a little surprised to learn that we could have put so much faith in any one of your assertions.

6000|$|He {{let that}} soak in. Then he turned about towards his interlocutor, and toyed with a club ash tray. [...] "It's every day has {{overtaken}} you," [...] he said. [...] "You can't see the wood for the trees. You forget the spacious design you are engaged upon, {{in the heavy}} details of the moment. You are like a painter {{who has been working}} hard upon something very small and exacting in a corner. You want to step <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> whole thing." ...|$|E

60|$|Perhaps the {{greatest}} hardship in being an invalid {{is the fact}} that people come and see you and keep your spirits up. The Honorable Freddie Threepwood suffered extremely from this. His was not a gregarious nature and it fatigued his limited brain powers to have to find conversation for his numerous visitors. All he wanted was to be left alone to read the adventures of Gridley Quayle, and when tired of doing that to lie on his <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> ceiling and think of nothing.|$|E
60|$|Manifold are the cares {{of wealth}} and state. Mr Dorrit's {{satisfaction}} in remembering {{that it had not}} been necessary for him to announce himself to Clennam and Co., or to make an allusion to his having had any knowledge of the intrusive person of that name, had been damped over-night, while it was still fresh, by a debate that arose within him whether or no he should take the Marshalsea in his way <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> old gate. He had decided not to do so; and had astonished the coachman by being very fierce with him for proposing to go over London Bridge and recross the river by Waterloo Bridge--a course which would have taken him almost within sight of his old quarters. Still, for all that, the question had raised a conflict in his breast; and, for some odd reason or no reason, he was vaguely dissatisfied. Even at the Merdle dinner-table next day, he was so out of sorts about it that he continued at intervals to turn it over and over, in a manner frightfully inconsistent with the good society surrounding him. It made him hot to think what the Chief Butler's opinion of him would have been, if that illustrious personage could have plumbed with that heavy eye of his the stream of his meditations.|$|E
60|$|Amyntas wandered slowly {{towards the}} village. Were his dreams {{to end in}} the herding of swine? What was this cavern of which the {{herdsman}} spoke? He felt a strange impulse to go <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> dark opening between the little trees from which blew the cold wind.... But perhaps the rich man had a beauteous daughter; history is full of the social successes of swine herds. Amyntas felt a strange thrill as the dark lake came before his mind; he almost heard the lapping of the water.... Kings' daughters had often looked upon lowly swineherds and raised them to golden thrones. But {{he could not help}} going to look again at the dark opening between the little trees. He walked back and again the cold breath blew against his face; he felt in it the icy coldness of the water. It drew him in; he separated the little trees on either side. He walked on as if a hidden power urged him. And now the path became less clear; trees and bushes grew in the way and hindered him, brambles and long creeping plants twisted about his legs and pulled him back. But the wind with its coldness of the black water drew him on.... The birds of the air were hushed, and not one of the thousand insects of the wood uttered a note. Great trees above him hid the light. The silence was ghastly; {{he felt as if he}} were the only person in the world.|$|E

5000|$|Roger Ebert, {{film critic}} {{writing for the}} Chicago Sun-Times, liked the film, and wrote, [...] "Men With Guns is immensely moving and sad, and yet because it dares so much, it is an exhilarating film.

5000|$|Before {{jumping in}} to analyze a plot, it is {{important}} to take a step <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> components of plot structure. Amy's View is a linear play, which follows the common format of the Freytag Pyramid. The play begins in a state of equilibrium, experiences an inciting incident, causes the viewer to produce a major dramatic question, continues with rising action, climaxes, and then resolves itself to a new state of equilibrium. Here is an outline of these steps for Amy's View: ...|$|E

[...] When questioned about whether he was comparing President Obama to Hitler, Carson said: [...] "No. I am saying in a situation where people do not express themselves, bad things can happen." ...|$|E

50|$|Over {{and against}} this “I,” which is “that which experiences,” Smoley posits that which “is {{experienced}} — whether inside ourselves or outside.” This statement highlights one unusual aspect of Smoley’s views. He {{claims that it}} is possible to step <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> contents of one’s own psyche as if it belonged to a third party. In one meditative exercise that he gives, he says, “even your most intimate feelings and desires will pass before you like images on a screen.” Thus for Smoley, even what is usually seen as the internal realm of the psyche is part of the “world” that is experienced.|$|E
5000|$|On June 11, 2014, Watters debuted on the Fox News show, Outnumbered. He {{occasionally}} {{appears as}} a guest co-host. On November 20, 2015, Watters debuted his own monthly Fox News program, Watters' World. He is characterized as an [...] "ambush journalist", Watters has said, [...] "I {{try to make it}} enjoyable for the person I'm interviewing. We always come away from the interview all smiles, for the most part. And it's always fun to come <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> footage and say, 'Oh my gosh, what just happened?'"
