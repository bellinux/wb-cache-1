5|$|The demonologist Pierre de Lancre (1553–1631) {{boasted that}} even dead French monarchs could heal; it was, indeed, still {{believed}} in the 16th century that the healing power was retained by Saint Louis IX's arm, preserved in Poblet Monastery in Catalonia. In order to <b>be</b> <b>touched</b> <b>by</b> the French king, people traveled from as far off as the present-day Italy and Spain already in the 13th century. The foreigners were ranked in a specific order, with the Spanish taking precedence over all others and the king's own subjects coming last.|$|E
5|$|In 1934, Abbe {{moved to}} Kyoto {{with his mother}} and his sister Toyoka so that he could attend Busen, {{training}} in both the judo and kendo programmes. Abbe learned kendo under the direction of Busen's head sword instructor, Kinnosuke Ogawa, a master who held the rank of 10th dan. He recalled that his instructor, at the age of 75 years, was so skilled that he could not <b>be</b> <b>touched</b> <b>by</b> any of the students or younger instructors. Every Saturday afternoon at Busen, following tradition, judo tournaments were held. Abbe fought five opponents in succession with each contest lasting five minutes, and he won all or almost all of these matches. In his first year at Busen, he was promoted to 4th dan in judo. In the autumn of his second year there, he was promoted to 5th dan, by which time he was reported to have been fighting 20 opponents in succession.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor, River, Amy, and Rory {{suddenly}} {{find themselves}} near the TARDIS in a New York graveyard back in 2012, Rory's plan having worked. As the four prepare to depart, Rory catches {{sight of a}} tombstone with his name on it. He is then touched by a surviving, albeit weakened, Angel and sent into the past. The Doctor is unable to take the TARDIS back to get him, due to the paradox Rory and Amy created. Amy refuses to be parted from Rory and willingly allows herself to <b>be</b> <b>touched</b> <b>by</b> the same Angel {{in the hopes of}} being sent back to the same time as he was. Her name then appears along with Rory's on the tombstone. The Doctor is distraught, but River reminds him that while their fates are now sealed, Amy likely published the Melody Malone book in the past and may have left him a message. The Doctor races back to where they had their picnic and recovers the final page, finding the afterword written by Amy to him. Amy explains that she and Rory lived out a good and happy life for themselves, and asks the Doctor to visit her childhood self to assure her that he will come back for her to take her on amazing journeys. The episode ends with a young Amelia Pond sitting in her back garden, then looking up and smiling as the TARDIS engines are heard.|$|E

This Bible was seen as supplanting the New Testament, and depicts Mai Chaza {{as a member of the}} Trinity. Women who were unable to conceive travelled to her church so that they could <b>be</b> <b>touched</b> <b>by</b> Mai Chaza, in the hope of being able to have a successful pregnancy. Individuals regarded as possessed by demons would fall to the floor and acknowledge the authority of the Holy Spirit.|$|E
25|$|Players are not {{permitted}} to carry the ring over the two blue lines; they can advance the ring over the line only by passing it to another player. The ring must <b>be</b> <b>touched</b> <b>by</b> any other player first, but {{does not need to be}} under control before the passer take possession again (e.g., the passer bounces the ring off a player's skate and then picks it up). If a player touches the ring consecutively on both sides of the blue line their team loses possession and the opposing team is given a free pass. If the ring goes over both blue lines, the team that passed it may not touch it until the opposing team does or attempts to get the ring.|$|E
25|$|The Holy Table {{may only}} <b>be</b> <b>touched</b> <b>by</b> ordained {{members of the}} higher clergy (bishops, priests and deacons), and nothing which is not itself consecrated or an object of veneration {{should be placed on}} it. Objects may also be placed on the altar as part of the process for setting them aside for sacred use. For example, icons are usually blessed by laying them on the Holy Table {{for a period of time}} or for a certain number of Divine Liturgies before {{sprinkling}} them with holy water, and placing them where they will be venerated. The Epitaphios on Good Friday, and the Cross on the Feasts of the Cross, are also placed on the Holy Table before they are taken to the center of the church to be venerated by the faithful.|$|E

25|$|Free kicks and dead-ball restarts {{come into}} play {{following}} a foul or other infractions. Indirect free kicks must <b>be</b> <b>touched</b> <b>by</b> another player before any shot is taken. Direct free kicks can be made directly on goal. Offensive players attempt numerous tricks to beat the defenders, who often form a solid wall of players {{directly in front of}} the goal. Attackers may attempt to blast the ball through the defensive wall, or curl it over or around using spin. A less common idea is to hit the ball powerfully and straight along the floor, since the defenders in the wall usually jump to try and prevent a shot being lifted over their heads. David Beckham, Ronaldinho, Zico, Juninho, Andrea Pirlo, Neymar, Roberto Carlos, Francesco Totti, Lionel Messi, Álvaro Recoba, Cristiano Ronaldo, Rivaldo, Juan Román Riquelme, Steven Gerrard, Wayne Rooney, Sejad Salihović, Rogério Ceni, Alessandro Del Piero, Thierry Henry, Roberto Baggio, Diego Maradona, Frank Lampard, Leighton Baines, Wesley Sneijder, Luis Suárez, Christian Eriksen, Miralem Pjanić and {ollen sebifelo}Gareth Bale are widely known to score from free kick positions.|$|E
25|$|An alternative, more esoteric, {{interpretation}} is expounded by Messianic Muslims in the Sufi and Isma'ili traditions {{so as to}} unite Islam, Christianity and Judaism into a single religious continuum. Other Messianic Muslims hold a similar theological view regarding Jesus, without attempting to unite the religions. Making use of the New Testament's distinguishing between Jesus, Son of Man (being the physical human Jesus), and Christ, Son of God (being the Holy Spirit of God residing {{in the body of}} Jesus), the Holy Spirit, being immortal and immaterial, is not subject to crucifixion — for it can never die, nor can it <b>be</b> <b>touched</b> <b>by</b> the earthly nails of the crucifixion, for it is a being of pure spirit. Thus, while the spirit of Christ avoided crucifixion by ascending unto God, the body that was Jesus was sacrificed on the cross, thereby bringing the Old Testament to final fulfillment. Thus Quranic passages on the death of Jesus affirm that while the Pharisees intended to destroy the Son of God completely, they, in fact, succeeded only in killing the Son of Man, being his nasut (material being). Meanwhile, the Son of God, being his lahut (spiritual being) remained alive and undying — because it is the Holy Spirit.|$|E

Upon bringing in a lamp, and seeing his daughter, the king attempted to kill her on the spot, but Myrrha escaped.|$|E

500|$|Cosima and Blandine {{remained}} with Anna Liszt until 1850, joined eventually by Daniel. Cosima's biographer George Marek describes Anna as [...] "a simple, uneducated, unworldly but warmhearted woman ... {{for the first}} time [...] experienced what it was to <b>be</b> <b>touched</b> <b>by</b> love". Of the sisters, Blandine was evidently the prettier; Cosima, with her long nose and wide mouth was described as an [...] "ugly duckling". Although Liszt's relations with his children were formal and distant, he provided for them liberally, and ensured that they were well educated. Both girls were sent to Madame Bernard's, an exclusive boarding school, while Daniel was prepared for the prestigious Lycée Bonaparte.|$|E
500|$|The second {{concept is}} a huge energy vessel hidden in the world inside the Moon and {{protected}} by the Ōtsutsuki clan. It is a yellow sun-like object with a double-layered hexagonal pupil surrounded by orange flower-like iris. The center of the core also contains Hamura's Tenseigan. The object is stored within a spherical case attached to Hamura's shrine. It can only <b>be</b> <b>touched</b> <b>by</b> someone who possesses [...] "the undiluted chakra of Hamura". The vessel is a highly powerful object as it supports {{the life of the}} hollow world by providing the artificial sun. It was also used in warfare by the feuding main and branch families of the Ǒtsutsuki clan. However, to support the vessel, all Ōtsutsuki clan members have to give up and combine their Byakugan within the vessel. This includes Toneri, the last surviving member of the clan.|$|E
500|$|In the Kurma Purana, Sita prays to Agni {{just when}} Ravana arrives to kidnap her. Agni creates Maya Sita – an exact double of Sita – {{who takes the}} place of Sita and is {{abducted}} by the demon. While Sita is taken by Agni to heaven, Maya Sita is confined in Lanka. After Ravana's death, when Maya Sita enters the fire at Agni Pariksha, Agni restores the real undefiled Sita to Rama; meanwhile Maya Sita is destroyed in the blaze. The Chaitanya Charitamrita, a biography of the Vaishnava saint Chaitanya Mahaprabhu (1486–1533), by Krishnadasa Kaviraja (b. 1496) alludes to the Kurma Purana tale. Chaitanya meets a brahmin Rama devotee in Madurai. The brahmin is devastated after learning that [...] "mother Sita, mother of the universe and the supreme goddess of fortune" [...] was stained by Ravana's touch and gives up food. The saint consoles the brahmin saying that Sita's spiritual form can not <b>be</b> <b>touched</b> <b>by</b> the demon; it was Maya Sita that was taken away by Ravana. The brahmin feels better and accepts food. Chaitanya then travels to Rameswaram, where he listens to the Kurma Purana and obtains the authoritative proof to comfort the brahmin. He returns to Madurai with the Kurma Purana manuscript, leaving that brahmin overjoyed.|$|E

500|$|At the {{beginning}} of every quarter and after a goal has been scored, play starts with {{a player in the}} centre position passing the ball from the centre of the court. These [...] "centre passes" [...] alternate between the teams, regardless of which team scored the last goal. When the umpire blows the whistle to restart play, four players from each team can move into the centre third to receive the pass. The centre pass must be caught or touched in the centre third. The ball is then moved up and down the court through passing and must <b>be</b> <b>touched</b> <b>by</b> a player in each adjacent third of the court. Players can hold the ball for only three seconds at any time. It must be released before the foot they were standing on when they caught it touches the ground again. Contact between players is only permitted if it does not impede an opponent or the general play. When defending a pass or shot players must be at least [...] away from the player with the ball. If illegal contact is made, the player who contacted cannot participate in play until the player taking the penalty has passed or shot the ball. If the ball is held in two hands and either dropped or a shot at goal is missed, the same player cannot be the first to touch it unless it first rebounds off the goal.|$|E

[...] Nonetheless, the continued popularity of communion rails in Anglican church construction suggests that a sense of {{the sanctity of the}} altar and its surrounding area persists. [...] In most cases, moreover, the practice of allowing only those items that have been blessed to be placed on the altar is maintained (that is, the linen cloth, candles, missal, and the Eucharistic vessels).|$|E
2500|$|The rice or {{the soup}} is eaten {{by picking up}} the bowl with the left hand and using chopsticks (hashi) with the right, or vice versa if one is left-handed. Traditionally, chopsticks were held in the right hand and the bowl in the left.

Bowls may be lifted to the mouth, but should not <b>be</b> <b>touched</b> <b>by</b> the mouth except when drinking soup. The Japanese customarily slurp noodle soup dishes like ramen, udon, and soba. When slurping noodles quickly, the soup clings to the noodles, making the dish more flavourful.|$|E
