5|$|A new {{interchange}} at Aspen Avenue in <b>Broken</b> <b>Arrow</b> {{opened on}} May 18, 2012. The project was completed three weeks {{ahead of schedule}} {{at a cost of}} $6.137 million, of which $1.75 million was paid by OTA, with the rest coming from the City of <b>Broken</b> <b>Arrow.</b> The new interchange was expected to attract retail, dining, and entertainment development to the area around the interchange.|$|E
5|$|Construction of {{the portion}} of the highway between the eastern {{terminus}} and the Muskogee Turnpike, known as the <b>Broken</b> <b>Arrow</b> south loop, was scheduled to begin in May 1999 and be completed in January 2001. The section from the Muskogee Turnpike north to the Will Rogers Turnpike was to begin construction in September 1999 and be completed in January 2002. Unlike the section of the turnpike built in the early 1990s, this section was expected to displace few residents; the city of <b>Broken</b> <b>Arrow</b> had purchased much of the right-of-way ahead of time to preserve the corridor for the expected turnpike.|$|E

5|$|US-64 and SH-51 proceed {{southeast}} {{from downtown}} along another freeway, the <b>Broken</b> <b>Arrow</b> Expressway. Between Lewis Avenue and Sheridan Road, a rail line {{runs down the}} median of the highway. After the freeway splits away from the railroad alignment, it comes to an interchange with I-44/ SH-66. From here, the <b>Broken</b> <b>Arrow</b> Expressway heads southeast to an interchange with the Mingo Valley Expressway, which carries US-169. Here, US-64 splits away to follow the southbound Mingo Valley Expressway, while SH-51 continues southeast on the <b>Broken</b> <b>Arrow</b> Expressway. US-64/ US-169 follow a due south course to an interchange with the Creek Turnpike. The freeway merges with a free section of the turnpike, heading west. At an interchange with Memorial Drive, US-64 turns south, splitting away from the freeway. US-169 ends at this point, and tolls resume on the Creek Turnpike {{to the west of}} the interchange.|$|E
5|$|In {{descending}} order of population, Oklahoma's largest cities in 2010 were: Oklahoma City (579,999, +14.6%), Tulsa (391,906, −0.3%), Norman (110,925, +15.9%), <b>Broken</b> <b>Arrow</b> (98,850, +32.0%), Lawton (96,867, +4.4%), Edmond (81,405, +19.2%), Moore (55,081, +33.9%), Midwest City (54,371, +0.5%), Enid (49,379, +5.0%), and Stillwater (45,688, +17.0%).

5|$|In Tulsa, the Creek Turnpike has an {{interchange}} at Memorial Drive, {{which carries}} US-64 {{south of the}} toll road. At this interchange, Creek Turnpike traffic merges with northbound US-64 onto a free road, forming the Mingo Valley Expressway. US-169 also begins at this interchange, heading north from here toward its other end in Virginia, Minnesota. As the Mingo Valley Expressway (carrying US-64/US-169) turns north, the Creek Turnpike exits to continue southeast. The highway leaves Tulsa, entering <b>Broken</b> <b>Arrow,</b> where it crosses over Haikey Creek. The turnpike passes through the second toll plaza, then turns back east.|$|E

5|$|In {{southeast}} <b>Broken</b> <b>Arrow,</b> the Creek Turnpike {{crosses the}} county line into Wagoner County and swings towards the north-northeast. It then meets SH-51, {{followed by the}} Muskogee Turnpike (SH-351) near that highway's western terminus. The Creek Turnpike passes through {{the third and final}} barrier toll after re-entering Tulsa. From the toll plaza, the turnpike proceeds north to end at the I-44/US-412 interchange, which straddles the Wagoner–Rogers County county line. The portion of the interchange that sits in Rogers County also lies in the town of Fair Oaks. The mainline Creek Turnpike becomes the Will Rogers Turnpike as eastbound I-44 merges onto the roadway.|$|E

5|$|On July 7, 1947, another {{modification}} to {{the route}} was made, moving its western terminus {{from the northern}} portion of the panhandle to a new roadway in the southern section. The next significant change to the highway took place on April 4, 1960, when it was realigned to the north between the cities of Gore and Vian. Two years later, on April 4, 1962, US-64 was relocated to the north west of Tulsa, near Sand Springs. On November 4, 1963, a bypass was added through the city of Enid. It was designated as US-64 Bypass and ran on Willow Avenue and 30th Street. A couple of months later, on February 3, 1964, US-64 was moved onto a freeway through the southeastern portion of Tulsa. Later, on December 1 of the same year, similar reroutings through Tulsa and <b>Broken</b> <b>Arrow</b> were approved by the Oklahoma Department of Highways.|$|E

5|$|The western {{extension}} was {{the first}} to open to traffic. Following a brief dedication ceremony attended by Governor Keating, Transportation Secretary McCaleb, and OTA board member Bartlett, the highway opened on December 15, 2000. As with the first section of the turnpike, tolls were waived for the weekend; the road was free until noon on December 18. The south loop was opened in two segments. The first, from US-64/US-169 to South Elm Place in <b>Broken</b> <b>Arrow,</b> opened at 3p.m. August 15, 2001. The new segment remained toll-free until 7a.m. August 20. A rainy September pushed back the opening of {{the other half of the}} south loop by two months. The second half of the south loop, from Elm Place to New Orleans Street, opened at 2p.m. April 15, 2002. The final segment of the extension, connecting New Orleans Street and the Muskogee Turnpike to the Will Rogers Turnpike, was scheduled to open on August 16 of that year.|$|E

25|$|In the 1960s, <b>Broken</b> <b>Arrow</b> {{began to}} grow {{from a small town}} into a {{suburban}} city.

During this time, the city was more of a bedroom community.
