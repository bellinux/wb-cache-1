5000|$|It was a four bay biplane, with fabric covered, {{constant}} chord, unswept wings with angled tips. The upper wing, which {{carried the}} ailerons, had a 7% greater span {{and a smaller}} chord. There was no stagger, so the sets of parallel interplane struts were vertical; flying wires braced each bay. Pairs of V-form engine <b>bearing</b> <b>struts</b> which supported the two rotary engines above the lower wing defined the inner two bays. It {{was designed to be}} powered either by a pair of [...] Le Rhône 9Jb or [...] Clerget 9B nine-cylinder rotary engines. Ailerons were fitted only to the upper wing.|$|R
2500|$|The C.23 BN.2 was {{designed}} to be a night bomber able to reach Berlin with a [...] bomb load. The French BN.2 military category indicated a two-seat night bomber but the C.23 had a crew of three. It had a much in common with the Caudron C.22 but was almost 50% larger in span, requiring an extra bay and more powerful engines. It was a large five bay biplane, with fabric covered, constant chord, unswept wings with angled tips. The upper wing, which carried the ailerons, had a slightly greater (4%) span and a smaller chord. There was no stagger, so the sets of parallel interplane struts were vertical; flying wires braced each bay.

40|$|Presently, as {{a result}} of the {{technical}} progress, more and more complicated machines are being used in our everyday life. This is especially the case in relation to technology used at sea, where highly specialised services are needed. Sophisticated marine devices require special diagnostic methods that take into account the specific conditions of use of this type of machinery. In this paper we present the diagnostic systems elaborated to support the exploitation of the vessel power plant with gas turbines. During engine assembly, the rotating components are mounted with great attention in order to minimise shaft unbalance. However, even while applying the highest standards, factors such as machines’ imperfection or differential thermal expansion cause a small residual unbalance of the gas turbine rotor. The dynamic problems of Marine Gas Turbine Engines are directly related to such basic elements as rotors, <b>bearings,</b> <b>struts</b> of <b>bearings,</b> engine body and the type of substructure...|$|R

40|$|A novel {{multi-mode}} {{implementation of}} pulsed detonation engines is investigated in this paper. The various modes in this proposed concept are (as illustrated in Fig. [1]) : (1) An ejector augmented pulse detonation rocket for take off to moderate supersonic Mach numbers (2) A pulsed normal detonation wave mode at combustion chamber Mach numbers {{less than the}} Chapman-Jouguet Mach number, (3) An oblique detonation wave mode of operation for Mach numbers in the airbreathing regime that are higher than the Chapman-Jouguet Mach number, and (4) A pure Pulsed Detonation Rocket (PDR) mode of operation at high altitude. These various modes utilize a single flow path, in which an array of detonation tubes is placed. From present considerations, 10 tubes will be placed across {{the width of the}} engine, which fire sequentially in such a manner as to make the maximum use of the incoming air mass and provide the smoothest possible operation of the device. These tubes could alternately be arranged as load <b>bearing</b> <b>struts</b> that are embedded with rocket chambers. The advantage of such a mode is that a larger exhaust area is available for these tubes when operating in the rocket mode and mixing properties are enhanced in the other modes when these tubes are used for fuel injection alone...|$|R
50|$|On 1 August, Twining {{moved to}} a new fire support {{assignment}} off the southeast coast of Tinian. She made the first of three bombardment runs at 01:30 and later stood in to 1,500 yards from shore to pound enemy-held slopes and caves with gunfire. On the 7th, Twining departed Saipan, escorting slow-moving LST-130 to Eniwetok. A week later, she entered the atoll where her worn <b>strut</b> <b>bearings</b> were replaced.|$|R
50|$|The {{fuselage}} was {{in three}} parts. The forward part mounted the Hispano-Suiza V-12 engine within a close-fitting, sheet metal cowling {{that followed the}} cylinder banks and with a curved, transverse Lamblin radiator under its rear. Behind the engine the fuselage structure was a conventional rectangular section girder frame <b>bearing</b> wing <b>struts</b> and undercarriage and containing two tandem open cockpits. The aircraft was normally flown from the forward one, placed under the wing cut-out, and the observer's position was close behind, equipped with flying controls including a demountable control column, a flexible machine gun mounting and small side-windows. Immediately aft the girder cross-section was reduced rapidly, then joined to the final part of the fuselage, an unusual truncated dural cone strengthened internally with longerons and frames.|$|R
40|$|An {{aluminum}} platform {{serves as}} a storage shelf for experiments transported on the space shuttle. This platform {{is attached to the}} shuttle storage area through several supports, each consisting of an attachment fitting, a monoball bearing, a clevis pin and a support strut. The experiments must be temperature controlled during and after launch. Consequently, heat loss through the plate, attachment fitting, monoball <b>bearing,</b> and <b>strut</b> are important. The overall conductance of the monoball bearing was determined by an experimental method of heating the outer ring with a nichrome resistance wire and cooling the inner ball with propylene glycol. Temperature differences across the bearing were measured for various heat fluxes. The overall conductance is 0. 42 Watts/C (0. 80 BTU/hr F), This yields a 16 watt loss for a 38 C temperature difference across the bearing...|$|R
50|$|One AT {{was built}} for NACA testing in 1930, and was {{designated}} the AT-4. It had modified wide landing gear with added fittings for pontoons, {{which may or may}} not have been used. The colors were a blue fuselage, silver wings, yellow stripe. Special equipment included: EDO pontoon fittings with structural <b>bearing,</b> steel interplane <b>struts.</b> On 31 January 1931, test pilot Lou Meister bailed out of this plane after entering an unrecoverable spin. He died when his parachute did not fully deploy after bailing out.|$|R
50|$|The kingpin axis is {{the line}} between the upper and lower ball joints of the hub. On a MacPherson strut, the top pivot point is the <b>strut</b> <b>bearing,</b> and the bottom point is the lower ball joint. The {{inclination}} of the steering axis is measured as the angle between the steering axis and the centerline of the wheel. This means that if the camber angle is adjustable within the pivot points the scrub radius can be changed, this alters the width and offset of the tires on a vehicle.|$|R
2500|$|The {{aircraft}} was a high-wing monoplane, with the pilot sitting below the wing. A pair of inverted V struts formed the fabric-covered cabane structure which carried the upper bracing wires: the front struts were continued below the wing, with the forward <b>struts</b> <b>bearing</b> the mainwheels. [...] An [...] elongated cruciform tail unit {{was attached to}} the end of a single boom by a universal joint immediately behind the single tailwheel. [...] Lateral control was effected by wing-warping. [...] It was powered [...] by a 12kW (18hp) two-stroke air-cooled V-4 engine, also built by Grade, which drove a two-bladed aluminium bladed propeller.|$|R
5000|$|Signs of strut failure {{include a}} popping or {{clicking}} noise when {{the steering wheel}} of the vehicle is turned, especially when the vehicle is not in motion. This noise {{is caused by a}} worn out <b>bearing.</b> Most <b>strut</b> failure is gradual, and becomes evident as a more [...] "trampoline"-like ride, rough travel over bumps, and tire noise/ vibrations. This wear affects all of the strut components in a feedback loop: the more worn out the shock absorbers become, the more worn out the spring will become, the more worn out the mount will become, and the more this will affect the shock absorbers. A tendency for the front of the vehicle to [...] "nose dive" [...] when applying the brakes and to rear upwards ("squatting") when accelerating are other signs of strut failure, as is difficulty handling the vehicle generally. These symptoms will only tend to worsen until the struts are replaced with new components (struts cannot be repaired when worn out, but must be removed entirely). Many strut [...] "replacements" [...] on non-commercial vehicles are in fact only replacements of the shock absorber and not the other components.|$|R
50|$|Small wind turbines, {{particularly}} self-build designs, {{are widely}} adopting magneto alternators for their generators. These use rotating neodymium rare-earth magnets with a three-phase stator, then a bridge rectifier to produce DC. This is then used either directly for water-pumping, stored in batteries, or {{used to drive}} a mains inverter which can supply the grid system for profit. These designs have been encouraged {{by one of the}} most popular self-build designs, described in Hugh Piggott's series of books and courses. A typical design here is an axial-flux generator recycled from a car brake disk and hub <b>bearing.</b> A MacPherson <b>strut</b> provides the azimuth bearing to bring the turbine into the wind. The brake disk, and its attached rare-earth magnets, rotates to form the armature. A plywood disk carrying multiple axial coils is placed alongside this, with a further iron armature ring behind it.|$|R
5000|$|For {{the same}} reason it was widely used in water-lubricated shaft {{bearings}} for ships and hydro-electric power plants, and in the stern-tube bearings of ship propellers [...] until the 1960s saw the introduction of sealed white metal bearings. According to the San Francisco Maritime National Park Association website, the shaft bearings on the WWII submarine [...] were made of this wood. [...] The aft main shaft <b>strut</b> <b>bearings</b> for , the world's first nuclear-powered submarine, were composed of this wood. Also, the bearings in the original 1920s turbines of the Conowingo hydroelectric plant on the lower Susquehanna River were made from lignum vitae. The shaft bearings on the horizontal turbines at the Pointe du Bois generating station in Manitoba are made from lignum vitae. Other hydroelectric plant turbine bearings, many of them still in service, were fabricated with lignum vitae and are too numerous to list here.|$|R
5000|$|On 8 August, the {{destroyer}} was shifted to TG 35.4 {{consisting of a}} cruiser division and a squadron of destroyers. Their assignment was to investigate surface targets reported some 63 miles (101 km) from the main formation. While she was forming up at 32 kn, her starboard propeller and a portion of her tail shaft broke off just forward of the after <b>strut</b> <b>bearing.</b> The damages forced her to rejoin the main force though she remained seaworthy, capable of 23 kn, and able to maintain station in formation. The following day, when [...] suffered a kamikaze hit, Abbot rendered assistance and escorted her to a rendezvous with hospital ship [...] to evacuate casualties and thence to Saipan for repairs. The ships arrived at Saipan on 17 August, {{two days after the}} cessation of hostilities. There, Abbot herself entered drydock where her damage was found to be sufficiently serious to warrant her retiring, via Hawaii, to the Puget Sound Navy Yard. She arrived in Bremerton, Washington, early in September. After repairs, she reported to the Commander, San Diego Group, Pacific Reserve Fleet, for inactivation. Abbot was placed out of commission on 21 May 1946 and was berthed at San Diego.|$|R
40|$|Matthews, an {{industrial}} designer and medical engineer, led the RCA’s workpackage in a multidisciplinary research project {{to develop a}} new neck brace to improve safety and comfort for people with spinal injuries. He worked in partnership with clinicians from the University of the West of England, the Royal National Hospital for Rheumatic Diseases, the Great Western Ambulance Service, and the Bath Institute for Medical Engineering, under the National Institute for Health Research’s i 4 i programme. If it is suspected that an individual has fractured a neck vertebra in a fall or accident, ambulance staff fit a cervical collar to immobilise the neck in order to avoid further injury. Current solutions can be ineffective at limiting head movement; they may also increase blood pressure in the head by restricting the return of blood to the body. Matthews studied the complete patient journey, analysing the anatomy of the upper chest, neck and head, and the way that existing collars are used. The evidence collected formed the basis of a brief for the design and development of a better neck brace. Based on the principle of creating a band around the crown of the patient’s head and supporting it through rigid <b>struts</b> <b>bearing</b> on the chest and shoulders, a number of basic prototype structures were made and tested. The resulting patented low-cost ‘Kensington Collar’ has a front frame, adjustable for height and width, that attaches to a rear support, providing better neck immobilisation, unimpeded return blood flow, greater patient comfort, easy fitting for the clinician and clear access for examinations and x-ray imaging. Matthews presented the design at the AHRC Skills Development in Design Practice Workshop, Kingston University (July 2013), the Flexibility in Enterprises Conference (Tallinn October 2013) and the Student Paramedics Conference, University of Hatfield (2013) ...|$|R
40|$|The design {{reliability}} of the theory applied when calculating the sensitivity of shafting alignment must be determined especially at the initial design stage of shafting arrangement and calculation for the vertical static bearing loads (reaction forces) and pressures {{in order to obtain}} positive uniform values, which have to comply with the design requirements of the High Speed Craft Code of Classification Society. Any poor design of shafting arrangement for each vertical static bearing location and/or bearing off-set design value may cause a failed shafting alignment calculation and a non-uniform bearing load or over excessive bearing load and pressure on the propulsion shaft stern tube/strut supporting bearing and possible further damage, for example, excessive wastage and/or crack on a damaged aft shaft <b>strut</b> <b>bearing</b> for a high speed craft. The objective {{of this study was to}} find and verify the design {{reliability of}} the applied theoretical method for calculating the suitable design values of each vertical static bearing load and pressure on the propulsion shafting system at the initial design stage of shafting arrangement. The design values for each vertical static bearing load and pressure calculated by theoretical design methodologies of the finite element method (FEM) and the three moment equation method (TMEM) were compared with the shipyard original design values for the same design case of propulsion shafting system. The design deviation of the vertical static bearing from the shipyard original design values was determined in order to decide which design methodology (TMEM or FEM) would be adopted and developed for further numerical algorithm design on shafting alignment optimization. According to the obtained results, both the FEM and the TMEM theoretical design accuracy and reliability were well matched with the shipyard original design values. In addition, the TMEM design results for each static bearing load and pressure proved to be more close to the shipyard original design values...|$|R
50|$|The Nieuport II was {{the subject}} of {{extensive}} research carried out by the Nieuport brothers in conjunction with the Eiffel Laboratories and benefitted from input from Robert Esnault-Pelterie, who had designed his own low-drag monoplane. The result was a wire-braced monoplane with only a single pair of bracing wires on each side, supplemented with a single pair of control wires to warp the wings for lateral control. The airfoil section was unusual in having a fairly thick (for the period), but sharp leading edge, with the undersides rising up to thin the airfoil out over the majority of the chord. The upper wires led to a pyramidal cabane and the pilot was nearly fully enclosed in the fuselage, with only his head exposed. Initially the undercarriage consisted of a single central skid attached to the fuselage by two inverted V <b>struts,</b> <b>bearing</b> a transverse leaf spring with a wheel on each end. When first flown the tail surfaces consisted of a semicircular horizontal stabiliser mounted on top of the rear of the fuselage, behind which was a universally-jointed assembly combining a rectangular elevator with a pair of rudders. The controls used the joystick to provide yaw (rudder) and pitch (elevator) control, while foot pedals operated the wing warping for lateral control, the pedals moving a torque tube which ran diagonally backwards to the rear v-strut of the undercarriage, where the warping wires were attached. Late examples were available with the modern arrangement as a factory option, using the pedals to control the rudder, as was used on the contemporary Blériot and Deperdussin aircraft. A variety of engines were used, starting with the Darracq, which, despite being developed specifically for Nieuport, proved unsatisfactory, and a variety of engines were tried before the Nieuport brothers developed their own twin-cylinder, horizontally-opposed engine.|$|R
50|$|Two days later, the {{destroyer}} arrived in Subic Bay, and she entered drydock, soon thereafter, for repairs to her <b>strut</b> <b>bearing,</b> the bow, the peak tank, and her air search radar antenna. Concurrently with this yard work, she conducted a tender availability with Piedmont (AD-17) to prepare her for visits to Australia and New Zealand during the forthcoming {{celebration of the}} 25th anniversary of the Battle of the Coral Sea. Repairs and availability completed, she stood out of Subic Bay on 24 April in company with McKean (DD-784). En route to Melbourne, the two ships stopped at Manus in the Admiralty Islands and at Brisbane, Australia. The ship reached Melbourne on 8 May; and, while she remained there until the 13th, her crew enjoyed Australian hospitality {{in the city and}} replied in kind on board. Between 13 and 17 May, she made a rough transit of the Tasman Sea and arrived in Auckland, New Zealand, on the latter date for the second phase of her Coral Sea celebration. She remained in Auckland until 22 May at which time she and McKean put to sea to return to the United States. After a stop at Pago Pago, American Samoa, the two ships rejoined Gridley (DLG-21) and Maddox on 26 May to reconstitute DesRon 19 for the voyage home. After a brief fueling stop at Pearl Harbor on 2 June, the warships arrived in Long Beach on the 8th. Between June and September, Turner Joy went through a month of post-deployment standdown followed by training operations in the waters off southern California. On 18 September, she arrived at Bremerton, Washington, for a two-month shipyard availability at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard. In mid-November, she returned to Long Beach and resumed operations along the California coast.|$|R
