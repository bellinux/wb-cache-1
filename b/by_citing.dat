5|$|The German {{occupation}} of Luxembourg in World War I {{was the first}} of two military occupations of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg by Germany in the twentieth century. From August 1914 until the end of World War I on 11 November 1918, Luxembourg was under full occupation by the German Empire. The German government justified the occupation <b>by</b> <b>citing</b> the need to support their armies in neighbouring France, although many Luxembourgers, contemporary and present, have interpreted German actions otherwise.|$|E
5|$|Although {{operated}} by private companies, the system's fare structure is {{regulated by the}} Public Transport Council (PTC), to which the operators submit requests for changes in fares. Fares are kept affordable by pegging them approximately to distance-related bus fares, thus encouraging commuters to use the network and reduce heavy reliance on the bus system. Fare increases {{over the past few}} years have caused public concern, the latest one having taken effect from 1 October 2008. There were similar expressions of disapproval over the slightly higher fares charged on SBS Transit's North East Line, a disparity that SBS Transit justified <b>by</b> <b>citing</b> higher costs of operation and maintenance on a completely underground line, as well as lower patronage.|$|E

5|$|In {{the general}} election, Clements faced Republican state {{attorney}} general Eldon S. Dummit. While Clements managed to keep the Democrats united following the primary, Dummit had fractured the Republicans by attacking the administration of sitting Republican governor Simeon S. Willis and his preferred successor during the Republican primary. Dummit mounted a meager challenge <b>by</b> <b>citing</b> Clements' opposition to the Taft-Hartley Act, {{but this was not}} very effective. Dummit had replaced his campaign manager from the primary election, and when the ousted manager turned against him in the general election, it sounded the death knell for his campaign. Clements won the election by a vote of 387,795 to 287,756. He resigned his seat in the U.S. House to accept the governorship.|$|E
5|$|Later that day, Lane storms into a partners' meeting, {{shouting}} at Pete about how Edwin's wife has {{found out about}} Edwin's adultery and is devastated; Edwin has withdrawn his business as a result. Lane blames Pete's methods for losing the account, and Pete responds <b>by</b> <b>citing</b> Lane's redundant role at the firm and challenging his sexuality. To the surprise and shock of the other partners, Lane responds by challenging Pete to a fistfight. Pete and Lane exchange blows until Lane wins, leaving a bloodied Pete on the office floor. Bruised, shaken, and humiliated, Pete retreats to his office. Joan goes to comfort Lane, only Lane misinterprets her affection as romantic and kisses her. Joan, startled, stands and opens the door, but does not leave. She instead stays with Lane and forgives his blunder, claiming that he'd done to Pete what everyone in the office had wanted to do for some time.|$|E
5|$|Sultan Iskandar is {{reputed to}} have been a staunch disciplinarian, with {{willingness}} to occasionally voice personal opinions on governmental issues. On the personal side, subjects who have personally approached the Sultan in his later years described him as a person with a warm and generous personality. However, past critics had also argued that Sultan Iskandar was a person with a turbulent temper. These claims were made <b>by</b> <b>citing</b> records of past notorious incidents, which include an experience of being disinherited from being the Tunku Mahkota of Johor (or Crown Prince in English) by his father, in 1961, as well as a series of alleged criminal acts occurring between the 1970s and the 1990s which were published in the press and provoked widespread moral outrage within the Malaysian public.|$|E

5|$|McCreary's senate {{term was}} set to expire in 1908, {{the same year as}} Beckham's second term as governor. Desiring {{election}} to the Senate following his gubernatorial term, Beckham persuaded his Democratic allies to choose the party's nominees for governor and senator by a primary election held in 1906 – a year before the gubernatorial election and two years before the senatorial election. This ensured that the primary would occur during his term as governor, when he still wielded significant influence within the party. McCreary now allied himself with J. C. S. Blackburn, Henry Watterson, and other Beckham opponents, and sought to defend his seat in the primary. During the primary campaign, he pointed to his record of dealing with national issues, contrasting it with Beckham's youth and inexperience at the national level. Beckham countered <b>by</b> <b>citing</b> his strong stand in favor of Prohibition, as opposed to McCreary's more moderate position, and by touting his support of a primary election instead of a nominating convention, which he said gave the voters a choice in who would represent them in the Senate. Ultimately, Beckham prevailed in the primary by an 11,000-vote margin, rendering McCreary a lame duck with two years still left in his term.|$|E
5|$|The Spring 2013 Anime Preview Guide {{written by}} Rebecca Silverman, {{also of the}} Anime News Network, {{expressed}} differing sentiments than that of Dong. Silverman was quick to mention {{that she had not}} previously played the game to which the series was based on. With that being said, she described the first episode as not feeling like a game adaptation since you at no point have the sensation of watching someone else play. She also noted that the transformation from the everyday world to one of total chaos and destruction as both swift and impressive. She supported this <b>by</b> <b>citing</b> similar descriptions of the destruction caused by the Great Kantō earthquake of the 1920s. In her full series review, Silverman went into detail about how noticeably dark the series as a whole is when taking into account its animated depictions coupled with the death themes used. Unlike fellow reviewer Bamboo Dong, Silverman felt that character deaths would hit viewers more personally since they get to know them as the story progress and are then suddenly torn down. She further wrote that nearly every character death can potentially pack a punch since they are removed from the ending animation upon their demise. On the other hand, Silverman remarked that some of the characters were truly unlikable as they did not appear to grow and change.|$|E
5|$|The {{cases of}} Taylor and Marshall were {{appealed to the}} Kentucky Court of Appeals, then to the Supreme Court of the United States. In the case of Taylor v. Beckham, Bradley countered Democrats' claims that the federal courts should not have {{jurisdiction}} <b>by</b> <b>citing</b> Thayer v. Boyd, a similar {{case in which the}} court had assumed jurisdiction. He further quoted authorities who opined that an elected office was property, using this to contend that Taylor's rights under the Fourteenth Amendment had been violated, thus giving the court jurisdiction. Also, Bradley asserted, the election of some members of the General Assembly's contest committee would hinge on the decision of that very committee. At least one member of the committee was known to have wagered on the election's outcome. These facts should have nullified the decision of the committee and the Assembly {{on the grounds that it}} had left some members as judges of their own cases, Bradley argued. Finally, Bradley cited irregularities in the proceedings of the contest committee, including giving insufficient time for the review of testimony provided in written form by Taylor and Marshall's legal representation. The court refused to intervene in the case, however, because it found that there were no federal questions involved. The lone justice dissenting from that opinion was Kentuckian John Marshall Harlan.|$|E

5|$|Wade {{writes that}} along with the ongoing social {{evolution}} that occurred after humans left Africa, the human physical form also continued to evolve. This {{is the subject of}} chapter nine, Race; because humans were spread across different continents, and distance and tribal hostility limited gene flow between them, they followed different evolutionary paths. Race is not well understood, he says, because its historical implications cause it to be avoided in modern academic studies. Wade states, however, that there are reasons to reconsider the study of it; the genetic differences between races may give evidence of the different evolutionary pressures they faced, and the differences may be medically relevant. Citing Neil Risch, Wade puts forth that there are five continental races – Africans, Caucasians, Asians, Pacific Islanders and Native Americans – which are made up of smaller subdivisions called ethnicities. He explicitly avoids discussing the cause of IQ differences between races, but hypothesises that racial differences may have an influence on sporting achievement. Chapter ten, Language, concerns the spread and division of languages. Wade believes that all languages ultimately came from an ancestral language, and that many of its descendants – such as Proto-Indo-European – possibly spread through agriculture. <b>By</b> <b>citing</b> linguists such as Joseph Greenberg, Wade shows that almost all of today's languages belong to families, which in turn may belong to superfamilies such as Eurasiatic.|$|E
5|$|When Maxwell {{concluded}} his argument, ex-Governor Bradley {{spoke on}} Taylor's behalf.
