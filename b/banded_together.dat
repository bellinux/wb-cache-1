5|$|The battle site at Kellogg's Grove {{was listed}} on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on June 23, 1978. The listing {{included}} a 1½ acre public park where a stone monument and memorial cemetery is located. The cemetery holds the interred remains of the militia who died during both battles at Kellogg's Grove. The men were initially buried in other spots around the grove but during the 1880s local farmers <b>banded</b> <b>together</b> to collect {{the remains of the}} Black Hawk War dead and inter them in one spot beneath a memorial.|$|E
5|$|The game's {{campaign}} {{begins in}} the spring of 2015, as a global alien invasion begins. Prior {{to the start of the}} game, a group of countries called the Council of Nations has <b>banded</b> <b>together</b> to create XCOM (short for Extraterrestrial Combat Unit), the most elite military and scientific organization in human history, tasked with defending them from the alien attack. The player assumes the role of the commander of XCOM, and proceeds to engage in a war against an extraterrestrial enemy with overwhelming technological superiority.|$|E

However, nothing materialized as they moved to different schools. Pollock met Baty and Cordell at the Oratory School. The pair had been in <b>bands</b> <b>together</b> at their old school so the three decided {{to form a new}} <b>band</b> <b>together.</b> Evans rejoined the band on drums. The band's name is derived from Sanskrit words, meaning [...] "Beautiful Karma".|$|R
50|$|A third form of modern-day {{comedy is}} {{television}} programs {{in which many}} comedians <b>band</b> <b>together</b> to make skits, such as Saturday Night Live.

5|$|Although he {{had left}} Canton, Simão de Andrade landed at Xiamen and Ningbo, {{establishing}} settlements there. Simão continued to defy local Chinese laws at Ningbo, and when his men were cheated on a trade deal with a Chinese man in 1545, Simão sent a band of armed men into the town, pillaged it, and took local women and young girls as their captives. The outraged locals <b>banded</b> <b>together</b> and slaughtered the Portuguese under Simão. A similar episode occurred later when Coelho de Sousa seized {{the house of a}} wealthy foreign resident in Jinzhou of Fujian, which led authorities to cut off supplies to the Portuguese; the Portuguese then attacked and ransacked a nearby village for supplies, which prompted Chinese authorities to destroy thirteen of their ships while thirty Portuguese survivors of this settlement fled to the Portuguese settlement at Macau in 1549.|$|E
5|$|In 1543, several {{conservative}} clergymen in Kent <b>banded</b> <b>together</b> {{to attack}} and denounce two reformers, Richard Turner and John Bland, before the Privy Council. They prepared articles {{to present to}} the Council, but at the last moment, additional denunciations were added by Stephen Gardiner's nephew, Germain Gardiner. These new articles attacked Cranmer and listed his misdeeds back to 1541. This document and the actions that followed were the basis of the so-called Prebendaries' Plot. The articles were delivered to the Council in London and were probably read on 22 April 1543. The king most likely saw the articles against Cranmer that night. The archbishop, however, appeared unaware that an attack on his person was made. His commissioners in Lambeth dealt specifically with Turner's case where he was acquitted, much to the fury of the conservatives.|$|E
5|$|Rosas' early {{administration}} was {{preoccupied with the}} severe deficits, large public debts {{and the impact of}} currency devaluation which his government inherited. A great drought that began in December 1828, which would last until April 1832, greatly impacted the economy. The Unitarians were still at large, controlling several provinces that had <b>banded</b> <b>together</b> in the Unitarian League. The capture of José María Paz, the main Unitarian leader, in March 1831 resulted in the end of the Unitarian–Federalist civil war and the collapse of the Unitarian League. Rosas was content, for the moment, to agree to recognize provincial autonomy in the Federal Pact. In an effort to alleviate the government's financial problems, he improved revenue collection while not raising taxes and curtailed expenditure.|$|E

5|$|Simpson {{opened his}} own chemist shop in Brunswick West in 1918. On 12 August 1919 he married Jean Elizabeth Watson at the Congregational Church in Ascot Vale, Victoria. Their {{marriage}} produced two children, {{a son who}} died in infancy and a daughter, Jean Marjorie. One of the witnesses at their wedding ceremony was a fellow Militia officer, Alan Ramsay, who later married Jean's sister Edna. In 1937, Simpson <b>banded</b> <b>together</b> with D. E. Robertson and A. E. Moore to create the Allied Master Chemists of Australia Ltd, today better known as Amcal. They invited other pharmacists to join them to compete against the growing market power of major retailers. The business grew from 12 members in 1937 to over 100 by 1946. Today Amcal is the largest retail pharmacy chain in Australia.|$|E
5|$|Twelve {{groups of}} farmers and fishermen, {{a total of}} 325 individuals, <b>banded</b> <b>together</b> in the Kampoeng Rawa Association on 4 August 2012. This group was tasked with {{managing}} the new tourist site, which opened, despite construction being incomplete, shortly before Eid al-Fitr (18–19 August). The site was quickly popular, receiving an average of 2,000 visitors a day during the Eid holidays, and became a common location for events held by the local government. In late August 2012, the cost of entry was Rp. 2,500 per person, with an additional parking fee of Rp. 5,000 per car, although various activities were extra. During the four-day Eid al-Fitr holiday in 2013, the attraction received over 14,000 visitors.|$|E
5|$|In Johannesburg in the 1950s, {{crime was}} a day-to-day reality, and Sophiatown was {{the nucleus of}} all reef crimes. Gangsters were city-bred and spoke a mixture of Afrikaans and English, known as tsotsitaal. Some of the more {{well-known}} gangs in Sophiatown were the Russians, the Americans, the Gestapo, the Berliners and the Vultures. The names the Gestapo and the Berliners reflect their admiration for Hitler, whom they saw {{as some kind of}} hero, for taking on the whites of Europe. The best known gang from this period, and also best studied, was the Russians. They were a group of Basotho migrant workers who <b>banded</b> <b>together</b> {{in the absence of any}} effective law enforcement by either mine owners or the state. The primary goal of this gang was to protect members from the tsotsis and from other gangs of migrant workers, and to acquire and defend resources they found desirable - most notably women, jobs and the urban space necessary for the parties and staged fights that formed the bulk of their weekend entertainment.|$|E

5|$|In the United States, {{approximately}} 90 {{percent of}} Burger King's franchises have <b>banded</b> <b>together</b> {{to form the}} Burger King National Franchise Association (BKNFA or NFA). The 900-member group is based in Atlanta, Georgia, and {{is designed to provide}} what the group calls Franchisee Relations Advocacy. It acts as a corporate negotiator that mediates with corporate-franchise disputes, as a government lobbying group to deal with issues that affect the fast-food industry as a whole, and it provides group health, property and casualty insurance. In 2001, the group announced a plan to purchase Burger King from then-parent Diageo after the company put forth a plan to float approximately 20 percent of BKC on the NYSE. The NFA believed that any money raised from the issue would not be put into helping bolster the then flagging BK, but would instead end up being used to help Diageo bolster its liquor brands. The deal collapsed when the NFA was unable to put together an acceptable financing package.|$|E
5|$|The Prayer Book Rebellion {{and other}} events had a {{negative}} effect on the Seymour regency. The Privy Council became divided when a set of dissident Councillors <b>banded</b> <b>together</b> behind John Dudley in order to oust Seymour. Cranmer and two other Councillors, William Paget, and Thomas Smith initially rallied behind Seymour. However, after a flurry of letters passed between the two sides, a bloodless coup d'état resulted in the end of Seymour's Protectorship on 13 October 1549. Despite the support of religiously conservative politicians behind Dudley's coup, the reformers managed to maintain control of the new government and the English Reformation continued to consolidate gains. Seymour was initially imprisoned in the Tower, but he was shortly released on 6 February 1550 and returned to the Council. The archbishop was able to transfer his former chaplain, Nicholas Ridley from the minor see of Rochester to the diocese of London, while John Ponet took Ridley's former position. Incumbent conservatives were uprooted and replaced with reformers.|$|E
5|$|The {{financial}} drain of the Imjin War in Korea {{against the}} Japanese {{was one of}} the many problems – fiscal or other – facing Ming China during the reign of the Wanli Emperor (1572–1620). In the beginning of his reign, Wanli surrounded himself with able advisors and made a conscientious effort to handle state affairs. His Grand Secretary Zhang Juzheng (1572–82) built up an effective network of alliances with senior officials. However, there was no one after him skilled enough to maintain the stability of these alliances; officials soon <b>banded</b> <b>together</b> in opposing political factions. Over time Wanli grew tired of court affairs and frequent political quarreling amongst his ministers, preferring to stay behind the walls of the Forbidden City and out of his officials' sight. Scholar-officials lost prominence in administration as eunuchs became intermediaries between the aloof emperor and his officials; any senior official who wanted to discuss state matters had to persuade powerful eunuchs with a bribe simply to have his demands or message relayed to the emperor.|$|E

5|$|At {{the behest}} of Empress Catherine, Şahin allowed Russians to settle in the peninsula, further infuriating Crimeans. A group of these {{settlers}} {{had been sent to}} Yeni-Kale, which remained under Russian control following the installation of Şahin as Khan. Local residents <b>banded</b> <b>together</b> to prevent the Russian settlement, rebelling against Şahin. He sent the new conscript army he had created to quash the rebellion, only to see his forces defect to the rebels. Revolt spread across the peninsula, and rebel forces advanced on Şahin's palace in Bakhchisaray. Amidst this rebellion, exiled Crimeans in Constantinople pressed the Ottoman government to act. Bowing to pressure, the government sent a fleet to Crimea, ostensibly to preserve the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca. Russia, however, was quicker to act. Russian forces arrived at Yeni-Kale in February 1778, crushing the revolt before the Ottoman fleet arrived. When the fleet arrived in March, it found that there were no rebels left to support. It fought a brief skirmish with the Russian navy off Akitar (modern Sevastopol), but was forced to flee. Şahin was reinstated as Khan. Minor skirmishes between the Ottoman and Russian navies continued until October 1778, when the Ottoman fleet returned defeated to Constantinople.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{significant}} events of Darius's early reign was the slaying of Intaphernes, {{one of the seven}} noblemen who had deposed the previous ruler and installed Darius as the new monarch. The seven had made an agreement that they could all visit the new king whenever they pleased, except when he was with his wife. One evening, Intaphernes went to the palace to meet Darius, but was stopped by two officers who stated that Darius had retired for the night. Becoming enraged and insulted, Intaphernes drew his sword and cut off the ears and noses of the two officers. While leaving the palace, he took the bridle from his horse, and tied the two officers together. The officers went to the king and showed him what Intaphernes had done to them. Darius began to fear for his own safety; he thought that all seven noblemen had <b>banded</b> <b>together</b> to rebel against him and that the attack against his officers was the first sign of revolt. He sent a messenger to each of the noblemen, asking them if they approved of Intaphernes's actions. They denied and disavowed any connection with Intaphernes's actions, stating that they stood by their decision to appoint Darius as King of Kings.|$|E
