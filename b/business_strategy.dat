40|$|ABSTRACT: This study {{examines}} whether <b>business</b> <b>strategies</b> and {{accounting information systems}} change the way businesses compete and investigates the influences of <b>business</b> <b>strategies</b> and accounting information systems upon the assessment of firm performance. This study also uses Michael Porter’s classic model of competition {{as an example of}} <b>business</b> <b>strategies</b> that can be developed as a research model. In addition, firm performance evaluation factors are also considered. Data from accountants, who work in various business firms were collected, analyzed, and evaluated. The statistical analysis used in this study is Pearson correlation analysis. The results indicate that <b>business</b> <b>strategies</b> and accounting information systems increase firm performance. <b>Business</b> <b>strategies</b> will be more successful if Organizations have adequate and more reliable, advanced AISs. Both <b>business</b> <b>strategies</b> and AIS can change the culture and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of firm performance. The results suggest firms will increase operational efficiency, cut costs, add business value to themselves, reduce operating budgets, reduce the costs of help desk and customer services, increase revenue, increase services to customers, reach target customers, and provide added value for customers with e-business systems...|$|R

Continued <b>business</b> <b>strategy</b> change saw further departures from Head Office in brand communication and PR and a renewed agency contract for Waterstones’ digital marketing with Epiphany. The retailer overhauled its business technology with new algorithms on its website to help personalise the online shopping experience, updated point-of-sale IT and by introducing contactless payment in its stores. The retailer partnered with Airbnb to hold a one-off ‘sleepover’ for customers in its Piccadilly branch in October 2014 after a customer was accidentally trapped in the Trafalgar Square branch after closing. Accounts for 2014 saw operating income losses narrow to £3.8 million, but sales slip by 5.9%.|$|E

By taking selected manufacturing MSEs that operate in various small industrial clusters in East Java, Indonesia, this research examined the relationships between the inter-firm linkages and <b>business</b> <b>strategies</b> applied simultaneously by MSEs and their impacts on the firm’s performance. Viewed from the perspective of a co-opetition strategy, the results of this study revealed that some types of inter-firm linkages and <b>business</b> <b>strategies</b> matter for the MSEs’ performance. However, within small industrial clusters, inter-firm linkages seem to be less effective compared to <b>business</b> <b>strategies</b> in affecting a firm’s performance...|$|R
