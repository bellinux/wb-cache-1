5|$|This {{problem is}} not {{exclusive}} to electric vehicles. In 2007 research at the Technical University Munich showed that ordinary vehicles in <b>background</b> <b>noise</b> are often detected too late for safe accident avoidance. The researchers measured the distances of 35 approaching vehicles to a pedestrian in the moment when they just got audible in a stationary <b>background</b> <b>noise.</b> These distances were then compared to the stopping distances of the respective cars and an algorithm was proposed to estimate them based on auditory masking.|$|E
5|$|In 1938 for a dance {{composition}} titled Bacchanale, John Cage {{invented the}} prepared piano, producing both transformed pitches and colorful unpitched {{sounds from the}} piano. Many variations, such as prepared guitar, have followed. In 1952, Cage wrote 4′33″, {{in which there is}} no deliberate sound at all, but only whatever <b>background</b> <b>noise</b> occurs during the performance.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, {{electronic}} {{white noise}} machines became commercially available. These are used alone {{to provide a}} pleasant <b>background</b> <b>noise</b> and to mask unpleasant noise, a similar role to conventional background music. This usage can have health applications {{in the case of}} individuals struggling with over-stimulation or sensory processing disorder. Also, white noise is sometimes used to mask sudden noise in facilities with research animals.|$|E
40|$|Abstract- Acoustical <b>noises</b> or <b>background</b> <b>noises</b> {{degrade the}} quality and {{intelligibility}} of the speech signal. The <b>background</b> <b>noises</b> are random in nature {{and it is important}} to classify such <b>noises.</b> Hence <b>background</b> <b>noises</b> are characterised based on statistical properties like mean, variance,co-variance etc. The autocorrelation function which is a time invariant function is used for classifying such noises. The SNR for various noises is estimated...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} the mismatch between a silence model and <b>background</b> <b>noises</b> which often occurs in a telephone speech recognition system (SRS) application. At first, the use of parallel model combination (PMC) methods is studied with the respect to this application. Secondly, the effective adaptation of a silence model to various <b>background</b> <b>noises</b> is confirmed. Finally, an original method combining log-add PMC with a noise power spectral density estimation based on minimum statistics is proposed. The performed tests prove the benefit of the suggested method to the speech recognition results that is caused by the stability of speech vector selection under the influence of various <b>background</b> <b>noises.</b> The advantages can be seen in no extra voice activity detector and in a relatively low computational load...|$|R
5|$|In the end, four {{broadband}} filters were chosen, centred at wavelengths of 300 nm (near-ultraviolet), 450nm (blue light), 606nm (red light) and 814nm (near-infrared). Because the quantum efficiency of Hubble's detectors is quite low at 300nm, the noise in observations at this wavelength is {{primarily due to}} CCD noise rather than sky background; thus, these observations could be conducted at times when high <b>background</b> <b>noise</b> would have harmed the efficiency of observations in other passbands.|$|E
5|$|Since Voyager 2s fly-by, the {{brightest}} rings (Adams and Le Verrier) have been imaged with the Hubble Space Telescope and Earth-based telescopes, owing to advances in resolution and light-gathering power. They are visible, slightly above <b>background</b> <b>noise</b> levels, at methane-absorbed wavelengths {{in which the}} glare from Neptune is significantly reduced. The fainter rings are still far below the visibility threshold.|$|E

Owing to <b>background</b> <b>noise</b> such as camera operation, much of the ambient noise or dialogue captured on set was unusable; it was Serafine's job to create or recreate sounds to mix back into the scenes.|$|E

5|$|Black convinces Birckenbeuhl {{to confess}} {{publicly}} to the hit-and-run, {{in order to}} have his son returned. Birckenbeuhl does so, but continues to maintain his innocence in private. Charlie is not returned, however; instead, a cassette is sent to Birckenbuehl by the killer, who explains that since Birckenbeuhl took a life, one must be taken from him in return. Black is able to deduce from the <b>background</b> <b>noise</b> on the tape that Charlie is being held near the local high school's swimming pool.

5|$|Soldiers at {{the base}} noticed warning signs, {{including}} groups of men watching the construction from the nearby village, which was set at a higher elevation than the outpost, and other groups of men moving through nearby mountains. At a dinner meeting in the village, a villager told the Americans that they should shoot any men seen in the mountains, and asked them if U.S. UAVs were keeping watch nearby. The day before the attack, the militants began flowing water through an irrigation ditch feeding an unused field, creating <b>background</b> <b>noise</b> that masked {{the sounds of the}} advancing fighters.|$|E
5|$|A concern {{from people}} living along the tunnel {{was that they}} would be subject to low-frequency noise. Originally the {{municipalities}} of Asker and Bærum had demanded that residents be subject to a maximum of 27 decibel A-weighting (dBA), but the National Rail Administration appealed the requirements and was permitted to allow up to 32 dBA. In March 2004, a test was done in the tunnel to insure that the requirements would be met, as low-frequency sound is difficult to predict. Measurements after the opening of the tunnel showed <b>background</b> <b>noise</b> of 30 dBA, that no-one was subject to 32 dBA or higher, and that it was nearly impossible to measure the passing of trains.|$|E

5|$|Later, between 2009 and 2011, {{another team}} of astronomers {{observed}} WASP-13b and WASP-21b {{to find what}} caused some Hot Jupiters to have anomalously high radii. The RISE photometric camera on the Liverpool Telescope was used to detect further transits. Two partial transits and two full transits were observed during this period, although the quality of both full transits was slightly compromised because of passing cloud cover. The collected observations, along with the JGT observations {{that were used to}} confirm the planet, were scaled to filter out errors such as <b>background</b> <b>noise.</b> The data was then used to re-define WASP-13b's parameters, including its age, mass, radius, and density. The study also noted that a limb darkening effect was present, a characteristic that may affect future atmospheric studies of the planet.|$|E
5|$|The {{system has}} {{two types of}} receivers: radio terminals, which can either be {{hand-held}} or mounted in vehicles, and desktop equipment for control centers. The system will include 40,000 radios throughout the country. Compared to the analog network, the digital radio equipment will be smaller and have options for additional equipment such as hands free, and allow special radios for motorcycles, snowmobiles, boats, undercover activities and smoke diving. Communication can either be performed as one-to-one conversations, group calls for predefined or ad-hoc groups, with radios able {{to be part of}} several groups, or as walkie talkies in areas without network coverage. The digital transmission reduced <b>background</b> <b>noise</b> and allows monitoring terminal identity to prohibit unauthorized use. All radios are equipped with an emergency button that will give priority in the network.|$|E
5|$|While the Carthaginians were in {{the process}} of {{defeating}} the cavalry, the masses of infantry on both sides advanced towards each other in the center of the field. The wind from the east blew dust in the Romans' faces and obscured their vision. While the wind was not a major factor, the dust that both armies created would have been potentially debilitating to sight. Although it made seeing difficult, troops would still have been able to see others in the vicinity. The dust, however, was not the only psychological factor involved in battle. Because of the somewhat distant battle location, both sides were forced to fight on little sleep. Another Roman disadvantage was thirst caused by Hannibal's attack on the Roman encampment during the previous day. Furthermore, the massive number of troops would have led to an overwhelming amount of <b>background</b> <b>noise.</b> All of these psychological factors made battle especially difficult for the infantrymen.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in 1966, Khrushchev {{began his}} memoirs. He {{dictated}} {{them into a}} tape recorder and recorded indoors, after attempts failed to record outdoors due to <b>background</b> <b>noise,</b> knowing that every word would be heard by the KGB. However, the security agency {{made no attempt to}} interfere until 1968, when Khrushchev was ordered to turn over his tapes, which he refused to do. Khrushchev was hospitalized with heart ailments when his son Sergei was approached by the KGB and told that there was a plot afoot by foreign agents to steal the memoirs. Sergei Khrushchev turned over the materials to the KGB since the KGB could steal the originals anyway, but copies had been made, some of which had been transmitted to a Western publisher. Sergei instructed that the smuggled memoirs should be published, which they were in 1970 under the title Khrushchev Remembers. Under some pressure, Nikita Khrushchev signed a statement that he had not given the materials to any publisher, and his son was transferred to a less desirable job. Upon publication of the memoirs in the West, Izvestia denounced them as a fraud. Soviet state radio carried the announcement of Khrushchev's statement, {{and it was the first}} time in six years that he had been mentioned in that medium. In the Great Soviet Encyclopedia, Khrushchev was given a short characterization: ″In his activities, there were elements of subjectivism and voluntarism".|$|E

40|$|Abstract: <b>Background</b> optical <b>noises</b> {{generated}} by the conventional fluorescent light sources or AC-power light-emitting diode (LED) can significantly affect {{the performance of the}} LED optical wireless communication and produce challenges to implementation.

The theory and analysis of the equalization are presented. Experiments at different data rates and different OFDM subcarriers are preformed, and results show that, by adjusting the number of OFDM subcarriers, the influence of the <b>background</b> optical <b>noises</b> can be significantly circumvented.

40|$|The {{properties}} of the time domain parameters of vibration signals have been extensively studied for the fault diagnosis of rolling element bearings (REBs). Parameters like kurtosis and Envelope Harmonic-to-Noise Ratio are the most widely applied in this field and some important progress has been made. However, since only one-sided information is contained in these parameters, problems still exist in practice when the signals collected are of complicated structure and/or contaminated by strong <b>background</b> <b>noises.</b> A new parameter, named Shock Pulse Index (SPI), is proposed in this paper. It integrates the mutual advantages of both the parameters mentioned above and can help effectively identify fault-related impulse components under conditions of interference of strong <b>background</b> <b>noises,</b> unrelated harmonic components and random impulses. The SPI optimizes the parameters of Maximum Correlated Kurtosis Deconvolution (MCKD), {{which is used to}} filter the signals under consideration. Finally, the transient information of interest contained in the filtered signal can be highlighted through demodulation with the Teager Energy Operator (TEO). Fault-related impulse components can therefore be extracted accurately. Simulations show the SPI can correctly indicate the fault impulses under the influence of strong <b>background</b> <b>noises,</b> other harmonic components and aperiodic impulse and experiment analyses verify the effectiveness and correctness of the proposed method...|$|R
