5|$|According to legend, the Roman King Servius Tullius {{enacted a}} series of {{constitutional}} reforms in the 6th century BC. One of these reforms resulted {{in the creation of}} a new organizational unit with which to divide citizens.

In 471 BC, a law was passed which allowed the Plebeians to begin organizing by Tribe. Before this point, they had organized on the <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Curia. The only difference between the Plebeian Council after 471 BC and the ordinary Tribal Assembly (which also organized on the <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tribes) was that the Tribes of the Plebeian Council only included Plebeians, whereas the Tribes of the Tribal Assembly included both Plebeians and Patricians.|$|E
