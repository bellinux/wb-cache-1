This has been demonstrated in Noxilizer’s lab in multiple studies and is supported by published reports from other labs. These same properties also allow for quicker removal of the sterilant and residuals through aeration of the enclosed environment. The combination of rapid lethality and easy removal of the gas allows for shorter overall cycle times during the sterilization (or decontamination) process and a lower level of sterilant residuals than are found with other sterilization methods.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: The need of {{effective}} sterilization method and their monitoring is necessary. <b>Biological</b> <b>indicators</b> are specific microorganisms with high resistance toward particular sterilization methods. Their processes include steam autoclave, dry heat sterilizer, ethylene oxide sterilizer. This article has considered various methods {{to monitor the}} effectiveness of different sterilization methods used in orthodontics. Materials and Methods: The parameters for comparison were the control and experimental instruments utilized in orthodontic treatment. The efficacy of sterilization was evaluated by comparison of bacterial growth obtained in monitoring by <b>biological</b> <b>indicators</b> and swab test method. Results: No spore growth was found when sterilization process was evaluated by <b>biological</b> <b>indicators</b> in comparison to swab test where spore growth was present. Instruments dipped in Bioclenz-G solution for 10 min showed spore growth, but no spore growth was seen in 10 h cycle. Discussion: The result of the study verifies the established effectiveness of <b>biological</b> <b>indicators</b> over conventional swab test method in monitoring various sterilization processes used in orthodontics. Bioclenz-G solution {{can be used as}} an effective cold sterilization method for sterilization. Conclusion: For evaluating the effectiveness of sterilization, <b>biological</b> <b>indicators</b> preclude the drawbacks of incomplete verification of destruction of all vegetation and inordinate delay in procurement of results {{as is the case with}} chemical indicators and lab culture, respectively...|$|R

50|$|Macroinvertebrate Community Index (MCI) is {{an index}} used in New Zealand {{to measure the}} water quality of fresh water streams.

50|$|A <b>Biological</b> <b>Indicator</b> Evaluation Resistometer or BIER vessel is a {{piece of}} {{equipment}} used to determine the time taken to reduce a bioload by 90% (also known as a log 1 reduction). The name derives from how the equipment is used. A BIER vessel evaluates the resistance of biological indicators to moist heat (steam) sterilization. For example, if a 90% reduction is determined to be 5 minutes for the microorganism being evaluated, then a D-value of 5 is assigned. D values are specific to starting bioload, substrate (the material the spores are on) and microbe species.BIER vessels typically cost in excess of $100 000US and therefore tend to be located where biological indicators are manufactured.|$|E

50|$|Geobacillus stearothermophilus (basonym Bacillus stearothermophilus) is a rod-shaped, Gram-positive {{bacterium}} and {{a member}} of the division Firmicutes. The bacterium is a thermophile and is widely distributed in soil, hot springs, ocean sediment, and is a cause of spoilage in food products. It will grow within a temperature range of 30-75 degrees Celsius. Some strains are capable of oxidizing carbon monoxide aerobically. It is commonly used as a challenge organism for sterilization validation studies and periodic check of sterilization cycles. The <b>biological</b> <b>indicator</b> contains spores of the organism on filter paper inside a vial. After sterilizing, the cap is closed, an ampule of growth medium inside of the vial is crushed and the whole vial is incubated. A color and/or turbidity change indicates the results of the sterilization process; no change indicates that the sterilization conditions were achieved, otherwise the growth of the spores indicates that the sterilization process has not been met. Recently a fluorescent-tagged strain, Rapid Readout(tm), is being used for verifying sterilization, since the visible blue fluorescence appears in about one-tenth the time needed for pH-indicator color change, and an inexpensive light sensor can detect the growing colonies.|$|E

50|$|Art {{containing}} geometric forms, {{as seen in}} much of Islamic art, has {{an inherent}} symmetry to the work. This symmetry can be correlated to the attractiveness associated with the art form, since there is a correlation between human preference and symmetry. In studies regarding facial attractiveness, symmetry {{is found to be}} a significant factor as well as the shape and coloration in determining attractiveness. The good genes hypothesis for symmetry preference argues that symmetry is a <b>biological</b> <b>indicator</b> of stable development, mate quality and fitness and therefore explains why we choose symmetrical traits in our mates. The good genes hypothesis does not, however, explain why this phenomenon is observed in our preferences for decoration art. Another proposed hypothesis is the extended phenotype hypothesis that argues that decoration art is not mate-irrelevant but rather a reflection of the fitness of the artist, as symmetrical forms are difficult to produce. These hypothesis and findings provide evidence for evolutionary biases on preference for symmetry and as reinforcement for cultural biases. Research suggests that symmetrical preference due to its evolutionary basis, biological basis and cultural reinforcement, might be replicable cross-culturally.|$|E
5000|$|A woman's {{lips are}} also a visible {{expression}} of her fertility. In studies performed on the science of human attraction, psychologists have concluded that a woman's facial and sexual attractiveness is {{closely linked to the}} makeup of her hormones during puberty and development. Contrary to the effects of testosterone on a man's facial structure, the effects of a woman's oestrogen levels serve to maintain a relatively [...] "childlike" [...] and youthful facial structure during puberty and during final maturation. It has been shown that the more oestrogen a woman has, the larger her eyes and the fuller her lips, characteristics which are perceived as more feminine. [...] Surveys performed by sexual psychologists have also found that universally, men find a woman's full lips to be more sexually attractive than lips that are less so. A woman's lips are therefore sexually attractive to males because they serve as a <b>biological</b> <b>indicator</b> of a woman's health and fertility. A woman's lipstick (or collagen lip enhancement) attempts {{to take advantage of this}} fact by creating the illusion that a woman has more oestrogen than she actually has, and thus that she is more fertile and attractive.|$|E

40|$|Objectives. In dental offices, {{sterilization}} {{of instruments}} {{is one of}} the most important aspects of infection control. Autoclave effectiveness in killing microorganisms can be verified by spore tests. The purpose of this study was to investigate the sterilization procedures of private dental offices in Hong Kong, and to test the effectiveness of their autoclaves using <b>biological</b> <b>indicators.</b> Methods. Packages of an 18 -item questionnaire and two <b>biological</b> <b>indicators</b> were sent to 402 private dental practices in Hong Kong. They were instructed to complete the questionnaire, and perform a spore test in their autoclave using the <b>biological</b> <b>indicators</b> and return them for incubation. Results. One hundred and eighty-two practices responded, with a response rate of 45 %. Excluding three imcomplete questionnaires and four practices using dry heat oven, a total of 175 autoclaves were tested. Thirteen (7 %) of the autoclaves failed the initial spore test. Twelve of these practices performed a re-test, whereupon two (1 %) of the autoclaves failed again. Among these 175 autoclaves, 77 (44 %) were the Fuji Elite model. The commonest (n= 72; 41 %) packing material and method entailed sterilization pouches. Twenty-three (13 %) of the respondents used improper sterilization time/temperature conditions for processing the instruments. For autoclaves older than 1 year, only 38 % (n= 58) had been serviced in the last year. One hundred and nine (62 %) of the respondents used chemical indicators and only seven (4 %) used <b>biological</b> <b>indicators</b> to monitor sterilization. Conclusion. Autoclaves in private dental practice in Hong Kong should be regularly checked, and their effectiveness routinely monitored. The use of <b>biological</b> <b>indicators</b> to monitor the sterilization was uncommon and knowledge about proper autoclaves usage needs improving. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R
