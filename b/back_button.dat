25|$|The {{location}} {{being viewed}} (the current directory) {{can be changed}} by the user by opening directories, pressing a <b>back</b> <b>button,</b> typing a location, or using the additional pane with the navigation tree representing {{all or part of}} the filesystem.|$|E
25|$|Another {{major change}} to the Start menu in Windows Vista is {{that it no longer}} {{presents}} the All programs menu as a horizontally expanding cascading list which utilizes the entire screen space, but instead as a nested folder view with a fixed size. The list of submenus and single items appears over the left column contents with a <b>Back</b> <b>button</b> below it. Subfolders expand and collapse vertically within the list when single-clicked, in a tree-like fashion similar to Windows Explorer. Single items appear at the top and folders appear at the bottom. Hovering the mouse over a folder does not open it; the folder needs to be clicked. A limitation of the new Start menu is that subfolders inside the All Programs menu cannot be opened simply by searching or double clicking. Also, as more programs are installed, a vertical scroll bar appears between the two columns. A dynamically changing icon showing the user's display picture by default is present {{at the top of the}} right column. It changes as users hover over any other item to reflect that item's icon. The Power button's action is configurable through Power options in the Control Panel, though the default setting is to put the computer into Sleep mode. Users can quickly lock their user account by pressing the Lock button. Additional power and account related actions are listed in a sub-menu which appears when the small arrow next to the Lock button is clicked.|$|E

500|$|Players {{can switch}} between the [...] "classic" [...] {{graphics}} {{of the original}} game and new graphics developed for the remake by pressing the <b>Back</b> <b>button</b> on the controller. The classic and new graphics are presented in high-definition, [...] widescreen compared to the original game's 480i resolution and [...] aspect ratio. The remastered graphics are also available in stereoscopic 3D for compatible televisions.|$|E
500|$|Windows 10 is {{designed}} to adapt its user interface based {{on the type of}} device being used and available input methods. It offers two separate user interface modes: a user interface optimized for mouse and keyboard, and a [...] "Tablet mode" [...] designed for touchscreens. Users can toggle between these two modes at any time, and Windows can prompt or automatically switch when certain events occur, such as disabling Tablet mode on a tablet if a keyboard or mouse is plugged in, or when a 2-in-1 PC is switched to its laptop state. In Tablet mode, programs default to a maximized view, and the taskbar contains a <b>back</b> <b>button</b> and hides buttons for opened or pinned programs; Task View is used instead to switch between programs. The full screen Start menu is used in this mode, similarly to Windows 8, but scrolls vertically instead of horizontally.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{web design}} {{tutorials}} {{also point out}} that client-side redirecting tends to interfere with the normal functioning of a Web browser's [...] "back" [...] button. After being redirected, clicking the <b>back</b> <b>button</b> will cause the user {{to go back to the}} redirect page, which redirects them again. Some modern browsers seem to overcome this problem however, including Safari, Mozilla Firefox and Opera.|$|E

60|$|We {{went to see}} John Knox's house, and {{although}} Mr. Knox was pretty hard on vanities and frivolities, he didn't mind having a good house over his head, with woodwork {{on the walls and}} ceilings that wasn't any more necessary than the <b>back</b> <b>buttons</b> on his coat.|$|R
2500|$|The {{address bar}} has been {{modified}} {{to present a}} breadcrumbs view, which shows the full path to the current location. Clicking any location in the path hierarchy takes the user to that level, instead of repeatedly pressing the <b>Back</b> <b>button</b> or pressing the up button. This is roughly analogous to what is possible prior to Windows Vista by pressing the small down-arrow next to [...] "Back" [...] and selecting any folder {{from a list of}} previously accessed folders. It makes the [...] "Up One Level" [...] button obsolete so that is removed. It is also possible to navigate to any subfolder of the current folder using the arrow {{to the right of the}} last item, or to click in the space to the right of this to copy or edit the path manually. As with many other Microsoft-made Windows Vista applications, the menu bar is hidden by default. Pressing the Alt key makes the menu bar appear. Free and used space on all drives is shown in horizontal indicator bars. Check boxes allow the selection of multiple files. When items are grouped, clicking the group header selects all items under that group. Multiple groups of files can also be selected by clicking the group headers while holding down Ctrl.|$|E

50|$|The default {{icons and}} icon layout for Firefox 3 also changed dramatically, {{taking on a}} keyhole shape for the forward and <b>back</b> <b>buttons</b> by default {{on two of the}} three platforms. However, the keyhole shape does not take effect in Linux or in the small-icon mode. The Iconfactory created the icons for the Microsoft Windows platform. In addition, {{separate}} icons sets are displayed for Windows XP and Vista.|$|R

60|$|Immediately after, {{and while}} they were busy with a dark closet, Mrs Davis slipped quietly out of the room. Mr Sharp was stooping at the time with his back towards her, but the two <b>back</b> <b>buttons</b> of his coat must have been eyes, for he {{observed}} the movement and at once followed her, having previously ordered Mr Davis to move a heavy chest of drawers, {{in order to keep}} him employed. Taking off his shoes he went up-stairs rapidly, and seeing an open door, peeped in.|$|R
50|$|Continuations simplify {{and clarify}} the {{implementation}} of several common design patterns, including coroutines/green threads and exception handling, by providing the basic, low-level primitive which unifies these seemingly unconnected patterns. Continuations can provide elegant solutions to some difficult high-level problems, like programming a web server that supports multiple pages, accessed {{by the use of}} the forward and <b>back</b> <b>buttons</b> and by following links. The Smalltalk Seaside web framework uses continuations to great effect, allowing one to program the web server in procedural style, by switching continuations when switching pages.|$|R

40|$|As {{a simple}} model for {{browsing}} the World Wide Web, we consider Markov chains with {{the option of}} moving “back ” to the previous state. We develop an algorithm which uses <b>back</b> <b>buttons</b> to achieve essentially any limiting distribution on the state space. This corresponds to spending the desired total fraction of time at each web page. On finite state spaces, our algorithm always succeeds. On infinite state spaces the situation is more complicated, and is related to both the tail behaviour of the distributions, and the properties of convolution equations...|$|R
60|$|Charmian {{found her}} sitting {{with the letter}} in her lap, {{as if she had}} not moved from her posture while she had been away exchanging her Ptolemaic travesty for the ease of a long silken morning gown of Nile green. She came <b>back</b> <b>buttoning</b> it at her throat, when she gave a start of high tragic {{satisfaction}} at something stonily rigid in Cornelia's attitude, but she kept to herself both her satisfaction and the poignant sympathy she felt at the same time, and sank noiselessly into a chair by the fireless hearth.|$|R

50|$|Another {{technology}} included {{is called}} JogAssist, {{which gives the}} user {{more control over the}} Palm OS by using the Jog wheel. It can be set so that when the Jog wheel's <b>back</b> <b>button</b> is held down for a few seconds, it will show a cursor over the on-screen elements and allow the user to modify them without using the stylus. Holding the <b>back</b> <b>button</b> for slightly longer instead selects the Palm OS menu from the current application, which can also be augmented with up to 3 shortcuts to regularly used tasks from: Power Off, Applications, Keyboard, Calc, Find, Backlight or Brightness.|$|E
50|$|The Xbox One console has {{a revised}} {{controller}} with forty improvements over the 360's controller. This new controller is built {{to work with}} Kinect. The Start and <b>Back</b> <b>buttons</b> are replaced with Menu and View buttons. It has impulse triggers that replace the regular triggers. The button with the Xbox logo will no longer bring up the Xbox Guide as the Xbox Guide Button on the Xbox 360 controller did. The button will now open up the dashboard without interrupting the game currently being played by the user. Once pressed again, the Xbox will resume the game.|$|R
5000|$|The iPod's {{control wheel}} {{functions}} change slightly during a workout. The Pause button now not only pauses the music {{but also the}} workout. Similarly, the Menu button is used to access the controls to end the workout. The Forward and <b>Back</b> <b>buttons</b> are unchanged, performing audio track skip and reverse functions. The Center button has two functions: audio feedback about the current distance, time, and pace are provided when the button is tapped once, while if the button is held down the iPod skips to the [...] "PowerSong" [...] - an audio track chosen by the user, generally intended for motivation.|$|R
5000|$|Seaside's {{implementation}} of continuations was an initial {{point of interest}} in its first several years of existence following its 2002 release. Continuations provide a mechanism for rollback and resumption; a useful provision for the web browser environment in which refresh and <b>back</b> <b>buttons</b> may interrupt the flow of processing. Continuation servers give the developer the ability to maintain state on the server in a scalable manner. The subsequent improvement of web browser implementations of JavaScript since 2002 has made the continuations aspect of Seaside less significant, by allowing client browsers to better keep track of state.|$|R
