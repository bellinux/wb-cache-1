5|$|Album art and promotional {{pictures}} from the period showed Smith looking cleaned-up and put-together. An extensive tour in promotion of the record ensued, book-ended by television appearances on Late Night with Conan O'Brien and the Late Show with David Letterman. However, Smith's condition began to deteriorate as he had <b>become</b> <b>addicted</b> to heroin either {{towards the end of}} or just after the Figure 8 tour.|$|E
5|$|Suffering {{withdrawal}} syndrome from {{the lack of}} cable, Peter straps a television-sized cardboard cutout to himself, making it appear as though his whole world is actually a television programme. When Meg can no longer deal with the public scorn, she reveals that her father is really responsible for Quahog's loss of television, causing the town to turn against him. In an attempt to save Peter from further scorn and verbal attacks, Lois gives a heartfelt speech to the community about how television has kept them all from enjoying one another. Inspired by the speech, Peter drags the family to one outdoor activity after another, which quickly exhausts them. Once the family can no longer keep up with him, Peter decides to go off with William Shatner, who has appeared on the Griffin family doorstep after experiencing a flat tire, to a nearby festival. Meanwhile, Stewie's weather machine creates a huge rainstorm. The storm's lightning strike destroys Stewie's weather machine and blows Stewie off the roof and on the ground. While Meg is practicing driving with Lois, the storm causes her to accidentally hit Shatner and Peter, killing Shatner and hospitalizing Peter. As her father recovers, in a full-body cast, he is forced to watch television, causing him to <b>become</b> <b>addicted</b> once again, much to his family's relief.|$|E
5|$|Brezhnev's {{personality}} cult {{was growing}} outrageously {{at a time}} when his health was in rapid decline. His physical condition was deteriorating; he was a lifelong heavy smoker, he had <b>become</b> <b>addicted</b> to sleeping pills, and had begun drinking to excess. Over the years he had become overweight. From 1973 until his death, Brezhnev's central nervous system underwent chronic deterioration and he had several minor strokes as well as insomnia. In 1975 he suffered his first heart attack. When receiving the Order of Lenin, Brezhnev walked shakily and fumbled his words. According to one American intelligence expert, United States officials knew for several years that Brezhnev had suffered from severe arteriosclerosis and believed he had suffered from other unspecified ailments as well. In 1977 American intelligence officials publicly suggested that Brezhnev had also been suffering from gout, leukemia and emphysema. He was reported to have been fitted with a pacemaker to control his heart rhythm abnormalities. Yevgeniy Chazov, the Chief of the Fourth Directorate of the Ministry of Health, had to keep doctors by Brezhnev's side at all times, and Brezhnev was brought back from near-death on several occasions. At this time, most senior officers of the CPSU wanted to keep Brezhnev alive, even if such men as Mikhail Suslov, Dmitriy Ustinov and Andrei Gromyko, among others, were growing increasingly frustrated with his policies. They did not want to risk a new period of domestic turmoil that might be caused by his death. At about this time First World commentators started guessing Brezhnev's heirs apparent. The most notable candidates were Suslov and Andrei Kirilenko, who were both older than Brezhnev, and Fyodor Kulakov and Konstantin Chernenko, who were younger; Kulakov died of natural causes in 1978.|$|E

25|$|After the sacking of Glubb Pasha, {{which he}} saw as a grievous blow to British influence, Eden became {{consumed}} with an obsessional hatred for Nasser, and from March 1956 onwards, was in private committed to the overthrow of Nasser. The American historian Donald Neff wrote that Eden's often hysterical and overwrought views towards Nasser almost certainly reflected {{the influence of the}} amphetamines to which Eden had <b>become</b> <b>addicted</b> following a botched operation in 1953 together with the related effects of sustained sleep deprivation (Eden slept on average about 5 hours per night in early 1956).|$|E
25|$|A second lawsuit, also filed as a class-action, was {{initiated}} against Valve, Martin, Cassel, and CSGO Lotto by a Florida mother in July 2016 {{shortly after the}} CSGO Lotto discovery. This suit states that Valve enables gambling by minors and users such as Martin and Cassel promote this, all considered illegal activities under federal racketeering laws and Florida consumer protection laws. ESPN outlined the story of Elijah Ballard, one of the 44 plaintiffs in the case, who had <b>become</b> <b>addicted</b> to skins gambling when he was twelve years old, using his parents' credit cards and bank accounts to purchase skins.|$|E

On September 4, during an engagement at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, he decided to quit touring, and the concerts there were curtailed. On December 3, the Carpenters were scheduled to play at the Pacific Terrace Theatre, Long Beach Convention Center, {{which turned out to be}} the last live concert that Karen and Richard played together. Richard refused to fly to the UK for an appearance on ITV's Bruce Forsyth's Big Night, realizing he had a serious problem, so Karen performed without him and denied rumors that the duo were to split.|$|E
25|$|Although Dahmer was doted upon as {{an infant}} and toddler by both parents, his mother {{was known to be}} tense, greedy for attention, and {{argumentative}} with her husband and their neighbors. As her son entered first grade, Joyce Dahmer began to spend an increasing amount of her time in bed recovering from weakness. Lionel's university studies kept him away from home much of the time; when he was home, his wife demanded constant attention. She reportedly would work herself into a state of anxiety over trivial matters simply to achieve appeasement from her husband. On one occasion, Joyce Dahmer attempted suicide from an overdose of the Equanil pills to which she had <b>become</b> <b>addicted.</b> Consequently, neither parent devoted much time to their son.|$|E

Low discovers a pyramid that houses a preserved alien, {{whom he is}} able to reanimate by use of the life crystals. Through Robbins, the alien explains that his species had become obsessed with eternal life and had decided to travel to a new universe, Spacetime Six, from the current one, which they call Spacetime Four. The alien chose to remain behind to warn others about the crystals and the dangers of transcending to Spacetime Six. However, the rest of the species have been unable {{to find a way to}} return to Spacetime Four, and only they would be able to provide the humans with a spacecraft to return to Earth.|$|E

He played with Preston in 1986, was cleared to Box Hill at the start of 1987, and was cleared to Brunswick in July 1988.|$|R
25|$|Some time later, Donna (revealed to {{be another}} false name) converses with a fellow police officer, Mike, and the {{audience}} learns that New-Path {{is responsible for the}} manufacture and distribution of Substance D; ironically they use victims of the drug to tend their crops, since (being nearly mindless) they can be trusted not to reveal New-Path's secret. Donna expresses her growing ethical aversion to their police work, in which they deliberately selected Arctor—without his knowledge—to <b>become</b> <b>addicted</b> to Substance D all along; his health was sacrificed so that he might eventually enter a New-Path rehabilitation center unnoticed as a genuine addict and collect incriminating evidence of New-Path's Substance D farms. Donna and Mike debate whether Arctor's mind will recover enough so that he grasps the situation and returns from serving his sentence with substantial evidence to shut down New-Path.|$|E
25|$|Children {{are also}} used in drug trades in all regions of the world. Specifically, {{children}} are often trafficked into exploitation as either drug couriers or dealers, and then 'paid' in drugs, such that they <b>become</b> <b>addicted</b> and further entrapped. Due to the illicit nature of drug trafficking, children who are apprehended are often treated as criminals, when in reality they are often the ones in need of legal assistance. While comprehensive worldwide statistics regarding the prevalence of this practice are unknown, several useful regional studies have been conducted. For example, the I.L.O has recently investigated the use of Afghan children in the heroin trade and child involvement {{in the drug trade}}s of Brazil. Scholar Luke Dowdney specifically studied children in the drug trade in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; he found that children involved in the drug trades are at significantly higher risk of engaging in violence, particularly murder.|$|E
25|$|Maerth {{asserted}} that the eating of brain produces an aphrodisiac effect (presumably due to the vast amount of hormones in it), and that this initially caused apes to <b>become</b> <b>addicted</b> to them, organizing brain hunts wherein the males of another tribe were eaten and the females raped {{in a frenzy of}} brain-induced sex and violence. However, this diet also inadvertently increased brain size and intelligence while triggering the loss both of body hair and of our innate psychic abilities. Thus man gradually came into being, remaining cannibalistic until 50,000 years ago. Modern humans, alienated from their surroundings now that they've no telepathic contact with nature and each other as animals do, suffering from a distorted sexuality resulting from hormonal imbalances, and driven insane from the constant pressure of their unnaturally large brains pressing on the inside of their skulls, are inevitably destroying themselves with pollution, overpopulation, racial integration and ultimately, nuclear war. He foresees a return to cannibalism in the near future, and suggests that the reader should drop out of society, embrace a vegetarian diet, steep himself in the wisdom of the East and perhaps employ various wooden frames and wire devices to alter the shape of his skull as some ancient cultures did, thus relieving the pressure on the brain and partially restoring psychic powers.|$|E

500|$|According to Friedman, Babb's {{presentations of}} the film made more money than any other film the same theater would {{showcase}} over a typical film's full booking. While actual dollar figures are not available {{because of the nature}} of the genre (which was known for poor record keeping and unconventional distribution practices), the general financial success of [...] "She Shoulda Said 'No'!" [...] prompted producers, in 1951, to import a similar film from Argentina titled The Marihuana Story. That film, about a doctor who goes undercover into the world of drug addicts to learn about his wife's death only to <b>become</b> <b>addicted</b> to marijuana himself, was not as successful as other exploitation-style efforts as the public was more concerned about drug use by younger people.|$|E
500|$|... "W.T.F." [...] also mocks fans of {{professional}} wrestling, who are portrayed largely as stereotypical rednecks {{who believe the}} scripted storylines are real. The wrestling matches in [...] "W.T.F." [...] are purposely fake-looking to emphasize the scripted nature {{of professional}} wrestling, and utilize elements typically featured in real matches, like the use of metal folding chairs as weapons. The professional wrestling characters created by the South Park boys, such as Cartman's [...] "the Rad Russian", {{are similar to the}} gimmick-based types of characters created by actual professional wrestling leagues, like The Iron Sheik. These characters, too, are portrayed in an over-the-top way to emphasize the comedic satire of professional wrestling. This is particularly illustrated with the use of one of Cartman's characters, a female diva who claims to have had so many abortions, she has <b>become</b> <b>addicted</b> to them.|$|E
