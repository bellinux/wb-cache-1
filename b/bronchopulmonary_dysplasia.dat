5|$|Diagnosis of <b>bronchopulmonary</b> <b>dysplasia</b> in newborn {{infants with}} {{breathing}} difficulties is {{difficult in the}} first few weeks. However, if the infant's breathing does not improve during this time, blood tests and x-rays may be used to confirm <b>bronchopulmonary</b> <b>dysplasia.</b> In addition, an echocardiogram can help to eliminate other possible causes such as congenital heart defects or pulmonary arterial hypertension.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bronchopulmonary</b> <b>dysplasia</b> {{is among}} the most common {{complications}} of prematurely born infants and its incidence has grown as the survival of extremely premature infants has increased. Nevertheless, the severity has decreased as better management of supplemental oxygen has resulted in the disease now being related mainly to factors other than hyperoxia.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bronchopulmonary</b> <b>dysplasia</b> is {{reversible}} in {{the early}} stages by use of break periods on lower pressures of oxygen, but it may eventually result in irreversible lung injury if allowed to progress to severe damage. One or two days of exposure without oxygen breaks are needed to cause such damage.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bronchopulmonary</b> <b>dysplasia</b> {{was first}} {{described}} by Northway in 1967, who outlined {{the conditions that}} would lead to the diagnosis. This was later expanded by Bancalari and in 1988 by Shennan, who suggested the need for supplemental oxygen at 36weeks could predict long-term outcomes. Nevertheless, Palta et al. in 1998 concluded that radiographic evidence was the most accurate predictor of long-term effects.|$|E
5|$|The {{prevention}} of oxygen toxicity depends {{entirely on the}} setting. Both underwater and in space, proper precautions can eliminate the most pernicious effects. Premature infants commonly require supplemental oxygen to treat complications of preterm birth. In this case {{prevention of}} <b>bronchopulmonary</b> <b>dysplasia</b> and retinopathy of prematurity {{must be carried out}} without compromising a supply of oxygen adequate to preserve the infant's life.|$|E
5|$|Preterm newborns {{are known}} to be at higher risk for <b>bronchopulmonary</b> <b>dysplasia</b> with {{extended}} exposure to high concentrations of oxygen. Other groups at higher risk for oxygen toxicity are patients on mechanical ventilation with exposure to levels of oxygen greater than 50%, and patients exposed to chemicals that increase risk for oxygen toxicity such the chemotherapeutic agent bleomycin. Therefore, current guidelines for patients on mechanical ventilation in intensive care recommends keeping oxygen concentration less than 60%. Likewise, divers who undergo treatment of decompression sickness are at increased risk of oxygen toxicity as treatment entails exposure to long periods of oxygen breathing under hyperbaric conditions, in addition to any oxygen exposure during the dive.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bronchopulmonary</b> <b>dysplasia</b> in {{premature}} infants {{for both}} prevention and treatment. It may improve weight gain during therapy {{and reduce the}} incidence of cerebral palsy as well as reduce language and cognitive delay. On the other hand, subtle long-term side effects are possible.|$|E
25|$|Caffeine {{can have}} both {{positive}} and negative health effects. It can treat and prevent the premature infant breathing disorders <b>bronchopulmonary</b> <b>dysplasia</b> of prematurity and apnea of prematurity. Caffeine citrate is on the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines. It may confer a modest protective effect against some diseases, including Parkinson's disease. Some people experience insomnia or sleep disruption if they consume caffeine, especially during the evening hours, but others show little disturbance. Evidence of a risk during pregnancy is equivocal; some authorities recommend that pregnant women limit consumption to the equivalent of two cups of coffee per day or less. Caffeine can produce a mild form of drug dependence– associated with withdrawal symptoms such as sleepiness, headache, and irritability– when an individual stops using caffeine after repeated daily intake. Tolerance to the autonomic effects of increased blood pressure and heart rate, and increased urine output, develops with chronic use (i.e., these symptoms become less pronounced or do not occur following consistent use).|$|E
500|$|The {{majority}} of infants who have survived following an incidence of <b>bronchopulmonary</b> <b>dysplasia</b> [...] will eventually recover near-normal lung function, since lungs {{continue to grow}} during the first 5–7 years and {{the damage caused by}} <b>bronchopulmonary</b> <b>dysplasia</b> is to some extent reversible (even in adults). However, {{they are likely to be}} more susceptible to respiratory infections for the rest of their lives and the severity of later infections is often greater than that in their peers.|$|E
500|$|The {{occurrence}} of symptoms of <b>bronchopulmonary</b> <b>dysplasia</b> or {{acute respiratory distress}} syndrome [...] is treated by lowering the fraction of oxygen administered, along with {{a reduction in the}} periods of exposure and an increase in the break periods where normal air is supplied. Where supplemental oxygen is required for treatment of another disease (particularly in infants), a ventilator may be needed to ensure that the lung tissue remains inflated. Reductions in pressure and exposure will be made progressively, and medications such as bronchodilators and pulmonary surfactants may be used.|$|E

[...] Caffeine {{is used to}} treat <b>bronchopulmonary</b> <b>dysplasia.</b> [...] In most cultures, caffeine {{in the form of}} coffee or tea is unregulated. Over 2.25 billion cups of coffee are consumed in the world every day. Some religions, including The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, prohibit coffee. They believe that it is both physically and spiritually unhealthy to consume coffee.|$|E

5000|$|Ample {{research}} {{also suggests that}} caffeine significantly reduces the occurrence of <b>bronchopulmonary</b> <b>dysplasia,</b> which is a chronic lung disorder defined by the need for supplemental oxygen after a postmenstrual age of 36 weeks. [...] <b>Bronchopulmonary</b> <b>dysplasia</b> is common in infants with low birth weight (<2500g) and very low birth weight (<1500g) who received mechanical ventilator machines to help manage respiratory distress syndrome. Currently, there is no treatment for <b>bronchopulmonary</b> <b>dysplasia,</b> as it is generally considered that the risks of treatment outweigh the necessity for using a mechanical ventilator. Caffeine only reduces occurrence.|$|E

50|$|From 1996, Yoon and {{his colleagues}} {{provided}} strong clinical and experimental evidence that intrauterine infection/inflammation, which is causally linked to preterm birth, {{plays an important role}} in the pathogenesis of fetal brain damage and cerebral palsy. Moreover, they demonstrated that intrauterine infection/inflammation is an important risk factor for the development of <b>bronchopulmonary</b> <b>dysplasia</b> which is one of the most frequent and significant complications of preterm newborns. These have important implications because the two most important complications of preterm newborns, cerebral palsy and <b>bronchopulmonary</b> <b>dysplasia,</b> seem to be initiated before birth in some, and can be prevented and treated from in utero.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Bronchopulmonary</b> <b>dysplasia</b> (BPD) affects {{children}} born prematurely. These infants have underdeveloped lungs and impaired lung function. Children with BPD often require complex treatment that includes oxygen and inhaled medication. Developmental disabilities and cardiac disorders may complicate matters further. Frequently, children with BPD must be hospitalized from birth. The medical team includes pediatric specialists, nurses, respiratory therapists, infant development specialists, and dieticians.|$|E
50|$|There is {{evidence}} to show that steroids given to babies less than 8 days old can prevent <b>bronchopulmonary</b> <b>dysplasia.</b> However, the risks of treatment may outweigh the benefits.It is unclear if starting steroids more than 7 days after birth is harmful or beneficial. It is thus recommended that they only be used in those who cannot be taken off of a ventilator.|$|E
50|$|It {{is closely}} related to <b>bronchopulmonary</b> <b>dysplasia,</b> differing mainly in the lack of prior {{ventilatory}} support. All the initial patients described with Wilson-Mikity syndrome were very low birth weight infants that had no history of mechanical ventilation and yet developed a syndrome that clinically resembled BPD. Upon the death of some of these infants, autopsies showed histologic changes also similar to those seen in BPD.|$|E

50|$|Human {{respiratory}} syncytial virus (HRSV) is a syncytial {{virus that}} causes respiratory tract infections. It is {{a major cause of}} lower respiratory tract infections and hospital visits during infancy and childhood. A prophylactic medication, palivizumab, can be employed to prevent HRSV in preterm (under 35 weeks gestation) infants, infants with certain congenital heart defects (CHD) or <b>bronchopulmonary</b> <b>dysplasia</b> (BPD), and infants with congenital malformations of the airway. Treatment is limited to supportive care (e.g. C-PAP), including oxygen therapy.|$|E
50|$|Besides {{prematurity}} {{and extreme}} low birth-weight, common diseases cared {{for in a}} NICU include perinatal asphyxia, major birth defects, sepsis, neonatal jaundice, and infant respiratory distress syndrome due to immaturity of the lungs. In general, {{the leading cause of}} death in NICUs is necrotizing enterocolitis. Complications of extreme prematurity may include intracranial hemorrhage, chronic <b>bronchopulmonary</b> <b>dysplasia</b> (see Infant respiratory distress syndrome), or retinopathy of prematurity. An infant may spend a day of observation in a NICU or may spend many months there.|$|E
50|$|ECFCs {{have been}} shown to decline in number and clonal ability with age or {{peripheral}} arterial disease, though are increased with acute myocardial infarction. A low number of ECFCs has been identified as a risk factor for infant diseases such as <b>bronchopulmonary</b> <b>dysplasia.</b> ECFCs can become dysfunctional in gestational diabetes (rescued by Vitamin D administration), smoking (driven by DNA damage), and premature birth (driven by decreased expression of histone deacetylase SIRT1). ECFCs are thus thought to have a large potential in therapies for vasculopathies of various etiologies.|$|E
