However, optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) from archaeological sediment, originated from mud brick buildings has been hardly studied. The ar-chaeological sites of Tall Abu Fahd and Tall Qsubi {{are located in the}} Middle Euphrates Valley, Deir ez-Zor district, Syria. These two Bronze Age sites were recently discovered by a Spanish-Syrian team from the Directorate General of Antiquities and Museums (Damascus) and the University of Coruña. Both sites were dated (about 3. 5 ka BC) by typological pottery classification. Sediment and pottery samples from these archaeological sites were collected for luminescence dating. Several analytical procedures for obtaining equivalent doses were tested on the sediment samples. <b>Blue</b> OSL from <b>quartz</b> subsamples and IRSL, post IRSL Blue OSL from feldspar contaminated quartz and polymin-eral subsamples were performed to obtain OSL ages. For the pottery samples, additive dose TL on a coarse grain feldspar contaminated quartz subsample was performed as well.

40|$|International audienceTo {{study the}} {{processes}} of deformation {{in the depths of}} accretionary prism, we have carried out a study in the Shimanto Belt, in Japan, considered as a fossil accretionary prism. There, the deep metamorphic terranes of the Hyuga and Morotsuka Group were pervasively deformed for conditions of ~ 300 ° C and 3 - 5 Kbars. Quartz precipitated at depth was intensely deformed by ductile shearing, enabling to unravel the micro processes of deformation in presence of abundant fluid. Cathodoluminescence (CL) analysis revealed the presence of two distinct kinds of quartz, which we interpret as associated with two distinct fluids. One kind of <b>quartz,</b> <b>blue</b> in CL, precipitates in macro veins. The other kind of quartz, brown in CL, is found in micro veins as well as plastically deformed quartz domains. The distribution and speciation of water studied with FT-IR analysis is correlated to structures. Inherited grains, free from plastic deformation, contain a larger amount of water than strongly elongated grains. In addition, small and equant recrystallized grains contain an even smaller amount of water than elongated grains. In parallel, recrystallized grains are free from optically visible fluid inclusions, which are in contrast densely distributed in inherited and elongated grains. We also observed water speciation with the presence of characteristic picks at 3380 cm and 3480 cm- 1 attributed to OH associated relatively with Al+ 3 and Li+ 1. All samples always show the broad band centered at 3400 cm- 1 related to 'liquid-like' molecular water (H 2 O) in quartz but only the <b>quartz</b> <b>blue</b> in CL, present in veins, registered the signal in secondary picks. FT-IR and cathodoluminescence signals, in good agreement with each other, constitute consistent signatures of the two distinct kinds of fluids circulating at depth. Further study is required to determine the origin of these fluids. In addition, recrystallization plays a large role in redistributing water and impurities during plastic deformation. The effect on quartz rheology is unclear, as recrystallized grains are drier, hence potentially stronger, than inherited grains...|$|R

50|$|The main {{component}} of Egyptian blue was the silica, and quartz sand found {{adjacent to the}} sites where Egyptian blue was being manufactured may have been its source, {{although there is no}} concrete evidence to support this hypothesis.

Its presence in Egyptian <b>blue</b> indicates that <b>quartz</b> sand, rather than flint or chert, was used as the silica source. This contrasts with the source of silica used for glassmaking at Qantir (New Kingdom Ramesside site), which is quartz pebbles and not sand. Calcium oxide is believed not to have been intentionally added on its own during the manufacture of Egyptian blue, but introduced as an impurity in the quartz sand and alkali. It is not clear from this, then, as to whether the craftsmen involved in the manufacture realized the importance of adding lime to the Egyptian blue mixture.|$|R

It is argued that the thermal provenance of the quartz and so the annealing it will have experienced influences the size of the observed lifetime. In particular, the results are explained in terms of a model consisting of three luminescence centers with the dominant lifetime linked to preferential recombination at one center depending on the thermal history of the sample and hence the hole concentration of the center...|$|R

40|$|Erosion on sand beaches is {{a problem}} worldwide, which {{together}} with the shortage of sand justifies the great importance of understanding the processes involved in the regression of the shoreline in order to know and adopt solutions. This study analysed the influence of sediment wear on beaches regression. For this, nine morphological units on Castellón-Valencia and nine on Alicante were analysed. The results of the granulometric and mineralogical analysis and carbonate content, showed that sediments due to different mechanisms of erosion, were worn along the shoreline. This erosion was corroborated by wear obtained {{in the study of}} white and <b>blue</b> <b>quartz,</b> where the level of rolling and the particle size were observed. Given the presence of Posidonia oceanica in much of the study area, the mineralogical composition was analysed according to the presence of this seagrass, and it was observed that the closer it gets to the coast the higher the carbonate content. This is an important fact because the increase of CO 2 in the atmosphere has increased the capacity of dilution of carbonates by the seawater. All this leads to the conclusion that different wear mechanisms have caused a decrease in the size of sediments, favouring both longitudinal and transverse transport with the consequent movement of the shoreline. The transverse movement increases as the particles size decrease, and when the particles exceed the depth of closure, they do not return to the shoreline, which faces the direct consequence of the backward movement of the coastline...|$|E
40|$|Empirical {{studies have}} {{documented}} {{an association between}} rock type and the cathodoluminescence color of constituent quartz grains. Quartz from extrusive igneous sources luminesces uniform pale <b>blue.</b> <b>Quartz</b> from intrusive igneous and high-grade metamorphic rocks generally luminesces darker purple-blue, whereas quartz recrystallized under low-grade metamorphic conditions luminesces reddish-brown. Quartz grains in most sandstones luminesce a heterogeneous mixture of these colors because the grains were derived {{from a variety of}} ultimate source rocks. If shocked quartz found at the Cretaceous-Tertiary (K-T) boundary is volcanic in origin, its cathodoluminescence should be predominantly pale blue. Alternatively, quartz grains derived from bolide impact upon, and ejection of, mixed igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary rocks should luminesce a variety of colors. Grain mounts of sand collected at the K-T boundary horizon from the Clear Creek North site in the Raton Basin, Colorado were examined. Shocked quartz luminesced a variety of colors and very few grains luminesced the pale blue color that is typical of volcanic quartz. It was concluded that the shocked quartz was derived from a petrologically diverse source region without substantial volcanic contribution. Most shocked grains apparently were derived from low-grade metamorphic rocks, with a slightly smaller contribution from high-grade metamorphic and intrusive igneous rocks. Rare quartz grains with brown-luminescing rims reflect a minor addition from detrital sedimentary sources. The apparent relative abundances of intrusive (and rare extrusive) igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary ultimate source rocks suggested by CL colors of shock-deformed quartz at the K-T boundary is consistent with a crustal/supracrustal origin for the grains...|$|E

Here we explore the violet stimulated luminescence (VSL) signal at the Luochuan section, which provides a continuous archive of homogenous sediment with favourable luminescence characteristics and a solid independent age framework. By testing several VSL protocols and their associated performance, we demonstrate that the Multi-Aliquot Additive-Dose (MAAD) protocol produces a VSL chronology at Luochuan which is in agreement with independent ages up to ∼ 0. 6 Ma. For a more representative environmental dose rate of ∼ 2 Gy/ka (∼ 35 % lower than at Luochuan), the documented range of MAAD-VSL sensitivity (200 - 1800 Gy) would correspond to the ability to date sediment up to ∼ 1 Ma back in time, offering a remarkable advance over existing methods. </p...|$|R
40|$|Communication OraleInternational audienceFluids {{present in}} the depths of {{subduction}} zones play a major role on seismogenesis, although fluid circulations paths and physico-chemical conditions are still largely unknown. Two main reservoirs of water, either in the pores of sediments or bound to hydrous minerals, release large amounts of water in the relatively shallow and deep domains of subduction zones, respectively. The usual model of circulation assumes then a bottom-up circulation driven by fluid pressure gradients. This study aims at reassessing this model, using the record of rocks from a paleo-accretionary prism, the Shimanto Belt in Japan. These rocks, buried to 5 kbars and 300 ˚C (Toriumi and Teruya, Modern Geology, 1988), were affected by pervasive fracturing throughout their history, from burial to exhumation. The quartz filling these fractures and the fluid inclusions that it contains keep the track of the fluid associated with the rock evolution. Using a combined approach of microstructural observations by optical microscopy and cathodoluminescence (CL), and chemical characterization by electron and ion microprobe as well as microthermometry, we show that there are actually two distinct fluids that have cyclically wetted the rock at depth. The first one is an " external " fluid penetrating through macroscopic fractures and precipitating a <b>quartz</b> <b>blue</b> in CL. In contrast, a " local " fluid attended the formation of quartz brown in CL, precipitating in microfractures or associated with ductile recrystallization. The two fluids are also chemically distinct: Both have a salinity close to seawater, but the local fluid is fresher than the external one. In addition, the external fluid is richer in aluminum than the local one. Finally, the external fluid is very slightly depleted in δ 18 O, although the difference is probably not significant and the first-order isotopic signal is a buffering by host rock...|$|R
40|$|The Southern Operations (CML 8) is {{situated}} within the Curnamona Province of Western New South Wales, {{along the southern}} extent of the Giant Broken Hill Pb-Zn-Ag orebody. Previous estimates of the near surface reserves of both 2 Lens and B Lode between sections 10 – 30 have been calculated to consist of 705 kT of ore at 81 kT combined Pb/Zn. However the metallurgical recovery (floatability) of these reserves may be substantially lower than previously estimated due to the oxidation of hypogene ore following climatic adjustment (prevailing arid regime) during the last glacial maximum. Therefore whilst the identification of a secondary zone within the central mining field has been substantially documented by previous academics, with mineral assemblages correlating to a two-phase oxidation cycle following {{the decline in the}} regions palaeo-water table (illuvial zone), the irregularity of the orebody‟s geometry, mineralogy (internal stratification) and structural geology indicates that a simple paragenetic model cannot be applied over the entire mine sequence. As a result field-based observations, whole rock geochemistry and petrographic analysis were used to describe the mineralogical/elemental nature of the secondary zone within the southern mining district, relative to observations made by earlier academics within the central mining leases. These investigations further support the notion of two-phase oxidation cycle with samples within both the gossanous and complex carbonate zone of 2 Lens and B Lode exhibiting a diversification of secondary minerals within several morphological forms, relative to the overprinting of the palaeo-supergene blanket following redissolution. However in comparison with the central mining district the southern extent of 2 Lens and B Lode notably displays a less extensive secondary zone, with only an estimated 1681. 53 t (2. 076 % of the reserve) of pre-existing hypogene ore having undergone oxidation to form secondary minerals (i. e. cerussite and smithsonite). This can notably be attributed to substantial sulphide armouring of enclosing siliceous (low grade <b>blue</b> <b>quartz</b> lode) and metasedimentary units within both the clastic calc-silicate and garnet quartzite horizon, in relation to the orebody‟s plunge 20 ° to the south (gradual increase in overburden). Whilst localised increases in the extent and intensity of the secondary zones can be further correlated to the transgression of several shear zones which trend coplanar to the orebodies (i. e. E 1 SZ and BLSZ) in which both adjoining wall rocks and high grade zones have notably undergone partial to complete oxidation, forming a series of limonitic webwork/boxwork structures after cerussite. However based on the analysis of drill core these zones notably decline in abundance from between 33. 0 and 53. 0 m over a transitional redox barrier (~ 13. 0 m) with the underlying hypogene ore. Therefore due to the low intensity and extent of the secondary zones related to both 2 Lens and B Lode the deposit has been further classified as a low risk-high yield reserve...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the results of a combined electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and cathodoluminescence (CL) study of quartz from the Arrow uranium deposit and its surrounding areas in the southwest margin of the Athabasca basin, Saskatchewan. Detailed EPR analyses of quartz samples from both the basement and the overlying sandstones revealed the presence of a host of different paramagnetic defects (i. e., oxygen vacancy electron centers and silicon vacancy hole centers) previously observed in quartz from {{the eastern part of the}} Athabasca basin. The silicon vacancy hole centers were previously shown to have formed from bombardment of alpha particles emitted from the decay series of ^ 238 U, ^ 235 U and ^ 232 Th. Characteristic spectral differences have been observed between quartz from different lithologies, such as the lack of the H'_ 3 centers in basement quartz. Thermal annealing and neutron irradiation experiments suggest that these spectral differences are linked with different diamagnetic precursors, which might be related to growth defects formed during crystallization. Of the four different types of drusy quartz (translucent, milky, pink and smoky) identified in the basement at the Arrow deposit, only the pink and smoky types contain significant concentrations of paramagnetic defects. <b>Blue</b> <b>quartz</b> in metasedimentary rocks from the basement is characterized by low concentrations of radiation induced defects, suggesting no pervasive uranium-bearing fluids in the basement. Quartz of high EPR intensities is restricted to ~ 7 m from mineralized areas, confirming the structurally controlled nature of uranium-bearing fluids. CL imaging and spectral analyses also confirmed the EPR results that the translucent and milky types of quartz contain only low levels of radiation induced defects. Smoky quartz with elevated radiation induced defects as revealed by EPR, on the other hand, is characterized by characteristic CL halos and patches associated with uranium-rich minerals and often features well-developed continuous rims, which cross-cut the growth zoning of quartz crystals and apparently suggests remobilization of uranium after quartz crystallization. Pink quartz with elevated radiation induced defects as revealed by EPR does not have the characteristic CL halos, patches or continuous rims, suggesting a homogeneous distribution of radiation induced defects in this type of quartz and pointing to their formation during crystallization from a uranium-bearing fluid. This result, combined with the common occurrence of pink quartz in veins and breccias associated with dravite alteration, suggests that this uranium-bearing fluid might represent the main mineralization event at the Arrow deposit. The intensities and distribution of alpha-particles-induced defects in detrital quartz close to the sandstone-basement unconformity suggest that uranium-bearing fluids at the Arrow deposit are restricted to the areas immediately above the basement-hosted mineralization. This distribution, together with the low radiation induced defects in detrital quartz, suggests that the basinal fluid along the sandstone-basement unconformity at the Arrow deposit, if present, was low in uranium, which was mainly transported in basement fluids. The present results further support the suggestion that combined EPR and CL analyses of radiation induced defects in quartz is a powerful tool for the exploration of uranium deposits in the Athabasca basin...|$|E
40|$|Analysis of sedimentological, stratigraphic, {{paragenetic}} and geochemical {{characteristics of}} {{samples from the}} Early Ordovician Shakopee Dolomite and Everton Formation, and the overlying Middle Ordovician St. Peter Sandstone, obtained from drill cores and outcrops in the Illinois Basin indicate that subsurface dolomitization locally reduced primary porosity, and {{that the degree of}} reduction changes with location. Specifically, porosity occlusion by dolomitic cementation is pronounced in the Shakopee and Everton on the northern shelf of the basin, and, increases progressively to the south into the deeper part of the basin. 	Three sample locations were selected for this study based on relative paleoceanographic position along a north-south transect through the Illinois Basin. These include: (1) core from the shallow marine shelf in Stephenson County (UPH well); (2) hand samples from the LaFarge Quarry in LaSalle County; and (3) core from the deep marine basin in White County (Superior Well). Quartz arenites of the St. Peter overlie the Shakopee at the post-Knox unconformity (an erosional surface) in the northern Illinois Basin. The Shakopee is a fine-grained dolomite interlayered with thinly bedded shales and siltstones. In the southern, deeper portions of the Illinois Basin, the St. Peter directly overlies the Everton. Here, the Everton is a near-shore dolomitized marine deposit containing irregular lenses of quartz sands. Previous biostratigraphic correlation studies in {{the southern end of the}} basin suggested that the Everton is age-equivalent to both the Shakopee and the St. Peter in the basin, and thus, that the post-Knox unconformity underlies the Everton. My studies of sedimentologic composition and diagenetic alteration suggest, however, that the Everton belongs within the Knox Supergroup instead of the Ancell Group, and thus that the top of the Everton is the post-Knox unconformity. Of note, cementation and lithostratigraphic characteristics at the post-Knox unconformity makes the surface act as an efficient aquitard. 	A suite of 61 polished thin sections were analyzed petrographically in plane light, polarized light, and with cathodoluminescence (CL). Use of CL allowed identification of an early quartz cement and two dolomite cements (D 1 and D 2) that are separated from later dolomitization events by a dissolution event. A pink-red CL dolomite (RD 1) replaced D 1 and D 2, which is followed by a third non-luminenscent dolomite cement (D 3) and a later anhydrite cement. Two late replacement dolomite cements (RD 2 and RD 3), which exhibit dark red and yellow-orange luminescence respectively, replaced all of the prior dolomite cements. This observed paragenetic sequence was capped by the precipitation of a late bright <b>blue</b> <b>quartz</b> cement. Covariation modeling of ?? 18 O, ?? 13 C and 87 Sr/ 86 Sr is consistent with the dolomitizing fluids having been formed from seawater-derived brines that were partially diluted with meteoric fluids that gained radiogenic Sr from either the Precambrian granite-rhyolite basement or from Paleozoic shales. The various cements, which reflect the consequences of successive diagenetic events, significantly reduced porosity locally. 	Comparison of thin sections from the three sample localities used for this studies indicates that porosity decreases progressively from north to south in the Illinois basin. Specifically, the Shakopee, Everton and St. Peter deposits have between 10 % and 30 % porosity in samples from the UHP well, whereas they have only 1 - 5 % porosity in the Superior well. This change suggests that cementation was greater in south, where diagenetic fluids were hotter and contained relatively more dissolved minerals. As these fluids migrated northwards, they progressively lost their mineral content, and thus were less capable of precipitating cements when they reached the northern shelf of the basin. Therefore, strata of the northern portion of the basin are likely better targets for subsurface CO 2 sequestration than are those to the south...|$|E
