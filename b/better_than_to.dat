25|$|Hutton {{discouraged}} fraternisation {{with the}} West Indies players and this went decidedly against Trueman's grain, {{given that he}} was a gregarious character who liked nothing <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>to</b> fraternise. Trueman had made friends with Frank Worrell and other West Indian players when he met them in English league cricket and objected strongly to Hutton's policy, claiming that he was not alone in this and especially as Hutton gave no reason for it. Trueman suspected the MCC hierarchy of instructing Hutton to make the demand. For his own part, he would not allow anyone to dictate to him with whom he should be friends.|$|E

25|$|This {{incident}} {{illustrates that}} in the Republic the relationship between Church and State always remained problematic, {{even though it had}} seemed to be settled in favor of the church in 1619. Though the regents knew <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>to</b> interfere in matters of doctrine (as they were accused of doing in 1618), they thought they had certain rights of oversight in return for the privileged status of the Reformed Church. The clergy, on the other hand, had never reconciled itself to such oversight, and on the contrary was of the opinion that the Church had a right to oversee public policy. As the regents would never concede such a right there was a constant tension between the two, not least in the matter of tolerance, or rather, Toleration.|$|E

Poet Philip Pendleton Cooke questioned Griswold's sincerity, saying he [...] "should have loved ... <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>to</b> say it".

500|$|Penelope's story uses {{simple and}} {{deliberately}} naive prose. The tone {{is described as}} casual, wandering, and street-wise with Atwood's dry humour and characteristic bittersweet and melancholic feminist voice. The book uses the first-person narrative, though Penelope sometimes addresses the reader through the second person pronoun. One reviewer noted that Penelope is portrayed as [...] "an intelligent woman who knows <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>to</b> exhibit her intelligence". Because she contrasts past events as they occurred from her perspective with the elaborations of Odysseus and with what is recorded in myths today, she {{is described as a}} metafictional narrator.|$|E
500|$|According to Branco, the show's past writing {{teams had}} {{proposed}} creating a Marty and Todd love story, {{but it never}} happened, mostly because Haskell and Howarth had refused to participate. In Branco's opinion, the push toward the storyline was the reason Howarth eventually left OLTL for As the World Turns. By contrast, at a fan gathering in 2008, St. John joked about Todd and Marty bonding during the Carlivati storyline, stating, [...] "I'm all for gang rape." [...] He later issued an apology for the comment: [...] "I should know <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>to</b> ever try and make a joke about such a serious subject.

He added that he [...] "should know <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>to</b> make political statements". Some members of the U.S. Congress, the NBA and human rights groups suggested that Rodman had become a public relations stunt for the North Korean government. On May 2, 2016, Kenneth Bae credited Rodman with his early release. He said that Rodman's rant raised awareness of his case and that he wanted to personally thank him for his expedited release.|$|E

[...] September 2011 was going to mark the tenth anniversary of the September 11 attacks and Beyoncé thought that the song would perfectly complete her album, which had nearly reached completion. The mastering of 4 was delayed to allow Beyoncé to record the song.

500|$|Delius, {{but well}} ahead of Grieg and Tchaikovsky. Nevertheless, {{in his later years}} he [...] {{frequently}} denigrated [...] his career, for example writing to Scott: [...] "I have never been a true musician or true artist". [...] His failure to be recognised as a composer for anything beyond his [...] popular folk-song arrangements was a source of frustration and disappointment; for years after his death [...] the bulk of his output remained largely unperformed. From the 1990s {{an increase in the number}} of Grainger [...] recordings has brought a revival of interest in his works, and has enhanced his reputation as a composer. An unsigned tribute published on the Gramophone website in February 2011 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Grainger's death opined that [...] "though he would never be put on a pedestal to join the pantheon of immortals, he is unorthodox, original and deserves <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>to</b> be dismissed by the more snooty arbiters of musical taste".|$|E
500|$|... "Black Widow" [...] {{is a song}} {{which runs}} for a {{duration}} of three minutes and 29 seconds and {{has been described as}} a song that [...] "channels more trap music with its beat". The song combines a sparse snap and heavy trap beat with a refrain that follows a slow-building, clapping chorus formula which peaks but deliberately never capitalizes. Instrumentally, [...] "Black Widow" [...] is composed of an ominous steel drum rhythm, and heavy bass, while its dance breakdown is employed with minimalism. Azalea solicits the track's verses with a snarling, bitter technique, consisting of rhyming employed with a spitting delivery. While Ora uses a seething element to sing the track's hook, [...] "I'm gonna love ya, until you hate me / And I'm gonna show ya, what's really crazy / You should've known <b>better,</b> <b>than</b> <b>to</b> mess with me harder / I'm gonna love you, I'm gonna love you / Gonna love you, gonna love you / Like a black widow baby". Combined, Ora and Azalea's vocals are based on a call and response structure throughout the song.|$|E
500|$|In 1047, Magnus and Harald went to Denmark {{with their}} leidang forces. Later that year in Jylland, {{less than a}} year into their co-rule, Magnus died without an heir. Before his death, he had decided that Sweyn was to inherit Denmark and Harald to inherit Norway. On hearing the news of Magnus's death, Harald quickly {{gathered}} the local leaders in Norway and declared himself king of Norway as well as of Denmark. Although Magnus had appointed Sweyn his successor as king of Denmark, Harald immediately announced his plans to gather an army and oust his former ally from the country. In response, the army and the chieftains, headed by Einar Thambarskelfir, opposed any plans of invading Denmark. Although Harald himself objected to bringing the body of Magnus back to Norway, the Norwegian army prepared to transport his body to Nidaros (now Trondheim), where they buried him next to Saint Olaf in late 1047. Einar, an opponent of Harald, claimed that [...] "to follow Magnus dead was <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>to</b> follow any other king alive".|$|E
