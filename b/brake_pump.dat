50|$|The {{turntable}} {{is situated}} {{to the north}} east of the signal cabin. It is a standard 60-foot table with pneumatic motor, originally powered by the Westinghouse air <b>brake</b> <b>pump</b> and system on the steam locomotive.|$|E
50|$|During {{the early}} 1960s, {{several of the}} WW class {{locomotives}} transferred from the North Island to Greymouth were altered to operate on the Rewanui Incline by the provision of 'trap-door' cowcatchers to clear the centre rail and additional air reservoirs {{on the tops of}} the side tanks. Following the removal of the centre rail in 1966, the locomotives' extra reservoirs were removed and the original <b>brake</b> <b>pump</b> was replaced by two larger pumps, one {{on each side of the}} smokebox.|$|E
50|$|The {{locomotives}} did {{not change}} greatly during their NZR career. The first change was to fit Waikato-type spark arrestors {{to many of the}} North Island-based engines, resulting in a new 'pear-shaped' smokebox with an ash hopper {{at the base of the}} smokebox. The cast-iron smokebox doors were replaced by steel ones, and the <b>brake</b> <b>pump</b> was moved from its original location on the right-hand side of the smokebox to a new position, recessed into the running board, just forward of the cab on the same side.|$|E
50|$|Electronic {{stability}} {{control or}} ESC systems, {{and the older}} Anti-lock brake or ABS systems, perform an automated braking (and for ESC, steering) function using wheel-by-wheel rapid <b>brake</b> <b>pumping,</b> similar to a mixture of threshold and cadence braking on a tire by tire basis.|$|R
50|$|They {{ride with}} the engine crews in the cab {{and are able to}} {{practice}} firing techniques, often on the Whistle Board Cutting - Waikari section. Qualified Locomotive Assistants and Drivers supervise these members and give tips and advice to assist the trainee. The trainees are also trained to prepare appliances such as the Detroit Lubricator and the Westinghouse <b>Brake</b> <b>Pumps.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Miles had {{produced}} an [...] "Advanced Design" [...] {{version of its}} flagship LSV, the ZX40S Advanced Design to use the motor, as well as using the motor in all versions of its ZX40ST work truck. Along with the AC motor upgrade, these two models come with regenerative braking and vacuum assisted <b>braking</b> <b>pumps.</b> Due {{to the increase in}} available power from the AC motor, the two vehicles also offer air conditioning as an option.|$|R
25|$|The steam {{generated}} in the boiler not only propels the locomotive, but also energizes other devices such as whistles, <b>brakes,</b> <b>pumps</b> and passenger car heating systems. The constant demand for steam requires a continuous supply of water to the boiler, usually pumped in automatically. The source of this water is an unpressurised tank that is usually part of the locomotive's tender or is wrapped around the boiler {{in the case of}} a tank locomotive. Periodic stops are required to refill the water.|$|R

5|$|One major anomaly {{remained}} in the railway's operations: the 1889 Regulation of Railways Act had required, amongst other measures, that all British passenger trains be fitted with continuous brakes. McConnel had secured an exemption for the Talyllyn Railway, {{on the basis that}} the low speed of operation meant they were unnecessary and that the cost of compliance would bankrupt the enterprise, {{but by the end of}} the 1990s the Railway Inspectorate was insisting that the Talyllyn be brought into compliance with the act, a little over 100years after it had passed. By 2001, the railway had fitted its entire passenger fleet with the necessary equipment, operated by air <b>brake</b> <b>pumps</b> mounted on the locomotives.|$|R
50|$|Antilock Braking System (ABS) ABS senses {{impending}} {{wheel lock-up}} under heavy <b>braking</b> and <b>pumps</b> the front <b>brakes</b> individually or the rear brakes together (to help maintain stability), as needed, up to 30 times per second to prevent lock-up and maintain steering ability.|$|R
50|$|<b>Pumping</b> <b>brakes</b> {{are often}} used where a pump is already part of the machinery. For example, an {{internal}}-combustion piston motor can have the fuel supply stopped, and then internal pumping losses of the engine create some braking. Some engines use a valve override called a Jake brake to greatly increase <b>pumping</b> losses. <b>Pumping</b> <b>brakes</b> can dump energy as heat, or can be regenerative brakes that recharge a pressure reservoir called a hydraulic accumulator.|$|R
50|$|A Westinghouse compressed-air brake was {{installed}} as the locomotive <b>brake.</b> The air <b>pump</b> was originally {{on the left}} of the smokebox; later it was moved to the right.|$|R
40|$|A disc with radial vanes and {{circumferential}} pillars {{proves to}} be successful in operation and achieves energy efficiency improvements compared with those of traditional design. Cooling characteristics of this novel design are practically identical to the disc with tangential vanes but the equivalent aerodynamic (air pumping) losses are approximately 50 % less. It is shown that these reductions in pumping losses can lead to substantial energy savings in train operations. When developing new designs and/or comparing different railway disc designs, the proposed disc cooling to aerodynamic efficiency ratio ([eta]v) was found to be a very useful parameter to assess. This [`]efficiency ratio' - a ratio of convective power dissipation to aerodynamic power losses can help in achieving adequate balance of cooling efficiency and aerodynamic losses to suit particular application. The use of CFD is of enormous benefit in generating discs that fulfil these demanding requirements, with the spin rig being exceptionally useful for experimental work.

50|$|In April 1963, the National Defense Council {{decided to}} develop a {{prototype}} of an armoured personnel carrier equipped with Romanian automotive components. These auto parts were successively installed in the hull of a Soviet BTR-60P (also known as the GAZ-49) at different factories of the local automotive industry. The experimental prototype, designated T.A.B.-63, was equipped with two local-made SR-213 engines, two gearboxes, two transfer cases, two drive shafts, two power take-offs, <b>brakes,</b> hydraulic <b>pumps,</b> parts of the electric system, parts of the centralized tire air pressure control system {{and a number of}} support elements of the armoured hull.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The pure {{electric}} vehicles and hybrid electric vehicles are being developed and used wildly to save energy and reduce air pollution. In {{pure electric}} vehicles and hybrid electric vehicles, most of the steering hydraulic <b>pump</b> and <b>braking</b> sir <b>pump</b> have one electric motor to drive its pump. A new system with one electric motor for these two bumps was developed for application in {{pure electric vehicles}}（EVs ） and hybrid electric vehicle (HEVs). Comparison with conventional configuration, this new method can reduce cost and mounting space with compact size and higher energy efficiency. And the test {{results show that the}} new system can meet the requirements of HEV operation quite well...|$|R

50|$|Hydraulic {{hybrid vehicle}} systems {{consists}} of four main components: the working fluid, reservoir, pump/motor (in parallel hybrid system) or in-wheel motors and pumps (in series hybrid system), and accumulator. In some systems, a hydraulic transformer is also installed for converting output flow at any pressure with a very low power loss. In an electric hybrid system, energy is stored in the battery and is delivered to the electric motor to power the vehicle. During braking the kinetic energy of the vehicle is used {{to charge the battery}} through the regenerative braking. In hydraulic hybrid system, the pump/motor extracts the kinetic energy during <b>braking</b> to <b>pump</b> the working fluid from the reservoir to the accumulator. Working fluid is thus pressurized, which leads to energy storage. When the vehicle accelerates, this pressurized working fluid provides energy to the pump/motor to power the vehicle. For a parallel hybrid system, fuel efficiency gains and emissions reductions result from reduced mechanical load on the internal combustion engine due to the torque provided by the hybrid system.|$|R
40|$|Pump {{systems are}} {{utilized}} widely in Heating, Ventilation and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) systems. There are mainly three configuration types: (1) the constant primary-only flow configuration, (2) the constant primary/variable secondary flow configuration, and (3) the variable primary-only flow configuration. This thesis focuses on finding the optimal control strategy {{for it and}} programming a controller for easy in-field usage. In this thesis, the <b>pump</b> <b>brake</b> horse power (BHP) of the three pump configurations is simulated and compared using varying control methods. The best pump efficiency staging and DP reset control methods are implemented into the pump controller. A one month field experiment is performed in a chiller/boiler plant at the Western Nebraska Community College (WNCC) for the pump controller. The proposed control strategy is found to achieve an energy savings of 64. 5 % in comparison to th...|$|R
40|$|Reading and {{understanding}} centrifugal pump curves {{is key to}} proper pump selection, and to their reliable and efficient operation. This Tech Brief examines how pump curves can provide data about a pump’s ability to produce flow against certain head, shows how to read a typical centrifugal pump curve, and provides information about <b>pump</b> efficiency and <b>brake</b> horsepower. <b>Pumps</b> are the workhorses of any drinking water distribution or wastewater collection system. They operate 24 hours a day, 365 days a year getting water to homes and business, and removing wastewater from them. A correctly sized pump will work efficiently for many years, saving a system money and energy. An incorrectly sized pump can fail if it’s too small or result in unnecessary expense if it’s too big. Pump curves provide a way to see the correct size a pump should be for specific conditions. Pump Terminology Before discussing specific details, it helps to understand typical terms associated with pump curves: Impeller—the moving element in a pump that drives the liquid. Volute—the spiral-shaped casing surrounding a pump impeller that collects the liquid discharged by the impeller. Head—a measure of the pressure or force exerted by water expressed in feet. Centrifugal pump curves show pressure as head, which is the equivalent height of water with specific gravity = 1. Static Head—the vertical height difference {{from the surface of}} a water source to the centerline of the impeller. The vertical height difference from the centerline of the impeller to the discharge point is called discharge static head, while the vertical height difference {{from the surface of the}} water source to the discharge point is known as total static head.

50|$|From 2nd to 4th gear, in {{contrast}} to the 1st gear, power transmission in 2nd to 4th gear occurs purely mechanically. The transition from 1st gear into 2nd gear occurs automatically, independent on the driving speed and the driving peddle position. The hydrodynamic power transmission is switched off in 2nd gear. This occurs by the <b>pump</b> <b>brake</b> being closed, which stops the impeller. At the same time, the turbine wheel is not transmitting torque to the turbine gear due to the open turbine brake. The transmission ratio of the 2nd gear corresponds to the input differential.When changing from 2nd into 3rd gear, the input clutch opens and the lockup clutch, is shut. As a result, the drive shaft is, by the outer rim of the locked up clutch, directly connected with the planetary gear shaft, and thus the output shaft. The ratio is now 1:1.Depending on the position of the accelerator pedal, the vehicle load and the topography, the shift from 3rd to 4th gear occurs automatically. During this transition, the locked up clutch opens while the coupling for the 4th gear, the fast release coupling, closes.The 4th gear represents the overdrive gear, with the ratio of 0.7 or 0.73 depending on the differential.|$|R
30|$|Mastering dynamic {{systems is}} a {{recurrent}} task in our lives. In school, learning {{the behavior of}} neurons, the growth of plants, the behavior of molecules, and the events leading to the French Revolution; in our everyday lives, filing income taxes, operating the proverbial VCR, and using new software; in our public lives, understanding {{the workings of the}} electoral college, the behavior of the stock market, and the actions of the various political and religious factions in the Middle East. These systems can be decomposed into parts, the actions of the parts over time, and the consequences of the actions; hence, the term “dynamic systems.” Grasping some dynamic systems is difficult because the systems are not thoroughly understood or probabilistic, but even well-understood dynamic systems are challenging. Dynamic systems ordinarily have one or more structural layers and one or more layers of action. Structural layers consist of a set of parts, typically with specific associated properties, and their interrelations. Layers of action, behavior, process or causality consist of sequences of kinds of actions and their consequences. The structural layer is static, and if only for that reason, is easier to understand. The action layer is dynamic; it consists of changes in time, specifically, a sequence of varying actions and outcomes that are the consequences of the actions, often accompanied by causal reasons. Smart undergraduates who happen to score below the median in a test of mechanical ability—that is half the undergraduates—have difficulties understanding the behavior of dynamic systems, even relatively simple ones like the workings of a car <b>brake</b> or bicycle <b>pump</b> or pulley system, though they readily grasp the structure of the system parts (e.g., Hmelo-Silver & Pfeffer, 2004; Tversky, Heiser, & Morrison, 2013). Understanding the behavior of dynamic systems entails comprehending the temporal sequence of the actions of the parts of the system, the nature of the actions, the changes that result, and the causal dependencies between the actions and the changes.|$|R
