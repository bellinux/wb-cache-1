The proposed <b>broadband</b> bandpass <b>filter</b> has designed using quarter-wavelength short stubs alternating with branch stubs co-via structure, and inserting the bandstop filters to substitute for redundant connecting lines. Compare with some traditional co-via structure, this work by using the branch stubs to construct the co-via structure, not only reduce the size around 70 % but also decrease the radiation loss due to some complex meander 46 Lin et al. configurations occurring in the connecting lines. For the prototype <b>broadband</b> <b>filter,</b> center frequencies around 4 GHz were selected. The bandwidth of passband was between 1. 95 GHz and 6. 25 GHz, in which the insertion-loss amounts to around− 1. 5 dB.

50|$|The broadband, {{or light}} {{pollution}} reduction (LPR), filters are nebular filters that block the light {{pollution in the}} sky and transmit the H-alpha, H-beta, and O III spectral lines, which makes observing nebulae from the city and light polluted skies possible. These filters block the Sodium and Mercury vapor light, and also block the natural skyglow such as the auroral light. The <b>broadband</b> <b>filters</b> differ from the narrowband with the range of wavelengths transmission. LED lighting is more broadband so this is not blocked although white LEDs have from themselves a considerably lower output around 480 nm which is close to O III and H-beta wavelength. The <b>broadband</b> <b>filters</b> have a wider range because the narrower transmission range causes a fainter image of sky objects, and since the work of these filters is revealing the details of nebulae from light polluted skies, it has a wider transmission for more brightness. These filters are particularly designed for nebulae observing, are not useful with other deep sky objects. However, it can improve the contrast between the DSOs and the background sky, which may clarify the image.|$|E
