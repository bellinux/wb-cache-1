The <b>bungee-jumping</b> platform can still be seen on the western side of the bridge. Deteriorating stairs, handrails and other infrastructure installed by the bridge-jumping company remain in the bushland.|$|E

In Long Hike, teams had to hike down a long trail to the bottom of the canyon with {{reaching}} the clue box.

5000|$|The land diving (Sa: [...] ) of Pentecost Island in Vanuatu is {{an ancient}} ritual in which young men jump from tall wooden {{platforms}} with vines tied to their ankles {{as a test of}} their courage and passage into manhood.

The land-diving ritual on Pentecost has been claimed as an inspiration by AJ Hackett, prompting calls from the islanders' representatives for compensation for what they view as the unauthorised appropriation of their cultural property.|$|E
