A group of players who were openly hostile toward Bradman formed during the tour.

5|$|Glaciation {{has played}} an {{important}} but incompletely understood role in the park. Glaciers existed throughout the park area {{during most of the}} Pleistocene with smaller ones persisting at higher elevations until comparatively recent times. Lassen Peak is situated at a center from which many of these glaciers originated. Glacial ice that filled Mill Creek (whose canyon is mostly post-glacial), Blue Lake Canyon, Kings Creek Meadows, Flatiron Ridge, Warner Valley and the valley of Manzanita, Hat and Lost Creeks originated from there. Indeed, Lassen Peak appears to <b>be</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> the depression carved by the Lost Creek Glacier.|$|E

He tells Liz and the writers that he will <b>be</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> the writers' room every day as an observer. As days pass, Jack begins {{to interfere with the}} writers' work, and instead of just being an observer, he regularly gives the writers ideas for upcoming sketches. This causes a major frustration for the staff, so Liz tells Jack that the writers do not like his involvement. Jack says that although he enjoyed joining the writers every day, he tells Liz that he accepts their decision.|$|E

25|$|The scenic {{stage was}} {{probably}} some 50’ deep and 30’ high. The proscenium arch {{may have been}} some 30’ wide and at least 25’ high to accommodate the scenery in operas such as Dioclesian, The Fairy-Queen, or The World in the Moon. Both the forestage and the scenic stage were raked. The music box above the proscenium arch could hold perhaps 8 to 10 musicians, to provide incidental music. A full orchestra would <b>be</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> the pit, {{just in front of the}} stage.|$|E

25|$|The {{reasonable}} suspicion {{test has}} {{the intention of}} protecting public confidence, but Leo and Chen wonder how accurately this test actually reflects the public's view. The test as formulated in Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin requires that the reasonable man <b>be</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> court and in the know of all the relevant facts. However, this is usually not the case. Most of the public only receives information in bits and pieces, and thus even if a case passes the reasonable suspicion test, the public may not be satisfied {{that there was no}} possibility of bias. Thus the concept that the reasonable suspicion test reflects the public's perspective is overstated. The practical reality is that when the reasonable man is imbued with all the relevant facts, he will essentially be in the same position as the court. Therefore, the suggested approach is that the court, in personifying the reasonable man, should take into account all relevant circumstances and determine if there is the suspicion or possibility of the appearance of bias whilst being mindful to exclude considerations stemming from the individual judge's personal preferences, special knowledge and legal sophistication.|$|E

500|$|Tomahawk is {{a musical}} {{supergroup}} consisting of Mike Patton, vocalist for Faith No More and Mr. Bungle; Duane Denison, guitarist for The Jesus Lizard; Kevin Rutmanis, bass player for Melvins; and John Stanier, drummer for Helmet. Mit Gas was recorded after they toured {{with the band}} Tool, whose fans frequently booed Tomahawk off stage during their performances. Denison has likened the experience of playing to the unreceptive and uninterested crowds as similar to [...] "being pro-choice at a [...] Bush rally {{and trying to make}} your point". Subsequently, the band opted to organize their own tour in support of the album, choosing to work with Melvins, Skeleton Key and Dälek. Speaking about the planning required to stage a four-act tour, Patton stated [...] "that's a lot of music. That's {{a lot of time to}} <b>be</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> some stinking-ass club with some guy puking in your purse". Tool's guitarist Adam Jones offered to direct a video, but the offer was declined by the band. Reports suggested that a cover of the theme from the movie Flashdance What a Feeling was going to be included on the album, although the song was not on the final track listing.|$|E

500|$|You Only Live Twice was {{published}} in the UK on 16 March 1964, by Jonathan Cape and cost sixteen shillings. There were 62,000 pre-orders for the book, a significant increase over the 42,000 advance orders for the hardback first edition of On Her Majesty's Secret Service. Richard Chopping, cover artist for The Spy Who Loved Me, was engaged for the design. On 17 July 1963, Michael Howard of Jonathan Cape had written to Chopping about the artwork, saying: [...] "I have had a talk with Ian about the ideas for the ingredients of this design. He is very much in favour of the toad... but with a suitable array of oriental embellishrangment, i.e. toad plus Japanese flower arrangements, which he thinks should <b>be</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> a suitable piece of Japanese pottery, perhaps ornamented with a dragon motif. If you could manage a pink dragonfly sitting on the flowers, and perhaps just one epicanthic eye peering through them he thinks that will be just splendid!" [...] Chopping's fee rose to 300 guineas for the cover, a rise from the 250 guineas he received for The Spy Who Loved Me.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Battlefield" [...] was {{directed}} by Philip Andelman [...] and filmed at the Golden Oak Ranch in California. On June 3, 2009, a thirty-second preview of the video was released online. The complete video premiered online on June 7, 2009. The video begins with a shot of a black car parked {{in the middle of}} a field. Sparks appears to <b>be</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> a car, dressed in black, as she sings the first verse. Intercut scenes of Sparks laying down in the field wearing a white dress are then shown. During the second verse, she exits the car and walks towards the camera. As the second chorus kicks in, Sparks is surrounded by smoke. During the song's bridge, she warns her love interest to get his armour, as she appears to be surrounded by flashing lights and smoke. Then intercut scenes of Sparks singing into the camera in front of a black backdrop are shown. The video then shows Sparks lifting her right arm in the air as missiles shoot up into the sky. The video ends by showing Sparks covered in smoke. Jocelyn Vena of MTV News wrote that the video shows that Sparks is [...] "definitely growing up". Maura of Idolator wrote that the video [...] "is a simple affair that allows her to get into maximum drama mode." ...|$|E

The other main suspect, ex-police officer, Oleksiy Pukach was {{believed}} to have fled abroad and therefore charged but not on trial. No-one had been charged for ordering the murder. On the day the trial started Gongadze's widow Myroslava Gongadze commented {{on the fact that}} no-one has been charged for the killing: [...] "They are known and they should be punished just the same as those who will <b>be</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> the dock today".|$|E

2500|$|The exact {{role the}} new Queen would play, if any, in public or {{government}} affairs, was uncertain with her main role being simply {{to give the}} Shah a male heir. [...] Within the Imperial Household, her public function was secondary to the far more pressing matter of assuring the succession. [...] However, {{after the birth of}} the Crown Prince, the new Queen was free to devote more of her time to other activities and official pursuits. Mohammad Reza was always very attracted to tall women and Farah was taller than her husband, which led him to wear elevator shoes to disguise this fact. Usually when the Imperial couple were photographed, one or both would <b>be</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> a chair or alternatively the Shah and his Queen were photographed on a staircase with Mohammad Reza standing on the upper stairs.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the time}} of the Reformation, altars were fixed against the east end of the church, and the priests would {{celebrate}} the Mass standing {{at the front of the}} altar. [...] Beginning with the rubrics of the Second Prayer Book of Edward VI published in 1552, and through the 1662 Book of Common Prayer (which prevailed for almost 300 years), the priest is directed to stand [...] "at the north syde of the Table." [...] This was variously interpreted over the years to mean the north side of the front of a fixed communion table, the north end of a fixed table (i.e., facing south), the north side of a free-standing table (presumably facing those intending to receive the Elements who would <b>be</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> the quire stalls opposite), or at the north [...] end of a free-standing table lengthwise in the chancel, facing a congregation seated in the nave.|$|E
