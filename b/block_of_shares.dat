25|$|When {{a company}} lists its {{securities}} {{on a public}} exchange, the money paid by the investing public for then newly issued shares goes directly to the company (primary offering) {{as well as to}} any early private investors who opt to sell all or a portion of their holdings (secondary offerings) as part of the larger IPO. An IPO, therefore, allows a company to tap into a wide pool of potential investors to provide itself with capital for future growth, repayment of debt, or working capital. A company selling common shares is never required to repay the capital to its public investors. Those investors must endure the unpredictable nature of the open market to price and trade their shares. After the IPO, when shares trade freely in the open market, money passes between public investors. For early private investors who choose to sell shares as part of the IPO process, the IPO represents an opportunity to monetize their investment. After the IPO, once shares trade in the open market, investors holding large blocks of shares can either sell those shares piecemeal in the open market, or sell a large <b>block</b> <b>of</b> <b>shares</b> directly to the public, at a fixed price, through a secondary market offering. This type of offering is not dilutive, since no new shares are being created.|$|E
25|$|The largest {{minority}} shareholder, the Petersen Group, held a 25% stake at {{the time}} of the renationalization, and had financed their initial purchase of 15% of the stock in 2007 with a vendor’s loan from Repsol for €1.5 billion. The chairman and majority owner of the Petersen Group, Enrique Eskenazi, was close to President Néstor Kirchner, who supported Eskenazi's bid to become YPF's principal Argentine stockholder. Eskenazi benefited from a dividend distribution rate at YPF of 90%, which allowed the Group to repay its vendor's loan in installments. The 2008 agreement required Repsol to buy back shares owned by the Group and to assume the loan should the Madrid-based firm lose majority control of YPF. Sebastián Eskenazi, the son of the Petersen Group chairman and CEO of YPF until April 16, indicated however that the group would forego this option. The Group defaulted in May on a Credit Suisse loan taken in 2011 to raise its stake in YPF from 15% to 25%. Officials at Credit Suisse and at other creditors involved, including Banco Itaú, BNP Paribas, and Goldman Sachs, announced on May 11 that the Group's shares would be repossessed as collateral. Repsol, as another of the Group's creditors affected by their default, also repossessed a <b>block</b> <b>of</b> <b>shares,</b> thus increasing their stake in YPF to 12%; following a steep rally in YPF shares, Repsol sold its stake a year later.|$|E

I buy a piece of land; the value rises; I buy stocks; their value rises." [...] But the operations are entirely dissimilar. In the first speculation the unearned increment derived from land arises from a wholly sterile process, from the mere withholding of a commodity which is needed by the community. In the second case, the investor in a <b>block</b> <b>of</b> <b>shares</b> does not withhold from the community what the community needs. The one operation is in restraint of trade and {{in conflict with the}} general interest, and the other is part of a natural and healthy process, by which the economic plant of the world is nourished and from year to year successfully and notably increased.|$|E

40|$|We identified, in {{independently}} generated hybridoma antibodies, <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>shared</b> somatic alterations comprising {{four consecutive}} amino acid replacements in the CDR 2 s of their heavy chain variable regions.

In addition, we performed genomic cloning and sequencing analyses that indicate that no genomic sequence could encode the <b>block</b> <b>of</b> <b>shared</b> replacements {{in any one of}} the antibodies and thus directly serve as a donor by a recombinational process. Finally, in a survey of other somatically mutated versions of the same heavy chain variable gene, we found several examples containing one, two, or three <b>of</b> the <b>shared</b> CDR 2 mutations in various combinations. We conclude that the shared somatic alterations were acquired by several independent events. This result, {{and the fact that the}} antibodies containing the four shared mutations were elicited in response to the same antigen and are encoded by the same V and V K gene segments, suggests that an intense selection pressure has fixed the shared replacements by favoring the clonal expansion of B cells producing antibodies that contain them.
