The Mexican authorities <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> {{responsible for a}} significant part of the violence in Mexico, including the murder of 72 migrants in 2010 and the massacre of 193 people in 2011. A common torture method of his was known as guiso (stew), in which victims would be dumped into oil barrels, doused with gasoline and burned alive.

5|$|Todd's {{identical}} twin brother, Victor Lord, Jr. (Trevor St. John), {{whom he had}} never known, is physically altered and brainwashed to <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> Todd. From May 2003 to August 2011, he assumes Todd's identity. In 2003, the presumed dead Irene Manning had ordered a hit on the real Todd {{to keep him from}} exposing her agency. She had Todd strapped to a chair and made him uncover every detail of his life. She originally gave Victor Todd's scar, but then had Victor's face altered with reconstructive surgery to make him look like Mitch Laurence's long lost brother, Flynn Walker Laurence. Irene sent Victor away in Todd's place, so that he could get his share of the inheritance as Victor Lord Sr.'s heir, and unknowingly help the agency. She kept the real Todd locked up, instead of following through with the original plan to kill him. She eventually admits to these facts after Todd escapes and returns home. Todd struggles with losing eight years of his life, and blames Victor for stealing his children, including the daughter he had with Téa, Danielle (Dani). He plans to kill Victor and is the top suspect when Victor is gunned down. He claims his innocence and convinces Starr to help him escape jail to keep Irene from killing the family for Victor's fortune. Although Irene wounds him, Todd kills her. Téa's brother, Tomás (Ted King), takes credit for allowing a wounded Todd to escape. Todd begins having vivid memories of killing Victor. Before Tomás is sentenced, Todd confesses to Irene's murder; Téa gets the charges reduced to self-defense. Todd locates the gun used to kill Victor and uses it to frame Tomás as revenge for initially bringing him to Irene. Todd and a rogue CIA agent force Tomás into a false confession. Todd faces difficulty bonding with Jack, who only accepts Victor as his father, but he continues to bond with Starr and assists her with various issues. He also helps Cole Thornhart fake his death so he can live with Starr and their daughter, Hope, in California. Todd is later arrested for Victor's murder.|$|E

25|$|Originally, the Church was to {{be known}} as Church of the Resurrection, but was changed to Church of the Risen Christ as the former term was found to be rather {{abstract}} and impersonal. A quotation from the souvenir magazine published in conjunction with the Church’s official opening cites the following rationale: “The name RISEN CHRIST expresses in a better way the unique character of the Easter event. We believe in a Risen Christ. We <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>He</b> <b>is</b> alive and that we have a relationship with God through Him. Our Church stands as a permanent witness to such a faith”.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{the course}} of Life on Mars, Sam's {{uncertainty}} is reinforced by frequent paranormal phenomena, such as hearing voices and seeing images from 2006 on radios, telephones, and televisions. The voices discuss his medical condition, leading him to partially <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> in a coma. Other elements suggest {{to him that he}} is insane, such as his frequent and unexpected encounters with the Test Card Girl from Test Card F, who speaks directly to him. Annie Cartwright partially persuades Sam that he is truly in 1973, arguing that his mind would be unable to fabricate the amount of detail and tangibility in the world where he finds himself, evidence that he is in fact in 1973.|$|E

However, he is struck down by a possibly supernatural illness and sends a final letter to Claudius asking for forgiveness.|$|E

25|$|Idema was {{not without}} his supporters, usually found among blogs {{sympathetic}} to his situation. The contributors to these blogs <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> being unjustly punished for actions condoned, if not officially sanctioned, by the U.S. military. However, {{there has been little}} support for Idema's claims in general media outlets. Indeed, many members of the media who encountered Idema while they were on assignment in Afghanistan regard him as a fraud. His most dangerous followers are called The Jack Idema Fan Club. The President of this delusional group, Lynn Thomas, also a blogger who wrote for a hate group, in particular, has attacked Penny Alessi, who was Idema's ex, nonstop right up until Idema's passing. The author of CAO'S Blog, attacked Ms. Alessi relentlessly on that blog. In 2011, she testified falsely in a Fayetteville, North Carolina court so she could slander a church along with Idema. Ms. Alessi, still suffers the residual damage due to the stalking of Lynn Thomas and Kender, another Fan Club Member.|$|E

This is why he ordered to the IV. (reserve) corps to start a counterattack against the Hungarian troops in the next day. Csorich's II. corps and Panyutyin's division were appointed to sustain the attack of the reserve corps. Wohlgemuth ordered to his troops stationed at Sempte and Szered, to destroy the bridge between the two villages, and to come to help his main troops. The Panyutyin division was placed on the left flank of Wohlgemuth's IV. (reserve) corps. Wohlgemuth's main goal was to cut the retreat route of the Hungarians, and therefore units of his troops occupied the village of Királyrév, through which the main Hungarian forces could return to the bridge from Aszódpuszta.|$|E

Before going to the Registrar to be married, Aloysius decides that Clarissa's clothing is too fashionable, so Clarissa borrows Jane's nurse attire. Rosebud appears and the mortals criticise her because her skirts are too short.
