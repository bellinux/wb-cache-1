5|$|The best-known {{version of}} the Bricker Amendment, {{considered}} by the Senate in 1953–54, declared that no treaty could <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> United States that conflicted with the Constitution; treaties could not be self-executing without the passage of separate enabling legislation through Congress; treaties could not give Congress legislative powers beyond those specified in the Constitution. It also limited the president's power to enter into executive agreements with foreign powers.|$|E

50|$|In {{developing}} this in Book X, Plato told of Socrates' {{metaphor of the}} three beds: one bed exists as an idea <b>made</b> <b>by</b> God (<b>the</b> Platonic ideal); one <b>is</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> carpenter, in imitation of God's idea; one <b>is</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> artist in imitation of the carpenter's.|$|R
5|$|These trains {{originally}} had no visual passenger information systems; station announcements had to <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> train operator. An automatic audio announcement system using voice synthesizers was installed on each train by September 1994. The first iteration {{of the door}} closing buzzer announcements, which replaced the initial door chimes, was fully introduced by April 1997.|$|E
5|$|Geneforge {{stemmed from}} the idea of {{creating}} a horde of creatures and the ability to care for those creatures or send them to their deaths. The choice was to <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> player. From this point, Vogel considered who would be able to gain such powers, how they would control them and how these creatures would be treated. The game was developed with the intention of giving players choices; which factions to side with, how non-Shaper human outsiders are treated and whether to pursue goals through combat or diplomacy. Unlike most role-playing games, Geneforge was designed so that {{it would be possible to}} complete the game without using violence. Vogel cited , , Deus Ex and EverQuest as influences.|$|E
5|$|Ironside {{arrived at}} British General Headquarters at 06:00am on 20 May, {{the same day}} that {{continental}} communications between France and Belgium was cut. When Ironside made his proposals known to Gort, Gort replied such an attack was impossible. Seven of his nine divisions were engaged on the Scheldt and even if it was possible to withdraw them, it would create a gap between the Belgians and British which the enemy could exploit and encircle the former. The BEF had been marching and fighting for nine days and was now running short of ammunition. The main effort had to <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> French to the south.|$|E

5|$|Part I {{authorised}} {{the establishment}} of County Associations under schemes to be drawn up by the Army Council, and laid out the expected form of these associations and their areas of authority. It provided {{that they were to}} be funded centrally but could raise funds in their own right, and that any other regulations necessary for the administration of the associations were to <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Army Council. It explicitly stipulated that these associations were not to have operational command over the forces they administered.|$|E
5|$|Part II of the Act {{permitted}} {{the establishment of}} the Territorial Force. Regulations for government, discipline and pay were to <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Crown, with certain caveats. Any existing enactment which applied to the Militia, Yeomanry or Volunteers could be extended to the Territorial Force by an Order in Council. A number of enactments were subsequently applied by an order of 19 March 1908: s.20 of the Railway Act 1842, s.12 of the Railway Act 1844, s.52 of the National Defence Act 1888, s.43 of the Friendly Societies Act 1896, the whole of the Officers Commissions Act 1862, and part of s.6 of the Regulation of Forces Act 1871.|$|E
5|$|The author {{believes}} that determinations {{of what should}} be censored from whom should not <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> government, stressing that a society must ensure {{that there is a}} tangible negative impact on youth from certain material before imposing censorship. She writes that it becomes incredibly difficult to characterize specifically what should and should not be censored, resulting in negative overreaching consequences of censorship. Heins advises the impact on society from censorship could be so great that censors should be sure there is real actual harm rather than imagined harm prior to enacting restrictive laws regulating indecency or the Internet.|$|E

5|$|The main German {{attack was}} to <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> 50th Reserve Division of the XXIII Reserve Corps, a Prussian {{division}} {{that had been}} involved in the Spring Offensive from the outset. It had a few days' rest before the advance was delayed by the Allies at Albert and Dernancourt, and its morale was still high. The right prong of the attack would <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> 229th Reserve Infantry Regiment (RIR) advancing through the 9th Reserve Division north of Dernancourt against the sector held by the 48th Battalion. The left prong would consist of the 230th RIR, advancing from the area of Morlancourt through Dernancourt against the 47th Battalion and 2nd Tyneside Pioneers. In this sector, I Battalion of the 230th RIR (I/230 RIR) would cross the Ancre and seize Dernancourt, then III/230 RIR would assault the embankment. After the capture of the embankment, the assaulting troops would push northwest over the Albert–Amiens road, then advance west towards Amiens. II/230 RIR was to follow up the assault of III/230 RIR. Both regimental commanders considered that the plan could only succeed if the embankment was weakly held, and made representations to their brigade commander, but to no avail. The German artillery preparation was to last only 45 minutes.|$|E
5|$|The main attack, {{from the}} north and east, was to <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade, {{commanded}} by Brigadier General Edward Chaytor, which moved in line of troop columns. The New Zealanders were supported by a machine gun squadron armed with Vickers and Lewis guns, and the 3rd Light Horse Brigade all under the command of Chaytor. This attack began near the village of Magdhaba and the Wadi El Arish, on the virtually featureless battleground, when the British Empire artillery opened fire {{at the same time as}} Chaytor's group moved towards the Ottoman garrison's right and rear.|$|E
5|$|Like her two predecessors, Ranavalona {{concluded}} a political marriage with Prime Minister Rainilaiarivony. The young queen's role was largely ceremonial as nearly all important political decisions continued to <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> much {{older and more}} experienced prime minister. Ranavalona was frequently called upon to deliver formal speeches (kabary) to the public on behalf of Rainilaiarivony and would make appearances to inaugurate new public buildings, such as a hospital at Isoavinandriana and a girls' school at Ambodin'Andohalo. Throughout her reign, Ranavalona's aunt, Ramisindrazana, acted as an adviser and exercised considerable influence at court. Ranavalona's older sister, Rasendranoro, whose son Rakatomena and daughter Razafinandriamanitra lived with their mother at the Rova, was also a close companion. An American journalist who visited her palace reported that Ranavalona {{spent much of her}} leisure time flying kites or playing lotto, a parlor game, with her relatives and other ladies at court. She also enjoyed knitting, needlework and crocheting and would frequently bring her latest craft project to work on at cabinet meetings. She had a great love of fine garments and was the only Malagasy sovereign to import the majority of her clothing from Paris rather than London.|$|E

5|$|The Canadian monarch, {{seen as the}} fount of honour, is at {{the apex}} of the Order of Canada as its Sovereign, {{followed}} by the governor general, who serves as the fellowship's Chancellor. Thereafter follow three grades, which are, in order of precedence: Companion, Officer, and Member, each having accordant post-nominal letters that members are entitled to use. Each incumbent governor general is also installed as the Principal Companion for the duration of his or her time in the viceregal post and continues as an extraordinary Companion thereafter. Additionally, any governor general, viceregal consort, former governor general, former viceregal consort, or member of the Canadian Royal Family may be appointed as an extraordinary Companion, Officer, or Member. Promotions in grade are possible, though this is ordinarily not done within five years of the initial appointment, and a maximum of five honorary appointments into any of the three grades may <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> governor general each year. , there have been 21 honorary appointments.|$|E
5|$|The {{day after}} Leopold and Wolfgang arrived back in Salzburg {{the court was}} thrown into turmoil {{by the death of}} Archbishop Schrattenbach. This created {{problems}} for Leopold, who had unresolved issues with the court. Part of his salary during the second Italian visit had been stopped, and Leopold wished to petition for its payment, and to pursue the matter of Wolfgang's salary as a Konzertmeister, which Schrattenbach had indicated might be paid on Wolfgang's return from the first Italian journey. There was also the matter of succession to the post of Salzburg's Kapellmeister, to be available soon on the pending retirement of the incumbent, Giuseppe Lolli, who was over 70 years old; Leopold, who had followed Lolli as Vice-Kapellmeister, might normally have felt confident of succeeding him to the higher post. Decisions on these matters would now <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> new archbishop, whose policies and attitudes were unknown.|$|E
5|$|The pale-brown bromine monofluoride (BrF) is {{unstable}} at room temperature, disproportionating {{quickly and}} irreversibly into bromine, bromine trifluoride, and bromine pentafluoride. It thus cannot be obtained pure. It may be synthesised by the direct {{reaction of the}} elements, or by the comproportionation of bromine and bromine trifluoride at high temperatures. Bromine monochloride (BrCl), a red-brown gas, quite readily dissociates reversibly into bromine and chlorine at room temperature and thus also cannot be obtained pure, though it can <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> reversible direct reaction of its elements in the gas phase or in carbon tetrachloride. Bromine monofluoride in ethanol readily leads to the monobromination of the aromatic compounds PhX (para-bromination occurs for X = Me, But, OMe, Br; meta-bromination occurs for the deactivating X = –CO2Et, –CHO, –NO2); {{this is due to}} heterolytic fission of the Br–F bond, leading to rapid electrophilic bromination by Br+.|$|E
