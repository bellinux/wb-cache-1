Working with fellow missionary Christiaan Albers, who had also preached in Cianjur, Coolsma {{published a}} Dutch-Sundanese dictionary in 1911; {{this was followed by}} a revised version of his Sundanese-Dutch dictionary in 1913. Coolsma's wife died on 27 September 1917.

As the leading not-for-profit provider of supportive housing in Florida, Carrfour has supplied homes for more than 10,000 formerly homeless men, women and children since its founding. In Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 2007, a non-profit organization named <b>Back</b> <b>on</b> <b>My</b> Feet was created by runner Anne Mahlum as a running club for homeless {{men and women in}} the area, to help overcome homelessness through a multi-step self-help program centered on running three days a week, plus sponsored running events. Participants, drawn from local homeless shelters partnered with the organization, are assigned to different teams within each chapter and monitored by a nonresident member, and are required to commit to punctuality, endurance, self-optimism, team spirit, and sobriety. The members earn incentives through continued participation and progress, culminating in educational scholarships and assistance in finding permanent housing and employment. <b>Back</b> <b>on</b> <b>My</b> Feet counted a total of 400 homeless runners in nine cities after five years, and by the beginning of 2013 counted 10 different city chapters in the United States, with four more chapters planned by the end of the year.|$|E

All these things go through one's mind. Then if Michael had won...he would have had to ask me to join his government, and I didn't want that. I asked myself: why am I risking all this? And I made my decision...I might have been an absolute disaster in the job. It's possible. So I am left there. You can't rewrite it. You can't rerun it.|$|E

500|$|One {{kilometre}} {{from the}} summit, Simpson fell off his bike. Taylor and Hall {{arrived in the}} team car to help him. Hall tried to persuade Simpson to stop when he fell, saying, [...] "Come on Tom, that's it, that's your Tour finished." [...] But Simpson {{said he wanted to}} go on. Taylor was informed and said, [...] "If Tom, wants to go on, he goes." [...] Noticing that his toe straps were still undone, Simpson said, [...] "Me straps, Harry, me straps!" [...] They got him on his bike and pushed him off. Simpson's last words, as remembered by Hall, were 'On, on, on.' The words 'Put me <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> bike!' were invented by Sid Saltmarsh, covering the event for The Sun and Cycling– now Cycling Weekly. Saltmarsh was not there at the time and was in a reception black-spot for live accounts on Radio Tour. Simpson managed to ride a further [...] before he began to wobble. He was held upright by three spectators who then helped him to the ground on side of the road. He was unconscious with his hands locked to the handlebars. Hall shouted for the other mechanic, Ken Ryall, to pry them loose and the pair laid the lifeless Simpson beside the road. Hall and a nurse from the Tour's medical team took turns giving Simpson mouth-to-mouth resuscitation before Dumas came with an oxygen mask.|$|E
500|$|Unlike Madonna's {{previous}} two lead singles, [...] "4 Minutes" [...] (2008) and [...] "Give Me All Your Luvin'" [...] (2012), [...] "Living for Love" [...] puts {{the emphasis on}} the lyrics and vocals, with the lines on the bridge going like [...] "Took me to heaven, let me fall down/Now that it's over, I'm gonna carry on" [...] and a [...] "throbbing drop" [...] in the middle. Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine described the song as Kiesza meets [...] "Like a Prayer", and noted that there were many changes from the leaked demo version: the throwback house music being replaced by an 808 pulse sound and Keys' piano, as well as handclaps and gospel riffing being removed {{towards the end of the}} song. For Jon Lisi from PopMatters, [...] "Living for Love" [...] fitted with contemporary pop music releases and the DIY ethic they displayed, starting from Taylor Swift's [...] "Shake It Off", to Ariana Grande's [...] "Break Free" [...] and Katy Perry's [...] "Roar". The survivor anthem-like nature of the track was evocative of Madonna's survival in her music career. With NRJ the singer herself explained the meaning behind the lyrics: [...] "It's a song having your heart broken but it's about saying you know what I'm going to my life goes on, I will carry on, I won't stop believing in love, I'll pick up my crown, put it <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> head and I will walk through life proudly believing that love, true love does exist." ...|$|E
500|$|Writing for USA Today, Brian Mansfield complimented {{the optimistic}} and [...] "self-assured" [...] {{nature of the}} song, adding that [...] "it's the sort of {{determined}} dance anthem Madonna does so well". The Dallas Morning News Hunter Hauk described the song as a [...] "solid melding" [...] of different club musics and appreciated the dance break, and Madonna's singing attitude, calling it [...] "less prickly or defiant than we see on Instagram these days". Jeff Miers from The Buffalo News compared [...] "Living for Love" [...] to earlier club anthems, songs which had become commercial success for Madonna. Writing for i-D, Nick Levine described the song as a [...] "perfectly-pitched comeback single: rather than returning with a cheap EDM banger... When she sings 'I picked up my crown, put it <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> head', {{it feels like a}} statement of intent." [...] Lewis Corner from Digital Spy listed it {{as one of the top}} ten tracks of the week, adding that the composition made it [...] "an euphoric first cut from... Rebel Heart". Jed Gottlieb from Boston Herald described the track's beats as contemporary, while found the chorus and the hooks to be reminiscent of [...] "old school" [...] Top 40 songs. [...] "True Blue fans will hear a joy and nostalgia in [...] ". Jon Pareles from The New York Times commended [...] "Living for Love"'s ability to transform [...] "the breakup emotions into an uplifting redemption". He called it [...] "one of Madonna's best singles in a decade". Writing for PopMatters, Lisi found the track to be Madonna's [...] "most joyous" [...] release since [...] "Express Yourself".|$|E
