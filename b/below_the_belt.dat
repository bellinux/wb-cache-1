5|$|Hellyeah {{embarked}} {{on their first}} tour on May 2007 titled Fire it Up, made an appearance at the Download Festival, and underwent Australian tour in July 2007. The Family Values Tour with Korn and Evanescence, saw the band start touring in late July, which also consisted playing with Alter Bridge in San Antonio before passing through thirty cities before ending in Washington, D.C. A DVD titled <b>Below</b> <b>the</b> <b>Belt</b> was released on November 13, 2007, and featured a documentary, music videos, performance footage from {{the making of the}} album, first studio sessions, coverage of the band's world tour, and personal interviews.

25|$|Greco-Roman is an {{international}} discipline and an Olympic sport. In Greco-Roman style, it is forbidden to hold the opponent <b>below</b> <b>the</b> <b>belt,</b> to make trips, and to actively use the legs in the execution of any action. Recent rule changes in Greco-Roman increase opportunities for and place greater emphasis on explosive, 'high amplitude' throws. Pinning one's opponent to the mat {{is one way of}} winning. One of the most well known Greco-Roman wrestlers is Alexander Karelin from Russia.|$|E
25|$|On April 8, 2006, Mayweather {{defeated}} Zab Judah for the IBF welterweight {{title in}} a unanimous decision. Plans {{for the fight}} had been jeopardized after Judah lost the WBA, WBC and The Ring Welterweight titles to Carlos Baldomir on January 7, 2006; however, Mayweather's and Judah's camps reworked the contract and decided that the fight would go on. During the bout, Mayweather stayed calm during Judah's aggressive early rounds. He began to dominate Judah in round five, and the latter eventually bled. Late in the tenth round Judah hit Mayweather with a left hand that was clearly <b>below</b> <b>the</b> <b>belt,</b> following with a right-handed rabbit punch. Referee Richard Steele called time out with five seconds remaining in the round. Roger Mayweather entered the ring and approached Judah, but Steele restrained him; Judah's father (and trainer), Yoel Judah, entered the ring as well. Mayweather remained in the neutral corner while the Judahs scuffled with Roger (and others who had entered the ring), until police and security restored order. Roger was ejected, and the fight continued for the scheduled 12 rounds. Mayweather won by official scores of 116–112, 117–111, and 119–109. CompuBox statistics showed him landing 188 punches, compared with 82 for Judah.|$|E
50|$|Unlike space {{elevators}} {{which would}} have to travel through <b>the</b> Van Allen <b>belts</b> over several days, launch loop passengers can be launched to low earth orbit, which is <b>below</b> <b>the</b> <b>belts,</b> or through them in a few hours.

500|$|Fitzsimmons {{dominated}} Sharkey {{throughout the}} fight, {{and in the}} eighth round, he hit Sharkey with his famed [...] "solar plexus punch", an uppercut under the heart that could render a man temporarily helpless. Fitzsimmons' next punch apparently caught Sharkey <b>below</b> <b>the</b> <b>belt</b> and Sharkey dropped, clutched his groin, and rolled on the canvas, screaming foul. Wyatt stopped the bout, ruling that Fitzsimmons had hit Sharkey <b>below</b> <b>the</b> <b>belt,</b> but virtually no one witnessed the punch. Earp awarded the fight to Sharkey, whom attendants carried out as [...] "limp as a rag". The 15,000 fans in attendance greeted his decision with loud boos and catcalls. It was widely believed that no foul had occurred and Earp had bet on Sharkey. While several doctors verified afterward that Sharkey had been hit hard <b>below</b> <b>the</b> <b>belt,</b> the public had bet heavily on Fitzsimmons and they were livid at the outcome.|$|E

500|$|The {{armoured}} belt on the Majestic class {{consisted of}} 9inches (229mm) of Harvey steel, which allowed equal protection with less cost in weight compared to previous types of armour.

500|$|With the {{exception}} of the deck armor, 8-inch turrets and conning tower—which consisted of conventional nickel steel—the Indiana class was protected with the new Harvey armor.

Beyond this point, the belt gradually grew thinner until it ended [...] under the waterline, where the belt was only [...] thick. <b>Below</b> <b>the</b> <b>belt</b> the ship had no armor, only a double bottom. On both ends the belt was connected to the barbettes of the main guns with [...] armored bulkheads. In the waterline sections outside this central citadel, compartments were filled with compressed cellulose, intended to self-seal when damaged. Between the deck and the main belt, 5-inch hull armor was used. The deck armor was [...] thick inside the citadel and [...] outside it. The hollow conning tower was a single forging 10inches thick. The 13-inch gun battery had [...] of vertical turret plating and [...] barbettes, while the 8-inch cannons only had 6inches of vertical turret plating and [...] barbettes.

2500|$|In general, boxers are {{prohibited}} from hitting <b>below</b> <b>the</b> <b>belt,</b> holding, tripping, pushing, biting, or spitting.

5000|$|Milan {{designed}} and built a multipurpose drum- and belt-sander, dubbed the “Emil Machine” by his woodworking colleagues. [...] It had interchangeable pneumatic drums of different sizes and a long slack <b>belt.</b> <b>The</b> tension on <b>the</b> <b>belt</b> could be adjusted to achieve a shape that matched the outside curve of a work. A detachable plate could be installed <b>below</b> <b>the</b> upper <b>belt</b> to sand flat surfaces. These power sanding methods were used to rapidly shape the work and to refine and smooth the piece before applying lacquer or linseed oil. A crude slack belt sanding machine, possibly {{designed and}} built by Milan, was in use at the Buckridge shop in the 1950s.|$|R
2500|$|In the 16th century, {{the city}} of Florence celebrated the period between Epiphany and Lent by playing a game which today is known as [...] "calcio storico" [...] ("historic kickball") in the Piazza Santa Croce. The young aristocrats of the city would dress up in fine silk costumes and embroil {{themselves}} in a violent form of football. For example, calcio players could punch, shoulder charge, and kick opponents. Blows <b>below</b> <b>the</b> <b>belt</b> were allowed. The game {{is said to have}} originated as a military training exercise. In 1580, Count Giovanni de' Bardi di Vernio wrote Discorso sopra 'l giuoco del Calcio Fiorentino. This is sometimes said to be the earliest code of rules for any football game. The game was not played after January 1739 (until it was revived in May 1930).|$|E
2500|$|Chaps {{are usually}} worn over denim jeans or other {{trousers}} of heavy material. [...] They {{have their own}} belt, and usually are fitted around the hips, resting <b>below</b> <b>the</b> <b>belt</b> loops of the trousers. [...] Except for chinks and armitas, which are designed to fit above the boot, most chaps are long, fitting over the boot and draping slightly over the vamp of the boot (see shoe). [...] Some designs are cut to hang long at the heel and nearly cover the entire boot except for the toe. [...] Batwings, chinks, and shotgun chaps fit firmly but comfortably around the thigh, with shotguns continuing to fit closely {{all the way down}} the calf, though not so snug as to limit free knee movement. [...] The shotgun design is a bit flared at the ankle to allow for the rider's boot. [...] Batwings and chinks are not attached around the leg below the knee.|$|E
2500|$|Mathis {{had worn}} his trunks very high, {{so that when}} Joe hit Mathis with {{legitimate}} body shots, the referee took {{a dim view of}} them. In the second round, the referee had {{gone so far as to}} penalize Joe two points for hitting <b>below</b> <b>the</b> <b>belt.</b> [...] "In a three-round bout a man can't afford a points deduction like that," [...] Joe would say. Joe then returned to Philadelphia feeling as low as he'd ever been and was even thinking of giving up boxing. Duke Dugent and his trainer Yank Durham were able to talk Joe out of his doldrums and even suggested Joe make the trip to Tokyo as an alternate, in case something happened to Mathis. Joe agreed and while there, he was a workhorse, sparring with any of the Olympic boxers who wanted some action. [...] "Middleweight, light heavyweight, it didn't matter to me, I got in there and boxed all comers" [...] Joe would say. In contrast, Mathis was slacking off. In the morning, when the Olympic team would do their roadwork, Mathis would run a mile, then start walking saying [...] "Go ahead, big Joe. I'll catch up." [...] His amateur record was 38–2.|$|E

50|$|The Type 80 {{chambers}} and fires the 7.62×54mmR round. It is a gas-operated, air-cooled, belt-fed, fully automatic firearm. It can fire {{on both the}} tripod and the foldable bipod on <b>the</b> gas tube <b>below</b> <b>the</b> barrel. <b>Belts</b> are used from 100-round boxes in the light machine gun configurations, and from 200- or 250-round boxes in tripod-mounted applications. The machine gun uses an open iron sight, but can also be fitted with an optical or night-vision sight.|$|R
2500|$|Competitors wear {{protective}} headgear and gloves {{with a white}} strip or circle across the knuckle. There are cases however, where white ended gloves are not required but any solid color may be worn. The white end just {{is a way to}} make it easier for judges to score clean hits. Each competitor must have their hands properly wrapped, pre-fight, for added protection on their hands and for added cushion under the gloves. Gloves worn by the fighters must be twelve ounces in weight unless the fighters weigh under 165 pounds, thus allowing them to wear 10 ounce gloves. A punch is considered a scoring punch only when the boxers connect with the white portion of the gloves. Each punch that lands cleanly on the head or torso with sufficient force is awarded a point. A referee monitors the fight to ensure that competitors use only legal blows. A belt worn over the torso represents the lower limit of punches – any boxer repeatedly landing low blows <b>below</b> <b>the</b> <b>belt</b> is disqualified. Referees also ensure that the boxers don't use holding tactics to prevent the opponent from swinging. If this occurs, the referee separates the opponents and orders them to continue boxing. Repeated holding can result in a boxer being penalized or ultimately disqualified. Referees will stop the bout if a boxer is seriously injured, if one boxer is significantly dominating the other or if the score is severely imbalanced. Amateur bouts which end this way may be noted as [...] "RSC" [...] (referee stopped contest) with notations for an outclassed opponent (RSCO), outscored opponent (RSCOS), injury (RSCI) or head injury (RSCH).|$|E

50|$|The {{island is}} a macro divers' paradise with many small creatures {{located in the}} {{shallows}} {{in front of the}} resorts.
