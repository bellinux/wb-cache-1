5|$|Following his {{unsuccessful}} run for {{the governorship}} in 1987, Brown resumed {{his career in the}} restaurant industry. He started the Chicken Grill restaurant in Louisville and helped his wife, Phyllis, launch Chicken By George, a line of <b>boneless,</b> skinless chicken breast products designed for sale in supermarkets and preparation at home. In 1988, Hormel made Chicken By George one of its subsidiaries. Brown expanded several other restaurants including Miami Subs, Texas Roadhouse, and Roadhouse Grill. None of these ventures matched the success he experienced early in his career.|$|E
5|$|Poultry {{meat and}} eggs provide nutritionally {{beneficial}} food containing protein of high quality. This {{is accompanied by}} low levels of fat which have a favourable mix of fatty acids. Chicken meat contains about {{two to three times}} as much polyunsaturated fat as most types of red meat when measured by weight. However, for <b>boneless,</b> skinless chicken breast, the amount is much lower. A 100-g serving of baked chicken breast contains 4 g of fat and 31 g of protein, compared to 10 g of fat and 27 g of protein for the same portion of broiled, lean skirt steak.|$|E
5|$|Olaf's {{father is}} {{identifiable}} as Gofraid, who was king of Dublin between 920 and 934, and also briefly ruled Northumbria in 927. Gofraid was a grandson of Ímar but no patronymic {{is given in}} the original sources. This may be {{because he was a}} child of a son of Ímar who never ruled Dublin, or he was a child of a daughter of Ímar, which in either case would mean his legitimacy to rule in the eyes of his contemporaries was dependent on the identity of his grandfather, not his parents. Ímar, possibly identical to Ivar the <b>Boneless,</b> was the founder of the Uí Ímair {{and was one of the}} earliest kings of Dublin in the mid-ninth century.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 850s and early 860s Ímar was {{involved}} in a protracted conflict with Máel Sechnaill, overking of the Southern Uí Néill and the most powerful ruler in Ireland. The cause of the conflict is uncertain, but it may have been sparked by competition for control of Munster and its resources. Ímar allied successively with Cerball, King of Osraige and Áed Findliath, overking of the Northern Uí Néill against Máel Sechnaill. Máel Sechnaill died in 862 and his lands were split, effectively ending the conflict. Following this Ímar and his kin warred with several Irish leaders in an attempt to expand their kingdom's influence. Ímar disappears from the historical record in Ireland between the years 864 and 870; this is consistent with Ímar being identical to Ivar the <b>Boneless</b> - Ivar was active in England between these two dates and he is not mentioned by English sources after 870. In 870 the annals record that Dumbarton Rock, the chief fortress of the kingdom of Strathclyde, was successfully captured by Ímar and Amlaíb following a four-month-long siege.|$|E
5|$|His reign, {{like those}} of his predecessors, was {{dominated}} {{by the actions of}} Viking rulers in the British Isles, particularly the Uí Ímair ("the grandsons of Ímar", or Ivar the <b>Boneless).</b> During Constantine's reign the rulers of the southern kingdoms of Wessex and Mercia, later the Kingdom of England, extended their authority northwards into the disputed kingdoms of Northumbria. At first allied with the southern rulers against the Vikings, Constantine in time came into conflict with them. King Æthelstan was successful in securing Constantine's submission in 927 and 934, but the two again fought when Constantine, allied with the Strathclyde Britons and the Viking king of Dublin, invaded Æthelstan's kingdom in 937, only to be defeated at the great battle of Brunanburh. In 943 Constantine abdicated the throne and retired to the Céli Dé (Culdee) monastery of St Andrews where he died in 952. He was succeeded by his predecessor's son MalcolmI (Máel Coluim mac Domnaill).|$|E
25|$|In 865 a {{group of}} {{hitherto}} uncoordinated bands of predominantly Danish Vikings joined {{together to form a}} large army and landed in East Anglia. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle described this force as the Great Heathen Army and went onto say that it was led by Ivar the <b>Boneless</b> and Halfdan.|$|E
25|$|Canned {{salmon in}} the U.S. is usually wild Pacific catch, though some farmed salmon is {{available}} in canned form. Smoked salmon is another popular preparation method, and can either be hot or cold smoked. Lox can refer either to cold smoked salmon or to salmon cured in a brine solution (also called gravlax). Traditional canned salmon includes some skin (which is harmless) and bone (which adds calcium). Skinless and <b>boneless</b> canned salmon is also available.|$|E
25|$|The corset {{reached its}} longest length {{in the early}} 20th century. At first, the {{longline}} corset reached from the bust down to the upper thigh. There was also a style of longline corset that started under the bust, and necessitated the wearing of a brassiere. This style was meant to complement the new silhouette. It was a <b>boneless</b> style, much closer to a modern girdle than the traditional corset. The longline style was abandoned during World War I.|$|E
25|$|Ragnarssona þáttr (The Tale of Ragnar's sons) adds a {{great deal}} of colour to {{accounts}} of the Viking conquest of York. This associates the semi-legendary king of Sweden Ragnar Lodbrok and his sons, Hvitserk, Björn Ironside, Sigurd Snake-in-the-Eye, Ivar the <b>Boneless,</b> and Ubbe. According to the stories, Ragnar was killed by Ælla, and the army which seized York in 866 was led by Ragnar's sons who avenged his death by subjecting Ælla to the blood eagle.|$|E
25|$|The Vikings {{had been}} {{defeated}} by the West Saxon King Æthelwulf in 851, so rather than land in Wessex they decided to go further north to East Anglia. Legend {{has it that the}} united army was led by the three sons of Ragnar Lodbrok: Halfdan Ragnarsson, Ivar the <b>Boneless</b> (Hingwar), and Ubba. Norse sagas consider the invasion by the three brothers {{as a response to the}} death of their father at the hands of Ælla of Northumbria in 865, but the historicity of this claim is uncertain.|$|E
25|$|Beginning around 864 {{the three}} {{brothers}} halted their campaigns of conquest in Ireland, and instead campaigned in Britain. Ímar disappears from the Irish Annals in 864, {{and does not}} reappear until 870. This has led some scholars to conclude he is identical to Ivar the <b>Boneless,</b> a Viking leader who was active in England during this period as a commander of the Great Heathen Army. In 866 Amlaíb and Auisle led a large army to Pictland and raided much of the country, taking away many hostages.|$|E
25|$|The Viking army under Ivar the <b>Boneless</b> and Halfdan Ragnarsson first {{occupied}} Nottingham in 868 {{and subsequently}} set up winter quarters there. Burgred and his West Saxon allies laid siege, but made peace {{and allowed the}} Vikings to retreat after little serious fighting in 869. Danish reoccupation and settlement began in 877, and lasted until the assault by Edward of Wessex {{in the summer of}} 918. Edward constructed a second burh {{on the opposite side of}} the Trent in 920 to further fortify the area from Danish attack. Saxon Nottingham was known to have covered about 39 acres, which may have put the burh at c. 1300 hides.|$|E
25|$|The {{condition}} {{has been}} found in an ancient Egyptian mummy from 1000 BC. The Norse king Ivar the <b>Boneless</b> may have had this condition, as well. The earliest studies of it began in 1788 with the Swede Olof Jakob Ekman. He described the condition in his doctoral thesis and mentioned cases of it going back to 1678. In 1831, Edmund Axmann described it in himself and two brothers. Jean Lobstein dealt with it in adults in 1833. Willem Vrolik did work on the condition in the 1850s. The idea that the adult and newborn forms were the same came in 1897 with Martin Benno Schmidt.|$|E
25|$|The Rake: A hideous phantasm of {{a former}} sorcerer named Domville who tested Immacolata by {{becoming}} a necromancer {{in an attempt to}} seduce her, believing himself to be more powerful than her. The attempt failed when he brought forth 'the Surgeons' (although it is never confirmed, it is heavily implied that these were the Cenobites from Barker's earlier work 'The Hellbound Heart' and its subsequent film adaptation 'Hellraiser'), who proceeded to fillet him. He is resurrected by Immacolata as a terrifying <b>boneless</b> demon and sent to assassinate the Seerkind which he does, claiming the life of Lillia before being destroyed by a passing train after being lured onto the tracks by Cal and Nimrod.|$|E
25|$|Some {{argue that}} the {{adoption}} of an ovo-lacto vegetarian or entirely plant-based vegan diet is best, but may not be totally necessary, because even modest reductions in meat consumption in industrialized societies would substantially reduce the burden on natural resources. For developed countries, a CAST report estimates an average of 2.6 pounds of grain feed per pound of beef carcass meat produced. For developing countries, the estimate is 0.3 pounds per pound. (Some very dissimilar figures are sometimes seen; the CAST report discusses common sources of error and discrepancies among such figures.) In 2007, US per capita beef consumption was 62.2 pounds per year, and US per capita meat (red meat plus fish plus poultry) consumption totaled 200.7 pounds (<b>boneless</b> trimmed weight basis).|$|E
25|$|McRib – a {{sandwich}} featuring <b>boneless</b> pork with barbecue sauce, slivered onions, and pickles. First seen in test-market stores near interstate highways around Milwaukee and Madison, Wisconsin, {{in the late}} 1970s (along with early tests of personal-sized pizza) the McRib was more widely released in 1981, but pulled from the menu in 1985. It is released annually in the U.S. as a limited time promotion in some locations. Since 2005, the McRib has reappeared in late October staying on the menu for 10 weeks. The McRib was released in Canada as a promotional sandwich from March 18 through April 8, 2008, and again in summer 2011. The McRib is presently on some European menus (e.g., Germany, {{where it has been}} standard since or even before 1990).|$|E
25|$|The kingdom {{was formed}} {{about the year}} 520 by the merging of the North and the South Folk (Angles who had settled in the former lands of the Iceni during the {{previous}} century) {{and was one of}} the seven Anglo-Saxon heptarchy kingdoms (as defined in the 12th century writings of Henry of Huntingdon). For a brief period following a victory over the rival kingdom of Northumbria around the year 616, East Anglia was the most powerful of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms of England, and its King Raedwald was Bretwalda (overlord of the Anglo-Saxons kingdoms). However, this did not last and over the next forty years East Anglia was defeated by the Mercians twice and continued to weaken in relation to the other kingdoms. Finally, in 794, Offa of Mercia had king Æthelberht killed and took control of the kingdom himself. Although independence was temporarily restored by rebellion in 825, on the 20 November 869 the Danes killed King Edmund and captured the kingdom (see Ivar the <b>Boneless).</b> By 917, after a succession of Danish defeats, East Anglia was incorporated into the Kingdom of England by Edward the Elder, afterwards becoming an earldom.|$|E

500|$|In 865 the Great Heathen Army {{landed in}} England {{and one of}} its leaders is {{identified}} by the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle as [...] "Ingvar". Later Norse tradition records Ingvar under the name of Ivar the <b>Boneless,</b> and calls him a son of the legendary Ragnar Lodbrok. It is generally accepted that Ivar the <b>Boneless</b> and Ingvar are one and the same, though the epithet [...] "the Boneless" [...] is not recorded until the twelfth century and its origins are obscure. Moreover, some suppose Ivar the <b>Boneless</b> to be identical to Ímar, though there is no scholarly consensus one way or another. Woolf supports the connection between these two [...] "Ivars" [...] and writes of the Great Heathen Army that invaded East Anglia in 865 that [...] "it is now generally agreed that they arrived in Britain directly from Ireland where Ívarr, the senior partner by 865, had been active for at least a decade". Ó Corrain argues that the [...] "evidence in favour of the identification of Ímar and Inguar consists of three points: the identity of the names, the absence of any mention of Ímar in the Irish annals between 864 and the Irish account of the siege of Dumbarton in 870, and the subsequent close connections between the dynasties of Dublin and York". Forte, Oram, and Pedersen note that Ivar is not mentioned in any English source after 870, when Ímar reappears in the Irish annals.|$|E

500|$|... "Pink slime" [...] (a {{derogatory}} {{term for}} lean finely textured beef or LFTB, finely textured beef, and <b>boneless</b> lean beef trimmings or BLBT) is a meat by-product {{used as a}} food additive to ground beef and beef-based processed meats, as a filler, or to reduce the overall fat content of ground beef. In the production process, heat and centrifuges remove fat from the meat in beef trimmings. The resulting paste is exposed to ammonia gas or citric acid to kill bacteria. In 2001, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) approved the product for limited human consumption. LFTB prepared using ammonia gas is banned for human consumption in Canada and the European Union.|$|E

500|$|The {{barndoor}} skate is a flat-bodied fish with a large, disk-like body with sharply angled corners and a pointed snout. Its pectoral fins have evolved into broad, flat, wing-like appendages used to propel the fish through the water. These fins have a concave front edge with rounded posterior corners. Like sharks, {{it has a}} <b>boneless</b> skeleton made of cartilage, a tough, elastic substance composed of collagenous and/or elastic fibers, cells, and a firm, gel-like substance called the matrix. It has slot-like body openings called gill slits {{on the underside of}} the body beneath the pectoral fins that lead from the gills. The dorsal fins are close together and far removed from the tail.

500|$|In 869, the Great Heathen Army {{advanced}} on East Anglia {{and killed}} Edmund. He {{may have been}} slain by the Danes in battle, but by tradition he met his death at an unidentified place known as Haegelisdun, after he refused the Danes' demand that he renounce Christ: the Danes beat him, shot him with arrows and then beheaded him, on the orders of Ivar the <b>Boneless</b> and his brother Ubba. [...] According to one legend, his head was then thrown into the forest, but was found safe by searchers after following the cries of an ethereal wolf that was calling, in Latin, [...] "Hic, Hic, Hic" [...] – [...] "Here, Here, Here". Commentators have noted how Edmund's death bears resemblance to the fate suffered by St Sebastian, St Denis and St Mary of Egypt.|$|E
500|$|Some {{versions}} of the Bengali text Krittivasa Ramayana contain a story of two queens that conceived a child together.

[...] The two queens execute Shiva's order and one of them conceived a child. The child was born <b>boneless,</b> but by the blessings of the sage Ashtavakra, the child was restored to full health. Ashtavakra named the child [...] "Bhagiratha" [...] – he who was born from two vulvas (bhaga).

500|$|Ímar ( [...] ; died c. 873) was a Viking {{leader in}} Ireland and Scotland in the mid-late ninth century {{who founded the}} Uí Ímair dynasty, and whose {{descendants}} {{would go on to}} dominate the Irish Sea region for several centuries. He was the son of the king of Lochlann, identified in the non-contemporary Fragmentary Annals of Ireland as Gofraid. The Fragmentary Annals name Auisle and Amlaíb Conung as his brothers. Another Viking leader, Halfdan Ragnarsson, is considered by some scholars to be another brother. The Irish Annals title Amlaíb, Ímar and Auisle [...] "kings of the foreigners". Modern scholars use the [...] title [...] "kings of Dublin" [...] after the Viking settlement which formed the base of their power.

500|$|Jenijoy La Belle takes a {{slightly}} different view in her article, [...] "A Strange Infirmity: Lady Macbeth’s Amenorrhea." [...] La Belle states that Lady Macbeth does not wish for just a move away from femininity; she is asking the spirits to eliminate the basic biological characteristics of womanhood. The main biological characteristic that La Belle focuses on is menstruation. La Belle argues that by asking to be [...] "unsex" [...] and crying out to spirits to “make thick [...] blood / Stop up th’ access and passage to remorse,” Lady Macbeth asks for her menstrual cycle to stop. By having her menstrual cycle stop, Lady Macbeth hopes to stop any feelings of sensitivity and caring {{that is associated with}} females. She hopes to become like a man to stop any sense of remorse for the regicide. La Belle furthers her argument by connecting the stopping of the menstrual cycle with the persistent infanticide motifs in the play. La Belle gives examples of [...] "the strangled babe" [...] whose finger is thrown into the witches’ cauldron (4.1.30); Macduff’s babes who are [...] "savagely slaughter’d" [...] (4.3.235); and the suckling babe with <b>boneless</b> gums whose brains Lady Macbeth would dash out (1.7.57–58) to argue that Lady Macbeth represents the ultimate anti-mother: not only would she smash in a baby’s brains but she would go even further to stop her means of procreation altogether.|$|E
