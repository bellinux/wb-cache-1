In 1991, the owners contracted Trow to investigate the chronic leaking and find a solution.

5|$|After {{finishing}} his schooling Kagame made two visits to Rwanda, in 1977 and 1978. He was initially hosted {{by family members}} of his former classmates, <b>but</b> <b>upon</b> arrival in Kigali he made contact with {{members of his own}} family. He kept a low profile on these visits, believing that his status as a well-connected Tutsi exile could lead to arrest; on his second visit he entered the country through Zaire rather than Uganda to avoid suspicion. Kagame used his time in Rwanda to explore the country, familiarise himself with the political and social situation, and make connections that would prove useful to him in his later activities.|$|E
5|$|Cooperativity is {{observed}} when two synapses are activated by weak stimuli incapable of inducing LTP when stimulated individually. <b>But</b> <b>upon</b> simultaneous weak stimulation, both synapses undergo LTP in a cooperative fashion. Synaptic tagging {{does not explain}} how multiple weak stimuli can result in a collective stimulus sufficient to induce LTP (this is explained by the postsynaptic summation of EPSPs described previously). Rather, synaptic tagging explains the ability of weakly stimulated synapses, none of which are capable of independently generating LTP, to receive the products of protein synthesis initiated collectively. As before, this may be accomplished through the synthesis of a local synaptic tag following weak synaptic stimulation.|$|E
5|$|During {{a welcome}} dinner at Barton Park, Sir John {{introduces}} the Dashwoods to his wife, Lady Middleton (Rosanna Lavelle); her mother, Mrs. Jennings (Linda Bassett); {{and their family}} friend, Colonel Brandon (David Morrissey).

She is rescued by a young man, who carries her back to the cottage. He introduces himself as John Willoughby (Dominic Cooper), and states that he will return to check on Marianne the following day. Brandon also comes to visit, <b>but</b> <b>upon</b> seeing Willoughby, he quickly departs. Willoughby and Marianne grow close through their mutual love of poetry, and he later takes a lock of her hair.

5|$|During his quest, the Kid meets {{two more}} survivors: Zulf, an {{ambassador}} from the Ura, underground-dwelling {{people with whom}} Caelondia was once at war; and Zia, an Ura girl {{who was raised in}} Caelondia. Both of them return to the Bastion, <b>but</b> <b>upon</b> reading a journal that the Kid discovers, Zulf intentionally damages parts of the Bastion's central device (the monument) and returns to Ura territory. The Kid learns that the journal belonged to Zia's father, Venn, who had worked for the Caelondians. He had helped Caelondian scientists ("Mancers") build a weapon intended to destroy the Ura completely to prevent another war. Venn rigged the weapon to backfire, so that when he was finally forced to trigger it, the resulting Calamity destroyed most of Caelondia as well.|$|E
5|$|Eventually the {{reinforcements}} that al-Muwaffaq {{had promised}} arrived from Iraq, {{under the command}} of his own son, Abu'l-Abbas. The combined Abbasid forces advanced to Shayzar, where the Tulunid army was still encamped. The latter was caught completely by surprise and was defeated; many of the Egyptians were killed in the fighting. The survivors fled to Damascus, <b>but</b> <b>upon</b> learning that the Abbasid army was headed for them they abandoned the city, allowing the Abbasids to retake it in February 885. The Tulunid forces continued south to Ramlah in the district of Palestine, where they wrote to Khumarawayh of what had transpired. Khumarawayh now decided to personally lead his troops against the Abbasids, and departed from Egypt for Syria.|$|E
5|$|Food {{politics}} in Africa {{differs from the}} cases in North America and Europe in {{that there is a}} case of small scale food power in Africa, particularly in Sudan. Some experts say that the cases of famine and food insecurity in Africa are due to inconsistent output of food production and the downward spiral of the interaction between population growth and environmental sustainability. <b>But</b> <b>upon</b> closer inspection, it is revealed that nature is not the only catalyst for Africa’s numerous food insecurity issues.|$|E

5|$|His first {{squadron}} was No. 29 Squadron RAF, {{based at}} RAF West Malling, flying the two-seater Hawker Demon. In February 1939 No 29 Squadron re-equipped with the Bristol Blenheim. Braham was disappointed at not being {{trained on the}} Hawker Hurricane and his reaction to this news was request a transfer which was refused. The squadron spent three months converting onto the Blenheim. In August 1939 No. 29 did convert to the Hurricane <b>but</b> <b>upon</b> the outbreak of war the squadron was reverted to the Blenheim {{as part of its}} reorientation to night fighter rather than daylight fighter operations. Braham soon earned the nickname 'Bob', which stayed with him throughout his service career. He had chosen this Christian name as his radio call sign to distinguish himself from the multitude of other Johns in the unit.|$|E
