30|$|The TPP was {{designed}} to cut tariffs and expand market access for exporters within the twelve signatory nations. However, the TPP {{is expected to go}} beyond these traditional elements, creating “twenty first century” rules in areas such as services, investment, digital commerce, state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and environmental protection. Trade today is less about arm’s length transactions among importers and exporters and more about adding value to transnational supply chains. Modern trade agreements need to reduce friction and establish realistic rules regarding supply chains, including <b>behind-the-border</b> <b>barriers</b> in member economies, to produce real economic benefits (Green and Goodman 2016).|$|E
40|$|Many {{studies show}} that {{democracy}} promotes freer trade. However, because they typically focus on “at-the-border” barriers such as tariffs, we know little about democracy’s effects on “behind-the-border” barriers such as discrimination in government procurement. We address this question by asking how democracy affects governments’ incentives to discriminate against foreigners when buying goods and services. We argue that “buy national” policies have unclear costs and are harder to attack than policies that visibly interfere with consumers’ ability to buy foreign goods. This makes such provisions more attractive than tariffs to democratic leaders seeking reelection. We thus hypothesize that democracy leads to lower tariffs but to greater discrimination in public procurement. We support this hypothesis with an analysis of procurement and imports in 138 countries from 1990 to 2008. Our results imply that {{a full understanding of}} the democracy–trade policy relationship requires attention to increasingly prominent <b>behind-the-border</b> <b>barriers</b> to trade...|$|E

Our results suggest that <b>behind-the-border</b> <b>barriers</b> {{play an important role in}} determining bilateral trade flows (controlling for the effects of tariffs, development levels, distance, and regional characteristics of exporters and importers, among other factors). For European Union (EU) members that joined the Union in 2004 and less developed and candidate members raising capacity in port efficiency and information technology infrastructures halfway to the EU- 15 average, trade could expand by US$ 49 billion and US$ 62 billion respectively. In the context of the economic crisis and fragile recovery, as well as efforts to strengthen Europe integration, efforts to facilitate trade with investments to raise capacity in trade facilitation should be considered as part of policy steps going forward.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to provide a {{comprehensive}} assessment of the Trade Policy Review of Mongolia (TPRM) 2014. The TPRM 2014 demonstrates that the Mongolian economy is relatively open and it has very low formal trade barriers although there remain significant <b>behind-the-borders</b> <b>barriers,</b> including poor governance and infrastructure. Being a landlocked country, any major cross-border-price differences quickly results in informal trade with neighbouring China, limiting Mongolia 2 ̆ 7 s ability to pursue independent commercial policy. Mongolia 2 ̆ 7 s growth is not broad based and largely driven by the mining boom, making its economy highly vulnerable to external shocks. While this is not unique to Mongolia, and has been seen in many natural resource-abundant countries, experience suggests that countries with sound institutions and macroeconomic policies have overcome the so-called resource curse...|$|R
30|$|In {{the recent}} decade, Asia economies have {{considerably}} liberalized foreign trade authorities with the substructure of the WTO. The economic growth {{fueled by the}} growing in size of trade and investment in the region despite the various results {{of the performance of}} nations become visible in recent years. These comprise the results of global financial crisis in 2008 – 2009, the risk of protectionism, the tenacity of remaining <b>behind-the-border</b> regulatory <b>barriers,</b> the failure to conclude WTO multilateral trade negotiations, and corresponding exclusion of small- and medium-sized enterprises (Kawai and Wignaraja 2014). These global issues prompted Asia economies to embark on various inventiveness, economic collaborations and integration in the sphere of trade and investment, innovation, and became interdependent among each other. An essential element of the regions’ policy reaction must do with an advance trade policy focused on FTA to underpin the enabling of Asia-Pacific region and transparency which is believed to furnish good governance (de Graaf and van der Wal 2010). The extant literature shows that efforts to investigate the impact of trade agreements and economic cooperation on trade growth are exerted. Among them is the evaluation of the level of economic integration, the transfer of trade and commodities, resources and people between trade partner nations (Kawai and Wignaraja 2014).|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the changing relationship between trade policy, production networks, {{and economic growth}} in Asia. It traces East Asia's rise to the coveted "Factory Asia" league with rapid growth over several decades through trade policy anchored on outward-oriented industrialization strategies, including a voluntary liberalization approach under the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) and a multilateral approach under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) /World Trade Organization (WTO) system. It explores the implications of various stresses {{to the performance of}} Factory Asia such as the consequences of the global financial crisis, the risk of protectionism, the persistence of residual <b>behind-the-border</b> regulatory <b>barriers,</b> the failure to conclude ambitious WTO multilateral trade negotiations, and the relative exclusion of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Next, it {{examines the}} evolving trade policy response in major East Asian economies centered on free trade agreements (FTAs) to support the functioning of Factory Asia and key policy challenges posed by FTAs, including the insufficient depth of FTAs, the risk of an Asian noodle bowl of multiple rules of origin, the potential for raising use of FTA preferences, and the emergence of mega-regional FTA negotiations. Finally, it considers policy implications at the national, regional, and global levels for supporting Factory Asia and growth in Asia...|$|R
40|$|The Czech and Slovak Customs Union (CSCU), {{which came}} {{into effect in}} January 1993, differs from regular {{regional}} trading arrangements as its goal was to minimize the economic cost of a decline in economic ties between its members rather than {{to set in motion}} the mechanism of integration. The creation of the CSCU ensured a smooth and conflict-free break up of Czechoslovakia and resulted in divergence in regulatory regimes of the two republics. This study argues that the process of mutual adjustment triggered by the emergence of national borders is over and that integration within the CSCU, similar in depth and scope to that existing within the European Union (EU), would be a desirable policy objective. By deepening integration, both the Czech and Slovak Republics would be better prepared to handle challenges associated with the EU accession. Such a regulatory realignment would also lower border costs and <b>behind-the-border</b> <b>barriers</b> to trade and result in a more attractive investment environment in both countries.

40|$|Global {{experience}} in regional energy market integration presents broad elements of integration, i. e., binding agreements, physical infrastructure, standardized or harmonized rules of operation, and governing or coordinating institutions. The pathway to ASEAN Energy Market Integration (AEMI) will also involve creating these elements; however, this activity must be preceded by trust-building activities among ASEAN members. Trust should be built by candidly disclosing mutual gains from, and shared costs and externalities in energy resource development, trading energy products, market adjustments, and regulatory reforms. Shared databases and assessments could allow ASEAN members to formulate {{the building blocks}} of an AEMI regional accord. ASEAN leaders could then forge a regional accord for AEMI through 2030 with actionable targets and timetables. The targets could include establishing or strengthening institutions for facilitating integration efforts, removing border and <b>behind-the-border</b> <b>barriers</b> to energy trade and investments, harmonizing rules and standards, and building the physical infrastructure for regional energy trading. Since energy market integration takes place not only at the government level but also at the private sector level, ASEAN members must base their preparedness to join AEMI on the business case for integration rather than merely on the availability of energy resources. Moreover, at the minimum, ASEAN members should have independent energy regulators and pursue harmonization of rules and standards...|$|E
40|$|The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) Agreement aims to {{be a high}} quality, 21 st Century {{economic}} agreement that furthers economic integration in the Asia Pacific. In late 2011 it remains unclear whether the TPP {{will turn out to}} be a stepping stone or stumbling block towards regional or global economic integration. The current negotiations involve Australia, Brunei, Chile, Malaysia, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, the United States and Vietnam with Japan, Mexico and Canada expressing interest in joining. The potential economic and political significance of the TPP depends on the expansion of the membership to include Japan, Korea, Indonesia, other East Asian economies, and especially China, as well as the ultimate quality of any agreement. Including additional members will be difficult after a deal is concluded among the original members and partners with whom they are currently in negotiation, especially if the content of the agreement and the accession criteria are not designed carefully and specifically with additional membership in mind. Desirably TPP will contribute to the global system by making it easier for others to join. That includes multilateralising preferences within the TPP, and eventually extending that treatment to non-members. Importantly, the agenda of negotiations needs to focus on reducing regulatory and institutional, <b>behind-the-border</b> <b>barriers</b> to trade and commerce. Focus on strengthening intellectual property rights, including stringent labour and environmental and other so called "platinum" standards will make it difficult for many members and non-members to participate fully. The TPP has the potential to keep the United States engaged in the region but complications will arise with a TPP to which China is not party, or an inward looking East Asian arrangement to which the United States is not party.

40|$|Due to {{multilateral}} {{trade liberalization}} {{and a large}} number of bilateral and plurilateral preferential trade agreements, border barriers to trade, especially tariffs, have decreased tremendously. As a result, trade facilitation plays an increasingly important role in removing <b>behind-the-border</b> trade <b>barriers</b> which have become a major trade obstacle. Realizing this, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) program created two important initiatives for the improvement of transportation and trade facilitation. Complementing the ADB's GMS program, Thailand has implemented several national infrastructure and trade facilitation projects. However, these trade facilitation initiatives have yet to positively impact microenterprises, especially the producers of traditional knowledge-based goods in border communities. With a renewed emphasis on rural economic growth, {{it is important to recognize}} the challenges microenterprises face and the potential benefits that could be enjoyed if proper policies were put in place to promote their economic integration. This paper illustrates the results of a survey performed by Cheewatrakoolpong et al. (2011) analyzing the main constraints microenterprises face in expanding their businesses and in export promotion. The findings suggest that better access to microfinance products and the procedure for accessing microfinance are instrumental in enabling small businesses to take advantage of trade facilitation initiatives in place. In addition, better coordination between offices of provincial development, the provincial chambers of commerce and other academies such as vocational schools or universities to provide necessary skills and knowledge to the poor and microenterprises. The community groups also have the potential to be very influential in providing knowledge sharing, skills training and access to microfinance and should be explored...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} role of {{migration}} in international trade {{within the framework of}} <b>behind-the-border</b> trade <b>barriers</b> and firm behavior. In addition to the introduction, which provides a context to the analysis, it consists of four essays. The first essay, titled ‘Migration as Trade Facilitation? Investigating the Links Between International Trade and Migration,’ examines the cross-country migration-trade link by estimating an augmented gravity model of international trade using a large data set that includes both developed and developing countries. The results suggest that bilateral migration is significantly related to increased trade. A ten percent increase in the total number of migrants is associated with an increase in imports of 0. 7 - 0. 8 percent globally on average. The second essay, titled ‘Does Immigration Stimulate Foreign Trade? Evidence from Sweden,’ investigates whether the link between migration and increased trade can be substantiated for small and open economies. The study augments a gravity model of international trade to estimate the possible link based on trade and migration data for Sweden and 180 partner countries between 2002 and 2007. The results show a statistically significant and positive relationship between immigrant stocks and Swedish foreign trade to immigrant source countries. A ten percent increase in the total migrant stock from a specific country is associated with an approximately six percent increase in exports, on average, and approximately nine percent more imports. The third essay, titled ‘Immigration, Emigration and Integration – Evidence and Policy Implications,’ revisits the macro-relationship between trade and migration for Sweden with a focus on the mechanisms through which migration is assumed to facilitate trade. It also studies {{the role of}} labor market integration with respect to immigrants’ trade facilitating capacity, which is made possible by utilizing data on gender and age, and the role of different product margins of Sweden’s trade. The essay also identifies and exploits an instrument for immigrant stocks, which addresses potential endogeneity and allows inferences to be made concerning the direction of causation. The results confirm that migration has contributed to Sweden’s exports to immigrant source countries on an order of 3 - 4. 5 percent given a ten percent increase in the immigrant stock. The findings suggest that labor market integration is important in determining the extent to which immigrants are able to reduce trade costs. The fourth essay, titled ‘Investigating the Link between Immigrant Employees and Firm Trade,’ studies the link between trade and migration at the firm level. It begins with a heterogeneous firm trade model and utilizes a matched employer-employee panel, which encompasses data for approximately 12, 000 Swedish manufacturing firms, 600, 000 fulltime employees and 176 partner countries over the years 1998 - 2000. In addition to providing microeconomic evidence, this essay examines the underlying channels through which migration is postulated to affect firms’ trade and the role of migrant characteristics in terms of skills and access to networks. It provides evidence on the existence of a significant and positive relationship between immigrant employees and firms’ foreign trade. Hiring one additional immigrant is associated with a 0. 9 and 0. 7 percent increase in the employer’s exports and imports, respectively, to (from) the immigrant source country. Immigrants’ skills and lengths of stay strongly influence the association with firm trade. In sum, the findings provided by the essays included in this thesis suggest that migration is not only an important trait of globalization in itself but also reinforces the process of economic interdependence through the reduction of barriers to international trade...|$|R
