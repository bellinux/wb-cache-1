25|$|The {{rapid growth}} of {{surrounding}} communities during the 20th century caused serious damage to the bay's natural environment. Heavy harvesting of fish and other sea life, constant dredging of shipping channels, and the clearing of mangroves for shoreline development were important factors. Most damaging was the discharge of waste water and other pollutants into the bay, which drastically degraded water quality. By the 1970s, the water was so murky that sunlight could not reach the shallow <b>bottom,</b> sea <b>grass</b> coverage (which is vital to marine life) had decreased by more than 80%, many previously common species had become scarce, and bay beaches were regularly closed due to unsafe levels of bacteria and pollutants.|$|R
50|$|Snares {{penguins}} nest {{in dense}} colonies {{under the tree}} cover of the Olearia forests or on coastal rocks. To build a nest, the penguins dig up shallow holes {{in the ground and}} layer the <b>bottom</b> with <b>grass,</b> leaves, twigs, peat, or pebbles. A small rim of mud is added to the rim of the nest to raise it above ground level. Vegetation at nesting sites dies dues to the dense nesting activities, and the colony moves to a new nesting site. Colonies nesting near streams may have some advantage, as the stream provides water for drinking and bathing. However, it is not essential that nesting colonies are located near a stream and many are far from any stream.|$|R

40|$|The {{frequency}} {{and expansion of}} cyanobacterial blooms have increased in coastal waters worldwide. These may be facilitated by excessive nutrient input and global warming, exerting negative consequences in marine ecosystems, communities and habitats. Although reports of cyanobacterial blooms are frequent, their causes, consequences and spatial extent are not completely understood, hence restricting regional management actions. From 2009 to 2012 we examined the spatial extent of cyanobacterial blooms in the reef systems off Providencia Island, Colombia. We also identified the main taxa involved in those blooms and evaluated bloom cover within substrate types. Blooms of benthic cyanobacteria consisted of complex microbial consortia belonging to the genera Okeania, Lyngbya, Symploca, Phormidium, Oscillatoria or Spirulina. Cyanobacteria were present in different ecosystems, geomorphological zones and substrate types, particularly at the northwest, east and southeast portions of the island. The soft <b>bottoms,</b> sea <b>grasses</b> and reef ecosystems around Providencia Island are subject to cyanobacterial blooms of varying intensity. There is a strong need to further study the frequency, scale and duration of these events to understand their impact on an ecosystem basis and on the services these provide...|$|R

In another traditional version of the same derivation of the name, when the Crows camped on the creek and walked through the thick grass in the morning when it held dew, their moccasins and leggings would get wet and they would look greasy. Thus the Crows called the creek [...] "the Greasy Grass".|$|R

60|$|September 7th.--Mr. Leach and I {{took a walk}} by {{moonlight}} last evening, on {{the road}} that leads over the mountain. Remote from houses, far up on the hillside, we found a lime-kiln, burning near the road; and, approaching it, a watcher started from the ground, where he had been lying at his length. There are several of these lime-kilns in this vicinity. They are circular, built with stones, like a round tower, eighteen or twenty feet high, having a hillock heaped around in a great portion of their circumference, so that the marble may be brought and thrown in by cart-loads at the top. At the bottom there is a doorway, large enough to admit a man in a stooping posture. Thus an edifice of great solidity is constructed, which will endure for centuries, unless needless pains are taken to tear it down. There is one on the hillside, close to the village, wherein weeds grow at the <b>bottom,</b> and <b>grass</b> and shrubs too are rooted in the interstices of the stones, and its low doorway has a dungeon-like aspect, and we look down from the top as into a roofless tower. It apparently has not been used for many years, and the lime and weather-stained fragments of marble are scattered about.|$|R
40|$|We tested {{whether the}} {{long-term}} fluctuations in abundance of 0 -group cod Gadus morhua and pollack Pollachius pollachius sampled from 1919 to 1994 at 38 stations along the Norwegian Skagerrak coast might {{be related to}} the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). The short- and long-term fluctuations of both species exhibited different spatial structures and were probably of different origins. The former, which were previously shown to be related to biotic interactions, displayed signifcant highest similarities across the smallest scales (0 t o 21 km). In contrast, the long-term fluctuations were similar at a larger scale (equal to or larger than the Norwegian Skagerrak coast) and were probably due to extrinsic factors. We have shown that the climatic conditions along the Norwegian Skagerrak coast and the fluctuations of Calanus finmarchicus in the Skagerrak were closely associated with the NAO. Long-term fluctuations of cod and pollack were, however, not associated linearly or non-linearly with the NAO or C. finmarchicus. Trends of cod and pollack appeared {{to be related to the}} long-term fluctuations in the <b>bottom</b> sea <b>grass</b> coverage, mainly constituted by Zostera marina, and it cannot be dismissed that fishing has contributed to the recent decline of these fish populations. We also conclude that the postsettlement period is crucial for these populations because of competition for space...|$|R
60|$|Mark, on this occasion, for {{the first}} time, noted a change that was {{gradually}} taking place {{on the surface of}} the Reef, without the crater. Most of its cavities were collecting deposits, that were derived from various sources. Sea-weed, offals, refuse stuff of all kinds, the remains of the deluge of fish that occurred the past year, and all the indescribable atoms that ever contribute to form soil in the neighbourhood of man. There were many spots on the Reef, of acres in extent, that formed shallow basins, in which the surface might be two or three inches lower than the surrounding rocks, and, in these spots in particular, the accumulations of an incipient earthy matter were plainly visible. As these cavities collected and retained the moisture, usually from rain to rain, Mark had some of Friend Abraham White's grass-seed sown over them, in order to aid nature in working out her own benevolent designs. In less than a month, patches of green began to appear on the dusky rocks, and there was good reason to hope that a few years would convert the whole Reef into a smiling, verdant plain. It was true, the soil could not soon obtain any useful depth, except in limited spots; but, in that climate, where warmth and moisture united to push vegetation to the utmost, it was an easy thing to obtain a <b>bottom</b> for <b>grasses</b> of almost all kinds.|$|R
40|$|Artículo de publicación ISIFeral {{domestic}} ungulates may {{compete with the}} populations of wild herbivores with which they coexist, particularly so in arid regions. The potential competition between wild camelids and feral donkeys at the eastern sector of the Atacama Desert is evaluated {{in terms of their}} coincidence or segregation in habitat use and complemented with a comparison of reproductive output (yearling/adult ratio) of vicuna family groups in the proximity vs. distant from donkey observations. Habitat use of wild camelids and donkeys was sampled driving some 1250 km of roads and tracks at the dry and wet seasons. There were 221 vicunas (Vicugna vicugna) sightings, 77 for donkeys (Equus asinus), 25 for guanacos (Lama guanicoe) and 8 for hybrids between guanacos and domestic llamas (Lama glama), as well as 174 randomly selected control locations. By means of Generalised Discriminant Analysis and Analysis of Variance we show that all ungulates actively select their habitat, with significant differences between use and availability in the area. Donkeys are relatively abundant in comparison with camelids and coincide broadly with both of them across the altitudinal gradient, but they fall between them in local scale habitat selection and do not seem to force their displacement from their preferred habitats. Thus donkeys occur preferentially on slopes with a high cover of tall shrubs, whereas vicu as use valley <b>bottoms</b> with <b>grass</b> and guanacos the upper slope zones with grass. The potential for competition between donkeys and wild camelids is thus limited and it does not affect the reproductive output of vicu a in this region. Therefore, with the present knowledge we suggest that population control is not currently merited for feral donkeys.

50|$|In 1909, {{plans for}} the new school {{buildings}} were passed and work started, {{though it was not}} an easy site to develop owing to the severe slope of the land on the east side down to Infirmary Road. The best materials were used, local brick from the Wasps Nest Brick Works in Brampton, a roof of Cumbrian Slate topped off with a copper covered cupola. Masons were employed to dress the considerable quantity of stonework {{with the exception of the}} window sills which were cut by a special machine recently invented. Inside, the Assembly Hall was built to accommodate three hundred students and was to have an oak parquet floor whilst the rest of the school was to have floors of Canadian Maple parquet. There were those who regarded this huge office rising from the ground with scorn, predicting that there would never be enough students to make use of the accommodation provided. To overcome the slope on the east side of the site and provide a playing area for the children, the land was terraced and substantial retaining walls were built to prevent any danger of movement of the land. The <b>bottom</b> terrace was <b>grassed</b> over to provide a playing field. The lower ground floor contained two covered play areas built so that they could easily be converted into classrooms.|$|R
40|$|International audienceAmmonia {{exchange}} fluxes between grassland and {{the atmosphere}} were modeled {{on the basis of}} stomatal compensation points and leaf surface chemistry, and compared with measured fluxes during the GRAMINAE intensive measurement campaign in spring 2000 near Braunschweig, Germany. Leaf wetness and dew chemistry in grassland were measured together with ammonia fluxes and apoplastic NH 4 + and H + concentration, and the data were used to apply, validate and further develop an existing model of leaf surface chemistry and ammonia exchange. The leaf surface water storage was calculated from measured leaf wetness data using an exponential parameterisation. The measurement period was divided into three phases: a relatively wet phase followed by a dry phase in the first week before the grass was cut, and a second drier week after the cut. While the first two phases were mainly characterised by ammonia deposition and occasional short emission events, regular events of strong ammonia emissions were observed during the post-cut period. A single-layer resistance model including dynamic cuticular and stomatal exchange could describe the fluxes well before and after the cut, but unrealistically high stomatal compensation points were needed after the cut in order to match measured fluxes. Significant improvements were obtained when a second layer was introduced into the model, to account for the large additional ammonia source inherent in the leaf litter at the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>grass</b> canopy...|$|R
40|$|Bermuda {{grass is}} the most {{important}} perennial grass in the Southern States. It was introduced into the United States at least as early as 1806. Besides the common Bermuda grass, there are several varieties, the most important of which are the Giant, characterized by a very large growth, and St. Lucie grass, similar to ordinary Bermuda grass, but lacking underground rootstocks. Bermuda grass grows well mixed with lespedeza for a summer crop. Bur clover, black medic, and hairy vetch as winter crops alternate well with it. The best Bermuda-grass pastures of the South will usually carry two head of cattle per acre for eight months of the year. On poor soils the carrying capacity is not more than one cow per acre. On rich <b>bottom</b> land Bermuda <b>grass</b> grows tall enough to cut for hay. Under exceptional circumstances three or more cuttings may be secured in a season, giving total yields of from 6 to 10 tons of hay per acre. It will grow well on soils so alkaline that most other field crops, as well as fruits, will fail. The feeding value of Bermuda-grass hay compares closely wit that of timothy hay. Bermuda grass frequently is used to bind leaves and toe prevent hillsides from washing. The grass usually can be eradicated by growing two smother crops, a winter one of oats or rye, followed by a summer crop of cow peas or velvet beans. " [...] p. ...|$|R

There is but little side drainage to the canyon, and this is easily provided for by small culverts, with the exception of Waterfall Creek. This little stream forms a cascade with falls of several hundred feet in height, and finally buries itself in the loose rock at the base of the canyon wall. For a quarter of a mile, about the middle of the canyon, narrows are formed by the side walls being nearer together; there are abrupt walls [...] in height.

40|$|The {{effects of}} the {{underwater}} light field on heat-budget calculations for shallow waters are developed and applied for the region of Bahamas. Most of the general circulation models use a simplified heat budget scheme based on Jerlov water types, and do not account for optical bottom effects. by optical bottom effect, we mean the bottom absorption and reflection of the short-wave radiation, which in turn affects the thermal stratification and heat exchange with the atmosphere. In this paper, this optical bottom effect is added to a 3 D turbulence model (a 1 D model called GOTM is coupled to a 3 D model called POM) {{and the evolution of}} the temperature structure studied. We call the coupled model 3 DGOTM. This optical bottom effect is found to be important in the areas with clear water, shallow depths and small solar zenith angle. On the basis of the coastal meteorological measurements from Andros Island, we have used this three-dimensional turbulence closure model (3 DGOTM) to show the influence of bottom reflection and absorption on the sea surface temperature field. The final temperature of the developed water column depends on water depth and bottom albedo. Effects of varying the bottom albedo were studied by comparing results for coral sand and sea <b>grass</b> <b>bottoms.</b> This has an appreciable contribution to the heat budget and salt budget of the shallow waters in these coastal regions. The salinities of the shallow regions near Andros Island have been found to reach as high as 46 psu by summer. In addition to the thermohaline plumes generated by these bottom effects, this warming process has an impact on the moisture feedbacks into the atmosphere due to evaporation...|$|R
