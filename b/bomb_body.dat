5000|$|Breda Mod. 40: (not to be {{confused}} with the previous one) is constituted by a normal Mod. 35 mounted on top of a wood or bakelite handle, in style of German bombs. The total length of the bomb then goes to 241 mm. The headphone safe is replaced by a bucket that upon release of the handle, is released from a spring and is released in the air. The <b>bomb</b> <b>body</b> finally is made of steel instead of aluminum. This version was developed Breda Mod. 42 anti-tank.|$|E
50|$|Experience during Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom led US {{air power}} {{planners}} to seek additional capabilities in one package, resulting in ongoing program upgrades {{to place a}} precision terminal guidance seeker in the JDAM kit. The Laser JDAM (LJDAM), as this upgrade is known, adds a laser seeker to the nose of a JDAM-equipped bomb, giving the ability to engage moving targets to the JDAM. The Laser Seeker is a cooperative development between Boeing's Defense, Space and Security unit and Israel's Elbit Systems. It is called Precision Laser Guidance Set (PLGS) by Boeing and consists of the Laser Seeker itself, now known as DSU-38/B, and a wire harness fixed under the <b>bomb</b> <b>body</b> to connect the DSU-38/B with the tail kit. During FY2004, Boeing and the U.S. Air Force began testing of the laser guidance capability for JDAM, with these tests demonstrating {{that the system is}} capable of targeting and destroying moving targets. This dual guidance system retains the ability to operate on GPS/INS alone, if laser guidance is unavailable, with the same accuracy of the earlier JDAM.|$|E
40|$|In {{accordance}} with regulations of International civil aviation organization, all aircrafts witch transport 30 and more passengers must have special device to defuse home-made explosive bombs. Numerical methods of computer modeling {{are used for}} construct that devises more and more. Quantity of these methods depends on adequacy level of created mathematical model to real physical process. In this article questions of design adequacy mathematical model of deforming process of special device body under inner pressure of home-made bomb explosion are discussed. Mathematical model adequacy is controlled by comparison modeling and experimental results. Computer program "ANSYS/LS-DYNA" was used for mathematical researching. Because of mathematical model have to consist as gas part (detonation product, air) as metal part (defuse home-made explosive bombs devise body) {{it was based on}} Lagrange-Euler method of describing behavior of different materials under shock. Expansion of detonation products was described by JWL equation of state. States of metal defuse home-made explosive bombs devise body and paper <b>bomb</b> <b>body</b> were described by elastic-plastic material model with kinematic hardening plasticity "PLASTIC-KINEMATIC". In order to find values of that model parameters for the paper <b>bomb</b> <b>body</b> spatial experiments were carried out. Conclusions: Mode of deformation definition method of defuse home-made explosive bombs devise was created. That method bases on adequacy mathematical model which describes home-made bomb explosion process which places inside of devise align. Increasing of paper <b>bomb</b> <b>body</b> thickness to 16 mm leads to decreasing plastic deformation of outer surface of defuse home-made explosive bombs devise body by straight line low with a coefficient 0, 002 1 /mm and decreasing level expansion that surface up to 1 mm. This decreasing is equal to 20 % of maximum level expansion special device body when was exploded inside of than high explosive without paper body. ? ?????? ??????????????? ?????? ???????? ?????????? ?????????????? ?????? ???????? ?????????????? ??????? ???????????? ?????????? ??? ????????? ??????????? ????????, ??????? ????????? ? ?????????? ?????? ? ???? ?????? ???????????? ????????? ??????????

50|$|At {{the start}} of the war Hudson went to Leicestershire and then to Kent, where she {{delivered}} her sister-in-law's baby when it was born prematurely during a thunderstorm. In Leicestershire she lived with her brother, the vicar of Ashby Magna, and his family. Here Hudson sketched local women preparing dried herbs and flowers which were sent to hospitals for medicinal uses. She also drew the canteens in Leicester where she helped with packing supply parcels for prisoners of war. Back in London, she moved to a fourth-floor flat in Earls Court and witnessed first-hand the death and destruction of the Blitz. She volunteered as a driver of a mobile canteen, actually a converted laundry van, and made tea and sandwiches for the rescue services attending at bomb sites. Later, she recalled how after a block of flats were <b>bombed,</b> <b>bodies</b> and limbs were strewn around. Visiting her mother in Torquay, she witnessed a similar scene in the aftermath of a bomb destroying a school. Hudson didn't draw these scenes, instead preferring to concentrate on depicting women volunteers hard at work for the war effort. She produced hundreds of paintings and drawings during the war. At Robert Austins suggestion she contacted the War Artists' Advisory Committee, WAAC, who purchased six of her drawings, including Village Women Drying Wild Herbs and WVS Bandage Making. These were displayed in WAAC exhibitions at the National Gallery during the war and then acquired by the Imperial War Museum.|$|R
50|$|Symbols, {{imagery and}} themes used among these artists in their works {{influenced}} by the conflict include: military symbols of war including soldiers, ammunition such as stones and rifles, missiles and army tanks; symbols of occupation and security include roadblocks, barricades, checkpoints, and The Wall; images of terror and death include portraits, photographs and videos {{of male and female}} suicide bombers, buses after they have been blown up, the aftermath of suicide <b>bombing</b> sites, <b>body</b> bags, pools of blood and blood stains; and finally, themes of oppression, which include entrapment and victimization include images of strip searches, weeping women holding children, motherless children, tents in refugee camps, and prisons.|$|R
50|$|An {{extremely}} violent individual, Testa committed 15 of the 28 murders {{attributed to}} the Riccobene-Scarfo war. Two murders were that of Frank (Chickie) Narducci Sr. on January 7, 1982 and that of low level mob associate and Peter (Fat Pete) Casella's chauffeur and bodyguard Rocco Marinucci on March 15, 1982. Rocco {{was the man who}} detonated the nail bomb that murdered Testa's father in 1981 at their family home. Exactly one year after the <b>bombing,</b> Marinucci's <b>body</b> was found in a parking lot on Federal Street in Southwark, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, with bullet wounds to the neck, chest, and head. His mouth was stuffed with three large, unexploded cherry bombs. It was the work of Testa.|$|R

He had survived by taking refuge in a meat locker three stories underground. [...] "It was cool there, with cadavers hanging all around", Vonnegut said. [...] "When we came up the city was gone...

50|$|In {{the wake}} of the deaths on June 3, 1985, {{forensics}} analysis began on the bodies of Fritz, Susie, John, and Jim. Both boys were found to have high levels of cyanide in their blood in addition to gunshot wounds to the head. It is assumed that due to the poison both children were unconscious during the police chase, and that either Susie or Fritz shot them just prior to the explosion of the <b>bomb.</b> Susie's <b>body</b> was mangled from the waist down and many pieces of the seat were deeply embedded in her corpse. This led investigators to believe that the bomb was positioned underneath her seat, on the passenger side of Fritz's Bronco. Police officers found Fritz alive among the wreckage; however, he soon died from internal hemorrhaging.|$|R
