25|$|Regardless of the S-program's design, Swedlund {{decided to}} get {{immediate}} approval for the L-program. In separate discussions between the Chief and defense minister Sven Andersson in Autumn 1958 regarding nuclear weapons and the budget plan for the coming financial years, Andersson {{made it clear that}} he favored the acquisition of nuclear weapons, but the split within the Social Democrats was so stark that it was better to not bring up the matter for discussion. Prime Minister Erlander's view was to study the question within the committee of the party and to come up with a proposition by the annual party congress in 1960. Andersson attempted to persuade the Chief to not request <b>budgetary</b> <b>resources</b> for the L-program, because they would likely be rejected. Despite Andersson’s suggestions, the Commander-in-Chief instead opted to include funds for L-program in his fiscal year 1959/1960 budget proposal. Swedlund’s diaries and other documents suggest that he had limited understanding of the political game, not least within the parties, even though his own statements in 1957 contributed to the creation of nuclear weapons resistance. He also believed that many of the senior politicians would be able to handle the issue as he desired. His lack of flexibility and belief that personal connections would overcome political opposition ultimately killed his funding request for L-program. While the L-program was left unfunded, FOA was given a large allocation for fiscal year 1959/1960 for “increased research in atomic-, missile-, countermeasure-, and other areas” in which the S-program was relevant.|$|E

40|$|Relying on a {{model of}} {{economic}} geography, this paper discusses development opportunities arising from international trade and technology diffusion. We show that either import substitution or trade liberalization may trigger takeoff in the developing country, although these two policies work through different mechanisms. The industrialization process is also influenced by knowledge spillovers: strong international technology diffusion offers better prospects for the developing country to benefit from technological externalities provided abroad. Thus, one objective of the developing country should be to enhance its absorptive capacity in order to exploit these technological externalities. In this context, only import substitution trade policy seems {{to be successful in}} financing indigenous learning process.

This paper empirically examines the influence of the LDP on the supplementary budget formation and on the revenue-sharing. We find that the LDP had a significant impact on the budget formation.

Crime adversely affecting the expenditure side of the EU budget appears in the form of subsidy fraud in the area of the Common Agricultural Policy, and subsidy fraud in the area of the structural policies.

This study seeks the impact of the crisis on the evolution of taxes in Romania and in the European Union. The main fiscal evolutions are analyzed from the point of view of the personal and corporate taxes, social contributions, taxes on property, related with the development of national and European macroeconomic indicators. Based on official data for 2008 - 2012, I processed and interpreted the data, reaching conclusions on taxation in our country and in Europe. Thus I concluded that Romania has a low rate on incomes, profit or dividend tax. At European level the progressive taxation is used by most states, to the detriment of the flat one. The taxes and fees quotas vary from state to state, but are subject to Community and national legal regulations. In terms of revenue structure, Romania follows the European trend in that indirect revenues is the primarily <b>budgetary</b> <b>resource.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} network economy, {{businesses}} {{are becoming increasingly}} reliant on information technology (IT) to perform their operations and exchange information with business partners. This heavy dependence on IT, however, poses a potential threat for an organization. When natural or man-made disasters strike and cause malfunction to its computing and communicating systems, it would be vulnerable to business discontinuity. Severe consequences resulting from such IT breakdown may include the loss of sales, damages to reputation and consumer confidence, penalty incurred by failure to fulfill the orders, and so on. As a result, {{the issue of how}} to strengthen IT capabilities so that a company can prevent or quickly recover from disasters becomes a serious concern. In this paper, we present a discrete optimization model to allocate redundancy to critical IT assets for disaster recovery planning. The objective is to maximize the overall survivability of an organization’s critical IT functions by selecting their appropriate redundancy levels while still satisfying a <b>budgetary</b> <b>resource</b> constraint.
