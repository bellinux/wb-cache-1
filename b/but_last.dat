5|$|Australia {{elected to}} bat, and Miller, {{who had been}} {{promoted}} to No. 3, shared century partnerships with Barnes (78) and Bradman (81). A middle-order collapse then ensued as the remaining Australians struggled against the local spin attack, <b>but</b> <b>last</b> man Johnston managed to hold up his end in a 37-run last-wicket partnership that allowed Miller to reach his double century. He ended on 202 not out as Australia were dismissed for 448. The Australian-born slow bowler Vic Jackson was the best Leicestershire bowler, taking 5/91. Leicestershire scored only 130 in their first innings; another Australian expatriate, Jack Walsh, top-scored with 33. Ring took 5/34 and the hosts hampered their batting efforts with two run outs. Australia enforced the follow on and Leicestershire faced {{the prospect of being}} bowled out twice in a day after Johnson took the first wickets to have them 5/83. After a rain delay Australia took the final five wickets for 34 runs in an hour on the final day; Leicestershire were all out for 147 in an innings defeat. Johnson ended with 7/42.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, {{the pitch}} dried {{out under the}} hot sun {{and turned into a}} sticky wicket. Miller bowled at a mixture of pace and off breaks and added a large amount of bouncers, leading former Australian Test batsmen and journalist Jack Fingleton to compare the amount of high-paced short-pitched bowling by the Australian pair to that during Bodyline. On the uneven surface, Edrich was struck around 40 times on the body. Miller cut down the English top-order, removing Washbrook, Compton, Edrich and Jack Ikin on the fourth morning to leave England at 5/56. After removing Washbrook, caught by Sid Barnes with only four more runs added to the overnight total, Miller trapped Compton lbw for 17, leaving England at 3/49. After having Edrich caught in the slips by Colin McCool, Miller removed Ikin first-ball, caught behind by wicket-keeper Don Tallon to be on a hat-trick, but Norman Yardley prevented him from taking a third wicket in as many balls. After Hammond and Yardley stabilised the innings with a 61-run partnership, Miller later returned to remove wicket-keeper Paul Gibb and his replacement Bedser in consecutive balls, <b>but</b> <b>last</b> man Wright successfully thwarted Miller's second hat-trick attempt. The Victorian paceman finished with 7/60, his first five-wicket haul at first-class level.|$|E

25|$|Austria's {{inability}} {{to impose a}} military solution in Spain or Flanders had strengthened the French and British negotiating positions at Utrecht. Consequently, in March 1713, Count Sinzendorf, the Emperor's representative at the congress, signed a convention for the evacuation of Imperial troops from Catalonia: the Empress departed Barcelona on 19 March, followed in July by Starhemberg. Charles VI {{had been willing to}} make unpalatable concessions to end the war, <b>but</b> <b>last</b> minute demands by Louis XIV's diplomats at Utrecht – including the cession of Luxembourg to the Elector of Bavaria, the immediate formal recognition of Philip V as King of Spain, and a guarantee the Austrians would not extend their rule in northern Italy to Mantua and Mirandola – proved a step too far. As a result, Charles VI resolved to fight on, but for other key members of the Grand Alliance the war was over.|$|E

25|$|Sadly Johnny Moyes died {{suddenly}} {{on the first}} day of the two day match and his book on the series was completed by Tom Goodman of the Sydney Morning Herald. Due to the exciting Third Test a large crowd came to Newcastle, New South Wales to watch Northern New South Wales, with players from Newcastle, Canberra and Wollongong making up the side. The morning was lost to rain, the local captain won the toss, put the MCC in to bat and got them 180/6, despite Geoff Pullar making 53, but Barry Knight (73) and Alan Smith (45) adding 103 for the seventh-wicket and the MCC finished on 319. Douglas Dives (73) and Rodney Harvey (37) and Ken King (32) made most of the runs in the reply as Northern NSW were out for 203, Len Coldwell took 3/32 and David Allen 3/35. Batting again Dexter made 71 not out and Tom Graveney 41 before the MCC innings was declared at 190/4, leaving the home team 301 to win. After Max Fox (31) and Boxsell (40) added 68 for the first wicket they collapsed to 128/9 as Allen (5/38), Graveney (2/21) and Pullar (3/26) span them out. The crowd were determined to invade the ground on the point of victory, as they had seen in the Sydney Test, <b>but</b> <b>last</b> man Gilmour held everybody up by throwing his bat around for 29 in a last wicket stand of 33. When he was finally caught by Dexter off Geoff Pullar the enthusiastic crowd climbed the fences. Fred Trueman was bowled over and had his cap taken, but he soon recovered it and the teams ran off the field.|$|E

Danny and Irving's sixth books, East of Bangor and The Cider House Rules are both abortion novels set in a Maine orphanage which both later win an Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay.

500|$|... "Immortality" [...] was {{watched by}} about 3.7 million viewers, drawing a 1.4/4 ratings share on its initial broadcast, down 12.5 {{percent from the}} {{previous}} episode's viewership. During the first half hour, the episode placed second in its timeslot, but dropped to fourth for its second half. Its lead-in, Kitchen Nightmares, also dropped 12 percent, as did all other network shows for that night. Time shifting viewing added 57 percent to the episode's ratings for three days out, and 64 percent for a week following the first airing. This was the greatest DVR gain yet for the series in that timeslot. Despite this, Joshua Jackson urged fans to watch the series live {{in an interview with}} Entertainment Weekly a week after [...] "Immortality" [...] aired.

Charlotte Runcie of The Daily Telegraph also awarded the same show 5 stars and opened her positive review with [...] "When it comes to sheer innovation, showmanship and creativity in contemporary pop, Beyoncé has everyone else beaten". Reviewing the first show in London, Lewis Corner of Digital Spy awarded the show 5 stars, noting [...] "Her often formidable and fearsome choreography throughout numbers like [...] "Run The World (Girls)", [...] "Bow Down" [...] and [...] "End Of Time" [...] is powerful and mesmerising, but is then offset by the tenderness of [...] "1+1", [...] "Me, Myself and I" [...] and [...] "Runnin (Lose It All)". Beyoncé's dynamic ability to be both vigorous and vulnerable can't be matched by her contemporaries.
