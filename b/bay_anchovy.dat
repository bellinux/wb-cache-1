However, physical factors, specifically temperature, salinity, and seasonal dynamics were stronger determinants of croaker distribution than potential prey availability. To better understand the bioenergetic consequences of diet variability at the individual level, I tested the hypothesis that croaker feeding on anchovies would be in better condition than those feeding on polychaetes using a variety of condition measures that operate on multiple time scales, including RNA:DNA, Fulton's condition factor (K), relative weight (Wr), energy density, hepatosomatic index (HSI), and gonadosomatic index (GSI). Of these condition measures, several morphometric measures were significantly positively correlated {{with each other and with}} the percentage (by weight) of anchovy in croaker diets, suggesting that the type of prey eaten is important in improving the overall condition of individual croaker. To estimate the bioenergetic consequences of diet variability on growth and consumption in croaker, I developed and validated a bioenergetic model for Atlantic croaker in the laboratory. The application of this model suggested that croaker could be an important competitor with weakfish and striped bass for food resources during the spring and summer when population abundances of these three fishes are high in Chesapeake <b>Bay.</b> Even though <b>anchovies</b> made up a relatively small portion of croaker diet and only at certain times of the year, croaker consumed more anchovy at the population level than striped bass in all simulated years and nearly as much anchovy as weakfish.

40|$|A {{number of}} species of clupeid fish, {{including}} blueback herring, American shad, and gulf menhaden, can detect and respond to ultrasonic sounds up to at least 180 kHz, whereas other clupeids, including <b>bay</b> <b>anchovies</b> and Spanish sardines, {{do not appear to}} detect sounds above about 4 kHz. Although the location for ultrasound detection has not been proven conclusively, there is a growing body of physiological, developmental, and anatomical evidence suggesting that one end organ of the inner ear, the utricle, {{is likely to be the}} detector. The utricle is a region of the inner ear that is very similar in all vertebrates studied to date, except for clupeid fish, where it is highly specialized. Behavioural studies of the responses of American shad to ultrasound demonstrate that they show a graded series of responses depending on the sound level and, to a lesser degree, on the frequency of the stimulus. Low-intensity stimuli elicit a non-directional movement of the fish, whereas somewhat higher sound levels elicit a directional movement away from the sound source. Still higher level sounds produce a “wild” chaotic movement of the fish. These responses do not occur until shad have developed the adult utricle that has a three-part sensory epithelium. We speculate that the response of the American shad (and, presumably, other clupeids that can detect ultrasound) to ultrasound evolved to help these species detect and avoid a major predator – echolocating cetaceans. As dolphins echolocate, the fish are able to hear the sound at over 100 m. If the dolphins detect the fish and come closer, the nature of the behavioural response of the fish changes in order to exploit different avoidance strategies and lower the chance of being eaten by the predators...|$|R

40|$|Understanding and {{modelling}} {{the environmental}} control of fish recruitment {{has been a}} central question in fish population ecology for the last century. Most environment–recruitment models have primarily been developed to model mean recruitment using conventional regression techniques which assume that all environmental parameters are included and that the residual unexplained variability is unstructured. However, the complexity of environmental controls and the empirical evidence that many relationships have failed when retested suggest that these assumptions are generally not met. Most environmental controls may be considered as limiting factors to recruitment and act in interaction with other factors (often not measured or not known). We used quantile regression modelling, which is specifically designed to model limiting relationships, to reanalyse environment–recruitment relationships that have been published for 4 fish stocks: (1) Northeast Arctic cod (Barents Sea), (2) Atlanto-Scandian herring, (3) <b>Bay</b> of Biscay <b>anchovy</b> and (4) Pacific sardine.

Killifishes include mummichog in the salt marsh habitats, striped killifish over sandy habitat, and sheepshead minnow in both habitats. Sticklebacks, including fourspine and threespine, are spring and summer spawners associated with submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV); although they are very abundant, their use as prey for other fish and birds is limited due to spines, body armor, and close association with vegetative cover. Northern pipefish s) is a zooplankton consumer preyed upon by both striped bass and summer flounder. American sandlance, probably the most abundant winter species, provides important forage for many species of special emphasis in the Bight. Summer flounder enter the bay in winter and spring and grow rapidly in the productive waters. The bay supports significant shellfishery for northern quahog and is a major spawning, nursery, and foraging area for blue crab.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} influence of predator and prey behavior {{on the outcome of}} size-structured species interactions between piscivorous fishes and their prey. A primary focus was to evaluate the relative susceptibility of <b>bay</b> <b>anchovy</b> to predation and identify potential mechanisms responsible for differences among <b>bay</b> <b>anchovy</b> and other common forage species. ^ <b>Bay</b> <b>anchovy</b> were highly susceptible to capture by bluefish and required minimal handling time. <b>Bay</b> <b>anchovy</b> greater than 40 % of bluefish body size were highly profitable prey, which is not typical for most piscivore-prey interactions. Bluefish selected large <b>bay</b> <b>anchovy</b> when given a choice of prey sizes. High attack proportions on larger <b>bay</b> <b>anchovy</b> may have been influenced by size-related differences in antipredator behaviors. Results indicate that <b>bay</b> <b>anchovy</b> probably never achieve a size refuge from predation. ^ Compared to other common forage species, <b>bay</b> <b>anchovy</b> were the easiest prey to capture, required low handling times, and were generally the most profitable prey for piscivores. Short reaction distances to approaching predators may have contributed to disparate susceptibilities to capture among forage species. Findings highlight the potential importance of life history strategy and phylogeny in determining the effectiveness of the antipredator behaviors expressed by prey. ^ Piscivores consistently selected <b>bay</b> <b>anchovy</b> over several alternative forage species. Attack proportions were highly skewed toward <b>bay</b> <b>anchovy</b> prey. Forage species differed considerably in the expression of antipredator behaviors related to use of refuge, tank positioning, activity levels, schooling aggregation, and the frequency of stragglers. Piscivores displayed several attack strategies, but mostly attacked solitary prey individuals. Differences in antipredator behavior appeared to directly influence predator attacks, suggesting that differential attack proportions among prey may not necessarily represent active choice by piscivores. ^ Piscivores differed in their patterns of resource utilization, with bluefish achieving piscivory earlier and consuming larger prey sizes compared to striped bass. Behavioral foraging abilities differed markedly between piscivores, with bluefish foraging efficiency reaching levels nearly four times those reached by striped bass. When prey resources were limited, bluefish grew faster than expected and were able to exploit prey at the expense of striped bass. Findings indicate the importance of available forage fish of appropriate size to the onset of piscivory in striped bass. ...|$|E

We compare intertemporal viable trajectories with the trajectory resulting from a cooperative game in which the two countries agree on the maximization of the fishery's total profit.

40|$|Recruitment of <b>bay</b> <b>anchovy</b> (Anchoa mitchilli) in Chesapeake {{is related}} to {{variability}} in hydrological conditions and to abundance and spatial distribution of spawning stock biomass (SSB). Midwater-trawl surveys conducted for six years, over the entire 320 -km length of the bay, provided information on anchovy SSB, annual spatial patterns of recruitment, and their relationships to variability in the estuarine environment. SSB of anchovy varied sixfold in 1995 – 2000; it alone explained little variability in young-of-the-year (YOY) recruitment level in October, which varied ninefold. Recruitments were low in 1995 and 1996 (47 and 31 Z 109) but higher in 1997 – 2000 (100 to 265 Z 109). During the recruitment process the YOY population migrated upbay before a subsequent fall-winter downbay migration. The extent of the downbay migration by maturing recruits was greatest in years of high freshwater input to the bay.

40|$|The migratory {{population}} of striped bass (Morone saxatilis) (> 400 mm total length[TL]) spends {{winter in the}} Atlantic Ocean off the Virginia and North Carolina coasts of the United States. Information on trophic dynamics for these large adults during winter is limited. Feeding habits and prey were described from stomach contents of 1154 striped bass ranging from 373 to 1250 mm TL, collected from trawls during winters of 1994 - 96, 2000, and 2002 - 03, and from the recreational fishery during 2005 - 07.

40|$|Recruitment of <b>bay</b> <b>anchovy</b> (Anchoa mitchilli) varies {{annually}} in Chesapeake Bay, and levels and patterns {{are related to}} variability in hydrological conditions and the spatial distribution of spawning stock biomass. Midwater-trawl surveys, conducted three times annually from 1995 - 1999, over the entire 320 -km length of the Bay, provided information on annual and regional patterns of recruitment, and their relationships to variability in the estuarine environment. Adult biomass of anchovy within the Bay {{at the beginning of}} spawning seasons in 1995 - 1999 varied six-fold, but it alone was not directly related to the young-of-the-year (YOY) recruitment level. Levels of recruitment in October were low in 1995 and 1996 (6 to 7 X 109) but higher in 1997 - 1999 (19 to 52 X 109). An important feature of the recruitment process is an ontogenetic migration in which YOY <b>bay</b> <b>anchovy</b> tended to move upbay until they are approximately 45 mm TL, after which they begin to move downbay. The strong salinity gradient may act as a partial barrier to upbay or downbay migration, the effect being more pronounced for small (< 60 mm TL) anchovy. However, seasonal water temperature was more important in determining the latitudinal distribution of spawning stock biomass. Late-summer recruitment of YOY anchovy was high when water temperature was low in April-May, inhibiting upbay migration of adults {{at the onset of the}} spawning season, and insuring that most spawning occurred in the lower and middle region of the Bay. A modified Ricker stock-recruitment model that included the latitudinal range of adult migration between April and July, explained 98 % of recruitment variability...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the role of predation on eggs and larvae in the recruitment of anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus), sardine (Sardina pilchardus), sprat (Sprattus sprattus) and 52 macrozooplankton taxa were assayed for anchovy remains in the gut during the 2010 spawning season using a molecular method. This real-time PCR based assay was capable of detecting 0. 005. ng of anchovy DNA (roughly 1 / 100 of a single egg assay) in a reliable way and allowed detecting predation events up to 6. h after ingestion by small zooplankton taxa. A total of 1069 macrozooplankton individuals, 237 sardines and 213 sprats were tested. Both fish species and 32 macrozooplankton taxa showed remains of anchovy DNA within their stomach contents. The two main findings are (1) that the previously neglected macrozooplankton impact in anchovy eggs/larvae mortality {{is in the same}} order of magnitude of that due to planktivorous fishes and that, (2) the predation pressure was notably different in the two main spawning centers of <b>Bay</b> of Biscay <b>anchovy.</b> While relatively low mortality rates were recorded at the shelf-break spawning center, a higher predation pressure from both fish and macrozooplankton was exerted at the shelf one...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the viability of}} the management of a transboundary resource, the <b>Bay</b> of Biscay <b>anchovy</b> (Engraulis encrasicolus L.). A deterministic model is used to simulate the anchovy dynamics, with the fish stock consisting of two age groups, “young" and “old", while recruitment follows a Beverton Holt pattern. Two countries, France and Spain, harvest the resource, with two different types of gear, the purse seiner for Spain and the pelagic trawler for France. These technologies impact the different age-groups of anchovy at differing rates. A regulatory agency defines an annual fishing quota and its allocation between the two countries, with the aim of sustainability in the overall allocation design. A set of constraints is defined to describe the sustainability of the system which encompasses the economic, ecological and social aspects of the fishery. The optimal harvest share between the two countries is found and a number of scenarios are then tested in relation to their ability to remain within the set of constraints, or viability kernel. Other scenarios, including the historical trajectory, the optimal harvest share trajectory and the minimum time of crisis trajectory, are examined...|$|R
40|$|The European anchovy, Engraulis encrasicolus, in the Bay of Biscay {{suffered}} a collapse in census population size (Nc) starting in 2002, {{from which it}} did not recover until 2010. The slow recovery raised concern over sustainability, potential reduction in adaptive potential, and vulnerability to local extirpation. Long- and short-term effective population size (Ne), Ne/Nc ratio, and other genetic parameters were estimated to evaluate demographic signals of population decline. A total of 349 neutral single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were screened in 330 anchovy individuals from the Bay of Biscay distributed across a 20 -year period. We show that Nc fluctuations have not significantly affected short-term Ne, and therefore, genetic diversity has remained stable throughout the recent collapse. This study illustrates that Ne estimates should be incorporated into management plans. Our results on short-term Ne suggested that the <b>anchovy</b> in the <b>Bay</b> of Biscay has not faced any recent severe threat of losing evolutionary potential due to genetic drift. However, differences between short- and long-term Ne estimates suggested that the <b>Bay</b> of Biscay <b>anchovy</b> population may be currently much smaller than in the historical past. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|R
