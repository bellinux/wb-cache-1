25|$|A lean loose-jointed Negro had {{commenced}} plunking {{a guitar}} <b>beside</b> <b>me</b> while I slept... As he played, he pressed a knife on {{the strings of}} the guitar in a manner popularized by Hawaiian guitarists who used steel bars....The singer repeated the line three times, accompanying himself on the guitar with the weirdest music I had ever heard.|$|E
25|$|Then {{it started}} to strike houses. All the parcels of goods which were on board shifted {{toward the front of}} the plane. I noticed <b>beside</b> <b>me</b> a hole by which I left without knowing how, and I fell into a mud puddle. I then could {{contemplate}} the flames which consumed the plane. It was not about excess weight. It's a simple mechanical failure.|$|E
6000|$|Annie {{believed}} that he was making fun of her, {{and she tried to}} make her resentful silence dignified; but she only answered sadly: [...] "No; it isn't enough for <b>me.</b> <b>Besides,</b> he made <b>me</b> see that you can't give sympathy where you can't receive it." ...|$|R

25|$|Since {{it was not}} my {{intention}} to interrupt my achievement (the OSM), but that it continue under the responsibility of the Board of the Symphony and the competent and able technicians that they would recruit, I had no other choice but to remain as director of the orchestra, with the greatest and best desire that the new artistic director that we selected to formally work <b>beside</b> <b>me,</b> José Pablo Moncayo, would arrive to take full responsibility of the situation.|$|E
500|$|As in Islam, a {{fundamental}} tenet of Judaism is that God is {{not bound by}} any limitations of time, matter, or space, and {{that the idea of}} any person being God, a part of God, or a mediator to God, is heresy. The Book of Ezra, which Judaism accepts as a chronicle of the life of Ezra and which predates Muhammad and the Qur'an by around 1000 years, gives Ezra's human lineage as being the son of Seraiah and a direct descendant of Aaron. Tractate Ta'anit of the Jerusalem Talmud, which predates Muhammad by two to three hundred years, states that “if a man claims to be God, he is a liar.” Exodus Rabba 29 says, [...] "'I am the first and I am the last, and <b>beside</b> <b>Me</b> there is no God' I am the first, I have no father; I am the last, I have no brother. <b>Beside</b> <b>Me</b> there is no God; I have no son." [...] However the term 'sons of gods' occurs in Genesis. The Encyclopedia of Judaism clarifies that the title of 'son of God' is attributed a person whose piety has placed him in a very near relationship to God and [...] "by no means carries the idea of physical descent from, and essential unity with, God".|$|E
500|$|Davis {{was pleased}} with the episode; he stated [...] "For me the episode was terrific to play because they ended up making the Cigarette Smoking Man {{somewhat}} tougher. We have seen so much softness in him; it was great to play that tough side." [...] He described the scene in which he was strapped to an operating table with Mulder as [...] "totally uncomfortable". He joked that [...] "the only upside of that was that the author [...] was lying right <b>beside</b> <b>me,</b> feeling equally uncomfortable. I wonder if David would have written it that way if he had known what he would have to go through." ...|$|E

500|$|In old age, Bush {{continued}} to lead {{an active and}} productive life, punctuated by periodic commemorations {{of his life and}} works. [...] In November 1975 his 50 years' professorship at the RAM was marked in a concert there, and in January 1976 the WMA gave a concert to honour his recent 75th birthday. In 1977 he produced his last major piano work, the Twenty-four Preludes, Op. 84, of which he gave the first performance at the Wigmore Hall on 30 October 1977. A later [...] reviewer described this piece as [...] "music I'd like to have playing <b>beside</b> <b>me</b> as I sprawled on the grass beneath the trees with an ice-cream, watching a county cricket match on a golden afternoon".|$|E
500|$|Back in Washington in {{the fall}} of 1969, he met Elizabeth Kloepfer (identified in Bundy {{literature}} as Meg Anders, Beth Archer, or Liz Kendall), a divorcée from Ogden, Utah, who worked as a secretary at the University of Washington School of Medicine. Their stormy relationship would continue well past his initial incarceration in Utah in 1976. In mid 1970, now focused and goal oriented, he reenrolled at UW, this time as a psychology major. He became an honor student, well regarded by his professors. In 1971 he took a job at Seattle's Suicide Hotline crisis center. There he met and worked alongside Ann Rule, a former Seattle police officer and aspiring crime writer who would later write one of the definitive Bundy biographies, The Stranger <b>Beside</b> <b>Me.</b> Rule saw nothing disturbing in Bundy's personality at the time, describing him as [...] "kind, solicitous, and empathetic".|$|E

6000|$|... "Why now, child, you've {{got a lot}} of notions. Besides what's {{the matter}} with the town? Looks good to me.

6000|$|... "I {{would think}} that Jim Welton had changed his nature," [...] replied Jones, whose anger {{disappeared}} {{as quickly as it}} came. [...] "I have no objection to your storming at me, Jim. You may swear at me as much as you please, but, for any sake, spare me your reasonings and entreaties, because they only rouse the evil spirit within me, without doing an atom of good; and don't talk of leaving <b>me.</b> <b>Besides,</b> let <b>me</b> tell you, you are not so disinterested in this matter as you think.

2500|$|Eleven {{weeks and}} one day after Hearst's death, Davies married Horace Brown on October 31, 1951, in Las Vegas. It was not a happy marriage. Davies filed for divorce twice, but neither was finalized, despite Brown admitting he treated her badly: [...] "I'm a beast," [...] he said. [...] "I took him back. I don't know why," [...] she explained. [...] "I guess because he's {{standing}} right <b>beside</b> <b>me,</b> crying. Thank God {{we all have a}} sense of humor." ...|$|E
2500|$|Weeks later, CNN's Randi Kaye told an {{audience}} at West Virginia University {{that she had}} been listening to Cooper's interview from outside the Sago Baptist Church."I heard this unfolding on our air and I must have said something out loud because there was a print photographer standing <b>beside</b> <b>me</b> and he said, 'Did you just say what I think you said?' and I said, 'I think there's only one alive,'" [...] the CNHI News Service quoted Kaye as saying.|$|E

2500|$|The {{following}} {{is an example of}} this type of experience: ‘My husband died in June 1945, and 26 years afterwards when I was at Church, I felt him standing <b>beside</b> <b>me</b> during the singing of a hymn. I felt I would see him if I turned my head. The feeling was so strong I was reduced to tears. I had not been thinking of him before I felt his presence. I had not had this feeling before that day, neither has it happened since then.’ ...|$|E
2500|$|Maurice Ravel [...] did {{not have}} {{confidence}} in me for the Boléro. He was afraid that my Mediterranean temperament would overtake me, and that I would rush the tempo. I assembled the orchestra at the Salle Pleyel, and Ravel took a seat <b>beside</b> <b>me.</b> Everything went well until the final part, where, in spite of myself, I increased the tempo by a fraction. Ravel jumped up, came over and pulled at my jacket: [...] "not so fast", he exclaimed, {{and we had to}} begin again.|$|E
2500|$|After {{making some}} clumsy errors {{at a couple}} of hurdles he started to pick up the speed in the back {{straight}} with his jumping improving considerably at a faster pace until 2 out at which he blundered allowing Jezki and The New One to gain advantage on the outside, Ruby Walsh reporting: “When Jezki and The New One came up <b>beside</b> <b>me,</b> they didn’t go by me. He was straight back on to it, and away with him. He’s just a very, very good horse, with a mighty engine.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Then {{looking at}} him darkly Zeus who gathers the clouds spoke to him:"Do not sit <b>beside</b> <b>me</b> and whine, you {{double-faced}} liar.To me {{you are the most}} hateful of all gods who hold Olympus.Forever quarrelling is dear to your heart, wars and battles.…And yet I will not long endure to see you in pain, sinceyou are my child, and it was to me that your mother bore you.But were you born of some other god and proved so ruinouslong since you would have been dropped beneath the gods of the bright sky." ...|$|E
2500|$|I {{was looking}} {{directly}} at the flash... hardly thicker than my finger ... it passed within two feet of my eyes.

2500|$|Manilow {{produced}} the 1991 album With My Lover <b>Beside</b> <b>Me</b> by legendary jazz vocalist Nancy Wilson.
