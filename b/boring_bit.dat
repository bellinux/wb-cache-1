Fake Jack Silver is voiced by sound effects engineer Bryan Bishop, as mentioned on the December 14, 2006 show. Fake Jack Silver frequently mentions staying [...] "hip" [...] with younger listeners and talks about watching the ratings [...] "needle" [...] drop, or refers to [...] "radio-kryptonite" [...] when a <b>boring</b> <b>bit</b> or caller is on the air. Fake Jack Silver's biggest concern is being portrayed as homosexual, and thus the last thing he usually says is, in a stressed voice, [...] "Not gay!"

40|$|Most {{developing}} countries continue to face serious problems in developing adequate and responsive tax systems. This paper reviews the three principal {{ways in which}} {{developing countries}} may expand and improve their taxation systems - base-broadening, rate reduction, and administrative improvement - {{in the context of}} the political economy of tax reform. While each of these paths to reform is essential, in the end what 50 years of experience tells us is that improving the transparency and understanding with which fiscal issues are discussed by all relevant players, both within and outside government, is the really essential ingredient to developing viable and sustainable tax systems in developing countries. Such institution-building activities are not a <b>boring</b> <b>bit</b> of infrastructure to be brushed aside in order to get into the real business of making this or that substantive reform in tax policy or administration: they are the "real business" with which serious tax reformers in any country should be most concerned.

50|$|In {{traditional}} {{raise boring}} operations, mining companies use a drilling technique known as ‘up-reaming’. Normally, {{this type of}} rig first drills a small pilot hole downward, then large machine cutters {{are attached to the}} drill which is sticking out the bottom of the pilot hole. The massive cutters are pulled up as they grind through thick rock, boring along the pilot hole. In this case however, since the space below was blocked and the raise <b>bore</b> <b>bit</b> could not be attached from underground, the rig was modified to widen the hole from above.|$|R

The final properties of the materials depend on the kinetics and thermodynamics of the interface processes.

5000|$|Forstner {{was born}} in Beaver County, Pennsylvania. His {{successful}} invention of the Forstner bit, patented in 1886,was {{to make him a}} rich man. Without the lead screw (which Forstner called the [...] "gimlet-point") and cutting lips of more conventional wood <b>boring</b> <b>bits</b> it would prove especially useful to gunsmiths like himself and other high-end woodworkers. The bit was unsurpassed in drilling an exceedingly smooth-sided hole with a flat bottom. It was better than the Russell Jennings twist <b>bits</b> for <b>boring</b> at an angle and not following the grain of the wood. Forstner eventually worked out licensing arrangements for the manufacture and sale of his bit by a number of companies, most notably two Connecticut firms: the Colt's Manufacturing Company of Hartford and the Bridgeport Gun Implement Company, successors (in 1886) to the Union Metallic Cartridge Company. Even today, the Forstner bit continues to be manufactured, although it has changed to a split-ring design.|$|R

He expands on this by writing, [...] "Other reviewers have complained of the long, <b>boring</b> <b>bits</b> in between each scandalous act, completely missing the point," [...] and he explains that unlike many films of its genre, Silip delivers its message [...] "in small-scale epic fashion, with a lyric beauty that's hard to argue against. Using the desert-like scenery to maximum effect, nearly every shot is beautiful to look at, fostering a meditative, sweaty atmosphere that's truly unique." [...] He goes on to praise the cinematography and the simultaneous themes that play out in the film and summarizes [...] "While the women-are-the-root-of-all-evil message is ultimately distasteful, the truths exposed, and the path we're lead sic down in getting there, consists of quite a sumptuous, sensuous journey." ...|$|R
