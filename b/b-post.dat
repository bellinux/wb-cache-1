50|$|The {{interior}} was also much modified over that of earlier cars. There {{was a new}} dashboard with large speedometer and tachometer instruments in twin binnacles closer to the driver's line of sight. The instruments were mounted at a more conventional angle, avoiding the reflections caused by the upward angled flat dash of earlier cars. Conversely, auxiliary instruments were moved to angled bezels in the centre console, further from the driver's line of sight than before. The new seats introduced adjustable headrests which merged with {{the top of the}} seat when fully down. The window winder levers, the door release levers and the quarterlight vent knobs were also restyled. The remote release for the boot (trunk) lid, located {{on the inside of the}} door opening on the <b>B-post</b> just under the door lock striker, was moved from the right hand side of the car to the left hand side. The location of this item was always independent of whether the car was left hand drive or right hand drive.|$|E
5000|$|In 1968, {{concurrently}} {{with the}} replacement of the Giulia Sprint GT Veloce by the 1750 GTV, the GT 1300 Junior was revised with many of the new parts from the 1750 GTV. This included the dashboard, the suspension and the new wheel size of 5½ × 14J instead of 4½ × 15J. This revised GT 1300 Junior, however, retained the early [...] "step-front" [...] body style, which, interestingly, makes it the most mechanically refined production [...] "step-front" [...] model. Another intriguing detail is that, just as on the 1750 GTV, the remote release for the boot (trunk) lid, located {{on the inside of the}} door opening on the <b>B-post</b> just under the door lock striker, was moved from the right hand side of the car to the left hand side. The location of this item was always independent of whether the car was left hand drive or right hand drive. This series of GT 1300 Junior was the only model with the step-front bodyshell to have this item mounted on the left hand side. All other step-front models - Giulia Sprint GT, Giulia Sprint GT Veloce, and early GT 1300 Junior with flat dashboard - featured this item on the right hand side.|$|E
50|$|Reliant began {{planning}} a convertible in 1977 and commissioned Ogle Design {{to create a}} proposal. Tom Karen adapted his earlier GTE design and created a four-seater convertible with a good-sized boot. From the <b>B-post</b> back, all of the panels were new, with extra bracing introduced between the rear side panels and door hinge plates running under the dashboard. The roll hoop from the GTE was retained, and for additional support this was linked to extra tubes running around the front screen creating a Triumph Stag-like T-bar design that would ensure the rigidity of the new body design. As the car sported a separate chassis and the extra bracing, it did not suffer from the scuttle shake that unibody convertibles may suffer.The hood was designed in house by adapting the hood frame from a Triumph Stag, with a bespoke cover made of mohair.A prototype car was produced in 1978 (still in existence today), powered by a 3.0 Essex engine. Later Reliant {{replaced it with a}} 2.8 Cologne engine, because Ford had withdrawn their Essex engines from the European market in favour of the Cologne unit. This was slightly down on torque compared to the Essex engine, so to improve performance Reliant changed the final drive ratio from 3.31 to 3.54. The GTC was launched in March 1980, with a hardtop added after the Birmingham Motor Show that year. While it was well received by the motoring press, in 1980 the country was heading into a recession and Reliant struggled to sell their £11,360 convertibles in great numbers. As a result, many cars were left sitting at the factory for months until owners could be found. By 1986 the Scimitar GTC cost 20% more than a Ford Escort XR3i Cabriolet, a similar offering in respect of seats and performance. Today the GTC is a very rare sight on our roads. Fewer than 300 remain, according to www.howmanyleft.co.uk - and it is possibly the most desirable of the Scimitar models, a fact reflected in its relatively high survival rate.|$|E
50|$|The Laurel C34 was {{no longer}} {{available}} in hardtop sedan configuration; the single body style offered was the regular saloon with <b>B-posts.</b> Gone as well was the four-cylinder engine. Available engines included a 2.0 L six (SOHC or DOHC), a 2.5 L DOHC six and a 2.8 L diesel six.|$|R
50|$|The third {{generation}} appeared in January 1977. For the first time, the C230 {{was available in}} either saloon and hardtop coupé form, {{but also as a}} hardtop saloon without <b>B-posts.</b> The hardtop was only available with six-cylinder engines. Buyers could choose between a 1.8-litre four, a 2.0-litre inline-six (carburetted or fuel-injected, a first for the Laurel), a 2.8-litre six, or a 2.0-litre diesel four, sourced from Nissan Diesel. Transmissions were mainly four- or five-speed manuals or a three-speed automatic, although a three-speed manual with a column shift was also available in the lower spec and commercial versions. In the autumn of 1978 the C230 received a mild facelift (type C231), marked visually by squared instead of round double headlights. The Toyota competitor was the Mark II coupé and sedan. Again, comfort was prioritized over handling and agility.|$|R
5000|$|Changes include {{increased}} {{engine performance}} (from Continental GT Speed), a ZF eight-speed transmission, a redesigned {{body with a}} lower, wider appearance with sharp lines and gently curvaceous surfaces; a new wing vent at the front fenders; new body structure including reinforcement to the <b>B-posts,</b> sills and front crossmembers combined with deformable components in the floorpan for optimal load transfer; a deployable aluminium bonnet that includes both new reinforcement panels and deformation elements; 600 new interior parts, lightweight acoustic underfloor panels, side glazing and both front and rear screens made in acoustic glass; a heating and ventilation system with a new Thermostatic Expansion Valve (with optional Climate Boost function), new 19" [...] tyres with a 12% relative increase in sidewall height, suspension spring rates are softened front and rear by 10% and 13% respectively, anti-roll bars softened by 13% and 15% to improve single wheel impact absorption, suspension lever bushes all-round softened by at least 25% for reduced road noise and vibration, revised continuous damping control (CDC),and new 19-inch Classic wheels in bright-painted or diamond turned finishes (optional 20-inch five-spoke, 21-inch six-spoke and 21-inch ten-spoke wheels).Flying Spur W12 Mulliner includes five additional hides, expanding the number of available shades to 17, five further wood veneers choices, 21-inch five-spoke two-piece alloy wheels, Mulliner name at treadplates and the chrome details on the wing vent, diamond-quilted seats and door panels with perforated hides, drilled alloy sports pedals and a knurled sports gear lever.|$|R
5000|$|To {{homologate}} the 205 T16 ("Turbo 16" [...] in France) Group B rally car, Peugeot had {{to produce}} 200 road-going examples. According to the Group B regulations, these {{had to be}} based on a current production road car. Peugeot decided to base the Group B rally car on the two door version of the 205. The engine was based on the cast iron block of the Diesel version of the then new XU engine family, albeit with a specially developed 16-valve head. The gearbox came from the Citroen SM but was mounted transversely. The car had all wheel drive. The body was built by Heuliez, where standard three door bodyshells from the production line were delivered and heavily modified. Heuliez cut off the complete rear of the car and welded in a transverse firewall between the <b>B-posts.</b> The rear frame was then built in a mixture of sheet steel profiles and tubes. The front was modified in a similar way with a tube frame carrying the front suspension. The completed bodies were delivered to Simca (Talbot) for the 200-series production cars and to Peugeot Talbot Sport for the competition versions. All street versions (VINs P1 to P200) were left hand drive and identically kitted out in dark grey colour, except the first (VIN P1) that was painted white and carried all the competition cars’ decoration for demonstration purposes. The competition cars of the first evolution series (VIN C1 to C20) were built at the sport department Peugeot Talbot Sport and presented to the public at the same day as the standard street version. Later competition vehicles of the Evolution 2 series (VIN C201 to C220) were built differently as the rear spaceframe had no more sheet steel profiles in it but was completely made from tubes only.|$|R
