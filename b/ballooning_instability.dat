40|$|The {{sawtooth}} crash is a hazardous, disruptive {{phenomenon that}} is observed in tokamaks whenever the safety factor at the magnetic axis is below unity. Recently, Tokamak Test Fusion Reactor (TFTR) experimental data has revealed interesting {{features of the}} dynamical pressure evolution during the crash phase. Motivated by the experimental results, this dissertation focuses on theoretical modeling of the finite pressure effects on the nonlinear stage of the sawtooth crash. The crash phase has been studied numerically employed a toroidal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) initial value code deduced from the FAR code. For the first time, by starting from a concentric equilibrium, {{it has been shown}} that the evolution through an m/n = 1 / 1 magnetic island induces secondary high-n <b>ballooning</b> <b>instabilities.</b> The magnetic island evolution gives rise to convection of the pressure inside the inversion radius and builds up a steep pressure gradient across the island separatrix, or current sheet, and thereby triggers <b>ballooning</b> <b>instabilities</b> below the threshold for the axisymmetric equilibrium. Due to the onset of secondary ballooning modes, concomitant fine scale vortices and magnetic stochasticity are generated. These effects produce strong flows across the current sheet, and thereby significant modify the m = 1 driven magnetic reconnection process. The resultant interaction of the high-n ballooning modes with the magnetic reconnection process is discussed...|$|R

30|$|In the {{previous}} section, {{we have identified}} sources of the Pi 2 pulsations employed in the MHD simulation of the sub-storm from the numerical results of the global MHD simulation. The candidates of the generation mechanisms— the TR and the PVR may be reproduced in the global MHD simulation if defects of the global MHD simulation (namely, lack of the plasmasphere, numerical diffusion of the Alfvén wave, and imperfect reflection of the MHD wave injected into the ionosphere) are resolved. Meanwhile, resent observations suggest that the high-speed plasma flow in the plasma sheet exhibits the Pi 2 -like oscillatory behaviors {{at the onset of}} the substorm (Kepko and Kivelson, 1999). In particular, Keiling (2012) reported that the Pi 2 pulsation which appears before the auroral break-up is possibly generated by the drift <b>ballooning</b> <b>instability</b> (Miura et al., 1989). As for the theoretical study, Cheng and Zaharia (2004) investigated the <b>ballooning</b> <b>instability</b> in the plasma sheet in the growth phase of the substorm based on the ideal MHD magnetosphere model from Tyganenko. After their analysis, low-frequency MHD waves are unstable in the plasma sheet for the <b>ballooning</b> <b>instability</b> in the growth phase. This wave may be a source of the Pi 2 pulsation although the nonlinear evolution of the <b>ballooning</b> <b>instability</b> in the magnetosphere has not been studied yet. Therefore, it seems meaningful to investigate that the plasma sheet in the growth phase is unstable or not for the <b>ballooning</b> <b>instability</b> based on the global MHD simulation. It is noted that the present MHD simulation does not reproduce the <b>ballooning</b> <b>instability.</b> This does not mean the plasma sheet stable for the <b>ballooning</b> <b>instability,</b> but insufficient mesh resolution of the present simulation may prevent realization of the instability (Zhu et al., 2009).|$|E
30|$|To draw {{a firmer}} {{conclusion}} {{about the role}} of kinetic <b>ballooning</b> <b>instability</b> in the substorm onset and expansion mechanism, more data and further analytical and simulation studies are needed to verify the theory. In particular, it is constructive to determine the 3 D plasma and magnetic field structure of the magnetosphere in the late growth phase in both observation and theory/model. This will help determine the stability of kinetic <b>ballooning</b> <b>instability</b> in the late growth phase and its 3 D wave structure and propagation and examine how electrons are accelerated into the ionosphere to produce the wave-like substorm onset arcs. However, we should caution that instability mechanisms (e.g., Lui 2004) other than the kinetic <b>ballooning</b> <b>instability</b> should also be examined for understanding the substorm onset phenomena. At present, the features of the kinetic <b>ballooning</b> <b>instability</b> {{seem to be able to}} explain the ionospheric and magnetospheric observational features of substorms.

Superimposed on the toroidal field is a much weaker poloidal field generated by an electric current flowing in the plasma around the tours, so the plasma forms the secondary circuit of a transformer. Today, most tokomaks have an elongated cross section. The reason for using an elongated cross section comes out essentially from problems {{that are related to}} MHD instabilities like kink and <b>ballooning</b> <b>instabilities</b> [1, 2, 3, 4].

These phenomena are illustrated numerically for the three-field-period heliac H- 1, and contrasted with an axisymmetric s-α tokamak model.

30|$|Theories of instabilities (e.g., Lui et al. 1991; Roux et al. 1991; Yoon et al. 1994, 1996; Lui 1996; Zhu and Winglee 1996; Liu 1997; Pu et al. 1997; Voronkov et al. 1997; Cheng and Lui 1998; Perraut et al. 2000; Cheng 2004) {{have been}} {{proposed}} to explain the underlying mechanisms that initiate the onset of substorm expansion. To investigate the relationship between wave-like auroral arcs and instabilities, kinetic <b>ballooning</b> <b>instability</b> has drawn much attention. Cheng and Lui (1998) studied the kinetic <b>ballooning</b> <b>instability</b> by including trapped electron dynamics and finite ion gyroradius effects to explain the Pi 2 disturbance excited prior to the initiation of current disruption. The kinetic <b>ballooning</b> <b>instability</b> calculations {{have shown that the}} most unstable modes occur in the strong cross-tail current region that maps to the ionosphere to form a substorm auroral arc formation similar to the ideal MHD calculation results (Cheng and Zaharia 2004). Saito et al. 2008 reported substorm events in which GEOTAIL observes the ballooning mode perturbations initiated ~ 2  min prior to the dipolarization onset. Panov et al. (2012) showed the THEMIS spacecraft observations of field and plasma oscillations prior to breakup, which confirm the predictions of the kinetic ballooning/interchange instability. Chang et al. (2012) and Xing et al. (2013) also examined the role of the kinetic <b>ballooning</b> <b>instability</b> in a substorm event and explain several observational features. Because the kinetic <b>ballooning</b> <b>instability</b> has finite parallel electric field and high azimuthal mode number, it is suggested that the excitation of kinetic <b>ballooning</b> <b>instability</b> may be responsible for producing the pre-onset wave-like arc brightness structure in the ionosphere during substorm.|$|E

Therefore, before the substorm onset, the near-Earth plasma sheet becomes more tail-like {{and more likely to}} be subject to the <b>ballooning</b> <b>instability</b> without the stabilizing influence of the compressibility, when the critical plasma β due to the stabilizing tension force is exceeded.

40|$|A magnetospheric energy {{principle}} is formulated to study hydromagnetic stability of a magnetospheric plasma. The magnetospheric plasma is {{either in a}} two-dimensional or three-dimensional static equilibrium. It is surrounded by lateral perfectly conducting walls and ideal ionospheres in both cases and also by dawn-dusk periodic boundaries in the two-dimensional case. The two-dimensional case has a translational symmetry and has no unperturbed magnetic field component in the dawn-dusk direction. Unlike the conventional energy principle for a plasma surrounded by a perfectly conducting wall, field lines are assumed to vertically thread the ionospheric boundary, {{which is not a}} perfectly conducting rigid wall. Ideal ionospheric boundary conditions are obtained, so that the force operator becomes self-adjoint and the magnetospheric energy {{principle is}} valid. There are four ideal ionospheric boundary conditions to satisfy these requirements: horizontally free, conducting, free, and rigid. A change in the potential energy becomes equal to the sum of the change in the fluid energy and an ionospheric surface contribution, which is negative and thus destabilizing for horizontally free and free ionospheric boundary conditions. A minimization condition for the change in the potential energy is obtained. When an unperturbed field-aligned current vanishes, the horizontally free, conducting, free, and rigid boundary conditions allow interchange, incompressible ballooning, incompressible ballooning, and compressible ballooning modes, respectively. Different characteristics of those three pressure-driven modes are clarified. Existing interchange stability criteria are compared and results of several different numerical stability analyses of <b>ballooning</b> <b>instabilities</b> for different magnetospheric equilibria are discussed systematically in light of the present magnetospheric energy principle...|$|R

During the growth phase, {{as a result of}} enhanced plasma convection, the plasma pressure and its gradient are continued to be enhanced over the quiet-time values in the plasma sheet. Toward the late growth phase, a strong cross-tail current sheet is formed in the near-Earth plasma sheet region, where a local magnetic well is formed, the plasma beta can reach a local maximum with value larger than 50 and the cross-tail current density can be enhanced to over 10 nA/m{sup 2 } as obtained from 3 D quasi-static magnetospheric equilibrium solutions for the growth phase. The most unstable kinetic <b>ballooning</b> <b>instabilities</b> (KBI) are expected to be located in the tailward side of the strong cross-tail current sheet region. The field lines in the most unstable KBI region map to the transition region between the region- 1 and region- 2 currents in the ionosphere, which is consistent with the observed initial brightening location of the breakup arc in the intense proton precipitation region. The KBI explains the AMPTE/CCE observations that a low-frequency instability with a wave period of 50 - 75 seconds is excited about 2 - 3 minutes prior to substorm onset and grows exponentially to a large amplitude at the onset of current disruption (or current reduction). At the current disruption onset higher frequency instabilities are excited so that the plasma and electromagnetic field fluctuations form a strong turbulent state. Plasma transport takes place due to the strong turbulence to relax the ambient plasma pressure profile so that the plasma pressure and current density are reduced and the ambient magnetic field intensity increases by more than a factor of 2 in the high-beta(sub) eq region and the field line geometry recovers from tail-like to dipole-like dipolarization...|$|R
