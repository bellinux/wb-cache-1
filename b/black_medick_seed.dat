40|$|For stockless {{organic farming}} {{cultivation}} of leguminous cover crops {{is an important}} source for the nitrogen supply of organic cropping systems. However, too strongly developing living mulch systems may affect the undersown cash crop. At two experimental sites in Bavaria {{the impact of the}} sowing date of cover crops on grain yield of the undersown cash crop winter rye and the subsequent crop spring oat was determined in two and three field trials, respectively (2003 / 04 / 05 until 2004 / 05 / 06 and 2002 / 03 / 04 until 2004 / 05 / 06, respectively). Living mulch treatments were white clover and grass-clover (alfalfa, red and white clover, diverse grasses) with seeding in autumn and spring as well as red clover and <b>black</b> <b>medick</b> with <b>seeding</b> only in autumn. Additionally, a control (rye without cover crop) and a legume stubble seed were grown. The impact of cover crops’ sowing date was crucial to cash crop and subsequent crop. Undersowings in autumn (above all grass clover mixture), but not in spring negatively affected the grain yield of the undersown rye. On average 26...|$|R
50|$|Medicago lupulina, {{commonly}} known as <b>black</b> <b>medick,</b> nonesuch, or hop clover, is a familiar lawn plant belonging to the legume or clover family. Plants of the genus Medicago, or bur clovers, {{are closely related to}} the true clovers (Trifolium) and sweet clover (Melilotus). Like the true clovers, <b>black</b> <b>medick</b> has three leaflets and a small, yellow flower closely resembling those of the lesser trefoil. <b>Black</b> <b>medick</b> belongs to the same genus as alfalfa.|$|R
50|$|<b>Black</b> <b>medick</b> is {{sometimes}} {{used as a}} fodder plant. Its hardiness and ability to grow in poor soils, {{as well as its}} tendency to fix nitrogen in the soil, make <b>black</b> <b>medick</b> a good choice for pasturage, although its fodder value is limited.|$|R
50|$|A common {{sight in}} dry or well-drained lawns, {{where it may}} be {{considered}} a weed, <b>black</b> <b>medick</b> {{is one of the}} flowers used to make honey. It is frequently found in natural pastures, and may be planted in order to create artificial meadows, especially on dry land. The presence of <b>black</b> <b>medick</b> in large concentrations in a lawn may indicate that the soil is poor in nitrogen. However, because <b>black</b> <b>medick</b> and other clovers fix nitrogen in the soil, this deficiency can improve over time due to the presence of these plants.|$|R
5000|$|A {{native of}} the old world, <b>black</b> <b>medick</b> is found {{throughout}} Europe, north Africa, the near east, and most of Asia, including India, China, and Korea. It is naturalized in central Asia, Japan, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, the United States, Canada, and much of South America. [...] <b>Black</b> <b>medick</b> is found throughout the United States, including Hawaii and Alaska.|$|R
50|$|Like other legumes, {{the roots}} of <b>black</b> <b>medick</b> contain nodules hosting nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Plants that survive {{for more than one}} year may develop a deep tap root.|$|R

40|$|This {{report was}} {{presented}} at the UK Organic Research 2002 Conference on behalf of the Colloquium of Organic Researchers (COR). The incidence of weeds and the content of soil nitrogen were investigated {{in the first year of}} a field trial with organic grass seed production in which the grasses were grown with companion legumes. Two grass species, timothy (Phleum pratense L.) cv. Sobol and perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) cv. Baca, were tested together with three legumes: red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) cv. Start, white clover (Trifolium repens L.) cv. Vysocan and <b>black</b> <b>medick</b> (Medicago lupulina L.) cv. Ekola. The N-nutrition and control of weeds were provided by three “ecological” methods and a conventional one (bacterial nodules of legumes, mulch, organic manure and mineral fertilizer). Plots with red clover had the lowest number of weeds, those with <b>black</b> <b>medick</b> the highest. Perennial ryegrass was more competitive than timothy against weeds and the companion legume. Soil nitrogen was highest in plots with white clover and red clover. During the vegetative period the level of soil nitrogen increased in the combinations with red clover, stayed the same in combinations with white clover, but decreased in those with <b>black</b> <b>medick</b> and in control plots...|$|R

40|$|White clover soil fatigue is an {{increasing}} problem in Danish organic dairy farms. The clover cyst nematode (Heterodera trifolii) {{has been found to}} play a major role in the problem. Grassland legume species less readily attacked by H. trifolii and less favourable for its reproduction than white clover may offer possibilities for relieving the soil fatigue. 	In 2005, screenings were made of nine grass-land legume species / varieties in a field with a rather high level of H. trifolii infestation, pre-cropped with grass/white clover, and in a field with a low infesta-tion level, pre-cropped with maize. 	The species grouped in two: 1) White, red, alsike and kura clovers and lucerne had medium to high percentages of nematode attacks and numbers of nematodes pr root, all supported nematode reproduc-tion well, and yields generally were significantly less in the field with higher nematode infestation. 2) Birdsfoot trefoil, <b>black</b> <b>medick</b> and crimson clover had low levels of attacks, few nematodes pr root, and yields were unaffected by field. Only one adult stage nematode occurred in this group (a <b>black</b> <b>medick</b> plant). Hence, this group appeared to be both more resistant to nematode attacks and to support nema-tode reproduction poorly or not at all. ...|$|R

40|$|Leguminous {{cover crops}} are one {{important}} source of nitrogen in organic stockless farming. Therefore the influence of six legume species in pure stands and one grass-clover mixture on grain yield {{and quality of the}} undersown winter rye and of the succeeding crop spring oat was examined. Three field trials were conducted at one experimental site in southern Bavaria (2005 / 06 / 07 until 2007 / 08 / 09; in 2005 / 06 / 07 only three of six leguminous undersowings). Additionally, after the harvest of rye two stubble seeds (clover in pure and mixed stands with vetch and mustard) and a control (rye without cover crop) were established in each year. The cash crop was not affected by the undersown variants with respect to grain yield and quality. However, grain yield of the subsequent oat was generally higher after cover crops compared to the control. Thereby the grain yield after <b>black</b> <b>medick,</b> white or red clover in the undersown variants was significantly higher than after the stubble seeds and after the grass-clover mixture in one and two of three years, respectively. Furthermore the crude protein content of oat was positively affected after all undersown variants in contrast to the variants stubble seed. The cash crop was not affected by the undersown variants with respect to grain yield and quality. However, grain yield of the subsequent oat was generally higher after cover crops compared to the control. Thereby the grain yield after <b>black</b> <b>medick,</b> white or red clover in the undersown variants was higher than after the stubble seeds and after the grass-clover mixture in one and two of three years, respectively.

40|$|The {{possibility}} of annual and perennial legume crops {{to be used}} for undersowing of degraded pasture stands and alfalfa seed production stands was studied in the conditions of the Northern Bulgaria. The direct undersowing of degraded pasture stands was done after harvest with these legumes: birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus L.), red clover (Trifoliumpratense L.), <b>black</b> <b>medick</b> (Medicago lupulina L.), arrowleaf clover (Trifolium vesiculosum Savi), and common vetch (Vicia sativa L.). The undersowing of degraded seed production stands of alfalfa was done in autumn of the fourth year of using with subterranean clover (Tr. subterraneum ssp. brachycalicinum cv. Antas). Red clover showed the best results in terms of suitability for the direct undersowing of degraded pasture stands. Subterranean clover could be used for the direct undersowing of the degraded alfalfa seed production stands due to its self-seeding ability...|$|R
