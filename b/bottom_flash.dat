30|$|In this study, a novel {{configuration}} of <b>bottom</b> <b>flashing</b> system is proposed for dual distillation columns such as direct sequence distillation.

Previous models incorporated condenser and reboiler of a single column. The scope of the proposed model is wider in comparison to previous models. Generally, larger compression ratios are required for systems with larger temperature difference across the column. One of the key advantages of the proposed system {{is that it can}} be applied between two wide boiling distillation systems utilizing a smaller compression ratio, compared to the single columns, which in turn results in higher energy savings and smaller size of <b>bottom</b> <b>flashing</b> system. Additionally, a model is presented that utilizes two interconnected <b>bottom</b> <b>flashing</b> systems.

In referring {{to them as}} the [...] "Cheshire Broads", a comparison is made with the better-known Norfolk Broads. [...] "Flash" [...] is an English dialect word for [...] "lake", with a regional distribution centred on the north-west counties of Cheshire and Lancashire. The Winsford Flashes (Top Flash, Middle Flash, and <b>Bottom</b> <b>Flash,</b> the largest) are three lakes along {{the course of the}} River Weaver, extending over some 200 acres (80 hectares). They formed in the 19th century (cartographical evidence dates their formation to between 1845 and 1872), due to the subsidence of surface ground into underground voids. The voids were largely the result of brine extraction, in which rock salt deposits were dissolved and washed out by water. As the ground slumped into the voids, the River Weaver widened at each point, until lakes were made where arable land had once been. From the late 19th century, Winsford Flashes became popular with working class day-trippers from the nearby industrial centres of Manchester and the Staffordshire Potteries. Visitors came in large numbers for a day's leisure boating, picknicking, and sightseeing.|$|E

Firstly, A novel optimal partial heat integration (OPHI) process is proposed and optimized through the minimization of a newly defined objective function called OF 2 that describes the energy consumption used per product unit flow rate and allows comparison with the literature direct partial and full heat integration processes. We find that the minimum TAC is not achieved by the full heat integration process as intuition, but by the new OPHI process.

30|$|Vapor {{recompression}} and <b>bottom</b> <b>flashing</b> {{are among}} the developed technologies for enhancing energy efficiency of distillation processes. In this paper, a novel configuration of <b>bottom</b> <b>flashing</b> system is proposed for enhancing energy efficiency of dual columns such as direct distillation sequences. The system is designed to operate between two distillation columns. The proposed system engages two separate distillation columns, both {{of which can be}} wide boiling systems. The system incorporates two interacting <b>bottom</b> <b>flashing</b> systems that engage the two distillation columns through heat transfer from the top product of the second column to the bottom product of the first column which in turn results in elimination/reduction of utility requirements of condenser of the second column along with reboiler of the first column.

The {{performance of the}} proposed configurations was investigated on this separation system. Based on temperature difference between the products, this distillation system is a wide boiling one. If vapor recompression, <b>bottom</b> <b>flashing</b> or heat pump assisted distillation systems are applied on the C 1 –C 2 and/or C 2 –C 3 distillation columns, extremely large values of compression ratio (~  3 – 5) will be required for providing the possibility of heat transfer from the top product to the bottom one. This means that application of <b>bottom</b> <b>flashing</b> or vapor recompression on these distillation columns is not economical. However, an opportunity for energy saving may arise when a process engineer considers the two columns together as a system. The systems are operated {{in such a way}} that application of a vapor recompression or <b>bottom</b> <b>flashing</b> system is feasible between two columns.|$|R

30|$|In this work, a {{commercial}} process simulator {{was used as}} a tool for evaluating performance of the systems. The base case (direct sequence) was composed of two distillation columns. Generally, degree of freedom of a conventional two-product distillation column with a condenser and reboiler is 2. Therefore, for a two-product column, it is only possible to specify two specifications. In our simulations for two-product columns, recovery and purity of one of the products were the two used design parameters. These specifications, along with feed conditions and feed stage govern performance of the column. So, the other characteristics of the separation processes (including required reflux ratios, boil up ratios, condenser duties and reboiler duties) were obtained by running the simulation and solving Mass balance, Equilibrium, Summation of mole fractions =  1 and Heat balance (MESH equations) at all stages of the column. The energy requirements of the systems were evaluated by solving MESH equations. In designing the proposed <b>bottom</b> <b>flashing</b> configuration, operating parameters were adjusted to supply the same operating conditions for the columns. The main idea was to reduce energy requirements of the system by transferring heat from top to bottom products. For a specific compression ratio, a fraction of required energy was saved through heat transfer from top to bottom products, and the remaining energy was supplied by heaters/coolers.|$|R

To determine a suitable system for natural gas liquid (NGL) fractionation trains, rigorous analysis and comparative study of several HPAD and SHRT options for the retrofitting of a single column were studied in the present work. The retrofit options considered were vapor compression (VC), mechanical vapor recompression (MVR), thermal vapor recompression (TVR), <b>bottom</b> <b>flashing</b> (BF), side heat exchanger (SHE), intermediate heating and cooling (IHC), self-heat recuperative (SHR) and modified self-heat recuperative (MSHR) distillation.

The data from the simulation was then analyzed to determine the best design in term of energy cost reduction. The analysis shows that the MVR gives the highest energy cost reduction of 68. 11 % as compared to that of the base case (BC) conventional column.

40|$|The Biscayne Bay Benthic Sampling Program {{was divided}} into two phases. In Phase I, sixty {{sampling}} stations were established in Biscayne Bay (including Dumfoundling Bay and Card Sound) representing diverse habitats. The stations were visited in the wet season (late fall of 1981) and in the dry season (midwinter of 1982). At each station certain abiotic conditions were measured or estimated. These included depth, sources of freshwater inflow and pollution, bottom characteristics, current direction and speed, surface and bottom temperature, salinity and dissolved oxygen, and water clarity was estimated with a secchi disk. Seagrass blades and macroalgae were counted in a 0. 1 -m 2 grid placed so as to best represent the bottom community within a 50 -foot radius. Underwater 35 -mm photographs were made of the <b>bottom</b> using <b>flash</b> apparatus. Benthic samples were collected using a petite Ponar dredge.

40|$|A {{number of}} current and {{prospective}} power plant concepts were investigated to evaluate their potential {{to serve as the}} basis of the next generation geothermal power plant (NGGPP). The NGGPP has been envisaged as a power plant that would be more cost competitive (than current geothermal power plants) with fossil fuel power plants, would efficiently use resources and mitigate the risk of reservoir under-performance, and minimize or eliminate emission of pollutants and consumption of surface and ground water. Power plant concepts were analyzed using resource characteristics at ten different geothermal sites located in the western United States. Concepts were developed into viable power plant processes, capital costs were estimated and levelized busbar costs determined. Thus, the study results should be considered as useful indicators of the commercial viability of the various power plants concepts that were investigated. Broadly, the different power plant concepts that were analyzed in this study fall into the following categories: commercial binary and flash plants, advanced binary plants, advanced flash plants, flash/binary hybrid plants, and fossil/geothed hybrid plants. Commercial binary plants were evaluated using commercial isobutane as a working fluid; both air-cooling and water-cooling were considered. Advanced binary concepts included cycles using synchronous turbine-generators, cycles with metastable expansion, and cycles utilizing mixtures as working fluids. Dual flash steam plants were used as the model for the commercial flash cycle. The following advanced flash concepts were examined: dual flash with rotary separator turbine, dual flash with steam reheater, dual flash with hot water turbine, and subatmospheric flash. Both dual flash and binary cycles were combined with other cycles to develop a number of hybrid cycles: dual <b>flash</b> binary <b>bottoming</b> cycle, dual <b>flash</b> backpressure turbine binary cycle, dual flash gas turbine cycle, and binary gas turbine cycle. Results {{of this study indicate that}} dual flash type plants are preferred at resources with temperatures above 400 F. Closed loop (binary type) plants are preferred at resources with temperatures below 400 F. A rotary separator turbine upstream of a dual flash plant can be beneficial at Salton Sea, the hottest resource, or at high temperature resources where there is a significant variance in wellhead pressures from well to well. Full scale demonstration is required to verify cost and performance. Hot water turbines that recover energy from the spent brine in a dual flash cycle improve that cycle's brine efficiency. Prototype field tests of this technology have established its technical feasibility. If natural gas prices remain low, a combustion turbine/binary hybrid is an economic option for the lowest temperature sites. The use of mixed fluids appear to be an attractive low risk option. The synchronous turbine option as prepared by Barber-Nichols is attractive but requires a pilot test to prove cost and performance. Dual <b>flash</b> binary <b>bottoming</b> cycles appear promising provided that scaling of the brine/working fluid exchangers is controllable. Metastable expansion, reheater, Subatmospheric flash, dual flash backpressure turbine, and hot dry rock concepts do not seem to offer any cost advantage over the baseline technologies. If implemented, the next generation geothermal power plant concept may improve brine utilization but is unlikely to reduce the cost of power generation by much more than 10 %. Colder resources will benefit more from the development of a next generation geothermal power plant than will hotter resources. All values presented in this study for plant cost and for busbar cost of power are relative numbers intended to allow an objective and meaningful comparison of technologies. The goal of this study is to assess various technologies on an common basis and, secondarily, to give an approximate idea of the current costs of the technologies at actual resource sites. Absolute costs at a given site will be determined by the specifics of a given project...|$|R
