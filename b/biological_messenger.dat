Here we report that photolysis of a double-caged form of the second messenger inositol 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate (IP 3) triggers focal calcium release in Purkinje cell somata, dendrites, and spines as measured by two-photon microscopy. In calbindin knock-out Purkinje cells, peak calcium increased with flash energy with higher cooperativity for double-caged IP 3 than for conventional single-caged IP 3, consistent with a chemical two-photon effect. Spine photolysis of double-caged IP 3 led to local calcium release. Uncaging of glycerophosphoryl-myo-inositol 4, 5 -bisphosphate (gPIP 2), a poorlymetabolizable IP 3 analog, led to less well localized release. Thus, IP 3 breakdown is necessary for spine-specificity.

One relatively recent advance {{in this area is}} the discovery of circulating microparticles and their role in endothelial damage, platelet activation, hypercoagulability and regulation of inter-cellular interactions. Microparticles are small anucleoid phospholipid vesicles released from different cells, such as platelets, erythrocytes, leukocytes and endothelial cells. Microparticles carry surface proteins and include cytoplasmic material of the parental cells responsible for the exertion of microparticle-mediated biological effects. About 25 % of the procoagulant activity of stimulated platelet suspensions is associated with microparticles released upon platelet activation and their surface may be approximately 50 - 100 -fold more procoagulant than the surface of activated platelets per se.

40|$|Due to {{its high}} {{reactivity}} {{and its ability}} to diffuse and permeate the cell membrane, nitric oxide (NO) and its exchangeable redox-activated species are unique <b>biological</b> <b>messengers</b> in animals and in plants. Although an increasing number of reports indicate that NO is an essential molecule in several physiological processes, there is not a clear picture of its method of action. Studies on the transcriptional changes induced by NO permitted identification of genes involved in different functional processes such as signal transduction, defence and cell death, transport, basic metabolism, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and degradation. The co-expression of these genes {{can be explained by the}} co-operation of a set of transcription factors that bind a common region in the promoter of the regulated genes.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Selective {{inhibition}} of neuronal {{nitric oxide synthase}} (nNOS) is an important therapeutic approach to target neurodegenerative disorders. However, {{the majority of the}} nNOS inhibitors developed are arginine mimetics and, therefore, suffer from poor bioavailability. We designed a novel strategy to combine a more pharmacokinetically favorable 2 -imidazolylpyrimidine head with promising structural components from previous inhibitors. In conjunction with extensive structure−activity studies, several highly potent and selective inhibitors of nNOS were discovered. X-ray crystallographic analysis reveals that these type II inhibitors utilize the same hydrophobic pocket to gain strong inhibitory potency (13), as well as high isoform selectivity. Interestingly, select compounds from this series (9) showed good permeability and low efflux in a Caco- 2 assay, suggesting potential oral bioavailability, and exhibited minimal off-target binding to 50 central nervous system receptors.

40|$|Introduction It {{is usually}} {{assumed that the}} spatial {{structure}} play no or little <b>biological</b> role for <b>messengers</b> RNA (mRNA). mRNA are translated into proteins according to the genetic code, a process which involves the sequence but not the spatial structure. However, the ribosomal frameshifting mechanism used by some viruses provides a counter example: {{the combination of a}} pseudoknot and a slippery sequence results in shifting the reading frame by 1 [1]. Alternatively, the end of the transcription of a mRNA chain in procaryotes often requires the formation of a hairpin loop, surrounded by AT rich domains. This shows that the tertiary and possibly the secondary structure of a mRNA can manifest itself during either the transcription or the translation stage [2, 3]. We argue that it is important for a mRNA chain to avoid unfavorable structures, in order to be processed eciently and accurately.

40|$|International audienceIt was {{initially}} assumed that RNA biogenesis and processing were two independent processes with transcripts undergoing splicing only after being completely synthesized and {{released from the}} DNA template. However, transcription and splicing are tightly linked and increasing evidence shows that nascent transcripts can undergo splicing {{in the vicinity of}} chromatin while still attached to the RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) transcriptional machinery. These co-transcriptionally spliced RNA molecules are very labile due to dynamic processing and represent a minor subpopulation among total cellular RNA species. Thus, it is difficult to isolate these RNAs in order to study the dynamics and mechanisms of co-transcriptional RNA splicing. To overcome this problem, the RNA-chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, adapted from classical ChIP, allows to co-purify and isolate nascent RNAs after immunoprecipitation of RNAPII. Thanks to this technique, we have shown that co-transcriptional RNA splicing occurs with distinct efficiencies for different genes and different exons of a given transcript and can represent a rate-limiting step in the <b>biological</b> response of <b>messenger</b> RNA synthesis to extracellular stimuli and drug treatments...|$|R
40|$|Anterior {{pituitary}} hormone secretion is mainly regulated by hypothalamic releasing factors, which reach the pituitary via portal vessels.

The object {{of this study was}} to seek evidence for the synthesis and secretion of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) within the anterior pituitary and to ascertain its <b>biological</b> relevance. <b>Messenger</b> RNA from adult rat anterior pituitary fragments and cell cultures was reverse transcribed and subjected to PCR amplification using primers specific to the rat CRH gene. As in the hypothalamus, a single 232 -bp band was obtained. The correspondence of the amplified fragment to the sequence of the CRH gene was confirmed by Southern blotting and restriction enzyme digestion. Combined in situ reverse transcription-PCR amplification/immunocytochemistry demonstrated the presence of CRH mRNA in corticotropes. Medium from anterior pituitary primary cultures contained approximately 7 pg/microg protein of CRH immunoreactivity which presented the same chromatographic profile on HPLC as the mature CRH peptide. Incubation of anterior pituitary cells with an antibody directed against CRH markedly reduced basal ACTH secretion compared with serum-treated control wells (0. 89 +/- 0. 11 vs. 1. 74 +/- 0. 14 ng/ 200, 000 cells in control wells after 1 h, P < 0. 05; 1. 17 +/- 0. 10 vs. 2. 16 +/- 0. 39 ng/ 200, 000 cells after 2 h, P < 0. 05; 1. 45 +/- 0. 12 vs. 3. 12 +/- 0. 61 ng/ 200, 000 cells after 3 h, P < 0. 05). Further, the ACTH response to potassium and to forskolin was markedly blunted by the CRH antiserum as well as by the CRH antagonist, alpha-helical CRH(9 - 41). In conclusion, this study demonstrates the presence of CRH mRNA in normal rat corticotropes and the secretion of the mature peptide by the anterior pituitary, pointing to the production of CRH at the site of its target cells. In addition, intrapituitary CRH contributes in a paracrine/autocrine fashion to ACTH secretion...|$|R

Ned- 19 itself inhibits both NAADP-mediated Ca 2 + release and NAADP binding. A fluorometry bioassay {{was used to assess}} NAADP-mediated Ca 2 + release, whereas a radioreceptor assay was used to assess binding to the NAADP receptor (only at the high-affinity site).

Conversely, Ned- 19. 4 (a methyl ester of Ned- 19) inhibits NAADP-mediated Ca 2 + release but cannot inhibit NAADP binding. Furthermore, Ned- 20 prevents the self-desensitization response characteristic of NAADP in sea urchin eggs, confirming that this response is mediated by a high-affinity allosteric site to which NAADP binds in the radioreceptor assay.

We have used x-ray diffraction and osmotic stress of the HII phase to measure structural dimensions, spontaneous curvature, and bending moduli of dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE) monolayers doped with increasing amounts of dioleoylglycerol (DOG). The diameter of the HII phase cylinders equilibrated in excess water decreases significantly with increasing DOG content. Remarkably, however, all structural dimensions at any specific water/lipid ratio that is less than full hydration are insensitive to DOG. By plotting structural parameters of the HII phase with changing water content in a newly defined coordinate system, we show that the elastic deformation of the lipid monolayers {{can be described as}} bending around a pivotal plane of constant area. This dividing surface includes 30 % of the lipid volume independent of the DOG content (polar heads and a small fraction of hydrocarbon chains). As the mole fraction of DOG increases to 0. 3, the radius of spontaneous curvature defined for the pivotal surface decreases from 29 A to 19 A, and the bending modulus increases from approximately 11 to 14 (+/- 0. 5) kT. We derive the conversion factors and estimate the spontaneous curvatures and bending moduli for the neutral surface which, unlike the pivotal plane parameters, are intrinsic properties that apply to other deformations and geometries.

Several studies have reported that there were different patterns of those parameters in different airway diseases and/or in different severities of the same disease, mostly in asthma.

40|$|Human basic {{fibroblast}} {{growth factor}} (FGF- 2) occurs in four isoforms: a {{low molecular weight}} (LMW FGF- 2, 18 kDa) and three high molecular weight (HMW FGF- 2, 22, 22. 5, and 24 kDa) forms. LMW FGF- 2 is primarily cytoplasmic and functions in an autocrine manner, whereas HMW FGF- 2 s are nuclear and exert activities through an intracrine, perhaps nuclear, pathway. Selective overexpression of HMW FGF- 2 forms in fibroblasts promotes growth in low serum, whereas overexpression of LMW FGF- 2 does not. The HMW FGF- 2 forms have two functional domains: an amino-terminal extension and a common 18 -kDa amino acid sequence. To investigate the role of these regions in the intracrine signaling of HMW FGF- 2, we produced stable transfectants of NIH 3 T 3 fibroblasts overexpressing either individual HMW FGF- 2 forms or artificially nuclear-targeted LMW FGF- 2. All of these forms of FGF- 2 localize to the nucleus/nucleolus and induce growth in low serum. The nuclear forms of FGF- 2 trigger a mitogenic stimulus under serum starvation conditions and do not specifically protect the cells from apoptosis. These data indicate the existence of a specific role for nuclear FGF- 2 and suggest that LMW FGF- 2 represents the <b>biological</b> <b>messenger</b> in both the autocrine/paracrine and intracrine FGF- 2 pathways...|$|E
40|$|In the {{vascular}} system, distinct isoforms of {{nitric oxide}} synthase (NOS) generate nitric oxide (NO), which acts as a <b>biological</b> <b>messenger.</b> Its {{role in the development}} of transplant arteriosclerosis (TA) is still unclear. To investigate whether NO is involved in TA, we studied the expression of NOS isoforms, inducible NOS (iNOS) and endothelial NOS (eNOS), by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization during the first two post-transplantation months and their relation with cold ischemia (1 to 24 hours) and reperfusion injury using an aortic transplantation model in the rat. We found an increased iNOS expression in the intima and adventitia and a decreased expression in the media, whereas eNOS expression was not significantly altered during the development of TA. Co-localization studies suggested that iNOS-positive cells were vascular smooth muscle cells, monocyte-derived macrophages, and endothelial cells. Prolonged ischemic storage time resulted in an increase in eNOS expression in the neointima. In situ hybridization showed iNOS mRNA expression by vascular cells in the neointima and media. NO produced by iNOS and eNOS may be involved, at least in part, in the pathogenesis of TA in aortic grafts. Additional studies are needed to confirm the modulatory mechanism of NO during the development of TA...|$|E
