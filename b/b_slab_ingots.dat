40|$|Shrinkage {{porosity}} defect {{is often}} found in an air cooled jumbo steel ingot, which will influence {{the quality of the}} final rolled plates. In practical production, some rolled plates are frequently rejected due to the serious shrinkage porosity of the ingot. To improve the quality of the ingot, a new cooling method, gradient cooling process (in which {{the upper part of the}} ingot is air cooled and the lower part is spray cooled) was put forward in this study. The solidification behaviors for a 60 t jumbo <b>slab</b> <b>ingot</b> under gradient cooling condition were simulated using the ProCast software, and the results were compared with those of an ingot by air cooling condition. The solidifying tendency, temperature field and distribution of shrinkage porosities in the ingot under different cooling conditions were analyzed. Simulation results show that under gradient cooling condition the solidification of the <b>slab</b> <b>ingot</b> progresses in an upward manner along the vertical z axis and in a centripetal manner along the horizontal x and y axes. Gradient cooling can efficiently reduce shrinkage porosity of the jumbo <b>slab</b> <b>ingot</b> by optimizing the solidification sequence, and making the position of shrinkage porosity move from near the middle height of the ingot (under air cooling condition) towards the head of the ingot; and the secondary shrinkage is eliminated. In addition, the solidification time of the ingot under gradient cooling is 7. 3 h in this simulation, which is 2. 7 h faster than that under air cooling. A 60 t jumbo <b>slab</b> <b>ingot</b> was successfully produced under gradient cooling condition. The ingot was rolled to a plate with a thickness of 100 mm and length of 18, 000 mm, and ultrasonic flaw detection was performed. Some porosity was found along the axis of the plate at 4, 900 - 6, 000 mm from the head of the plate, indicating that the position of the defect is moved towards the head of the ingot. This distribution trend of the defect is consistent with the simulated result...|$|R

40|$|The {{increased}} demand for aluminum as a primary structural metal stems from a quest in automotive, aerospace, and marine industries to be more energy efficient and sustainable. This unprecedented demand drives aluminum casting methods towards increased productivity looking to, cast larger ingots faster. The unfortunate consequence {{of this approach is}} an enhanced variation of metallurgical properties over the cross section of <b>slab</b> <b>ingots.</b> Rolling <b>slab</b> <b>ingots</b> of AlCu 4. 5 using a typical Direct-Chill casting technique have been cast and sectioned for analysis. This alloy allowed us to compare our results with the available literature and to elucidate the marked differences in spatial variation of microstructure and composition found in radial and lateral symmetry castings. In an attempt to couple conventional theory with our results, sump and temperature profiles were measured in-situ and modeled using a commercial finite element analysis software package. The combination of experimental and modeling results indicate that the variations in the cooling parameters through the cross section are largely responsible for the spatial variances in metallurgical properties, pointing to a possible refinement of DC casting parameters. by Samuel R.

The sides of the ingot are being cooled and the upper boundary of the ingot is in contact with a pool of molten metal. The solidification interface shape was determined from the analysis of the heat flow, utilizing the condition that the solidification interface is at constant temperature and must be normal to the lines of heat flow carrying away latent heat of fusion from the interface. The analysis includes the effect of interface curvature which, for a constant rate of withdrawing the cast ingot from the mold, causes the solidification to be nonuniform along the interface.

40|$|Cyprus was {{undoubtedly}} the main area of {{production of the}} copper oxhide ingots found in different Mediterranean countries. Recent research at Politiko Phorades and Maroni shows that the casting of the oxhide ingots required a complex process which involved both inland mining and coastal sites. Egyptian and Near Eastern written sources suggest that not only oxhide ingots but possibly other raw copper (ore, matte or other semi-processed material) were exported from Alashiya/Cyprus. However, lead isotope analysis of some ingots from Late Minoan I contexts and archaeological evidence from Ras Ibn Hani, in the Ugaritic kingdom, and Timna, in the political domain of Egypt, show that the oxhide ingots were not cast only in Cyprus, from at least {{the beginning of the}} Late Bronze Age to the last centuries of the second millennium BC. Leaving aside the copper oxhide ingots depicted in the well-known scenes of tribute of the Theban tombs, special attention is here paid to Egyptian foundry scenes, especially that depicted in Hepu tomb. A group of oxhide ingots is here displayed above the craftsmen who are represented in act of fanning a fire. A review of Egyptian scenes of various workshops shows that from the Old Kingdom the products of the working activities are generally displayed {{in the same way as}} in the Hepu tomb. It is therefore very likely that the aim of this scene is to epitomize the casting of the copper oxhide ingots displayed above. If this interpretation is right, the production of copper oxhide ingots should be admitted also in Egypt during the 15 th- 14 th centuries BC, although on a far smaller scale than in Cyprus.

TiO 2 (B) was included due to experimental results where it appears as a metastable phase during thermal annealing of low content sodium layered titanate nanostructures obtained via hydrothermal synthesis. Band gaps and surface energies are discussed confronting results obtained by Plane Waves (PW) and Localized Basis Set methods (LCNAO), observing an excellent agreement between both methodologies when considering floating basis to calculate surfaces energies using LCAO. The computed formation energy for the TiO 2 (<b>B)</b> (001) <b>slab,</b> as has been previously reported by Vittadini A. et al., J. Phys. Chem. C 2009, 113 (44), 18973 - 18977, is {{in the order of}} the one calculated for anatasa (101) which represents one of the most stable TiO 2 surfaces. The adsorption of formic acid on (001) and (100) - less stable - TiO 2 (B) dry facets was investigated as the first step for further evaluation of TiO 2 (B) nanostructures for dye sensitized solar cells (DSSC) applications. The results show that the bidentate dissociated configuration is the most stable for both surfaces being the computed adsorption energy 0. 76 eV and 1. 35 eV for (001) and (100) respectively.

These elevated B isotope signatures result from chemical exchange with B-rich pore fluids that are upwelling through the seamount. If the trends of decreasing delta 11 <b>B</b> with <b>slab</b> depth shown by cross-arc magmatic suites in the Izu and Kurile arcs {{of the western}} Pacific are extended to shallow depths (~ 25 km), they intersect the inferred delta 11 B of the slab-derived fluids (+ 13 x) at Conical Seamount. Simple mixtures of a B-rich fluid with a high delta 11 B and B-poor mantle with a low delta 11 B are insufficient to explain the combined forearc and arc data sets. The B isotope systematics of subduction-related rocks thus indicate that the fluids evolved from downgoing slabs are more enriched in 11 <b>B</b> than the <b>slab</b> materials from which they originate. Progressively lower delta 11 B in arc lavas erupted above deep slabs reflects both the progressive depletion of 11 <b>B</b> from the <b>slab</b> and progressively greater inputs of mantle-derived B.

Nevertheless, a thorough examination of the literature revealed a dearth of research into the influence of buildability factors on labour productivity of in situ reinforced concrete construction, especially at the formwork trade level. Although edge formwork is an important labour intensive activity, most often, its labour cost is either crudely estimated or lumped within the formwork cost of other activities. Therefore, the objective of this research is to investigate and quantify the effects and relative influence of the fol-lowing buildability factors on its labour productivity: (a) depth of <b>slab</b> being edge-formed; (<b>b)</b> <b>slab</b> geometric factor; and (c) type of formwork material used.

Beyond that range, further increasing Mg to 0. 60 is favorable for the formation of PuNi 3 -type phase due to the rising ratio of [A 2 B 4] to [AB 5] slabs in regard to the demand of La and Ni atoms for Mg to assemble [A 2 <b>B</b> 4] <b>slabs.</b> Conversely, the surplus of La and Ni atoms for Mg to assemble [A 2 <b>B</b> 4] <b>slabs</b> lowers the ratio of [A 2 B 4] to [AB 5] slabs, which helps the formation of CaCu 5 -type phase as Mg decreases to 0. 40.

This process has many advantages over traditional Direct Chill (DC) casting where metal is cast into large <b>slabs</b> or <b>ingots</b> and subsequently hot and cold rolled into strips. While the DC casting involves large capital investment and energy consumption, TRC produces strip with thickness {{in the range of}} 10 mm to 2. 5 mm in one operation without hot rolling, with less cost, energy usage and equipment requirements. In TRC AA 3105, high solidification and post-solidification cooling rates lead to high manganese supersaturation throughout the as-cast strip and very fine constituent particles near strip surface. After 90 % cold rolling, the TRC material shows sluggish recrystallization kinetics and a very coarse grain structure, due to concurrent forming dispersoids and/or fine constituent particles. These particles interfere with the nucleation process by preventing migration of the boundaries associated with potential nuclei, resulting in fewer recrystallization nuclei and slower nucleation rate. In addition, the fine particles can impede grain growth by exerting a pinning pressure on moving boundaries. The current study investigated the microstructure evolution in TRC AA 3105 during different thermo-mechanical treatments. A systematic study of the effects of different homogenization treatments on second phase particles was carried out. The heating rate effect on recrystallization was studies using an infrared heating furnace. The effect of second phase particles on recrystallization behavior was summarized and experimental results were presented.

Electron microprobe analysis gives the empirical formula [K 1. 43 (NH 4) 0. 42 Na 0. 02 Tl 0. 01]Σ= 1. 88 (As 5. 82 Sb 2. 18) Σ= 8. 00 S 13. 22 ⋅ 1. 2 H 2 O, close to stoichiometric [K 1. 5 (NH 4) 0. 5]Σ= 2 (As 6 Sb 2) Σ= 8 S 13 ⋅H 2 O; the calculated density is 3. 276 g/cm 3. Micro-Raman spectroscopy confirmed the presence of water and ammonium cation. Ambrinoite is triclinic, space group P 1, with a = 9. 704 (1), b = 11. 579 (1), c = 12. 102 (2) Å, α = 112. 82 (1), β = 103. 44 (1), γ = 90. 49 (1) °, V = 1211. 6 (3) Å 3, Z = 2. The strongest X-ray powder diffraction lines [d in Å (I) (hkl) ] are: 10. 78 (100) (001), 5. 79 (55) (021), 4. 23 (35) (102), 5. 31 (34) (102), 5. 39 (32) (002). Its crystal structure has been solved by X-ray single-crystal diffraction {{on the basis of}} 2667 unique reflections, with a final R = 0. 035. It is formed by two kinds of modules: slabs (110) PbS of modified PbS archetype (type A slabs) and openwork slabs with channels accomodating (K,NH 4) + cations and H 2 O molecules (type <b>B</b> <b>slabs).</b> Its structure can be described as an order-disorder (OD) structure, built up by two different kinds of layers. Taking into account only the short (As,Sb) -S bonds, (As,Sb) S 3 triangular pyramids form double chains similar to those described in other natural and synthetic compounds, among which its homeotype gillulyite, as well as gerstleyite. Ambrinoite belongs to the hutchinsonite merotypic family. It is probably the product of late-stage hydrothermal fluid circulation. The name of this new mineral species (IMA 2009 - 071) honors Pierluigi Ambrino (b. 1947), the mineral collector who kindly provided us with the studied specimens...|$|R
5000|$|Kirktonecta {{is known}} from the holotype {{specimen}} UMZC 2002, a and b, an almost complete skeleton including the skull, and preserved evidence for soft tissues, in part (slab a) and counterpart (<b>slab</b> <b>b).</b> The holotype was collected in the East Kirkton Quarry, near Bathgate of West Lothian, from [...] "Bed 82" [...] East Kirkton Limestone of the Bathgate Hills Volcanic Formation, dating to the Brigantian substage, of the late Viséan stage, of the Dinantian series (Early Carboniferous), about 333-328.3 million years ago. It represents the first microsaur to be discovered in the United Kingdom and the earliest occurrence of a microsaur in the fossil record. The next oldest being Utaherpeton and an unnamed taxon from the Chesterian of Goreville, Illinois.|$|R

An example of its use: builder A says [...] "d — slab — there" [...] and points, and builder <b>B</b> counts four <b>slabs,</b> [...] "a, <b>b,</b> c, d..." [...] and moves them to the place pointed to by A. The builder's language is an activity into which is woven something we would recognize as language, but in a simpler form. This language-game resembles the simple forms of language taught to children, and Wittgenstein asks that we conceive of it as [...] "a complete primitive language" [...] for a tribe of builders.|$|R
40|$|The {{temperature}} {{dependence of the}} longitudinal magnetization {{as well as the}} longitudinal susceptibility of a ferroelectric superlattice described by a transverse spin- 1 / 2 Ising model are studied using the effective field theory with a probability distribution technique that accounts for the self-spin correlations. When the slab thicknesses are larger, the {{temperature dependence}} of the magnetization shows a steplike structure. The susceptibility becomes infinite at the critical temperature T-c and shows a finite peak corresponding to the rapid decrease in the magnetization near the bulk critical temperature of <b>slab</b> <b>B.</b> The height of the finite peak decreases with the decrease in the slab thicknesses. When they become so thin that the magnetization profiles are predominantly controlled by the interface, the finite peak in the susceptibility as well as the steps in magnetization disappear.
