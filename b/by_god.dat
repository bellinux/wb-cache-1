5|$|Although {{opinions}} {{differ on}} whether the Bala Kanda narrative of Ahalya refers to the divinity of Rama, later sources assert Rama's divine status, portraying Ahalya as a condemned woman rescued <b>by</b> <b>God.</b> The Bhakti-era poets use the episode as an archetypal example to demonstrate God's saving grace. The main theme of such narratives is her deliverance by Rama, which is seen as proof of his compassion.|$|E
5|$|Cantor's {{theory of}} transfinite numbers was {{originally}} regarded as so counter-intuitive – even shocking – that it encountered resistance from mathematical contemporaries such as Leopold Kronecker and Henri Poincaré and later from Hermann Weyl and L. E. J. Brouwer, while Ludwig Wittgenstein raised philosophical objections. Cantor, a devout Lutheran, believed the theory had been communicated to him <b>by</b> <b>God.</b> Some Christian theologians (particularly neo-Scholastics) saw Cantor's {{work as a}} challenge to the uniqueness of the absolute infinity in the nature of God – on one occasion equating the theory of transfinite numbers with pantheism – a proposition that Cantor vigorously rejected.|$|E
5|$|Crowning ceremonies {{arose from}} a worldview in which monarchs {{were seen as}} ordained <b>by</b> <b>God</b> to serve not merely as {{political}} or military leaders, nor as figureheads, but rather to occupy a vital spiritual place in their dominions as well. Coronations were created to reflect and enable these alleged connections; however, the belief systems {{that gave birth to}} them have been radically altered in recent centuries by secularism, egalitarianism and the rise of constitutionalism and democracy. During the Protestant Reformation, the idea of divinely ordained monarchs began to be challenged.|$|E

5|$|Divine command theory (also {{known as}} {{theological}} voluntarism) is a meta-ethical theory which proposes that an action's status as morally good {{is equivalent to}} whether it is commanded <b>by</b> <b>God.</b> The theory asserts that what is moral is determined by what God commands, and that {{for a person to}} be moral is to follow his commands. Followers of both monotheistic and polytheistic religions in ancient and modern times have often accepted the importance of God's commands in establishing morality.|$|E
5|$|Father McCue (Arnie Walters) {{contacts}} Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{and asks}} for her help in the case. Scully visits the Kernofs, and learns that Dara was adopted six years earlier. Due to her severe spinal deformities, there is no explanation as to how Dara {{walked out of the}} house. Lance is convinced that it was the Devil that stood over her in the street. Scully examines Dara's body with a pathologist Vicki Belon (Lorraine Landry), who notes her surgically removed extra fingers. Belon reluctantly proposes that the girl was struck down <b>by</b> <b>God,</b> as if she was a mistake.|$|E
5|$|In April 1858, Tubman was {{introduced}} to the abolitionist John Brown, an insurgent who advocated the use of violence to destroy slavery in the United States. Although she never advocated violence against whites, she agreed with his course of direct action and supported his goals. Like Tubman, he spoke of being called <b>by</b> <b>God,</b> and trusted the divine to protect him from the wrath of slaveholders. She, meanwhile, claimed to have had a prophetic vision of meeting Brown before their encounter.|$|E

5|$|In the Epistle to the Hebrews, Abraham's {{willingness}} to follow God's command to sacrifice Isaac {{is used as}} an example of faith as is Isaac's action in blessing Jacob and Esau with reference to the future promised <b>by</b> <b>God</b> to Abraham In verse 19, the author views the release of Isaac from sacrifice as analogous to the resurrection of Jesus, the idea of the sacrifice of Isaac being a prefigure of the sacrifice of Jesus on the cross.|$|E
5|$|Jewish {{religion}} was unusual in that Jews acknowledged only one God, they considered themselves chosen by him, {{and they wanted}} Gentiles to accept their God as the only God. Jews based their faith and religious practice on the Torah, five books {{said to have been}} given <b>by</b> <b>God</b> to Moses. The three prominent religious parties were the Pharisees, the Essenes, and the Sadducees. Together these parties represented {{only a small fraction of}} the population. Most Jews looked forward to a time that God would deliver them from their pagan rulers, possibly through war against the Romans.|$|E
5|$|Man's {{inability}} to live God's words makes the Avatar's teaching a mockery. Instead of practicing the compassion he taught, man has waged wars in his name. Instead of living the humility, purity, and truth of his words, man {{has given way}} to hatred, greed, and violence. Because man has been deaf to the principles and precepts laid down <b>by</b> <b>God</b> in the past, in this present Avataric form, I observe silence.|$|E

5|$|Plymouth Colony did {{not have}} a royal charter authorizing it to form a government, yet some means of {{governance}} was needed. The Mayflower Compact was the colony's first governing document, signed by the 41 able-bodied Separatists aboard the Mayflower upon their arrival in Provincetown Harbor on November 21, 1620. Formal laws were not codified until 1636. The colony's laws were based on a hybrid of English common law and religious law as laid out in the Bible. The colonial authorities were deeply influenced by Calvinist theology, and were convinced that democracy was the form of government mandated <b>by</b> <b>God.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Catholic Church teaches that, {{immediately}} after death, {{the soul of}} each person will receive a particular judgement from God, based on their sins {{and their relationship to}} Christ. This teaching also attests to another day when Christ will sit in universal judgement of all mankind. This final judgement, according to the church's teaching, will bring an end to human history and mark the beginning of both a new and better heaven and earth ruled <b>by</b> <b>God</b> in righteousness.|$|E
5|$|The film {{is based}} on an American sailor who comes to the Yamaki family after his ship wrecks in the ocean.

Writer and producer Thomas H. Ince got the idea for the film from the volcanic eruption on the island of Sakura-Jima in 1914. Hayakawa was paid $500 a week, the highest paid of all oriental stars at the time.|$|E
