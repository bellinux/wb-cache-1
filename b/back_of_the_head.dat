5|$|Of the conspirators, only Booth was {{completely}} successful {{in carrying out}} {{his part of the}} plot. He shot Lincoln once in the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>head,</b> and the President died the next morning. Seward was severely wounded but recovered, and Vice President Johnson was never attacked at all.|$|E
5|$|In {{his ship}} still docked in the harbor, Doran's son Trystane is {{painting}} stones for Myrcella's funeral. Obara and Nymeria Sand board his ship and enter his cabin, stating their intent to kill him. Despite proclaiming {{that he does}} not want to fight his family, he attempts to defend himself from Nymeria but is stabbed through the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> by Obara, killing him instantly.|$|E
5|$|Magpies {{prefer to}} swoop {{at the back}} of the head; therefore, keeping the magpie in sight at all times can {{discourage}} the bird. A basic disguise such as sunglasses worn on the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> may fool the magpie as to where a person is looking. Eyes painted on hats or helmets will deter attacks on pedestrians but not cyclists.|$|E
50|$|The station's art {{was created}} by artist Christofer C. Dierdorff. Entitled <b>The</b> Intimacy <b>of</b> Place, <b>the</b> {{installation}} uses photographs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fronts and <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> local people, creating intimate portraits that show each individual in <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> her/his role in the community.|$|R
50|$|A mat slam is {{any move}} {{in which the}} wrestler forces <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> opponent's <b>head</b> into <b>the</b> mat which does not involve a {{headlock}} or facelock. If these are used then the move is considered a type <b>of</b> DDT (if <b>the</b> wrestler falls backwards) or bulldog. Some neckbreakers also slam <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> opponent's <b>head</b> into <b>the</b> mat, but the attacker is back-to-back with the attack's receiver. A standard mat slam involves the wrestler grabbing hold <b>of</b> <b>the</b> opponent by his/her head or hair and pulling <b>back,</b> forcing <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> opponent's <b>head</b> into <b>the</b> mat.|$|R

5|$|Sabina {{ran out of}} {{the house}} with a hammer, {{periodically}} hitting herself over the head with it. A passing motorist, Joshua Grattage, saw this extraordinary behaviour and decided to tackle her in an attempt {{to take control of the}} hammer. While wrestling with Grattage, Sabina took a roof tile out of her pocket and struck him on the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> with it, stunning him temporarily.|$|E
5|$|The Sunda slow loris has dark rings {{around its}} large eyes, a white nose with a whitish strip that {{extends to the}} {{forehead}} and a dark stripe that stretches from the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> along the spine. Its soft, thick, woolly fur ranges from light brown to deep reddish brown, with a lighter underside. The species is distinct from the Bengal slow loris due to the dark inverse teardrop markings around the eyes which meet the dark dorsal stripe on the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>head.</b> It tends to {{have a much more}} distinct white stripe between the eyes, more distinct dark coloring around the eyes, and a browner coat than the Bengal slow loris which is larger, grayer, and shows less contrast. The Sunda slow loris has less white facial coloring than the much smaller pygmy slow loris. Local color variations are known to occur.|$|E
5|$|The {{boys were}} found in their beds in their own room (formerly Sheila's room). They {{appeared}} to have been shot while in bed. The court heard that Daniel had been shot five times in the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>head,</b> four times with the gun held within one foot of his head, and once from over two feet away. Nicholas had been shot three times, all contact or close-proximity shots.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} contest pitted Bobby Roode, who {{was accompanied}} by Coach D'Amore, against Ron Killings. The duration of the match was 9 minutes and 53 seconds. Konnan interfered in the bout distracting Killings, which allowed Roode to sneak up behind Killings and {{hit him in the}} <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> with Roode's signature Northern Lariat maneuver.|$|E
5|$|The {{front of}} the head of the female in {{breeding}} plumage is yellow, gradually changing to olive green at the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>head,</b> except for the broad yellow rear brow, while the area between the eye and the bill is dark greenish grey, and the area around the ear is green. The head is surrounded by a broad yellow collar that includes the chin. The remainder of the female breeding plumage is identical to the male's.|$|E
5|$|The next {{match was}} between Bad News Brown and Ken Patera. Before the bell rang, however, Brown {{attacked}} Patera, who retaliated by performing a clothesline from the corner. Patera then slipped {{both of his}} arms underneath Brown's armpits and locked {{his hands behind his}} neck, using a submission move known as a full nelson. At the end of the match, Brown defeated Patera by striking him in the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> with his finishing move, the Ghetto Blaster.|$|E

5|$|After being marched {{two miles}} north-west {{of the city}} centre, the victims {{encountered}} a barbed wire barrier and numerous Ukrainian police and German troops. Thirty or forty people at a time were told to leave their possessions and were escorted through a narrow passageway lined with soldiers brandishing clubs. Anyone who tried to escape was beaten. Soon the victims reached an open area, where {{they were forced to}} strip, and then were herded down into the ravine. People were forced to lie down in rows on top of the bodies of other victims, and they were shot in the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> or the neck by members of the execution squads.|$|E
5|$|During 2002, The Hurricane won the WWF Hardcore Championship at WrestleMania X8, but Molly betrayed him, {{hitting him}} in the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> with a frying pan, and {{defeating}} him for the championship. Helms was later drafted to the SmackDown! brand following the brand extension, and he won the Cruiserweight Championship from Tajiri and Billy Kidman in a triple threat match. He lost it to Jamie Noble at King of the Ring. Later in 2002, he was traded to Raw, won the World Tag Team Championship with Kane, and held them for around a month in an alliance known as Hurri-Kane.|$|E
5|$|Head pain {{occurs in}} 50–75% {{of all cases}} of {{vertebral}} artery dissection. It tends to be located at the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>head,</b> either on the affected side or in the middle, and develops gradually. It is either dull or pressure-like in character or throbbing. About half of those with VAD consider the headache distinct, while the remainder have had a similar headache before. It is suspected that VAD with headache as the only symptom is fairly common; 8% of all cases of vertebral and carotid dissection are diagnosed {{on the basis of}} pain alone.|$|E

5|$|More recently, {{historians have}} come to believe that Khánh ordered that Nhung be {{liquidated}} and that the earlier reports were deliberately false material disseminated by Khánh through his subordinates. According to this now-established account, one of Khánh's men took Nhung to the garden of a Saigon villa and forced him to kneel, before executing him with a single gunshot to the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>head.</b> Nhung's death led to protests among the Saigon public, who took the killing to be a signal that the remaining members of Diệm's regime would be reinstated to positions of authority.|$|E
5|$|The TNA X Division Championship was defended in a bout {{that lasted}} 15 minutes and 28 seconds between then-champion Christopher Daniels and Elix Skipper. During the encounter, Daniels {{performed}} his signature backflip, the Best Moonsault Ever, on Skipper, which {{earned him a}} near-fall. Skipper later jumped {{off the top of}} the cage and bashed Daniels in the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> with his forearm. This also gained Skipper a near-fall. Daniels went on to perform his signature maneuver, the Angel Wings, on Skipper, which forced him face-first into the mat and allowed him to gain the pinfall and to retain the title.|$|E
5|$|The brawl {{began with}} 45.9seconds {{remaining}} in the game, when Indiana led 97–82. The Pistons' Ben Wallace was fouled from behind by the Pacers' Ron Artest (now known as Metta World Peace), who slapped him across the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> during a layup attempt. Wallace later said that Artest had warned him he would be hit. Wallace responded by shoving Artest {{in the face with}} both hands, causing players from both teams to quickly get in between them as they attempted to keep Wallace and Artest separated.|$|E

5|$|The first {{televised}} {{match was}} between Tatanka and Bam Bam Bigelow. Bigelow tried to attack Tatanka before the bell, but Tatanka moved. The two fought back and forth, and Bigelow gained momentum after Tatanka missed a crossbody {{from the top}} turnbuckle. Bigelow used his weight to keep the advantage, sitting on Tatanka and later using a bear hug to wear him down. After the two hit each other with simultaneous crossbodies, Tatanka began a war dance. Bigelow kicked Tatanka in the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> to regain the advantage but missed a moonsault attempt from the top rope, allowing Tatanka to perform a crossbody from the corner and get the victory.|$|E
5|$|The {{masked shrike}} feeds mainly on large insects, {{although}} other arthropods and small vertebrates are also caught. Shrikes fatten up before migration, {{but to a}} lesser extent than other passerines because they can feed on the way, sometimes taking other tired migrants. Despite its relatively small size, the masked shrike has been recorded as killing species such as lesser whitethroat and little swift. Vertebrates are killed by bill blows to the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>head,</b> and the tomial teeth are then used to separate the neck bones.|$|E
5|$|The {{nestling}} is born nearly featherless {{except for}} tiny primary quills {{and a fine}} down along its spine, humerus, forearm, and femur. Its skin is dark pink but displays variable black patches on its upperside. The gape is yellow. As the nestling develops, its plumage begins to resemble that of the adult, though it has white flecks on its wing coverts and the featherless skin on the head is black or dark brown, not powder blue, on the forecrown and dark reddish brown, not carmine, on the hindcrown. After fledging, the immature closely resembles the adult except for the bare patch on the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> being golden yellow instead of carmine and the tail being only a third {{as long as that}} of an adult.|$|E
