25|$|ABS {{generally}} offers improved vehicle {{control and}} decreases stopping distances on dry and slippery surfaces; however, on loose gravel or snow-covered surfaces, ABS can significantly increase <b>braking</b> <b>distance,</b> although still improving vehicle steering control.|$|E
25|$|Modern trains have a {{much larger}} mass {{relative}} to their braking capability, and thus a far longer <b>braking</b> <b>distance</b> than road vehicles. With rare exceptions, trains do not stop at level crossings and rely on vehicles and pedestrians to clear the tracks in advance.|$|E
25|$|Warning {{indicators}} are provided whenever {{there is a}} reduction in permissible speed of a third or more, and are placed at the service <b>braking</b> <b>distance</b> {{from the start of}} the lower speed. There is also an AWS magnet placed before the indicator to give an audible warning to the train driver. Colloquially known as 'Morpeth boards', after the 1969 derailment at Morpeth, Northumberland that led to their introduction.|$|E

5000|$|Shorter <b>braking</b> <b>distances,</b> {{allowing}} {{trains to}} be signalled closer together.|$|R
25|$|Multiple aspect signals, by {{providing}} several intermediate speed stages between 'clear' and 'on', allow high-speed trains {{sufficient time to}} brake safely if required. This becomes very important as train speeds rise. Without multiple-aspect signals, the stop signals must be placed far apart to allow sufficient <b>braking</b> <b>distance</b> and this reduces track utilisation. At the same time, slower trains can also be run closer together on track with multiple aspect signals.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{signalling}} {{system is a}} fixed-block cab {{signalling system}} called HKT which transmits data to the trains through low-bandwidth audio frequency induction loops between the rails. Different frequency combinations encode different target speeds; when a train enters a block with a lower target speed than its current speed it will initiate service braking until the two match. This allows blocks to be much shorter than the full-speed <b>braking</b> <b>distance,</b> but as the braking profile is encoded in the transmitted target speed it only works where all trains have similar braking characteristics.|$|E
25|$|The {{acceleration}} {{distance of a}} trainset with 14 cars to 100km/h − starting at standstill, on level terrain − is given as 900m (66 seconds), to 200km/h on 6,850m (200s) and to 250km/h on 18,350m (380s). <b>Braking</b> <b>distance</b> of a service stop under LZB control (0,5m/s²) from 250km/h is given as 4820m that of a fast braking (1,05m/s²) at 2300m. For braking all cars have disc brakes. Additionally, the power heads use regenerative brakes, the intermediate cars have electromagnetic track brakes. The power cars have spring-loaded parking brakes; intermediate cars use screw brakes for the same purpose. The bogies facilitate replacing the track brakes with eddy current brakes.|$|E
50|$|Actual <b>braking</b> <b>distances</b> are {{affected}} by the vehicle type and condition, the incline of the road, the available traction, and numerous other factors.|$|R
25|$|Four-aspect {{signalling}} {{is mostly}} used either on busy routes to allow shorter headways, or fast routes to provide longer <b>braking</b> <b>distances.</b> Where {{neither of these}} conditions apply, two- or three-aspect signalling is generally used instead.|$|R
5000|$|Four wheel {{anti-lock}} brakes were first featured {{as an option}} on the 1978 W116 S-Class. This system prevents the wheels from locking while braking. The system improves steering control during hard braking situations, and to shorten <b>brake</b> <b>distances.</b>|$|R

500|$|On 18 August 1937, the RLM {{decided to}} {{introduce}} the Ju 87 Tr(C). The Ju 87 C {{was intended to be}} a dive and torpedo bomber for the Kriegsmarine. The type was ordered into prototype production and available for testing in January 1938. Testing was given just two months and was to begin in February and end in April 1938. The prototype V10 was to be a fixed wing test aircraft, while the following V11 would be modified with folding wings. The prototypes were Ju 87 B-0 airframes powered by Jumo 211 A engines. Owing to delays, the V10 was not completed until March 1938. It first flew on 17 March and was designated Ju 87 C-1. On 12 May, the V11 also flew for the first time. By 15 December 1939, 915 arrested landings on dry land had been made. It was found that the arresting gear winch was too weak and had to be replaced.

500|$|In February 2007, a Brazilian judge briefly banned flights using Fokker 100, Boeing 737-700 and Boeing 737-800 {{aircraft}} {{in and out}} of the airport. The Airbus A320 was not among the aircraft banned, due to its manufacturer-stated <b>braking</b> <b>distance</b> being shorter than those of the banned aircraft. Pilots had complained that water had been accumulating on the runway, reducing aircraft braking performance and occasionally causing planes to hydroplane. The judge claimed the runway needed to be [...] longer for these aircraft to operate safely. At the time, a spokeswoman from Brazil's National Civil Aviation Agency claimed [...] "The safety conditions of the runway and the airport as a whole are adequate." [...] TAM also objected to the decision, with a spokesman stating [...] "If the injunction stands, it will cause total chaos," [...] claiming over 10,000 passengers per day would be inconvenienced. The airport authorities appealed the decision, resulting in it being overturned the following day. An appeals court overruled the ban on the three types of planes, saying it was too harsh as it would have severe economic ramifications and that there were not enough safety concerns to prevent the planes from landing and taking off from the airport. [...] "The runway was reopened because of popular pressure," [...] Gianfranco , an aviation consultant, said in a TV interview.|$|E

2500|$|Extensive trials {{using the}} Fastech 360 test trains {{have shown that}} {{operation}} at [...] is not currently feasible because of problems of noise pollution (particularly tunnel boom), overhead wire wear, and <b>braking</b> <b>distances.</b> On 30 October 2012, JR East announced that it is pursuing research and development to increase speeds to 360km/h on the Tohoku Shinkansen by 2020.|$|R
50|$|Passenger trains between Donauwörth and Günzburg are {{scheduled}} to cross at Dillingen. At weekends and holidays this crossing is not required however. The <b>braking</b> <b>distances</b> on the route are up to 1000 m, {{with the exception of}} the Dillingen-Höchstädt section in the direction of Donauwörth, where it is only 700 m.

2500|$|In Germany the {{standard}} distance {{from a distant}} signal to its home signal is [...] On a train with strong brakes, this is the <b>braking</b> <b>distance</b> from 160km/h. In the 1960s Germany evaluated various options to increase speeds, including increasing the distance between distant and home signals, and cab signalling. Increasing {{the distance between the}} home and distant signals would decrease capacity. Adding another aspect would make the signals harder to recognize. In either case, changes to the conventional signals wouldn't solve the problem of the difficulty of seeing and reacting to the signals at higher speeds. To overcome these problems, Germany chose to develop continuous cab signalling.|$|E
2500|$|The Ministry of Transport {{report on}} the {{collision}} was written by Lieut-Col GRS Wilson, {{a senior member of}} the Railway Inspectorate and published in June 1953. The local train should have been protected by two semaphore home signals; the Up Fast Inner Home about [...] to its rear, and the Up Fast Outer Home a further [...] back. A colour distant signal (the Up Fast Distant) would show green if the Outer Home was ‘clear’, or yellow if the Outer Home was at ‘danger’ and was positioned [...] before the Up Fast Outer home; this being the full <b>braking</b> <b>distance</b> for an express at , the speed limit for this section of track.|$|E
2500|$|Before {{the present}} in-cab {{regulations}} came in, British Rail experimented with 140mph running by introducing a fifth, flashing green signalling aspect on the Down Fast line (signals P487 to P615) and Up Fast line (signals P610 to P494) between New England North and Stoke Tunnel. The fifth aspect is still shown in normal service and appears {{when the next}} signal is showing a green (or another flashing green) aspect and the signal section is clear, which ensures that there is sufficient <b>braking</b> <b>distance</b> to bring a train to a stand from 140mph.

50|$|Slush can be {{a problem}} on an {{aircraft}} runway since the effect of excess slush acting on the aircraft's wheels can have a resisting effect during take off, which can cause an accident such as the Munich air disaster. Slush on roads can also increase the <b>braking</b> <b>distances</b> for cars and trucks, increasing the possibility of rear end crashes and other accidents.|$|R
50|$|The second {{main area}} of {{activity}} emerged in 1922, when Knorr moved into pneumatic braking systems for commercial road vehicles. The company {{was the first in}} Europe to develop a system that applied the brakes simultaneously to all four wheels of a truck as well as its trailer.

2500|$|Many {{roads were}} created {{long before the}} current sight {{distance}} standards were adopted, and the financial burden on many jurisdictions would be formidable to: acquire and maintain additional right-of-way; redesign roadbeds on all of them; or implement future projects on rough terrain, or environmentally sensitive areas. In such cases, the bare minimum corner sight distance should be equal to the stopping sight distance. While a corner sight distance which far exceed the <b>braking</b> <b>distance</b> at the design speed should be afforded to the driver, {{he or she is}} still generally required to maintain such control and operating speed as to be able to stop within the Assured Clear Distance Ahead (ACDA), and the [...] always applies.

2500|$|Gladwell {{also noted}} that SUV {{popularity}} is also a sign that people began to shift automobile safety focus from active to passive, {{to the point that}} in the US potential SUV buyers will give up an extra [...] of <b>braking</b> <b>distance</b> because they believe they are helpless to avoid a tractor-trailer hit on any vehicle. The four-wheel drive option available to SUVs reinforced the passive safety notion. To support Gladwell's argument, he mentioned that automotive engineer David Champion noted that in his previous driving experience with Range Rover, his vehicle slid across a four-lane road because he did not perceive the slipping that others had experienced. Gladwell concluded that when a driver feels unsafe when driving a vehicle, it makes the vehicle safer. When a driver feels safe when driving, the vehicle becomes less safe.|$|E
