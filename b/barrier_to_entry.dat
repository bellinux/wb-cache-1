40|$|This paper {{estimates}} {{an index}} of <b>barriers</b> <b>to</b> <b>entry</b> {{for each of the}} 40 Chinese industries by modelling entry as a function of various incentives to enter, relative to the level of <b>barriers</b> <b>to</b> <b>entry.</b> The estimated index was employed to analyse the relationship between <b>barriers</b> <b>to</b> <b>entry</b> and profitability and total factor productivity. The major finding is that an appropriate degree of <b>barriers</b> <b>to</b> <b>entry,</b> 1 but not free <b>entry</b> or high <b>barriers</b> <b>to</b> <b>entry,</b> is beneficial <b>to</b> Chinese industrial performance. This is in contrast to the conventional argument in mainstream industrial economics and the findings of most empirical research. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper compares <b>barriers</b> <b>to</b> <b>entry</b> in the {{broadband}} markets {{between the}} U. S. and South Korea. First, it explores economic conceptions of <b>barriers</b> <b>to</b> <b>entry</b> from the economics literature. Second, it speculates {{on how the}} conception of <b>barriers</b> <b>to</b> <b>entry</b> has been {{dealt with in the}} telecommunications industry. It clarifies the various industrial factors that could prevent, or make it difficult, to successfully enter the residential telecommunications market. Third, it introduces an analytical framework that can be adopted for evaluating the <b>barriers</b> <b>to</b> <b>entry.</b> Fourth, employing that framework, it examines the broadband markets in the U. S. and in South Korea, focusing on <b>barriers</b> <b>to</b> <b>entry</b> in multiple broadband access platforms. Both the U. S. and South Korea have shown greater <b>barriers</b> <b>to</b> <b>entry</b> in wireline broadband markets such as cable modem and DSL compared to wireless broadband when it comes <b>to</b> a facilities-based <b>entry.</b> South Korea has offered more opportunity to non-dominant ISPs as new entrants and thus, has been able to facilitate more vibrant competition nationwide.

25|$|Network {{effect is}} a benefit to {{society as a whole}} because it {{positively}} relates to and affects the Intellectual Commons, Property Rights, and Cultural Commons of the world. One form of network externality is social media, which is a peer-to-peer network ran by a privately held for profit business. Although the creation of a large network creates a <b>barrier</b> <b>to</b> <b>entry</b> according to Porters five forces and may prevent a few from creating a new form of P2P networking, it largely benefits society as whole and provides a new form of a common-pool resource so largely scalable that the entire world has the ability to use it. Although the <b>barrier</b> <b>to</b> <b>entry</b> may be high, there is no true form of monopoly in the P2P social sharing market. For example, Facebook holds a large stake in the P2P social sharing market, but it is not mutually exclusive, meaning users can have an account on Facebook and also have an account on Twitter. Furthermore, there becomes no true critical mass in this space due to the ability for technology and innovation to constantly adapt to different environments, market for underdeveloped countries to integrate with social sharing is unlimited.|$|E

25|$|Spamming remains {{economically}} viable because advertisers have no operating costs beyond {{the management of}} their mailing lists, servers, infrastructures, IP ranges, and domain names, {{and it is difficult}} to hold senders accountable for their mass mailings. Because the <b>barrier</b> <b>to</b> <b>entry</b> is so low, spammers are numerous, and the volume of unsolicited mail has become very high. In the year 2011, the estimated figure for spam messages is around seven trillion. The costs, such as lost productivity and fraud, are borne by the public and by Internet service providers, which have been forced to add extra capacity to cope with the deluge. Spamming has been the subject of legislation in many jurisdictions.|$|E
