40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a systematic historical study of the seismic, bradyseismic and eruptive activity of the Campi Flegrei caldera. The aim is to make a revised historical data available for accurate volcanological interpretation, supplying additional data and highlighting spurious previous data. The analysis begins with the supposed 1198 eruption, which did not actually take place. No information is available for the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. As far as the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries are concerned, only direct sources were examined for this paper, and they include many different types of evidence. The chronological breadth of the analysis has also provided information about the seismic crises and <b>bradyseisms</b> prior to the eruption of 1538. The exceptional nature of this 1538 eruption attracted the attention of intellectuals, diplomats and natural philosophers, who left valuable accounts, which we have analysed, and which include many that are still available in their original manuscript form. The previous studies concerning the 1538 eruption were based on 23 (variously used) sources. We have examined 35 additional sources bringing the overall corpus of sources analysed to 58. The results provide a more precise scenario of events preceding the 1538 eruption, including bradyseismic activity starting {{from the end of the}} fifteenth century. The chronology of the phenomena described comprises the core result of this study, and has been constructed so as to clarify the time, location and impact of each event. For the 1538 eruption, a countdown is included which may also have a predictive value. For the last 36 hours before eruption began, the countdown is hour-by-hour. The effects of the eruption and earthquakes on people, structures and society are also described for Pozzuoli, Agnano and Naples. The areas where heavy materials and ash fell are likewise indicated, as well are the earth tremors felt by the population from the eruptive crisis up to 1582...|$|R

50|$|In the 1960s and 1970s Licola {{emerged as}} a {{significant}} tourist attraction. After the Irpinia earthquake in 1980 and the <b>bradyseism</b> of 1982, however, many displaced people sought shelter in Licola and its tourist industry went into a period of decline.

50|$|In particular, {{the town}} of Pozzuoli {{features}} the Roman Macellum of Pozzuoli in which three marble columns show bands of boreholes or Gastrochaenolites left by marine Lithophaga molluscs. These occur up to 7 metres up the columns, showing how <b>bradyseism</b> in the area lowered the land to at least this depth under the sea and subsequently raised it again.|$|E
50|$|More recently, between 1968 and 1972, the Campi Flegrei area {{suffered}} {{an episode of}} positive <b>bradyseism</b> and rose by 1.7 metres. Another rise of 1.8 metres occurred between 1982 and 1984. This correlated with a shallow (4 km deep) earthquake swarm during the same period, {{which led to the}} evacuation of 30,000 people due to the perceived risk of imminent eruption.|$|E

5000|$|It {{has been}} {{established}} that in Roman times, on the coastal stretch, now known as San Marco, east of the promontory, {{and to the right}} of the Testene, a seaside town called [...] "Ercula" [...] developed and flourished between the 1st century BCE, and the 5th century CE.

The area exhibits small localised earthquake swarms, <b>bradyseism,</b> and release {{of carbon dioxide}} and hydrogen sulfide into the atmosphere. The uplift and earthquake swarms have been interpreted as caused by a slowly growing spherical magma chamber 5-6 kilometres below the surface; some think that it may erupt again; if so, there is risk to Rome, which is only 25 to 30 km away.|$|E
5000|$|The Macellum of Pozzuoli, {{also known}} as the Temple of Serapis or serapeum, is {{considered}} the city's symbol. The [...] "temple" [...] was actually a marketplace. Its name derives from the misinterpretation of its function after a statue of the god Serapis was found in 1750 at this location. The Macellum includes three majestic columns in Cipollino marble, which show erosion from marine Lithophaga molluscs when, at an earlier time, the ground level was much lower due to <b>Bradyseism,</b> and sea-water could flow in.|$|E
50|$|It is one {{of several}} caves worldwide, that is flooded with a {{brilliant}} blue or emerald light. The quality and nature of the color in each cave is determined by the unique lighting conditions in that particular cave. The grotto, which is located at the Amalfi Coast, is partly filled with sea water. The surface area of the water measures roughly 45 x 32 metres, with a cavern roof about 24 metres above water level. Formation of cave was caused by <b>bradyseism</b> - tectonic upheaval of cliffs, where cliffs fractured and cave was formed along the fissures. Now the cave has descended and sea water had entered it, partly flooding the stalagmites in it.|$|E
5000|$|Solfatara (Solfatara di Pozzuoli) is {{a shallow}} {{volcanic}} crater at Pozzuoli, near Naples, {{part of the}} Campi Flegrei volcanic area. It is a dormant volcano, which still emits jets of steam with sulfurous fumes. The name comes from the Latin, Sulpha terra, [...] "land of sulfur", or [...] "sulfur earth". It was formed around 4000 years ago and last erupted in 1198 with what was probably a phreatic eruption - an explosive steam-driven eruption caused when groundwater interacts with magma. The crater floor is a popular tourist attraction, as it has many fumaroles and mud pools. The area {{is well known for}} its <b>bradyseism.</b> The vapours have been used for medical purposes since Roman times.|$|E
5000|$|More recent {{investigations}} of the vertical movements {{have shown that the}} site is near the centre of the Campi Flegrei (Phlegraean Fields) caldera and has been subject to repeated [...] "slow earthquakes" [...] or <b>bradyseism</b> of this shallow caldera resulting in relatively slow subsidence over long periods, drowning the ruin, punctuated by periods of relatively rapid uplift that caused it to re-emerge. After a long subsidence through Roman times, there was a period of uplift in the Middle Ages around AD 700 to 800, then after more subsidence the land rose again from around 1500 up to the last eruption in 1538. The land again subsided gradually, then between 1969 and 1973 the land rose by about 1.7 m. Over the following decade there was a little subsidence, then between 1982 and 1994 there was uplift of almost 2 m. Concerns about risks of earthquake damage and possible eruption led to temporary evacuation of the city of Pozzuoli. Detailed measurements indicated that the caldera deformation formed a nearly circular lens centred near Pozzuoli. Various models have been produced to find mechanisms explaining this pattern.|$|E

In Laguna there are environmental problems, archaeological, eustatism and <b>bradyseism.</b> Laguna and city, also as metropolitan area, represent a unified whole, inseparable.

40|$|Campi Flegrei (CF) {{is a large}} {{volcanic}} complex located west of {{the city}} of Naples, Italy. Repeated episodes of <b>bradyseism</b> (slow vertical ground movement) near the town of Pozzuoli have been documented since Roman times. Bradyseismic events are interpreted as the consequence of aqueous fluid exsolution during magma solidification on a slow timescale (10 (3) - 10 (4) yr) superimposed upon a shorter (1 - 10 yr) timescale for the episodic expulsion of fluid from a deep (similar to 3 - 5 km) lithostatically-pressured low-permeability reservoir to an overlying hydrostatic reservoir. Cycles of inflation and deflation occur during short duration transient events when connectivity is established between deep and shallow hydrothermal reservoirs. The total seismic energy released (4 x 10 (13) J) during the 1983 - 1984 bradyseismic crisis is consistent with the observed volume change (uplift) and consistent with the notion that seismic failure occurs in response to the shear stress release induced by volume change. Fluid transport and concomitant propagation of hydrofractures as fluid expands from lithostatic to hydrostatic pressure during decompression leads to ground surface displacement. Fluid decompression occurs along the fluid isenthalp (Joule-Thompson expansion) during transient periods of reservoir connectivity and leads to mineral precipitation. Each kilogram of fluid precipitates about 3 x 10 (- 3) kg of silica along a typical decompression path along the isenthalp. Mineral precipitation modifies the permeability and acts to reseal connection paths thereby isolating lithostatic and hydrostatic reservoirs ending one <b>bradyseism</b> phase and beginning another. Crystallization and exsolution of the magmatic fluid generates approximate to 7 x 10 (15) J of mechanical (P Delta V) energy, and this is sufficient to accomplish the observed uplift at CF. Although magma emplacement is the ultimate origin of <b>bradyseism,</b> fresh recharge of magma is not a prerequisite. Instead, short to intermediate timescale phenomena associated with fluid decompression and expansion in the crust with large variations in permeability, including permeability anisotropy, are the key elements at CF...|$|E

40|$|Critical {{analysis}} of the literature, geomorphologic and geoarchaeological surveys on the mainland and submerged landscape of Campania, allow to evaluate types, entity and rates of ground vertical motions responsible of archaeological heritage submersion and shoreline erosion. Discrimination of vertical motions linked to <b>bradyseism,</b> volcano-tectonic and subsidence are fundamental for the comprehension of coastal morphodinamics from Greek and Roman ages to the current, {{as well as for}} the evaluation of related risk, in order to plan interventions for archaeological heritage safeguard. The ancient sea levels registered along the Campania coastal sectors show geomorphologic elements related to their settlement phases during the Quaternary. Shorelines are often located at various elevations and through different ways, so they supply information about eustatism and volcano-tectonics. The study of archaeological structures allow to deduce both palaeo-sea level traces and ground vertical deformations in the illustrated case studies. In particular, different sectors of the Gulf of Naples were inspected, among which (i) the Vesuvius coast (Castellammare di Stabia-Portici), (ii) the Neapolitan-Phlegrean area (Castel dell’Ovo-Posillipo and Baia-Capo Miseno), (iii) the Phlegrean Islands (Procida, Vivara, Ischia), finally (iv) the Gulf of Gaeta (Torregaveta-Sinuessa). Preliminary results underline differential vertical motions linked to (i) volcano-tectonic, (ii and iii) <b>bradyseism,</b> (iv) complex vertical movements (<b>bradyseism,</b> subsidence, tectonics and volcano-tectonic). The highest values registered (e. g. - 4. 3 m along the Vesuvius coast, - 4. 5 /- 12 m along the Neapolitan-Phlegrean coast, - 3. 5 /- 11 m at Torregaveta-Sinuessa and - 9 /- 4. 5 m in the islands of Vivara and Ischia, respectively) change in the different morphostructural sectors of the Gulf of Naples, resulting usually higher than 2 mm/y which represents the average subsidence rate during the last 130 ky (Tyrrhenian). Among the case studies, the underwater survey of Sinuessa area was particularly interesting: actually, it was possible to reconstruct the coastline morphoevolution phases through the identification of geoarchaeological markers as a carved millstone, 24 Roman pilae, amphorae and anchors fields. The highest value of ground vertical downlift (- 7 m) likely indicates recent tectonic activity. In addition to the study of geoarchaeological markers, like fish farms or planking levels, also mineral-petrographic and minerogenetic {{analysis of}} Roman age mortar (opus cementicium) are significant; indeed, through these data it can be hypothesized both the provenience of material and the environment where artefacts were installed. An example is the differentiation between lime mortar and seawater concretes: the first is a mix of lime and aggregates that could be used only in subaerial area, while the second consists of lime, aggregates and pozzolanic material which manages to be efficient even if submerged...|$|E
40|$|Campi Flegrei (Phlegrean Fields) is {{an active}} {{volcanic}} center near Naples, Italy. Numerous eruptions have occurred here during the Quaternary, and repeated episodes of slow vertical ground movement (<b>bradyseism)</b> have been documented since Roman times.

The model is consistent with field and laboratory observations and predicts that uplift between 1982 and 1984 was associated with crystallization of similar to 0. 83 km(3) of H(2) O-saturated magma at 6 km depth. During crystallization, similar to 6. 2 x 10 (10) kg of H(2) O and 7. 5 x 10 (8) kg of CO(2) exsolved from the magma and generated similar to 7 x 10 (15) J of mechanical (P Delta V) energy to drive the observed uplift.

Several architectural structures are still preserved into the submerged environment, such as: luxurious maritime villas, imperial buildings, private houses, thermae, tabernae and warehouses. In particular, some samples were collected from the masonry walls belonging to a building of the underwater area called Villa a Protiro.

These unrest phenomena result from the complex interaction between magma chamber, hydrothermal fluid circulation, and country rocks undergoing thermal and mechanical stresses. In order to make an effective hazard assessment in such a densely populated area as the Phlegrean Fields, we must first reach {{a better understanding of the}} mechanism driving bradyseismic activity and determine the relation between ground deformation and hydrothermal fluid circulation.

40|$|Long time-series of {{chemical}} composition of fumaroles and of soil CO 2 flux reveal that important {{variations in the}} activity of Solfatara fumarolic field, the most important hydrothermal site of Campi Flegrei, occurred in the 2000 - 2008 period. A continuous increase of the CO 2 concentration and a general decrease of the CH 4 concentration are interpreted as the consequence of the increment of the relative amount of magmatic fluids, rich in CO 2 and poor in CH 4, hosted by the hydrothermal system. Contemporaneously the H 2 O-CO 2 -He-N 2 gas system shows remarkable compositional variations in the samples collected after July 2000 {{with respect to the}} previous ones, indicating the progressive arrival at the surface of a magmatic component different from that involved in the 1983 - 84 <b>bradyseism.</b> The change starts in 2000 concurrently with the occurrence of relatively deep long periods seismic events which, in our interpretation, were the indicator of the opening of an easy pathway for the transfer of magmatic fluids towards the shallower, brittle domain hosting the hydrothermal system.

40|$|Ground {{deformations}} {{in active}} volcanoes are considered precursors of eruptions {{according to the}} most tested models; therefore monitoring networks of ground deformations are installed on inhabited dangerous volcanoes. Direct measurements of such deformations are carried out since 1861 when Luigi Palmieri monitored the eruption at Mt. Vesuvius with levelings along the shoreline near the town of Torre del Greco. Relative sea level changes were measured at Serapeo in Pozzuoli in the middle of 19 th century to record soil uplifts which are locally known as <b>bradyseism.</b> To enlarge the time series of data on these phenomena it is necessary to utilize historical and prehistorical informations on the location of shore-line of human settlements. As regards the regions of active volcanoes as the Neapolitan one three processes contribute to sea level changes as eustatism, regional tectonics and local intrusive and effusive phenomena. Therefore {{at the same time the}} relative sea level should be different at far-away places only few kilometres according to the volcanic activity.

This topic is first examined from the theoretical point of view with regard to an ideal isotropic thermo-elastic porous medium. Some special features of the behaviour of natural soils and rocks during thermal expansion tests are subsequently discussed. An experimental evaluation of some of these coefficients is presented {{in the second part of}} the paper. The material investigated is a pyroclastic rock, the so-called Neapolitan Yellow Tuff. Thermal expansion coefficient in drained conditions has been evaluated, when this material is saturated with water. The pore pressure increase induced by heating has been measured in undrained tests. The temperatures investigated range between room temperature up to 225 degrees. Different types of apparatus have been used and, when possible, a comparison between the results has been proposed. The results obtained in undrained thermal expansion tests are in agreement with theoretical predictions.

This was operated during the paroxysmic phase of the ground uplift (<b>bradyseism)</b> {{that occurred in the}} years 1983 – 1984. The Nishigami technique has been used to obtain the 3 D distribution of the strong scatterers in an earth volume with a horizontal extension of 20 km× 20 km and a vertical thickness of 6 km. This earth volume was segmented in blocks of 2 km× 2 km× 2 km for the outer section, and in blocks of 1 km× 1 km× 1 km for the inner section. The inversion was performed using a hybrid jackknife-SVD method that has allowed qualitative control of the stability and robustness of the solution. The results show that the scatterers revealed by the coda envelopes, which were band-pass filtered at a center frequency of 18 Hz, match the inner border of the caldera rim, which is well outlined on land by geological observations. The scatterer position also delineates this border well beneath sea level. These results are in close agreement with recently obtained seismic velocity tomography.

Measurements have been performed under isothermal, non-isothermal and transient non-isothermal conditions using a specifically designed apparatus. Results of measurements of porosity of different samples are also reported. Experimental results in isothermal conditions show that the volume flux through the samples changes linearly with applied pressure. The values of permeability obtained turn out to be independent of the temperature and pressure gradients applied to the samples. This result is consistent {{with the fact that the}} permeability is a characteristic of the porous medium, and as such is not affected by temperature and pressure variation, at least in the range examined. The permeability values measured in our laboratories agree quite well with the ones measured in situ by the Agenzia Generale Italiana Petroli (AGIP) during a geothermal exploration of the Campi Flegrei area in 1980. An interesting, still unexplained phenomenon has been detected during transient phases when both pressure and temperature gradients were applied to the samples. The phenomenon consists in an enhancement of volume flux due to heat flux in the transient phase. The extra volume-flux disappears once the steady temperature gradient is reached...|$|E

The activities of 2 ̆ 2 RIlievi per la Caratterizzazione dell’Ambiente MARino nel Golfo di Pozzuoli 2013 (RICAMAR 2013) 2 ̆ 2 project - sinergically conducted by the Italian Navy 2 ̆ 7 s Survey Vessel 2 ̆ 2 Ammiraglio Magnaghi 2 ̆ 2, the Italian Hydrographic Office (IIM) and the Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia (INGV) - were targeted to fulfill this gap. In fact, the creation of marine observatories about the caldera 2 ̆ 7 s phenomena will be based on the data collected during these bathymetric, magnetometric, stratigrafic and hydrologic surveys...|$|E

Such experiments involved monitoring, by means of optical fibre strain-metre and total laser station, of a selected building that, owing to its position in the active caldera of the Campi Flegrei (Southern Italy), could undergo remarkable ground shaking and large, although very slow, ground movements (bradyseismic crises) of volcanic origin. The field geodetic monitoring has been realised by an automatic system of topographical 3 D survey, based on two automatic Total Station Leica TCA 2003 and by increasing the number of benchmarks of the levelling network in the area near the building. The experiments have shown that structure deformations caused by elastic phase, when the building undergoes elastic deformation, is close or under the limit of detection through laser total station (about 1 – 2 mm), while, when the damage occurs, deformations increase up to values beyond 10 – 20 mm easily detectable by geodetic methods. The optical fibre monitoring provides good results in elastic phase, whereas as the damage level rises up the data become more and more difficult to understand. In conclusion the paper shows that the geodetic techniques are very useful in structural quasi real-time monitoring for analysing the behaviour of masonry buildings damaged by ground movements induced by landslide phenomena, <b>bradyseism</b> or intrinsic structural yielding...|$|E
