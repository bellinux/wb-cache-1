5|$|Opened {{as part of}} {{an attempt}} to {{encourage}} holiday traffic on the line, the halt primarily served golfers at the nearby Royal Cromer Golf Club.

No shelter was provided for passengers and the platform was constructed of sleepers and supported by wooden trestles.|$|E

5|$|Structure 5C-45 is {{the east}} {{range of a}} palace complex that also {{incorporates}} 5C-46 (the south range) and 5C-47 (the west range). This structure was remodelled in the Terminal Classic with the closing of some doorways, addition of some <b>benches</b> <b>and</b> {{the construction of new}} sections with multiple doorways. Although Tikal was completely abandoned soon afterwards, this continuation in complex construction activity indicated that the elite residents were still inhabiting the palace at this time.|$|E

5|$|Facilities at {{the station}} are minimal– shelters, <b>benches</b> <b>and</b> {{timetable}} information are provided. Customer help points give live train information. There is no ticket office, and no self-service ticket machines {{which can be used}} to buy or collect tickets. The station car park is {{to the north of the}} platforms, with 40 spaces. There is step-free access to the northern platform from the car park, and a set of steps from the footbridge. There is also stepped access to the footbridge from the south, and a ramp down to the southern platform. There is no taxi rank, but there are bus stops on Whiteladies Road.

5|$|In 2003, the MBTA spent {{slightly}} less than $100,000 to rehabilitate the deteriorated garage and to convert the drop-off lane into a full busway with shelters, <b>benches,</b> <b>and</b> signage. The busway opened on September 9, 2003 and 21 MBTA Bus routes were rerouted from Central Square. In late 2005, the MBTA spent $168,000 for repairs to the garage roof, which frequently leaked during rain. The 1992 station was built with new concrete ties supporting the tracks connecting to the station, which proved less durable than expected. In September 2008, the MBTA board authorized a $1 million tie replacement and slope stabilization project at the station.|$|E

5|$|Over 160 {{structures}} {{have been}} mapped at Iximche. The structures {{were faced with}} stone blocks that were coated in lime plaster, which in some cases was then painted with Mixtec-Puebla style murals, although few traces of the murals survive today. The Mixtec-Puebla style originated around AD 900 in central Mexico and spread from there throughout Mesoamerica. The superstructures of buildings at Iximche were built from adobe blocks and once supported beam and mortar roofs but none have survived. The platform cores were generally built of rough stones set in a clay matrix. A few of the structures have been restored and the site core is kept clear of overgrowth. Residential structures built on platforms around the ceremonial plazas usually had built-in <b>benches</b> <b>and</b> hearths.|$|E
