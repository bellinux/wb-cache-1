40|$|Understanding the {{mechanisms}} by which catchments route vertical water inputs laterally to stream channels {{is central to the}} development of accurate predictive models of watershed processes. It is commonly assumed that lateral redistribution occurs as overland or subsurface flow. Lateral flow can also occur within the snowpack during rain-on-snow (ROS) events or spring melt, sometimes resulting in surface expressions commonly called 2 ̆ 2 runnels. 2 ̆ 2 This thesis examines lateral flow <b>through</b> <b>snow</b> {{and the role of the}} snowpack as a rapid down-slope water delivery mechanism, with the goal of determining if lateral flow <b>through</b> <b>snow</b> is an important control on streamflow generation and soil moisture. To quantify the flux of lateral flow <b>through</b> <b>snow,</b> we installed two identical 4 m 2 snowmelt lysimeters side-by-side on a 20 degree slope in the snow dominated Dry Creek Experimental Watershed, near Boise, Idaho. One lysimeter was blocked from lateral upslope inputs (control site) while the second lysimeter was not (experimental site). Both lysimeters were blocked on the downslope side. The experiment was designed so the total volume of water routed laterally through the snowpack could be estimated from the difference between the two plots. Through the 2010 - 2011 snow season, the experimental lysimeter collected 47...|$|R
