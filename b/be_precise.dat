5|$|A {{computer}} program such as KetoCalculator {{may be used}} to help generate recipes. The meals often have four components: heavy whipping cream, a protein-rich food (typically meat), a fruit or vegetable and a fat such as butter, vegetable oil or mayonnaise. Only low-carbohydrate fruits and vegetables are allowed, which excludes bananas, potatoes, peas and corn. Suitable fruits are divided into two groups based on the amount of carbohydrate they contain, and vegetables are similarly divided into two groups. Foods within each of these four groups may be freely substituted to allow for variation without needing to recalculate portion sizes. For example, cooked broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower and green beans are all equivalent. Fresh, canned or frozen foods are equivalent, but raw and cooked vegetables differ, and processed foods are an additional complication. Parents are required to <b>be</b> <b>precise</b> when measuring food quantities on an electronic scale accurate to 1g. The child must eat the whole meal and cannot have extra portions; any snacks must be incorporated into the meal plan. A small amount of MCT oil {{may be used to}} help with constipation or to increase ketosis.|$|E
5|$|At {{some point}} Ceawlin ceased {{to hold the}} title of bretwalda, perhaps after a battle at Stoke Lyne, in Oxfordshire, which the Chronicle dates to 584, some eight years before he was deposed in 592 (again using the Chronicle's {{unreliable}} dating). Æthelberht certainly was a dominant ruler by 601, when Gregory the Great wrote to him: Gregory urges Æthelberht to spread Christianity among those kings and peoples subject to him, implying some level of overlordship. If the battle of Wibbandun was fought c. 590, as has been suggested, then Æthelberht must have gained his position as overlord {{at some time in}} the 590s. This dating for Wibbandun is slightly inconsistent with the proposed dates of 581–588 for Ceawlin's reign, but those dates are not thought to <b>be</b> <b>precise,</b> merely the most plausible given the available data.|$|E

25|$|The ﬁrst {{attempt at}} a {{grammatical}} description of Shilha {{is the work of}} the German linguist Hans Stumme (1864–1936), who in 1899 published his Handbuch des Schilḥischen von Tazerwalt. Stumme's grammar remained the richest source of grammatical information on Shilha for half a century. A problem with the work is its use of an over-elaborate, phonetic transcription which, while designed to <b>be</b> <b>precise,</b> generally fails to provide a transparent representation of spoken forms. Stumme also published a collection of Shilha fairy tales (1895, re-edited in Stroomer 2002).|$|E

In Singapore's hawker centres – a technical misnomer, to <b>be</b> <b>precise</b> – for example, traditionally Malay hawker stalls selling halal food may serve halal versions of traditionally Tamil or Chinese food. Chinese stalls may introduce Malay or Indian ingredients, cooking techniques or entire dishes into their range of catering. Some dishes introduce elements from all three cultures, while others incorporate influences from the rest of Asia and the West.|$|E
25|$|Muralitharan took 795 wickets for {{his country}} Sri Lanka in 132 tests. The next most wickets for Sri Lanka in these 132 Tests was Chaminda Vaas' 309 – less than 40% of the spinner's pile. No one else managed 100. Collectively Sri Lankan bowlers tallied 1968 wickets across that span, of which Muralitharan {{accounted}} for 40.4%. Among the 24 other Sri Lankans who took more than 10 of those wickets, only Lasith Malinga did so at a better strike rate (52.3) than Muralitharan's 54.9 – and the latter bowled rather more overs, 6657.1 of them to <b>be</b> <b>precise.</b>|$|E

25|$|Job {{performance}} represents behaviors employees {{engage in}} while at work which contribute to organizational goals. These behaviors are formally evaluated by an organization {{as part of}} an employee's responsibilities. In order to understand and ultimately predict job performance, it is important to <b>be</b> <b>precise</b> when defining the term. Job performance is about behaviors that are within the control of the employee and not about results (effectiveness), the costs involved in achieving results (productivity), the results that can be achieved in a period of time (efficiency), or the value an organization places on a given level of performance, effectiveness, productivity or efficiency (utility).|$|E
25|$|A {{systematic}} error or bias occurs {{when there is}} a difference between the true value (in the population) and the observed value (in the study) from any cause other than sampling variability. An example of {{systematic error}} is if, unknown to you, the pulse oximeter you are using is set incorrectly and adds two points to the true value each time a measurement is taken. The measuring device could <b>be</b> <b>precise</b> but not accurate. Because the error happens in every instance, it is systematic. Conclusions you draw based on that data will still be incorrect. But the error can be reproduced in the future (e.g., by using the same mis-set instrument).|$|E
25|$|There is no {{count of}} {{recorded}} lynchings which claims to <b>be</b> <b>precise,</b> and their numbers {{vary depending on}} the source, the years considered, and the definition used to define an incident. The Tuskegee Institute has recorded 3,446 blacks and 1,297 whites being lynched between 1882 and 1968, with the annual peak occurring in the 1890s, at a time of economic stress in the South and political suppression of blacks. A five-year study published in 2015 by the Equal Justice Initiative found that nearly 3,959 black men, women, and children were lynched in the twelve Southern states between 1877 and 1950. Over this period Georgia's 586 lynchings led all states.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} {{determined}} that early inhabitants in this region began building fortifications around 2700 BCE, with the Dolmen of Herdade de Zambujal being the more central, with a very complex plan and up to six reconstructions in its lifetime. These cultures left behind many traces of their culture: stylized cups, crescents of clay, sticks of slate and the so-called plate-idols, that some archaeo-astronomers consider to <b>be</b> <b>precise</b> calendaries. Nevertheless, the exchange with other groups, particularly Los Millares, is also present in the archaeological record. The inhabitants of the fort had its economy based on agriculture and grazing, which was suitable to the surrounding lowlands.|$|E
25|$|Serotonin {{modulator}} and stimulators (SMSs), {{sometimes referred}} to more simply as serotonin modulators, are a type of drug with a multimodal action specific to the serotonin neurotransmitter system. To <b>be</b> <b>precise,</b> SMSs simultaneously modulate one or more serotonin receptors and inhibit the reuptake of serotonin. The term was created to describe the mechanism of action of the serotonergic antidepressant vortioxetine (Brintellix/Trintellix), which acts as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI), partial agonist of the 5-HT1A receptor, and antagonist of the 5-HT3 and 5-HT7 receptors. However, it can also technically be applied to vilazodone (Viibryd), which is an antidepressant as well and acts as an SRI and 5-HT1A receptor partial agonist.|$|E
25|$|While {{the idea}} of beta {{reduction}} seems simple enough, {{it is not an}} atomic step, in that it must have a non-trivial cost when estimating computational complexity. To <b>be</b> <b>precise,</b> one must somehow find the location of all of the occurrences of the bound variable V in the expression E, implying a time cost, or one must keep track of these locations in some way, implying a space cost. A naïve search for the locations of V in E is O(n) in the length n of E. This has led to the study of systems that use explicit substitution. Sinot's director strings offer a way of tracking the locations of free variables in expressions.|$|E

25|$|These 29 goals {{all came}} in the {{domestic}} league and Lambert shared this tally with Swindon Town's Simon Cox, who just like Lambert was playing in his last season for his club, moving to West Bromwich Albion of the Coca-Cola Championship. Despite the loss of striker Lambert, a fine start to the 2009–10 season pushed Rovers into 3rd place in {{the table at the}} start of October, which included a thrilling 3–2 victory away to Southampton on 29 September in which a last minute (96th to <b>be</b> <b>precise)</b> goal by Andy Williams saw Rovers clinch victory and go four points clear of 4th placed Colchester United. A run of five successive defeats, however, including 5–1 and 4–0 defeats to Norwich City and Leeds United respectively, saw Rovers drop out of the play-off places. Rovers maintained a very consistent level of performance throughout the remainder of the season, never falling out of the top 10 positions in the league table. Eventually, on 10 April 2010, Rovers' play-off hopes were put to an end for another season after losing 2–1 away to Oldham Athletic. The side finished the season in 10th place after gaining only one point from their last six games.|$|E
