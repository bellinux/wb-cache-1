5|$|After {{staying for}} a period in Robert's stronghold of Bristol, Matilda {{established}} her court in nearby Gloucester, still safely in the south-west but far enough away for her to remain independent of her half-brother. Although there had <b>been</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> few new defections to her cause, Matilda still controlled a compact block of territory stretching out from Gloucester and Bristol south into Wiltshire, west into the Welsh Marches and east through the Thames Valley as far as Oxford and Wallingford, threatening London. Her influence extended down into Devon and Cornwall, and north through Herefordshire, but her authority in these areas remained limited.|$|E
5|$|In July 2006, sewage {{discharge}} from a pumping station {{resulted in the}} death of an estimated 1,400 fish, mostly juveniles. Brian Finn of the Fisheries Conservation Board suggested that there may have <b>been</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> small amount of sewage released but the high water temperatures and the low water levels caused by the warm weather at the time increased the fish's vulnerability to pollution. The pollution led to the temporary closure of the boating lake and part of the beach near the mouth of the river.|$|E
5|$|To {{bolster the}} new amendment, Grant {{relied on the}} army and signed {{legislation}} creating the Justice Department, primarily to enforce federal laws in the South. Where the attorney general had once <b>been</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> legal adviser to the president, he now led a cabinet department dedicated to enforcing federal law, including a solicitor general to argue on the government's behalf in court. Under Grant's first attorney general, Ebenezer R. Hoar, the administration was not very aggressive in prosecuting white Southerners who terrorized their black neighbors, but Hoar's successor, Amos T. Akerman, was more zealous.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Depression Three {{formed on}} July 3 in the Caribbean Sea, {{but the next}} day, before being able to strengthen, it moved over the Yucatán Peninsula. The system emerged into the Gulf of Mexico on July 4 at which point a new center of {{circulation}} developed at {{the northern edge of}} the system and the system strengthened to a tropical storm, becoming Tropical Storm Cindy early July 4. The storm moved rapidly across the Gulf and made landfall near Grand Isle, Louisiana late July 5 as a minimal hurricane; though it was originally thought to have <b>been</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> tropical storm at landfall, it was upgraded to a hurricane in the post-storm analysis. As most storms do, it weakened while over land and became extratropical over the Carolinas on July 7.|$|E

25|$|Indeed, this {{development}} of a pagan order created the foundations of a bridge of reconciliation over which paganism and Christianity could meet. Likewise, Julian’s persecution of Christians, who by pagan standards were simply part of a different cult, was quite an un-pagan attitude that transformed paganism into a religion that accepted only one form of religious experience while excluding all others—such as Christianity. In trying to compete with Christianity in this manner, Julian fundamentally {{changed the nature of}} pagan worship. That is, he made paganism a religion, whereas it once had <b>been</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> system of tradition.|$|E

He executes a plan to achieve world dominion through the High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program with a prototype particle beam weapon to hold the world hostage. He is portrayed as utterly ruthless, calmly destroying all of Moscow just to demonstrate the beam's power and killing anyone in his organisation who shows cowardice or threatens his command, such as Sebastian Bludd. Cobra Commander was voiced by Charlie Adler.|$|E

25|$|Agents for the Tidewater Railway quietly struck {{deals with}} the landowners and various {{communities}} all along the way. Many were small towns and villages that had been passed by when the big railroads were choosing routes and building 20–25 years earlier, and the new railroad was welcomed. At several key points, negotiations were especially sensitive. Roanoke was one such place, as the Norfolk & Western had virtually put Roanoke on the map only 20 years earlier when it had <b>been</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> tiny town known as Big Lick. However, {{in the spirit of}} free enterprise, the leaders of the City of Roanoke agreed to provide the needed right-of-way through the city along the north bank of the Roanoke River.

Benson's 1910 production at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre, Robert Atkins' 1923 production at the Apollo Theatre, or Ben Iden Payne's 1938 production at Stratford-upon-Avon. The earliest production about which we have significant information is Michael Langham's 1957 production at The Old Vic, starring Richard Gale as Valentine, Keith Michell as Proteus, Barbara Jefford as Julia and Ingrid Hafner as Silvia. In this production, set in late nineteenth-century Italy and grounded very much in high Romanticism, Proteus threatens to kill himself with a pistol {{at the end of}} the play, prompting Valentine's hasty offer of Silvia.|$|E
25|$|By 19 June, Herefordshire was {{affected}} by flooding. The M50 motorway near Ledbury was closed on 22 July due to flooding. More than 5,200 people in and around Bromyard, Herefordshire were without clean water on 22 and 23 July after the pumps at the Whitbourne works in Herefordshire failed. Once supply was restored residents were urged by Welsh Water to boil their tap-water until further notice. The village of Hampton Bishop, 3miles (5km) {{from the city of}} Hereford remains surrounded and flooded by water after the River Lugg burst its banks. On the afternoon of 24 July the Fire Service began pumping flood water out of the village, but not before 130 residents were evacuated.
