5|$|Astatine has an {{electronegativity}} of 2.2 on {{the revised}} Pauling scale– {{lower than that}} of iodine (2.66) and the same as hydrogen. In hydrogen astatide (HAt) the negative charge is predicted to be on the hydrogen atom, implying that this compound should instead be referred to as astatine hydride. That would <b>be</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> electronegativity of astatine on the Allred–Rochow scale (1.9) being less than that of hydrogen (2.2). The electron affinity of astatine is predicted to be reduced by one-third because of spin–orbit interactions.|$|E

5|$|Attalus was a {{young child}} when his father died, {{sometime}} before 241BC, after which he was adopted by Eumenes I, the incumbent dynast.

5|$|In the {{eleventh}} century, Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen, 965–1040) rejected the Greek ideas about vision, whether the Aristotelian tradition that {{held that the}} form of the perceived object entered the eye (but not its matter), or that of Euclid and Ptolemy that held that the eye emitted a ray. Al-Haytham proposed in his Book of Optics that vision occurs by way of light rays forming a cone with its vertex {{at the center of the}} eye. He suggested that light was reflected from different surfaces in different directions, thus causing objects to look different. He argued further that the mathematics of reflection and refraction needed to <b>be</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> anatomy of the eye.|$|E

5|$|The {{simplest}} {{case for}} computational chemistry is the gas-phase chemistry, {{in which a}} substance is treated {{as if it was}} a gas to eliminate the necessity of taking interactions between molecules in account. Research by multiple authors has been undertaken on dubnium pentachloride: it has been calculated to <b>be</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> periodic laws by exhibiting properties of a compound of a d-block element. For example, the molecular orbital levels indicate dubnium uses three 6d electron levels as expected. One property dubnium pentachloride is expected to show is its increased (compared to its tantalum analog) covalence: a decrease in the effective charge on an atom and an increase in the overlap population (between orbitals of dubnium and chlorine).|$|E

After this, he {{was appointed}} the Director of Military Training at Army Headquarters in April 1954. But he was soon posted as commandant of the Infantry School at Mhow, and also became the colonel of both 8 Gorkha Rifles and 61st Cavalry. 8 Gorkha Rifles became his new regiment, since his original parent regiment, the 12th Frontier Force Regiment, had become part of the new Pakistan Army at partition. He was also part of the 5 Gorkha Rifles (Frontier Force) briefly as he had received his posting order as Commanding Officer of 3/5 Gorkha Rifles (FF). During his tenure as the commandant of the Infantry School, he discovered that the training manuals were outdated, and was instrumental in revamping the manuals to <b>be</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> tactics employed by the Indian Army.|$|E

5|$|Rather than {{treating}} Prokofiev as {{a fugitive}} or exile, the Moscow government chose to consider {{him as a}} general ambassador for Soviet culture, and the composer returned the compliment by registering in France as {{a citizen of the}} Soviet Union, the new state formed on 20 December 1922 by Russia and the states of the former Russian Empire. Prokofiev expressed support for the political developments in what he still considered his homeland, and was keen to resume contacts there. He was accorded VIP status when he paid his first visit to the Soviet Union in 1927, for a recital tour. Further trips followed, and in 1930 Prokofiev took a flat in Moscow, although Paris remained his principal home. During this period of rapprochement he consciously sought to simplify his musical language into a form that he believed would <b>be</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> official Soviet concept of art.|$|E
