Louis Armstrong also recorded a popular version in 1930.|$|E
500|$|The song {{opens with}} the main melody from the Hungarian piece [...] "Csárdás" [...] by Italian {{composer}} Vittorio Monti played on violin, as a distressed Gaga (speaking in a Spanish accent) states: [...] "I {{know that we are}} young, and I know that you may love me/But I just can't <b>be</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> like this anymore, Alejandro." [...] The track then changes to a stomping Europop beat. Gaga bids her ex-lovers farewell with a bitter-hearted pre-chorus where she sings: [...] "You know that I love you, boy/Hot like Mexico, rejoice!/At this point I've got to choose/Nothing to lose." [...] By the end of the song, the three protagonists – Alejandro, Fernando, and Roberto – are bidden farewell by Gaga.|$|E

Demonstrating a talent with the instrument, she performed at her local church. But her concert debut, a classical recital, was given when she was 12. Simone later said that during this performance, her parents, who had taken seats in the front row, were forced to move {{to the back of the}} hall to make way for white people. She said that she refused to play until her parents were moved back to the front, and that the incident contributed to her later involvement in the civil rights movement.|$|E

500|$|In jazz, as in {{classical}} music, tone clusters {{have not been}} restricted to the keyboard. In the 1930s, the Jimmie Lunceford Orchestra's [...] "Stratosphere" [...] included ensemble clusters among an array of progressive elements. The Stan Kenton Orchestra's April 1947 recording of [...] "If I Could <b>Be</b> <b>With</b> <b>You</b> One Hour Tonight," [...] arranged by Pete Rugolo, features a dramatic four-note trombone cluster {{at the end of}} the second chorus. As described by critic Fred Kaplan, a 1950 performance by the Duke Ellington Orchestra features arrangements with the collective [...] "blowing rich, dark, tone clusters that evoke Ravel." [...] Chord clusters also feature in the scores of arranger Gil Evans. [...] In his characteristically imaginative arrangement of George Gershwin's [...] "There's a boat that's leaving soon for New York" [...] from the album Porgy and Bess, Evans contributes chord clusters orchestrated on flutes, alto saxophone and muted trumpets as a background to accompany Miles Davis' solo [...] In the early 1960s, arrangements by Bob Brookmeyer and Gerry Mulligan for Mulligan's Concert Jazz Band employed tone clusters in a dense style bringing to mind both Ellington and Ravel. Eric Dolphy's bass clarinet solos would often feature [...] "microtonal clusters summoned by frantic overblowing." [...] Critic Robert Palmer called the [...] "tart tone cluster" [...] that [...] "pierces a song's surfaces and penetrates to its heart" [...] a specialty of guitarist Jim Hall's.|$|E
500|$|The group {{sent out}} demo tapes to record {{companies}} but received few responses until executives at GRT Records signed the band to a one-record contract, issuing their debut single, [...] "I Want to <b>Be</b> <b>with</b> <b>You</b> Tonight", in 1977. GRT {{was more interested}} in the band as songwriters, and convinced the group to change their name to the Alabama Band, later shortened to Alabama. The song only reached number 78 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts, and GRT declared bankruptcy the following year. Due to a hidden clause in their contract, Alabama was forbidden from recording with another label. For the next two years, the band raised money to buy out their contract and they began recording again in 1979. Following self-recorded efforts Wildcountry (1976) and Deuces Wild (1977), Alabama Band No. 3 became the band's third album, and the band performed over 300 shows on the road that year. The group hired independent radio promoters to receive radio play for the single [...] "I Wanna Come Over", and they sent hand-written letters to program directors and DJs nationwide. It received the attention of Dallas-based MDJ Records, who signed the band. Scott left the group at this time, and was replaced by Mark Herndon, a rock drummer later credited with bringing the band their signature sound. [...] "I Wanna Come Over", became their first radio hit, reaching the top 40 in the Billboard country chart.|$|E
500|$|American singer Mandy Moore has {{released}} six studio albums, three compilation albums, two video albums, twelve singles, and thirteen music videos. After being spotted singing at {{a recording studio}} by an artists and repertoire representative for Epic Records, Moore was signed to Sony Music. Her debut album, So Real, was released in December 1999. The album performed moderately on the charts, peaking at number thirty-one on the Billboard 200 and was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). According to Nielsen SoundScan, So Real had sold about 950,000 copies in the United States, by June 2009. Her debut single, [...] "Candy", peaked at number forty-one on the US Billboard Hot 100, and was certified Gold by the RIAA. It also reached the top forty in Canada, France, Ireland, and Switzerland and the top ten in Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. In Australia the song peaked at number two on the ARIA Singles Chart and was certified Platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA). So Real was followed up with I Wanna <b>Be</b> <b>with</b> <b>You,</b> in May 2000. It is a re-release of the debut album, with remixed tracks and few new songs, the album reached number twenty-one on the Billboard 200 and was certified Gold by the RIAA. It also went on to sell about 805,000 copies in the US by June 2009. The album spawned only one single, the title track, which peaked at number twenty-four on the Hot 100, becoming Moore's only top-thirty song in the US and her highest peak to date. The song also reached number thirteen in Australia and was certified Gold by the ARIA.|$|E

500|$|During 1995 Corgan {{wrote about}} fifty-six songs, {{following}} which the band {{went into the}} studio with producers Flood and Alan Moulder to work on what Corgan described as [...] "The Wall for Generation X", and which became Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness, a double album of twenty-eight songs, lasting over two hours (the vinyl version of the album contained three records, two extra songs, and an alternate track listing). The songs were intended to hang together conceptually {{as a symbol of}} the cycle of life and death. Praised by Time as [...] "the group's most ambitious and accomplished work yet", Mellon Collie debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 in October 1995. Even more successful than Siamese Dream, it was certified ten times platinum in the United States and became the best-selling double album of the decade to date. It also garnered seven 1997 Grammy Award nominations, including Album of the Year. The band won only the Best Hard Rock Performance award, for the album's lead single [...] "Bullet with Butterfly Wings". The album spawned five singles—"Bullet with Butterfly Wings", [...] "1979", [...] "Zero", [...] "Tonight, Tonight" [...] which Corgan stated was inspired by the Cheap Trick song [...] "I'll <b>Be</b> <b>with</b> <b>You</b> Tonight", [...] and [...] "Thirty-Three"—of which the first three were certified gold and all but [...] "Zero" [...] entered the Top 40. Many of the remaining songs that did not make it onto Mellon Collie were released as B-sides to the singles, and were eventually compiled in The Aeroplane Flies High box set. As a testament to the band's popularity, Virgin Records originally intended to limit the set to 200,000 copies, but produced more after the original run sold out due to overwhelming demand.|$|E
500|$|The {{idea of a}} solo singer {{alternating}} with a chorus is extended in the following movement, the bass aria with chorus [...] (Peace <b>be</b> <b>with</b> <b>you).</b> A string introduction depicts in agitated forte passages in 4/4 time the attack of the enemies. John Eliot Gardiner describes it as [...] "a dramatic scena in which the strings work up a storm to illustrate the raging of the soul's enemies". In sharp contrast the bass as the vox Christi (voice of Christ) sings the greeting of Jesus from verse 19 of the Gospel, [...] "Peace be with you", three times, accompanied by woodwinds in dotted rhythm in 3/4 time, marked piano. Musicologist Julian Mincham describes the music as serene, a [...] "gentle, rocking, almost cradle-like rhythm creating a perfect atmosphere of peaceful contemplation". The upper voices of the choir (without basses) answer {{to the music of}} the introduction, seeing Jesus as help in the battle (""). The greeting and answering is repeated two more times in two stanzas of the poem, reflecting the strengthening of the weary in spirit and body (""), and finally overcoming death (""). The following fourth appearance of [...] "Peace be with you" [...] is accompanied by both woodwinds and strings, and peace is finally achieved. Klaus Hofmann describes the movement as an [...] "operatic scene" [...] and continues [...] "Bach resorts to unconventional means; he shows himself as a musical dramatist and, in the process, stresses the element of contrast: he comments upon the words of the faithful with agitated, tumultuous string figures, whilst Jesus' peace greeting sounds calmly and majestically, embedded in pastoral wind sonorities." [...] Bach adapted this movement as the Gloria of his Missa in A major, BWV 234.|$|E
