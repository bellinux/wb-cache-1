Germany, the cradle of the revolutions in physics, with the best minds and the most advanced laboratories of genetics in the world, should have had a primary {{role in the development of}} molecular biology. <b>But</b> <b>history</b> decided differently: the arrival of the Nazis in 1933 - and, to a less extreme degree, the rigidification of totalitarian measures in fascist Italy - caused the emigration of a large number of Jewish and non-Jewish scientists. The majority of them fled to the US or the UK, providing an extra impulse to the scientific dynamism of those nations. These movements ultimately made molecular biology a truly international science from the very beginnings.|$|E

2500|$|In October 2009, Google countered ongoing critics {{by stating}} that its {{scanning}} of books and putting them online would protect the world's cultural heritage; Google co-founder Sergey Brin stated, [...] "The famous Library of Alexandria burned three times, in 48BC, AD273 and AD640, as did the Library of Congress, where a fire in 1851 destroyed two-thirds of the collection. I hope such destruction never happens again, <b>but</b> <b>history</b> would suggest otherwise." [...] This characterization was rebuked by Pam Samuelson, UC Berkeley Professor of Law saying [...] "Libraries everywhere are terrified that Google will engage in price-gouging when setting prices for institutional subscriptions to GBS contents ... Brin forgot to mention another significant difference between GBS and traditional libraries: their policies on patron privacy. ... Google has been unwilling to make meaningful commitments to protect user privacy. Traditional libraries, by contrast, have been important guardians of patron privacy."

2500|$|Painting was the {{dominant}} art form in 17th-century Holland. Dutch Golden Age painting followed {{many of the}} tendencies that dominated Baroque art {{in other parts of}} Europe, as with the Utrecht Caravaggisti, but was the leader in developing the subjects of still life, landscape, and genre painting. Portraiture were also popular, <b>but</b> <b>history</b> painting – traditionally the most-elevated genre struggled to find buyers. [...] Church art was virtually non-existent, and little sculpture of any kind produced. While art collecting and painting for the open market was also common elsewhere, art historians point to the growing number of wealthy Dutch middle-class and successful mercantile patrons as driving forces in the popularity of certain pictorial subjects. Today, the best-known painters of the Dutch Golden Age are the period's most dominant figure Rembrandt, the Delft master of genre Johannes Vermeer, the innovative landscape painter Jacob van Ruisdael, and Frans Hals, who infused new life into portraiture. Some notable artistic styles and trends include Haarlem Mannerism, Utrecht Caravaggism, the School of Delft, the Leiden fijnschilders, and Dutch classicism.|$|E
2500|$|Koss concludes that, in a [...] "long, eventful {{and complex}} career, (that) does not admit easily of a summing up, Asquith's failings were no less {{manifest}} than his achievements."

[...] Of those achievements, his colleague Lord Buckmaster wrote; [...] "The dull senses and heavy lidded eyes of the public prevent them from seeing now all that you have accomplished, <b>but</b> <b>history</b> will record it and the accomplishment is vast." [...] Among his greatest domestic accomplishments, reform of the House of Lords is at the zenith. Yet Asquith's premiership was also marked by many difficulties, leading McKenna to write in his memoirs, [...] "friends began to wonder whether the highest statesmanship consisted of overcoming one crisis by creating another". Hazlehurst, writing in 1970, felt there was still much to be gleaned from a critical review of Asquith's peacetime premiership, [...] "certainly, the record of a prime minister under whom the nation goes {{to the brink of}} civil war [...] must be subjected to the severest scrutiny." ...|$|E

[...] In New York, Rabbi Stephen Samuel Wise told the press after seeing The Birth of a Nation that the film was [...] "an indescribable foul and loathsome libel on a race of human beings". In Boston, the civil rights activist William Monroe Trotter organized demonstrations against the film, which he predicted was going to worsen race relations, while Booker T. Washington wrote a newspaper column asking readers to boycott the film. In Washington D.C, the Reverend Francis James Grimké published a pamphlet entitled [...] "Fighting a Vicious Film" [...] that challenged the historical accuracy of The Birth of a Nation on a scene-by-scene basis.|$|E
