Currently, the country has no regions and each department is expected to join some (I) other (s) to form regions.The administration of each region is managed by a body called the Regional Government, consisting of a regional council, a presidency regional and regional Coordinating Council. Although there is currently no region RBCs have settled at the departmental level to lead the process of regionalization.Peru is a highly centralized country. Thus, in 2003 the central government concentrated 86% of revenue compared to 65% of the countries in the region and 54% in developed countries, public spending of subnational governments was 12% compared to total expenditure, while in the countries of Latin America is 35%, and in most developed countries is 43%. Lima accounts for about 86% of tax revenues.

In 1992 suspended the process and replaced by decentralized administration of the central government called CTAR-Transitory Councils of Regional Administration, in every department, and was accentuated centralism. In 2001, the decentralization process is revitalized with a broad consensus. The organizing principles of the law are: you create regional governments based on historical departments, providing incentives for voluntary merger, clearly defined responsibilities, there is a neutrality and fiscal responsibility is gradually transferred services, no transparency in the process.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the recent Swedish reform and available options on major issues within this reform framework. In June 1994, Sweden’s Parliament passed legislation replacing the old defined benefit {{system with a}} combination of a pay-as-you-go notional defined contribution (NDC) and a DC privately managed financial account scheme, based on a total contribution rate of 18. 5 percent on earnings. The financial account scheme is run using a state-clearing house as a broker, and will have a state monopoly supplier of annuities. During the accumulation period, participants can choose among all registered funds, about 500 when they make their first choice in the autumn of 2000. Accounts were created in 1999, and two annual statements have been sent out since then. If the NDC and financial account schemes together do not reach a minimum level by age 65, and the individual chooses to retire at this age, benefits from these systems will be supplemented up to the guarantee level, determined by Parliament and financed with a state <b>budget</b> <b>transfer.</b> This reflects the fact that the PAYG NDC and financial account schemes are designed to function autonomously from social policy. Life expectancy is factored into the NDC annuity, and together with the financial account system, this innovation helps to shift the risk of an aging society onto workers while they are still active. There is no maximum retirement age, and the system offers a broad range of options for labor-force exit for older workers. Full, partial or no earnings from work can be combined freely with full or partial annuities from {{one or both of the}} public schemes from the minimum pension age of 61...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1991 Governments in less {{developed}} countries have recognized {{in recent years the}} need to liberalize economic policies in order to increase efficiency in agricultural commodity markets. In an attempt to help decision makers assess alternative choices, most policy studies, however, have focused on the efficiency norm criterion without much consideration for social preferences. A result is that some policies identified as desirable are politically infeasible. The objective of the present study is to develop and apply a model explaining government behavior in setting agricultural price policies. It is assumed that government maximizes a policy preference function whose arguments are the welfares of interest groups affected by government policies. An interest group's well-being is represented by its utility rather than by the more commonly used, but theoretically deficient, consumer/producer surplus or money metric measures. The model is applied to the Tunisian wheat sector. The econometric revealed preference approach is used to estimate a Tunisian wheat policy preference function (PPF) and to derive social weights reflecting the distributional goals of the policy-making process. The bootstrap technique is employed to assess statistical reliability of these weights and to permit hypothesis testing. Empirical results confirm and quantify a strong consumer bias in Tunisian price policy. The Tunisian government is willing to transfer one util's worth of its budget to increase consumer welfare by 0. 076 util, whereas it will make the same one util's worth of <b>budget</b> <b>transfer</b> only if it generates a 5. 2 util increase in producer welfare. Analysis based on the policy framework proposed here shows that, because efficient policy reforms are inconsistent with decision makers' preferences, they are likely to rejected in favor of the current policies. Successful policy reform therefore should be accompanied by institutional reforms that alter relative bargaining powers in the policy process and hence change the PPF weights...|$|E
40|$|The path to Turkey-EU {{integration}} has {{not been}} a straightforward one. It has historical, cultural and political as well as economic dimensions. Within this wide spectrum, the purpose of this thesis is to analyze the implications of integrating Turkey 2 ̆ 7 s agricultural sector with that of the EU. As the first study to investigate the implications of extending the CU to include agriculture in a multi-sector, multi-region general equilibrium framework, this thesis addresses some of the key issues such as welfare effects, sectoral reallocations, agricultural unskilled labor mobility, revenue replacement and the cost of integration on the EU budget. The results indicate that much of the benefit of agricultural integration for Turkey will be conditional upon the availability of EU <b>budget</b> <b>transfers</b> to cover anticipated production subsidies. As long as EU <b>budget</b> <b>transfers</b> can be ensured, then agricultural integration will be beneficial to Turkey in terms of aggregate welfare. Primary agricultural and food sectors expand in this case, leading to increased employment and export possibilities. However, the implied cost of agricultural integration with full harmonization of protection structure on the EU budget is nontrivial: 9. 6 billion (in 1995 US). When the EU <b>budget</b> <b>transfers</b> are disregarded, then the benefits of agricultural integration vanish. Both unilateral agricultural liberalization by Turkey on a Most Favored Nation Basis and multilateral liberalization by all regions as alternative policy options are more favorable than agricultural integration with the EU in the absence of <b>budget</b> <b>transfers.</b> This thesis also explores the implications of alternative assumptions about unskilled labor mobility and revenue replacement. The results indicate that unskilled labor mobility will be essential in determining the impact of trade policy reforms. As far as the implications of agricultural integration on government finance is concerned, the results indicate that Turkey has to increase value-added taxes by one-quarter in order to compensate for tariff revenue loss due to integration when production subsidies are not covered by the EU. This will negatively affect the projected welfare gains. ...|$|R

40|$|Subsidies {{funded by}} Russia's {{regional}} governments represented about 5. 2 percent of GDP in 1995, almost triple the 2 percent of GDP in subsidies {{funded by the}} federal government. Regional policies vary greatly, influenced more by local factors than by the federal government. To find out what affects the regional governments'propensity to subsidize, the authors examined available data for 1992 - 95, asking: How great is the variation across regions {{in the incidence of}} subsidies, and what are recent trends in such variation? What are the relative influences of supply and demand factors in shaping the current levels of subsidy? How do federal <b>budget</b> <b>transfers</b> affect regionally funded subsidies to local enterprises? To what extent are federal transfers distortionary, encouraging subsidies and postphoning the liberalization of local markets? Their findings: 1) Regional wealth and federal <b>budget</b> <b>transfers</b> to regional governments are two of the most important determinants of regional propensity to subsidize. 2) Even when regional budgetary wealth is controlled for, depressed regions (those affected most by industrial decline and unemployment) tend to spend less on subsidies than regions with more favorable economies. 3) Federal <b>budget</b> <b>transfers</b> are quite distortionary, that is, they encourage regional governments to continue subsidy policies and postpone structural reforms. In fact, federal transfers tend to be concerned in regions with the most distortionary policies. 4) Housing receives the lion's share of total regional subsidies, and there are greater disparities in housing subsidies than in agricultural subsidies. 5) Housing and transportation subsidies are strongly counter-equalizing: Households in wealthier regions receive more in housing subsidies and rural populations have less access to those subsidies, so up to 30 percent of regional subsidies are questionable in terms of equity. 6) Federal transfers have less effect on regional subsidies in agriculture, which are influenced more by the region's own tax base and its share of rural population or by such factors as the political influence of local interest groups. 7) To accelerate structural reforms, the federal government might consider reducing the number of recipients of federal <b>budget</b> <b>transfers</b> and changing the rules of allocation of the transfers, in particular by introducing conditional transfers linked to increases in cost recovery.

Consequently, rural road construction has become a priority for the main village and district authorities, in other words the Village Development Committees (VDCs) and the District Development Committees (DDCs) (World Bank, 2013). Many communities are collecting their own funds to rent bulldozers and build rural roads without proper technical and geological expertise (Das Mulmi, 2009). The road construction boom and lack of enforcement of government regulations has led to a low quality Nepal rural network, with roads which often do not provide year round access (World Bank, 2013). Slope cut during rural earthen roads construction certainly affect the frequency of shallow and in some cases larger landslides and local soil erosion/deposition processes, although the exact percentage of road induced shallow landslides is unknown (Fort et al., 2010; Furniss et al., 1991).
