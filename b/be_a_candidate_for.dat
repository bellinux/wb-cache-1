5|$|UConn {{head coach}} Randy Edsall, {{who had been}} with the Huskies since 1999, was also rumored to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>candidate</b> <b>for</b> the Syracuse job. Edsall, a Syracuse alumnus, denied any interest. Offensive {{coordinator}} Rob Ambrose accepted the head coaching position at Towson, his alma mater; he would stay to coach UConn during the bowl game, however.|$|E
5|$|The {{election}} of 1796 {{was the first}} contested American presidential election. Twice, George Washington had been elected to office unanimously; however, during his presidency, deep philosophical {{differences between the two}} leading figures in the administration – Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson – regarding domestic economic policy and U.S. foreign policy caused a rift between them, and led to the founding of the Federalist Party and the Democratic-Republican Party. Thus, when Washington announced that he would not <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>candidate</b> <b>for</b> a third term, an intense partisan struggle for control of Congress and the presidency began.|$|E

When Andrew Petie retired at the 1926 election, Jenkinson again <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>candidate</b> <b>for</b> Toombul but <b>was</b> defeated by Hugh Russell. Undeterred, Jenkinson <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>candidate</b> <b>for</b> Toombul in the 1929 election but was again defeated by Hugh Russell.|$|R
50|$|DeMaio <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>candidate</b> <b>for</b> Mayor of San Diego in the 2012 election, {{but lost}} to former congressman Bob Filner.

5|$|There {{had been}} {{speculation}} since May 1899 {{that he would}} <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>candidate</b> <b>for</b> office in the new territorial government. In November 1900 election White {{was elected to the}} inaugural Territorial legislature, established under the Hawaiian Organic Act, as a senator from the Second District (corresponding to Maui, Molokaʻi. Lānaʻi, and Kahoʻolawe). During this term, his brother-in-law, Joseph Apukai Akina, would serve as Speaker of the House of Representatives while his son-in-law David Kalei Kahaulelio served as sergeant-at-arm of the Senate.|$|E
5|$|Despite being a {{game that}} used a {{graphical}} display, the cathode-ray tube amusement device is generally not considered under most definitions to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>candidate</b> <b>for</b> the first video game, as it used purely analog hardware and did not run on a computing device; some loose definitions may still consider it a video game, {{but it is still}} usually disqualified as the device was never manufactured. Nevertheless, it is the earliest known interactive electronic game as well as the first to incorporate an electronic display, thus making it a forerunner to other games in the early history of video games. As the device was never manufactured or widely shown, however, it did not directly inspire any other games and had no impact on the future video game industry.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{election}} loss Dosanjh returned to practicing law {{and let his}} party membership lapse. There had been speculation dating back to October 2002 that Dosanjh was interested in joining the Liberal Party of Canada. New Democratic Party leader Jack Layton approached Dosanjh in 2003 {{to see if he}} was interested in running as a federal candidate but Dosanjh refused. In March 2004, with a federal election expected in the spring or summer, Prime Minister Paul Martin approached Dosanjh to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>candidate</b> <b>for</b> the Liberal Party of Canada. Dosanjh agreed and Martin appointed him to Vancouver South over two other nomination candidates while announcing Dosanjh as part of a team of BC star candidates along with economist David Emerson, union leader Dave Haggard, community activist Shirley Chan and Liberal party organizer Bill Cunningham. The advertising of Dosanjh emphasized the party's socially progressive aspect. In the June election Dosanjh won his riding with 44.5% of the vote.|$|E

5|$|From 1977 to 1983, Ford was {{a member}} of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. He first sought the post of Democratic whip in 1988, but lost to California's Alan Cranston, who had held the post since 1977. Ford got a late start in the race, and a New York Times writer opined that he {{overestimated}} his chances of unseating Cranston. Immediately after conceding his loss, he announced he would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>candidate</b> <b>for</b> the position in the next election in 1990. He again faced Cranston in the election, but Cranston withdrew from the race due to a battle with prostate cancer. Ford maintained that he had enough commitments of support in the Democratic caucus to have won without Cranston's withdrawal. When majority leader George J. Mitchell retired from the Senate in 1994, Ford showed some interest in the Democratic floor leader post. Ultimately, he decided against it, choosing to focus instead on Kentucky issues. He supported Christopher Dodd for majority leader.|$|E
5|$|He was {{appointed}} {{as the military}} secretary to Sir John Byng, the Commander-in-Chief, Ireland, and in July 1831 became the State Secretary to the Marquess of Anglesey, the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. He was promoted to colonel on 22 July 1830. In 1834 he became the Inspector-General of Police in Ulster, but was passed over for the position of Inspector-General of the Irish constabulary in 1836; the possibility of his appointment to the latter post had caused some concern among Irish Tories, who felt he was too critical of the Orange Order. He was later rumoured to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>candidate</b> <b>for</b> the governorship of Dominica, in the West Indies, though this post {{does not seem to}} have materialised. In 1838 he was ordered to Canada to act as adjutant-general for the force garrisoned there after the Rebellions of 1837. When Lord Hill was retiring from the post of Commander-in-Chief of the Forces in 1839, Anglesey was suggested as a replacement to succeed him, although he eventually turned down the job; had he taken it up, Stovin was widely expected to become his personal secretary, the same capacity he had served in Dublin.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the final}} week of the regular season, it {{appeared}} that circumstances might indeed throw that plan into confusion. North Carolina, the ACC's second-place team, had risen to No. 5 in the USA Today Coaches Poll and No. 7 in the Associated Press college football poll, and was considered to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>candidate</b> <b>for</b> an at-large Bowl Alliance selection. If North Carolina was selected for a higher-tier bowl game, the door would be opened for Notre Dame {{to play in the}} 1998 Gator Bowl—a circumstance provided for if neither the first nor second-place ACC team was available to play. In the end, however, ACC runner-up North Carolina was bypassed by Bowl Alliance officials, leaving the team available for the Gator Bowl. Facing the Tar Heels were the Virginia Tech Hokies, second-place finishers in the Big East Conference. Gator Bowl officials considered inviting Big East third-place West Virginia due to its reputation for bringing large numbers of fans to bowl games, but decided against inviting the Mountaineers out of recognition that North Carolina and West Virginia played each other in the 1997 Gator Bowl.|$|E

5|$|The {{launch of}} the ZX81 was catalysed {{in part by the}} British Broadcasting Corporation's plan to produce a TV series, to be {{broadcast}} in 1982, aimed at popularising computing and programming. The BBC intended to commission an existing manufacturer to provide it with a BBC-branded home computer to tie in with the series. When Sinclair got wind of the project in December 1980, he wrote to the BBC informing them that he would be announcing {{a new version of the}} ZX80, to be called the ZX81, in early 1981. It would remedy some of the ZX80's deficiencies and would be both cheaper and more advanced. Sinclair naturally wanted the ZX81 to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>candidate</b> <b>for</b> the BBC contract and lobbied for its adoption. He pointed out that there were already 40,000 users of the ZX80 and that by the time the series was broadcast there were likely to be upwards of 100,000 ZX81 users (which turned out to be an underestimate by over 400,000 – an indication of how the ZX81's success exceeded even Sinclair's expectations).|$|E
5|$|When New York's long-serving U.S. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan {{announced}} his retirement in November 1998, several prominent Democratic figures, including Representative Charles Rangel of New York, urged Clinton to run for Moynihan's open seat in the Senate election of 2000. Once she decided to run, the Clintons purchased a home in Chappaqua, New York, north of New York City, in September 1999. She became the first First Lady of the United States to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>candidate</b> <b>for</b> elected office. Initially, Clinton expected to face Rudy Giuliani (the mayor of New York City) as her Republican opponent in the election. Giuliani withdrew from the race in May 2000 after {{he was diagnosed with}} prostate cancer and matters related to his failing marriage became public and Clinton instead faced Rick Lazio, a Republican member of the U.S. House of Representatives representing New York's 2nd congressional district. Throughout the campaign, opponents accused Clinton of carpetbagging, as she had never resided in New York nor participated in the state's politics before the 2000 Senate race.|$|E
