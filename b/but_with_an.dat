5|$|Stroud began {{serving a}} 17-year term at Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary on December 19, 1942, and became inmate #594. In 1943, he was {{assessed}} by psychiatrist Romney M. Ritchey, who diagnosed him as a psychopath, <b>but</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> I.Q. of 134. Stripped of his birds and equipment, he wrote {{a history of the}} penal system.|$|E
5|$|The {{inception}} of matrix mechanics by Heisenberg, Born and Jordan led to studying matrices with infinitely many rows and columns. Later, von Neumann {{carried out the}} mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics, by further developing functional analytic notions such as linear operators on Hilbert spaces, which, very roughly speaking, correspond to Euclidean space, <b>but</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> infinity of independent directions.|$|E

5|$|A Faraday filter, {{magneto-optical}} filter, FADOF or EFADOF (Excited Faraday Dispersive Optical Filter) {{works by}} rotating the polarization {{of the light}} passing through the vapor cell. This rotation occurs near its atomic absorption lines by the Faraday effect and anomalous dispersion. Only light at the resonant frequency of the vapor is rotated and the polarized plates block other electromagnetic radiation. This effect is related to and enhanced by the Zeeman Effect, or the splitting of atomic absorption lines {{in the presence of}} the magnetic field. Light at the resonant frequency of the vapor exits a FADOF near its original strength <b>but</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> orthogonal polarization.|$|E
5|$|Bach {{structured}} the cantata {{in seven}} movements, {{beginning with a}} chorale fantasia and ending in a closing chorale, as usually in his chorale cantatas, <b>but</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> unusual sequence of only one recitative and four arias, setting the poetic hymn stanzas. He scored it for three vocal soloists (soprano (S), tenor (T) and bass) (B), a four-part choir, and a Baroque chamber ensemble of corno da caccia (Co) to support the chorale tune in the outer movements, two flauti traversi (Ft), two oboes d'amore (Oa), two violins (Vl), two violas (Va) and basso continuo (Bc).|$|E
5|$|By 1799, the {{original}} house at Luscombe had been demolished, and work began {{on a new}} house for Hoare in 1800. The house was designed by John Nash, who was a pioneer for the Gothic Revival style. In his early drawings for the house, Repton suggested two sketches to Hoare; one of a more standard house, {{and the other with}} the more natural design which would settle into the landscape. The latter was chosen and the final design of the house was based upon Downton Castle, <b>but</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> asymmetrical plan to experience the panoramic views around the house. It was Nash's first attempt at a Gothic castle design and he would subsequently create several further houses in the same style.|$|E

5|$|Concern {{with the}} harm of {{separation}} from the mother is characteristic of the belief systems behind some complementary and alternative (CAM) psychotherapies. Such belief systems are concerned {{not only with the}} effect of the young child's {{separation from the}} care of the mother, <b>but</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> emotional attachment between mother and child which advocates of these systems believe to develop prenatally. Such attachment is said to lead to emotional trauma if the child is separated from the birth mother and adopted, even if this occurs on the day of birth and even if the adoptive family provides all possible love and care. These beliefs were at one time in existence among some legitimate psychologists of psychoanalytic background. Today, however, beliefs in prenatal communication between mothers and infants are largely confined to unconventional thinkers such as William Emerson.|$|E
5|$|Ermac {{was played}} by actor John Turk in the {{digitized}} games Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 and the 1996 compilation title Mortal Kombat Trilogy. As a palette-swapped character, he was physically {{identical to the}} Mortal Kombat games' other male ninjas, save for his red coloring. For Mortal Kombat: Deception, which marked Ermac's return to the series as a playable character after an eight-year absence, {{he was given a}} distinct redesign by Steve Beran, the series' lead character designer and art director. Beran explained that his objective of remaking old characters was to greatly differentiate them from their previous incarnations. His Deception design was maintained for the 2011 reboot game, <b>but</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> increased black palette.|$|E
5|$|Guèye had {{arranged}} {{for the creation of}} the Senegalese Ski Federation in 1979, and had initially expected to be unable to compete at the 1984 Olympics due to the qualification requirements and as he was recovering from an injury, but was informed by the International Olympic Committee several months prior that he would be allowed to represent Senegal. Guèye was the first black African to compete at the Winter Games; South Africa became the first African nation to compete at a Winter Games, in 1960, <b>but</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> all-white team under apartheid.|$|E

5|$|In February 2008, new {{executive}} producer, Susan Bower, {{announced that}} she would be implementing further changes to the programme. Bower promised to retain the return to traditional Neighbours values, <b>but</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> injection of drama that remains recognisable and relevant. Ratings rose to almost 900,000 in mid-2008, but generally ratings begin to fall towards the end of each year, usually averaging around 700,000. On 17 July 2009, during the aftermath of the Parker family's car accident and the dramatic death of Bridget Parker (Eloise Mignon), Neighbours achieved higher ratings than Home And Away. Neighbours achieved 998,000 viewers and placed 6th for the night, Home And Away placed 7th.|$|E
5|$|On January 26, 2017, Feldman {{signed a}} one-year, $2.3 million {{contract}} with the Cincinnati Reds. Feldman was originally assigned to pitch out of the bullpen, <b>but</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> injury to Homer Bailey, Feldman was {{given a chance to}} audition for the Reds' rotation. The preparation for the Reds' rotation made Feldman withdraw from Israel's national baseball team during the 2017 World Baseball Classic. On March 20, Feldman was named the Reds' Opening Day starter. Having started Opening Day for the Rangers in 2010 and the Astros in 2014, he became the 52nd pitcher to start Opening Day for at least three major league teams.|$|E
5|$|The Admiralty Board also {{considered}} Brilliant too lightly armed for her size. She measured an additional 50 tons burthen over a standard 32-gun frigate but carried only four more cannon. For these reasons, Brilliant {{was the last}} vessel {{to be built in}} the Venus-class. Subsequent generations of Royal Navy frigates preserved elements of her design, <b>but</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> extended hull to allow for additional gun ports and the carrying of larger weapons including the 18-pounder long gun.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} season, Ginóbili {{was injured}} {{for most of}} the campaign, managing only 44 regular season games and missing the 2009 NBA Playoffs entirely. San Antonio qualified for the playoffs as the third seed with a 54–28 record, <b>but</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> aging supporting cast (Bowen, Michael Finley and Kurt Thomas were all in their late 30s), the Spurs were only considered fringe contenders for the championship. As it turned out, the strong play of Duncan and Tony Parker were not enough to help the Spurs avoid a 4–1 defeat by Dallas, and the Spurs were eliminated {{in the first round of}} the playoffs for the first time since 2000.|$|E
5|$|The {{road was}} {{originally}} built with two lanes in each direction, <b>but</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> unusually wide central reservation {{to accommodate a}} third lane to be added each way at a later date. The work was a compromise between the Ministry of Transport and Drake, the latter who thought two lanes would not be adequate. Initially, the shoulders were hardened with gravel but not paved, a fact still reflected in the British term hard shoulder. A hedge was planted {{along the length of}} the central reservation to help reduce dazzle from the headlights of oncoming traffic at night. The road was constructed to not be a long length of straight road and with the addition of various bridges and tree planting, in the hope to prevent driver boredom reported on foreign motorways.|$|E

5|$|This was Chopra's first action role, and she {{was excited}} to the part, so {{she wanted to do}} all the stunts by herself. After Chopra decided to perform her own stunts, Akhtar {{revealed}} that he was happy as it gave him the scope to film the fight sequences from different angles. Rampal, in the role of Jasjit, said that he approached his character in a way similar to how Pran had played it in the original <b>but</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> emotional graph. Boman Irani, who plays DCP DeSilva, a role performed by Iftekhar in the original film, revealed that he played the role according to what suited the script, but retained some of the dignity from that film.|$|E
5|$|U-10 was {{the first}} ship of the class {{launched}}, as the German UB-1 on 22 January 1915. The other four boats were launched by April. UB-1 and UB-15 were initially commissioned into the Kaiserliche Marine in January and April, respectively, each with German commanders and crew, <b>but</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> Austro-Hungarian Navy officer for piloting and training purposes, but both were commissioned into the K.u.K.
