5|$|A {{successful}} {{test for}} beryllium in air and on surfaces has <b>been</b> <b>recently</b> developed and published {{as an international}} voluntary consensus standard ASTM D7202. The procedure uses dilute ammonium bifluoride for dissolution and fluorescence detection with beryllium bound to sulfonated hydroxybenzoquinoline, allowing up to 100 times more sensitive detection than the recommended limit for beryllium concentration in the workplace. Fluorescence increases with increasing beryllium concentration. The new procedure has been successfully tested {{on a variety of}} surfaces and is effective for the dissolution and ultratrace detection of refractory beryllium oxide and siliceous beryllium (ASTM D7458).|$|E
5|$|Deposits {{recording}} the last 14,000years at Mount Baker indicate that Mount Baker {{has not had}} highly explosive eruptions like those of other volcanoes in the Cascade Volcanic Arc, such as Mount St. Helens, Mount Meager or Glacier Peak, nor has it erupted frequently. During this period, four episodes of magmatic eruptive activity have <b>been</b> <b>recently</b> recognized.|$|E

5|$|Formerly {{the site}} hosted eleven {{different}} residential halls and pavilions; in 2012 only three are left, {{although they have}} been completely reconstructed: The Chakri Maha Prasat Throne Hall, the Moon Satharn Borom Ard Hall and the Sommuthi Thevaraj Uppabat Hall. Behind these structures lie the grand Borom Ratchasathit Mahoran Hall, which has <b>been</b> <b>recently</b> rebuilt. None of the rooms {{are open to the}} public, as state functions are still carried out within. The changing of the guards occurs at the front courtyard every two hours.|$|E
5|$|Hydnellum fungi are mycorrhizal, and {{are usually}} found in {{coniferous}} and mixed woods. Favored tree hosts include members of the Fagaceae and the Pinaceae. The genus is widely distributed in the Northern Hemisphere, particularly Europe and North America, but some species are also found in tropical Asia. Harrison identified a dozen new species from North America in the 1960s. Rudolph Arnold Maas Geesteranus recognized 16 European species in his 1975 treatment of the genus, to which H. dianthifolium has <b>been</b> <b>recently</b> added by Loizides and colleagues.|$|E

5|$|In French drawings, Vengeur {{is often}} {{depicted}} as flying the Tricolour, which had <b>been</b> <b>recently</b> {{ordered by the}} Convention to be flown as battle ensign; however, {{due to a lack}} of bunting in Brest, Villaret had not been able to distribute this flag to all his ships, and thus Vengeur probably still flew the white flag with a canton of three equal columns of red, white, and blue.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{remaining}} areas {{of what is now}} the state were purchased in 1803 from France as part of the Louisiana Purchase (the area west of the Mississippi having <b>been</b> <b>recently</b> acquired by France from Spain).

The exact definition of the boundary between Minnesota and British North America was not addressed until the Anglo-American Convention of 1818.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} {{starting point}} of the A82 in Glasgow was at Trongate. It proceeded to run westwards along Argyle Street and Dumbarton Road to Dumbarton via Clydebank. On 16 May 1934, the road was rerouted to run along Buchanan Street, New City Road and Great Western Road, whose westward extension from Anniesland Cross had <b>been</b> <b>recently</b> completed. The route between Glasgow and Dumbarton has since broadly remained the same, aside from the declassification of the route {{to the south of}} the M8 when that motorway was constructed.|$|E
