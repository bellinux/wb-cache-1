5|$|At Hanford, {{plutonium}} production {{fell off}} as Reactors B, D and F wore out, poisoned by fission products and {{swelling of the}} graphite moderator known as the Wigner effect. The swelling damaged the charging tubes where the uranium was irradiated to produce plutonium, rendering them unusable. In {{order to maintain the}} supply of polonium for the urchin initiators, production was curtailed and the oldest unit, B pile, was closed down so at least one reactor would <b>be</b> <b>available</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> future. Research continued, with DuPont and the Metallurgical Laboratory developing a redox solvent extraction process as an alternative plutonium extraction technique to the bismuth phosphate process, which left unspent uranium in a state from which it could not easily be recovered.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, recent studies show an {{increasingly}} positive attitude {{of patients and}} physicians (M.D. and D.O.) towards the use of manual therapy as a valid, safe and effective treatment modality. One survey, published in the Journal of Continuing Medical Education, found {{that a majority of}} physicians (81%) and patients (76%) felt that manual manipulation (MM) was safe, and over half (56% of physicians and 59% of patients) felt that manipulation should <b>be</b> <b>available</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> primary care setting. Although less than half (40%) of the physicians reported any educational exposure to MM and less than one-quarter (20%) have administered MM in their practice, most (71%) respondents endorsed desiring more instruction in MM. Another small study examined the interest and ability of M.D. residents in learning osteopathic principles and skills, including OMT. It showed that after a 1-month elective rotation, the M.D. residents responded favorably to the experience.|$|E
5|$|Sir Nigel Gresley's {{independent}} {{report on}} the Kand K1classes during the mainline stability trials stated that they were well designed, mechanically reliable and capable of hauling expresses at high speeds on well-maintained track, which meant {{that they could have}} been useful additions to the Southern Railway's suburban commuter fleet. However, they were undoubtedly prone to rough riding and instability, and not only on the poorest quality tracks. The restricted water capacity also limited their use outside the Southern Railway's Central section. The impending electrification of the Brighton Main Line, scheduled for 1932 also meant that fewer duties suitable for heavy passenger tank locomotives would <b>be</b> <b>available</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1930s. The lack of a suitable role for both classes was considered when {{the decision was made to}} rebuild them as U/U1 tender engines following the Sevenoaks disaster. In rebuilt form they continued to operate until the 1960s, and were capable of attaining speeds in excess of 70mph (110km/h) with a greater degree of stability.|$|E

5|$|The StarCraft II Editor is a campaign, map, and mod editor. It is {{far more}} {{sophisticated}} than StarCrafts StarEdit and s World Editor for creating custom maps and campaigns, {{and it is the}} first editor by Blizzard to feature built-in mod creation and usage support. Updated art and data from the original StarCraft that were not used, along with models and data that were scrapped during the development process (including those made as April Fools jokes) will <b>be</b> <b>available</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> editor. Unlike previous editors made by Blizzard, it is the first to have Internet connectivity features such as map publishing, retrieval, and online activation of the editor client. Lead producer Chris Sigaty has stated that the editor gives players the ability to create role-playing, Hero-type units and structures resembling those from WarCraft III. At BlizzCon 2009, Blizzard demonstrated a build of the StarCraft II Editor showcasing its capabilities, such as the ability to customize the user interface to include features such as the Item system from Warcraft III. The final build includes a third-person style perspective for missions.|$|E
5|$|Wooten {{initially}} {{wanted a}} night landing, {{which would give}} tactical surprise and maximise the time for unloading the landing ships before Japanese aircraft put in an appearance; {{but there would be}} no moon on 4 September, so Barbey was uncertain that {{he would be able to}} correctly locate the beaches. H-Hour was therefore set at 06:30, which was twenty minutes after sunrise. Because the air force had commitments to support the 7th Division's landing at Nadzab the following day, air cover would not <b>be</b> <b>available</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> afternoon. Barbey therefore wanted the ships to depart at 11:00. This raised the question of whether the ships could be unloaded in just 4½ hours. Barbey gave assurances that unloading would continue even under Japanese air attack. For Australian officers with memories of the Tobruk Ferry Service, where the Royal Navy and Royal Australian Navy had lost 25 ships keeping the port's garrison supplied, the US Navy's attitude was not good enough.|$|E

Increasing black liquor dry solids is especially helpful since the recovery boiler capacity is often limited by the flue gas flow.|$|E
