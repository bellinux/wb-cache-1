50|$|The Eurasian {{sparrowhawk}} is {{a predator}} of great tits, {{with the young}} from second broods being at higher risk {{partly because of the}} hawk's greater need for food for its own developing young. The nests of great tits are raided by great spotted woodpeckers, particularly when nesting in certain types of nest boxes. Other nest predators include introduced grey squirrels (in Britain) and least weasels, which are able to take nesting adults as well. A species of <b>biting</b> <b>louse</b> (Mallophaga) described as Rostrinirmus hudeci was isolated and described in 1981 from great tits in central Europe. The hen flea Ceratophyllus gallinae is exceedingly common in the nests of blue and great tits. It was originally a specialist tit flea, but the dry, crowded conditions of chicken runs enabled it to flourish with its new host. This flea is preferentially predated by the clown beetle Gnathoncus punctulatus, The rove beetle Microglotta pulla also feeds on fleas and their larvae. Although these beetles often remain in deserted nests, they can only breed in the elevated temperatures produced by brooding birds, tits being the preferred hosts.|$|E

40|$|The sheep <b>biting</b> <b>louse,</b> Bovicola ovis (Schrank), is an {{economically}} important, worldwide ectoparasite of sheep. In Australia, up to 30 % of sheep flocks are infested with lice. The usual {{method of control}} has been synthetic pyrethroids applied as pour-on {{along the back of}} the sheep, but treatment failures have become widespread since 1985 because of the development of resistance. We used allozyme markers to study the distribution of genetic variation within and among populations of lice on different farms in Western Australia. Genetic variation within populations was similar to previously reported values for other ectoparasitic arthropods. Heterozygote deficiencies were found at 1 locus in a number of population and another 2 loci in 1 other population. However, another variable locus conformed to Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and there was little evidence of extensive linkage disequilibrium between loci. Further studies are necessary to establish the breeding system. Genetic differences among populations were not related to geographic separation, which is consistent with an island model of population structure. A small but significant proportion (2. 8 %) of the total genetic variation was distributed among populations' equivalent under the island model to a gene flow of 8. 7 individuals exchanged per generation. The implications of this result are discussed in terms of controlling and managing synthetic pyrethroid resistance in sheep biting lice...|$|E

Symptomatic scratching by the host aggravates these conditions. High infestations may lead to decreased population numbers. Live lice were collected from a blesbuck in the Rietvlei Nature Reserve and prepared for selectron microscopic investigation. Micrographs were recorded. The SEM investigation revealed several micromorphological features not previously described in D. crenelata. Besides the obvious anatomical differences in the reproductive organs of the male and female, several other differences were noted. The antennal flagellae showed morphological differences as well as certain features on the ventral surfaces of the head. Dorsally the forehead was markedly emarginated and showed an acute invagination (clypeo labral suture) in the pulvinal area. The ventral surface of the head clearly demonstrated the structures of the preantennal regions such as ventral carina, pulvinus, labrum, mandibles and clypeus. The epipharynx appeared as an underlying extension of the labrum. The rims of the clypeus were more raised and thickened in the female than in that of the male. The mandibles were not notched and were noted to be angular in shape. The three segments {{of each of the}} antennae of the male were thicker and more robust than than those of the female.

Methods Groups of collar-treated dogs (n[*]=[*] 7 – 10) were infested with fleas and/or ticks at monthly intervals at least, {{over a period of}} up to 8 [*]months. Efficacy against fleas was evaluated 24 to 48 [*]h after treatment and 24 [*]h after each re-infestation. Efficacy against ticks was evaluated at 48 [*]h (acaricidal), 6 [*]h (repellent) and 48 [*]h (sustained) after infestation. The effect of regular shampooing or immersion in water on the efficacy of the collars was also tested. Efficacy against flea larvae was assessed by incubating blanket samples after dog contact with viable flea eggs. Effectiveness against lice and mites was evaluated after treatment of naturally infested animals. With the exception of the mites, efficacy was calculated by comparison with untreated negative control groups. Results Efficacy against fleas (24 [*]h) generally exceeded 95 %, and against flea larvae it exceeded 99 % for 8 [*]months. Sustained acaricidal (48 [*]h) efficacy, covering a period of 8 [*]months was 100 % against I. ricinus, starting 2 [*]days after treatment (in vivo), and 100 % against I. scapularis (in vitro), above 97 % against R. sanguineus, generally above 97 % against D. reticulatus and above 90 % for D. variabilis. Repellent (6 [*]h) efficacy 2 [*]days after treatment and continuing for 8 [*]months was consistently 100 % against I. ricinus, and above 90 % against R. sanguineus.

Here, we investigate the hypothesis that these findings are due to ectoparasite load being directionally nonuniform, possibly because of nonuniformity in nestbox internal temperature. Nests contained, in order of prevalence, hen fleas (Ceratophyllus gallinae), haematophagous blowflies (Protocalliphora spp.), <b>biting</b> <b>lice</b> (Ischnocera), and ticks/mites (Acari). Although southwest-facing nestboxes were significantly warmer than other boxes, there was no directional difference in total ectoparasite load or abundance of particular species. Similarly, there was no relationship between abundance of any ectoparasite species (either per-nest or per-chick) and avian offspring condition determined using wing length or relative mass. We discuss several possible, nonmutually exclusive, explanations for this, including compensatory responses, costs of parasitism being transferred to parents, and condition-dependent effects...|$|R
5000|$|Commensalism, in biology, is a {{relation}} between individuals of two species {{in which one}} species obtains food or other benefits from the other without either harming or benefiting the latter. The commensal (the species that benefits from the association) may obtain nutrients, shelter, support, or locomotion from the host species, which is substantially unaffected. The commensal relation is often between a larger host and a smaller commensal; the host organism is unmodified, whereas the commensal species may show great structural adaptation consonant with its habits, as in the remoras that ride attached to sharks and other fishes. Both remora and pilot fish feed on the leftovers of their hosts' meals. Numerous birds feed on the insects turned up by grazing mammals, while other birds obtain soil organisms stirred up by the plow. Various <b>biting</b> <b>lice,</b> fleas, and louse flies are commensals in that they feed harmlessly on the feathers of birds and on sloughed-off flakes of skin from mammals ...|$|R
40|$|The {{occurrence}} of seventeen mites {{has been recorded}} apparently {{for the first time}} in South Africa. Cheyletiella parasitivorax has also been included, having been recorded only from Onderstepoort. These mites are apparently widespread over the Union and it is likely that many other species are present. With the exception of Syringophilus bipectinatus and S. columbae, which produce marked distortion and malnutrition of the feathers, all the rest of the mites are apparently harmless as far as setting up lesions are concerned. It is, however, possible that gross infestations may set up "mite worry" in the hosts and so help reduce their vitality, causing debility and anaemia. The claim by other authors, that feather mites damage the barbs of the feathers, has not been confirmed, and it is thought that <b>biting</b> <b>lice</b> are more likely to be the culprits. The articles have been scanned in colour with a HP Scanjet 5590; 300 dpi. Adobe Acrobat XI Pro was used to OCR the text and also for the merging and conversion to the final presentation PDF-format...|$|R
