50|$|A few Batwa own {{very little}} {{agricultural}} land, {{and the least}} productive, (one acre or less per household), in designated locations in hard-to-reach hilly terrain near the forest. The land was obtained from development {{agencies such as the}} Adventist Development and Relief Agency, BMCT (Bwindi Mgahinga Conservation Trust) and AICM (African International Christian Ministry). However, before the declaration of the Echuya as a central government forest reserve, the forest was heavily encroached upon. Up to now, some activities such as wild hunting, collection of honey, mushrooms, water, bamboo for basket making, <b>building</b> <b>poles,</b> making of bee hives and fire wood are being carried out by both Batwa and non-Batwa dominant ethnic communities. Batwa, illegally hunt in the forest due to lack of alternative sources of proteins. The forest is also of cultural importance to the Batwa, who offer religious sacrifices to their gods. Echuya Batwa were never involved nor considered for consultation and compensation when the decision-making process to exclude them from the forest was being taken. As a result, most Batwa became landless with extreme poverty and have been reduced to a life of destitution, living on non-Batwa’s land as squatters. Batwa have been forced to resort to begging, providing cheap manual labor, prostitution and stealing for survival. They can be referred to as marginalized minority people, internally displaced persons or environmental refugees.|$|E
40|$|This study categorizes {{different}} subsistence {{and commercial}} uses {{of resources and}} quantifies the amount of wood used for firewood and <b>building</b> <b>poles</b> within an eastern Tanzanian miombo woodland site. Data from questionnaire surveys were collected from 80 households sampled from two villages. Firewood was used solely at the subsistence level by 96 % of the population. with a per capita consumption of 1. 5 ± 0. 17 (SE) m 3 year- 1, whereas <b>building</b> <b>poles</b> were not only used at subsistence level but were partly commercialised in the informal market Per capita consumption of wood for <b>building</b> <b>poles</b> was 0. 138 ± 0. 01 m 3 year− 1, based on an average house life-span of eight years. Timber and charcoal production were the most commercialised resources. Shifting cultivation, which is undertaken {{in the majority of}} the areas cleared for charcoal, is practiced by 68 % of the population while permanent cropping is practiced by 32 % of the population. Both farming systems predominantly comprise mono-cropping and mixed-cropping of cereals with bean crops. Shifting cultivation changes vegetation structure from woodlands to bushlands because of a short fallow penod of only four years after continuous farming for about six years. Current levels of subsistence use of firewood and poles appear to be sustainable, but levels of shifting cultivation are not. However, selection of favoured species for <b>building</b> <b>poles</b> often leads to over-exploitation, especially when these species are inherently scarce...|$|E

The study confirmed the possibility, of producing endurable amount of A. seyal wood, not infested by A. seyal borer, when felled during April and June using charcoal felling process, and October and January when girdling process was used. The study also revealed that, the moisture content in A. seyal wood has noticeable effect; on the revival of the insect activity i. e.

40|$|The Forests National Corporation (FNC) in Sudan {{face with}} so many {{problems}} in protection and management of Acacia seyal due to malpractices used by noxious nomads and local people in reserved forest. Where illicit felling of trees occurred by nomads in a bit to feed their animals, beside the traditional practices that use for Acacia seyal trees to produce wood products (fire wood, charcoal and <b>building</b> <b>poles)</b> the using of unsound fasion style of Acacia seyal management lead to high loss of revenues beside high cost operational processes used for replanting the felled areas. Therefore the study aimed to improve Acacia seyal management by the determining the effect of felling period and techniques use for managing Acacia seyal. The main objective was {{to test the hypothesis}} that the Acacia seyal has ability to produce second yield of fire wood and <b>building</b> <b>poles</b> from coppicing after 20 years of felling. The study was conducted during the period (1988 - 2009) in Rawashda forest reserve, Gadarif state, eastern Sudan. Four replicates were used. Two types of felling were adopted in each plot, within each period of time (July, October, February and May). Mean yield for specific periods was determined in volume term. The primary information on the yield (Value m 3) of twenty years old coppiced and lopped A. seyal variety seyal was investigated; whereas the proper period and type of felling were determined in the field. The study showed that commercial yield (volume) of A. seyal product is possible from coppiced and lopped trees. The mean volume obtained per tree ranged between 0. 0641 and 0. 0784 m 3 for charcoal felling in May and July respectively and between 0. 0584 and 0. 0703 m 3 for lopping in July and May. However the result will boost the efforts towards management of A. seyal in the future and it can be selected as a systematize process for management, to prevent a losable product and to attain economic commercial yield, with predictable economic sustainability. This result claimed to be the first report that showed and confirmed a tradable product from a 20 years coppiced and lopped Acacia seyal in Sudan.

40|$|Although {{protected}} areas {{have become the}} primary mechanism for biodiversity conservation, their establishment can have long-term impacts on land use, land cover, and livelihoods of people living near them. Where land use and resource extraction is severely limited, local people turn to resource pools outside parks. Kibale National Park in western Uganda is a remnant of a previously larger, mid-altitude forest region surrounded by dense agricultural settlement. We combine remote sensing techniques and household surveys to examine landscape change and fragmentation and the implications for securing rural livelihoods. Forests and wetlands outside the park provide important resources such as fuelwood, <b>building</b> <b>poles,</b> and water, {{but they are also}} problematic for local farmers since crop raids by primates and elephants emanate from these fragments. Our analysis shows that since 1984 forests and wetlands have decreased in size and number and those that remain have become increasingly isolated within the agricultural mosaic. Farmers have adapted to resource shortages and human–wildlife conflict in different ways. Our results suggest that wealth, ethnicity, and distance from the park are important factors in determining responses to these issues...|$|E
3000|$|Solar module is {{considered}} as fundamental power transformation unit of Photovoltaic (PV) generation system. The {{performance of a}} PV array strongly depends on operating environmental conditions such as operating temperature, solar insolation, shading array configuration. Often PV arrays get shadowed fully or partially by passing cloud, <b>building,</b> <b>poles,</b> trees, etc. Under such partial shading conditions, the operation of PV arrays get more complicated {{with more than one}} peak and {{it is very important to}} predict the characteristics to obtain possible maximum power. Furthermore, the mismatch losses and hotspot effects caused by partially shading cannot only affect the output power of solar system also can bring security and reliability problem. However, it is quite expensive and takes much time to get operating output characteristics of PV arrays under non uniform working conditions. Therefore, it is necessary to have a simulation model to study the effect of partial shading on solar PV arrays’ working characteristics. A 100  W solar panel is used as reference. The study also focuses on position of output peak power with varying location of shaded modules, different levels of solar irradiation as well as role of bypass diodes in this system.|$|E

They probably behave like net carbon sinks, but there are only few studies focusing on their carbon exchange with the atmosphere. Here, we have analyzed CO 2 fluxes measured for 17 months by an eddy-covariance system over a degraded woodland in northern Benin. Specially, temporal evolution of the fluxes and their relationships with the main environmental factors were investigated between the seasons. Results: This study shows a clear response of CO 2 absorption to photosynthetic photon flux density (Qp), but it varies according to the seasons. After a significant and long dry period, the ecosystem respiration (R) has increased immedi-ately to the first significant rains. No clear dependency of ecosystem respiration on temperature has been observed. The degraded woodlands are probably the “carbon neutral ” at the annual scale.

40|$|Due to {{the current}} high demand for timber, fuelwood, and <b>building</b> <b>poles</b> and the {{realization}} that tree growing may pay dividends in the short and long term, many farmers are planting trees on their farms. Farmers are increasingly planting eucalyptus {{partly due to the}} fast growth rates of the hybrid clones as well as the opportunity to earn money within a short time. In this paper we report on the profitability of growing eucalyptus hybrid clones in the coastal region, Kenya. Tree growth and cost data was sourced from farmers in Malindi, Kilifi, and Msambweni. Market information was sourced from hardwares in North and South Coast while tree growth models were used to provide average tree sizes at various ages. Results showed that a farmer could make a net income of upto Kshs. 500, 000. 00 (USD 6, 250) in 5 years. Farmers in the South Coast (Kwale and Msambweni) spent more on transport than their counterparts in the North Coast (near Gede-KEFRI). This, added to the fact that trees in the South Coast (Msambweni) grew less compared to those in North Coast meant that farmers in the south made less profits.

40|$|Landscapes {{surrounding}} {{parks in}} most of the developing world, while still containing considerable biodiversity, also have rapidly growing human populations and associated agricultural development. Since the establishment of Kibale National Park first as a Crown Forest Reserve in 1932 and later as a park in 1993 in western Uganda, most access and resource extraction has been prohibited. The park has become nearly a complete island of forested land cover surrounded by intensive small-scale agriculture and some large-scale tea plantations, along with a network of wetland and forest patches. As the population grows outside the park and land becomes more scarce, remaining forests and wetlands are being used more intensively for material resources (e. g., fuelwood, <b>building</b> <b>poles)</b> and converted to other land uses (e. g., pasture, agriculture). This study uses both discrete and continuous data analyses of satellite imagery to examine these diminishing resource bases at the landscape level placing the results within the social context of conservation and parks. Findings reveal that the park boundaries have remained fairly intact whereas, the landscape surrounding the park has become increasingly fragmented. From a landscape perspective, while the park has indeed maintained its forest cover, it has become increasingly islandized with wetland and forest patches in the surrounding landscape becoming smaller in number and size. Those that have survived are now more isolated and even lower productivity than in 1984, which may be a precursor to their eventual loss in this landscape...|$|E

An integrated approach of participatory rural appraisal (PRA), Participatory Resource Valuation (PRV), household survey, group discussions and forest walks were conducted during the months of June to December, 2008 in Mutushet and Kortek Parishes, Kapchorwa District. Using random sampling methods, 120 respondents were selected and interviewed. Ten forest uses were identified with the highest dependence being in the supply of timber for income and domestic <b>building</b> <b>poles,</b> the latter having the highest average annual household value of UGx. 67919 (US$ 37). The forest use most valued in both Mutushet and Koterk was medicine with an average annual household value of UGx. 60, 371 (US$ 33) and UGx. 75, 464 (US$ 42) respectively. The forest provision of medicine, domestic building materials, soil conservation, bush meat, charcoal and timber was more valued in Koterk, while provision of firewood, honey and pasture were more valued in Mutushet. The forest’s provision of food was valued equally in the two areas with an average annual value of UGx. 30, 186 per household. Forest park resources accounted for 55 % of the household income.
