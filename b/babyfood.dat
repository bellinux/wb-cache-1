5000|$|The Arkell Museum is {{a museum}} in Canajoharie, New York that has an {{extensive}} collection of American paintings, primarily from 1860-1940, as well as historical exhibits {{about the history of}} the Mohawk River Valley and of the Beech-Nut <b>babyfood</b> company. The Canjohaarie Library was founded in 1924, and a gallery was added in 1927. The museum was originally built to house copies of European masterpieces and original 19th-century American paintings collected by Bartlett Arkell, then the town's leading industrialist. Susan Finch has written of the museum, [...] "The institution has evolved into more than just an art gallery with a library attached, but an art gallery with a small town attached. The roster of American painters exhibited here is astounding and completely out of scale with what you would expect from a Thruway exit between Albany and Utica." ...|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "Southfields Triangle" [...] is {{a series}} of roads and streets that (somewhat) {{resemble}} a triangle. It covers the area from Standen Road in the south (bordering on the historic Coronation Gardens) up to Granville Road in the north, and Pulborough Road in the west across to Merton Road in the east. The [...] "Southfields Triangle" [...] consists almost entirely of Victorian and Edwardian houses. In 1904, the Frame Foods <b>babyfood</b> company opened its factory in Standen Road. The building is in a distinctive art nouveau style, with green ceramic tiles and the slogan 'Nourish and Flourish' on the exterior. The building is Grade II listed and has been converted into luxury flats. Standen Road was also the home of the Ault & Wiborg printing ink factory, and is the only street in the area where the some homes with south-facing gardens border Coronation Gardens, giving them a calm, rural feel.|$|E
40|$|The {{contamination}} {{levels of}} 16 different Fusarium- and Aspergillus-mycotoxins were chemically determined from randomly selected organic and conventional grain-based products purchased from Finnish and Italian markets. The cytotoxicity {{of the samples}} was analyzed with an in vitro test using feline fetal lung cells. Overall, the concentrations of the mycotoxins studied were low {{in all of the}} samples. Enniatins B and B 1 as well as deoxynivalenol were the most predominant mycotoxins in the samples, being present in 97 %, 97 %, and 90 % of the samples, respectively. The geographical origin or the agricultural practice had no influence on the mycotoxin concentrations of the samples. The <b>babyfoods</b> included in the samples had significantly lower concentrations of mycotoxins than the other products with a mean total mycotoxin content of 47 mug/kg compared with 99 mug/kg for the other kinds of food. All the samples evoked toxicity in the in vitro test, but no correlation between cytotoxicity and the mycotoxin concentrations was observed...|$|R
40|$|Ingestion {{of arsenic}} through {{food and water}} is the main path for this element to enter the human organism. Moreover, arsenic in general, and its {{chemical}} forms in particular, are well known to cause acute and chronic toxicity [1]. Hence, the determination of total arsenic {{is not sufficient to}} assess the risks since the toxicity of this element is highly dependent on its chemical form with inorganic arsenic; arsenite (AsIII) and arsenate (AsV); being more toxic than monomethylarsonic acid (MMA), dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) and Arsenobetaine (AsB). The determination of total arsenic and its species in rice is of special importance since rice forms a major dietary component for many populations. Also rice is included in many <b>babyfoods.</b> Since infants have low body weight they are more exposed to arsenic toxicity than adults. Therefore rice crops intended to be consumed by infants must be carefully monitored for arsenic content. Primarily, the present work was performed with the aim of determining total arsenic content in different varieties of rice samples. A total of 24 samples, from four different locations, were provided by a local manufacturer. Sample preparation included grinding and homogeneizing, followed by acid-assisted microwave digestion. Total arsenic determinations were performed by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). Afterwards, two samples were chosen to develop a method for the determination of arsenic species. The technique used was High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) coupled to ICP-MS. The extraction, using a closed vessel microwave oven, was carried out with phosphoric acid. The chromatographic separation was achieved with an anionic exchange column (HAMILTON PRP-X 100) which allowed detecting and quantifying four species (AsB, DMA, AsIII, AsV). The mobile phase was chosen based on scientific literature and adjusted to laboratory conditions. The obtained results showed that the concentration of arsenic in rice ranged between 115 µg/kg and 611 µg/kg. No apparent relation exists between variety, location and arsenic content. Regarding the speciation study results showed that in these samples 80 % of arsenic was present as DMA and 20 % as inorganic arsenic. [1] S. D’Ilio, M. Alessandrelli, R. Cresti, G. Forte, S.

40|$|The TPA {{network for}} {{technologies}} and partnership in food processing {{was set up}} in 1988 by individuals involved in the development of food processing in the South. It is run by a network secretariat based at GRET, the French research and technology exchange group. The network promotes awareness of small-scale food processing technologies and the exchange of information and knowledge between those concerned: entrepreneurs, support and advisory services, teachers, people working on R&D of equipment. In 1994, TPA extended its operations to include small enterprises. The network operates throughout Africa (Angola, Burundi, Ghana, Kenya, Rwanda, South Africa), and its members are groups, enterprises and individuals involved in research and training, food processing, marketing, and cooperation. A bulletin is produced every 6 months, at present only in French. Its four sections concern production, selling, investment, and innovation. They follow selected themes such as <b>babyfoods</b> or packaging, on which they give technical and financial information, including case studies. Another publication, a network members newsletter, again only in French at present, started in February 1999 on a quarterly schedule. Its news pages cover topical subjects, new books, seminars, training courses, and trade fairs. It also describes various Websites on food processing (small enterprises, products, equipment, and subsectors). For the past year, the technical secretariat has been operating a question-and-answer service on such items as packaging, marketing, product processing, and market outlets, as well as organisations providing technical assistance and support in project design. TPA also has a Website, with links to information by subject and by product as well as to related sites. Another aspect of TPA's networking activities is the development of national network points. At present there are three, in Benin, Madagascar, and Senegal. Each network point collects information on food processing in the country and circulates it within the network. Like all active networks, TPA depends mainly on the voluntary input of its members.

40|$|The {{price premium}} {{associated}} with organic <b>babyfood</b> is estimated by applying a hedonic model to price and characteristic data for <b>babyfood</b> products collected in two cities: Raleigh, North Carolina, and San Jose, California. The price per ounce of <b>babyfood</b> is modeled {{as a function}} of a number of <b>babyfood</b> and store characteristics. The estimated organic price premium is generally equal to 3 cents to 4 cents per ounce. To the extent this premium reflects consumer willingness to pay to reduce pesticide exposures, it could be used to infer values for reduced dietary exposures to pesticide residues for babies. <b>babyfood,</b> hedonic analysis, organic foods, Demand and Price Analysis,...|$|E
40|$|The {{motivation}} behind {{purchases of}} organic foods {{is not necessarily}} straightforward. Some individuals may purchase organic foods for health reasons, while others may do so because {{of concern for the}} environment. The issue is even more complicated when thinking about <b>babyfood.</b> Because of children’s developing systems, parents and other care givers could be more concerned about the effects of pesticides in conventional foods. However, this issue is relatively unexplored.

40|$|Studies that {{estimate}} {{the benefits of}} reduced environmental exposure typically assume that individuals know the true magnitude of the risk reduction. However, the accuracy of risk perception assumptions may be questionable. This issue has not been resolved with respect to adult risk reductions and becomes even more complicated when considering risk reductions to small children. We report results from focus groups with parents of small children regarding their risk perceptions over organic and conventional <b>babyfood.</b> Our results yield surprisingly consistent results between scientific and perceived risks. Previous literature reports a scientific risk reduction estimate of 1. 98 per million, reflecting the reduced risk of death from cancer by avoiding pesticides in foods {{during the first year}} of life. The results from our focus groups show that parents estimate that the median risk reduction ranges from 1 to 8 per million, depending on specific demographic characteristics. Individuals with less than a four-year college degree provide the highest estimates, while women, those with more education and purchasers of organic <b>babyfood</b> provide lower estimates. We use these results to estimate parental willingness to pay for pesticide risk reductions to their children. Results show that parents in our focus groups who purchase organic <b>babyfood</b> express a value of a statistical cancer of approximately $ 9 million. These results provide a lower bound on the estimate for the value of reduced cancer risk from pesticide exposure in the first year of life. risk perceptions, children's health, health valuation, organic foods...|$|E
40|$|A rapid multianalyte-multiclass method {{with little}} sample {{manipulation}} {{has been developed}} for the simultaneous determination of eleven mycotoxins in different food commodities by using ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography coupled to triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (UHPLC/MS/MS). Toxins were extracted from the samples with acetonitrile/water (80 : 20, v/v) 0. 1 % HCOOH and, after a two-fold dilution with water, directly injected into the system. Thanks to the fast high-resolution separation of UHPLC, the eleven mycotoxins were separated by gradient elution in only 4 [*]min. The method has been validated in three food matrices (maize kernels, dry pasta (wheat), and eight-multicereal <b>babyfood</b> (wheat, maize, rice, oat, barley, rye, sorghum, millet)) at four different concentration levels. Satisfactory recoveries were obtained (70 – 110 %) and precision (expressed as relative standard deviation) was typically below 15 % with very few exceptions. Quantification of samples was carried out with matrix-matched standards calibration. The lowest concentration successfully validated in sample was as low as 0. 5 [*]µg/kg for aflatoxins and ochratoxin A in <b>babyfood,</b> and 20 [*]µg/kg {{for the rest of}} the selected mycotoxins in all matrices tested. Deoxynivalenol could be only validated at 200 [*]µg/kg, due the poor sensitivity for this mycotoxin analysis. With only two exceptions (HT- 2 and deoxynivalenol), the limits of detection (LODs), estimated for a signal-to-noise ratio of 3 from the chromatograms of samples spiked at the lowest level validated, varied between 0. 1 and 1 [*]µg/kg in the three food matrices tested. The method was applied to the analysis of different kinds of samples. Positive findings were confirmed by acquiring two transitions (Q quantification, q confirmation) and evaluating the Q/q ratio...|$|E
40|$|Rice bran is {{the most}} {{important}} by-product of rice milling. It is a valuable source of edible oil in most rice producing countries. Rice bran oil is used in <b>babyfood,</b> biscuit, poultry, fish and farm animal feeds. The storage of rice bran without 'heat processing will result in hydrolysis and auto-oxidation of lipids, and to its decreased physicochemical, organoleptic and nutritional quality. Rice bran is rich in carbohydrates, free amino acids, lipids and different enzymes. The enzymes have destructive effects on the quality of rice bran components. Heat processing is an effective method to reduce the microbial and enzymatic activity of bran. This study was carried out using a factorial experiment by completely randomized design with three replications to investigate the effect of heat treatment and storage time on rice bran crude oil properties. The parboiling treatment was effective on the rice kernel strength. The bran produced from parboiled rice milling had lower endosperm components. This type of bran had a lower starch but a higher oil percentage. The results of color of rice bran oil samples determined by Lovibond showed that the oil from parboiled rice bran before and during storage had better color than the other samples. Iodine value of bran oil from parboiled paddy decreased during the storage period. The results from studies on fatty acid composition of oil samples determined by gas chromatography (G. C.) showed that the quantitative trend of fatty acids of the control sample remained the same as that in the rice bran samples with the treatment process...|$|E
40|$|A {{molecular}} method {{based on}} real time PCR {{for the detection}} of the presence of Anisakis spp. and Pseudoterranova spp. parasites in fish fillets and fish- derived food products, such as <b>babyfood,</b> surimi, fish slices, fish sticks and the like, as well as for performing a relative quantification of nematode larvae content, comprises the steps of: - preparing a first amplicon from the ITS-I region specifically able to identify all species belonging to Anisakis and Pseudoterranova species, and a second amplicon able to amplify DNA from any host DNA, such as fish, and from any organic component or foodstuff, said amplicons being located on redundant genomic regions providing more power to detect a PCR product in degraded samples; - testing the primer pairs in the same real time PCR conditions on reference samples made from various mixtures of Anisakid nematodes and fish; - for fish fillets (not products) : quantifying the larval mass in the fish sample by calculation versus a known reference; - for fish fillets and products: calculating the amount of Anisakid DNA versus the amount of total DNA in each sample. A mo lecular method based on real time PCR f or discriminating dif f erent Anis akid species in order to test the geographic provenance of Anisakid-containing f ish, comprises : - aligning the ITS l sequences of dif f erent Anisakid species typical of dif ferent predetermined seas, - designing a real time PCR assay based on detection of sequence variations, - determining whether a fish (and product containing fish) coming from a predetermined sea is contaminated by a given Anisakid species...|$|E
