40|$|At Rottneros {{pulp mill}} {{mechanical}} pulp is bleached with hydrogen peroxide. The changes of bleaching chemicals {{that are used}} for different grades are taken from bleaching tables; however these tables are old {{and need to be}} updated. The purpose of this thesis was to be the basis of new documentation. In this thesis three pulps where studied with the aim to find the optimal bleaching chemical changes (total NaOH/VP-quote) for each pulp. The pulps were taken from the filter before the <b>bleaching</b> <b>tower</b> and the pulps were bleached in the lab. The most important pulp property in this study was the brightness and how that was influenced by the chemical dosages. A fiberline inspection was also done to examine the brightness gain during the process. Finally a study was carried out to examine how freeness affected the brightness for low- and high freeness pulps. The studies showed that reduced chemical consumption was possible to achieve for all pulps studied. For pulp CA 683 a total NaOH/VP-ratio of 0, 8 was suggested, while the ratio were 1, 1 for CA 970 and 0, 7 for CS 770. Lower freeness increased the brightening of the pulp at the same chemical consumption...|$|E
40|$|From {{experimental}} {{simulation of}} the process of high consistency pulp moving in a <b>bleaching</b> <b>tower,</b> the aerated bulk density and packed bulk density were measured and studied by using a self-made experimental system. The scattered experimental data – pressure p, and bulk density difference, which was between packed bulk density and aerated bulk density (ρ-ρ 0) – were fitted by using Matlab software, and some good-fitting regression curves and equations were obtained. The results showed there was a break point W in the regression curves; within the range of pressure between zero and W the relationship between (ρ-ρ 0) and p was a linear function, while for pressure between W and 70000 the relationship was a power function. To effectively meet with the bleaching response for the different kinds and different consistencies of pulp in the tower, by using the fitting regression equations combined with the expressions of average bulk density and pressure in the tower caused by gravity-driven pulp, two equations for average packed density ρa were deduced with the aim of deciding the maximum volume value of the tower, in agreement with the sizes of the towers presently used by major companies...|$|E

2500|$|The Scourge: a catastrophic, ancient {{power of}} unknown origin that {{was present at}} the first emergence/evolution of the Seerkind. When they left their mutual garden home it reacted to their {{abandonment}} violently and slew them by the hundreds if not thousands. When its quarry vanished from sight into the rug, the Scourge returned to their ancestral garden to stand guard over the rest of time. In its lonely watch the Scourge slowly succumbed to madness forgetting itself, its duty and the Seerkind as well (although Immacolata given her great power could still sense its dormancy and inevitable re-awakening much to her terror). Secluded in time, when its garden (which is situated in a vast desert wasteland) is discovered by human explorers it learns from them the story of Genesis and after killing them takes its home for the garden of Eden and sees itself as an avenging angel; Uriel. Physically the Scourge (when not controlling a human host) is described as indefinite and full of paradoxes, genderless and at once dark and <b>bleached,</b> <b>towering</b> and infinitesimal and always surrounded by a smothering fog. Its only physical qualities, if any are innumerable eyes that rotate seemingly on wheels of fire throughout its shapeless form, indeed Barker attributes The Scourge to a being of geometries and fire rather than a corporeal entity.|$|R
40|$|A new, highly energy {{efficient}} approach for using catalytic oxidation chemistry in multiple fields of {{technology has been}} pursued. The new catalysts, called TAMLÂ® activators, catalyze the reactions of hydrogen peroxide and other oxidants for the exceptionally rapid decontamination of noninfectious simulants (B. atrophaeus) of anthrax spores, for the {{energy efficient}} decontamination of thiophosphate pesticides, for the facile, low temperature removal of color and organochlorines from pulp and paper mill effluent, for the bleaching of dyes from textile mill effluents, and {{for the removal of}} recalcitrant dibenzothiophene compounds from diesel and gasoline fuels. Highlights include the following: 1) A 7 -log kill of Bacillus atrophaeus spores has been achieved unambiguously in water under ambient conditions within 15 minutes. 2) The rapid total degradation under ambient conditions of four thiophosphate pesticides and phosphonate degradation intermediates has been achieved on treatment with TAML/peroxide, opening up potential applications of the decontamination system for phosphonate structured chemical warfare agents, for inexpensive, easy to perform degradation of stored and aged pesticide stocks (especially in Africa and Asia), for remediation of polluted sites and water bodies, and for the destruction of chemical warfare agent stockpiles. 3) A mill trial conducted in a Pennsylvanian bleached kraft pulp mill has established that TAML catalyst injected into an alkaline peroxide <b>bleach</b> <b>tower</b> can significantly lower color from the effluent stream promising a new, more cost effective, energy-saving approach for color remediation adding further evidence of the value and diverse engineering capacity of the approach to other field trials conducted on effluent streams as they exit the bleach plant. 4) Dibenzothiophenes (DBTs), including 4, 6 -dimethyldibenzothiophene, the most recalcitrant sulfur compounds in diesel and gasoline, can be completely removed from model gasoline (octane or decane) at low temperature and ambient pressure via treatment with a TAML activator and hydrogen peroxide in a two-phase system consisting of the fuel as the first phase and a water/tertiary butanol second phase. The DBTs are oxidized to sulphones (or sulfoxides), which then completely extract into the water/t-butanol phase. Treatment of commercial diesel spiked with DBT under the same conditions results in compete DBT oxidation. In contrast with the octane and decane experiments, removal to the water/t-butanol phase is not yet complete and is being further optimized. Analysis by the sulfur specific GC-FPD technique suggests that > 70 % sulfur compounds are removed from unspiked diesel after one treatment. Further treatments are being investigated. The GC-FPD results will be checked by total sulfur analysis methodology...|$|R
60|$|The {{matter of}} {{firewood}} always concerned Nielsen and {{me more than}} any one. Nielsen was a Norwegian, raised as a boy to use a crosscut saw; and as for me I was a connoisseur in camp-fires and a lover of them. Hence we had brought a crosscut saw--a long one with two handles. I remembered from the former year a huge dead pine that had <b>towered</b> <b>bleached</b> and white {{at the edge of}} the glade. It stood there still. The storms and blasts of another winter had not changed it in the least. It was five feet thick at the base and solid. Nielsen chopped a notch in it on the lower side, and then he and Edd began to saw into it on the other. I saw the first tremor of the lofty top. Then soon it shivered all the way down, gave forth a loud crack, swayed slowly, and fell majestically, to strike with a thundering crash. Only the top of this pine broke in the fall, but there were splinters and knots and branches enough to fill a wagon. These we carried up to our camp-fire.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to determine possible causes of the darkening of hydrogen peroxide bleached mechanical pulp over the visible spectrum and their relative contributions. It focuses on both process conditions and {{the composition of the}} pulp and the dilution water, including additions or losses of material along the process line from the <b>bleach</b> <b>tower</b> to the paper machine. A mapping of the optical properties of the pulp along the process showed that the fine fraction of the pulp darkened more than the long fibre fraction. Simulation of retention times of different fractions showed that {{the main part of the}} fine material is retained in the paper within a few hours, a small part might circulate for considerably longer time and may therefore be strongly coloured. Storage trials were mainly performed using a hydrogen peroxide bleached mechanical pulp intended for SC paper made of Norway spruce (Picea abies), sampled on one occasion and stored in a freezer. Unwashed or well-washed pulp was stored in distilled water or in different process waters. Some complementary trials were included, e. g. unbleached pulp. Time and temperature were the process variables that gave the strongest darkening of the pulp, as expected, both in a clean and a more process-like system, whereas pH only had an effect in the presence of process waters; the highest brightness stability was seen at a pH around 5. 5 – 6. 0. The darkening was due to an increase in the light absorption coefficient (k) beginning at short wavelengths, but after longer storage times the increase in kλ also became noticeable at longer wavelengths. The colour (CIE L*, a*, b*) of the pulp changed towards red and yellow, initially more towards red and then more towards yellow. These changes were clearly visible. Washing of the bleached pulp made it less sensitive to storage; possibly due to the removal of extractives, lignin-like substances, metals and pulp fines. This washing had little effect before storage and the amount of material removed was small. The pulp darkened more when stored in process waters compared to distilled water. Apart from fibres, most of the colour was associated with pulp fines or filler but some colour was also found in the dissolved and colloidal fractions. At an increased pulp consistency, the increase in k 460 was smaller. Storage in white water from the paper machine gave extensive discolouration with a shoulder in the absorption spectrum around 550 – 650 nm, which increased with time. The addition of ferric ions increased the light absorption coefficient during storage, but could not explain the increased absorption at 550 – 650 nm nor could it be the only cause of the darkening in the mill system. A cationic basic violet dye gave a shoulder in the absorption spectrum similar to that of the mill system, but the absorption of the dye did not increase during storage. Model calculations indicate, but do not prove, that ferric ions together with violet and red dyes could have played a major, but not exclusive role in the colour observed in the mill system after storage. The darkening not accounted for, at longer wavelengths and around 550 – 650 nm, is suggested to be related to fines and fillers including dissolved and colloidal substances associated with these particles. A method to produce representative sheets for determination of optical properties of mechanical pulps was developed. The new method makes it possible to follow changes in light absorption and light scattering coefficients over the visible range of wavelengths. It is approximately six times faster than standard methods, reduces the risk of additional darkening of the sample and can be used with small pulp quantities. The deviation from the expected linear behaviour of the light scattering coefficient, s, at wavelengths corresponding to strong light absorption has been studied using the Kubelka-Munk model and the angular resolved DORT 2002 radiative transfer solution method. The decrease in s could not be explained by errors introduced in the Kubelka-Munk modelling by anisotropic scattering...|$|R
40|$|Hydrogen {{peroxide}} {{has been}} used by manufacturers of high yield mechanical pulps as the preferred bleaching chemical. For example, Australian Newsprint Mills(ANM) Ltd operates a hydrogen peroxide refiner bleaching Pine TMP plant at its Albury mill and a peroxide <b>tower</b> <b>bleaching</b> plant at the Boyer mill processing Eucalypt CCS. Hydrogen peroxide bleaching requires alkaline conditions to form the active bleaching species 001 - 1 -. However, under these conditions hydrogen peroxide is very susceptible to transition metal ion catalysed decomposition. The metals manganese, iron, and copper promote the greatest rate of peroxide decomposition. DTPA is added to chelate the transition metal ions in the process and prevent hydrogen peroxide decomposition. DTPA is a strong complexing agent and there are some concerns about its environmental impact. Alternatives to DTPA have been investigated. Recently a patent was published using Zeolite as an alternative chemical to DTPA. In this project the affect of zeolite and sodium citrate on peroxide decomposition and bleaching of Pine TMP and Eucalypt CCS pulp has been investigated. Manganese, a known decomposition catalyst, {{has been used}} to produce conditions which induce peroxide decomposition. Various factors including pH, zeolite type, zeolite concentration and sodium citrate concentrations were all found to affect the rate of peroxide decomposition and bleaching response. Zeolite-A was found to reduce decomposition more than the other two zeolites, types X and Y. Zeolite-A has a lower Si/A 1 ratio which allows for greater cation exchange. The combined zeolite and citrate system had the greatest stabilising effect on decomposition of peroxide solutions in the presence of manganese under alkaline conditions. Zeolite-A also had a better bleaching response than the other zeolites. Combined zeolite-A and citrate systems achieved brightness results slightly less than DTPA though the residual peroxide concentrations were significantly lower for peroxide bleaching of Pine TMP. The order of chemical addition is important. If the alkali is added prior to zeolite, and manganese is oxidised from Mn 2 + state to higher states forming Mn-O-Mn type complexes, zeolite was found to be ineffective. Consequently zeolite-A had no effect on manganese induce peroxide decomposition leading to a poor peroxide bleaching response with Eucalypt CCS pulps. Zeolite is believed to be acting as a chelating agent rather than as a catalyst for hydrogen peroxide oxidation reactions (bleaching). Zeolite is able to cation exchange Mn 2 + ions but not Mn-O-Mn complexes. If Mn-O-Mn complexes are allowed to form, decomposition of peroxide occurs. Addition of citrate helps transfer Mn ions into the zeolite structure rather than providing an overall increase in chelating ability. Addition of zeolite improves optical properties of handsheets by increasing opacity and light scattering co-efficient which is beneficial to newsprint grades. No significant losses in strength of handsheets occurred with the addition of zeolite...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} focused on the novel wood chip {{refining}} process called AdvancedThermomechanical Pulp (ATMP) refining. ATMP consists of mechanical pretreatmentof chips in Impressafiner and Fiberizer prior to first stage refining atincreased intensity. Process chemicals (this study was concentrated on hydrogenperoxide and magnesium hydroxide) are introduced into the first stage refiner. It is known that the use of chemicals in TMP process and first stage refining atelevated intensity can reduce the energy demands of refining. The downside is thatthey also alter the character of the produced pulp. Reductions in fibre length andtear index are usually the consequences of refining at elevated intensity. Additionof chemicals usually leads to reduction of the light scattering coefficient. Usingstatistical methods it was shown {{that it is possible to}} maintain the TMP character ofthe pulp using the ATMP process. This is explained by a separation of thedefibration and the fibre development phases in refining. This separation allowsdefibration of chips to fibres and fibre bundles without addition of chemicals orincrease in refining intensity. Chemicals are applied in the fibre developmentphase only (first stage refiner). The energy demand in refining to reach tensileindex of 25 Nm/g was reduced by up to 1. 1 MWh/odt (42 %) using the ATMPprocess on Loblolly pine. The energy demand in refining of White spruce, requiredto reach tensile index of 30 Nm/g, was reduced by 0. 65 MWh/odt (37 %). Characterizations of individual fibre properties, properties of sheets made fromlong fibre fractions and model fibre sheets with different fines fractions werecarried out. It was established that both the process equipment configuration (i. e. the mechanical pre‐treatment and the elevated refining intensity) and the additionof process chemicals in the ATMP process influence fibre properties such as external and internal fibrillation as well as the amount of split fibres. Improvementof these properties translated into improved properties of sheets, made from thelong fibre fractions of the studied pulps. The quality of the fines fraction alsoimproved. However, the mechanisms of improvement in the fines quality seem tobe different for fines, generated using improved process configuration andaddition of process chemicals. The first type of fines contributed to better bondingof model long fibre sheets through the densification of the structure. Fines whichhave been influenced by the addition of the process chemicals seemed in additionto improve bonding between long fibres by enhancing the specific bond strength. The improved fibre and fines properties also translated into better airpermeability and surface roughness of paper sheets, properties which areespecially important for supercalendered (SC) printing paper. The magnitude offibre roughening after moistening was mainly influenced by the processequipment configuration while the addition of process chemicals yielded lowestfinal surface roughness due to the lowest initial surface roughness. There was nodifference in how fines fractions from the studied processes influenced the fibreroughening. However, fines with better bonding yielded model fibre sheets withhigher PPS, probably due to their consolidation around fibre joints. Hence, thedecrease in PPS can probably be attributed to the improvements in the long fibrefraction properties while the improvement of fines quality contributed to thereduction of air permeability. The process chemicals, utilized in the ATMP process (Mg(OH) 2 and H 2 O 2) alsoproved to be an effective bleaching system. Comparable increases in brightnesscould be reached using the ATMP process and conventional <b>tower</b> <b>bleaching.</b> Maximum brightness of the pulp was reached after approximately 10 minutes ofhigh‐consistency storage after refining or 40 minutes of conventional bleaching. This study was conducted using a pilot scale refiner system operated as a batchprocess. Most of the experiments were performed using White spruce (Piceaglauca). In Paper I, Loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) was used. It is believed that theresults presented in this thesis are valid for other softwood raw materials as well,but this limitation should be considered...|$|R
