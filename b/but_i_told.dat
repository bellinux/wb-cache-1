500|$|Despite his mixed {{feelings}} on joining the club, Gunn's overall impression {{of his time}} in Edinburgh is upbeat: [...] "I only played 12 games for the Hibees but it was great. We beat Hearts in my only derby game 2–1 (John Robertson scored his 50th goal for Hearts in derbies <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> him it was worth nothing as we had won) and had a clean sheet at Celtic Park (stopping them from winning the SPL that day)." [...] He received what he described as a [...] "wonderful reception" [...] from Aberdeen fans when playing for Hibernian against his former club.|$|E
500|$|In early August 2010, Entertainment Weekly {{reported}} that Eric the Actor, from The Howard Stern Show, had been cast {{for a small}} role in the new season's second episode. Deaf actor Russell Harvard portrayed Joe, {{a man who is}} able to survive the box being opened only to be killed by Fauxlivia. Harvard later commented in an interview, [...] "Fringe was so much fun and not even stressful compared to [...] Hamill. It was very fast and rapid. Playing the dead guy was very easy. Working with Anna Torv was so much fun, she is a great, great actress and very sweet. I did not think she would be that kind of person." [...] He continued, [...] "There was a stunt which {{she did not want to}} do herself, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> her 'You want to be authentic so I want you to pull me,' so she obliged. It was a great experience and so much fun and I wish I could have stayed on the show for a long time." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Confessions of a Broken Heart (Daughter to Father)" [...] {{was directed by}} Lohan in Chelsea, Manhattan, New York City, and references her father Michael's alcoholism and alleged domestic abuse. Tommy Mottola, head of Casablanca, revealed {{that no one could}} direct the video better than Lindsay herself, who said to Lohan, [...] "'No one knows this song better than you, no one knows this situation better than you.' It's a lot to take on, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> her she's ready, and we'll give her all the support she needs". Lohan said that the video's storefront setting was chosen because, in her words, [...] "my life is on display". Lohan also wanted to break a mirror during the bathroom scenes, because she wanted to show her real feelings in the video. Assistant director Jeb Bryan said to Lohan, [...] "This is real glass, Lindsay. We weren't prepared for you to break these things. [...] Do you want this slow motion?" [...] She responded, [...] "Regular frame will make it more violent. [...] I don't want it to be too pretty". The music video was first aired on MTV's Making the Video, and later released to iTunes Store on October 25, 2005.|$|E

500|$|David Hill, 18, {{was asked}} to [...] "sit in" [...] at the house, and while there heard Dudson shout [...] "Shut up, you slag!" [...] in the back room. When he asked what was going on, Leigh had shown him Capper. He said: [...] "She {{had a sort of}} cloth over her face, from just above the eyebrows and {{covering}} her nose. She had a bit of dried blood on her lip. She had no hair." [...] Hill also said he had heard them talking about [...] "dentistry work. It was something about pulling her teeth out with a pair of pliers." [...] Later, he was left alone in the house with Capper, who pleaded with him to untie her. He said: [...] "She asked me if I could help <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> her I couldn't. I asked her who she was. She said her name was Suzanne. She asked me if I could untie her. I said I couldn't do anything." [...] He later claimed that he was too afraid of Leigh to intervene or raise the alarm, saying: [...] "I thought they would batter me. If I'd said [...] they'd all have got me, wouldn't they? I didn't know what to do. I was too shocked to do anything." [...] While Capper was being held in the house, Leigh and Dudson met up with her sister's fiance Paul Barlow to help him repair his car. Barlow said: [...] "They could have told me there and then. The door would have been kicked down and I would have got Suzanne out. I did not think they were capable of such savagery. Now all I want is ten minutes with them in a back room." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for the remix of [...] "Up Out My Face" [...] {{was directed by}} Carey's husband, Nick Cannon. Minaj spoke about filming a video with Carey and how she {{did not believe that}} the video would ever be released: [...] "I didn’t even tell anyone I shot a video with Mariah, because I didn’t even believe. In the back of my mind, I felt like, ’This video is not gonna come out. There’s no way I’m gonna do a video with Mariah Carey before I even put out my album.’ Then, when it came out, I think it was the #1 video on YouTube in one day, something crazy like that." [...] It premiered simultaneously with the video for [...] "Angels Cry" [...] with Ne-Yo on Vevo on January 28, 2010. Carey and Minaj play different characters, include Barbie dolls who escape from their boxes, sexy nurses in matching outfits, two women in a nail salon and two divas shopping. Carey's doll box has [...] "She sings" [...] written on the front, while Minaj's say [...] "She raps". Cannon makes a cameo appearance in the video, which Chris Ryan of MTV Buzzworthy thought was a reference to the 2002 film, Drumline. According to Anna Pickard of The Guardian, the escape from their packaging demonstrates a theme of being independent women and {{that they will not be}} restrained by men. Minaj spoke about the video in an interview for MTV News: [...] "A lot of times, more famous artists or more confident artists take from a younger artist but they’ll never include you in that. I feel like she liked the whole doll thing and she wanted to do it with me. But she said that: She said, ’Everybody’s gonna say 'she’s doing Nicki.' <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> her, she’s always had a doll persona, like all that ’doll baby’ [...] So it goes perfect with Barbie and we had fun. That’s all that matters." ...|$|E

2500|$|Mitchel {{made the}} {{acquaintance}} of Thomas Carlyle during his connection with The Nation. Carlyle described a dinner at Mitchel's house in 1846, saying that Mitchel was [...] "a fine elastic-spirited young fellow, whom I grieved to see rushing to destruction palpable by attack of windmills, but upon whom all my persuasions were thrown away". Carlyle later said, when Mitchel was on trial, [...] "Irish Mitchel, poor fellow… I {{told him he}} would most likely be hanged, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> him, too, that they could not hang the immortal part of him." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I did {{the pilot}} for Britain's Got Talent – which was {{originally}} {{going to be}} called Paul O'Grady's Got Talent. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> the producers they were having a joke if they thought I would front a show with that title. The original panel of judges was going to be Simon Cowell, Fern Britton and Piers Morgan. I was the host. Then when I had the row with ITV I was banned from the studios. I remember I rang Simon and told him he had a huge hit on his hands, {{but there was no way}} I could do it. I said, if I am banned I have to be banned from everything. I can’t be a hypocrite and come in and do this. I had to bow out." ...|$|E
2500|$|On April 10, 2007, a Bahamian {{judge ruled}} Larry Birkhead, photographer, {{as the father}} of Dannielynn. DNA tests had {{established}} Birkhead as the father, with 99.99% certainty. Commenting on the revelation, Birkhead stated, [...] "I hate {{to be the one to}} tell you this <b>but,</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> you so. I'm the father...My baby's going to be coming home pretty soon." [...] Birkhead subsequently applied for an amended birth certificate listing him as the father, which paved the way for him to obtain a passport for the baby to leave with him for the United States. Howard K. Stern did not contest the DNA results or the ruling. Subsequent to the ruling, Birkhead returned to the United States with the baby. Smith's mother, Virgie Arthur, appealed the ruling but it was later denied and she was ordered to pay costs.|$|E

But she loved the final result!". Madonna also decided to use her new country style during her public appearances for Musics promotion; including jeans, shirts and cowboy hats. On her next tour in 2001, Madonna included a segment based entirely on this ambient. Meanwhile, Fouz-Hernández explained that [...] "in this appearance Madonna may be parodying and criticizing Country, which symbolizes among other things, the supremacy of the white man, the ambition of the European pioneers and the American Dream. However, we do not realize that while recognizing the importance that the country has in American popular culture, and joins a long list of artists who have done this previously. Despite this, the cowgirl image of Madonna has become one of her most recognized reinventions.|$|E
