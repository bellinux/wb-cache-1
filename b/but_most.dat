5|$|Lice {{may reduce}} host life {{expectancy}} if the infestation is heavy, <b>but</b> <b>most</b> {{seem to have}} little effect on their host. The habit of dust bathing in domestic hens is probably {{an attempt by the}} birds to rid themselves of lice. Lice may transmit microbial diseases and helminth parasites, <b>but</b> <b>most</b> individuals spend their whole life cycle on a single host and are only able to transfer to a new host opportunistically. Ischnoceran lice may reduce the thermoregulation effect of the plumage; thus heavily infested birds lose more heat than others.|$|E
5|$|A few adult beetles may {{overlap between}} {{the spring and}} summer populations, <b>but</b> <b>most</b> adults from the earlier {{emergence}} die before the end of summer. Both adult and larval tansy beetles are unble to detect their host plant, or each other, at a distance, either by smell, sight or a combination of the two. Starvation is thus likely to be a major contributor to mortality when beetles wander away from their host and become lost.|$|E
50|$|Passing can be {{performed}} with three or more juggling props (for examples balls and rings) <b>but</b> is <b>most</b> commonly performed with clubs. Jugglers can perform passing one person standing behind the other, back to back, or side by side <b>but</b> the <b>most</b> usual stance is where the jugglers face each.|$|R

50|$|Kinetic {{weapons have}} always been {{widespread}} in conventional warfare—bullets, arrows, swords, clubs, etc.—but the energy a projectile would gain while falling from orbit would make such a weapon rival all <b>but</b> the <b>most</b> powerful explosives. A direct hit would presumably destroy all <b>but</b> the <b>most</b> hardened targets {{without the need for}} nuclear weapons.|$|R
5|$|A small {{proportion}} of follicles open and release their seed spontaneously, <b>but</b> <b>most</b> remain closed until stimulated to open by bushfire. Bushfire kills the maternal plant, which has neither thick bark nor lignotubers, but the subsequent shedding of seed allows the population to regenerate. Seed predation continues after its release: in one study, B.brownii seeds {{were placed on the}} ground in both burnt and unburnt sides; almost all were eaten by parrots within four weeks.|$|E
5|$|According to O'Brien, only he, Woodfull, the masseur (who was deaf), Alan Kippax, {{and former}} Australian Test players Jack Ryder and Ernie Jones were present when the {{incident}} took place, <b>but</b> <b>most</b> of the Australian team {{were watching the}} match from a balcony adjoining the dressing room from where {{they would have been}} able to hear the confrontation. O'Brien claimed that he went outside and told the group what had happened; around twenty people were present.|$|E
5|$|After {{her husband}} fell into captivity, Constance {{announced}} her intention {{to administer the}} principality, <b>but</b> <b>most</b> Antiochene noblemen preferred a male ruler. BaldwinIII of Jerusalem hurried to Antioch and declared Constance's fifteen-year-old son, Bohemond III, the lawful prince, charging Patriarch Aimery with {{the administration of the}} principality. Constance did not accept Baldwin's decision and protested against it to Emperor Manuel.|$|E

5|$|After the war, Murphy {{enjoyed a}} 21-year acting career. He played {{himself in the}} 1955 autobiographical film To Hell and Back, based on his 1949 memoirs of the same name, <b>but</b> <b>most</b> of his roles were in westerns. He made guest {{appearances}} on celebrity television shows and starred in the series Whispering Smith. Murphy was a fairly accomplished songwriter. He bred quarter horses in California and Arizona, and became a regular participant in horse racing.|$|E
5|$|At 09:00, Washington {{arrived from}} Manhattan. He {{realized}} that he had been wrong about a feint on Long Island and he ordered more troops to Brooklyn from Manhattan.

5|$|At 16:00 on 30 January, {{a flight}} of 11 Mitsubishi torpedo bombers from the 751 Air Group, based at Kavieng and staging through Buka, {{attacked}} the force towing Chicago. Fighter aircraft from Enterprise shot down eight of them, <b>but</b> <b>most</b> of the Japanese aircraft were able to release their torpedoes before crashing. One torpedo hit the destroyer , causing heavy damage. Four more torpedoes hit Chicago, sinking her.|$|E

5|$|Autosomal {{dominant}} {{polycystic kidney}} disease (ADPKD), a hereditary kidney condition, {{is known to be}} associated with cerebral aneurysms in 8 percent of cases, <b>but</b> <b>most</b> such aneurysms are small and therefore unlikely to rupture. As a result, screening is only recommended in families with ADPKD where one family member has had a ruptured aneurysm.|$|E
5|$|Bat dung, {{a type of}} guano, is rich in nitrates and is mined from caves for use as fertilizer.
