5|$|An RNA {{thermometer}} (or RNA thermosensor) is a temperature-sensitive non-coding RNA molecule which regulates gene expression. RNA thermometers often regulate genes required during {{either a}} heat shock or cold shock response, but have <b>been</b> <b>implicated</b> in other regulatory roles {{such as in}} pathogenicity and starvation.|$|E
5|$|Disease. Increased {{disease in}} wild populations often follows {{weakening}} from other environmental stressors, such as habitat loss. Upper lung infection and shell diseases have <b>been</b> <b>implicated</b> in {{the decline of}} the desert tortoise (California, Nevada) and gopher tortoise (Georgia, Florida's state tortoise).|$|E
5|$|Due to {{its role}} in {{generating}} the activated form of NF-κB, an anti-apoptotic and pro-inflammatory regulator of cytokine expression, proteasomal activity {{has been linked to}} inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Increased levels of proteasome activity correlate with disease activity and have <b>been</b> <b>implicated</b> in autoimmune diseases including systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis.|$|E
50|$|She had {{a leading}} role in the {{collaboration}} that uncovered Myo7a, the first gene to <b>be</b> <b>implicated</b> in deafness in mice and in humans. Most recently, she led the discovery of Mir-96 microRNA that <b>is</b> <b>implicated</b> in progressive hearing loss in mice and humans.|$|R

5|$|Fruit and vegetables, {{particularly}} leafy vegetables, have <b>been</b> <b>implicated</b> {{in nearly}} half the gastrointestinal infections caused by norovirus in the United States. These foods are commonly eaten raw and may become contaminated during their preparation by an infected food handler. Hygiene is important when handling foods to be eaten raw, and such products need to be properly cleaned, handled, and stored to limit contamination.|$|E
5|$|In {{almost all}} cases, {{symptoms}} resolve within a week. Fatalities are extremely unlikely. No deaths {{have been reported}} since the introduction of antivenom in 1956. Before this, redback spider bites had <b>been</b> <b>implicated</b> in at least 14 deaths in Australia, however these cases cannot be definitively linked to the Redback bite as the sole cause.|$|E
5|$|In {{the form}} of {{chloride}} ions, chlorine is necessary to all known species of life. Other types of chlorine compounds are rare in living organisms, and artificially produced chlorinated organics range from inert to toxic. In the upper atmosphere, chlorine-containing organic molecules such as chlorofluorocarbons have <b>been</b> <b>implicated</b> in ozone depletion. Small quantities of elemental chlorine are generated by oxidation of chloride to hypochlorite in neutrophils {{as part of the}} immune response against bacteria.|$|E
50|$|Faulty SCSRs <b>were</b> <b>implicated</b> in the Sago Mine disaster.|$|R
50|$|Fioricet <b>is</b> <b>implicated</b> as causing repeat {{headaches}} with over-use.|$|R
50|$|Mutations in {{keratinocyte}} transglutaminase <b>are</b> <b>implicated</b> in lamellar ichthyosis.|$|R
5|$|Low immune {{function}} has also <b>been</b> <b>implicated</b> in endometrial cancer. High {{blood pressure is}} also a risk factor, but {{this may be because}} of its association with obesity. Sitting regularly for prolonged periods is associated with higher mortality from endometrial cancer. The risk is not negated by regular exercise, though it is lowered.|$|E
5|$|Many {{psychological}} mechanisms have <b>been</b> <b>implicated</b> in {{the development}} and maintenance of schizophrenia. Cognitive biases have been identified in those with the diagnosis or those at risk, especially when under stress or in confusing situations. Some cognitive features may reflect global neurocognitive deficits such as memory loss, while others may be related to particular issues and experiences.|$|E
5|$|Mephedrone has <b>been</b> <b>implicated</b> in {{the death}} of a 22-year-old male, who had also {{injected}} black tar heroin. Mephedrone was found in his blood at a concentration of 0.50mg/L and in his urine at a concentration of 198mg/L. The blood concentration of morphine, a metabolite of heroin, was 0.06mg/L. For comparison, the average blood morphine concentration resulting from deadly overdoses involving only heroin is around 0.34mg/L.|$|E

5|$|Not all {{interactions}} {{between humans and}} cattle egrets are beneficial. The cattle egret can be a safety hazard to aircraft due to its habit of feeding in large groups in the grassy verges of airports, and it has <b>been</b> <b>implicated</b> in the spread of animal infections such as heartwater, infectious bursal disease and possibly Newcastle disease.|$|E
5|$|The first {{symptoms}} of neuroblastoma are often vague making diagnosis difficult. Fatigue, loss of appetite, fever, and joint pain are common. Symptoms depend on primary tumor locations and metastases if present: Germline mutations in the PHOX2A or KIF1B gene have <b>been</b> <b>implicated</b> in familial neuroblastoma as well. Neuroblastoma {{is also a}} feature of neurofibromatosis type 1 and the Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome.|$|E
5|$|The gene TGFBR2 has <b>been</b> <b>implicated</b> {{in several}} {{connective}} tissue disorders including Marfan syndrome, arterial tortuosity, and thoracic aortic aneurysm. A study {{of patients with}} SCSFLS demonstrated no mutations in this gene. Minor features of Marfan syndrome {{has been found in}} 20% of CSF leak patients. Abnormal findings of fibrillin-1 has been documented in these CSF-leak patients, but only one patient demonstrated a fibrillin-1 defect consistent with Marfan syndrome.|$|E

50|$|The {{carcinogenic}} {{potential of the}} MAPK pathway makes it clinically significant. It <b>is</b> <b>implicated</b> in cell processes {{that can lead to}} uncontrolled growth and subsequent tumor formation. Mutations within this pathway alter its regulatory effects on cell differentiation, proliferation, survival, and apoptosis, all of which <b>are</b> <b>implicated</b> in various forms of cancer.|$|R
5|$|The {{woman who}} {{achieved}} the greatest {{prominence in the}} ancient world for her learning was Hypatia of Alexandria, who educated young men in mathematics, philosophy, and astronomy, and advised the Roman prefect of Egypt on politics. Her influence put her into conflict with the bishop of Alexandria, Cyril, who may have <b>been</b> <b>implicated</b> in her violent death in 415 {{at the hands of a}} Christian mob.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{industries}} and sources have <b>been</b> <b>implicated,</b> including {{high levels of}} dust in coal mining, gold mining, and the cotton textile industry, occupations involving cadmium and isocyanates, and fumes from welding. Working in agriculture is also a risk. In some professions the risks have been estimated as equivalent to that of one half to two packs of cigarettes a day. Silica dust and fiberglass dust exposure {{can also lead to}} COPD, with the risk unrelated to that for silicosis. The negative effects of dust exposure and cigarette smoke exposure appear to be additive or possibly more than additive.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{protozoa}} can cause gastroenteritis – most commonly Giardia lamblia – but Entamoeba histolytica, Cryptosporidium spp., {{and other species}} have also <b>been</b> <b>implicated.</b> As a group, these agents comprise about 10% of cases in children. Giardia occurs more commonly in the developing world, but this etiologic agent causes this type of illness to some degree nearly everywhere. It occurs more commonly in persons who have traveled to areas with high prevalence, children who attend day care, {{men who have sex}} with men, and following disasters.|$|E

5|$|At nest sites, battles {{sometimes}} {{occur between}} {{two or more}} pairs before the original owners declare themselves {{as the owner of}} the nest. Red-billed tropicbirds are aggressive at nest sites, fighting with each other and ousting species such as shearwaters, petrels, and white-tailed tropicbirds. They have also been recorded taking over nests of white-tailed tropicbirds and raising their young if they failed to destroy their eggs. Vagrant red-billed tropicbirds have <b>been</b> <b>implicated</b> in egg loss in red-tailed tropicbird nests in Hawaii.|$|E
5|$|Contrails are a manmade type of cirrus cloud {{formed when}} water vapor from the exhaust of a jet engine {{condenses}} on particles, which come {{from either the}} surrounding air or the exhaust itself, and freezes, leaving behind a visible trail. The exhaust can also trigger the formation of cirrus by providing ice nuclei {{when there is an}} insufficient naturally-occurring supply in the atmosphere. One of the environmental impacts of aviation is that persistent contrails can form into large mats of cirrus, and increased air traffic has <b>been</b> <b>implicated</b> as one possible cause of the increasing frequency and amount of cirrus in Earth's atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|Disturbance has <b>been</b> <b>implicated</b> in the {{formation}} of vegetation dominated by large Attalea species. In seasonally dry Amazonian forests the density of large adult A.maripa palms was correlated with canopy openness; the species also dominates savannas formed by repeated forest fires in Trinidad and Tobago. Attalea speciosa forms pure stands in many parts of Brazil where natural forest vegetation has been cleared. Similarly, stands of A.funifera in Bahia, Brazil (which are cultivated for piassava fibre) are managed using fire—the seedlings survive cutting and burning, and are able to dominate burned forest patches.|$|E
