This method uses jointly the usual analytical and Monte Carlo methods. Effects of the lower boundary of the atmosphere, cloud tops, and ground surface are investigated both qualitatively and quantitatively. The ratio of multiple to single scattering is determined, and its importance in ozone profile inversion of <b>backscattered</b> UV <b>solar</b> radiation from the terrestrial atmosphere is evaluated.

40|$|The <b>Solar</b> <b>Backscatter</b> <b>Ultraviolet</b> and Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (SBUV/TOMS) onboard the Nimbus 7 {{satellite}} is an {{atmospheric ozone}} measuring experiment from <b>solar</b> <b>backscattered</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>radiation</b> off the earth atmosphere.

A technique used in the in-orbit calibration of SUBV/TOMS for the ozone data processing is presented. This technique employs a model to explain and correct the observed instrument output due to degradation. From the analyses with the corrected data to verify the model, it is concluded that the in-orbit instrument calibration for the ozone measurement is accurate within 2 percent for the first four years of the instrument operation...|$|R
40|$|New {{methods to}} {{quantify}} the aerosol optical properties have been developed. These properties have important influences on UV radiation. By combining spectral irradiance and radiance measurements, the effective single scat-tering albedo and optical depth of aerosols can be derived with reasonable accuracy at locations with moderate to high aerosol optical depth. Under low aerosol conditions, accurate determination of the wavelength dependence of the aerosol optical depth in the UV-B is restricted by calibration uncertainties and by the interference of ozone and SO 2. • Although the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) instrument is no longer available, continuity of satellite-derived global UV data is maintained. The new Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) onboard the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Earth Observing System (EOS) Aura spacecraft was launched in July 2004 for continued global monitoring of ozone, other trace gases, and surface UV irradiance. • Tropospheric aerosols {{are responsible for the}} overestimation of UV irradiance from satellite instruments (e. g., TOMS) that use <b>solar</b> <b>backscattered</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>radiation</b> to derive surface UV irradiance. Although at clean sites the agreement with ground-based measurements is good, over more polluted locations the bias can be as large as 40 % because the lowermost atmosphere containing the absorbing aerosols is not adequately probed. The presence of clouds, and snow or ice cover, can also lead to significant biases. New algorithms have been develope...|$|R

SETTING [...] 59 counties in England and Wales. SUBJECTS [...] All registered cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma during the period 1968 - 85. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE [...] Age and sex adjusted odds ratio for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in each county. RESULTS [...] Incidence of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma {{was significantly associated with}} <b>solar</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>radiation</b> levels (P < 0. 001), even after social class and employment in agriculture were controlled for (P = 0. 004). In a comparison of counties in the highest and lowest quarters of <b>solar</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>radiation,</b> the relative risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was 1. 27 (95 % confidence interval 1. 24 to 1. 29), rising to 1. 34 (1. 32 to 1. 37) after adjustment for social class and employment in agriculture.

40|$|Many {{investigators}} {{have concluded that}} the level of <b>solar</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>radiation</b> (200 - 300 nm) reaching the surface was a key parameter in the origin and evolution of life on earth. The level of <b>solar</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>radiation</b> between 200 and 300 nm is controlled primarily by molecular absorption by ozone, whose presence is strongly coupled to the level of molecular oxygen. In this paper, a series of calculations is presented of the <b>solar</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>radiation</b> reaching the surface for oxygen levels ranging from 0. 0001 the present atmospheric level to the present level. The solar spectrum between 200 and 300 nm has been divided into 34 spectral intervals.

40|$|Background: <b>Solar</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>radiation</b> (UVR) is {{considered}} one of the most important biological risk factors in the world. Most health damages from <b>solar</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>radiation</b> at ground level are mainly caused by UVA and UVB spectrums. Objective: The aim of this study was to Measure the <b>solar</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>radiation</b> intensity type A and B in Qazvin city. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, the intensity of <b>solar</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>radiation</b> type A and B was measured in Qazvin on years of 2013 - 14 (during one year) every monthly at three times, in the morning, afternoon and evening by using a UV Radiometer. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Findings: The maximum average intensity of UVA and UVB rays during the one year with 28. 36 ± 1. 88 W/m 2 and 0. 156 ± 0. 035 W/m 2 respectively was in Tir month (June 22 –July 22) and the minimum average intensity of UVA and UVB rays with 10. 36 ± 0. 83 W/m 2 and 0. 041 ± 0. 010 W/m 2 respectively was in Dai month (December 22 –January 20).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Construction {{workers in}} Hong Kong face high health risks of heat stress, <b>solar</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>radiation,</b> and {{hazardous}} substances. A suitable work wear can lower exposure to these hazards, {{but the actual}} dressing behavior of construction workers remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: Thisstudy examines the current dressing patterns of construction workers and evaluates their limitations. METHODS: The dressing patterns of construction workers were investigated through unconcealed videotaped observation and questionnaire survey to enhance {{the reliability and validity}} of this research. RESULTS: Results indicate that construction workers were willing to wear short-sleeved shirts for a cooler feeling, although such dressing patterns may not protect them against <b>solar</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>radiation</b> or hazardous substances. Their preferred dark-colored long pants can decrease the direct exposure to <b>solar</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>radiation</b> and hazardous substances, but they absorb a large amount of radiation heat that increases the hazards of heat stress to the wearers.
