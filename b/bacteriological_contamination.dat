40|$|BACKGROUND: Arterial or venous homografts are {{frequently}} implanted for vascular reconstruction in orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). When fresh vascular homografts (VH) {{from the same}} donor were not available, VH from another donor preserved at 4 degrees C in Terasaki (Ter) solution (modified lymphocyte culture medium) were used. METHODS: The clinical results after implantation of Ter-stored VH versus fresh VH in the revascularization of pediatric OLT were studied retrospectively. Short- and long-term follow-up of vascular patency {{was carried out by}} doppler ultrasonography in each case. A histological and bacteriological study of nonimplanted VH stored at 4 degrees C in saline (Sal), Ter and University of Wisconsin (UW) solutions for various time periods (days 0 - 28) was also undertaken. RESULTS: Between 1989 and 1996, 21 iliac arteries and 21 iliac veins preserved in Ter solution (mean preservation time: 8 days; range 1 - 26) and 100 fresh VH (68 arteries and 32 veins) (preservation time: 8 hr, range 4 - 21) were used in pediatric OLT. Thrombosis rates were 0 of 21 for stored arteries vs. 7 of 68 (10 %) for fresh arteries (NS) and 3 of 21 (14 %) for stored veins vs. 3 of 32 (9 %) for fresh veins (NS). Actuarial graft survival rates were similar in both groups. Histological analysis of stored, nonimplanted VH invariably showed endothelial destruction within 24 - 48 hr after procurement. The <b>bacteriological</b> study showed <b>contamination</b> rates of 14 of 25 (56 %) for Sal-stored VH, 5 of 25 (20 %) for UW, and 1 of 19 (5 %) for Ter (Sal vs. UW and Sal vs. Ter: P< 0. 01; UW vs. Ter: NS).

40|$|Fragestellung: Für die Dokumentation am Patientenbett werden zunehmend Computer im Operationssaal und auf Intensivstationen eingesetzt. 2001 wurden Computer verdächtigt, als Keimreservoir zu fungieren und mitverantwortlich für das Entstehen von nosokomialen Infektionen (NI) zu sein. Ziel dieser Arbeit war es, Computer im Operationssaal und auf zwei Intensivstationen (operativ und pädiatrisch) hinsichtlich ihrer bakteriologischen und mykologischen Verunreinigung zu untersuchen. Des Weiteren wurde das Computerinnere sowohl auf seine physikalischen Eigenschaften wie {{relative}} Luftfeuchtigkeit (r. F.) und Temperatur (T), als auch auf die durch die Lüfter des Computers erzeugte Luftgeschwindigkeiten (LG) hin untersucht. Methoden: Sterile Abstriche wurden an fünf verschiedenen Stellen, davon drei innerhalb und zwei außerhalb des Computergehäuses an insgesamt n= 38 Computern genommen. Quantitative und qualitative mikrobiologische Untersuchungen sowie die Messung der r. F., der T und der LG wurden entsprechend herkömmlicher Methoden durchgeführt. Ergebnisse: Insgesamt wurden 190 Abstriche unter drei verschiedenen Wachstumsbedingungen für bakteriologische und mykologische Wachstum kultiviert, so dass 570 Analysen mikrobiologisch analysiert wurden. Bei sämtlichen Untersuchungen konnten keine oder keine ausreichend hohe Belastungen mit potentiell pathogenen Bakterien oder Pilzen nachgewiesen werden (Keimbelastung unterhalb der Nachweisgrenze oder zu geringe Keimbelastung, um potentiell pathogen zu wirken). Bei Messungen der T wurden min. 23, 8 °C und max. 34, 1 °C gemessen, die r. F. betrug min. 5 % und max. 30 %, die LG lag zwischen 0, 56 und 2, 48 m/s. Schlussfolgerungen: Die Besiedelung von Computern mit potentiell pathogenen Mikroorganismen scheint nicht relevant zu sein, um als Reservoir für pathogene Mikroorganismen zu fungieren. Darüber hinaus lassen die gemessenen physikalischen Eigenschaften kein oder nur geringes Wachstum von potentiell pathogenen Mikroorganismen erwarten. Somit gibt es keinen Anhalt dafür, dass die Keimbelastung von Computern bei der Übertragung von potentiell pathogenen Keimen und der Auslösung von NI eine Rolle spielen. Objective: Computers {{are becoming}} increasingly present in operating rooms (OR) and intensive care units (ICU) for use in bedside documentation. 2001, computers have been suspected as possibly acting as reservoirs for microorganisms and vehicles for the transfer of pathogens to patients, causing nosocomial infections. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the microbiological (<b>bacteriological</b> and mycological) <b>contamination</b> of the central unit of computers (CUC) used in an OR, and two ICUs (a surgical and a pediatric ICU). Further the physical properties inside a central unit of computers like relative humidity (r. h.) and temperature (T) as well as the airspeed (AS) produced by the used coolerventilator inside the central unit were examined. Methods: Sterile swab samples were taken from five different sites, three inside and two on the outside of the CUC from a total of n= 38 CUC. Quantitative and qualitative microbiological analyses as well as measuring the r. h., the T and the As were performed according to commonly used methods. Results: A total of 190 sites were cultured under three different cultureconditions for bacterial and fungal growth, so that you had a total of 570 culture vessels. In all analyses we did not find any or any significant number of potentially pathogenic bacteria or fungi. The examination of the T showed a min. of 23. 8 °C and a max. of 34. 1 °C, for the r. h. ranged from 5 % to a max of 30 % and the AS was between 0. 56 and 2. 48 m/s. Conclusion: The amount of pathogenic microorganism contamination present in the central units of OR and ICU computers is insufficient for designating them as a reservoir for pathogenic microorganisms. The physical environment inside the CUC show an environment in which one wouldnt expect a growth of potential pathogenic microorganism. Concluding that there is no evidence that a contamination with pathogenic microorganism of CUC is given or plays a role as a conductor for pathogenic microorganism and there for to cause exogenic nosocomial Infections...|$|R

Methods A prospective cohort study was conducted using 235 households (647 individuals) randomly selected from four rural hamlets. Data were collected by means of a self-administered questionnaire, a self-report diary of symptoms and two drinking water samples. Results Twenty percent of households sampled, had indicator bacteria (total coliform or Escherichia coli (E. coli)) above the current Canadian and United States standards for safe drinking water. No statistically significant associations between indicator bacteria and AGII were observed. The odds ratio (OR) for individuals exposed to E. coli above the current standards was 1. 52 (95 % confidence interval (CI), 0. 33 – 6. 92), compared to individuals with levels below current standards. The odds ratio estimate for individuals exposed to total coliforms above the current standards was 0. 39 (95 % CI, 0. 10 – 1. 50).
