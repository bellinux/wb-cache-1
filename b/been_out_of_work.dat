5|$|As {{popular as}} their {{cartoons}} were with 1960s audiences, they were disliked by artists. Television programs had lower budgets than theatrical animation, and this economic reality caused many animation studios {{to go out}} of business in the 1950s and 1960s, putting many people in the industry out of work. Hanna–Barbera was key in the development of limited animation, which allowed television animation to be more cost-effective, but also reduced quality. Hanna and Barbera had first experimented with these techniques {{in the early days of}} Tom and Jerry. To reduce the cost of each episode, shows often focused more on character dialogue than detailed animation. The number of drawings for a seven-minute cartoon decreased from 14,000 to nearly 2,000, and the company implemented innovative techniques such as rapid background changes to improve viewing. Reviewers criticized the change from vivid, detailed animation to repetitive movements by two-dimensional characters. Barbera once said that their choice was to adapt to the television budgets or change careers. The new style did not limit the success of their animated shows, enabling Hanna–Barbera to stay in business, providing employment to many who would otherwise have <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>work.</b> Limited animation became the standard for television animation, and continues to be used today in television programs such as The Simpsons and South Park.|$|E

Hiring halls typically are found in major seaports.|$|E

In 2010, according to World Bank statistics, 37% of all unemployed women were long-run unemployed workers, or workers who have <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> for more than one year.

500|$|During his Senate campaign, Butler {{spoke out}} forcefully about the {{veterans}} bonus. Veterans of World War I, {{many of whom}} had <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> {{since the beginning of the}} Great Depression, sought immediate cash payment of Service Certificates granted to them eight years earlier via the World War Adjusted Compensation Act of 1924. Each Service Certificate, issued to a qualified veteran soldier, bore a face value equal to the soldier's promised payment, plus compound interest. The problem was that the certificates (like bonds), matured 20 years from the date of original issuance, thus, under extant law, the Service Certificates could not be redeemed until 1945. In June 1932, approximately 43,000 marchers—17,000 of whom were World War I veterans, their families, and affiliated groups—protested in Washington, D.C. The Bonus Expeditionary Force, also known as the [...] "Bonus Army", marched on Washington to advocate the passage of the [...] "soldier's bonus" [...] for service during World War I. After Congress adjourned, bonus marchers remained in the city and became unruly. On July 28, 1932, two bonus marchers were shot by police, causing the entire mob to become hostile and riotous. The FBI, then known as the United States Bureau of Investigation, checked its fingerprint records to obtain the police records of individuals who had been arrested during the riots or who had participated in the bonus march.|$|E

In Series 5, Pete suspects that Jo may have married him as a visa scam to stay in Britain. Their relationship is damaged and Jo sleeps with a colleague on a work weekend away. Pete asks her for a divorce when he finds out. Jo was devised when Bullen and Harries wanted Pete {{to fall in love with}} an Australian woman so they could film the Series 4 finale in Sydney. Kimberley Joseph was based in Los Angeles and had <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> for 18 months before getting an audition with Spencer Campbell. Two weeks later she had moved to Manchester and was doing read-throughs with the rest of the cast. Joseph thought Bullen had envisioned the character as a coarse [...] "big fat truck-driving lesbian type" [...] before he met her. Thomson thought Pete's lust for Jo was a rebound from Jenny and that, while Jo genuinely liked Pete, she did not actually love him, which Pete suspects when he reads Jo's emails in Series 5, Episode 2.|$|E

2500|$|On May 27, 1846, Governor Thomas Drew {{issued a}} {{proclamation}} calling for volunteers {{to fight in}} the Mexican War. The war drew volunteers from every strata of society, including two of the most famous Arkansans of the period, former governor Archibald Yell, who was serving in the U.S. House of Representatives, and Albert Pike, a prominent Little Rock lawyer. Yell left Washington and enlisted in Solon Borland’s company in Little Rock as a private. Albert Pike was serving as the commander of the [...] "Little Rock Guards" [...] which answered the governor’s call as a cavalry unit. Arkansas Militiamen were represented by George Morrison, who joined out of necessity. Morrison stated that he joined Pike’s company because he had <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> and needed the salary of $10 per month. After a round of speechmaking and picnics, a rendezvous was set at Washington in Hempstead County. Twenty-two companies of cavalry and seven companies for infantry answered the governor's call. From these militia units, two new commands were formed, the Arkansas Regiment of Mounted Volunteers, which would deploy to Mexico, and the Arkansas Battalion of Infantry and Mounted Rifles, which would serve along the western frontier, replacing federal troops being utilized in the war effort. By the middle of June 1846 the Arkansas troops were organized. [...] Judging from the number of weapons drawn, the companies initially ranged in size from sixty to seventy-one men. [...] By June 20 the Arkansas troops were marching to Washington, Arkansas, which was their designated rendezvous point. [...] The sleepy little village of Washington was awash with activity as troops from all across the middle South stopped to rest and organize into larger units. [...] When it came time to elect the regimental commanders, the Arkansas troops had a choice of two men: Albert Pike and Archibald Yell. [...] Pike, a good militia commander and outstanding jurist, politician, and author, was a leader of the Whig Party in Arkansas. [...] Pike, like the Whig Party in general, was opposed to the war in Mexico. [...] Still, Pike took his militia responsibilities seriously and muted his criticism of the war. [...] Pike's politics, combined with his aristocratic bearing and reputation as a stern disciplinarian, resulted in the election of Yell as colonel. [...] A [...] Democratic United States Congressman at the outbreak of the war, Archibald Yell resigned his seat to join the Arkansas troops. [...] Although an influential politician, he had neither military training nor the willingness to learn. [...] The election of Yell was to result in disaster for the Arkansas volunteers later in the war. [...] Two other prominent Democrats, John S. Roane and Solon Borland, were elected lieutenant colonel and major, respectively.|$|E
