40|$|The {{generation}} of metachronal waves of beating cilia {{is a complex}} mechanism when reproduced in laboratory experiments. In addition, local manipulation of cilia in larger arrays becomes non-trivial when the beating patterns are not unidirectional. Herein, a more complex pattern of beating cilia is studied, where the cilia perform an orbital tip motion and rows of these cilia are counter-rotating in a traveling wave-like actuation. Interest {{in this type of}} potential fluid transport results from technical applications where localized streaks of directional flow need to be produced and the speed and direction of the fluid transport is open to be manipulated. A simple solution is found to generate the corresponding traveling wave and beating patterns using a base-layer actuation of a membrane covered with artificial cilia. A device is built where such a wave is generated mechanically using a <b>ball</b> <b>chain</b> positioned below the membrane. When the <b>ball</b> <b>chain</b> is moved, the elevation leads to an orbital beating pattern of the tips of the cilia on top of the membrane. This beating shows characteristics of non-symmetric motion in terms of fast and slow motion phases in the orbital cycle. When the <b>ball</b> <b>chain</b> is positioned centered between parallel rows of the cilia and moved parallel to the rows, a well-defined directional fluid transport is generated in the gap. Micro-PIV revealed that successive traveling waves generate a steady streaming transport along the rows of the cilia as a combination of the fluid squeezing and streaming components. Changing the direction and speed of the <b>ball</b> <b>chain</b> is possible and allows the localized fluid transport in speed and direction to be altered. 2 D Arrays of piston-like actuators {{in the form of a}} grid of balls may give further full control of position and direction of transport pathways along the ciliary surface. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry...|$|E

40|$|Harsh {{environment}} acoustic emission and {{ultrasonic wave}} sensing applications often benefit from placing the sensor {{in a remote}} and more benign physical location by using waveguides to transmit elastic waves between the structural location under test and the transducer. Waveguides are normally designed to have high fidelity over broad frequency ranges to minimize distortion - often difficult to achieve in practice. This thesis reports on an examination of using nonlinear <b>ball</b> <b>chain</b> waveguides for the transmission of acoustic emission and ultrasonic waves for the monitoring of thermal protection systems undergoing severe heat loading, leading to ablation and similar processes. Experiments test the nonlinear propagation of solitary, harmonic and mixed harmonic elastic waves through a copper tube filled with steel and elastomer balls and various other waveguides. Triangulation of pencil lead breaks occurs on a steel plate. Data are collected concerning the usage of linear waveguides and a water-cooled linear waveguide. Data are collected from a second water-cooled waveguide monitoring Atmospheric Reentry Materials in UVM 2 ̆ 7 s Inductively-Coupled Plasma Torch Facility. The motion of the particles in the dimer waveguides is linearly modeled with a three ball and spring chain model {{and the results are}} compared per particle. A theoretical nonlinear model is presented which is capable of exactly modeling the motion of the dimer chains. The shape of the waveform propagating through the dimer chain is modeled in a sonic vacuum. Mechanical pulses of varying time widths and amplitudes are launched into one end of the <b>ball</b> <b>chain</b> waveguide and observed at the other end in both time and frequency domains. Similarly, harmonic and mixed harmonic mechanical loads are applied to one end of the waveguide. Balls of different materials are analyzed and discriminated into categories. A copper tube packed with six steel particles, nine steel or marble particles and a longer copper tube packed with 17 steel particles are studied with a frequency sweep. The deformation experienced by a single steel particle in the dimer chain is approximated. Steel ball waveguides and steel rods are fitted with piezoelectric sensors to monitor the force at different points inside the waveguide during testing. The corresponding frequency responses, including intermodulation products, are compared based on amplitude and preloads. A nonlinear mechanical model describes the motion of the dimer chains in a vacuum. Based on the results of these studies it is anticipated that a nonlinear waveguide will be designed, built, and tested as a possible replacement for the high-fidelity waveguides presently being used in an Inductively Coupled Plasma Torch facility for high heat flux thermal protection system testing. The design is intended to accentuate acoustic emission signals of interest, while suppressing other forms of elastic wave noise...|$|E
40|$|The first {{recorded}} experiments describing the phenomena made popular by Newton’s cradle {{appear to be}} those conducted by Edme Mariotte around 1670. He was quoted in Newton’s Principia, along with Wren, Wallis and Huygens as having conducted pioneering experiments on the collisions of pendulum balls. Each of these authors concluded that momentum (then described as the “quantity of motion”) is conserved when one ball collides with another. Mariotte’s collision experiments were presented to the French Academy of Sciences in 1671 and subsequently published in 1673 as “Traité de la percussion ou choc des corps ”. The treatise was included in a larger volume of his work, titled “Oeuvres de Mr Mariotte”, published by the Academy in 1717, describing his discovery of the blind spot {{in the eye and}} the relation between pressure and volume for gases, as well as many other studies on plants, planets, strength of materials and fluid mechanics. 1 - 3 Newton was inadvertently credited with the modern version of the executive toy that bears his name, and it is still being described as “Newton’s cradle ” even by physicists 4. It is interesting to read the original account of the experiments conducted by Mariotte and his explanations of the effects observed. Unfortunately, the original 17 th Century French treatise appears not to have been translated into English. Mariotte’s short account of his <b>ball</b> <b>chain</b> experiments is translated here by the author into a slightly modernised English version in the interests of clarity. Figures 17 and 18 referred to in the text are those published in the 1717 edition of Mariotte’s work.
