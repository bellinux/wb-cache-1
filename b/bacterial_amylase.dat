40|$|The {{effects of}} {{different}} pelleting temperatures on {{the activity of}} cellulase, <b>bacterial</b> <b>amylase,</b> fungal amylase, and pentosanase were tested. Samples of a commercial barley-wheat-soybean diet containing different enzyme preparations were pelleted at 60, 70, 80, 90, and 100 C (pellet temperature measured at the die outlet) through a die containing holes 2. 5 mm in diameter. Enzymatic analyses were conducted on either soluble substrates or by measuring {{the ability of the}} tested enzymes to decrease the viscosity of the diet. Measurements made on soluble substrates suggest that cellulase, fungal amylase, and pentosanase maintained activity when being pelleted at temperatures up to 80 C and <b>bacterial</b> <b>amylase</b> maintained activity at temperatures up to 90 C. Pentosanase and amylases showed little or no effect on the viscosity of the diet. Cellulase addition decreased the viscosity at all temperature levels, even after being pelleted at 90 and 100 C (P < 0. 05). No cellulolytic activity was detected on the soluble substrate after these pelleting temperatures. Measurements on a soluble substrate might therefore not always reflect the true stability of a preparation because the ability of a carbohydrase to decrease the viscosity of the digesta is important to its effect in the gastrointestinal tract. Measurements on soluble substrates suggest that cellulase, fungal amylase, and pentosanase can be pelleted at temperatures up to at least 80 C and <b>bacterial</b> <b>amylase</b> up to 90 C without a considerable loss in analyzed activit...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Enzymes are {{commonly}} used in the baking industry, as they can improve dough quality and texture and lengthen the shelf life of the final product. There is little published information highlighting exposure to enzymes (other than fungal alpha-amylase) in the baking industry, therefore {{the purpose of this}} study was to identify antibodies and develop assays for the measurement of a variety of such enzymes in samples of airborne flour dust. Methods: Polyclonal antibodies to <b>bacterial</b> <b>amylase,</b> glucose oxidase and amyloglucosidase were identified and developed into ELISA assays. The assays showed limited cross-reactivity with other enzymes commonly used in the baking industry. Results: We measured levels of airborne enzymes in 195 personal air samples taken from a sample of 55 craft baking establishments. We were able to detect amyloglucosidase in 9 % (16 / 184) of the samples, fungal alpha-amylase in 6 % (11 / 171), bacterial alpha-amylase in 7 % (13 / 195). However, we were unable to detect glucose oxidase in any of the samples. Measurements for protease enzymes were not carried out. Median levels in detectable samples of amylogluc-osidase, fungal alpha-amylase and <b>bacterial</b> <b>amylase</b> were similar at 10. 3, 5. 3 and 5. 9 ng/m 3, respectively.

40|$|Specific enzymes {{have been}} used to improve flour quality for bread but enzyme action in tortilla flour has not been investigated. Two {{different}} wheat flours were prepared into tortillas using laboratory-scale, commercial equipment with fixed processing parameters. Dough and tortilla properties were evaluated using subjective and objective methods. Tortillas were stored in plastic bags at 22 ????C for evaluation. The effects of nine enzymes (amyloglucosidase 1, amyloglucosidase 2, bacterial 1, bacterial 2, fungal, maltogenic 1, maltogenic 2, malted barley and xylanase) on quality of wheat flour tortillas were evaluated. Dough absorption was adjusted to attain uniform dough for tortillas. Enzyme addition to tortilla flour did not significantly affect tortilla weight, moisture and pH. <b>Bacterial</b> 2 <b>amylase</b> extended shelf stability while maltogenic 1 and xylanase exhibited smaller improvements in shelf stability and other tortilla properties. Addition of 0. 05 activity unit <b>bacterial</b> 2 <b>amylase</b> improved tortilla diameter and improved tortilla shelf life from 12 to 28 days. Maltogenic 1 at 280 ppm improved tortilla diameter, opacity and shelf life. Addition of 100 ppm of xylanase effectively improved tortilla diameter and shelf life. <b>Bacterial</b> 1 <b>amylase</b> at 60 ppm improved tortilla diameter but did not improve shelf stability. Amyloglucosidase 2, maltogenic 2 and malted barley amylase did not improve tortilla quality at any of the evaluated levels. Amyloglucosidase 1 and fungal amylase reduced overall tortilla quality at all the evaluated levels. Bread-making quality of wheat flour is correlated with the damaged starch present in the flour. Damage was induced by grinding the samples for 0, 1, 4 and 8 hr {{to determine the effects of}} starch damage on tortilla quality. Processing increased starch damage of control tortilla flour from 5. 4 % to 12. 6 %. Damage starch increased dough water absorption, toughness and press rating and reduced diameter and opacity of tortillas. Damage starch improved tortilla rollability at higher levels but did not improve tortilla properties in combination with <b>bacterial</b> 2 <b>amylase.</b> Overall tortilla quality was not improved due to additional starch damage.

40|$|An alkalophilic bacterium, Bacillus sp. strain GM 8901, {{grown at}} pH 10. 5 and 50 (deg) C, {{produced}} five alkaline amylases in culture broth. At {{an early stage}} of the <b>bacterial</b> growth, <b>amylase</b> I (Amyl I) was produced initially and then, as cultivation progressed, four alkaline amylases, Amyl II, Amyl III, Amyl IV, and Amyl V, were produced from proteolytic degradation of Amyl I. A serine protease present in the culture medium was believed to be involved in Amyl I degradation. We purified Amyl I from the culture supernatant by ammonium sulfate precipitation, heparin-Sepharose CL- 6 B column chromatography, phenyl-Toyopearl column chromatography, and Mono Q HR 5 / 5 high-performance liquid chromatography. The molecular weight of Amyl I was estimated to be about 97, 000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Amyl I had an extremely high optimal pH of 11. 0 to 12. 0 and was stable in a broad pH range of 6. 0 to 13. 0. Amyl I had an optimal temperature of 60 (deg) C and was stable up to 50 (deg) C. Thermostability was increased in the presence of Ca(sup 2 +) and soluble starch. The enzyme required metal ions such as Ca(sup 2 +), Mg(sup 2 +), Cu(sup 2 +), Co(sup 2 +), Ag(sup+), Zn(sup 2 +), and Fe(sup 2 +) for its enzyme activity and was inhibited by 1 mM EDTA and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. According to the mode of action of Amyl I on starch, Amyl I was classified as an (alpha) - and exo-amylase.

From a theoretical as well as a practical view-point it appeared desirable to evaluate proteolytic enzyme production by a number of bacterial isolates of proved amylase-producing ability. Accordingly, from the group of Bacillus subtilis isolates described by Peltier and Beckord (1945) some 63 amylase producers were selected for further study. METHODS The methods used for evaluating proteolytic activity were of the survey type, one utilizing the liquefaction of gelatin by culture stabs and the other three the clearing of protein suspended in agar, by filtrates from isolates cultured on an appropriate "complete " medium. All isolates were maintained on wheat bran extract agar (Peltier and Beckord, 1945).

30|$|In {{relation}} {{to the amount of}} biofilm formed by S. mutans, a considerable decrease in biofilm was detected in GIC-THEO samples. Similar results were observed when the inclusion of 0.1 % epigallocatechin- 3 -gallate (EGCG) was tested in a conventional GIC, with a reduction in the amount of biofilm formed on the modified GIC specimens (Hu et al. 2013). It is suggested that the antibacterial action of theobromine may be related to additional factors, such as the reduction of bacterial adhesion (Percival et al. 2006; Hu et al. 2013; Sudharsana and Srisakthi 2015), inhibition of glucosyltransferase enzyme secreted by cariogenic bacteria, which reduces biofilm formation and acid production of S. mutans (Hu et al. 2013), suppression of saliva and <b>bacterial</b> <b>amylase</b> activity, causing alteration in carbohydrate metabolism, which reduces the rate of acid production by S. mutans or causing irreversible damage to the cytoplasmic membrane of bacteria (Matsumoto et al. 2004). Thus, we consider that the addition of theobromine empowered the antimicrobial effect of GIC.|$|E

40|$|Background and Purpose: Amylases {{are most}} {{important}} industrial enzymes that account for about 30 % of the worldâs food, feed, fermentation, textile, detergent and cellulosic industries. This study aimed at optimum production of thermostable Î±-amylase via moderate thermophilic bacterium (Bacillus licheniformis) which was recently isolated from Qinarje Hot spring. Material and Methods: Initially, ability of bacterium for amylase activity was determined by starch hydrolysis test using Gramâs iodine staining. Then bacterial growth pattern and amylase production curves in basal production medium were graphically determined at different time intervals. Finally, effect of different temperature, pH, carbon source, nitrogen source, minerals and inoculum size were studied on <b>bacterial</b> growth and <b>amylase</b> production using turbidimetric and DNS method, respectively. Results: Optimum enzyme production achieved after 84 hours of inoculation from cultures growing at 40 ËC and pH 9. 0 in a medium containing 0. 03 % (w/v) of CaCl 2, compared to the basal medium, {{results showed that the}} best enzyme production happened with inoculum size of 4 % (v/v). The addition of 1 % (w/v) rice husk (as a Carbon source) enhanced enzyme productivity up to 160 % and substitution of the peptone and yeast extract with 1 % (w/v) of tryptone (as a Nitrogen source) increased the Î±-amylase production up to 160 %. Conclusion: Our findings show that B. licheniformis-AZ 2 strain has an ability to produce the thermostable Î±-amylase which is suitable in starch processing and food industries.

40|$|Introduction:Â Alpha-amylase is an {{important}} commercialized enzyme among theÂ starch-hydrolyzing ones. Â The <b>bacterial</b> <b>amylase</b> is widely utilized in various sectors of industry due to its advantages to amylases derived from plant or animal sources. Also the use of agricultural products and their residues as inexpensive fermentation substrates has high impact on minimizing the cost of Î±-amylase production. The principle {{aim of this study}} is to optimize Î±-amylase production by Bacillus amyloliquefaciens using low cost agricultural resources with Response Surfaces Methodology (RSM). Materials and methods: The Effect ofÂ different amounts of the carbonÂ sourceÂ (extract of pea) andÂ nitrogenÂ sourceÂ (cotton seed cake) onÂ production of Î±-amylase by B. amyloliquefaciensÂ using statisticalÂ methods of RSM was studied. Carbon and nitrogen sources were considered in 5 levels during theÂ submergedÂ fermentation and used central composite rotatable design with 10 experiments. Results: The best conditions for maximum production of Î±-amylase by B. amyloliquefaciens were pea extract of 75 g/L and cotton seed cake of 33. 3 g/L, so that in these conditions the enzyme production rate was 69. 74 Uml- 1.

40|$|Protein {{engineering}} on hotspot residues {{is acknowledged}} {{as an effective}} way to improve the stability and activity of enzymes. Searching for the key spot of a protein is a critically important but time-consuming process. In our previous study, an InDel site neighbouring residue Lys 209 of the deep sea <b>bacterial</b> <b>amylase</b> AMY 121 was proposed as one putative determinant for thermostability by homology sequence comparison and biochemical analysis [1]. Here, the structural stabilizing role of residue Lys 209 was verified, and semi-rational protein design was applied to further improve capacity of higher temperature adaptation. Systematic mutagenesis study on Lys 209 of amylase AMY 121 revealed that all of the nineteen substitution mutants on the 209 th site led to stability loss compared with wild type enzyme, indicating the crucial role of residue Lys 209 in protein structural stabilizing. Four Lys 209 neighboring sites were then selected and site directed saturation mutagenesis libraries were constructed for high through put thermostability screening. Two thermostability enhanced mutants Y 187 E and K 205 L were obtained from 1600 mutant colonies. Temperature properties comparison of wild type AMY 121 and its variants showed Y 187 E and K 205 L possessed better kinetic thermal stability. The optimum temperature Y 187 E and K 205 L both increased by 5 degrees C. T- 50 (15) values of Y 187 E and K 205 L also increased to 0. 63 and 8. 52 degrees C, respectively. Structural basis for the difference in thermostability of wild type enzyme and its variants was further analyzed by computer modeling, and increasing in number of salt bridges and hydrophobic interactions around Lys 209 was proposed as the main driving force for better compact protein structure of the enzyme.

40|$|Tergal glands play a {{key role}} in German {{cockroach}} precopulatory behavior. Tergal gland secretion contains phagostimulatory sugars and phospholipids that encourage female feeding and arrest the female in a position favorable for mating to proceed. SDS-PAGE separation of proteins occurring in tergal secretion revealed four main proteins of approximately 23, 45, 63, and 94 kDA (molecular size). Comparison of these four proteins with ubiquitous surface proteins resulted in identification of a â¼ 63 kDa putative tergal gland-secreted protein (bla 63). Following purification and tryptic digestion, two peptides corresponding to bla 63 were sequenced and shared putative amino acid identity with known Î±-amylases from two bacteria: Halomonas meridiana and Pseudomonas sp. A 2, 051 nucleotide cDNA encoding a full-length Î±-amylase was obtained by RACE PCR. Sequencing of clones revealed a 1, 497 nucleotide open reading frame encoding a protein of 498 amino acids (aa) with a predicted isoelectric point of 6. 5 and a predicted secretory signal peptide of 18 aa. The primary structure of bla 63 shares sequence similarity with known Î±-amylases in seven conserved protein sequence regions common to all known Î±-amylases. Alignment of the deduced protein sequence of bla 63 with five insect amylases from Apis mellifera mellifera, Diabrotica virgifera virgifera, Diatraea saccharalis, and Tenebrio molitor showed in 58. 4 â 55. 1 % sequence identity. Sequence identity with human salivary amylase and a <b>bacterial</b> <b>amylase</b> were 50. 1 and 42. 8 %, respectively. Northern hybridization of total RNA from tergal gland tissue with a 32 P-labeled bla 63 probe resulted in hybridization to an RNA of â¼ 2000 bases.

40|$|The use of enzymes for hydrolysing starch in cane juices {{has been}} applied in South Africa for some years. Bacterial amylases, notably those derived from Bacillus subtilis, have the {{advantage}} of stability at higher temperatures. Factory trials have shown that application of less than 10 ppm of <b>bacterial</b> <b>amylase</b> can destroy over 85 % of the starch in mixed juice in fifteen minutes. Applications of enzymes to syrup and clarified juice have also yielded promising results. Historical The process of decomposition of starch in cane juice {{has been applied}} many times during the history of sugar production. Haddon and de Sornay reported on the high starch content of Uba cane in 1927. 9, 10 A year later Haddon reported the removal of starch from sorghum and Uba juice by the use of a malt amylase. " ^ l 2 Feuilherade reported on the experimental use of an enzyme "Uba~e". ~ Though the source of this enzyme was not disclosed, it appears that the price was in the region of four rand per pound. The enzyme was apparently of low activity as it had to be used at a rate of 100 ppm on juice. Feuilherade assumed that the starch was completely transformed into glucose, and based a quantitative determination on this assumption. Boyes 2 used malt enzyme for the decomposition of cane starch in juices and massecuites, but found that the price remained prohibitive for general application. In 1958 Nicholson and Horsley published the presence of an amylase in cane juice, and described a method for the elimination of cane starch in juice. 14 These authors reported a degree of starch decomposition of 80 - 90 %, and occasionally even higher, at a temperature of 70 Â°C and a pH 5. 7 to 5. 9. The "natural enzyme " method was used experimentally at various sugar factories in Natal and adopted as a standard practice by The Tongaat Sugar C~mpany. ~ Carter 6 published results with this process in which 50 to 60 % of the starch originally present was decomposed at a pH of 6. 5 in eight minutes. In the 1967168 season the average amount of starch decomposition was 70 % 4. During the 1967168 season several other South African sugar factories started to apply the natural enzyme process...|$|E
