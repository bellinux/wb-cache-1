40|$|In this paper, we are {{to present}} a {{practical}} application of Axiomatic Design (AD) methodology as a roadmap to lean production, in a car <b>body</b> <b>assembly</b> <b>line.</b> In addition to product development, AD has already been applied for manufacturing system design but we tend to expand its application to production system design, which besides manufacturing includes all activities required to satisfy customer needs. AD theory provides a framework to simplify the whole problem. According to the AD principles, a hierarchical structure for conceptualization of lean philosophy has been developed. This structure originates in lean manufacturing principles. We argue that three essential bases of lean production are organizational capabilities, technological capabilities, and value stream analysis, represented as top DPs in the structure. These basic capabilities are interdependent and self-reinforcing. Among these DPs, organization capabilities would take priority over other others because implementation lean practices in a company require a lean organization. Therefore, DP 2 'Developing required organizational capabilities for lean production ' is decomposed to lower levels first. This is performed by means of zigzagging. Having completed conceptually the production system design through AD, we have developed an operational procedure for implementation practices. The main stages of the procedure are 1) Develop a lean strategy. 2) Train the employees. 3) Eliminate non-essential infrastructural resources. 4) Performance measurement. 5) Establish a baseline. 6) Identify opportunities. 7) Prioritize opportunities. 8) Develop and implement the lean improvement plan. 9) Measure, monitor, and improve. 10) Hold the gains. 11) Strive for perfection. While the hierarchical structure act as a guideline, the procedure specifies the course of actions. both {{of them could be}} applied for other applications. We are trying to redesign this production system based on the conceptual model, represented as AD structure, as well as the operational procedure...|$|E

The objective in this project is to identify the problem that always happens in line assembly. Then improve the problem in line assembly to overcome from the problem arise. Hence make a comparison and find a solution about body assembly to improve the problem from the data analysis. At body assembly process there are several problem could happen such as miss the spot part, dent or hump, scratch, spatter burr and hole to the body during assembly. But the major problem happen at line assembly is spot weld and men mistake. By using 4 M method which includes machine, method, material and man, this problem can be identify easily and effected. As a result there are some problem {{that contributes to the}} problem happen such as logistic problem which involve the wrong part delivery and wrong shipment. Besides that, man power and workability also be the problem to the line assembly. Lack of discipline, behaviour and competency of worker give a worse impact to the company. Wrong workability involves many of tools, machine and man power and affected the production and flow in line assembly. Spot welding becomes a problem when the current voltage supply is not enough and it can work properly.

40|$|The {{application}} of robotic U-shaped line layouts {{is becoming more}} important for manufacturing companies. Compared to straight <b>assembly</b> <b>line</b> layouts, U-shaped <b>assembly</b> <b>lines</b> result in cost savings, easier material handling and higher production rates. The {{reason for this is}} that U-shaped lines improve visibility and skill sharing between operators, increase production quality, reduce work in process inventory and facilitate problem-solving of appearing production failures which is shown in several researches. Key companies such as Toyota and Boeing are using U-shaped <b>assembly</b> <b>lines</b> to benefit from the advantages of U-shaped line layouts. However, few breakdown strategies are designed especially for U-shaped lines even though machine breakdowns are common. Breakdowns reduce the throughput rate and product quality and therefore strategies are needed which can ensure the targeted throughput and product quality of companies during breakdowns. In this thesis a breakdown strategy IS designed for a robotic U-shaped line which uses versatile backup robots on backup stations to cover the failures of workstation robots. Versatile backup robots are only considered in one prior study for a straight line layout and, in that study, the backup robots demonstrated a better performance than other breakdown strategies used for straight lines. The concept of backup stations with versatile robots is adapted to the robotic U-shaped line layout to identify whether backup robots can be an efficient breakdown strategy for robotic U-shaped lines. This adaptation is the placement of the backup stations between the arms of the U-shaped line layout. An automotive <b>body</b> shop <b>assembly</b> <b>line</b> configuration is selected for the U-shaped line layout. Ten workstations are used in the line configuration. Four positions exist for the placement of backup stations. Each combination of workstations and placement positions have been analyzed to find the most efficient backup strategy for line configuration designed. The analysis starts with the one backup station, then considers two backup stations and finally three backup stations on the four possible placement options. The best option of the one, two and three backup stations are compared with four backup stations and the current breakdown strategies which are the usage of manual repair stations only and the workload reallocation of broken robots by working robots downstream the line. The criteria for the performance comparison are the cycle time and product quality which are generated for a 5 %, 10 % and 15 %-line breakdown. For the generation of the criteria, a genetic algorithm is used which is modified from a straight line layout to the robotic U-shaped line backup strategy and current breakdown strategies. The analyses of the best placement options for the one, two, three and four backup stations options identify that the three and four backup stations options have the best cycle time and product quality for breakdowns, because they cover each workstation without the use of manual repair stations. It is shown that the three backup stations option is the best choice for the designed automotive <b>body</b> shop <b>assembly</b> <b>line</b> configuration. The three backup stations option has the same cycle time and product quality as the four backup stations option, but it uses one less backup station. Furthermore, the robotic U-shaped line backup strategy using three backup stations has a much better performance than the current breakdown strategies. Its cycle time for breakdowns is half as much as the cycle time of the current breakdown strategies and the robotic U-shaped line backup strategy does not use manual repair stations that generate a high product quality consciously. Due to these facts, the robotic U-shaped line backup strategy is an efficient breakdown strategy for the robotic U-shaped line, because it ensures production with a smooth line flow, a continuously high product quality and the avoidance of work in process inventories for breakdowns. Nevertheless, the robotic U-shaped line backup strategy has three major disadvantages. The first disadvantage is that the backup robots have to be maintained after each operating period to ensure that they do not break down. The next disadvantage is the requirements of an intelligent conveyor system so that the backup station can be accessed without disrupting the material flow when a breakdown occurs. The last disadvantage is that the backup robots have to been equipped with several possibly costly tools, to cover the workstation robots. The final decision on which backup strategy to use is therefore conditional on the cost of equipment, but this study can easily be extended to include these factors when the data is available. ...|$|R

It is a fundamental problem in continuous production line, and it is one of the difficult optimization problems. Installing <b>assembly</b> <b>line</b> is a long-term decision and required high capital investments. Hence, it is very important to design the <b>assembly</b> <b>line</b> and balance the workload on the workstations. The <b>assembly</b> <b>line</b> has to be rebalanced periodically or if there is a change in the production plan or process. Based on the strategic goals of the manufacturers, the performance measures have to be carefully chosen, since balancing decisions have a long term effect. Due to the technological advancements, human workforce is replaced by robots to perform the tasks in an <b>assembly</b> <b>line.</b> Different robots with different capacity and specialization are available to perform the assembly task, hence it is required to choose the best fit robot among the available robots such a way that it helps in improving the productivity of the <b>assembly</b> <b>line.</b> Robotic <b>assembly</b> <b>line</b> balancing (RALB) problem aims at assigning the tasks to workstation and allocate robot for each workstation in {{such a way that the}} productivity is improved. Very few researchers have proposed models for balancing a robotic <b>assembly</b> <b>line.</b> The main objective of this research is to develop efficient algorithms to solve robotic <b>assembly</b> <b>line</b> balancing problems. RALB problem is NP-hard, since the basic version of <b>assembly</b> <b>line</b> balancing problems falls under this category. To solve problem of this nature it is necessary to use metaheuristic algorithms. RALB problems with different objective functions are proposed and solved. The objectives considered for the RALB study are: minimizing cycle time, minimizing energy consumption, minimizing <b>assembly</b> <b>line</b> cost and maximizing line efficiency of a robotic <b>assembly</b> <b>line.</b> Straight and U-shaped RALB problems are considered. The results obtained for the two <b>assembly</b> <b>line</b> problems are compared. RALB problem with an objective of minimizing cycle time is solved using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and hybrid models of PSO and efficient metaheuristics. Two allocation procedures are used for allocating tasks and robots in the <b>assembly</b> <b>line.</b> PSO and its variants are the metaheuristics proposed to solve the RALB problem. PSO is also hybridized with Genetic Algorithm and Cuckoo search to solve RALB problem. Proposed algorithms are able to produce better results when compared with the benchmark results reported in the literature. Manufacturing industries give importance to the reduction of energy consumption due to the increase in energy cost and to create an eco-friendly environment. Due to the importance of reducing energy consumption in an <b>assembly</b> <b>line,</b> an energy based RALB problem is proposed. RALB problem with an objective of minimizing energy consumption for straight and U-shaped robotic <b>assembly</b> <b>line</b> is proposed. Particle swarm optimization algorithm is the metaheuristic used to solve the proposed model. Cost reduction is one of the important tasks for the manufacturing companies throughout the world. In this thesis, a cost based RALB problem is also proposed. The objective considered in this problem is to minimize the <b>assembly</b> <b>line</b> cost.

This difficulty increases the complexity of the cost-oriented multi-manned <b>assembly</b> <b>line</b> balancing problems with respect to the multi-manned <b>assembly</b> <b>line</b> balancing problems addressed in the literature...|$|R
40|$|Assembly is {{a process}} by which subassemblies, {{manufactured}} parts and components are put together to make the final products. <b>Assembly</b> <b>lines</b> are flow-oriented production systems which are still typical in the industrial production of high quantity standardized commodities and even gain importance in low volume production of customized products. In the most common statement of the <b>assembly</b> <b>line</b> balancing problem, a set of work elements having fixed duration times is to be assigned {{to a set of}} sequential workstations. A set of precedence relationships indicates the restrictions on the performing order of each work element. The <b>assembly</b> <b>line</b> balancing problem arises and has to be solved when an <b>assembly</b> <b>line</b> has to be configured or redesigned. It consists of distributing the total workload for manufacturing any unit of the product to be assembled among the workstations along the line. In a production system made up of several branched manufacturing and/or <b>assembly</b> <b>lines,</b> the balancing of lines is a frequent problem. In this study, fuzzy logic methodology is used to approximate <b>assembly</b> <b>line</b> balancing problem, and the effect of three factors, as human, raw materials and technology, on <b>assembly</b> <b>line</b> balance is examined...|$|R

The Sequencing {{is an important factor}} for an efficient use of Mixed Model <b>Assembly</b> <b>Lines.</b> We resolved the sequencing problem in favor of minimizing the total cost and keeping uniform usage of each part and cost model is presented. To get merits and demerits between Mixed Model <b>Assembly</b> <b>Line</b> and Flexible <b>Assembly</b> <b>Line,</b> a comparison is done, concerning sequencing problem. The outcome of this research suggests best sequence, which gives continued consumption of parts and cost saving as well, reducing cycle time would provide higher production...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} <b>assembly</b> <b>line</b> balancing and selection of the best inspection policy. Different inspection policies yield different manufacturing, reworking, inspection and external failure costs. While in literature <b>assembly</b> <b>line</b> balancing and inspection policy design have usually been addressed as different problems, they are strongly interrelated. Inspection tests requires time to be performed and thus their assignation directly influences {{the results of the}} <b>assembly</b> <b>line</b> balancing procedure, that is the number of stations that are necessary and hence the line installation cost. Provided what said above, the advantage of integrating inspection policy design in <b>assembly</b> <b>line</b> balancing appears clear, but to our knowledge there is not such a model yet. In this paper a new model that defines simultaneously inspection policy and <b>assembly</b> <b>line</b> balancing is presented...|$|R

30|$|U-type line {{balancing}} was first invented by Miltenburg and Wijngaard (1994). The U-type <b>assembly</b> <b>line</b> {{is an attractive}} substitute for assembly production systems from the time operators became multi-skilled by performing tasks defined on different parts of <b>assembly</b> <b>line</b> (Gökçen et al. 2005). The advantage of the U-type <b>assembly</b> <b>line</b> is the flexibility that it offers to choose an appropriate number of operators to satisfy demand changes (Aigbedo and Monden 1997).|$|R
