40|$|The {{performance}} of a 16 -stage axial-flow compressor, in which two modifications of unloaded inlet stages were combined with loaded exit stages, has been determined. In the first modification the exit stages were loaded by decreasing the twelfth through fifteenth stage stator angles 3 deg. {{as compared with the}} <b>blade</b> <b>angles</b> in the original compressor, and the inlet stages were unloaded by increasing the <b>blade</b> <b>angles</b> the following amounts: guide vanes and first-stage stator, 6 deg; second- and third-stage stators, 4 deg.; and fourth-stage stators, 3 deg. The over-all {{performance of}} this configuration was compared with that of the compressor with the original <b>blade</b> <b>angles.</b> The peak efficiency was increased at all speeds below design and the weight flow was higher at speeds below 80 percent of design, the same at 80 percent of design, and lower at speeds abovce 80 percent of design. The maximum reduction in weight flow occurred at design speed. The surge limit line was higher at speeds between 75 and 90 percent of design when presented on a pressure ratio against weight flow basis. The second configuration was the same as the first with the exception that the second-, third-, and fourth-stage stator <b>blade</b> <b>angles</b> were the same as in the compressor with the original <b>blade</b> <b>angles.</b> A comparison of the performance of this configuration with that of the compressor with the original <b>blade</b> <b>angles</b> showed the same general trends of changes in performance as the first configuration. Comparisons were made of compressor configurations to show the effects upon the performance of decreased loading in the inlet stages. Below 75 percent of design speed, decreased loading results in increased weight flow and peak efficiency; above 80 percent of design speed, decreased loading in the inlet stages results in decreased weight flow and small changes in peak efficiencies. Between 75 and 90 percent of design the changes in surge weight flow and pressure ratio were such that the surge limit line was raised with decreased loading in the inlet stages when presented as pressure ratio against weight flow...|$|R

They stated that the airplane would have [...] "become very difficult to control after the propeller reached the 22-degree stop.

5000|$|The {{power of}} both engines was {{controlled}} by a single [...] "power lever" [...] in all flight regimes. To provide crisp thrust control during hover, movement of the power lever caused a direct adjustment of <b>blade</b> <b>angle,</b> analogous to the collective pitch control of a helicopter, with the propeller cpu governor making a follow-up adjustment of <b>blade</b> <b>angle</b> to maintain the selected rpm.

50|$|In {{the history}} of {{development}} of aircraft {{it became apparent that}} it is necessary to improve performance. One of the influential factors was the propeller design in relation to the most efficient <b>blade</b> <b>angle.</b> The first propellers were fixed pitch and if the propeller <b>blade</b> <b>angle</b> is set to give good take off and climb performance, the propeller would be inefficient in cruising flight because the blade would be at too low an angle.

It starts with a generic model, which is valid {{for all types of}} soil (sand, clay and rock) after which the specifics of dry sand, water saturated sand, clay, rock and hyperbaric rock are covered. For each soil type small <b>blade</b> <b>angles</b> and large <b>blade</b> <b>angles,</b> resulting in a wedge in front of the blade, are discussed. The failure mechanism of sand, dry and water saturated, is the so called Shear Type. The failure mechanism of clay is the so called Flow Type, but under certain circumstances also the Curling Type and the Tear Type are possible. Rock will usually fail in a brittle way. This can be brittle tensile failure, the Tear Type, for small <b>blade</b> <b>angles,</b> {{but it can also be}} brittle shear failure, which is of the Shear Type of failure mechanism for larger <b>blade</b> <b>angles.</b> Under hyperbaric conditions rock may also fail in a more ductile way according to the Flow Type of failure mechanism. For each case considered, the equations/model for the cutting forces, power and specific energy are given. The models are verified with laboratory research, mainly at the Delft University of Technology, but also with data from literature.

40|$|A 0. 4 m {{diameter}} {{horizontal axis}} Marine Current Turbine (MCT) was {{tested in a}} circulating water channel. The model was designed to facilitate variable speed operation with full pitching blades to simulate off design point operational conditions. The power output was measured over a range of flow speeds from 1. 2 ms- 1 to 2. 8 ms- 1. Rotor torque and thrust were calculated using axial momentum theory. Experimental results were compared with the output of a commercial BEM computer package named Bladed supplied by Garrad Hassan & Partners Ltd.

The model is equipped with landing configuration settings at an angle of attack of 0 ° and flaps extended. The objective is to investigate flow phenomena occurring in the flow immediately upstream and downstream of a propeller at thrust reverse. In this respect a region of half a diameter of the outboard propeller is scanned using a traverse for both the laser light sheet and the four CCD cameras, in addition several measurements are performed at differ-ent phases of the propeller rotation. The fluid mechanical properties of the flow around two different propeller blade settings are investigated and compared {{for their ability to}} deliver negative thrust, i. e. thrust reverse.
