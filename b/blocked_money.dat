One day, a linguist finds an old African Legend (although {{the nature of the}} story appears to be stereotypically Ottoman) in which a village that stands in the heart of Africa is inhabited by people for whom a beverage made for eggs is a necessity. A merchant arrives at the town with eggs and auctions them off for large <b>blocks</b> of <b>money,</b> as the natives very badly need their eggs. He returns each week with eggs, pricing them higher, and the natives end up giving him fortunes for the eggs, until one day, when they realise how they are letting the merchant get rich off of their gullibility, and cheat the system by having only one man (who requests 10 piastres for the whole cartload) appear at the next auction. The principals realise how they are having the same problems with their students that the Africans had with the eggs, and this system is abolished.

40|$|One of {{the biggest}} criticisms leveled at defined {{contribution}} individual account (IA) components of social security systems {{is that they are}} too expensive. This paper investigates the cost-effectiveness of two alternative methods for constructing mandatory IAs: 1) investing through the retail market with relatively open choice, which is the method first used by Chile and adopted by most Latin American countries and 2) investing through the institutional market with constrained choice among investment companies. Our question: what is the most cost-effective way to organize IAs that are part of a mandatory social security system? For the retail market we use data from mandatory pension funds in Chile and other Latin American countries and from voluntary mutual funds in the US. For the institutional market we use data from IA systems in Bolivia and Sweden and from large pension plans and the federal Thrift Saving Plan in the U. S. These institutional approaches aggregate numerous small accounts into large <b>blocks</b> of <b>money</b> and negotiate fees on a centralized basis, often through competitive bidding. Choice by workers remains, among a limited number of funds. But fees and costs are kept low by reducing incentives for marketing, avoiding excess capacity {{at the start of the}} new system, and constraining choice to investment portfolios that are inexpensive to manage. In developed financial markets the biggest potential cost cuts stem from constrained portfolio choice, especially from a concentration on passive investment. The biggest cost saving for a given portfolio and for countries with weak financial markets comes from reduced marketing activities...|$|R

Generally, self-published books, as well as manuscripts and books printed with movable type, were exempt from censorship. Unfortunately, the book was banned in the same year the last volume was published. The government confiscated the printed books as well as the printing blocks, and placed Shihei under house arrest.

In developed financial markets, the biggest potential cost saving stems from constrained portfolio choice, especially from a concentration on passive investment. The biggest cost saving for a given portfolio and for countries with weak financial markets comes from reduced marketing activities. In the retail market, where annualized fees and costs range from 0. 8 percent to 1. 5 percent of assets, use of the institutional market in individual retirement account systems has reduced those fees and costs to less than 0. 2 percent to 0. 6 percent of assets. This reduction can increase pensions by 10 - 20 percent relative to the retail market. Countries that can surmount rebidding problems, weaker performance incentives, inflexibility in the face of unforeseen contingencies, and an increased probability of corruption, collusion, and regulatory capture should seriously consider the institutional approach, especially at the start-up of a new multipillar system or for systems with small asset bases.
