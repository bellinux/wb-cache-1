25|$|The {{more closely}} we look into history, the more clearly shall we {{perceive}} {{that the system}} of chivalry is an invention almost entirely poetical. It is impossible to distinguish the countries {{in which it is}} said to have prevailed. It is always represented as distant from us both in time and place, and whilst the contemporary historians give us a clear, detailed, and complete account of the vices of the court and the great, of the ferocity or corruption of the nobles, and of the servility of the people, we are astonished to find the poets, after a long lapse of time, adorning the very same ages with the most splendid fictions of grace, virtue, and loyalty. The Romance writers of the twelfth century placed the age of chivalry in the time of Charlemagne. The period when these writers existed, is the time pointed out by Francis I. At the present day , we imagine we can still see chivalry flourishing in the persons of Du Guesclin and Bayard, under Charles V and Francis I. <b>But</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> to examine either the one period or the other, although we find in each some heroic spirits, we are forced to confess {{that it is necessary to}} antedate the age of chivalry, at least three or four centuries before any period of authentic history.|$|E
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> {{to call to}} {{mind the}} last words of parties who took the trouble to make the proper {{preparation}} for the occasion, we immediately notice a happy difference in the result.|$|E
6000|$|... "The late Mr. Matthew Vassar," [...] said he, [...] "was truly a benefactor to his kind, {{and a man}} {{worthy of}} all respect; <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> to {{consider}} {{the way in which}} the leading circles of society are made up--" ...|$|E
60|$|There {{were three}} parcels, two {{very small and}} one pretty big, lying on the table, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> to look for names there were none.|$|R
6000|$|... "Was awfully afraid you'd think <b>we</b> were fresh, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> in last night, and {{saw your}} car--didn't like {{the looks of}} the hotel much, and thought we'd stick around." ...|$|R
60|$|The Bart was {{of opinion}} {{that this was}} the best that <b>we</b> could do, <b>but,</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> to talk it over, the Abbot made us see that there were {{difficulties}} in the way.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know that}} you have all engaged in this affair for love of Sir Marmaduke or myself, and because you hate to see a loyal gentleman made the victim of lying knaves; <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> back with the king, you may be sure that Sir Marmaduke and I will well reward the {{services}} you have rendered." ...|$|E
60|$|This view {{does not}} seen to involve any {{necessary}} contradiction with itself {{or with the}} accepted facts of Logic. <b>But,</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> to test it, as applied to the actual facts of life, we shall find I think, that it fits in with them so badly that its adoption would be, {{to say the least}} of it, singularly inconvenient for ordinary folk.|$|E
6000|$|... 'When {{will he be}} back?'--she kept on {{fiercely}} {{repeating the}} question; and then burst out,--'Curse you gentlemen all! Cowards! you are all in a league against us poor girls! You can hunt alone when you betray us, and lie fast enough then? <b>But</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> for justice, you all herd together like a flock of rooks; and turn so delicate and honourable all of a sudden--to each other! When will he be back, I say?' ...|$|E
60|$|Harold came, {{and stood}} towering above {{us with his}} hands in his pockets; <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> to the Temptation of Eve, Dora broke out into an exclamation that excited my curiosity too much not to be pursued, though it was hardly edifying.|$|R
6000|$|When {{you asked}} them {{the price of}} their wares they always said, [...] "Au plaisir" [...] i. e., {{whatever}} you please; <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> to offer them money, we found [...] "au plaisir" [...] meant so much at any rate, and as much more as they could get.|$|R
6000|$|The Spaniard flung {{his arms}} up when Austin {{translated}} this. [...] "Who knows?" [...] he said. [...] "I am only an ignorant sailorman, and cannot tell; <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> here the SeÃ±or Austin promised {{us that we}} should have all that was reasonable. It is not fitting that men should die and nothing be done to save them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wait! Yes, {{and what}} has come of waiting? We don't wait at all in {{doubling}} our population every thirty-three years; <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> to the feeding of them we are always for waiting. It is that waiting which has reduced the intellectual development of {{one half of the}} human race to its present terribly low state--or rather prevented its rising in a degree proportionate to the increase of the population. No more waiting for me, mother, if I can help it." ...|$|E
60|$|So also in {{that same}} sweet valley, of which I have just been speaking, between Chamouni and the Valais, at every turn of the {{pleasant}} pathway, where {{the scent of the}} thyme lies richest upon its rocks, we shall see a little cross and shrine set under one of them; and go up to it, hoping to receive some happy thought of the Redeemer, by whom all these lovely things were made, and still consist. <b>But</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> near--behold, beneath the cross, a rude picture of souls tormented in red tongues of hell fire, and pierced by demons.|$|E
60|$|Doctrine, therefore, {{does not}} cause dissensions; rather a {{doctrine}} alone can cure our dissensions. It is necessary to ask, however, roughly, what abstract and ideal shape in state or family would fulfil the human hunger; and this apart from whether we can completely obtain it or not. <b>But</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> to ask what is the need of normal men, what is the desire of all nations, what is the ideal house, or road, or rule, or republic, or king, or priesthood, then we are confronted with a strange and irritating difficulty peculiar to the present time; and we must call a temporary halt and examine that obstacle.|$|E
60|$|We passed those seas {{with less}} {{difficulty}} {{than in other}} places, the winds {{to the south of}} Java being more variable, and the weather good, though sometimes we met with squally weather and short storms; <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> in among the Spice Islands themselves we had a share of the monsoons, or trade-winds, and made use of them accordingly.|$|R
5000|$|However, {{the truth}} is the photo does not spell any message at all in semaphore. Robert Freeman {{confirms}} this: [...] "I had the idea of semaphore spelling out the letters HELP. <b>But</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> to do the shot the arrangement of the arms with those letters didn't look good. So we decided to improvise and ended up with the best graphic positioning of the arms." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Only your brother, Myers, my dear; {{somehow or}} other, {{we made a}} mistake in our figures, which made out a demand in his favor of $100,000. I paid it in property, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> to look over the figures it was {{discovered}} that a cypher too much had been thrown in, and Myers paid back the difference like a man, as he is." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think, Hilda, that {{although}} the matter cannot be decided, it certainly points to your theory that this man is not the John Simcoe who left Stowmarket twenty years ago. He attempted, and I think very cleverly, to establish his identity by a visit to Stowmarket, and no doubt did so to everyone's perfect satisfaction; <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> {{to go into the}} thing step by step, we see that everything he did might have been done by anyone who happened to have a close resemblance to John Simcoe in figure and some slight resemblance in face, after listening for three days to Miss Simcoe's gossip." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, it's {{very well}} to say [...] "don't" [...] Miss Floy,' {{returned}} the Nipper, much exasperated; 'but raly begging your pardon we're coming to such passes that it turns all the blood in a person's body into pins and needles, with their pints all ways. Don't mistake me, Miss Floy, I don't mean nothing again your ma-in-law who has always treated me as a lady should though she is rather high I must say not that I have any right to object to that particular, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> to Mrs Pipchinses and having them put over us and keeping guard at your Pa's door like crocodiles (only make us thankful that they lay no eggs!) we are a growing too outrageous!' ...|$|E
60|$|Point {{the second}} - I am rejoiced indeed {{to hear you}} speak so kindly of my work; rejoiced and surprised. I seem to myself a very rude, left-handed countryman; not fit to be read, far less complimented, by a man so accomplished, so adroit, so craftsmanlike as you. You will happily never have cause to {{understand}} the despair with which a writer like myself considers (say) the park scene in Lady Barberina. Every touch surprises me by its intangible precision; and the effect when done, as light as syllabub, as distinct as a picture, fills me with envy. Each man among us prefers his own aim, and I prefer mine; <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> to speak of performance, I recognise myself, compared with you, to be a lout and slouch of the first water.|$|E
5000|$|The {{album cover}} shows the Beatles {{with their arms}} {{positioned}} to spell out a word in flag semaphore. According to cover photographer Robert Freeman, [...] "I had the idea of semaphore spelling out the letters [...] "HELP". <b>But</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> to do the shot, {{the arrangement of the}} arms with those letters didn't look good. So we decided to improvise and ended up with the best graphic positioning of the arms." ...|$|R
5000|$|Some {{songs were}} already written before I joined, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> {{back from the}} US tour with Testament last year, we started writing the last songs, which became [...] "Bury Your Dead", [...] "Leech", [...] "Trespass" [...] and [...] "Revelation". Jonas, Anders or Jensen will bring in riffs, or a verse and chorus, and all the members can then have their input {{on the way the}} song will go. Per Möller Jensen ...|$|R
60|$|In short, I {{hired the}} honest {{man and his}} horse; <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> to a town upon the road (I do not {{remember}} the name of it, but it stands upon a river), I pretended myself very ill, and I could go no farther that night but if he would stay there with me, because I was a stranger, I would pay him for himself and his horse with all my heart.|$|R
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> to {{the last}} test of nationality, the test of art and letters, the case is almost terrible. The English colonies have {{produced}} no great artists; and that fact may prove {{that they are still}} full of silent possibilities and reserve force. But America has produced great artists. And that fact most certainly proves that she is full of a fine futility and the end of all things. Whatever the American men of genius are, they are not young gods making a young world. Is the art of Whistler a brave, barbaric art, happy and headlong? Does Mr. Henry James infect us with the spirit of a schoolboy? No; the colonies have not spoken, and they are safe. Their silence may be the silence of the unborn. But out of America has come a sweet and startling cry, as unmistakable as the cry of a dying man.|$|E
6000|$|... "Your {{observations}} are quaint," [...] said Mr Tippet, with a smile; [...] "but {{there is a}} great deal of truth in them. No doubt, the connection of such ideas, especially as put by you, sounds a little ludicrous; <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> to analyse them, we see their possibility, for, if a lever of the size indicated by the ancient philosopher were erected (and theoretically, the thing is possible), then the subordinate arrangements as to a line of railway and stations, etcetera, would be mere matters of detail. It might be advertised, too, that the balance of the lever would be so regulated, that, on the arrival of the train at the terminus, the world would rise (a fact which might be seen by the excursionists, by the aid of enormous telescopes, much better than by the people at home), and that, on the return of the train, the world would again sink to its ancient level.|$|E
60|$|Now Byron had {{a sensational}} {{popularity}}, and that popularity was, {{as far as}} words and explanations go, founded upon his pessimism. He was adored by an overwhelming majority, almost every individual of which despised the majority of mankind. <b>But</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> to regard the matter a little more deeply we tend in some degree to cease to believe in this popularity of the pessimist. The popularity of pure and unadulterated pessimism is an oddity; it is almost a contradiction in terms. Men would no more receive {{the news of the}} failure of existence or of the harmonious hostility of the stars with ardour or popular rejoicing than they would light bonfires for the arrival of cholera or dance a breakdown when they were condemned to be hanged. When the pessimist is popular it must always be not because he shows all things to be bad, but because he shows some things to be good.|$|E
60|$|The people cheered also {{and made}} jests, saying that I should soon {{practice}} astrology in the palace. But, {{as soon as}} we might, I and my uncle escaped, and made our way back to the house. All the while he rated me for my rashness; <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> to the chamber of the house he embraced me and rejoiced greatly, because I had overthrown the giant with so little hurt to myself.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes; he was {{to teach}} Bertha. We found him helping the little Sandbrook to slide, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> he sent him in with the little maid, and gave Bertha a lesson, which did not last long, for she grew nervous. Really her nerves will never be what they were! Then Maria begged for a slide, {{and you know what}} any sort of {{monotonous}} bodily motion is to her; there is no getting her to leave off, and I never saw anything like the spirit and good-nature with which he complied.' ...|$|R
60|$|Soon, {{another shot}} was fired, and the cow fell. Leaving {{some of the}} natives {{to look after the}} dead cattle, the rest of us hurried on after the bull; his dreadful bellowing guiding us to the spot where he lay. Wounded in the shoulder, in his fright and agony he had bounded into the wood; <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> up to him, he had sunk to the earth in a green hollow, {{thrusting}} his black muzzle into a pool of his own blood, and tossing it over his hide in clots.|$|R
6000|$|... "In that, we are {{perfectly}} of a mind; for, if {{there be any}} thing that betrays a consciousness of inferiority, it is our rendering others of so much obvious importance to ourselves, as to make them the subjects of our constant conversation. We may speak of virtues, for therein we pay an homage to that which is good; <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> to dwell on personal faults, it is rather a proof {{that we have a}} silent conviction of the superiority of the subject of our comments to ourselves, either in character, talents, social position, or something else that is deemed essential, than of our distaste for his failings. Who, for instance, talks scandal of his grocer, or of his shoemaker? No, no, our pride forbids this; we always make our betters the subject of our strictures by preference, taking up with our equals only when we can get none of a higher class." ...|$|E
6000|$|The maxim in {{question}} is, {{that if one}} collection is part of another, the one which is a part has fewer terms than the one {{of which it is}} a part. This maxim is true of finite numbers. For example, Englishmen are only some among Europeans, and there are fewer Englishmen than Europeans. <b>But</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> to infinite numbers, this is no longer true. This breakdown of the maxim gives us the precise definition of infinity. A collection of terms is infinite when it contains as parts other collections which have just as many terms as it has. If you can take away some of the terms of a collection, without diminishing the number of terms, then there are an infinite number of terms in the collection. For example, there are just as many even numbers as there are numbers altogether, since every number can be doubled. This may be seen by putting odd and even numbers together in one row, and even numbers alone in a row below:-- ...|$|E
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> to {{the cases}} {{of the same species}} inhabiting two of the more widely {{separated}} islands, the difficulty is much increased. Borneo is distant nearly 150 miles from Biliton, which is about fifty miles from Banca, and this fifteen from Sumatra, yet there are no less than thirty-six species of mammals common to Borneo and Sumatra. Java again is more than 250 miles from Borneo, yet these two islands have twenty-two species in common, including monkeys, lemurs, wild oxen, squirrels and shrews. These facts seem to render it absolutely certain that there has been at some former period a connection between all these islands and the mainland, and {{the fact that most of}} the animals common to two or more of then, show little or no variation, but are often absolutely identical, indicates that the separation must have been recent in a geological sense; that is, not earlier than the Newer Pliocene epoch, at which time land animals began to assimilate closely with those now existing.|$|E
6000|$|... "Lead on," [...] he cried, [...] "show it to us." [...] He {{went ahead}} with me, {{travelling}} so fast that I must needs run to keep up, and fairly lifting me over the logs. <b>But</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> in sight of the place he darted forward alone and went through it like a hound on the trail. The others followed him, crying out {{at the size of}} the place and poking among the ashes. At length they all took up the trail for a way down the creek. Presently Clark called a halt.|$|R
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> to Madrid, <b>we</b> {{being all}} of us strangers to Spain, were willing to stay some {{time to see the}} court of Spain, and to see what was worth observing; but it being {{the latter part of the}} summer, we hastened away, and set out from Madrid about the middle of October; <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> to the edge of Navarre, we were alarmed, at several towns on the way, with an account that so much snow was fallen on the French side of the mountains, that several {{travellers}} were obliged to come back to Pampeluna, after having attempted, at an extreme hazard, to pass on.|$|R
60|$|June 20.--We settled {{this morning}} {{to go to church}} at Lochore, that is, at Ballingray; <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> to the earthly paradise so called, we were let off for there was no sermon, for which I could not in my heart be sorry. So, after looking at Lochore, back <b>we</b> <b>came</b> to lounge and loiter about till dinner-time. The rest of the day was good company, good cheer, and good conversation. Yet to be idle here is not the thing, and to be busy is impossible, so I wish myself home again in spite of good entertainment. We leave to-night after an early dinner, and I will get to work again.|$|R
