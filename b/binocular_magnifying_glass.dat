The method of research used was the observation and the collected material was examined in detail, both rough and preserved, using the <b>binocular</b> <b>magnifying</b> <b>glass.</b> The detailed images were taken with a digital camera provided with a magnifying device. The discovery of this species is of major importance for the flora of our country and that is the reason for its detailed description below. We present the new data about the Trifolium hirtum species in Romania, which consist in some additions to its description and in the proposal of a dichotomy key for its determination and a chorology map with its distribution in Romania. The identification of the species can be made easily by using the key of determination proposed by us, especially as we have not found one in the relevant research literature. On the other hand there are certainly other locations where the species exist and this could be the object of our future research...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. Although {{advanced}} adhesive {{systems are}} in use, marginal microleakage {{is one of}} the greatest problems of contemporary restorative dentistry. Objective. The aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the influence of different bonding agents on the marginal sealing quality of class II amalgam restorations. Methods. Forty freshly extracted human premolar and molar teeth were divided into four groups with 10 teeth in each one. Class II preparations were prepared and different adhesives were applied as follows: group I - Amalgam Liner® (Voco); group II - ONE-STEP® PLUS (Bisco); group III - PQ 1 (Ultradent). Group IV was used as a control, without any bonding agent. Amalgam (Cavex Non Gamma 2, Cavex) was hand-condensed into each preparation. Specimens were thermocycled 200 times at the following temperatures: 5 - 7 °C, 37 °C and 57 - 59 °C, and were then immersed into 1 % solution of gentian violet for 72 hours. The teeth were sectioned longitudinally and microleakage was graded in the area of the gingival and occlusal quantity rim using a <b>binocular</b> <b>magnifying</b> <b>glass</b> with 25 times magnification. Results. The highest microleakage was recorded in the Amalgam Liner group; 1526. 0 μm at the gingival wall and 694. 5 μm at the occlusal cavity wall. The lowest dye penetration was observed in the PQ 1 group; 589. 5 μm at the gingival wall, and 599. 9 μm at the occlusal wall of the restoration. ANOVA test showed that there was a statistically significant difference of dye penetration values at the gingival wall among all examination groups (p< 0. 01). No statistically significant differences were found comparing microleakage values at the occlusal wall. Conclusion. Results of this study showed that the best marginal sealing was accomplished by using the PQ 1 bonding agent...|$|E
40|$|Aim: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the influence of the smear layer on the coronal microleakage in root canals obturated with laterally condensed cold gutta-percha or Thermafil and two root canal sealers. Materials and methods: Sixty extracted single-rooted human teeth with straight root canals were allocated to two experimental groups. The root canals were instrumented using the STEP-BACK technique, K reamers and K files and irrigated with 2. 5 % NaOCl. The teeth in the first group were treated with 17 % EDTA and 2. 5 % NaOCl to remove the smear layer. The teeth in both groups were obturated either with laterally condensed cold guttapercha (28 teeth) or Thermafil gutta-percha with plastic cores (28 teeth) and RSA or AH-PLUS sealers. The specimens were evaluated for coronal microleakage using silver nitrate solution. The linear penetration of the dye was assessed using a <b>binocular</b> <b>magnifying</b> <b>glass</b> (x 25), with an inserted micrometer scale. Results: The results showed low coronal microleakage in the group where the smear layer was removed in both the lateral compaction technique (RSA - 1. 71 mm and AHPLUS - 1. 61 mm) and the Thermafil groups - RSA (1. 65 mm) and AH-PLUS (1. 66 mm). In the group with the intact smear layer, greater microleakage was noticed in both groups, lateral compaction technique -RSA (3. 06 mm) and AH-PLUS (2. 83 mm) and Thermafil technique -RSA (2. 99 mm) and AH-PLUS (2. 83 mm). The difference was statistically significant between the groups with and without the smear layer for both RSA (p< 0. 001) and AH-PLUS sealers (p< 0. 001). Conclusion: The present results suggest that the removal of the smear layer significantly improves the tightness of the coronal seal and reduces the coronal microleakage...|$|E

40|$|Development of the {{abdominal}} musculature of Hynobius nebulosus was studied by dissection under <b>binocular</b> <b>magnifying</b> <b>glass</b> and by serial sections, partly stained with some his tochemical methods, the emphasis being laid oa {{the origin of}} the transverse abdominal muscle. Differentiation of the dorsal trunk musculature derived from myotomes is performed in "the dorsal Growth-Zone", and this form of muscle-differentiation is common to that of the ven tral trunc musculature derived from the ventral myotome processes. The internal oblique mescle and the external oblique muscle are derived respectively from the inner and the external la yer of "the ventral Growth-Zone" which appears at the ventrolateral region of the early developed ventral trunk musculature. The former grows ventrally, the latter dorsally from the ventral end of the former. The rectus abdominis muscle is also formed from the veatral end of the "Growth-Zone", and grows medially from the ventral end of both oblique muscles. After the above mentioned muscles have completely differentiated, "the sabvertebral Growth-Zone" appears in the subvertebral triangular region between Chorda and the ventro nedial part of the internal oblique muscle. In this region the subvertebral muscle is formed. At the same time the transverse abdominal muscle d in the narrow space between the internal oblique muscle and Peritoneum, {{but it is difficult to}} decide whether the Growth-Zone from which the transverse abdominal muscle is derived belongs to the internal oblique muscle or Peritoneum as the space is very narrow. It mav ba sure that the taaisverse abdominal muscle has closely relation to the internal oblique muscle as both muscles differentiate at the same time. The rectus lateralis muscle dsvelops in "the Growth-Zone in the lateral line" and remaining superficial muscles of trunk also develop superficially on the precedingly differentiated trunk musculature by the same way as above mentioned muscle-differentiation...|$|E
40|$|The main {{prerequisite}} {{for a successful}} treatment of pulp disease in apex periodontium is knowledge of morphological characteristics of root canal system, especially one third of his apex. The aim of this work was to define the exact distance of the main and auxiliary openings {{from the top of}} medial and distal roots of the first lower permanent molars. Methods: as a research material it was used a hundred extracted first lower molars of the patients of both gender, divided into three age groups. The analysis of the one third of apex was done with the help of <b>binocular</b> <b>magnifying</b> <b>glass</b> and digital roentgenography analysis half of the samples, which were filed with capillary contrast. Results: The results obtained showed that the longest average distance of the main opening from the top of medial root was 0. 84 mm, and the shortest was 0. 61 mm; while for the distal root the longest average distance was 0. 89 mm, and the shortest was 0. 62 mm. Maximum distance of the auxiliary openings from the top of medial root in the first group was 3. 5 mm, and the maximum distance of the auxiliary openings from the top of distal root was 2, 5 mm. The results obtained with digital rentgenography showed that the longest average distance of the main opening from the top of medial root was the one noticed in the second age group (0. 91 mm) then the one from the first group (0, 83), and the shortest one in the third age group (0, 71 mm); as for the distal root: the longest average distance of the main opening {{from the top of the}} root was noticed in the third age group (0, 95 mm) then in the first (0, 90 mm) and than shortest in the second age group (0, 89 mm). Conclusion: The distance of the main and auxiliary openings from the top of medial and distal root of the first lower molar varies in the range from 0 to 3, 5 mm and it depends on the tooth age. ...|$|E
40|$|Textural {{sandstone}} anisotropy {{is related}} to the selective deterioration of such stone in buildings. &# 13; The samples studied come from the Cathedrals of Salamanca. &# 13; Stone fragments, cut in different directions with regard to the base supporting the ashlars in the wall, are studied by means of a <b>binocular</b> <b>magnifying</b> <b>glass</b> and the Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). &# 13; This shows that the sandstone microfabric has a granular and a laminar microtexture, which correspond to different directions in the plane in question as regards the position of the ashlar. Either of these circumstances coincides with the stone surface {{on the outside of the}} building and affect its surface deterioration in a different way. &# 13; The SEM images of deteriorated stone were compared with those of unaffected stone, with both types coming from differently orientated cuts as regards the position of the ashlar. In conclusion, the position given to the block of stone in the building is of importance for the preservation of the stone. &# 13; The speed of ultrasound transmission measured in samples from commercial quarries confirms the textural sandstone anisotropy to a greater or lesser extent. La anisotropía textural de las areniscas se relaciona con la selectividad de su deterioro en los edificios. &# 13; Las muestras estudiadas pertenecen a las Catedrales de Salamanca. &# 13; Fragmentos de piedra, cortados en direcciones diferentes respecto a la base sobre la que se asientan los sillares en el muro, son estudiados por medio de la lupa binocular y del microscopio electrónico de barrido (SEM). &# 13; De éstos se deduce que la microfábrica de las areniscas tiene una microtextura granular y otra laminar, que corresponden a direcciones diferentes del plano respecto al asiento del sillar. Una u otra de estas situaciones coincide con la superficie de la piedra expuesta al exterior en el edificio, y afectan a su deterioro superficial de forma diferente. Las capas externas en las que predomina la arcilla tienen menos resistencia a los agentes de alteración. &# 13; Las imágenes del SEM de los cortes en piedras deterioradas se compararon con los de piedras no deterioradas, y ambos en direcciones diferentes respecto al asiento del sillar, deduciendo que la posición dada al bloque de piedra en el edificio es importante para su conservación. &# 13; La velocidad de transmisión de ultrasonidos, medida en muestras de cantera comercial, confirma la anisotropía textural de las areniscas, en mayor o menor grado...|$|E

40|$|Dental amalgam {{is still}} the {{material}} most commonly used to restore posterior teeth in many countries. Amalgam is very popular because of its strength, longevity, low cost, and relative ease of handling compared to other direct restorative materials. Two important disadvantages of amalgam restaurations are lack of adhesion to tooth structure and marginal leakage. Introduction of dentin adhesive systems enabled better marginal seal between amalgam and tooth structure. Aim: The {{aim of this study}} was to estimate, in vitro conditions, the marginal seal of amalgam restaurations with dentin adhesive systems using the method of diffusion dye. Material and methods: In this study 50 extracted human teeth were used. Class II cavities were prepared on all the teeth. The teeth were divided in five groups and materials applied according to manufacturer’s instructions: Gamabond, Optibond Solo, OptiGuard, Ionosit - Base Liner and control group. All the teeth were thermocycled 200 times, at temperatures: 5 - 7 ºC, 37 ºC and 57 - 59 ºC. Method of diffusion dye was used to estimate the quality of marginal seal of amalgam restaurations. All teeth were immersed into 50 % solution of silver nitrate, and then into 10 % developing solution. All teeth were cut with a diamond disc in the meso - distal plane. Penetration dye was estimated using <b>binocular</b> <b>magnifying</b> <b>glass</b> that magnifies 25 times, with inserted micrometar scale. Results were statistically analysed with Student t - test. Results: The least penetration dye was recorded in the group of amalgam restaurations rebonded with OptiGuard. Higher penetration dye was noted in the groups of adhesive amalgam restaurations, where Gamabond showed lower penetration dye in comparison with Optibond Solo. Penetration dye in the group Ionosit - Base Liner was higher than in the groups where dentin adhesive systems were used: on the occlusal wall, penetration dye in comparison with Gamabond showed statistically significant difference, (p < 0, 5) while penetration dye in comparison with Optibond Solo showed no statistically significant difference. On the gingival wall, penetration dye in comparison with dentin adhesive systems - Gamabond and Optibond Solo, showed a statistically significant difference, (p < 0, 01). The highest penetration dye was in the control group. Conclusion: The best marginal seal of amalgam restaurations was achieved with OptiGuard. Use of dentin adhesive systems also provided good marginal seal, with better results from Gamabond compared to Optibond Solo. Using Ionosit - Base Liner good marginal seal on the occlusal wall was also accomplished, while penetration dye on the gingival wall showed a statistically significant difference in comparison with adhesive and rebonding amalgam restaurations...|$|E
