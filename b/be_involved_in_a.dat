5|$|During the season, the Rangers were {{interested}} in acquiring Vancouver Canucks forward Pavel Bure. It was reported that Canucks general manager Brian Burke had requested Malhotra to <b>be</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> trade that would have sent him along with Niklas Sundstrom, Dan Cloutier and the Rangers' first-round pick in the 1999 draft in exchange for Bure. However, Rangers general manager Neil Smith refused to include Malhotra and the deal never materialized.|$|E
5|$|Orci and Kurtzman {{also worked}} {{together}} as executive producers on the animated television series, , {{due to their}} involvement with the live action movies. Following {{the end of the}} series they were hopeful to <b>be</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> future animated series based on the premise, which Orci saw less like a reboot of the show and more of a continuation in a different guise. He felt that while Prime was sophisticated, there were concerns that it was leaving younger viewers behind because of its complexity and intensity.|$|E
5|$|Grant's Civil Service Commission {{had limited}} success. Some cabinet members {{implemented}} a merit system that {{increased the number}} of qualified candidates and relied less on Congressional patronage. Delano, however, exempted his department from competitive examinations, and Congress refused to enact permanent Civil Service reform. Zachariah Chandler, who succeeded Delano in 1875, reformed the Interior Department and fired corrupt clerks in the Bureau of Indian Affairs. The same year, Grant fired Attorney General George Henry Williams after his wife was discovered to <b>be</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> bribery scandal, and appointed reformer Edwards Pierrepont in his place. Grant suggested other reforms as well, including a proposal that states should offer free public schooling to all children; he also endorsed the Blaine Amendment, which would have forbidden government aid to schools with religious affiliations.|$|E

5|$|A 2009 study {{conducted}} by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration found that crashes involving pedestrians and bicyclists have higher incidence rates for hybrid electric vehicles than internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles in low-speed vehicle maneuvers such as reversing or leaving a parking zone. These accidents commonly occurred in zones with low speed limits, during daytime and in clear weather. The study found that a HEV was two times more likely to <b>be</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> pedestrian crash than was a conventional ICE vehicle when a vehicle is slowing or stopping, backing up, or entering or leaving a parking space. Vehicle maneuvers were grouped in one category considering those maneuvers that might have occurred at very low speeds where the difference between the sound levels produced by the hybrid versus ICE vehicle is the greatest. Also the study found that the incidence rate of pedestrian crashes in scenarios when vehicles make a turn was significantly higher for HEVs when compared to ICE vehicles. Similarly, The NHTSA study also concluded that the incidence rate of bicyclist crashes involving HEVs for the same kind of maneuvers was significantly higher when compared to conventional vehicles.|$|E

30|$|The {{coefficient}} estimate {{associated with}} the dummy variable of whether <b>a</b> respondent <b>is</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> accident as a driver, however, implies that those that <b>are</b> (<b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> accident as drivers) show a tendency towards the safer option in rural roads. This is the opposite effect from the variable of whether <b>a</b> respondent <b>is</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> injury accident as a driver for the urban case, and {{can be interpreted as}} being due to the perception of higher speeds in rural roads.|$|R

(In 1865 the Outlying Districts Police Act also came into force, enabling more land to be forfeited when chiefs failed to surrender fugitives).|$|E

25|$|The {{delivery}} of new texts has radically changed along with technological influence. Composition now {{consists of the}} anticipation of future remediation. Writers think about the type of audience a text will be written for, and anticipate how that text might be reformed in the future. Jim Ridolfo coined the term rhetorical velocity to explain a conscious concern for the distance, speed, time, and travel it will take for a third party to rewrite an original composition. The use of recomposition allows for an audience to <b>be</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> public conversation, adding their own intentionality to the original product. This new method of editing and remediation is attributed {{to the evolution of}} digital text and publication, giving technology an important role in writing and composition.|$|E

25|$|According to a study, {{girls who}} {{participate}} in girls-only activities are {{far less likely to}} experience a teenage pregnancy and less likely to be sexually active in general. Participating in competitive sports has also shown to have an effect for girls. A study published in 1999 found that female adolescents who participated in sports were less likely than their non-athletic peers to engage in sexual activity and/or report a pregnancy. Males interested in arts are also less likely to <b>be</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> pregnancy situation. It is unclear whether these correlations are causal or the reflection of the underlying bias of the considered population.
