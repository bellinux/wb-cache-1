40|$|ABSTRACT Uncultured and {{therefore}} uncharacterized Bacteroidetes lineages are ubiquitous in many natural ecosystems which specialize in lignocellulose degradation. However, their metabolic contribution remains mysterious, as well-studied cultured Bacteroidetes {{have been shown}} to degrade only soluble polysaccharides within the human distal gut and herbivore rumen. We have interrogated a reconstructed genome from an uncultured Bacteroidetes phylotype that dominates a switchgrass-associated community within the cow rumen. Importantly, this characterization effort has revealed the first preliminary evidence for poly-saccharide utilization locus (PUL) -catalyzed conversion of cellulose. Based on these findings, we propose a further expansion of the PUL paradigm and the saccharolytic capacity of rumen Bacteroidetes species to include cellulose, the most abundant terres-trial polysaccharide on Earth. Moreover, the perspective of a cellulolytic PUL lays the foundation for PULs to be considered an alternative mechanism for cellulose degradation, next to cellulosomes and free-enzyme systems. Uncultured Bacteroidetes lineages dominate manylignocellulose-degrading communities.

40|$|Carbon (C) is {{a central}} element in organic {{compounds}} and is an indispensable resource for life. It is also an essential production factor in <b>bio-based</b> <b>economies,</b> where biomass serves many purposes, including energy generation and material production. Biomass conversion is a common case of transformation between different carbon-containing compounds. At each transformation step, C might be lost. To optimize the C use, the C flows from raw materials to end products must be understood. The estimation of {{how much of the}} initial C in the feedstock remains in consumable products and delivers services provides an indication of the C use efficiency. We define this concept as Carbon Utilization Degree (CUDe) and apply it to two biomass uses: biogas production and hemp insulation. CUDe increases when conversion processes are optimized, i. e., residues are harnessed and/or losses are minimized. We propose CUDe as a complementary approach for policy design to assess C as an asset for bio-based production. This may lead to a paradigm shift to see C as a resource that requires sustainable exploitation. It could complement the existing methods that focus solely on the climate impact of carbon. bio-economy; bioenergy; biogas; biomass; carbon efficiency; climate change; natural fibers; policy decision support; productivity; transformatio...|$|R

The slogan [...] "sustainable:innovative" [...] guided Brazilian and German universities, research institutions, scientists and students as they came together to exchange information {{on a wide variety of}} issues related to sustainability and innovation and to launch new bilateral projects. The aim of these activities was to raise awareness of the diversity and excellence of German-Brazilian bilateral science cooperation and to give fresh impetus to scientific and technological cooperation. More than 100 events took place, including 60 'best practice' projects which received more than 1 million euros in funding from the BMBF. Highlights of the Science Year included the Brazil Week at Münster University, a road show in Brazil which showcased Germany as a location for research, the [...] "Eye of the Sky" [...] touring exhibition of the German Aerospace Center (DLR) and a promotional tour through Brazil to attract students to come to study in Germany. The German-Brazilian Year launched the foundation of an agricultural research laboratory at the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation (EMBRAPA) under the umbrella of the Helmholtz Research Centre Jülich. Since 2012 the two institutions have been working in close cooperation in the field of plant breeding. A workshop on the topic [...] "Creating Value from Bio-Resources", also held during the Science Year, marked the start of greater cooperation in this field of research.

In dit proefschrift worden katalytische routes beschreven voor platformchemicaliën uit de suikerfractie van lignocellulosische biomassa en isolatiemethoden om platformmoleculen uit waterige pyrolyse-oliestromen te isoleren. We hebben gevonden dat metaalzouten unieke katalysatoren zijn voor de omzetting van suikers in interessante platformchemicaliën. Voorbeelden zijn de omzetting van trioses als glyceraldehyde naar melkzuur, een startmateriaal voor de productie van polymelkzuur, en de omzetting van glucose naar 5 -hydroxymethylfurfural. Daarnaast is de omzetting van laagwaardige bijproducten van suikerconversies (humines) naar interessante hoogwaardigere producten bestudeerd.

We found that metal salts are unique catalysts to obtain promising platform chemicals from the sugar fraction of biomass. Lactic acid, a precursor for bioplastics, was obtained in high yields in water when aluminum salts were used as the catalysts. High yields up to 90 mol% are possible when triose sugars are used as starting materials. 5 -Hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), a versatile biobased building block, was obtained in unprecedentedly high yields (60 mol%) when reacting D-glucose in DMSO with metal salts as the catalysts. ...|$|R

40|$|The <b>bio-based</b> <b>economy</b> can {{and should}} be to the 21 st century what the fossil-based economy was to the 20 th century. Agriculture will be core to the <b>bio-based</b> <b>economy,</b> {{providing}} source materials for commodity items, e. g. liquid fuels and value-added products such as chemicals and materials. For example, a hectare (2. 47 acres) of biomass crop converted to 16, 800 L (4, 450 gallons) of ethanol at a cost of $ 0. 13 /L ($ 0. 50 / gallon), grown on 20 Mha (50 million acres) of non-prime agricultural land would, along with domestic petro-leum, enable national self-sufficiency in gasoline. At the same time, agriculture will continue to provide food and feed that are even more healthful and safe. The public-good benefits that will accrue from the <b>bio-based</b> <b>economy</b> are compelling (Fig. 1). They include national and homeland security, economic advantages to farmers, industry, rural communities, and society, environmental benefits at the global, regional, and local levels—including sustainability—and other benefits to society in terms of human health and safety.

40|$|The <b>bio-based</b> <b>economy</b> {{relies on}} sustainable, plant-derived {{resources}} for fuels, chemicals, materials, {{food and feed}} {{rather than on the}} evanescent usage of fossil resources. The cornerstone of this economy is the biorefinery, in which renewable resources are intelligently converted to a plethora of products, maximizing the valorization of the feedstocks. Innovation is a prerequisite to move a fossil-based economy toward sustainable alternatives, and the viability of the <b>bio-based</b> <b>economy</b> depends on the integration between plant (green) and industrial (white) biotechnology. Green biotechnology deals with primary production through the improvement of biomass crops, while white biotechnology deals with the conversion of biomass into products and energy. Waste streams are minimized during these processes or partly converted to biogas, which can be used to power the processing pipeline. The sustainability of this economy is guaranteed by a third technology pillar that uses thermochemical conversion to valorize waste streams and fix residual carbon as biochar in the soil, hence creating a carbon-negative cycle.

40|$|The {{expected}} higher {{global demand}} for animal proteins {{and the competition}} for starch and sugars between food, fuel and feed seem to favour herbivores that convert solar energy captured in fibrous plants into animal products. However, the required higher production level of herbivores questions the sustainability of this conversion. An increase in herbivore production {{can be achieved by}} increasing the number of animals associated with the increasing demand of plant biomass or by improving the efficiency with which plant biomass is converted into meat and milk. The potential to increase food production by cattle, the main food-producing herbivore in the temperate zones outside China, was considered in three production systems: grassland-based, mixed rain-fed and mixed irrigated systems. The potential to increase plant biomass production in grassland-based systems seems limited, unless fertiliser is imported in large quantities and crop production is increased, sacrificing valuable, high-quality grasslands, which often conflicts with sustainable production methods. Also, in mixed systems with high inputs of fertiliser or water, improvements in plant biomass production seem marginal and the main challenges for these systems are in breeding high-quality plant biomass at lower levels of fertiliser and the use of new co-products from food processing and <b>bio-based</b> <b>economies.</b> Consequently, the main challenge in herbivore nutrition management is to improve the efficiency of plant biomass utilisation. Stocking rate management along with seasonal variation in the grazing capacity of grasslands and moderate use of fertiliser may increase meat production in grassland-based systems by 400 %. Improving plant biomass utilisation in the more industrialised mixed rain-fed systems seems possible by better feed storage technologies and for dairy cattle by improving animal health and lifetime production level. Managing the transition period seems crucial to achieve more sustainable mixed rain-fed and mixed irrigated dairy production systems. Whether sustainable production methods will be implemented also depends on macro-economic conditions and awareness of regional and global environmental concerns...|$|R

This paper illustrates {{an alternative to the}} traditional supply chain of bread based on the principles of a circular economy. Methods: Six circular interactions among seven actors (grain farmers, bread producers, retailers, compostable packaging manufacturers, insect breeders, livestock farmers, consumers) of the circular filière are created in order to achieve the goal of "zero waste". In the model, two radical technological innovations are considered: insects used as animal feed and polylactic acid compostable packaging. Results: The main challenges for the implementation of the new supply chain are identified. Finally, some recent patents related to bread sustainable production, investigated in the current paper, are considered.

40|$|A need {{to reduce}} {{anthropogenic}} carbon emissions has prompted a trend for industry to switch from fossil to biorenewable feedstock, but it remains unclear if this is always a ‘low carbon’ decision. The concept that biomaterials can have lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions than petrochemicals has been grasped enthusiastically, however one aspect in particular has been somewhat overlooked when considering life time emissions; their disposal. Low carbon waste management {{is not a new}} concept, but its application to waste streams with high bio content is not well understood. This thesis employs mixed methods to investigate the impact of end of life scenarios on the GHG emissions associated with biorenewable materials. A hybrid life cycle assessment (LCA) of a biomaterial and petrochemical product shows that end of life scenarios have a bigger impact on overall GHG emissions for waste biomaterials than those based on petrochemicals and shows that biomaterials can be lower carbon if disposal is taken into account. In order to understand how such benefits from biomaterials can be realised, fourteen interviews with biomaterial industry stakeholders were then conducted and provided insights from which policy options to promote low carbon disposal are developed. A focus group with nine experts considered these options and made recommendations to raise the profile of disposal via encouraging product purity, stimulating demand and updating collection infrastructure. One other recommendation was to provide more transparency regarding the benefits of particular disposal options on specific biomaterials and in order to help with this the final part of this thesis is devoted {{to the development of a}} low carbon decision support tool for biomaterial disposal options based on LCA and tested on two hemp biorefineries. This tool was used to rank all the disposal options according to GHG emissions as well as cost effectiveness, particularly useful in locations where preferred strategies may not be available for example where there is no district heating infrastructure to support Combined Heat and Power (CHP). Its results confirm the waste hierarchy but also shows novel technologies such as ‘ethanol from waste’ are can be both low carbon and economically competitive. This tool can both help biorefinery operators to design low carbon disposal options into their products, as well as help guide waste and biomaterial policy decisions. The tool suggests that existing UK disposal infrastructure for municipal solid waste streams is not designed with biomaterial waste in mind, and that a rethink in waste disposal and its funding may be required to ensure future <b>bio-based</b> <b>economies</b> achieve better reductions in carbon emissions. ...|$|R

40|$|The carbon {{footprint}} (CF) of biofuels and biomaterials is {{a barrier to}} their acceptance, yet the greenhouse gas emissions associated with disposing of biomaterials are frequently omitted from analyses. This article investigates whether harmonization is appropriate for calculating the importance of biomaterials’ disposal. This research shows that disposal stages could double a biomaterial's CF, or reduce it {{to the point that}} it could claim to be zero carbon. Incineration with combined heat and power coupled with on-site energy production in the biorefinery are identified as prerequisites to being zero carbon. The article assesses the current UK waste infrastructure's ability to support a low-carbon <b>bio-based</b> future <b>economy,</b> and finds that presently it only achieves marginal net reductions when compared to landfill and so cannot be said to support low-carbon biomaterials, though the article challenges the polluter pays principle where low-carbon disposal infrastructure are not available. Reuse and recycling are shown to have the potential to offset all the emissions caused by landfill of biomaterials. However, the savings are not so great as to offset the biomaterial's upstream emissions. The study explores the ability to overcome the barriers to incorporating disposal into life cycle assessment while identifying limitations of using harmonization as an assessment method. Specifically, data availability and industry consensus are flagged as major barriers. The study also uses sensitivity analysis to investigate the influence of methodological choices, such as allowing additional reuse and recycling stages, classifying biomaterials into different types, and choosing between opposing allocation methods...|$|R

Being confronted with limited and successively depleted reserves of fossils, it is high time to reorient research from petro-chemical conversion processes to bio-chemical ones. Many processes of converting biomass to energy and bioproducts were developed but during the industrial era, due to the enormous pressure on fossil conversion, they have not been implemented. Implementation of the concept of a biochemical refinery (or a biorefinery) as an analogue to a petrochemical refinery is a challenge for the present time. The philosophy of a biorefinery is quite simple. It is a facility which produces a spectrum of bioproducts, including intermediates, bioenergy and biofuels, and all the biorefinery products contribute significantly to the global economy. As a result, a new market of bioproducts appears, which will require a special economic approach that will consider all and any elements of sustainable development, including environmental and social aspects. In other words, it will need a <b>bio-based</b> sustainable <b>economy</b> or simply bio-economy. Two hypotheses related to development of the biorefinery concept have been stated in this paper: 1) sustainable development needs sustainable energy, and 2) sustainable energy needs sustainable agriculture.

In the conclusions it was stated that (i) biomass has a chance to be the main source of energy in the 21 st century but it needs some changes in agriculture (ii) biogas plant is an environmental necessity and (iii) biorefinery — biofuels today, but the goal is to maximize the value of biomass...|$|R

Nonetheless, current methodological guidelines for assessing the GHG savings from the use of biofuels do not fully account for benefits from by-products and other utilities (e. g. waste heat and electricity) from biofuel production. This study therefore reviews the aggregated environmental performance of these multi-functional biofuel systems by assessing impacts and benefits from relevant production processes in Sweden in order to improve the decision base for biofuel producers and policymakers in the transition to a <b>bio-based</b> and circular <b>economy.</b> This was done by (1) conducting a mapping of the Swedish biofuel production portfolio, (2) developing future production scenarios, and (3) application of life cycle assessment methodology to assess the environmental performance of the production processes.

40|$|Processing {{of organic}} waste can improve its {{nutrient}} availability and content, and thereby increases the agricultural {{value of the}} waste when used as fertilisers, while contributing to a more <b>bio-based,</b> ‘circular’ <b>economy.</b> It is therefore important to guide future policies on waste management and {{on the development of}} industries related to processing of organic wastes from agriculture, industry and households. However, {{there is a lack of}} understanding of the decision-making processes underlying the use of processed and unprocessed organic waste-based fertilisers by farmers. We conducted a survey asking farmers in Denmark about their current use of organic fertiliser, their interest in using alternative types in the future, and their perception of most important barriers or advantages to using organic fertilisers. A representative sample of farmers with > 10 ha of land were sent a questionnaire; in total 452 responses (28 % response rate) were received. Almost three quarters of respondents (72 %) used organic fertiliser, and half of the arable/horticultural farms (without livestock) used unprocessed manures, suggesting significant manure exchange from animal production farms to arable farms in Denmark. Looking forward three years from the time of the survey, respondents did not expect to increase the amount of organic fertiliser they used. However, future interest in using processed manures (PRO) and urban waste-derived fertiliser (URB) was greater than their use at the time of the survey (66 % interest vs 19 % current use of PRO and 32 % vs 9 % current use of URB). Anaerobically-digested slurry, acidified slurry, and composted/thermally-dried manure or slurry were products of particular interest. A large percentage (40 %) of farmers did not have access to processed forms of organic fertiliser, particularly PRO (35 % of respondents). Farm and farmer characteristics such as farming activity, farmer age, farm size, and conventional/organic farming influenced the likelihood of future interest in alternative organic fertilisers. The most important barriers to the use of organic fertiliser identified among respondents were: unpleasant odour for neighbours, uncertainty in nutrient content, and difficulty in planning and use. Improved soil structure was clearly chosen as the most important advantage or reason to use organic fertiliser, followed by low cost to buy or produce, and ease of availability. Danish government policies aim to increase in manure processing (e. g. increasing anaerobic digestion for bioenergy recovery). A mix of industry and government-led measures could potentially increase availability and farmer-use to meet these targets. </p...|$|R

In the Port of Rotterdam there is a clear short-term (0 - 10 year) substitution potential of 10 - 15 % of fossil oil-based bulk chemicals by bio-based bulk chemicals, especially for oxygenated bulk chemicals, such as ethylene glycol and propylene glycol, iso-propanol and acetone, butylene and methylethylketone and for the replacement of methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) by ethyl tertiary butyl ether (ETBE). Glycerin, as a byproduct of biodiesel production, is a very favorable short-term option for the production of ethylene and propy-lene glycols in the Port of Rotterdam. In the mid-term (10 - 20 years) there is clear potential for a bio-based production of ethylene, acrylic acid and N-containing bulk chemicals such as acrylonitrile, acrylamide and -caprolactam.

This paper will make use of Geels’s Multi Level Perspective theory along with Roger’s adoption theory to enlighten the key factors for adoption of bio-based packaging. Geels’s theory will introduce the concepts of evolution of a niche level product into a main stream market product. The evolution does not only depend upon the attributes of the product, it depends on many macro elements like landscape pressure or sudden change in the outside environment. Different hypothesis or proposals are presented in this paper on the basis of Geels’s Multilevel Perspective (MLP) theory to demonstrate the possible situation for bio-based packaging product to be either accepted or rejected by the key players in the current regime. The most influential factors discovered during the research process are price, supplier strength and technological feasibility of bio-based packaging with the status quo. The dilemma for the key players in this economically unstable situation is investment associated with the new packaging schemes and the incentives or business logic in bio-based packaging materials. Currently, the concentration of key players in this business arena is more on cost saving by making the process more efficient and product differentiation which somehow makes the road to success for bio-based packaging much narrower. Nevertheless, bio-based packaging has shown great potential in terms of technological feasibility and improvement in price. If <b>bio-based</b> packaging opt <b>economies</b> of scale, price can effectively improve and make bio-based packaging competent. Bio-based packaging seems the legitimate solution for the thousands of tons of plastic waste accumulating in the seas of the world which is already having severe effects on sea life which will indirectly affect human health...|$|R
40|$|Establishment of a <b>bio-based</b> <b>economy</b> {{has been}} {{recognised}} {{as one of}} the key issues for sustainable development For future developments renewable resources will play a key role as CO 2 neutral raw material for sustainable industrial production to curb depletion of fossil resources. Options to fully exploit the potential of renewable resources as industrial chemical feedstock imply different interdependent routes. In this paper, the various scenarios how to achieve a <b>bio-based</b> <b>economy</b> are discussed. ranging, from the traditional 'complex route' via chemical conversion, to shifting to a glucose-based economy (C 6) or transformation of biomass into C 1 or C 2 chemical building blocks, following the approach of the petrochemical industries. For each scenario, an integrated chain approach is essential. All aspects need to be addressed from food security. food safety, 'green' energy production and development of sustainable non-food products for industry, to waste management, recycling and disposal. The emerging, strategies require combined efforts from both science and commercial enterprise, facilitated by governmental legislation and should be based upon a broad public support.
