The liquid crystallization mechanism permits us to homologize {{the elements of the}} cuttlebone with those of other coleoids and with the nacreous septa and the shells of nautiloids.

40|$|In {{common with}} many {{cephalopod}} mollusks, cuttlefish produce an internal biomineral <b>buoyancy</b> <b>device.</b> This cuttlebone {{is analogous to}} a surf board in shape and structure, providing rigidity and a means of controlling buoyancy. The cuttlebone is composed of calcium carbonate {{in the form of}} aragonite and comprises an upper dorsal shield and a lower lamellar matrix. The lamellar matrix comprises layers of chambers with highly corrugated walls. The dorsal shield comprises bundles of aragonite needles stacked on top of each other. Electron backscatter diffraction analyses of the dorsal shield reveal that the c-axis of aragonite is parallel with the long axis of the needles in the bundles such that any spread in crystallographic orientation is consistent with the spread in orientation of the fibers as they radiate to form the overall structure of the dorsal shield. This arrangement of c-axis coincident with the long axis of the biomineral structure is similar to the arrangement in corals and in contrast to the situation in the molluskan aragonite nacre of brachiopod calcite where the c-axis is perpendicular to the aragonite tablet or calcite fiber, respectively. © 2013 The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society...|$|E

40|$|Cuttlebone,” the internalized shell {{found in}} {{all members of the}} {{cephalopod}} family Sepiidae, is a sophisticated <b>buoyancy</b> <b>device</b> combining high porosity with considerable strength. Using a complementary suite of characterization tools, we identified significant structural, chemical, and mechanical variations across the different structural units of the cuttlebone: the dorsal shield consists of two stiff and hard layers with prismatic mineral organization which encapsulate a more ductile and compliant layer with a lamellar structure, enriched with organic matter. A similar organization is found in the chambers, which are separated by septa, and supported by meandering plates (“pillars”). Like the dorsal shield, septa contain two layers with lamellar and prismatic organization, respectively, which differ significantly in their mechanical properties: layers with prismatic organization are a factor of three stiffer and up to a factor of ten harder than those with lamellar organization. The combination of stiff and hard, and compliant and ductile components may serve {{to reduce the risk of}} catastrophic failure, and reflect the role of organic matter for the growth process of the cuttlebone. Mechanically “weaker” units may function as sacrificial structures, ensuring a stepwise failure of the individual chambers in cases of overloading, allowing the animals to retain near-neutral buoyancy even with partially damaged cuttlebones. Our findings have implications for our understanding of the structure-property-function relationship of cuttlebone, and may help to identify novel bioinspired design strategies for light-weight yet high-strength foams...|$|E

40|$|Internal moulds of the {{relatively}} small − to moderate−size shells of Early Devonian ectocochleate cephalopods (typically < 150 mm diameter) occasionally display traces of repaired shell damage. Presumably, these animals with their highly specialized <b>buoyancy</b> <b>device,</b> the phragmocone, lived in the water column. It is uncertain {{as to how the}} shells of these ani− mals were damaged; one likely cause would be predatory attacks but the identity of the perpetrator remains uncertain. So far, no remains of arthropods capable of breaking or cutting shells have been found in the fossiliferous outcrops of this age in the Anti−Atlas (Morocco). The only macrovertebrate remains of this age are of acanthodian and placoderm fish which probably lived a more or less benthonic life style. Additionally, a fish attack on these cephalopods would probably have destroyed most of the thin−shelled conch and killed the animal. Most of the repaired shell breaks are triangular in shape which is characteristic for cephalopod bite marks. Additionally, the paired arrangement of the fractures in over 70 bactritoids supports the hypothesis that it was a cephalopod attacking another cephalopod. It cannot be excluded with cer− tainty that occasional vertebrate attacks left traces on their shells. Fossil evidence indicates that the development of tightly coiled conchs was a rapid evolutionary event in the Ammonoidea in the Early Devonian; however, the evolution of coil− ing is probably not directly related to predation pressures because the ratio of injured to healthy specimens is roughly the same in Zlíchovian bactritoids with orthoconic and ammonoids with coiled shells...|$|E

In the process of voyage at a constant depth, the real time speed, pitch angle and depth error were detected to evaluate the residual buoyancy indirectly, and then the real time buoyancy control was executed by pumping the water into or out of the tanks.

ADCPs mounted on steel <b>buoyancy</b> <b>devices</b> and deployed on seven moorings on the East Greenland outer shelf and upper slope from 2007 to 2008 suffered from severe magnetic deviations of > 90 ^∘ rendering the ADCP data useless without a compass correction.

On each of the moorings, velocity measurements from a different instrument which was assumed not to be affected by magnetic deviation are overlapping in space and time with the compromised ones. A method is described to determine the magnetic compass deviation from the compromised and uncompromised velocity measurements and the compromised compass headings. The method depends on the assumption that at least one instrument per mooring is not compromised. With this method, the magnetic deviation as well as the originally compromised velocity records can be corrected.
