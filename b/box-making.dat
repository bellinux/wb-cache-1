6000|$|This <b>box-making</b> {{went on for}} two whole days. As each of {{them was}} filled and pegged down, the gold within being packed in sawdust {{to keep it from}} rattling, Alan amused himself in adding an address with a feather brush and a supply of red paint such as the Asiki priests used to {{decorate}} their bodies. At first he was puzzled to know what address to put, but finally decided upon the following: ...|$|E

50|$|In 1859, {{when the}} town's {{population}} was 4,009, industries included nine sawmills, two gristmills, one tannery, one carding machine, one pottery maker, eight brickyards, thirteen shipbuilders, five pail factories, two edge tool factories, one carriage manufacturer and eight <b>box-making</b> establishments.|$|E
50|$|Champagnole’s {{economic}} activity is principally industrial. The town {{is surrounded by}} blocks of forest so the exploitation of the timber and of its derivatives supplies the raw materials for furniture factories, including bathroom furniture. There is also a craft trade in <b>box-making,</b> wooden utensils and toys.|$|E
50|$|Just {{past the}} fork to Solitude Lane, about 400 ft {{north of the}} {{intersection}} with Snowden Avenue and Westerly Road, are {{the first set of}} buildings. Between the street and the tracks is a gable-roofed one-story brick storage building with segmental-arched windows. East of the street is a group of small buildings that constituted the factory in its earliest days—Brandreth's office (now demolished), a mixing and packing building, a <b>box-making</b> building and the storage facility that is the oldest building of the group.|$|E
50|$|Walter {{was born}} to Hermann, an {{immigrant}} from Mecklenburg, and Paula (Wagner) Paepcke, the daughter of German immigrants, in Chicago, Illinois. Hermann owned a lumber mill and <b>box-making</b> company, and young Paepcke {{grew up in an}} upper-middle class home. He was a 1913 graduate of the Latin School of Chicago. He then began working for his father, and eventually took over the company, the Chicago Mill & Lumber, Co. After his father's death in 1922, Paepcke began producing cardboard containers and paper.|$|E
50|$|The {{house was}} built {{sometime}} between about 1885 and 1895, {{and is one of}} a few virtually unchanged Queen Anne/Stick style Victorians in the city. It was built for Walter S. Barnes, who worked in the <b>box-making</b> business in Boston. It was home for many years to the family of Robert Luce (1862-1945), a prominent local politician. Luce, a Republican, served many years in the United States Congress representing Somerville, and served a single term (1912-13) as Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts.|$|E
5000|$|In 1854, at age 33, Vuitton married 17-year-old Clemence-Emilie Parriaux. Soon {{after the}} marriage, he left Marechal's shop, {{and opened his}} own <b>box-making</b> and packing {{workshop}} in Paris. Outside the shop a sign hung reading [...] "Securely packs the most fragile objects. Specializing in packing fashions." [...] Four years later in 1858, Vuitton introduced his revolutionary stackable rectangular shaped trunks to a market that only had rounded tops. This demand spurred his expansion into a larger workshop outside of Paris.|$|E
50|$|While {{there was}} {{widespread}} poverty in Paris, {{the city was}} also being transformed by the Industrial revolution. Vuitton was taken on as an apprentice in the workshop of a successful box-maker and packer named Monsieur Marechal. In 19th-century Europe, <b>box-making</b> and packing was a highly respectable and urbane craft. A box-maker and packer custom-made all boxes to fit the goods they stored and personally loaded and unloaded the boxes. It took Vuitton {{only a few years}} to stake out a reputation amongst Paris's fashionable class as one of the city's premier practitioners of his new craft.|$|E
50|$|The Long Day: The Story of a New York Working Girl, As Told by Herself is a {{book about}} the life of a working-class girl. She was {{formerly}} a teacher in a small town, but is now alone in New York City, living day to day on a few dollars. She lives from boarding house to boarding house, experiencing harsh rules, starvation, and the death of a friend. Furthermore, she works {{in a number of different}} positions, including <b>box-making,</b> flower/feather making, sewing, and finally, a shaker. Throughout this time, she learns what it is like to live on a few dollars a week, working twelve-hour shifts with horrible conditions and few breaks. Ultimately, she is able to earn a respectable living as a typewriter.|$|E
5000|$|The first 9 acre of {{the farm}} were {{purchased}} in 1790 by William Dyer, who had married in that year, {{and the house was}} probably built soon afterward. According to a survey done by the town, this house {{is believed to be the}} oldest in western Cape Elizabeth. By 1850 the farm had grown to its present size, about 50 acre. Dyer's children sold the property in 1864, and it was acquired by Edwin Hutchinson in 1864. It was occupied by his descendants until the 1990s, and it was by them that the <b>box-making</b> operation was established in the early 20th century. [...] After standing vacant for several years, the property was rehabilitated, and is now protected by a preservation easement. It is currently used as a Christmas tree farm.|$|E
5000|$|A Middle Iroquian {{settlement}} {{existed on}} the west bank of a tributary of the Little Rouge Creek in the fourteenth century in the area which is today called Box Grove. In 1815, William Beebe was the first European settler in this area; Sparta or Sparty-Wharf (later Box Grove) was registered as a hamlet in 1850. The name suggests that at an early date there was boat traffic on the Rouge River. The hamlet changed to its present name during Canada's Confederation in 1867 when it was granted a post office. The origin of the name is unclear; it {{may be due to the}} activity at the <b>box-making</b> woodworking factory, a reference to the many boxwood trees around the hamlet, or linked to the hamlet of Box Grove in West Sussex, England. In 1867 the hamlet had [...] "a Church, a schoolhouse, two taverns, woolen mill, sawmill, a store, a blacksmith and two axe-makers shops capable of supplying the whole country with axes and augurs on short notice." ...|$|E
50|$|Work on the $260 {{million project}} is {{scheduled}} to begin in March, and will take 16 months. The 360,000-ton capacity plant will be built on a 50-acre site adjacent to Pratt’s <b>box-making</b> plant in Valparaiso, Indiana, the world’s largest. The new mill is expected to propel Pratt’s USA sales to $2 billion.This follows other mills Pratt built in the USA, most notably in New York City. That facility represents the largest manufacturing investment in the city since World War 2. And it is the only paper mill ever built in New York. New York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg designated September 17, 2013, as “Pratt Industries Day” in the Big Apple, in tribute to the company’s commitment to recycling and the environment. In a video posted on YouTube, entitled “NYC Mayor Salutes Pratt Industries,” Bloomberg cited a proclamation honoring Pratt’s mill for having recycled 5 million tons of discarded paper since start-up in 1997.|$|E
5000|$|Appointed the Conservation Officer and Chief of the Conservation Division at the Library of Congress in 1971, Waters began a {{long career}} aiding the United States' largest library in its {{conservation}} efforts and has been dubbed the [...] "father of American Library Conservation".7 Within {{a few years of}} his placement, Waters had developed new conservation programs including the point system, [...] "whereby the Library's custodial divisions were assigned a budget of treatment hours in a given year, which were reasonably committed through ongoing liaison with senior conservators on his staff2", and the popular [...] "phased preservation" [...] technique. Hailed as the most effective and non-invasive treatment of large collections of deteriorating materials, phased preservation [...] "emphasizes actions that have the greatest impact on the preservation of collections as a whole, rather than concentrating on treating individual items and includes surveys to establish priorities, disaster planning, environmental controls, and holdings maintenance."6 Waters is also credited with inspiring his son Michael Waters and daughter-in-law Carmen Waters to develop computerised <b>box-making</b> machinery and software to produce archival custom boxes. http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=6245004.PN.&OS=PN/6245004&RS=PN/6245004 Peter and Sheila Waters' other sons are Chris Waters, owner of Multimedia solutions, Maryland: and Julian Waters, who was also protégé of the type designer Hermann Zapf.2 ...|$|E
5000|$|Local {{industry}} included hosiery {{from the}} eighteenth to the nineteenth century, {{leading to a}} rise in population to around 600 by 1800. By 1845 there were 300 people employed as framework knitters in the village. A decline in the industry {{in the middle of}} the nineteenth century saw a fall in the village's population, although hosiery manufacture continued in the village until the mid-twentieth century. Boot and shoe manufacture became a more important part of the village's work between 1860 and 1900, and the first employer in Leicestershire described as a [...] "boot and shoe manufacturer" [...] appeared in Anstey in 1863. The village's population rose to over 2,500 by 1900, with a corresponding rise in house-building. Anstey became an independent parish in 1866, having previously been a chapelry of Thurcaston. A number of related industries developed in the village, including tanning and <b>box-making,</b> the latter still present in the village. One of the largest companies in the village was the Anstey Wallpaper Company, which occupied a site east of Cropston Road now filled with houses and the new Co-op store. Nearly all the local factories have now either been demolished or converted into flats. By 1971, the population of the village had risen to almost 6,000. The village is still the home of Ulverscroft Large Print Books Ltd., known for their large-print editions of popular books, published since 1964.|$|E
50|$|Pratt joined McKinsey & Co, a {{management}} consulting firm, in 1982 before joining Visy as joint General Manager of its board. In 1988, he became Deputy Chairman of Visy Industries. Three years later, {{he moved to}} the United States to lead the company's expansion there. Over the next 15 years, Pratt Industries grew 15-fold in sales and earnings, through greenfield initiatives and the acquisition of several corrugated manufacturing companies that now form the heart of Pratt Industries. Company revenues grew from 100 million in 1991; and by 2016 revenue was 3 billion. During that time, Pratt Industries grew from the 46th largest corrugated box producer in the U.S. to the 5th largest. It is the only major paper container board company that is 100 percent recycled. In 2013, then-New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg presented Pratt with a proclamation declaring September 17, 2013, Pratt Industries Day. In 2016, Pratt was awarded the RISI North American Packaging CEO of the Year Award. That same year, Pratt opened a 100% recycled paper mill near Chicago, adding about 1 billion to his wealth. It was officially opened by then-Governor Mike Pence. In March, 2017, Pratt opened his 68th factory, a <b>box-making</b> plant, with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker in Beloit. On May 4th, 2017, Pratt pledged in the presence of President Donald Trump to invest $2 billion to create 5,000 high-paying manufacturing jobs over 10 years mainly in the Midwest.|$|E
5000|$|GROVE FAMILYThe Grove Family {{offers a}} rich {{contribution}} to Beaver Bank history. Originally from England, the siblings moved to Nova Scotia {{after living in}} Philadelphia for several years. The four Grove sisters quickly established a reputation in Halifax due to their prestigious finishing school in the Downtown area. They were described once as, [...] "Those four English sisters whose ability and character influenced for good so large a number of young ladies of that generation."Woodlands, the Grove residence, was built in Beaver Bank in 1847. The two Grove brothers lived on the property, profiting from saw-milling, brick-making, farming and <b>box-making.</b> In 1880 their sisters returned, and established the Grove School for Young Ladies in its place, which ran until destroyed by fire in 1943.One {{or all of the}} Grove sisters is/are the writer(s) of what is thought to be the first piece of children's literature written in Nova Scotia, possibly even Canada, titled Little Grace or Scenes in Nova Scotia. The original book still remains with the Grove family to this day.. The sisters also are the main influence behind the construction of the first Anglican Church in Beaver Bank, in 1886: The Church of the Good Shepard. The Original church was sold in 1998 to a private buyer and removed from its foundation and its proper standing place. Today is it located in the township of Chester and used for private purposes. Frances Shunamon (McCarron, née Grove) donated the land in her newly developed [...] "Shunamon Subdivision" [...] to house the newer and current Church of the Good Shepard, which still stand today.|$|E
