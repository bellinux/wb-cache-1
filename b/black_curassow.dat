60|$|There are strange birds, too. One, {{whom you}} may see in the Zoological Gardens, like a plover with a {{straight}} beak and bittern's plumage, from 'The Main,' whose business is to walk about the table at meals uttering sad metallic noises and catching flies. His name is Sun-bird, {93a} 'Sun-fowlo' of the Surinam Negroes, according to dear old Stedman, 'because, when it extends its wings, which it often does, there appears on the interior part of each wing a most beautiful representation of the sun. This bird,' he continues very truly, 'might be styled the perpetual motion, its body making a continual movement, and its tail keeping time like the pendulum of a clock.' {93b} A game-bird, olive, with a bare red throat, also from The Main, called a Chacaracha, {93c} who is impudently brave, and considers the house his own; and a great <b>black</b> <b>Curassow,</b> {93d} also from The Main, who patronises the turkeys and guinea-fowl; stalks in dignity before them; {{and when they do}} not obey, enforces his authority by pecking them to death. There is thus plenty of amusement here, and instruction too, for those to whom the ways of dumb animals during life are more interesting than their stuffed skins after death.|$|E
6000|$|As {{the young}} {{of almost all}} gallinaceous birds, even of the <b>black</b> <b>curassow</b> and black grouse, whilst covered with down, are {{longitudinally}} striped on the back,--of which character, when adult, neither sex retains a trace,--it {{might have been expected}} that the chickens of all our domestic fowls would have been similarly striped. (7/39. My information, which is very far from perfect, on chickens in the down, is derived chiefly from Mr. Dixon's 'Ornamental and Domestic Poultry.' Mr. B.P. Brent has also communicated to me many facts by letter, as has Mr. Tegetmeier. I will in each case mark my authority by the name within brackets. For the chickens of white Silk fowls see Tegetmeier 'Poultry Book' 1866 page 221.) This could, however, hardly have been expected, when the adult plumage in both sexes has undergone so great a change as to be wholly white or black. In white fowls of various breeds the chickens are uniformly yellowish white, passing in the black- boned Silk fowl into bright canary-yellow. This is also generally the case with the chickens of white Cochins, but I hear from Mr. Zurhost that they are sometimes of a buff or oak colour, and that all those of this latter colour, which were watched, turned out males. The chickens of buff Cochins are of a golden-yellow, easily distinguishable from the paler tint of the white Cochins, and are often longitudinally streaked with dark shades: the chickens of silver-cinnamon Cochins are almost always of a buff colour. The chickens of the white Game and white Dorking breeds, when held in particular lights, sometimes exhibit (on the authority of Mr. Brent) faint traces of longitudinal stripes. Fowls which are entirely black, namely, Spanish, black Game, black Polish, and black Bantams, display a new character, for their chickens have their breasts and throats more or less white, with sometimes a little white elsewhere. Spanish chickens also, occasionally (Brent), have, where the down was white, their first true feathers tipped for a time with white. The primordially striped character is retained by the chickens of most of the Game sub-breeds (Brent, Dixon); by Dorkings; by the partridge and grouse-coloured sub-breeds of Cochins (Brent), but not, as we have seen, by the sub-breeds; by the pheasant-Malay (Dixon), but apparently not (at which I am much surprised) by other Malays. The following breeds and sub-breeds are barely, or not at all, longitudinally striped: viz., gold and silver pencilled Hamburghs, which can hardly be distinguished from each other (Brent) in the down, both having a few dark spots on the head and rump, with occasionally a longitudinal stripe (Dixon) {{on the back of the}} neck. I have seen only one chicken of the silver-spangled Hamburgh, and this was obscurely striped along the back. Gold-spangled Polish chickens (Tegetmeier) are of a warm russet brown; and silver-spangled Polish chickens are grey, sometimes (Dixon) with dashes of ochre on the head, wings, and breast. Cuckoo and blue-dun fowls (Dixon) are grey in the down. The chickens of Sebright Bantams (Dixon) are uniformly dark brown, whilst those of the brown- breasted red Game Bantam are black, with some white on the throat and breast. From these facts we see that young chickens of the different breeds, and even of the same main breed, differ much in their downy plumage; and, although longitudinal stripes characterise the young of all wild gallinaceous birds, they disappear in several domestic breeds. Perhaps it may be accepted as a general rule that the more the adult plumage differs from that of the adult G. bankiva, the more completely the chickens have lost their stripes.] ...|$|E

50|$|This {{species has}} proven to produce fertile hybrids with its closest living relative, the blue-billed curassow, and also with the much more distantly related <b>black</b> <b>curassow.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Although the <b>black</b> <b>curassow</b> {{is fairly}} common, populations have been declining because of habitat loss, {{trapping}} and hunting. These threats {{are likely to}} continue, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature rates the bird's conservation status as [...] "vulnerable".|$|E
50|$|This genus forms {{one of the}} {{two major}} {{lineages}} of curassows. It is distinguishable from its relatives by its obvious sexual dimorphism (only exception being the <b>black</b> <b>curassow),</b> which is by size only in Mitu, and minor or rare in Nothocrax and Pauxi.|$|E
50|$|From captivity, hybrids {{with the}} blue-billed curassow (Crax alberti) are known. That species {{is one of}} the {{northern}} group of Crax. The yellow-knobbed curassows (C. daubentoni) is probably closest to it, but regardless, they are quite distinct from the wattled curassow. But viable (though not dependably fertile) hybrids are suspected to be possible between any two species of Cracidae. The color and shape of the bill ornaments of male Crax hybrids are not easily predicted, but character displacement would demand the eastern (if any) subspecies of the <b>black</b> <b>curassow</b> (C. a. alector) to have a red ornamentation, as no red-ornamented congeners occur in or near its range. The red cere of the western <b>black</b> <b>curassow</b> may well be due to occasional hybrid introgression of C. globulosa alleles, as {{it is unlikely that the}} Solimões is entirely impassable to these birds.|$|E
50|$|The <b>black</b> <b>curassow</b> is {{a largely}} ground-dwelling bird. It {{lives in the}} {{undergrowth}} in lowland forests and plantations and in riverside thickets. It mostly eats fruit, but also consumes buds, shoots, leaves, flowers, fungi and invertebrates. It nests a few meters above the ground in trees, the nest being a platform of sticks. Breeding {{takes place in the}} rainy season in Suriname while in French Guiana, young are reported in March and September.|$|E
50|$|The <b>black</b> <b>curassow</b> {{is a large}} bird {{reaching}} about 900 mm in length. The male has black {{upper parts}} glossed with a purplish sheen and an inconsricuous black crest. The skin {{at the base of}} the grey beak is yellow or orange but there are no knobs and wattles. The underparts are white. The female is similar but the crest is barred with white, and the juvenile is black, barred and mottled with reddish-brown and reddish-buff.|$|E
50|$|The {{red-billed curassow}} {{is a large}} bird {{reaching}} a length of 82 to 92 cm. The male has pure black upper parts with a large black crest, and white underparts. There are bright red wattles and knobs {{at the base of}} the bill. The male can be distinguished from the wattled curassow (Crax globulosa) by being less bluish-black and from the <b>black</b> <b>curassow</b> (Crax alector) by being less purplish-black. The female lacks the wattles and has black upper parts, a black and white barred crest, reddish-brown wings barred and mottled with black, and reddish-brown or ochre underparts.|$|E
50|$|The <b>black</b> <b>curassow</b> (Crax alector), {{also known}} as the smooth-billed curassow and the crested curassow, is a species of bird in the Cracidae family, the chachalacas, guans, and curassows. It is found in humid forests in {{northern}} South America in Colombia, Venezuela, the Guianas and far northern Brazil. Introduced to Bahamas, Cuba, Jamaica, Haiti, Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico and Lesser Antilles. It is the only Crax curassow where the male and female cannot be separated by plumage, as both are essentially black with a white crissum (the area around the cloaca), and have a yellow (eastern part of its range) or orange-red (western part of its range) cere.|$|E
50|$|The park is home a rich {{variety of}} fauna, {{including}} several endangered species. The primate golden-backed uakari (Cacajao melanocephalus) is still {{abundant in the}} area, although its habitat has been reduced elsewhere, as is the Guianan cock-of-the-rock (Rupicola rupicola), a small orange bird that inhabits forested areas. Other species include the bush dog (Speothos venaticus), jaguar (Panthera onca), black hawk-eagle (Spizaetus tyrannus) and ornate hawk-eagle (Spizaetus ornatus), South American tapir (Tapirus terrestris), Titi monkey species, toco toucan (Ramphastos toco), <b>black</b> <b>curassow</b> (Crax alector) and grey-winged trumpeter (Psophia crepitans).The endangered white-bellied spider monkey (Ateles belzebuth) {{is found in the}} park.The park is also home to the Neblina uakari (Cacajao hosomi).|$|E
50|$|Adults {{look very}} much {{like those of the}} red-billed curassow (C. blumenbachii), whose males have only an indistinct maxilla knob. Its females have a blackish cere, rather pale legs and feet, and their wings - {{particularly}} the remiges - usually have distinct chestnut brown marbling. The <b>black</b> <b>curassow</b> subspecies C. alector erythrognatha, found north of the Solimões, has a cere like the wattled curassow female, but its bill is lighter and the crissum is white in both sexes. Young C. globulosa males are easily confused with those of the yellow-knobbed curassows (C. daubentoni), but the latter has a white tail-margin and yellow (not orange) bill wattle. All these similar species are allopatric however, with only C. a. erythrognatha occurring adjacent to the range of C. globulosa.|$|E
50|$|It {{is a large}} {{terrestrial}} <b>black</b> <b>curassow</b> with a small head, large bluish grey casque on forehead, red bill, white-tipped tail feathers, greenish glossed mantle {{and breast}} feathers, and white below. Both sexes are similar. Length in adult birds can vary from 80 to 100 cm. The male, at 3.6 kg (8 lbs), {{is larger than the}} female, at 2.6 kg (5.8 lbs). Among standard measurements, the wing chord is 36.3 to 42.7 cm, the tail is 30.4 to 36.2 cm and the tarsus is 8.9 to 11.2 cm. Some rare rufous morph female has a black barred and reddish brown plumage. For some time, it also contained the horned curassow taxa as subspecies. Nowadays its southern congener is considered a distinct species P. unicornis.|$|E
50|$|The {{horned curassow}} {{is among the}} largest cracid species. It {{measures}} 85 to 95 cm in length. Body mass in large males is up to 3.7 to 3.9 kg and only the great curassow is heavier amongst the cracids, although the <b>black</b> <b>curassow</b> and the closely related helmeted curassow are around the same length. Among standard measurements, the wing chord is 38.1 to 40.2 cm, the tail is 31 to 34.8 cm and the tarsus is 10 to 10.8 cm. It has a distinctive horn or casque on the forehead which projects for over 6 cm. The plumage is generally black, but lacks a blue sheen in primary feathers, and has a white belly, thigh tufts and under-tail coverts. The tail also has white tips.|$|E
5000|$|The {{evolution}} of the 4 southern species was somewhat more complex. In the Messinian, about 6-5.5 mya, the ancestors of the wattled curassow became isolated in the western Amazonas basin. With increasing aridification of southeastern Brazil, the ancestors of the red-billed curassow found refuge in the mountain ranges between the Brazilian Highlands and the Atlantic during the mid-Zanclean, some 4.5-4 mya. The divergence between the bare-faced and <b>black</b> <b>curassow</b> lineages apparently took place around the Uquian - Ensenadan boundary, some 1.5 mya. This which coincides with one or several period(s) of elevated sea levels during which the lower Amazonas basin was a brackish lagoon which offered little curassow habitat. Their present ranges are consequently still separated by the Amazonas river. (Pereira & Baker 2004) ...|$|E

40|$|The <b>Black</b> <b>Curassow</b> (Crax alector) {{is a large}} game {{bird with}} Vulnerable {{conservation}} status found in north-central South America.

At the forest scale, population density was negatively correlated with the abundance of palms and Mimosoideae and positively correlated with the abundance of Lauraceae. Botanical families did not directly influence <b>Black</b> <b>Curassow</b> distribution, but rather determined spatial patterns by being markers of a particular forest type. At the microhabitat scale, Black Curassows used hilltops more frequently than other parts of the local topographical gradient. Our multiscale analysis shows that this species' distribution can be explained by biotic or abiotic conditions, regardless of the scale. For conservation, we recommend maintaining connectivity between <b>Black</b> <b>Curassow</b> populations separated by hunted areas.
