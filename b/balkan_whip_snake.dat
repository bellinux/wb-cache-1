40|$|Captive <b>Balkan</b> <b>whip</b> <b>snakes</b> (Hierophis gemonensis) {{were studied}} to {{determine}} blood biochemical parameters that are useful indicators of physiological status during different periods {{of the biological}} cycle, including pre- and post-hibernation, hibernation, sexual activity, and normal activity. In addition to classic statistical analyses, six machine-learning methods utilizing ten times ten-fold cross-validation evaluation were used {{in order to determine}} the best classification model for the blood biochemistry data. Results of the machine-learning models indicated that using simultaneously three of the blood biochemistry variables – urea, glucose, and lactate dehydrogenase is enough to obtain highly accurate discrimination between different physiological conditions during the biological cycle. This approach clarifies the role and importance of physiological processes which show diversity of functional characteristics of various biochemical parameters in ecological relation to snakes held under laboratory conditions which mimic natural environmental changes...|$|R

50|$|The <b>Balkan</b> <b>whip</b> <b>snake</b> is a diurnal, ground-dwelling species {{though it}} does {{sometimes}} clamber through low vegetation. It is fast and agile and feeds on lizards, large insects such as grasshoppers, nestling birds and small mammals. Females lay clutches of four to ten oval eggs measuring about 30 by 17 mm. It hibernates in winter in such places as rock fissures, animal burrows or outbuildings and sometimes several snakes will share a hibernating site.|$|E
50|$|There {{are four}} species of snake {{on the island}} and these are not {{dangerous}} to humans. The four species include the leopard snake (locally known as Ochendra), the <b>Balkan</b> <b>whip</b> <b>snake</b> (locally called Dendrogallia), the dice snake (called Nerofido in Greek), and the only venomous snake is the nocturnal cat snake which has evolved to deliver a weak venom at the back of its mouth to paralyse geckos and small lizards, and is not dangerous to humans.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Balkan</b> <b>whip</b> <b>snake</b> (Hierophis gemonensis, {{formerly}} known as Coluber gemonensis) is a species of snake in the family Colubridae. It is found in Italy, Cyprus, Greece (including the Greek islands) {{and most of the}} Balkan countries (specifically in Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, the Republic of Macedonia, Serbia and Slovenia) where its natural habitats are Mediterranean-type shrubby vegetation, pastureland, plantations and rural gardens. It is threatened by habitat loss in parts of its range but overall is assessed by the IUCN as being of [...] "least concern".|$|E
50|$|<b>Whip</b> <b>snakes</b> eat mainly lizards. <b>Whip</b> <b>snakes</b> are diurnal (active in the day), and {{use their}} keen {{eyesight}} to hunt. The prey dies quickly {{from the effects of}} the snake's venom.|$|R

50|$|The <b>Balkan</b> <b>whip</b> <b>snake</b> is {{a slender}} snake with smooth scales usually under a metre (yard) long but {{exceptionally}} reaching 130 cm (50 ins). The head is fairly {{distinct from the}} body and has prominent eyes with round pupils. The head and front of the body are olive-grey or yellowish-brown with dark spots separated by paler areas which may form irregular bars. There are often small white specks {{on some of the}} scales. Further back the dark spots are usually arranged in longitudinal lines giving a striped effect. The underparts are whitish or pale yellow, with some spotting {{on the sides of the}} neck and sometimes elsewhere. There are usually 19 dorsal scales around the mid-body, 160 to 187 belly scales and 80 to 116 pairs of under-tail scales.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} the frequency of micronuclei (MN), nuclear abnormalities (NA) including vacuolated nuclei (VN) and cytoplasmic vacuoles (CV) in erythrocytes of <b>Balkan</b> <b>whip</b> <b>snake</b> Hierophis gemonensis and establish the level of spontaneous appearance during the annual cycle. Average frequency of NA was 10. 89 ± 4. 72 % while the MN (0. 03 ± 0. 03 %) and VN(0. 04 ± 0. 08 %) were seldom detected. NA significantly positively correlated with MN (r = 0. 319; P < 0. 05) and VN (r = 0. 363; P < 0. 05). Appearance of CV did not correlate with other measured parameters and average frequency was 11. 06 ± 8. 33 %. Significant seasonal variation was found in NA appearance with the lowest value in spring and the highest in winter. VN increase was observed in autumn. MN and CV levels varied between seasons but not significantly. Considering the biological cycle, frequency of NA, VN, MN and CV recorded in pre-hibernation/hibernation increased compared to the active phase, but only NA elevation was significant. Although the obtained results showed differences according to sex, statistical analysis of measured parameters showed the same pattern of seasonal variation in both sexes...|$|E

50|$|The red <b>whip</b> <b>snake</b> is a slender, long-tailed snake {{that grows}} to {{a length of}} 70 cm in Europe but up to 100 cm {{in the eastern part}} of its range in Asia. It closely resembles Dahl's <b>whip</b> <b>snake</b> but differs in having a smaller, flatter head. The upper surface is reddish-brown or reddish grey, with a dark band with pale margins on the neck and scattered, smaller dark bands with pale rims on the fore-parts, these {{markings}} being more widely spaced than those of Dahl's <b>whip</b> <b>snake.</b> Another distinguishing feature is the fact that the scales on the belly of that species have a keel on each side whereas the belly scales on the red <b>whip</b> <b>snake</b> do not.

5000|$|Signal whips (or signalwhips) are {{a type of}} single-tailed whip, {{originally}} designed to control dog teams. A signal whip usually measures between 3 and 4 feet in length.
