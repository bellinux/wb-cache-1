60|$|For as to {{this world}} in which we live, so to the God who created that world, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a terrible aspect. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> calm: <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> storm also. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> {{fertilizing}} sunshine: <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> also the destroying thunderbolt. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> the solid and fruitful earth, where man can till and build; <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> the earthquake and the flood likewise, which destroy in a moment the works of man. So <b>there</b> <b>is</b> in God boundless love, and boundless mercy: <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>is,</b> too, a wrath of God, and a fire of God which burns eternally against all evil and falsehood. And woe to those who fall under that wrath; who are even scorched for a moment by that fire.|$|R
5|$|Following the McClelland Royal Commission, a large {{clean-up}} {{was completed}} in outback South Australia in 2000, after nuclear testing at Maralinga during the 1950s contaminated the region. The cleanup lasted three years, and cost over A$100million, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> controversy over the methods used and success of the operation.|$|E
5|$|Four {{days later}} on 21 August at 08:30, Orizaba, {{traveling}} with Siboney, spotted a submarine {{in the act}} of submerging. Orizaba attempted to ram the sub and dropped depth charges, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no indication that the attack was successful.|$|E

5|$|In September 1993, {{after the}} field of the hoard find was ploughed, the Suffolk County Council Archaeological Service {{surveyed}} the field, finding four gold coins and 81 silver coins, all {{considered part of the}} same hoard.

5|$|Initially Broccoli and Saltzman {{had wanted}} to produce the eighth Bond novel, 1961's Thunderball, as the first film, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> an ongoing legal dispute between the screenplay's co-author, Kevin McClory and Ian Fleming. As a result, Broccoli and Saltzman chose Dr. No: the timing was apposite, with claims that American rocket testing at Cape Canaveral had {{problems}} with rockets going astray.|$|E

5|$|A minor {{knee injury}} which only left Hunt out {{for two weeks}} was enough to deny him the {{opportunity}} to regain the fullback position for Australia in the Centenary Test against New Zealand in May 2008. Hunt's place in the Queensland team for the 2008 State of Origin series was assured by Queensland coach Mal Meninga <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> speculation that Hunt could play five-eighth in place of injured teammate Darren Lockyer. While not the best five-eighth possibility for the Queensland representative team, his selection there would make way for the Australian fullback Billy Slater. Hunt, having never played a senior rugby league game at five-eighth, was controversially selected at the position for Queensland instead of the in-form Scott Prince.|$|E

5|$|After {{ten days}} she was {{returned}} to sea and reached Port Dalrymple {{on the morning of}} 5 November. Buffalo had already arrived, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no sign of Lady Nelson or Francis. Houstoun's achievement in navigating the storm was recognised through a transfer to Buffalo, a larger and more prestigious vessel than Integrity. His former colonial command was allocated to midshipman Charles Robbins, who was promoted Acting Lieutenant by virtue of his new role. The remaining vessels in the flotilla, Lady Nelson and Francis, arrived in Port Dalrymple on 21 November. Integrity departed a week later, Robbins having been ordered to explore the far western coastline of Van Diemen's Land.|$|E
5|$|After {{these talks}} with Rudd, Lobengula called an indaba (conference) of over 100 izinDuna {{to present the}} {{proposed}} concession terms to them and gauge their sympathies. It {{soon became clear that}} opinion was split: most of the younger izinDuna were opposed to the idea of any concession whatsoever, while the king himself and many of his older izinDuna were open to considering Rudd's bid. The idea of a mining monopoly in the hands of Rudd's powerful backers was attractive to the Matabele in some ways, as it would end the incessant propositioning for concessions by small-time prospectors, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> also a case for allowing competition to continue, so that the rival miners would have to compete for Lobengula's favour.|$|E
5|$|Alex's outer rainbands {{produced}} {{heavy rainfall}} across Virginia, peaking at over 7inches (178mm) {{in the center}} of the state.
