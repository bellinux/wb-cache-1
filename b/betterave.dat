40|$|First of all, the {{formulation}} of possible orientations for research requires {{to keep in mind}} the basic data of the problem, that is the future orientation of the CAP, and the general framework of resource allocation to the different research subsectors. The following ways seem to be particularly successful: (a) the further exploration of perspectives opened by the recent discoveries in genetics, (b) the coverage by the IRBAB (Institut Roayl Belge pour l'Amelioration de la <b>Betterave)</b> of non explored research subsectors by private firms, for instance the organization of comparative tests of any kind, the rapid and continual diffusion of research results and of any informations directly usable by the farmers, (c) a deeper interpretation, under an economic point of view, of experimental results, and (d) the perfecting of new non food products derived from the sugar beet and its by-products. Lastly, the fact that no correlation has been observed between the yields of sugar beet and the direct expenses incurred (seeds, fertilizers, pesticides) confirms the opportunity to pursue the efforts to reduce the production costs...|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of the sugar-beet cyst nematode Heterodera schachtii on excised roots of Brassica napus, grown under gnotobiotic conditions in agar culture, was observed from root invasion of infective second-stage juveniles until death of females. Most of the observations were by time-lapse cinemicrography which revealed a characteristic growth pattern for al 1 developmental stages. This pattern consisted of more or less regular alternations between gradual increases in body volume, followed by sudden collapses. The gradual increase in body volume was always associated with a continuous pumping action of the median oesophageal bulb. As soon as pumping stopped, growth ceased. The sudden collapse in body volume, about 20 min after cessation of bulb pumping, was most prohably due to defaecation, although the expulsion of faeces could not be seen. Growth. of female juveniles was arrested only during moulting which, a t 25. 0, occurred at rather regular intervals of 3 - 4 days. From the average data of continuous food ingestion and changes in body volume, the approximative amounts of daily and overall food consumption for the different developmental stages could be calculated. Total food con-sumption of males was about 29 times {{less than that of}} females.

40|$|Summary- Three {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} study {{the development of the}} sugarbeet cyst nematode, Helerodera schachlii, on host roots lacking foliage. In a microplot experiment, cabbage-root respiration declined in H. schachlii-infected roots that were sequentially sampled after shoot removal. In a greenhouse experiment, the proportion of brown cysts and the number of cysts per g of root increased over time on roots with and without foliage. A third experiment, conducted in growth pouches, revealed that cysts matured and egg number increased on roots in the absence of foliage. Our results reveal that white cysts mature to become brown cysts, egg number per cyst increases, and that juveniles may develop into cysts on roots that are separated from shoots. Thus, sugarbeet cyst nematode numbers may appear to increase {{in the absence of a}} host plant, if viable roots are present in the soil. This occurs because cysts and eggs continue to develop, and also because extraction techniques are generally biased toward extracting brown cysts. Consequently, estimates of H. schachcii population density may be influenced by time of sampling relative to nematode development on root fragments, and management decisions based on egg-density estimates should account for possible increases in cySt nematode densities occurring on root remnants.

40|$|Knowledge of the {{incubation}} period {{of infectious diseases}} (time between host infection and expression of disease symptoms) is crucial to our epidemiological understanding and the design of appropriate prevention and control policies. Plant diseases cause substantial damage to agricultural and arboricultural systems, {{but there is still}} very little information about how the {{incubation period}} varies within host populations. In this paper, we focus on the incubation period of soilborne plant pathogens, which are difficult to detect as they spread and infect the hosts underground and above-ground symptoms occur considerably later. We conducted experiments on Rhizoctonia solani in sugar beet, as an example patho-system, and used modelling approaches to estimate the incubation period distribution and demonstrate the impact of differing estimations on our epidemiological understanding of plant diseases. We present measurements of the incubation period obtained in field conditions, fit alternative probability models to the data, and show that the incubation period distribution changes with host age. By simulating spatially-explicit epidemiological models with different incubation-period distributions, we study the conditions for a significant time lag between epidemics of cryptic infection and the associated epidemics of symptomatic disease. We examine the sensitivity of this lag to differing distributional assumptions about the incubation period (i. e. exponential versus Gamma). We demonstrate that accurate information about the incubation period distribution of a pathosystem can be critical in assessing the true scale of pathogen invasion behind early disease symptoms in the field; likewise, it can be central to model-based prediction of epidemic risk and evaluation of disease management strategies. Our results highlight that reliance on observation of disease symptoms can cause significant delay in detection of soil-borne pathogen epidemics and mislead practitioners and epidemiologists about the timing, extent, and viability of disease control measures for limiting economic loss.

40|$|The soil-borne phytopathogenic fungus, Rhizoctonia solani AG 2 - 2 incites {{damping off}} and root rot in sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.). The disease {{occurs in the}} form of patches of dead or {{necrotic}} plants which show temporal and spatial dynamics within and between seasons. The patches never occur at the same place where they were observed in the previous season. The soil from inside the patches was found less conducive towards the disease caused by R. solani AG 2 - 2 as compared to the soil from healthy areas. The objective {{of the present study was}} to characterize the mechanisms involved in the build up of disease patches caused by R. solani AG 2 - 2 in a sugar beet field, to evaluate the temporal dynamics of the microflora in relation to the pathogenic activity, and to identify the putative biocontrol agents playing a role in the reduced conduciveness of soil. Different components of microflora were related to the reduced conduciveness of soil inside the patches. Soil inoculum density was higher inside the disease patches with soil inoculum potential reduced and there seemed to be a progressive decrease in the inoculum density of R. solani AG 2 - 2 measured by real time PCR with the development of patches. The fungal and bacterial community structures were significantly modified inside the disease patches which also showed a progressive deviation with the development of disease. Modification in the community structures of Trichoderma spp. and increase in their densities inside the patches were evident in the early and the end of the season respectively. Apparently, the equilibrium established between microflora and the infectious activity of R. solani as described above was broken by an exceptional attack of an aerial disease caused by Cercospora beticola. This reveals the role of the plant exudates in response to the necrotic attack as to an aerial attack in the structure of the soil microflora. The present study marked the role of Trichoderma spp. in reduced soil conduciveness along with some unidentified microorganisms. The Trichoderma isolates picked from inside the patches were more antagonistic towards the pathogen as compared to the ones from outside. Most of the isolates identified by morphological and molecular tools belonged to T. velutinum and T. gamsii. The isolates showed different mechanisms to antagonize R. solani AG 2 - 2 including production of volatile and water soluble metabolites, mycoparasitism as well as induced systemic resistance in the host. T. gamsii T 30 proved to be the best antagonistic strain based on the different tests used ranging from Petri dishes to microcosms and bioassays and may present a potential biocontrol of R. solani AG 2 - 2. In conclusion, although mechanisms contributing to the development of patches caused by R. solani in a sugar beet field have been established, some others arised and need to be investigated such the vulnerability of the soil suppressiveness acquired during the patch built up, the high soil inoculum potential remaining as a risk of disease occurrence in the healthy areas, the role of the intra specific diversity based on the antagonistic activity of some populations of Trichoderma and, the mechanism of interactions between these populations and R. solani. Afin d'identifier des mécanismes impliqués dans le développement des foyers causés par Rhizoctonia solani AG 2 - 2 sur betteraves, des échantillons de sol ont été prélevés le long de transects traversant des zones infectieuses et des zones saines dans un champ cultivé en betteraves sucrières. Le potentiel infectieux et la résistance du sol aux maladies dues à R. solani ont été mesurés et comparés. Le sol devient résistant au sein des foyers. L'analyse des structures de communautés bactériennes et fongiques par des méthodes génétiques et biochimiques ont mis en évidence l'émergence de Trichoderma spp. au sein des foyers. Des isolements et une caractérisation génotypique, phénotypique et fonctionnelle de ces Trichoderma spp. ont révélé qu'au sein d'une même espèce (T. gamsii) des populations antagonistes de R. solani s'étaient développé dans les foyers. En milieu contrôlé, la population de T. gamsii testée inhibe fortement le développement et la croissance de celle de R. solani AG 2 - 2 dès que celle dernière atteint une densité seuil. Cela expliquerait que le sol devienne résistant au cœur du foyer mais que l'apparition et le développement initial du foyer ne soient pas contrôlés. Des prélèvements réalisés au cours du temps montrent l'évolution de la structure des communautés microbiennes aboutissant au développement du foyer et révèlent que l'incidence d'une maladie aérienne causée par Cercospora beticola sur le feuillage de la <b>betterave</b> n'est pas neutre vis-à-vis de la microflore tellurique...|$|E

50|$|LGV route {{designers}} {{have tended to}} build new intermediate stations in suburban areas or in the open countryside several kilometers away from cities. This allows TGVs to stop without incurring too great a time penalty, since more time is spent on high-speed track; in addition, many cities' stations are stub-ends, while LGVs frequently bypass cities. In some cases, stations have been built halfway between two communities, such as the station serving Montceau-les-Mines and Le Creusot, and Haute Picardie station between Amiens and Saint-Quentin. The press and local authorities criticised Haute Picardie as being too far from either town to be convenient, and too far from connecting railway lines to be useful for travellers. The station was nicknamed la gare des <b>betteraves</b> ('beet station') as it was surrounded by sugar beet fields during construction. That said, the station is now used by {{a reasonable amount of}} people, especially impressive as it has no service to Paris (so not to extract passengers from Amiens station). This nickname is now applied to similar stations away from town and city centres, whether in the vicinity of beet fields or not.|$|R
