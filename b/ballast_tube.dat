5000|$|Radio {{manufacturers}} {{attempted to}} deviate from traditional heater voltages of 2.5, 5 and 6.3 volts to try and use a 5 tube heater scheme to get as close to 110-120 VAC line voltage. For the 1935 model year, designers {{were able to get}} a 5-tube heater string to total up to 78 volts. This meant that a dropping resistor or line <b>ballast</b> <b>tube</b> was needed to drop the remaining 35-42 volts. If a <b>ballast</b> <b>tube</b> was used, the radio would be marketed as a [...] "6-tube" [...] radio even though one was just a voltage dropping ballast. Other manufacturers used a [...] "line cord resistor", a special AC cord made with resistance wire which replaced a power resistor in the radio chassis. These line cords tend to get warm to the touch after the radio was in use for a while.|$|E
50|$|Vacuum tube {{equipment}} used {{a number of}} tubes, each with a heater requiring {{a certain amount of}} electrical power. In AC/DC equipment, the heaters of all the tubes are connected in series. All the tubes are rated at the same current (typically 100, 150, 300, or 450 mA) but at different voltages, according to their heating power requirements. If necessary, resistance (which can be a <b>ballast</b> <b>tube</b> (barretter), a power resistor or a resistive mains lead are added so that, when the mains voltage is applied across the chain, the specified heating current flows. Some types of ballast resistors were built into an envelope like a tube that was easily replaceable. With mains voltages of around 220 V, the power dissipated by the additional resistance and the voltage drop across it could be quite high, and it was common to use a resistive power cable (mains cord) of defined resistance, running warm, rather than putting a hot resistor inside the case. If a resistive power cable was used, an inexperienced repairer might replace it with a standard cable, or use the wrong length, damaging the equipment and risking a fire.|$|E
40|$|Pressure {{plates are}} widely used to measure soil water {{retention}} properties of soils in the laboratory with axis-translation technique. Imperfect sealing of the pressure chamber, exchange of water vapour between the soil and {{the air in the}} chamber, lack of soil-plate contact, part of the porous plate directly in contact with air in the pressure chamber, and evaporation of water from the <b>ballast</b> <b>tube</b> may lead to incorrect estimation of the water volumes exchanged by the soil. An improved version of a commercial pressure plate apparatus is presented, which proved able to reduce the intrinsic drawbacks of the original design. The system was also equipped with an image-processing based data acquisition system for continuous measurement of exchanged water...|$|E
5000|$|In 1937, as {{its sales}} had climbed to $2,700,000, IRC {{introduced}} a 10-tube Kadette radio for $19.95, a price comparable with many four- and five-tube sets when its 10-tube competitors cost $100 or more. With three <b>ballast</b> <b>tubes,</b> these 10-tube radios {{were met with}} largely negative reviews; {{in the words of}} Alan Voorhees, they were [...] "$20 sets with extra <b>ballast</b> <b>tubes</b> thrown in". They were also reminiscent of 10-tube radios that Verschoor had built between 1925 and 1930 under the [...] "Arborphone" [...] name, which had only five functioning tubes alongside five superfluous ones intended simply to impress prospective customers.|$|R
25|$|The heater's {{failure mode}} is {{typically}} a stress-related fracture of the tungsten wire or {{at a weld}} point and generally occurs after accruing many thermal (power on-off) cycles. Tungsten wire has a very low resistance when at room temperature. A negative temperature coefficient device, such as a thermistor, may be incorporated in the equipment's heater supply or a ramp-up circuit may be employed to allow the heater or filaments to reach operating temperature more gradually than if powered-up in a step-function. Low-cost radios had tubes with heaters connected in series, with a total voltage {{equal to that of}} the line (mains). Some receivers made before World War II had series-string heaters with total voltage less than that of the mains. Some had a resistance wire running the length of the power cord to drop the voltage to the tubes. Others had series resistors made like regular tubes; they were called <b>ballast</b> <b>tubes.</b>|$|R
25|$|Earlier, {{household}} {{clothes dryers}} sometimes incorporated a germicidal lamp {{in series with}} an ordinary incandescent lamp; the incandescent lamp operated as the ballast for the germicidal lamp. A commonly used light in the home in the 1960s in 220â€“240V countries was a circleline <b>tube</b> <b>ballasted</b> by an under-run regular mains filament lamp. Self ballasted mercury-vapor lamps incorporate ordinary tungsten filaments within the overall envelope of the lamp to act as the ballast, and it supplements the otherwise lacking red area of the light spectrum produced.|$|R
25|$|DB {{was awarded}} the Green Property Management Award (Private Housing) in 2002. To make DB a greener town, DBSML, the {{management}} company of DB, has replaced conventional <b>ballasts</b> with energy-saving <b>tubes.</b> The number of lights in common corridors and main entrances of buildings were re-assessed and unnecessary lights were removed. It was thought that a 30% reduction in electricity charges was achieved in La Vista, one of the villages. Apart from energy reduction, flea market, old books collection, old clothes collection and used household items collection have been held {{on a regular basis}} in order to promote recycling.|$|R
2500|$|Another type of tube {{does not}} have {{filaments}} to start it at all. [...] Instant start fluorescent tubes simply use a high enough voltage {{to break down the}} gas and mercury column and thereby start arc conduction. These tubes can be identified by a single pin {{at each end of the}} tube. The lamp holders have a [...] "disconnect" [...] socket at the low-voltage end which disconnects the <b>ballast</b> when the <b>tube</b> is removed, to prevent electric shock. In North America, low-cost lighting fixtures with an integrated electronic ballast use instant start on lamps originally designed for preheating, although it shortens lamp life. This ballast technology isn't common outside North America.|$|R
50|$|LED tube {{lights are}} {{designed}} to physically fit in fixtures intended for fluorescent tubes. Some LED tubular lamps are {{intended to be a}} drop-in replacement into existing fixtures if appropriate ballast is used. Others require rewiring of the fixtures to remove the <b>ballast.</b> An LED <b>tube</b> lamp generally uses many individual Surface-Mounted LEDs which are directional and require proper orientation during installation as opposed to Fluorescent tube lamps which emit light in all directions around the tube. Most LED tube lights available can be used in place of T8, T10, or T12 tube designations, T8 is D26mm, T10 is D30mm, in lengths of 590 mm, 1200 mm and 1500 mm.|$|R

5000|$|LED tubes {{that are}} {{compatible}} with an electronic (HF) <b>ballast.</b> These LED <b>tubes</b> require a fixture that includes a functioning electronic ballast. This type {{has the advantage of}} easy upgrade of the LED tube (compared to installation method 2). Expensive maintenance is a downside. In addition to the LED tube, also the electronic ballast may fail, and it can only be replaced by a qualified electrician. If a LED tube that is compatible with an electronic ballast is installed in an old fluorescent fixture, the question of responsibility must be clarified. Who will be liable for the electronic ballast if it breaks when the LED tube is being installed? The original supplier of the fixture and the coupling device will no longer be responsible if LED tubes with an electronic ballast are used. Therefore, it is worth considering whether electronic ballasts should be scrapped when LED tubes are fitted in old fixtures, particularly in extensive switchover projects. The term retro-fit is also used to refer to these tubes, as the new LED tube will fit into the old fixture without modification. In these cases, the LED tubes may also be compliant with the EN 62776 standard.|$|R
