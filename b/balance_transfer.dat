40|$|The copy {{of record}} is {{available}} at IET Digital Library: [URL] Copyright IET [Full text {{of this paper is}} not available in the UHRA]The Gigabit-capable passive optical network (GPON) has become an attractive and promising solution for the broadband access network. In this paper a novel dynamic bandwidth assignment protocol is proposed to both facilitate the efficient sharing of the upstream channel resource and support differentiated services over GPON. A new concept for the optical network unit bandwidth reporting procedure is developed instead of the conventional reporting of current queue status. The development of a <b>balance</b> <b>transferring</b> enables a bandwidth register and transfer mechanism in which the reported but bandwidth-unassigned requirements from previous allocations can be tracked and manipulated at the optical line termination. Dynamic bandwidth compensation is achieved through the <b>balance</b> <b>transferring</b> mechanism. The combination of the new reporting procedure and the <b>balance</b> <b>transferring</b> mechanism is incorporated into a prioritised resource allocation to accommodate differentiated services. It also efficiently supports the operation of the GPON encapsulation method. Fairness is supported by a proportional allocation scheme among various demands from different customers. The proposed MAC protocol is implemented using the OPNET Modeler platform. Simulated performance characteristics are presented and the GPON dynamic protocol is analysed under varying self-similar traffic loads...|$|R
5000|$|This is {{the normal}} on a credit card. The lower this rate, {{the better for}} the {{consumer}} and the worse for the credit card company [...] The <b>transferred</b> <b>balance</b> {{will be subject to}} same rate as the card's purchase rate. Occasionally the same terms will apply as to purchases that may be interest free until the payment date for the statement on which the transfer appears. More often such <b>transferred</b> <b>balances</b> move immediately to the full purchase rate. Credit card <b>balance</b> <b>transfers</b> involving transfer of funds from a high credit card or a store card to a low- or zero-APR credit card will result in a reduction in monthly for the card holder.|$|R

50|$|Stoozing, a term coined {{outside the}} United States for {{investing}} credit card funds {{in a high}} yield account, requires the card holder to regularly make payments and pay off the complete balance prior to the expiration of the <b>balance</b> <b>transfer</b> offer.
