40|$|Simultaneous sound {{velocity}} measurements and x-ray diffraction studies {{were made on}} wadsleyite (b-Mg 2 SiO 4) to 7 gigapascals and 873 kelvin. The calculated adiabatic bulk (K) and shear (G) moduli yield K (at room conditions) 5 172 (2) gigapascals, dK/dP 5 4. 2 (1), and dK/dT 5 20. 012 (1) gigapascals per kelvin, and G (at room conditions) 5 113 (1) gigapascals, dG/dP 5 1. 5 (1), and dG/dT 5 20. 017 (1) gigapascals per kelvin, respectively. The data imply that the P and S wave velocity contrasts between olivine and wadsleyite require an olivine amount of 38 to 39 percent in the upper mantle to satisfy the observed 410 -kilometer discontinuity, but 55 to 60 percent {{to account for the}} velocity increase through the transition zone. The velocity increases associated with the phase transformation of olivine to wadsleyite (b phase) can be used to infer the proportion of olivine in Earth’s upper mantle by com-parison with the measured 410 -km seismic discontinuity in the mantle. However, be-cause of the lack of experimental data for the elastic properties of these phases at the pres-sure and temperature conditions of the tran-sition zone, the olivine content in the upper mantle has been in debate (1 – 7). Acoustic measurements for olivine are available for temperatures up to 1700 K at room pressure (8) and for transition zone pressures above 10 GPa at room temperature for both olivine (9 – 11) and wadsleyite (12, 13). Elastic-ity studies at high temperatures for wadsleyite had only been possible through static compres-sion experiments that provide indirect determi-nations of the bulk modulus (14, 15); no data have been available for the temperature depen-dence of the wadsleyite shear modulus. Conse-quently, estimates of the olivine content of the upper mantle based on analysis of the seismic discontinuity at 410 -km depth have ranged from 27 to 65 % (3 – 6, 10, 11). Here we report data obtained for pressures up to 7 GPa and temperatures up to 873 K. We incorporated ultrasonic techniques for use in a DIA-type, cubic-anvil apparatus (SAM 85) installed on the superconducting wiggler beamline (X 17 B) at the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS) of the Brookhaven Na-tional Laboratory (16).

40|$|Delineation of {{lithology}} and mineralization {{of different}} rock {{units of the}} Chinese Continental Scientific Drilling Main Hole (CCSD-MH), Eastern China, is the main objective of this study. Different logging operations were conducted in the studied area. Subduction and metamorphism lead to high compressional wave velocity (Vp) and low neutron density (CNL) values of different rocks. Eclogites and ultramafics show high <b>bulk</b> density (<b>DEN)</b> and photoelectric index (Pe) values, due to their high content of heavy and basic minerals. Gneisses are more radioactive (GR) and resistive (RD), since they have high feldspar content. Serpentinization causes in high CNL values of ultramafics. Retrogression of eclogites to amphibolite facies detected from the general decrease of DEN, Pe, Vp and RD and increase of GR and CNL values. This is mainly due to the secondary alteration and break down of heavy and basic minerals to retrograde materials such as amphibole, mica, zoisite and quartz during exhumation process. Shearing of paragneisses lowers their Vp values. Generally mineralization increases DEN, Pe of eclogites and decreases their GR value and decreases DEN, Pe of the gneisses and increases their GR readings...|$|R
40|$|In {{petroleum}} exploration, {{the acoustic}} log (DT) is popularly {{used as an}} estimator to calculate formation porosity, to carry out petrophysical studies, or to participate in geological analysis and research (e. g., to map abnormal pore-fluid pressure). But sometime it {{does not exist in}} those old wells drilled 20 years ago, either because of data loss or because of just being not recorded at that time. Thus synthesizing the DT log becomes the necessary task for the researchers. In this paper we propose using kernel extreme learning machine (KELM) to predict missing sonic (DT) logs when only common logs (e. g., natural gamma ray: GR, deep resistivity: REID, and <b>bulk</b> density: <b>DEN)</b> are available. The common logs are set as predictors and the DT log is the target. By using KELM, a prediction model is firstly created based on the experimental data and then confirmed and validated by blind-testing the results in wells containing both the predictors and the target (DT) values used in the supervised training. Finally the optimal model is set up as a predictor. A case study for wells in GJH survey from the Erdos Basin, about velocity inversion using the KELM-estimated DT values, is presented. The results are promising and encouraging...|$|R
40|$|As an {{alternative}} to computing large-scale simulations of cosmic structure formation in ever larger periodic boxes, we design a relatively small set of modest sample patches constrained to have bulk physical properties which characterize the main statistical variations from sample to sample. Statistical quantities computed for each simulated patch are combined using Bayes theorem, with this importance sampling ending when a required accuracy is achieved. We have found that patch-smoothed shear values, spanning the range from void-like to overdense regions, are excellent control parameters for the constrained <b>bulk</b> properties, <b>dening</b> patches". It is essential {{to ensure that the}} mass resolution scale be small enough to capture the essential physics, and that the patches be large enough to avoid extreme tidal distortion over the redshift range of interest. Long wavelengths and tidal forces must be properly included for each shearing patch simulated. An advantage of this technique is that it can be naturally ∥ by shell". We developed a fast and accurate TreePM-SPH code with low memory cost which allow us to evolve shearing patches with strong tides in single processors, with cross-talk only occurring at the post-processing level of the statistical quantities of interest, a radical compression of the patch information. Long waves are incorporated by optimally sampling k-space out to arbitratily large scales, and simulating non-periodically with multiple particle masses and linearly evolved external tides. We demonstrate the technique for the Lyman- forest, using a set of modest simulations resolving the essential Jeans scale (0. 1 Mpc). The resulting dynamic patches combine to match the observed Lyman- absorber column density characteristics including the sharp change in dn=d...|$|R
40|$|Evaluations of {{the poetry}} of C. M. van den Heever This article traces the {{assessments}} {{of the value of}} the poetic work by the Afrikaans author C. M. van den Heever since the second quarter of the twentieth century. Appreciation of him as poet mainly revolves around his role as transitional figure in the important renewal of Afrikaans poetry in the 1930 s, as can be seen from two rather divergent critiques by D. J. Opperman (completed in 1946 and 1952, respectively). An outstanding contribution by Van den Heever in this regard is the introduction of elements of Dutch poetry from around the turn of the nineteenth century to the Afrikaans literary world. A critic such as T. T. Cloete, in an article dating from 1957, convincingly argues that aspects of Van den Heever’s poetic style and technique, which other critics had sometimes judged harshly, are largely functional in co-communicating the specific (passively transcendental) attitude towards life and reality conveyed in Van den Heever’s work. Local and international shifts in the dominant literary approaches, however, have caused singularly confessional poetry – such as the <b>bulk</b> of Van <b>den</b> Heever’s poetic output – to be increasingly marginalised since the mid- 1930 s. In this respect he shares the fate of Dutch poet A. Roland Holst, whose poetry was influential in shaping the characteristics of Van den Heever’s...|$|R
40|$|Depressive {{and anxiety}} {{disorders}} are often first diagnosed during adolescence {{and it is}} known that they persist into adulthood. Previous studies often tried to dissociate depressive and anxiety disorders, but high comorbidity makes this difficult and maybe even impossible. The goal {{of this study was to}} use neuroimaging to test what the unique contribution is of depression and anxiety symptomatology on emotional processing and amygdala activation, and to compare the results with a healthy control group. We included 25 adolescents with depressive and/or anxiety disorders and 26 healthy adolescents. Participants performed an emotional face processing task while in the MRI scanner. We were particularly interested in the relation between depression/anxiety symptomatology and patterns of amygdala activation. There were no significant differences in activation patterns between the control group and the clinical group on whole brain level and ROI level. However, we found that dimensional scores on an anxiety but not a depression subscale significantly predicted brain activation in the right amygdala when processing fearful, happy and neutral faces. These results suggest that anxiety symptoms are a better predictor for differentiating activation patterns in the amygdala than depression symptoms. Although the current study includes a relatively large sample of treatment naïve adolescents with depression/anxiety disorders, results might be influenced by differences between studies in recruitment strategies or methodology. Future research should include larger samples with a more equal distribution of adolescents with a clinical diagnosis of depression and/or anxiety. To conclude, this study shows that abnormal amygdala responses to emotional faces in depression and anxiety seems to be more dependent on anxiety symptoms than on depression symptoms, and thereby highlights the need for more research to better characterize clinical groups in future studies. © 2014 van <b>den</b> <b>Bulk,</b> Meens, van Lang, de Voogd, van der Wee, Rombouts, Crone and Vermeiren...|$|R
40|$|The ingestive {{behaviour}} of Red deer and/or Romney sheep {{was examined}} {{in relation to}} two major components of sward structure, height (HT) and <b>bulk</b> density (<b>DEN),</b> by measuring the depth, area and rate of biting {{on a series of}} artificial swards. HT and DEN effects were examined in a series of four short-term indoor grazing experiments using two novel mini-sward techniques, developed to minimise confounding of HT with DEN and other differences in tiller structure. The first experiment used the deep, leafy horizon of tall vegetative sorghum swards, whereas the next three experiments used seedling wheat swards. A fifth experiment using both ryegrass and wheat swards built upon the previous four experiments (examining HT and DEN effects), by measuring the bite dimensions of sheep in relation to changes in tiller structure down the sward profile. Wheat seedlings grew on seed reserves and achieved a high degree of separation of HT and DEN variation, enabling the description and conceptualisation of how bite parameters respond to independent HT and/or DEN variation. However, when compared to natural grass swards these seedling swards, with 100 % green matter and low shear strength, resulted in large bite volumes and high bite rates. Bite depth increased rapidly and linearly with increasing HT, and at a slightly greater rate the sparser the sward, although on very short swards (< 3 - 4 cm) bite depth was insensitive to even large changes in DEN. High levels of dead matter had no influence upon the bite depth of sheep grazing ryegrass swards. Similarly, the tops of the pseudostems had little if any influence upon the bite depth of deer or sheep grazing wheat or ryegrass swards. However, sheep avoided penetrating the tough rigid pseudostem at the base of ryegrass swards when leaf-like immature pseudostem was available in the overlying strata. Bite depth averaged 70 % of HT on the sorghum and seedling wheat swards, appreciably deeper than that typical for natural grass swards. As the HT of wheat swards increased from minimum grazable levels, bite area increased rapidly as increasing tiller length enabled greater horizontal displacement of tillers. However, the rate of increase soon declined and bite area plateaued as mouth dimensions rather than HT (tiller length) constrained the area of herbage which animals could efficiently prehend per bite. As DEN increased, animals reduced bite area so that HT became less of a constraint; consequently, bite area plateaued at lower maxima on shorter swards. The rate of increase in bite area was low relative to the rate of decline in DEN (or tiller shear strength), probably in part reflecting the way mouth dimensions limit the ability of animals to adjust bite area upwards as DEN or tiller strength decline to low levels. Further, there was evidence that the forces required to sever a bite differed considerably across sward treatments. The potential influences of bite depth, HT and mouth dimensions upon the efficiency of tiller capture per bite, were examined in simple models. These indicated that by penetrating to around 40 - 50 % of HT, as is commonly the case, animals appear to optimise grazing efficiency in terms of the number, length and quality of tillers captured, per unit of grazing effort. Bite weight increased linearly in relation to HT and DEN, but HT had the dominant influence, because bite volume increased with HT but declined with DEN. However, bite weight still increased rapidly with DEN, because the rate of reduction in bite volume was much lower than the rate of increase in DEN. Bite rate declined linearly in relation to increasing HT and DEN, primarily because of their influence upon bite weight. However, bite rate was slightly more sensitive to increases in bite weight due to HT than DEN, evidently because bites of dense herbage required less gathering, while bites of long herbage required extra jaw movements to draw them into the mouth and/or reduce particle size. Rate of intake increased at a declining rate with HT. The effects of HT and DEN were interactive on short swards but became largely independent and additive as HT increased. Deer and sheep grazed the sorghum and wheat swards representing a very wide range of HT and DEN variation to a similar depth. However, sheep were able to graze 1 cm swards, whereas the minimum HT grazed by deer was 2 cm. Further, not only did sheep have larger mouths in relation to body size, they also appeared to be superior at prehending short swards compared to deer. However, the bite area of deer increased more rapidly with HT, and to higher peak levels in line with their larger mouth dimensions. Reflecting these differences, bite weight per kg LW 1. 0 was much higher for sheep than deer on short swards, but the proportional difference declined with increasing HT. Practical implications are that deer would require more HT than sheep to obtain equivalent intakes. The results are considered in relation to evidence on the foraging strategy of free grazing ruminants...|$|R
