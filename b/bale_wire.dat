5000|$|Baling wire is {{sometimes}} {{used in an}} informal, make-do manner as an easy fix. It is frequently referred to {{as one of the}} basic repair materials. Typical uses range from supporting loose mufflers to patching chain-link fences. Common phrases often include <b>baling</b> <b>wire</b> as an ad hoc, fix-anything material, alongside chewing gum, duct tape, and the cable tie.|$|R
50|$|According to William Robbins, {{writing on}} the postwar timber boom in the Coos Bay region of Oregon,The {{immediate}} postwar years in southwestern Oregon were {{the heyday of the}} storied gyppo logging and sawmill operator - the hardy individual who worked on marginal capital, usually through subcontracts with a major company or broker, and whose equipment was invariably pieced together with <b>baling</b> <b>wire.</b>|$|R
50|$|Electrolysis is {{also used}} in the {{cleaning}} and preservation of old artifacts. Because the process separates the non-metallic particles from the metallic ones, it is very useful for cleaning {{a wide variety of}} metallic objects, from old coins to even larger objects including rusted cast iron cylinder blocks and heads when rebuilding automobile engines. Rust removal from small iron or steel objects by electrolysis can be done in a home workshop using simple materials such as a plastic bucket, tap water, lengths of rebar, washing soda, <b>baling</b> <b>wire,</b> and a battery charger.|$|R
50|$|On the bridge, Hart {{was ordered}} {{out of the}} car, {{and one of the}} kidnappers struck him twice on the head from behind with a {{concrete}} block until he was unconscious. They then bound his arms with <b>baling</b> <b>wire</b> before dumping him into San Francisco Bay. The tide was out and there was only a few feet of water {{at the base of the}} bridge, so the kidnappers shot Hart, killing him. A few hours later, they placed a telephone call to the Hart family demanding $40,000 for Hart's return, with further instructions to follow.|$|R

5000|$|The ration {{boxes were}} shipped in a {{rectangular}} cardboard packing case. Each packing case contained 12 ration cartons (containing {{one of each}} meal) packed in 2 rows of 6 rations. They were grouped in 3 menus of 4 meals each, organized by their [...] "B"-unit (B-1, B-2, & B-3). It also contained 4 paper-wrapped P-38 can openers to open the cans. Each packing case weighed 25 to 26 lb and had a volume of 0.8713 cuft L. Early cases were bound with <b>baling</b> <b>wire,</b> but late Vietnam War and post-war cases were bound in plastic strapping.|$|R
5000|$|Many of the reviewers of {{the series}} and movie reflect the common in-universe opinion of the ship; {{describing}} Serenity as a [...] "battered old jalopy of a space craft", [...] "a rattletrap transport ship ... held together by 26th-century chewing gum and duct tape", or [...] "a ship {{that seems to be}} held together with <b>baling</b> <b>wire</b> and paper clips", Some reviewers, while making comparisons between Firefly’s Malcolm Reynolds and Han Solo from Star Wars, invoke the Millennium Falcon when talking about Serenity: [...] "a scrap heap of a spaceship in the Millennium Falcon mold", or [...] "a Millennium Falcon-style rust bucket".|$|R
50|$|From 1870-1930, Hertz Metal Company {{produced}} <b>baling</b> <b>wire</b> {{and also}} operated a lead smelter. In 1876 Provident Chemical Works became {{a world leader}} in production of phosphates from its Carondelet Plant {{in a process that}} initially involved lead. In the 1920s the plant was purchased by Swann Chemical Company, and then in 1935 by Monsanto. The River des Peres was rerouted through the plant in the 1930s as part of a Works Progress Administration project. Monsanto spun off the production to Solutia. In 2000 it became part of Astaris and then Israel Chemical Limited. The plant produces 250 million pounds per year of phosphate and phosphoric acid products.|$|R
50|$|Bales {{prior to}} 1937 were {{manually}} wire-tied with two <b>baling</b> <b>wires.</b> Even earlier, the baler was a stationary implement, driven with a tractor or stationary engine using a belt on a belt pulley, with the hay {{being brought to}} the baler and fed in by hand.Later, balers were made mobile, with a 'pickup' to gather up the hay and feed it into the chamber. These often used air cooled gasoline engines mounted on the baler for power. The biggest change {{to this type of}} baler since 1940 is being powered by the tractor through its power take-off (PTO), instead of by a built-in internal combustion engine.|$|R
5000|$|By far {{the most}} popular of the {{submitted}} myths are those regarding perpetual motion - it was claimed in an interview by Adam that there was enough material to create three seasons of busting potential free energy machines. One test (different from the included radio device), cut for time and shown on [...] "MythBusters Outtakes" [...] involves coils of <b>baling</b> <b>wire</b> being used to siphon off electricity from nearby PG&E power lines in the Santa Cruz Mountains.

40|$|Straw bale is a {{sustainable}} building material that repurposes agricultural waste {{for use in}} the structural system of buildings. This material will be used as a component in the lateral force resisting systems of walls, especially helpful in the California seismic environment and under heavy wind loads. The four main components of a post-and-beam method straw bale wall are timber framing, straw <b>bales,</b> <b>wire</b> mesh, and plaster. This report will focus on the design of the exterior plaster and the design of “workhorse” and “strong” walls for simple construction and areas of higher seismic activity, respectively. Our test results will be used to validate straw bale as a viable structural material for future building code development...|$|R
5000|$|Steel is {{the oldest}} and highest tensile {{strength}} strapping. It is available {{in a variety of}} widths and thicknesses as well as variations in the grade of steel. Steel is used for heavy duty holding where high strength and minimal stretch are desired. Surface finishes for steel strap include: paint, paint and wax, bluing or zinc and wax. The wax is used to better transmit the tension around the bundle and for use with certain types of tensioners. Common applications include steel coils, bundles of metal, <b>baling</b> <b>wire,</b> bricks and pavers, and roll end-binding. Steel Strapping is sold by weight rather than length, due to the natural expansion and contraction of steel in the manufacturing process. A 3/4 x [...]020 Steel Strapping Coil yields approximately 19.6 feet per pound.|$|R

50|$|In the United States, Australia, {{and around}} the world, <b>baling</b> <b>wire</b> was used in {{mechanical}} hay balers pulled behind a tractor. The automated balers used a wire twister that first cut then twisted {{the ends of the}} wire such that the bale kept its shape after the baler had pressed the hay into a tight rectangular bale. These hay balers were in common use up until the late 1980s. When the hay was fed to livestock the wire was cut and often hung in bundles or stored in barrels or metal drums around the farm. Farmers used the soft wire for temporary repairs of almost everything you could think of on the farm, from fences, old leather horse harnesses, head stalls and bridles, to pins to keep castellated nuts in place on the tractor. Even tiny screwdrivers were made by cutting a short length of wire and looping one end for grip. The other end was then flattened and shaped to make a screwdriver for specialized tasks like replacing the tiny screws in reading glasses.|$|R
50|$|The {{beginning}} of Northwestern Steel and Wire Co. (NWSW) {{can be traced}} back to W.M. Dillon's move to Rock Falls, Illinois from Ohio. He founded Northwestern Barbed Wire Co. upon his arrival in 1879. In 1892 Dillon partnered with J.W. Griswold to form Dillon-Griswold Company. Dillon-Griswold produced barbed <b>wire,</b> <b>bale</b> ties, drawn <b>wire,</b> and nails. Dillon left the company in 1902 to devote himself fully to his own Rock Falls operation. By 1912 the Griswold Company had landed itself in receivership and its assets were liquidated to the Lawrence Brothers of Sterling, Illinois. Within the next week Dillon had purchased the Griswold Co. from the Lawrence Brothers and moved Northwestern Barbed Wire to Sterling.|$|R
5000|$|Wire is versatile, {{and wire}} clothes hangers {{are often used}} as cheap sources of semi-tough wire, more {{available}} than <b>baling</b> <b>wire</b> {{for all sorts of}} home projects. The use of wire clothes hangers for use as makeshift welding rod has been common for nearly 100 years. Similarly, many similar do-it-yourself and children's projects use wire hangers as holders of various types, from keeping a brake caliper from hanging by the brake line during auto repair work, to securing a gate on a bird cage. The much-loved 'Advent Crown' made for children's TV programme Blue Peter was made from four wire coathangers. Coathangers {{can be used to make}} dowsing rods. After sanding, wire hangers also find uses as conducting wire for uses as varied as hot wiring cars to games [...] to testing hand steadiness. They are commonly used to gain forcible entry into older automobiles whose locks and entry systems are not protected from such methods. There is a long history of using wire coat hangers as replacement car radio antennas. Clothes hangers are also commonly used as an implement for roasting marshmallows or hot dogs at camp-outs.|$|R

5000|$|You may {{say that}} Corrigan's flight could not be {{compared}} to Lindbergh's in its sensational appeal as the first solo flight across the ocean. Yes, but in another way the obscure little Irishman's flight was the more audacious of the two. Lindbergh had a plane specially constructed, the finest money could buy. He had lavish financial backing, friends to help him at every turn. Corrigan had nothing but his own ambition, courage, and ability. His plane, a nine-year-old Curtiss Robin, was the most wretched-looking jalopy.As I looked over it at the Dublin airdrome I really marveled that anyone should have been rash enough even {{to go in the}} air with it, much less try to fly the Atlantic. He built it, or rebuilt it, practically as a boy would build a scooter out of a soapbox and a pair of old roller skates. It looked it. The nose of the engine hood was a mass of patches soldered by Corrigan himself into a crazy-quilt design. The door behind which Corrigan crouched for twentyeight hours was fastened together with a piece of <b>baling</b> <b>wire.</b> The reserve gasoline tanks put together by Corrigan, left him so little room that he had to sit hunched forward with his knees cramped, and not enough window space to see the ground when landing.|$|R
40|$|Every {{two years}} {{a survey of}} custom {{operators}} is conducted to determine the current rates charged for specific machinery operations. The PRELIMINARY results reported here reflect only the statewide results for Part I, which includes {{the spring and summer}} operations such as planting and small grains harvest. This is not the full report for all operations. Custom rates reported include charges for the use of necessary equipment, fuel and supplies such as <b>baling</b> <b>wire</b> or twine provided by the custom operator, and labor. Seed, fertilizer and chemical costs are not included. This survey is not based on a random sample of custom operators in Nebraska. Questionnaires were sent to all the individuals on our custom operator’s mailing list. Thus, the results reflect the average of those who responded to the specific questions, but may not be representative of the rates charged in a particular area. The Average Rate for a specific operation provides an estimate of the prevailing charge, with its reliability improving as the number of responses increase. The Most Common Rate is the rate reported more often than any other for that practice. Usually the Average Rate and the Most Common Rate are similar. The Average Rate is calculated to the nearest cent, while the Most Common Rate is more generally reported to the nearest dollar. The Range gives the minimum and the maximum amounts reported. It may be indicative of different conditions under which the work was performed. The range also may reflect the fact that some rates consider travel to and from the field, while others do not...|$|R
