Results indicated that the polyester/cotton core-spun thread produced seams with greater <b>breaking</b> strength and <b>elongation</b> than mercerized cotton thread for all comparable sets of specimens. Seams constructed with polyester/cotton core-spun thread also tended to exhibit greater seam <b>breaking</b> strength and <b>elongation</b> than those seamed with bonded nylon monocord thread. The nylon thread, in turn, tended to produce stronger and more extensible seams than did mercerized cotton thread. The elastic straight stitch (a triple lockstitch) produced seams with greater <b>breaking</b> strength and <b>elongation</b> than either of the other stitch types. Most seams stitched with the lockstitch with stretch had a higher mean seam <b>breaking</b> strength and <b>elongation</b> than comparable seams stitched with the zigzag stitch, Stitch length affected seam <b>breaking</b> strength and <b>elongation</b> to a greater extent with the zigzag than with the lockstitch with stretch. For most comparable sets of zigzag specimens, increases in the number of stitches per inch were accompanied by increases in seam <b>breaking</b> strength and <b>elongation.</b> With the lockstitch, those differences which were significant indicated that the shorter stitches were related to greater <b>breaking</b> strength and <b>elongation.</b> Seams parallel to the courses were related to greater seam <b>breaking</b> strength and <b>elongation</b> than seams parallel to the wales...|$|R

Data resulting from the standard testing procedures were tested statistically by analysis of variance or the Student's "t" test. Associations were determined by Pearson's correlation coefficient. Differences occurred among and within both the brands {{and the types of}} thread. Single strand breaking load varied significantly only among the tow spun black threads. The loop breaking strength of the tow spun threads was greater than that of the core spun threads. The core spun black threads were stronger than the core spun white threads in loop breaking strength.

Breaking strength, elongation, elastic modulus, abrasion resistence etc. are some important factors which will represent {{the performance of the}} yarn. It is therefore of utmost importance to determine this characteristic accurately. Raw material characteristics influence properties of the knitted products. The yarns are subjected to mechanical stress during knitting and while wearing the products. The most common types of force applied to knitted fabrics is traction, which usually does not exceed 25 to 30 % of breaking strength.

The issue is relevant to textile companies that manufacture fabrics from various natural fibres and its blends. During the manufacturing process, it has been noticed that finishing has a negative effect on end-use properties, such as abrasion resistance and pilling. Moreover, finishing has an impact on mechanical properties of fibres, such as <b>breaking</b> force and <b>elongation</b> at <b>break.</b> Therefore, this work analyses the abovementioned mechanical (<b>breaking</b> force and <b>elongation</b> at <b>break)</b> properties of yarn and fabrics made of it and end-use (abrasion resistance and pilling) properties of grey fabrics and finished fabrics. It has been determined that the strength and tension rates of used yarn have an impact on fabrics and its <b>breaking</b> force and <b>elongation</b> at <b>break.</b> The fabric finishing affects the properties of the mentioned fabrics, i. e. breaking force decreases after finishing, while the <b>elongation</b> at <b>break</b> increases. During finishing, fabrics undergo various chemical and mechanical impacts which might decrease the quality of fabrics. On the other hand, fabrics become denser, its threads crimp, and thus fabrics become more tensile. Finishing affects end-use fabric properties as well (resistance to abrasion and pilling). These properties of fabrics worsen. Dependencies are described by linear equations. During the abrasion resistance analysis, almost all of the dependencies were strong. Abrasion resistance of grey fabrics was higher than those after finishing. Pilling resistance of grey fabrics is also better than of fabrics after finishing. Pilling resistance dependencies on the number of abrasion cycles were mostly of medium strength.

40|$|POY yarns {{are well}} know and commercialized since 1970 s. On the other hand, air-jet {{textured}} yarns are very common {{due to their}} unique structure which looks like natural spun-staple yarns. In the air-jet texturing process, the yarn is textured by overfeeding into a high-pressure of air to create a looped and more natural yarn appearance and also the bulkiness level of the yarn is controlled by input speed and jet-take out speed. This process reassigns flat, continous synthetic yarns into entangled, convoluted, bulky, spun like structured yarns. They are of higher bulk, exhibits increased covering power, have a more subdued lustre and are warmer in hand. Therefore, air-jet textured yarns possess some unique properties that require investigation. Hence, in this study, first the texturing process is introduced briefly and its principle of manufacturing is illustrated, later four different types of yarns were produced with two different fibre cross-sections at the three different nozzle types and three different core yarn feeding. The produced yarn production details are given and their <b>breaking</b> strength, <b>elongation</b> and work of rupture are studied along with their morphological structures by using light microscope and SEM. The {{aim of this study}} is to investigate the effect of POY fibre cross-section on air-jet textured yarn mechanical properties. The overall results showed that coarser air-jet textured yarns with a round shape have higher <b>breaking</b> strength, <b>elongation</b> and work of rupture than the trilobal shaped yarns. On the other hand, half matted yarn which was applied TiO 2 has also presented better <b>breaking</b> strength and <b>elongation...</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{last two}} decades fused {{deposition}} modelling (FDM) {{has emerged as a}} standout amongst the most broadly utilized process for fabrication of 3 D functional parts in bone tissue engineering. However this technique is still facing substantial problems to produce porous structure having sufficient mechanical strength. In this present research an exertion has been made to develop a bio-compatible FDM filament which has been further used to fabricate 3 D porous structure. The results of the study highlighted the effect of FDM process parameters (infill percentage, infill speed and layer thickness) on the tensile properties (percentage elongation at peak, percentage <b>elongation</b> at <b>break</b> and yield stress) of the 3 D functional prototypes. It has been observed that infill percentage has major contribution i. e. 92 % towards peak elongation, 91 % towards <b>break</b> <b>elongation</b> and 80 % towards yield stress. The remaining two parameters have very less contribution towards mechanical properties of the 3 D structures. For microscopic analysis the microphotographs of scanning electron microscope (SEM) have been taken to ensure the structure produced is porous enough and {{can be used in a}} variety of engineering and biomedical applications...|$|R
