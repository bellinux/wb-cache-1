5|$|Relay {{races are}} the only track and field event in which a team of runners {{directly}} compete against other teams. Typically, a team {{is made up of}} four runners of the same sex.

A team may also be disqualified if its runners are deemed to have wilfully impeded other competitors.|$|E

5|$|The Queen's <b>Baton</b> Relay, is a relay {{around the}} world held prior to the {{beginning}} of the Commonwealth Games. The <b>Baton</b> carries a message from the Head of the Commonwealth, currently Queen Elizabeth II.

5|$|Competing in the 2016 Summer Olympics, Gay ran {{the third}} leg for the USA relay 4 x 100 meters team. The team {{consisted}} of Justin Gatlin, Mike Rodgers, Trayvon Bromell, and Gay. The team finished third, behind Jamaica and Japan. However, Gay once again {{was stripped of}} an Olympic medal, as the American team was disqualified for Justin Gatlin committing a violation. The rule cited was 170.7, which deals with the <b>baton</b> exchange; when Rodgers passed the <b>baton</b> to Gatlin, the <b>baton</b> touched Gatlin's hand before it reached the exchange zone. The American 4 × 100 m relay team was disqualified in Rio, hence making Tyson Gay the fastest man in history to not win a medal at the Olympics. As a result, the Canadian team anchored by Andre de Grasse was awarded bronze.|$|E
