5000|$|Although ISO 13943 defines {{flashover}} as [...] "transition to a {{state of}} total surface involvement in a fire of combustible materials within an enclosure," [...] a broad definition that embraces several different scenarios, including <b>backdrafts,</b> there is nevertheless considerable disagreement regarding whether or not <b>backdrafts</b> should be properly considered flashovers. The most common use of the term flashover is to describe the near-simultaneous ignition of material caused by heat attaining the autoignition temperature of the combustible material and gases in an enclosure; flashovers of this type are not <b>backdrafts</b> as they are caused by thermal change. <b>Backdrafts,</b> however, are caused by the introduction of oxygen into an enclosure that may already be hot enough for ignition; thus, <b>backdrafts</b> are caused by chemical change.|$|R

25|$|Cameron's {{choice of}} cinematographer {{on the movie}} was Mikael Salomon â€“ a US-based Danish {{national}} who {{would go on to}} work on other blockbusters such as <b>Backdraft</b> and Arachnophobia before moving into the director's slot on a myriad of films and TV shows including two editions of the acclaimed HBO WW2 series Band of Brothers. Salomon used three cameras in watertight housings that were specially designed. Another special housing was designed for scenes that went from above-water dialogue to below-water dialogue. The filmmakers had {{to figure out how to}} keep the water clear enough to shoot and dark enough to look realistic at 2,000 feet (700 m), which was achieved by floating a thick layer of plastic beads in the water and covering the top of the tank with an enormous tarpaulin. Cameron wanted to see the actors' faces and hear their dialogue, and thus hired Western Space and Marine to engineer helmets which would remain optically clear underwater and installed state-of-the-art aircraft quality microphones into each helmet. Safety conditions were also a major factor with the installation of a decompression chamber on site, along with a diving bell and a safety diver for each actor.|$|E

500|$|During {{the early}} stages of development, some members of Sonic Team visited Hong Kong shortly before the {{transfer}} of British sovereignty, in hopes of finding inspiration for the game's stages. Some staff also travelled to Universal Studios in California to experience the <b>Backdraft</b> attraction to learn how to generate a similar sensation in the game. The team also visited a special firefighting event in Tokyo where they witnessed robots putting out fires, and were surprised to see how it compared to their image of the game's futuristic setting. Naka recalled that the robot had special infrared sensors and a camera which could see through fires, and was impressed by their techniques. According to Naka, the team did not ask for advice from professional firefighters during development, partly due to the concern that their game would not be well received, as Naka thought they would have said that real firefighting [...] "wasn't that simple". At the Tokyo Games Show, a real firefighter, however, did comment that the character's costumes were too thin. Naka reflected that if they had made any of game elements highly realistic, the contrast between those elements and the clearly fictional elements would have been exaggerated.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{turbulent}} mixing within gravity currents preceding <b>backdrafts</b> and validates {{the ability of}} the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software Fire Dynamics Simulator version 4 (FDS) to simulate these flows. <b>Backdrafts</b> are rapid deflagrations, which occur after the introduction of oxygen into compartments containing unburned gaseous fuel. They may form large fireballs out of the compartment opening and present a significant hazard to the safety of fire-fighters. Gravity currents which precede <b>backdrafts</b> are responsible for the formation of flammable gas mixtures required for ignition. Scale saltwater modelling is used to generate Boussinesq, fully turbulent gravity currents for five different opening geometries, typical of fire compartments. Width-integrated concentration fields and two-dimensional velocity fields are generated using the non-intrusive light attenuation (LA) and particle tracking velocimetry (PTV) flow visualisation techniques respectively. Numerical simulations are carried out with FDS to replicate these flows. The experimental and numerical results are compared directly. Front velocities are shown to be governed directly by local buoyancy conditions, in the later stages of the flows, and therefore the initial conditions associated with the opening geometries only influence the front velocities indirectly. The internal concentration structure, internal velocity structure and location of potential flammable regions are found to be highly opening geometry dependent. In general, the results of the numerical simulations are quantitatively similar to those from experiment, which suggests that the numerical model realistically predicted the experimental flows. However, the numerical concentration fields appear slightly lumpier than those from the experiments, possibly due to unresolved turbulence on scales smaller than the numerical grid (0. 01 H, where H = compartment height) ...|$|R

2500|$|Some fire {{fighting}} tactics {{may appear to}} be destructive, but often serve specific needs. For example, during [...] "ventilation" [...] firefighters are often forced to open holes in the roof or floors of a structure (called [...] "vertical ventilation") or open windows or walls (called [...] "horizontal ventilation") to remove smoke and heated gases from the interior of the structure. Such ventilation methods are also used to improve interior visibility facilitating locating victims more quickly. This also helps to preserve the life of trapped or unconscious individuals as it vents the poisonous gases from inside of the structure. Vertical ventilation is absolutely vital to firefighter safety {{in the event of a}} flashover or <b>backdraft</b> scenario. Releasing the flammable gasses through the roof often eliminates the possibility of a <b>backdraft</b> and by the removal of heat the possibility of a flashover is reduced significantly. Flashovers, due to their intense heat (900â€“1200Â° Fahrenheit) and explosive temperaments are almost always fatal to firefighter personnel. Precautionary methods, such as smashing a window, often reveal <b>backdraft</b> situations before the firefighter enters the structure and is met with the circumstance head-on. Firefighter safety is the number one priority.|$|E

40|$|A {{large and}} growing body of {{research}} has proven that there are important and often dangerous interactions taking place in homes across America. The key element in all of these findings is a new understanding of the pressure differences and the resulting air flows that are occurring in our homes. These powerful driving forces or pressures are caused by the fans in HVAC systems and venting appliances. Other contributory factors are today's tight building envelopes. door closure and badly leaking forced air duct systems. We now know that on average 25 %- 40 % of the air handler fan flow is either coming from, or being lost to, areas outside of the thermal envelope by residential duct systems. My experience in testing and repairing over 1, 000 homes in Austin, Texas has confirmed these findings. It has also been shown in tracer gas testing that in most homes the air change rate of the home will double or triple when the HVAC system is in operation thus introducing large amounts of moisture and heat into the house. Another surprising fact is the fact that interior closing doors can cause combustion appliances to experience <b>backdrafting</b> of their combustion by products into the home.

40|$|In {{the present}} work, organic aerogels {{are used as}} a new binding {{material}} for mould and core production in foundry application. The work is motivated by the problems occurring during the mould and core removal in aluminium casting. In contrary to steel and iron casting the low casting temperatures lead to low temperatures in the mold and core material and therefore the bonding efficiency remains on a high level. Therefore a complete core removal is only possible by an increased mechanical effort. Thin wall parts of the casting are as much problematic as <b>backdrafts</b> and cavities. With AeroSands, the combination of aerogels and sands, a novel molding material for core and mold production are presented. In the present dissertation preparation methods of organic aerogels and AeroSands are presented. AeroSands are prepared by mixing conventionally foundry sands {{with a certain amount}} of aerogel sol, consisting of resorcinol, formaldehyde, sodium carbonate and water. After gelling and drying, AeroSands prepared in that way are characterized as a mold and core material. The sand types are varied (corundum, silicon carbide, quartz, mullit-hollow spheres), their grain sizes and the amount of aerogel solution in the range of 4 - 24 %. The AeroSands are characterized according to their mechanical properties,bending strength, compression strength, elastic modulus, permeability and core strength, and according to their thermophysical properties, thermal conductivity and specific heat. AeroSands made by organic aerogels have two characteristics which are quite interesting for foundry applications. The polymeric aerogel decomposes totally at temperatures above 350 Â°C, i. e. far below the solidus temperature of common aluminium foundry alloys. The thermal decomposition was analysed at different temperatures. The second characteristic makes the polymeric aerogels even interesting for thin walled steel castings: The thermal conductivity depends on the sand type, its grain size and the amount of aerogel. Optimizing these three parameters the effective thermal conductivity can adjusted such that thin walled steel casting can be realized. The basic research and development of this new binding material is completed by casting experiments with a conventional aluminium alloy. They showed that this new binding material leads to castings with a high surface quality and that cores can be removed without any mechanical effort by only thermal disintegration...|$|R

40|$|In this report, we {{identify}} and describe 24 practical diagnostics that are ready now to evaluate residential commissioning metrics, {{and that we}} expect {{to include in the}} commissioning guide. Our discussion in the main body of this report is limited to existing diagnostics in areas of particular concern with significant interactions: envelope and HVAC systems. These areas include insulation quality, windows, airtightness, envelope moisture, fan and duct system airflows, duct leakage, cooling equipment charge, and combustion appliance <b>backdrafting</b> with spillage. Appendix C describes the 83 other diagnostics that we have examined {{in the course of this}} project, but that are not ready or are inappropriate for residential commissioning. Combined with Appendix B, Table 1 in the main body of the report summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of all 107 diagnostics. We first describe what residential commissioning is, its characteristic elements, and how one might structure its process. Our intent in this discussion is to formulate and clarify these issues, but is largely preliminary because such a practice does not yet exist. Subsequent sections of the report describe metrics one can use in residential commissioning, along with the consolidated set of 24 practical diagnostics that the building industry can use now to evaluate them. Where possible, we also discuss the accuracy and usability of diagnostics, based on recent laboratory work and field studies by LBNL staff and others in more than 100 houses. These studies concentrate on evaluating diagnostics in the following four areas: the DeltaQ duct leakage test, air-handler airflow tests, supply and return grille airflow tests, and refrigerant charge tests. Appendix A describes those efforts in detail. In addition, where possible, {{we identify}} the costs to purchase diagnostic equipment and the amount of time required to conduct the diagnostics. Table 1 summarizes these data. Individual equipment costs for the 24 practical diagnostics range from a few hundred dollars to many thousands of dollars. The higher costs are associated with infrared thermography and state-of-the-art automated diagnostic systems.

40|$|Houses do {{not perform}} optimally {{or even as}} many codes and {{forecasts}} predict. For example, Walker et al. (1998 a) found large variations in thermal distribution system efficiency, {{as much as a}} factor of two even between side-by-side houses with the same system design and installation crew. This and other studies (e. g., Jump et al. 1996) indicate that duct leakage testing and sealing can readily achieve a 25 to 30 % reduction in installed cooling capacity and energy consumption. As another example, consider that the building industry has recognized for at least 20 years the substantial impact that envelope airtightness has on thermal loads, energy use, comfort, and indoor air quality. However, Walker et al. (1998 a) found 50 % variances in airtightness for houses with the same design and construction crews, within the same subdivision. A substantial reason for these problems is that few houses are now built or retrofitted using formal design procedures, most are field assembled from a large number of components, and there is no consistent process to identify problems or to correct them. Solving the problems requires field performance evaluations of houses using appropriate and agreed upon procedures. Many procedural elements already exist in a fragmented environment; some are ready now to be integrated into a new process called residential commissioning (Wray et al. 2000). For example, California's Title 24 energy code already provides some commissioning elements for evaluating the energy performance of new houses. A house consists of components and systems that need to be commissioned, such as building envelopes, air distribution systems, cooling equipment, heat pumps, combustion appliances, controls, and other electrical appliances. For simplicity and practicality, these components and systems are usually evaluated individually, but we need to bear in mind that many of them interact. Therefore, commissioning must not only identify the energy and non-energy benefits associated with improving the performance of a component, it must also indicate how individual components interact in the complete building system. For this paper, we limit our discussion to diagnostics in areas of particular concern with significant interactions: envelope and HVAC systems. These areas include insulation quality, windows, airtightness, envelope moisture, fan and duct system airflows, duct leakage, cooling equipment charge, and combustion appliance <b>backdrafting</b> with spillage. The remainder of this paper first describes what residential commissioning is, its characteristic elements, and how one might structure its process. Subsequent sections describe a consolidated set of practical diagnostics that the building industry can use now. Where possible, we also discuss the accuracy and usability of these diagnostics, based on recent laboratory work and field studies. We conclude by describing areas in need of research and development, such as practical field diagnostics for envelope thermal conductance and combustion safety. There are several potential benefits for builders, consumers, code officials, utilities, and energy planners of commissioning houses using a consistent set of validated methods. Builders and/or commissioning agents will be able to optimize system performance and reduce consumer costs associated with building energy use. Consumers {{will be more likely to}} get what they paid for and builders can show they delivered what was expected. Code officials will be better able to enforce existing and future energy codes. As energy reduction measures are more effectively incorporated into the housing stock, utilities and energy planners will benefit through greater confidence in predicting demand and greater assurance that demand reductions will actually occur. Performance improvements will also reduce emissions from electricity generating plants and residential combustion equipment. Research to characterize these benefits is underway...|$|R
