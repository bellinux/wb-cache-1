5|$|The clear-cutting {{of forests}} in the 19th century {{adversely}} affected {{the ecology of the}} Larrys Creek watershed and its water quality. Polluting industries on the creek and its tributaries during that period included coal and iron mines and tanneries. As of 2006, water quality in Larrys Creek is quite good, although two small unnamed tributaries of Roaring Run do receive acid mine drainage from an abandoned coal mine. Agricultural runoff is another source of pollution. Effluent limits for Larrys Creek in Mifflin Township for the 5-day test for carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand (CBOD5) are 25mg/L, while fecal coliform <b>bacteria</b> <b>count</b> limits are 200 per 100mL in May through September, and 2000 per 100mL in October through April.|$|E

25|$|The {{organization}} Riverkeeper collects {{samples in}} three Pocantico River tributaries. The river downstream of Pocantico Lake is a habitat for brown trout. The river is stocked each spring; 540 brown trout were stocked in 2013, and 630 were anticipated {{to be stocked}} in the river in 2014. After a bacteria test completed on October 4, 2014, the river {{was found to have}} an Enterococcus <b>bacteria</b> <b>count</b> of greater than 2420, indicating high amounts of fecal matter in the water. Other tests of the river quality {{at the mouth of the}} river in Sleepy Hollow also contain high levels of Enterococcus bacteria. In fact, the high bacteria counts throughout the river were taken both after wet and dry weather. Dry weather tends to result in lower bacteria counts because less flooding results in less overflow from sewage treatment plants. The high levels of bacteria in the river resulted in beach advisories for the entire river. In 2014, $9.9 million was put aside to repair the Tarrytown sewage treatment plant in order to improve water quality in the region.|$|E
40|$|Most QTL mapping methods {{assume that}} phenotypes follow a normal distribution, but many phenotypes of {{interest}} are not normally distributed, e. g. <b>bacteria</b> <b>counts</b> (or colony-forming units, CFU). Such data are extremely skewed {{to the right}} and can present a high amount of zero values, which are ties from a statistical point of view. Our objective is therefore to assess the efficiency of four QTL mapping methods applied to bacteria counts: (1) least-squares (LS) analysis, (2) maximum-likelihood (ML) analysis, (3) non-parametric (NP) mapping and (4) nested ANOVA (AN). A transformation based on quantiles is used to mimic observed distributions of <b>bacteria</b> <b>counts.</b> Single positions (1 marker, 1 QTL) as well as chromosome scans (11 markers, 1 QTL) are simulated. When compared with the analysis of a normally distributed phenotype, the analysis of raw <b>bacteria</b> <b>counts</b> leads to a strong decrease in power for parametric methods, but no decrease is observed for NP. However, when a mathematical transformation (MT) is applied to <b>bacteria</b> <b>counts</b> prior to analysis, parametric methods have the same power as NP. Furthermore, parametric methods, when coupled with MT, outperform NP when <b>bacteria</b> <b>counts</b> have a very high proportion of zeros (70. 8 %). Our results show that the loss of power is mainly explained by the asymmetry of the phenotypic distribution, for parametric methods, and by the existence of ties, for the non-parametric method. Therefore, mapping of QTL for bacterial diseases, as well as for other diseases assessed by a counting process, should focus on the occurrence of ties in phenotypes before choosing the appropriate QTL mapping method...|$|R

40|$|AbstractRecirculating {{aquaculture}} {{systems may}} require an internal disinfection process to control population growth of pathogens and heterotrophic bacteria. Ozonation and ultraviolet (UV) irradiation are two technologies {{that have been}} used to treat relatively large aquaculture flows, including flows within freshwater systems that recirculate water. The objective {{of the present study was}} to evaluate the effectiveness of ozone application alone or ozone application followed by UV irradiation to reduce abundance of heterotrophic and total coliform bacteria in a water reuse system. Results indicate that when only ozone was applied at dosages – defined by the product of the ozone concentration times the mean hydraulic residence time (Ct) – that ranged from 0. 10 to 3. 65 minmg/L, the total heterotrophic <b>bacteria</b> <b>counts</b> and total coliform <b>bacteria</b> <b>counts</b> in the water exiting the contact basin were reduced to, respectively, 3 – 12 cfu/mL (1. 1 – 1. 6 LOG 10 reduction) and 2 – 18 cfu/ 100 mL (1. 9 – 3. 1 LOG 10 reduction). Bacteria inactivation appeared to be just as effective at the lowest ozone ct dosage (i. e., 0. 1 mg/L ozone after a 1 min contact time) as at the highest ozone ct dosage (i. e., 0. 2 mg/L ozone after a 16. 6 min contact time). As with our previous research on UV inactivation of bacteria, we hypothesize that the recirculating system provided a selection process that favors bacteria that embed within particulate matter or that form bacterial aggregates that provides shielding from oxidation. However, when ozonation was followed by UV irradiation, the total heterotrophic <b>bacteria</b> <b>counts</b> and total coliform <b>bacteria</b> <b>counts</b> in the water exiting the UV irradiation unit were reduced to, respectively, 0 – 4 cfu/mL (1. 6 – 2. 7 LOG 10 reduction) and 0 – 3 cfu/ 100 mL (2. 5 – 4. 3 LOG 10 reduction). Thus, combining ozone dosages of only 0. 1 – 0. 2 minmg/L with a UV irradiation dosage of approximately 50 mJ/cm 2 would consistently reduce <b>bacteria</b> <b>counts</b> to near zero. These findings were orders of magnitude lower than the <b>bacteria</b> <b>counts</b> measured in the system when it was operated without disinfection or with UV irradiation alone. These findings indicate that combining ozonation and UV irradiation can effectively disinfect recirculating water before it returns to the fish culture tank(s) ...|$|R

50|$|Bacteria {{have been}} {{referred}} to {{as one of the most}} obstinate in this list to control. Techniques that help in minimizing bacterial colony growth within UPW streams include occasional chemical or steam sanitization (which is common in the pharmaceutical industry), ultrafiltration (found in some pharmaceutical, but mostly semiconductor industries), ozonation and optimization of piping system designs that promote the use of Reynolds Number criteria for minimum flow along with minimization of dead legs. In modern advanced UPW systems positive (higher than zero) <b>bacteria</b> <b>counts</b> are typically observed in the newly constructed facilities. This issue is effectively addressed by sanitization using ozone or hydrogen peroxide. With proper design of the polishing and distribution system no positive <b>bacteria</b> <b>counts</b> are typically detected throughout the life cycle of the UPW system.|$|R

50|$|Although {{pathogens}} are {{the primary}} focus of attention, the principal monitoring effort is almost always directed at much more common indicator species such as Escherichia coli, supplemented by overall coliform <b>bacteria</b> <b>counts.</b> The rationale behind this monitoring strategy is that most human pathogens originate from other humans via the sewage stream. Many sewage treatment plants have no sterilisation final stage and therefore discharge an effluent which, although having a clean appearance, still contains many millions of bacteria per litre, the majority of which are relatively harmless coliform <b>bacteria.</b> <b>Counting</b> the number of harmless (or less harmful) sewage bacteria allows a judgement to be made about the probability of significant numbers of pathogenic bacteria or viruses being present. Where E. coli or coliform levels exceed pre-set trigger values, more intensive monitoring including specific monitoring for pathogenic species is then initiated.|$|R

5000|$|During {{the months}} of July and August 1897, when infant deaths were at their highest, Goler {{arranged}} for an Infants' Milk Depot {{to be set up}} in a storefront in Rochester, with two nurses to pasteurize and cool milk, then to sell it at cost to mothers of small children. A pamphlet entitled [...] "How to Take Care of Babies" [...] was published in four languages and distributed for free. Infant mortality was reduced by 50 percent, and the city established four depots the following summer. In 1900, Goler set about to increase the cleanliness of raw milk, with strict hygienic standards at a particular dairy farm. Infant mortality declined further, and the standards were expanded to cover all dairy farms. Farmers were educated on hygiene, and inspection was increased. While the <b>bacteria</b> <b>count</b> in unsanitary stations was as high as 100,000 per cubic centimeter, the average for Rochester by 1907 was 3,853.
