It <b>began</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> caliph Uthman ibn Affan was assassinated in 656 and continued through the four-year reign of Ali.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, there were rumours about {{surviving}} mammoths in Alaska. In October 1899, Henry Tukeman detailed his {{killing of a}} mammoth in Alaska and his subsequent donation of the specimen to the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C.. The museum denied the story. Bengt Sjögren believed that the myth <b>began</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> American biologist Charles Haskins Townsend travelled in Alaska, saw Eskimos trading mammoth tusks, asked if there were still living mammoths in Alaska, and provided them with a drawing of the animal.|$|E
5|$|Irwin's {{major league}} career <b>began</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> Ruby Legs {{moved into the}} National League (NL) in 1880. He {{led the league in}} assists in his rookie season, and {{remained}} with the team through 1882, when it folded due to poor attendance. Irwin spent three seasons with the Providence Grays, and was captain and starting shortstop of the 1884 Providence team that became world champions. The 1884 Grays featured star pitchers Charles Radbourn and Charlie Sweeney; the two hurlers did not get along well, and Sweeney left the team {{in the middle of the}} season. The club folded after a fourth-place finish in 1885.|$|E

The dispute was initially tried at the Guildhall in London on 6March 1783, with the Lord Chief Justice, the Earl of Mansfield, overseeing the trial before a jury. Mansfield was previously the judge in Somersett's Case in 1772, which concerned the legality of keeping slaves in Britain. He had ruled that slavery had never been established by statute in Britain and was not supported by common law.|$|E

5|$|Pod is {{the debut}} album by the American {{alternative}} rock band the Breeders, released on 4AD in May 1990. The group <b>began</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> Pixies' Kim Deal and Throwing Muses' Tanya Donelly became friends in 1988 and decided {{they would like}} to create music together. Abandoning their initial idea of focusing on dance music, they recorded a country-influenced demo with musicians including violinist Carrie Bradley and bassist Ray Holiday in 1989. When 4AD cofounder Ivo Watts-Russell heard the demo, he offered them money to re-record the songs for an album release.|$|E
5|$|Since 2009, Aberdeen {{has been}} {{examining}} {{a move to}} a new stadium. Plans for a new stadium <b>began</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> club indicated that further development of Pittodrie Stadium was not possible due to the age of the ground and the restrictions from surrounding land. Aberdeen City Council approved an initial project in May 2009, to be situated near Loirston Loch in the south of the city, subject to planning permission. In August 2010, a planning application for the new stadium was submitted to the council, which was approved the following February.|$|E

Due to a cheating scandal that involved defending champion Harvard, Princeton was the preseason favorite.|$|E

5|$|The battle <b>began</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> {{large and}} {{unwieldy}} CSS Virginia steamed into Hampton Roads {{on the morning}} of March 8, 1862. Captain Buchanan intended to attack as soon as possible. Virginia was accompanied from her moorings on the Elizabeth River by Raleigh and Beaufort, and was joined at Hampton Roads by the James River Squadron, Patrick Henry, Jamestown, and Teaser. When they were passing the Union batteries at Newport News, Patrick Henry was temporarily disabled by a shot in her boiler that killed four of her crew. After repairs, she returned and rejoined the others.|$|E

5|$|The {{drift of}} the Antarctic {{exploration}} vessel SY Aurora was an ordeal which lasted 312days, during the Ross Sea chapter of Sir Ernest Shackleton's Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition, 1914–17. It <b>began</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> ship broke loose from its anchorage in McMurdo Sound in May 1915, during a gale. Caught in heavy pack ice {{and unable to}} manoeuvre, Aurora, with eighteen men aboard, was carried into the open waters of the Ross Sea and Southern Ocean, leaving ten men stranded ashore with meagre provisions.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea for}} a tunnel under Loveland Pass existed {{at least since the}} 1940s. Serious {{discussion}} <b>began</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> state of Colorado lobbied for the Interstate Highway System to route a transcontinental highway across Colorado. After a round of negotiations with Utah officials, it was decided the best option was to follow the U.S. Route 6 corridor. Engineers recommended to tunnel under the pass, rather than attempt to build a route across it that conformed to Interstate Highway standards.|$|E
5|$|Confusion in naming <b>began</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> {{tree was}} {{described}} by all three men with three different names. In Paris, Linnaeus gave the plant the name Rhus succedanea, while it was known commonly as grand vernis du Japon. In London the specimens were named by Miller as Toxicodendron altissima and in Busbridge it was dubbed in the old classification system as Rhus Sinese foliis alatis. There are extant records from the 1750s of disputes over the proper name between Philip Miller and John Ellis, curator of Webb's garden in Busbridge. Rather than the issue being resolved, more names soon appeared for the plant: Jakob Friedrich Ehrhart observed a specimen in Utrecht in 1782 and named it Rhus cacodendron.|$|E

5|$|Dawson Creek is a {{regional}} node for air, rail, and bus services. The Dawson Creek Airport, which services commercial flights by Central Mountain Air, {{was built in}} 1963; its 1,524m (5,000ft) runway was paved in 1966. There are larger airports in Fort St. John and Grande Prairie that maintain more comprehensive flight schedules. Passenger rail service was available in Dawson Creek between 1931 and 1974. Service <b>began</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> Northern Alberta Railways (NAR) built its northwest terminus in the town and was extended in 1958 to Vancouver with a rail line through the Rocky Mountains. Passenger rail service ended as commodity shipments of grains, oil and gas by-products, and forestry products became {{more important in the}} resource-based economy. Greyhound Lines maintains a bus station in Dawson Creek which connects the city to Vancouver, Edmonton (via Grande Prairie), and Whitehorse (via Fort Nelson).|$|E
5|$|On 25 June 1950 the Korean War <b>began</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> North Korean People's Army {{invaded the}} Republic of Korea (ROK) with 90,000 well-trained and {{equipped}} troops who easily overran the {{smaller and more}} poorly equipped Republic of Korea Army. In response, the United States (U.S.) and United Nations (UN) began an intervention campaign to prevent South Korea from collapsing. The U.S. troops engaged the North Koreans first at the Battle of Osan where they were badly defeated on 5 July by the better-trained North Koreans. From there, the U.S. and UN suffered {{a steady stream of}} defeats that pushed them back to the Pusan Perimeter by August. At the same time, North Korean agents began to infiltrate behind UN lines and attack military targets and cities.|$|E
5|$|Rome's last gasp <b>began</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> Visigoths revolted around 395 AD. Led by Alaric I, they {{attempted}} to seize Constantinople, but were rebuffed and instead plundered much of Thrace in northern Greece. In 402 AD they besieged Mediolanum, the capital of Roman Emperor Honorius, defended by Roman Gothic troops. The arrival of the Roman Stilicho and his army forced Alaric to lift his siege and move his army towards Hasta (modern Asti) in western Italy, where Stilicho attacked it at the Battle of Pollentia, capturing Alaric's camp. Stilicho offered to return the prisoners {{in exchange for the}} Visigoths returning to Illyricum but upon arriving at Verona, Alaric halted his retreat. Stilicho again attacked at the Battle of Verona and again defeated Alaric, forcing him to withdraw from Italy.|$|E
