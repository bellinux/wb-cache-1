The DX tiles can have their sticky end sequences chosen so that they act as Wang tiles, allowing them to perform computation. A DX array whose assembly encodes an XOR operation has been demonstrated; this allows the DNA array to implement a cellular automaton that generates a fractal known as the Sierpinski gasket. [...] The third image at right shows this type of array. Another system has the function of a <b>binary</b> <b>counter,</b> displaying a representation of increasing binary numbers as it grows.

One such application includes the design of a digital correlator for very long baseline interferometry (VLBI).

40|$|Several {{recently}} proposed techniques including CPR (Checkpoint Processing and Recovery) and NoSQ (No Store Queue) rely on reference counting {{to manage}} physical registers.

This paper fills this gap by describing potential register reference counting schemes for NoSQ, CPR, and a hypothetical NoSQ/CPR hybrid. Although previously {{described in terms}} of <b>binary</b> <b>counters,</b> we find that reference counts are actually more naturally represented as matrices.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to explore the applicability of clock gating techniques to <b>binary</b> <b>counters</b> in order to reduce the power consumption as well as the switching noise generation. A measurement methodology to establish right comparisons between different implementations of gateclocked counters is presented. Basically two ways of applying clock gating are considered: clock gating on independent bits and clock gating on groups of bits. The right selection of bits where clock gating must be applied and the suited composition of groups of bits is essential when applying this technique. We have found groupment of bits is the best option when applying clock gating to reduce power consumption and specially to reduce noise generation.

50|$|The {{disadvantage}} of ring counters {{is that they}} are lower density codes. A <b>binary</b> <b>counter</b> can represent 2^N states, where N is the number of bits in the code, whereas an Overbeck counter can represent only N states and a Johnson counter can represent only 2N states. This may be an important consideration in hardware implementations where registers are more expensive than combinational logic.|$|E
50|$|A {{series of}} {{peripheral}} chip were introduced by 1978. The MC6840 programmable counter had three 16-bit <b>binary</b> <b>counters</b> {{that could be}} used for frequency measurement, event counting, or interval measurement. The MC6844 Direct Memory Access Controller could transfer data from an I/O controller to RAM without loading down the MC6800 microprocessor. The MC6845 CRT Controller provided the control logic for a character based computer terminal. The 6845 had support for a light pen, an alternative to a computer mouse. This was a very popular chip and was even used in the original IBM PC Monochrome Display Adapter with the Intel 8088 16-bit microprocessor in 1981, and in the follow-up IBM Color Graphics Adapter for the original PC and successors; the IBM Enhanced Graphics Adapter card contained custom IBM chips that emulated the Motorola 6845, with minor differences.|$|R

5000|$|As discussed, more {{transition}} {{results in}} more glitches and hence more power dissipation. To minimize glitch occurrence, switching activity should be minimized. For example, {{in the design}} of 4 bit counter if gray code is used instead of binary code then switching activity is reduced by a great extent. As counting from 0000 to 0101, a usual <b>binary</b> <b>counter</b> takes 5 transitions whereas gray code implemented counter takes only 2 transitions and hence switching activity is reduced.|$|E
50|$|High {{clock rates}} impose {{additional}} design {{constraints on the}} counter: if the clock period is short, {{it is difficult to}} update the count. Binary counters, for example, need a fast carry architecture because they essentially add one to the previous counter value. A solution is using a hybrid counter architecture. A Johnson counter, for example, is a fast non-binary counter. It can be used to count very quickly the low order count; a more conventional <b>binary</b> <b>counter</b> can be used to accumulate the high order count. The fast counter is sometime called a prescaler.|$|E
50|$|The {{only problem}} is that we don't have room in log space for a <b>binary</b> <b>counter</b> that goes up to 2n. To get around this we replace it with a {{randomized}} counter, which simply flips n coins and stops and rejects if they all land on heads. Since this event has probability 2−n, we expect to take 2n steps on average before stopping. It only needs to keep a running total of the number of heads in a row it sees, which it can count in log space.|$|E

40|$|An analog voltage {{approximately}} linearly {{proportional to}} a desired offset from the present null position of a moving mirror in an interferometer {{is applied to the}} mirror moving means. As the mirror moves to the next null position, as determined by the analog voltage, the fringes of a laser reference interference pattern are detected. At the occurrence of each fringe the analog voltage is reduced proportionally so that when the next null position is reached, this driving analog is effectively zero. A <b>binary</b> up/down <b>counter,</b> by its internal count, causes a digital/analog converter to supply the analog voltage to the mirror moving means. Fringe detection and direction of movement logic cause the <b>binary</b> up/down <b>counter</b> to be decremented from its offset count as the mirror is moved to the new null position. Undesirable movement of the mirror due to vibration or other sources causes a correcting drive signal to be applied to the mirror moving means that is proportional to the distance of movement...|$|R

Examples of self-assembly research topics include self-assembled DNA nanostructures such as Sierpinski triangles or arbitrary nanoshapes obtained using the DNA origami technique, and DNA nanomachines such as DNA-based circuits (<b>binary</b> <b>counter,</b> bit-wise cumulative XOR), ribozymes for logic operations, molecular switches (DNA tweezers), and autonomous molecular motors (DNA walkers).|$|E
