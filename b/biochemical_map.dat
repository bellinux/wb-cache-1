40|$|A goal {{of systems}} biology {{is to build}} a {{concrete}} biochemical network map, which provides an important instruction to trace the pathways of interest or to understand the mechanism of a biological system. In the postgenomic era, not only the concrete biochemical maps, but also postgenomic maps (mRNA coexpression and protein-protein interaction networks) have been extensively produced. In the <b>biochemical</b> <b>map,</b> the individual reactions are reliable, but the number of the reactions is limited, because molecular biology requires extensive experiments to verify them. By contrast, postgenomic data provide much information regarding interactions, but are coarse-grained. To expand the biochemical network, an intuitional approach, which superposes postgenomic data on the map one by one, has been carried out, but it is not effective when a large amount of the coarse-grained data is handled. In order to effectively integrate such postgenomic interactions into a <b>biochemical</b> <b>map,</b> a statistical approach would be suitable rather than intuition. In this article, we proposed a novel statistical approach that integrates postgenomic interaction networks into the biochemical network, predicting novel pathways. A statistical correlation for such different types of networks identifies functional modules; subsequently the superposition of the different networks on the functional modules predicts inter-modular relations, which are the key pathways to construct a large-scale biochemical network...|$|E

We developed a new and computationally feasible notation that enables drawing a wide resolution map from the domain-level reactions to phenomenological events and implemented it as the extended GUI network constructor of CADLIVE (Computer-Aided Design of LIVing systEms). The new notation presents ‘Domain expansion’ for proteins and RNAs, ‘Virtual reaction and nodes’ {{that are responsible for}} illustrating domain-based interaction and ‘InnerLink’ that links real complex nodes to virtual nodes to illustrate the exact components of the real complex. A modular box is also presented that packs related reactions as a module or a subnetwork, which gives CADLIVE a capability to draw <b>biochemical</b> <b>maps</b> in a hierarchical modular architecture. Furthermore, we developed a pathway search module for virtual knockout mutants as a built-in application of CADLIVE.

40|$|The {{phosphotransferase}} system (PTS) is {{the sugar}} transportation machinery that is widely distributed in prokaryotes and {{is critical for}} enhanced production of useful metabolites. To increase the glucose uptake rate, we propose a rational strategy for designing the molecular architecture of the Escherichia coli glucose PTS by using a computer-aided design (CAD) system and verified the simulated results with biological experiments. CAD supports construction of a <b>biochemical</b> <b>map,</b> mathematical modeling, simulation, and system analysis. Assuming that the PTS aims at controlling the glucose uptake rate, the PTS was decomposed into hierarchical modules, functional and flux modules, {{and the effect of}} changes in gene expression on the glucose uptake rate was simulated to make a rational strategy of how the gene regulatory network is engineered. Such design and analysis predicted that the mlc knockout mutant with ptsI gene overexpression would greatly increase the specific glucose uptake rate.

A comparison of homologous (by linkage criteria) chromosomes by using conventionally extended and high-resolution G-banding of human and feline chromosomes is presented. Four criteria for establishing probable cytogenetic homologies of chromosomal regions were invoked: (i) map placement of homologous genes to the same chromosomes; (ii) cytological correlation of G-banding pattern; (iii) placement of homologous genes, by regional gene mapping, {{in the region of}} cytological homology; and (iv) a requirement that the putative region of homology be ancestral and evolutionarily conserved within their respective orders. Five subchromosomal regions (homologous to human chromosome 1 p, 2 p, 2 q, 12, and X) were found to be conserved and homologous by all the stated criteria. The conserved regions constitute nearly 20 % by length of the human chromosomal genome.

Translocase comprises a membrane "pore" and the peripheral ATPase SecA. Where preproteins bind to SecA and how they activate translocation ATPase remains elusive. To address this central question we have purified to homogeneity the mature and preprotein parts of an exported protein (pCH 5 EE). pCH 5 EE satisfies a minimal size required for protein translocation and its membrane insertion is SecA-dependent. Purified pCH 5 EE and CH 5 EE can form physical complexes with SecA and can functionally suppress the elevated ATPase of a constitutively activated mutant.

40|$|Recent {{reports have}} {{increased}} {{our knowledge of}} the consecutive steps during 60 S ribosome biogenesis substantially, but 40 S subunit formation is less well understood. Here, we investigate the maturation of nucleolar 90 S pre-ribosomes into cytoplasmic 40 S pre-ribosomes. During the transition from 90 S to 40 S particles, the majority of non-ribosomal proteins (∼ 30 species) dissociate, and significantly fewer factors associate with 40 S pre-ribosomes. Notably, some of these components are part of both early 90 S and intermediate 40 S pre-particles in the nucleolus (e. g. Enp 1 p, Dim 1 p and Rrp 12 p), whereas others (e. g. Rio 2 p and Nob 1 p) are found mainly on late cytoplasmic pre- 40 S subunits. Finally, temperature-sensitive mutants mapping either in earlier (enp 1 - 1) or later (rio 2 - 1) components exhibit defects in the formation and nuclear export of pre- 40 S subunits. Our data provide an initial <b>biochemical</b> <b>map</b> of the pre- 40 S ribosomal subunit on its path from the nucleolus to the cytoplasm.

40|$|We have {{developed}} the CADLIVE (Computer-Aided Design of LIVing systEms) Simulator that provided a rule-based automatic way to convert biochemical network maps into dynamic models, which enables simulating their dynamics without going {{through all of the}} reactions down to the details of exact kinetic parameters. The simulator supports the biochemical reaction maps that are generated by the previously developed GUI editor. Notice that the part of the GUI editor had been previously published, but, as yet, not the simulator. To directly link biochemical network maps to dynamic simulation, we have created the strategy of three layers and two stages with the efficient conversion rules in an XML representation. This strategy divides a molecular network into three layers, i. e., gene, protein, and metabolic layers, and partitions the conversion process into two stages. Once a <b>biochemical</b> <b>map</b> is provided, CADLIVE automatically builds a mathematical model, thereby facilitating one to simulate and analyze it. In order to demonstrate the feasibility of CADLIVE, we analyzed the Escherichia coli nitrogen-assimilation system (64 equations with 64 variables) that consists of multiple and complicated negative and positive feedback loops. CADLIVE predicted that the glnK gene is responsible for hysteresis or reversibility of nitrogen-related (Ntr) gene expression with respect to the ammonia concentration, supporting the experimental observation of the runaway expression of the Ntr genes...|$|E
40|$|The fatigue after {{exercise}} {{has been}} objective of continuous study, however Its {{causes and effects}} still not properly elucidated, although it is already known that their causes can be peripheral (muscular), neuromuscular (neuromuscular junction) and central (neurological). In this work we revised possible causes and molecular mechanisms of the fatigue, at central level, metabolic and muscular. There is evidence of the participation of tryptophan, hyperammonemia and cytocines concentration in the central fatigue, while focus will be given in the participation of ATPases from skeletal muscle in the peripheral fatigue, being involved the main three: Na+-K+-ATPase, Ca 2 +-ATPase and myosin II. Besides, several metabolic factors as the substract depletion and the accumulation of their by-products will be approached in this revision. The data here gathered will show indications of several paths related {{with the process of}} fatigue, and to point ways for the prevention of this process, although it is necessary caution in the observation and analyzing of data to postulate the <b>biochemical</b> <b>map</b> of the fatigue. We can conclude that, although we are able to identify the main effects of the fatigue in several isolated proteins, the entire process should be the result of an extensive biochemical cascade that acts in the main proteins related with the muscular contraction, as well as important components of the central nervous system...|$|E

Three experimental strategies were used: (1) the chronic cannulation model {{to assess the}} effects of stress, lateral hypothalamic stimulation, monosodium glutamate, and pharmacologic agents on growth hormone dynamics, (2) <b>biochemical</b> <b>mapping</b> of central somatostatinergic pathways involved in growth hormone regulation, and (3) an in vitro perifusion system to study somatostatin release. It is shown that exictatory and inhibitory neural inputs must be intact to maintain normal rhythmic growth hormone secretion. Growth hormone rises are generated by hypothalamic neurons that liberate a growth hormone releasing factor. These neurons are activated by adrenergic (and probably noradrenergic) inputs. The periventricular and amygdalofugal somatostatinergic systems control ebbs in plasma growth hormone and stress- or lateral hypothalamic stimulation-induced growth hormone suppression.

40|$|Heterochromatin in S. pombe is {{associated}} with gene silencing at telomeres, the mating locus and centromeres. The compact heterochromatin structure raises the question how it unpacks and reforms during DNA replication. We show that the essential DNA replication factor Cdc 18 (CDC 6) associates with heterochromatin protein 1 (Swi 6) in vivo and in vitro. <b>Biochemical</b> <b>mapping</b> and mutational analysis of the association domains show that the N-terminus of Cdc 18 interacts with the chromoshadow domain of Swi 6. Mutations in Swi 6 that disrupt this interaction disrupt silencing and delay replication in the centromere. A mutation cdc 18 -I 43 A that reduces Cdc 18 association with Swi 6 has no silencing defect at the centromere, but changes Swi 6 distribution and accelerates the timing of centromere replication.

This study provides a spatial map of the mechanical and biochemical properties of human auricular cartilage, thus establishing a benchmark for the evaluation of functional competency in AUR cartilage TE. Stress-relaxation indentation (instantaneous modulus, Ein; maximum stress, σmax; equilibrium modulus, Eeq; relaxation half-life time, t 1 / 2; thickness, h) and biochemical parameters (content of DNA; sulfated-glycosaminoglycan, sGAG; hydroxyproline, HYP; elastin, ELN) of fresh human AUR cartilage were evaluated. Samples were categorized into age groups and according to their harvesting region in the human auricle (for AUR cartilage only). AUR cartilage displayed significantly lower Ein, σmax, Eeq, sGAG content; and significantly higher t 1 / 2, and DNA content than NAS cartilage. Large amounts of ELN were measured in AUR cartilage (> 15 % ELN content per sample wet mass). No effect of gender was observed for either auricular or nasoseptal samples. For auricular samples, significant differences between age groups for h, sGAG and HYP, and significant regional variations for Ein, σmax, Eeq, t 1 / 2, h, DNA and sGAG were measured. However, only low correlations between mechanical and biochemical parameters were seen (R< 0. 44). In conclusion, this study established the first comprehensive mechanical and <b>biochemical</b> <b>map</b> of human auricular cartilage. Regional variations in mechanical and biochemical properties were demonstrated in the auricle.

40|$|Nucleocytoplasmic transport, the {{regulated}} trafficking of macromolecules {{in and out}} of the nucleus, occurs primarily through nuclear pore complexes (NPCs). NPCs are massive macromolecular machines embedded in the nuclear envelope which generate ~ 40 nanometer transport channels to facilitate transport. Because of its size and complexity (~ 1000 subunits, ~ 120 MDa), the structure of the NPC has remained poorly understood. This thesis presents a bottom-up approach to understanding the structure and function of the NPC through reconstitution of the proteins and structural and biochemical studies. The first three chapters present work towards determining the composite structure of the symmetric core of the NPC. X-ray crystal structures are described for many of the components of the symmetric core. This includes a heterohexameric coat nucleoporin complex containing Nup 120, Nup 85, Nup 145 C, Sec 13, Seh 1, and Nup 84, revealing how these proteins assemble into one of the main subcomplexes in the NPC. Reconstitution of the symmetric core components and analysis of the protein-protein interaction between the components provides a detailed <b>biochemical</b> <b>map</b> for the protein interaction network in the NPC. X-ray crystal structures of overlapping fragments facilitate the generation of accurate atomic model for full-length proteins. An iterative, sequential docking approach is developed to dock these models into a cryoelectron tomographic reconstruction of the human NPC, yielding a composite model for the structure of the symmetric core of the NPC. In the next two chapters, this analysis is extended to the cytoplasmic-specific decorations of the NPC. The structure of the C-terminal domain of Nup 358 is reported and its catalytic activity is described. Lastly, reconstitution of human DDX 19 activation by the NPC reveals mechanistic insight into how the NPC directly regulates the last step of mRNA export...|$|E

40|$|The ATR (ATM and Rad 3 -related) kinase is {{essential}} to maintain genomic integrity. ATR is recruited to DNA lesions in part through its association with ATR-interacting protein (ATRIP), which in turn interacts with the single-stranded DNA binding protein RPA (replication protein A). In this study, a conserved checkpoint protein recruitment domain (CRD) in ATRIP orthologs was identified by <b>biochemical</b> <b>mapping</b> of the RPA binding site in combination with nuclear magnetic resonance, mutagenesis, and computational modeling. Mutations in the CRD of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae ATRIP ortholog Ddc 2 disrupt the Ddc 2 -RPA interaction, prevent proper localization of Ddc 2 to DNA breaks, sensitize yeast to DNA-damaging agents, and partially compromise checkpoint signaling. These data demonstrate that the CRD is critical for localization and optimal DNA damage responses. However, the stimulation of ATR kinase activity by binding of topoisomerase binding protein 1 (TopBP 1) to ATRIP-ATR can occur independently of the interaction of ATRIP with RPA.

40|$|Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging (MRSI) is a {{functional}} MRI technique allowing non-invasive <b>biochemical</b> <b>mapping</b> of the brain. MRSI is advantageous for characterising many neurological conditions; however, its clinical application {{is limited by}} lengthy scan time and low spatial resolution, which are intrinsically linked. This research investigated the potential of Compressed Sensing (CS) to speed-up MRSI or enhance spatial resolution. CS allows accelerated acquisition by reducing the data sampling requirements, whilst preserving image quality. The focus of this work was the effect of CS-MRSI at different acceleration factors upon spatial integrity. CS reconstruction software was developed and applied to retrospective MRSI data. Imaging test objects and software simulations were developed to assess MRSI spatial resolution via metabolite edge response measurements. CS-MRSI was also investigated in realistic scenarios using data from healthy volunteers and a child with Optic Pathway Glioma (OPG). The potential of CS-MRSI to enable high-resolution MRSI in feasible scan times was investigated using simulations of focal and infiltrative OPG. Results suggest that CS-MRSI can reduce scan duration by up to a factor of 5 whilst simultaneously eliminating ringing artefacts and increasing spatial resolution compared with conventionally filtered MRSI.

40|$|Sequence-specific DNA-binding activators, key {{regulators}} of gene expression, stimulate transcription {{in part by}} {{targeting the}} core promoter recognition TFIID complex and aiding in its recruitment to promoter DNA. Although it has been established that activators can interact with multiple components of TFIID, it is unknown whether common or distinct surfaces within TFIID are targeted by activators and what changes if any {{in the structure of}} TFIID may occur upon binding activators. As a first step toward structurally dissecting activator/TFIID interactions, we determined the three-dimensional structures of TFIID bound to three distinct activators (i. e., the tumor suppressor p 53 protein, glutamine-rich Sp 1 and the oncoprotein c-Jun) and compared their structures as determined by electron microscopy and single-particle reconstruction. By a combination of EM and <b>biochemical</b> <b>mapping</b> analysis, our results uncover distinct contact regions within TFIID bound by each activator. Unlike the coactivator CRSP/Mediator complex that undergoes drastic and global structural changes upon activator binding, instead, a rather confined set of local conserved structural changes were observed when each activator binds holo-TFIID. These results suggest that activator contact may induce unique structural features of TFIID, thus providing nanoscale information on activator-dependent TFIID assembly and transcription initiation...|$|R
50|$|In 2014, ENCODE {{researchers}} {{noted that}} in the literature, functional parts of the genome have been identified differently in previous studies depending on the approaches used. There have been three general approaches used to identify functional parts of the human genome: genetic approaches (which rely on changes in phenotype), evolutionary approaches (which rely on conservation) and biochemical approaches (which rely on biochemical testing and was used by ENCODE). All three have limitations: genetic approaches may miss functional elements that do not manifest physically on the organism, evolutionary approaches have difficulties using accurate multispecies sequence alignments since genomes of even closely related species vary considerably, and with biochemical approaches, though having high reproducibility, the biochemical signatures do not always automatically signify a function. They concluded that in contrast to evolutionary and genetic evidence, biochemical data offer clues about both the molecular function served by underlying DNA elements and the cell types in which they act and ultimately all three approaches {{can be used in}} a complementary way to identify regions that may be functional in human biology and disease. Furthermore, they noted that the <b>biochemical</b> <b>maps</b> provided by ENCODE were the most valuable things from the project since they provide a starting point for testing how these signatures relate to molecular, cellular, and organismal function.|$|R

Alternating purine and pyrimidine tracts longer than 5 base pairs in length and their clusters (quasi alternating fragments) in the 14 genomes studied are under-represented compared to the expectation from corresponding random sequences. The fragments [d(G X C) ]n and [d(C X G) ]n (n {{greater than or equal to}} 3) in general do not occur in circular DNA genomes and are under-represented in the linear DNAs of phages lambda and T 7, whereas in linear genomes of adenoviruses they are strongly over-represented.

40|$|The plasma {{membrane}} H+-ATPase of Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{is subject to}} phosphorylation by a casein kinase I activity in vitro. We show this casein kinase I activity to result from the combined function of YCK 1 and YCK 2, two highly similar and {{plasma membrane}}-associated casein kinase I homologues. First, H+-ATPase phosphorylation is severely impaired in the plasma membrane of YCK-deficient yeast strains. Furthermore, the wild-type level of the phosphoprotein is restored {{by the addition of}} purified mammalian casein kinase I to the mutant membranes. We used the H+-ATPase as well as a synthetic peptide substrate that contains a phosphorylation site for casein kinase I to compare kinase activity in membranes prepared from yeast cells grown in {{the presence or absence of}} glucose. The addition of glucose results in increased H+-ATPase activity which is associated with a decline in the phosphorylation level of the enzyme. Mutations in both YCK 1 and YCK 2 affect this regulation, suggesting that H+-ATPase activity is modulated by glucose via a combination of a "down-regulating" casein kinase I activity and another, yet uncharacterized, "up-regulating" kinase activity. <b>Biochemical</b> <b>mapping</b> of phosphorylated H+-ATPase identifies a major phosphopeptide that contains a consensus phosphorylation site (Ser- 507) for casein kinase I.

40|$|DNA topoisomerases are {{ubiquitous}} {{enzymes that}} govern the topological interconversions of DNA thereby playing {{a key role in}} many aspects of nucleic acid metabolism. Recently determined crystal structures of topoisomerase fragments, representing nearly all the known subclasses, have been solved. The type IB enzymes are structurally distinct from other known topoisomerases but are similar to a class of enzymes referred to as tyrosine recombinases. A putative topoisomerase I open reading frame from the kinetoplastid Leishmania donovani was reported which shared a substantial degree of homology with type IB topoisomerases but having a variable C-terminus. Here we present a molecular model of the above parasite gene product, using the human topoisomerase I crystal structure in complex with a 22 bp oligonucleotide as a template. Our studies indicate that the overall structure of the parasite protein is similar to the human enzyme; however, major differences occur in the C-terminal loop, which harbors a serine in place of the usual catalytic tyrosine. Most other structural themes common to type IB topoisomerases, including secondary structural folds, hinged clamps that open and close to bind DNA, nucleophilic attack on the scissile DNA strand and formation of a ternary complex with the topoisomerase I inhibitor camptothecin could be visualized in our homology model.

Quantified spectral metabolite peaks were used to select voxels that had high or low alanine for tissue sampling. 3 D 1 H-MRSI was integrated into a standard image guided surgery (IGS) system; a mask of the voxel was loaded onto the IGS system allowing surgeons to precisely extract tissue intraoperatively according to <b>biochemical</b> <b>mapping.</b> Ex vivo NMR and conventional histological grading were performed on the extracted tissue. Results: Tumor spectra showed biochemically heterogeneous regions, especially for choline, lactate and alanine.

In addition, lower grade meningiomas showed high alanine at the tumor periphery with decreased central alanine. Ex vivo NMR was well-correlated with in vivo 3 D 1 H-MRSI. Conclusions: Non-invasive detection of various intratumoral biochemical markers using 3 D 1 H-MRSI can distinguish areas within meningiomas that express more aggressive features. There is regional heterogeneity in the concentrations of these markers within individual tumors. Furthermore, 3 D 1 H-MRSI {{may be able to}} exploit these regional differences to separate more aggressive from less aggressive areas within a given meningioma.

40|$|<b>Biochemical</b> <b>mapping</b> {{experiments}} of the simian rotavirus SA 11 genome {{were performed}} to determine which double-stranded RNA segment coded {{for each of the}} viral polypeptides. Viral RNA transcripts were synthesized in vitro by using the endogenous viral RNA polymerase and fractionated by electrophoresis in acid-urea agarose gels. The fractionated transcripts were translated in two cell-free systems: micrococcal nuclease-treated reticulocyte lysates and wheat germ extracts. The polypeptide products were identified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and partial peptide analysis and compared with polypeptides synthesized in infected cells or found in purified virus. The RNA segment that coded for each transcript was determined by hybridization of the fractionated transcripts to the double-stranded RNA genome and analysis of the hybrids by electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels. Primary gene products were assigned for 10 of the rotavirus transcripts and 10 of the double-stranded RNA segments. The coding assignments are as follows: the inner-capsid polypeptides, VP 1, VP 2, and VP 6, were assigned to segments 1, 2, and 6, respectively; the major outer-capsid polypeptides, VP 3 and VP 7, were assigned to segments 4 and 9, respectively; segments 5, 7, and 8 coded for nonstructural polypeptides with molecular weights of 53, 000, 34, 000, and 35, 000, respectively; segment 10 coded for the 20, 000 -molecular-weight precursor to the 29, 000 -molecular-weight glycosylated nonstructural polypeptide; and segment 11 coded for a 26, 000 -molecular-weight polypeptide that may be the precursor to the minor outer-capsid polypeptide VP 9. Several methods were used to determine the product of gene segment 3, and the problems associated with the identification of this gene product are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Understanding {{biochemical}} {{mechanisms and}} changes associated with disease conditions and, therefore, development of improved clinical treatments, is relying increasingly on various <b>biochemical</b> <b>mapping</b> and imaging techniques on tissue sections. However, {{it is essential}} to be able to ascertain whether the sampling used provides the full biochemical information relevant to the disease and is free from artefacts. A multi-modal micro-spectroscopic approach, including FTIR imaging and PIXE elemental mapping, has been used to study the molecular and elemental profile within cryofixed and formalin-fixed murine brain tissue sections. The results provide strong evidence that amino acids, carbohydrates, lipids, phosphates, proteins and ions, such as Cl(-) and K(+), leach from tissue sections into the aqueous fixative medium during formalin fixation of the sections. Large changes in the concentrations and distributions of most of these components are also observed by washing in PBS even for short periods. The most likely source of the chemical species lost during fixation is the extra-cellular and intra-cellular fluid of tissues. The results highlight that, at best, analysis of formalin-fixed tissues gives only part of the complete biochemical "picture'' of a tissue sample. Further, this investigation has highlighted that significant lipid peroxidation/oxidation may occur during formalin fixation and that the use of standard histological fixation reagents can result in significant and differential metal contamination of different regions of tissue sections. While a consistent and reproducible fixation method may be suitable for diagnostic purposes, {{the findings of this study}} strongly question the use of formalin fixation prior to spectroscopic studies of the molecular and elemental composition of biological samples, if the primary purpose is mechanistic studies of disease pathogenesis. © 2011, Royal Society of Chemistr...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundExposure to {{environmental}} tobacco smoke (ETS) leads to higher rates of pulmonary diseases and infections in children. To study the biochemical changes that may precede lung diseases, metabolomic effects on fetal and maternal lungs and plasma from rats exposed to ETS were compared to filtered air control animals. Genome- reconstructed metabolic pathways {{may be used to}} map and interpret dysregulation in metabolic networks. However, mass spectrometry-based non-targeted metabolomics datasets often comprise many metabolites for which links to enzymatic reactions have not yet been reported. Hence, network visualizations that rely on current biochemical databases are incomplete and also fail to visualize novel, structurally unidentified metabolites. ResultsWe present a novel approach to integrate biochemical pathway and chemical relationships to map all detected metabolites in network graphs (MetaMapp) using KEGG reactant pair database, Tanimoto chemical and NIST mass spectral similarity scores. In fetal and maternal lungs, and in maternal blood plasma from pregnant rats exposed {{to environmental}} tobacco smoke (ETS), 459 unique metabolites comprising 179 structurally identified compounds were detected by gas chromatography time of flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOF MS) and BinBase data processing. MetaMapp graphs in Cytoscape showed much clearer metabolic modularity and complete content visualization compared to conventional <b>biochemical</b> <b>mapping</b> approaches. Cytoscape visualization of differential statistics results using these graphs showed that overall, fetal lung metabolism was more impaired than lungs and blood metabolism in dams. Fetuses from ETS-exposed dams expressed lower lipid and nucleotide levels and higher amounts of energy metabolism intermediates than control animals, indicating lower biosynthetic rates of metabolites for cell division, structural proteins and lipids that are critical for in lung development. ConclusionsMetaMapp graphs efficiently visualizes mass spectrometry based metabolomics datasets as network graphs in Cytoscape, and highlights metabolic alterations that can be associated with higher rate of pulmonary diseases and infections in children prenatally exposed to ETS.

40|$|Abstract — Early {{detection}} of cancer {{is key to}} reducing morbidity and mortality. Morphological and chemical biomarkers presage the transition from normal to cancerous tissue. We have developed a noninvasive imaging system incorporating optical coherence tomography (OCT) and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) into a single optical system for the first time, in order to acquire both sets of biomarkers. OCT can provide morphological images of tissue with high resolution while FLIM can provide <b>biochemical</b> tissue <b>maps.</b> Coregistered OCT volumes and FLIM images have been acquired simultaneously in an in vivo hamster cheek pouch model of oral cancer. The OCT images indicate morphological biomarkers for cancer including thickening of the epithelial layer and loss of the layered structure. The FLIM images indicate chemical biomarkers including increased NADH and reduced collagen emission. While both sets of biomarkers can differentiate normal and cancerous tissue we believe their combination will enable the discrimination of benign lesions possessing some of the indicated biomarkers e. g. scarring or inflammation...|$|R
40|$|This is the substrate-information {{tutorial}} of opm in {{the version}} of April 18, 2014. The precomputed information on the known Phenotype Microarray (PM) substrates is explained, {{as well as the}} methods available to query this information. IDs for a variety of databases are stored within opm and can be used to conduct web queries to obtain comprehensive information on the substrates of interest. We show how these data can be used to visualise results from PM experiments, including the outcome from advanced multiple-comparison statistics, within <b>biochemical</b> pathway <b>maps.</b> Visually comparing genome annotation and PM results is easily possible in that manner. Moreover, methods are described to automatically detect the substrate features that potentially explain a given experimental outcome. This includes determining the relevant pathways {{to be used in the}} visualisations. The final chapters of this tutorial provide examples for the powerful feature-selection approaches available within R with a focus on state-of-the-art boosting implementations...|$|R
