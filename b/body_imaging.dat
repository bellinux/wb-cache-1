40|$|We {{present a}} {{theoretical}} model to sufficiently investigate the optical rotational Doppler effect based on modal expansion method. We {{find that the}} frequency shift content is only determined by the surface of spinning object and the reduced Doppler shift is linear to the difference of mode index between input and output orbital angular momentum (OAM) light, and linear to the rotating speed of spinning object as well. An experiment is carried out to verify the theoretical model. We explicitly suggest that the spatial spiral phase distribution of spinning object determines the frequency content. The theoretical model makes us better understand the physical processes of rotational Doppler effect, and thus has many related application fields, such as detection of rotating <b>bodies,</b> <b>imaging</b> of surface and measurement of OAM light.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Over a {{cycle of}} seasons, ground-penetrating radar {{studies were carried out}} at Inuvik and Rankin Inlet, Northwest Territories. The two {{airports}} are part of the Forward Operating Location (FOL) program of the Department of National Defence and have been slated for significant upgrading of runways, taxiways and parking aprons. This provided a good opportunity to investigate the xtent of permafrost and its seasonal varia-tion at two locations distributed over a wide geographic area. The study method involved specific and repeated traverses with a Pulse EKKO III ground-penetrating radar unit. The survey was successful in locating massive ice <b>bodies,</b> <b>imaging</b> several existing problem areas beneath runways and mapping the seasonal depth of thaw in permafrost. The study results imply that future monitoring at FOL sites should be continued in light of suggested ground stability problems due to global warming...|$|R

40|$|The Sub-keV Atom Reflecting Analyzer (SARA) {{instrument}} on the Indian Chandrayaan- 1 spacecraft {{has produced}} {{for the first}} time an image of a lunar magnetic anomaly in backscattered hydrogen atoms. The image shows that a partial void of the solar wind, a mini-magnetosphere, is formed above the strong magnetic anomaly near the Crisium antipode. The mini-magnetosphere is 360 km across at the surface and is surrounded by a 300 -km-thick region of enhanced plasma flux that results from the solar wind flowing around the mini-magnetosphere. The mini-magnetosphere is visible only in hydrogen atoms with energy exceeding 150 eV. Fluxes with energies below 100 eV do not show corresponding spatial variations. While the high-energy atoms result from the backscattering process, the origin of the low-energy component is puzzling. These observations reveal a new class of objects, mini-magnetospheres, and demonstrate a new observational technique to study airless <b>bodies,</b> <b>imaging</b> in backscattered neutral atoms.

Also people with religious beliefs that require them to remain physically covered (arms, legs, face etc.) at all times will be unable and morally opposed to stepping inside of this virtually intrusive scanning technology.

40|$|Abstract. The Cassini Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) is the highest-resolution {{two-dimensional}} {{imaging device}} on the Cassini Orbiter {{and has been}} designed for investigations of the bodies and phenomena found within the Saturnian planetary system. It consists of two framing cameras: a narrow angle, reflecting telescope with a 2 -m focal length and a square field of view (FOV) 0. 35 ◦ across, and a wide-angle refractor with a 0. 2 -m focal length and a FOV 3. 5 ◦ across. At the heart of each camera is a charged coupled device (CCD) detector consisting of a 1024 square array of pixels, each 12 µ on a side. The data system allows many options for data collection, including choices for on-chip summing, rapid imaging and data compression. Each camera is outfitted {{with a large number}} of spectral filters which, taken together, span the electromagnetic spectrum from 200 to 1100 nm. These were chosen to address a multitude of Saturn-system scientific objectives: sounding the three-dimensional cloud structure and meteorology of the Saturn and Titan atmospheres, capturing lightning on both <b>bodies,</b> <b>imaging</b> the surfaces of Saturn’s many icy satellites, determining the structure of its enormous ring system, searching for previously undiscovered Saturnian moons (within and exterior to the rings) ...|$|R
