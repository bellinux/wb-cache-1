This created an oil-drilling glut, with thousands of speculators attempting to make their fortunes. Most failed, but those who struck oil did not even need to <b>be</b> <b>efficient.</b> They would blow holes {{in the ground and}} gather up the oil as they could, often leading to creeks and rivers flowing with wasted oil in the place of water.|$|E

The same current supply could be used for the electric fire engine system.|$|E

A core allocation, that is, an allocation that gives each coalition {{at least as}} much as it can get on its own, <b>is</b> <b>efficient.</b> However, some coalitional games lack a core allocation, so rationality does not require one in those games. Does rationality therefore permit exclusion from the social contract? I replace realization of a core allocation with another type of equilibrium achievable in every coalitional game.

5|$|A PPF (production {{possibility}} frontier) typically {{takes the}} form of the curve illustrated above. An economy that is operating on the PPF is said to <b>be</b> <b>efficient,</b> meaning that {{it would be impossible to}} produce more of one good without decreasing production of the other good. In contrast, if the economy is operating below the curve, it is said to be operating inefficiently because it could reallocate resources in order to produce more of both goods or some resources such as labor or capital are sitting idle and could be fully employed to produce more of both goods.|$|E
5|$|Plants {{and animals}} {{living in the}} desert need special adaptations {{to survive in the}} harsh environment. Plants tend to be tough and wiry with small or no leaves, {{water-resistant}} cuticles and often spines to deter herbivory. Some annual plants germinate, bloom and die {{in the course of a}} few weeks after rainfall while other long-lived plants survive for years and have deep root systems able to tap underground moisture. Animals need to keep cool and find enough food and water to survive. Many are nocturnal and stay in the shade or underground during the heat of the day. They tend to <b>be</b> <b>efficient</b> at conserving water, extracting most of their needs from their food and concentrating their urine. Some animals remain in a state of dormancy for long periods, ready to become active again when the rare rains fall. They then reproduce rapidly while conditions are favorable before returning to dormancy.|$|E

40|$|We study {{values for}} {{transferable}} utility games enriched by a communication graph (CO-games) where the graph {{does not necessarily}} affect the productivity but can influence the way the players distribute the worth generated by the grand coalition. Thus, we can envisage values that <b>are</b> <b>efficient</b> instead of values that <b>are</b> component <b>efficient.</b> For CO-games with connected graphs, efficiency and component efficiency coincide. In particular, the Myerson value (Myerson, 1977) <b>is</b> <b>efficient</b> for such games. Moreover, fairness is characteristic of the Myerson value. We identify the value that <b>is</b> <b>efficient</b> for all CO-games, coincides with the Myerson value for CO-games with connected graphs, and satisfies fairness...|$|R

Mill pointed to a distinct difference between the market's two roles: allocation of resources and distribution of income.
