A seal test rig designed at Heriot-Watt University and commissioned at Weir Pumps Research Laboratory in Alloa permits the identification of mass, stiffness, and damping coefficients using a least-squares technique based on the singular value decomposition method. The analysis is {{carried out in the}} time domain using a multi-fiequency forcing function. The experimental method relies on the forced excitation of a flexibly supported stator by two hydraulic shakers. Running through the stator embodying two symmetrical <b>balance</b> <b>drum</b> seals is a rigid rotor supported in rolling element bearings. The only physical connection between shaft and stator is the pair of annular gaps filled with pressurized water discharged axially.

40|$|The {{beneficial}} effects claimed for whirl control devices {{demonstrate that the}} dynamic behavior of rotors {{is influenced by the}} fluid whirl in shaft and <b>balance</b> <b>drum</b> seals. The present paper reports results from two series of experiments, the first on the factors affecting the whirl at the seal inlet, and the second on the variation of whirl velocity along the seal. In both cases the LDA measurement technique required the clearance between the fixed and rotating parts of the models to be substantially greater than occurs in real machines, but the results are indicative nevertheless. Experimental and theoretical results are given for the radial distribution of whirl velocity in the gap between impeller shroud and pump casing. Results of tests with modified stator surfaces are also shown. This work leads naturally into the second series of experiments where some preliminary measurements of velocity distribution in the clearance between a fixed stator and a rotating shaft are reported for a range of inlet whirl conditions...|$|R
40|$|Lecturepg. 53 - 70 For many {{application}} fields of turbocompressors the rotor stability {{has become the}} most important part of the rotordynamic analysis. A comprehensive knowledge of these seal forces is mandatory to ensure an adequate overall design of the compressor as early as the quotation phase. While in earlier times the focus was on the <b>balance</b> <b>drum</b> contribution as the major source of excitation, it has in the meantime become evident that the effects from the impeller eye-seals also have to be considered as a further destabilizing contribution. However, up to now the task of measurement of impeller-eye-seal dynamic coefficients has remained a major challenge. This paper presents a new approach for generation of high-quality data on a unique full-scale high-pressure test rig, in which specific attention is paid to impeller-eye seals. The applied strategy combines results from the test rig obtained from different methods with findings from computational fluid dynamic (CFD) investigations. The publication of dimensional data offers further use of these results within the turbomachinery community...|$|R
40|$|Multistage {{horizontal}} {{boiler feed}} pumps are {{designed and built}} in two different configurations: with equidirectional or with opposite impellers. Advantages and disadvantages of the two design criteria are hereto analysed and described. The study is carried out from hydraulic and structural point of view. A particular attention is addressed to the axial load balance and to the lateral dynamic analysis, with new and worn clearance conditions. A complete calculation of rotor dynamic behaviour in both configurations has been performed using the finite element method. The model of the shaft has been meshed using beam elements, while linearised coefficients have been evaluated in order to simulate stiffness and damping of sleeve bearings, impeller wear rings, <b>balancing</b> <b>drums</b> and interstage seals. Undamped critical speed map, damped mode shapes and Campbell diagrams are presented and discussed. Calculation results are confirmed by experimental measurements carried out on an opposite impeller multistage pump, where non contacting probes have been installed nearby sleeve bearings locations, and order tracking method has been applied during start-up and coast-down transients...|$|R

40|$|Present work aims to the {{numerical}} investigation of horizontal multistage centrifugal pumps in opposite impeller configuration. Its main target {{is to apply}} a three-dimensional CFD based tool to the axial thrust prediction in a multistage industrial machine. A flexible use of CFD is presented to extend the hydraulic behaviour evaluation for the single components to the whole pump characterization. A mixing plane technique has been chosen to study the interaction between rotating and stationary parts. This procedure {{takes into account the}} effects of different incidences and inlet velocity distortions. The 3 D CFD investigation on every single component of the multistage pump allows a thorough knowledge of its fluid dynamic fields, but only a correct matching and interpretation of all the components provide a reliable prediction of pump axial thrust as well as its performance curve. Despite the potential high degree of realism allowed by CFD, modelling the whole pump geometry may be quite expensive. In fact, the pump includes a great amount of components and several geometrical details (i. e. inlet and outlet volutes, inter-stage cross-over, leakages through wear rings and <b>balancing</b> <b>drums)</b> that have {{to be taken into account}} for a good prediction of the axial thrust. These issues lead to a consistent amount of numerical modelling problems which are considered and discussed...|$|R
40|$|LecturePg. 39 - 54 This paper {{explains}} {{the design and}} testing of a high-pressure centrifugal compressor. It also covers commissioning and field experience. Importance issues for high-pressure compressors are highlighted in the paper in general terms and for a specific design. Included are the mechanical impeller design, seal clearance control, and rotor stability. The impeller integrity is ensured by means of finite element analysis and supported by experimental modal analysis. During full load testing, a unique measurement was also carried out in order to verify the relative rotor displacement in the <b>balance</b> <b>drum</b> labyrinth under transient conditions. Special consideration {{is given to the}} verification of analytical rotor stability predictions, which is of major importance for high-pressure applications. The forces originating from the labyrinth seals tend to destabilize the rotor. The rotordynamic analysis is presented for a 418 bar (6061 psi) natural gas reinjection compressor. The predictions from this analysis were verified during an ASME/PTC- 10 Class I (1997) test on the test stand. The compressor was tested with and without labyrinth swirl brakes installed resulted in reliable, trouble-free operation. This has been confirmed by actual field data from a floating production, storage, and offloading (FPSO) vessel in the North Sea...|$|R

40|$|LectureHigh {{pressure}} {{centrifugal compressors}} are often equipped with honeycomb seal on <b>balance</b> <b>drum</b> {{in order to}} optimize rotordynamic stability. In very high pressures applications (> 200 bar) the direct stiffness and damping of the honeycomb seal may reach the same order of magnitude of the journal bearings, thus altering the peak frequency and amplification factor of rotor critical speeds {{as well as their}} mode shapes. This phenomenon is ultimately due to the density and viscosity of the gas leakage flowing through the seal, and it has a substantial effect on the rotordynamic behavior of the compressor. According to current standards, aerodynamic seal effects are not necessarily included in the calculation of rotor response to unbalance. For high pressure compressors equipped with a honeycomb seal, the associated aerodynamic effects may have major impacts on rotor critical speeds in terms of frequency, amplitude and amplification factor. A procedure for the calculation of rotor response in loaded condition is here proposed, aiming to improve the predictability of the rotordynamic analysis and to provide practical criteria for the evaluation of the outcome. A back-to-back compressor with final discharge pressure of 386 bar is presented as case study; it was tested at full pressure at Authors? Company facilities in 2013. In this case the stiffening effect of the honeycomb seal is particularly relevant, since it is positioned close to rotor midspan. Test measures show that in loaded condition the 1 st critical speed shifts upwards by several thousand rpm, eventually exceeding the Maximum Critical Speed and even the Trip Speed of the compressor...|$|R

40|$|LectureAnnular {{clearance}} spaces, such as impeller wearing rings, inter 0 stage {{bushes and}} <b>balance</b> <b>drums</b> in centrifugal pumps, or the fluid-filled clearance around the armature of the submerged motor, at a first glance present {{the appearance of}} very weak journal bearings. The fluid has very low viscosity compared with lubricating oils, and clearances are much larger than in proper journal bearings. Two factors invalidate this deceptive view. Firstly, the Reynold numbers of flows in these spaces are very high, rendering flows turbulent. This greatly increases effective viscosities. Secondly, fluid inertia effects not normally encountered in journal bearings and become basic determining factors of the bearing forces raised by internal clearances of the type indicated. In clearance spaces of centrifugal pumps, the high pressure differences across the clearance spaces bring about a sudden pressure drop owing to acceleration into the space. This converts the clearance space into a powerful hydrostatic bearing. As the journal rotates and vibrates, damping and crossing coupling forces are developed as well as radial stiffness. Here, fluid inertia is significant only in the entry loss effect which controls hydrostatic stiffness. In the submerged motor, where the fine clearance surrounds a large length of shaft, fluid inertia effects in the clearance space itself become dominant. Both types of clearance space alter the synchronous response and stability limits of the rotor (beyond recognition), {{as compared with the}} performance in air. In centrifugal pumps, generally, the internal clearances both raise and damp critical speeds and improve stability margins. There are, however, special circumstances where these clearances become destabilizing elements. In submerged motors, critical speeds are substantially reduced and damped, and the type of destabilization normally associated with circular journal bearings may be encountered. The paper explains these phenomena and illustrates them with simple calculations...|$|R

5000|$|The Bendir (بندير; plural banadir, بنادير is a frame drum. [...] The term Bendir {{means in}} Turkish {{language}} a big hand frame drum, {{which is known}} as Duff in Arabic language. Used as a traditional instrument throughout North Africa. Unlike the tambourine, it has no jingles but most often has a snare (usually made of gut) stretched across its head, which when the drum is struck with the fingers or palm gives the tone a buzzing quality. The bendir is a frame drum with a wooden frame and a membrane. It creates different tones according to the spreading of the shock waves moving across the skins itself. A frame drum is {{the oldest and most}} common kind of drum. The bendir is used throughout North Africa, Ancient Egypt, and Mesopotamia. The bendir drum has been around since prehistoric times. The bendir is about 14 to 16 inches. The drum is played kept vertical by inserting the thumb of the left hand in a special holes in the frame. The bandir or bendir is used in the special ceremonies of the Sufi. The Sufi tradition is strongly characterized by the use of music, rhythm, and dance to reach particular states of consciousness. The bendir has a small hole in the bottom, which is used to <b>balance</b> the <b>drum</b> {{at the base of the}} left thumb as the left hand fingers that the rim and the right hand plays the rim and center.It is mainly used in the following countries: Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya and sometimes Egypt.

A version of it exists in Ireland called the Bodhrán which is usually played with a beater.|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} the {{possibility}} of actively <b>balancing</b> the spin <b>drum</b> in a washing machine is examined. Due {{to the fact that}} the unbalance in washing machines is highly variable, e. g. by water leaving the laundry during spin drying, active balancing is required where the balancing system continuously is changing according to how much unbalance there is to counterbalance. The idea is to use a concept which with the help of an eccentric mechanism displaces the spin drum during spin drying, thus counteract the unbalance which arises when the laundry has been unevenly distributed before spin drying. In the thesis a preliminary study in rotor dynamics has been done to examine what kind of different techniques there are for active balancing whereupon a development of other concepts to be compared to the eccentric mechanism was done. Primarily to find out if the concept already exists but also to examine if there are other concepts that could be comparable to or even better than the eccentric mechanism. The eccentric mechanism was considered to be the most potential concept. A design including the mechanical parts of the eccentric mechanism has been dimensioned to be able to use in a physical prototype and to make it possible to execute a spin drying speed of 2000 rpm without excessive vibrations. The eccentric mechanism was modelled in Pro/ENGINEER and its behaviour has been studied in a computerised model of ASKO Cylinda washing machine in ADAMS/View. Through analysis in the virtual model it was found that the model is comparable to a physical machine and the vibrations caused by the unbalance can be strongly reduced by the use of the eccentric mechanism...|$|R
