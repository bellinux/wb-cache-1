For more than 50 years, Freedom House has been a voice for {{tolerance}} for human dignity. People {{all over the world are}} better off because of your work. And I'm very grateful that Freedom House has rallied this diverse and dynamic group.

500|$|Owing to {{his time}} as a POW, McCain has been {{recognized}} for his sensitivity to the detention and interrogation of detainees in the War on Terror. In October 2005, McCain introduced the McCain Detainee Amendment to the Defense Appropriations bill for 2005, and the Senate voted 90–9 to support the amendment. It prohibits inhumane treatment of prisoners, including prisoners at Guantanamo Bay, by confining military interrogations to the techniques in the U.S. Army Field Manual on Interrogation. Although Bush had threatened to veto the bill if McCain's amendment was included, the President announced in December 2005 that he accepted McCain's terms and would [...] "make {{it clear to the}} world that this government does not torture and that we adhere to the international convention of torture, whether it <b>be</b> <b>here</b> <b>at</b> home or abroad". This stance, among others, led to McCain being named by Time magazine in 2006 as one of America's 10 Best Senators. McCain voted in February 2008 against a bill containing a ban on waterboarding, which provision was later narrowly passed and vetoed by Bush. However, the bill in question contained other provisions to which McCain objected, and his spokesman stated: [...] "This wasn't a vote on waterboarding. This was a vote on applying the standards of the [...] field manual to CIA personnel." ...|$|E

[...] Bush made clear his interpretation of this legislation on December 30, 2005, in a signing statement, reserving what he interpreted to be his presidential constitutional authority in order to avoid further terrorist attacks.|$|E
