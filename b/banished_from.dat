Memories of Sycorax, who dies several years before the main action of the play begins, define several of the relationships in the play.

5|$|The four {{civilians were}} tried on December 13. The {{principal}} prosecution witness, a servant {{of one of}} the accused, made claims that were easily rebutted by defense witnesses. In the face of this weak testimony, as well as waning public interest, the prosecution allegedly failed to press its case very hard. The civilians were all acquitted, and the servant was eventually convicted of perjury, whipped, and <b>banished</b> <b>from</b> the province.|$|E
5|$|The {{portrayal}} of nudes was officially discouraged in 17th-century Spain. Works could be seized or repainting {{demanded by the}} Inquisition, and artists who painted licentious or immoral works were often excommunicated, fined, or <b>banished</b> <b>from</b> Spain for a year. However, within intellectual and aristocratic circles, the aims of art were believed to supersede questions of morality, and there were many, generally mythological, nudes in private collections.|$|E

The handle of the ewer is topped by a figure of Hercules slaying the Hydra, symbolising the triumph of virtue over vice.|$|E
5|$|A year later, Catherine was <b>banished</b> <b>from</b> court, and her {{rooms were}} given to Anne. Anne was an unusually educated and {{intellectual}} woman for her time, and was keenly absorbed and engaged {{with the ideas of}} the Protestant Reformers, though the extent to which she herself was a committed Protestant is much debated. When Archbishop of Canterbury William Warham died, Anne's influence and the need to find a trustworthy supporter of the annulment had Thomas Cranmer appointed to the vacant position. This was approved by the Pope, unaware of the King's nascent plans for the Church.|$|E
5|$|Despite the treaty, Henry {{set about}} inflicting severe {{penalties}} on the barons who had stood against {{him during the}} invasion. William de Warenne, the Earl of Surrey, was accused of fresh crimes, which were {{not covered by the}} Alton amnesty, and was <b>banished</b> <b>from</b> England. In 1102 Henry then turned against Robert of Bellême and his brothers, the most powerful of the barons, accusing him of 45 different offences. Robert escaped and took up arms against Henry. Henry besieged Robert's castles at Arundel, Tickhill and Shrewsbury, pushing down into the south-west to attack Bridgnorth. His power base in England broken, Robert accepted Henry's offer of banishment and left the country for Normandy.|$|E

5|$|Géza was {{the eldest}} son of the future King Béla I of Hungary and his wife Richeza or Adelhaid, a {{daughter}} of King Mieszko II of Poland.

Géza was born in about 1040. According to the historians Gyula Kristó and Ferenc Makk, he was named after his grandfather's uncle Géza, Grand Prince of the Hungarians. His baptismal name was Magnus.|$|E
5|$|His {{relationship}} with King Edgar is unclear, particularly given {{the uncertainty of}} Thored's paternity, Oslac being <b>banished</b> <b>from</b> England in 975, the year of Edgar's death. Richard Fletcher, who thought Thored {{was the son of}} Gunnar, argued that Thored's raid on Westmorland was caused by resentment derived from losing out on the ealdormanry to Oslac, and that Edgar thereafter confiscated various territories as punishment. The evidence for this is that Newbald, granted by Edgar to Gunnar circa 963, was bought by Archbishop Osketel from the king sometime before 971, implying that the king had seized the land.|$|E
5|$|In 1094, Roger the Poitevin {{founded the}} Benedictine priory of St. Mary at Lancaster, as a cell of the Norman Abbey of St. Martin in Sées.

In 1194 King Richard I granted the hundred of Amounderness to Theobald Walter, 1st Baron Butler, who held it {{until his death in}} 1206. In 1268, King Henry III granted the wapentake of Amounderness to his son Edmund Crouchback, who became the 1st Earl of Lancaster around this time.|$|E

5|$|In 975, {{not long}} after the death of King Edgar, Oslac was <b>banished</b> <b>from</b> England. No reason is given by the Anglo-Saxon Chronicles report of his expulsion. Version C of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle {{describes}} the events thus:The valiant Oslac was driven from the country, over the tossing waves, the gannet's bath, the tumult of the waters, the homeland of the whale; a grey-haired man, wise and skilled in speech, he was bereft of his lands The historian Richard Fletcher guesses that Oslac's downfall may have been the result of opposing the succession of Edward the Martyr.|$|E
5|$|In {{developing}} the mythology behind the film, the creators used many inspirations. For instance, several character names are near-anagrams: Elly Kedward (The Blair Witch) is Edward Kelley, a 16th-century mystic, and Rustin Parr, the fictional 1940s child-murderer, {{began as an}} anagram for Rasputin. Viewers are told that the Blair Witch is, according to legend, the ghost of Elly Kedward, a woman <b>banished</b> <b>from</b> the Blair Township (latter-day Burkittsville) for witchcraft in 1785. The directors incorporated {{that part of the}} legend, along with allusions to the Salem witch trials and Arthur Miller's 1953 play The Crucible, to play on the themes of injustice done on those who were called witches.|$|E
