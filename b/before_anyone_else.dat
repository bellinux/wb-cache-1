50|$|The {{format of}} the tournament {{required}} 4 seeded fighters to each choose their opponent from the 4 remaining unseeded fighters in a draft. The seeded fighters were determined by the organizers. The draft took place on July 8, 2017 in a gala hosted by actress Melanie Winiger in Monte Carlo. Per IBF rules, Gassiev had to defend his title against Włodarczyk <b>before</b> facing <b>anyone</b> <b>else.</b> Therefore, that matchup was pre-arranged before the draft.|$|R

Being a very athletic person, he used his talent {{for the sole purpose of}} brawling and actually becomes a real delinquent. To make his appearance more noticeable, he dyed his hair blond. Being the most self-centered person in this manga, his own safety comes <b>before</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>else's,</b> he often sacrifices his [...] "friends" [...] for his cause. He is greedy and cunning. Although, beneath his devilish personality lies a softer side, which shows from time to time, especially when he is angry. His fighting style is based around his speed, as he often dodges most attacks, becoming surprised whenever he is forced to block due to being faster than most of the people he encounters. His love interest is Riko-chan.|$|R

He was more negative towards the episode itself as he said [...] ""Game on, Charles" [...] was a rather disappointing affair. Considering the episode order has been shaved this season, they really could have fit a lot more in. As much as I love the sarcasm of the girls, some of {{that could have been}} traded in for some more answers. Yes, we need those when we are six seasons in." ...|$|R
25|$|In 1983, Senna {{tested for}} Formula One teams Williams, McLaren, Brabham, and Toleman. Peter Warr of Lotus, Ron Dennis of McLaren, and Bernie Ecclestone of Brabham made offers for testing in 1984 and {{presented}} long-term contracts that tied Senna to driving later on. During his test for Williams at the 3.149-km (1.957-mi) Donington Park circuit, Senna completed 40 laps and was quicker {{than the other}} drivers, including Williams's reigning World Champion Keke Rosberg. Neither Williams nor McLaren had a vacancy for the 1984 season. Both Williams boss Frank Williams and McLaren boss Ron Dennis noted that Senna insisted that he got to run their cars <b>before</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>else</b> (other than their regular drivers such as Rosberg) {{so that he would}} have the best chance of a good showing by having a fresh car.|$|E
500|$|In April 2017, Judge Kocoras {{dismissed}} the suit, finding that John did not {{qualify as a}} [...] "whistleblower" [...] under the FCA. John's attorney said that an appeal was possible. The dismissal [...] "did not turn on whether Hastert actually misused the speaker's office, but rather whether John met a prerequisite for [...] suit: that he brought the allegations to the government’s attention <b>before</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>else</b> and before they were made public." [...] Kocoras held that John had falsely claims that he had told the FBI about possible misuse of federal resources by Hastert.|$|E
500|$|By 1975, punk {{was being}} used to {{describe}} acts {{as diverse as the}} Patti Smith Group, the Bay City Rollers, and Bruce Springsteen. As the scene at New York's CBGB club attracted notice, a name was sought for the developing sound. Club owner Hilly Kristal called the movement [...] "street rock"; John Holmstrom credits Aquarian magazine with using punk [...] "to describe what was going on at CBGBs". Holmstrom, McNeil, and Ged Dunn's magazine Punk, which debuted at the end of 1975, was crucial in codifying the term. [...] "It was pretty obvious that the word was getting very popular", Holmstrom later remarked. [...] "We figured we'd take the name <b>before</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>else</b> claimed it. We {{wanted to get rid of}} the bullshit, strip it down to rock 'n' roll. We wanted the fun and liveliness back." ...|$|E
50|$|There was a prophecy {{that the}} Giants {{could not be}} killed by the gods alone, but they could be killed {{with the help of}} a mortal.

50|$|At {{the time}} Dr. Ferguson {{began his career}} at Fort Qu'Appelle, BCG {{vaccination}} was, controversial. This grew to a fever pitch in 1929 when 270 infants in Lubeck Germany were vaccinated with a vaccine which was supposedly BCG but {{which turned out to}} be virulent tubercle bacillus. Seventy seven children died of tuberculosis. The idea of introducing live tubercle into the human body was considered dubious from perspectives of both health and morality. However, the reality in 1926 was that natives were ten times more likely than non-natives to die from tuberculosis. And the risk of BCG vaccination was theoretical; not proven. Dr. Ferguson felt it was justified. He was so convinced of the value of BCG vaccination that to prove its safety he vaccinated his own children, <b>before</b> vaccinating <b>anyone</b> <b>else.</b>|$|R
50|$|The story {{takes place}} in the fictional town of Wentworth, Ohio, a typical {{suburban}} community. On Poplar Street, an autistic boy named Seth has gained the power to control reality through the help of a being known as Tak. Soon, Poplar Street begins to change shape, transforming from a quiet suburb into a wild west caricature based on what Seth has seen on his television. Meanwhile, the other residents of the street are being attacked by the many beings that Seth's imagination is creating, due to Tak's control over them. These residents are forced to work together to stop Seth and Tak from completely transforming the world around them and stop Tak <b>before</b> he kills <b>anyone</b> <b>else.</b>|$|R
500|$|Nansen {{wanted the}} ship in one year; {{he was eager to}} get away <b>before</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>else</b> could adopt his ideas and {{forestall}} him. [...] The ship's most significant external feature was the roundness of the hull, designed so that there was nothing upon which the ice could get a grip. Bow, stern and keel were rounded off, and the sides smoothed so that, in Nansen's words, the vessel would [...] "slip like an eel out of the embraces of the ice". [...] To give exceptional strength the hull was sheathed in South American greenheart, the hardest timber available. The three layers of wood forming the hull provided a combined thickness of between 24 and 28inches (60–70cm), increasing to around 48inches (1.25metres) at the bow, which was further protected by a protruding iron stem. Added strength was provided by crossbeams and braces throughout the length of the hull.|$|E
500|$|After Val and Eric foster Amy, {{she starts}} acting rebellious again. She starts {{drinking}} and throwing herself at men, forcing her foster parents to have second thoughts. Halfpenny told Inside Soap that Amy goes off the rails {{because she is}} convinced everything goes wrong in her life. [...] "She's afraid of getting hurt, so she spoils things for herself <b>before</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>else</b> can get there first." [...] Halfpenny explained that Val's parental approach compared to Eric's was contrasting. Eric had not been around when his son David Metcalfe (Matthew Wolfenden) grew up, Halfpenny said this factor meant that Eric is not tolerant with Amy's bad behaviour. Though, Val had brought up her own children, her approach towards Amy is [...] "light-hearted." [...] However, when Amy continues her alcohol binges, Val and Eric feel she has [...] "gone too far" [...] and [...] "question their {{ability to cope with}} her." [...] Served with an ultimatum, Amy has to endure changes to remain with her new family. Halfpenny claimed the main change she had to make was [...] "to keep her tongue in her own mouth and cool it down with the boys." ...|$|E
500|$|Unlike McKay and Gill, however, Ferguson praised both Davies' {{acting and}} the episode as a whole, deeming it [...] "the best thing on {{television}} all week". He opined that Davies: [...] "plays Creek to easy perfection: mumbling, lugubrious, quietly brilliant", {{and called the}} plot [...] "involving, intriguing, [...] original", stating that it [...] "did the thing all good thrillers, books or films, do of getting you actively, cleverly involved in thinking {{you can see the}} answer <b>before</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>else.</b> You couldn't." [...] The List's Brian Donaldson was also positive about the episode, calling it [...] "surprisingly splendid festive fare", in which [...] "The twists and resolutions were, to this watcher at least, as well hidden as Davies’ ears underneath that shaggy bonce." [...] The Times Tim Teeman deemed the episode [...] "comfort television", commenting on its [...] "rambling pace" [...] and writing that: [...] "Our hero was brainy and cranky and the show itself awkward, funny and idiosyncratic (as you'd expect from the creator, writer and director David Renwick)." [...] The Daily Telegraph Gerard O'Donovan agreed that the episode felt [...] "comfy and familiar", but also found its run-time overstretched, writing that it: ...|$|E

It is a peculiarity of kleptomania, as you are no doubt aware, that the subject is unable to differentiate between the intrinsic values of objects.

500|$|Beatles biographer Bill Harry {{wrote that}} Lennon began drawing and writing creatively {{at an early}} age with the {{encouragement}} of his uncle. He collected his stories, poetry, cartoons and caricatures in a Quarry Bank High School exercise book that he called the Daily Howl. The drawings were often of crippled people, and the writings satirical, and throughout the book was an abundance of wordplay. According to classmate Bill Turner, Lennon created the Daily Howl to amuse his best friend and later Quarrymen bandmate Pete Shotton, to whom he would show his work <b>before</b> he let <b>anyone</b> <b>else</b> see it. Turner said that Lennon [...] "had an obsession for Wigan Pier. It kept cropping up", and in Lennon's story A Carrot in a Potato Mine, [...] "the mine {{was at the end of}} Wigan Pier." [...] Turner described how one of Lennon's cartoons depicted a bus stop sign annotated with the question, [...] "Why?". Above was a flying pancake, and below, [...] "a blind man wearing glasses leading along a blind dog—also wearing glasses".|$|R
500|$|The Ideas {{from the}} Deep team, who {{referred}} {{to themselves as}} the [...] "IFD guys", {{could not afford to}} leave their jobs to work on the game full-time, so they continued to work at Softdisk making Gamer's Edge games during the day while working on Commander Keen at night. They also continued to take home their work computers to Carmack's house on the weekends, putting them in their cars at night and bringing them back in the morning <b>before</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>else</b> arrived; they even began to request upgrades to the computers from Softdisk, nominally for their work. The group split into different roles: Hall became the game designer and creative director, John Carmack and Romero were the programmers, and Wilbur the manager. They invited artist Adrian Carmack from Softdisk to join them late in development, while Roathe was soon kicked out of the group; Romero, the self-appointed leader of the team, liked him but felt that his work ethic did not match well {{with the rest of the}} team and pushed for his removal. Ideas from the Deep spent nearly every waking moment when they were not working at Softdisk from October through December 1990 working on Commander Keen, with Wilbur forcing them to eat and take breaks. Several members of the team have mentioned in interviews as an example of the team's commitment a night during development when a heavy storm flooded the path to get to the house, preventing them from working, and John Romero waded through a flooding river to make it to the house anyway.|$|E

5000|$|Over {{the course}} of the next five months, Mary Weiss became {{convinced}} that Markingson’s condition was deteriorating and tried repeatedly to have him removed from the CAFÉ study. She warned the University of Minnesota research team that Markingson was in danger of committing suicide.
