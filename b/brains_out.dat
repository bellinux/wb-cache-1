500|$|I was {{surprised}} by how people reacted to [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] because when I did that song, to me, I was singing about how something made me feel a certain way—brand-new and fresh—and everyone interpreted it as I don't {{want to be a}} virgin anymore. Fuck my <b>brains</b> <b>out!</b> That's not what I sang at all. [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] was always absolutely ambiguous.|$|E
500|$|By 1984 Terry-Thomas was {{increasingly}} depressed by his condition {{and when he}} was interviewed that year, he admitted that [...] "one doctor said I've got about four more years to live. God forbid! I shall probably blow my <b>brains</b> <b>out</b> first". In 1987 the couple could no longer afford to live in Spain, so they moved back to London. They lived in a series of rented properties before ending up in a three-room, unfurnished charity flat, where they lived with financial assistance from the Actors' Benevolent Fund. Richard Briers was one of his first visitors at the flat, and was shocked by the change he saw: [...] "itting there, motionless, he was just a mere shadow. A crippled, crushed, shadow. It was really bloody awful." ...|$|E
500|$|Cagney's {{next film}} was Mister Roberts, {{directed}} by John Ford and slated to star Spencer Tracy. [...] Tracy's involvement ensured that Cagney accepted a supporting role, {{although in the}} end, Tracy did not take part. Cagney had worked with Ford before on What Price Glory?, and they had gotten along fairly well. However, as soon as Ford met Cagney at the airport, the director warned him that they would [...] "tangle asses", which caught Cagney by surprise. He later said, [...] "I would have kicked his <b>brains</b> <b>out.</b> He was so goddamned mean to everybody. He was truly a nasty old man." [...] The next day, Cagney was slightly late on set, incensing Ford. Cagney cut short his imminent tirade, saying [...] "When I started this picture, you said that we would tangle asses before this was over. I'm ready now – are you?" [...] Ford walked away, {{and they had no}} more problems, though Cagney never particularly liked Ford.|$|E

500|$|Richard Eisenbeis of Kotaku {{described}} Makoto Yuki {{as being}} an initially [...] "ambivalent, broken character" [...] and added that the character's growth took center stage in the film. He also remarked that the film could have [...] "been a very dark, difficult-to-see movie" [...] since the majority of it takes place at night but praised the lighting effects and contrasts which rendered the action easily visible while creating a [...] "visual style all its own". On the flip side, Eisenbeis explained that while the movie covers only {{the very beginning of}} the Persona 3 story, there was [...] "the unfortunate side effect of a good chunk of the main cast and the majority of the antagonists not even being in the movie." [...] Adding that since none of the game's key plot twists are reached, he felt that it was [...] "a very simple, straight-forward movie." [...] Eisenbeis also noted that the film had [...] "more images of teen suicide than you can shake a stick at". The [...] "Evokers" [...] which in the Persona 3 world allowed the characters to summon Personas by putting one to their heads and pulling the trigger, were likened to guns in this context. Despite not being actual weapons, Eisenbeis stated that [...] "it still looks like they are blowing their <b>brains</b> <b>out</b> — often complete with spiritual brain and skull fragments." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1905, Georgii Pobedonosets briefly {{joined the}} Potemkin mutiny. On 29 June 1905, {{the ship was}} one of eight vessels (three battleships, a cruiser and four torpedo boats) sent to capture the [...] in Odessa. The next day the fleet {{approached}} Potemkin, then suddenly retreated. She then followed them, deliberately goading the officers to order the sailors to fire on their comrades. The crew of Georgii Pobedonosets refused: [...] "We won't fire! We won't man the guns! We refuse to engage the Potemkin." [...] Her sailors cheered the rebel sailors' bravery. Dorofey Koshuba, {{a member of the}} revolutionary sailors' organisation Tsentralka, broke into the armoury, ordered Captain Ilya Guzevich to halt the ship, pushing him away when he refused. The ship halted, Guzevich pleaded with the sailors to go to Sevastopol, even offering to let the 70 revolutionaries onto Potemkin. Afanasi Matushenko, the leader of Potemkins crew, arrived with several revolutionaries who made a speech that inspired the sailors to arrest the officers. This was enough to make his second-in-command, Lieutenant Grigorkov, blow his own <b>brains</b> <b>out.</b> Apart from this, the seizure was bloodless. The sailors elected a committee (Koshuba and nine others), locked the officers in the stateroom and ripped off their epaulettes. The officers were put ashore in Odessa. It was decided that the petty officers should be put ashore too the next day. Senior Boatswain A. O. Kuzmenko became captain.|$|E
500|$|The {{rebel forces}} entered {{the city at}} six o'clock, {{accompanied}} by a mob of over 4,000 men, women, and children from Gómez Palacio Municipality, Viesca Municipality, San Pedro Municipality, Lerdo Municipality, and Matamoros Municipality. [...] They were joined by citizens of Torreón and began the sacking of the business district. [...] The mob released prisoners from jail, looted stores, and attacked people on the street. [...] They soon moved to the Chinese district. [...] Men on horses drove Chinese from the gardens back into town, dragging them by their queues and shooting or trampling those who fell. [...] Men, women, and children were killed indiscriminately when they fell {{in the way of}} the mob, and their bodies were robbed and mutilated. [...] It was reported that [...] "n one instance the head of a Chinaman was severed from his body and thrown from the window into the street. [...] In another instance a soldier took a little boy by the heels and battered his <b>brains</b> <b>out</b> against a lamp post. [...] In many instances ropes were tied to the bodies of the Chinamen and they were dragged through the streets by men on horseback. [...] In another instance a Chinaman was pulled to pieces in the street by horses hitched to his arms and legs." [...] The mob finally reached the bank, where they killed the employees and hurled their severed body parts into the streets. [...] A contemporary newspaper reported that [...] "heads of the murdered Chinese were rolled along the streets, and their bodies were tied to the tails of horses." ...|$|E

2500|$|As the Shoshone used tomahawks {{and bows}} and arrows for defense, the {{soldiers}} appeared to lose control. [...] After killing {{most of the men}} and many of the children, they raped and assaulted the women. [...] In some cases, soldiers held the feet of infants by the heel and [...] "beat their <b>brains</b> <b>out</b> on any hard substance they could find." [...] Women who resisted the soldiers were shot and killed. [...] One local resident, Alexander Stalker, noted that many soldiers pulled out their pistols and shot several Shoshone at point blank range. [...] The soldiers burned the Shoshone dwellings and supplies; they killed anyone they found in the shelters.|$|E

Fitzpatrick then said, pulling out a revolver, [...] "I will blow your <b>brains</b> <b>out</b> if you interfere." [...] His mother replied, [...] "You would not be so handy with that popgun of yours if Ned were here." [...] Dan then said, trying to trick Fitzpatrick, [...] "There is Ned coming along by the side of the house." [...] While he was pretending to look out of the window for Ned, Dan cornered Fitzpatrick, took the revolver and claimed that he had released Fitzpatrick unharmed. When Kelly was asked if Fitzpatrick tried to take liberties with his sister, Kate Kelly, he said [...] "No, that is a foolish story; if he or any other policeman tried to take liberties with my sister, Victoria would not hold him." ...|$|E

2500|$|A framing device {{portrays the}} events of the play as newscasts and {{newspaper}} headlines. The film's action sequences were reminiscent of the films of Sam Peckinpah and John Woo, and its characters wear designer clothes and (in Douglas Brode's words) [...] "a lingerie collection worthy of Madonna". As Peter Travers commented in Rolling Stone, the intention was to [...] "make Romeo and Juliet accessible to the elusive Gen-X audience without leaving the play bowdlerised and broken". Some aspects of the modernisation have been praised as effective (a newscaster speaking the prologue, for example, or the replacement of Friar John with a courier message which gets misdelivered); others have been criticised as ridiculous: including a police chief banishing Romeo for a street killing rather than ordering his arrest. Luhrmann highlighted the religious aspects of the play, surrounding his two central characters with religious icons, and staging his finale in a cathedral. That final scene was regarded by some critics as Luhrmann's masterstroke: adapting a device first used in restoration adaptations of the play, Juliet begins to wake before Romeo takes the poison, but he does not notice her movements until he has done so, then he dies aware that she has survived. The scene uses cuts and extreme close-ups to generate a tension impossible to achieve in the theatre. The mood is undermined a moment later as Juliet blows her <b>brains</b> <b>out</b> with a pistol. The role of the watch is cut completely, permitting Friar Laurence to be with Juliet and to be taken by surprise by her sudden suicide.|$|E
