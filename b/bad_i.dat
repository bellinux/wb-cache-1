500|$|During {{the summer}} before the 1953 season, McBride sold the Browns for $600,000 ($ in today's dollars), {{more than twice the}} largest sum ever paid for a {{professional}} football team. The old stockholders were McBride and his son Edward, along with minority owners including taxi business associate Dan Sherby, Brown and four others. The buyers were a group of prominent Cleveland men: Dave R. Jones, a businessman and former Cleveland Indians director, Ellis Ryan, a former Cleveland Indians president, Homer Marshman, an attorney who had founded the Cleveland Rams, Saul Silberman, owner of the horse race track later known as Thistledown Racecourse, and Ralph DeChairo, an associate of Silberman.

500|$|Hawks's {{first film}} The Road to Glory {{was based on}} a 35-page {{treatment}} that Hawks wrote and is one of only two Hawks works that are lost films. The film starred May McAvoy as a young woman who is gradually going blind and tries to spare the two men in her life from the burden of her illness. The two men are her boyfriend Rockliffe Fellowes and her father Ford Sterling, with Leslie Fenton playing the greedy rich man whom she agrees to live with in order to get away from her father and lover. The film contained religious iconography and messages that would never again be seen in a Hawks film. It was shot from December 1925 to January 1926 and premiered in April. It received good reviews from film critics. In later interviews, Hawks said, [...] "It didn't have any fun in it. It was pretty <b>bad.</b> <b>I</b> don't think anybody enjoyed it except a few critics." [...] Hawks was dissatisfied with the film after being certain that dramatic films would establish his reputation, but realized what he had done wrong when Sol Wurtzel told Hawks, [...] "Look, you've shown you can make a picture, but for God's sake, go out and make entertainment." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2005, Love {{was ordered}} into {{lockdown}} rehab by a California judge {{after a series}} of legal issues and controlled substance charges. After her release in 2006, she published a memoir, , and started recording what would become her second solo album, How Dirty Girls Get Clean, collaborating again with Perry and Smashing Pumpkins vocalist/guitarist Billy Corgan in the writing and recording. Love had written several songs, including an anti-cocaine song titled [...] "Loser Dust", during her time in rehab in 2005. She told Billboard: [...] "My hand-eye coordination was so <b>bad</b> , <b>I</b> didn't even know chords anymore. It was like my fingers were frozen. And I wasn't allowed to make noise ... I never thought I would work again." [...] Some tracks and demos from the album (initially planned for release in 2008) were leaked on the internet in 2006, and a documentary entitled The Return of Courtney Love, detailing the making of the album, aired on the British television network More4 in the fall of that year.

500|$|Several James Turner Street {{residents}} have claimed they were tricked into {{appearing in the}} series by Love Productions, who they say told them it would be about community spirit.

If they had said it was about benefits and making the street look <b>bad</b> <b>I</b> would not have taken part. They tricked us." [...] Responding to allegations the residents were duped, Nick Mirsky said that Love Productions had spent much time consulting the residents before filming began, and that process continued afterwards: [...] "Key contributors have been offered viewings of the programmes during the editing period and were given the opportunity to comment on them. Both Love and Channel 4 listened to any concerns raised, and in some cases made changes to the programme to accommodate them." [...] Dierdre Kelly, however, subsequently told ITV's This Morning that she believed the programme had provided a one-sided view of her community, and that the residents [...] "went into the show naively". Gareth Price of The Guardian suggested the show's producers [...] "adeptly edited their film in order to provoke a response from its intended audience".|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} to his success on the football field, Taylor's personal life has been marred by drug usage and controversy. When Taylor was once asked {{what he could do}} that no outside linebacker could, his answer was, [...] "Drink". However, alcohol abuse was not the largest of his substance abuse problems. After admitting to and testing positive for cocaine in 1987, he was suspended from football for 30 days in 1988 after failing a second drug test. After his second positive test he gave up drugs for five years as a third positive test would have ended his career. As he approached retirement, however, he looked forward to picking up the habit again, saying in his second autobiography, [...] "I saw blow as the only bright spot in my future." [...] After his retirement, he began abusing drugs on a regular basis. He went through drug rehab twice in 1995, only to later be arrested twice over a three-year span for attempting to buy cocaine from undercover police officers. During this period, he lived almost exclusively in his home with white sheets covering his windows and only associated with other drug users. Taylor later said, [...] "I had gotten really <b>bad.</b> <b>I</b> mean my place was almost like a crack house." [...] In his second autobiography, Taylor admitted that he had begun using drugs as early as his rookie season in the NFL. He has also stated that his first wife, Linda, mother to his three children, once had to come pick him up from a crack house during his playing career.|$|E
