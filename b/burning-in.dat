500|$|Gaseous {{mercury is}} used in mercury-vapor lamps and some [...] "neon sign" [...] type {{advertising}} signs and fluorescent lamps. Those low-pressure lamps emit very spectrally narrow lines, which are traditionally used in optical spectroscopy for calibration of spectral position. Commercial calibration lamps are sold for this purpose; reflecting a fluorescent ceiling light into a spectrometer is a common calibration practice. Gaseous mercury {{is also found in}} some electron tubes, including ignitrons, thyratrons, and mercury arc rectifiers. It is also used in specialist medical care lamps for skin tanning and disinfection. Gaseous mercury is added to cold cathode argon-filled lamps to increase the ionization and electrical conductivity. An argon-filled lamp without mercury will have dull spots and will fail to light correctly. Lighting containing mercury can be bombarded/oven pumped only once. When added to neon filled tubes the light produced will be inconsistent red/blue spots until the initial <b>burning-in</b> process is completed; eventually it will light a consistent dull off-blue color.|$|E
50|$|The {{luminance}} {{range of a}} scene maps to the focal-plane illuminance and exposure in a camera, not necessarily directly proportionally, as when a graduated neutral density filter is used to reduce the exposure range to less than the scene {{luminance range}}. The film responds nonlinearly to the exposure, as characterized by the film's characteristic curve, or Hurter-Driffield curve; this plot of optical density of the developed negative versus the logarithm of the exposure (also called a D-logE curve) has central straight section whose slope is called the gamma of the film. The gamma can be controlled by choosing different films, or by varying the development time or temperature. Similarly, the light transmitted by the negative exposed a photographic paper and interacts with the characteristic curve of the paper to give an overall tone reproduction curve. The exposure of the paper is sometimes modified in the darkroom by dodging and/or <b>burning-in,</b> further complicating the overall tone reproduction, usually helping to map a wider dynamic range from a negative onto a narrower print reflectance range.|$|E

The methods and materials which are applied in antistick coatings and in the molding sand mixtures for prevention of defect formation is also given in the paper. </p...|$|E
40|$|A {{container}} {{has been}} developed for handling, testing, <b>burning-in,</b> and storing discrete microelectronic components without removal from the protective package. The package was designed to accommodate the leadless inverted device and other carrier-mounted active devices and chip-type discrete resistors and capacitors. Before the indicated development, components were handled and tested in various ways, some of which resulted in damage or contamination. The basic design of the container utilizes precision machined printed circuit boards and chemically milled (photoetched) contact springs. Included in this design for protection is an O-ring-sealed cover. Methods of fabrication and limitations of the current hardware are presented. Current applications of and possible extensions to the technology are discussed...|$|E
40|$|An artist {{working with}} {{traditional}} materials will {{use them in}} accepted ways or, through experimenta tion, will discover new methods. With perception these new methods may be brought to unique and inno vative statement. This paper provides a short history of the ancient technique of painting known as encaustic? it contains a brief summary of certain contemporary artists 2 ̆ 7 uses of encaustic; and, finally, it gives this writer 2 ̆ 7 s own contribution of a new concept for painting with encaustic. When the artist utilizes a more intensive <b>burning-in</b> of the colors, {{it is possible for}} encaustic to project a totally unique and independent image among the fine art techniques...|$|E
40|$|The {{scientific}} and technological bases of a resistance paste system on aluminium nitride as the substrate have been developed including the compatible covering and conductivity pastes. Pb-free, RuO_ 2 -based pastes have been optimized decreasing the chemical reactivity of the system AlN + RuO_ 2 during the <b>burning-in</b> process by non-crystallizing glasses of modified viscosity-temperature characteristics. The obtained performance parameters are {{comparable to those of}} the corresponding Al_ 2 O_ 3 substrate system. PbO-free modified glasses have been developed for the Ag/Pd-based conductivity paste. The new paste system has been successfully tested on technical AlN substrates (ANCeram, Hoechst).

40|$|The growing {{acceptance}} of flip chip technology in assembly and manufacturing {{of a broad}} scope of products is facing similar issues, as wirebonding for COB and MCM's before. Repair issues due to intrinsically defective dies, having passed standard electrical tests but no burn-in, tend to challenge the cost and performance benefits of bare die attach. Testing and <b>burning-in</b> of bare, unpackaged dies (yielding so called "Known Good Dies") requires sophisticated test equipment while providing only low throughput. Over the last decade, a number of wafer level bum in concepts have evolved, {{the majority of them}} focusing on IC's dedicated for wirebond use. Only few of them found their way into production so far. Flip Chip now requires a different approach, as the dies are not to be tested before, but after bumping. Test equipment and - processes do not lend themselves readily to this task. This paper presents a novel concept for wafer level burn in dedicated for the special need s of flip chips. Using a reusable burn-in substrate, only one step is needed to realize the electrical contacts for the burn in for wafers and the bumps for the flip chip. The technology developed is described and the identified issues are explained. Reliability tests of the burnt-in dice are given and compared to flip chips manufactured with standard bumping methods...|$|E
