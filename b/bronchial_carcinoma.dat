40|$|Twenty one {{chromium}} containing {{materials were}} examined for carcinogenic activity in a two year study using an intrabronchial pellet implantation system whereby pellets loaded with test material were surgically implanted {{into the lower}} left bronchus of rats. The principal aim {{of the study was}} to extend our knowledge of the carcinogenic potential of chromium compounds and, in particular, chromates (Cr 6 +). A statistically significant incidence of treatment related lung tumours was found with some sparingly soluble chromate materials. All tumours were large keratinizing squamous carcinomas of the left lung, except for a single left lung adenocarcinoma and two left lung anaplastic <b>carcinomas.</b> No <b>bronchial</b> <b>carcinomas</b> (0 / 100) were seen in the negative control group (blank pellet loaded with cholesterol), whereas <b>bronchial</b> <b>carcinomas</b> (22 / 48 and 25 / 100) occurred in the two positive control groups which received pellets loaded with 20 -methylcholanthrene and calcium chromate respectively. Among the 20 test materials, only three groups gave statistically significant numbers of <b>bronchial</b> <b>carcinomas.</b> Two of these were groups receiving different samples of strontium chromate which gave 43 / 99 and 62 / 99 tumours.

40|$|Abstract Background We prospectively {{reviewed}} response rates, local control, {{and side}} effects after non-fractionated stereotactic high single-dose body radiation therapy for lung tumors. Methods Fifty-eight patients underwent radiosurgery involving single-dose irradiation. With 25 patients, 31 metastases {{in the lungs}} were irradiated; with each of 33 patients, stage I {{non-small cell lung cancer}} (NSCLC) was subject to irradiation. The standard dose prescribed to the isocenter was 30 Gy with an axial safety margin of 10 mm and a longitudinal safety margin of 15 mm. The planning target volume (PTV) was defined using three CT scans with reference to the phases of respiration so that the movement span of the clinical target volume (CTV) was enclosed. Results The volume of the metastases (CTV) varied from 2. 8 to 55. 8 cm 3 (median: 6. 0 cm 3) and the PTV varied from 12. 2 to 184. 0 cm 3 (median: 45. 0 cm 3). The metastases ranged from 0. 7 to 4. 5 cm in largest diameter. The volume of the <b>bronchial</b> <b>carcinomas</b> varied from 4. 2 to 125. 4 cm 3 (median: 17. 5 cm 3) and the PTV from 15. 6 to 387. 3 cm 3 (median: 99. 8 cm 3). The <b>bronchial</b> <b>carcinomas</b> ranged from 1. 7 to 10 cm in largest diameter. Follow-up periods varied from 6. 8 to 63 months (median: 22 months for metastases and 18 months for NSCLC). Local control was achieved with 94 % of NSCLC and 87 % of metastases. No serious symptomatic side effects were observed. According to the Kaplan-Meier method the overall survival probability rates of patients with lung metastases were as follows: 1 year: 97 %, 2 years: 73 %, 3 years: 42 %, 4 years: 42 %, 5 years: 42 % (median survival: 26 months); of those with NSCLC: 1 year: 83 %, 2 years: 63 %, 3 years: 53 %, 4 years: 39 %: (median survival: 20. 4 months). Conclusion Non-fractionated single-dose irradiation of metastases in the lungs or of small, peripheral <b>bronchial</b> <b>carcinomas</b> is an effective and safe form of local treatment and might become a viable alternative to invasive techniques. </p...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a {{technique}} for producing localised tissue necrosis with light after prior administration of a photosensitising drug. There is some selectivity of uptake of photosensitisers in malignant tissue, although this is difficult to exploit. Full thickness necrosis in normal and neoplastic colon heals without perforation {{because of a lack}} of effect on collagen, making local cure a possibility. The experiments described here aim to establish whether these conclusions are also valid for bronchial tumours. METHODS [...] In pharmacokinetic studies normal rats were given 5 mg/kg of the photosensitiser aluminium sulphonated phthalocyanine (A 1 SPc) intravenously and killed up to one month later. The distribution of A 1 SPc in the trachea was measured by chemical extraction and fluorescence microscopy. In subsequent experiments sensitised animals were treated with light delivered to the tracheal mucosa through a thin flexible fibre and the resultant lesions were studied for their size, mechanical strength, and healing. A series of resected human <b>bronchial</b> <b>carcinomas</b> were examined histologically for their collagen content. RESULTS [...] The tracheal concentration of A 1 SPc in normal rats was maximum 1 - 20 hours after administration. Fluorescence microscopy revealed that most was in the perichondrium and submucosal stroma, with little in the cartilage. Light exposure showed necrosis of the soft tissues which healed by regeneration, but no effect on cartilage and no reduction in the mechanical strength of the trachea at any stage. Histological examination of resected human <b>bronchial</b> <b>carcinomas</b> showed more collagen in the tumour areas than would be found in normal regions. CONCLUSIONS [...] PDT leads to necrosis of the soft tissues of the normal trachea but there is complete healing by regeneration, no risk of perforation (due to collagen preservation), and no effect on cartilage. Human <b>bronchial</b> <b>carcinomas</b> apparently contain more collagen than normal bronchi which may give protection against perforation following necrosis induced by PDT. PDT may have a role in eradicating small volumes of tumour tissue in situ and could be valuable for treating (1) small carcinomas in patients unfit for resection, (2) tumour remaining after surgical resection, (3) stump recurrences, or (4) to prolong palliation of tumours after debulking with the NdYAG laser...|$|R

40|$|The {{results of}} bronchography in 96 {{consecutive}} patients investigated for haemoptysis at Papworth Hospital from 1975 to 1983 were reviewed. None {{of the patients}} {{included in this study}} gave a history suggestive of bronchiectasis and neither chest radiography nor fibreoptic bronchoscopy had shown a cause for the bleeding. Bronchography was performed through the fibreoptic bronchoscope and all included in the study showed both lungs adequately. The chest radiographic appearances were compared with the bronchographic findings. Seven of 12 patients with appearances suggesting old fibrosis showed bronchiectasis, as did eight of 10 with radiographic appearances suggestive of bronchiectasis. Eleven out of 74 patients with normal chest radiographs, however, also showed bronchiectasis. This group of 11 was compared with the other 63 but no clinical feature was found to be significantly associated with the presence of bronchiectasis. Although bronchography is now rarely used in the investigation of haemoptysis, this high yield (15 %) of bronchiectasis indicates that its use should be reappraised. Follow up of the patients indicated that bronchography was not reliable at diagnosing peripheral <b>bronchial</b> <b>carcinomas,</b> which became evident later in two cases, and that asthma was present in 15 (24 %) of the 63 patients with both normal chest radiographs and normal bronchograms...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop a {{protocol}} suitable for membrane protein extraction from limited starting material and to identify appropriate conditions for two-dimensional (2 -D) gel electrophoresis. We used A 549 cells, a human alveolar type II cell line, and evaluated three protein extraction methods based on different separation principles, namely protein solubility, detergent-based and density-based organelle separation. Detergent-based extraction achieved the highest yield with 14. 64 % +/- 2. 35 membrane proteins but sequential extraction with 7. 35 % +/- 0. 78 yield and centrifugal extraction with 4. 1 % +/- 0. 54 yield produced the purest fractionation of membrane proteins. Only the sequential and the detergent-based extraction proved suitable for small volumes of starting material. We identified annexin I + II, electron transfer flavoprotein beta-chain, H(+) -transporting ATP synthase, mitofilin and protein disulfide isomerase A 3 as membrane and cytokeratin 8 + 18, actin and others as soluble proteins using matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) analysis and started to map the A 549 cell proteome. Our data suggest that membrane proteins can be extracted efficiently from small samples using a simple sequential protein extraction method.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{outgrowth}} of new vessels – angiogenesis – in the tumour mass {{is considered to}} be a limiting factor of tumour growth. To inhibit the matrix lysis that is part of the tumour angiogenesis, we employed the chimeric protein mhATF-BPTI, composed of the receptor binding part of the urokinase (ATF) linked to an inhibitor of plasmin (BPTI). Methods For delivery, recombinant adenovirus encoding the transgene of interest was injected intravenously or locally into the tumour. The anti tumour effect of this compound was compared to that of human endostatin and of mhATF alone in two different rat <b>bronchial</b> <b>carcinomas</b> growing either as subcutaneous implants or as metastases. Results Significant inhibition of the tumour growth and decrease of the number of lung metastasis was achieved when the concentration of mhATF-BPTI at the tumour site was above 400 of ng / g tissue. This concentration could be achieved via production by the liver, only if permissive to the recombinant adenovirus. When the tumour cells could be transduced, local delivery of the vector was enough to obtain a response. In the case of metastasis, the capacity of the lung tissue to concentrate the encoded protein was essential to reach the required therapeutic levels. Further, endostatin or mhATF could not reproduce the effects of mhATF-BPTI, at similar concentrations (mhATF) and even at 10 -fold higher concentration (endostatin). Conclusion The ATF-BPTI was shown to inhibit tumour growth of different rat lung tumours when critical concentration was reached. In these tumour models, endostatin or ATF induce almost no tumour response. </p...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Although neuroendocrine {{differentiation}} occurs quite commonly in non-small cell bronchial malignancies, its biological {{significance and}} implications for management remain uncertain. Determining these facts requires its recognition early, ideally at diagnosis, which is usually made on tissue from bronchoscopy, but the best means of its detection in such material is unclear. A prospective comparative study was performed of 10 commercially available antisera {{to a series of}} markers of neuroendocrine differentiation, to test their efficacy when applied to fibreoptic bronchoscopy biopsy specimens. METHODS [...] Expression of chromogranin A, synaptophysin, neurone-specific enolase, protein gene product 9. 5, the BB isoenzyme of creatine kinase, gastrin releasing peptide, adrenocorticotrophic hormone, calcitonin, calcitonin gene related peptide, and leucine enkephalin was sought by immunolabelling of bronchoscopic biopsy tissue from 83 primary <b>bronchial</b> <b>carcinomas,</b> 22 of them of small cell type. RESULTS [...] Only synaptophysin and chromogranin were sensitive and specific enough for neuroendocrine differentiation to discriminate between small cell and non-small cell lesions, whereas protein gene product 9. 5 and creatine kinase were neither particularly sensitive nor specific and neurone-specific enolase actually labelled more non-small cell tumours than small cell lesions. Of the five secretory products sought, only gastrin releasing peptide was detectable in just one tumour. Three squamous and two morphologically undifferentiated tumours immunolabelled for synaptophysin and chromogranin, almost certainly indicating neuroendocrine differentiation in the absence of small cell morphology.

40|$|Abstract Background Pleural effusions can {{be caused}} by highly {{different}} underlying diseases and are characterized by complex interactions of various local and circulating cells as well as numerous soluble parameters like interleukins (IL). Knowledge of this complex network can be helpful {{in order to make the}} differential diagnosis in known malignant pleural effusions and understand the underlying immunochemistry of each disease or condition. Methods We investigated immunoreactive concentrations of Interleukin 10 (IL- 10) and Interleukin 17 (IL- 17) in malignant pleural effusions and peripheral blood from patients with <b>bronchial</b> <b>carcinomas</b> and other carcinomas, excluding other conditions such as congestive heart failure (CHF) and pneumonias in twenty four (24) patients (9 men/ 15 women), 37 - 74 years (mean: 61) with already diagnosed malignant pleural effusions applying the ELISA method. Results The SPSS 15 program for Windows was used. Quantitative analysis showed high concentrations of IL- 10 and IL- 17 in pleural fluid and blood. Even though IL- 17 levels -both blood and pleural- were lower than IL- 10 ’s, statistical correlation between blood and pleural concentations was proven, confirming once more the systematic action of these cytokines. At the same time high IL- 17 levels in malignant effusions shows maybe a new perspective in understanding the pathophysiology of malignant pleural effusions. Conclusions Our results confirm the pathogenetic role of these cytokines in malignant pleural effusions combining for the first time a pro- and an anti- inflammatory cytokine. The observation that IL- 17 is elevated in malignant pleural effusions may give a new meaning in Virchow’s remarks 100 years ago. Larger number of patients is needed to confirm our hypothesis. </p...|$|R
