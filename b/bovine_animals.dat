Two piles of about 30 tons have been prepared with different composition.

The compost cycle (90 days) has been monitored during the two main phases (active and curing phase) measuring temperature, pH, moisture, oxygen and C/N ratio. At the end of the cycle, the quality of compost has been evaluated by doing, both on manure and plant wastes, the following analyses : PH, Ashes, EC, Salts, Total Organic Carbon, Total nitrogen (N), C/N ratio, total Phosphorous (p), total Potassium, level of heavy metals in the two piles.

60|$|In all {{the wild}} species of goats and sheep the horns are larger {{in the male}} than in the female, and are {{sometimes}} quite absent in the latter.[299] In several domestic breeds of the sheep and goat, the males alone are furnished with horns; {{and it is a}} significant fact, that in one such breed of sheep on the Guinea coast, the horns are not developed, as Mr. Winwood Reade informs me, in the castrated male; so that they are affected in this respect like the horns of stags. In some breeds, as in that of N. Wales, in which both sexes are properly horned, the ewes are very liable to be hornless. In these same sheep, as I have been informed by a trustworthy witness who purposely inspected a flock during the lambing-season, the horns at birth are generally more fully developed in the male than in the female. With the adult musk-ox (Ovibos moschatus) the horns of the male are larger than those of the female, and in the latter the bases do not touch.[300] In regard to ordinary cattle Mr. Blyth remarks: “In most of the wild <b>bovine</b> <b>animals</b> the horns are both longer and thicker in the bull than in the cow, and in the cow-banteng (Bos sondaicus) the horns are remarkably small, and inclined much backwards. In the domestic races of cattle, both of the humped and humpless types, the horns are short and thick in the bull, longer and more slender in the cow and ox; and in the Indian buffalo, they are shorter and thicker in the bull, longer and more slender in the cow. In the wild gaour (B. gaurus) the horns are mostly both longer and thicker in the bull than in the cow.”[301] Hence with most sheath-horned ruminants the horns of the male are either longer or stronger than those of the female. With the Rhinoceros simus, as I may here add, the horns of the female are generally longer but less powerful than in the male; and in some other species of rhinoceros they are said to be shorter in the female.[302] From these various facts we may conclude that horns of all kinds, even when they are equally developed in both sexes, were primarily acquired by the males in order to conquer other males, and have been transferred more or less completely to the female, in relation to the force of the equal form of inheritance.|$|E

As the name suggests, it prefers <b>bovine</b> <b>animals</b> {{as the source of}} blood, although it may bite other kind of mammals as well. The insect is relatively large for a horse-fly, adults usually being 25-30 mm long. Like most other horseflies, its compound eyes are very colorful with stripe-like patterns. Its body and wings are mostly colored brownish gray. It is quite fast and an able flier, being capable of evading most attempts to swat it with ease. It bites humans infrequently, because of its preference of <b>bovine</b> <b>animals.</b> This loud-buzzing horse-fly can be a nuisance, as it circles around its target and occasionally lands to deliver a bite (in the case of humans, the fly usually takes off again instead). However, to humans it is considerably less harmful than deer flies (Chrysops), which bite much more vigorously.|$|E

40|$|Farm, cattle {{group and}} {{individual}} bovine {{risk factors for}} bovine tuberculosis (bTB) in cattle herds in the South West of England were explored. A cohort study using 148 well characterised cattle herds was conducted in SW England 2001 - 2004. The study {{was set up in}} areas affected by foot-and-mouth disease in 2001 and all farms were taking part in the Randomised Badger Culling Trial (RBCT). The use of a standard questionnaire and national data records from the skin intradermal cervical comparative tuberculin test (SICCT) and from the British Cattle Movement Service (BCMS) databases were combined. The two main statistical techniques used were survival analysis and multilevel logistic regression with random effects. Associations with the risk of herd breakdown with bTB were explored using survival analysis. The main factors associated with disclosure of reactor cattle were the purchase of cattle from markets and the storage of slurry and manure in close containment. In the investigation of the risk of an individual <b>bovine</b> <b>animal</b> becoming a reactor using multilevel logistic regression with random effects analysis, explanatory variables at herd, individual cattle and test levels, were explored. The potential exposure to reactor cattle in previous tests was the most significant finding as a risk for a <b>bovine</b> <b>animal</b> reacting at a current test. Only 9 / 19, 027 cattle became reactors if they had not been exposed to a reactor animal previously. When the risk of an animal group having at least one reactor disclosed in the group was investigated using the location of the animal groups within the farm by monthly periods, the risk increased with the number of cattle in the groups when these were housed and with the presence of badgers in the fields when they were grazing. This thesis has provided a deep investigation into the risk factors that can affect the introduction and persistence of infection with M. bovis in cattle herds, and the importance that cattle play in these factors has been highlighted.

Recently, a dichotomy between IL- 12 and IL- 10 regarding progression of a variety diseases has emerged. IL- 12 activates type 1 cytokine production and has an antagonistic effect on type 2 cytokines. Here, by using quantitative competitive PCR, we show that peripheral blood mononuclear cells from <b>bovine</b> leukemia virus-infected <b>animals</b> in the alymphocytotic stage of disease express an increased amount of IL- 12 p 40 mRNA.

Interestingly, IL- 12 p 40 mRNA was also detected in tumor-bearing animals. IL- 12 p 40 expression occurred only in monocytes/macrophages, not B or T lymphocytes.
