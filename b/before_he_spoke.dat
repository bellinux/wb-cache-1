25|$|Hersey {{was born}} in Tientsin, China, the son of Grace Baird and Roscoe Hersey, Protestant missionaries for the Young Men's Christian Association in Tientsin. Hersey learned to speak Chinese <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> English; Hersey's novel, The Call (1985), {{is based on the}} lives of his parents and several other missionaries of their generation. John Hersey was a {{descendant}} of William Hersey (or Hercy, as the family name was then spelled) of Reading, Berkshire, England. William Hersey {{was one of the first}} settlers of Hingham, Massachusetts in 1635.|$|E
25|$|The Duke de Broglie was {{carefully}} preparing {{a way to}} bring down Thiers. He modified the rules of the Assembly so that the President had the power to veto laws passed by the Assembly, but also requiring that the President ask permission from the head of the Assembly <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> to the body. On 2 April, the moderate republican president of the Assembly, Jules Grévy, was forced to resign by a personal scandal and was replaced by a deputy of the center-right, Buffet, who supported a constitutional monarchy. Soon afterwards, on 27 April, an election was held in Paris to fill a vacant seat in the Assembly. Both the candidate of the monarchists and the moderate republican candidate supported by Thiers was defeated by a more radical republican named Barodet, who was supported by Leon Gambetta and the left wing of the republicans. Further elections were held on 11 May: five of the six open seats were won by republicans. The right wing of the Assembly became alarmed that the country was moving too far to the left and {{decided it was time to}} get rid of Thiers.|$|E
25|$|Novak’s wife, Geraldine, began regular churchgoing in {{the early}} 1990s and {{eventually}} settled on St Patrick’s Catholic Church, Washington, D.C. One day she persuaded Novak, who had not attended religious services for nearly 30 years, to join her at Mass. The celebrant was Fr. Peter Vaghi, whom he had known before Vaghi switched from politics to the priesthood. Novak then started to go to Mass regularly and decided to convert a few years later. According to Novak, the turning point came when he visited Syracuse University to lecture. <b>Before</b> <b>he</b> <b>spoke,</b> he was seated at a dinner table near a female student who wore a cross necklace. Novak {{asked her if she}} was Catholic and she asked him the same. Novak said he had been going to Mass each Sunday for the last four years, but had not converted. “Mr Novak,” the young woman replied, “life is short, but eternity is forever.” That brief sentence chilled Novak, who felt the student had channeled the Holy Spirit. When he got home and told Geraldine, they {{decided it was time to}} convert. In May 1998 Novak was received into the Roman Catholic Church at the age of 67 and became a Traditionalist Catholic. Geraldine was already a Catholic. Al Hunt, Judy Woodruff, Fred Barnes, Margaret Carlson, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Henry Hyde, and Rick Santorum attended Novak’s baptism, with some of them openly crying.|$|E

Glenn's business partner was Henri Landwirth, a Holocaust survivor who became his best friend. He remembered learning about Landwirth's background: [...] "Henri doesn't talk about it much. It was years <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> about it with me and then only because of an accident. We were down in Florida during the space program. Everyone was wearing short-sleeved Ban-Lon shirtseveryone but Henri. Then one day I saw Henri at the pool and noticed the number on his arm. I told Henri {{that if it were}} me I'd wear that number like a medal with a spotlight on it." ...|$|E
500|$|While Nelson was {{apparently}} convinced that Bundy's concern was genuine, most biographers, researchers, and other observers {{have concluded that}} his sudden condemnation of pornography was one last manipulative attempt to shift blame by catering to Dobson's agenda as a longtime pornography critic. He told Dobson that [...] "true crime" [...] detective magazines had [...] "corrupted" [...] him and [...] "fueled [...] fantasies ... {{to the point of}} becoming a serial killer"; yet in a 1977 letter to Ann Rule, he wrote, [...] "Who in the world reads these publications? ... I have never purchased such a magazine, and [...] two or three occasions have I ever picked one up." [...] He told Michaud and Aynsworth in 1980, and Hagmaier the night <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> to Dobson, that pornography played a negligible role in his development as a serial killer. [...] "The problem wasn't pornography", wrote Dekle. [...] "The problem was Bundy." [...] "I wish I could believe that his motives were altruistic," [...] wrote Rule. [...] "But all I can see in that Dobson tape is another Ted Bundy manipulation of our minds. The effect of the tape is to place, once again, the onus of his crimes, not on himself, but on us." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{official}} apologies {{are widely}} viewed as inadequate or only a symbolic exchange {{by many of the}} survivors of such crimes or the families of dead victims. On October 2006, while Prime Minister Shinzo Abe expressed an apology for the damage caused by its colonial rule and aggression, more than 80 Japanese lawmakers from his ruling party LDP paid visits to the Yasukuni Shrine. Many people aggrieved by Japanese war crimes also maintain that no apology has been issued for particular acts or that the Japanese government has merely expressed [...] "regret" [...] or [...] "remorse". On 2 March 2007, the issue was raised again by Japanese prime minister Shinzō Abe, in which he denied that the military had forced women into sexual slavery during World War II. He stated, [...] "The fact is, {{there is no evidence to}} prove there was coercion." [...] <b>Before</b> <b>he</b> <b>spoke,</b> a group of Liberal Democratic Party lawmakers also sought to revise the Kono Statement. This provoked negative reaction from Asian and Western countries.|$|E
2500|$|In 2006, after a {{visit to}} a United Methodist Church in Highland Park, Texas, Keillor created a local {{controversy}} with his remarks about the event, including the rhetorical suggestion of a connection between event participants and supporters of torture and a statement creating an impression of political intimidation: [...] "I walked in, was met by two burly security men ... and within 10 minutes was told by three people that this was the Bushes' church {{and that it would be}} better if I didn't talk about politics." [...] In response, the lecture series coordinator said the two “burly security men” were a local policeman and the church’s own security supervisor, both present because the agreement with Keillor‘s publisher specified that the venue provide security. In addition the coordinator said Mr. Keillor arrived at the church, declined an introduction and took the stage without an opportunity to mingle with the audience, and so did not know when these warnings might have been dispensed. The publicist concurred, saying that Keillor did not have contact with any church members or people in the audience <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>spoke.</b> Supposedly, before Keillor's remarks, participants in the event had considered the visit to have been cordial and warm. Asked to respond, Keillor stuck to his story, describing the people who advised him not to discuss politics and saying that he did not have security guards at other stops on the tour.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1950s and 1960s, Weber was {{a popular}} banquet speaker renowned for his [...] "polysyllabic fluency," [...] "mind--boggling after-dinner speeches," [...] and his often humorous talks {{about the history of}} Michigan football. It was noted that he would [...] "regale with dubious rhetoric" [...] audiences before whom he would thunderously and whimsically [...] "expatiate upon" [...] Michigan's storied history. Another {{described}} Weber's unusual speaking style this way: [...] "He still sounds like an educated foghorn, and still flips that king's English around in a manner to amaze and apall old Noah Webster." [...] Praising a piledriver spotted among a current crop of Wolverines, the coach would exclaim, [...] "When he hits 'em, generations yet unborn feel the shock of the impact!" [...] Jim Brandstatter wrote in his book Tales from Michigan Stadium that Weber was still a regular visitor at the football offices when he enrolled in 1968. He recalled Weber as a master story teller and a favorite among the students at pep rallies: “Who can forget Wally Weber rolling his pant legs up to his knees as the student body roared <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> so eloquently about his beloved Michigan?” Weber also held positions in the 1960s and early 1970s in alumni relations and the physical education department. Weber also provided color commentary on WPAG radio's broadcasts of Michigan football games with Bob Ufer for several years. He retired in 1972 {{at the same time as}} Oosterbaan. With the exception of four years at Benton Harbor, Weber had been a student or employee of U-M for 48 years at the time of his retirement.|$|E

60|$|The American gentleman named Pym {{seemed to}} be turning and on the move in the same direction; but <b>before</b> <b>he</b> started <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> to Rosamund with a flash of that guileless tact which {{redeemed}} much of his childish vanity, and with something of that spontaneous poetry which made it difficult, pedantic as he was, to call him a pedant.|$|R
