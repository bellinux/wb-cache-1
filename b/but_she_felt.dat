Alexandra's pleasant manners made her win many sympathies. She was well liked by her two sisters-in-law Maria Alexandrovna and Alexandra Iosifovna. However, at the Russian court, Alexandra Petrovna's involvement in philanthropy was considered as excessive and she was regarded as a holy fool.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1887, Addams read in a {{magazine}} about the new idea of starting a settlement house. She decided to visit the world's first, Toynbee Hall, in London. She and several friends, including Ellen Gates Starr, traveled in Europe from December 1887 through {{the summer of}} 1888. After watching a bullfight in Madrid, fascinated by what she saw as an exotic tradition, Addams condemned this fascination and her inability to feel outraged at {{the suffering of the}} horses and bulls. At first, Addams told no one about her dream to start a settlement house; <b>but,</b> <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> increasingly guilty for not acting on her dream. Believing that sharing her dream might help her to act on it, she told Ellen Gates Starr. Starr loved the idea and agreed to join Addams in starting a settlement house.|$|E
25|$|In 1905, O'Keeffe {{began her}} serious formal art {{training}} at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and then the Art Students League of New York, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> constrained by her lessons that focused on recreating or copying what was in nature. In 1908, unable to fund further education, she worked for two years as a commercial illustrator, and then spent seven years between 1911 and 1918 teaching in Virginia, Texas, and South Carolina. During that time, she studied art during the summers between 1912 and 1914 and {{was introduced to the}} principles and philosophies of Arthur Wesley Dow, who espoused created works of art based upon personal style, design, and interpretation of subjects, rather than trying to copy or represent them. This caused a major change in the way she felt about and approached art, as seen in the beginning stages of her watercolors from her studies at the University of Virginia and more dramatically in the charcoal drawings that she produced in 1915 that led to total abstraction. Alfred Stieglitz, an art dealer and photographer, held an exhibit of her works in 1916. Over the next couple of years, she taught and continued her studies at the Teachers College, Columbia University.|$|E

During the writing stage, Williams was under {{pressure}} to ensure Phantasmagoria was a commercial success for Sierra. She also faced concerns from her husband Ken Williams, the company president and co-founder of Sierra, who wanted the company {{to focus more on}} lower-cost, combat-oriented animated games, and was also concerned about the level of violence in Phantasmagoria. Williams said she knew the rape scene in particular would be controversial, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> it was essential to the plot because it was a turning point that made Adrienne realize something was deeply wrong with Don.

500|$|Metacritic {{assigned}} a score of 28 out of 100 based on aggregate of 17 reviews, indicating [...] "generally unfavorable reviews". The Futon Critic's Brian Ford Sullivan praised Vieluf as the standout despite his limited role, but felt {{the execution of the}} matchmaking premise was inferior to that done in the 2005 film Hitch. The series was described as having [...] "a quirky vibe, personable cast and snappy writing" [...] by Varietys Laura Fries, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> the storylines and characters required more original material. Although they commended the show for its multi-ethnic cast, Jon Bonné and Gael Fashingbauer Cooper of Today wrote that it [...] "struggles to salvage some screechingly bad jokes". Paul Brownfield of the Los Angeles Times criticized the series for being [...] "unintentionally unfunny", comparing it to the fictional sitcom Room and Bored featured in the HBO comedy-drama The Comeback. The Chicago Tribunes Maureen Ryan called the series a [...] "grating comedy... destined to be a footnote in history as the show that premiered after Everybody Hates Chris, and most likely faded shortly thereafter".|$|E
500|$|She {{competed with}} five other actresses for the part, but she {{believed}} that the role {{was meant to be}} hers, as Naomi is both her grandmother's name and her middle name. O'Rielly also said, [...] "When I got the scripts, I really loved how Naomi works on lots of levels at all times. That is extremely satisfying to play as an actor." [...] A week after the second audition, O'Reilly's agent informed her that she had won the role. She and her husband then relocated to Melbourne from Sydney to be closer to the studios. O'Reilly was initially offered a three year contract, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> that was too long and suggested an 18 month contract instead, which produces agreed to. O'Reilly began filming her first scenes in November 2013 and she made her screen debut as Naomi on 25 March 2014. In July, O'Reilly took two months off from filming in order to perform her one-woman show at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. The break was agreed upon when O'Reilly got the part and she was thankful to the producers for giving her the time off.|$|E

500|$|In July 1938, deHavilland {{began dating}} {{business}} tycoon, aviator, and filmmaker Howard Hughes, {{who had just}} completed his record-setting flight {{around the world in}} 91 hours. In addition to escorting her about town, he gave the actress her first flying lessons. She later said, [...] "He was a rather shy man ... and yet, in a whole community where the men every day played heroes on the screen and didn't do anything heroic in life, here was this man who was a real hero." [...] In December 1939, she began a romantic relationship with actor James Stewart. At the request of Irene Mayer Selznick, the actor's agent asked Stewart to escort deHavilland to the New York premiere of Gone with the Wind at the Astor Theater on December 19, 1939. Over the next few days, Stewart took her to the theater several times and to the 21 Club. They continued to see each other back in Los Angeles, where Stewart provided occasional flying lessons and romance. According to deHavilland, Stewart proposed marriage to her in 1940, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> that he was not ready to settle down. Their relationship ended in late 1941 when deHavilland began a romantic relationship with film director John Huston while making In This Our Life.

[...] Metacritic gave the show a score of 54 out of 100, based on reviews from 24 critics, indicating [...] "mixed or average reviews". [...] TV Guides Matt Roush felt that the series could become a hit similar to Bones and Castle. [...] Other critics felt that the series had issues. [...] Zap2it.com's Sarah Huggins liked the concept for the series and Gruffudd's performance, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> that the first two episodes were inconsistent [...] "in tone and story". [...] Both Varietys Brian Lowery [...] and Adweeks Sam Thielman believed that Forever [...] could not last as it faced CBS's Person of Interest in the 10 p.m. timeslot and as Forevers lead-in, Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., had dropped in the ratings during its first season. [...] Lowery also believed {{that the lack of}} answers about Henry's immortality could not sustain the series. [...] The Hollywood Reporters Tim Goodman concurred, feeling that the lack of answers about Henry's immortality could pose problems for viewers. [...] Still others felt that the series was a derivative of other series. [...] Brian Tallerico of RogerEbert.com felt that the series was a derivative of Sherlock Holmes. [...] Although Hillary Busis of Entertainment Weekly felt that Forever was a derivative of other procedurals, she stated that the show was [...] "breezy and entertaining and reasonably clever, at least when its Sherlock Scanning isn't out of control" [...] due to the performances of Gruffudd, de la Garza, and Hirsch and due to Miller's conceptualization of the series.|$|E

She said that [...] "As time went on, you saw that Ezri was intelligent, that she was endearing and a good person.

[...] She praised specific episodes which evolved the character, such as [...] "The Siege of AR-558" [...] which required Ezri to draw upon Dax's past experiences, as otherwise she would have been completely out of her element. De Boer also enjoyed [...] "" [...] as the episode showed the change in Ezri from before she was joined with the Dax symbiont, and she thought that the events portrayed in [...] "" [...] were [...] "fascinating". As she approached the end of Deep Space Nine, de Boer addressed the rumors of her joining , saying that [...] "My first instinct would be to say no.

Cleveland went on to appear in about two-thirds of the episodes, as well as in all of the Python films, and in most of their stage shows, as well. Her common portrayal as the stereotypical [...] "blonde bimbo" [...] eventually earned her the sobriquet [...] "Carol Cleavage" [...] from the other Pythons, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> that the variety of her roles should not be described in such a pejorative way.|$|E
