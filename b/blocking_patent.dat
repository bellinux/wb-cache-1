The resulting effect on long-run consumption can be substantial because the harmful distortionary effects are relatively insignificant.

From an analysis of the historical records, it is clear that in most instances, the legal system took far too long to deal with the contested issues. In the interim, firms that had achieved dominant positions through innovation often embraced new technologies slowly, sometimes pursuing an explicit "fast second" strategy [...] that is, waiting to innovate until their positions were threatened by outsiders.

40|$|This study {{develops}} a Schumpeterian growth model {{to analyze the}} effects of different patent instruments on innovation. We first analyze patent breadth that captures the traditional positive effect of patent rights on innovation. Then, we consider a profit-division rule between entrants and incumbents. Given the division of profit, increasing the share of profit assigned to incumbents reduces entrants' incentives for innovation. This aspect of <b>blocking</b> <b>patents</b> captures the recently proposed negative effect of patent rights on innovation. Finally, <b>blocking</b> <b>patents</b> generate a non-monotonic effect on innovation when the step size of innovation is endogenous due to a novel escape-infringement effect.

Calibrating the model and simulating the transition dynamics, we find that strengthening the effect of <b>blocking</b> <b>patents</b> stifles vertical innovation and decreases economic growth but increases social welfare due to an increase in horizontal innovation. In light of this finding, we argue that in order to properly analyze the growth and welfare implications of patents, {{it is important to consider}} their often neglected compositional effects on vertical and horizontal innovation. ...|$|R

40|$|Complex high {{technology}} industries are increasingly affected by patent thickets in which firms' <b>patents</b> mutually <b>block</b> {{the use of}} important technologies. Firms facing patent thickets patent intensively to acquire bargaining chips and use licensing to ensure freedom to operate. Such licensing allows rivals to either avoid or resolve hold-up from <b>blocking</b> <b>patents.</b> R&D incentives depend on whether licensing takes place ex ante or ex post. We model the choice between ex ante licensing and entry into patent portfolio races leading to ex post licensing.

Empirical results support these theoretical predictions. Hold-up problem Licensing Innovation Patent race Patent thicket Research joint ventures...|$|R

Moreover, in fields {{with a large number}} of mutually <b>blocking</b> <b>patents</b> the incidence of opposition is sharply reduced, particularly among large firms and firms that are caught up directly in patent thickets.

40|$|The {{literature}} on R&D-driven economic growth suggests that technological innovations result from entrepreneurial {{activities such as}} R&D investments. In the first two chapters of this dissertation, I develop tractable frameworks to characterize and quantitatively evaluate the effects of patent policy on R&D and economic growth. In the final chapter, I analyze {{the political economy of}} patent policy. What are the effects of <b>blocking</b> <b>patents</b> on R&D and consumption? To answer this question, I develop a generalized quality-ladder growth model with overlapping intellectual property rights and calibrate the model to aggregate data of the US economy to quantify the inefficiency in the patent system. Under parameter values that match key features of the US economy and show equilibrium R&D underinvestment, I find that eliminating <b>blocking</b> <b>patents</b> would lead to a conservatively estimated increase in R&D of 12 % and consumption of 4 % per year. Is the patent length an effective policy instrument in stimulating R&D? To answer this question, I develop a generalized variety-expanding growth model and calibrate the model to aggregate data to quantify the effects of patent extension. At the empirical patent-value depreciation rates, extending the patent length beyond 20 years leads to a negligible increase in R&D despite equilibrium R&D underinvestment. On the other hand, shortening the patent length can lead to a significant reduction in R&D and consumption. The calibration exercise also suggests that about 35 % to 45 % of the long-run total factor productivity growth in the US is driven by R&D. What are the welfare implications of pharmaceutical lobbying? Since the 80 ’s, the pharmaceutical industry has benefited substantially from the strengthening of patent protection for brand-name drugs {{as a result of the}} industry’s political influence. To analyze this phenomenon, I incorporate special interest politics into a quality-ladder growth model to consider the policymakers’ tradeoff between the socially optimal patent length and campaign contributions. The welfare analysis suggests that the presence of a pharmaceutical lobby distorting patent protection is socially undesirable in a closed-economy setting but may improve global welfare in a multi-country setting, which features an additional efficiency tradeoff between monopolistic distortion and international free-riding on innovations...|$|R
40|$|Gaining {{access to}} {{technological}} assets and patents, in particular, {{has long been}} a major motive and objective for firm acquisitions. On the one hand, patents are used as a building instrument for the acquirer’s technology portfolio. On the other hand, patents can be attractive because of their strategic value as a bargaining chip, e. g. in licensing negotiations. This is especially the case if patents have the potential to block competitors. Drawing on transaction cost economics and the resource-based view of the firm, we analyze the importance of these two faces of technology acquisition for the valuation of a target firm. Empirical evidence for European firm acquisitions in the period from 1999 to 2003 indicates that the price paid by an acquirer for a target increases with the patent stock, the relatedness, the value and the blocking potential of the target’s <b>patents,</b> especially if <b>blocking</b> <b>patents</b> are in technology fields related to the acquiring firm’s patent portfolio.

40|$|Corporate {{scientific}} publications {{are often}} {{presented as a}} strategic means for firms to create prior art with the objective to prevent others from patenting related inventions.

This paper analyses for the first time whether the presumed mechanism behind corporate publications as a means to preempt patents works. With a focus on the semiconductor technology, our results show that scientific publications by corporations challenge the novelty of patent applications at the European Patent Office (EPO) significantly more than other pieces of prior art. Detailed information from the EPO patent examination procedure allows us to show that corporate publications threaten the novelty of patent applications if combined with other pieces of prior art like patents rather than as standalone documents. This supports the claim that corporate scientific publishing can be an effective means for firms to protect their freedom to operate if used as a complementary part of a firm’s overall IP protection strategy...|$|R
40|$|Two {{opposite}} {{models are}} currently {{operating in the}} modern economy, the strong intellectual property rights (IPR) model, and the open source/open science model. They have traditionally been applied to alternative institutional contexts. The strong IPR model has been associated to the business environment, while the open science model has been associated to the academic or research system. More recently, a strengthening of the IPR system {{has occurred in the}} public research system, and open science models have been adopted in private sectors like the open source software. This paper discusses these different models and their implications on the innovative activity of firms and economies, and the market dynamics. One of the main benefits deriving from a strong IPR system is that it encourages the entry of new technology-based firms and the commercialisation of technologies in markets for technologies. At the same time, an increased patent protection is also associated to potential costs, such as those arising from a excessive fragmentation of property rights, an abuse of patent protection for strategic reasons (sleeping and <b>blocking</b> <b>patents),</b> and an increase in litigation costs.

40|$|In its Pharmaceutical Sector Inquiry Report of 2009, the European Commission {{identified}} ‘defensive patent strategies’ as {{a potential}} anti-competitive abuse {{in the sense of}} Article 102 TFEU. Such strategies include in particular patent filings that may delay the market entry of generic drugs or obstruct innovation activity of other originator companies. Yet the Report refrains from a an in-depth legal analysis of such behaviour. With the objective of clarifying the legal implications of the Sector Inquiry Report, the article analyses the AstraZeneca judgment of the General Court of 2010 as a precedent for assessing the anti-competitive character of patent filings under EU competition law. Thereby, it is argued that patent law does not insulate filings against competition-law liability. Yet the judgment, which is limited to ‘static’ price competition between originator companies and generics producers, does not provide sufficient guidance for analysing harm to ‘dynamic’ competition in innovation among originator companies. In this regard, the article advocates a cautious approach, according to which a violation of EU competition law requires anti-competitive intent for which the party arguing a violation should carry the burden of proof. The article also refers to the Boehringer case, which was settled by the Commission in Summer 2011, after Boehringer agreed to give up its allegedly anti-competitive <b>blocking</b> <b>patents...</b>|$|R

The project will also investigate from a network perspective the phenomenon of the so-called ``patent thickets’’, i. e. the presence of “dense web of overlapping intellectual property rights that a company must hack its way through in order to actually commercialise new technology " (Shapiro, 2001).

40|$|Few {{empirical}} studies {{have addressed the}} impact of the patent system on industry structure. Using firm-level patent data for firms in plant biotechnology, we develop a measure of patent enforceability. Duration models show that patent statistics are useful predictors of the timing of consolidation and that patent enforceability is an important factor influencing the likelihood of consolidation. Acquisitions in plant biotechnology may be motivated by the enforcement of patent rights when firms have over-lapping technologies; some merger activity may be explained by attempts to avoid mutually blocking technology, as exemplified by the case of Roundup Ready corn. Key words: hazard estimation, mergers and acquisitions, mutually <b>blocking</b> <b>patents,</b> patent enforceability, patent rights, plant biotechnology. In complex knowledge markets, new prod-ucts are often the result of cumulative innova-tion, or depend on a system of complementary technologies (Scotchmer 1991). More gener-ally Mowery (1983) has shown that it is im-possible for firms to fully internalize R&D spillovers. In the case of plant biotechnology, the range of technologies necessary to market a new product is rarely controlled by a single firm (Rausser 1999). As a case in point, the pro-duction of Roundup Ready corn relies on nine patented technologies, controlled at one point by five independent firms. Consolidations in the 1990 s reduced that control to two firms, but also generated costly litigation—some of which is still pending. In a market with zero transaction costs, one would expect the control of valuable complementary assets to agglomerate either through direct control or via costless arms-length transactions. But, in reality, overlap-ping patent rights and fragmented control of mutually blocking technologies can beget an anti-commons, in which resources are under-utilized and innovation is inhibited (Helle...|$|R
