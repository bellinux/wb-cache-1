5|$|At Foulois' recommendation, Saville {{entered the}} Air Corps Tactical School at Maxwell Field, Alabama, in August 1933. Saville {{graduated}} in May 1934, {{at the top}} of his class, and remained at the school as an instructor in the Maps and Photographs Section. At ACTS, Saville joined Claire L. Chennault in favoring an air defense strategy hinging on a strong fighter force. Saville argued against the so-called Bomber Mafia; he did not believe that fleets of bombers were unstoppable, and he considered close coordination between ground units and tactical air power a key part of Army doctrine. In July 1935, at the temporary rank of captain, he was named recorder of the Air Corps Board at Maxwell Field, in addition to his duties as fighter aviation instructor. Saville removed a degree of independent command from fighter squadron leaders who previously could ignore instructions radioed from the ground. Backed by Brigadier General Henry Conger Pratt, Saville's unpopular control methods proved their worth, as ground controllers were often in possession of <b>better</b> <b>information</b> than squadron leaders in flight. From 1935 to 1937, as Chennault was eased out by the bomber advocates, Saville took his place as the top fighter proponent. Saville avoided Chennault's fate by refraining from disputing the bomber's important role in offensive operations. He felt that the fighter aircraft was undervalued in its defensive role.|$|E

40|$|I {{study the}} welfare {{effects of a}} lack of common {{knowledge}} in a dynamic price-setting model with incomplete nominal adjustment due to incomplete, heterogeneous information. I identify two welfare effects of informational heterogeneity: First, it affects the dynamic adjustment of prices in response to aggregate shocks, and thereby the magnitude of aggregate consumption volatility. Second, informational heterogeneity leads to price dispersion across firms, which leads to an ex-post resource mis-allocation. There is a trade-off between the two: <b>Better</b> public <b>information</b> always improves the ex post resource allocation, but by acting as a focal point of beliefs, it may increase consumption and price volatility. <b>Better</b> private <b>information</b> reduces aggregate volatility, but may increase price dispersion. The aggregate welfare implications are driven by the latter: <b>Better</b> public <b>information</b> is always welfare-improving, but <b>better</b> private <b>information</b> may lead to welfare losses. Finally, I compare equilibrium strategies to the first-best use of information, and show that the equilibrium relies too heavily on private information, relative to the social optimum. This inefficiency {{is the result of a}} forecasting externality, whereby individual decision rules do not internalize their effect on the forecasting problem other firms face in equilibrium...|$|R

Tellis {{argues that}} the Indo-US nuclear deal is {{attractive}} to India because it gives it access to far more options on its civil nuclear programme than would otherwise be the case, primarily by ending its isolation from the international nuclear community. These options include access to latest technologies, access to higher unit output reactors which are more economical, access to global finance for building reactors, ability to export its indigenous small reactor size PHWRs, <b>better</b> <b>information</b> flow for its research community, etc. Finally, the deal also gives India two options that are relatively independent from the three-stage programme, {{at least in terms}} of their dependencies on success or failure. The first option is that, India can opt to stay with the first stage reactors as long as the global supply of uranium lasts. The plus side of this is that it covers any risk from short term delays or failures in implementing the three-stage programme. On the negative side, this is an option that is antithetical to the underlying objective of energy independence through the exploitation of thorium.|$|E

The means of infection varied widely, with infection in the absence of living or recently dead humans in Sicily (which speaks against most viruses).

2500|$|In 1934, Congress {{established}} the independent Securities and Exchange Commission to end irresponsible market manipulations {{and dissemination of}} false information about securities.

[...] The SEC had four missions. First and foremost was to restore investor confidence in the securities market which had collapsed on account of its questionability, and the external threats supposedly posed by anti-business elements in the Roosevelt administration. Second, the SEC had to get rid of the penny ante swindles based on false information, fraudulent devices, and get-rich-quick schemes. Thirdly, and much more important than the frauds, the SEC had to end the million-dollar maneuvers in major corporations, whereby insiders with access to much <b>better</b> <b>information</b> about the company knew when to buy or sell their own securities. A crackdown on insider trading was essential. Finally, the SEC had to set up a complex system of registration for all securities sold in America, with a clear set of rules, deadlines and guidelines that all companies had to follow. The main challenge faced by the young lawyers was drafting precise rules. The SEC succeeded in its four missions, as Kennedy reassured the American business community that they would no longer be deceived and taken advantage of by Wall Street. He trumpete for ordinary investors to return to the market and enable the economy to grow again.

2500|$|The {{problem of}} global {{serializability}} {{has been a}} quite intensively researched subject in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Commitment ordering (CO) has provided an effective general solution to the problem, insight into it, and understanding about possible generalizations of strong strict two phase locking (SS2PL), which practically and almost exclusively has been utilized (in conjunction with the Two-phase commit protocol (2PC) [...] ) since the 1980s to achieve global serializability across databases. An important side-benefit of CO is the automatic global deadlock resolution that it provides (this is applicable also to distributed SS2PL; though global deadlocks have been an important research subject for SS2PL, automatic resolution has been overlooked, except in the CO articles, until today (2009)). At that time quite many commercial database system types existed, many non-relational, and databases were relatively very small. Multi database systems were considered a key for database scalability by database systems interoperability, and global serializability was urgently needed. Since then the tremendous progress in computing power, storage, and communication networks, resulted in orders of magnitude increases in both centralized databases' sizes, transaction rates, and remote access to database capabilities, as well as blurring the boundaries between centralized computing and distributed one over fast, low-latency local networks (e.g., Infiniband). These, together with progress in database vendors' distributed solutions (primarily the popular SS2PL with 2PC based, a de facto standard that allows interoperability among different vendors' (SS2PL-based) databases; both SS2PL and 2PC technologies have gained substantial expertise and efficiency), workflow management systems, and database replication technology, in most cases have provided satisfactory and sometimes <b>better</b> <b>information</b> technology solutions without multi database atomic distributed transactions over databases with different concurrency control (bypassing the problem above). As a result, {{the sense of urgency}} that existed with the problem at that period, and in general with high-performance distributed atomic transactions over databases with different concurrency control [...] types, has reduced. However, the need in concurrent distributed atomic transactions as a fundamental element of reliability exists in distributed systems also beyond database systems, and so the need in global serializability as a fundamental correctness criterion for such transactional systems (see also Distributed serializability in Serializability). With the proliferation of the Internet, Cloud computing, Grid computing, small, portable, powerful computing devices (e.g., smartphones), and sophisticated systems management the need for effective global serializability techniques to ensure correctness in and among distributed transactional applications seems to increase, and thus also the need in Commitment ordering (including the popular for databases special case SS2PL; SS2PL, though, does not meet the requirements of many other transactional objects).|$|E
