2500|$|The numbat (Myrmecobius fasciatus), {{also known}} as the <b>banded</b> <b>anteater,</b> {{marsupial}} anteater, [...] or walpurti, is a marsupial native to Western Australia and recently re-introduced to South Australia. Its diet consists almost exclusively of termites. Once widespread across southern Australia, its range is now restricted to several small colonies, and it is listed as an endangered species. The numbat is an emblem of Western Australia and protected by conservation programs.|$|E
2500|$|Numbats are {{insectivores}} and eat {{an exclusive}} diet of termites. An adult numbat requires up to 20,000 termites each day. The only marsupial fully active by day, the numbat {{spends most of}} its time searching for termites. [...] It digs them up from loose earth with its front claws and captures them with its long, sticky tongue. Despite its <b>banded</b> <b>anteater</b> name, it apparently does not intentionally eat ants; although the remains of ants have occasionally been found in numbat dung, these belong to species that themselves prey on termites, so were presumably eaten accidentally, along with the main food. Known predators on numbats include carpet pythons, introduced red foxes, and various falcons, hawks, and eagles.|$|E

50|$|As {{part of the}} Australian Commonwealth {{series of}} six postage stamps issued between 1959 and 1962 she {{designed}} the platypus for the one-shilling stamp and was awarded the Vizard-Wholohan Prize for prints in 1962. Other stamps in the series feature the kangaroo, <b>banded</b> <b>anteater,</b> tiger cat, rabbit bandicoot and the Tasmanian tiger (now believed extinct). This stamp series is significant as {{it was one of}} the earliest attempts at putting Australian flora and fauna on stamps. In addition {{it was one of the}} first times that a designer further commercialised their designs by producing poster versions of the stamp artwork and made them available for sale. This series, the first to be designed by a woman, were for the Postmaster-General's Department now called Australia Post. Mayo produced many stamp and poster designs depicting the flora and fauna of Australia.|$|E
