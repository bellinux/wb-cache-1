The key challenge of the COMBITOX project {{is to develop a}} unique instrument that can accommodate several <b>biodetector</b> systems (see the accompanying COMBITOX papers) able to detect different pollutants such as bacteria, toxins, and heavy metals. The output signal chosen by our consortium is based on luminescence detection. Our group recently developed phage-based biosensors using gfp as a reporter gene to detect enteric bacteria in complex environments such as sea water, and the main challenge we faced was to adapt our <b>biodetector</b> to a luminescent signal that could fit the COMBITOX project requirements. Another key point was to use a substrate-independent reporter system in order to avoid substrate addition in the detection prototype. This paper describes the development of a phage-based <b>biodetector</b> using a luminescent and substrate-independent output to detect some enteric bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, in water samples. We have successfully engineered various prototypes using the HK 620 and HK 97 bacteriophages that use different packaging systems, and both proved functional for the integration of the full luxCDABE operon controlled by two different bacterial promoters. We show that the luxCDABE operon controlled by the PrplU bacterial promoter is the most efficient in terms of signal emission. The emission of luminescence is specific and allows the detection of 10 (4) bacteria per milliliter in 1. 5 h post-infection with neither a concentration nor enrichment step...|$|E
40|$|A bead-based {{sedimentation}} <b>biodetector</b> is studied theoretically. The <b>biodetector</b> operates with {{a suspension}} of settling beads, non-settling reporters, and target analytes – all initially suspended in a buffer solution. The reporters {{can be either}} fluorescent molecules or small particles. The functionalized beads interact with the reporters and target analytes while settling under the action of gravitational, electric, and/or magnetic fields. Both sandwich and competitive assays with hindered settling are considered. In the sandwich format, {{in the presence of}} target analytes, the reporters bind to the beads and settle (the target analytes provide the link between the beads and the reporters). A reduction in the reporters ’ concentration indicates the presence of target analytes. In the competitive format, both target analytes and reporters compete for bead-based binding sites. In the absence of target analytes, one would observe a reduction in the suspended reporters ’ concentration. The model allows one to predict the reporters’ concentration in solution as a function of initial bead, reporter, and target analyte concentration...|$|E

The two isolates were previously characterized using cultural and serological-microagglutination test as pathogenic leptospires of the serogroup Ballum, closely related to serovars Kenya and Peru.

Recently, nanotube field effect transistors (CNFETs) have been exploited as <b>biodetectors</b> of the thyroid hormone, triiodothyronine (T 3). Although significant progress has been towards the development of actual nanotube based sensor devices, the next challenge is to integrate the devices into a single chip. Numerous gate configurations to CNFETs have been proposed, but few {{have been shown to}} be effective, and even fewer can be integrated to a chip. An electrolytic “tip ” gate design has been shown to be more effective than the conventional backgate geometry.

The LF cell {{consists of a}} porous membrane containing immobilized ligands at various locations. Through the action of capillary forces, a mixture of sample and reporter particles is transported to the ligand sites, where the target analytes and the reporters bind to the immobilized ligand. The concentration of the reporters is measured with a scanner. A mathematical model for two different competitive assays is constructed and used to study the performance of LF devices under various operating conditions. The model predicts the signal magnitude {{as a function of}} target analyte, reporter, and ligand concentrations, reaction rate constants, and flow rate. The predictions are compared and qualitatively agree with experimental data. The model provides insights into various experimental observations. Furthermore, the model can be used to optimize the performance of LF devices and to inexpensively and rapidly test the system under various operating conditions...|$|R

We use this property to control the motion of microalgae within a Poiseuille flow using light. The combination of flow vorticity and phototaxis results in a concentration of algae around {{the center of the}} flow. Intermittent light exposure allows analysis of the dynamics of this phenomenon and its reversibility. With this phenomenon, we hope to pave the way toward new algae concentration techniques (a bottleneck challenge in biofuel algal production) and toward the improvement of pollutant <b>biodetector</b> technology...|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{a simple}} and direct <b>biodetector</b> was proposed, {{which was based on}} biotin immobilized onto a {{conducting}} polymer-coated electrode, for the detection of avidin, a highly stable glycoprotein found in egg-whites. Biotin was immobilized onto the electrode by covalent coupling to the primary amine group on the poly 3 ′-(3 -chloro- 4 -amino-β-styryl) -(2, 2 ′: 5 ′, 2 ″-terthiophene) (PCAST), and the biotinavidin interaction was monitored by cyclic voltammetry. Incubation of the PCAST/biotin-modified-coated electrode with avidin in a phosphate buffered saline solution caused a significant change to its cyclic voltammogram, which was explained by the binding of avidin by biotin, and resulted in restricted ion transfer to and from the conducting polymer. This change was then utilized to detect avidin at 4 × 10 - 6 molL - 1. © 2012 CSIRO...|$|E
40|$|Recognizing and {{quantifying}} specific biomolecules in aqueous {{samples are}} constantly needed {{in research and}} diagnostic laboratories. As the typical detection procedures are rather lengthy and involve the use of labeled secondary antibodies or other agents to provide a signal, efforts have been made over the last 10 y to develop alternative label-free methods that enable direct detection. We propose and demonstrate an extremely simple, low-cost, label-free <b>biodetector</b> based on measuring the intensity of light reflected by the interface between a fluid sample and an amorphous fluoropolymer substrate having a refractive index very close to that of water and hosting various antibodies immobilized in spots. Under these index-matching conditions, the amount of light reflected by the interface allows straightforward quantification {{of the amount of}} antigen binding to each spot. Using antibodies targeting heterologous immunoglobulins and antigens commonly used as markers for diagnoses of hepatitis B and HIV, we demonstrate the limit of detection of a few picograms per square millimeter of surface-bound molecules. We also show that direct and real-time access to the amount of binding molecules allows the precise extrapolation of adhesion rates, from which the concentrations of antigens in solution can be estimated down to fractions of nanograms per milliliter...|$|E
30|$|Dielectric {{microspheres}} {{can act as}} resonators with a geometry {{that offers}} the highest quality factor (Q up to 109) [1]. The light trapped in these resonators by means of total internal reflection exhibits very strong and sharp resonances, called whispering gallery modes (WGMs), at specific wavelengths known from Mie theory [2, 3]. In this formalism, these resonances {{are determined by the}} radius a of the microsphere and the refractive index contrast m = m 1 /m 0 where m 1 and m 0 are the refractive indices of the microsphere and the surrounding medium, respectively. The microspheres can thus act as very sensitive refractometer sensors [4] or even <b>biodetectors.</b> The signal transduction mechanism for biodetection is typically the wavelength shift induced by evanescent field coupling between WGMs and analytes surrounding the microcavities [5 – 9], making it even possible to detect single binding events. All these absorption-based methods require precise evanescent coupling of the excitation source in a WGM. They thus suffer from relying on fragile fiber tapers, angled-polished fibers, coupling prisms, etc. with a critical dependence on their alignment.|$|R
40|$|Better {{understanding}} of uranyl toxicity in bacteria {{is necessary to}} optimize strains for bioremediation purposes or for using bacteria as <b>biodetectors</b> for bioavailable uranyl. In this study, after different steps of optimization, Escherichia coli cells were exposed to uranyl at low pH to minimize uranyl precipitation and to increase its bioavailability. Bacteria were adapted to mid acidic pH before exposure to 50 or 80 µM uranyl acetate for two hours at pH≈ 3. To evaluate the impact of uranium, growth in these conditions were compared and the same rates of cells survival were observed in control and uranyl exposed cultures. Additionally, this impact was analyzed by two-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis proteomics to discover protein actors specifically present or accumulated in contact with uranium. Exposure to uranium resulted in differential accumulation of proteins associated with oxidative stress and in the accumulation of the NADH/quinone oxidoreductase WrbA. This FMN dependent protein performs obligate two-electron reduction of quinones, and {{may be involved in}} cells response to oxidative stress. Interestingly, this WrbA protein presents similarities with the chromate reductase from E. coli, which was shown to reduce uranyl in vitro...|$|R
40|$|Giant magnetoimpedance (GMI) {{has been}} {{proposed}} as a powerful technique for biosensing. In GMI biosensors based on the magnetic label detection the change of the impedance of sensitive element under the application of an external magnetic field was analyzed {{in the presence of}} magnetic nanoparticles in a test solution. Amorphous ribbon-based GMI <b>biodetectors</b> have an advantage of low operation frequency and low cost. In this work, magnetic and GMI properties of amorphous Co 68. 6 Fe 3. 9 Mo 3. 0 Si 12. 0 B 12. 5 ribbons were studied in as-quenched and surface modified states both without and in the presence of maghemite ferrofluid. After the surface modification the coercivity was slightly increased and saturation magnetization decreased in good agreement with increase of the surface roughness, a decrease of magnetic elements concentrations in the surface layer, and formation of a surface protective oxide layer. The GMI difference for as-quenched ribbons in absence and in the presence of ferrofluid was measurable for the frequency range of 2 to 10 [*]MHz and the current intensities of 1 to 20 [*]mA. Although the proposed surface modification by the ultrasound treatment did not improve the sensitivity limit for ferrofluid detection, it did not decrease it either...|$|R
40|$|Filamentous phage, such as fd {{used in this}} study, are thread-shaped {{bacterial}} viruses. Their outer coat is a tube {{formed by}} thousands equal copies of the major coat protein pVIII. We constructed libraries of random peptides fused to all pVIII domains and selected phages that act as probes specific for a panel of test antigens and biological threat agents. Because the viral carrier is infective, phage borne bio-selective probes can be cloned individually and propagated indefinitely without needs of their chemical synthesis or reconstructing. We demonstrated the feasibility of using landscape phages and their stripped fusion proteins as new bioselective materials that combine unique characteristics of affinity reagents and self assembling membrane proteins. Biorecognition layers fabricated from phage-derived probes bind biological agents and generate detectable signals. The performance of phage-derived materials as biorecognition films was illustrated by detection of streptavidin-coated beads, Bacillus anthracis spores and Salmonella typhimurium cells. With further refinement, the phage-derived analytical platforms for detecting and monitoring of numerous threat agents may be developed, since the <b>biodetector</b> films may be obtained from landscape phages selected against any bacteria, virus or toxin. As elements of field-use detectors, they are superior to antibodies, since they are inexpensive, highly specific and strong binders, resistant to high temperatures and environmental stresses.

40|$|We elucidated the light-matter {{interaction}} of individual ZnO NRs with a monochromatic beam of linearly polarized light that scatters elastically from the ZnO NRs by performing forward scattering and back-aperture imaging in a dark-field setting. We precisely controlled the {{electric field vector}} of the incident light and the NR orientation within the plane of light interaction during both modes of measurement, and spatially resolved the scattering response from different interaction points along the NR long axis. We then discerned, for the first time, the effects of light polarization, analyzer angle, and NR orientation on the intensity and directionality of the optical responses both qualitatively and quantitatively {{along the length of}} the single ZnO NRs. We identified distinctive scattering profiles from individual ZnO NRs subject to incident light polarization with controlled NR orientation from the forward dark-field scattering and back-aperture imaging modes. The fundamental light interaction behavior of ZnO NRs is likely to govern their functional outcomes in photonics, optoelectronics, and sensor devices. Hence, our efforts provided much needed insight into unique optical responses from individual 1 D ZnO nanomaterials, which could be highly beneficial in developing next-generation optoelectronic systems and optical <b>biodetectors</b> with improved device efficiency and sensitivity.

30|$|In this letter, {{we propose}} a new {{absolute}} WGM-based sensing method {{that does not}} require calibration, reference measures or any prior knowledge about the microsphere radii. Only one spectrum acquisition per fluorescent microsphere is needed; hence, {{we no longer have}} {{to keep track of the}} position of each microsphere between manipulations. This opens up new engineering possibilities for sensor integration in fluidic systems (including microfluidics and lab-on-chip devices). In the case of biodetection, this method breaks free from surface-based sensing with poor analyte capture efficiencies and facilitates the mixing of microsphere sensors with analytes. After a brief overview of the experimental setup as well as the WGM theory as formulated by H. Chew [25, 26] and applied by Zijlstra et al. [11], a new algorithm will be exposed to analyze fluorescence emission spectra with multiple WGMs. Fitting the theoretical WGMs over the whole experimental spectral range ensures the finding of a unique combination (a m 0) of microsphere radius and refractive index of the surroundings. We will show that the chosen theory, taking into account the dipole emitters within the microspheres and thus differing from the original Mie theory, and the chosen experimental conditions, where the microspheres are in suspension, yield an almost perfect match between the theoretical and experimental WGM spectra. Then, we test our algorithm using a microsphere population of radii unknown a priori to extract the refractive index of liquids. Also, results from applying our algorithm in label-free biodetection experiments will be discussed. Since free floating functionalized microspheres available commercially can now be directly used as fluorescent <b>biodetectors,</b> the sample preparation can be significantly simplified and shortened. Here, the analyte will be a dormant form of bacteria captured by a positively charged polymer coating on the microspheres and detected without a reference measurement. Finally, preliminary results on colloidal quantum dot (cQD) coated microspheres will be presented as a mean to improve WGM visibility and extend the spectral range covered by fluorescence emission, eventually increasing the number of WGM fitted by our algorithm.|$|R
40|$|A {{combination}} of magnetic sensors with magnetic nanoparticles offers a promising approach for highly sensitive, simple, and rapid detection of cancer cells and biomolecules. The challenge facing {{the field of}} magnetic biosensing {{is the development of}} low-cost devices capable of superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) -like field sensitivity at room temperature. In another area of interest, improving the sensitivity of existing electromagnetic field sensors for microwave energy sensing applications is an important and challenging task. In this dissertation, we have explored the excellent magnetoimpedance and microwave absorption responses of soft ferromagnetic amorphous ribbons and microwires for the development of high-performance magnetic <b>biodetectors</b> and microwave energy sensors. We have developed the effective approaches to improve the magnetoimpedance response of Co 65 Fe 4 Ni 2 Si 15 B 14 amorphous ribbons by tuning their dimension and/or coating them with thin layers of CoFe 2 O 4. Coating amorphous and crystalline CoFe 2 O 4 films on the ribbon surface have opposite impacts on the magnetoimpedance response. Pulsed laser deposition (PLD) is shown to be a novel in-situ annealing and coating method for improving the magnetoimpedance response of the soft ferromagnetic amorphous ribbons for advanced sensor applications. The magnetoimpedance responses are also enhanced in multi-microwire systems relative to their single microwires. We have introduced a new method of combining the magnetoresistance (MR), magnetoreactance (MX), and magnetoimpedance (MI) effects of a soft ferromagnetic amorphous ribbon to develop an integrated biosensor with enhanced sensitivity and tunable frequency. While existing MI biosensors have limited sensitivities, we show that by exploiting the MR and MX effects it is possible to improve the sensitivity of the biosensor by up to 50 % and 100 %, respectively. The MX-based approach shows the most sensitive detection of superparamagnetic (Fe 3 O 4) nanoparticles at low concentrations, demonstrating a sensitivity level comparable to that of a SQUID-based biosensor. Unlike a SQUID, however, the proposed MX technique is cryogen-free and operates at room temperature, providing a promising avenue to the development of low-cost highly sensitive biosensors. We have further improved the detection sensitivity of the MI and MX biosensors by patterning the sensing (ribbon) surface with nano/micro-sized holes, using the etching or focused ion beam (FIB) technique. These biosensors have been successfully employed to detect and quantify various bioanalytes, such as Curcumin-type anticancer drugs, bovine serum albumen (BSA) proteins, and Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cancer cells that have taken up the surface-functionalized Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles. Since Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles are widely used as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents, our biosensing technique can also be used as a new, low-cost, fast and easy pre-detection method before MRI. Finally, we have developed a new method of using a soft ferromagnetic glass-coated amorphous microwire as a microwave absorber for fabrication of a fiber Bragg grating-based microwave energy sensor with improved sensitivity and less perturbation of the microwave field. As compared to a similar approach that uses gold to absorb electromagnetic radiation, the microwire yields a device with greater sensitivity (~ 10 times at f = 3. 25 GHz) relative to the perturbation of the microwave field. A correlation between the magnetic softness and microwave absorption in the microwires has been established, paving the way to improve the performance of the microwave energy sensor by tailoring their soft magnetic properties...|$|R
40|$|Preventing and {{protecting}} against catastrophic terrorism {{is a complex}} and dynamic challenge. Small groups or individuals can use advanced technology to cause massive destruction, and the rapid pace of technology and ease of information dissemination continually gives terrorists new tools. A 100 % defense is not possible. It's a numbers problem [...] there are simply too many possible targets to protect and too many potential attack scenarios and adversaries to defend against. However, science and technology (S&T) is a powerful force multiplier for defense. We must use S&T {{to get ahead of}} the game by making terrorist attacks more difficult to execute, more likely to be interdicted, and less devastating in terms of casualties, economic damage, or lasting disruption. Several S&T areas have potential to significantly enhance homeland security efforts with regard to detecting radiation, pathogens, explosives, and chemical signatures of weapons activities. All of these areas require interdisciplinary research and development (R&D), and many critically depend on advances in materials science. For example, the science of nuclear signatures lies at the core of efforts to develop enhanced radiation detection and nuclear attribution capabilities. Current radiation detectors require cryogenic cooling and are too bulky and expensive. Novel signatures of nuclear decay, new detector materials that provide high resolution at ambient temperatures, and new imaging detectors are needed. Such technologies will improve our ability to detect and locate small, distant, or moving sources and to discriminate threat materials from legitimate sources. A more complete understanding of isotopic ratios via secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), NanoSIMS, or yet-to-be-developed technologies is required to elucidate critical characteristics of nuclear materials (e. g., isotopics, age, reprocessing) in order to identify their source and route history. S&T challenges abound in the biodefense arena as well. Improved <b>biodetectors</b> are needed [...] autonomous instruments that continuously monitor the environment for threat pathogens, promptly alert authorities {{in the event of a}} positive detection, and have an extremely low false alarm rate. Because many threat pathogens are endemic to various regions of the world, the natural microbial environment must be characterized so that background detections can be distinguished from a deliberate release. In addition, most current detection approaches require an a priori knowledge of the pathogens of concern and thus won't work in the face of a new, naturally occurring disease, such as a mutated avian influenza that effects humans, or a deliberately manipulated organism. Thus, we must move from species-specific detection to function-based detection based on a fundamental understanding of the mechanisms and genetic markers of infectivity, pathogenicity, antibiotic resistance, and other traits that distinguish a harmful organism from an innocuous one. Last but not least, new vaccines and treatments are needed, which in turn require in-depth understanding of cellular surfaces, protein folding, and myriad nano-bio aspects of host-pathogen interactions. Much attention is being devoted to countering weapons-of-mass-destruction terrorism, since Al-Qaeda and other terrorist groups have repeatedly stated their intention to acquire and use nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons. However, terrorists in Iraq and elsewhere continue to wreak havoc using improvised explosive devices. Thus, there is a pressing security need for better methods for detecting explosive materials and devices. Transformational S&T such as pulsed fast-neutron analysis or terahertz spectroscopy for material- and element-specific imaging offer the promise of greatly improved explosive detection. For bioscience-based approaches, the development of highly multiplexed transducer arrays and molecular recognition methods that mimic biological systems would similarly provide the foundation for vastly improved capabilities. Likewise, new materials and technologies are needed for the detection of chemical signatures of weapons activities. One grand challenge is the detection and characterization of chemical effluents indicative of weapons production, either biological, chemical, or nuclear. Ideally, one would like to be able to detect such chemical signatures remotely, via satellite or other high-altitude platform. To do so, one must know what chemicals, singly or in combination, would be produced in various production processes, how they would behave in the environment, and how those chemicals, their precursors, and degradation products could be sampled...|$|R
