25|$|The {{standard}} U.S. {{medical school}} curriculum is four years long. Traditionally, {{the first two}} years are composed mainly of classroom basic science education, while the final two years primarily include rotations in clinical settings where students learn patient care firsthand. Today, clinical education is spread across all four years with the final year containing the most clinical rotation time. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has published mandatory rules, obliging on all inpatient and outpatient teaching settings, laying down the guidelines for what medical students in the United States may do, if they have not completed a clerkship or sub-internship. These rules apply to when they are in the clinical setting in school, not when they are, for example, helping staff events or in other non-formal educational settings, even if they are helping provide certain clinical services along with nurses and the supervising physicians- for example, certain basic screening procedures. In the formal clinical setting in school, they can only assist with certain patient evaluation and management tasks, after the vital signs, chief complaint and the history of present illness have been discerned, but prior to the physical examination: reviewing the patient's signs and symptoms in each body system, and then reviewing the patient's personal medical, genetic, family, educational/occupational, and psychosocial history. The student's supervising physician (or another physician with supervisory privileges if the original doctor is no longer available, for some reason) must <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> during the student's work, and must conduct this same assessment of the patient before performing the actual physical examination, and after finishing and conferring with the student, will review his or her notes and opinion, editing or correcting them if necessary, and will also have his or her own professional notes; both must then sign and date and I.D. the student's notes and the medical record. They may observe, but not perform, physical examinations, surgeries, endoscopic or laparoscopic procedures, radiological or nuclear medicine procedures, oncology sessions, and obstetrics. The patient must give consent for their presence and participation in his or her care, even at a teaching facility. Depending on the time they have completed in school, their familiarity with the area of medicine and the procedure, and the presence of their supervisor, and any others needed, in the room or nearby, they may be allowed to conduct certain very minor tests associated with the physical examination, such as simple venipuncture blood draws, and electrocardiograms and electroencephalograms, for learning and experience purposes, especially when there is no intern or resident available.|$|E

500|$|Radiohead {{had created}} Kid A and Amnesiac, {{recorded}} simultaneously, through a years-long process of recording and editing that drummer Phil Selway described as [...] "manufacturing {{music in the}} studio". For their next album, the band sought to capture a more immediate, [...] "live" [...] sound. Yorke told MTV: [...] "The last two studio records were a real headache. We had {{spent so much time}} looking at computers and grids, we were like, that's enough, we can't do that any more. This time, we used computers, but they had to actually <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> with all the gear. So everything was about performance, like staging a play." ...|$|E
2500|$|The first {{description}} of Marlborough Mills in Chapter XV is through Margaret's eyes and thoughts, and the omniscient narrator delves {{into the inner}} thoughts of her main characters [...] and occasionally interjects her observations (Bodenheimer, 1979, pp 293–300). Thornton [...] "thought that he disliked seeing one who had mortified him so keenly; but he was mistaken. It was a stinging pleasure to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> with her ... But he was no great analyser of his own motives, and was mistaken as I have said" [...] (Gaskell, 1855, chapter 29). The narrative sometimes slips into free indirect discourse; Mrs. Thornton silently calls Margaret's embroidery of {{a small piece of}} cambric [...] "flimsy, useless work" [...] when she visits the Hales (Gaskell, 1855, chapter 12).|$|E
2500|$|Further August 2007 dates were {{postponed}} for unclear reasons; Hoppus {{stated the}} band {{had decided to}} re-enter the studio in preparation of a second studio album. Hoppus and Barker spent {{the remainder of the}} year in discussions with record companies before announcing that the planned next +44 album would see release via Interscope Records. According to journalist Joe Shooman, little work commenced on the album: [...] "As for +44, there had been months slipping by with no real work on that one aside from writing snippets here and there, although there were also reports flying about that the next tour would take in a lot more of the world including South America." [...] Barker started releasing hip-hop remixes on May 9, 2008, and he hoped to collate his growing collection of remixes with a bunch of new tracks on which he was working. Eventually, the project became a solo album, with Barker producing it all himself. By the following August, Hoppus began recording material for a possible solo studio album at Opera while Barker worked on his solo studio album. [...] "I see him in our studio every week, and we'll <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> of the studio he's working in, listening to stuff he's recorded, or he'll come into the room where I'm working and check out my songs," [...] said Hoppus. The duo continued to work together, and Hoppus noted that Barker had laid down drums on several of his tracks.|$|E
