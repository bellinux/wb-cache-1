5|$|After {{the second}} study {{resulted}} in no further movement toward divided highway construction, locals formed the County Residents Action for Safer Highways (CRASH) in response to the significantly higher collision rates along the two-lane sections of US113 compared to the state average. The high collision rate, which included 42 fatal crashes between 1980 and 1997, led CRASH to rally community support and intensely lobby MDSHA to expand US113 to four lanes. MDSHA responded in 1995 by initiating the US113 Planning Study, which recommended expanding US113 to a divided highway from Berlin to the Delaware state line and from Snow Hill to Berlin. The agency needed to persuade other involved agencies to make the proposed expansion their top priority, <b>because</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time traffic volumes on the highway did not meet the thresholds beyond which the highway would need to be expanded to a four-lane divided highway.|$|E
5|$|Discovered in 1834 by Johann Friedrich Engelhardt and {{described}} {{three years later}} by Hermann von Meyer, Plateosaurus was the fifth named dinosaur genus that is still considered valid. Although it had been described before Richard Owen formally named Dinosauria in 1842, it {{was not one of}} the three genera used by Owen to define the group, <b>because</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time, it was poorly known and difficult to identify as a dinosaur. It is now among the dinosaurs best known to science: over 100 skeletons have been found, some of them nearly complete. The abundance of its fossils in Swabia, Germany, has led to the nickname Schwäbischer Lindwurm (Swabian lindworm).|$|E

5|$|Following her fiftieth {{birthday}} in May 1767, Maria Theresa contracted smallpox from her daughter-in-law, Maria Josepha of Bavaria. She survived, {{but the new}} empress did not. Maria Theresa then forced her daughter, Archduchess Maria Josepha, to pray {{with her in the}} Imperial Crypt next to the unsealed tomb of Empress Maria Josepha. The Archduchess started showing smallpox rash two days after visiting the crypt and soon died. Maria Carolina was to replace her as the pre-determined bride of King Ferdinand IV of Naples. Maria Theresa blamed herself for her daughter's death {{for the rest of her}} life <b>because,</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time, the concept of an extended incubation period was largely unknown and it was believed that Maria Josepha had caught smallpox from the body of the late empress.|$|E
5|$|However, Mikan met 28-year-old rookie DePaul {{basketball}} coach Ray Meyer, who saw {{potential in the}} bright and intelligent, but also clumsy and shy, freshman. Put into perspective, Meyer's thoughts were revolutionary, <b>because</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time {{it was believed that}} tall players were too awkward to ever play basketball well. In the following months, Meyer transformed Mikan into a confident, aggressive player who took pride in his height rather than being ashamed of it. Meyer and Mikan worked out intensively, and Mikan learned how to make hook shots accurately with either hand. This routine would become later known as the Mikan Drill. In addition, Meyer made Mikan punch a speed bag, take dancing lessons, and jump rope to make him a complete athlete.|$|E
5|$|In 1942, Glenn T. Seaborg {{established}} that when thorium was bombarded with neutrons, {{it could be}} transformed into fissile uranium-233. This was another possible route to an atomic bomb, especially if {{it turned out that}} uranium-233 could be more easily separated from thorium than plutonium from uranium. It was not pursued further because uranium-233 production would have required a complete redesign of the Hanford reactors; but in April 1944 the Metallurgical Laboratory's Thorfin R. Rogness calculated that a nuclear reactor containing thorium could produce enough uranium-233 to sustain its reaction without adding anything but more thorium. This was very interesting, <b>because</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time it was thought that uranium might be scarce, whereas thorium was at least ten times more plentiful.|$|E

5|$|In 1997, Matt and Jeff {{created their}} own wrestling promotion, The Organization of Modern Extreme Grappling Arts (frequently {{abbreviated}} to OMEGA Championship Wrestling, or simply OMEGA), in which Matt competed under the name High Voltage. The Hardys launched the promotion <b>because,</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time, there weren't many places to wrestle, nor did they know anyone who could help. Both Matt and Jeff would take apart the ring {{and put it back}} together at every event they had, while Matt sewed all the costumes worn in OMEGA. The promotion would fold in October 1999, after both Matt and Jeff signed with the World Wrestling Federation. Eight years later in 2007, Highspots.com produced a two-disc DVD set entitled OMEGA: Uncommon Passion, chronicling the history of the promotion, including matches and interviews with many OMEGA wrestlers.|$|E
5|$|It's not literal {{about the}} drug for me, I've never taken lithium before. It's sort of a metaphor about {{numbness}} and happiness... it's me looking at happiness {{in a negative way}} because I've always been... kind of afraid to be happy. Like with the band and the art and everything else, it's always like I'm never letting myself break through into the happiness it seems like, because it's not cool or something. And describing happiness is lithium, it's like saying 'that's numbness, I won't be able to be an artist anymore if I'm happy', which is hilarious because that's just not true, I'm happy. So it's... this fight within the song of... 'do I do this and get out of here and get happy or do I wallow in it like I always do?' and it's cool <b>because</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of the song I say 'I'm going to let it go', like I am going to be happy.|$|E
5|$|The {{award of}} the 2012 Summer Olympics to London {{has brought the}} {{question}} of British participation in the football tournaments to the fore, given that there is traditionally no single British national football team. The British Olympic Association initially refused {{to rule out the}} possibility of entry for 2008, but were unable to come to an agreement with the Scottish Football Association. The 2007 European Under-21 Championship, which served as the European qualifying tournament for the men's competition, saw the England U-21 team reach the semi-finals, which would have meant a place at the Olympics. <b>Because</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Olympics the team is representative of the entire UK, England were thus prevented from taking this place, with instead a play-off taking place between Portugal and Italy. A similar situation occurred with the England Women's team who, by virtue of being one of the top three European sides at the 2007 World Cup, would have been granted a place at the Olympics. Instead, there was a play-off between Denmark and Sweden.|$|E

5|$|The near {{simultaneous}} {{appearance of}} nodosaurids in both North America and Europe {{is worthy of}} consideration, <b>because</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time, they were separated from each other by a huge body of water. Europelta is the oldest nodosaurid from Europe; it {{is derived from the}} lower Albian Escucha Formation. The oldest western North American nodosaurid is Sauropelta, from the lower Albian Little Sheep Mudstone Member of the Cloverly Formation, at an age of 108.5±0.2million years. Eastern North American fossils seem older. Teeth of Priconodon crassus have been derived from the Arundel Clay of the Potomac Group of Maryland, which dates near the Aptian–Albian boundary. A Propanoplosaurus hatchling was uncovered {{from the base of the}} underlying Patuxent Formation, dated to the upper Aptian, making Propanoplosaurus the oldest nodosaurid.|$|E
5|$|Beneath the GMCA are the ten councils of Greater Manchester's ten {{district}}s, {{which are}} Bolton, Bury, the City of Manchester, Oldham, Rochdale, the City of Salford, Stockport, Tameside, Trafford and Wigan. These district councils {{have the greatest}} powers over public services, and control matters such as council tax, education provision, social housing, libraries and healthcare. Eight of the ten metropolitan boroughs were named after the eight former county boroughs that now compose the largest centres of population and greater historical and political prominence. As an example, the Metropolitan Borough of Stockport is centred on the town of Stockport, a former county borough, but includes other smaller settlements, such as Cheadle, Gatley, and Bramhall. The names {{of two of the}} metropolitan boroughs were given a neutral name <b>because,</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time they were created, there was no agreement on the town to be put forward as the administrative centre and neither had a county borough. These boroughs are Tameside and Trafford, centred on Ashton-under-Lyne and Stretford, respectively, and are named with reference to geographical and historical origins. The lowest formal tier of local government in Greater Manchester are the parish councils, which cover the various civil parishes in Greater Manchester, and have limited powers over upkeep, maintenance and small grants.|$|E
5|$|During a CNR hockey tournament held in December 1922 in Montreal, Morenz scored nine {{goals in}} a game for Stratford. A friend of Léo Dandurand, {{the owner of the}} Montreal Canadiens of the National Hockey League, {{refereed}} the game and told Dandurand how good Morenz was. Dandurand went to Stratford in January 1923 to watch Morenz play, and decided he wanted to sign him to the Canadiens. In April he met with William Morenz, <b>because</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> age of 20, Howie was still legally a minor. William told Dandurand that he wanted Howie to finish his apprenticeship at the CNR factory, which would take another two years. However, in July Dandurand learned that Morenz and his father had been in contact with the Toronto St. Patricks, a rival team in the NHL. Fearing that Morenz would sign in Toronto, Dandurand sent his friend, Cecil Hart, to Stratford with instructions to sign Morenz at any cost. On July 7, 1923, Morenz signed a contract with the Canadiens for three years with a salary of $3,500 per year and a $1,000 signing bonus, a considerable amount for a first-year professional.|$|E

5|$|The {{prosecution}} realized {{early on}} that issues relating to time would be {{an essential part of}} its case. At trial, each side presented witnesses to support their version of the timeline for the hours before and after the murder. The starting point was the time of death; the prosecution, relying on the analysis of stomach contents by their expert witness, argued that Phagan died between 12:00 and 12:15p.m. A prosecution witness, Monteen Stover, said she had gone into the office to get her paycheck, waiting there from 12:05 to 12:10, and did not see Frank in his office. The prosecution's theory was that Stover did not see Frank because he was at that time murdering Phagan. Stover's account did not match Frank's initial account that he had not left the office between noon and 12:30. Other testimony indicated that Phagan exited the trolley (or tram) between 12:07 and 12:10. From the stop it was a two- to four-minute walk, suggesting that Stover arrived first, making her testimony and its implications irrelevant: Frank could not be killing Phagan <b>because</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time she had not yet arrived.|$|E
