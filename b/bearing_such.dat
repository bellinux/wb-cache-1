5|$|According to Renaissance accounts, gigantic, {{triangular}} fossil teeth {{often found}} embedded in rocky formations were once {{believed to be}} the petrified tongues, or glossopetrae, of dragons and snakes. This interpretation was corrected in 1667 by Danish naturalist Nicolas Steno, who recognized them as shark teeth, and famously produced a depiction of a shark's head <b>bearing</b> <b>such</b> teeth. He described his findings in the book The Head of a Shark Dissected, which also contained an illustration of a megalodon tooth.|$|E
5|$|The Liberty Head nickel was {{replaced}} after 1912, and initially {{there was no}} indication that 1913-dated pieces with that design existed. In December 1919, a coin dealer, Samuel W. Brown, placed advertisements in coin publications, offering to buy 1913 Liberty Head nickels. The following August, Brown appeared at the annual American Numismatic Association (ANA) convention <b>bearing</b> <b>such</b> a piece. Brown claimed that a master die had been prepared for 1913 and that these pieces had been run off to test it. As it turned out, Brown possessed five coins, which he eventually sold. After spending fifteen years {{in the hands of the}} eccentric Col. E.H.R. Green, the famous Fort Worth, Texas, area collector, the coins were finally dispersed in 1943. Since then, they have had several owners each. Today, two are on public display—at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington and the ANA's Money Museum in Colorado Springs, while three are owned privately. The most recent sale of a 1913 Liberty Head nickel was in January 2010, when one sold for $3,737,500 in an auction.|$|E
25|$|True {{teeth are}} unique to vertebrates, {{although}} many invertebrates have analogous structures {{often referred to as}} teeth. The organisms with the simplest genome <b>bearing</b> <b>such</b> tooth-like structures are perhaps the parasitic worms of the family Ancylostomatidae. For example, the hookworm Necator americanus has two dorsal and two ventral cutting plates or teeth around the anterior margin of the buccal capsule. It also has a pair of subdorsal and a pair of subventral teeth located close to the rear.|$|E
50|$|In many applications, rolling-element <b>bearings,</b> <b>such</b> as ball or roller bearings, have {{replaced}} Babbitt <b>bearings.</b> Though <b>such</b> <b>bearings</b> {{can offer a}} lower coefficient of friction than plain bearings, their key advantage {{is that they can}} operate reliably without a continuous pressurized supply of lubricant. Ball and roller bearings can also be used in configurations that are required to carry both radial and axial thrusts. However, rolling-element bearings lack the beneficial damping and shock-load capability provided by fluid-film <b>bearings,</b> <b>such</b> as the Babbitt.|$|R

500|$|Thus, Reavis {{approached}} the topic {{from the standpoint}} of homosexuality being a social problem akin to alcoholism or prostitution. This echoed how many earlier programs, often produced as episodes of local talk shows, addressed homosexuality with shows <b>bearing</b> <b>such</b> titles as [...] "Homosexuals and the Problems They Present" [...] and [...] "Homosexuality: A Psychological Approach". The Rejected focused exclusively on gay men, with no representation of lesbians. Reavis expressed his reluctance to include lesbians in his proposal: [...] Commercial stations turned down the program, as did sponsors. KQED bought the project in early 1961 under the new title. The documentary was shot entirely in the KQED studio except for one segment on location at the Black Cat Bar, a San Francisco gay bar that had been fighting state and police harassment since 1948. Reavis and co-producer Irving Saraf filmed The Rejected on a budget of less than $100.|$|E
500|$|In March 2016, the {{discovery}} team {{agreed on a}} conference call involving representatives from the parties involved on the name [...] "tennessine" [...] for element 117. In June 2016, IUPAC published a declaration stating the discoverers had submitted their suggestions for naming the new elements 115, 117, and 118 to the IUPAC; the suggestion for the element 117 was tennessine, with a symbol of Ts, after [...] "the region of Tennessee". The suggested names were recommended for acceptance by the IUPAC Inorganic Chemistry Division; formal acceptance was set to occur after a five-months term following publishing of the declaration expires. In November 2016, the names, including tennessine, were formally accepted. Concerns that the proposed symbol Ts may clash with a notation for the tosyl group used in organic chemistry were rejected, following existing symbols <b>bearing</b> <b>such</b> dual meanings: Ac (actinium and acetyl) and Pr (praseodymium and propyl).|$|E

50|$|Oil {{pressure}} {{is an important}} factor in the longevity of most internal combustion engines. With a forced lubrication system (invented by Frederick Lanchester), oil is picked up by a positive displacement oil pump and forced through oil galleries (passageways) into <b>bearings,</b> <b>such</b> as the main bearings, big end bearings and camshaft bearings or balance shaft <b>bearings.</b> Other components <b>such</b> as cam lobes and cylinder walls are lubricated by oil jets.|$|R
50|$|However, in {{lightly loaded}} <b>bearings,</b> <b>such</b> as disk drives, the typical ball bearing {{stiffnesses}} are ~10^7 MN/m. Comparable fluid bearings have stiffness of ~10^6 MN/m. Because of this, some fluid bearings, particularly hydrostatic bearings, are deliberately designed to pre-load the bearing {{to increase the}} stiffness.|$|R
50|$|Thrust {{bearings}} {{are used}} to support axial loads, such as vertical shafts. Common designs are Thrust ball bearings, spherical roller thrust bearings, tapered roller thrust bearings or cylindrical roller thrust bearings.

2500|$|In situ bitumen production: Many {{companies}} {{experimented with}} thermal techniques to produce heavy {{oil from the}} oilsands, especially in the Cold Lake oilsands deposit, in the 1970s and 1980s. <b>Bearing</b> <b>such</b> field-hand monikers as [...] "steam flood", [...] "fire flood" [...] and [...] "huff and puff" [...] techniques, these extraction methods - like the Barber Asphalt and Paving Company's 1910 experiment - essentially apply heat to the underground reservoir. This melts the oil - that is, decreases its viscosity - {{so it can be}} pumped to the surface. An increasingly successful system now in use is steam assisted gravity drainage (SAGD).|$|E

During the war, it was an unofficial practice of some Bengali nationalists to protest Pakistani rule by stamping banknotes with [...] "" [...] and [...] "BANGLA DESH" [...] as two words in either Bangla or English. These locally produced stamps are known to exist in several varieties, as are forgeries. On 8 June 1971, the Pakistani government declared that all banknotes <b>bearing</b> <b>such</b> stamps ceased to be legal tender. Furthermore, to prevent looted high-denomination notes from disrupting the Pakistani economy, the government also withdrew the legal tender status of all 100- and 500-rupee notes.|$|E
2500|$|The Normans had a {{profound}} effect on Irish culture and history after their invasion at Bannow Bay in 1169. Initially, the Normans maintained a distinct culture and ethnicity. Yet, with time, they came to be subsumed into Irish culture to the point that it has been said that they became [...] "more Irish than the Irish themselves". The Normans settled mostly in an area in the east of Ireland, later known as the Pale, and also built many fine castles and settlements, including Trim Castle and Dublin Castle. Both cultures intermixed, borrowing from each other's language, culture and outlook. Norman descendants today can be recognised by their surnames. Names such as French, (De) Roche, Devereux, D'Arcy, Treacy and Lacy are particularly common in the southeast of Ireland, especially in the southern part of County Wexford, where the first Norman settlements were established. Other Norman names, such as Furlong, predominate there. Another common Norman-Irish name was Morell (Murrell), derived from the French Norman name Morel. Names beginning with Fitz (from the Norman for son) indicate Norman ancestry. These included Fitzgerald, FitzGibbons (Gibbons) dynasty, Fitzmaurice. Families <b>bearing</b> <b>such</b> surnames as Barry (de Barra) and De Búrca (Burke) are also of Norman extraction.|$|E
