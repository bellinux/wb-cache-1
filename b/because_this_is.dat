5|$|Charles Darwin {{had argued}} that {{humanity}} evolved in Africa, <b>because</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> where great apes like gorillas and chimpanzees lived. Though Darwin's claims have since been vindicated by the fossil record, they were proposed without any fossil evidence. Other scientific authorities disagreed with him, like Charles Lyell, a geologist, and Alfred Russel Wallace, who had thought {{of the theory of}} evolution around the same time as Darwin. Because both Lyell and Wallace believed that humans were more closely related to gibbons and orangutans, they identified Southeast Asia as the cradle of humanity <b>because</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> where these apes lived. Dutch anatomist Eugène Dubois favored the latter theory, and sought to confirm it.|$|E
5|$|For males, {{selection}} of the best breeders is more complex. The first step is weaning, when the morphology of calves and the known qualities of their parents are used to make an initial {{selection of}} animals that receive the qualification Reproductive Hope (in French Reproducteur Espoir, abbreviated to Espoir). Annually in excess of about 700 bull calves are then selected to enter the national evaluation station at , close {{to the city of}} Limoges in central France, just after weaning, when they are about seven months old. At Lanaud the animals are grouped together to compare their performance under identical feeding and environmental conditions to the age of 13–14 months. The differences observed between the animals are then related principally to their genetics, which is of interest to breeders <b>because</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> what is transmitted to a bull's progeny.|$|E
5000|$|On this {{particular}} year various {{people who have}} helped the Gauls against the Romans in previous books have been invited along with their wives (<b>this</b> may <b>be</b> <b>because</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> the last story published in Pilote magazine, or <b>because</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> the 20th album).

25|$|In general, {{the rider}} should use half-halts as {{the horse is}} raising its head and neck upward (during the {{suspension}} phase), <b>because</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> when the horse is engaging its hindquarters.|$|E

25|$|Ramaswami's {{family name}} appears {{variously}} as Cota, Cotah and Cotar - Cota {{being the most}} common version. This article uses Cotah as the title <b>because</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> the version used by Ramaswami in his memoirs.|$|E

25|$|Spring is {{the peak}} season for tick {{paralysis}} <b>because</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> when the ticks molt and develop {{into the final}} adult stage of their life cycle (it is the adult stage that also produces the most toxins during feeding). Sporadic cases of tick paralysis, however, can occur all year, even in mid-winter.|$|E

25|$|When in space, {{the purpose}} of a {{propulsion}} system is to change the velocity, or v, of a spacecraft. <b>Because</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> more difficult for more massive spacecraft, designers generally discuss momentum, mv. The amount of change in momentum is called impulse. So the goal of a propulsion method in space is to create an impulse.|$|E
25|$|Because {{there are}} four state variables, {{visualizing}} the path in phase space can be difficult. Usually two variables are chosen, voltage v(t) and the potassium gating variable n(t), allowing one to visualize the limit cycle. However, one must be careful <b>because</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> an ad-hoc method of visualizing the 4-dimensional system. This does not prove {{the existence of the}} limit cycle.|$|E
25|$|The {{children}} of any vertex in the Calkin–Wilf tree may be computed by inverting {{the formula for}} {{the parents of a}} vertex. Each vertex a/b has one child whose value is less than 1, a/(a+b), <b>because</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> the only value less than 1 whose parent formula leads back to a/b. Similarly, each vertex a/b has one child whose value is greater than 1, (a+b)/b.|$|E

25|$|Because a large {{proportion}} of stars exist in binary systems, binaries are particularly important {{to our understanding of the}} processes by which stars form. In particular, the period and masses of the binary tell us about the amount of angular momentum in the system. <b>Because</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> a conserved quantity in physics, binaries give us important clues about the conditions under which the stars were formed.|$|E
25|$|Today, rows {{of turkey}} houses line the runways. {{isolated}} {{from each other}} <b>because</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> an important requirement in escaping the infectious diseases to which turkeys are prone. The runways, perimeter track, {{and a few of}} the hardstands remain as does the control tower, now extensively renovated and used as offices by the owners of the airfield site. The briefing room and HQ block still exist, the latter being used as a private house.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, a 32 kHz {{sampling}} rate {{was used in}} broadcast (esp. in UK and Japan), <b>because</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> sufficient for FM stereo broadcasts, which had 15 kHz bandwidth.|$|R

25|$|In the Weekly Maqam, Sephardi Jews {{each week}} base {{the songs of}} the {{services}} {{on the content of}} that week's parashah. For parashah Devarim, Sephardi Jews apply Maqam Hijaz, the maqam that expresses mourning and sadness. This maqam is appropriate not due to the content of the parashah, but <b>because</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> the parashah that falls on the Shabbat prior to Tisha B'Av, the date that marks the destruction of the Temples.|$|E
25|$|Further, many {{prominent}} Acharyas {{have raised}} temples in this tirtha and have composed works also. In many places there are ancient pieces of art <b>because</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> an ancient town. In Bharuch, we are shown the Ashvavabodha tirtha {{of the times}} of Muni Suvrata Swami, Shakunika Vihara of princess Sudarshana of Simhaladvipa and also the Vihara which was ceremoniously raised by Acharya Hemchandra in which Kumarapala has waved ARATI; is now converted into a mosque.|$|E

Mandy finds a sick seal pup and decided the only way to save the pup is to take it through the mirror, but trouble ensues.|$|E
