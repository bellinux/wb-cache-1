5|$|Rowland (2009) {{identified}} {{an additional}} mechanism of countershading not previously analysed, namely that a round <b>body</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> cylinder illuminated and seen from above {{appears to have}} dark sides. Using a graphics tool, she demonstrated that this effect can be flattened out by countershading. Since predators are known to use edges to identify prey, countershading may therefore, she argues, make prey harder to detect when seen from above.|$|E

5|$|Biomechanical {{studies by}} Ken Carpenter in 2002 {{confirmed}} that the most likely function of the forelimbs in predation was grasping, as their great lengths would have permitted longer reach than for most other theropods. The rather large and elongated coracoid, indicating powerful muscles in the forelimbs, further strengthened this interpretation. Carpenter's biomechanical studies using bone casts also showed that Deinonychus could not fold its arms against its <b>body</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> bird ("avian folding"), contrary to what was inferred from the earlier 1985 descriptions by Jacques Gauthier and Gregory S. Paul in 1988.|$|E

25|$|Over {{the upper}} part of their bodies, both medieval men and women usually wore a {{close-fitting}} shirt-like garment called a chemise in France, or a smock or shift in England. The forerunner of the modern-day shirt, the chemise was tucked into a man's braies, under his outer clothing. Women wore a chemise underneath their gowns or robes, sometimes with petticoats over the chemise. Elaborately quilted petticoats might be displayed by a cut-away dress, in which case they served a skirt rather than an undergarment. During the 16th century, the farthingale was popular. This was a petticoat stiffened with reed or willow rods so that it stood out from a woman's <b>body</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> cone extending from the waist.|$|E

2500|$|Both novels {{deal with}} an almost [...] "primitive tech" [...] {{replacing}} a current, worldwide use technology, {{in the sense of}} the reprogramming of the mind through ancient Sumerian chanting in Snow Crash (which also uses allusions to Babylonian prostitutes passing an information virus like a sexually transmitted disease), and the idea of nanotechnology propagating and communicating through sexual intercourse, passing from body to <b>body</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> virus. Both novels use an ancient, almost primitive threat to modern, [...] "Western" [...] technology and ideology (The Raft in Snow Crash and The Fists of Righteous Harmony in The Diamond Age). Stephenson explores the idea of the tech divide and its social and economic ramifications to the extreme using these violent, but not surprising, social revolutions.|$|E
2500|$|Of course, {{much of this}} is untrue, or a gross exaggeration. Men's formal {{clothing}} {{may have}} been less colourful {{than it was in the}} previous century, but brilliant waistcoats and cummerbunds provided a touch of color, and smoking jackets and dressing gowns were often of rich Oriental brocades. This phenomenon was the result of the growing textile manufacturing sector, developing mass production processes, and increasing attempts to market fashion to men. [...] Corsets stressed a woman's sexuality, exaggerating hips and bust by contrast with a tiny waist. Women's evening gowns bared the shoulders and the tops of the breasts. The jersey dresses of the 1880s may have covered the body, but the stretchy novel fabric fit the <b>body</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> glove.|$|E

2500|$|After being {{posted in}} 1869 to Puri as a deputy magistrate, Kedarnatha Datta felt he needed {{assistance}} in {{his attempts to}} promote the cause Gaudiya Vaisnavism in India and abroad. A hagiographic account has it that one night the Deity of Jagannath personally spoke to Kedarnath in a dream: [...] "I didn't bring you to Puri to execute legal matters, but to establish Vaishnava siddhanta." [...] Kedarnath replied, [...] "Your teachings have been significantly [...] depreciated, and I lack the power to restore them. Much of my life has passed and I am otherwise engaged, so please send somebody from Your personal staff so that I can start this movement". Jagannath then requested Kedarnath to pray for an assistant {{to the image of}} the Goddess Bimala Devi worshiped in the Jagannath temple. When his wife gave birth to a new child, Kedarnath linked the event to the divinatory dream and named his son Bimala Prasad ('"the mercy of Bimala Devi").

2500|$|While Kedarnath Datta {{was able}} to favourably {{influence}} many bhadraloks hitherto skeptical towards Gaudiya Vaishnavism of Caitanya, he felt in need of assistance. When his wife {{gave birth to a}} new child, Kedarnath linked the event to the divinatory dream and named his son Bimala Prasad ('"the mercy of Bimala Devi"). The same account mentions that at his birth, the child's umbilical cord was looped around his <b>body</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> sacred brahmana thread (upavita) that left a permanent mark on the skin, as if foretelling his future role as religious leader. In the early 1880s, Kedarnath Datta, out of desire to foster the child's budding interest in spirituality, initiated him into harinama-japa. [...] At the age of nine Bimala Prasad memorised the seven hundred verses of the Bhagavad Gita in Sanskrit. From his early childhood Bimala Prasad demonstrated a sense of strict moral behavior, a sharp intelligence, and an eidetic memory. He gained a reputation for remembering passages from a book on a single reading, and soon learned enough to compose his own poetry in Sanskrit. Bhaktisiddhanta's biographers write that even up to his last days Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati could verbatim recall passages from books that he had read in his childhood, earning the epithet [...] "living encyclopedia". Bimala Prasad later became known as Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati.|$|E
2500|$|Known as the Balloon Pokémon, Jigglypuff {{is shaped}} like a round ball, with pink skin, large blue or green eyes, catlike ears, and a tuft of fur on its forehead. Its skin is rubbery and stretchy. It can inflate its <b>body</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> balloon (usually when it becomes angry; this is {{accompanied}} by a distinctive [...] "honk" [...] sound), or flatten its body, much like fellow Nintendo character Kirby. An exact limit to the size it can grow to in this manner is unknown. Jigglypuff are characterized by putting their enemies to sleep by singing a lullaby. Before beginning to sing, they mesmerize the opponent with their soft, glowing eyes, and if they inflate themselves, they can sing for longer periods of time. They can easily adjust the wavelength of their voices to that of the brain waves of a sleeping being, allowing for their pleasing melody to put its audience to sleep. They sing without pausing to take a breath, so if the opponent is resistant to sleeping, they potentially run out of air. Game Freak's staff have noted Jigglypuff as both one of their and the public's favorite Pokémon, in terms of both anime and video game appearances.|$|E

2500|$|An acute {{question}} for the TUPE Regulations, particularly in the years when the Conservative government was implementing a policy of shrinking {{the size of the}} public sector, was the extent they applied to jobs being outsourced, typically by a public <b>body,</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> local council, or changed between businesses in a competitive tender process for public procurement. On this point a series of ECJ decisions came to the view {{that there could be a}} relevant transfer, covered by the Directive, even where there was no contractual link between a transferor and a transferee business, so long as the business entity retained its [...] "identity". In turn the [...] "identity" [...] of a business would be determined by the degree to which the business' factors of production remained the same before and after a sale. It could be that no employees were hired after an asset sale, but the sacked employees would still have a claim because all their old workplace and capital equipment was being used by the new employer. It is also relevant to what extent a business is capital or labour-intensive. So in Oy Liikenne Ab v Liskojärvi the ECJ held that it was unlikely that 45 Helsinki bus drivers' contracts were transferred, between the company that lost the contract and the new bus company that won it, even though 33 drivers were rehired, because [...] "bus transport cannot be regarded as an activity based essentially on manpower". On the other hand, employees will benefit when a new employer offers old staff their jobs, the intention to rehire makes it more likely the court will deem there to be a transfer.|$|E
