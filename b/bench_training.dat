40|$|Click on the DOI link {{below to}} access the article (may not be free) The optical <b>bench</b> <b>training</b> of an optical {{feedforward}} neural network, developed by the authors, is presented. The network uses an optical nonlinear material for neuron processing and a trainable applied optical pattern as the network weights. The nonlinear material, with the applied weight pattern, modulates the phase front of a forward propagating information beam by dynamically altering the index of refraction profile of the material. To verify that the network can be trained in real time, six logic gates were trained using a reinforcement training paradigm. More importantly, to demonstrate optical backpropagation, three gates were trained via optical error backpropagation. The output error is optically backpropagated, detected with a CCD camera, and the weight pattern is updated and stored on a computer. The obtained results lay the ground work {{for the implementation of}} multilayer neural networks that are trained using optical error backpropagation and are able to solve more complex problems.

40|$|BackgroundVascular {{anastomosis}} is {{a complex}} task that requires multiple skills. Existing training methods lack the ability to objectively quantify surgical skill. In this study we tested a new vascular anastomosis model for <b>bench</b> <b>training.</b> Materials and methodsSurgical performance was assessed based on the new vascular anastomosis training model. Thirty- eight {{subjects were asked to}} (1) close the end of a 6 -mm polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) graft, using a continuous suturing technique with 6 - 0 polypropylene; (2) perform end-to-end and (3) end-to-side anastomosis using the same materials and techniques. ResultsThe mean age (sd) of all participants was 28. 3 (2. 1) years. More surgically experienced trainees did better in all measures of technical skill. Although there was a tendency for those with previous experience with the training model to do better in terms of the technical outcomes, these differences were not statistically significant. Multivariable analysis revealed that level of surgical training and type of anastomosis were the only significant factors related to completion time. ConclusionsOur study confirmed the impact of increasing surgical experience on the technical skills of surgical trainees. Trainees with higher levels of training made fewer errors and completed the procedures faster than those with lower levels of training...|$|E
40|$|The International Institute of Biological Control (IIBC) is {{a nonprofit}} {{organization}} which aims to support the development of biological control and integrated pest management worldwide. Since its establishment in 1927 IIBC has provided a unique service, through research, training {{and the provision of}} advice and information. IIBC is an institute of CAB International, an intergovernmental organization comprising 36 member countries, which provides services to agriculture, forestry, human health and the management of natural resources through provision of information and associated technical services. IIBC headquarters and project activities in the UK are located at Silwood Park, Ascot. A purpose-built facility completed in 1988, the new building includes constant temperature rooms and a quarantine unit c equipped for work on insects and pathogens. Together with the quarantine greenhouse opened in 1986, this has greatly expanded the institute's capacity to undertake intermediate quarantine of biological control agents being moved from one tropical region to another. The new building houses the IIBC Training and Information Unit and the CABI Library Services Centre, and provides facilities for visiting research workers and trainees. The principal activity of IIBC is to undertake research and development projects on contract for governments, international and bilateral development agencies, research foundations and commercial interests in agriculture. To carry this out the institute operates through seven bases around the world, most of them linked to leading national research institutes. IIBC staff from over 13 countries advise on over 80 separate projects a year. Their experts are available to advise on pest ecology; biology of natural enemies, their production, handling, shipment and release for classical biological control. Staff can also advise on the preparation of proposals which may range from research on techniques and the feasibility of applying biological controls, to the implementation of biological control and integrated pest management programmes. IIBC undertakes investigations on conservation of natural enemies of insect and other arthropod pests and weeds. Current research programmes include: · Characterization screening and supply of insects and pathogens for control of major pasture weeds and weeds in environmentally sensitive areas. · Research on the natural enemies of pests of temperate and tropical foresty. · Integrated pest management implementation programmes in vegetables, cotton, coffee and rice. · Development of a fungal pesticide for control of locusts and grasshoppers in Africa. · Investigations on the control of pests of cassava, sweet potato and Irish potato for the Eastern and Southern Africa Root Crops Research Network. Transfer of technology {{is an important part of}} the activities of IIBC and short courses are given on biological control and pest management, which are conducted at the institutes own field stations or at collaborating institutions in developing countries. Customized, illustrated manuals are prepared for training courses, as well as special self-training packages. Recently, IIBC has begun to work with national programmes and FAO on the development of training materials for farmers, to help them discover and appreciate the role of natural enemies in their crops. In addition to providing training courses, IIBC cooperates with universities in Europe, Africa, Asia and Latin America to support degree-level training in biological control, and to organize <b>bench</b> <b>training</b> in specialized techniques for scientists and technicians sponsored by their own institutions or through training grants. In 1993 IIBC established its Training Information and Policy Support group (TIPS) to meet the diversifying demand for training and information on biological control. TIPS is expanding IlBC's current activities to include information materials and training for non-specialists, in forms such as handbooks, posters and concise summaries of key areas of biological control activity. It will place particular emphasis on information useful to the development of national and international policy in biological control and IPM. Developing and implementing biological control is frequently constrained by lack of information on the identity of natural enemies, their biology, evaluation, production and use. IIBC makes available information on all aspects of biological control with the backing of the CAB ABSTRACTS database. Its Information Unit at Silwood Park also has the resources of an unrivalled plant protection library and access to specialist knowledge from staff at the other CAB International institutes and collaborating institutes. IIBC compiles its own abstract journal, Biocontrol News and Information, which comprehensively surveys biological control research on a quarterly basis, and provides critical reviews and a regular news section. IIBC also maintains a global database of biological control introductions against insect pests, which practitioners consult. Where identification of natural enemies is required, IIBC depends on CABI's biosytematic institutes: the International Institute of Entomology (IIE), International Institute of Parasitology (IIP) and International Mycological Institute (IMI). These Institutes provide a worldwide service for the identification of pests and natural enemies, particularly to developing countries. To do this, they draw upon some of the most extensive collections of insects, pathogens and nematodes in the world. Beyond identifications, the biosystems institutes produce guides and computerized keys to pests and natural enemies, monitor the global movements of exotic pests and undertake biochemical research into the taxonomy of difficult groups. To reach as wide an audience as possible, and to inform the public on environmentally sound options in pest management, IIBC also promotes biological control through the printed media, radio, film and television, and assists in the development of schools' curricula.

40|$|SummaryObjectiveAlthough several inanimate bench {{models have}} been {{described}} for training of suture skills, so far, there is no ideal method for teaching and learning this skill during medical education. The aim was to evaluate whether bench model fidelity interferes in the acquisition of suture skills by novice medical students. Methods 36 medical students with no surgical skills' background (novices) were randomized to three groups (n= 12) : theoretical suture training alone (control); low-fidelity suture training model (synthetic ethylene-vinyl acetate bench model); or high-fidelity suture training model (pig feet skin bench model). Pre- and post-tests were applied (performance of simple interrupted sutures and subdermal interrupted sutures on ox tongue). Three tools (Global Rating Scale with blinded assessment, effect size, and self-perceived confidence based on Likert scale) were used to measure all suture performances. ResultsThe post-training analysis showed that the students that practiced on <b>bench</b> models (hands-on <b>training)</b> presented better (all p 0. 80) in all measurements. Students felt more confident (all p< 0. 0000) to perform both types of sutures after training.
