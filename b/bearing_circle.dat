30|$|Since {{the time}} bolting was {{determined}} to be an effective method for securing rocks surrounding a roadway, a number of studies examined the performance of rock bolts both in the laboratory and in the field (Aydan 1989; Farmer 1975; Peng and Tang 1984; Stille et al. 1989; Sun 1984; Kang et al. 2015; Zhang et al. 2015). Analytical studies were also conducted to examine the influence of relevant parameters and to understand the interaction between the rock and the bolt (Dight 1982; Indraratna and Kaiser 1990; Holmberg 1991; Li and Stillborg 1999; Bobet 2002; Cai et al. 2004; Carranza-Torres 2009; Bobet and Einstein 2011). And there have been many investigations on bolting mechanisms, ranging from the initial suspension theory to the subsequent composite beam theory, compound arch theory, strength hardening theory and maximum horizontal principal stress theory (Hou and Gou 2000; Mark et al. 2007), and loosing-circle theory of surrounding rocks (Dong et al. 1994). The conclusion that bolting improves the load-bearing capability of the surrounding rock has been stated and confirmed in many studies. For roadways supported by bolts in the rock, different support structures for the surrounding rock have been suggested: e.g., the surrounding rock <b>bearing</b> <b>circle</b> proposed by Kang (1996, 1997), the internal and external <b>bearing</b> <b>circle</b> proposed by Li (2008), the support structure inside the roadway’s coal roof proposed by Zhang and Li (1999), the compound arch bearing structure by Yu et al. (2010), and reinforced rock by Song and Mu (1997), among others (Wu and Chai 1997; Zhu et al. 2000; Zhang et al. 2015; Cheng et al. 2015).However, few studies have investigated the load-bearing characteristics of a structure formed from both bolts and the surrounding rocks and the effect of the structure on the overall load-bearing capacity of the surrounding rocks. There are even fewer studies considering the effect of the bolt parameters on the load-bearing characteristics of such a structure.|$|E
40|$|The static {{characteristics}} of a tri-taper journal bearing are studied. The geometry {{is similar to that}} for a tri-lobe journal bearing and is akin to three-tapered land composite thrust bearings arranged around a <b>bearing</b> <b>circle.</b> There are three lubricant supply grooves equally spaced around the bearing periphery. Each of the three sections consists of equal lengths of the bearing base circle and a section offset from the base circle such that it merges smoothly with the base circle and provides a predetermined depth at or near to the lubricant supply groove. Performance characteristics such as load carrying capacity, power loss and lubricant flow rate of the tri-taper journal bearing are obtained by the solution of the Reynolds equation using a finite difference method and accommodating Jacobsons -Floberg-Olsson boundary conditions for iso-viscous and laminar flow. The lubricant film profile is determined by superimposing the effect of the ramp on the conventional expression for the film thickness in a journal bearing. Typical characteristics obtained are presented which will be useful to the designer...|$|E
