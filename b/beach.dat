5|$|NYC Ferry {{operates}} three {{shuttle bus}} routes. One is a preexisting NY Waterway {{service to the}} East 34th Street landing. The other two are brand-new services to the Rockaway landing, which is at <b>Beach</b> 108th Street. One route goes west to Jacob Riis Park, while the other was originally planned for operation between the ferry landing and <b>Beach</b> 67th Street, but was ultimately extended eastward. The Environmental Impact Statement provided for {{an extension of the}} <b>Beach</b> 67th Street bus to <b>Beach</b> 31st Street via Rockaway <b>Beach</b> Boulevard and <b>Beach</b> Channel Drive, but de Blasio's office said that extending the bus further would cause a bus fleet shortage, resulting in passengers missing their boats. As of June 2017, the East Shuttle bus only runs to <b>Beach</b> 35th Street.|$|E
5|$|Plans for freeways in Los Angeles County {{evolved from}} a 1937 Automobile Club of Southern California plan, which was {{modified}} by the city's Transportation Engineering Board (TEB) in 1939. The former included a single freeway connecting Los Angeles to Long <b>Beach,</b> beginning at Pasadena and heading south-southwest to Lynwood, then paralleling Long <b>Beach</b> Boulevard to Long <b>Beach.</b> The TEB's plan shifted this route farther east to near the present Long <b>Beach</b> Freeway, while keeping the route near Long <b>Beach</b> Boulevard as a second freeway leaving the Ramona Parkway (San Bernardino Freeway) east of downtown and heading south near Alameda Street and Long <b>Beach</b> Boulevard to Long <b>Beach.</b> This second freeway {{came to be known}} as the Long <b>Beach</b> Parkway or Alamitos Parkway, and connected in north Long <b>Beach</b> with a Terminal Island Freeway southwest to Terminal Island. Because the Long <b>Beach</b> Naval Shipyard was located on the island, the U.S. Navy paid for the construction of the $14 million freeway from the island to Willow Street, including the $5.3 million Schuyler Heim Lift Bridge. Construction began in early 1946, and the completed link was dedicated on January 10, 1948, replacing the older Henry Ford Bridge.|$|E

5|$|Although it {{remained}} far from land, the waves triggered by Liza {{were able to}} reach California, where they combined with high tide, threatening beachfront homes that had weakened foundations after a previous tide. The hurricane was responsible for sweeping hundreds of Labor Day swimmers out into the ocean in Zuma <b>Beach</b> and Newport <b>Beach,</b> {{all of whom were}} saved by lifeguards.

5|$|As {{the ships}} were {{traveling}} to the <b>beach,</b> the heavy seas, combined with {{the chaos of the}} fighting caused most of the landing force to be thrown off-course and most of the 116th Infantry missed its landing spots. Most of the regiment's tank support, launched from too far off-shore, foundered and sank in the channel. The soldiers of the 116th Infantry were the first to hit the <b>beach</b> at 0630, coming under heavy fire from German fortifications. Company A of the 1st Battalion, 116th Infantry, from the Virginia National Guard in Bedford, Virginia was annihilated by overwhelming fire as it landed on the 116th's westernmost section of the <b>beach,</b> along with half of Company C of the 2nd Ranger Battalion which was landing {{to the west of the}} 116th. The catastrophic losses suffered by this small Virginia community led to it being selected for the site of the National D-Day Memorial. The 1st Infantry Division's forces ran into similar fortifications on the eastern half of the <b>beach,</b> suffering massive casualties coming ashore. By 0830, the landings were called off for lack of space on the <b>beach,</b> as the Americans on Omaha <b>Beach</b> were unable to overcome German fortifications guarding the <b>beach</b> exits. Lieutenant General Omar Nelson Bradley, commanding the American First Army, considered evacuating the survivors and landing the rest of the divisions elsewhere. However, by noon, elements of the American forces had been able to organize and advance off the <b>beach,</b> and the landings resumed. By nightfall, the division headquarters landed on the <b>beach</b> with about 60 percent of the division's total strength, and began organizing the push inland. On 7 June, a second wave of 20,000 reinforcements from both the 1st and 29th Divisions was sent ashore. By the end of D-Day, 2,400 men from the two divisions had become casualties on Omaha <b>Beach.</b> Added to casualties at other beaches and air-drops made the total casualties for the Normandy landings 6,500 Americans and 3,000 British and Canadians, lighter numbers than expected.|$|E

Before the <b>beaches</b> were desegregated homeowners claimed the <b>beaches</b> as private property, and although the <b>beaches</b> were built by the Army Corps of Engineers using taxpayer funds, African Americans were restricted to designated areas of the beachfront.

5|$|Edisto <b>Beach,</b> South Carolina {{was changed}} forever by Gracie, due to human efforts to renourish the <b>beach</b> after its passage. Most {{of the shell}} hash <b>beach</b> {{currently}} at Edisto was placed there after Gracie. In order to expand the <b>beach,</b> an inland marsh was excavated {{and moved to the}} shoreline. This created highly desirable <b>beach</b> front property which led to new development along the coast seaward of Palmetto Boulevard, but also created an environmental catastrophe along the nearby ocean floor. A species of isopod which grows in coastal estuaries, the Cyathura Polita, disappeared after the passage of this hurricane from the Ashepoo River in South Carolina. The Kermadec petrel, a bird, was swept to Lookout Mountain Sanctuary in Pennsylvania during Gracie, marking the first time it appeared in North America.|$|E
