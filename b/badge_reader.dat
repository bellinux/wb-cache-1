40|$|The {{collection}} and archiving {{of data from}} personnel dosimeters has become increasingly important {{in light of the}} lowered threshold limit values (TLV) for hydrazine (HZ), monomethylhydrazine (MMH), and unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (UDMH). The American Conference of Government Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) lowered the TLV from 100 parts per billion (ppb) to 10 ppb and has caused increased concern over long term exposures of personnel to trace levels of these hypergols and other potentially harmful chemicals. An automated system of reading the exposure levels of personnel dosimeters and storing exposure data for subsequent evaluation has been developed. The reading of personnel dosimeter badges for exposure lo potentially harmful vapor concentrations of hydrazines or other chemicals is performed visually by comparing the color developed by the badge with a calibrated color comparator. The result obtained using visual comparisons of the developed badge color with the comparator may vary widely from user to user. The automated <b>badge</b> <b>reader</b> takes the variability out of the dosimeter reading by accurately comparing the reflectance obtained from a colored spot on the badge with a reading on the same spot prior to any exposure to chemical vapors. The observed difference between the reflectance values is used as part of a calculation of the dose value for the badge based on a stored calibration curve. The <b>badge</b> <b>reader</b> also stores bar-code data unique to each badge, as well as bar-code information on the user, as part of the permanent badge record. The start and stop exposure times for each badge are recorded and can be used as part of the calculated concentration, in ppm, for each badge logged during a recording period. The <b>badge</b> <b>reader</b> is equipped with a number of badge holders, each of which is unique to a specific type of personnel dosimeter badge. This gives the reader maximum flexibility to allow for the reading of several different types of badges. Test results of the <b>badge</b> <b>reader</b> for several different types of personnel dosimeter badges are presented within the body of this paper...|$|E

The model parameters are from an experiment carried out in 2009 [59]; in more details, P 0 =− 49, α= 3.3, and σdB= 5.5. The sensitivity of the WSN receiver is set to − 90 dBm, which determines the connectivity of two WSN nodes. A badge event is generated by the <b>badge</b> <b>reader</b> when a badge passes through the doors.

40|$|Abstract. Robust {{identification}} and localization of moving objects {{depends on the}} quality of sensors, sensor coverage and the fusion of the information obtained from the sensors. Sensor fusion algorithms use domain and context knowledge to calculate the most plausible interpretation of all available data. Little research has been done on the trade-offs between these factors. This paper presents an empirical study of these trade-offs for a sensor fusion algorithm BBP based on Bayesian forward and backward propagation. To test the robustness of this algorithm under various conditions, we created “virtual sensors ” whose performance characteristics were based on the data gathered by tracking 31 people in 112 locations using a set of 34 cameras and 91 <b>badge</b> <b>readers.</b> Our Monte Carlo simulations show that given good domain knowledge, BBP performs robustly even in the presence of poor sensors, thus providing a promising alternative to the expensive practice of installing better sensors and calibration procedures in order to improve surveillance systems...|$|R

Stability and capabilities of EPICS software have motivated increasing use of EPICS for accelerator controls. In addition, very inexpensive subsystems based on EPICS and the EPICS portable CA server running on Linux PCs have been implemented to control an ion source test facility and to control a building-access <b>badge</b> <b>reader</b> system. A new object-oriented, extensible display manager has been developed for EPICS to facilitate the transition to EPICS and {{will be used in}} place of MEDM.

30|$|Figure 5 {{shows the}} {{tracking}} result of one realization, where only the estimated positions of hcEKF and EKF related to mobile node M 3 are plotted {{to avoid an}} overcrowded figure. Thanks to the HF badge detection, the hcEKF is accurately initialized, while the EKF has to be initialized to the coordinates of the scenario’s center because it can only use RSSI measures. When M 3 is in the corridor, the EKF diverges due to the bad geometry of the WSN anchor deployment while the hcEKF is able to follow the real trajectory thanks to hybridization of RFID detection and the cooperation with the other mobile nodes. When M 3 approaches room 2, the standard EKF diverges again while the hcEKF is still able to track the mobile by fusing measurements from HF <b>badge</b> <b>reader</b> and UHF-RFID tag reader.|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} aspects of a TLD dosimetry system is the dose algorithm used to convert the signals from the <b>badge</b> <b>reader</b> to an estimate of a worker`s dose. It is now more important then ever to have an accurate algorithm to estimate dose well below regulatory limits. Dosimetry systems for DOE laboratories must meet minimum performance standards based on DOELAP criteria. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to describe the development of a dose algorithm for a new TLD dosimeter that has been developed at Los Alamos National Laboratories. It is expected that DOELAP testing will start in 1995. Initial results indicate that the system will be able to exceed the minimum performance criteria by a large margin. The enhanced ability of the dosimeter to determine beta, gamma, and neutron energies makes it very useful in the various radiation fields encountered at the laboratory...|$|E

30|$|Position estimation. In {{this step}} the hybrid {{location}} engine estimates {{the positions of}} mobile nodes by using location information and measurements which are provided by the previous two steps. Moreover, a cooperation scheme is applied where the location engine, apart from RSSI measurements from anchors, uses also RSSI measurements performed between mobile nodes, since two mobile WSN nodes are {{able to communicate with}} each other and to perform corresponding RSSI observations. The adoption of cooperation improves not only the positioning accuracy but also system robustness (i.e., position estimation availability), as more measurements are available to localize the mobile nodes. Nevertheless, the cooperation can be merely applicable to mobile nodes equipped with WSN devices, because both UHF-RFID tag and HF badge are passive devices and cannot communicate with other passive devices for range or range-related observations. Since the HF badge can be detected by the reader in a very short distance (e.g., a few centimeters), this badge detection event can be seen as quite accurate localization information. In principle, whenever an HF badge is detected, the estimated position of the associated mobile node is set to the HF reader’s position, and other observations (e.g., RSSI or UHF-RFID detections) are ignored. Since the HF <b>badge</b> <b>readers</b> are only installed at the door, mainly for the purpose of access control, they provide only sporadic detection events. In most of the time, the hybrid location engine relies on RSSI measurements from WSN devices and UHF-RFID events for localization.|$|R
3000|$|..., {{the hybrid}} {{location}} engine queries the DB about the location information {{for all the}} devices. In more detail, the location information includes the unique device ID and the corresponding device category (e.g., WSN, UHF RFID, or HF RFID). For simplicity, the device ID is a five-digit number and is general for all the device. For each device there is a flag which indicates if it is fixed or mobile. A fixed device may be either a WSN anchor, a UHF-RFID antenna, or an HF <b>badge</b> <b>reader</b> whose positions are perfectly known and are stored in the DB; while a mobile device is a movable node whose position is not known. In addition, the device association information is read. As mentioned above, a mobile node may be equipped with different RF devices and the association information specifies how different RF devices are bound with together. The association information is useful, since in the DB an observation (a RSSI measurement and a detection of UHF tag or HF badge) is only related to a single RF device.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Large {{displays}} {{have several}} natural affordances that can simplify small group collaborative work. They are {{large enough to}} hold multiple work areas, they are easy to see and can be manipulated directly via touch. When placed into group and public spaces, such displays create pervasively available working surfaces for lightweight, temporary walkup use. The BlueBoard is a large plasma display with touch sensing and a <b>badge</b> <b>reader</b> to identify individuals using the board. The onboard software acts as a thin client giving access to each participant’s web-based content (e. g., home pages, project pages). The client also has a set of tools and mechanisms that support rapid exchange of content between those present. The overall design of the BlueBoard is one that is easily learnable (under 5 minutes), very simple to use, and permits novel uses for collaboration. Our initial field study revealed a number of social issues about the use of a large pervasively available display surface, yet indicates that a shared public display space truly has distinct properties that lend themselves to sharing content. Extreme learnability & overall simplicity of design makes BlueBoard a tool for collaboration that supports intermittent, but effective use for side-by-side collaboration between colleagues. ...|$|E

The FESSP Security Alarms and Monitoring Systems program area commissioned the authors study as decision support for upgrading the Argus security system`s primary user interface so that Argus equipment will support the new DOE and DoD security access badges. Twenty-two test subjects were repeatedly tested using six remote access panel (RAP) designs. Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) uses one of these interface designs in its security access booths. Along with the RAP B insert-style reader, the authors tested five prototype RAP variants, each with a different style of swipe <b>badge</b> <b>reader,</b> through which a badge is moved or swiped. The authors asked the untrained test subjects to use each RAP while they described how they thought they should respond so that the system would operate correctly in reading the magnetic strip on a security badge. With each RAP variant, subjects were required to make four successful card reads (swipes) in which the card reader correctly read and logged the transaction. After each trial, a subject completed a 10 -item interface acceptance evaluation before approaching the next RAP.

40|$|Aim and Objectives: To {{estimate}} the annual cumulative radiation dose received by a dentist in a ′less than an ideally sized clinic′ in Chennai. The {{objective of the}} study is to {{estimate the}} annual cumulative radiation dose received by the dentist at various distances and various angulations from the x-ray tube. Study Design: The head of a mannequin model was mounted on the dental chair to simulate a patient′s head and three thermoluminescent dosimeter (TLD) chips were kept at various distances and various angulations, at a constant height. The standard conventional intraoral dental radiographic unit was used, which was kept stationary, with a constant voltage of 70 Kv, 8 mA current, and a constant exposure time of 0. 3 seconds. Ninety-two TLD chips were exposed 20 times a day with constant horizontal angulations for a period of one year. The reading from the TLD chips was obtained on a computer through a TLD <b>Badge</b> <b>Reader.</b> Statistical Analysis: Post Hoc tests and One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used. Results and Conclusion: A decreasing trend was obtained in the average radiation doses, as the distance increased from the x-ray source, and a highly significant difference in doses (P < 0. 001 %) was found between 4 and 5. 5 feet (ft). We found a minimum average radiation dose at an angle of 60 ° to 80 ° and behind the tube. The {{purpose of this study was}} to create awareness among dental professionals, who had ′less than an ideally sized clinic′.
