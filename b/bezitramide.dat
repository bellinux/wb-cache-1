It {{is part of an}} eponymous two-member class of opioids in clinical use with the other being <b>bezitramide</b> (Burgodin). The closest chemical and structural relatives of piritramide in clinical use include the diphenoxylate family, fentanyl (both Janssen discoveries) and somewhat more distantly alphaprodine.|$|E

It {{is one of a}} handful of useful synthetic analgesics which were used in the United States for various lengths of time in the 20 or so years after the end of the Second World War but which were withdrawn from the market for various or no known reason and which now are mostly in Schedule I of the United States' Controlled Substances Act of 1970, or (like phenazocine and <b>bezitramide)</b> in Schedule II but not produced or marketed in the US. Others on this list are ketobemidone (Ketogin), dextromoramide (Dimorlin, Palfium and others), phenazocine (Narphen and Prinadol), dipipanone (Diconal, Pipadone and Wellconal), piminodine (Alvodine), propiram (Algeril), anileridine (Leritine) and alphaprodine (Nisentil).|$|E
