50|$|The archival {{material}} {{relating to}} {{the running of the}} shop includes order <b>books,</b> <b>invoices,</b> a credit or 'club' book, trade catalogues and advertising material. Many of the garments still have their original price tags attached, giving an insight into the purchasing power of consumers {{at the lower end of}} the market and the compromises made by working-class people between quality and affordability.|$|R
50|$|Different methods {{exist in}} {{accounting}} for recording {{the purchase of}} a product <b>bought</b> at the <b>invoice</b> price. One method, the gross method, involves simply recording the full amount of the invoice as a debit to accounts payable and a corresponding credit to cash. If any discounts are given, they are itemized as a separate credit to cash, plus the purchase price. The net method, on the other hand, begins with the purchase price, including any discounts, which are then debited to purchases in the accounting ledger. A corresponding credit is then made to accounts payable.|$|R
50|$|The {{ground floor}} of a two-storey {{building}} on the main shopping street of the town is divided into a shop, now a gift shop and the entrance for visitors, and the printer's office. This has a connecting door to the shop {{as well as its}} own door to the street which leads to a counter for serving customers. A large desk at the office window has the clutter typical of the early twentieth century, drawers contain stationery including writing slates, pencils, sealing wax, pen nibs and bottles of ink. Wall shelves store job dockets, <b>invoices,</b> wages <b>books</b> and ledgers dating back {{to the start of the}} business. Framed photographs show how little the office has changed since 1900, and a certificate shows the authority to issue tickets for steamships to America.|$|R
5000|$|This type of {{corruption}} is called [...] "superfaturamento" [...] -- overbilling -- in Brazil, {{and is a}} very common practice for politicians and civil servants in charge of contracting and buying for public institutions. You can see examples of this even in small primary schools where products like pencils and notebooks are <b>bought</b> with padded <b>invoices,</b> {{as well as in}} grand-scale construction such as public buildings, roads, power and sewage systems, metro-systems, football stadiums(not least in connection with the World Cup in 2014), etc. A particularly symbolic example is the city of Brasilia itself, which historians believe was systematically overpriced when built in the early 1960s.|$|R
5000|$|The shop {{operated}} a payment system that required customers to queue three times: to collect an <b>invoice</b> for a <b>book,</b> {{to pay the}} invoice, then to collect the book, simply because sales staff {{were not allowed to}} handle cash. Equally mystifying to customers was a shelving arrangement that categorised books by publisher, rather than by topic or author. A quote of this period is: [...] "Imagine Kafka had gone into the book trade." [...] In the 1980s a rival bookshop placed an advertisement in a bus shelter opposite Foyles: [...] "Foyled again? Try Dillons".|$|R

5000|$|Very few peddlers left written records. Many were {{illiterate}} and diaries are rare. [...] Most peddlers handled cash transactions {{leaving behind}} {{few or no}} accounting records such as receipts, <b>invoices</b> or day- <b>books.</b> However, {{a very small number}} of peddlers kept diaries and these can be used to provide an insight into the daily life of a peddler. Ephraim Lisitzky(1885-1962), an immigrant from Russsia arrived in the US in 1900 and took up peddling for a brief period folloiwng his arrival. His autobiography, published in 1959 under the title, In the Grip of the Cross-Currents, describes his various encounters with householders and the difficulties he experienced making a sale as door after door was slammed in his face.|$|R
