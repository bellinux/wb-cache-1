40|$|Abstract — Understanding the evolvability {{of simple}} differ-entiating {{multicellular}} systems {{is a fundamental}} problem in the biology of genetic regulatory networks and in computa-tional applications inspired by the metaphor of growing and developing networks of cells. We compare the evolvability of a static network model to a more realistic regulatory model with dynamic structure. In the former model, each regulatory protein-binding site is always influenced by exactly one gene product. In the latter model, binding is only {{more likely to occur}} the better the match between site and gene product is (<b>smooth</b> <b>binding)</b> and, in addition, affinity dynamically changes under the action of specificity factors during a cell’s lifetime. On evolutionary timescales, this means that often the strength of influences between nodes is perturbed instead of direct changes being made to network connectivity. A main result is that for evolutionary search spaces of increasing sizes evolved performance drops much more strongly in the classical network model as compared to the <b>smooth</b> <b>binding</b> model. This effect was even greater in the case of using <b>smooth</b> <b>binding</b> together with specificity factors...|$|R

40|$|Caldesmon {{inhibits}} {{the binding}} of skeletal muscle subfragment- 1 (S- 1) ·ATP to actin but enhances the <b>binding</b> of <b>smooth</b> muscle heavy meromyosin (HMM) ·ATP to actin. This effect {{results from the}} direct binding of caldesmon to myosin {{in the order of}} affinity: smooth muscle HMM > skeletal muscle HMM > smooth muscle S- 1 > skeletal muscle S- 1 Hemric, M. E., and Chalovich, J. M. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 1878 – 1885). We now show that the difference between skeletal muscle HMM and S- 1 is due to the presence of the S- 2 region in HMM and is unrelated to light chain composition or to two-headed versus single-headed binding. Differences between the <b>binding</b> of <b>smooth</b> and skeletal muscle myosin subfragments to actin do not result from the lack of light chain 2 in skeletal muscle S- 1. In the presence of ATP, caldesmon binds to smooth muscle myosin filaments with a stoichiometry of 1 : 1 (K = 1 × 106 m− 1). Similar results were obtained for the binding of caldesmon to smooth muscle rod as well as the binding of the purified myosin-binding fragment of caldesmon to smooth muscle myosin. The binding of caldesmon to intact myosin is ATP sensitive. The interaction of caldesmon with myosin is apparently specific and sensitive to the structure of both proteins...|$|R

HA- 1 A exhibited dose-dependent binding to untreated rough gram-negative bacteria such as the Escherichia coli D 21 F 2 Re chemotype strain but little <b>binding</b> to untreated <b>smooth</b> strains such as E. coli O 111 :B 4, or to gram-positive bacteria. However, overnight incubation of E. coli O 111 :B 4 with inhibitory concentrations of ceftazidime produced dose-dependent enhancement of HA- 1 A binding. Similar augmentation of HA- 1 A binding was observed when other smooth strains were exposed to cell wall-active agents. Dual-parameter FACS analysis of E. coli O 111 :B 4 exposed overnight to two times the MIC of ceftazidime revealed a decrease in forward light scatter, indicating a reduction in average cell size or bacterial fragmentation, accompanied by a striking increase in lipid A-inhibitable HA- 1 A binding. Moreover, ceftriaxone, but not gentamicin, produced a marked increase in propidium iodide uptake, indicating an increase in bacterial cell permeability, and a corresponding enhancement of HA- 1 A binding. Antibiotic-induced enhancement of HA- 1 A <b>binding</b> to <b>smooth</b> strains of gram-negative bacteria thus appears related to specific alterations in bacterial cell morphology resulting in exposure of the epitope recognized by HA- 1 A...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} {{a framework for}} analyzing the dynamics of investment, borrowing and payout decisions by public corporations. We assume that managers act entirely in their own long-run interests, subject to a governance constraint that limits their rents. Risk-neutral managers invest to maximize value but wait too long to disinvest. Efficient disinvestment can be forced by the right level of debt or by takeovers. Risk-averse managers underinvest; they do not waste free cash ow, because the governance constraint is <b>binding.</b> They <b>smooth</b> rents and consequently payout, so that changes in borrowing become a shock absorber for volatility of operating income. We obtain the Lintner (1956) model of payout if risk averse managers have a utility function with habit formation. We show how to adapt the dynamic framework to analyze several other issues, including the effects of asymmetric information. We show that Lintner-style payout smoothing can also arise when risk neutral managers are better informed than outsiders...|$|R

40|$|Specialized {{proteins}} in the plasma membrane, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and mitochondria tightly regulate intracellular calcium. A unique mechanism called store-operated calcium entry is activated when ER calcium is depleted, serving to restore intra-ER calcium levels. An ER calcium sensor, stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM 1), translocates within the ER membrane upon store depletion to the juxtaplasma membrane domain, where it interacts with intracellular domains {{of a highly}} calcium-selective plasma membrane ion channel, Orai 1. STIM 1 gates Orai 1, allowing calcium to enter the cytoplasm, where it repletes the ER store via calcium-ATPases pumps. Here, we performed affinity purification of Orai 1 from Jurkat cells to identify partner of STIM 1 (POST), a 10 -transmembrane–spanning segment protein of unknown function. The protein {{is located in the}} plasma membrane and ER. POST-Orai 1 binding is store depletion-independent. On store depletion, the protein binds STIM 1 and moves within the ER to localize near the cell membrane.

In the present study, in order to clarify the role of these smooth muscle myosin loops in energy transduction, we specifically labeled the loops with a fluorescent photoreactive ADP analogue, 3 '-O-(iV-methylanthraniloyl) - 8 -azido-ADP (Mant- 8 -jV 3 -ADP), and then measured the fluorescent polarization.

40|$|The platelet-derived {{growth factor}} (PDGF) binds {{specifically}} to high-affinity receptors {{on the surface}} of bovine aortic smooth muscle cells and 3 T 3 cells. Conditioned medium from cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells (EC) prevents PDGF binding to these receptors in a dose-dependent manner at 4 °C. The 125 I-labeled PDGF that is displaced by the conditioned medium shows no increase in trichloroacetic acid solubility or decrease in binding capability to fresh cells. The competitor activity was identified as a protein by ammonium sulfate precipitability and sensitivity to trypsin. The competitor protein also is found in the serum-free conditioned media from porcine aortic EC and human umbilical vein EC but not in media from bovine aortic smooth muscle cells, human neonatal foreskin fibroblasts, or the interleukin-producing thyoma cell line EL- 4. The competitor protein, like PDGF, has no effect on the specific 4 °C binding of either 125 I-labeled insulin to 3 T 3 cells or 125 I-labeled epidermal growth factor to human epidermoid A 431 cells. Saturation curves of PDGF <b>binding</b> to <b>smooth</b> muscle cells that had been preincubated in the presence and absence of competitor indicate that the concentration for half-maximal binding of 125 I-labeled PDGF to its receptor (≈ 30 pM) is unchanged by the competitor, whereas the apparent number of available receptor sites or maximal level of binding is greatly diminished. The competitor activity produced by cultured human umbilical vein EC is completely inhibited by antiserum against pure human PDGF, whereas the same PDGF antiserum only partially inhibits the mitogenic activity of the conditioned media. In addition, ≈ 7 -fold more crude endothelium-derived growth factor is required for half-maximal inhibition of 125 I-labeled PDGF binding as is required for half-maximal stimulation of DNA synthesis.

SP was infused for 2 -minute periods starting at a dose of 2. 8 pmol/min rising by doubling increments to 22. 4 pmol/min. Analysis of the epicardial coronary artery diameter, using a computerized analysis system (cAAs) of the angiograms, was performed {{at the end of}} each infusion. Analysis of seven smooth vessel segments from seven coronary vessels, which were stenosed at more proximal sites, was performed. Significant dose-dependent dilatation was seen (p= 0. 04), which was maximal at 5. 6 pmol/min SP. No additional dilatation was produced with 2 mg intracoronary isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN). Two of these seven patients showed no response to SP, and only one of these appeared to sustain dilatation with ISDN (2 mg intracoronary). In a second group of six patients with discrete coronary stenoses, analysis at the site of the stenosed segments appeared to reveal dilatation in response to SP in only on...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{elucidate}} the mechanism of the antihypertensive effect of the angiotensin I (Ang I) converting enzyme inhibitor captopril in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Drinking responses, peripheral vascular reactivity, and angiotensin II (Ang II) receptor binding in both the brain and vascular smooth muscle were examined in control and captopril-treated SHR. Pregnant and nursing dams were treated with oral captopril (100 mg/kg). After weaning, offspring were maintained on captopril (50 mg/kg). The average systolic pressures after 21 weeks of captopril treatment were 122 ± 3 mm Hg (male) and 118 ± 4 mm Hg (female) as compared with 169 ± 4 mm Hg (male) and 162 ± 2 mm Hg (female) in age-matched controls. Drinking responses to intracerebroventricular (10 ngj and subcutaneous (100 Mg/kg) administration of Ang I and II were attenuated hi captopril-treated SHR hi comparison to control SHR. Ang II receptor binding in the hypothalamus, thalamus, and septum of captopril-treated SHR was also significantly reduced. In contrast to a depressed angiotensinergic system in the brain, peripheral vascular reactivity to Ang H, as determined in isolated, artificially perfused kidneys, was elevated. Threshold and EDn values for Ang H were significantly lower in captopril-treated SHR than hi controls. Ang II receptor <b>binding</b> hi aortic <b>smooth</b> muscle cells prepared from captopril-treated SHR was also significantly greater tha...|$|R

To investigate this hypothesis in airway smooth muscle (ASM) we showed that HSP 20 was constitutively expressed {{as well as being}} inducible in cultured hASM cells by treatment with 1 &micro;M isoproterenol or 10 &micro;M salmeterol. In contrast, a mixture of proinflammatory mediators (interleukin- 1 &beta;, tumor necrosis factor &alpha;, and interferon &gamma;) inhibited expression of HSP 20 by about 50 % in 48 hours. To determine whether phosphorylation of HSP 20 is sufficient to induce relaxation, canine tracheal smooth muscle was treated with a cell permeant phosphopeptide that mimics the phosphorylation of HSP 20. The HSP 20 phosphopeptide antagonized carbacholinduced contraction by 60 % with no change in myosin light chain phosphorylation. Recombinant full length HSP 20 inhibited skeletal actin <b>binding</b> to <b>smooth</b> muscle myosin subfragment 1 (S 1), and recombinant cell permeant TAT-HSP 20 S 16 D mutant reduced F-actin filaments in cultured hASM cells. Carbachol stimulation of canine tracheal smooth muscle tissue caused redistribution of HSP 20 from large macromolecular complexes (200 &ndash; 500 kDa) to smaller complexes (&lt; 60 kDa). The results are consistent with HSP 20 expression and macromolecular structure being dynamically regulated in airway smooth muscle. HSP 20 is upregulated by beta agonists and downregulated by proinflammatory cytokines. HSP 20 is phosphorylated in vivo in a cAMP-dependent manner and the phosphorylated form promotes airway smooth muscle relaxation, possibly through depolymerization of F-actin as well as inhibition of myosin binding to actin.

40|$|Most {{blood vessels}} are {{supplied}} with adrenergic nerve fibers, which in their varicosities contain vesicles {{formed in the}} neuron cell body. The vesicles are the storage sites for norephinephrine, whether synthesized locally from tyrosine or actively taken up from the extracellular fluid by the varicosities (neuronal uptake). Norepinephrine can leave the storage sites 1) by leakage into the neuroplasm, in which case {{most of it is}} metabolized intraneuronally by monoamine oxidase; 2) by displacement with indirect sympathomimetic amines; and 3) by active release, together with dopamine-β-hydroxylase, the enzyme catalyzing the final step of the norepinephrine synthesis: this exocytotic process is triggered by an increase in neuroplasmic Ca 2 + concentration resulting from neuronal membrane depolarization. The norepinephrine released into the junctional cleft from the adrenergic varicosity diffuses to the smooth muscle cells where it binds to receptor or acceptor sites on the membrane. The binding to the receptors initiates a change in the activity of the vascular smooth muscle; in most vessels the norepinephrine-receptor interaction is alpha-adrenergic and evokes a constriction. Released norepinephrine is removed by 1) neuronal uptake, 2) overflow to the extracellular fluid and the bloodstream, 3) <b>binding</b> to nonvascular <b>smooth</b> muscle structures, and 4) uptake by smooth muscle cells and subsequent metabolization by catechol-O-methyl transferase and monoamine oxidase; the relative importance of these different deactivation pathways depends mainly on anatomical factors such as density and pattern of innervation. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Nonmuscle myosin can {{generate}} force and shortening in smooth muscle, as revealed by {{studies of the}} urinary bladder from mice lacking smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (SM-MHC) but expressing the nonmuscle myosin heavy chains A and B (NM-MHC A and B; Morano, I., G. X. Chai, L. G. Baltas, V. Lamounier-Zepter, G. Lutsch, M. Kott, H. Haase, and M. Bader. 2000. Nat. Cell Biol. 2 : 371 – 375). Intracellular calcium was measured in urinary bladders from SM-MHC–deficient and SM-MHC–expressing mice in relaxed and contracted states. Similar intracellular [Ca 2 +] transients were observed in {{the two types of}} preparations, although the contraction of SM-MHC–deficient bladders was slow and lacked an initial peak in force. The difference in contraction kinetics thus do not reflect differences in calcium handling. Thick filaments were identified with electron microscopy in smooth muscle cells of SM-MHC–deficient bladders, showing that NM-MHC can form filaments in smooth muscle cells. Maximal shortening velocity of maximally activated, skinned smooth muscle preparations from SM-MHC–deficient mice was significantly lower and more sensitive to increased MgADP compared with velocity of SM-MHC–expressing preparations. Active force was significantly lower and less inhibited by increased inorganic phosphate. In conclusion, large differences in nucleotide and phosphate <b>binding</b> exist between <b>smooth</b> and nonmuscle myosins. High ADP binding and low phosphate dependence of nonmuscle myosin would influence both velocity of actin translocation and force generation to promote slow motility and economical force maintenance of the cell...|$|R
40|$|Smooth {{muscle cell}} {{proliferation}} can be inhibited by heparan sulfate proteoglycans whereas the removal or digestion of heparan sulfate from perlecan promotes their proliferation. In {{this study we}} characterized the glycosaminoglycan side chains of perlecan isolated from either primary human coronary artery smooth muscle or endothelial cells and determined their roles in mediating cell adhesion and proliferation, and in fibroblast growth factor (FGF) <b>binding</b> and signaling. <b>Smooth</b> muscle cell perlecan was decorated with both heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate, whereas endothelial perlecan contained exclusively heparan sulfate chains. Smooth muscle cells bound to the protein core of perlecan only when the glycosaminoglycans were removed, and this binding involved a novel site in domain III as well as domain V/endorepellin and the α 2 β 1 integrin. In contrast, endothelial cells adhered to the protein core of perlecan {{in the presence of}} glycosaminoglycans. Smooth muscle cell perlecan bound both FGF 1 and FGF 2 via its heparan sulfate chains and promoted the signaling of FGF 2 but not FGF 1. Also endothelial cell perlecan bound both FGF 1 and FGF 2 via its heparan sulfate chains, but in contrast, promoted the signaling of both growth factors. Based on this differential bioactivity, we propose that perlecan synthesized by smooth muscle cells differs from that synthesized by endothelial cells by possessing different signaling capabilities, primarily, but not exclusively, due to a differential glycanation. The end result is a differential modulation of cell adhesion, proliferation and growth factor signaling in these two key cellular constituents of blood vessels. © 2014 International Society of Matrix Biology...|$|R
