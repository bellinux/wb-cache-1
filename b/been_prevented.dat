5|$|As a batsman, Macaulay was {{reasonably}} good and possibly {{better than his}} statistics would suggest. He was capable of batting well in a crisis but may have <b>been</b> <b>prevented</b> from honing his batting skills by the Yorkshire leadership who wished him to focus on bowling. He generally batted low down in the order after the all-rounders in the team. Macaulay's fielding was also very effective. He was excellent at close range to the batsmen, particularly from his own bowling.|$|E

5|$|In 2017, NATO officially {{recognized}} three aspiring members: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, and Macedonia. Macedonia has <b>been</b> <b>prevented</b> {{from joining}} the alliance by Greece, one {{effect of the}} Macedonian naming dispute. Future expansion is currently a topic of debate in several countries outside the alliance, and countries like Sweden, Finland, and Serbia have open political debate {{on the topic of}} membership, while in countries like Ukraine, support and opposition to membership is tied to ethnic and nationalist ideologies. The incorporation of countries formerly in the Eastern Bloc has been a cause of increased tension between NATO countries and Russia.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{government}} officials {{denied that the}} dam was poorly built; many politicians and an engineer for the nation's water company blamed the dam's poor construction {{as the source of}} the extreme death toll. Prior to the arrival of the storm, many residents had repeatedly requested that a stone wall be built to protect their homes. After the storm, they said that the deaths could have <b>been</b> <b>prevented.</b> According to one account, two master planned communities were situated {{in the middle of the}} drainage and were thus deluged by the storm. The water department head took the blame for the construction, but also said that the disaster was a natural phenomenon.|$|E

Breeders have protected the gene pool, and direct in-line breeding has <b>been</b> <b>prevented.</b> Jack Russells can live from 13 to 16 years given proper care. However, certain lines have been noted for having specific health concerns and, therefore, could occur in any line or generation because of recessive genes.

5|$|A {{group of}} monks extol {{the power of}} the Church. Bertram has freed Robert from the guards and the two arrive to prevent the {{marriage}} of Isabelle to the Prince of Granada. Bertram attempts to get Robert to sign a document in which he promises to serve Bertram for all eternity. He reveals to Robert that he is his true father and Robert decides to sign the oath from filial devotion. Before he can do so, Alice appears with the news that the Prince has <b>been</b> <b>prevented</b> from marrying Isabelle. Alice prays for divine help (Dieu puissant, ciel propice) and hands Robert his mother's will. Robert reads his mother's message, in which she warns him to beware the man who seduced and ruined her. Robert is wracked by indecision. Midnight strikes and the time for Bertram's coup is past. He is drawn down to hell. Robert is reunited with Isabelle in the cathedral, to great rejoicing.|$|E
5|$|Kiwi was {{acquired}} by the American company Sara Lee following its purchase of Reckitt and Colman in 1991 and Knomark with its brand Esquire Shoe Polish in 1987. The Federal Trade Commission ruled that Sara Lee had to divest its ownership of these companies in 1994 {{to prevent it from}} becoming a monopoly. Since this ruling, Sara Lee has <b>been</b> <b>prevented</b> from acquiring any further assets or firms associated with chemical shoe care products in the United States without prior commission approval. The Competition Commission in the United Kingdom investigated the potential monopoly of Sara Lee in the shoe care industry. By the end of 2010, Sara Lee's Household & Body Care division (which included KIWI) {{was acquired}} by S.C.Johnson & Son.|$|E
5|$|Ownership of {{the manor}} was {{passed on to}} William Dyer in 1444, who was a trustee of a lord named Robert Lee. Ownership was then {{transferred}} in 1485 to Maud, Anne, Elizabeth, Jane, and Ellen, daughters of John Lee, who had claimed {{the issues of the}} manor was under the will of their father, and complained that they had <b>been</b> <b>prevented</b> from enjoying them by Reginald Sandes and Robert Norton, who were also trustees. In 1567, William Lee sold the manor to Anne Twynne, and in 1591 Richard Miller sold it to Sir William of Kingswll. It was sold again in 1628 by Sir William's son and successor Edward Kingswell to Sir Richard Young of Weybridge, of whom it was purchased in 1632 by Sir Humphrey Benett. Benett then compounded his estate in 1649, and sold the manor of Shalden in 1653 to Anne Mynne.|$|E

5|$|By 1810 the French Navy fleet {{based in}} the Atlantic ports had <b>been</b> <b>prevented</b> from {{launching}} any major operations for four years, penned into harbour by the British strategy of close blockade. A failed attempt by a French fleet to sail had been defeated at the Battle of Basque Roads in 1809, and the main operations still {{carried out by the}} Navy were undertaken by privateers and frigate squadrons operating commerce raiders operating from smaller ports, such as those on the English Channel. In November 1810 squadrons were based at Cherbourg, with two ships of the line and the newly built frigate Iphigénie, and Le Havre, with the frigates Elisa and Amazone, commanded by Captains Louis-Henri Fraycinet-Saulce and Bernard-Louis Rosseau respectively. To blockade these squadrons, the Royal Navy's Channel Fleet had assigned the ships of the line HMS Donegal under Captain Pulteney Malcolm and HMS Revenge under Captain Charles Paget to patrol the entrance to Cherbourg, while frigates HMS Diana under Captain Charles Grant and HMS Niobe under Captain John Wentworth Loring kept watch on Le Havre. The blockade had achieved some minor successes; in October 1810 Revenge had captured the privateer Vengeur from Dieppe, and on 6 November Donegal ran down and seized the privateer Surcouf from Cherbourg.|$|E
5|$|Early on {{the morning}} of 3February, Terra Nova arrived {{unexpectedly}} in the Bay of Whales. She had sailed from New Zealand on 29November 1910 and had arrived in McMurdo Sound early in January. After landing Scott and his main party there, Terra Nova had taken a party of six men, led by Victor Campbell, eastward to King Edward VII Land. This group intended to explore this then-unknown territory, but had <b>been</b> <b>prevented</b> by sea ice from approaching the shore. The ship was sailing westward along the Barrier edge in search of a possible landing place when it encountered Fram. Scott had previously speculated that Amundsen might make his base in the Weddell Sea area, {{on the opposite side of}} the continent; this proof that the Norwegians would be starting the race for the pole with a 60 nautical mile advantage was an alarming prospect for the British. The two groups behaved civilly towards each other; Campbell and his officers Harry Pennell and George Murray Levick breakfasted aboard Fram, and reciprocated with lunch on the Terra Nova. Amundsen was relieved to learn that Terra Nova had no wireless radio, since that might have imperilled his strategy to be first with the news of a polar victory. He was worried, however, by a remark of Campbell's that implied that Scott's motorised sledges were working well. Nevertheless, he offered the British party a site alongside Framheim as a base for the exploration of King Edward VII Land. Campbell turned the offer down, and sailed for McMurdo Sound to inform Scott of Amundsen's whereabouts.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, he {{was picked}} by New York Governor Mario Cuomo to chair a {{scientific}} fact-finding commission on the Shoreham Nuclear Power Plant, a job that required him {{to find common ground}} between the many viewpoints represented on the commission. The commission eventually recommended the closure of the plant, a course he personally disagreed with. Cuomo had formed the commission in mid-May 1983 to provide him with recommendations regarding the plant's safety, the adequacy of emergency plans, and the economics of operating the plant. The commission's consensus recommendations included unanimous findings that no emergency evacuation of the plant could be conducted without the cooperation of Suffolk County, which was refusing to approve an evacuation plan; that the construction of the plant would have <b>been</b> <b>prevented</b> if it had been started after new Nuclear Regulatory Commission regulations were put into effect after the Three Mile Island accident in 1979; and that operating the plant would not reduce utility costs. Marburger himself at the time emphasized that the governor had not been seeking a consensus but rather encouraged multiple viewpoints to be reflected, and characterized the consensus conclusions as not the only important section of the report.|$|E

5|$|In the 400m {{freestyle}} heats, Windle and Talbot made a misjudgement; in {{an attempt}} to conserve his energy for the final they decided that Windle should not go flat out, and Windle was four seconds slower than he was at the Australian Championships. Windle was one of the top seeds for the race, and Talbot advised him to swim hard {{in the first half of}} the race before slowing down. However, he swam too slowly and missed the final completely. Although he won his heat by seven seconds in a time of 4min 21.6s, he was the ninth fastest overall, so he missed the final by one position with a time deficit of 0.5s. The slowest qualifier was Tsuyoshi Yamanaka, who had <b>been</b> <b>prevented</b> from withdrawing from the race by his coaches. On the other hand, the two other Australian representatives who he defeated at the national championships did make the final, including Wood, who went on to win bronze. Talbot said that the tactical error was mostly his responsibility and that he learnt a lot from it.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 1998 Act, whistleblowers in the United Kingdom had no {{protection}} against being dismissed by their employer. Although they could avoid being sued for {{breach of confidence}} thanks to a public interest defence, this did not prevent subtle or open victimisation in the workplace, including disciplinary action, dismissal, failure to gain promotion or a pay rise. During the early to mid-1990s, interest in whistleblower protection grew, partially because {{of a series of}} financial scandals and health and safety accidents, which investigations into showed could have <b>been</b> <b>prevented</b> if employees had been permitted to voice their concerns, and partially because of the work of the Committee on Standards in Public Life. In 1995 and 1996, two private member's bills dealing with whistleblowers were introduced to Parliament, by Tony Wright and Don Touhig respectively, but both efforts fell through. When Richard Shepherd proposed a similar bill, however, he got government support for it on the condition that it be an amendment to the Employment Rights Act 1996 rather than a new area of law in its own right. Public Concern at Work, a UK-based whistleblowers charity, was involved in the drafting and consultation stages of the bill. The case of Graham Pink added to the pressure to introduce whistleblower protection legislation.|$|E
