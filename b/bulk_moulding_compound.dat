40|$|Abstract — An {{original}} {{approach to}} compute the longitudinal tensile break stress of multiphase composite materials with short fibers reinforcement is presented. The most obvious mechanical model which reflects a multiphase composite material is a pre-impregnated material, known as prepreg. We may include in this class of prepregs, Sheet- and <b>Bulk</b> <b>Moulding</b> <b>Compounds.</b> The model is seen as consisting of three phase compounds: resin, filler and fibers, model that is reduced to two phase compounds: substitute matrix and fibers. The Sheet <b>Moulding</b> <b>Compounds</b> reinforced with discontinuous and almost parallel fibers, subjected to longitudinal tensile loads, presents a specific note by {{the existence of a}} shear mechanism between fibers and matrix. This shear mechanism transfers the tensile load through the fibers. The Young’s moduli for the substitute matrix and for the entire composite are computed and a comparison between the theoretical approach and the experimental data is accomplished...|$|R

40|$|Flax fiber {{reinforced}} plastics can be processed by techniques {{that are common}} for glass fibre reinforced materials. Flax fiber/polypropylene compounds were prepared in a co-rotating twin screw extruder using maleic acid anhydride/polypropylene copolymers as a coupling agent.

Mechanical properties of flax fiber reinforced BMC (a thermosetting <b>Bulk</b> <b>Moulding</b> <b>Compound)</b> processed by injection moulding are {{comparable to those of}} glass fibre reinforced BMC.

40|$|There is an {{emerging}} {{interest in the}} aerospace industry to manufacture composite components with intricate geometries. One {{way to do this}} is by using a <b>bulk</b> <b>moulding</b> <b>compound</b> which consists of strands of unidirectional carbon-fibre tape. This material system is termed randomly-oriented strand (ROS) composites. The great design potential of ROS composites has been demonstrated in the literature, but the modelling techniques for this material are in their infancy. This paper proposes a stochastic 2 D modelling technique for predicting strength of ROS composites from the mechanical properties of the individual strands. This model is representative of the microstructure and the through-the-thickness fracture morphologies characteristic to ROS composites. Classical laminate theory and Hashin's criteria are used to predict strand breakage, while interlaminar strength and fracture toughness are implemented to account for strand debonding. The model successfully predicts the strength of ROS composites, captures the effect of strand size on properties, depicts heterogeneous nature of the material, and demonstrates that failure follows the 2 ̆ 01 cweakest-link 2 ̆ 01 d principle. It also indicates that thermoplastic ROS composites are superior to their thermoset (e. g. epoxy) counterparts. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
40|$|Conventional urea-based <b>moulding</b> <b>compounds</b> for {{investment}} casting patterns are manufactured using a slow “cooking” process. Nowadays in industrial processes {{the use of}} a faster process is highly recommended to increase throughput levels. At the same time, for quality control purposes, the requirements of an investment caster must be met. This study is therefore focused on: Finding the appropriate conventional process and conditions to prepare urea-based investment casting <b>moulding</b> <b>compounds.</b> Optimising the composition variables to meet the mechanical, thermal, surface, flow and cost properties needed in investment casting. Characterising the <b>moulding</b> <b>compounds</b> to meet the requirements of an investment caster by comparing them with an industrial, “cooked” urea-based compound. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVOH) and ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) urea-based <b>moulding</b> <b>compounds</b> were prepared using a two-roll mill and a conventional extrusion processes respectively. It was possible to injection mould PVOH urea-based <b>moulding</b> <b>compounds</b> with a urea content of up to 90 wt % which had been compounded using a two-roll mill. Using the conventional extrusion process, it was also possible to <b>compound</b> and injection <b>mould</b> EVA urea-based <b>moulding</b> <b>compounds</b> containing up to 70 wt % urea. The effects on composition variables on the properties of the <b>moulding</b> <b>compound</b> were studied and compared to those of the existing “cooked” urea-based <b>moulding</b> <b>compound</b> (Benchmark). The mechanical properties were characterised using the three-point bending test and Charpy impact test. The thermal properties were determined using simultaneous differential thermal analysis and thermogravimetric analysis (SDTA/TGA) and differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). The thermo-mechanical and visco-elastic properties were determined using a dynamic mechanical analyser. A scanning electron microscope was used to study the surface texture of the mouldings. The EVA urea-based <b>moulding</b> <b>compounds</b> showed two endothermic melting peaks and multiple exothermic crystallisation peaks in the DSC curves. The peak at ca. 55 - 66 °C corresponds to the melting of the wax/EVA blend, while the large peak at 130 - 132 °C corresponds to the melting of the urea. The DSC heating curve of the PVOH urea-based <b>moulding</b> <b>compounds</b> showed two endothermic peaks. The small peak corresponds to the melting of the wax, while the large peak corresponds to the melting of the urea/PVOH blend. PVOH urea-based <b>moulding</b> <b>compound</b> had better mechanical properties than the industrial benchmark. The mechanical properties of the EVA urea-based compound were generally lower. The effect of the wax and polymer content on the mechanical properties was as follows: Increasing polymer content produced weaker but tougher <b>moulding</b> <b>compounds.</b> Increasing wax content improved the strength and stiffness but gave compounds that were less tough. Two-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) indicated significant polymer-wax interactions. The urea content determined the stiffness (elastic modulus) of the compounds. PVOH mouldings had superior stiffness compared with the EVA and cooked urea-based mouldings. The Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) results confirmed the result obtained from the modulus of elasticity determination in the three-point bending test. The impact strength increased with an increase in polymer content and reduced with an increase in wax content. The linear thermal expansion coefficient decreased as the urea content was increased. Measured values (100 to 156 x 10 - 6 °C) were comparable to those of the benchmark. The cooked urea-based <b>moulding</b> <b>compound</b> had the lowest melt viscosity at 110 °C, as indicated by its melt flow index (MFI). Fluidity increased with the polymer content. The thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA) results confirmed that both the PVOH and EVA urea-based <b>moulding</b> <b>compounds</b> decomposed readily and left less than 1 wt % ash after combustion. From the SEM results apparent surface roughness appeared to increase with wax content. The EVA urea-based <b>moulding</b> <b>compound</b> had an irregular surface texture. Based on the criteria of cost-effectiveness and environmental friendliness, the synthesis of PVOH urea-based patterns is preferable. The use of a conventional extrusion process to prepare PVOH urea-based patterns is recommended. Thesis (PhD) [...] University of Pretoria, 2011. Chemical Engineeringunrestricte...|$|R

40|$|The {{traditional}} methods of combining fibrous reinforcement with resin matrix have been dictated by {{the properties of the}} matrix. If a thermoset matrix is used the low viscosity of the unreacted system can be exploited to either mix in quantities of short fibre reinforcement, as with <b>bulk</b> <b>moulding</b> <b>compound,</b> or to infiltrate the resin through reinforcement as with resin transfer moulding, however it is necessary to ensure that the moulded article is formed into its final shape before the resin cures. If a thermoplastic resin is selected then the high viscosity of material means that the blending of reinforcement and fibre must usually be performed under condition of high temperature and shear, as for example by compounding extruder or calendaring. This paper describes a method of exploiting the soluble nature of certain biodegradable polymers to produce an injection mouldable short fibre reinforced material without a mechanical compounding stage. This method combines the low viscosity advantages of thermoset systems with the continuing mouldability of thermoplastics. It is anticipated that this method will allow the production of mouldable compounds on the farm, thus allowing the grower to benefit from the higher value of a semi-finished produc...|$|E
40|$|The {{increasing}} demand for composites {{leads to a}} growing amount of end-of-life material and production waste. The latter consists of a large fraction of unimpregnated fibre waste which is not sufficiently reprocessed using conventional textile processing procedures as they are either too expensive or their mechanical performance is too low. Using pieces of dry non-crimp fabrics (patches) in a <b>Bulk</b> <b>Moulding</b> <b>Compound</b> process (BMC) displays a straightforward approach of fabric recycling. Adding fillers to the mixture not only offers the opportunity to modify mechanical and electrical properties {{as well as the}} costs but also a chance for a more holistic approach of dry fibre recycling, when conventional fillers like chalk are replaced by ground recycled carbon fibres. In this way, all kind of dry fibre wastes can be reused in one process: Larger offcuts are chopped to smaller rectangular patches whereas waste fractions of small offcuts are processed to carbon fibre powder as filler and processed together with resin to produce BMC materials. Mechanical investigations reveal that the presented approach shows higher specific properties than the conventional filler without compromising the process and material quality...|$|E

40|$|This project {{involves}} {{the design and}} construction of a fibre cutter {{which can be used}} to chop different types of fibres in order to produce alternative composite materials. Chopped fibre is needed in the production of composite materials for the automotive industry and other sectors. <b>Bulk</b> <b>Moulding</b> <b>Compound</b> (BMC) and Sheet Moulding Compound (SMC) are the most commonly used processes. The process uses chopped glass fibre to produce light composite materials. Currently, the market offers many alternatives to quickly cut glass fibre. However, these methods cannot be used with alternative fibres which are more difficult to handle, so a new fibre cutter is needed to cut alternative fibres and produce new materials which can offer lighter, and more sustainable reinforcement alternatives than glass fibre. The chosen solution has been the modification of an existing fibreglass chopper gun, which was able to cut glass fibre at different lengths with its cutting wheels, but could not cut other types of fibres. After the adaption of the conceptual design to the existing chopper gun, the gun arrangement was able to cut carbon fibre successfully, and is also capable of cutting some types of coated rayon fibre. In order to prove the usefulness of this new design, the chopper gun has been used to cut carbon fibre to produce alternative BMC materials, where, remarkably, that the cutting process just needed 72 seconds to produce 475 grams of chopped carbon fibre. These alternative BMC materials have been tested and compared with conventional glass fibre BMC compounds, demonstrating superior mechanical properties and lower density.

In the same manner competences in new production technologies have been built up in the aerospace industry. However, current processes for producing lightweight composites with an excellent mechanical performance cause high costs and long process cycles in comparison with approved metal processes. Furthermore the used raw materials, such as carbon fibres and resin, are very expensive.
