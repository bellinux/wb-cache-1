25|$|In July 1991, the Mafia pentito Francesco Marino Mannoia {{claimed that}} Calvi {{had been killed}} because he had lost Mafia funds when Banco Ambrosiano collapsed. According to Mannoia, the killer was Francesco Di Carlo, a mafioso living in London at the time, on the orders of boss Giuseppe Calò and Licio Gelli. When Di Carlo became an {{informer}} in June 1996, he denied he was the killer, but admitted he had been approached by Calò to do the job. However, Di Carlo {{could not be reached}} in time. When he later called Calò, the latter said that everything had <b>been</b> <b>taken</b> <b>care</b> <b>of.</b> According to Di Carlo, the killers were Vaccari and Vincenzo Casillo, who belonged to the Camorra from Naples and were later killed. In 1997, Italian prosecutors in Rome implicated Calò in Calvi's murder, along with Flavio Carboni, a Sardinian businessman with wide-ranging interests.

[...] Fannia are drawn to feces and urine, and their presence is strong evidence of neglect. The woman probably had not changed clothes or bathed in some time.

2500|$|In July 1991 the Mafia pentito (a mafioso turned {{informer}}) Francesco Marino Mannoia {{claimed that}} Roberto Calvi – nicknamed [...] "God's banker" [...] {{because he was}} in charge of Banco Ambrosiano, in which the Vatican Bank was the main share-holder – had been killed in 1982 because he had lost Mafia funds when the Banco Ambrosiano collapsed. According to Mannoia the killer was Francesco Di Carlo, a mafioso living in London at the time, and the order to kill Calvi had come from Calò and Licio Gelli, the head of the secret Italian masonic lodge Propaganda Due. When Di Carlo became an informer in June 1996, he denied that he was the killer, but admitted that he had been approached by Calò to do the job. However, Di Carlo could not be reached in time, and when he later called Calò, the latter said that everything had <b>been</b> <b>taken</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> already.|$|E
2500|$|In {{ruling out}} the {{possibilities}} that Sukarno and/or the PKI organized {{the events of}} October 1, 1965, Anderson and McVey considered two additional alternatives. The first was an independent move by Untung and his movement to seize control and remove members of the Army General Staff for their [...] "Western orientation", [...] "Menteng mentality", and [...] "obstruction of Sukarno's endeavors" [...] without the desire for popular support. If Untung and his men {{did not want to}} involve the civilian movement to prevent its coup attempt from being thwarted by the Army, Anderson and McVey then believed Sukarno must have been a key figure. This was the final alternative, in which the President acted spontaneously after being spurred by Untung and his men to act against the Army General Staff without his knowing that rumors of an impending coup were false. Again, Anderson and McVey disputed this theory because in the case that Sukarno wanted to remove his opposition, [...] "surely more generals would have <b>been</b> <b>taken</b> <b>care</b> <b>of,</b> particularly Suharto and [...] ".|$|E

2500|$|The biggest {{challenge}} with localizing {{the series was}} {{to keep track of}} everything, as the games feature branching paths, and the characters learn different things in different branches, affecting word choices and attitudes. While a lot of this had <b>been</b> <b>taken</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> by Spike Chunsoft, many parts of the game required different word choices in English depending on if a character knew of a particular thing or not; in these cases, the localization team had to track the story backwards. During the projects, Aksys Games would do email correspondence with Spike Chunsoft, {{to make sure that they}} conveyed the message of the games as intended. The title Zero Escape was decided on during the localization of the second game, when the localization team wanted to create a [...] "branding umbrella" [...] for both games. They chose the title based on what they thought defines the first two games and is common to both of them, concluding that it was the character Zero and how both games involve [...] "a dangerous escape"; the title also has the double meaning of [...] "you have zero chance to escape". The title was later used as part of the Japanese title for Zero Time Dilemma, and replaced the previous Japanese title Kyokugen Dasshutsu title altogether for the re-release of Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors and Virtue's Last Reward.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the episode}} [...] "Fallout", Claire's father reveals {{that he knew}} about her powers long before {{she was aware of}} them. He {{acknowledges}} doing things he was not proud of to keep her safe, and tells Claire that Sylar had <b>been</b> <b>taken</b> <b>care</b> <b>of,</b> but that she must keep silent about her powers because she is in danger from others like him. Bennet later meets with Sylar, confined in a prison cell, and tells him that the cell is keeping his powers suppressed. Sylar taunts Bennet telling him that Bennet is just like him. [...] In their next confrontation Bennet turns the taunt back at Sylar telling him how they plan to study him to determine what makes him [...] "tick." [...] Sylar boasts that he would escape and kill Claire, taking her healing abilities. Eden suggests using her powers to persuade Sylar to kill himself, but Bennet declines (though briefly tempted), as he takes orders from someone higher up. Bennet later takes Claire to the police station, where she is interviewed about Jackie's murder. Officer Parkman is unable to read the thoughts of Claire or her father, since the Haitian is hiding behind a nearby corner. Afterwards, Bennet orders the Haitian to wipe the memories of his son and Claire's friend, Zach. [...] When Claire finds out {{that the two of them}} have lost all memory of her powers she rings her father in a panic. [...] It is left open whether it is only then that he orders the Haitian to wipe Claire's memories or whether he has already done so.|$|E

60|$|When {{the little}} Ruth {{was about a}} year or {{a year and a}} half old, Mason, an old and valued friend of mine, was {{consul-general}} at Frankfort-on-the-Main. I had known him well in 1867, '68 and '69, in America, and I and mine had spent a good deal of time with him and his family in Frankfort in '78. He was a thoroughly competent, diligent, and conscientious official. Indeed he possessed these qualities in so large a degree that among American consuls he might fairly be said to be monumental, for at that time our consular service was largely--and I think I may say mainly--in the hands of ignorant, vulgar, and incapable men who had been political heelers in America, and had <b>been</b> <b>taken</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> by transference to consulates where they could be supported at the Government's expense instead of being transferred to the poor house, which would have been cheaper and more patriotic. Mason, in '78, had been consul-general in Frankfort several years--four, I think. He had come from Marseilles with a great record. He had been consul there during thirteen years, and one part of his record was heroic. There had been a desolating cholera epidemic, and Mason was the only representative of any foreign country who stayed at his post and saw it through. And during that time he not only represented his own country, but he represented all the other countries in Christendom and did their work, and did it well and was praised for it by them in words of no uncertain sound. This great record of Mason's had saved him from official decapitation straight along while Republican Presidents occupied the chair, but now it was occupied by a Democrat. Mr. Cleveland was not seated in it--he was not yet inaugurated--before he was deluged with applications from Democratic politicians desiring the appointment of a thousand or so politically useful Democrats to Mason's place. A year or two later Mason wrote me and asked me if I couldn't do something to save him from destruction.|$|E

6000|$|... "DEAR FRIEND,--I {{have had}} {{occasion}} to write to thee several times [...] since we saw each other, but as {{this is my first}} letter, so it [...] shall contain all the business thou wouldst know. I got safe to [...] London, by thy careful ordering of the coach, and the attendants [...] were not at all wanting in their duty. When I had been at home a [...] few days, thy woman, Mrs. Amy, came to see me, so I took her to [...] task as thou ordered me, about murdering thy pretended daughter; [...] she declared her innocence, but said she had procured a false [...] evidence to swear a large debt against her, and by that means had [...] put her into a prison, and fee'd the keepers to hinder her from [...] sending any letter or message out of the prison to any person [...] whatever. This, I suppose, was the reason thou thought she was [...] murdered, because thou wert relieved from her by this base usage. [...] However, when I heard of it, I checked Amy very much, but was well [...] satisfied to hear she was alive. After this I did not hear from Amy [...] for above a month, and in the interim (as I knew thou wast safe), I [...] sent a friend of mine to pay the debt, and release the prisoner, [...] which he did, but was so indiscreet as to let her know who was the [...] benefactress. My next care was to manage thy Spitalfields business, [...] which I did with much exactness. And the day that I received thy [...] last letter, Amy came to me again, and I read as much of it to her [...] as she was concerned in: nay, I entreated her to drink tea with me, [...] and after it one glass of citron, in which she drank towards thy [...] good health, and she told me she would come to see thee as soon as [...] possible. Just as she was gone, I was reading thy letter again in [...] the little parlour, and that turbulent creature (thy pretended [...] daughter) came to me, as she said, to return thanks for the favour [...] I had done her, so I accidentally laid thy letter down in the [...] window, while I went to fetch her a glass of cordial, for she [...] looked sadly; and before I returned I heard the street door shut, [...] on which I went back without the liquor, not knowing who might have [...] come in, but missing her, I thought she might be gone to stand at [...] the door, and the wind had blown it to; but I was never the nearer, [...] she was sought for in vain. So when I believed her to be quite [...] gone, I looked to see if I missed anything, which I did not; but at [...] last, to my great surprise, I missed your letter, which she [...] certainly took and made off with. I was so terrified at this [...] unhappy chance that I fainted away, and had not one of my maidens [...] come in at that juncture, it might have been attended with fatal [...] consequences. I would advise thee to prepare thyself to see her, [...] for I verily believe she will come to thee. I dread your knowing of [...] this, but hope the best. Before I went to fetch the unhappy [...] cordial, she told me, as she had often done before, that she was [...] the eldest daughter, that the captain's wife was your second [...] daughter, and her sister, and that the youngest sister was dead. [...] She also said there were two brothers, the eldest of whom had never [...] been seen by any of them since he run away from an uncle's at nine [...] years of age, and that the youngest had <b>been</b> <b>taken</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> by an [...] old lady that kept her coach, whom he took to be his godmother. She [...] gave me a long history in what manner she was arrested and flung [...] into Whitechapel jail, how hardly she fared there; and at length [...] the keeper's wife, to whom she told her pitiful story, took [...] compassion of her, and recommended her to the bounty of a certain [...] lady who lived in that neighbourhood, that redeemed prisoners for [...] small sums, and who lay for their fees, every return of the day of [...] her nativity; that {{she was one of the}} six the lady had discharged; [...] that the lady prompted her to seek after her mother; that she [...] thereupon did seek thee in all the towns and villages between [...] London and Dover; that not finding thee at Dover she went to Deal; [...] and that at length, she being tired of seeking thee, she returned [...] by shipping to London, where she was no sooner arrived but she was [...] immediately arrested and flung into the Marshalsea prison, where [...] she lived in a miserable condition, without the use of pen, ink, [...] and paper, and without the liberty of having any one of her friends [...] come near her. 'In this condition I was,' continued she, 'when you [...] sent and paid my debt for me, and discharged me.' When she had [...] related all this she fell into such a fit of crying, sighing, and [...] sobbing, from which, when she was a little recovered, she broke out [...] into loud exclamations against the wickedness of the people in [...] England, that they could be so unchristian as to arrest her twice, [...] when she said it was as true as the Gospel that she never did owe [...] to any one person the sum of one shilling in all her life; that she [...] could not think who it was that should owe her so much ill-will, [...] for that she was not conscious to herself that she had any ways [...] offended any person in the whole universal world, except Mrs. Amy, [...] in the case of her mother, which, she affirmed, she was acquitted [...] of by all men, and hoped she should be so by her Maker; and that if [...] she (Mrs. Amy) had any hand in her sufferings, God would forgive [...] her, as she heartily did. 'But then,' she added, 'I will not stay [...] in England, I will go all over the world, I will go to France, to [...] Paris; I know my mother did once live there, and if I do not find [...] her there, I will go through Holland, to Amsterdam, to Rotterdam; [...] in short, I will go till I find my mother out, if I should die in [...] the pursuit.' I should be glad to hear of thine and thy spouse's [...] welfare, and remain with much sincerity, your sincere friend, ...|$|E
