2500|$|In 1998, they {{released}} an EP titled 5 Tracks Deep. It {{sold more than}} 1,000 copies in its first month of release. In 1999, they produced another EP, which would end up being their last independent release, titled Let 'Em Know. Its success {{caught the attention of}} Warner Music Group, who as part of a development deal provided a small amount of money for the production of a five-track promo-demo CD. The band decided they wanted influential rock producer Jay Baumgardner on board to produce the record. In an interview with HitQuarters, Baumgardner said, “At first I wasn’t really convinced it would work out, <b>but</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> a video of them performing at a club - I saw all these kids going wild, knowing the songs by heart - and that’s when I realized that they definitely had potential.” ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{album is}} {{essentially}} an electronic rock album. It {{has a lot of}} [...] "rock attitude". Slimmy said that his [...] "heroes" [...] from the past and present are rock stars. It's an album of songs that don't matter what style of music they have, all that matters is that people stay with the song and get the emotions Slimmy was feeling when he was writing the songs. The album is [...] "rock fused with electronic". When he was asked about the [...] "final product" [...] he said: [...] "Honestly, I think it came out better.

60|$|Amb.--In {{confirmation}} of this opinion of Onuphrio, I can mention many instances. I once dreamt that my door had been forced, {{that there were}} robbers in my room, {{and that one of}} them was actually putting his hand before my mouth to ascertain if I was sleeping naturally. I awoke at this moment, and was some minutes before I could be sure whether it was a dream or a reality. I felt the pressure of the bedclothes on my lips, and still in the fear of being murdered continued to keep my eyes closed and to breathe slowly, till, hearing nothing and finding no motion, I ventured to open my eyes; <b>but</b> even <b>then,</b> when <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> nothing, <b>I</b> was not sure that my impression was a dream till I had risen from my bed and ascertained that the door was still locked.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah, I'm {{bound to}} say you do,' Mrs. Nettlepoint exclaimed, inconsequently. I divined {{that there was a}} certain tension between the pair and a want of {{consideration}} on the young man's part, arising perhaps from selfishness. His mother was nervous, in suspense, wanting to be at rest as to whether she should have his company on the voyage or be obliged to make it alone. But as he stood there smiling and slowly moving his fan he struck me somehow as a person on whom this fact would not sit very heavily. He was of the type of those whom other people worry about, not of those who worry about other people. Tall and strong, he had a handsome face, with a round head and close-curling hair; the whites of his eyes and the enamel of his teeth, under his brown moustache, gleamed vaguely in the lights of the Back Bay. I made out that he was sunburnt, as if he lived much in the open air, and that he looked intelligent but also slightly brutal, though not in a morose way. His brutality, if he had any, was bright and finished. I had to tell him who <b>I</b> was, <b>but</b> even <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> that he failed to place me and that my explanations gave me in his mind no great identity or at any rate no great importance. I foresaw that he would in intercourse make me feel sometimes very young and sometimes very old. He mentioned, as if to show his mother that he might safely be left to his own devices, that he had once started from London to Bombay at three-quarters of an hour's notice.|$|R
60|$|All {{about his}} door {{there was much}} {{concourse}} of people, and among them two archers led a great black charger, fairly caparisoned, {{and covered with a}} rich silk hucque of colour cramoisie, adorned with lilies of silver. As I marvelled who the rider might be, conceiving that he was some great lord, the door of my master's house opened, and there, within, and plain to view, was Elliot embracing a young knight; and over his silver armour fell her yellow hair, covering gorget and rere-brace. Then my heart stood still, my lips opened but gave no cry, when, lo! the knight kissed her and came forth, all in shining armour, <b>but</b> unhelmeted. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> that this was no knight, but the Maid herself, boden in effeir of war, {23} and so changed from what she had been that she seemed a thing divine. If St. Michael had stepped down from a church window, leaving the dragon slain, he would have looked no otherwise than she, all gleaming with steel, and with grey eyes full of promise of victory: the holy sword girdled about her, and a little battle-axe hanging from her saddle-girth. She sprang on her steed, from the mounting-stone beside the door, and so, waving her hand, she cried farewell to Elliot, that stood gazing after her with shining eyes. The people went after the Maid some way, shouting Noel! and striving to kiss her stirrup, the archers laughing, meanwhile, and bidding them yield way. And so we came, humbly enough, into the house, where, her father being present and laughing and the door shut, Elliot threw her arms about me and wept and smiled on my breast.|$|R

It was international film sales that provided Union with eight Nielsen films per year. I built her a studio in Tempelhof, {{and set up a}} big production staff around her. This woman can carry it ... Let the films cost whatever they cost. I used every available means - and devised many new ones - in order to bring the Asta Nielsen films to the world." ...|$|E

5000|$|The detractors {{were many}} due to Georgie's habit of {{disregarding}} her customer's safety. Her business had {{the distinction of}} having the first rafting commercial fatality, Mae Hansen, aged 64, and the first injured person to be evacuated by helicopter from the Grand Canyon, Vernon Read, who suffered severe skull and spinal fractures. River guide John Davenport, who watched as Georgie intentionally launched her boat into a dangerous position on the river, reported [...] "She was pretty far left in her entry. It {{looked like she was}} going to run left. <b>But</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> her stand up and look toward the Ledge Hole. As soon as she saw she was going to miss it, she fired up her motor and powered over {{to the center of the}} river. She was too late to reach the Ledge Hole and also straighten out. So she entered the Ledge Hole at a 45-degree angle. It was the worst example of gross incompetence I have ever seen." [...] Customer Norine Abrams died as a result of these actions. When National Park Service Ranger Kim Crumbo arrived to transport Ms. Crumbo's body out, Georgie became frustrated because the transportation was taking too long. She had new customers arriving and she didn't want them to see the body bag.

5000|$|Barrett {{also wrote}} voluminously for his blog on the Blazers' website, {{offering}} game reviews and a behind-the-scenes {{perspective on the}} team. Barrett recalled the origins of his on-line publication in a 2008 interview:"The funny thing {{is that when the}} blog started at Summer League like 3 or 4 years ago, they said write some stuff for training camp, and that was kind of strange, <b>but</b> <b>then</b> they <b>saw</b> <b>I</b> could write in a real conversational way, that involved people. It was one of those odd things that you stumble into {{and all of a sudden}} you've created a lot of work for yourself. It's not a bad thing it's a good thing."It takes a lot of time, as you know. To do something like that and to maintain it — I moderate 95% of the comments, I see them all, I put the picture up, I do the headline, it's like my own little newspaper. And that's pretty cool for somebody who was into journalism anyway. Writing has always been pretty easy. To sit down to write after a game or after an event, positive or negative news, it's almost my way of going home and unwinding and reliving it. I think a lot of writers would say that. That's my way of going home and coming down from the high of the night."I get wordy, I get long, I start writing. They tell me, 'just write a paragraph,' and I said, 'I get going, I can't.' The next thing I know I'm at 2,000 words. I've enjoyed sitting down after my kids and wife go to bed, sit down, and process through some things. It helps me remember the game better, it helps me realize it, the next time we play somebody, I remember not only the game but the blog. I can go back and review it if I want to." ...|$|R
60|$|Outside {{the saloon}} I hesitated, for Mrs. Peck's admonition {{made me feel}} {{for a moment that}} if I ascended to the deck I should have entered in a manner into her little conspiracy. But the night was so warm and splendid that I had been {{intending}} to smoke a cigar in the air before going below, and I did not see why I should deprive myself of this pleasure in order to seem not to mind Mrs. Peck. I went up and saw a few figures sitting or moving about in the darkness. The ocean looked black and small, as it is apt to do at night, and the long mass of the ship, with its vague dim wings, seemed to take up a great part of it. There were more stars than one saw on land and the heavens struck one more than ever as larger than the earth. Grace Mavis and her companion were not, so far as I perceived at first, among the few passengers who were lingering late, and I was glad, because I hated to hear her talked about in the manner of the gossips I had left at supper. I wished there had been some way to prevent it, but I could think of no way but to recommend her privately to change her habits. That would be a very delicate business, and perhaps {{it would be better to}} begin with Jasper, though that would be delicate too. At any rate one might let him know, in a friendly spirit, to how much remark he exposed the young lady--leaving this revelation to work its way upon him. Unfortunately I could not altogether believe that the pair were unconscious of the observation and the opinion of the passengers. They were not a boy and a girl; they had a certain social perspective in their eye. I was not very clear as to the details of that behaviour which had made them (according to the version of my good friends in the saloon) a scandal to the ship, for though I looked at them a good deal I evidently had not looked at them so continuously and so hungrily as Mrs. Peck. Nevertheless the probability was that they knew what was thought of them--what naturally would be--and simply didn't care. That made Miss Mavis out rather cynical and even a little immodest; and yet, somehow, if she had such qualities I did not dislike her for them. I don't know what strange, secret excuses I found for her. I presently indeed encountered a need for them on the spot, for just as I was on the point of going below again, after several restless turns and (within the limit where smoking was allowed) as many puffs at a cigar as I cared for, I became aware that a couple of figures were seated behind one of the lifeboats that rested on the deck. They were so placed as to be visible only to a person going close to the rail and peering a little sidewise. I don't think I peered, but as I stood a moment beside the rail my eye was attracted by a dusky object which protruded beyond the boat and which, as <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> at a second glance, was the tail of a lady's dress. I bent forward an instant, <b>but</b> even <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> very little more; that scarcely mattered, however, for I took for granted on the spot that the persons concealed in so snug a corner were Jasper Nettlepoint and Mr. Porterfield's intended. Concealed was the word, and I thought it a real pity; there was bad taste in it. I immediately turned away and the next moment I found myself face to face with the captain of the ship. I had already had some conversation with him (he had been so good as to invite me, as he had invited Mrs. Nettlepoint and her son and the young lady travelling with them, and also Mrs. Peck, to sit at his table) and had observed with pleasure that he had the art, not universal on the Atlantic liners, of mingling urbanity with seamanship.|$|R
