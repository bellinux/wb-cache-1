40|$|The {{question}} ofhow precursor T cells mature in the thymus andhow their restriction specificity for self-major histocompatibility gene {{products is}} selected for and functions in vivo particularly in histoincompatible combinations, is still somewhat controversial (1 - 3). The recently discovered murine model ofimmunodeficiency may offer new possibilities to analyze this question. Mice (C. B- 17 H- 2 d) with a homozygous genetic defect on chromosome 2 cannot generate either TCRs or Igs; they {{suffer from a}} severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SLID) (4, 5). This immunodeficiency can readily be reversed by the transplantation of H- 2 -compatible stem cells from normal heterozygous littermates or of H- 2 -compatible normal stem cells. Because of their profound immunodeficiency, SCID mice readily accept H- 2 incompatible stem cell grafts without prior irradiation; therefore, this model offers the possibility to study T lymphocyte interactions in an H- 2 d host with an H- 2 d thymus, with functional T cells and B cells exclusively of H- 2 <b>b</b> <b>origin</b> {{in the presence of}} APC of both H- 2 d and H- 2 b type.

MethodsBetween year 2008 and 2012, a total of 17 patients underwent PCI for an angiographically significant lesion in the right coronary artery of an anomalous origin in the LSOV. Their procedure details such as usage of catheters, radiation time, amount of contrast used were assessed. ResultsA total of 17 patients with anomalous right coronary artery underwent PCI during the above mentioned period. 8 patients had type A origin, 3 had type <b>B</b> <b>origin</b> and the remaining 6 had type C origin. Type A origin RCA were successfully cannulated in 6 patients with Judkins left 5. 0 and in 2 patients using Judkins left 4. 0.

The grasshopper Eyprepocnemis plorans plorans harbour supernumerary chromosomes in all natural populations hitherto analyzed from the Circum-Mediterranean region, with the single exception of {{the headwaters of the}} Iberian Segura River and several of its tributaries. To ascertain the causes of this distribution pattern, we analyze here the genetic structure of five natural populations collected in this zone (two +B and three -B), by means of ISSR markers. We found significant population structure, with two kinds of populations coinciding with +B and -B ones, separated by strong barriers to gene flow. This gives strong support to the hypothesis that the non-B populations precede <b>B</b> <b>origin,</b> and that B-carrying individuals from coastal zones have been able to colonize upstream areas, until geographical barriers (usually narrow canyons and arid areas surrounding them) impeded their advance...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The galactic {{chemical}} {{evolution of}} Be and B provides unique {{information about the}} origin and history of cosmic rays.

However, the data are not unequivocal about the nature of Be and <b>B</b> <b>origin,</b> as encoded in the primary or secondary (linear or quadratic) scaling with metallicity. We summarize a careful analysis of the trends among Be, B, Fe, and O observations. We show that if O/Fe is constant, some other cosmic ray origin or component is needed. On the other hand, if O/Fe is not constant, as recent data suggest, then the data could indicate a standard cosmic ray origin, wherein the abundances of cosmic rays scale with those of the ISM. We suggest future observational tests which will distinguish several proposed scenarios of LiBeB and cosmic ray origin. 1...|$|E

We reported the clinical and immunohistochemical characteristics of 10 cases of IVLBCL from Taiwan between 1995 and 2008. Methods: Clinical data were reviewed and immunoperoxidase stains were performed with antibodies against CD 20, CD 10, Bcl- 6, MUM 1, and CD 5. Results: There were eight males and two females with a median age of 59 years. Patients presented with dyspnea (5 / 10), fever (7 / 10), splenomegaly (5 / 10), and bone marrow involvement (8 / 10). Anemia (9 / 10), thrombocytopenia (6 / 10), and elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase or ferritin levels (8 / 10) were also common. Nine cases were CD 20 +CD 10 −Bcl- 6 −, similar to non-germinal center B cells. Six out of seven patients survived after chemotherapy, but three cases with thrombocytopenia that precluded chemotherapy died within 2 months. Conclusion: Our cases of IVLBCL had a non-germinal center <b>B</b> <b>origin</b> and belonged to the Asian variant of this disease.

In this study, this handicap {{was overcome by}} cloning the sequences from the pachytene B chromosomes dissected out of a slide by a micromanipulator followed by degenerate oligonucleotide-primed PCR. The isolated sequences were found to hybridize with genomic DNA in a B-dosage-dependent manner and with the pachytene B chromosome by {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (FISH), corroborating their <b>B</b> <b>origin.</b> A total of 19 B sequences were isolated, all of which are repetitive and, with one exception, are homologous to the A chromosome(s). Three sequences have strong homology to maize sequences that include two knob repeats and one zein gene (noncoding region), and 10 others are homologous to the noncoding region of Adh 1, Bz 1, Gag, Zein, and B centromere to a lesser degree. Six sequences have no homology to any gene. In addition to FISH, the B-specific sequence and a partially B-specific one were also mapped, by seven newly characterized TB- 10 L translocations, to a similar location on the central portion of the distal heterochromatic region, spreading over a region of about one-third of the B chromosome. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|A {{previously}} identified human herpesvirus 6 B (HHV- 6 <b>B)</b> <b>origin</b> of DNA replication {{contains two}} binding {{sites for the}} origin-binding protein (OBPH 6 B). We have investigated the functional significance of these sites by determining the replication efficiencies of mutated origin sequences, using a transient replication assay. The results indicate that both sites are required for DNA replication. In addition, we have tested the functional consequences of linear sequence amplifications in the origin. The data show that tandemized origin elements are more efficiently replicated than single-copy origins. Finally, we have determined the extent of interstrain origin sequence variation that exists among HHV- 6 isolates by cloning, sequencing, and analyzing origins {{from a number of}} virus isolates, including examples of both HHV- 6 A and HHV- 6 B. We have previously used a functional method, the transient replication complementation assay, to identify and map a lytic-phase origin of DNA replication (oriLyt) in human her-pesvirus 6 B strain Z 29 [HHV- 6 B (Z 29) ] (6).

40|$|We {{previously}} {{demonstrated by}} a DNA-binding assay {{that the human}} herpesvirus 6 B (HHV- 6 B) replication origin has a structure {{similar to those of}} alphaherpesviruses, although the HHV- 6 B and herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV- 1) origin-binding proteins (OBPs) and origins are not interchangeable. Here we describe additional properties of the interaction between HHV- 6 B OBP and the HHV- 6 <b>B</b> <b>origin.</b> Competitive electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) with DNA duplexes containing single-base alterations allowed deduction of a consensus DNA sequence for HHV- 6 B-specific OBP binding, YGWYCWCCY, where Y is T or C and W is T or A, while that for HSV- 1 -specific binding was reported to be YGYTCGCACT. By EMSA, the HHV- 6 B OBP DNA-binding domain was mapped to a segment containing amino acids 482 to 770. However, in Southwestern (protein-DNA) blotting, the region sufficient for the DNA binding encompassed only amino acids 657 to 770. Similarly, Southwestern blotting showed that amino acids 689 to 851 of HSV- 1 OBP had HSV- 1 origin-binding activity, although this region was insufficient for origin binding in the EMSA. Although the longer DNA-binding domains identified by EMSA have marginal overall homology among HHV- 6 B and alphaherpesvirus OBP homologs, the smaller regions sufficient for the binding observed by Southwestern blotting have significant similarity. From these results, we propose a hypothesis that the DNA-binding domain of herpesvirus OBPs consists of two subdomains, one containing a conserved motif that contacts DNA directly, and another, less well conserved, that may modulate either the conformation or accessibility of the binding domain...|$|E
