5|$|All NHLs {{are also}} {{included}} on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), a list of historic properties that the National Park Service deems to <b>be</b> <b>worthy</b> <b>of</b> preservation. The NHLs in Michigan comprise approximately 2% of the 1,757 properties and districts listed on the National Register of Historic Places in Michigan as of January 2012. The primary difference between a NHL and a NRHP listing is that the NHLs are determined to have national significance, while other NRHP properties are deemed significant at the local or state level.|$|E
5|$|Gyromitra caroliniana is {{the type}} species of {{subgenus}} Caroliniana of genus Gyromitra. This grouping comprises species that have, in maturity, coarsely reticulate ascospores (i.e., with a network of ridges on the surface) with multiple blunt spines that originate from the reticulum on the spores. Other species in this subgenus include G.fastigiata and the central European species G.parma. In 1969, Erich Heinz Benedix believed that the spore reticulation was sufficiently unique to <b>be</b> <b>worthy</b> <b>of</b> designation as a separate genus, and he described Fastigiella to contain G.caroliniana. Harri Harmaja disagreed, later placing Fastigiella in synonymy with Gyromitra.|$|E
5|$|Monument Valley is an indie puzzle game {{developed}} {{and published by}} Ustwo Games. The player leads the princess Ida through mazes of optical illusions and impossible objects while manipulating the world around her to reach various platforms. Monument Valley was developed over ten months beginning in early 2013 based on concept drawings by company artist Ken Wong. Its visual style was inspired by Japanese prints, minimalist sculpture, and indie games Windosill, Fez, and , and was compared by critics to M. C. Escher drawings and Echochrome. The art was designed such that each frame would <b>be</b> <b>worthy</b> <b>of</b> public display. After a closed beta test, it was released for iOS on April 3, 2014, and was later ported to Android and Windows Phone. The game received generally favorable reviews. Critics praised its art and sound design, but noted its lack of difficulty and short length. It won a 2014 Apple Design Award, was named Apple's best iPad game of 2014, and sold over two million copies by January 2015; by May 2016, sales of the game exceeded 26 million.|$|E

After the failure of Daera in 1953, Pakeezah as an idea, was roaming around in Amrohi's mind. A concept, he said, was irretrievably fixed by his love for his wife. He hoped to create a film which would <b>be</b> <b>worthy</b> <b>of</b> her as an actress, and worthy of the love he felt for her as a woman.

25|$|Pope Pius IX {{appointed}} him Bishop of Melbourne, {{and he was}} consecrated bishop by John Bede Polding on 6 August 1848 (the feast of the Transfiguration) in old St Mary's Cathedral Sydney. He transferred to Melbourne, travelling overland in 19 days, being installed on 8 October 1848 in his first Cathedral, St Francis Church in Lonsdale Street. Goold was only the second Roman Catholic bishop in Australia. He arrived in his new town to find only two Catholic church buildings, four priests in the diocese, no religious sisters or brothers, and a population around 11,000. Five acres of land on Eastern Hill, after negotiations begun in 1848, were finally granted by the crown on 1 April 1851 and shortly afterwards became the site of St Patrick's cathedral and the bishop's palace. The discovery of gold in this year enormously increased the population of Melbourne, and it was realized that the church of St Patrick that had been begun would not <b>be</b> <b>worthy</b> <b>of</b> the growing city. It was decided to build a great cathedral – St Patrick's Cathedral, Melbourne. In 1858 William Wardell, then government architect, was asked to draw up the plans, and the first stone of the new building was laid in December 1858. For the remainder of Goold's life he was much occupied with the raising of funds for the cathedral. Within thirteen years of arriving in Melbourne, the capable and determined Goold had {{increased the number of}} church buildings in Melbourne to 64.|$|E
