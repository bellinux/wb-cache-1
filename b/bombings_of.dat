The Allied fleet did not conduct any other bombardments as Japan surrendered on 15 August.|$|E

50|$|The blast {{may have}} been tied to the {{fighting}} in the north, or it {{may have been}} tied to the series <b>of</b> <b>bombings</b> and assassinations <b>of</b> anti-Syrian figures going back to Rafiq Hariri's killing.|$|R
5|$|Finally, in mid-August, the {{fighting}} on Borneo {{came to an}} end following the atomic <b>bombings</b> <b>of</b> Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the subsequent surrender of Japan. After this the 2/9th Battalion carried out various garrison duties such as guarding prisoners of war and maintaining internal security while the demobilisation process took place. As personnel were repatriated back to Australia or transferred to other units for further service, the battalion's strength dropped until it was finally disbanded on 3 January 1946 while still at Balikpapan.|$|E
5|$|Gordon and Greenwalt {{wrote the}} episode after being {{inspired}} by {{an article in}} Scientific American about time travel and quantum physics. The idea of a scientist {{trying to stop the}} invention of something terrible was inspired by Manhattan Project physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, who complained to Harry S. Truman about the 1945 atomic <b>bombings</b> <b>of</b> Japan.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, {{following}} {{protests from}} the Samyukta Maharashtra movement, {{the city was}} incorporated into the dominion of the newly created Maharashtra State from Bombay State. The city's secular fabric was torn apart in the communal riots of 1992–93, while the <b>bombings</b> <b>of</b> 1993 caused extensive loss of life and property. The city was renamed Mumbai on 6 March 1996.|$|E
50|$|The pro-Soviet forces {{tried to}} provoke {{violence}} and seize power in Latvia. A series <b>of</b> <b>bombings</b> occurred in December 1990, Marshal of the Soviet Union Dmitry Yazov {{admitted that the}} military {{was responsible for the}} first four <b>bombings,</b> perpetrators <b>of</b> the other <b>bombings</b> remain unknown, the pro-Communist press of the time blamed Latvian nationalists.|$|R
50|$|Numerous related arrests {{followed}} {{after the}} <b>bombings.</b> As <b>of</b> 26 March, twelve {{men had been}} arrested {{in connection with the}} bombings.|$|R
50|$|Estimates {{say that}} over 750,000 pets were killed {{over the course}} of the event. Many pet owners, after getting over the fear <b>of</b> <b>bombings</b> and lack <b>of</b> food, regretted killing their pets and blamed the {{government}} for starting the hysteria.|$|R
5|$|Japan {{announced}} its {{surrender to the}} Allies on August 15, six days after the bombing of Nagasaki and the Soviet Union's declaration of war. On September 2, the Japanese government signed the instrument of surrender, effectively ending World War II. The justification for the <b>bombings</b> <b>of</b> Hiroshima and Nagasaki is still debated to this day.|$|E
5|$|Missouri {{was active}} in the Pacific Theatre of World War II, escorting the Fast Carrier Task Forces and {{shelling}} beachheads for Allied Army and Marine Corps personnel involved in amphibious operations against the Imperial Japanese forces.

5|$|On 17 August 1945, {{shortly after}} the atomic <b>bombings</b> <b>of</b> Hiroshima and Nagasaki and with Japan's defeat an {{increasing}} certainty, President Sukarno proclaimed {{the independence of the}} Indonesian state. During the ongoing revolution against returning Dutch forces, Europeans were detained (although the Dutch head pastors remained). These detentions, and post-revolution politics which decimated the European population in independent Indonesia, ensured that the congregation remained dominated by the Javanese and other indigenous peoples.|$|E

It has since signed and ratified the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Switzerland never possessed biological or chemical weapons.|$|E

25|$|Between May 2002 and September 2004, the Chechen and Chechen-led militants, mostly {{answering}} to Shamil Basayev, {{launched a}} campaign of terrorism directed against civilian targets in Russia.

5|$|After {{the atomic}} <b>bombings</b> <b>of</b> Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the {{proclamation}} of Indonesian independence in August 1945, the Japanese began {{withdrawing from the}} nascent republic. The Indonesian republican government, based in Jakarta and including Sukarno as president and Mohammad Hatta as vice president, began to take over infrastructure from the departing Japanese. By September 1945, however, allied British and Dutch forces had begun to enter the archipelago, hoping to reestablish the status quo ante. The British initially focused on Java and Sumatra and attempted to avoid armed confrontations with the Republican forces; the Dutch, meanwhile, spent the first months after the Japanese surrender reclaiming the eastern islands with help from Australia.|$|E

5|$|Along with Oppenheimer, Compton, and Ernest Lawrence, Fermi {{was part}} of the {{scientific}} panel that advised the Interim Committee on target selection. The panel agreed with the committee that atomic bombs would be used without warning against an industrial target. Like others at the Los Alamos Laboratory, Fermi found out about the atomic <b>bombings</b> <b>of</b> Hiroshima and Nagasaki from the public address system in the technical area. Fermi did not believe that atomic bombs would deter nations from starting wars, nor did he think that the time was ripe for world government. He therefore did not join the Association of Los Alamos Scientists.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the war in Europe, it {{had been}} planned to send the {{division}} to Burma to form an airborne corps with the 44th Indian Airborne Division. However, the atomic <b>bombings</b> <b>of</b> Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and the Japanese surrender, ended the war and changed British plans. The 6th Airborne Division was nominated to be the Imperial Strategic Reserve. Together with a Royal Air Force troop-carrier formation, they were to be located in the Middle East as a quick reaction peace keeping force for the British Empire. Initially No. 283 Wing RAF had two squadrons of transport aircraft, 620 and 644, available to provide troop transport.|$|E
5|$|By 1943, the Allies {{had gained}} air superiority over Germany, and <b>bombings</b> <b>of</b> German cities and {{industry}} had become commonplace. However, the Allies in their strategic bombing campaign did not concentrate on industry, and Speer {{was able to}} overcome bombing losses. In spite of these losses, German production of tanks {{more than doubled in}} 1943, production of planes increased by 80 percent, and production time for Kriegsmarine submarines was reduced from one year to two months. Production would continue to increase until the second half of 1944.|$|E
