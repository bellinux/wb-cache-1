25|$|From the <b>Bolson,</b> the Comanche {{branched}} {{out in all}} directions in small and large groups to raid into tropical Mexico {{as far south as}} Jalisco and Querétaro. Each warrior took three or four horses with him, saving his favorite for battle. Women and children commonly traveled with the men and were prepared to defend themselves if necessary. A weakness of the Comanche was their determination to recover the bodies of their fallen warriors. They took extreme risks and suffered additional casualties as a result. Moreover, they often seemed careless and were sometimes caught unawares by large contingents of Mexican soldiers.|$|E
25|$|Immediately {{east from}} the coast are the Andes, cut by deep fjords {{in the south and}} by deep lakes in the north, and with varying {{temperatures}} according to the altitude. The tree line ranges from close to 2,000 m on the northern side (except for the Andes in northern Neuquén in Argentina, where sunnier and dryer conditions allow trees to grow up to close to 3,000 m), and diminishes southward to only 600–800 m in Tierra del Fuego. Precipitation changes dramatically from one spot to the other, and diminishes very quickly eastward. An example of this is Laguna Frías, in Argentina, receives 4,400mm yearly. The city of Bariloche, about 40km further east, receives about 1,000mm, and the airport, another 15km east, receives less than 600mm. The easterly slopes of the Andes are home to several Argentine cities: San Martín de los Andes, Bariloche, El <b>Bolsón,</b> Esquel, El Calafate. Temperatures there are milder in the summer (in the north, between 20°C and 24°C, with cold nights between 4°C and 9°C; in the south, summers are between 16°C and 20°C, at night temperatures are similar to the north) and much colder in the winter, with frequent snowfall (although snow cover rarely lasts very long). Daytime highs range from 3°C to 9°C in the north, and from 0°C to 7°C in the south, whereas nights range from −5°C to 2°C everywhere. Cold waves can bring much colder values: -21°C have been recorded in Bariloche, and most places can often see temperatures between −12°C and −15°C and highs staying around 0°C for a few days.|$|E
500|$|Evidence {{indicates}} that such calderas can fill in within a timespan of hundreds {{to thousands of}} years. Two possible scenarios of an eruption are the formation of Plinian eruption columns or more tranquil subhorizontal eruption of pyroclastic flows from vents. Given the low population density of 0.06 people per , {{the impact of the}} eruption on local population will be small. Westerly winds may cause larger impact west of the centre, with air travel particularly affected. The community of <b>Bolsón</b> de Fiambalá [...] south of the caldera is beneath the level of Cerro Blanco and connected to it by valleys. In a future eruption, pyroclastic currents and less dense clouds associated with them from Cerro Blanco might reach the community.|$|E

40|$|The present paper {{presents}} hydraulic {{evidence for}} the interbasin circulation of ground water through carbonate rocks of Paleozoic age at the Nevada Test Site. An integral part of this evidence is the discovery that aquifers in alluvium and tuff, formerly {{thought to be the}} principal aquifers at the Test Site, are semiperched above a thick tuffaceous aquiclude that separates them from the carbonate rocks. This paper is based on one of the studies being made by the GeologicalSurvey for the Atomic Energy Commission. These studies seek to evaluatethe risk that may arise if ground water should be contaminated as a resultof underground nuclear detonations at the Test Site. In summary, the movement of ground water in the valley fill and the tuffs beneath the <b>bolsons</b> of the Nevada Test Site is vertically downward into the Paleozoic carbonate rocks. The ground water moves laterally in the carbonate rocks beneath all three basins toward discharge areas, presumably to the southwest. Ground-water flow beneath some intermontane basins differs significantly from the usual picture of flow down the axis of an intermontane valley to a spill point at one end or flow to discharge areas within the basin, such as playas or springs...|$|R

40|$|The Groundwater Availability Model (GAM) for the Igneous {{and parts}} of the West Texas <b>Bolsons</b> (Salt Basin) {{aquifers}} was used to estimate drawdowns over a fifty year time period in Jeff Davis and Presidio counties when pumping at the year 2000 rates. Drawdowns for average and drought-of-record recharge conditions were also compared. The following conclusions can be drawn from the results of this modeling study. • The use of drought-of-record recharge has negligible impact on the results of the modeling in the Salt Basin aquifer when compared to the use of average recharge. This is because the GAM assumes that the Salt Basin aquifer receives no direct recharge from precipitation; therefore, drought-of-record recharge has virtually no effect on water levels in this aquifer. • The use of drought-of-record recharge has minimal impact on the results of the modeling in the Igneous aquifer when compared to the use of average recharge. The difference in water levels and drawdowns between the average and drought-of-record recharge runs was less than ten feet for most of the area, except {{in the heart of the}} Davis Mountains where there is no pumpage in the model. • Drawdowns in the Salt Basin aquifer were much higher in Jeff Davis County than in Presidio County. This is because of pumpage in Culberson County which impacted water levels in the northern portion of the Salt Basin aquifer in Jef...|$|R

6000|$|... "That was {{yesterday}} evening on the Plaza, while {{he sat on}} the steps of the cathedral, his hands between his knees, holding the bridle of his famous silver-grey mare. He had led his body of Cargadores splendidly all day long. He looked fatigued. I don't know how I looked. Very dirty, I suppose. But I suppose I also looked pleased. From the time the fugitive President had been got off to the S. S. Minerva, the tide of success had turned against the mob. They had been driven off the harbour, and out of the better streets of the town, into their own maze of ruins and tolderias. You must understand that this riot, whose primary object was undoubtedly the getting hold of the San Tome silver stored in the lower rooms of the Custom House (besides the general looting of the Ricos), had acquired a political colouring from the fact of two Deputies to the Provincial Assembly, Senores Gamacho and Fuentes, both from <b>Bolson,</b> putting themselves at the head of it--late in the afternoon, it is true, when the mob, disappointed in their hopes of loot, made a stand in the narrow streets to the cries of 'Viva la Libertad! Down with Feudalism!' (I wonder what they imagine feudalism to be?) 'Down with the Goths and Paralytics.' I suppose the Senores Gamacho and Fuentes knew what they were doing. They are prudent gentlemen. In the Assembly they called themselves Moderates, and opposed every energetic measure with philanthropic pensiveness. At the first rumours of Montero's victory, they showed a subtle change of the pensive temper, and began to defy poor Don Juste Lopez in his Presidential tribune with an effrontery to which the poor man could only respond by a dazed smoothing of his beard and the ringing of the presidential bell. Then, when the downfall of the Ribierist cause became confirmed beyond the shadow of a doubt, they have blossomed into convinced Liberals, acting together as if they were Siamese twins, and ultimately taking charge, as it were, of the riot in the name of Monterist principles.|$|E
6000|$|Hernandez, the robber, {{had been}} an inoffensive, small ranchero, kidnapped with {{circumstances}} of peculiar atrocity from his home {{during one of the}} civil wars, and forced to serve in the army. There his conduct as soldier was exemplary, till, watching his chance, he killed his colonel, and managed to get clear away. With a band of deserters, who chose him for their chief, he had taken refuge beyond the wild and waterless <b>Bolson</b> de Tonoro. The haciendas paid him blackmail in cattle and horses; extraordinary stories were told of his powers and of his wonderful escapes from capture. He used to ride, single-handed, into the villages and the little towns on the Campo, driving a pack mule before him, with two revolvers in his belt, go straight to the shop or store, select what he wanted, and ride away unopposed because of the terror his exploits and his audacity inspired. Poor country people he usually left alone; the upper class were often stopped on the roads and robbed; but any unlucky official that fell into his hands was sure to get a severe flogging. The army officers did not like his name to be mentioned in their presence. His followers, mounted on stolen horses, laughed at the pursuit of the regular cavalry sent to hunt them down, and whom they took pleasure to ambush most scientifically in the broken ground of their own fastness. Expeditions had been fitted out; a price had been put upon his head; even attempts had been made, treacherously of course, to open negotiations with him, without in the slightest way affecting the even tenor of his career. At last, in true Costaguana fashion, the Fiscal of Tonoro, who was ambitious of the glory of having reduced the famous Hernandez, offered him a sum of money and a safe conduct out of the country for the betrayal of his band. But Hernandez evidently was not of the stuff of which the distinguished military politicians and conspirators of Costaguana are made. This clever but common device (which frequently works like a charm in putting down revolutions) failed with the chief of vulgar Salteadores. It promised well for the Fiscal at first, but ended very badly for the squadron of lanceros posted (by the Fiscal's directions) in a fold of the ground into which Hernandez had promised to lead his unsuspecting followers They came, indeed, at the appointed time, but creeping on their hands and knees through the bush, and only let their presence be known by a general discharge of firearms, which emptied many saddles. The troopers who escaped came riding very hard into Tonoro. It is said that their commanding officer (who, being better mounted, rode far ahead of the rest) afterwards got into a state of despairing intoxication and beat the ambitious Fiscal severely with the flat of his sabre in the presence of his wife and daughters, for bringing this disgrace upon the National Army. The highest civil official of Tonoro, falling to the ground in a swoon, was further kicked all over the body and rowelled with sharp spurs about the neck and face because of the great sensitiveness of his military colleague. This gossip of the inland Campo, so characteristic of the rulers of the country with its story of oppression, inefficiency, fatuous methods, treachery, and savage brutality, was perfectly known to Mrs. Gould. That it should be accepted with no indignant comment by people of intelligence, refinement, and character as something inherent in the nature of things was one of the symptoms of degradation that had the power to exasperate her almost to the verge of despair.
