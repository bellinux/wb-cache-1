25|$|In Quinn's first start, the Irish were bolstered with Quinn's 297passing {{yards on}} 59attempts.

Quinn {{remained}} as the starter and, with Willingham's acknowledgment that the running game needed to take more of a role in the next game, got his first win against Pittsburgh.

Notre Dame lost their next three games, including Willingham's second straight 31point loss to USC, a last minute loss to Boston College, and their first home shutout since 1978 to Florida State. The Irish players began to call the season disappointing, as the team needed to win their last four games to make a bowl game. They looked to have a chance of becoming bowl eligible, as their next three games were a last minute win that improved their streak to 40games over Navy, a win on senior day over the Brigham Young University (BYU) Cougars, and a win over Stanford that saw the Irish offense finally connect in the season. Notre Dame lost their final game to Syracuse, however. With a 5‚Äì7 record, the Irish finished with the twelfth losing season {{in the history of the}} Notre Dame football program.|$|E

Purdue then got on the board on a broken play where QB Rob Henry scrambled for a 22-yard touchdown run. On the next Wisconsin drive, QB Joel Stave's pass was intercepted by CB Ricardo Allen and returned to the Wisconsin 10-yard line. The Badgers defense was able to hold the Boilermakers to a field goal to make the score 14‚Äì10 Wisconsin. The Badgers then marched right down the field and scored on a Milevin Gordon 27-yard touchdown run. After another Purdue three-and-out, the Badgers again moved the ball with ease against the <b>Boilermaker</b> defense but stalled out and settled for a 32-yard field goal by K Kyle French.
