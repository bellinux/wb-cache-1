5|$|Virginia headed {{directly}} for the Union squadron. The battle opened when Union tug Zouave fired on the advancing enemy, and Beaufort replied. This preliminary skirmishing had no effect. Virginia did not open fire {{until she was}} within easy range of Cumberland. Return fire from Cumberland and Congress <b>bounced</b> <b>off</b> the iron plates without penetrating, although later some of Cumberlands payload lightly damaged Virginia.|$|E
5|$|The Lions {{rushed for}} 190yards, while holding the Buccaneers to 47. Lions quarterback Chuck Long was 12 of 23 for 108yards and a touchdown, while Testaverde was 20–39 for 262yards and a touchdown. The Lions intercepted Testaverde once and sacked him four times, as they broke a four-game losing streak. Testaverde was lucky {{that it was}} not worse, as three of his {{potential}} turnovers were called back due to Lions penalties. On another two occasions, balls that <b>bounced</b> <b>off</b> of his receivers' fingertips wound up caught by other Buccaneer receivers.|$|E
5|$|During the 2013 Masters, Woods {{was up for}} {{disqualification}} over {{claims that}} he took an illegal drop on the par-5 15th hole after his third shot had <b>bounced</b> <b>off</b> of the pin and into the water. After further review, Woods was assessed a two-stroke penalty for the drop and was not disqualified. He finished tied for fourth in the event. Woods won The Players Championship in May 2013, his second career win at the event, notching his fourth win of the 2013 season. It was the quickest he had ever gotten to four wins in any season in his professional career.|$|E

Most high-flying techniques can be performed after a spring board, i.e. springboard legdrop, springboard dropkick. Sometimes wrestlers will <b>bounce</b> <b>off</b> one set of ring ropes then off another to perform a move, this {{is referred to as}} a double springboard, the most notable double springboard move is a version of a springboard moonsault in which a wrestler <b>bounces</b> <b>off</b> the rope to elevate himself/herself to the top-rope from where he/she <b>bounces</b> <b>off</b> to perform the moonsault.|$|R

5|$|In {{his second}} season with the Wild Ballard was hit by the New York Islanders' Matt Martin after making a pass. The hit was {{delivered}} as Ballard turned away from Martin. Ballard's head struck a glass partition and as he fell his head <b>bounced</b> <b>off</b> the ice. He lay on the ice {{for a few minutes}} before being able to leave the ice on his own. Ballard suffered a concussion and multiple facial fractures as a result. He was taken to Regions Hospital for evaluation and observation and released the next day. There was no penalty or suspension in result of the hit.|$|E
5|$|On August 1, 1844, Wickliffe {{and two of}} {{his daughters}} boarded the {{steamship}} Georgia traveling from Old Point Comfort in Virginia to Baltimore, Maryland. While en route, he was stabbed in the chest by a man wielding a claspknife. The knife <b>bounced</b> <b>off</b> Wickliffe's breastbone without damaging any major internal organs, and a U.S. Navy officer prevented a second blow from hitting Wickliffe. Wickliffe's attacker, J. McLean Gardner, was disarmed and arrested. Later that night, he wrote Wickliffe a letter of apology. Wickliffe was not seriously injured, and returned home three days after the attack. Gardner was tried and found to be insane; he was later sent to an asylum.|$|E
5|$|On {{the first}} play of the drive, Clark was sacked by Kenny Smith for a six-yard loss. Pegues ran for one yard, then ran for 12yards on third down. The Hokies punted after going three and out, but the ball <b>bounced</b> <b>off</b> Alabama kick {{returner}} Alvin Richard. The loose ball was recovered by Virginia Tech's Cory Bird, and the Hokies' offense returned to the field with 35 seconds remaining in the quarter. From the Alabama 19-yard line, Clark scrambled for a one-yard gain. The play {{was the last one}} of the third quarter, which ended with Virginia Tech leading, 247.|$|E

5|$|The Celtics {{were unable}} to repeat their title in 1987 despite several {{dramatic}} playoff victories. Johnson played strong defense again, earning yet another appearance on the All-Defensive First Team, and the Celtics embarked on a nail-biting playoff campaign. In the 1987 Eastern Conference Semifinals, the Celtics split the first six games against the Milwaukee Bucks. In the deciding Game 7, which the Celtics won, Johnson had a spectacular play with 1:30 left in the game: a Celtics ball threatened to fly out of bounds, but Johnson dived for it and whipped it backwards in mid-air against Bucks center and former Sonics teammate Jack Sikma. The ball <b>bounced</b> <b>off</b> Sikma before going out of bounds, and the Celtics maintained possession.|$|E
5|$|The ball <b>bounced</b> <b>off</b> a Virginia Tech player, {{causing a}} {{scramble}} for the loose ball. Virginia Tech recovered it at their 19-yard line, and Druckenmiller started a hurry-up offensive drive for the Hokies, who had 56 seconds {{to move into}} scoring possession. On the first play, Druckenmiller completed an 18-yard play to move {{the ball to the}} Tech 38-yard line. Druckenmiller then completed a 16-yard pass to Holmes for a first down at the Texas 46-yard line. From there, however, Druckenmiller threw three incomplete passes and Tech punted with 15 seconds remaining in the first half. Texas ran out the remaining seconds on the clock and went into halftime with a 107 lead.|$|E
5|$|Air Force's post-score kickoff {{went out}} of bounds, {{resulting}} in a penalty that allowed Tech to automatically start its second offensive possession of the game at its 35-yard line. On his first play, Randall completed a 19-yard pass that drove the Hokie offense into Air Force territory {{for the first time}} and gained Tech another first down. Two plays later, Randall completed another pass, this time a 16-yard toss that pushed Tech to the Air Force 30-yard line. Though the Hokies gained several more yards on short plays, they were unable to earn another first down. Tech kicker Carter Warley was sent into the game to attempt a 41-yard field goal, but the kick <b>bounced</b> <b>off</b> the right upright and Tech was denied three points. With 4:59 remaining in the first quarter, Air Force still held a 10–0 lead.|$|E

5|$|Ballard's {{survey found}} no {{underwater}} penetrations of the ship's fully armoured citadel. Eight holes {{were found in}} the hull, one on the starboard side and seven on the port side, all above the waterline. One of the holes is in the deck, on the bow's starboard side. The angle and shape indicates the shell that created the hole was fired from Bismarcks port side and struck the starboard anchor chain. The anchor chain has disappeared down this hole. Six holes are amidships, three shell fragments pierced the upper splinter belt, and one made a hole in the main armour belt. Further aft a huge hole is visible, parallel to the aircraft catapult, on the deck. The submersibles recorded no sign of a shell penetration through the main or side armour here, and {{it is likely that the}} shell penetrated the deck armour only. Huge dents showed that many of the 14inch shells fired by King George V <b>bounced</b> <b>off</b> the German belt armour.|$|E
5|$|Bleak then {{returned}} to the patrol and attempted to treat more wounded members, but soon thereafter a Chinese hand grenade <b>bounced</b> <b>off</b> the helmet of the soldier standing next to him and landed nearby. Bleak tackled the soldier over and covered him with his larger frame to protect him from the grenade, but neither was injured in the ensuing blast. The patrol then continued on its mission, and was successful in capturing several Chinese prisoners. However, as it descended Hill 499 to return to UN lines, they were ambushed by another group of Chinese hidden in a trench with an automatic weapon. Three of the other soldiers were wounded in the attack, and as Bleak attempted to run to them, he was hit in the leg. Bleak dressed all four wounds, but one of the men had been hit too critically to move. In spite of continued Chinese fire and his own injury, Bleak picked up the wounded soldier and began to carry him down the hill.|$|E
5|$|Clemson's post-touchdown kickoff was bobbled by kick {{returner}} Andre Kendrick at the Tech one-yard line, but Kendrick {{broke free}} of the Clemson defense for a 34-yard return to the 35-yard line. Tech's first play after the return was an 11-yard run by Lee Suggs up {{the right side of}} the field. After the first down, Suggs ran straight ahead for a short gain, then Vick scrambled to the Clemson 37-yard line and another first down. Suggs then gained 18 yards on a run to the left side of the field. At the Clemson 19-yard line, Suggs was stopped for a loss of one yard, then Vick was sacked for a loss of five yards. The third-down play was an incomplete pass, and Carter Warley entered the game to attempt a 42-yard field goal. The kick <b>bounced</b> <b>off</b> the field goal crossbar but did not cross it, thus denying the Hokies three points. With 10:33 remaining in the half, Tech still had a 147 lead.|$|E

5|$|For {{the second}} {{consecutive}} season, the Penguins played the Detroit Red Wings in the Stanley Cup Finals, marking {{the first time in}} 25years that two teams played each other in consecutive Finals. Tickets for Games 3 and 4, which were hosted at Mellon Arena, sold out in 10minutes. In {{the first game of the}} series, the Red Wings scored the first goal when a puck shot by Brad Stuart ricocheted off the boards behind the goal, then <b>bounced</b> <b>off</b> Marc-Andre Fleury and into the net. Ruslan Fedotenko, with an assist from Evgeni Malkin, tied the game before the conclusion of the first period. Detroit went on to score a goal in each of the final two periods to win Game 1, 3–1. Evgeni Malkin scored a powerplay goal in the first period of game two, but the Penguins were held scoreless for the remainder of the contest; falling 3–1 for a second consecutive game.|$|E
5|$|Galatasaray's Ergün Penbe {{stepped up}} {{to take the first}} spot kick and scored. He placed the ball inside the near {{right-hand}} corner, just past Seaman, who dived to his left. Davor Šuker was the first man up to take Arsenal's penalty kick. His effort proved to be unsuccessful, as the ball hit the left-hand post and <b>bounced</b> <b>off</b> the goal. Şükür became the next player to take Galatasaray's spot kick. He scored as he lobbed the ball in the right-hand corner. With Galatasaray leading 2–0, Arsenal's next penalty taker was Parlour. He placed the ball on the spot and successfully scored by burying the ball to Taffarel's right to make it 2–1. Ümit Davala calmly placed the goal, near the centre of the goal to make it 3–1 to Galatasaray. Arsenal's only hope now was Vieira, but the midfielder missed and hit the crossbar instead. Popescu then stepped up, and netted with a powerful shot, as Galatasaray won the penalty shoot-out 4–1.|$|E
5|$|Optical {{coherence}} tomography (OCT) is {{a medical}} imaging technique using low-coherence interferometry to provide tomographic visualization of internal tissue microstructures. As seen in Fig.22, {{the core of a}} typical OCT system is a Michelson interferometer. One interferometer arm is focused onto the tissue sample and scans the sample in an X-Y longitudinal raster pattern. The other interferometer arm is <b>bounced</b> <b>off</b> a reference mirror. Reflected light from the tissue sample is combined with reflected light from the reference. Because of the low coherence of the light source, interferometric signal is observed only over a limited depth of sample. X-Y scanning therefore records one thin optical slice of the sample at a time. By performing multiple scans, moving the reference mirror between each scan, an entire three-dimensional image of the tissue can be reconstructed. Recent advances have striven to combine the nanometer phase retrieval of coherent interferometry with the ranging capability of low-coherence interferometry.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the next}} three games, Kansas outscored its opponents 162–16. As Kansas's Big 12 {{schedule}} began, the Jayhawks' winning ways continued, as they proved themselves against legitimate competition. On October 6, Kansas traveled to Manhattan, Kansas, home of then-ranked No.24 Kansas State University for the opening game of its Big12 schedule. In front of 50,924hostile fans, Kansas quarterback Todd Reesing struggled {{for the first time}} in the season. Late in the fourth quarter, Reesing threw a ball that <b>bounced</b> <b>off</b> the facemask of wide receiver Dexton Fields before being intercepted. The interception set up a Kansas State touchdown that put Kansas into a 2421 hole with seven and a half minutes remaining. Reesing and the Jayhawks struck back quickly, however, and scored a 30-yard touchdown to take the lead for good.|$|E
5|$|Sounds {{right fielder}} Caleb Gindl became the third player in team history to hit for the cycle when he {{accomplished}} the feat on July 10, 2011. Center fielder Logan Schafer garnered national media attention when he initiated a triple play on August 20, 2011, against the Omaha Storm Chasers. What made the rare occurrence even more unusual {{is that the}} ball first <b>bounced</b> <b>off</b> Schafer's glove and head before landing in his glove for the first out. He then returned {{the ball to the}} infield where second baseman Eric Farris and first baseman Mat Gamel completed the triple play by stepping on their respective bases. With Money at the helm, Nashville ended the year with a 71–73 record, placing third in their division.|$|E
5|$|The opening {{passages}} {{of the match}} were tentative. Faced with a hostile atmosphere, Liverpool were content {{to sit back and}} frustrate Roma. Despite this tactic, Liverpool took the lead in the 15th minute. Souness and Sammy Lee exchanged passes before passing to Craig Johnston on the right hand side of the pitch. Johnston played a high cross into the Roma penalty area, which was challenged for by Roma goalkeeper Franco Tancredi and Ronnie Whelan. The result was that Tancredi dropped the ball, Roma defenders tried to clear the ball, but Michele Nappi's attempted clearance <b>bounced</b> <b>off</b> Tancredi's back and fell to Liverpool defender Phil Neal who scored to give Liverpool a 1–0 lead. Two minutes later, Souness volleyed the ball into the Roma goal from close range, but his goal was disallowed for offside.|$|E
