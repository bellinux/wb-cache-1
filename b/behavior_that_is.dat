25|$|Psychological abuse, also {{referred}} to as emotional abuse or mental abuse, is a form of abuse characterized by a person subjecting or exposing another to <b>behavior</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> psychologically harmful. Such abuse is often associated with situations of power imbalance, such as abusive relationships, bullying, child abuse and in the workplace.|$|E
25|$|The {{third major}} {{form of social}} {{influence}} is obedience; this {{is a change in}} <b>behavior</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> the result of a direct order or command from another person. Obedience as a form of compliance was dramatically highlighted by the Milgram study, wherein people were ready to administer shocks to a person in distress on a researcher's command.|$|E
25|$|The {{second major}} area of social {{influence}} research is compliance. Compliance refers to {{any change in}} <b>behavior</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> due to a request or suggestion from another person. The foot-in-the-door technique is a compliance method in which the persuader requests a small favor and then follows up with requesting a larger favor, e.g., asking for the time and then asking for ten dollars. A related trick is the bait and switch.|$|E

25|$|The World Health Organization's {{classification}} system defines a manic episode as one where mood {{is higher than}} the person's situation warrants and may vary from relaxed high spirits to barely controllable exuberance, accompanied by hyperactivity, a compulsion to speak, a reduced sleep requirement, difficulty sustaining attention and often increased distractibility. Frequently, confidence and self-esteem are excessively enlarged, and grand, extravagant ideas are expressed. <b>Behavior</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> out of character and risky, foolish or inappropriate may result from a loss of normal social restraint.|$|E
25|$|The {{highlighting}} of {{the fact}} that corporeity intrinsically has a dimension of expressivity which proves to be fundamental to the constitution of the ego is one of the conclusions of The Structure of <b>Behavior</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> constantly reiterated in Merleau-Ponty's later works. Following this theme of expressivity, he goes on to examine how an incarnate subject {{is in a position to}} undertake actions that transcend the organic level of the body, such as in intellectual operations and the products of one's cultural life.|$|E

25|$|A {{drive or}} desire can be {{described}} as a deficiency or need that activates <b>behavior</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> aimed at a goal or an incentive. These drives are thought to originate within the individual and may not require external stimuli to encourage the behavior. Basic drives could be sparked by deficiencies such as hunger, which motivates a person to seek food whereas more subtle drives might be the desire for praise and approval, which motivates a person to behave in a manner pleasing to others.|$|E
25|$|According to Islamic law {{apostasy}} {{is identified}} by {{a list of}} actions such as conversion to another religion, denying the existence of God, rejecting the prophets, mocking God or the prophets, idol worship, rejecting the sharia, or permitting <b>behavior</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> forbidden by the sharia, such as adultery or the eating of forbidden foods or drinking of alcoholic beverages. The majority of Muslim scholars hold to the traditional view that apostasy is punishable by death or imprisonment until repentance, at least for adult men of sound mind.|$|E
25|$|The {{strength}} of reinforcement or punishment {{is dependent on}} schedule and timing. A reinforcer or punisher affects the future frequency of a behavior most strongly if it occurs within seconds of the behavior. A <b>behavior</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> reinforced intermittently, at unpredictable intervals, will be more robust and persistent, compared to one that is reinforced every time the behavior is performed. For example, if the misbehaving student in the above example was punished {{a week after the}} troublesome behavior, that might not affect future behavior.|$|E

25|$|Momentum is a {{measurable}} quantity, and the measurement {{depends on the}} motion of the observer. For example: if an apple is sitting in a glass elevator that is descending, an outside observer, looking into the elevator, sees the apple moving, so, to that observer, the apple has a non-zero momentum. To someone inside the elevator, the apple does not move, so, it has zero momentum. The two observers each have a frame of reference, in which, they observe motions, and, if the elevator is descending steadily, they will see <b>behavior</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> consistent with those same physical laws.|$|E
25|$|The action–motivation model {{proposes that}} {{inconsistencies}} in a person's cognition cause mental stress, because psychologic inconsistency {{interferes with the}} person's functioning in the real world. Among the ways for coping, the person can choose to exercise a <b>behavior</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> inconsistent {{with his or her}} current attitude (a belief, an ideal, a value system), but later try to alter that belief to be consonant with a current behaviour; the cognitive dissonance occurs when the person's cognition does not match the action taken. If the person changes the current attitude, after the dissonance occurs, he or she then is obligated to commit to that course of behaviour.|$|E
25|$|The {{ability to}} be able to survive in both fresh and salt water also gives another benefit that has been driven by evolution. Because the {{majority}} of sharks are only able to survive in salt water, the bull shark has evolved to have their offspring in the fresh water where other sharks cannot enter. The freshwater acts as a protective area where the young are able to grow and mature without the threat of larger sharks preying on the younger bull sharks. This is an explanation for the <b>behavior</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> observed from the Bull sharks as to why there would be any reason for the adult bull shark to ever travel into a freshwater area despite being able to tolerate the high salinity of marine water.|$|E

25|$|Discrete choice models {{specify the}} {{probability}} that an individual chooses an option among a set of alternatives. The probabilistic description of discrete choice behavior is used not to reflect individual <b>behavior</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> viewed as intrinsically probabilistic. Rather, it {{is the lack of}} information that leads us to describe choice in a probabilistic fashion. In practice, we cannot know all factors affecting individual choice decisions as their determinants are partially observed or imperfectly measured. Therefore, discrete choice models rely on stochastic assumptions and specifications to account for unobserved factors related to a) choice alternatives, b) taste variation over people (interpersonal heterogeneity) and over time (intra-individual choice dynamics), and c) heterogeneous choice sets. The different formulations have been summarized and classified into groups of models.|$|E
25|$|Like other sexually size-dimorphic birds, female blue-footed boobies usually {{favor the}} smaller sex {{during times of}} food scarcity. Booby chicks do not show clear {{differences}} in size based on sex, but females do grow faster than males, which means they require greater parental investment. Blue-footed boobies display <b>behavior</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> described in the Flexible Investment Hypothesis, which states that a female will adjust the allocation of resources to maximize her lifetime reproductive success. This was shown in an experiment in which females had their flight feathers trimmed, so {{that they had to}} expend more energy during flights to obtain food for their broods. Female chicks of such mothers were more strongly affected than their brothers, in that they had lower masses and shorter wing lengths.|$|E
25|$|In this condition, {{the child}} is allowed to engage {{with a variety of}} items during the session. No demands are placed on the child {{throughout}} the duration of the session. The experimenter provides attention to the individual throughout the session on any <b>behavior</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> not the target behavior. If the target behavior occurs, the experimenter removes attention until the behavior has subsided. This session is meant to act as a control condition, meaning that the environment is enriched for the purpose of the behavior not occurring. Said another way, by meeting environmental needs for all possible functions, the individual is not likely to engage in the behavior of interest. This condition is used as a comparison to the other conditions. Any condition that is elevated to a large degree form the control condition, shows a higher degree experimental control indicating the functional relationship between the specific environmental conditions and the behavior of interest.|$|E
50|$|According to Bandura's social {{cognitive}} learning theory, observational {{learning can}} affect behavior in many ways, with {{both positive and}} negative consequences. It can teach completely new behaviors, for one. It can also increase or decrease the frequency of <b>behaviors</b> <b>that</b> have previously <b>been</b> learned. Observational learning can even encourage <b>behaviors</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> previously forbidden (for example, the violent behavior towards the Bobo doll that children imitated in Albert Bandura's study). Observational learning can also influence <b>behaviors</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> similar to, but not identical to, the ones being modeled. For example, seeing a model excel at playing the piano may motivate an observer to play the saxophone.|$|R
