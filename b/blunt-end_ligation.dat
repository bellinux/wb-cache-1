50|$|<b>Blunt-end</b> <b>ligation,</b> however, is {{much less}} {{efficient}} than sticky end ligation, typically the reaction is 100X slower than sticky-end ligation. Since blunt-end does not have protruding ends, the ligation reaction depends on random collisions between the blunt-ends and is consequently much less efficient. To compensate for the lower efficiency, the concentration of ligase used is higher than sticky end ligation (10x or more).

40|$|Ancient DNA {{extracts}} {{consist of}} a mixture of endogenous molecules and contaminant DNA templates, often originating from environmental microbes. These two populations of templates exhibit different chemical characteristics, with the former showing depurination and cytosine deamination by-products, resulting from post-mortem DNA damage. Such chemical modifications can interfere with the molecular tools used for building second-generation DNA libraries, and limit our ability to fully characterize the true complexity of ancient DNA extracts. In this study, we first use fresh DNA extracts to demonstrate that library preparation based on adapter ligation at AT-overhangs are biased against DNA templates starting with thymine residues, contrarily to <b>blunt-end</b> adapter <b>ligation.</b> We observe the same bias on fresh DNA extracts sheared on Bioruptor, Covaris and nebulizers. This contradicts previous reports suggesting that this bias could originate from {{the methods used for}} shearing DNA. This also suggests that AT-overhang adapter ligation efficiency is affected in a sequence-dependent manner and results in an uneven representation of different genomic contexts. We then show how this bias could affect the base composition of ancient DNA libraries prepared following AT-overhang ligation, mainly by limiting the ability to ligate DNA templates starting with thymines and therefore deaminated cytosines.

50|$|This {{protocol}} {{begins by}} randomly shearing the tested genomic DNA {{into a tight}} size distribution. The sheared DNA molecules are then subjected for the end repair and A-tailed treatment. The end repair treatment converts any damaged or incompatible protruding ends of DNA to 5’-phosphorylated and blunt-ended DNA, enabling immediate <b>blunt-end</b> <b>ligation,</b> while the A-tailing treatment adds an A to the 3’ end of the sheared DNA. DNA molecules with a length of 1 kb are selected by loading on the 6% TBE PAGE gel. In the next step, the DNA molecules are circularized with T-tailed 30 bp long synthetic oligonucleotides (T30), which contains two outward-facing MmeI recognition sites, and the resulting circularized DNA undergoes rolling circle replication. The amplified circularized DNA molecules are then digested with MmeI (type IIs restriction endonuclease) which will cuts {{at a distance from}} its recognition site, releasing the T30 fragment flanked by 17-18 bp tags (≈70 bp in length). The paired-tag molecules need to be end-repaired prior to the ligation of ePCR (emulsion PCR) primer oligonucleotides (FDV2 and RDV2) to their both ends. The resulting 135 bp library molecules are size-selected and nick translated. Lastly, amplify the 135 bp paired end-tag library molecules with PCR {{to increase the amount of}} library material and eliminate extraneous ligation products in a single step. The resulted DNA template consists of a 44 bp FDV sequence, a 17-18 bp proximal tag, the T30 sequence, a 17-18 bp distal tag, and a 25 bp RDV sequence.|$|E

In addition, the previously established activity of T 4 DNA ligase on blunt-ended molecules is greatly increased in {{the presence}} of high concentrations of macromolecules.

One N-terminal and two C-terminal deletion mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli as histidine- tagged proteins. An additional mutant bore a substitution of Lys 159 in the active site that abolished ATP binding.

The enzyme establishes two different complexes with DNA: (i) a transient complex (T. complex) involving the adenylated enzyme; (ii) a stable complex (S. complex) requiring the deadenylated T 4 DNA ligase.

The rate of ligation depends on the length and stability of the mispaired intermediate (G/G, T/T greater than A/A, C/C).

Bisintercalators, including natural {{products such as}} echinomycin and rationally designed molecules such as the bis- 9 -aminoacridine- 4 -carboxamides, are key examples. There is little knowledge of the propensity of these molecules to crosslink duplex DNA. Here we use single molecule force spectroscopy to assay the crosslinking capabilities of bisintercalators. We show that bis- 9 -aminoacridine- 4 -carboxamides with both rigid and flexible linkers are able to crosslink duplex strands of DNA, and estimate the equilibrium free energy of a 9 -aminoacridine- 4 -carboxamide bisintercalator from DNA at 5. 03 kJ mol− 1.

Determination of nucleotide sequence at the junction between the two LTRs from a class 1 insert suggested that circularization occurred by <b>blunt-end</b> <b>ligation</b> of an 8. 8 -kb linear DNA.

In contrast, only 25 % of the cells of rad 5 - 7 and rad 5 Delta mutants perform correct gap repair. As has been proven by sequencing of the junction sites, the remaining cells recircularise the gapped plasmids by joining of the non-compatible, non-homologous ends. Thus, regarding the repair of DNA double-strand breaks, the rad 5 mutants behave like mammalian cells rather than budding yeast.

To address this question, we used the polymerase chain reaction to construct and analyze a library of 51 small-subunit (16 S) rRNA genes cloned from Sargasso Sea bacterioplankton genomic DNA. Oligonucleotides complementary to conserved regions in the 16 S rDNAs of eubacteria were used to direct the synthesis of polymerase chain reaction products, which were then cloned by <b>blunt-end</b> <b>ligation</b> into the phagemid vector pBluescript. Restriction fragment length polymorphisms and hybridizations to oligonucleotide probes for the SAR 11 and marine Synechococcus phylogenetic groups indicated the presence of at least seven classes of genes.

30|$|Thymine and adenine (TA) cloning vectors {{have been}} one of the most {{commonly}} used plasmids for achieving high cloning efficiency (Holton and Graham 1991; Ito et al. 2000). However, they require adenine nucleotides to be added at the insert’s 5 ′ and 3 ′ ends, this can be time-consuming when ligating the blunt ends of fragments amplified by proof-reading DNA polymerases (<b>blunt-end</b> <b>ligation</b> is regarded as low-efficient, involving the risk of plasmid re-circularisation). The former increases the consumption of time and money for laboratories constantly working on cloning (Guo and Bi 2002). Cloning recombinant bacteria by means of ccdB (coupled cell division B gene) gene selection offers an advantage over E. coli clones selected via the LacZ system via blue/white screening (Bernard 1996; Messing et al. 1977). The ccdB gene product obstructs DNA gyrase activity, inducing GyrA-DNA complex formation promoting plasmid and chromosomal DNA rupture. This causes cell non-viability, due to death in most E. coli strains (Bernard 1996). ccdB activity can be inhibited in two ways: expression of the ccdA gene-encoded product or ccdB sequence disruption through DNA fragment insertion into its already-embedded multiple cloning site (Maki et al. 1992). Regarding the latter, transformants only bear the recombinant plasmid (the disrupted ccdB sequence will thus survive and grow). This saves a lot of time when choosing candidates for colony PCR screening.|$|E

The {{growth of}} numerous transformed TOP 10 E. coli cells per µg DNA was seen, suggesting that ccdB inactivation by small insertions was highly efficient. The few colonies having unusual morphology observed in LB-amp plates (as described in other work) {{might have been}} related to the high amounts of transformant product being plated. This could have promoted local ampicillin degradation favouring satellite colony growth (Bernard 1995); less than 80  μL transformation product per Petri plate has been recommended to overcome such inconvenience. Sequencing PCR-negative transformed clones gave low-sized fragment (< 60  bp) incorporation into the vector. DNA contamination might thus have been a cause for the interruption of ccdB toxic activity regarding these colonies, as reported previously (Weibel et al. 2013), hence reducing recombinant colony yield for the fragment being studied. Likewise, recovering clones without the insert’s sequence coincides with numerous cases where plasmid vectors, having positive selection systems, have presented several recombinant clones lacking the insert (Ma et al. 2014; Pierce et al. 1992). Some selected clones lacking the insert can often be found from impurities produced by restriction endonucleases or unspecific amplification products further ligated into the vector.

Oligonucleotides complementary to conserved regions in the 16 S rRNA-encoding DNA (rDNA) of bacteria were used to direct the synthesis of PCR products, which were then subcloned by <b>blunt-end</b> <b>ligation</b> into phagemid vector pBluescript II. Restriction fragment length polymorphism patterns, created by using tandem tetrameric restriction endonucleases, revealed the presence of 12 groups of 16 S rRNA genes representing discrete operational taxonomic units (OTUs).

The resulting plasmid was transferred from Escherichia coli via a restriction-negative Salmonella typhimurium strain into an aromatic-compound-dependent, flagellin-negative live-vaccine strain of Salmonella dublin to produce strain SL 7127, which was motile. Expression of the inserted epitope in flagellin and its exposure at the flagellar filament surface were shown by immunoblotting and by the reaction of flagellate bacteria (immobilization, immunogold labeling) with antibody raised by injection of the corresponding synthetic peptide, S-M 5 (1 - 15).

In this study we explored the feasibility and limitations of a modified ligase chain reaction (Gap-LCR) in detection and discrimination of DNAs that differ by a single base. LCR is a DNA amplification technology based on the ligation of two pairs of synthetic oligonucleotides which hybridize at adjacent positions to complementary strands of a target DNA. Multiple rounds of denaturation, annealing and ligation with a thermostable ligase result in the exponential amplification of the target DNA. A modification of LCR, Gap-LCR was developed to reduce the background generated by target-independent, <b>blunt-end</b> <b>ligation.</b> In Gap-LCR, DNA polymerase fills in a gap between annealed probes which are subsequently joined by DNA ligase. We have designed synthetic DNA targets with single base pair differences and analyzed them in a system where three common probes plus an allele-specific probe were used. A single base mismatch either at the ultimate 3 ' end or penultimate 3 ' end of the allele specific probe was sufficient for discrimination, though better discrimination was obtained with a mismatch at the penultimate 3 ' position. Comparison of Gap-LCR to allele-specific PCR (ASPCR) suggested that Gap-LCR has the advantage of having the additive effect of polymerase and ligase on specificity. As a model system, Gap-LCR was tested on a mutation in the reverse transcriptase gene of HIV, specifically, one of the mutations that confers AZT resistance.

Broken chromosomes were repaired by deletions that were highly variable in size, all of which removed more sequences than was required either to prevent subsequent HO cleavage or to eliminate a functional centromere, respectively. The junction of the deletions frequently occurred where complementary strands from the flanking DNA could anneal to form 1 to 5 bp, although 12 % (4 of 34) of the events appear to have occurred by <b>blunt-end</b> <b>ligation.</b> These types of deletions {{are very similar to}} the junctions observed in the repair of DSBs by mammalian cells (D. B. Roth and J. H. Wilson, Mol. Cell. Biol. 6 : 4295 - 4304, 1986). When a high level of HO endonuclease, expressed in all phases of the cell cycle, was used to create DSBs, we also recovered a large class of very small (2 - or 3 -bp) insertions in the HO cleavage site. These insertions appear to represent still another mechanism of DSB repair, apparently by annealing and filling in the overhanging 3 ' ends of the cleavage site. These types of events have also been well documented for vertebrate cells...|$|E

We have produced transgenic mice expressing human neutrophil elastase (HNE) in their lungs {{in order to}} better understand the elastase-antielastase theory and produce an animal model for emphysema, as well as mice expressing the human Krev-l in order to test its activity in vivo. Disruption of the protease anti-protease balance in the lung is believed to {{play a key role in}} the aetiology of emphysema. In an attempt to produce an animal model for emphysema, we have generated transgenic mice by microinjection of HNE genomic DNA under the control of the rabbit uteroglobin (UG) promoter. Eight independent transgenic lines were generated. Analysis of total RNA by Northern hybridisation showed strong expression of HNE mRNA in transgenic lung of 6 out of 8 lines, and weak expression in a seventh line. Immuno histochemistry using specific anti-HNE antibodies indicated the presence of HNE protein in the bronchial epithelium. The protein was detected immunologically in bronchoalveolar lavages, indicating that HNE protein was secreted. On Western blotting of lavage fluid, a biotinylated anti-HNE antibody detected two bands of approximately 30, 000 and 80, 000 Mr corresponding to free and complexed HNE, respectively. No HNE activity was detected in the bronchoalveolar lavages of transgenic mice. Examination of mouse lung sections occasionally revealed mild signs of emphysema but there was no difference in incidence of emphysema between transgenic and wild-type groups. Mice of the A/J strain are useful models of lung cancer because they develop tumours spontaneously or after treatment with ethyl carbamate. These tumours are thought to arise either from the Clara cells (papillary tumours) or from the alveolar type 2 cells (alveolar tumours), and, like many human lung adenocarcinomas, involve K-ras activation. Transformation with K-ras can be reversed by co-expression of the Krev-l gene in tissue culture. To test the tumour suppressor activity of Krev-l in vivo we have produced transgenic A/J mice expressing Krev-l in their lungs under the control of the rabbit uteroglobin promoter. Sixty-six mice (35 transgenic and 31 non-transgenic) from 3 lines were given ethyl carbamate and the numbers of lung tumours were compared between transgenic and non-transgenic animals. The mean number of ethyl carbamate-induced lung tumours was 21. 7 ± 1. 3 (s. d.) in transgenic mice and 26. 9 ± 1. 6 in non-transgenic littermates (p< 0. 01). These data demonstrate the activity of Krev- 1 in vivo. In a second experiment, 8 mice (3 transgenic and 5 non-transgenic) were given ethyl carbamate and the resulting tumours were dissected and examined microscopically. The numbers of alveolar tumours were 4. 7 per transgenic mouse and 3. 8 per non-transgenic mouse, whereas the numbers of papillary tumours were 5. 3 per transgenic mouse and 6. 8 per nontransgenic mouse. As UG-driven trans genes are expressed in Clara cells, this reduction in the percentage of papillary tumours in transgenic mice is consistent with the Clara cell origin of at least some of the papillary tumours. During the course of this work, a plasmid with a protruding G at each end that can be used as a positive control for end-filling prior to <b>blunt-end</b> <b>ligation</b> was developed. We also developed a simple method for efficient <b>blunt-end</b> <b>ligation.</b> We have shown that construction of recombinant plasmids can be done efficiently if ligation is first carried out at high DNA concentration, to favour intermolecular events, then the DNA is diluted to low concentration to favour intramolecular events. Using this method, the number of recombinant plasmids obtained was about 10 times higher than in the control ligation with the generally recommended DNA concentration...|$|E
40|$|Genomic clones of the {{autonomous}} parvovirus bovine parvovirus (BPV) were constructed by <b>blunt-end</b> <b>ligation</b> of reannealed virion plus and minus DNA strands into the plasmid pUC 8. These clones were stable during propagation in Escherichia coli JM 107. All clones tested {{were found to}} be infectious by the criteria of plaque titer and progressive cytopathic effect after transfection into bovine fetal lung cells. Sequencing of the recombinant plasmids demonstrated that all of the BPV inserts had left-end (3 ') -terminal deletions of up to 34 bases. DNA isolated from progeny virions arising from transfected infectious clones was found to be indistinguishable from wild-type DNA by restriction enzyme analysis. Defective genomes could also be detected in the progeny DNA even though the infection was initiated with homogenous, cloned DNA. Full-length genomic clones with 3 ' flip and 3 ' flop conformations were constructed and were found to have equal infectivity. Analysis of low-molecular-weight DNA isolated from lysates of cells transfected with these clones demonstrated that rescue and replication of BPV DNA could be detected 3 to 8 days after transfection. Expression of capsid proteins from transfected genomes was demonstrated by hemagglutination, indirect immunofluorescence, and immunoprecipitation of [35 S]methionine-labeled cell lysates. Use of appropriate antiserum for immunoprecipitation showed the synthesis of BPV capsid and noncapsid proteins after transfection. Independently, a series of genomic clones with increasingly larger 3 '-terminal deletions was prepared from separately subcloned 3 '-terminal fragments. Transfection of these clones into bovine fetal lung cells revealed that deletions of up to 34 bases at the 3 ' end lowered but did not abolish infectivity, while deletions of greater than 52 bases were lethal. End-label analysis showed that the 34 -base deletion was repaired to wild-type length in the progeny virus...|$|E
40|$|The {{integration}} of exogenous DNA into the genome of a mammalian cell would be expected'-despite l m-ited {{knowledge of the}} recombinatorial mechanisms-to have an intrinsic potential for generating change in the donor or host DNA sequences. The changes might entail tandem duplications, deletions, other rearrange-ments, such as inversions or translocations, or even base substitutions. When the recipient cell is the fertilized egg rather than a somatic ell, the consequences of uch a muta-tion may be far-reaching, especially if the change is deleterious. Not only can the new genotype be repli-cated and found in all somatic ells of the animal de-rived from that egg; it can be transmitted {{to the next generation}} through the germ cells. A mutation initially present in the heterozygous state could appear in the homozygous form of a percentage of progeny de-scended from a pair of heterozygotes. Thus, a trans-genic individual derived from an egg with integrated exogenous (proviral or recombinant) DNA would have at risk any cell type(s) in which the relevant genetic re-gion is ordinarily expressed, if the mutation is a domi-nant or codominant one, and could generate handi-capped or inviable homozygotes, if the mutation is recessive. There is abundant evidence that DNA that is trans-fected or injected, with or without viral sequences, into cultured mammalian somatic ells undergoes mutation at a high frequency, up to approximately 1 ~ per gene (Lebkowski et al. 1984; Miller et al. 1984; Mounts and Kelly 1984). The mutations are chiefly base substitu-tions and deletions in the donor DNA, but they also include insertions from the host genome. Cotrans-fected DNA species can themselves become covalently linked by homologous recombination or by <b>blunt-end</b> <b>ligation,</b> and may experience rearrangement (Wiglet e...|$|E
40|$|By use of rate-zonal centrifugation, {{followed}} by either one- or two-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis, {{the forms of}} intracellular bacteriophage T 7 DNA produced by replication, recombination, and packaging have been analyzed. Previous studies had shown {{that at least some}} intracellular DNA with sedimentation coefficients between 32 S (the S value of mature T 7 DNA) and 100 S is concatemeric, i. e., linear and longer than mature T 7 DNA. The analysis presented here confirmed that most of this DNA is linear, but also revealed a significant amount of circular DNA. The data suggest that these circles are produced during DNA packaging. It is proposed that circles are produced after a capsid has bound two sequential genomes in a concatemer. The size distribution of the linear, concatemeric DNA had peaks at the positions of dimeric and trimeric concatemers. Restriction endonuclease analysis revealed that most of the mature T 7 DNA subunits of concatemers were joined left end to right end. However, these data also suggest that a comparatively small amount of left-end to left-end joining occurs, possibly by <b>blunt-end</b> <b>ligation.</b> A replicating form of T 7 DNA that had an S value greater than 100 (100 S+ DNA) was also found to contain concatemers. However, some of the 100 S+ DNA, probably the most branched component, remained associated with the origin after agarose gel electrophoresis. It has been found that T 7 protein 19, known to be required for DNA packaging, was also required to prevent loss, probably by nucleolytic degradation, of the right end of all forms of intracellular T 7 DNA. T 7 gene 3 endonuclease, whose activity is required for both recombination of T 7 DNA and degradation of host DNA, was required for the formation of the 32 S to 100 S molecules that behaved as concatemers during gel electrophoresis. In the absence of gene 3 endonuclease, the primary accumulation product was origin-associated 100 S+ DNA with properties that suggest the accumulation of branches, primarily at the left end of mature DNA subunits within the 100 S+ DNA...|$|E
40|$|The {{three-dimensional}} folding of chromosomes compartmentalizes {{the genome}} and and can bring distant functional elements, such as promoters and enhancers, into close spatial proximity (2 - 6). Deciphering {{the relationship between}} chromosome organization and genome activity will aid in understanding genomic processes, like transcription and replication. However, {{little is known about}} how chromosomes fold. Microscopy is unable to distinguish large numbers of loci simultaneously or at high resolution. To date, the detection of chromosomal interactions using chromosome conformation capture (3 C) and its subsequent adaptations required the choice of a set of target loci, making genome-wide studies impossible (7 - 10). We developed Hi-C, an extension of 3 C that is capable of identifying long range interactions in an unbiased, genome-wide fashion. In Hi-C, cells are fixed with formaldehyde, causing interacting loci to be bound to one another by means of covalent DNA-protein cross-links.

Direct analysis of the resulting contact matrix reveals numerous features of genomic organization, such as the presence of chromosome territories and the preferential association of small gene-rich chromosomes. Correlation analysis can be applied to the contact matrix, demonstrating that the human genome is segregated into two compartments: a less densely packed compartment containing open, accessible, and active chromatin and a more dense compartment containing closed, inaccessible, and inactive chromatin regions.
