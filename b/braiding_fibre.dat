Application of grid reinforcement in concrete was reported to increase the pull out load (Seo & Djamaluddin, 2006). This could be due to large surface area of the grid that is exposed to concrete bonding in comparison with adhesive bonding on ropes. Therefore, grid carbon fibre reinforcement may be used to reinforce concrete slabs, wall panels and beams...|$|R

40|$|Fire {{has been}} always {{a major concern}} for {{designers}} of steel and concrete structures. Designing fire-resistant structural elements {{is not an easy}} task due to several limitations such as the lack of fire-resistant construction materials. Concrete reinforcement cover and external insulation are the most commonly adopted systems to protect concrete and steel from overheating, while spalling of concrete is minimised by using HPFRC instead of standard concrete. Although these methodologies work very well for low rise concrete structures, {{this is not the case}} for high-rise and inaccessible buildings where fire loading is much longer. Fire can permanently damage structures that cost a lot of money. This is unsafe and can lead to loss of life. In this research, the author proposes a new type of main reinforcement for concrete structures which can provide better fire-resistance than steel or FRP re-bars. This consists of continuous <b>braided</b> <b>fibre</b> rope, generally made from fire-resistant materials such as carbon or glass fibre. These fibres have excellent tensile strengths, sometimes in excess of ten times greater than steel. In addition to fire-resistance, these ropes can produce lighter and corrosive resistant structures. Avoiding the use of expensive resin binders, fibres are easily bound together using braiding techniques, ensuring that tensile stress is evenly distributed throughout the reinforcement. In order to consider braided ropes as a form of reinforcement it is first necessary to establish the mechanical performance at room temperature and investigate the pull-out resistance for both unribbed and ribbed ropes. Ribbing of ropes was achieved by braiding the rope over a series of glass beads. Adhesion between the rope and concrete was drastically improved due to ribbing, and further improved by pre-stressing ropes and reducing the slacked fibres. Two types of material have been considered for the ropes: carbon and aramid. An implicit finite element approach is proposed to model <b>braided</b> <b>fibres</b> using Total Lagrangian formulation, based on the theory of small strains and large rotations. Modelling tows and strands as elastic transversely isotropic materials was a good assumption when stiff and brittle fibres such as carbon and glass fibres are considered. The rope-to-concrete and strand-to-strand bond interaction/adhesion was numerically simulated using newly proposed hierarchical higher order interface elements. Elastic and linear damage cohesive models were used effectively to simulate non-penetrative 'free' sliding interaction between strands, and the adhesion between ropes and concrete respectively. Numerical simulation showed similar de-bonding features when compared with experimental pull-out results of braided ribbed rope reinforced concrete...|$|R

However, serious problems would arise if this energy absorption ability were compromised by brittle crack propagation of the cross-sectional central part. In a previous study, the use of flexible resin with lower stiffness and higher toughness than the resin generally used was suggested as a method to restrain brittle crack propagation. In this study, hybrid <b>braided</b> <b>fibre</b> reinforced plastic (FRP) tubes were fabri-cated according to the previous study involving FRP rods. In this case, the flexible resin was applied to middle-end-fibre. The energy absorption characteristics and crushing mechanisms based on precise cross-sectional observation of the crush zone of the braided FRP tubes {{with or without the}} presence of flexible resin in middle-end-fibre were investigated. It was found that braided FRP tubes with or without the presence of flexible resin in middle-end-fibre were investigated. It was found that braided FRP tube with a 308 braiding angle, together with the presence of flexible resins, shows significant improvement in terms of energy absorption ability. The added flexibility of the tubes owing to the addition of flexible resin in turn causes short cracks, more fibre breakage, and consequently enhanced energy absorption properties...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of a one-piece braided model catheter with the same rigidities as the combined medical catheter-guidewire system presently employed during cardiovascular catheterization procedures is the principal goal of this research. This {{will result in a}} significant reduction in the time required to insert a cardiovascular catheter. This is also the first and fundamental step in the {{development of}} optimal rigidity cardiovascular catheters. To begin, the axial, torsional and flexural rigidities of existing medical catheters were reviewed and measured. A model to predict the longitudinal tensile and in-plane shear moduli of 2 D braided structures, needed for the calculations of the axial, torsional and flexural rigidities of braided tubes, was developed. The sensitivity of the model to key constituent and laminar properties was analysed. It was concluded that accurate values of Efl 1, E m and Gm are required for the micromechanical model; the model is not sensitive to the remaining elastic constants (nuf 12, nu f 23, Gfl 2, G 23). Oversized <b>braided</b> (Kevlar 49 <b>fibre</b> and thermoset matrix) engineering model composite structures [...] -or model catheters [...] -have been used to verify the model. These model catheters have been produced on an existing braiding machine. Kevlar 49 fibre and epoxy resin have been used primarily because the laminar mechanical properties have been measured in a previous experimental study by Flanagan and Munro [72]. There was good agreement (approximately 6 %) between the predicted and measured values of the longitudinal elastic modulus of braided tubes which provided confidence in the model. Shear modulus predictions and the range of experimental results also showed reasonable agreement. The results also show that micromechanical models in which accurate values for important elastic constants (Ef 11, Em and G m) are used can accurately predict the experimental results. The preceding experimental work was carried out for full coverage rigid thermoset matrix <b>braided</b> <b>fibre</b> composites. Actual medical catheters require flexible matrix and an open fibre mesh rather than full fibre coverage; therefore, it was necessary to select the appropriate matrix and reinforcement for an actual medical catheter. The proposed CLPT model was used to select the appropriate fibre and resin to obtain rigidities {{similar to those of the}} existing medical catheter-guidewire systems. Laminar elastic constants were estimated using micromechanical models. The proposed CLPT model reasonably predicted the longitudinal elastic and shear moduli of model catheters produced with one of the selected elastomeric resins. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R
40|$|Vibration {{reducing}} {{performance of}} many mechanical systems, decreasing {{the quality of}} manufactured products, producing noise, generating fatigue in mechanical components, and producing an uncomfortable environment for human bodies. Vibration control is categorized as: active, passive, or semi-active, based on the power consumption of the control system and feedback or feed forward based on whether sensing is used to control vibration. Semi-active vibration control is the most attractive method; one method of semi-active vibration control could be designed by using smart fluid. Smart fluids are able to modify their effective viscosity {{in response to an}} external stimulus such as a magnetic field. This unique characteristic can be utilised to build semi-active dampers {{for a wide variety of}} vibration control systems. Previous work has studied the application of smart fluids in semi-active dampers, where the kinetic energy of a vibrating structure can be dissipated in a controllable fashion. A McKibben actuator is a device that consists of a rubber tube surrounded by <b>braided</b> <b>fibre</b> material. It has different advantages over a piston/cylinder actuator such as: a high power to weight ratio, low weight and less cost.

The research presented here aims to increase the fundamental knowledge on a crucial part of the Resin Transfer Moulding (RTM) production technology: the impregnation behaviour of textile reinforcements. In RTM, a near-net-shaped, dry, textile preform is manufactured and placed in a closely fitting mould. Resin is subsequently injected, typically at a pressure varying between 2 and 10 bars relative to the atmospheric pressure.

CF/PEEK bone plates were aged in a simulated body environment for up to 12 weeks and then mechanically tested in 3 and 4 -point bending tests. Sample mass increased by around 0. 3 wt. %, yet bending stiffness and strength remained unchanged. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) showed no changes in failure modes with age. Braided CF/PEEK shows an excellent resistance to fatigue failure even after prolonged ageing, easily surpassing the fatigue life of commonly used stainless steel alloys such as 316 L. In addition, CF/PEEK had half the stiffness of steel for the same static strength, which would reduce stress shielding.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{pre-existing}} {{damage on the}} mode of failure and energy absorption characteristics of Non-Crimp Fabric (NCF) and biaxially braided tubular sections under axial loading were considered. Loading rate effects were incorporated by testing at quasi-static rates and impact rates up to 7 ms- 1 and the pre-existing damage was simulated through stress concentrations and out-of-plane impact damage. Circular and square geometries were tested, {{and a range of}} NCF and <b>braided</b> <b>fibre</b> architectures were investigated. A number of failure modes were exhibited. NCF tubes were seen to splay at static and impact rates; at impact rates a reduction in Specific Energy Absorption (SEA) was recorded. Braided tubes failed in a combination of buckling and splaying at static rates. Under dynamic conditions all braided samples splayed and where a change in failure mode was seen, SEA was increased. Both NCF and biaxially braided tubes have been shown to offer a much lower SEA than Continuous Filament Random Mat (CoFRM) samples. A threshold size of damage was observed, where, typically, below that threshold the SEA was unaffected by the damage, and above that size the tube would fail globally. The NCF tubes exhibited an improved damage tolerance over CoFRM and braided samples. The braided tubes showed a poor damage tolerance at quasi-static rates although results suggest that the architectures with high axial fibre content will have a higher damage tolerance. It has been shown that modelling damaged areas of tubes as a cut-out is a conservative approach to finding failure levels. Peak stress was seen to be the dominant factor in determining loading at global failure as samples could fail even though the crushing stress is less than the failure stress. Previous work upon Interlaminar Shear Strength (ILSS) and SEA has been investigated and shown to overestimate energy absorption for tubular specimens and found to apply only to samples that fail by progressive crush or fragmentation; for those that do fail in this mode a link between ILSS and SEA has been stated. A technique for determining SEA and for predicting the effect of a SCF on failure mode of composite tubes has been proposed using UCS (Ultimate Compressive Strength) data and SCF (Stress Concentration Factor) data.

Experimental and theoretical analysis of the beams have been revealed that due to bending, the beams initially deflect in a linear manner like the Euler-Bernoulli beam model predicts. Once the stress in the axial fibres becomes zero, wrinkling occurs resulting in a significant loss of bending stiffness. The two beams that were tested were optimised for minimum deflection at a constant volume of fibres. The stiffest design has the maximum possible amount of fibres in parallel to the beam.

Therefore, an overall design process is developed within the present paper. It is based on a correlated conduction of sub-design processes for the braided preform, RTM-injection, mandrel plus mould and manufacturing. For each sub-process both, individual tasks and reasonable methods to accomplish them are presented. The information flow within the design process is specified and interdependences are illustrated.

Nowadays, a new challenging perspective is being given to these materials by the inclusion of non-metallic conductive components. This emerging technology will lead to multifunctional composites with possible applications in structural health monitoring and traffic monitoring. The aim is to avoid corrosion problems from metallic components, {{as well as to}} eliminate the need of expensive equipments used for the health monitoring of large infrastructures. In the present research, the strain-sensing capability of a core-reinforced hybrid carbon fibre/glass <b>fibre</b> <b>braided</b> composite has been investigated in order to develop continuous monitoring system. The characterization of sensing behaviour was performed {{with the help of an}} instrumental set-up capable of measuring the change in electrical resistance with mechanical stresses applied to the samples. The effect of core composition (carbon fibre/glass fibre weight ratio) on the strain sensitivity of the braided composites has been studied in order to find out the optimum composition for best sensing capability. Among the three compositions studied (23 / 77, 47 / 53 and 100 / 0), composites with lowest amount of carbon fibre showed the best strain sensitivity with gauge factors up to 23. 4 at very low flexural strain (0. 55 %).

50|$|The {{second major}} way of {{manufacturing}} <b>fibre</b> preforms is <b>Braiding.</b> Braiding is {{suited to the}} manufacture of narrow width flat or tubular fabric and is not as capable as weaving {{in the production of}} large volumes of wide fabrics. Braiding is done over top of mandrels that vary in cross-sectional shape or dimension along their length. Braiding is limited to objects about a brick in size. Unlike standard weaving, braiding can produce fabric that contains fibres at 45-degree angles to one another. <b>Braiding</b> three-dimensional <b>fibres</b> can be done using four step, two-step or Multilayer Interlock Braiding.Four step or row and column braiding utilizes a flat bed containing rows and columns of yarn carriers that form the shape of the desired preform. Additional carriers are added to the outside of the array, the precise location and quantity of which depends upon the exact preform shape and structure required. There are four separate sequences of row and column motion, which act to interlock the yarns and produce the braided preform. The yarns are mechanically forced into the structure between each step to consolidate the structure in a similar process to the use of a reed in weaving. Two-step braiding is unlike the four-step process because the two-step includes a large number of yarns fixed in the axial direction and a fewer number of braiding yarns. The process consists of two steps in which the braiding carriers move completely through the structure between the axial carriers. This relatively simple sequence of motions is capable of forming preforms of essentially any shape, including circular and hollow shapes. Unlike the four-step process, the two-step process does not require mechanical compaction the motions involved in the process allows the braid to be pulled tight by yarn tension alone. The last type of braiding is multi-layer interlocking braiding that consists of a number of standard circular braiders being joined together to form a cylindrical braiding frame. This frame has a number of parallel braiding tracks around the circumference of the cylinder but the mechanism allows the transfer of yarn carriers between adjacent tracks forming a multilayer braided fabric with yarns interlocking to adjacent layers. The multilayer interlock braid differs from both the four step and two-step braids in that the interlocking yarns are primarily in the plane of the structure and thus do not significantly reduce the in-plane properties of the preform. The four-step and two-step processes produce a greater degree of interlinking as the braiding yarns travel through the thickness of the preform, but therefore contribute less to the in-plane performance of the preform. A disadvantage of the multilayer interlock equipment is that due to the conventional sinusoidal movement of the yarn carriers to form the preform, the equipment is not able to have the density of yarn carriers that is possible with the two step and four step machines.|$|R
