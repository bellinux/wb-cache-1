5|$|He {{was dressed}} in a strange way. A šajkača was pulled to the front of his head and almost {{completely}} covered his forehead. His eyebrows were hardly visible. Under its weight, the ears seemed to have collapsed. He wore a kind of long, black coat, covered in mud and held in place by a string. He used another piece of string for a belt, and from it hung a pot for boiling water, a tea strainer, a canteen, and other useful things. He walked slightly <b>bent</b> <b>forward,</b> followed everywhere by the noise of the things clashing at his waist.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} begins with Gaga, {{dressed in black}} clothing, sunglasses, bloody feet, and {{seemingly}} bionic features, walking through a field in Nebraska; having returned on foot after years of absence. Gaga goes to buy ice cream from an ice cream truck, but she suddenly drops it as a toothless man with a doll in his hand grins at her. She begins to have flashbacks to an earlier time spent in Nebraska as scenes of Gaga having a wedding, being tortured by a man inside a barn, and being inside a water tank appear in quick succession. The song starts playing as the camera zooms slowly towards Gaga, who is standing <b>bent</b> <b>forward</b> as she begins singing. The video continually switches to scenes where Gaga, with little make up, a simple gray-colored hair style, and a white dress, plays a piano {{in the middle of}} a cornfield, while her male alter ego, Jo Calderone, sits on top of the piano, smoking and drinking a beer. As Calderone pulls up his sleeves, present day Gaga is still walking through the desert.|$|E

25|$|Saint Joseph, also {{wearing white}} robes, {{stood on the}} Virgin's right hand. His head was <b>bent</b> <b>forward</b> from the {{shoulders}} towards the Blessed Virgin. Saint John the Evangelist stood {{to the left of}} the Blessed Virgin. He was dressed in a long robe and wore a mitre. He was partly turned away from the other figures. He appeared to be preaching and he held open a large book in his left hand. To the left of St. John was an altar with a lamb on it with a cross standing on the altar behind the lamb.|$|E
500|$|... 1873: Andrew Smith first {{utilized}} the term [...] "caisson disease" [...] describing 110 cases of decompression sickness as the physician in charge during {{construction of the}} Brooklyn Bridge. The project employed 600 compressed air workers. Recompression treatment was not used. The project chief engineer Washington Roebling suffered from caisson disease, and endured the after-effects of the disease {{for the rest of}} his life. During this project, decompression sickness became known as [...] "The Grecian Bends" [...] or simply [...] "the bends" [...] because afflicted individuals characteristically <b>bent</b> <b>forward</b> at the hips: this is possibly reminiscent of a then popular women's fashion and dance maneuver known as the Grecian Bend.|$|E
500|$|His {{coaching}} brought immediate improvement. In 1897 and 1898, the Carlisle {{teams had}} 6–4 records. In 1899 (Warner's first year), Carlisle won nine and lost two games—to the country's two best teams: Harvard and Princeton. That year saw Carlisle's first major victory, {{against one of}} the [...] "Big Four" [...] teams, beating Penn 16–5. At the end of the season, the school played Columbia at the Polo Grounds in New York City, a premier sports venue at the time, defeating them 42–0. The Columbia game {{was the first time that}} a crouching start, a form of what is now known as a three point stance, was used by the running backs. Before Warner's innovation, the stance for a back before the ball was snapped was <b>bent</b> <b>forward</b> with his feet well apart and his hands on his knees. Warner realized that if his players took a stance similar to the one taken by sprinters, the legs would be bent, the back leaning forward, with one hand on the ground and the other arm cocked back to the thigh/hip region. Like with sprinters, this similar stance maximized the speed of his players. Shortly after, it became the standard football stance for both backs and linemen.|$|E
2500|$|In Walter Scott's Ivanhoe (1820), Cedric the Saxon {{refers to}} this battle and {{describes}} it as [...] "a day of cleaving of shields, when a hundred banners were <b>bent</b> <b>forwards</b> {{over the heads of}} the valiant, and blood flowed round like water, and death was held better than flight." ...|$|R
50|$|It {{was first}} {{described}} by Pieter Boddaert, a Dutch physician and naturalist, in 1785. It {{is placed in}} the genus Redunca and family Bovidae. It gets its name from two Latin words: reduncas (meaning bent backwards and curved, while the horns are <b>bent</b> <b>forwards)</b> and arundo (harundo) (meaning a reed; hence arundinum, pertaining to reeds).|$|R

500|$|Adult Achelousaurus skulls had a rugose, heavily pitted boss on {{the snout}} or nasal region, where many other ceratopsids had a horn. Such a boss {{is often called}} [...] "pachyostotic", i.e. {{consisting}} of thickened bone. But describing it as a thick [...] "boss" [...] can be misleading: in fact it forms a wide depression with a thin bone floor and irregular excavations, though it is less depressed than with Pachyrhinosaurus. The nasal boss covered {{about two-thirds of the}} top surface of the nasal bones. The boss was similar to that seen in the related genus Pachyrhinosaurus, though narrower, shorter, and less high. It covered 27% of the total skull length, was 30% longer than the nostril-eye socket distance and was about twice as long as the eye socket. Its rear edge did not reach the level of the eye socket. The nasal boss extended forward, where it fused onto the nasal and premaxilla bones (of the upper jaw) {{at the front of the}} snout, though the nasal bone itself did not fuse with the premaxilla. The boss of specimen MOR 485 furthermore had an excavation (or cavity) at its front end. The horn core that formed the boss may have developed by either becoming procurved (i.e. <b>bent</b> <b>forward)</b> during growth, like the horn of the related Einiosaurus, until it fused onto the nasal bone; or from a simple, erect horn, which later extended its base forward over the snout region, as in Pachyrhinosaurus. The nasal bone formed the top of a large bony nostril. From the rear edge of that nostril a sharp process stuck out to the front. The snout was – compared to that of Einiosaurus – relatively wide at the level of the rear nostrils. The lacrimal bone, in front of the eye socket, was thickened, mainly on the inner surface while the outer surface was featureless apart from a crater-like excavation.|$|E
2500|$|High conical cap – căciulă țuguiată, moțată – this {{is made of}} four pieces joined {{together}} lengthwise. It can be worn peaked, with top <b>bent</b> <b>forward,</b> back or sideways, or with top sunk inwards, depending on local fashion. It is worn in Moldavia, Muntenia, Oltenia and Banat, originally by the [...] "free men". In Banat Mountains, the cap is sometimes worn with fur inside and a narrow white fur hem at base.|$|E
2500|$|It {{was during}} the Red Terror that the Cheka, hoping to avoid the bloody {{aftermath}} of having half-dead victims writhing on the floor, developed a technique for execution known later by the German words [...] "Nackenschuss" [...] or [...] "Genickschuss", a shot to the nape of the neck, which caused minimal blood loss and instant death. The victim's head was <b>bent</b> <b>forward,</b> and the executioner fired slightly downward at point blank range. This had become the standard method used later by the NKVD to liquidate Joseph Stalin's purge victims and others.|$|E

The flowers are a very attractive crimson colour, borne on 30 cm curved stalks above the foliage.|$|R
2500|$|For centuries, bowling was {{performed}} exactly as in bowls because {{the ball was}} rolled or skimmed along the ground. [...] The bowlers may have used variations in pace but the basic action was essentially the same. [...] There are surviving illustrations from {{the first half of}} the eighteenth century which depict the bowler with one knee <b>bent</b> <b>forward</b> and his bowling hand close to the ground, while the ball trundles (if slow) or skims (if quick) towards a batsman armed with a bat shaped something like a large hockey stick and guarding a two-stump wicket.|$|E

Salama said: I came out and beard some people among the Companions of the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) as saying: Amir's deed has gone waste; he has killed himself. So I came to the Holy Prophet weeping and I said: Messenger of Allah. Amir's deed has gone waste. The Messenger said: Who passed this remark? I said: Some of your Companions. He said: [...] "He who has passed that remark has told a lie, for 'Amir there is a double reward." ...|$|E

A portion of her scanty clothing had been removed to cover the child. What remained on her was composed, partly of skins of animals, partly of coarse cotton cloth. In many places this miserable dress was marked with blood, and her long, flaxen hair bore upon its dishevelled locks the same ominous and repulsive stain.|$|R

2500|$|Buddecke scored his {{and the new}} unit's {{first victory}} on 19 September 1915; a B.E.2c of No 8 Squadron RFC, crewed by pilot Lt WH Nixon and {{observer}} Capt JNS Stott. Opening fire from 200 meters he disabled the observer's machine gun, although Captain Stott then returned fire with a pocket pistol. It was shot {{out of his hands}} at a range of ten meters and Nixon was hit. Buddecke's gun then jammed when its cartridge belt tore in the slipstream. As Buddecke struggled with the jammed gun, Stott clambered atop the shoulders of his dying pilot, set his heels on the pilot's knees to operate the rudder and <b>bent</b> <b>forward</b> to grab the controls. Buddecke cleared his gun and aimed at the British observer's yellow leather coat. The BE.2c crash landed near Saint Quentin. Buddecke drove to the wreck after landing, where the uninjured captive Stott showed him the bullet holes in his coat. Buddecke followed this up with confirmed claims on 23 October (a B.E.2 of No. 13 Squadron RFC, with Capt CH Marks ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1965, Francis Robicsek, {{based at}} Carolinas HealthCare System in Charlotte, North Carolina, {{developed}} the Robicsek procedure. Each time {{the procedure is}} performed, it is individually tailored based on the extent and location of the deformity in the patient. The operation begins with an incision, no more than 4–6 centimeters, to the sternum. The pectoralis major muscles are then detached from the sternum. [...] Using the upper limit of the sternal depression as a guide, the deformed cartilages are removed one-by-one, using sharp and blunt dissection. The lower tip of the sternum is then grabbed with a towel-clip and, using blunt dissection, is freed of tissue connections with the pericardium and the pleura. The sternum is then forcefully <b>bent</b> <b>forward</b> into a corrected position. [...] To keep the sternum elevated, a piece of mesh is placed under the mobilized sternum and sutured under moderate tension bilaterally to the stumps of the ribs. The pectoralis muscles are united {{in front of the}} sternum and the wound is closed. The Robicsek procedure is a single-stage procedure (one surgery only).|$|E
2500|$|In the Katamon quarter, we {{were held}} up by a Jewish Army type jeep placed in a road block and filled with men in Jewish Army uniforms. At the same moment, I saw an armed man coming from this jeep. I took little notice of this because I merely thought it was another checkpoint. However, he put a Tommy gun {{through the open window}} on my side of the car, and fired point blank at Count Bernadotte and Colonel Serot. I also heard shots fired from other points, and there was {{considerable}} confusion... Colonel Serot fell in the seat in back of me, and I saw at once that he was dead. Count Bernadotte <b>bent</b> <b>forward,</b> and I thought {{at the time he was}} trying to get cover. I asked him: 'Are you wounded?' He nodded, and fell back.... When we arrived ... I carried the Count inside and laid him on the bed.... I took off the Count's jacket and tore away his shirt and undervest. I saw that he was wounded around the heart and that there was also a considerable quantity of blood on his clothes about it. When the doctor arrived, I asked if anything could be done, but he replied that it was too late.|$|E
