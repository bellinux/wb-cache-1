500|$|Styracosaurus ( [...] meaning [...] "spiked lizard" [...] {{from the}} Ancient Greek styrax/στύραξ [...] "spike at the <b>butt-end</b> of a spear-shaft" [...] and sauros/ [...] "lizard") was a genus of herbivorous ceratopsian dinosaur from the Cretaceous Period (Campanian stage), about 75.5 to 75million years ago. It had {{four to six}} long horns {{extending}} from its neck frill, a smaller horn on each of its cheeks, and a single horn protruding from its nose, {{which may have been}} up to [...] long and [...] wide. The function or functions of the horns and frills have been debated for many years.|$|E
500|$|Field {{markings}} dictate player positioning {{during a}} face-off. A face-off is how play is {{started at the}} beginning of each quarter and after each goal. During a face-off, there are six players (without considering goalkeepers) in each of the areas defined by the restraining lines. Three midfielders from each team occupy the midfield area, while three attackmen and three of the opposing team's defensemen occupy each offensive area. These players must stay in these areas until possession is earned by a midfielder or the ball crosses either restraining line. Wing areas are marked on the field on the midfield line [...] from each sideline. This line indicates where the two nonface-off midfielders per team lineup during a face-off situation. These players may position themselves on either side of the midfield line. [...] During a face-off, two players lay their sticks horizontally next to the ball, head of the stick inches from the ball and the <b>butt-end</b> pointing down the midfield line. Once the official blows the whistle to start play, the face-off midfielders scrap for the ball to earn possession and the other midfielders advance to play the ball. If possession is won by the face-off player, he may move the ball himself or pass to a teammate.|$|E

40|$|We deduce exact {{solutions}} to the deviation equation {{in the cases of}} both free and spring-connected particles. The solutions show that gravitational waves may displace particles in a two-particle system only if they are in motion with respect to each other or the local space (there is no effect if they are at rest). We therefore propose a new experimental statement for the detection of gravitational waves: use a suspended solid-body detector self-vibrating so that there are relative oscillations of its <b>butt-ends.</b> Or, in another way: use a free-mass detector fitted with suspended, vibrating mirrors. Such systems may have a relative displacement of the <b>butt-ends</b> and a time shift in the <b>butt-ends,</b> produced by a falling gravitational wave. The authors dedicate this paper to the memory of Joseph Weber, who pioneered the detection of gravitational waves. ...|$|R

500|$|NHL President Clarence Campbell was at {{the game}} and was seated near where the {{incident}} occurred. After receiving {{a report from the}} game's officials, Campbell called a news conference and said the injury was not Kennedy's fault. Campbell also publicly rebuked Ivan for his accusation, saying, [...] "That is a pretty serious business and a very vicious charge." [...] It was also argued that since Kennedy was a right-handed shot, the <b>butt-end</b> of his stick was towards the boards and away from Howe. Sportswriter Ted Reeve of the Toronto Telegram quipped, [...] "How would a right-handed stickhandler going down the left boards give anyone a butt end? Unless he wanted to lift the snappers out of someone in the rail seats." [...] Howe was lost from the playoffs, but the incident influenced the momentum of the series. Detroit won the second game of the series 3–1, a violent and fight-filled affair which included a stick-swinging incident between the Leafs' Jimmy Thomson and Detroit's Leo Reise and a fight between Kennedy and Ted Lindsay. After the game, Campbell threatened the players with fines if the violent play continued, and both teams continued to play hockey {{for the remainder of the}} series. However, Detroit was now determined to [...] "win the series for Gordie" [...] and defeated the Leafs in seven strongly-contested games to eliminate them from the playoffs, going on to win the Stanley Cup.|$|E

60|$|The {{first of}} these {{incidents}} brought me in acquaintance with a certain San Francisco character, who had something of a name {{beyond the limits of}} the city, and was known to many lovers of good English. I had discovered a new slum, a place of precarious sandy cliffs, deep sandy cuttings, solitary ancient houses, and the <b>butt-ends</b> of streets. It was already environed. The ranks of the street lamps threaded it unbroken. The city, upon all sides of it, was tightly packed, and growled with traffic. To-day, I do not doubt the very landmarks are all swept away; but it offered then, within narrow limits, a delightful peace, and (in the morning, when I chiefly went there) a seclusion almost rural. On a steep sand-hill in this neighbourhood toppled, on the most insecure foundation, a certain row of houses, each with a bit of garden, and all (I have to presume) inhabited. Thither I used to mount by a crumbling footpath, and in front of the last of the houses would sit down to sketch.|$|R

6000|$|... 139. Be {{that as it}} may, I am {{at present}} glad {{to be able to}} refer to one of these perpetuations, by his strong hand, of such human {{character}} as our faultless British constitution occasionally produces in out-of-the-way corners. It is among his illustrations of the Irish Rebellion, and represents the pillage and destruction of a gentleman's house by the mob. They have made a heap in the drawing-room of the furniture and books, to set first fire to; and are tearing up the floor for its more easily kindled planks, the less busily-disposed meanwhile hacking round in rage, with axes, and smashing what they can with <b>butt-ends</b> of guns. I do not care to follow with words the ghastly truth of the picture into its detail; but the most expressive incident of the whole, and the one immediately to my purpose, is this, that one fellow has sat himself at the piano, on which, hitting down fiercely with his clenched fists, he plays, grinning, such tune as may be so producible, to which melody two of his companions, flourishing knotted sticks, dance, after their manner, {{on the top of the}} instrument.|$|R
60|$|The first {{paroxysm}} {{of grief}} over, young Armstrong rose, and began sadly to wander about the ruins. It {{had been an}} extensive structure, fitted with all the most approved appliances of mechanism which wealth could purchase. These now helped to enhance the wild aspect of the wreck, for iron girders had been twisted {{by the action of}} fire into snake-like convolutions in some places, while, in others, their ends stuck out fantastically from the blackened walls. Beautiful furniture had been smashed up to furnish firewood for the cooking of the meal with which the heroic troops had refreshed themselves before leaving, while a number of broken wine-bottles at the side of a rosewood writing-desk with an empty bottle on the top of it and heaps of stones and pebbles around, suggested the idea that the warriors had mingled light amusement with sterner business. The roofs of most of the buildings had fallen in; the window-frames, where spared by the fire, had been torn out; and a pianoforte, which lay on its back on the grass, showed evidence of having undergone an examination of its internal arrangements, with the aid of the <b>butt-ends</b> of muskets.|$|R
60|$|For {{a moment}} there was a sharp mèlèe; several of the sailors were shot or bayoneted, but the rest, using the <b>butt-ends</b> of their muskets with {{tremendous}} execution, fought their way through their opponents. Jack had shot down two men with his revolver, and having got through, was taking his place {{at the rear of}} the men--the proper place for an officer in retreat?--when he saw Hawtry fall. A Russian ran up to bayonet him as he lay, when Jack, running back, shot him through the head. In a moment he was surrounded, and while in the act of shooting down an assailant in front, he was struck on the back of the head with the butt of a musket, and fell stunned across the body of his friend. When he recovered consciousness, he found that he was being carried along by four Russians. He could hear the boom of cannon and the rattle of musketry, and knew that the defenders on the heights were angrily firing at the retreating party, who had so successfully surprised them. As soon as his bearers perceived that Jack had opened his eyes, they let him drop, hauled him to his feet, and then holding him by his collar, made him run along with them.|$|R
