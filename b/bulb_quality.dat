40|$|Shallot {{requirements}} of nitrogen, {{phosphorus and potassium}} fertilizers were studied under rain-fed and irrigated conditions on heavy clay soils with low to medium organic matter contents in a sub-humid tropical climate of eastern Ethiopia. Influences of varying levels of irrigation water in combination with nitrogen fertilizer were assessed. Impacts of soil moisture stresses at different growth stages of the plant were evaluated in greenhouse and under field conditions. Different types of mulching materials were evaluated for their effect on the shallot crop and some soil characteristics. Parameters of plant growth, yield and <b>bulb</b> <b>quality</b> and storability were assessed in relation to applied treatments. The results showed the significance of soil moisture for shallot production in the sub-tropical climate. All mulching treatments improved shallot yields during the short season. During the main season, however, straw and clear plastic mulches favoured heavy weed infestation and reduced yields. Black plastic mulches increased yield up to three-fold without negative effects {{on the quality of}} bulbs. Soil moisture stresses at all growth stages severely affected shallot yield and quality. Frequent irrigation at 25 % depletion of available moisture throughout the growing season was required to achieve high yields. However, frequent irrigation was also found to reduce the quality and storability of the bulbs. Nitrogen fertilization promoted vegetative growth, delayed bulb development and exposed plants to soil moisture stresses ahead of maturity and, thus, reduced yield of rain-fed shallots. When supplemental irrigation was provided, however, yield increases of about 10 - 15 % from nitrogen fertilization in the range 75 - 150 kg ha - 1 were achieved. The different nitrogen sources caused few and small differences in internal and external <b>bulb</b> <b>quality.</b> On the other hand, there were more storage losses in nitrogen-fertilized shallots. Phosphorus fertilization at rates of 25 or 50 kg ha - 1 increased yield and bulb weight even when soil analysis did not show deficiency. On the other hand, potassium was not found to be a limiting nutrient in the clay soil used in this study. The potential for shallot yield improvements through irrigation and nitrogen fertilization needs consideration of better storage facilities. The advantages gained would otherwise be lost within few weeks after harvest as both conditions may increase storage losses and reduce <b>bulb</b> <b>quality.</b> Assessment of cultivars with better storability would also deserve further assessment...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this review}} is a wide {{description}} {{of the relationships between}} growing conditions and <b>bulb</b> yield and <b>quality</b> of onion (Allium cepa L.), focused particularly on long-day cultivars suitable for storage. Marketable yield decreases according to the reduction of crop length caused by the increase of growth temperature. The nutritive requirements of storage onion are highest during the vegetative growth. The application of humic substances and the inoculation of mycorrhizae may enhance <b>bulb</b> growth and <b>quality,</b> mainly under stress conditions. Onion is a slow-growth, shallowrooted crop with non-shading habitus and therefore its productivity is highly dependent on water availability in the soil, proper fertilization and weed control. The shelf-life of onion bulbs is a genetic trait, improvable by efficient crop and post-harvest management, and adequate conditions of <b>bulb</b> storage. The <b>quality</b> of storage onion bulbs is ascribed to several indicators, such as thiosulfonates, pyruvic acid, soluble solids, sugars, and many other biological compounds.

The obtained results reflected generally that Balady cultivar surpassed than Chinese cultivar in plant height, total yield and shelf-life characters. The higher yield that observed in Balady cultivar was related to the increase cloves number/bulb over than Chinese one. However, Chinese cultivar showed superior performance in bulb weight trait either at harvest or after storage as a result of increasing both cloves weight and diameter more than Balady cultivar.

In order to study if their varieties also suit organic farmers¿ needs we interviewed four Dutch commercial onion breeders on their breeding programme and selection criteria and compared the outcome with a variety profile composed of the priority traits of Dutch organic farmers. Breeders gave priority to the same storage and <b>bulb</b> <b>quality</b> traits that are demanded by organic farmers, because organic onions are exported to conventional supermarkets that apply the same quality standards to organic and conventional onions.

40|$|Although onion skins play an {{important}} role in the life of an onion their development is poorly understood. The skins not only protect the onion bulb from disease and moisture loss but are fundamental to a customer’s perception of <b>bulb</b> <b>quality.</b> This study has increased the understanding of leaf desiccation and the formation of skins. A detailed phenological study across 32 commercial crops (‘Creamgold’) revealed that the scale of the 6 th true leaf was the most common tissue to form the outermost entire skin on the onion bulb. A positive correlation was recorded between bulb diameter and the leaf number (where leaf 1 is the first true leaf) that formed the most-outer skin on the bulb. Skins that are forming but that are not yet completely dry are highly extensible which appears to enable them to withstand the rapid radial expansion of the bulb. Skin tensile strength was positively correlated with skin thickness and skin specific dry weight. Skin specific dry weight was higher in skins that developed from younger leaves, largely due to a higher number of cells in the cross sectional plane. It was posited that conditions that impair early leaf development, and limit the number of cells in the leaf, and therefore the amount of structural tissue in the scale, are responsible for skins that are easily torn and dislodged during handling operations. The importance on the timing of the events may explain the lack of consistency in findings associated with agronomic treatments and the variability in skin disorders between crops...|$|E

A conducting polymer sensor electronic nose (E-nose) was used to classify onion headspace volatiles. Relative changes in the E-nose sensor resistance ratio (%dR/R) were reduced following N and S fertilisation. A 2 D Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of the E-nose data sets accounted for c. 100 % of the variations in onion headspace volatiles in both experiments. For the field experiment, E-nose data set clusters for headspace volatiles for no N-added onions overlapped (D- 2 = 1. 0) irrespective of S treatment. Headspace volatiles of N-fertilised onions for the glasshouse sandy loam also overlapped (D- 2 = 1. 1) irrespective of S treatment as compared with distinct separations among clusters for the clay soil. N fertilisation significantly (P < 0. 01) reduced onion bulb pyruvic acid concentration (flavour) in both experiments. S fertilisation increased pyruvic acid concentration significantly (P < 0. 01) in the glasshouse experiment, especially for the clay soil, but had no effect on pyruvic acid concentration in the field. N and S fertilisation significantly (P < 0. 01) increased lachrymatory potency (pungency), but reduced total soluble solids (TSS) content in the field experiment. In the glasshouse experiment, N and S had no effect on TSS. TSS content was increased on the clay by 1. 2 -fold as compared with the sandy loam. Onion tissue N:water-soluble SO 42 - ratios of between five and eight were associated with greater %dR/R and pyruvic acid concentration values. N did not affect inner bulb tissue microbial load.

40|$|Many flower bulbs have a {{life cycle}} of a year or more, {{flowering}} either in spring or in summer. Nevertheless, year-round production of cut flowers has become common practice in horticulture. To control flowering, which {{is necessary for the}} year-round production of flowers, bulbs are exposed to specific temperature regimes to affect their growth and development. When storage or planting conditions are not properly chosen, physiological disorders in bulb development may occur. Flower bud abortion and aberrant leaves are examples of such physiological disorders. Disorders in the bulbs are usually not visible externally. They become apparent after planting even though they are often induced during storage. The aim {{of this study was to}} gain a better insight in the processes underlying physiological disorders in flower bulbs, induced by improper storage conditions. Changes in the water status are expected to be often involved in the development of the induced aberrations. The water status of stored flower bulbs was therefore assessed using both magnetic resonance imaging (MRI, known from the medical applications) as well as classical water status measurements. It was assessed whether the obtained parameters might serve as ‘early indicators’ of an impaired flower <b>bulb</b> <b>quality</b> and thus as indicators for the internal quality of stored bulbs. This might lead to a tool to detect the presence of disorders at an early stage of development. Such an application could avoid further cost of storage and planting of impaired bulbs and potentially increases the chances to minimize the damage. Furthermore, it would enable optimization of storage conditions of new flower bulb genera more easily. In addition, flower quality can be better guaranteed. The possibilities of MRI to assess non-invasively the internal quality of flower bulbs appear extensive. T 2 -weighted imaging appeared to be a suitable application to visualize morphological changes like the growth of the shoot and the development of daughter bulbs. Aberrant developments of the floral parts in tulip bulbs after storage at high temperatures and the presence of aborted buds in Hippeastrum (amaryllis) bulbs could well be observed. Water concentration and T 1 and T 2 relaxation times were successfully used to assess the water status in the bulbs and to monitor water status related disorders like bud abortion in tulips after long-term cold and dry storage and freezing injury and water-soaking in lily bulbs. Thus, MRI has a great potential for the evaluation of the internal quality of flower bulbs and horticultural products in general. However, currently the technique is still too expensive for routine, high-throughput applications, but on-line applications will become more feasible in the future...|$|E

The bulbs of seedlings and sets were graded in three sizes of 2. 5, 3. 5 and 4. 5 mm diameter and 7. 5, 12. 5 and 17. 5 mm diameter, respectively and were sown on 15 th August and Ist September, 2000. Highest mean marketable bulb yield (21. 2 t ha - 1 ) was obtained using 17. 5 mm diameter size sets and seedling with 4. 5 mm diameter bulbs. However, the crop sown with 17. 5 mm diameter sets on 1 st September, produced significantly highest marketable bulb yield of 24. 6 t ha - 1 and also gave {{highest percentage of}} doubles (17. 9 %).

Alternatives to standard 1, 3 -dichloropropene (1, 3 -D) plus phorate injection in the first trial were: (i) delaying applications until after winter rains, (ii) removing roots from planting stock, (iii) 1, 3 -D via drip irrigation, (iv) a chitin-urea soil amendment, (v) the registered insecticide disulfoton, and (vi) several nonregistered nematicides. None of the treatments equaled the standard treatment. In the second trial, potential benefits of adding a systemic nematicide, oxamyl (OX), or a fungicide, metalaxyl (MX), to the standard treatment were explored. Preplant drip irrigation applications of metam sodium (MS), sodium tetrathiocarbonate (ST), and emulsifiable 1, 3 -D were evaluated alone and in combination with postplant applications of OX and MX.

40|$|Onion {{production}} in the United States is seriously affected by the tospovirus Iris Yellow Spot (IYSV), whose symptoms include lenticular-shaped lesions that reduce photosynthesis and bulb yield. Thrips tabacai Lindeman, onion thrips (OT), is the only known vector {{of the disease and}} a primary arthropod pest of onion. Frequent insecticide applications, increasing resistance in OT populations to insecticides, high nitrogen (N) fertilization rates and loss of yield to disease and insect pressure threaten sustainable onion production. The objectives of this study were to identify crop management strategies to enhance onion productivity while suppressing OT and IYSV. Three fertilizer rates and two crop rotations were assigned to replicated plots to assess effects on onion growth, yield, <b>bulb</b> storage <b>quality,</b> soil quality, thrips populations and IYSV incidence. Trap crops of carrot, buckwheat and lacey phacelia were established in commercial fields to evaluate impact on thrips populations and IYSV occurence. Reduced nitrogen (N) rates, one-third the standard grower rate (133. 8 kg N ha- 1), resulted in no yield loss as compared with the standard N rate, despite slower crop maturation. Onions treated with a standard N rate(401. 8 kg N ha- 1) had greater numbers of adult and immature OT than other treatments. Soil nitrate levels were lower and microbial activity measured as dehydrogenase and biomass were greater in reduced N treatments. Plots with buckwheat and phacelia had greater numbers of both adult and immature OT when trap crop apparancy was high (i. e. when onion plants were relatively smaller). There was no observed effect of trap crops on IYSV levels. Results suggest that reduced rate N applications lower numbers of OT while enhancing the microbial population, reducing potential for nitrate leaching while still maintaining yields. Potential for trap crops of buckwheat and lacey phacelia to attract onion thrips from onions exists with successive stands of highly apparent trap crops...|$|R

The organic sector pursues to produce healthy, nutritious food without using synthetic inputs and excessive amounts of natural resources. Access to varieties that are able to cope with weeds, diseases and pests, and thrive well under an organic fertility management regime, allows actors in the organic food production chain to achieve these aspirations. In this thesis I analyse how the current breeding, variety assessment and registration process should be changed to provide varieties that fulfil the needs of organic farmers, traders and processors. The research is based on the cases of two crops, onion (Allium cepa) and spring wheat (Triticum aestivum), that differ in key issues that influence the options for change: breeding and variety registration aspects; organic seed and crop production issues; destination of the harvest; and composition of and relations between actors in the production chain. Variety trials, in which we evaluated onion and spring wheat varieties for traits prioritized by organic stakeholders, revealed that the variety assortment displayed important weaknesses when grown and processed organically. In the case of onion, farmers needed varieties with improvements for resistances against main diseases, root system, storability and erect plant types in combination with high yield. For spring wheat, weed suppressiveness and baking quality were the key traits that required improvements. Interviews with conventional onion breeders showed that they focussed on yield and post-harvest traits (storability, <b>bulb</b> <b>quality).</b> In addition to these traits, breeding for the organic sector would require breeders {{to pay more attention to}} the selection of field traits like partial resistance against leaf diseases and a better root system. To improve key traits for organic growers, selection should take place in a growing environment without the fungicides and herbicides that are typically applied in conventional nurseries. Interviewing conventional wheat breeders made clear that selection for the organic market would conflict with achieving the high yield demanded by conventional growers. Breeders have achieved high yields by increasing the harvest index, which goes at the expense of baking quality through a relative decrease in protein content. Based on a literature review, we propose two alternative approaches to improve yield and protein content simultaneously: selection for increased total biomass or/and selection for protein quality. The first approach would deliver taller, leafier varieties that are also more competitive against weeds. Improving protein quality would require selection under low nitrogen input or organic growing conditions as protein composition is strongly influenced by soil nitrogen availability. Analysis of data of our own conventional and organic variety trials, together with datasets from other European countries showed that for other important traits (e. g., yield, disease resistance, plant length) selection for the organic sector could also be conducted in non-organically managed breeding nurseries, which typically refrain from fungicides and growth regulator applications, as genetic correlations for these traits were high (0. 8 - 1. 0). Conducting variety trials in organic fields and evaluating these for traits prioritized by the stakeholders make results more relevant for the latter. In the specific case of Value for Cultivation and Use (VCU) testing, that is part of the official variety registration procedure of field crops in the EU, adapting the research protocol proved crucial to provide market access to varieties better adapted to organic production. The organic spring wheat VCU testing resulted in the inclusion of varieties in an organic section of the Dutch Recommended List of Varieties, showing that the statutory variety testing system is flexible to address new needs. However, procedures are costly and not in proportion to market size and in this way prohibit the release of varieties for organic and other small markets. Although specifically wheat breeders proved to be open to consider adaptations in their programme, the relatively small market prevents conventional private sector breeders from investing in selecting varieties specifically targeted at the organic sector. Therefore we elaborate options to set up a way of breeding that is in line with organic principles and overcomes this economic barrier.    ...|$|E
40|$|In 2006 a {{study is}} done to {{generate}} ergonomic advices {{with respect to the}} design of a standardized crate that is to be used in flower bulb cultivation and flower bulb trade. Reason for this study was an earlier AKK study, which concluded that standardisation of the crates will reduce costs (particularly for transport) and improve flower <b>bulb</b> <b>quality.</b> Therefore, companies in this sector try to implement standardized crates. The aim {{of the present study was}} to give ergonomic advices concerning the layout of these crates, resulting in reduction of the physical load during manual handling of them. Another goal was to satisfy the people who will have to work with the crates, by respecting their wishes and requirements as far as possible. In close cooperation with the manager of the AKK-study, labour-related questions which remained unanswered in that study are inventoried. Further, according to the method `ergonomic design, additional wishes of the people who will have will work with the standardised crates have been formulated. Finally is examined how the inventoried requirements and wishes can be fulfilled. For that purpose the questions were answered, based on literature reviews, measurements and expertise. Some of the most important results are that: Physical load is lower during the lifting of 40 x 60 cm crates than during the lifting of 50 x 75 cm crates with the same weight. The physical load during the lifting of low standing crates reduces when the crates (and therefore handles) are as high as possible, but this effect is very small. Since the height of the piles is limited by other factors, no effect of crate altitude on physical load is expected when crates have to be moved from or to a high level. Without the use of special tools the physical load is always too high when piles are higher than 1. 70 m. But even in ideal conditions the lifting of 15 or 20 kg crates to an altitude of 1. 70 m results in a Lifting Index of 1. 1 or 1. 4 respectively, what is higher than the health standard. For handles, a dimension of 125 x 40 mm is recommended. Sharp edges must be avoided and it must be impossible to put sharp objects, such as staples, through the handles. Closed handles prevent that bulbs fall through the handles. Physical load when crates are taken from or placed on a high pile can be reduced al little when these handles are not only at the top of the crates, but also halfway. No large effect of standardisation of the layout of the crates on mechanisation is expected, since nearly all tools do not pick up the crates but grip them. Standardisation of the format (40 x 60 cm) is important, however, and the sides must be exactly rectangular. For transport in conditioned sea containers (inner width 2. 26 or 2. 28 m.) 100 x 120 cm pallets are most suitable. However, physical load during manual piling up of crates on these pallets is higher than when 80 x 100 cm pallets are used. In both cases the health limits are largely exceeded during manual handling of the crates. If crates with different altitudes must become piled up on the same pallet, tuning of the altitude of the different crates is needed. Good examples are 18 and 24 cm or 16. 5 and 22 cm. If it must be possible to read the information on the crates automatically, transponders (chips) are preferred over bar codes. It is recommended to apply a low-frequency system and to give all crates only a unique number. A central database can contain information concerning the contents of all crates. The recommendations in this report answer different questions and some of them can not be combined with some others. For this reason the `ideal crate will be a combination of compromises. Therefore it is recommended - in accordance with the original design of this study to carry out a pilot before choosing definitively for one basic design for the standardized crates. In this pilot all users should be involved, and it is preferred to let them test a number of copies of the aimed types of cask...|$|E
