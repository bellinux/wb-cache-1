40|$|A {{completeness}} theorem {{is established}} for logics with congruence endowed with general semantics (in {{the style of}} general frames).

Thus, completeness is shown to be preserved <b>by</b> <b>bring</b> logics with equivalence and general semantics.

5|$|Calhoun was reelected to the Senate in 1845 {{following}} {{the resignation of}} Daniel Elliott Huger. He soon became vocally opposed to the Mexican–American War.

The House of Representatives, through its Northern majority, passed the provision several times.
