5|$|To {{replace the}} aging Class C trains, from 1985 to 1987, ten T4s were {{converted}} to T1300. They were equipped with a pantograph, received a new front and the doors were moved. Six additional T4s were converted in 1989, and given the designation T8. These only had the pantographs equipped and kept the same front and door arrangement. With {{the introduction of the}} T1300, the western lines could remove the conductor and have single-manned trains with the motorman selling tickets. The T1300-units have had better regularity than the older models they replaced. However, because they are designed for a closed system with automatic train protection, the <b>braking</b> <b>systems</b> are not sufficiently dimensioned for when the drivers use line of sight to regulate the speed and distances between trains. The 1300 units were numbered 1301–1349. After the conversions, Oslo Sporveier operated 49 T1300-cars and 146 T1000-cars. The trains were originally painted red with a beige cheatline.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{an investigation of}} <b>braking</b> <b>system</b> characteristics, <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> performance and <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> component design parameters that influence brake pedal force / displacement characteristics as ‘felt’ by the driver in a passenger car. It includes detailed studies of individual <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> component design parameters, operation, and the linear and nonlinear characteristics of internal components through experimental study and simulation modelling. The prediction of brake pedal ‘feel’ in <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> simulation has been achieved using the simulation modelling package AMESim. Each individual <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> component was modelled individually before combining them into the whole <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> {{in order to identify}} the parameters and the internal components characteristics that influence the brake pedal ‘feel’. The simulation predictions were validated by experimentally measured data and demonstrated the accuracy of simulation modelling. Axisymmetric Finite Element Analysis (using the ABAQUS software) was used to predict the behaviour of nonlinear elastomeric internal components such as the piston seal and the booster reaction disc which was then included in the AMESim simulation model. The seal model FEA highlighted the effects of master cylinder and caliper seal deformation on the brake pedal ‘feel’. The characteristics of the brake booster reaction disc were predicted by the FEA and AMESim simulation modelling and these results highlighted the importance of the nonlinear material characteristics, and their potential contribution to brake pedal ‘feel’ improvement. A full <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> simulation model was designed, prepared, and used to predict <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> performance and to design a <b>system</b> with better <b>brake</b> pedal ‘feel’. Each of the <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> component design parameters was validated to ensure that the <b>braking</b> <b>system</b> performance was accurately predicted. The critical parameter of brake booster air valve spring stiffness was identified to improve the brake ‘pedal ‘feel’. This research has contributed to the advancement of automotive engineering by providing a method for <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> engineers to design a <b>braking</b> <b>system</b> with improved pedal ‘feel’. The simulation model can be used in the future to provide an accurate prediction of <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> performance at the design stage thereby saving time and cost...|$|R

25|$|Differential <b>braking</b> <b>systems</b> are {{essentially}} an epicyclic transmission {{with a single}} fixed gear ratio transmitted through idler pinions. The controlled differential adds an extension to the rack holding the idlers, and puts a conventional brake on that extension.

This causes the output on that side to slow down by a fixed amount.|$|E

40|$|Abstract：The {{full power}} {{hydraulic}} <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> has several advantages over traditional <b>brake</b> actuation <b>systems.</b> These systems {{are capable of}} supplying fluid {{to a range of}} very small and large volume service brakes with actuation that is faster than air/hydraulic <b>brake</b> <b>systems.</b> Implementation of full power hydraulic <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> in off-road vehicles calls for good understanding of its dynamic characteristics. In this paper, we consider the problem of dynamic modeling of the <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> and develop a dynamic model for a hydraulic brake valve. First, the dynamic characteristics of full power hydraulic <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> are analyzed theoretically. The effects of varying design parameters (brake valve, accumulator and so on) and the different operating conditions are then analyzed. Second, we investigate the dynamic characteristics of a full power hydraulic <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> using a test bench, which is a loader <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> specifically designed for one construction Machinery Company. Finally, based on the experimental results, the mathematical models are amended and verified. The result shows that the model-calculated data agree well with tested data. The dynamic behavior of hydraulic valve can be well predicted with the model. The simplified models {{can be applied to the}} studies of full power hydraulic <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> dynamics...|$|R
