50|$|The Xindi Council is {{the joint}} {{governmental}} {{body of the}} Xindi races, as seen Season three of Star Trek: Enterprise. The Council was formed after {{the destruction of the}} Xindi homeworld Xindus in the 2030s. It consists of two representatives of each of the Xindi species, and was formed to find a new homeworld for all the Xindi races. However, although they found a few suitable planets, they could never agree on a final choice. The Council chamber is located on a planet 15.6 light-years from Azati Prime. The land-based races sit at a large round table {{in the center of the}} room, while the Aquatics look on from a large tank adjoining the chamber by a window. The chamber has <b>built-in</b> <b>equipment</b> for holographics and a viewscreen for telemetry. The chamber itself was actually a stronghold built by the Xindi-Avians before they were wiped out.|$|E
5000|$|Any additions, {{omissions}} or alterations to the aircraft's certified layout, <b>built-in</b> <b>equipment,</b> airframe and engines, {{initiated by}} any party {{other than the}} type certificate holder, need an approved supplementary ("supplemental" [...] in FAA terminology) type certificate, or STC. The scope of an STC can be extremely narrow or broad. It could include minor modifications to passenger cabin items or installed instruments. More substantial modifications may involve engine replacement, as in the Blackhawk modifications to Cessna Conquest and Beechcraft King Air turboprops, or a complete role change for the aircraft, such as converting a B-17 or Stearman into an agricultural aircraft. STCs are applied due to either the type certificate holder's refusal (frequently due to economics) or its inability to meet some owners' requirements. STCs are frequently raised for out-of-production aircraft types conversions to fit new roles. Before STCs are issued, procedures similar to type certificate changes for new variants are followed, likely including thorough flight tests. STCs belong to the STC holder and are generally more restrictive than type certificate changes.|$|E

40|$|The {{study of}} the length of {{pseudo-random}} binary sequences generated by Linear- Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs) {{plays an important role in}} the design approaches of built-in selftest, cryptosystems, and other applications. However, certain LFSR structures might not be appropriate in some situations.

This paper investigates some conditions and LFSR’s structures, which restrict the pseudo-random binary sequences’ generation to a certain fixed length. The outcomes of this paper are presented in the form of theorems, simulations, and analyses.
