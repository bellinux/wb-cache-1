40|$|A novel {{bacterial}} consortium, NAR- 1 {{consisting of}} Enterococcus sp. C 1 and Citrobacter sp. L 17 was immobilised onto an inorganic support material and investigated for its biodegradation ability of Remazol Black B (RBB), microaerophilically under both batch and fed-batch continuous systems. To study its efficiency under immobilised condition, the NAR- 1 bacterial consortium was adsorbed onto a silica mesoporous material, MCM- 41 before conducting decolourisation experiments. Successful synthesis of MCM- 41 was verified by FTIR, XRD and FESEM. The MCM- 41 powder generated was granulated into spheres of 2 - 4 mm in diameter before immobilisation. Preliminary immobilisation of NAR- 1 was done conventionally by observing three parameters namely: agitation speed, contact time and operating temperature in 0. 85 % (w/v) saline. The highest adsorption of bacteria onto MCM- 41 granules was 7. 8 x 105 cfu/ml at 100 rpm, 2 hours contact time and 37 oC. This preoptimised condition {{was transferred to}} RSM for a more precise prediction. RSM predicted a 7. 8 x 105 cfu/ml using an optimised condition of 1. 9 h contact time at 34 oC and 116 rpm but actual lab experimentusing the above parameters successfully produced a higher immobilised cell count of 9. 0 x 105 cfu/ml. To compare the reusability of free and immobilised cells with both cell counts fixed at 9 x 105 cfu/ml, repeated-batch operation was conducted with constant addition of 100 ppm RBB into Modified P 5 medium pH 7. 0, following each decolourisation cycle. Free cells initially took 240 min in the first cycle, declined to 180 min but yet again elevated to 270 min in the third cycle. It took a staggering 420 min to complete the 4 th cycle of decolourisation. Improving decolourisation trend was observed from 180 min to 120, down to half the time at 60 min with immobilised cells. Eleven cycles were completed for immobilised cells as compared to 4 for free cells within a time-frame of 19 h. For continuous fed-batch system in an upflow packed bed reactor, the decolourisation rate progressively escalated from 50 % within the first 3 hours to 80 % by the 8 th hour. Interestingly, beyond that, stabilised decolourisation at almost 90 % was observed, spanning 28 h covering 9. 49 cycles. A prominent decline was noticed after the 36 th hour and the efficiency plummeted to 0 % by the 56 th hour. This sharp decline was conceivably due to several factors including <b>bacterial</b> <b>leach</b> out, <b>bacterial</b> cell death due to toxic accumulation and detachment of biofilm.

40|$|As one of {{the most}} {{abundant}} elements on earth, iron is nearly always present in metal concentrates. This is specifically true for zinc sulphide concentrates, which can contain up to 18 % iron (marmatite). Today more than half of these concentrates are treated in hydrometallurgical- or combined hydrometallurgical¬pyrometallurgical circuits. In hydrometallurgical circuits, iron is solubilised (either in a roast-Ieach-, a direct leach- or <b>bacterial</b> <b>leach</b> circuit) along with zinc and must be removed from the zinc¬rich solution before the electrowinning- or solvent extraction step. Various iron removal processes were developed to address the iron problem in hydrometallurgical circuits. The better known of these include the jarosite-, goethite- and hematite processes also used in the zinc industry. Zincor (Zinc Corporation of South Africa) patented an iron removal process (Zincor Process), which was generally considered to be very similar to the so-called "para-goethite" iron removal process used only in two other zinc smelters notably Porto Vesme (Italy) and Pasminco Hobart (Tasmania). However, since the Zincor Process was patented in 1976, various changes have been made such as a change from a batch parallel to a continuous series process, a change in precipitation pH-profile and the introduction of a pH controlled acid wash in the second tank. The introduction of a weak acid leach step and vacuum belt filters at Zincor's residue treatment plant in the near future and an iron removal process that is not clearly understood, necessitated this further study of the Zincor iron removal process. The study has been conducted in three parts. The first part of the study has focused on the characterisation of the Zincor iron residue and the Zincor process. The second part of the study has been concerned with the definition of an optimum operating window in terms of the filterability of the residue and the third part investigated the use of neutralisation reagents other than zinc calcine to control the pH during iron precipitation. The distribution of iron in the Zincor iron precipitate, which usually contains between 35 % and 40 % iron, {{has been found to be}} as follows: approximately 45 % as schwertmannite, 5 % as ferrihydrite, 20 % as jarosites, 25 % as franklinite, trace amounts of pyrite as well as 5 % of an unknown phase. This confirmed that goethite is not present in the Zincor iron residue and that iron is mainly removed in the form of amorphous intermediate iron phases such as schwertmannite and ferrihydrite. Of these two phases, schwertmannite was the least expected as most work up until now were done on samples taken from natural environments. The following description of the conditions that promote iron removal, mainly as schwertmannite, is viewed as an expansion of the available literature data, which was gathered at ambient conditions. In terms of the main operating parameters, optimum filterability was achieved under the following conditions: pH of 3. 0, temperature as high as possible (70 °C) and at least 25 kg/m 3 seeding. A retention time of at least 4 hours at a pH of 3. 0 and 60 °C was required, which decreased by more than 50 % at a temperature of 70 °C. As these conditions mainly impact on the soluble zinc loss encountered during iron removal, an effort was made to further reduce the insoluble zinc loss, which is the inherent weakness in the Zincor process, and similar processes where zinc calcine is used for pH control, by investigating the use of alternative neutralisation reagents. This study showed that iron can be successfully removed with Ca(OH) 2, a basic zinc sulphate and zinc oxide mixture as well as chemically precipitated CaC 03 produced in the paper and pulp industry. Of these alternatives, CaC 03 appeared to be the most promising, with filtration rates an order of magnitude higher than the zinc oxide options (calcine and basic zinc sulphate mixture), due to better overall economics than with the use of Ca(OH) 2. Utilisation CaC 03 as an alternative neutralisation agent might increase the overall zinc recovery figure at Zincor by up to 1. 5 %. Based on the findings, it can be concluded that the Zincor process in its current form has a very distinct character compared to what was historically considered to be the very similar patented para-goethite iron removal process, as practiced at the Porto Vesme and the Pasminco Hobart hydrometallurgical zinc plants.

40|$|Biofouling, due to {{bacterial}} growth and colonization, {{is a significant}} obstacle in water treatment that severely affects the membrane performance. Nanofiltration effectively removes viruses and other pathogens but is an energy intensive process. Designing and developing low pressure driven membranes with potential antimicrobial and antibiofouling properties is a concern. Under this framework, biocidal silver nanoparticles based polymeric membranes with high content of silver on the membrane surface can control <b>bacterial</b> colonization. However, <b>leaching</b> of silver during water treatment may also lead to toxicity. In the present work, a unique strategy resulting in distinct surface assembly of silver nanoparticles was established on thiol functionalized PVDF membranes. Nanocluster assembly of silver nanoparticles on the PVDF membrane was obtained by esterification reaction between thioglycolic acid (TGA) and alkaline treated PVDF membrane (TGA-PVDF). On the other hand, by introducing thiol-ene chemistry between pentaerythritol tetrakis(3 -mercaptopropionate) (PETMP) and alkaline treated PVDF (PETMP-PVDF), well dispersed silver nanoparticles can be tailored on the membrane surface. The silver nanocluster assembly on TGA-PVDF membranes results in control leaching, as confirmed by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP) and X-ray photon spectroscopy (XPS) analysis in striking contrast to PETMP-PVDF. The trans-membrane flux was assessed and our results uncover that the designed membranes showed higher flux rate.

40|$|Reusable {{antibacterial}} non-leaching monolithic columns polymerized in microfluidic channels {{designed for}} on-chip cell lysis applications {{were obtained by}} the photoinitiated free radical copolymerization of diallyldimethylammonium chloride (DADMAC) and ethylene glycol diacrylate (EGDA) {{in the presence of}} a porogenic solvent. The microfluidic channels were fabricated in cross-linked poly(methyl methacrylate) (X-PMMA) substrates by laser micromachining. The monolithic columns have the ability to inhibit the growth of, kill and efficiently lyse gram-positive Micrococcus luteus (Schroeter) (ATCC 4698) and Kocuria rosea (ATCC 186), and gram-negative bacteria Pseudomonas putida (ATCC 12633) and Escherichia coli (ATCC 35218) by mechanically shearing the bacterial membrane when forcing the cells to pass through the narrow pores of the monolithic column, and simultaneously disintegrating the cell membrane by physical contact with the antibacterial surface of the column. Cell lysis was confirmed by off-chip PCR without the need for further purification. The influence of the cross-linking monomer on <b>bacterial</b> growth inhibition, <b>leaching,</b> lysis efficiency of the monolithic column and its mechanical stability within the microfluidic channel were investigated and analyzed for three different cross-linking monomers: ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDA), ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA) and 1, 6 -hexanediol dimethacrylate (1, 6 -HDDMA). Furthermore, the bonding efficiency of two X-PMMA substrates with different cross-linking levels was studied. The monolithic columns were shown to be stable, non-leaching, and reusable for over 30 lysis cycles without significant performance degradation or DNA carryover when they were back-flushed between lysis cycles...|$|R
40|$|Bacterial {{transport}} in unsaturated soils is {{much less}} well understood than in saturated conditions, especially for intact soils. This paper aims to investigate the fate and transport of bacteria in intact soils with different water saturations, and particularly the effect of low suction (and hence removal of water flow in the largest macropores). An intact soil column (0. 50 m diameter by 0. 70 m depth) with a tension infiltrometer was used to investigate the transport and deposition of Bacillus subtilis endospores (i. e. dormant and persistent bacteria) during saturated and unsaturated flows. Soil porosity and pore size distribution were measured. Porosity decreased with depth and macropores were concentrated in the topsoil. Three tensiometers and a temperature sensor were installed along the soil column to monitor matric suction and temperature. Breakthrough curves for bacteria and chemical tracer Br- at 0 and 0. 5 kPa suction were obtained during the 3 -month <b>leaching</b> experiment. <b>Bacterial</b> breakthrough occurred earlier than the inert chemical tracer, {{which is consistent with}} effects of pore size exclusion. Also, saturated flow gave a significantly higher concentration and recovery ratio of leached bacteria, i. e. 51 % v. 0. 88 %. Recovery of Br- in leachate at both suctions reached > 85 %. The column was destructively sampled for deposited endospores at the completion of <b>leaching.</b> <b>Bacterial</b> deposition was concentrated in the top 0. 10 m, then decreased abruptly and was relatively constant with column depth, although showing some irregularity {{at the bottom of the}} column...|$|R
40|$|STUDY ON AL- 1 TYPE “QUORUM SENSING” MEDIATED BY THE afeR/afeL GENIC PAIR IN THE EXTREMOPHILE ACIDOPHILE ACIDITHIOBACILLUS FERROOXIDANS BACTERIA. <b>Bacterial</b> mineral <b>leaching,</b> or bioleaching, {{requires}} as a {{first and}} essential step the mineral adhesion of bacteria and the consequent development of a “leaching biofilm”. In mining works, bioleaching involves a bacterial consortium made up of, among other Gram-negative bacteria, by Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans. Plenty of literature analyses 1) mineral adhesion of A. ferrooxidans, and 2) the function of biofilms and their requirement condition in bioleaching processes. However, to date {{it has not been}} possible to identify molecular mechanisms regulating the development of biofilms made up of A. ferrooxidans. Therefore, identifying these molecular mechanisms is a question in need of an answer which could have implications in bioleaching. In various Gram-negative bacteria, the “quorum sensing” system (QS) of the AL- 1 type [cell-cell communication through the autoinducer (AI) of the acyl-homoserine lactone (AHLs) type] is usually one of the predominant molecular mechanisms for regulation of biofilms development. AI- 1 type QS involves two key protein families: LuxI, the acyl-homoserine lactone synthetase or AI- 1 and LuxR, the transcriptional regulator activated by its specific AHL. The analysis of the incomplete genome sequence of the ATCC 23270 strain of A. ferrooxidans had allowed isolating and donating two afeI and afeR genes that codify for afeI and afeR proteins, which feature a high identity with LuxI and LuxR protein families, respectively. Based on these preliminary results, the hypothesis was formulated stating that there was a functional AI- 1 type QS cell-cell communication system mediated by the afeI/afeR genic pair in A. ferrooxidans and that it might regulate the formation of biofilms. Therefore, it was proposed to study and characterize molecular mechanisms in the AI- 1 type QS cell-cell communication system mediated by the afeI/afeR genic pair in A. ferrooxidans In the framework of the Fondecyt project n° 1040676, this study was the first to ever demonstrate the existence of a functional AI- 1 type QS system in acidophilic biomining bacteria such as A. ferrooxidans (Farah et al., 2005; Valenzuela et al., 2006; Valenzuela et al., 2007). A. ferrooxidans produces 9 different types of AHLs with long and medium acyl chains. It was proved that he AfeI protein is a synthase of AHLs. Upstream of afeI, two binding boxes of the AfeR transcriptional regulator, called afe 1 and afe 2 boxes, were identified. The construction of various AHL biosensors using a genetic element of the QS system of A. ferrooxidans (afeR, pafeI, afe boxes) revealed that AfeR acts, at least for the afeI gene, as a positive transcriptional regulator. Finally, induction of afeI transcription levels and AHL concentration in lack of phosphate enabled suggesting that phosphate metabolism and the AI- 1 type QS system are connected, and that the latter may regulate the formation of biofilms in A. ferrooxidans (Farah et al., 2005) just as it has been described for other bacteria. On the other hand, through the use of synthetic AHLs and synthetic analogues of AHLs it has been possible to obtain biological results revealing that AI- 1 type QS would be involved in the adhesion of ATCC 23270 A. ferrooxidans on pyrite (Ruiz et al., 2008). This result is even more relevant given that it was demonstrated 1) that this AI- 1 type QS system is present in different strains of A. ferrooxidans; 2) that AHLs are produced by different strains of Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans; and finally, 3) that type III Leptospirillum sp possesses a QS genetic locus (IttR/lttI). All these results allow suggesting that cell-cell bacterial communication must occur within a planktonic bioleaching community or in biofilm state on the material. Therefore, identifying molecules with an agonistic or antagonistic effect on the adhesion to the mineral (Ruiz et al., 2008) and the molecular modelling in regard to the AfeR-AHL interaction (Soulére et al., in press) open the doors to the design of experimental strategies that allow interfering with bacterial communication in order to, on the one hand, improve efficiency of the bioleaching process and, on the other hand, control the appearance of contaminant biofilms in acid waters from mine drainage.
