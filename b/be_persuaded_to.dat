5|$|Around 60,000 former Czar's army troopers {{remained}} {{stationed in}} Finland in January 1918. The soldiers were demoralized and war-weary, and the home-sick, former serfs were thirsty for farmland set free by the revolutions. The {{majority of the}} troops returned to Russia {{by the end of}} March 1918. In total 7,000 to 10,000 Red Russian warmen supported the Finnish Reds, but around 4,000, in separate smaller units of 100–1,000 soldiers, could <b>be</b> <b>persuaded</b> <b>to</b> fight in the front line.|$|E
5|$|Similar {{tensions}} existed {{with the}} Spanish. Writing from HMS Royal Oak, off Mobile Bay, on 15 March 1815, Rear Admiral Pulteney Malcolm, Cochrane's subordinate {{commander of the}} Mobile Squadron, assured Don Mateo Gonzalez Manrique, the Governor at Pensacola, that Post-Captain Robert Cavendish Spencer (a son of George Spencer, 2nd Earl Spencer) of , had been detailed to conduct a strict enquiry into the conduct of Nicolls and Captain Woodbine, regarding the property losses of Spanish inhabitants of Florida. Malcolm believed that in cases where former slaves could not <b>be</b> <b>persuaded</b> <b>to</b> return to their owners, the British government would undertake to remunerate the owners.|$|E

There, he suffered a heart attack, {{but he had to}} <b>be</b> <b>persuaded</b> <b>to</b> see a doctor and he refused to be admitted to a hospital.|$|E

5|$|FIFA {{president}} Jules Rimet intervened, {{and eventually}} four European teams {{made the trip}} by sea: Belgium, France, Romania, and Yugoslavia. The Romanians, managed by Constantin Rădulescu and coached by their captain Rudolf Wetzer and Octav Luchide, entered the competition following the intervention of newly crowned King CarolII. He selected the squad personally, and negotiated with employers {{to ensure that the}} players would still have jobs upon their return. The French entered at the personal intervention of Rimet, but neither France's star defender Manuel Anatol nor the team's regular coach Gaston Barreau could <b>be</b> <b>persuaded</b> <b>to</b> make the trip. The Belgians participated at the instigation of German-Belgian FIFA vice-president Rodolphe Seeldrayers.|$|E
5|$|Three-year-old {{polar bear}} Mercedes {{was given to}} the zoo in 1984, after she was rescued in Churchill, Manitoba, Canada. She had begun {{wandering}} into the town in search of food. Because of the danger she posed to residents, Mercedes was tagged with a number so she could be tracked. When she could not <b>be</b> <b>persuaded</b> <b>to</b> return to the wild, a decision was taken to shoot her. A member of the Edinburgh Zoological Society collaborated with a cousin in Canada {{and they were able to}} rescue Mercedes, finding her a new home at Edinburgh zoo. The bear would become one of the zoo's most popular attractions.|$|E
5|$|It {{was hoped}} by Stuart and Rainer that the Batavian {{governor}} Johan Van Angelbeek might <b>be</b> <b>persuaded</b> <b>to</b> allow a peaceful occupation of Ceylon by British forces, {{especially in light}} of the Kew Letters from William of Orange, which advocated cooperation with British forces. A Major Agnew was sent ashore at Colombo to negotiate and his attempts to persuade Van Angelbeek to allow 300 British troops to land at Fort Oostenberg, which overlooked Trincomalee, were successful. On arrival off the port on the eastern coast of Ceylon on 1 August however the commander of the defences refused to acknowledge the instruction, citing problems with the wording of the instructions. For two days attempts were made to convince the Batavian commander, the British position partially undermined by the destruction of Diomede in Trincomalee harbour after striking an uncharted rock. Although all of the crew and passengers were saved, large quantities of military stores sank with the frigate.|$|E

5|$|The {{defeat at}} Ardabil {{was a major}} shock to the Muslims, who {{for the first time}} faced an enemy {{penetrating}} so deep within the borders of the Caliphate, and Caliph Hisham appointed the veteran military leader Sa'id ibn Amr al-Harashi to take command against the Khazars. Although the forces he could muster immediately (including refugees from Ardabil who had to be paid ten gold dinars to <b>be</b> <b>persuaded</b> <b>to</b> fight) were small, Sa'id managed to recover Akhlat on Lake Van. From there he moved northeast to Bardha'a and south again to relieve the siege of Warthan. Near Bajarwan Sa'id came upon a 10,000-strong Khazar army, which he defeated, killing most of the Khazars, and rescuing the prisoners they had with them. The surviving Khazars fled north, with Sa'id in pursuit. Despite this success, Sa'id was relieved of his command in early 731 and even imprisoned for a while {{as a result of the}} jealousy of Maslama, whom Hisham re-appointed as governor of Armenia and Adharbayjan. Maslama came to the Caucasus with many Jaziran troops and took to the offensive. He restored the provinces of Albania to Muslim allegiance through exemplary punishment of those who resisted his advance, and reached Derbent, where he found a Khazar garrison. Bypassing the fortress, Maslama advanced north, following the retreating Khazars. Although the details of this campaign in the sources may be confused with that of 728, it appears that he took Khamzin, Balanjar, and Samandar before being forced to retreat again after a confrontation with the khagan himself, in which Barjik was reportedly killed and the khagan wounded. The Khazars shadowed Maslama's march south and attacked him near Derbent, but the Arab army dug a trench and defeated them. Taking advantage of his victory, Maslama evicted the Khazars from Derbent by poisoning their water supply and re-founded the city as a military colony, garrisoning it with 24,000 mostly Syrian troops. After that he returned with the rest of his army (mostly the favoured Jaziran and Qinnasrini contingents) south of the Caucasus for the winter, while the Khazars re-occupied their abandoned towns. Despite the capture of Derbent, Maslama's record was apparently unsatisfactory for Hisham, who replaced his brother in March 732 with Marwan ibn Muhammad, who would later reign as the last Umayyad caliph in 744–750.|$|E

25|$|Compared {{with what}} had gone before and what {{followed}} it was a small, low-cost affair. The approach was from {{the north side of}} the mountain and the climbing was planned to be after the monsoon. The monsoon was unusually late that year and, beset by the weather and in difficult conditions of snow, little was achieved regarding the summit. However, a very large number of lesser peaks were climbed for the first time and a southern route up the Western Cwm was identified as a possible line of approach if Nepal could ever <b>be</b> <b>persuaded</b> <b>to</b> change its policy of not admitting climbers.|$|E

Sensing that some members of the Court might <b>be</b> <b>persuaded</b> <b>to</b> change their votes, Stevens wrote a dissent that read like a majority opinion, and could be changed to one with the substitution of a few words.|$|E

25|$|To {{meet this}} requirement, Folland {{designed}} the Nighthawk, a wooden two-bay biplane. An initial order for 150 Nighthawks {{was placed in}} August 1918, well before prototypes or flight-ready engines were available, with the first prototype, serial number F-2909 flying in April or May 1919. By this time, {{it was clear that}} the Dragonfly had serious problems, being prone to extreme overheating (which was so severe as to char propeller hubs), high fuel consumption and severe vibration (inadvertently being designed to run at its resonance frequency). When the engine could <b>be</b> <b>persuaded</b> <b>to</b> work, the Nighthawk showed excellent performance, but in September 1919, it was finally recognised that the Dragonfly was unsalvagable and the engine programme was cancelled, although by this time 1,147 engines had been delivered.|$|E

Douglas Haig– at that time involved in intrigues to have Robertson appointed Chief of the Imperial General Staff– recommended that Kitchener be appointed Viceroy of India (“where trouble was brewing”) but not to the Middle East, where his strong personality would have led to that sideshow receiving too much attention and resources. Kitchener visited Rome and Athens, but Murray warned that he would likely demand the diversion of British troops to fight the Turks in the Sinai.|$|E
25|$|Late in {{the evening}} of 9 September 1915, tsar Ferdinand and prime {{minister}} Vasil Radoslavov signed a decree of general mobilization declaring 11 September as its first operational day. The Bulgarian General Staff began carrying out all the tasks concerning the mobilization. Special attention {{was focused on the}} border with Serbia where the main Bulgarian forces had to be deployed. This was necessary as the Serbian high command was aware of the Bulgarian preparations and had deployed half its fully mobilized and organized army on the Bulgarian border, ready to deliver a heavy blow against the Bulgarian Army while it was still in a vulnerable stage of mobilization and concentration. This bold idea however was soon dropped because the Allied command still thought that Bulgaria could <b>be</b> <b>persuaded</b> <b>to</b> join the Entente.|$|E
