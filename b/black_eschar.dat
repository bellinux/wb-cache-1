50|$|Cutaneous anthrax, {{also known}} as Hide porter's disease, is when anthrax occurs on the skin. It {{is the most common}} form (>90% of anthrax cases). Cutaneous anthrax is also the least {{dangerous}} form of anthrax (~0% mortality rate with treatment). Cutaneous anthrax presents as a boil-like skin lesion that eventually forms an ulcer with a black center (eschar). The <b>black</b> <b>eschar</b> often shows up as a large, painless necrotic ulcer (beginning as an irritating and itchy skin lesion or blister that is dark and usually concentrated as a black dot, somewhat resembling bread mold) at the site of infection. In general, cutaneous infections form within the site of spore penetration between two and five days after exposure. Unlike bruises or most other lesions, cutaneous anthrax infections normally do not cause pain. Nearby lymph nodes may become infected, reddened, swollen and painful. A scab forms over the lesion soon, and falls off in a couple of weeks. Complete recovery may take longer.Cutaneous anthrax is typically caused when B. anthracis spores enter through cuts on the skin. This form is found most commonly when humans handle infected animals and/or animal products.|$|E

The patient was treated with oral ciprofloxacin at a dose of 2 g daily, and 2 % topical erythromycin solution. Despite improvement, the evidence of cystic lesions persisted. There was no history of similar lesions in any other family member. There was no history of trauma. The patient was not using any topical or systemic medication. Two weeks before his visit, he had a history of leech therapy under the supervision of a general practitioner. His medical history was significant for leech therapy of the lesions, five days previously.

Journal of Hand Surgery (British and European Volunw I 996) 21 B: 2. 261 262 Mucormycosis (also known as phycomycosis or zygo-mycosis) is an invasive fungal infection which occurs in immunocompromised patients (Hitchcock and Amadio, 1989). The causative fungi, the zygomycetes, are known to invade blood vessels. Inhalation of spores results in either rhinocerebral or pulmonary mucormy-cosis. Rhinocerebral infection {{is the most common}} form of disease and presents as a <b>black</b> <b>eschar</b> in the nose with subsequent extension to the brain and occlusion of cerebral blood vessels. Similarly, pulmonary disease eventually leads to pulmonary infarction secondary to hyphal invasion of pulmonary vessels. Ingestion of spores leads to gastrointestinal mucormycosis with gut necrosis and bloody diarrhoea. Cutaneous mucormy-cosis occurs as a secondary infection following skin injuries such as burns, lacerations and at injection sites (Palmer et al, 1970; Jain et al, 1978). Treatment includes wide local d 6 bridement and systemic amphotericin B. recommendation for surgical debridement. One week later, redness and swelling were observed along the radial artery in the distal forearm and later extended over the thenar area (Fig 2). Until this stage, there was no evidence of any vascular compromise of the hand. A week later, the eschar separated spontaneously resulting in a large ulcer over the dorsum of the forearm (Fig 3).

These results are considered preliminary and additional testing is underway to clarify these results and determine whether the initial test was accurate. This mail handling facility {{is located on the}} grounds of the Anacostia Naval Station in the Washington D. C. Metropolitan area. Clinicians are urged to review the signs and symptoms of anthrax and consider the diagnosis with their patients. Inhalational anthrax starts with a nonspecific prodrome (i. e., fever, dyspnea, cough, and chest discomfort) follows inhalation of infectious spores. Approximately 2 [...] 4 days after initial symptoms, sometimes after a brief period of improvement, respiratory failure and hemodynamic collapse ensue. Inhalational anthrax also might include thoracic edema and a widened mediastinum on chest radiograph. Gram-positive bacilli can grow on blood culture, usually 2 [...] 3 days after onset of illness. Cutaneous anthrax follows deposition of the organism onto the skin, occurring particularly on exposed areas of the hands, arms, or face. An area of local edema becomes a pruritic macule or papule, which enlarges and ulcerates after 1 [...] 2 days. Small, 1 [...] 3 mm vesicles may surround the ulcer.

We report here the clinico-demographic profile and treatment outcome of 15 cutaneous anthrax cases attended at the Dermatology Outpatient Department of Rajshahi Medical College Hospital, Bangladesh between April and August, 2011 with an aim to create awareness for early case detection and management. Findings Anthrax was suspected primarily based on cutaneous manifestations of typical non-tender ulcer with <b>black</b> <b>eschar,</b> with or without oedema, {{and a history of}} butchering, or dressing/washing of cattle/goat or their meat. Diagnosis was established by demonstration of large gram-positive rods, typically resembling B. anthracis under light microscope where possible and also by ascertaining therapeutic success. The mean age of cases was 21. 4 [*]years (ranging from 3 to 46 [*]years), 7 (46. 7 %) being males and 8 (53. 3 %) females. The majority of cases were from lower middle socioeconomic status. Types of exposures included butchering (20 %), contact with raw meat (46. 7 %), and live animals (33. 3 %). Malignant pustule was present in upper extremity, both extremities, face, and trunk at frequencies of 11 (73. 3 %), 2 (13. 3 %), 1 (6. 7 %) and 1 (6. 7 %) respectively. Eight (53. 3 %) patients presented with fever, 7 (46. 7 %) had localized oedema and 5 (33. 3 %) had regional lymphadenopathy.

Etiology Anthrax is caused by Bacillus anthracis, unmovable, aerobic, gram-positive rods. It forms spores, which can survive for years in the environment. Pathogenesis Capsular polypeptide and anthrax toxin are the principal virulence factors of Bacillus anthracis. Anthrax toxin consists of three proteins called protective antigen, edema factor, and lethal factor. It is thought that the inflammatory mediator - lethal factor is stored within the macrophage during the early stage of infection. It is rapidly released in large amounts into the blood stream and once the threshold for lysis is reached, it may be the cause of sudden death. Epidemiology Grass-eating animals are usually infected by the bacilli from grass and ground. The disease is transmitted to people by contact with the sick animals or their products, such as wool skin, meat etc. Clinical features Two clinical forms exist: outer cutaneous and inner, including inhalation and gastrointestinal anthrax. While cutaneous anthrax is easily cured, the inner forms have high mortality rates. Diagnosis and differential diagnosis The diagnosis is easily established in cutaneous cases, characterized by <b>black</b> <b>eschar.</b> Severe intoxication and collapse during the course of bronchopneumonia or hemorrhagic enteritis should arise suspicion of anthrax. Therapy Hospitalization of patients is mandatory. Bacillus anthracis is susceptible to a number of antibiotics, including penicillin, erythromycin tetracyclines, cephalosporins etc. Prevention General veterinary prevention including vaccination of livestock and control of products is very important. The vaccine consists of anthrax bacillus that is attenuated. The endangered population, such as animal workers and military personnel should be vaccinated. Annual schedule of booster immunization must be maintained. Anthrax as a biological weapon Anthrax has been developed as {{a weapon of mass destruction}} since World War I. During accidental release from a biological warfare factory in the farmer Soviet Union, 68 people died. The ease of laboratory production and its dissemination via aerosol led to its adoption by terrorists, as shown by recent happenings in the USA. Conclusion A good knowledge of anthrax, its transmission and potentials as a biological weapon is essential for timely prevention and protection...|$|E
40|$|Diabetes {{causes a}} wide {{spectrum}} of diseases in and around the eye. Diabetic damage {{is not limited to the}} lens and retina, but also includes other orbital, ocular and neurological complications. The WHO estimates that there are 150 million people worldwide living with diabetes, and expects this figure to double by 2025. More than 90 % of these patients are type 2 diabetics. According to WHO and CDC statistics there are about 7. 5 million undiagnosed diabetics in the USA. Orbit and lids Mucormyces mucor is an anaerobic fungus which is a commensal organism in immune-competent individuals. In diabetic patients with immunoparesis it can cause an invasive life-threatening infection. It invades endothelial cells and causes necrotising vasculitis. The patient may present with orbital cellulitis. The hallmark of this disease is a <b>black</b> <b>eschar</b> on the eyelids or palate. A high index of suspicion and prompt referral to an ear, nose and throat specialist or an ophthalmologist are required. A biopsy or pus swab will confirm the diagnosis. Treatment is surgical débridement to the border of viable tissue and intravenous amphotericin B. Hyperbaric oxygen may also be beneficial. Cornea Neurotrophic keratopathy Corneal sensation is supplied by the first branch of the trigeminal nerve and may be affected in long-standing diabetics. This predisposes the patient to recurrent corneal erosions and infectious keratitis. Infectious keratitis This may occur in a neurotrophic cornea. As part of the immunoparesis, or because of microtrauma, diabetics are predisposed to fungal keratitis (Fig. 1), especially with Candida spp. The patient presents with a gradual onset of a painful eye, with conjunctival injection and a white, well-circumscribed corneal infiltrate. There may be a pus level in the anterior chamber (hypopyon). The diagnosis is made by an ophthalmologist on corneal scraping and culture of the specimen. Antifungal treatment is with amphotericin B or fluconazole. Lens Refractive instability Fluctuations in blood glucose level may cause swelling of the lens because of osmotic changes. Patients may be aware of intermittent blurring in vision as their refractive status may fluctuate until blood glucose levels are stabilised. This may occur in newly diagnosed diabetics or in those whose blood glucose levels are unstable...|$|E
