40|$|Biofuels {{have become}} very {{important}} topics {{over the past decade}} due to the rise in crude oil prices, fear of running out of crude oil, and environmental impact of emissions. Biodiesel is a biofuel that is made from plant seed oils, waste cooking oils, or animal fats. It has become increasingly popular and is looked at as a diesel replacement. This research characterizes the emissions of the new John Deere PowerTech Plus 4045 HF 285 in the Advance Engine Research Laboratory at Texas A&M University and compares the emissions of a 100 percent <b>blended</b> <b>feed</b> stock biodiesel to an ultra low sulfur diesel certification fuel. The steady state tests were conducted while holding engine speed constant at three different speeds and three different loads. The gaseous emissions, exhaust gas recirculation, fuel flow rate, and torque were monitored and recorded for 300 points per test. Four tests were performed and the results were averaged per each fuel. Carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, oxygen, and oxides of nitrogen emissions were analyzed. The biodiesel averaged up to 12 % lower torque, 5. 4 % more fuel, 7. 5 % less carbon dioxide, 29 % more oxygen, and 29 % more oxides of nitrogen. Overall the biodiesel produced less torque and carbon dioxide emissions, while emitting more oxygen and oxides of nitrogen...|$|E
40|$|The {{baseline}} bulk-vitrification (BV) process (also {{known as}} in-container vitrification ICV™) includes a mixer/dryer to convert liquid low-activity waste (LAW) into a dried, <b>blended</b> <b>feed</b> for vitrification. Feed preparation includes blending LAW with glass-forming minerals (GFMs) and cellulose and drying {{the mixture to}} a suitable dryness, consistency, and particle size for transport to the ICVTM container. The cellulose is {{to be added to}} the BV feed at a rate sufficient to destroy 75 % of the nitrogen present as nitrate or nitrite. Concern exists that flammable gases may be produced during drying operations at levels that could pose a risk. The drying process is conducted under vacuum in the temperature range of 60 to 80 °C. These flammable gases could be produced either through thermal decomposition of cellulose or waste organics or as a by-product of the reaction of cellulose and/or waste organics with nitrate or the postulated small amount of nitrite present in the waste. To help address the concern about flammable gas production during drying, the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) performed studies to identify the gases produced at dryer temperatures and at possible process upset conditions. Studies used a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) up to 525 °C and isothermal testing up to 120 °C to determine flammable gas production resulting from the cellulose and organic constituents in bulk vitrification feed. This report provides the results of those studies to determine the effects of cellulose and waste organics on flammable gas evolutio...|$|E
40|$|The Hanford Tank Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant (WTP) is {{procuring}} through Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) {{a minimum}} of five 3, 500 gallon batches of waste simulant for Phase 1 testing in the Pretreatment Engineering Platform (PEP). To {{make sure that the}} quality of the simulant is acceptable, the production method was scaled up starting from laboratory-prepared simulant through 15 -gallon vendor prepared simulant and 250 -gallon vendor prepared simulant before embarking on the production of the 3500 -gallon simulant batch by the vendor. The 3500 -gallon PEP simulant batches were packaged in 250 -gallon high molecular weight polyethylene totes at NOAH Technologies. The simulant was stored in an environmentally controlled environment at NOAH Technologies within their warehouse before blending or shipping. For the 15 -gallon, 250 -gallon, and 3500 -gallon batch 0, the simulant was shipped in ambient temperature trucks with shipment requiring nominally 3 days. The 3500 -gallon batch 1 traveled in a 70 - 75 °F temperature controlled truck. Typically the simulant was uploaded in a PEP receiving tank within 24 -hours of receipt. The first uploading required longer with it stored outside. Physical and chemical characterization of the 250 -gallon batch was necessary to determine the effect of aging on the simulant in transit from the vendor and in storage before its use in the PEP. Therefore, aging tests were conducted on the 250 -gallon batch of the vendor-produced PEP <b>blended</b> <b>feed</b> simulant to identify and determine any changes to the physical characteristics of the simulant when in storage. The supernate was also chemically characterized. Four aging scenarios for the vendor-produced blended simulant were studied: 1) stored outside in a 250 -gallon tote, 2) stored inside in a gallon plastic bottle, 3) stored inside in a well mixed 5 -L tank, and 4) subject to extended temperature cycling under summer temperature conditions in a gallon plastic bottle. The following series of aging tests were conducted to accomplish these objectives...|$|E

Pigs were blocked and randomly allocated to the following feeding strategies on the basis of initial LW: (1) phase-feeding: diets changed when the average LW of pigs in the pen reached 30, 50 or 80 kg; (2) blend: diets changed weekly to meet the requirements of the average LW of pigs in the pen and; (3) single: the same diet fed throughout (formulated to meet the requirements of the pig at 60 kg LW). The experimental diets were fed for ten weeks. There was no difference in growth performance at any time period (P > 0. 05) between feeding strategies. Dressing percentage was lower in pigs fed the blend and single diet feeding strategies compared to phase-feeding (P = 0. 05). Pigs on the blend and single diet feeding strategy deposited more fat compared to those that were phase-fed (P = 0. 015). Intramuscular fat was also increased in pigs on the <b>blend</b> <b>feeding</b> strategy compared to pigs fed the single diet or phase fed (P = 0. 007). Feeding a single diet and blend-feeding appear to have some merit and either strategy may be appropriate under certain circumstances, for example, for smaller producers.

40|$|The Pulp Process (PP) Treatment {{option was}} {{conceived}} {{as a replacement for}} the current Filter Leaching System (FLS). The FLS has operated at the Idaho Nuclear Technology and Engineering Center of the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory since 1995 to treat radioactive, mixed waste HEPA filters. In recent years, the FLS has exhibited difficulty in removing mercury from the HEPA filters as the concentration of mercury in the spent HEPA filters has increased. The FLS leaches and washes the whole filter without any preparation or modification. The filter media and the trapped calcine particles are confined in a heavy filter housing that contributes to poor mixing zones {{around the edges of the}} filter, low media permeability, channeling of the liquid through cracks and tears in the filter media, and liquid retention between leach and rinse cycles. In the PP, the filter media and the trapped calcine particles are separated from the filter housing and treated as a pulp, taking advantage of improved contact with the leach solution that cannot be achieved when the media is still in the HEPA filter housing. In addition to removing the mercury more effectively, the PP generates less volume of liquid waste, requires a shorter leach cycle time, and possesses the versatility for treating filters of different sizes. A series of tests have been performed in the laboratory to demonstrate the advantages of the PP concept. These tests compare the PP with the FLS under controlled conditions that simulate the current operating parameters. A prior study using <b>blended</b> <b>feed,</b> a mixture of shredded clean HEPA filter media and non-radioactive calcine particles, indicated that the PP would significantly increases the calcine dissolution percentages. In this study, hazardous-metal contaminated HEPA filter media was studied. The results of side-by-side tests indicated that the PP increased the mercury removal percentage by 80 % and might be a solution to the mercury removal problem encountered by the current FLS. A patent application has been filed for the PP and the patent is pending. In order to validate the PP and collect information for engineering design and economical feasibility studies, pilot plant scale tests are planned...|$|E
40|$|About 50 {{million gallons}} of {{high-level}} mixed waste is currently in storage in underground tanks at The United States Department of Energy's (DOE's) Hanford site in the State of Washington. The Hanford Tank Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant (WTP) will provide DOE's Office of River Protection (ORP) with a means of treating this waste by vitrification for subsequent disposal. The tank waste will be separated into low- and high-activity fractions, which will then be vitrified respectively into Immobilized Low Activity Waste (ILAW) and Immobilized High Level Waste (IHLW) products. The ILAW product will be disposed of in an engineered facility on the Hanford site while the IHL W product will be directed to the national deep geological disposal facility for high-level nuclear waste. The ILAW and IHLW products must meet a variety of requirements with respect to {{protection of the environment}} before they can be accepted for disposal. The Office of River Protection is currently examining options to optimize the Low Activity Waste (LAW) facility and the LAW glass waste form. One option under evaluation is to enhance the waste processing rate of the vitrification plant currently under construction. It is likely that the capacity of the LAW vitrification plant can be increased incrementally by implementation of a variety of low-risk, high-probability changes, either separately or in combination. These changes include: (1) Operating at the higher processing rates demonstrated at the LAW Pilot Melter; (2) Increasing the glass pool surface area within the existing external melter envelope; (3) Increasing plant availability; (4) Increasing the glass waste loading; (5) Removing sulfate from the LAW stream; (6) Operating the melter at slightly higher temperature; (7) Installing the third LAW melter into the WTP plant; and (8) Other smaller impact changes. The tests describes in this report utilized <b>blended</b> <b>feed</b> (glass formers plus waste simulant) prepared by Optima Chemicals according to VSL specifications. Sufficient feed was prepared to produce nearly two metric tons of glass. Sugar was added (at VSL) to the feed at a ratio of 0. 5 (1 mole sucrose per 16 mole NOx). The DM 100 -WV melter was used in order to provide a direct comparison with the LAW tests previously conducted on the same melter. Two 75 -hour melter tests were conducted at two elevated temperatures, 1175 and 1225 C. These tests were preceded by the production of sufficient glass to turn over the melt pool to the target composition. Key operating parameters were held constant to investigate the effects of the operating temperature on processing characteristics, particularly melting rate. At each operating temperature, the feed rate was adjusted to provide a near-complete cold cap 99 - 100 % of melt surface covered with feed.

40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of preparation and characterization of chemical plugs based on selected Hanford Site waste simulants. Included are the results of chemical plug bench testing conducted in support of the M 1 /M 6 Flow Loop Chemical Plugging/Unplugging Test (TP-RPP-WTP- 495 Rev A). These results support the proposed plug simulants for the chemical plugging/ unplugging tests. Based on the available simulant data, a set of simulants was identified that would likely result in chemical plugs. The three types of chemical plugs that were generated and tested in this task consisted of: 1. Aluminum hydroxide (NAH), 2. Sodium aluminosilicate (NAS), and 3. Sodium aluminum phosphate (NAP). While both solvents, namely 2 molar (2 M) nitric acid (HNO 3) and 2 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH) at 60 °C, used in these tests were effective in dissolving the chemical plugs, the 2 M nitric acid was significantly more effective in dissolving the NAH and NAS plugs. The caustic was only slightly more effecting at dissolving the NAP plug. In the bench-scale dissolution tests, hot (60 °C) 2 M nitric acid was the most effective solvent in that it completely dissolved both NAH and NAS chemical plugs much faster (1. 5 – 2 x) than 2 M sodium hydroxide. So unless there are operational benefits for the use of caustic verses nitric acid, 2 M nitric acid heated to 60 °C C should be the solvent of choice for dissolving these chemical plugs. Flow-loop testing was planned to identify a combination of parameters such as pressure, flush solution, composition, and temperature that would effectively dissolve and flush each type of chemical plug from preformed chemical plugs in 3 -inch-diameter and 4 -feet-long pipe sections. However, based on a review {{of the results of the}} bench-top tests and technical discussions, the Waste Treatment Plant (WTP) Research and Technology (R&T), Engineering and Mechanical Systems (EMS), and Operations concluded that flow-loop testing of the chemically plugged pipe sections would not provide any additional information or useful data. The decision was communicated through a Sub Contract Change Notice (SCN- 070) that included a revised scope as follows: • Photographing the chemical plugs in the pipes before extrusion to compare the morphology of aged gels with that of fresh gels. • Setting up an extrusion apparatus and extruding the chemical plugs. • Documenting the qualitative observations on the efforts to remove the chemical plug materials from the pipe sections. • Performing X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of extruded gel samples to detect any crystallization of gel during storage. • Disposing of the extruded gel as a waste. • Documenting the analytical results in a test report. There were no significant morphological differences between the fresh and aged plugs except for an overgrowth of small transparent crystals on the surface of the aged NAS gel plug. An initial pressure of 15 KPa for the NAS plug and from ~ 2 to 6 KPa for the NAH plug. Following extrusion, the NAP plug sections were thixotropic. The bulk of all the aged gel plugs consisted of amorphous material with nitratine constituting the crystalline phase.

40|$|Commercial <b>feed</b> <b>blending</b> is {{a complex}} process {{consisting}} of many potential raw ingredi-ents and final products. The sheer number of daily orders and final products at a typical feed mill means that raw ingredients cannot be mixed to directly produce final products in an economical fashion. As a result, the intermediate production of pellets with prespecified nutritional content is a necessity that makes the <b>feed</b> <b>blending</b> problem highly nonlinear. We discuss a nonlinear approach to <b>feed</b> <b>blending</b> and compare results from an empirical application to those from a sequential linear programming approach common to most feed mills. Modern U.

The typical feed mill likely produces and delivers feed for poultry (turkeys and broilers), swine, beef cattle, and dairy operations. 1 Each of these operations requires several types of feed rations since they are typically designed around the nutritional requirements of animals in var-ious stages of growth or production. For example, a lactating dairy cow requires a different feed ration than a bred heifer and a just weaned pig requires a different feed ration than a hog approaching market weight. Although feed ration balancing is a prototype-blending problem found in many introductory linear programming (LP) textbooks (for example, Paris or Taylor), there are many reasons why strict application of the model is not used at feed mills. First, the sheer number of final products produced in conjunction with multiple daily orders of varying sizes, means that raw ingredients cannot be mixed to directly produce final products in an economical or practical manner. Also, storage and other production-capacity constraints limit the usefulness of such a basic approach. As a result, feed mills combine raw ingredients to produce a set of intermediate products {{that can be used in}} a variety of ways to produce final products possessing the appropriate nutritional composition.

But with treatment process inefficiencies and the proven negative environmental impacts of landfills, developing further landfills for treated waste disposal can't remain as the only option. Alternative ways for solid waste management need to be identified. Energy recovery from solid waste known as waste-to-energy (WTE) is one such alternative. Waste to Energy technologies such as modern incineration and gasification processes have been gaining popularity as they can significantly reduce the volume of solid wastes {{and at the same time}} produce a combination of heat and electricity.

The laboratory preparation steps and observations were compared with an existing experience base to verify the acceptability of the feed specification for simulant make-up. The most significant test results included a variety of features. Ferrocyanide breaks down to NH{sub 3 } plus formate, during the low-temperature calcining phase of the tests. Ferrocyanide displayed no redox reactivity with the nitrates and nitrites contained in the slurry in the absence of sugar. Sugar displays a redox reaction with the nitrates and nitrites in the blend similar to the redox. reaction observed in the LLW feed simulant. Boiling of a free flowing slurry occurs at temperatures below about 120 {degrees}C. When about 45 % of the total water loss has occurred, the feed slurry congeals and continues to lose water, shrinking and developing shrinkage cracks. Water stops coming off between 350 {degrees}C and 400 {degrees}C. Slurry shear strength and viscosity strongly increase as the weight percent solids increases from 20 wt% to 45 wt%. The 45 wt% solids corresponds to approximately a 40 % water loss. The principle beat sensitivity for this material is the exothermic reaction which is activated when the temperature exceeds about 250 {degrees}C. The breakdown of ferrocyanide to ammonia and formate under strongly basic conditions may begin at temperatures less than 100 {degrees}C, but the rate increased strongly with increasing temperature and appeared to be completed in the time of our tests.

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{the problem}} of animal feed {{formulation}} is addressed. A feed product is comprised of various kinds of raw ingredients. Traditionally, the least cost formulation (LCF) approach {{is used in the}} feed industry to determine the optimal <b>blend</b> of the <b>feed</b> ingredients based on nutritional requirements and raw material costs. LCF, however, does not consider the production cost. In practice, a wide variety of raw ingredients may require different levels of production load. For example, feed ingredients with high amount of fiber content may reduce the pelleting production rate, leading to high production cost. The main focus of this study is the development of a mathematical model to find an optimal <b>blend</b> of the <b>feed</b> ingredients with an objective to minimize the overall cost consisting of raw material cost, production cost, and opportunity cost. Multiple linear regression equations are used to estimate the production rate that depends on the fat and the fiber contents in the feed mix and the durability index of the feed pellet.

There {{are two ways to}} use high blends of SVO (Straight Vegetable Oil) in diesel engines: fixed <b>blending</b> ratio <b>feeding</b> to the engine and variable <b>blending</b> ratio <b>feeding</b> to the engine. This paper employed the latter using an on-board blending system-Bioltec system, which is capable of heating the vegetable oils and feeding the engine with neat PD or different blends of vegetable oils depending on engine load and temperature. A used cooking oil derived SVO type of biofuel, the C 2 G Ultra Biofuel (C 2 G: Convert to Green), which is a fully renewable fuel made as a diesel replacement from processed used cooking oil, used directly in diesel engines specifically modified for this purpose, has been investigated in this research. A series of real world driving tests were conducted on a 44 ton articulated truck. A dual fuel tank containing both PD and the C 2 G Ultra Biofuel was installed. The engine was started with PD and then switched to C 2 G Ultra Biofuel gradually. The vehicle was tested on either neat PD or blended fuel mode with different load (empty or fully loaded trailer). The fuel consumption and tailpipe emissions were measured. This paper focused on the fuel consumption and GHG reductions. The fuel consumption was determined by volumetric, mass and energy per km travelled and per ton of GVW. The results show that the fuel consumption for neat PD and blends was at the similar level and has a good inverse linear correlation with GVW. The substitution ratio of PD by the C 2 G Ultra Biofuel is 86 ∼ 91 % and 74 ∼ 81 % for hot start and cold start trips respectively. The GHG reductions by the C 2 G Ultra Biofuel are 85 ∼ 89 % and 73 ∼ 78 % for hot start and cold start trips respectively...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this task is to analyze impure oxide materials exiting from front-end processing prior to storage for <b>feed</b> <b>blending.</b> There are three goals to be accomplished with this task: reduce reblending (currently projected at 7 % with an optimized ordering of the incoming material streams), determine if impure feed prep operations are performing adequately, and reduce plant operating costs by replacing wet prep elemental analyses whether conducted in the immobilization facility or in existing laboratories. An additional potential application is the analysis of blended oxide prior to first-stage UO{sub 2 } and precursor addition...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the effects of a dietary added formaldehyde-propionic acid <b>blend</b> on <b>feed</b> enterobacteria counts and on growing pig performance and fecal formaldehyde excretion. Forty pigs (34. 2 &# 177; 1. 8 kg BW) were used in a randomized complete block design experiment with four treatments, five replications per treatment and two animals per experimental unit (pen). The treatments were: 0. 0, 1. 0, 2. 0, and 3. 0 g of blend kg- 1 of feed. No effects (P> 0. 05) of dietary added blend levels were observed on average daily gain, average daily feed intake and feed:gain ratio during 1 to 14 and 1 to 28 days of experiment. Increasing dietary levels of blend reduced quadratically (P 0. 05) of blend on fecal formaldehyde excretion on the 28 th day of the experimental period. Therefore, the addition of dietary formaldehyde-propionic acid blend up to 3. 0 g kg- 1 of feed reduces the Enterobacteriaceae counts until the 14 th day after feed mixing, without any effects on growing pig performance and fecal formaldehyde excretio...|$|R

The latter {{would result from}} (i) the conventional catalytic cracking for the fossil hydrocarbons leading to well-structured graphitic coke in the USY zeolite micropores, and (ii) the conversion of lignin fragments and other lighter oxygenated compounds (phenolic type) into hydrocarbons, residual oxygenates and finally "bio-coke" which accumulates reversibly in mesopores as less structured coke. These two routes are monitored by the catalysts structure, texture and acidity and are strongly interacting via hydrogen transfer between light hydrocarbons and phenolic type fragments...|$|R
40|$|A new {{technique}} {{for measuring the}} voidage of a packed bed of wet deformable granules is described. Rather than attempt to measure voidage in situ, the voidage is calculated from accurate measurements of bed bulk density and separate measurement of granule apparent density by kerosene displacement. The technique is reproducible to ± 0. 005 void fraction. This technique is used to study in detail the factors which determine the voidage of packed beds of granulated ferrous sinter feed. 10 sinter <b>feed</b> <b>blends</b> are used varying the type of ore (7 ores), feed size distribution and moisture content (3. 5 % to 8 %). As moisture content increases, bed voidage passes through a maximum. At low moisture contents, added water reduces {{the spread of the}} granule size distribution and increases the voidage. At higher moisture contents, granule deformation becomes important. Granules become more deformable as moisture content increases and the bed voidage drops. The key parameter which affects granule deformation is the granule layer mass to nuclei mass ratio (R). All blends show the same relationship between R and voidage. Voidage decreases with increasing R before approaching an asymptotic value for large values of R. The effect of feed particle size distribution, moisture holding capacity and moisture content on voidage can be explained by their effect on the layer mass to nuclei mass ratio during granulation. Hence, {{with the aid of a}} suitable granulation model, the effect of <b>feed</b> <b>blend</b> properties and granulation conditions on bed voidage can be predicted...|$|R
40|$|Caustic {{adjustment}} of the UF recycle stream {{was required to}} prevent gel formation for the solutions tested. Actual amounts of caustic adjustment required will {{vary depending on the}} composition and volume ratios of the UF recycle. The concentration of recycles in the waste feed evaporator as required to <b>blend</b> with waste <b>feed</b> streams to provide a feed to the ultrafiltration process with a supernate specific gravity of 1. 22 is feasible. No problems (such as severe foaming) were noted during the lab-scale testing that would preclude operation of the evaporator. The physical properties of the recycles and waste <b>feed</b> <b>blends</b> fit well to correlations based on sodium concentration and temperature. Evaporation of streams containing high levels of insoluble solids may lead to ''bumping'' or other undesirable behavior in the evaporator at insoluble solids. Sodium alumino-silicate solids were not noted in the evaporator feed or concentrate, but NAS did form in the blends of concentrated recycle and waste feeds. Strontium was found to precipitate during neutralization of the acid cleaning solution and remain precipitated during evaporation. Mercury was found to be significantly soluble in Envelope A simulants and the solubility of mercury increased during evaporation. No mercury was detected in the offgas system after evaporation using Envelope A simulants. Mercury was significantly less soluble in a simulant of AZ- 102. Filtration of the Envelope A waste simulants was affected by the addition of recycle to the process, but the impact was primarily due to an increase in the amount of insoluble solids in the blended stream compared to the waste feed...|$|R
