25|$|They {{were first}} {{developed}} by WACA curator John Maley {{for use in}} the World Series Cricket matches, set up in the 1970s by Australian businessman Kerry Packer. Drop-in pitches became necessary for the World Series as they had to play in dual purpose venues operating outside of the cricket establishment. Along with other revolutions during the series including the white ball, floodlights, helmets, and coloured clothing, drop-in pitches were designed to also make games more interesting. They would start off bowler friendly seaming and spinning with uneven bounce for the first two days of a game. After that they became extremely easy for batting meaning high targets were chaseable on the fourth and fifth days, although there would still <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> the pitch for the bowlers.|$|E
500|$|Alcohol was {{not allowed}} in the Maharishi's ashram, but Mardas smuggled some in from Dehra Dun, and later {{reported}} to Lennon and Harrison that the Maharishi {{had sex with a}} young American student, and had made a sexual advance toward Mia Farrow. This was not supported in Farrow's autobiography What Falls Away (1997), in which she wrote that she may have misinterpreted the supposed sexual advance. Mardas continued to insist the Maharishi was not what he said he was; even making Harrison unsure. Lennon mused in 1970: [...] "Well, it must be true, because if George [...] is doubting him, there must <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> it". Lennon and Harrison confronted the Maharishi, but the startled Maharishi's answers did not satisfy them, and they decided to leave the camp. Mardas insisted that they (Lennon, Harrison and their respective wives) must leave the camp at once, or the Maharishi might send down some [...] "black magic" [...] on them. Mardas then went down to Dehra Dun to organise taxis for the next morning to take them all to Delhi.|$|E
500|$|The {{majority}} {{of what is}} said and depicted in the game is open to interpretation, leading fans to develop and discuss theories {{about the nature of}} the events that occur in the game. Let's Players Voidburger and Bob from the video-game related podcast The Grate Debate opined that the open-ended nature of the game is one of its greatest aspects. They also said that there may <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> the game that has not been discovered yet. They noted the colored lights as something they still had not figured out, and they felt that the game hinted that the radio may be the main culprit behind the father's killing. The game also contained a Swedish line in the radio describing a radio drama from 1938 being true, which gamers suggested may be a nod to Orson Welles's radio adaptation of The War of the Worlds. This possible reference to alien invasions was noted as a continuation of a Silent Hill tradition of having secret endings that included aliens. Another theory commonly discussed is deciphering the identity of the player character. The fetus talking to the player character about his remembering moments [...] "ten months back" [...] seems to imply that he is the father who killed Lisa and the kids, although Voidburger and Bob believe that the player character may be the protagonist that was to be in Silent Hills, as shown in the trailer following the ending of P.T.|$|E

Also receiving the Medal of Honor {{that day was}} fellow Newnan native Stephen W. Pless, a Marine Corps aviator who, like Jackson, had earned the decoration for an airborne rescue operation. Legend states that, upon realizing that both Pless and Jackson were from the same small Georgia town, President Johnson quipped [...] "there must <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> the water down in Newnan." ...|$|E
2500|$|Blair ordered Operation Barras, {{a highly}} {{successful}} SAS/Parachute Regiment strike to rescue hostages from a Sierra Leone rebel group. Historian Andrew Marr {{has argued that the}} success of ground attacks, real and threatened, over air strikes alone was influential on how Blair planned the Iraq War, and that the success of the first three wars Blair fought [...] "played to his sense of himself as a moral war leader". When asked in 2010 if the success of Palliser may have [...] "embolden British politicians" [...] to think of military action as a policy option, General Sir David Richards admitted there [...] "might <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> that".|$|E
2500|$|Waterhouse also {{published}} a {{detailed discussion of}} beliefs expressed in the interviews. She noted that although most people [...] "hold their belief in reincarnation quite lightly" [...] and were unclear {{on the details of}} their ideas, personal experiences such as past-life memories and near-death experiences had influenced most believers, although only a few had direct experience of these phenomena. Waterhouse analyzed the influences of second-hand accounts of reincarnation, writing {{that most of the people}} in the survey had heard other people's accounts of past-lives from regression hypnosis and dreams and found these fascinating, feeling that there [...] "must <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> it" [...] if other people were having such experiences.|$|E

2500|$|The {{film version}} of The Petrified Forest was {{released}} in 1936. Bogart's performance was called [...] "brilliant", [...] "compelling", and [...] "superb." [...] Despite his success in an [...] "A movie," [...] Bogart received a tepid twenty-six-week contract at $550 per week and was typecast as a gangster {{in a series of}} [...] "B movie" [...] crime dramas. Bogart was proud of his success, but the fact that it came from playing a gangster weighed on him. He once said: [...] "I can't get in a mild discussion without turning it into an argument. There must <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> my tone of voice, or this arrogant face—something that antagonizes everybody. Nobody likes me on sight. I suppose that's why I'm cast as the heavy." ...|$|E
2500|$|The first {{scientific}} study of available evidence was conducted by John Napier and published in his book, Bigfoot: The Yeti and Sasquatch in Myth and Reality, in 1973. Napier wrote that if a conclusion is to be reached based on scant extant [...] "'hard' evidence," [...] science must declare [...] "Bigfoot does not exist." [...] However, he {{found it difficult to}} entirely reject thousands of alleged tracks, [...] "scattered over 125,000 square miles" [...] (325,000km²) or to dismiss all [...] "the many hundreds" [...] of eyewitness accounts. Napier concluded, [...] "I am convinced that Sasquatch exists, but whether it is all it is cracked up to be is another matter altogether. There must <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> north-west America that needs explaining, and that something leaves man-like footprints." ...|$|E

"Now, {{people are}} coming back and almost {{adopting}} it as their own anthem, and it's hard, I think, to write an anthem that's not cheesy, and I hope that this could <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> that category. I hope this {{could be one of}} those things where it's like, 'Yeah, I want to put my fist up and feel proud and feel strong. But I also don't want to be cheesy, it's a fine line, and I think 'Firework' ... would be like the opus or my one song — if I had to pick a song to play — 'cause it has a great beat. But it also has a fantastic message. Many people refer to the lines 'like the 4th of July; however the original lyrics were 'like a firefly' as they reminded me of fireworks at night whenever I saw them. However the trend caught on and in live performances I now sing 4th of July, which happens to make great sense for the song name." ...|$|E
