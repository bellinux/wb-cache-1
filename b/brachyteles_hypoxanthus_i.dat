40|$|We provide {{male and}} female census count data, {{age-specific}} survivorship, and female age-specific fertility estimates for populations of seven wild primates that have been continuously monitored for at least 29 years: sifaka (Propithecus verreauxi) in Madagascar; muriqui (<b>Brachyteles</b> <b>hypoxanthus)</b> in Brazil; capuchin (Cebus capucinus) in Costa Rica; baboon (Papio cynocephalus) and blue monkey (Cercopithecus mitis) in Kenya; chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) in Tanzania; and gorilla (Gorilla beringei) in Rwanda. Using one-year age-class intervals, we computed point estimates of age-specific survival for both sexes. In all species, our survival estimates for the dispersing sex are affected by heavy censoring. We also calculated reproductive value, life expectancy, and mortality hazards for females. We used bootstrapping to place confidence intervals on life-table summary metrics (R 0, the net reproductive rate; λ, the population growth rate; and G, the generation time). These data have high potential for reuse; they derive from continuous population monitoring of long-lived organisms and will be invaluable for addressing questions about comparative demography, primate conservation and human evolution...|$|R
40|$|Infant care {{is known}} to impose high {{energetic}} costs on female primates because in addition to lactation, most primate mothers also provide transport for their offspring. Many studies have documented the high energetic costs of lactation, but less is known about energetic costs of infant carrying and their effects on the recovery of maternal physical condition. We compared the activities of female northern muriquis (<b>Brachyteles</b> <b>hypoxanthus</b> Kuhl, 1820) over a 12 -month period at the RPPN Feliciano Miguel Abdala, Minas Gerais, Brazil to investigate whether mothers during their weaning year behaved differently than mothers in their post-weaning year, when they resumed reproductive cycling and copulating, and conceived again. We found {{no significant differences in}} the behavioral activity budgets of mothers in their weaning year (n = 4) versus post-weaning year (n = 5), despite the significantly higher proportion of time that mothers in their weaning year spent in close proximity with their infants and carrying their infants compared to mothers in their post-weaning year. We suggest that the energy budgets of weaning {{are similar to those of}} post-weaning in female northern muriquis. O cuidado parental é conhecido por impor um elevado custo energético às fêmeas primatas, pois, além da lactação, muitas mães primatas também provêm transporte aos filhotes.

40|$|We {{studied the}} diet of the ocelot and puma {{during the years}} 2007 and 2008 at the Feliciano Miguel Abdala Reserve, in Minas Gerais, {{south-eastern}} Brazil. We collected 49 faecal samples (scats) from cats, and identified the species of cat from 23 of them by {{the analysis of the}} microstructure patterns of hairs found in their faeces: 17 scats of the puma (Puma concolor) and six of the ocelot (Leopardus pardalis). In the puma scats, we identified three species of primates (<b>Brachyteles</b> <b>hypoxanthus,</b> Alouatta guariba and Sapajus nigritus), the remains of which were found in eight of 17 collected (47. 1 %), representing 26. 7 % of items consumed. For the ocelot, we detected capuchin monkey (S. nigritus) remains in three of the six scats (50 %), accounting for 18. 7 % of items consumed by ocelot.

Primates were found in five of these 26 faeces (19. 2 %) and represented 10. 2 % of the items found.

The northern muriqui (<b>Brachyteles</b> <b>hypoxanthus)</b> is a critically endangered New World monkey and a flagship species {{for the conservation of}} the Atlantic Forest hotspot. Yet, like other neotropical primates, little is known about its population history and the genetic structure of remnant populations. We analyzed the mitochondrial DNA control region of 152 northern muriquis, or 17. 6 % of the 864 northern muriquis from 8 of the 12 known extant populations and found no evidence of phylogeographic partitions or past population shrinkage/ expansion. Bayesian and classic analyses show that this finding may be attributed to the joint contribution of female-biased dispersal, demographic stability, and a relatively large historic population size. Past population stability is consistent with a central Atlantic Forest Pleistocene refuge. In addition, the best scenario supported by an Approximate Bayesian Computation analysis, significant fixation indices (WST = 0. 49, WCT = 0. 24), and population-specific haplotypes, coupled with the extirpation of intermediate populations, are indicative of a recent geographic structuring of genetic diversity during the Holocene. Genetic diversity is higher in populations living in larger areas (. 2, 000 hectares), but it is remarkably low in the species overall (h = 0. 018). Three populations occurring in protected reserves and one fragmented population inhabiting private lands harbor 22 out of 23 haplotypes, most of which are population-exclusive, and therefore represent patch...|$|R
40|$|The {{northern}} muriqui (<b>Brachyteles</b> <b>hypoxanthus)</b> is endemic to Brazil’s Atlantic Forest, and it {{ranks among the}} most critically endangered primates in the world. Roughly 25 % of the species {{is found in the}} 957 ha forest at the Estação Biológica de Caratinga/RPPN-Feliciano Miguel Abdala, in Minas Gerais, Brazil. The long-term research and conservation efforts at this site have received considerable attention, and public awareness and educational campaigns about {{northern muriqui}}s have been highly effective. Nonetheless, very little about the human dimensions of these efforts have been explicitly described. In this paper, we focus on three distinct, but interconnected dimensions: i) the role of training Brazilian students on the research to build local capacity; ii) the multiple levels of interactions among researchers and different spheres of the local farming community, which have extended over time from the family that owns the farm on which the forest is situated, to the families that work on this farm, to the farmers who live and work in the surrounding community; and iii) the development of partnerships involving national and international nongovernmental organizations and the Brazilian government. We conclude by describing the synergist interactions between each of these human dimensions, which have contributed to both the research and conservation of northern muriquis at this site. We also consider the ways in which some of the specifics of this particular “case study” might be applicable to other species of primates elsewhere...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Sequential {{exchanges of}} vocalizations (staccatos and neighs) emitted by Northern Muriquis <b>Brachyteles</b> arachnoides <b>hypoxanthus</b> were {{recorded}} at the Biological Station of Caratinga, Minas Gerais State, Brazil. Staccatos and neighs containing {{larger proportion of}} short elements were preferentially produced during short-range exchanges; neighs, produced by {{a larger number of}} participants, were typical of long-range exchanges. Staccatos emitted by animals feeding in a dispersed manner contained a larger proportion of tonal elements than those emitted by muriquis feeding in a cohesive manner. Sequential exchanges seem thus to be constituted by two inter-related subsystems of calls that aid muriquis to coordinate intragroup spacing, despite the poor visibility of the habitat...|$|R
40|$|Levels of {{reproductive}} skew vary in wild primates living in multimale groups {{depending on the}} degree to which high-ranking males monopolize access to females. Still, the factors affecting paternity in egalitarian societies remain unexplored. We combine unique behavioral, life history, and genetic data to evaluate the distribution of paternity in the northern muriqui (<b>Brachyteles</b> <b>hypoxanthus),</b> a species known for its affiliative, nonhierarchical relationships. We genotyped 67 individuals (22 infants born over a 3 -y period, their 21 mothers, and all 24 possible sires) at 17 microsatellite marker loci and assigned paternity to all infants. None of the 13 fathers were close maternal relatives of females with which they sired infants, and the most successful male sired a much lower percentage of infants (18 %) than reported for the most successful males in other species. Our findings of inbreeding avoidance and low male reproductive skew are consistent with the muriqui's observed social and sexual behavior, but the long delay (≥ 2. 08 y) between the onset of male sexual behavior and the age at which males first sire young is unexpected. The allocation of paternity implicates individual male life histories and access to maternal kin as key factors influencing variation in paternal—and grandmaternal—fitness. The apparent importance of lifelong maternal investment in coresident sons resonates with other recent examinations of maternal influences on offspring reproduction. This importance also extends the implications of the “grandmother hypothesis” in human evolution to include the possible influence of mothers and other maternal kin on male reproductive success in patrilocal societies...|$|R
40|$|The muriqui (Brachyteles spp.), {{endemic to}} the Atlantic Forest of Brazil, {{is the largest}} primate in South America and is endangered, mainly due to habitat loss. Its {{distribution}} limits are still uncertain {{and need to be}} resolved in order to determine their true conservation status. Species distribution modeling (SDM) has been used to estimate potential species distributions, even when information is incomplete. Here, we developed an environmental suitability model for the two endangered species of muriqui (<b>Brachyteles</b> <b>hypoxanthus</b> and B. arachnoides) using Maxent software. Due to historical absence of muriquis, areas with predicted high habitat suitability yet historically never occupied, were excluded from the predicted historical distribution. Combining that information with the model, it is evident that rivers are potential dispersal barriers for the muriquis. Moreover, although the two species are environmentally separated in a large part of its distribution, there is a potential contact zone where the species apparently do not overlap. This separation might be due to either a physical (i. e., Serra da Mantiqueira mountains) or a biotic barrier (the species exclude one another). Therefore, in addition to environmental characteristics, physical and biotic barriers potentially shaped the limits of the muriqui historical range. Based on these considerations, we proposed the adjustment of their historical distributional limits. Currently only 7. 6 % of the predicted historical distribution of B. hypoxanthus and 12. 9 % of B. arachnoides remains forested and able to sustain viable muriqui populations. In addition to measurement of habitat loss we also identified areas for conservation concern where new muriqui populations might be found...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} how habitat structure affects the home range {{use of a}} group of <b>Brachyteles</b> <b>hypoxanthus</b> in the Brigadeiro State Park, Brazil. It has been reported that most of the annual feeding time of woolly spider monkeys is spent eating leaves, but they prefer fruits when available. We hypothesise that the protein-to-fibre ratio (PF; best descriptor of habitat quality for folivorous primates) is a better descriptor of habitat quality and abundance for these primates than the structural attributes of forests (basal area is the best descriptor of habitat quality for frugivorous primates of Africa and Asia). We evaluated plant community structure, successional status, and PF of leaf samples from the dominant tree populations, both within the core and from a non-core area of the home range of our study group. Forest structure was a combination of stem density and basal area of dominant tree populations. The core area had larger trees, a higher forest basal area, and higher stem density than the non-core area. Mean PF did not differ significantly between these sites, although PF was influenced by differences in tree regeneration guilds. Large-bodied monkeys could be favoured by later successional stages of forests because larger trees and denser stems prevent the need for a higher expenditure of energy for locomotion as a consequence of vertical travel when the crowns of trees are disconnected in early successional forests. Forest structure variables (such as basal area of trees) driven by succession influence woolly spider monkey abundance in a fashion similar to frugivorous monkeys of Asia and Africa, and could explain marked differences in ranging behaviour and home range use by B. hypoxanthus...|$|R

40|$|A investigação científica de atividade biológica de extratos vegetais tem sido uma importante estratégia para a descoberta de produtos naturais com grande aplicação em Pesquisa, Desenvolvimento & Inovação (PD&I). Em um país com megabiodiversidade como o Brasil, esta constatação adquire ainda mais valor. O emprego de estratégias de acesso a biodiversidade se faz importante para selecionar plantas para a prospecção de novos fármacos. Nesse sentido, a abordagem etológica monitorando a dieta de primatas na floresta tem se mostrado bastante eficaz, uma vez que esses mamíferos fazem uso de uma vasta gama de espécies, que muitas vezes não fazem parte do uso cotidiano e científico. Aplicando-se esta abordagem etológica, o presente trabalho teve como objetivo avaliar o potencial antioxidante {{in vitro}} e antimicrobiano, além de análise fitoquímica preliminar e conteúdo fenólico de sete extratos aquosos liofilizados de folhas de plantas usadas na dieta do primata <b>Brachyteles</b> <b>hypoxanthus</b> Kuhl (muriqui-do-norte), a saber: Alchornea glandulosa Poepp. & Endl. (Euphorbiaceae), Miconia latecrenata (DC.) Naudin (Melastomataceae), Ocotea odorifera (Vell.) Rohwer (Lauraceae), Psychotria suterella Müll. Arg. (Rubiaceae), Psychotria vellosiana Benth. (Rubiaceae), Rudgea jasminoides (Cham.) Müll. Arg. (Rubiaceae) e Solanum swartzianum Roem. & Schult (Solanaceae). Dentre estas, três espécies, Alchornea glandulosa, Miconia latecrenata e Ocotea odorifera, foram avaliadas quanto ao potencial antimutagênico e antigenotóxico, por apresentarem maior atividade antioxidante. A prospecção fitoquímica foi avaliada por CCD e o conteúdo fenólico avaliado utilizando-se o reagente de Folin-Ciocalteu. A atividade antioxidante foi avaliada utilizando os testes do radical livre DPPH, co-oxidação &# 946;-caroteno/ácido linoleico e peroxidação lipídica do lipossomo. Para a avaliação antimicrobiana foram utilizadas duas cepas de bactérias gram-positivas de Staphylococcus aureus 3993 e Staphylococcus aureus 4125, além da cepa bacteriana gram-negativa de Escherichia coli 24, todas associadas com mastite bovina. Para os testes antimutagênicos foram utilizadas as cepas TA 97, TA 98, TA 100 e TA 102 de Salmonella tiphymurium/microssoma sem e com ativação metabólica S 9, sendo realizado o método de co-incubação dos extratos com os diferentes padrões mutagênicos para as respectivas cepas. Teste de citotoxicidade com a cepa TA 100 sem ativação S 9 foi realizado a fim de se determinar as doses de extrato utilizadas nos testes de antimutagenicidade. Por fim, o teste antigenotóxico foi realizado utilizando-se o plasmídeo pUC 18 co-incubado com padrão genotóxico e as mesmas doses dos extratos testadas para antimutagenicidade. Dessa forma, pôde-se observar que extratos aquosos de M. latecrenata, A. glandulosa e O. odorifera apresentaram maior conteúdo fenólico. A análise da atividade antioxidante nos três diferentes testes mostrou potencial antioxidante das amostras analisadas, sobretudo para os extratos de M. latecrenata, A. glandulosa, O. odorifera e S. swartzianum. Os resultados mostraram grande potencial antimicrobiano para os extratos de M. latecrenata, A. glandulosa e O. odorifera, sendo que o extrato de M. latecrenata foi o único extrato ativo contra bactéria gram-negativa Escherichia coli 24. Nos testes de citotoxicidade frente a cepa TA 100 de Salmonella typhimurium/microssoma sem metabolização S 9, o extrato de M. latecrenata apresentou maior ação citotóxica, seguido pelos extratos de A. glandulosa e O. odorifera. A maior atividade antimutagênica foi observada para o extrato de M. latecrenata seguido pelos extratos de A. glandulosa e O. odorifera, principalmente frente a cepa TA 102. Observou-se ainda aumento da atividade antimutagênica para a maioria das cepas testadas após a metabolização dos extratos. Não foi observada ação antigenotóxica para nenhum dos extratos testados. Assim, pelo presente estudo foi possível selecionar três extratos com potenciais atividades antimutagênica e bactericida, frente às cepas testadas. The {{scientific}} research of biological activity of plant extracts {{has been an}} important strategy for the discovery of natural products with wide application in Research, Development & Innovation (RD&I). In a country with rich biodiversity such as Brazil, this statement assumes even greater value. The use of strategies for access the biodiversity is important for selecting plants for exploration of new drugs. In this sense, the ethological approach monitoring the diet of primates in the forest has been quite effective, since these mammals make use {{of a wide range of}} species that often are not part of everyday and scientific. Applying this ethological approach, the present study aimed to assess the potential antioxidant in vitro and antimicrobial, as well as preliminary phytochemical analysis and phenolic content of seven freeze-dried aqueous extracts of leaves of plants used in the diet of primate <b>Brachyteles</b> <b>hypoxanthus</b> Kuhl (muriqui-do-norte), as follows: Alchornea glandulosa Poepp. & Endl. (Euphorbiaceae), Miconia latecrenata (DC.) Naudin (Melastomataceae), Ocotea odorifera (Vell.) Rohwer (Lauraceae), Psychotria suterella Müll. Arg. (Rubiaceae), Psychotria vellosiana Benth. (Rubiaceae), Rudgea jasminoides (Cham.) Müll. Arg. (Rubiaceae) and Solanum swartzianum Roem. & Schult (Solanaceae). Among these three species, Alchornea glandulosa, Miconia latecrenata and Ocotea odorifera were evaluated for the potential antimutagenic and antigentoxic, which presented higher antioxidant activity. The phytochemical prospection was assessed by TLC and the phenolic compound was evaluated using the Folin-Ciocalteu reagent. The antioxidant activity was evaluated by testing the free radical DPPH, co-oxidation of &# 946;-carotene/linoleic acid and lipid peroxidation of liposome. It was used two strains of Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus 3993 and Staphylococcus aureus 4125, as well as Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli 24 to assess the antimicrobial activity. For antimutagenic tests the strains used were TA 97, TA 98, TA 100 and TA 102 of Salmonella typhimurium/micrssome with and without S 9 metabolic activation, being carried out the co-incubating method of the extracts with different mutagenic patterns for the respective strains. Cytotoxicity test with the strain TA 100 without S 9 activation was performed in order to determine the dose of extract used in the antimutagenicity tests. Finally, the antigenotoxic test was carried out using the plasmid pUC 18 co-incubated with genotoxic pattern and the same doses of the extracts tested for antimutagenicity. Thus, it was observe aqueous extracts of M. latecrenata, A. glandulosa and O. odorifera showed higher phenolic content. The analysis of antioxidant activity in three different tests showed high antioxidant potential of the samples, especially for the extracts of M. latecrenata, A. glandulosa, O. odorifera and Solanum swartzianum. The results showed strong antimicrobial potencial to the extracts of M. latecrenata, A. glandulosa and O. odorifera, whereas the extract of M. latecrenata extract was the only one active against Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli 24. Considering the tests of cytotoxicity against strain TA 100 of Salmonella typhimurium/micrssome without S 9 metabolism, the extract of M. latecrenata showed higher cytotoxic activity, followed by the extracts of A. glandulosa and O. odorifera. The highest antimutagenic activity was observed for the extract of M. latecrenata followed by the extracts of A. glandulosa and O. odorifera, especially against the strain TA 102. It was also observed increased antimutagenic activity for the most of the strains tested after the metabolization of the extracts. It was not observed antigenotoxic action for any of the extracts tested. Therefore, in the present study was possible to select three extracts with potential antimutagenic and bactericidal activity against the strains tested...|$|R
