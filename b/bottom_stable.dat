40|$|A {{number of}} studies {{in the recent past}} have {{proposed}} a variety of scaling relationships among the penetration depth (Delta(d)) {{at the bottom of a}} convective region, the vertical velocity of the fluid (V-z), and the input flux (F-b). While a relationship of the form Delta(d) proportional to V-z(3 / 2) has been proposed by Schmitt and coworkers on the basis of the equations of motion for buoyant plumes, Zahn proposed a similar relationship based on scaling arguments. The relationships involving Delta(d), V-z, and the input flux are based on recent two-dimensional numerical simulations by Hurlburt and coworkers. All these scalings were recently looked into by Singh, Roxburgh, & Chan, who performed full. three-dimensional simulations of turbulent compressible convection for a stable-unstable-stable sandwich configuration. In the present study, we numerically solve the full set of Navier-Stokes equations in three dimensions in order to study the behavior of convective motions penetrating into the <b>bottom</b> <b>stable</b> layer. We take up a series of models differing in resolution or mesh size and aspect ratio with a view to examine, in greater detail, the scaling relationships between the penetration distance and other flow parameters...|$|E

The very first spike of burst spiking mode is initiated at the lower fold of the surface on a SNIC (green arrow, dashed SNIC line indicates this fold would be invisible if the upper lobe were not transparent). Spiking proceeds {{on the far side}} of the Hopf (magenta curve), in other words, behind it from this perspective. As h_s decreases, the spiking mode terminates spikes through HB bifurcation (magenta arrow). The fast dynamic v trajectory causes the last spike to occur after the trajectory has crossed the HB point. Such “bifurcation delay” or “memory effect” has been reported in many studies (see for example [43 – 45]). The membrane potential remains on a depolarized plateau until sufficient channels accumulate in the o+i pool to reach the upper SN bifurcation (blue arrow) and cause the trajectory to jump to the <b>bottom</b> <b>stable</b> lobe. Note that in this expanded and rotated view in Fig.  5 c, only the SN portion of the LP curve is visible. The trajectory remains quiescent until h_s recovers sufficiently to restart bursting spikes at the SNIC.|$|E
40|$|Diel {{vertical}} migration (DVM) is often assumed to encompass an entire population. However, bimodal nighttime vertical distributions {{have been observed}} in various taxa. Mysid shrimp populations also display this pattern with one group concentrated in the pelagia and the other near the bottom. This may indicate alternative migratory strategies, resembling the seasonal partial migrations seen in birds, fishes and amphibians, where only {{a subset of the}} population migrates. To assess the persistence of these alternative strategies, we analyzed the nitrogen and carbon stable isotope signatures (as proxies for diet), biochemical indices (as proxies for growth condition), and genetic population divergence in the Baltic mysid Mysis salemaai collected at night in the pelagia and close to the <b>bottom.</b> <b>Stable</b> isotope signatures were significantly different between migrants (pelagic samples) and residents (benthic samples), indicating persistent diet differences, with pelagic mysids having a more uniform and carnivorous diet. Sequencing of the mitochondrial cytochrome subunit I (COI) gene showed genetic differentiation attributable to geographic location but not between benthic and pelagic groups. Divergent migration strategies were however supported by significantly lower gene flow between benthic populations indicating that these groups have a lower predisposition for horizontal migrations compared to pelagic ones. Different migration strategies did not convey measurable growth benefits as pelagic and benthic mysids had similar growth condition indices. Thus, the combination of ecological, biochemical and genetic markers indicate that this partial migratio...|$|E

Systematic numerical experiments are performed with an Ekman number of E[*]=[*] 10 − 3, a Prandtl number of P[*]=[*] 1 and an inner/outer radius ratio of η[*]=[*] 0. 4, {{and the existence of}} a strongly stratified upper layer is shown to enhance the generation of equatorial surface retrograde flows when the Rayleigh number is approximately ten times larger than the critical value.

Its effective dynamic condition varies from the free-slip condition to the no-slip condition as the Rayleigh number increases. The Reynolds stress of the convective vortices beneath the stable layer is weakened and is dominated by the transport of the planetary angular momentum.

In order to study the evolution of physical, geochemical, geological and biological phenomena, and to comprehend their possible relationships, a long-term monitoring with the seafloor observatory support is necessary. Unlike mooring approach, the sea bottom observatories represent a more stable platform wherein a wide variety of instrument can be mounted, giving several advantages on power autonomy and higher sampling rate. In addition, the shortest distance to the bottom of observatory instruments, permits to appreciate even phenomena that can happen close to the sea <b>bottom.</b> The <b>stable</b> localisation of all the instruments at the same bottom depth and their accurate unit time reference allow a relatively easier and efficient comparison of different kind of signals recorded in situ, offering a new and interesting possibility to better understand and describe possible benthic processes. Although to collect long-time series often can give some instrumental drifting problems (especially for the electrode sensors or, in shallow environment, due to bigger befouling activity), an efficient instrumental pre and post-calibration, as well as the possibility to collect water samples during the long period of measurements, guarantee to restore the signals recorded during the data processing phases. The versatility of these observatories then offers a good opportunity to investigate, in the same time, different natural fields and with different instrumental approaches.

Ecological traits such as growth, mobility, feeding strategy and temperature tolerance of age- 0 hake were linked with chlorophyll-a fronts, sea bottom current and temperature of the shelf and shelf break to highlight favourable nursery habitats. The results show that hake nurseries require <b>stable</b> <b>bottom</b> temperature (11. 7 - 15. 0 oC), low bottom currents (< 0. 034 m. s- 1) and a frequent occurrence of productive fronts in low chlorophyll-a areas (0. 1 - 0. 9 mg. m- 3) to have a successful recruitment. The prediction explains the relative balance between biotic and abiotic drivers of hake recruitment in the Mediterranean Sea and, in particular, that the low recruitment of 2010 and 2011 was mostly caused by large scale atmospheric forcing.

The excellent exposure in drill core of the Dales Gorge Member of this formation has provided a unique opportunity for studying iron oxide genesis in this relatively undeformed and only slightly metamorphosed iron formation. Sixteen banded iron formation units alternate with seventeen shale units over a thickness of 400 ft in the sequence studied. The author has established a sequence of mineral development for the iron oxide and associated silicate and carbonate minerals based principally upon textures observed in the banded iron formation macrobands.

The ENM was built combining knowledge on biological traits of hake recruits (e. g. growth, settlement, mobility and feeding strategy) with patterns of selected ecological variables (chlorophyll-a fronts and concentration, bottom depth, sea bottom current and temperature) to highlight favourable nursery habitats. The results show that hake nurseries require <b>stable</b> <b>bottom</b> temperature (11. 8 – 15. 0 °C), low bottom currents (< 0. 034 ms− 1) and a frequent occurrence of productive fronts in low chlorophyll-a areas (0. 1 – 0. 9 mgm− 3) to support a successful recruitment. These conditions mostly occur recurrently in outer shelf and shelf break areas. The prediction explains the relative balance between biotic and abiotic drivers of hake recruitment in the Mediterranean Sea and the primary role of unfavourable environmental conditions on low recruitment in specific years (i. e. 2011). The ENM outputs particularly agree spatially with biomass data of recruits, although processes such as fishing and natural mortality are not accounted for. The seasonal mapping of suitable habitats provides information on potential nurseries and recruitment carrying capacity which are relevant for spatial fisheries management of hake in the Mediterranean Sea...|$|R

The minerals {{at the top of the}} illustration (given aside) are first to crystallize and so the temperature gradient can be read to be from high to low with the high temperature minerals being on the top and the low temperature ones on the bottom. Since the surface of the Earth is a low temperature environment compared to the zones of rock formation, the chart also easily shows the stability of minerals with the ones at <b>bottom</b> being most <b>stable</b> and the ones at top being quickest to weather, known as the Goldich dissolution series. This is because minerals are most stable in the conditions closest to those under which they had formed. Put simply, the high temperature minerals, the first ones to crystallize in a mass of magma, are most unstable at the Earth's surface and quickest to weather because the surface is most different from the conditions under which they were created. On the other hand, the low temperature minerals are much more stable because the conditions at the surface are much more similar to the conditions under which they formed.|$|R

The effects of post-annealing in oxygen ambient on the microstructure, surface morphology, surface roughness, and resistivity of the stacks were investigated. It was found that zirconia (ZrO 2), titanium oxide (TiO 2) and silica (SiO 2) interlayers were stable and remained well defined after high temperature annealing. Pt/TiO 2 /ZrO 2 /Si and Pt/TiO 2 /SiO 2 /Si bottom electrode stacks have smooth and continuous surface morphology after annealing at 800 °C for 30 min. These thermally <b>stable</b> <b>bottom</b> electrode stacks have lower resistivity than other stacks which is desirable for improving ferroelectric thin film electric properties.

Because Ti diffusion through Pt can enhance the Pt grain growth, the Pt/Ti/SiO 2 /Si stack has the largest grain size compared with other stacks after being subjected to the same annealing temperature. In the Pt/TiO 2 /Si stack, the surface morphologies change significantly with different annealing temperature, which indicates that using SiO 2 as a barrier layer is essential and this layer cannot be replaced by TiO 2.

Bioinformatic analysis can be used to predict genes and find homologies with known proteins. A model was proposed, in which genes are organized into large clusters and transcribed from only one strand, in the form of large polycistronic primary transcripts. To verify the validity of this model, we studied gene expression at the transcriptional, post-transcriptional and translational levels in a unique locus of 34 kb located on chr 27 and represented by cosmid L 979. Sequence analysis revealed 115 ORFs on either DNA strand. Using computer programs developed for Leishmania genes, only nine of these ORFs, localized on the same strand, were predicted to code for proteins, some of which show homologies with known proteins. Additionally, one pseudogene, was identified. We verified the biological relevance of these predictions. mRNAs from nine predicted genes and proteins from seven were detected. Nuclear run-on analyses confirmed that the top strand is transcribed by RNA polymerase II and suggested that there is no polymerase entry site. Low levels of transcription were detected in regions of the <b>bottom</b> strand and <b>stable</b> transcripts were identified for four ORFs on this strand not predicted to be protein-coding. In conclusion, the transcriptional organization of the Leishmania genome is complex, raising the possibility that computer predictions may not be comprehensive...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Topographic {{parameters}} such as elevation, slope, aspect, and ruggedness play {{an important}} role in malaria transmission in the highland areas. They affect biological systems, such as larval habitats presence and productivity for malaria mosquitoes. This study investigated whether the distribution of local spatial malaria vectors and risk of infection with malaria parasites in the highlands is related to topography. Methods Four villages each measuring 9 Km 2 lying between 1400 - 1700 m above sea level in the western Kenya highlands were categorized into a pair of broad and narrow valley shaped terrain sites. Larval, indoor resting adult malaria vectors and infection surveys were collected originating from the valley bottom and ending at the hilltop on both sides of the valley during the rainy and dry seasons. Data collected at a distance of &# 8804; 500 m from the main river/stream were categorized as valley bottom and those above as uphill. Larval surveys were categorized by habitat location while vectors and infections by house location. Results Overall, broad flat bottomed valleys had a significantly higher number of anopheles larvae/dip in their habitats than in narrow valleys during both the dry (1. 89 versus 0. 89 larvae/dip) and the rainy season (1. 66 versus 0. 89 larvae/dip). Similarly, vector adult densities/house in broad valley villages were higher than those within narrow valley houses during both the dry (0. 64 versus 0. 40) and the rainy season (0. 96 versus 0. 09). Asymptomatic malaria prevalence was significantly higher in participants residing within broad than those in narrow valley villages during the dry (14. 55 % vs. 7. 48 %) and rainy (17. 15 % vs. 1. 20 %) season. Malaria infections were wide spread in broad valley villages during both the dry and rainy season, whereas over 65 % of infections were clustered at the valley bottom in narrow valley villages during both seasons. Conclusion Despite being in the highlands, local areas within low gradient topography characterized by broad valley <b>bottoms</b> have <b>stable</b> and significantly high malaria risk unlike those with steep gradient topography, which exhibit seasonal variations. Topographic parameters could therefore be considered in identification of high-risk malaria foci to help enhance surveillance or targeted control activities in regions where they are most needed...|$|R
40|$|Manihiki Atoll is an {{enclosed}} atoll in the Northern Group of the Cook Islands, South Pacific, with depths in the lagoon up to 70 m. The enclosed {{rim of the}} atoll causes the primary lagoon flushing mechanism {{to be driven by}} the ocean waves rather than tides with one-way wave driven flows in the lagoon. Historically, there have been varying degrees of stratification in the lagoon water column with a higher density, de-oxygenated bottom water layer and a lower density, oxygenated upper layer. The relative thicknesses of these two water layers have varied through time with the depth of transition from low to high density water varying from 20 m to 50 m. Observations in 2016 revealed a stable temperature anomaly near the interface of the dense bottom water and the well mixed lagoon surface waters. The bottom water had a salinity 1 psu and density 1 kg/m 3 greater than the surface water. Warm ocean water entering the lagoon through the wave pumping mechanism was quickly mixed through the upper 50 m of lagoon water while the properties of the <b>bottom</b> water remained <b>stable.</b> Two potential mechanisms for generation of bottom water are proposed: 1) dense pools of ocean water entering the lagoon through wave flushing, and 2) hypersaline water forming through evaporation in shallow ponds around the reef edge.

Living benthic foraminifera specimens collected from contaminated sites in the Venice Lagoon were analysed for trace elements. Both the isotopic and the trace element study involved interpretation of modern live foraminiferal chemical reponses to different enviornments. The isotope analyses of living foraminifera from the North Pacific and the South Australian Bight provide calibration information {{for the evaluation of}} bottom water temperature and circulation of ancient oceans based on fossil foraminiferal geochemistry. Trace elements concentrations of Venice Lagoon foraminifera were used to assess the possibility of using foraminiferal geochemistry as a pollution indicator. Consistent with previous studies,shallow infaunal benthic foraminifera from the Aleutian and Australian argins were depleted in δ 13 C with respect to bottom water dissolved inorganic carbon(DIC),and the deep infaunal foraminifera showed greater difference in values between foraminiferal carbon isotope values and DIC. The deep infaunal,Globobulimina pacifica,had δ 18 O values that were in equilibrium with oxygen isotopic values at equilibrium calcite(δ 18 Occ). Based on a few specimens that were divided in half,there was only minor isotopic heterogeneity in the test composition of benthic foraminifera genus Globobulimina. Differential foraminiferal uptake of Zn as indicated in initial laser ablation analyses showed marked differences between contaminated and less polluted sites in the Venice Lagoon. Higher incorporation of zinc in foraminiferal calcite from the more contaminated site was possibly the result of greater bioavailability of zinc in this environment. Differences also exist between the uptake of other trace metals such as Al,Mg and Mn by different foraminiferal genera. Differences in metal sequestration by benthic foraminifera suggest that the trace metal geochemistry of some foraminiferal taxa may be useful as a pollution indicator.

The Kara Sea data were compared with our results {{on the distribution of}} ostracods in the eastern Laptev Sea. The spatial distribution of recent taxa and the ecological groupings demonstrate a clear relation to dominant environmental factors which range from estuarine to full-marine conditions. Four assemblages related to average summer bottom water salinities were established: (1) a freshwater assemblage from the inner estuaries of the Ob' and Yenisei rivers with salinities less than 2 and from thermokarst lagoons of the southern Laptev Sea coast with strong salinization in winter; (2) a brackishwater assemblage of the outer estuaries of the Ob' and Yenisei rivers with salinities up to 26; (3) a mixed euryhaline–marine assemblage dominated by euryhaline species Paracyprideis pseudopunctillata and Heterocyprideis sorbyana from the inner shelf river-affected zone of the Kara and Laptev seas, where salinities range between 26 and 32; (4) a taxonomically diverse marine assemblage dominated by shallow-water marine taxa from the northern parts of the Kara and Laptev shelves and upper continental slope with <b>stable</b> <b>bottom</b> environments and a salinity higher than 32.

Inner- and mlddle-shelf sites were more similar {{to each other in}} terms of invertebrate species composition than they were to outer-shelf sites, regardless of season. Sites on the inner and outer shelf were grouped according to latitude; however, results suggest that depth is apparently a more important determinant of invertebrate species composition than either season or latitude. Sponges generally dominated dredge and trawl collections in terms of biomass. Generally, cnidarians, bryozoans, and sponges dominated at sites In terms of number of taxa collected. The most abundant smaller macrofauna collected in suction and grab samples were polychaetes, amphipods, and mollusks. Densities of the numerically dominant species changed botb seasonally and bathymetrically, with very few of these species restricted to a specific bathymetrlc zone. The high diversity of invertebrates from hard-bottom sites is attributed to the large number of rare species. No consistent seasonal changes in diversity or number of species were noted for individual stations or depth zones. In addition, H and its components showed no definite patterns related to depth or latitude.

The present study is the first estimation of seagrass sediment carbon sink in the temperate Zostera marina beds in the Baltic Sea. Several descriptors of organic matter characteristics, along with possible organic matter sources in the sediment were compared at vegetated and unvegetated bottoms.

The photopigments and POC concentrations in sediments were higher in vegetated <b>bottoms.</b> The SIAR (<b>Stable</b> Isotopes in R) mixing model based on nitrogen and carbon stable isotope values, indicated that higher percentages of organic matter originated from seagrass production in vegetated sediments (40 – 45 %) compared to unvegetated ones (5 – 21 %).

40|$|The {{process which}} leads to the {{appearance}} of sand banks in shallow seas is investigated by studying the growth of small amplitude perturbations of the sea bottom, forced by oscillatory tidal currents. Since the analysis of field data carried out by Dyer & Huntley (1999) shows that sand banks are likely to occur where the tidal ellipse is circular or characterized by a low ellipticity, attention is focused on small values of sqrt 1 -e^ 2, where e is the ratio between minor and major axes of the tidal ellipse. The linear analysis, which considers perturbations of small (strictly infinitesimal) amplitude, shows the existence of a critical value r_C of the Keulegan-Carpenter number r of the tide (r=U*/(h* omega*), U* and omega* being the amplitude and angular frequency of the velocity oscillations induced by the tide propagation and h* the averaged water depth) such that for r smaller than r_C the flat <b>bottom</b> configuration is <b>stable</b> while for r larger than r_C sand banks start to appear. Close to the critical condition, the wavelength of the most unstable mode turns out to be finite. Then, a weakly nonlinear analysis is developed which allows to evaluate the equilibrium amplitude of the bottom forms when the parameter r is close to its critical value. The configuration of the sea bottom, when the bottom forms attain their equilibrium, is characterized by the presence of long ridges, almost parallel to the main axis of the tidal ellipse, with crest-to-crests distances similar to those observed during field surveys. The crests of the bottom forms turn out to be flat and the extensive shallow waters at the crests are compensated by deep troughs between the ridges...|$|R

Direct correlation of planktonic foraminiferal and calcareous nannofossil zonations results in positioning the NP 9 /NP 10 zonal boundary within the top part of Zone P 6 a. Benthic foraminiferal assemblages in the two areas are diverse and very similar: 92 % of the more abundant species are observed at both s 1 tes. These sites were situated in the deeper parts of a NE-SW trending basin at a paleodepth of 500 - 700 m. The well-known deep-sea benthic extinction (within Zones P 6 a, NP 9) is easily recognized by the sudden disappearance of Gavelinella beccariiformis, Angulogavelinella avnimelechi, Pullenia coryelli and other species within a 50 Kyr. times pan. In contrast to deep ocean sites, simple diversity drops only 17 %, since the abundant shallow-water species in the assemblages are not affected. Post-extinction faunas are dominated by Nuttallides truempyi (up to 29 %). In addition to this species {{a number of other}} species occur which seem to invade the deeper parts of the basin from shallow waters, immediately after the extinction.

40|$|Gully {{formation}} in the Ethiopian Highlands {{has been identified as}} a major source of sediment in water bodies, and results in sever land degradation. Loss of soil from gully erosion lowers crop yields, reduces grazing land availability, {{and is one of the}} major causes of reservoir siltation in the Nile Basin. This study was conducted in the 523 ha of Debre-Mawi watershed south of Bahir Dar, Ethiopia, where gullies are actively forming in the landscape. Historic gully development in a section of the Debre-Mawi watershed was estimated with semi structured farmer interviews, remotely sensed imagery, and estimates of current gully volumes. Gully formation was assessed by instrumenting the gully and surrounding area to measure water table levels and soil physical properties. Gully formation began in the 1980 's following the removal of indigenous vegetation, leading to an increase in surface and subsurface runoff from the hillsides. A comparison of the gully area, estimated from a 0. 58 m resolution quick bird image, with the current gully area mapped with a GPS, indicated that the total eroded area of the gully increased from 0. 65 ha in 2005 to 1. 0 ha in 2007 and 1. 43 ha in 2008. The gully erosion rate between 2007 and 2008 was 530 t ha- 1 yr- 1 in the 17. 4 ha area contributing to the gully, equivalent to over 4 cm soil loss over the contributing area. As a comparison, we also measured rill and inter-rill erosion rates in a nearby section of the watershed, gully erosion rates were approximately 20 times the measured rill and inter rill rates. Depths to the water table measured with piezometers showed that in the actively eroding sections of the gully the water table was above the gully <b>bottom</b> and, in <b>stable</b> gully sections the water table was below the gully bottom during the rainy season. The elevated water table facilitates the slumping of gully walls, which causes widening and up-migration on the hillside...|$|R
40|$|Stratified stable layered mantle {{convection}} in {{a three-dimensional}} (3 -D) spherical shell is investigated {{for a range}} of depth of layer, intrinsic density contrast between the layers (Δρ), and heating mode. Three heating modes are studied: internal heating, bottom heating across core-mantle boundary, and both combined. For each heating mode, layers were investigated centered at depths from 500 km to 2500 km in 500 km steps and with Δρ from 1 to 5 % in 1 % steps. We did not find stable layering for Δρ of 1 %. Cases with no <b>bottom</b> heating were <b>stable</b> with Δρ of 2 %, but Δρ of at least 3 % were required by cases with a component of bottom heating. All cases with Δρ of 4 % or more were stable. We found that the stability of the layer is strongly dependent on the buoyancy ratio B (B = Δρ ÷ ραΔT, where Δρ is the chemical density increase across the boundary, ρ is the density in the upper layer, α is the thermal expansivity and ΔT is the radial temperature difference across the whole system) with a dense layer becoming unstable B ≈ 0. 5. We characterize the height and length scale of the undulations and the area of the interface. Deformations of the interface are largest for cases in which interface is in the midmantle and for cases with small density contrasts. We find that the heating mode does not affect the thermal structure of the layered system, which can be explained with energy balance considerations. The amplitude of the interfacial deformation is found to be unaffected by the heating mode and can be predicted using B. Our results suggest the interfacial thermal boundary layers require large temperature contrasts; therefore the lack of evidence for thermal boundary layers in global seismology studies between 500 and 2500 km depth suggests interfaces at these depths are unlikely...|$|R
40|$|Six {{years of}} {{comprehensive}} data sets collected over the northern continental shelf and upper {{slope of the}} Gulf of Mexico during the LATEX-A and NEGOM-COH programs showed that low-oxygen waters (< 2. 4 mL????L- 1) are found only in spring and summer and only in water depths between 10 and 60 m. Four regions in the northern Gulf show considerable differences in the occurrence of low-oxygen waters. Lowoxygen waters are observed almost exclusively in regions subject to large riverine influences: the Louisiana and Mississippi-Alabama shelves. Hypoxic waters (oxygen concentrations < 1. 4 mL????L- 1) are found only over the Louisiana shelf. No low-oxygen water is found over the Florida shelf which has minimum riverine influence. Lowoxygen water is found at only one station on the Texas shelf; this is during spring when the volume of low-salinity water is at maximum. The distributions of low-salinity water influenced the different distributions of low-oxygen and hypoxic waters in the four regions. Low-oxygen occurrences are clearly related to vertical stratification. Lowoxygen occurred only in stable water columns with maximum Brunt-V????is????l???? frequency (Nmax) greater than 40 cycles????h- 1. When Nmax exceeded 100 cycles????h- 1 in summer over the Louisiana shelf, oxygen concentrations dropped below 1. 4 mL????L- 1, and the bottom waters became hypoxic. Salinity {{is more important than}} temperature in controlling vertical stratification. Locations where temperature influence was larger were found in summer in water depth greater than 20 m over the Louisiana shelf, along the near shore areas of the Mississippi-Alabama shelf west of 87 ????W, and in the inner shelf waters of the Texas shelf. The extent of oxygen removal at the <b>bottom</b> of these <b>stable</b> water columns is reflected in the amount of remineralized silicate. Silicate concentrations are highest closest to the Mississippi River Delta and decrease east and west of the Delta. EOF analyses show that more than 65 % of the oxygen variance is explained by the first mode. The amplitude functions of the first EOF modes of bottom oxygen, water column Brunt- V????is????l???? maxima, and bottom silicate are well correlated, indicating that much of the variance in bottom oxygen is explained by water column stratification and bottom remineralization...|$|R
40|$|How did the Messinian Salinity Crisis end is {{a matter}} of intense debate between two {{opposite}} concepts i. e., the generalised dilution event, the so-called Lago–Mare, followed by the sudden restoration of the marine conditions {{at the base of the}} Zanclean, or the early partial or complete marine refill that would have happened earlier during the upper Messinian. The Chelif Basin of Northwestern Algeria, one of the greatest Messinian marginal basins of the Mediterranean, provides an exceptional opportunity to study in detail how this major paleoenvironmental change occurred through continuous sedimentary records of the Miocene–Pliocene boundary. Five sections representative of both the central and marginal areas of the Chelif basin were analysed in detail for sedimentology, mineralogy, foraminifera and ostracod assemblages, and stable isotope composition of carbonates. The late Messinian deposits exhibit a great lithological variability with predominant clastic deposits (sandstones, siltstones, conglomerates, carbonates) with, in some marginal areas, large slided masses of lower Messinian (Tripoli Unit) that settled just before the base of the Zanclean. Most sediments are either azoic or contain microfossils typical of hyposaline conditions sometimes mixed with benthic foraminifera known to be adapted to stressed environments and even to lacustrine conditions. Fewer types of sediment contain assemblages of planktonic foraminifera, including typical Messinian species, which are thought to be reworked. In contrast, diversified communities of benthic and planktonic foraminifera returned suddenly at the base of the Zanclean; the Messinian–Pliocene transition was marked by an abrupt change of the δ 18 O values of carbonates from variable but predominantly negative values characteristic of low salinity conditions in the upper Messinian to higher and more stable values in the Zanclean typifying marine conditions. The southern margin continued, however, to be submitted to large inputs of continental waters. The beginning of the marine inundation was a transitional period with poorly diversified assemblages of planktonic foraminifera and benthic communities tolerant to oxygen deficient <b>bottom</b> conditions; more <b>stable</b> marine conditions with better bottom water ventilation were set up after a lag time which would roughly correspond to a precession cycle. Except for the more marginal areas where conglomerates and erosional features are observed, the restoration of marine conditions occurred, without any significant erosion in the more central areas where the contact is well marked by strong burrowing activity by benthic organisms. This indicates the rapid substitution in the basin of brackish waters by marine waters. Both mixing of these two kinds of waters and permanence of freshwater inputs in the initial stage of the Pliocene transgression may explain why the community of marine planktonic foraminifera, introduced by the inflowing Atlantic waters, hardly survived in such unfavourable ecological conditions in the Mediterranean and reached a normal development later when more stable marine conditions settled. This study and the comparison with other sections from both marginal and deep Mediterranean basins confirm that the Lago–Mare was a widespread dilution event that affected the whole Mediterranean at the end of the Messinian which was abruptly interrupted by the sudden marine inundation at the base of the Zanclean...|$|R

Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 48 - 52). Capacitive Micromachined Ultrasonic Transducer (CMUT) is a microelectromechanical device that is basically formed by a moving top electrode, a <b>stable</b> <b>bottom</b> electrode and {{a gap in}} between. In spite of its this simple mass-spring construction, CMUT is a nonlinear device and its working principles have been formulated. According to these studies, the top electrode can be {{set in motion by}} the applied pressure on it and by depending on the amount of that pressure, the resonant frequency of the CMUT can be altered. Therefore, it is possible to use CMUT to obtain a pressure sensor. In this respect, {{what we have to do}} is keep tracking of its resonant frequency to deduce the pressure. The most e ective way of doing it, on the other hand, is using an oscillator circuit which also provides us the capability of tracking the resonant frequency in real time. Also, to design an integrated circuit that works with the CMUT, the best way is utilizing a Colpitts oscillator. In this thesis, we design a pressure sensor with CMUT based Colpitts oscillator. In order to achieve our design, rst of all, we examine the small signal equivalent circuit model of an uncollapsed mode CMUT and investigate the related analytical equations that models the behavior of it. To simplify the equations, we liken the small signal equivalent circuit model to a crystal oscillator by making necessary transformations. After that, we investigate the system approach" and resistance concept" methods that help us to analyze the oscillator circuits; and we determine the Colpitts oscillator circuit as the oscillator circuit part of our device. We evaluate the CMUT based Colpitts oscillator circuit and derive the limitations on the circuit parameters for achieving a power e cient device. In addition to that, we discuss the dc biasing of the oscillator circuit that does not cause any loading e ect on the oscillator circuit and design a ring oscillator and a charge pump circuit which help us to obtain bias voltage on the CMUT. Finally, we calculate the sensitivity (in Hz/Pa) and the temperature sensitivity of a CMUT in addition to the Quality factor of our circuit; and by being based on these calculations, we obtain the optimum CMUT parameters for the best available sensitivity and conclude the design. At the end, we design a CMUT based Colpitts oscillator that works as a pressure sensor which measures pressure between zero atm and one atm with sensitivity of 14. 6 Hz/Pa at 1 atm. The selected CMUT parameters, on the other hand, for the radius of the CMUT cell, the gap height of the CMUT cell, the thickness of the insulator layer and the thickness of the top plate are 44 m, 100 nm, 100 nm and 3 m respectively. The Quality factor of the circuit is 5 and the inherent Quality factor of the CMUT is 432. by Hasan Karaca. M. S...|$|R

On H 2 /MgO(001) the sequence p (2 { 604 } 2) [arrow right] p (4 { 604 } 2) [arrow right] p (6 { 604 } 2) is possible and is stable up to 9 K, while on H 2 /LiF(001) the progression p (2 { 604 } 2) [arrow right] p (8 { 604 } 2) [arrow right] p (4 { 604 } 2) is found. These structures are consistent with recent Helium Atom Scattering (HAS) results in terms of coverage and thermal stability, but disagree in terms of symmetry. The HAS work found " c " type structures whereas the MC simulations (without quantum considerations) yield a " p " type structures. The p (2 { 604 } 2) structures contains two H 2 molecules per unit cell, with each molecule lying parallel to the plane of the surface ([straight theta] = 90 { 493 }) directly above every other cationic site. The molecules adopt a "T" configuration with respect to their nearest neighbours. For the p (8 { 604 } 2), p (4 { 604 } 2) and p (6 { 604 } 2) structures, {{there are two kinds of}} adsorption sites: a parallel site, as in the case of p (2 { 604 } 2) structure, and a tilted site, where the H 2 molecules sit between cationic and anionic sites with the molecular axis directed towards the anionic site, with [straight theta] { 598 } 60 { 493 }. To reconcile the results of the simulations and experiments, the quantum mechanical rotational motion of the adsorbed H 2 molecules was studied using perturbation theory. These calculations show that the adsorbed hydrogen molecules are azimuthally delocalized and hence these structures are indeed c -type. For the H 2 /NaCI(001) system, the MC simulations of the bi-layer system show that the formation of a second layer is possible, in which the molecules lie tilted ([straight theta] = 45 { 493 }) at the top of the Cl - sites in a unit cell of p (2 { 604 } 1) symmetry. It also found the molecules in the bottom layer lie flat over the Na + sites and arranged in a unit cell of p (2 { 604 } 1) symmetry, where the molecules adopt a tee configuration along diagonals, and have the same orientation along the rows. In terms of thermal stability, the <b>bottom</b> layer is <b>stable</b> up to 12 K whereas the upper layer is orientationally disordered at T > 5 K and molecules desorb at T > 8 K. These predicted structures are in agreement with the experimental findings in terms of coverage and thermal stability but disagree in terms of symmetry since the PIRS-ATR and HAS experimental findings show a (1 { 604 } 1) structure. To solve this problem, the rotational motion of H 2 molecules has been studied using perturbation theory and it is found that quantum effects will azimuthally delocalize the orientation of the molecular axis of H 2. Thus, those predicted structures become a (1 { 604 } 1) structure...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} an {{extensive}} lithological, petrographical, mineralogical and geochemical description of fresh Collingham Formation core samples collected from borehole SFT 2, {{located on the}} farm Slangfontein, south of Jansenville in the Eastern Cape, South Africa. The borehole, drilled to 295 m on the northerly limb of a shallow westerly plunging syncline, intersected the lower Ecca Group rocks of the Ripon, Collingham, Whitehill and Prince Albert Formations and terminated in the upper Dwyka Group. A comprehensive log and stratigraphic column were compiled for the Collingham Formation and fresh core samples were analysed using X-Ray Diffraction (“XRD”), X-Ray Fluorescence (“XRF”), mercury porosimetry, and Total Organic Carbon (“TOC”). Thin section microscopy and Scanning Electron Microscopy (“SEM”) analyses were carried out on selected samples of core from borehole SFT 2. The matrix supported, massive to laminated lithological units of the Collingham Formation are interpreted as detrital, terrigenous sediments. These sediments are composed of intercalated fine-grained, poorly sorted, non-fissile mudstone; fine- to very fine-grained, predominantly pyroclastic airfall tephra; and less common fine-grained sandstones. Sediments of the Collingham Formation {{are considered to be}} immature, composed primarily of clay and aluminosilicates. The predominance of a clay fraction and aluminosilicates in mudstone samples is indicated by elevated K 2 O/Al 2 O 3 ratio values, and the relationship of Zr, Al 2 O 3 and TiO 2. The presence of glauconite within the Collingham Formation indicates deposition in a mildly alkaline, slightly reducing marine environment. Rb/K ratio values (1. 9 – 2. 3 x 10 - 3) indicate brackish to slightly marine conditions, while low Zr/Rb ratio values indicate a low hydro-energy environment, with <b>stable</b> <b>bottom</b> water conditions. Hf and Nb concentrations indicate that detrital input was greatest during the deposition of tuffaceous units; while stable mineral assemblages and a low Fe 2 O 3 /K 2 O ratio values indicate deposition close to the source. A variation in Si/Ca values indicate times when sediments were affected by turbidity, interspersed with times of relative quiescence. The predominance of K 2 O over Na 2 O indicates that the Collingham Formation is alkali-rich, while SiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 ratio values and the relationship of Zr, Al 2 O 3 and TiO 2 indicate that sediments are immature. In the lower portion of the formation, non-sulphidic, anoxic conditions are indicated by Mn/Al, V/(V+Ni), V/Cr ratio values, the Fe-Mn- V content, and the correlation between V and TOC. The upper portion of the formation is considered dysoxic, due to the presence and distribution of pyrite framboids, which indicate a fluctuating O 2 level, likely indicating deposition at the interface between anoxic and slightly more oxic conditions. V/Cr ratio values indicate that the O 2 regime was lowest during the deposition of the mudstones. The Chemical Index of Alteration (“CIA”) indicates a consistent weathering regime throughout the deposition of the Collingham Formation, associated with a temperate climate on the interface between glacial and tropical conditions. Although an anoxic and low hydro-energy environment is generally favourable for hydrocarbon accumulation, the Collingham Formation contains low levels of Total Organic Carbon (well below 0. 9 per cent) and low porosities (ranging from 0. 35 per cent to a maximum of 2. 22 per cent), both of which are characteristic of a poor source for gas accumulation. Due to the laminate nature, permeability and fracturability of the Collingham Formation, there is the potential that the formation may form a good sealing sequence to the potentially gas-rich Whitehill Formation below. The metamorphic impact related to the Cape Orogeny (± 250 Ma), and reflected in the textures of the minerals making up the sediments of the Collingham Formation, suggests the enhancement in the sealing efficiency of this formation...|$|R
40|$|Sediment {{biogeochemistry}} was {{studied in}} Macquarie Harbour, {{which is located}} on the west coast of Tasmania, Australia. Rates of respiration and fluxes of nutrients, which are either released or taken up during mineralisation of organic matter, were investigated at a series of harbour wide sites and at sites under and adjacent to fish farms. Environmental characteristics of the sediments and overlying water column were also measured to examine their role in determining sediment biogeochemistry of the harbour. The {{purpose of this study was}} to understand benthic mineralisation and nutrient cycling, particularly nitrogen cycling, in Macquarie Harbour and the environmental controls of these processes. This study also assessed the influence of organic loading from fish farming activities on sediment biogeochemistry. Sediments cores were collected from nine sites across the harbour in November 2012; these sites were located well outside the influence of benthic enrichment from fish farms. Sediments were also collected from nine other sites to examine the influence of organic enrichment from fish farming; six sites were located directly under the outer edge of fish cages and three sites 50 m from the edge of the cages. To investigate the influence of farm management practices, the cages, 50 m from cage and a subset of the control sites were sampled again in January, May and September 2013. The harbour wide study showed that the sediments in Macquarie Harbour contained mainly terrestrial sourced organic matter based on its depleted carbon signatures. Characterisation of the organic matter also showed gradients commonly observed in estuaries where the isotopic signatures of carbon and nitrogen increased and the percentage of total organic carbon and total nitrogen contents generally decreased from the upper towards the lower estuary. Oxygen consumption and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) production rates suggest that aerobic respiration were the dominant respiration pathway except at a few sites where anaerobic respiration were prevalent. The uptake of nitrate from the water column for denitrification at the majority of sites suggest that uncoupled nitrification-denitrification was an important anaerobic pathway in the harbour. The release of ammonium at most of the sites further suggest that nitrification in the sediments were limited, most likely due to low oxygen penetration of sediments. Multiple regression of individual fluxes shows that oxygen was a clear controlling factor for benthic mineralisation and nutrient cycling in Macquarie Harbour. The influence of fish farming on the benthic processes was clearly evident. Oxygen consumption was six times higher at cage sites compared to the control sites. While oxygen consumptions at 50 m from the cage sites were often elevated compared to the control sites, the rates were not significantly higher. The high DIC/O 2 consumption ratio, especially at the cage sites, indicates that the main degradation pathway was through anaerobic respiration. The presence of a white filamentous mat on the sediments taken from the fish cages observed during the experiment highlight the likely role of anaerobic sulfate reduction. Ammonium fluxes from sediments into the water column were also significantly higher at the fish cages and conversely, nitrate uptake from the water column were higher at cage sites. This is consistent with a reduction in sediment nitrification due to increased bacterial respiration and low oxygen concentrations and a greater dependence on nitrate from the water column for denitrification (i. e. uncoupled nitrification-denitrification). There was also evidence that some of the nitrate is reduced to ammonium via dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA). The release of phosphate from the sediments occurred at the cage and 50 m sites, in contrast to phosphate uptake at control sites. Despite the observed higher ammonium release from farm enriched sediments, there has been no significant change in bottom water ammonium concentrations during the period of significant industry expansion based on data from the monthly water quality monitoring program. This suggests that more broadly across the harbour, nitrification in the water column and sediment denitrification may be buffering the system against the increased loads. This remains to be tested. Based on the flux rates, there was no clear indication that there was any temporal changes in Macquarie Harbour. This may reflect relatively <b>stable</b> <b>bottom</b> water conditions throughout the year more broadly in the harbour. Sediment conditions showed improvement at some of the cage sites during fallowing. However, the sediment response to fallowing at some areas was not as expected. In one of the leases, benthic flux rates did not show signs of recovery during fallowing (i. e. lower benthic respiration rates, lower nutrient flux rates), and conversely, during stocking the flux rates declined instead. This suggest that other factors are likely to be responsible for organic loading and mineralisation of organic matter. This study is the first assessment of benthic nutrient cycling in Macquarie Harbour sediments. Importantly it describes sediment function more broadly in the harbour and in response to organic enrichment due to fish farming. The more recalcitrant organic matter brought in by the rivers has kept the background oxygen consumption and nutrient levels low. Despite low oxygen consumption, bottom water oxygen concentrations are naturally low due to the long residence times and reduced mixing with surface waters. Sediment nitrification appears to be reduced as a result, with sediment denitrification relying on nitrate sourced from the water column. Lastly, considering that oxygen concentration is an important driver of sediment function in Macquarie Harbour, the recently observed decline in bottom water dissolved oxygen concentration and its implication for nutrient cycling warrants attention...|$|R
40|$|In the Eurasian Arctic, the {{archipelago}} of Severnaya Zemlya is the easternmost {{one which is}} covered by considerable ice caps. This gives {{the opportunity to get}} regional paleo-climate information from ice core records. In 1986 / 87 the first ice core was drilled on Akademii Nauk ice cap, the northernmost one on Severnaya Zemlya (Savatyugin and Zagorodnov (1988), Klement'yev et al. (1991)). This core was analyzed with relatively low data resolution. A chronology was published by Klement'yev et al. (1988 and 1991) and Kotlyakov et al. (1990). These authors claimed a Late Pleistocene bottom age for this core. From 1999 to 2001 a new 724 m long ice core was drilled on Akademii Nauk to proof the maximum resolution possible to be obtained and to check the time-scale published so far for this glacier (Savatyugin et al. (2001), Fritzsche et al. (2002)). This project was carried out in co-operation between the Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI), Germany, the Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute (AARI) St. Petersburg and the Mining Institute St. Petersburg, Russia. The knowledge of annual layer thickness is the basis for the chronology of the core. One of the main problems is that infiltration processes caused by melting and even rain during summer time will smooth or destroy seasonal signals. The variation of stable isotopes of water (dD and d 18 O) is the most common tool to reconstruct the annual layer thickness also in areas with percolation as Pohjola et al. (2002) have demonstrated but sometimes oscillations in D-excess values better resolve the annual variation (Stichler et al. (1979)). We used D-excess and d 18 O for determination of layer thickness. A recent mean accumulation rate of about 460 kgm- 2 a- 1 was found at the drilling site close to the summit of Akademii Nauk using horizons with increased 137 Cs radioactivity as time markers. Pinglot et al. (2003) have found two such peaks coursed by nuclear weapon tests in the beginning of 1960 s and by the accident of Chernobyl nuclear power station in 1986. Zagorodnov et al. (1990) reported the same value of 460 kgm- 2 a- 1 as mean accumulation rate of two years of observation (1986 / 87) in the area of station 'Mir' at summit on the Akademii Nauk ice cap. The data of electrical conductivity, d 18 O and melting content are published by Fritzsche et al. (2005) in high resolution for the upper 136 m of the new drilled ice core. These data cover about 275 years following the preliminary dating basing on counting of annual variations of D-excess and d 18 O supported by peaks in the electrical conductivity signal, assumed to be produced by historical volcano eruptions. The highest peak in electrical conductivity was found in a depth of 25. 79 - 25. 94 m connected with huge increased nss SO 4 - 2 content observed by ion chromatographic analyses of the dissolvable constituents. This indicates that this horizon was influenced by a volcano event most likely the eruption of Bezimyanny in 1956. Weiler et al. (2005) confirmed the recent mean accumulation rate by core chemistry studies. The annual layer thickness is decreasing with depth because of thinning under the pressure of the upper layering ice. An annual layer thickness of approx. 11 cm could be observed close to the <b>bottom</b> using <b>stable</b> isotope variations. We have calculated a basal age of approx. 2500 years for the Akademii Nauk ice cap interpolating the annual layer thickness between {{the upper part of the}} core studied in detail and the range close to the bottom were data are available in high resolution. Counting of electrical conductivity cycles results in a bottom age of 2650 years. In this calculation we assume that annual layers were never eroded by melting. This age and the annual layer thickness we found can be explained only giving up an equilibration assumption for the Akademii Nauk ice cap at least for the past. That means we assume that the glacier was growing up to its today's altitude from an initial stage almost at sea level. This has to be considered for paleo-climate interpretation of d 18 O data. Fig. 1. Comparison between d 18 O records from Academii Nauk ice cap (30 years running mean), Hans Tausen ice cap (North Greenland) and GRIP (summit of Central Greenland). For Akademii Nauk the data are corrected assuming an altitude effect coursed by a growing of the ice capThe oxygen isotope data of the Akademii Nauk ice core drilled in 1999 / 2001 are shown in Fig. 1 using our preliminary chronology. The d 18 O values had been corrected assuming a continuous growing of the ice cap and an altitude effect of 4 per mil/ 100 m. The data show the trend of temperature of the last 2500 years on Akademii Nauk ice cap. They are indicating a relatively warm period about 2300 - 2400 years BP followed by a relatively long lasting colder time span with minima at about 300 AD and 1800. The little ice age couldn't be found as a characteristically drop down in temperature but a dramatically warming was observed since app. 1800. Kotlyakov et al. (2004) found this warming for the same period in surface temperatures reconstructed from temperature depth profile of the drill on Akademii Nauk in 1986 / 87. Since 1875 the warming is documented in meteorological data for the whole Eurasian Arctic. Similarities like this warming were found in d 18 O values from Hans Tausen ice cap (North Greenland) and Akademii Nauk (Fig. 1) which could not be observed in the record from Central Greenland (GRIP). It makes clear that summit of the Greenland ice cap has special climate conditions which not necessarily reflect climate changes in the maritime Arctic at least in Late Holocene. Such changes seem to be stronger in lower altitude and smaller size of the ice cap. The drilling project was funded by the German Ministry of Education and Research (03 PL 027 A/ 3).

40|$|Concentrated {{suspensions}} of detergent powder solids in {{a liquid}} nonionic surfactant are considered for practical application as liquid detergent products. If no precautions are taken, upon storage the viscosity of such suspensions increases and the pourability drops because the suspensions are colloidally unstable. It {{has been found}} that after the addition of a small amount of dodecylbenzene sulphonic acid (DoBS-acid or HDoBS) good pourability is maintained on storage. All the phenomena observed with such suspensions suggest that the addition of DoBS-acid reduces coagulation and improves colloidal stability. It was hypothesized that the colloidal stability obtained is of an electrostatic nature. In a liquid non-aqueous medium this is unexpected. A study of the mechanism of stabilization is described in this thesis. After a general introduction to the topic in Chapter 1, in Chapter 2 we discuss the character of the interactions which play a role in nonionic suspensions. The used nonionics are condensates of long chain alcohols and 3 to 9 alkylene oxide units. The dispersed solids are sodium salts as are usually present in current detergent powders, or oxides. They are aggregates or agglomerates of smaller crystalline primary particles and consist of irregular spheroids. The solids, the liquid nonionics and the anionic acid have been characterized with respect to a number of properties, including the molecular and crystalline structure, specific density, specific surface area, porosity, axial ratio and water content. The refractive indices and dielectric constants of the liquids and solids are also measured. Elemental analysis of the supernatants of our suspensions is carried out by Atomic Absorption, by Plasma Emission and by X-ray Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Since analysis of the supernatants indicated only very limited dissolution of the solids, it is concluded that the suspensions are lyophobic. It is demonstrated that, when DoBS- acid is added to a suspension of sodium salts in nonionic, it is converted quantitatively into anionic NaDoBS. Sedimentation rates, sediment volumes and viscosities are important physical characteristics of concentrated nonionic suspensions; they reflect the interactions between the suspended particles. The interactions follow the DLVO-theory, meaning that they are governed by the balance between attractive and repulsive or 'stabilizing' forces. The literature on van der Waals attraction (energy and forces) between particles in suspension is discussed in Chapter 3. It shows that for particles in the micron-size range, geometrical parameters (differences in particle size, interparticle distance), retardation and surface roughness are of more importance than in colloidal systems, having smaller particles. This means that the van der Waals bonding energy obtained on approach is larger, but, as a function of increasing interparticle distances, it decays more rapidly. In the van der Waals attraction, material properties are reflected in the Hamaker constant. Hamaker constants for the inorganic crystalline solids considered in this study are not available in the literature. Therefore it was necessary to evaluate them theoretically. Two approaches have been applied, a macroscopic theory and a microscopic theory. In a comparison they gave identical results within a few tens of percent. For the crystalline detergent solids the constants have been evaluated from their dielectric constants and refractive indices. The results showed the Hamaker constants for the detergent solids (except activated Zeolite 4 A) to exceed those of the nonionics, but to be lower than those of the metal oxides. The differences between the constants of crystalline detergent solids and those of nonionics are relatively small, implying that suspensions of detergent solid particles in nonionics can be made to relatively high volume fractions and can be stabilized easily. In Chapter 4 the electrostatic theory for interactions of particle pairs in suspension is evaluated for its applicability in non-aqueous media, using models of plates and spheres. For both models the conclusion is that, for the calculation of the repulsive energies and forces, approximated equations can be used. They result in repulsive energies, pressures and forces, which are in good agreement with those of exact computations at distances> 10 nm, but underestimate the repulsions at shorter distances. DLVO energy and force curves have been constructed and demonstrate the dependence of the repulsion on five parameters that govern the behaviour, viz. the dielectric constant, the ionic strength, the electric surface potential, the Hamaker constant and the particle size. For our suspensions with surface potentials ≥ 20 mV, significant repulsions already develop at distances between 2 and 40 nm. The theoretical repulsions are much higher than the van der Waals attractions and cause much larger repulsive barriers than those usually reported for non- polar, nonaqueous media. They are expected {{to play a role in}} the colloidal stabilization of nonionic suspensions and to influence the resistance against coagulation under pressures at the bottom of sediments. Secondary minima are only a few kT at most and coagulation is only expected at the protrusion points of contact and at relatively high ionic strengths. Ionic strengths in HDoBS-stabilized suspensions in the nonionics Plurafac LFRA 30 and Imbentin C 91 / 35 are evaluated from the conductivity in the supernatants and from their respective limiting molar conductivities. The methodology is described in Chapter 5. It was found that in both nonionics the limiting molar conductivity was lower than predicted from the values in water assuming Walden's rule applies. The results indicate that solvation interactions of Na +and DoBS -ions in nonionics are stronger than in water and stronger in Imbentin than in Plurafac. In Chapter 6 the results of the electric and dielectric measurements have been given. It is shown that the dielectric constant of nonionic is increased by HDoBS. Taking this increase into account, the ionic strengths found can be satisfactorily explained from theory. Only at high HDoBS concentration and relatively high dielectric constants are the ion concentrations lower than theoretically predicted, a feature that could be due to the formation of 'molecular associates'. From the limiting conductivities, at HDoBS concentrations between 10 and 150 mM, the ionic strengths have been found to range from 0. 05 to 4 mM in Plurafac and from 0. 08 to 30 mM in Imbentin. These results demonstrate a weak dissociation of the NaDoBS electrolyte. However, the ionic strengths obtained are considerably larger than those in supernatants of unstable suspensions and are higher than ever reported in the 'non-polar' hydrocarbon media, commonly considered in non-aqueous studies. Liquid nonionic media have a dielectric constant between 5 and 12 and are denoted 'low-polar'. At these ionic strengths, and considering the enhancement of the dielectric constant by HDoBS, in the HDoBS concentration regime between 0. 5 and 150 mM, Debye lengths range from 33 to I nm in Plurafac and from 13 to 1 nm in Imbentin, i. e. in the same range as in aqueous media. Electrokinetic (ζ-) potentials of particles of detergent solids suspended in nonionics, given in Chapter 6, are found to be a function of the HDoBS concentration. The surface potentials tend to level off at HDoBS concentrations as low as 0. 5 % w/w (15 mM dm - 3 ), to a maximum value ranging from + 25 to + 70 mV, depending on the nature of the solid and the nonionic liquid. Addition of water or of a crown-complexant (15 -Crown- 5), reduces the ζ-potential. The formation of positive surface charges can be explained from the dissociation of adsorbed HDoBS. Mechanical properties of concentrated non-aqueous suspensions are discussed in Chapter 7, including their relation to the electrostatic repulsion. Rheology is used to monitor the properties under dynamic conditions. The consistency, which quantifies the particle interactions and shear thinning index was derived from the Sisko model. Addition of HDoBS was found to have little or no influence on the high shear rate viscosity of nonionic suspensions. This viscosity is governed by hydrodynamic interactions, which are, in turn, determined by the viscosity of the nonionic phase, the volume fraction and the temperature. The nature of the solid also has an influence on the 'infinite shear' viscosity, probably due to variations in protrusion size, causing their effective volumes to be larger than the actual volume. Measurements of the intrinsic viscosity of sodium tripolyphosphate (STP) indicated that the particles of this substance are almost spherical. Low shear rate viscosities monitor effects of interparticle interactions. The consistency was found to be inversely proportional to the particle volume. Addition of HDoBS reduces the consistency. As with the ~-potentials, the main effect is already obtained from 0. 5 % w/w HDoBS. In this respect the behaviour of the viscosity is correlated with that of the ~-potential of the particles. It is further found that the drop in the 'normalized' consistency has a direct relation to the electrostatic force. These results support the conclusion that the nature of the obtained stabilization is electrostatic. The correlation of the viscosity with the Péclet number further supports this conclusion. It shows that under shear HDoBS-stabilized systems can be considered as hard-sphere suspensions. Creep compliance measurements of suspensions of STP in Plurafac at high volume fractions demonstrated that at low shear stresses the interactions are completely elastic. Under those conditions, relaxation of the stress leads to almost complete recovery. The shear moduli derived from creep compliance, drop less steeply as a function of the volume fraction than predicted from the electrostatic repulsive barrier. It is possible that this difference is a result of secondary minimum coagulation by the particle protrusions. In static sediments the volume fractions can be measured as a function of height by γ-ray absorption. Measurements of γ-ray absorption shows that the particle concentration from top to <b>bottom</b> in a <b>stable</b> sediment shows a concentration gradient. For HDoBS-stabilized suspensions this gradient is more continuous, whereas in unstable suspensions, due to coagulation, it is very irregular. From these results the relations between the static pressure or the network modulus and the volume fraction are derived. Pressures show an exponential relation with the interparticle distances. With low levels of DoBS-acid the interparticle distances are larger than for high concentrations of HDoBS. These results are in agreement with the dependency predicted by electrostatic repulsion, although the experimental pressure drop as a function of distance is much smoother than that theoretically predicted. The experimental network moduli derived from the pressure-volume fraction relation also drop much more slowly than theoretically predicted. This may again be a result of secondary minimum coagulation occurring by the protrusions. The overall conclusion is that the suspensions under consideration are electrostatically stabilized with DoBS-acid as the charge-determining electrolyte...|$|R
40|$|Along {{the coast}} of St. Martin, St. Eustatius and Saba the rocks above sea-level often show a number of {{differently}} coloured zones. This is clearly visible when the coast over a larger distance is formed by one type of rock, as for instance on Saba. In many places a light-coloured belt is seen above the zone with algal growth; still higher the rocks are dark-coloured (Fig. 11, 17 and 22). The uppermost part of the light-coloured zone indicates rather exactly {{the height of the}} waves at low tide (splash zone). The darkcoloured zone is wet from finely dispersed water (spray zone). Sometimes differently coloured zones are formed (Fig. 13) which may, however, be correlated with the above mentioned ones on account of their organisms. Below the algal zone on open coasts hardly any other zones can be discerned, since the various communities of plants and animals form here a mosaic-like pattern. On rocky bottoms in the sublittoral region next to the lithophilous algae many corals are present. When the rocks are covered with a thin layer of sand, a rich fauna of Gorgonids may be present; when this layer becomes thicker, the horny corals are replaced by seagrasses and psammophilous algae. From our data the following facts about the rocky coasts, from the supralittoral margin to the uppermost part of the sublittoral region, are obvious. A zonation for molluscs is distinctly visible. Tectarius tuberculatus and Littorina ziczac are found in the spray zone, which is usually recognizable by a dark colour, caused by microscopic bluegreen algae. The rocks in this zone as a rule are almost dry. Chitons are usually present at a somewhat lower level, in places which are constantly washed by the waves; generally they indicate the upper limit of the waves at low tide (e. g. Figs. 17 and 21). They are mostly found in a lightcoloured zone. In places where the rocks are not exposed to the sun, Chitons may occur at much higher levels than is normally the case, when, however, the rocks are scoured by sand they are scarce or absent. Nerita tessellata is common among the Chitons, but may also be found at a lower level among the highest algae. Under overhanging rocks, and also in other places without direct sunlight a characteristic algal vegetation is found, mainly consisting of Bostrychia-species and Polysiphonia howei; the Bostrychias at a somewhat higher level than Polysiphonia. Protected by overhanging rocks and reached by the waves at high tide Bostrychia tenella may form a continuous zone at about 10 — 20 cm above the water level, with Polysiphonia howei immediately below (Great Bay; Fig. 17). In some cases, however, the Bostrychias may be absent (Little Bay near Kay Bay Hill, and near Fort Amsterdam). Other species with a comparable life form may also be found at a high level in shady places, for instance Lophosiphonia cristata (Little Bay) or Loposiphonia spec. of which very large patches were found on St. Eustatius. Next to these species hardly any algal growth is observed in the littoral region of St. Martin, St. Eustatius and Saba: the high air temperatures and the strong sunshine cause a desiccation of all organisms in the tidal zone. Moreover, because of the oscillations of the mean sea-level during the year, the mortality of the highest algal growth may be considerable. In the zone, which is also washed by the waves at low tide, a moss-like algal vegetation may be found, with many intermingled species, such as: Polysiphonia ferulacea, Lophosiphonia cristata, Jania adhaerens, Cladophoropsis membranacea, Cladophora fuliginosa, Centroceras clavulatum, Valonia ocellata, Dilophus alternans, D. guineensis, Hypnea musciformis, H. spinella, Spyridia aculeata, Laurencia intricata, L. papillosa, L. microcladia, L. gemmifera, Caulerpa racemosa, Dictyosphaeria cavernosa, Dictyota spp., Padina sanctae-crucis, P. gymnospora, P. vickersiae, Grateloupia cuneifolia, G. filicina, Pocockiella variegata, Ulva fasciata, Gelidiella acerosa, Amphiroa fragilissima, Sargassum Stichothamnion antillarum, Pterocladia pinnata, spp., and Wrangelia argus. Combination of species may vary from place to place. On flat rocks, for instance beachrock plates, such species as Polysiphonia ferulacea, Lophosiphonia cristata, Jania adhaerens, Centroceras clavulatum may be predominant. On protruding rocks, as for instance coral limestone, Laurencia papillosa and also Padina sanctae-crucis may be abundantly present. This moss-like algal growth may be found in many places along {{the coast of}} the islands, particularly in places with strong wave-action. When the boulders rest in a sandy bottom and much sand is carried by the waves, in several places on the coast of St. Martin a vegetation has developed, consisting of Chondria tenuissima and Digenea simplex, together with a number of species partly mentioned already when describing the moss-like algal vegetation, for instance Padina sanctae-crucis, P. vickersiae, Bryothamnion triquetrum, Laurencia microcladia, L. papillosa, L. poitei, Polysiphonia ferulacea, and Sargassum spp. A clear distinction cannot be made between these two algal vegetations which grow about the same level, as the amount of sand carried by the waves varies from place to place. A number of algal species is very sensitive to the scouring sand: Pocockiella variegata and crustforming Lithothamnia are for instance absent in these places. A number of the algae present under these circumstances has adapted itself to this special habitat, for instance in developing long trichoblasts, which provide extra protection to the growing tips. In a few places a distinct zonation of the brown algae is observed, e. g. in Little Bay off Kay Bay Hill. Here zones are present of respectively Turbinaria turbinata (in the deeper water), Sargassum spec. and Padina sanctae-crucis (in the highest places). These species are found on horizontal or gently sloping places. Other kinds of algae, e. g. Laurencia papillosa and L. microcladia are mostly found on vertical rocks, together with Pocockiella and the crustlike Lithothamnia, which form together a mosaic, nearly completely covering the rock. Apparently the slope of the rock surface determines the establishment of these species. Our observations confirm that Turbinaria and Sargassum prefer exposed places, and Padina less exposed habitats. In many places crustlike Lithothamnia are numerous. On open coasts they may cover almost the entire rock surface below water level. Under overhanging rocks they may be found as high as the Chitons. In exposed places they form rock-covering mosaics together with Pocockiella; in protected places Lithothamnia are predominant; both species are absent in the proximity of corals. A zone of barnacles was observed in a few places. In most cases they are found on the flat upper side of rocks, together with Chitons and the highest algae. Echinometra lucunter is abundant in the zone of the highest algae, but may also occur at a lower level, to a depth of about 50 cm. In deeper water other species of sea urchins are found, e. g. Diadema antillarum, generally in large numbers, both on sandy and on rocky bottoms, and Lytechinus variegatus, mostly solitary in seagrass vegetations. The richest algal vegetation is found on moderately exposed coasts. When the swell is heavy, it tends to impoverish the flora, and the plants become short and compactly built, but even then they may become detached. In quiet water which is insufficiently renewed, the vegetation may be poorly developed too (cf. Guana Bay versus Baie de la Grande Case). In {{spite of the fact that}} the significance of the subsoil for marine organisms is fundamentally different from that for land-plant life, the type of rock may still be of influence on the algal vegetation: the possibilities for attachment may be different; niches or small rock pools may offer special habitat conditions. On smooth doleritic rocks in Great Bay near Fort Amsterdam, the algal vegetation for nine-tenths consists of Chaetomorpha media. Normally this species is firmly attached with a branched system of rhizoids, which is much less the case on smooth doleritic boulders where other algae are almost absent. The rocks of the Point Blanche formation also offer special conditions for attachment (Little Bay off Kay Bay Hill). When niches are formed, as for instance in coral limestone or the limestone cliffs of the Low Lands formation, favourable conditions are offered for sciophilous algae, such as Bostrychia and Polysiphonia howei. In tropical countries the difference in water absorption between porous course-crystalline rocks and fine-crystalline rocks is less reflected in the level in which the algal zones of the littoral region are found than in temperate regions (DEN HARTOG, 1959, p. 29). This is due to the high air temperatures, and fluctuations in mean sea-level. In the sublittoral region, different communities of plants and animals have developed in a certain relation to the type of bottom. Where the rocky coast forms a horizontal platform at a depth of a few meters, this may harbour several corals and Gorgonids, and also a number of lithophilous algae such as Amphiroa hancockii, Galaxaura spp., and Halimeda discoidea. In some localities corals, such as Millepora alcicornis, Eusmilia fastigiata, Porites porites, Acropora cervicornis, A. palmata, Agaricia agaricites and Montastrea are found up to rather high levels. Although corals are of general occurrence on St. Martin, St. Eustatius and Saba, the beaches of coral debris, well-known on Bonaire and Curaçao, are not present. This possibly may be explained by the fact that the sea around St. Martin is rather shallow, and the bottom over large areas consists of sand. When the seabottom consists of sand, the littoral region and the uppermost part of the sublittoral region may be devoid of algae. At a greater depth where the sandy <b>bottom</b> is more <b>stable,</b> vegetations of Thalassia testudinum and Syringodium filiforme and also of algae may develop. Especially Thalassia is important for accumulating sand: the Thalassia fields gradually rise and finally may protrude 30 — 50 cm or more above the surrounding seabottom (cf. Simson Bay and Mouth Piece Bay). In seagrass vegetations many species of algae are found; particularly representatives of the order Siphonales may be fairly abundant, also in bare sandy bottoms which are somewhat settled. A seagrass vegetation with algae is not only found on open sandy coasts but also in the lagoons, especially at their shallow entrances, where the water is more quiet than in open bays. The presence of numerous spherical-branched Lithothamnia among the Thalassia vegetation, at a depht of about 40 cm, near the entrance of Oyster Pond, is remarkable. The algal vegetations on the roots of Rhizophora in Oyster Pond and in the entrance of Fish Pond are exactly as described in the literature. In the littoral region Bostrychia binderi and Polysiphonia howei are common; in the uppermost part of the sublittoral region many other species are present, especially Acanthophora spicifera, together with Caloglossa leprieurii, Murrayella periclados and Ulva lactuca. In the rear part of the lagoons, and along the banks of lagoons completely shut off from the sea, the bottom is muddy and the salt content shows remarkable fluctuations. Only a few euryhalinic algal species are found in these shallow pools; especially Batophora oerstedi and Enteromorpha spp., in most cases attached to coral fragments, pieces of wood or shells...|$|R
