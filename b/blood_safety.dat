The show reached almost 70 percent of children in urban areas and almost 50 percent in rural areas, and its viewers had improvements in HIV/AIDS knowledge, attitudes, and communication. In 2007 it began airing in almost all of the country's official languages, and its Muppets were used in health educational campaigns. In 2008, the show began to focus on diversity within South Africa and technology. The show's tenth anniversary in 2010 was marked by a series of workshops in South Africa focusing {{on the future of the}} show and the needs of the country's children. Research conducted about the show's affects showed that viewers gained in four major areas: basic knowledge, <b>blood</b> <b>safety,</b> discrimination, and numeracy skills.

This review discusses the health economic evaluations of strategies to enhance <b>blood</b> product <b>safety</b> in sub-Saharan Africa. METHODS: We reviewed health economic methodology with special reference to cost-effectiveness analysis. We {{searched the literature}} for cost-effectiveness in <b>blood</b> product <b>safety</b> in sub-Saharan Africa. RESULT: HIV-antibody screening in different settings in sub-Saharan Africa showed health gains and saved costs. Except for adding HIV-p 24 screening, adding other tests such as nucleic acid amplification testing (NAT) to HIV-antibody screening displayed incremental cost-effectiveness ratios greater than the WHO/World Bank specified threshold for cost-effectiveness. The addition of HIV-p 24 in combination with HCV antibody/antigen screening and multiplex (HBV, HCV and HIV) NAT in pools of 24 may also be cost-effective options for Ghana. CONCLUSIONS: From a health economic viewpoint, HIV-antibody screening should always be implemented in sub-Saharan Africa. The addition of HIV-p 24 antigen screening, in combination with HCV antibody/antigen screening and multiplex (HBV, HCV and HIV) NAT in pools of 24 may be feasible options for Ghana.

40|$|Background. Haemovigilance is {{a system}} {{consisting}} of the detection, collecting and analysis of information regarding unwanted and unexpected effects of blood transfusion that {{make it possible to}} take action in order to improve <b>blood</b> trasfusion <b>safety.</b> In a broader sense, it is defined as a set of surveillance procedures covering the whole transfusion chain from the collection of blood to the follow-up of recipients. In some European countries a haemovigilance system based on legislation was introduced during the last ten years, European Haemovigilance Network was organised and some results from the existing surveillance systems were reported. The paper presents haemovigilance activities in Slovenia. Conclusions. In Slovenia, many elements of haemovigilance are already included in the blood transfusion chain, but no unique system of data collection exists. We expect a new legislation on blood transfusion to help us with introducing a data collection system, analysis and activities in order to further improve <b>blood</b> transfusion <b>safety.</b> </p...|$|R

40|$|International audienceINTRODUCTION: <b>Blood</b> {{transfusion}} <b>safety</b> {{depends on}} strict compliance {{with each step}} of a process beginning with the order for labile blood products and related immunohematologic testing and ending with administration and follow-up of the receiver. This process is governed by stringent regulatory texts and guidelines. Despite precautions, processing errors are still reported. Analysis of incident reports shows that {{the most common cause}} involves patient identification and that most errors occur at two levels, i. e. the entry of patient information and management of multiple regulatory crosschecks and record-keeping using different systems. METHOD: The purpose of this report is to describe the collaborative approach implemented by the √âtablissement fran√ßais du Sang Alpes-M√©diterran√©e (EFSAM) and the Assistance publique des H√¥pitaux de Marseille (APHM) to secure the blood transfusion process and protect interfaces while simplifying and facilitating exchanges. RESULTS: Close cooperation has had a threefold impact with simplification of administration, improvement of experience feedback, and better management of test ordering. The organization implemented between the two institutions has minimized document redundancy and interfaces between immunohematologic testing and delivery. Collaboration based on experience feedback has improved the level of quality and cost control. CONCLUSION: In the domain of <b>blood</b> transfusion <b>safety,</b> the threshold of 10 (- 5) has been reached with regard to the risk of ABO errors in the distribution concentrated red cells (CRC). In addition, this collaborative organization has created further opportunity for improvement by deploying new methods to identify simplification measures and by controlling demand and usage...|$|R

The English blood transfusion service, National Health Service Blood and Transplant (NHSBT), is undergoing major reconfiguration, and the current practice of transfusion training for haematology specialists primarily at blood centres with little or no hospital training is not sustainable or desirable.
