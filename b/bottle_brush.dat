40|$|Alignment of anisometric {{particles}} into liquid crystals (LCs) {{often results}} from an entropic competition between their rotational and translational {{degrees of freedom}} at dense packings. Here we show that by selectively functionalizing the heads of colloidal rods with magnetic nanoparticles this tendency can be broken to direct the particles into novel, low-density LC phases. Under an external magnetic field, the magnetic heads line up in columns whereas the nonmagnetic tails point out randomly in a plane perpendicular to the columns, forming bottle-brush-like objects; laterally, the <b>bottle</b> <b>brushes</b> are entropically stabilized against coalescence. Experiments and simulations show that upon increasing the particle density the system goes from a dilute gas to a dense two-dimensional liquid of <b>bottle</b> <b>brushes</b> with a density well below the zero-field nematic phase.

40|$|National Science Foundation of China [11274258]We {{analyze the}} scaling {{properties}} of grafted polyrotaxanes {{and compare the}} resulting scaling laws with molecular dynamics simulations. These molecules display a resemblance to <b>bottle</b> <b>brushes,</b> but the mobility of the rotors yields a backbone tension that is uniform along its contour. Properties like brush extension, backbone tension, and rotor mobility as functions of rotor density and degree of polymerization of grafted chains are well covered by a simple scaling model. The dynamics of rotor release after a breakup of the polyrotaxane a process recently observed in laboratory experiments is studied in detail. It consists of three stages: a rapid backbone retraction, a driven rotor expulsion, and a diffusive transport. The complexity of this process, which may be exploited for drug delivery systems, is asking for further in-depth simulation studies...|$|R
40|$|Using {{the bond}} {{fluctuation}} model (BFM), simulations {{have been performed}} on molecular <b>bottle</b> <b>brushes</b> with two chemically different types of side chains. In {{the first part of}} this work, rigidity of the backbone is imposed. The influence of solvent quality and side chain length on the intramolecular phase separation of side chain material, leading to Janus cylinders, has been investigated and compared to theoretical predictions. In the second part of this work, the restriction of rigidity for the backbone is relaxed. In a poor solvent, the side chain material collapses into a globular state. Several globules containing each one type of side chain material are connected together by backbone material. When imposing different solvent condition for both types of side chains, a bending of the backbone is found as predicted by theory and observed in very recent experiments...|$|R

40|$|Lampbrush Chromosomes (LBCs) {{are present}} in the oocytes of birds, lower vertebrata and {{invertebrates}} during the prolonged prophase of the first meiotic division. Their name stems from their similarity to <b>bottle</b> <b>brushes.</b> Lampbrush chromosome of the early prophase is a bivalent, made up of two conjugating homologues. The axis of each homologous chromosome is formed by sister chromatids that are differentiated into regions of transcrip-tionally active and inactive chromatin. Transcription activity of LBCs is observed as a mantle of symmetrically distributed side loops along the chromosome axis. Changes in transcriptional activity are reflected in changes in their morphology. Transcriptional activity of LBCs is directly connected with physiological processes of the body and shows in the morphological structure of the chromosomes. The use of cytogenetic techniques and in situ hybridization have made it possible to identify unique and repeating sequences as well as DNA replication pro-teins in LBCs. Particularly, interesting prospects are offered by the possibility of using LBCs in studies of trans-criptional activity, cytogenetic investigations of karyotype evolution and genome mapping.

He wanted to show his students the possible achievements that happen in a short space of time and the impermanence of existence. [...] "In our culture, there is a strong emphasis on reproduction and the original seems less important. My students were shocked when I would erase the original, because they saw it firsthand, and they were disturbed that it was destroyed. People who do not see the original have no problem only looking at it on a screen or as a print, but once you see the original it is hard to let it go or believe that it could be destroyed."

When he casually wiped away his art creations, the students reacted with extreme dismay making Euclide decide to release a series of the temporary ephemeral artworks.|$|R
40|$|In this review, we {{describe}} {{applications of the}} pruned-enriched Rosenbluth method (PERM), a sequential Monte Carlo algorithm with resampling, to various problems in polymer physics. PERM produces samples according to any given prescribed weight distribution, by growing configurations step by step with controlled bias, and correcting "bad" configurations by "population control". The latter is implemented, in contrast to other population based algorithms like e. g. genetic algorithms, by depth-first recursion which avoids storing {{all members of the}} population {{at the same time in}} computer memory. The problems we discuss all concern single polymers (with one exception), but under various conditions: Homopolymers in good solvents and at the I similar to point, semi-stiff polymers, polymers in confining geometries, stretched polymers undergoing a forced globule-linear transition, star polymers, <b>bottle</b> <b>brushes,</b> lattice animals as a model for randomly branched polymers, DNA melting, and finally-as the only system at low temperatures, lattice heteropolymers as simple models for protein folding. PERM is for some of these problems the method of choice, but it can also fail. We discuss how to recognize when a result is reliable, and we discuss also some types of bias that can be crucial in guiding the growth into the right directions...|$|R
40|$|The phase {{behaviour}} of two-component bottle-brush polymers with fully flexible backbones under {{poor solvent}} conditions is studied via molecular-dynamics simulations, using a coarse-grained bead-spring model and side chains {{of up to}} N= 40 effective monomers. We consider a symmetric model where side chains of type A and B are grafted alternately onto a flexible backbone. The {{aim of this study}} to explore the phase behaviour of two-component bottle-brushes depending on parameters, such as as the grafting density σ, the backbone length N_b, the side-chain length N, and the temperature T. Based on a cluster analysis, we identify for our range of parameters the regimes of fully phase separated systems, i. e., A-type side chains form one cluster and B-type chains another, while the interface that separates these two clusters contains the backbone monomers. We find that pearl-necklace or Janus-like structures, which normally occur for bottle-brush polymers with rigid backbones under poor solvent conditions, are fully attributed to the backbone rigidity, and, therefore, such structures are unlikely in the case of <b>bottle</b> <b>brushes</b> with fully flexible backbones. Also, a comparative discussion with earlier work on the phase behaviour of single-component bottle-brush polymers with flexible backbones is performed. Comment: 16 pages, 5 figure...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{thickness}} of dendronized polymers can be tuned by varying their generation g and the dendron functionality X. Systematic studies of this effect require (i) synthetic {{ability to produce}} large samples of high quality polymers with systematic variation of g, X and of the backbone polymerization degree N, (ii) a theoretical model relating the solvent swollen polymer diameter, r, and persistence length, lambda, to g and X. This article presents an optimized synthetic method and a simple theoretical model. Our theory approach, based on the Boris-Rubinstein model of dendrimers predicts r approximately n(1 / 4) g(1 / 2) and lambda approximately n(2) where n = [(X - 1) (g) - 1]/(X - 2) {{is the number of}} monomers in a dendron. The average monomer concentration in the branched side chains of a dendronized polymer increases with g in qualitative contrast to <b>bottle</b> <b>brushes</b> whose side chains are linear. The stepwise, attach-to, synthesis of X = 3 dendronized polymers yielded gram amounts of g = 1 - 4 polymers with N approximately = 1000 and N approximately = 7000 as compared to earlier maxima of 0. 1 g amounts and of N approximately = 1000. The method can be modified to dendrons of different X. The conversion fraction at each attach-to step, as quantified by converting unreacted groups with UV labels, was 99. 3 % to 99. 8 %. Atomic force microscopy on mixed polymer samples allows to distinguish between chains of different g and suggests an apparent height difference of 0. 85 nm per generation as well as an increase of persistence length with g. We suggest synthetic directions to allow confrontation with theory...|$|R
