5|$|Increasing {{obesity in}} the United States and health {{improvements}} elsewhere contributed to lowering the country's rank in life expectancy from 11th {{in the world}} in 1987, to 42nd in 2007.

Approximately one-third of the adult population is obese and an additional third is overweight. Obesity-related type 2 diabetes is considered epidemic <b>by</b> <b>health</b> care professionals.|$|E

5|$|The {{greatest}} {{origin of}} costs for society is the long-term care <b>by</b> <b>health</b> care professionals and particularly institutionalisation, which corresponds to 2/3 {{of the total}} costs for society.

5|$|All {{enemies are}} {{protected}} <b>by</b> <b>health,</b> shields, armor, barriers, {{or a combination}} thereof. Each type of protection has its own vulnerabilities. For example, armor is usually vulnerable to powers such as Incinerate, which burns enemies over time, and to weapons with a low rate of fire such as sniper rifles and heavy pistols. In contrast, shields are vulnerable to powers such as Overload and to rapid-firing weapons like submachine guns and assault rifles. Barriers are typically used by boss-type enemies and are vulnerable to certain weapons and powers. When the shields, armor, or barriers of an enemy have all been depleted, the player can use status-effect powers such as Pull, which temporarily levitates targets into the air, incapacitating them. Other powers may temporary benefit the player; for instance, Adrenaline Rush puts the player in bullet time. Powers do not require any sort of expendable resource; they only have a global refresh time period.|$|E
5|$|During George's reign, the {{break-up}} of the British Empire and its transition into the Commonwealth of Nations accelerated. The parliament of the Irish Free State removed direct {{mention of the}} monarch from the country's constitution {{on the day of}} his accession. The following year, a new Irish constitution changed the name of the state to Ireland and established the office of President. From 1939, the Empire and Commonwealth– except Ireland– was at war with Nazi Germany. War with Italy and Japan followed in 1940 and 1941, respectively. Though Britain and its allies were ultimately victorious in 1945, the United States and the Soviet Union rose as pre-eminent world powers and the British Empire declined. After the independence of India and Pakistan in 1947, George remained king of both countries, but relinquished the title of Emperor of India in June 1948. Ireland formally declared itself a republic and left the Commonwealth in 1949, and India became a republic within the Commonwealth the following year. George adopted the new title of Head of the Commonwealth. He was beset <b>by</b> <b>health</b> problems in the later years of his reign. He was succeeded by his eldest daughter, Elizabeth II.|$|E
5|$|Led by Gretzky and Mark Messier, the Oilers {{won five}} Stanley Cup championships between 1984 and 1990. On August 9, 1988, Oilers owner Peter Pocklington, in {{financial}} trouble, traded Gretzky to the Los Angeles Kings. Gretzky's trade to the Kings popularized ice hockey in the United States. With the Kings, Gretzky broke Gordie Howe's {{record for the}} most career points. Mario Lemieux led Pittsburgh to Stanley Cups in 1990–91 and 1991–92. A gifted forward, he won six Art Ross Trophies as the league's leading scorer and he scored 199 points in 1988–89, becoming the second highest single-season point scorer behind Gretzky. Lemieux's career was plagued <b>by</b> <b>health</b> issues, including non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and he retired in 1997. In 2000, he returned and finished his NHL career in 2006 with more than 1,700 points.|$|E

5|$|Monroe {{was next}} to star in a {{television}} adaptation of W.

Instead of working, she spent {{the first six months of}} 1961 preoccupied <b>by</b> <b>health</b> problems. Monroe underwent surgery for her endometriosis, had a cholecystectomy, and spent four weeks in hospital care – including a brief stint in a mental ward – for depression. She was helped by her ex-husband Joe DiMaggio, with whom she now rekindled a friendship. In spring 1961, Monroe also moved back to California after six years on the East Coast. She dated Frank Sinatra for several months, and in early 1962 purchased a house in Brentwood, Los Angeles.|$|E
5|$|Programming of Dynamic Speech Generating devices {{is usually}} done by augmentative {{communication}} specialists. Specialists {{are required to}} cater {{to the needs of}} the patients because the patients usually choose what kinds of words/ phrases they want. For example, patients use different phrases based on their age, disability, interests, etc. Therefore, content organization is extremely time consuming. Additionally, SGDs are rarely covered <b>by</b> <b>health</b> insurance companies. As a result, resources are very limited with regards to both funding and staffing. Dr. John Costello of Boston Children’s Hospital has been the driving force soliciting donations to keep these program running and well-staffed both within his hospital and in hospitals across the country.|$|E
5|$|The cost of {{hospice care}} may be met <b>by</b> <b>health</b> {{insurance}} providers, including Medicare or Medicaid for eligible Americans. Hospice is covered 100% with no co-pay or deductible by Medicare Part A except that patients {{are responsible for}} a copay for outpatient drugs and respite care, if needed. (Respite care may be necessary, for instance, if a family member who is providing home hospice care is briefly unable to perform his or her duties and an alternative care provider becomes necessary.) As of 2008, Medicare was responsible for around 80% of hospice payments, reimbursing providers differently from county to county with a higher rate for inpatient hospice care. A lower rate is paid for home care, with a higher rate paid for round-the-clock nursing care {{in order to get}} a patient's symptoms under control.|$|E
