25|$|The {{cultural}} background and erudition {{of her family}} members served to ignite the imaginative faculties of Schiaparelli’s impressionable childhood years. She became enraptured with the lore of ancient cultures and religious rites. These sources inspired her to pen a volume of poems titled Arethusa based on the ancient Greek myth of the hunt. The content of her writing so alarmed the conservative sensibilities of her parents they sought to tame her fantasy life by sending her to a convent boarding school in Switzerland. Once within the school’s confines, Schiaparelli rebelled against its strict authority by going on a hunger strike, leaving her parents to see {{no alternative but to}} <b>bring</b> <b>her</b> <b>home</b> again.|$|E

500|$|During the [...] and [...] seasons, Sidle {{seems to}} be on a {{downward}} spiral as her memories of childhood resurface, with cases becoming more difficult for her emotionally. Also, the fact that Grissom decided to promote Nick Stokes instead of Sidle, did not help. Season Four concludes with Sidle being stopped by a traffic cop. Although she is driving under the influence, she is not charged, but Grissom, as her supervisor, is informed of her arrest. He arrives at the station to <b>bring</b> <b>her</b> <b>home,</b> and finally seems to notice her emotional state. Later, in , she loses her temper with a domestic abuse suspect and then argues with supervisors Catherine Willows and Conrad Ecklie, which results in her suspension. Following this incident, she admits to Grissom that she has a problem with authority, has chosen emotionally unavailable men (like Grissom), and has a self-destructive streak. Sidle then opens up to him and reveals her family story; it is during this season that she apparently starts bonding with Grissom. During the subsequent seasons ( [...] and [...] ), after it is revealed that they are in a relationship, she appears to be happier and on a more even keel.|$|E
500|$|Perry and Doofenshmirtz {{at first}} seem to loathe {{each other in}} the {{beginning}} of the series, and have been arch-nemeses since the day they met. However, they are often cordial and friendly towards one another and it is said by Doofenshmirtz that Perry is his best friend, and Perry will often act to save Doofenshmirtz's life when his plot inevitably blows up in his face. Doofenshmirtz also went out of his way in one episode to become closer to Perry after he is assigned to a new villain. [...] Habitually, their daily brawls involve Doofenshmirtz devising a scheme, which Perry goes to stop after being briefed by Major Monogram. He is trapped by Doofenshmirtz while trying to do so and is told of the doctor's scheme, usually pertaining to some backstory or pet peeve. He then escapes and the two fight, Perry coming out victorious with Doofenshmirtz yelling [...] "Curse you, Perry the Platypus!". The two rely on this daily structure, Doofenshmirtz even specifically mentioning it in [...] "Journey to the Center of Candace" [...] and in episodes such as [...] "It's About Time!" [...] in which Doofenshmirtz temporarily replaces Perry with secret agent Peter The Panda and they become depressed about not having each other to fight. Perry realizes he misses Doof too. When Perry does not arrive on the scene of Doofenshmirtz's evil plan, the doctor hesitates to execute his plans and fears for where Perry has gone, though he notes that he [...] "hopes something terrible has happened to him.". Sometimes, they decided not to fight and have fun, as shown in [...] "Happy New Year!" [...] and [...] "Candace Disconnected". On other occasions, depending on whatever situation Doofenshmirtz is facing, Perry would often help Doofenshmirtz with his non-evil plans, such as helping him overcome evil scientist's block, helping him put on a birthday party for his 16-year-old daughter Vanessa, impressing a square dancing girl with programmable square dancing boots that Doofenshmritz created, working together to stop a raging platypus hunter from hunting them down, or helping him convince his rich ex-wife to help pay off his mortgage debt. Also, Perry tends to use Doofenshmirtz's inventions to erase evidence of whatever contraptions Phineas and Ferb had made, leaving Candace unable to bust them. Examples include when Perry asked to borrow Doofenshmirtz's robot Norm to pick up footage from the city surveillance cameras in order to preserve his job as an agent, as well as using Doofenshmirtz's Pick-Him-Up-inator to rescue a lost Candace and <b>bring</b> <b>her</b> <b>home.</b>|$|E

In February 2015, Abi is accused by Max of killing Lucy. Abi did not kill Lucy, but it is revealed that on the night Lucy died, Abi had a confrontation with Lucy about her affair with Max, which resulted in Abi slapping Lucy. After Max tells her that Tanya would like her to move to Devon with her, Abi refuses and instead moves in with Ben and his family. After she moves in, Ben reveals {{to her that he}} might still be gay and is worried he will never get over his homosexuality but Abi assures him that they will make things work.

After confronting Abi on this, Carol agrees that she has been out of control lately and advises her to call Tanya for moral support.
