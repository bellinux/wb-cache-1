5|$|Iodine is {{the least}} {{abundant}} of the stable halogens, comprising only 0.46parts per million of Earth's crustal rocks (compare: fluorine 544ppm, chlorine 126ppm, bromine 2.5ppm). Among the eighty-four elements which occur in significant quantities (elements 1–42, 44–60, 62–83, and 90–92), it ranks sixty-first in abundance. Iodide minerals are rare, and most deposits that are concentrated enough for economical extraction are iodate minerals instead. Examples include lautarite, Ca(IO3)2, and dietzeite, 7Ca(IO3)2·8CaCrO4. These are the minerals that occur as trace impurities in the caliche, found in Chile, whose main product is sodium nitrate. In total, they can contain at least 0.02% and at most 1% iodine by weight. Sodium iodate is extracted from the caliche and reduced to iodide by sodium <b>bisulfite.</b> This solution is then reacted with freshly extracted iodate, resulting in comproportionation to iodine, which may be filtered off.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bisulfite</b> {{sequencing}} is used widely across mammalian genomes, however complications {{have arisen}} {{with the discovery}} of a new mammalian DNA modification 5-hydroxymethylcytosine. 5-Hydroxymethylcytosine converts to cytosine-5-methylsulfonate upon <b>bisulfite</b> treatment, which then reads as a C when sequenced. Therefore, <b>bisulfite</b> sequencing cannot discriminate between 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine. This means that the output from <b>bisulfite</b> sequencing can no longer be defined as solely DNA methylation, as it is the composite of 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine. The development of Tet-assisted <b>bisulfite</b> sequencing by Chuan He at the University of Chicago is now able to distinguish between the two modifications at single base resolution.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bisulfite</b> {{sequencing}} (also {{known as}} bisulphite sequencing) {{is the use}} of <b>bisulfite</b> treatment of DNA to determine its pattern of methylation. DNA methylation was the first discovered epigenetic mark, and remains the most studied. In animals it predominantly involves the addition of a methyl group to the carbon-5 position of cytosine residues of the dinucleotide CpG, and is implicated in repression of transcriptional activity.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bisulfite</b> {{sequencing}} {{relies on}} the conversion of every single unmethylated cytosine residue to uracil. If conversion is incomplete, the subsequent analysis will incorrectly interpret the unconverted unmethylated cytosines as methylated cytosines, resulting in false positive results for methylation. Only cytosines in single-stranded DNA are susceptible to attack by <b>bisulfite,</b> therefore denaturation of the DNA undergoing analysis is critical. It is important to ensure that reaction parameters such as temperature and salt concentration are suitable to maintain the DNA in a single-stranded conformation and allow for complete conversion. Embedding the DNA in agarose gel {{has been reported to}} improve the rate of conversion by keeping strands of DNA physically separate.|$|E
25|$|Synthetic taurine is {{obtained}} by the ammonolysis of isethionic acid (2-hydroxyethanesulfonic acid), which in turn {{is obtained}} from the reaction of ethylene oxide with aqueous sodium <b>bisulfite.</b> A direct approach involves the reaction of aziridine with sulfurous acid.|$|E
25|$|A final {{concern is}} that <b>bisulfite</b> {{treatment}} greatly reduces the level of complexity in the sample, which can be problematic if multiple PCR reactions are to be performed (2006). Primer design is more difficult, and inappropriate cross-hybridization is more frequent.|$|E
25|$|A {{potentially}} {{significant problem}} following <b>bisulfite</b> treatment is incomplete desulfonation of pyrimidine residues due to inadequate alkalization of the solution. This may inhibit some DNA polymerases, rendering subsequent PCR difficult. However, this situation {{can be avoided}} by monitoring the pH of the solution to ensure that desulfonation will be complete.|$|E
25|$|Epigenetic {{research}} uses a {{wide range}} of molecular biologic techniques to further our understanding of epigenetic phenomena, including chromatin immunoprecipitation (together with its large-scale variants ChIP-on-chip and ChIP-Seq), fluorescent in situ hybridization, methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes, DNA adenine methyltransferase identification (DamID) and <b>bisulfite</b> sequencing. Furthermore, the use of bioinformatic methods is playing an increasing role (computational epigenetics).|$|E
25|$|Gene-set {{analysis}} (for example using tools like DAVID and GoSeq) {{has been}} shown to be severely biased when applied to high-throughput methylation data (e.g. genome-wide <b>bisulfite</b> sequencing); it has been suggested that this can be corrected using sample label permutations or using a statistical model to control for differences in the numberes of CpG probes / CpG sites that target each gene.|$|E
25|$|Methylation-Specific PCR (MSP), {{which is}} based on a {{chemical}} reaction of sodium <b>bisulfite</b> with DNA that converts unmethylated cytosines of CpG dinucleotides to uracil or UpG, followed by traditional PCR. However, methylated cytosines will not be converted in this process, and primers are designed to overlap the CpG site of interest, which allows one to determine methylation status as methylated or unmethylated.|$|E
25|$|A {{study that}} {{investigated}} the methylome of B cells along their differentiation cycle, using whole-genome <b>bisulfite</b> sequencing (WGBS), {{showed that there}} is a hypomethylation from the earliest stages to the most differentiated stages. The largest methylation difference is between the stages of germinal center B cells and memory B cells. Furthermore, this study showed {{that there is a}} similarity between B cell tumors and long-lived B cells in their DNA methylation signatures.|$|E
25|$|Large-scale {{epigenome}} mapping {{efforts are}} under way {{around the world and}} have been organized under the Human Epigenome Project. This is based on a multi-tiered strategy, whereby <b>bisulfite</b> sequencing is used to obtain high-resolution methylation profiles for a limited number of reference epigenomes, while less thorough analysis is performed on a wider spectrum of samples. This approach is intended to maximize the insight gained from a given amount of resources, as high-resolution genome-wide mapping remains a costly undertaking.|$|E
25|$|High Resolution Melt Analysis (HRM or HRMA), is a post-PCR {{analytical}} technique. The target DNA {{is treated}} with sodium <b>bisulfite,</b> which chemically converts unmethylated cytosines into uracils, while methylated cytosines are preserved. PCR amplification is then {{carried out with}} primers designed to amplify both methylated and unmethylated templates. After this amplification, highly methylated DNA sequences contain a higher number of CpG sites compared to unmethylated templates, which results in a different melting temperature {{that can be used}} in quantitative methylation detection.|$|E
25|$|Pyro{{sequencing}} of <b>bisulfite</b> treated DNA. This is {{sequencing of}} an amplicon {{made by a}} normal forward primer but a biotinylated reverse primer to PCR the gene of choice. The Pyrosequencer then analyses the sample by denaturing the DNA and adding one nucleotide {{at a time to}} the mix according to a sequence given by the user. If there is a mis-match, it is recorded and the percentage of DNA for which the mis-match is present is noted. This gives the user a percentage methylation per CpG island.|$|E
25|$|The {{advances}} in <b>bisulfite</b> sequencing {{have led to}} the possibility of applying them at a genome-wide scale, where, previously, global measure of DNA methylation was feasible only using other techniques, such as Restriction landmark genomic scanning. The mapping of the human epigenome is seen by many scientists as the logical follow-up to the completion of the Human Genome Project. This epigenomic information will be important in understanding how the function of the genetic sequence is implemented and regulated. Since the epigenome is less stable than the genome, it is thought to be important in gene-environment interactions.|$|E
25|$|Methylation-specific PCR (MSP): {{developed}} by Stephen Baylin and Jim Herman at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, {{and is used}} to detect methylation of CpG islands in genomic DNA. DNA is first treated with sodium <b>bisulfite,</b> which converts unmethylated cytosine bases to uracil, which is recognized by PCR primers as thymine. Two PCRs are then carried out on the modified DNA, using primer sets identical except at any CpG islands within the primer sequences. At these points, one primer set recognizes DNA with cytosines to amplify methylated DNA, and one set recognizes DNA with uracil or thymine to amplify unmethylated DNA. MSP using qPCR can also be performed to obtain quantitative rather than qualitative information about methylation.|$|E
25|$|DNA {{methylation}} marks, are genomic {{regions with}} specific methylation pattern {{in a specific}} biological state such as tissue, cell type, individual), are regarded as possible functional regions involved in gene transcriptional regulation. Although various human cell types may have the same genome, these cells have different methylomes. The systematic identification and characterization of methylation marks across cell types are crucial to understanding the complex regulatory network for cell fate determination. Hongbo Liu et al. proposed an entropy-based framework termed SMART to integrate the whole genome <b>bisulfite</b> sequencing methylomes across 42 human tissues/cells and identified 757,887 genome segments. Nearly 75% of the segments showed uniform methylation across all cell types. From the remaining 25% of the segments, they identified cell type-specific hypo/hypermethylation marks that were specifically hypo/hypermethylated in a minority of cell types using a statistical approach and presented an atlas of the human methylation marks. Further analysis revealed that the cell type-specific hypomethylation marks were enriched through H3K27ac and transcription factor binding sites in cell type-specific manner. In particular, they observed that the cell type-specific hypomethylation marks {{are associated with the}} cell type-specific super-enhancers that drive the expression of cell identity genes. This framework provides a complementary, functional annotation of the human genome and helps to elucidate the critical features and functions of cell type-specific hypomethylation.|$|E

Potassium bromate (...) is a strong oxidizer (E924), used to improve dough strength and rise height. Potassium <b>bisulfite</b> (...) {{is used as a}} food preservative, for example in wine and beer-making (but not in meats). It is also used to bleach textiles and straw, and in the tanning of leathers.|$|E
2500|$|... 5-Methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine both {{read as a}} C in <b>bisulfite</b> {{sequencing}}. Oxidative <b>bisulfite</b> sequencing is {{a method}} to discriminate between 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine at single base resolution. The method employs a specific chemical oxidation of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine to 5-formylcytosine, which subsequently converts to uracil during <b>bisulfite</b> treatment. The only base that then reads as a C is 5‑methylcytosine, giving {{a map of the}} true methylation status in the DNA sample. Levels of 5‑hydroxymethylcytosine can also be quantified by measuring the difference between <b>bisulfite</b> and oxidative <b>bisulfite</b> sequencing.|$|E
2500|$|Treatment of DNA with <b>bisulfite</b> {{converts}} cytosine residues to uracil, but leaves 5-methylcytosine residues unaffected. Therefore, DNA {{that has}} been treated with <b>bisulfite</b> retains only methylated cytosines. Thus, <b>bisulfite</b> treatment introduces specific changes in the DNA sequence that depend on the methylation status of individual cytosine residues, yielding single-nucleotide resolution information about the methylation status of a segment of DNA. Various analyses can be performed on the altered sequence to retrieve this information. [...] The objective of this analysis is therefore reduced to differentiating between single nucleotide polymorphisms (cytosines and thymidine) resulting from <b>bisulfite</b> conversion (Figure 1).|$|E
2500|$|<b>Bisulfite</b> {{sequencing}} applies routine sequencing methods on bisulfite-treated genomic DNA {{to determine}} methylation status at CpG dinucleotides. [...] Other non-sequencing strategies are also employed to interrogate the methylation at specific loci or at a genome-wide level. [...] All strategies assume that bisulfite-induced conversion of unmethylated cytosines to uracil is complete, and this {{serves as the}} basis of all subsequent techniques. [...] Ideally, the method used would determine the methylation status separately for each allele. [...] Alternative methods to <b>bisulfite</b> sequencing include Combined Bisulphite Restriction Analysis and methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP).|$|E
2500|$|Microarray-based {{methods are}} a logical {{extension}} of the technologies available to analyze bisulfite-treated DNA to allow for genome-wide analysis of methylation. Oligonucleotide microarrays are designed using pairs of oligonucleotide hybridization probes targeting CpG sites of interest. [...] One is complementary to the unaltered methylated sequence, {{and the other is}} complementary to the C-to-U-converted unmethylated sequence. [...] The probes are also bisulfite-specific to prevent binding to DNA incompletely converted by <b>bisulfite.</b> The Illumina Methylation Assay is one such assay that applies the <b>bisulfite</b> sequencing technology on a microarray level to generate genome-wide methylation data.|$|E
2500|$|In the United States, the Center for Science in the Public Interest {{lists the}} two food preservatives, sulfur dioxide and sodium <b>bisulfite,</b> as being safe for human {{consumption}} except for certain asthmatic individuals who may be sensitive to them, especially in large amounts. [...] Symptoms of sensitivity to sulfiting agents, including sulfur dioxide, manifest as potentially life-threatening trouble breathing within minutes of ingestion.|$|E
2500|$|... {{also known}} as BS-Seq, which is a {{high-throughput}} genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation. It is based on aforementioned sodium <b>bisulfite</b> conversion of genomic DNA, which is then sequenced on a Next-generation sequencing platform. The sequences obtained are then re-aligned to the reference genome to determine methylation states of CpG dinucleotides based on mismatches resulting from the conversion of unmethylated cytosines into uracil.|$|E
2500|$|Sulfur dioxide is toxic {{in large}} amounts. [...] It or its {{conjugate}} base <b>bisulfite</b> is produced biologically {{as an intermediate}} in both sulfate-reducing organisms and in sulfur-oxidizing bacteria, as well. The role of sulfur dioxide in mammalian biology is not yet well understood. [...] Sulfur dioxide blocks nerve signals from the pulmonary stretch receptors and abolishes the Hering–Breuer inflation reflex.|$|E
2500|$|A major {{challenge}} in <b>bisulfite</b> sequencing is {{the degradation of}} DNA that takes place concurrently with the conversion. The conditions necessary for complete conversion, such as long incubation times, elevated temperature, and high <b>bisulfite</b> concentration, {{can lead to the}} degradation of about 90% of the incubated DNA. [...] Given that the starting amount of DNA is often limited, such extensive degradation can be problematic. The degradation occurs as depurinations resulting in random strand breaks. Therefore, the longer the desired PCR amplicon, the more limited the number of intact template molecules will likely be. This could lead to the failure of the PCR amplification, or the loss of quantitatively accurate information on methylation levels resulting from the limited sampling of template molecules. Thus, it is important to assess the amount of DNA degradation resulting from the reaction conditions employed, and consider how this will affect the desired amplicon. Techniques {{can also be used to}} minimize DNA degradation, such as cycling the incubation temperature.|$|E
2500|$|Sulfur dioxide {{exists in}} wine in free and bound forms, and the {{combinations}} {{are referred to}} as total SO2. Binding, for instance to the carbonyl group of acetaldehyde, varies with the wine in question. The free form exists in equilibrium between molecular SO2 (as a dissolved gas) and <b>bisulfite</b> ion, which is in turn in equilibrium with sulfite ion. These equilibria depend on the pH of the wine. Lower pH shifts the equilibrium towards molecular (gaseous) SO2, which is the active form, while at higher pH more SO2 is found in the inactive sulfite and <b>bisulfite</b> forms. The molecular SO2 is active as an antimicrobial and antioxidant, and this is also the form which may be perceived as a pungent odor at high levels. Wines with total SO2 concentrations below 10 ppm do not require [...] "contains sulfites" [...] on the label by US and EU laws. [...] The upper limit of total SO2 allowed in wine in the US is 350 ppm; in the EU it is 160 ppm for red wines and 210 ppm for white and rosé wines. In low concentrations, SO2 is mostly undetectable in wine, but at free SO2 concentrations over 50 ppm, SO2 becomes evident in the smell and taste of wine.|$|E
2500|$|Early {{attempts}} at mutagenesis using radiation or chemical mutagens were non-site-specific, generating random mutations. [...] Analogs of nucleotides and other chemicals were later {{used to generate}} localized point mutations, examples of such chemicals are aminopurine, nitrosoguanidine, and <b>bisulfite.</b> [...] Site-directed mutagenesis was achieved in 1974 in the laboratory of Charles Weissmann using a nucleotide analogue N4-hydroxycytidine, which induces transition of GC to AT. These methods of mutagenesis, however, are limited {{by the kind of}} mutation they can achieve, and they are not as specific as later site-directed mutagenesis methods.|$|E
2500|$|This {{method is}} based on the single-strand {{conformation}} polymorphism analysis (SSCA) method developed for single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis. SSCA differentiates between single-stranded DNA fragments of identical size but distinct sequence based on differential migration in non-denaturating electrophoresis. [...] In MS-SSCA, this is used to distinguish between bisulfite-treated, PCR-amplified regions containing the CpG sites of interest. [...] Although SSCA lacks sensitivity when only a single nucleotide difference is present, <b>bisulfite</b> treatment frequently makes a number of C-to-T conversions in most regions of interest, and the resulting sensitivity approaches 100%. [...] MS-SSCA also provides semi-quantitative analysis of the degree of DNA methylation based on the ratio of band intensities. [...] However, this method is designed to assess all CpG sites as a whole in the region of interest rather than individual methylation sites.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{reported}} method of methylation analysis using bisulfite-treated DNA utilized PCR and standard dideoxynucleotide DNA sequencing to directly determine the nucleotides resistant to <b>bisulfite</b> conversion. [...] Primers {{are designed to}} be strand-specific as well as bisulfite-specific (i.e., primers containing non-CpG cytosines such that they are not complementary to non-bisulfite-treated DNA), flanking (but not involving) the methylation site of interest. [...] Therefore, it will amplify both methylated and unmethylated sequences, in contrast to methylation-specific PCR. [...] All sites of unmethylated cytosines are displayed as thymines in the resulting amplified sequence of the sense strand, and as adenines in the amplified antisense strand. [...] This technique required cloning of the PCR product prior to sequencing for adequate sensitivity, and therefore was a very labour-intensive method unsuitable for higher throughput. [...] Alternatively, nested PCR methods can be used to enhance the product for sequencing.|$|E
2500|$|In 1939, Albert Sabin {{reported}} that an experiment, employing {{the technique of}} [...] "forcefully expelling the total amount [...] {{in the direction of}} the olfactory mucosa, immediately drawing it back into the pipette, and repeating the process 2 to 3 times", was unable to confirm the results of Jungeblut, but found that [...] "monkeys on a scorbutic diet died of spontaneous acute infections, chiefly pneumonia and enterocolitis, while their mates receiving an adequate diet remained well." [...] Following this, Jungeblut found that [...] "with an infection of maximum severity, induced by flooding the nasal portal of entry with large amounts of virus, vitamin C administration fails to exert any demonstrable influence on the course of the disease, but with a less forceful method of droplet instillation, the picture of the disease in control animals becomes so variable that the results cannot be easily interpreted; but the available data suggest that vitamin C treatment may be a factor in converting abortive attacks into an altogether non-paralytic infection." [...] In 1979, R.J. Salo and D.O. Cliver inactivated Poliovirus type 1 by sodium <b>bisulfite</b> and ascorbic acid in an experiment.|$|E
2500|$|A {{recently}} described {{method by}} Ehrich et al. further {{takes advantage of}} bisulfite-conversions by adding a base-specific cleavage step to enhance the information gained from the nucleotide changes. [...] By first using in vitro transcription of the region of interest into RNA (by adding an RNA polymerase promoter site to the PCR primer in the initial amplification), RNase A {{can be used to}} cleave the RNA transcript at base-specific sites. [...] As RNase A cleaves RNA specifically at cytosine and uracil ribonucleotides, base-specificity is achieved by adding incorporating cleavage-resistant dTTP when cytosine-specific (C-specific) cleavage is desired, and incorporating dCTP when uracil-specific (U-specific) cleavage is desired. [...] The cleaved fragments can then be analyzed by MALDI-TOF. [...] <b>Bisulfite</b> treatment results in either introduction/removal of cleavage sites by C-to-U conversions or shift in fragment mass by G-to-A conversions in the amplified reverse strand. [...] C-specific cleavage will cut specifically at all methylated CpG sites. [...] By analyzing the sizes of the resulting fragments, it is possible to determine the specific pattern of DNA methylation of CpG sites within the region, rather than determining the extent of methylation of the region as a whole. [...] This method demonstrated efficacy for high-throughput screening, allowing for interrogation of numerous CpG sites in multiple tissues in a cost-efficient manner.|$|E
2500|$|Water {{changes are}} {{a staple of}} good {{saltwater}} maintenance. Larger (approximately [...] ) aquariums are much more stable and water changes may not need to take place if the nitrogen cycle has fully established itself in the tank, although this is a controversial statement among aquarists. [...] Water changes are used to maintain balance of calcium, carbonate alkalinity, and magnesium which are rapidly depleted in a reef aquarium, while also maintaining levels of other trace elements as well as removing toxic solutes which may accumulate from many different sources and cannot be removed by even advanced filtration methods. Supplements are needed (such as calcium) when regular water changes alone {{are not able to}} maintain adequate levels, particularly those of calcium, carbonate, and magnesium. Water changes involve removing a fraction of the total volume of the aquarium, replacing that water with new pre-mixed saltwater. Pre-mixed saltwater has been dechlorinated and/or dechloraminated—typically with an additive such as <b>bisulfite</b> or through filtering. Water should be brought to the same temperature if more than a 5% change is occurring. Salinity should match that of the aquarium, or be dosed very slowly if altering the salinity. Aging and aerating saltwater (such as in a bucket with a powerhead or airstone) is recommended as good practice to allow the pH to stabilize.|$|E
2500|$|While the {{production}} of alcohol is the most noteworthy by-product of yeast metabolism from a winemaking perspective, {{there are a number}} of other products that yeast produce that can be also influence the resulting wine. This includes glycerol which is produced when an intermediate of the glycolysis cycle (dihydroxyacetone) is reduced to [...] "recharge" [...] the NADH enzyme needed to continue other metabolic activities. This is usually produced early in the fermentation process before the mechanisms to reduce acetaldehyde into ethanol to recharge NADH becomes the cell's primary means of maintaining redox balance. As glycerol contributes increased body and a slightly sweet taste without increasing the alcohol level of the wine, some winemakers try to intentionally favor conditions that would promote glycerol production in wine. This includes selecting yeast strains that favor glycerol production (or allowing some wild yeast like Kloeckera and Metschnikowia to ferment), increased oxygen exposure and aeration as well as fermenting at higher temperatures. Glycerol production is also encouraged if most available acetaldehyde is made unavailable by binding with <b>bisulfite</b> molecules in the wine, but it would take a substantial amount of sulfur dioxide addition (far beyond legal limits) to prolong glycerol production beyond just these very nascent stages of fermentation.|$|E
