40|$|Excavation {{considers}} {{an imagined}} geography that is constructed from created or found objects pertinent {{to try and}} understanding one’s place in the world. The work originates from a melancholic mediation on memory; of gathering and appropriating images and artefacts to suggest an illusion that is determined by a desire for place. Bricked up doorways and windows in uninhabited spaces – appearing entirely two-dimensional – are the subjects of several photographs in the exhibition. These spaces resemble layers of strata in an archeological excavation: traces of concrete, crushed aggregate, tiles and evidence of chased services in masonry walls that look like suspended pieces of airborne rope. These black and white photographs are each photo-silkscreened with a surface image depicting a tarpaulin ‘portal’ using lustrous <b>bronze</b> <b>ink.</b> In this process the two things are compound: old and new, present and past, real and imagined. The life-size photo mural, Folly, 2014, depicts a stone wall in a type of tromp l’oeil. In a historical context mural wallpaper conventionally pictured luscious forest vistas and epic panoramas while this image gives a sense of space closing in on us. This work treats the prefabricated ruin {{as a catalyst for}} the psychological resonances implicit in architectural follies and ‘eye-catchers’ of classical structures. The illusionary power of the image behind which hidden readings and relationships are formed is central to the works in Excavation. Mirrored misalignments, structures collapsing away and into each other and photographic collages each allude to ways of thinking about illusion and perception – their content and materiality are used to articulate the relationship between physical and emotional experience...|$|E

5000|$|U.S. Post Office in San Pedro, California is a {{historic}} Streamline Moderne Post Office built in 1935 as a Works Project Administration project. Designed by Louis A. Simon and Fletcher Martin in the WPA modern style, a conservative or classicized Art Deco, the San Pedro Post Office was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. The building also formerly served as a U.S. Customs Office. The building's use of marble, bronze and milk glass are typical of 1930s architecture for U.S. government buildings. The floor tile is laid in a basket weave pattern surrounded by black marble, giving the effect of rugs on a marble floor. Some of the original <b>bronze</b> lamps and <b>ink</b> wells are still intact at the public writing desks. The mural inside the Post Office Building was painted by Fletcher Martin in 1938 and is titled [...] "Mail Transportation."http://www.wpamurals.com/californ.html Martin (born 1904) also painted WPA-era murals at the U.S. Post Office buildings in La Mesa, Texas, and Kellogg, Idaho.http://www.wpamurals.com/wpabios.html ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1973, {{with the}} {{increasing}} cost of casting, Jackson turned to making sculptures out of everyday products and polyurethane foam. The following year, she started to explore the artistic possibilities of using current technology and was provided with a copier machine by Xerox Corporation, which subsequently donated some of her works to the Smithsonian American Art Museum. Appointed artist-in-residence at the Technical University of Nova Scotia (Dalhousie University) in 1978, Jackson taught art and technology classes. She also arranged international copy art festivals and mail art exhibitions, believing that this could lead to an ideal democratic interchange between artists and the public, without regard to political, economic or cultural barriers.Jackson documented these with published catalogues including the 1985 ‘’International Mail/Copier Art Exhibition’’ catalogue which received an award of excellence from the Art Museum Association of America. The assembled works were displayed both in London in 1987 and at the Canadian Museum of Civilization in 1992 and {{became part of the}} collection of the Canadian Postal Museum.Jackson also contributed to many art exhibitions abroad including two in Italy that were organized at Giuseppe Perotti School in Turin, 1987 and 1990, and subsequently collaborated with Lidia Chiarelli and British poet Aeronwy Thomas in developing Immagine & Poesia, a project that a few years later became the international artistic literary movement.During this period she also used copiers to create bookworks which are now in various collections including the National Art Library at the Victoria and Albert Museum (London).From 1995 on, she worked exclusively with computers. Jackson’s last retrospective exhibition titled ‘’Spirit Journey / Bodies of Work’’ at the Art Gallery of Nova Scotia in 2001 included <b>bronze</b> sculptures, <b>ink</b> drawings, mixed media assemblages, photocopier art and digital paintings.|$|R
