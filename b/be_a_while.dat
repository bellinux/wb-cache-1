25|$|In 1973, the city's {{graffiti}} epidemic surged {{to levels}} never seen before; nearly every subway car was tagged with graffiti {{by the end}} of the year. It was aided by the budgetary restraints on New York City, which limited its ability to remove graffiti and perform transit maintenance. Mayor John Lindsay declared the first war on graffiti in 1972, but it would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> before the city was able and willing to dedicate enough resources to that problem to start impacting the growing subculture. The MTA tried rubbing the graffiti off with an acid solution, but maintaining the cars to keep them relatively graffiti-free was costing them around $1.3 million annually. In winter 1973, the car-washing program was stopped. In September 1974, exterior washing with an acid solution started, but the solution was found to have caused more harm than good.|$|E

500|$|Paul Kelly {{has written}} a memoir, How to Make Gravy, which was {{published}} by Penguin Books (Australia) on 22 September 2010. [...] "It's a mongrel memoir. It's a bit hard to describe at the moment. It's not traditional; it's writing around the A-Z theme – I tell stories around the song lyrics in alphabetical order. It's slow, so it will <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> coming, but I'll get there". As a companion to his memoir, he issued an 8×CD box set, A – Z Recordings, with live performances from his A – Z Tours from 2004 to 2010. The 105 tracks are listed alphabetically, and were typically performed over four nights. The set includes a booklet of photographs. The related audio book on 16×CDs has Kelly joined by Australian actors, Cate Blanchett, Russell Crowe, Judy Davis, Hugh Jackman and Ben Mendelsohn each reading a chosen chapter.|$|E

Shamrock stated {{in his autobiography}} that he was uncomfortable fighting Taktarov, as Oleg trained with the Lion's Den {{and he did not}} wish to injure his friend and teammate. In Beyond the Lion's Den, Shamrock states; [...] "In addition to being his friend, I was also trying to get him into Pancrase and if I broke his leg it would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> before he could recover and he needed the money. I figured my best chance of winning without seriously hurting him was to beat on him with punches... If I could open a cut and get him to start pouring blood, I could get a referee stoppage. It might not have been the best plan going into a fight, but considering the options it seemed like the best option available. And it turned out fine. I battered him around {{for the duration of the}} match, the bout was declared a draw and when Oleg recovered he went on to fight in Pancrase." ...|$|E
