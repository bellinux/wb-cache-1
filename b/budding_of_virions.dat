50|$|These {{proteins}} play a {{major role}} in assembly and <b>budding</b> <b>of</b> VSIV <b>virions.</b> Their main role is to aid virus assembly. They starts by shutting off host cell transcription by inhibiting mRNA nuclear export through direct interaction with the host RAE1-NUP98 complex. This inhibits interferon signaling and thus establishment of antiviral state in virus infected cells. In turn, this induces cell-rounding, cytoskeleton disorganization and apoptosis in infected cell.

40|$|The {{matrix protein}} VP 40 from Ebola virus is {{targeted}} to the plasma membrane, {{where it is}} thought to induce assembly and <b>budding</b> <b>of</b> <b>virions</b> through its association with the lipid bilayer. Ebola virus VP 40 is expressed as a monomeric molecule in solution, consisting of two loosely associated domains. Here we show that a C-terminal truncation of seven residues destabilizes the monomeric closed conformation and induces spontaneous hexamerization in solution, as indicated by chemical cross-linking and electron microscopy. Three-dimensional reconstruction of electron microscopy images shows ring-like structures consisting of the N-terminal domain along with evidence for flexibly attached C-terminal domains. In vitro destabilization of the monomer by urea treatment results in similar hexameric molecules in solution. In addition, we demonstrate that membrane association of wild-type VP 40 also induces the conformational switch from monomeric to hexameric molecules that may form the building blocks for initiation of virus assembly and budding. Such a conformational change induced by bilayer targeting may be a common feature of many viral matrix proteins and its potential inhibition may result in new anti-viral therapies...|$|E
40|$|HIV virions {{assemble}} on {{the plasma}} membrane and bud out of infected cells using interactions with endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRTs). HIV protease activation {{is essential for}} maturation and infectivity of progeny virions, however, the precise timing of protease activation {{and its relationship to}} budding has not been well defined. We show that compromised interactions with ESCRTs result in delayed <b>budding</b> <b>of</b> <b>virions</b> from host cells. Specifically, we show that Gag mutants with compromised interactions with ALIX and Tsg 101, two early ESCRT factors, have an average budding delay of ~ 75 minutes and ~ 10 hours, respectively. Virions with inactive proteases incorporated the full Gag-Pol and had ~ 60 minutes delay in budding. We demonstrate that during budding delay, activated proteases release critical HIV enzymes back to host cytosol leading to production of non-infectious progeny virions. To explain the molecular mechanism of the observed budding delay, we modulated the Pol size artificially and show that virion release delays are size-dependent and also show size-dependency in requirements for Tsg 101 and ALIX. We highlight the sensitivity of HIV to budding "on-time" and suggest that budding delay is a potent mechanism for inhibition of infectious retroviral release...|$|E
40|$|The matrix (M) protein of {{vesicular}} stomatitis virus (VSV) {{has been found}} to promote assembly and <b>budding</b> <b>of</b> <b>virions</b> as well as down-regulating of VSV transcription. Large quantities of M protein can be produced in insect cells infected with recombinant baculovirus expressing the VSV M gene under control of the polyhedrin promoter. Analysis by pulse-chase experiments and density gradient centrifugation revealed that the [35 S]methionine-labeled M protein synthesized in insect cells is released into the extracellular medium in association with lipid vesicles (liposomes). Electron microscopy and immunogold labeling showed that M protein expressed in insect cells induced the formation on plasma membrane of vesicles containing M protein, which are released from the cell surface in the form of liposomes. The baculovirus vector itself or recombinants expressing VSV glycoprotein (G) or nucleocapsid (N) protein did not produce the formation of vesicles in infected cells. The baculovirus-expressed M protein retains biological activity as demonstrated by its capacity to inhibit transcription when reconstituted with VSV nucleocapsids in vitro. These data suggest that M protein has the capacity to associate with the plasma membrane of infected cells and, in so doing, causes evagination of the membrane to form a vesicle which is released from the cell. This observation leads to the postulate, which requires further proof, that the VSV M protein can induce the formation and budding of liposomes from the cell membrane surface...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Membrane rafts {{are small}} (10 - 200 nm), heterogeneous, highly dynamic, sterol- and sphingolipid-enriched domains that compartmentalize {{cellular}} processes. Many studies have established that membrane rafts {{play an important}} role in the process of virus infection cycle and virus-associated diseases. It is well known that many viral components or virus receptors are concentrated in the lipid microdomains. Viruses are divided into four main classes, nonenveloped RNA virus, enveloped RNA virus, nonenveloped DNA virus, and enveloped DNA virus. General virus infection cycle is also classified into two sections, the early stage (entry) and the late stage (assembly and <b>budding</b> <b>of</b> <b>virion).</b> Caveola-dependent endocytosis has been investigated mostly by analysis of cell entry of the SV 40 representative of polyomaviruses. Thus, the study of membrane rafts has been partially advanced by virological researches. Membrane rafts also act as a scaffold of many cellular signal transductions. Involvement of membrane rafts in many virus-associated diseases is often responsible for up- or down-regulation of cellular signal transductions. What is the role of membrane rafts in virus replications? Viruses do not necessarily require and probably utilize membrane rafts for more efficiency in virus entry, viral genome replication, high-infective virion production, and cellular signaling activation toward advantageous virus replication. In this review, we described the involvement of membrane rafts in the virus life cycle and virus-associated diseases...|$|R
40|$|Virus budding {{from the}} basolateral domain of {{infected}} polarized cells {{could be one}} of the mechanisms underlying the quick systemic infection induced by Marburg virus (MARV). We found that MARV buds from the basolateral pole of hepatocytes and bile epithelial cells in infected guinea pigs, which leads to the release of infectious virus into the vascular system. Basolateral budding might be orchestrated by the basolaterally located MARV matrix protein VP 40, which induces a partial relocalization of MARV glycoprotein from the apical to the basolateral plasma membrane. This redistribution is a prerequisite for <b>budding</b> <b>of</b> infectious <b>virions</b> from the basolateral domain. Viruses that are released from the plasma membrane of infected cells often show asymmetrical budding in polarized epithelial cells.

40|$|Abstract: Several {{members of}} the {{cytokine}} network {{play an important role}} in controlling the replication of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in several experimental systems. Their effects can be categorized in the following three functional groups: (1) WV-inductive cytokines; (2) WV-suppressive cytokines; (3) cytokines with both activating and inhibiting capacities. Studies on the mechanism of action of these molecules have highlighted the fact that several steps of the retrovirus life cycle, from binding to <b>budding</b> <b>of</b> progeny <b>virions</b> from the infected cell, are affected by cytokines. This general concept has been recently substantiated by the discovery that certain f 3 -chemokines can act as blockers of viral entry by interfering with HIV co-receptors.

Betulinic acid derivatives were synthesized to enhance the anti-HIV activity. Among the derivatives, 3 -O-(3 ′, 3 ′-dimethylsuccinyl) betulinic acid, designated YK-FH 312, showed the highest activity against HIV-induced cytopathic effects in HIV- 1 -infected MT- 4 cells. To determine the step(s) of HIV replication affected by YK-FH 312, a syncytium formation inhibition assay in MOLT- 4 /HIV- 1 IIIB and MOLT- 4 coculture, a multinuclear-activation-of-galactosidase-indicator (MAGI) assay in MAGI-CCR 5 cells, electron microscopic observation, and a time-of-addition assay were performed. In the syncytium formation inhibition assay or in the MAGI assay for de novo infection, the compound did not show inhibitory effects against HIV replication. Conversely, no virions were detected in HIV- 1 -infected cell cultures treated with YK-FH 312 either by electron microscopic observation or by viral yield in the supernatant. In accordance with a p 24 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay of culture supernatant in the time-of-addition assay, YK-FH 312 inhibited virus expression in the supernatant when it was added 18 h postinfection. However, Western blot analysis of the cells in the time-of-addition assay revealed that the production of viral proteins in the cells was not inhibited completely by YK-FH 312. These results suggest that YK-FH 312 might affect the step(s) of virion assembly and/or <b>budding</b> <b>of</b> <b>virions,</b> and this is a novel mechanism of action of an anti-HIV compound...|$|E
40|$|Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV- 1) is {{associated}} with a variety of clinical manifestations, including tropical spastic paraparesis or HTLV- 1 -associated myelopathy (TSP/HAM). Viral detection in the central nervous system (CNS) of TSP/HAM patients demonstrates the ability of HTLV- 1 to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). To investigate viral entry into the CNS, rat brain capillary endothelial cells were exposed to human lymphocytes chronically infected by HTLV- 1 (MT 2), to lymphocytes isolated from a seropositive patient, or to a control lymphoblastoid cell line (CEM). An enhanced adhesion to and migration through brain endothelial cells in vitro was observed with HTLV- 1 -infected lymphocytes. HTLV- 1 -infected lymphocytes also induced a twofold increase in the paracellular permeability of the endothelial monolayer. These effects were associated with an increased production of tumor necrosis factor alpha by HTLV- 1 -infected lymphocytes in the presence of brain endothelial cells. Ultrastructural analysis showed that contact between endothelial cells and HTLV- 1 -infected lymphocytes resulted in a massive and rapid <b>budding</b> <b>of</b> <b>virions</b> from lymphocytes, followed by their internalization into vesicles by brain endothelial cells and apparent release onto the basolateral side, suggesting that viral particles may cross the BBB using the transcytotic pathway. Our study also demonstrates that cell-cell fusion occurs between HTLV- 1 -infected lymphocytes and brain endothelial cells, with the latter being susceptible to transient HTLV- 1 infection. These aspects may help us to understand the pathogenic mechanisms associated with neurological diseases induced by HTLV- 1 infection...|$|E
40|$|The insect-borne Bluetongue virus (BTV) is {{considered}} the prototypic Orbivirus, {{a member of the}} Reovirus family. One of the hallmarks of Orbivirus infection is the production of large numbers of intracellular tubular structures of unknown function. For BTV these structures are formed as the polymerization product of a single 64 -kDa nonstructural protein, NS 1, encoded by the viral double-stranded RNA genome segment 6. Although the NS 1 protein is the most abundant viral protein synthesized in infected cells, its function has yet to be determined. One possibility is that NS 1 tubules may be involved in the translocation of newly formed viral particles to the plasma membrane, and NS 1 -specific monoclonal antibodies have been shown to react with viral particles leaving infected cells. In the present study we generated a mammalian cell line that expresses a recombinant single-chain antibody fragment (scFv) derived from an NS 1 -specific monoclonal antibody (10 B 1) and analyzed the effect that this intracellular antibody has on BTV replication. Normally, BTV infection of mammalian cells in culture results in a severe cytopathic effect within 24 to 48 h postinfection manifested by cell rounding, apoptosis, and lytic release of virions into the culture medium. However, infection of scFv-expressing cells results in a marked reduction in the stability of NS 1 and formation of NS 1 tubules, a decrease in cytopathic effect, an increased release of infectious virus into the culture medium, and <b>budding</b> <b>of</b> <b>virions</b> from the plasma membrane. These results suggest that NS 1 tubules play a direct role in the cellular pathogenesis and morphogenesis of BTV...|$|E

Despite its importance as a pathogen, {{little is known about}} the virus structure, in part because of its intrinsic structural variability (pleiomorphy) : the primary distinction is between spherical and elongated particles, but both vary in size. Pleiomorphy has thwarted structural analysis by image reconstruction of electron micrographs based on averaging many identical particles. In this study, we used cryoelectron tomography to visualize the 3 D structures <b>of</b> 110 individual <b>virions</b> <b>of</b> the X- 31 (H 3 N 2) strain of influenza A.

Exocytosis of M protein begins 2 to 4 h posttransfection and reaches a peak by 10 to 16 h posttransfection; dye uptake studies reveal that > 97 % of cells are alive and have intact membranes at 16 h posttransfection. Density gradient centrifugation and labeling with radioactive palmitic acid revealed that the M protein is released from cells in association with lipid vesicles. Expression of M-gene deletion mutants suggests that exocytosis of M protein requires {{the presence of a}} membrane-binding site at N-terminal amino acids 1 to 50. Cells transfected with the pTM 1 plasmid containing the M gene of the temperature-sensitive mutant tsO 23 expressed ample quantities of the mutant M protein at permissive (31 degrees C) and restrictive (39 degrees C) temperatures, but the exocytosis of the mutant M protein occurred only at the permissive temperature. The tsO 23 M gene has three site-specific mutations resulting in amino acid substitutions at residues 21, 111, and 227. Expression of wild-type and mutant M genes with mutations or revertants at each of these sites resulted in exocytosis of M protein at the nonpermissive temperature only when wild-type leucine was present at residue 111, but M-protein exocytosis was restricted (to some extent even at the permissive temperature) when mutant phenylalanine was present at residue 111. Past and present data indicate that a specific structural conformation of the M protein is responsible for the formation and budding of vesicles, a property of the M protein which probably also promotes vesicular stomatitis virus assembly and <b>budding</b> <b>of</b> <b>virions</b> from host cells...|$|E
40|$|Macrophages and CD 4 + T {{cells are}} the main targets for {{productive}} human immunodeficiency virus- 1 (HIV- 1) infection in vivo. HIV- 1 transmission at immune cell synapses, such as the multi-molecular HIV- 1 -induced virological synapse (VS) formed between T cells, is a more efficient method of viral dissemination than infection by cell-free virus, with important implications for HIV- 1 prophylaxis and eradication. Infected macrophages can transfer HIV- 1 to CD 4 + T cells in a contact- dependent manner. However, the mechanism(s) of intercellular HIV- 1 transmission between primary macrophages and CD 4 + T cells are poorly defined. Here I investigate the organisation of the macrophage-T cell VS, which like the VS formed between T cells is dependent on envelope glycoprotein (Env) binding to CD 4, and is stabilised by ICAM- 1 /LFA- 1 interactions. However, unlike the T cell VS, where polarised <b>budding</b> <b>of</b> <b>virions</b> occurs at the donor cell membrane, VS-transmission from macrophages involves actin-dependent relocation of HIV- 1 contained within the macrophage virus-containing compartment. Macrophage VS-mediated transmission results in highly efficient productive T cell infection at multiplicities capable of largely overcoming antiretroviral inhibition. Compared with cell-free infection of T cells, VS-transmission by macrophages is equally susceptible to broadly neutralising antibodies (bNAbs) against gp 120, but relatively resistant to bNAbs targeting the membrane-proximal external region of gp 41, probably via steric hindrance. In a related project, I investigated how HIV- 1 -infected CD 4 + T cells might infect macrophages. Interaction of macrophages with HIV- 1 -infected CD 4 + T cells resulted in rapid phagocytic uptake of the infected T cells, which correlated with efficient productive macrophage infection. This route of transmission also permitted macrophage infection with transmitted/founder HIV- 1 clones that inefficiently replicate in macrophages following cell-free inoculation, potentially implicating macrophages in the mucosal amplification of transmitted HIV- 1. Overall, these data indicate an important role for cell-to-cell transmission between macrophages and CD 4 + T cells in various aspects of HIV- 1 pathogenesis. </p...|$|E
40|$|Retrovirus {{assembly}} {{involves a}} complex {{series of events}} in which {{a large number of}} proteins must be targeted to a point on the plasma membrane where immature viruses bud from the cell. Gag polyproteins of most retroviruses assemble an immature capsid on the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane during the budding process (C-type assembly), but a few assemble immature capsids deep in the cytoplasm and are then transported to the plasma membrane (B- or D-type assembly), where they are enveloped. With both assembly phenotypes, Gag polyproteins must be transported to the site of viral budding in either a relatively unassembled form (C type) or a completely assembled form (B and D types). The molecular nature of this transport process and the host cell factors that are involved have remained obscure. During the development of a recombinant baculovirus/insect cell system for the expression of both C-type and D-type Gag polyproteins, we discovered an insect cell line (High Five) with two distinct defects that resulted in the reduced release of virus-like particles. The first of these was a pronounced defect in the transport of D-type but not C-type Gag polyproteins to the plasma membrane. High Five cells expressing wild-type Mason-Pfizer monkey virus (M-PMV) Gag precursors accumulate assembled immature capsids in large cytoplasmic aggregates similar to a transport-defective mutant (MA-A 18 V). In contrast, a larger fraction of the Gag molecules encoded by the M-PMV C-type morphogenesis mutant (MA-R 55 W) and those of human immunodeficiency virus were transported to the plasma membrane for assembly and <b>budding</b> <b>of</b> <b>virions.</b> When pulse-labeled Gag precursors from High Five cells were fractionated on velocity gradients, they sedimented more rapidly, indicating that they are sequestered in a higher-molecular-mass complex.

These findings support the hypothesis that host cell factors are important in the process of Gag transport and in the release of enveloped viral particles...|$|E

40|$|Crimean-Congo {{hemorrhagic fever}} virus (CCHFV) {{is a member}} of the genus Nairovirus within the family Bunyaviridae, and can cause severe disease in humans with a {{fatality}} rate between 5 - 30 %. The surface glycoproteins, GN and GC, are responsible for CCHFV attachment to and entry into host cells. Additionally, they likely play critical roles in assembly and <b>budding</b> <b>of</b> <b>virions.</b> However, the mechanisms by which they mediate these events and their structural organization on the virion surface remain undefined. These glycoproteins are derived through endoproteolytic cleavage of a 1, 684 -amino-acid M RNA segment-encoded polyprotein. In order to explore the roles of GN and GC in diverse aspects of CCHFV replication, a thorough understanding of the processes that lead to their generation and subsequent interactions with other proteins is needed. In this dissertation, we have investigated the proteolytic event that defines the C terminus of the GN glycoprotein and have found that G N likely undergoes cotranslational intramembranous cleavage within its second transmembrane domain. This cleavage liberates a cell-associated nonstructural protein termed NSM, which traffics to the Golgi compartment, the site of CCHFV assembly. Sequence analysis of the transmembrane domains flanking NSM has indicated that both are candidates for signal peptidase (SPase) cleavage. Mutagenesis of the SPase cleavage site blocked N-terminal cleavage of NSM, confirming this hypothesis. Using transiently expressed M polyproteins lacking NSM, we found that gross deletion of NSM results in improper trafficking and aberrant processing of the viral glycoproteins, suggesting a possible chaperone-like role for NSM. We have also begun to probe the composition of the viral spikes by examining the oligomerization of the GC glycoprotein. We have found that GC molecules from several geographically diverse CCHFV strains existed in both monomeric and oligomeric forms, with the oligomeric form being preferentially recognized by a conformation-dependent antibody. These oligomers formed in the presence and absence of GN, and we have confirmed that the GC ectodomain is sufficient for oligomerization. Possible roles of NSM in viral assembly and GC containing oligomers in viral entry are discussed in the final chapter, along with future approaches to dissect mechanisms of entry, replication, and assembly for CCHFV. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{final step}} of {{paramyxovirus}} infection requires {{the assembly of}} viral structural components at the plasma membrane of infected cells followed by <b>budding</b> <b>of</b> <b>virions.</b> While the matrix (M) protein of some paramyxoviruses has been suggested to {{play a central role}} in the assembly and release of virus particles, the specific viral and host protein requirements are still unclear. Using Newcastle disease virus (NDV) as a prototype paramyxovirus, we explored the role of each of the NDV structural proteins in virion assembly and release. For these studies, we established a virus-like particle (VLP) system for NDV. The key viral proteins required for particle formation and the specific viral protein-protein interactions required for assembly and release of particles were explored in chapter 2. First we found that co-expression of all four proteins resulted in the release of VLPs with densities and efficiencies of release (1. 18 to 1. 16 g/cm 3 and 83. 8 %± 1. 1, respectively) similar to that of authentic virions. Expression of M protein alone, but not NP, F-K 115 Q or HN proteins individually, resulted in efficient VLP release. No combination of proteins in the absence of M protein resulted in particle release. Expression of any combination of proteins that included M protein yielded VLPs, although with different densities and efficiencies of release. To address the roles of NP, F and HN proteins in VLP assembly, the interactions of proteins in VLPs formed with different combinations of viral proteins were characterized by co-immunoprecipitation. The co-localization of M protein with cell surface F and HN proteins in cells expressing all combinations of viral proteins was characterized. Taken together, the results show that M protein is necessary and sufficient for NDV budding. Furthermore, they suggest that M protein – HN protein and M protein - NP interactions are responsible for incorporation of HN protein and NP proteins into VLPs and that F protein is incorporated indirectly due to interactions with NP and HN protein. Since the vacuolar protein sorting (VPS) system is involved in the release of several enveloped RNA viruses, chapter 3 describes studies which explored the role of the VPS system on NDV particle release. First, we characterized the effects of three dominant negative mutant proteins of the VPS pathway on particle release. Expression of dominant negative mutants of CHMP 3, Vps 4 and AIP 1 proteins inhibited M protein particle release as well as release of complete VLPs. Mutation of a YANL sequence in the NDV M protein to AANA inhibited particle release while replacement of this sequence with either of the classical late domain motifs, PTAP or YPDL, completely restored particle release. The host protein AIP 1, which binds YXXL late domain sequences, is incorporated into M protein particles. These results suggest that an intact VPS pathway is necessary for NDV VLP release and that the YANL sequence is an NDV M protein L domain. The sequence and structure of the Newcastle disease virus (NDV) fusion (F) protein are consistent with its classification as a type 1 glycoprotein. We have previously reported, however, that F protein can be detected in at least two topological forms with respect to membranes in both a cell-free protein synthesizing system containing membranes as well as infected COS- 7 cells (J. Virol. 2004 77 : 1951). One form is the classical type 1 glycoprotein while the other is a polytopic form in which approximately 200 amino acids of the amino terminal end as well as the cytoplasmic domain (CT) are translocated across membranes. Furthermore, we detected CT sequences on surfaces of F protein expressing cells and antibodies specific for these sequences inhibited red blood cell fusion to HN and F protein expressing cells suggesting a role for surface expressed CT sequences in cell-cell fusion. In chapter 4, we extended these findings and found that the alternate form of the F protein can also be detected in infected and transfected avian cells, the natural host cells of NDV. Furthermore, the alternate form of F protein was also found in virions released from both infected COS- 7 cells and avian cells by Western analysis. Mass spectrometry confirmed its presence in virions released from avian cells. Two different polyclonal antibodies raised against sequences of the CT domain of the F protein slowed plaque formation in both avian and COS- 7 cells. Antibody specific for the CT domain also inhibited single cycle infections as detected by immunofluorescence of viral proteins in infected cells. The potential roles of this alternate form of the NDV F protein in infection are discussed. Virus-like particles (VLPs) generated from different viruses have been shown to have potential as good vaccines. Chapter 5 explored the potential of NDV VLPs as a vaccine for NDV or as a vaccine vector for human pathogens. Significant quantities of NDV VLPs can be produced from tissue culture cells. These VLPs are as pure as virions prepared in eggs. In addition, some rules for incorporation of viral proteins into VLPs were also explored. We found that the cytoplasmic domain of the fusion (F) protein is necessary for its incorporation into VLPs. We found that an HN protein with an HA tag at its carboxyl terminus was incorporated into VLPs. We also found that the HN and F proteins of NDV, strain B 1, can be incorporated into VLPs with M and NP of strain AV. The demonstration of specific domains required for protein incorporation into particles is important in using NDV VLPs as a vaccine vector for important human pathogens. In conclusion, this dissertation presents results that show that the M protein plays a central role in NDV assembly and release, a finding that is consistent with findings with other paramyxoviruses. More importantly, this work extends the current knowledge of paramyxovirus assembly and release by providing the first direct evidence of interactions between paramyxovirus proteins. These interactions between viral proteins provide a rational basis for incorporation of viral proteins into particles. This work also provides a clearer understanding of the role of the host vacuolar protein sorting machinery in NDV budding. A clear understanding of virus assembly and budding process contributes to the design of strategies for therapeutic intervention and in the development of safer, more economical and effective vaccines...|$|E
40|$|The {{interaction}} of Sendai viral proteins with the membranes of infected cells during <b>budding</b> <b>of</b> progeny <b>virions</b> was studied. BHK cells infected with Sendai virus were labeled with [35 S]methionine, and the plasma membranes were purified on polycationic polyacrylamide beads. The isolated membranes were incubated with various agents which perturb protein structure to dissociate viral proteins from the membranes. Incubation of membranes with thiocyanate and guanidine removed both the M and nucleocapsid proteins. Urea (6 M) removed the nucleocapsid proteins but removed M protein {{only in the}} presence of 0. 1 or 1. 0 M KCl. In contrast, high salt concentrations alone eluted only the M protein, leaving the nucleocapsid proteins completely membrane bound. About 65 % of the M protein was eluted {{in the presence of}} 4 M KCl. The remaining membrane-associated M protein was resistant to further extraction by 4 M KCl. Thus, M protein forms two types of interaction with the membrane, one of them being a more extensive association with the membrane than the other...|$|R
40|$|The {{morphology}} {{and development}} of {{four members of the}} reticuloendotheliosis virus group were studied by transmission electron microscopy. <b>Virions</b> <b>of</b> duck spleen necrosis virus, duck infectious anemia virus, chicken syncytial virus, and reticuloendotheliosis virus strain T are sperical with a diameter of approximately 110 nm. They are covered with surface projections about 6 nm long and 10 nm in diameter. The center-to-center distance of surface projections is about 14 nm. The budding virions contain crescent-shaped electron-dense cores 73 nm in diameter with electron-lucent centers. After release <b>of</b> the <b>virions</b> the cores apparently become condensed to 67 nm in diameter.

40|$|Negative {{staining}} <b>of</b> <b>virions</b> {{and isolated}} nucleoids from avian myeloblastosis virus, murine leukemia virus, murine mammary tumor virus, and {{feline leukemia virus}} reveals common internal structures. The majority <b>of</b> <b>virions</b> that are penetrated by phosphotungstate show spherical nucleoids with no apparent symmetry. In a small percentage <b>of</b> <b>virions,</b> two distinctive structures are found: (i) single strands (3 to 5 nm in diameter) which are presumed to be the nucleoprotein and are found randomly oriented throughout the viral interior and (ii) helical structures (7 to 9 nm in diameter) which contain these nucleoprotein strands and are observed at {{the periphery of the}} nucleoid. The finding of helical nucleocapsid segments at the periphery of the nucleoid, as well as the hollow spherical structure observed in thin section <b>of</b> <b>budding</b> <b>virions,</b> has led to the hypothesis that the nucleocapsid <b>of</b> the freshly <b>budded</b> oncornavirus is supercoiled as a hollow sphere. This symmetry, however, is considered transient, as the internal structure of the extracellular virus undergoes a conformational rearrangement; thus, due to structural instability, the nucleocapsid uncoils and the nucleoprotein strands fill the interior <b>of</b> the <b>virion.</b> The extracellular virion is therefore considered degenerate in respect to symmetry, explaining the difficulty in detecting a helical nucleocapsid...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{matrix protein}} (M) of {{vesicular}} stomatitis virus {{is responsible for}} the <b>budding</b> <b>of</b> newly formed <b>virions</b> out <b>of</b> host cells. In vitro, it has been shown to self-associate, a property that {{may be related to the}} role of M in virus assembly but also prevents crystallization. Using limited proteolysis by thermolysin, we have isolated and characterized two soluble fragments of the protein that remain noncovalently associated. The digestion product does not self-associate nor is it recruited in aggregates formed by intact M molecules. These results identify a peptide, located at the surface of the protein and disorganized by thermolysin cleavage, responsible for M self-association. The thermolysin-resistant core of M has been crystallized and the crystals diffract to 2 -Å resolution...|$|R
