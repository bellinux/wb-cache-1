The novelty of the algorithm is its generality: there is no restriction {{on the degree of}} the <b>B-spline</b> <b>surfaces</b> or on the dimension of the domain. Constructing an evaluation graph allows us to reuse partial results and hence, to decrease computation time. Computation time gets reduced even more by making choices in unfolding the recurrence relation of simplex splines such that the evaluation graph becomes smaller.

The crucial point of the problem is the parametrization of the given points, where earlier approaches introduced a base surface and the spatial points were mapped onto this surface to gain parameter values. The base surface can be created automatically only in the most simple cases but generally additonal data used to find it. Our method applies an artificial neural network to solve this problem using only the original data set and giving an alternative way to find the best fitted <b>B-spline</b> <b>surface.</b> Keywords: surface reconstruction, <b>B-spline</b> <b>surface,</b> artificial neural network, self-organizing ma...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a computer-based method for modelling the blades of horizontal axis turbines using <b>B-spline</b> <b>surfaces.</b> The method uses common design parameters for {{the geometry of}} this type of turbine and produces a final set of <b>B-spline</b> <b>surfaces</b> for the geometry of the blades {{that can be used for}} the visualisation, calculations and construction of the rotor surface. The method begins with the creation of a 3 D set of offsets that constitute the rotor blades based on a 2 D definition of the airfoils, which is normally used in the design of different stations along the rotor blade. It also uses geometrical parameters such as the skew and rake or coning distribution. The method stresses the fitting of the blade?s leading edge, which has a significant impact on the properties of the rotor and separately models the trailing edge of the blades. <b>B-spline</b> curves and <b>surfaces</b> are used in this method because they are widely used in CAD-CAM software products and can be easily exported to other programs...|$|R

40|$|B-spline {{representation}} {{is one of}} the main methods for free-form surface modeling and has become the standard for CAD systems. However, in Virtual Reality (VR) environment, when a <b>B-spline</b> <b>surface</b> deforms, the blending functions need to be continuously computed. The high computational cost of continuously calculating the blending functions for merging, collision detection and physics-based deformation system, while the model is deforming, restricts the use of B-spline representation in a VR environment. This paper presents an alternative methodology to represent <b>B-spline</b> <b>surface</b> patches for an interactive VR environment. A uniformly discretized <b>B-spline</b> <b>surface</b> patch can be represented by a set of control points and two precalculated B-spline blending matrices. The proposed technique exploits the fact that these B-spline blending matrices are independent of the position of control points and therefore can be pre-calculated. The blending matrices enable the algorithm to merge <b>B-spline</b> <b>surface</b> patches, accurately check the collision, and generate nodes for the mass spring system to determine deformation using the physics-based model. This technique does away with the need to calculate computationally intensive blending functions for the Bspline surfaces, and inverse of large matrices during the run-time.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a new <b>B-spline</b> <b>surface</b> {{reconstruction}} approach, called dynamic surface reconstruction, aiming to close the sensingand-modeling loop in 3 D digitization. At its core, this approach uses a recursive least squares method, the Kalman filter, to dynamically reconstruct the <b>B-spline</b> <b>surface</b> as the surface data are acquired. That is, the acquired data are dynamically incorporated into the surface model and the updated surface model is then used to dynamically guide further data acquisition. It thus enables a closed-loop shape sensing-and-modeling methodology for 3 D digitization. Our technical contribution lies on the exploitation of the recursive nature of the Kalman filter for <b>B-spline</b> <b>surface</b> reconstruction. This enables dynamic parameterization of data points, dynamic determination of next optimal sensing locations, and low-discrepancy based efficient sensing and reconstruction. Experiments demonstrate that such dynamic surface reconstruction leads to more efficient data acquisition and better surface reconstruction...|$|E

40|$|Geometric {{constraints}} {{have proved}} to be helpful for shape modeling. Moreover, they are efficient aids in controlling deformations and enhancing animation realism. The present paper addresses the deformation of <b>B-spline</b> <b>surfaces</b> while constraining the volume enclosed by the surface. Both uniform and non-uniform frameworks are considered. The use of level-of-detail (LoD) editing allows the preservation of fine details during coarse deformations of the shape. The key contribution of this paper is the computation of the volume with respect to the appropriate basis for LoD editing: the volume is expressed through all levels of resolution as a trilinear form and recursive formulas are developed to make the computation efficient. The volume constrained is maintained through a minimization process for which we develop closed solutions. Real-time deformations are reached thanks to sparse data structures and efficient algorithms. keywords: <b>B-spline</b> <b>surfaces,</b> constrained deformation, volume preserving, levelof-detail editing, multiresolution analysis. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the problem of}} three dimensional surface reconstruction of non polyhedral objects through series of images taken from a moving camera. We propose a direct method of surface reconstruction {{which is based on}} regularized uniform bicubic <b>B-spline</b> <b>surface</b> patches [35].
