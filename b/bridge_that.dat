5|$|According to archaeological {{and genetic}} evidence, North and South America {{were the last}} continents {{in the world with}} human habitation. During the Wisconsin glaciation, 50,000–17,000 years ago, falling sea levels allowed people to move across the Bering land <b>bridge</b> <b>that</b> joined Siberia to north west North America (Alaska). Alaska was {{ice-free}} because of low snowfall, allowing a small population to exist. The Laurentide ice sheet covered most of Canada, blocking nomadic inhabitants and confining them to Alaska (East Beringia) for thousands of years.|$|E

5|$|The bronze quoll (D. spartacus) is {{the only}} mammal found in the Trans Fly ecoregion, but not in {{northern}} Australia.
