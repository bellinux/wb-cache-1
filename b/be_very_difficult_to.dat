5|$|The greater melampitta is {{reported}} to be very shy and wary, but also inquisitive and may approach people sitting quietly to investigate. It is usually revealed by its calls, and can <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> locate if it is not calling.|$|E
5|$|Another {{solution}} to {{the vulnerability of the}} RAF bombers was to fly at night, which was taken up as the primary tactic of Bomber Command. The Mk. X proved to <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> read at night and bombers that carried it were quickly refitted with the earlier Mk. VII or Mk. IX sight. The Norden was unable to work at night at all; the bomb aimer had to locate the target long in advance of the drop point using a built-in telescope and targets were simply not visible at the required distances in low light.|$|E
5|$|Flight tests {{revealed}} difficult handling, {{and a lack}} of power due to the non-availability of the intended ACh-30BF engines. Flight tests continued without the waist guns and their gunner until the ACh-30BF's were fitted between May and July 1944. Despite modifications, the aircraft still suffered from poor controllability at low speeds and high weights as well as very poor gliding performance. Throughout the flight tests the engines performed satisfactorily in the air, but were found to <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> start in low ambient temperatures and had slow response to throttle movements. Further development was canceled.|$|E

5|$|Because it cannot {{compete with}} {{established}} plants, great mullein {{is no longer}} considered a serious agricultural weed and is easily crowded out in cultivation, except in areas where vegetation is sparse to begin with, such as Californian semi-desertic areas of the eastern Sierra Nevada. In such ecological contexts, it crowds out native herbs and grasses; its tendency to appear after forest fires also disturbs the normal ecological succession. Although not an agricultural threat, its presence can <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> completely eradicate, and is especially problematic in overgrazed pastures. The species is legally listed as a noxious weed in the American state of Colorado (Class C) and Hawaii, and the Australian state of Victoria (regionally prohibited in the West Gippsland region, and regionally controlled in several others).|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the tree}} of heaven's weedy habit, landowners and other organisations often resort to various methods of control {{in order to keep}} its populations in check. For example, the city of Basel in Switzerland has an {{eradication}} program for the tree. It can <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> eradicate, however. Means of eradication can be physical, thermal, managerial, biological or chemical. A combination of several of these can be most effective, though they must of course be compatible. All have some positive and negative aspects, but the most effective regimen is generally a mixture of chemical and physical control. It involves the application of foliar or basal herbicides in order to kill existing trees, while either hand pulling or mowing seedlings in order to prevent new growth.|$|E
5|$|Cracked tooth {{syndrome}} {{refers to}} a highly variable set of pain-sensitivity symptoms that may accompany a tooth fracture, usually sporadic, sharp pain that occurs during biting or with release of biting pressure, or relieved by releasing pressure on the tooth. The term is falling into disfavor and {{has given way to}} the more generalized description of fractures and cracks of the tooth, which allows for the wide variations in signs, symptoms, and prognosis for traumatized teeth. A fracture of a tooth can involve the enamel, dentin, and/or pulp, and can be orientated horizontally or vertically. Fractured or cracked teeth can cause pain via several mechanisms, including dentin hypersensitivity, pulpitis (reversible or irreversible), or periodontal pain. Accordingly, there is no single test or combination of symptoms that accurately diagnose a fracture or crack, although when pain can be stimulated by causing separation of the cusps of the tooth, it's highly suggestive of the disorder. Vertical fractures can <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> identify because the crack can rarely be probed or seen on radiographs, as the fracture runs in the plane of conventional films (similar to how the split between two adjacent panes of glass is invisible when facing them).|$|E
