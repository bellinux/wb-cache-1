500|$|IGN's regular Fringe {{reviewer}} Ramsey Isler {{rated the}} episode 8/10. He compared the plot to Lost, remarking [...] "Apparently one thoroughly confusing and unnecessarily convoluted TV series wasn't enough... <b>But</b> <b>hey,</b> I understand why J.J. and his Fringe collaborators... {{might have done}} this. They had kind of written themselves into a corner {{where one of the}} universes had to go, and they couldn't stretch that storyline out forever. A restart like this {{is a good way to}} allow themselves room to write something new, even if it may require some clever thinking to explain themselves out of this situation adequately." [...] Isler had trouble rating the finale, noting that he had to see how the events are explained in the fourth season before he can make a complete judgment.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} to [...] "Evicted!" [...] {{was largely}} positive. Cam Shea of IGN named Marceline's introduction in [...] "Evicted!" [...] as the fourth best {{moment in the}} series' first season. He wrote that [...] "sure, in this episode she evicts Finn and Jake from their home ... <b>but</b> <b>hey,</b> {{this is the first}} time we meet her and she's awesome." [...] He later wrote that [...] "Marceline = best". Marceline has gone on to be one of the most popular characters with the Adventure Time fan base, and after the release of [...] "Evicted!" [...] her popularity grew enormously. Ward later noted that he felt [...] "good about that. It's nice". Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club named the episode one of the ten additional installments of the series that illustrates that [...] "emotional complexity" [...] lies [...] "beneath Adventure Times weirdness".|$|E
500|$|In his 2006 book Watching with The Simpsons: Television, Parody, and Intertextuality, Jonathan Gray {{analyzed}} the many advertisement parodies featured in The Simpsons. He commented on [...] "Bart to the Future", writing: [...] "As if ads in children's toys or in churches are not enough, in 'Bart to the Future,' an episode {{in which an}} Indian shaman at a casino treats Bart to a vision of his future, even his vision is interrupted when future-Bart says, 'I guess I am an embarrassment,' and a ghost responds, 'You sure are. <b>But,</b> <b>hey,</b> there's an embarrassment of riches at the Caesar's Pow-Wow Indian Casino. You can bet on it!' Here [...] The Simpsons uses parody with great effect, not only to illustrate how annoyingly and disrespectfully ads infringe on any territory, but also to mock their logic and rhetoric." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Revolver" [...] {{was written}} by Madonna, Carlos Battey, Steven Battey, Lil Wayne, Justin Franks and Brandon Kitchen, and {{produced}} by Madonna and DJ Frank E. In an interview with Hiphopupdate.com, Frank E recalled that {{he had gone to}} the recording session two hours before his scheduled meeting with Madonna to set up and give the audio files to the recording engineer, and he said that the ensuing wait was incredibly nerve-racking for him. After Madonna arrived, they recorded her vocals and the song was finished the next day. [...] Reminiscing about the session, he said: [...] "I will never forget the feeling of leaving that session after vocal producing Madonna, and thinking to myself, 'It can’t it really get any harder than this.' I've taken that mentality into every other session I've been in, and it's helped me make the session and song more of a success. Unfortunately, the mix sounded like crap and the song flopped, <b>but</b> <b>hey,</b> you win some and you lose some." ...|$|E
500|$|Andrew Martin of Prefix Magazine complimented the remix stating: [...] " [...] might replace André 3000's {{typically}} great guest feature {{with one}} from J. Cole, <b>but</b> <b>hey,</b> anyone can sound good over this beat. And not only that, but Cole's vocals, however brief, are a welcome complement." [...] Making reference to its music video, Entertainment Weeklys Erin Strecker commented: [...] "I'm assuming it was shot mid-summer, {{which is when}} this really should have been put out. Releasing this track {{at the end of}} October seems like an odd choice, as the video involves a grillout and trailer-park pool party that would have sparkled mid-July." [...] The remix was nominated in the category for Best Collaboration at the 2012 BET Awards. For the week ending November 5, 2011, [...] "Party" [...] debuted at number two on the South Korean International Singles Chart, selling 85,143 digital downloads. It became the seventy third best-selling single in South Korea in 2011.|$|E

Jason Lipshutz of Billboard said [...] "Loser Like Me" [...] is [...] "a sunny pop track that finds Lea Michele and Cory Monteith railing against conformity and celebrating their individuality in their verses". Other cast member lyrics include the lyric [...] "You may think I'm a freak show", responded to by Naya Rivera with the spoken [...] "I don't care". The song features self-empowerment lyrics which revolve around revenge fantasies, such as in Monteith's lines - [...] "I could be a superstar / I'll see you when you wash my car". According to Melinda Newman of HitFix the song is about [...] "being a loser now, but turning in to a winner now who never, ever looks back". Aly Semigran of MTV News said the lyrics of the [...] "peppy pop ditty" [...] keep [...] "in tune with the themes of the show".|$|E

500|$|Cara Kelly of The Washington Post {{gave the}} show a mixed review; {{although}} it was [...] "revolutionary" [...] after Janet Jackson's wardrobe malfunction, it was a [...] "pathetic attempt at a comeback". According to Lou Harry of the Indianapolis Business Journal, Madonna lacked focus and energy and the audience response was lukewarm. Harry called the show an [...] "awkward celebration", but praised its overall production. USA Todays Elyssa Gardner wrote, [...] "Madonna herself, stylish but hardly provocative in tailored tops and skirts that showed off her yoga-toned gams, delivered [...] and other flourishes with a winking sense of humor". David Zurawik of The Baltimore Sun called the show [...] "Madonna's zombie halftime", criticizing its song choices and overall concept: [...] " [...] acting as if she's almost singing. I say almost, because {{there is not a}} whit of artistic aspiration in the star performer or the production as far I can tell. <b>But</b> <b>hey,</b> that's our sad-sack, super-sized, gross American culture these days, isn't it. And it is perfectly suited for empty Super Bowl half-time spectacle".|$|E
500|$|Marceline has {{attracted}} positive critical attention. Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club praised {{that the fact}} that she is one [...] "of this show’s most tragic characters". He later wrote that her addition [...] "was a major turning point for the series, introducing a hip, adventure-loving female to the cast who can hold her own against Finn and Jake and also has a strong connection to Ooo’s past." [...] Furthermore, he noted that [...] "she’s been at the center of some of the show’s most emotional episodes", and [...] "beyond her dramatic value, Marceline tends to just make every episode better" [...] because [...] "her writers clearly enjoy writing scenes for her". Susana Polo of The Mary Sue referred to the character as [...] "one of the radder characters" [...] in the series. Cam Shea of IGN named Marceline's introduction in [...] "Evicted!" [...] as the fourth best moment in the series' first season. He wrote that [...] "sure, in this episode she evicts Finn and Jake from their home ... <b>but</b> <b>hey,</b> this is the first time we meet her and she's awesome." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{features}} {{comic book}} writer Stan Lee as himself. In John Ortved's book , Lee {{stated that he}} attended the episode's table read, and {{was impressed with the}} size and quality of the creative staff, who all sat around the conference table. Lee recalled in 2009, [...] "Honestly, there was so much genuine talent around that table that you could have cut it with a knife." [...] Afterward, Lee met the writers of the show, and was pleasantly surprised to find that they were familiar with his work and he was with theirs. Afterward, executive producer Al Jean took Lee out to lunch, who he called [...] "one of the nicest and most unassuming guys you could hope to meet." [...] Lee continued, [...] "Of course, I probably said something wrong to him, or he didn't like my table manners, because I haven't been invited back for another guest shot. <b>But</b> <b>hey</b> one lives in hope." [...] The voice actor who plays Angry Dad in the episode was portrayed by Dan Castellaneta, who also does the voice for Homer among other characters in the series. The design of the character is also based on Castellaneta.|$|E

Jocelyn Vena, from MTV News, commented that [...] "Sleazy" [...] "fits right in with [...] party-anthem discography". Daniel Brockman of The Boston Phoenix wrote that the song contains [...] "tribal anti-bourgeois bounce". Bill Lamb from About.com noted that Bangladesh's production [...] "pumps up the hard edge and club readiness".

In announcing the rule, NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman said, [...] "The elimination of these types of hits should significantly reduce the number of injuries, including concussions, without adversely affecting the level of physicality in the game." [...] Earlier, Bettman appeared on Leafs Lunch on Mojo 640 in Toronto to discuss the Cooke hit on Savard. [...] "I was very unhappy and upset with that hit," [...] said Bettman.

Having waited for the moment [...] "for a long time," [...] {{it turned out to be}} [...] "a big pay-off." [...] She added: But I was a little nervous because this was definitely a very, very special episode. That was the biggest challenge to me; I was going in there knowing, 'This is the moment.' I kept having to make myself laugh and leave set and play with my friends in the hair and makeup room and just sort of try to view the day as though it was just an average taping day because the last thing those scenes needed from my character's perspective was that sense of gravity, that feeling of, 'This is so important.'

Jason Anderson of Canada's CBC News called the film [...] "muddled" [...] with a [...] "hurried and half-baked" [...] climax, and said, [...] "Beyond the pleasure of seeing Duchovny and Anderson back in action and back on form," [...] the film [...] "offers little to either the longtime fans or newcomers". Jan Stuart from the Los Angeles Times commented, [...] "The X-Files was a load of malarkey. But it was thoughtful malarkey and compulsively watchable.
