In doing so, we summarize the general arbitrage-free valuation framework for counterparty risk adjustments in presence of bilateral default risk, including the default of the investor. We illustrate the symmetry in the valuation and show that the adjustment involves a long position in a put option plus a short position in a call option, both with zero strike and written on the residual net present value of the contract at the relevant default times. We allow for correlation between the default times of the investor and counterparty, and for correlation of each with the underlying risk factor, namely interest rates. We also analyze the often neglected impact of credit spread volatility.

40|$|How does an {{oil boom}} affect the forest cover of {{tropical}} oil exporting-countries? Are they {{more or less}} likely than non-oil countries to experience forest loss? What macro-economic linkages and policies are decisive? This article summarises research on land-use changes in eight tropical developing countries. Our country-comparative approach reveals that the direct oil impacts on forests are unquestionably subordinate compared to oil's derived macroeconomic impact. In most cases, oil wealth indirectly but significantly comes to protect tropical forests. The core mechanism here is that oil rents cause 'Dutch Disease', decreasing the price-competitiveness of agriculture and logging, which strongly diminishes pressures for deforestation and forest degradation. But domestic policy responses to oil wealth are also vital determinants for the forest outcome. When governments use most oil wealth for urban spending sprees, this reinforces the core effect by pulling more labor out of land-using and forest-degrading activities. Yet, in extreme cases when boosting oil revenues finance large road-construction programs or frontier-colonization projects, the core forest-protective effect of oil wealth can be reversed. Repeated currency devaluation and import protection of heavily land-using domestic sectors also contribute to increased forest pressures. These conclusions have ample policy implications, reaching beyond the group of tropical oil countries. Other international capital transfers, like <b>bilateral</b> <b>credits,</b> aid or debt relief can have similar impacts. These measures will alleviate pressures on forests, unless they come to bolster specific forest-detrimental policies. This also provides some suggestions on what forest-friendly safeguards could realistically be taken {{in the design of}} structural adjustment programs, considering the important trade-offs between development and conservation objectives...|$|R

40|$|We propose an {{algorithm}} {{to model}} contagion in the interbank market via what we term the credit quality channel. In existing models on contagion via interbank credit, external shocks to banks often {{spread to other}} banks only {{in case of a}} default. In contrast, shocks are transmitted via asset devaluations and deteriorations in the credit quality in our algorithm: First, the probability of default (PD) of those banks directly affected by some shock increases. This increases the expected loss of the credit portfolios of the initially affected banks' counterparties, thereby reducing the counterparties' regulatory capital ratio. From a logistic regression, we estimate the increase in the counterparties' PD due to a reduced capital ratio. Their increased PDs in turn affect the counterparties' counterparties, and so on. This coherent and flexible framework is applied to <b>bilateral</b> interbank <b>credit</b> exposure of the entire German banking system in order to examine policy questions. For that purpose, we propose to measure the potential cost of contagion of a given shock scenario by the aggregated regulatory capital loss computed in our algorithm...|$|R

Our focus is on an industry characterized by 'relationship banking', i. e. a setting involving repeated, <b>bilateral</b> <b>credit</b> transactions between banks and borrowers. A key feature of relationship banking is the intertemporal accumulation of proprietary borrower-specific information in the hands of the bank, and the consequent creation of informational rents. To the extent that these rents are shared by the bank and the borrower, both parties see a value in continuing their relationship. The desire to protect such relationships affects the bank's asset portfolio choice. ...|$|E

Some well-known risky valuation models in the markets can be viewed as special cases of this framework. We introduce the concept of comvariance (or comrelation) into the area of credit risk modeling to capture the default relationship among three or more parties. Accounting for default correlations and comrelations becomes important, especially during the credit crisis. Moreover, we find that collateralization works well for financial instruments subject to <b>bilateral</b> <b>credit</b> risk, but fails for ones subject to multilateral credit risk. ...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we focus}} on the {{interconnectedness}} of banks and the price they pay for liquidity. We assess how the concentration of credit relationships and the position of a bank in the network topology of the system influence the bank's ability to meet its liquidity demand. We use quarterly data of <b>bilateral</b> interbank <b>credit</b> exposures between all German banks from 2000 to 2008 to measure interbank relationships and the network characteristics. We match these data with the bids placed by the individual banks in the European Central Bank's (ECB) weekly repo auctions. The bids measure each bank's willingness to pay for liquidity since they had variable rate tenders with a 'pay-your-bid' price. Controlling for bank characteristics and the daily fulfillment of reserve requirements, we find that banks with a more diversified borrowing structure in the interbank market bid significantly less aggressively and pay a lower price for liquidity in the ECB's main refinancing operations. These findings suggest that incentives to diversify bank liquidity risk dominate the benefits of private information. When the network position of the bank is taken into account, we find that central lenders in the money market bid more aggressively in the auctions...|$|R

40|$|The LVTS is an {{electronic}} network for sending and receiving large-value payments. It {{is expected to}} become operational {{in the first half}} of 1999. Major chartered banks and other large deposit-taking institutions will provide access to the system for their clients in the financial, corporate, and government sectors. Canada's LVTS exceeds world standards for risk control in large-value systems. The author explains how this is achieved through the netting, <b>bilateral</b> and multilateral <b>credit</b> limits, collateral, loss-sharing procedures used in the event of a default and, as a last resort, a guarantee by the Bank of Canada. The LVTS gives participating institutions certainty of settlement for their LVTS positions every day, even if one or more participants default. This greatly reduces systemic risk in the financial system. Moreover, the LVTS supports finality of payment; that is, it makes funds unconditionally and irrevocably available to the receiver. Finality is highly desirable when the amount of the payment is substantial, or when exact timing is critical. Since the LVTS will carry the great majority of the value of all payments in Canada, it should be considered the core of the national payments system. ...|$|R

System-wide collateral demand is increased significantly by the application of initial margin requirements for dealers, whether or not the CDS are cleared.
