40|$|The direct write {{technology}} {{provides an}} interesting opportunity for plugging <b>blind</b> <b>via</b> <b>holes</b> {{as a more}} precise alternative to currently used screen printing processes. This technology provides a complete, void-less filling of the via and fabrication of the interconnects extending from the via in one single step. After deposition, the material is heat treated (sintered) to densify into a highly conductive solid. Sintering is usually accomplished by laser treatment. Some aspects of this relatively new technology, especially these related to {{the relationships between the}} laser sintering process and the deposited material properties are still largely unexplored. This paper presents experimental results for the microscale electrical resistance of two silver inks deposited by a direct write method and sintered with a continuous wave Nd:YAG laser. The resistance of the deposited and sintered silver lines and the resistance of the material in the plugged <b>via</b> <b>holes</b> was mapped by the advanced micro four-point probe technique. Results showed that higher laser powers reduce significantly the resistance of the silver inks. The importance of the deposited material sinterability is also emphasized.

To get the <b>blind</b> <b>via</b> metallized a direct electroplating process has been put forward by the way of a inducing CO 2 laser beam irradiating the copper in the bottom of <b>blind</b> <b>via.</b> The method for direct electroplating of copper onto a non-copper platable layer has been investigated in <b>blind</b> <b>via</b> metalization.

Mean time to failure (MTF) of the E IK for the tapered via chains is one order of magn i tude shorter than that for the vertical via chains, although the step coverage of the A i-S i=Cu films in the vias is improved by controlling the slope angle of the <b>via</b> <b>hole</b> for the tapered via.

The MHEMTs were stressed at a drain voltage of 3 V for 36 hrs, {{as well as}} undergoing a thermal storage test at 250 ?C for 48 hrs. The drain current density of the MHEMTs at zero gate bias dropped about 12. 5 % after either the thermal storage test or DC stress. The gate leakage current of the MHET devices with thermal storage was much {{higher than that of}} devices after DC stress. In the latter case, significant gate sinking was observed by transmission electron microscopy. The main degradation mechanism during thermal storage was reaction of the Ohmic contact with the underlying semiconductor. AlGaN/GaN high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) were used to detect c-erbB- 2, an important biomarker for breast cancer early detection. The Au gated region of the HEMT was functionalized with thioglycolic acid and then used to immobilize the c-erbB- 2 antibodies. The source-drain current (Ids) showed a clear dependence on the c?erbB- 2 antigen concentration in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution. The limit of detection (LOD) was 0. 25 ?g/ml, which is less than the c-erbB- 2 antigen concentration present in both healthy people and people with breast cancer. This approach showed the promise of early stage breast cancer screening and pre-clinical disease diagnosis by rapid, noninvasive and portable electronic biological sensors based on AlGaN/GaN HEMT technology. Thioglycolic acid functionalized Au-gated AlGaN/GaN based HEMTs were also used to detect mercury (II) ions. The source-drain current of the HEMT sensors monotonically decreased with the mercury (II) ion concentration from 1. 5 times 10 ? 8 to 4 times 10 ? 8 M. The source-drain current reached equilibrium around 15 ? 20 sec after the concentrated Hg ion solution was added to the gate region of the HEMT sensors. The effectiveness of the thioglycolic acid functionalization was evaluated with a surface contact angle study. The results suggested that portable, fast response, and wireless-based heavy metal ion detectors can be realized with AlGaN/GaN HEMT-based sensors.

The 70 ?m deep through-wafer backside <b>via</b> <b>holes</b> with a diameter of 50 ?m were etched by deep Si reactive ion etching system on the backside of AlGaN/GaN HEMTs. The pulsed Cu electroplating process was used to fill up the etched vias with Cu. Mechanical polishing was then performed to planarize the Cu layer. This approach is attractive for increasing the effective thermal conductivity of the composite substrate for high power device applications.
