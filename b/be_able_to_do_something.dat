500|$|Poole was {{inspired}} to make the film after he went with some friends to see a film called Highway Hustler. After watching the film, he said to a friend, [...] "This is the worst, ugliest movie I've ever seen! Somebody oughta <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> better than this." [...] Poole was convinced that he was that somebody; [...] "I wanted [...] a film that gay people could look at and say, 'I don't mind being gay - it's beautiful to see those people do what they're doing.'" [...] Having {{enlisted the help of}} his lover, Peter Fisk, and another man, Poole first shot a ten-minute segment entitled Bayside.|$|E
500|$|Burton {{insisted that}} the film be bloody, as he felt stage {{versions}} of the play which {{cut back on the}} bloodshed robbed it of its power. For him, [...] "Everything is so internal with Sweeney that [...] is like his emotional release. It's more about catharsis than it is a literal thing." [...] Producer Richard D. Zanuck said that [...] " [...] had a very clear plan that he wanted to lift that up into a surreal, almost Kill Bill kind of stylization. We had done tests and experiments with the neck slashing, with the blood popping out. I remember saying to Tim, 'My God, do we dare do this?'" [...] On set, the fake blood was colored orange to render correctly on the desaturated color film used, and crew members wore bin liners to avoid getting stained while filming. This macabre tone made some studios nervous, and it was not until Warner Bros., DreamWorks and Paramount had signed up for the project that the film's $50 million budget was covered. Burton said [...] "the studio was cool about it and they accepted it because they knew what the show was. Any movie is a risk, but it is nice to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> like that that doesn't fit into the musical or slasher movie categories." ...|$|E

3000|$|... {{learners}} {{can be said}} to {{have learned}} something when three conditions are satisfied. They must <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> on demand, something they could not do before.

And they must <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it well. Assessment of learning should be directed towards gathering evidence for drawing inferences about capability under these conditions, not the scaffolded conditions.|$|R

2500|$|The words, [...] "Lift a Stone" [...] {{are used}} instead to {{substitute}} capability. With this in mind, essentially {{the question is}} asking if God is incapable, so the real question would be, [...] "Is God capable of being incapable?" [...] If God is capable of being incapable, it means that He is incapable, because He {{has the potential to}} not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something.</b> Conversely, if God is incapable of being incapable, then the two inabilities cancel each other out, making God have the capability to do something.|$|E
2500|$|The boat's {{progress}} {{down the}} side of the ship was slow and difficult. The pulleys were covered in fresh paint and the lowering ropes were stiff, causing them to stick repeatedly as the boat was lowered in jerks towards the water. One of those watching the boat being lowered, Dr. Washington Dodge, felt [...] "overwhelmed with doubts" [...] that he might be subjecting his wife and son to greater danger aboard the boat than if they had remained on Titanic. Ismay sought to spur those lowering the boat to greater urgency by calling out repeatedly: [...] "Lower away!" [...] This resulted in Lowe losing his temper: [...] "If you'll get the hell out of the way, I'll <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something!</b> You want me to lower away quickly? You'll have me drown the lot of them!" [...] The humiliated Ismay retreated up the deck. In the end, the boat was launched safely.|$|E
