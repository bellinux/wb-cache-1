50|$|It {{has since}} been {{established}} that the rocks {{that make up the}} Witwatersrand Ridge dip downwards and southwards to form the largely underground “Witwatersrand Basin” which covers an elliptical area with a 300 km long major axis from Evander in the north-east to Theunissen in the south-west, and 150 km wide stretching from Steynsrus in the south-east to Coligny in the north-west, with a small subsidiary basin at Kinross. Gold occurs only along the northern and western margins of this basin, but not in a continuous band. The gold bearing rocks are limited to 6 sites where Archean rivers from the north and west formed fan deltas, with many braided channels, before flowing into the “Witwatersrand Sea” to the south, where the earlier sediments that form the older rocks of the Witwatersrand Supergroup had been deposited. Some of these gold <b>bearing</b> <b>fan</b> deltas are now at depths of 4 km below the surface.Although many of the older mines, around Johannesburg, are now nearly exhausted, the Witwatersrand Basin still produces most of South Africa's gold and much of the total world output. Silver, uranium, and iridium are recovered as gold-refining by-products.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In [SH 08] we {{introduced}} {{a method for}} the calculation and visualization of the whole TMA solution space. So, not only the best TMA solution, but also other solution areas with high probability can be seen. If by sensor data fusion (SDF) techniques measurements of the same or different type(s), or constraints to kinematic parameters are associated to a target, one expects an improvement in the TMA result. This influence on the TMA solution space can be made visible by the described method and is substantiated by various examples. Finally, we show, that the method is able to visualize the observability, which can be gained {{in the case of}} a missing own manoeuvre by exploiting a target manoeuvre instead. 1 Calculation of the TMA Solution Space Let’s assume, that a sensor, e. g. a Flank Array (FA) on a submarine tracks a target and delivers prefiltered bearings B 1,…,Bn together with their time references t 1,…,tn.

40|$|As {{commonly}} used forced convection air cooling devices in electronics, cooling fans are crucial for guaranteeing {{the reliability of}} electronic systems. In a cooling <b>fan</b> assembly, <b>fan</b> <b>bearing</b> failure is a major failure mode that causes excessive vibration, noise, reduction in rotation speed, locked rotor, failure to start, and other problems; therefore, {{it is necessary to}} conduct research on the health assessment of cooling <b>fan</b> <b>bearings.</b> This paper presents a vibration-based <b>fan</b> <b>bearing</b> health evaluation method using comblet filtering and exponentially weighted moving average. A new health condition indicator (HCI) for <b>fan</b> <b>bearing</b> degradation assessment is proposed. In order to collect the vibration data for validation of the proposed method, a cooling fan accelerated life test was conducted to simulate the lubricant starvation of <b>fan</b> <b>bearings.</b> A comparison between the proposed method and methods in previous studies (i. e., root mean square, kurtosis, and fault growth parameter) was carried out to assess the performance of the HCI.

40|$|Modulated {{disturbances}} {{are often}} produced by noise sources in rotating machinery such as gears, <b>bearings</b> and <b>fans.</b> Such disturbances carry frequency side-bands, which {{interact with the}} main components (such as gear mesh or blade passage frequencies and their harmonics) to influence the perception of sound. Traditional active control schemes tend to attenuate the mean-squared error, while yielding a residual spectrum with more dominant side-band structures that could degrade sound quality. In this paper, we study the side-band phenomenon by applying active control to amplitude or frequency modulated sounds in a duct. An attempt is first made to attenuate these sounds using the conventional FX-LMS algorithm. This algorithm creates a residual noise spectrum where frequency side-bands become more prevalent. Next, the narrowband adaptive noise equalizer (ANE) is employed since it allows independent gain control at each disturbance frequency known a priori, {{even if they are}} closely spaced. The ANE algorithm is based on the adaptive notch filter concept, and thus complete cancellation at all disturbance frequencies is also possible. Indeed, superior control of the residual spectral shape is observed. A few areas of research that could make improvements to available algorithms, in the context of modulated noise disturbances, are suggested. © 2005 Institute of Noise Control Engineering.

40|$|Abstract]: Australia’s {{coal fired}} power {{stations}} {{are the most}} efficient form of providing bulk base load power generation (i. e. electricity) to consumers. This is due to Australia having an abundance of thermal coal reserves, which is the fuel used in coal fired power stations. Therefore it is extremely important that these power stations operate at maximum availability and reliability to ensure the consumer receives cost effective and uninterrupted electricity. Callide C Power Station in Biloela Queensland is a 900 Megawatt (MW) coal fired power station that was commissioned in 2001. Unfortunately Callide C Power Station has been plagued with continuous operational and reliability problems caused from the induced draft (ID) fans since initial commissioning. The ID fan problems have arisen from the bearing lubrication system which provides oil recirculation to the induction motor <b>bearings</b> and <b>fan</b> main shaft <b>bearings.</b> Consequently these issues have caused half-load unit (225 MW) run-backs and full unit (450 MW) trips over the past decade. This project’s aim is to analyse the ID fan lubrication system and then identify and define all root causes and their associated failure modes. Once all root causes are identified through Root Cause Analysis (RCA) process, effective design solutions can be researched and evaluated so a proposed modification design project can be finalised. This final design proposal {{will be used to}} justify capital expenditure so implementation can occur in the near future...|$|R

40|$|Rolling {{bearings}} are {{key components}} of rotary machines. To ensure early effective fault diagnosis for bearings, a new rolling bearing fault diagnosis method based on variational mode decomposition (VMD) and an improved kernel extreme learning machine (KELM) is proposed in this paper. A fault signal is decomposed via VMD to obtain the intrinsic mode function (IMF) components, and the approximate entropy (ApEn) of the IMF component containing the main fault information is calculated. An eigenvector is created from the approximate entropy of each component. A bearing diagnosis model is created via a KELM; the KELM parameters are optimized using the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to obtain a KELM diagnosis model with optimal parameters.

40|$|Self-organizing maps {{have been}} used {{extensively}} for condition-based maintenance, where quantization errors of test data referring to the self-organizing maps of healthy training data {{have been used}} as features. Researchers have used minimum quantization error as a health indicator, which is sensitive to noise in the training data. Some other researchers have used the average of the quantization errors as a health indicator, where the best matching units of the trained self-organizing maps are required to be convex. These requirements are not always satisfied. This paper introduces a method that improves self-organizing maps for anomaly detection by addressing these issues. Noise dominated best matching units extracted from the map trained by the healthy training data are removed, and the rest are used as healthy references. For a given test data observation, the k-nearest neighbor algorithm is applied to identify neighbors of the observation that occur in the references. Then the Euclidean distance between the test data observation and the centroid of the neighbors is calculated as a health indicator. Compared with the minimum quantization error, the health indicator extracted by this method is less sensitive to noise, and compared with the average of quantization errors, it does not put limitations on the convexity or distribution of the best matching units.

40|$|Ball {{bearings}} {{have been}} used to support rotating shafts in machines such as wind turbines, aircraft engines, and desktop computer fans. There has been extensive research in the areas of condition monitoring, diagnostics, and prognostics of ball bearings. As the identification of ball bearing defects by inspection interrupts the operation of rotating machines and can be costly, the assessment of the health of ball bearings relies on the use of condition monitoring techniques. Fault detection and life prediction methods have been developed to improve condition-based maintenance and product qualification. However, intermittent and catastrophic system failures due to bearing problems still occur resulting in loss of life and increase of maintenance and warranty costs. Inaccurate life prediction of ball bearings is of concern to industry. This research focuses on prognostics of ball bearings based on vibration and acoustic emission analysis to provide early warning of failure and predict life in advance. The failure mechanisms of ball <b>bearings</b> in cooling <b>fans</b> are identified and failure precursors associated with the defects are determined. A prognostic method based on Bayesian Monte Carlo method and sequential probability ratio test is developed to predict time-to-failure of ball bearings in advance.

50|$|Wedding {{traditions of}} Chinese Filipinos, {{regardless}} of religious persuasion, usually involve {{identification of the}} dates of supplication/pamamanhikan (kiu-hun), engagement (ting-hun), and wedding (kan-chhiu) adopted from Filipino customs, through feng shui based on the birthdates of the couple, {{as well as of}} their parents and grandparents. Certain customs found among Chinese Filipinos include the following: During supplication (kiu-hun), a solemn tea ceremony within the house of the groom ensues where the couple will be served tea, egg noodles (misua), and given ang-paos (red packets containing money). During the supplication ceremony, pregnant women and recently engaged couples are forbidden from attending the ceremony. Engagement (ting-hun) quickly follows, where the bride enters the ceremonial room walking backward and turned three times before being allowed to see the groom. A welcome drink consisting of red-colored juice is given to the couple, quickly followed by the exchange of gifts for both families and the Wedding tea ceremony, where the bride serves the grooms family, and vice versa. The engagement reception consists of sweet tea soup and misua, both of which symbolizes long-lasting relationship. Before the wedding, the groom is expected to provide the matrimonial bed in the future couples new home. A baby born under the Chinese sign of the Dragon may be placed in the bed to ensure fertility. He is also tasked to deliver the wedding gown to his bride on the day prior to the wedding to the sister of the bride, as it is considered ill fortune for the groom to see the bride on that day. For the bride, she prepares an initial batch of personal belongings (ke-chheng) to the new home, all wrapped and labeled with the Chinese characters for sang-hi. On the wedding date, the bride wears a red robe emblazoned with the emblem of a dragon prior to wearing the bridal gown, to which a pair of sang-hi (English: marital happiness) coin is sewn. Before leaving her home, the bride then throws a <b>fan</b> <b>bearing</b> the Chinese characters for sang-hi toward her mother to preserve harmony within the brides family upon her departure. Most of the wedding ceremony then follows Catholic or Protestant traditions. Post-Wedding rituals include the two single brothers or relatives of the bride giving the couple a wa-hoe set, which is a bouquet of flowers with umbrella and sewing kit, for which the bride gives an ang-pao in return. After three days, the couple then visits the brides family, upon which a pair of sugar cane branch is given, which is a symbol of good luck and vitality among Hokkien people.|$|R
40|$|The book is {{organised}} in {{two main}} parts: Part I and Part II and into several chapters. The Part I includes two chapters. The first one, by the Editor, deals with basic theory, which is described following the historical steps by eminent scientists, from Herschel, to Nobili, Melloni, Stefan, Boltzmann, Planck and others. The radiation mechanisms {{with the most}} important parameters, which {{play a key role}} in acquisition and interpretation of thermal images are recalled and discussed. A section is devoted to detectors used for infrared technology. The main steps in detectors development following the technological progress are also drawn. The second chapter is by Roberto Rinaldi of the Infrared Training Center (ITC) by Flir Systems in Milan (Italy). This chapter is concerned with an overview of infrared imaging devices from the first prototype developed in 1958 to the multitude of models, which are today available. The historical evolution of the infrared technology is traced within the key features of each model. In particular, some basic characteristics and performance are described which may help the reader in the choice of the most appropriate device for the specific application. Part II is subdivided into four sections and many chapters. The first section regards applications to medicine (Chap. 1) and veterinary (Chap. 2). The study of the temperature of the human body has been associated with health as far back as the 1 st century BC, when Hypocrites, (the father of medicine), used the sense of touch to skin surface temperature anomalies and to determine the health of his patients. Still today, monitoring the body temperature variation, aides in both diagnosis and treatment planning. Chapter one was prepared by Boris G. Vainer of the Institute of Semiconductor Physics of the Russian Academy of Sciences. This chapter reports on the IRT’s state of art in medicine with methodological approaches and a variety of applications such as in the diagnosis of breast cancer, in ophthalmologic surgery, in cardiovascular surgery, in the visualization of ischemic tissues and in many others. Chapter two presents application and use of infrared thermography in farm animals and veterinary medicine. This chapter was supplied by Petr Kunc and Ivana Knizkova of the Institute of Animal Science - University of Prague (The Czech Republic). The addressed areas include reproduction, thermoregulation, animal welfare and the milking process. The application of IRT to veterinary medicine is particularly useful to predict inflammation since, contrary to human beings, animals cannot reveal any symptom before the illness has become important. Section two includes a chapter on the use of Infrared thermography in foodstuff conservation by Klaus Gottschalk of the Leibniz-Institut für Agrartechnik Potsdam (Germany). It is shown the usefulness of IRT to control the conservation conditions of fruits and vegetables. The main advantage of using an infrared device lies in the possibility to control and improve the climate, which is essential in prolonging the shelf life of crops. Section three regards applications of IRT to industrial engineering. The first chapter, prepared by Giovanni M. Carlomagno of the Department of Aerospace Engineering - University of Naples Federico II (Italy), is an overview on IRT to thermo-fluid-dynamics. After recalling the first historical attempts in measuring heat transfer coefficients, this chapter describes the most useful heat flux sensors, supplies information about thermal restoration of data and shows several examples of convective heat transfer measurements in complex fluid flows, ranging from natural convection to hypersonic regime. The attention of chapter two is focused on the application of IRT to combustion. This contribution is by Christophe Allouis and Rocco Pagliara of the Combustion Institute CNR in Naples (Italy). It is demonstrated the usefulness of an infrared imaging system for understanding fluid-dynamics phenomena associated with combustion processes in turbine burners. The third chapter by Ralph A. Rotolante of Vicon Infrared in Boxborough, MA (USA) regards the use of IRT for nondestructive inspection purposes. The main pulse and lockin techniques are described with some application examples including also the inspection of real aircraft parts. Indeed, a remote imaging system offers many advantages over other methodologies since it is fast and two-dimensional with safeguard of the part integrity. Section four is concerned with the application of IRT in architecture and civil engineering. This is a relevant topic for infrared thermography applications after Building Regulation (2007) for Conservation of Fuel and Energy. A chapter by Ermanno Grinzato of CNR-ITC in Padua (Italy) reports some examples of structural analysis aided by IR thermography. In particular, it is stressed the impressive help, which is given to the comfort monitoring by the distributed temperature map measured by an infrared device. The attention goes also to the possibility, using a novel method, to “see” the environmental main quantities as air temperature, relative humidity and velocity, obtained from thermographic readings. Besides those herein described, an infrared imaging system can be advantageously used for many other applications. Infrared thermography is an excellent condition monitoring tool to assist in the reduction of maintenance costs on mechanical equipment. One of the biggest problems in mechanical systems is heat generated by friction, cooling degradation, material loss or blockages. The infrared technique allows for the monitoring of temperatures and thermal patterns, on a wide variety of equipments including pumps, motors, <b>bearings,</b> pulleys, <b>fans,</b> drives, conveyors etc, and while the equipment is online and running under full load. Information acquired from thermographic images enable a company to predict equipment failure and to plan corrective actions before a costly shutdown, equipment damage, or personal injury occurs. What it is more, the inspection can be performed far away from any dangerous condition without additional costs in terms of workers health care. However, it has to be pointed out that infrared thermography is still not completely exploited. It could be employed in a lot of other novel applications; it is only a matter of fantasy and skill...|$|R
