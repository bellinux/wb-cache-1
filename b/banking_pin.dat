50|$|At rest one of {{the escape}} wheel teeth will be locked against a pallet. As shown in the diagram, the escape wheel rotates {{clockwise}} and the entrance tooth is locked in place against the entrance pallet, the lever {{held in place by}} the left <b>banking</b> <b>pin.</b> The impulse pin is located within the lever fork and the balance wheel is near its center position. To get started, the lever fork must receive a small impulse from the anti-clockwise rotation of the balance wheel via the impulse pin (say by being shaken) which rotates the lever slightly clockwise off the left <b>banking</b> <b>pin.</b> This unlocks the entrance pallet allowing the wheel to rotate clockwise.|$|E
50|$|After {{the exit}} tooth locks, the balance wheel rotates anti-clockwise, free of {{interference}} from the escapement until the balance spring pulls it back clockwise, and the impulse pin re-enters the fork. This will unlock the escapement, releasing the escape wheel {{so that the}} exit tooth can slide over the impulse plane of the exit pallet, which transfers a clockwise impulse to the balance wheel's impulse pin via the lever fork, while pushing the lever up against the left <b>banking</b> <b>pin.</b> The escape wheel drops again until the entrance tooth locks on the entrance pallet now being {{held in place by}} the left <b>banking</b> <b>pin</b> via the lever. The balance wheel continues clockwise, again free from interference until it is pulled back by the balance spring to the center position. The cycle then starts again.|$|E
50|$|Photographs of the {{escapement}} {{from above}} and below in the prototype watch and a diagram of the important features are shown in the figures. As the two escape wheels A and B rotate meshed together, {{one of them is}} locked when an impulse/locking tooth, standing upright from the escape wheel, rests on the wide straight locking stone of the detent. In the figure the balance is rotating counter-clockwise and just at the point that the unlocking pallet C on the balance is about to move the detent D to release peg E on escape wheel A which is resting on the jewelled locking surface underneath the detent arm. The impulse pallet F mounted on the balance staff just below the unlocking pallet C will have moved in front of peg G whilst the balance completes its unlocking arc. When the peg E is released by the detent, the escape wheels accelerate together and peg G will deliver an impulse on the jewelled rear face of impulse pallet F. After the impulse arc, tooth H from the escape wheel B locks {{on the other end of}} the detent locking jewel which has now been moved into its path. The depth of locking is limited by a <b>banking</b> <b>pin</b> J.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} a new method for the signature analysis of mechanical watch movements. Contrary {{to the existing}} method, it analyzes the time-frequency features of mechanical watch movement {{through a combination of}} reassigned scalogram and Finite Element Analysis (FEA). By mapping the signal into a 2 D domain of time and frequency, the reassigned scalogram reveals the frequency components of the shocks at different time. On the other hand, FEA gives the modal frequencies of the movements. By comparing the frequency components at different shocks to the modal frequencies of the movement, possible malfunctions of the movement can then be detected. A number of demonstration examples are included. Index Terms — Signature analysis, Mechanical watch, Reassigned scalogram, Finite element analysis, Fault diagnosis. clockwise until it hits the <b>banking</b> <b>pin.</b> As the intensity of the shocks in the drop phase is the largest, the vibration of the escape wheel may cause vibration on the fourth wheel.

50|$|The {{reliability}} of the modern lever escapement depends upon draw; the pallets are angled so that the escape wheel must recoil a small amount during the unlocking.

5000|$|The {{escape wheel}} is {{geared to the}} watch's wheel train, which applies torque to it from the mainspring. The {{rotation}} of the escape wheel {{is controlled by the}} pallets. The escape wheel has specially shaped teeth of either ratchet or club form, which interact with the two jewels called the entrance and exit pallets. The escape wheel, except in unusual cases, has 15 teeth and is made of steel. These pallets are attached solidly to the lever, which has at its end a fork to receive the ruby impulse pin of the balance roller which is fixed to the balance wheel shaft. The balance wheel is returned towards its static center position by an attached balance spring (not shown in the diagram). In modern design it is common for the pallet mountings and the fork to be made as a single component. The lever is mounted on a shaft and is free to rotate between two fixed <b>banking</b> <b>pins.</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{formally}} {{prove that the}} problem of cracking, i. e., correctly guessing, <b>bank</b> <b>PINs</b> used for accessing Automated Teller Machines and the problem of solving the Generalized Mastermind Game are strictly related. The Generalized Mastermind Game with N colors and k pegs is an extension of the well known Mastermind game, played with 6 colors and 4 pegs. The rules are the same, one player has to conceal a sequence of k colored pegs behind a screen and another player has to guess the exact position and colors of the pegs using the minimal number of moves. We first introduce a general game, called the Extended Mastermind Game (EMG), and we then formally prove it includes both the Generalized Mastermind Game and the PIN cracking Problem. We then present some experimental results that we have devised using a computer program that optimizes a well known technique presented by Knuth in 1976 for the standard Mastermind game. We finally show that the program improves the as state-of-the-art Mastermind solvers as it is able to compute strategies for cases which were not yet covered. More interestingly, the same solving strategy is adapted also for the solution of the PIN cracking problem...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Defining best {{management}} practices for forests requires quantification of the variability of stream sediment loads for managed and unmanaged forest conditions and their associated sediment sources. Although “best {{management practices}} ” are used, the public has concerns about effects from forest restoration activities and commercial timber harvests. It is necessary to know the current and/or natural range of variability {{to be able to}} determine if management activity has a significant negative impact; only long-term research can provide such data. The Forest Service in the United States has such long-term watershed research. An annual sediment load from a watershed is determined by emptying a sediment basin located in the stream channel {{at the end of a}} water year. Sediment fences, stream <b>bank</b> <b>pins,</b> survey techniques, and turbidity sensors provide measurements that can be used to determine the sources of sediment. The importance of having an undisturbed watershed for “natural range of variability ” to compare with watersheds previously or currently under active management is illustrated. For example, at the Kings River Experimental Watersheds one of the managed watersheds in the rain and snow zone, produced 1. 8, 15. 2, and 18. 7 kg/ha for water years 2004, 2005, and 2006, respectively. The increase in sediment accumulation correlates with an increase in yearly precipitation. The undisturbed watershed and the snowdominated watersheds produce similar, and sometimes higher, sediment loads for these same years.

This study provides a tool for water management that can help with estimation parts of a streambank which are prone to erosion. The Bank erosion hazard index (BEHI) part of the BANCS (Bank Assessment for Non‑point source Consequences of Sediment) model {{is one of the}} several procedures for assessing streambank erosion condition and potential (Rosgen, 2001). On May 15 th 2014 a high precipitation occurred in the watershed of Sestrč torrent, {{in the eastern part of}} Chočské vrchy (Sp = 27. 64 km 2). It reached 102. 7 mm per 24 hours. The rainfall resulted in extreme streambank erosion. We started the research of annual stream bank erosion on Sestrč in the beginning of May 2014 and we established 19 experimental sections on the stream. Occurrence of heavy rainfall allowed us to erosion rates after flash flood. The aim of this paper was to verify, if BEHI index can really determine the most vulnerable parts of a banks to erosion. We measured erosion rates Eb (m 3 /m) using a <b>bank</b> <b>pins</b> and toe pin (Sass, 2011) on each experimental section and evaluated each section by BEHI index (Rosgen, 2001, 2008).

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyEnvironmental Design and Planning ProgramTimothy D. KeaneThe {{original}} {{purpose of this}} investigation was to develop streambank erosion prediction curves for Northeast Kansas streams. Rosgen's (2001, 2006) methods were employed and eighteen study banks were measured and monitored over a four-year period, summer 2007 through summer 2010. At each study <b>bank,</b> a toe <b>pin</b> and two to three <b>bank</b> <b>pins</b> were set at a recorded longitudinal profile station of the stream. Vertical and horizontal measures from the toe <b>pin</b> to the <b>bank</b> face were taken each summer, 2007 as the baseline measure and 2008 - 2010 as bank change years. Bank profiles were overlaid to gain insight into bank area lost or gained due to erosional or depositional processes. A Bank Erosion Hazard Index (BEHI) and Near Bank Stress (NBS) combination rating was assessed and calculated for each study bank during the initial survey of 2007. The streambanks experienced varied erosion rates for similar BEHI/NBS combinations producing R 2 values from 0. 43 as the High/Very High BEHI rating and 0. 80 as the Moderate BEHI rating. In addition, Moderate BEHI ratings provided higher erosion rates than the High/Very High BEHI rating and curves intersected at lower NBS ratings, suggesting a discrepancy in the fit of the model used in the Northeast Kansas region and conditions. In this light, modification of the BEHI model was evaluated and variables were assessed in the model for additional influence exerted in the Northeast Kansas region. Vegetation seemed to provide the most influence to bank resistance and was more closely evaluated. Banks with and without woody riparian vegetation were then plotted against BEHI and NBS values, as banks lacking woody vegetation eroded at higher rates. This study's findings can allow us to calibrate the BEHI model according to woody vegetation occurrence levels along streambanks in the Black Vermillion watershed. Modifications regarding vegetation occurrence of the BEHI model was completed and the results of these modifications generated R 2 values of 0. 78 for High/Very High BEHI and 0. 82 for Moderate BEHI ratings. High/Very High ratings provided higher predicted erosion rates than Moderate ratings, while the curve slopes did not intersect at lower NBS ratings...|$|R
