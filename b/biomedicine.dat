5|$|These {{challenges}} {{are included in}} the goals of the Office of Research on Women's Health, in the United States, as is the goal of facilitating women's access to careers in <b>biomedicine.</b> The ORWH believes that {{one of the best ways}} to advance research in women's health is to increase the proportion of women involved in healthcare and health research, as well as assuming leadership in government, centres of higher learning, and in the private sector. This goal acknowledges the glass ceiling that women face in careers in science and in obtaining resources from grant funding to salaries and laboratory space. The National Science Foundation in the United States states that women only gain half of the doctorates awarded in science and engineering, fill only 21% of full-time professor positions in science and 5% of those in engineering, while earning only 82% of the remuneration their male colleagues make. These figures are even lower in Europe.|$|E

40|$|Diabetes is {{a growing}} burden in sub-Saharan Africa where {{traditional}} medicines (TMs) remain a primary form of healthcare in many settings. In Tanzania, TMs are frequently used to treat non-communicable diseases, yet {{little is known about}} TM practices for non-communicable diseases like diabetes. Between December 2013 and June 2014, we assessed TM practices, including types, frequencies, reasons, and modes, among randomly selected community members. To further characterize TMs relevant for the local treatment of diabetes, we also conducted focus groups and semi-structured interviews with key informants. We enrolled 481 adults of whom 45 (9. 4  %) had diabetes. The prevalence of TM use among individuals with diabetes was 77. 1  % (95  % CI 58. 5 - 89. 0  %), and the prevalence of using TMs and <b>biomedicines</b> concurrently was 37. 6  % (95  % CI 20. 5 - 58. 4  %). Many were using TMs specifically to treat diabetes (40. 3  %; 95  % CI 20. 5 - 63. 9), and individuals with diabetes reported seeking healthcare from traditional healers, elders, family, friends, and herbal vendors. We identified several plant-based TMs used toward diabetes care: Moringa oleifera, Cymbopogon citrullus, Hagenia abyssinica, Aloe vera, Clausena anisata, Cajanus cajan, Artimisia afra, and Persea americana. TMs were commonly used for diabetes care in northern Tanzania. Individuals with diabetes sought healthcare advice from many sources, and several individuals used TMs and <b>biomedicines</b> together.
