One of them is transversal along the Z axis of lathe and the other is rotation around the Y axis. Both of the two movements are driven by electromagnetic force. The moving assembly is designed to be parallel structure for guarantying both of the two movements has similar response frequency and maximum stroke. The output force of normal electromagnetic force generated by magnetic flux <b>bias</b> <b>motor</b> has been calculated. The design of transmission mechanism has been presented. The result of acceleration calculation shows that the FTS achieves acceleration up to about 650 G in both directions of movement...|$|E
40|$|Human {{eye-tracking}} {{studies have}} shown that gaze fixations are biased toward the center of natural scene stimuli (“center bias”). This bias contaminates the evaluation of computational models of attention and oculomotor behavior. Here we recorded eye movements from 17 participants watching 40 MTV-style video clips (with abrupt scene changes every 2 – 4 s), to quantify the relative contributions of five causes of center bias: photographer <b>bias,</b> <b>motor</b> bias, viewing strategy, orbital reserve, and screen center. Photographer bias was evaluated by five naive human raters and correlated with eye movements. The frequently changing scenes in MTV-style videos allowed us to assess how motor bias and viewing strategy affected center bias across time. In an additional experiment with 5 participants, videos were displayed at different locations within a large screen to investigate the influences of orbital reserve and screen center. Our results demonstrate quantitatively {{for the first time that}} center bias is correlated strongly with photographer bias and is influenced by viewing strategy at scene onset, while orbital reserve, screen center, and motor bias contribute minimally. We discuss methods to account for these influences to better assess computational models of visual attention and gaze using natural scene stimuli...|$|E
40|$|When {{shaking hands}} or {{catching}} a ball, humans not {{only need to}} perceive, understand and predict the interacting partner’s actions, but also timely coordinate their own actions to successfully interact. Thus far, such social interactions have typically been investigated using paradigms that neglected the active part of the so-called observer; that is, participants passively observed the confederate’s action without actively reacting to or interacting with the observed action. This raises the question to what degree findings from passive observation experiments are transferable to situations in which participants actively engage in motor interactions. Secondly, predictions of an observed action are not only informed by online visual information, but are often influenced by prior assumptions and expectations. Therefore, the second question we address is to what degree motor control in social interactions is mediated by top-down influences. We present {{a series of studies}} examining the processes of social perception and action in truly interactive experimental setups. The results of these studies support the ecological validity of earlier findings and they show that prior expectations powerfully influence/ <b>bias</b> <b>motor</b> control in social interactions. We advocate the use virtual reality to create interactive setups that are under high experimental control and allow natural interactions...|$|E

First, we review results for the influence of heterogenous tracks such as a single-strand of DNA or RNA on {{the dynamics of the}} motors. We stress how the predicted behavior might be observed experimentally in anomalous drift and diffusion of motors over a wide range of parameters near the stall force and discuss the extreme limit of strongly <b>biased</b> <b>motors</b> with one-way hopping. We then consider the dynamics in an environment containing a variety of different fuels which supply chemical energy for the motor motion, either on a heterogeneous or on a periodic track.

Fla sites were fairly broadly distributed, whereas Mot and Che sites were more narrowly defined. Local subregions rich in sites of one type were not generally rich in sites of another type. Among Che sites, there was little overlap between those corresponding to a clockwise bias and those corresponding to a counterclockwise bias. Our results suggest that within the corresponding gene products there are specialized subregions for flagellar structure, motor rotation, and control of the sense of rotation...|$|R
40|$|Autism {{spectrum}} disorders (ASDs) affect 1 {{in every}} 88 U. S. children. ASDs {{have been described}} as neurological and developmental disorders impacting visual, motor, and visual-motor integration (VMI) abilities that affect academic achievement (CDC, 2010). Forty-five participants (22 ASD and 23 Typically Developing [TD]) 8 to 14 years old completed the Bender-Gestalt Test, Second Edition (BG II), Beery-Buktenica Developmental Test of Visual-Motor Integration, 5 th Edition (VMI-V), NEPSY Second Edition (NEPSY-II), Test of Visual Perceptual Skills- 3 (TVPS- 3), Navon Task, Kaufman Test of Educational Achievement, Second Edition, Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test, Second Edition, Behavior Assessment Scale for Children, Second Edition, and Autism Spectrum Screening Questionnaire. Three hypotheses examined whether students with ASDs were more likely than TD peers to have: (1) a visual processing bias; (2) fine motor difficulties; and (3) VMI difficulties. Additional hypotheses analyzed the relationship between (4) local processing <b>bias</b> and fine <b>motor</b> difficulties on VMI ability and (5) local processing <b>bias,</b> fine <b>motor</b> difficulties, and VMI difficulties on academic achievement. A series oft-tests indicated the TVPS- 3 (p=. 72), Navon Task (p=. 78), BG-II (p =. 39), and VMI-V (p =. 14) were not significantly different between groups. Students with ASDs demonstrated increased difficulty compared to TD students on the NEPSY-II (p =. 01) and slower completion time on the Navon Task (p =. 01). Regression analyses for VMI indicated the best predictors for the BG-II (p 3 ̆c. 001) were the TVPS- 3 and Navon Completion Time; the best predictor for the VMI-V (p 3 ̆c. 001) was the TVPS- 3. Regression analyses indicated that VMI-V predicted all domains of academic achievement. In addition to VMI-V, fine motor skills related to writing achievement, and BG-II related to math achievement. Based on the results, the speed of processing plays an important role on VMI skills and academic achievement, more so than the local processing bias. Although this study may have been impacted by homogeneity in the participants, it investigates a relationship between visual processing <b>biases,</b> fine <b>motor</b> difficulties, visual-motor integration and academic achievement that has received little attention in the literature. Findings can inform the development of more effective interventions for academic functioning for students with ASDs...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{extended}} recent research revealing that illusions can influence performance in golf putting (Witt, Linkenauger, & Proffitt Psychological Science, 23, 397 – 399, 2012), by exploring the potential mediating roles {{of attention and}} action planning. Glover and Dixon’s (Journal of Experimental Psychology. Human Perception and Performance, 27, 560 – 572, 2001) planning–control model suggests that both perceptual and movement-planning processes are prone to illusion-based bias. We therefore predicted that both the perception of target size and a measure of attentional control related to movement planning in golf putting (the quiet eye) would {{be influenced by the}} illusion. Moreover, as performance could not be corrected using online control (once the ball was struck), we predicted that these biases would also influence performance. We therefore proposed a three-stage process by which illusory context biases perceptual processes, which in turn bias subsequent attentional control related to movement planning, which in turn <b>biases</b> <b>motor</b> performance. Forty novice golfers completed an Ebbinghaus illusion putting task that was designed to manipulate their perceptions of target size, while quiet eye duration and performance (mean radial error) were measured. The results indicated that the illusion was effective in facilitating differences in perceived target size, with perceptually bigger holes promoting longer quiet eye durations and more accurate putting. Follow-up mediation analyses revealed that illusion-based differences in size perception partially mediated illusion-based differences in both quiet eye duration and performance. Moreover, the relationship between illusion-based differences in quiet eye duration and performance was also significant. Future research should further test this three-stage process of bias in other far-aiming tasks in which online control cannot be use...|$|R

We found that in perceptual decision making without performance feedback, a decision on an ambiguous stimulus is repeated on the subsequent trial more often than a decision on a salient stimulus. This inertia of decision was not accounted for by <b>biases</b> in <b>motor</b> response, sensory processing, or attention.

Response selection bias was reflected by faster responses when emotional word position (top/bottom screen) spatially corresponded to response position (upper/lower response key). Results revealed anxiety-related bias in visual attention for physical-threat words. In distributional analyses, this bias was associated with slower responses in the 14 -ms condition (first task half).

40|$|Strong {{bottom-up}} impulses {{and weak}} top-down control may interactively lead to overeating and, consequently, weight gain. In the present study, female university freshmen were tested {{at the start}} of the first semester and again {{at the start of}} the second semester. Attentional bias toward high- or low-calorie food-cues was assessed using a dot-probe paradigm and participants completed the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale. Attentional <b>bias</b> and <b>motor</b> impulsivity interactively predicted change in body mass index: motor impulsivity positively predicted weight gain only when participants showed an attentional bias toward high-calorie food-cues. Attentional and non-planning impulsivity were unrelated to weight change.

40|$|A {{recombinant}} DNA {{approach has}} been used to study intracellular signaling in the bacterial sensing system. The Escherichia coli cheY gene, whose function is unknown, has been subcloned behind the synthetic inducible tac promoter. The resulting plasmid directs the synthesis of the Y protein in response to isopropyl beta-D-thiogalactoside, independent of its usual operon control. When this construct was introduced into wild-type and mutant cells, the Y protein caused a clockwise rotational bias in the flagellar motors. This effect was observed even in heavily biased counterclockwise strains lacking most of the central chemotaxis processing genes. The results show that the Y protein has a direct influence on flagellar rotation not requiring other processing genes of the sensing system. The Y protein appears to bind directly to a part of the flagellar motor, probably the flaA gene product, and it is probably the key element in <b>biasing</b> the <b>motor</b> toward the clockwise rotational direction...|$|R
40|$|The {{basal ganglia}} form the largest sub-cortical {{structure}} in the human brain and are implicated in numerous human diseases. In songbirds, as in mammals, basal ganglia-forebrain circuits are necessary for the learning and production of complex motor behaviors; however, the precise role of this circuitry remains unknown. This thesis is an investigation into how the anterior forebrain pathway (AFP), an avian basal ganglia-forebrain circuit, supports vocal learning in the songbird. This investigation reveals two previously undiscovered functions of the AFP - both related to reinforcement, or trial-and-error, learning. One necessary component of reinforcement learning is the generation of variable behavior. The songs of learning juvenile birds are naturally highly variable. Rapid pharmacological inactivation of the AFP output nucleus causes an immediate and dramatic reduction in this variability. In addition, the first single-unit recordings of AFP output neurons in singing juvenile birds reveal little correlation with plastic song and a premotor correlation with the most variable form of singing, subsong. These results suggest a novel function for basal ganglia-forebrain circuitry {{in the production of}} exploratory behavior. A second component of reinforcement learning is the evaluation of performance-based feedback - auditory feedback in the case of singing. Conditional disruptive auditory feedback is a novel behavioral paradigm capable of causing rapid experimentally-controlled vocal learning. Inactivating the AFP while using this new paradigm to induce learning reveals that the AFP <b>biases</b> <b>motor</b> output to improve auditory feedback. This result suggests that basal gangliaforebrain circuits are involved in the evaluation of performance-based feedback. It also suggests {{for the first time that}} these circuits are capable of producing temporally precise premotor drive that incrementally improves a motor skill. In summary, this investigation significantly furthers the view that basal ganglia-forebrain circuitry is involved in reinforcement learning. It ascribes two functions to the anterior forebrain pathway: to drive variable behavior; and to bias future behavior incrementally towards better performance. By analogy, basal ganglia-thalamocortical loops may perform similar functions in mammals. by Aaron Samuel Andalman. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Expectations {{about the}} {{environment}} influence motor behavior. In simple tasks, for example, prior knowledge about which stimulus event will likely occur or which response will likely be rewarded induces a tendency to take the favored action (i. e., a <b>motor</b> or response <b>bias),</b> especially when sensory information is sparse or ambiguous. Models of choice behavior account for this bias by weighting decision alternatives unequally, either at an early sensory-input stage or at a downstream motor-output stage. These two alternatives can be distinguished empirically; the former predicts an altered percept that correlates with <b>motor</b> <b>bias,</b> the latter predicts no perceptual effect. By varying the prior probability of target or reward location, we induced biased oculomotor responses in a brightness selection task with human subjects. We found that the induced <b>motor</b> <b>bias</b> was correlated with an amplification of both the sensory signals and internal noise underlying brightness perception, without a systematic change in perceived overall brightness. We {{also found that the}} magnitude of the sensory amplification was correlated with the amount of noise in the brightness percept, consistent with a multiplicative weighting factor located downstream from the limiting internal sensory noise. Our data demonstrate that prior knowledge (about target location or reward) shapes visual signals for perception and action in parallel but does not improve the quality (i. e., signal-to-noise ratio) of sensory processing.

40|$|Dynamic {{properties}} of molecular motors whose motion {{is powered by}} interactions with specic lattice bonds are studied theoretically {{with the help of}} discrete-state stochastic burnt-bridge models. Molecular motors are depicted as random walkers that can destroy or rebuild periodically distributed weak connections (bridges) when crossing them, with probabilities p 1 and p 2 correspondingly. Dynamic properties, such as velocities and dispersions, are obtained in exact and explicit form for arbitrary values of parameters p 1 and p 2. For the unbiased random walker, reversible burning of the bridges results in a biased directed motion with a dynamic transition observed at very small concentrations of bridges. In the case of backward <b>biased</b> molecular <b>motor</b> its backward velocity is reduced and a reversal of the direction of motion is observed for some range of parameters. It is also found that the dispersion demonstrates a complex, non-monotonic behavior with large uctuations for some set of parameters.

40|$|Pointing {{movements}} made to {{a target}} defined by the imaginary intersection of a pointer with a distant landing line were examined in healthy human observers {{in order to determine}} whether such motor responses are susceptible to the Poggendorff effect. In this well-known geometric illusion observers make systematic extrapolation errors when the pointer abuts a second line (the inducer). The kinematics of extrapolation movements, in which no explicit target was present, where similar to those made in response to a rapid-onset (explicit) dot target. The results unambiguously demonstrate that motor (pointing) responses are susceptible to the illusion. In fact, raw <b>motor</b> <b>biases</b> were greater than for perceptual responses: {{in the absence of an}} inducer (and hence also the acute angle of the Poggendorff stimulus) perceptual responses were near-veridical, whilst motor responses retained a bias. Therefore, the full Poggendorff stimulus contained two biases: one mediated by the acute angle formed between the oblique pointer and the inducing line (the classic Poggendorff effect), which affected both motor and perceptual responses equally, and another bias, which was independent of the inducer and primarily affected motor responses. We conjecture that this additional <b>motor</b> <b>bias</b> is associated with an undershoot in the unknown direction of movement and provide evidence to justify this claim. In conclusion, both manual pointing and perceptual judgements are susceptible to the well-known Poggendorff effect, supporting the notion of a unitary representation of space for action and perception or else an early locus for the effect, prior to the divergence of processing streams...|$|R
40|$|The {{conflicting}} results {{regarding the}} study of motor laterality in horses may indicate that there does not exist a proper method to assess the degree and the direction of <b>motor</b> <b>bias</b> in these animals. Unfortunately, even less {{is known about the}} development of laterality in horses, and to what extent early manipulations can still exert their effects in adulthood. We propose a new method that can be easily applied {{at a very early age}} thus avoiding testing adult horses eventually biased by human handling and/or training. Forty-six horses (29 nine-month-old foals and 17 two-year old horses) were handled since birth bilaterally and housed in groups in wide areas. At the time of the analysis, in order to minimize environmental and sensorial dis- turbances, each horse was tested in a round pen individually or as dyad mother-foal. The ability/inability to prop- erly execute a circle at trot was then recorded, assuming the direction of derailment, i. e. the cutting of the circle, as an indicator of <b>motor</b> <b>bias.</b> From the results of the study it is arguable that motor laterality in horses is acquired over time: in fact foals tested while their mothers were being subjected to longeing showed a higher percentage of ambidextrous animals, while two-year-old horses appeared biased toward the right (pb 0. 05). Results are discussed in the light of the scienti␣c knowledge about equine biomechanics, taking into account horses' locomotion that leads to the advancement of the body mass through the activation of a kinetic chain that originates from the hindquarters. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Stimuli represent two classes of transfer verbs and two constructions that encode transfer events, Ditransitive and Oblique Goal (Goldberg, 1995).

Second, verbs that entail change of possession generate strong motor-simulation effects irrespective of constructional context, while those entailing causation of motion exert such effects only when enriched up to change-of-possession verbs in the semantically mismatched Ditransitive context.

40|$|Dynamics of {{molecular}} motors that move along linear lattices {{and interact with}} them via reversible destruction of specific lattice bonds is investigated theoretically by analyzing exactly solvable discrete-state ``burnt-bridge'' models. Molecular motors are viewed as diffusing particles that can asymmetrically break or rebuild periodically distributed weak links when passing over them. Our explicit calculations of dynamic properties show that coupling the transport of the unbiased molecular motor with the bridge-burning mechanism leads to a directed motion that lowers fluctuations and produces a dynamic transition {{in the limit of}} low concentration of weak links. Interaction between the backward <b>biased</b> molecular <b>motor</b> and the bridge-burning mechanism yields a complex dynamic behavior. For the reversible dissociation the backward motion of the molecular motor is slowed down. There is a change {{in the direction of the}} molecular motor's motion for some range of parameters. The molecular motor also experiences non-monotonic fluctuations due to the action of two opposing mechanisms: the reduced activity after the burned sites and locking of large fluctuations. Large spatial fluctuations are observed when two mechanisms are comparable. The properties of the molecular motor are different for the irreversible burning of bridges where the velocity and fluctuations are suppressed for some concentration range, and the dynamic transition is also observed. Dynamics of the system is discussed in terms of the effective driving forces and transitions between different diffusional regimes...|$|R

40|$|Parkinson’s {{disease is}} {{characterized}} by tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural abnormalities ascribed {{to the loss of}} nigrostriatal dopamine (DA). Symptoms similar to the human condition can be produced in the rat by DA-depleting 6 -hydroxydopamine injections made into the nigrostriatal system. After a unilateral lesion, the rat symptoms include sensory and motor impairments and turning <b>biases</b> reflecting <b>motor</b> abnormalities to the contralateral-to-depletion side of the body. In addition, a number of studies on skilled reaching report impairments {{in the use of the}} ipsilateral limb. It is suggested that the ipsilateral deficit is secondary to the contralateral motor impairments however. Here we re-examine how rats with unilateral DA depletion use their ipsilateral limb for skilled reaching for food. We provide the first description of an impairment on the ipsilateral-to-depletion side of the body of the rat and the first demonstration of amelioration of the defect using behavioral therapy. Video analysis of rats reaching for single pellets of food with the ipsilateral limb revealed that, although limb advancement and food grasping were normal, paw supination and food release to the mouth were impaired. Consequently, the animals were unable to transport a grasped food pellet to the mouth. Behavioral therapy, consisting of training in a simpler reaching task, strikingly lessened the impairment and improved reaching movements to the point that the rats could transport the food to the mouth. The results are discussed in relation to possible causes of the ipsilateral impairment, its treatment, and to relevan...|$|R
40|$|A {{single case}} study is {{presented}} of an unusual dissociation between the sensory perception of an object and the grasping action towards the same object. The patient IW was found at age 74 to have spent all his life without the left parietal lobe, {{as a result of}} a congenital peri-natal insult. IW does not show any signs of sensory dysfunction, but he has a persistent <b>motor</b> <b>bias</b> that arises during movement towards objects. When IW was required to reach and grasp stationary and rotating objects, he consistently grasped the objects to the left side. Thus, it appears that information that is available at a sensory level can nevertheless be unavailable at a motor level. Our findings not only help to clarify the functions of the parietal lobe, but also show that lesions in this area are linked specifically to a process of response performance, which is fundamental for our understanding of visuomotor control...|$|R
40|$|Video {{techniques}} {{were used to}} study the coordination of different flagella on single filamentous cells of Escherichia coli. Filamentous, nonseptate cells were produced by introducing a cell division mutation into a strain that was polyhook but otherwise wild type for chemotaxis. Markers for its flagellar motors (ordinary polyhook cells that had been fixed with glutaraldehyde) were attached with antihook antibodies. The markers were driven alternately clockwise and counterclockwise, at angular velocities comparable to those observed when wild-type cells are tethered to glass. The directions of rotation of different markers on the same cell were not correlated; reversals of the flagellar motors occurred asynchronously. The <b>bias</b> of the <b>motors</b> (the fraction of time spent spinning counterclockwise) changed with time. Variations in bias were correlated, provided that the motors were within a few micrometers of one another. Thus, although the directions of rotation of flagellar motors are not controlled by a common intracellular signal, their biases are. This signal {{appears to have a}} limited range...|$|R
