40|$|Abstract-The {{performance}} of wireless MIMO systems {{is known to}} suffer significantly from fading correlation between the antenna elements in a poor scattering environment if the transmitter is non-adaptive. However, acquiring accurate short-term channel state information to control TX adaptivity can be a serious problem, in particular in FDD systems. Thus, we are proposing statistical linear transmit prefiltering schemes for MMSE and ML detection in the receiver that are solely based on long-term channel state information. It is demonstrated that long-term adaptive prefiltering can achieve a significant gain over non-adaptive (<b>blind)</b> <b>transmission.</b> Prefiltering for ML detection in a strongly correlated channel is shown to yield almost the same performance as the blind scheme in an uncorrelated channel. Moreover, exploiting long-term properties of the channel is especially appealing in terms of computational complexity and channel estimation, as the long-term channel estimation process {{can be carried out}} in a wide time window.

40|$|In {{this paper}} spatial loading in a {{reciprocal}} time-varying multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel is considered. We {{take inspiration from}} a blind iterative algorithm proposed in the literature to estimate the singular vectors associated to the dominant singular value to perform beamforming. Starting from that, we introduce an iterative algorithm that can estimate all the singular vectors and the associated singular values of the channel matrix. Then the estimated singular vectors are used to transmit over the parallel sub-channels and the associated singular values are considered to implement the rate and power loading algorithm described in this paper. A procedure based on the joint use of the two considered algorithms can be adopted to adaptively maximize the total rate for a given error rate performance and a given constraint on the average transmitted power.

We applied ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopy {{to investigate the}} physical properties of homeopathic preparations and to contribute {{to an understanding of}} the not-yet-identified mode of action. In previous investigations, homeopathic preparations had significantly lower UV light transmissions than controls. The aim of this study was to explore the possible effects of external factors (UV light and temperature) on the homeopathic preparations. Homeopathic centesimal (c) dilutions, 1 c to 30 c, of copper sulfate (CuSO 4), decimal dilutions of sulfur (S 8), 1 x to 30 x, and controls (succussed potentization medium) were prepared, randomized, and <b>blinded.</b> UV <b>transmission</b> was measured at six different time points after preparation (from 4 to 256 days). In addition, one series of samples was exposed to UV light of a sterilization lamp for 12 h, one was incubated at 37 °C for 24 [*]h, and one was heated to 90 °C for 15 [*]min. UV light transmission values from 190 or 220 [*]nm to 340 [*]nm were measured several times and averaged. After each exposure, UV transmission of the homeopathic preparations of CuSO 4 was significantly reduced compared to the controls, particularly after heating to 37 °C. Overall, the nonexposed CuSO 4 preparations did not show significantly lower UV transmission compared to controls; however, the pooled subgroup of measurements at days 26, 33, and 110 yielded significant differences. UV light transmission for S 8 preparations did not show any differences compared to controls. Our conclusion is that exposure to external factors, incubation at 37 °C in particular, increases the difference in light transmission of homeopathic CuSO 4 preparations compared to controls...|$|R

[...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Electrical Engineering and Computer ScienceIn amplify-and-forward (AF) two-way relay networks, {{information}} is exchanged be-tween two source nodes via a relay node by AF relaying. This dissertation develops the blind detection designs for various two-way relay {{systems such as}} one antenna AF two-way relay network with direct link, one antenna AF two-way relay network without direct link, and multiple antenna AF two-way relay network without direct link. In the ?rst system, an e?ective signalling and transmitting scheme using four M-ary phase-shift keying (M-PSK) constellation sets is proposed to achieve a unique identi?cation of the transmitted symbols and the channel coe?cients in a noise-free <b>transmission.</b> <b>Blind</b> receivers with full diversity are derived for Rayleigh fading channels with Gaussian noise by the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) and least square error (LSE) criterions. Constellation selections are investigated for the source nodes to transmit at a uniform bit rate in each time slot. Power allocation schemes are discussed to further improve the average error probability of the source nodes in the blind detections. In the second system, frequency selective fading channels are assumed between each node. The knowledge of channel state information (CSI) is assumed not available for all nodes. An e?cient transmission and signaling scheme is proposed. To deal with the high complexity in implementing the LSE receiver, a parallel iterative sphere decoding scheme is investigated. The low complexity of this scheme allows that the joint estimation and detection of the channel coe?cients and transmitted symbols can be e?ciently implemented.

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, the {{proliferation}} of internet equipment and {{an increasing number of}} people moving into cities have significantly influenced mobile data demand density and intensity. To accommodate the increasing demands, the fifth generation (5 G) wireless systems standards emerged in 2014. Device-to-device communications (D 2 D) is one of the three primary technologies to address the key performance indicators of the 5 G network. D 2 D communications enable devices to communicate data information directly with each other without access to a fixed wireless infrastructure. The potential advantages of D 2 D communications include throughput enhancement, device energy saving and coverage expansion. The economic attraction to mobile operators is that significant capacity and coverage gains can be achieved without having to invest in network-side hardware upgrades or new cell deployments. However, there are technical challenges related to D 2 D and conventional cellular communication (CC) in co-existence, especially their mutual interference due to spectrum sharing. A novel interference-aware-routing for multi-hop D 2 D is introduced for reducing the mutual interference. The first verification scenario of interference-aware-routing is that in a real urban environment. D 2 D is used for relaying data across the urban terrain, in the presence of CC communications. Different wireless routing algorithms are considered, namely: shortest-path-routing, interference-aware-routing, and broadcast-routing. In general, the interference-aware-routing achieves a better performance of reliability and there is a fundamental trade-off between D 2 D and CC outage performances, due to their mutual interference relationship. Then an analytical stochastic geometry framework is developed to compare the performance of shortest-path-routing and interference-aware-routing. Based on the results, the spatial operational envelopes for different D 2 D routing algorithms and CC transmissions based on the user equipment (UEs) physical locations are defined. There is a forbidden area of D 2 D because of the interference from the base stations (BSs), so the collision probability of the D 2 D multi-hop path hitting the defined D 2 D forbidden area is analysed. Depend on the result of the collision probability, a dynamic switching strategy between D 2 D and CC communications in order to minimise mutual interference is proposed. A <b>blind</b> gradient-based <b>transmission</b> switching strategy is developed to avoid collision within the collision area and only requires knowledge of the distances to the serving base station of the current user and the final destination user. In the final part of my research, the concept of LTE-U (Long term evolution for Unlicensed Spectrum), which suggests that LTE can operate in the unlicensed spectrum with significant modifications to its transmission protocols, is investigated. How the envisaged D 2 D networks can efficiently scale their capacity by utilising the unlicensed spectrum with appropriately designed LTE-Unlicensed protocols is examined...|$|R
