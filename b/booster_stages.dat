25|$|An uprated version, the 2300lbf (10.23kN) thrust FJ44-2A, was {{introduced}} in 1997. It has a larger 21.7 in (551mm) diameter fan, with two additional <b>booster</b> <b>stages</b> to increase core flow. Owing to stressing considerations, the centrifugal compressor is throttled-back aerodynamically to a lower HPC pressure ratio than the -1. Other features include an exhaust mixer and an electronic fuel control unit. The 2400lbf (10.68kN) thrust FJ44-2C {{is similar to the}} -2A, but incorporates an integrated hydromechanical fuel control unit.|$|E
25|$|During the 1980s, a {{projected}} shortage of Minuteman I <b>booster</b> <b>stages</b> {{for use in}} launching targets for anti-ballistic missile trials led to Sandia National Laboratories being contracted to develop a booster based on Polaris, which {{was known as the}} Strategic Target System or STARS. STARS I consisted of a Polaris two-stage rocket with a solid-fueled Orbis I stage added to serve as a third stage. STARS II added a fourth stage, called the Operations and Deployment Experiments Simulator (ODES). STARS I was first launched in 1993, and from 2004 onwards has served as the standard booster for trials of the Ground-Based Interceptor. STARS II was only used in two suborbital launches, in 1994 and 1996.|$|E
25|$|Not {{long after}} the -6 entered service, an {{increase}} in thrust and therefore core power was required. Unable to increase (HP) turbine rotor inlet temperature, General Electric chose the expensive path of reconfiguring the CF6 core to increase its basic size. They removed two stages {{from the rear of}} the HP compressor, leaving an empty air passage where the blades and vanes had once been. Two <b>booster</b> <b>stages</b> were added to the LP (low pressure) compressor, which increased the overall pressure ratio to 29.3. Although the 86.4 in (2.19 m) diameter fan was retained, the airflow was raised to 1,450lb/s (660kg/s), yielding a static thrust of 51,000lbf (227kN). The increase in core size and overall pressure ratio raised the core flow, decreasing the bypass ratio to 4.26.|$|E
5000|$|After {{the second}} stage {{separated}} from the <b>booster</b> <b>stage,</b> SpaceX conducted a novel flight test where the booster conducted a test to attempt to reenter the lower atmosphere {{in a controlled manner}} and decelerate to a simulated over-water landing. [...] The test was successful, but the <b>booster</b> <b>stage</b> was not recovered.|$|R

50|$|The Ghauri-II design {{improves}} accuracy by an employing {{mechanisms that}} spin the single <b>booster</b> <b>stage</b> and warhead combination approximately 10 {{seconds before the}} termination of the powered flight phase at 110 seconds. At this point, the warhead is then separated from the <b>booster</b> <b>stage</b> to fly on a re-entry trajectory that remains stable to its target, greatly enhancing the missile's accuracy. With the addition of GPS targeting the warhead accuracy is further enhanced.|$|R

50|$|This {{configuration}} {{was dropped}} {{when it was}} determined that the HG-3-SL could not compete with the J-2 in terms of overall performance, reliability, and cost-effectiveness. This required the addition of <b>booster</b> <b>stages</b> in order to provide more takeoff thrust.|$|E

50|$|STS-51-G carried three {{communications}} satellites as {{its primary}} cargo. These were Arabsat-1B (Arab Satellite Communications Organization); Morelos I (Mexico); and Telstar 3D (AT&T Corporation). All three successfully utilized PAM-D <b>booster</b> <b>stages</b> to achieve geosynchronous transfer orbits after being deployed from Discovery.|$|E
50|$|Two {{or three}} similar stages are stacked {{side by side}} and burn in parallel. Using crossfeed, the fuel tanks of the orbital stage are kept full, while the tank(s) in the <b>booster</b> <b>stage(s)</b> are used to run engines in the <b>booster</b> <b>stage(s)</b> and orbital stage. Once the {{boosters}} run dry, they are ejected, and (typically) glide back to a landing. The advantage to {{this is that the}} mass ratios of the individual stages are vastly reduced due to the way cross feed modifies the rocket equation. Isp*g*ln(2MR^2/MR+1) & Isp*g*ln(3MR^2/MR+2) respectively. With hydrogen engines, a triamese only needs an MR of 5, as opposed to an MR of 10 for a single-stage equivalent vehicle.|$|E

5000|$|After {{the loss}} of NS1, a second New Shepard vehicle was built, NS2. Its first flight, and the second test flight of New Shepard overall, was carried out on 23 November 2015, {{reaching}} 100.5 km altitude with successful recovery of both capsule and <b>booster</b> <b>stage.</b> The <b>booster</b> rocket successfully performed a powered vertical landing.
