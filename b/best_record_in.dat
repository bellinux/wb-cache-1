5|$|The playoff {{structure}} {{used from}} 1933 to 1966 was considered inequitable by some {{because of the}} number of times it failed to match the teams with the two best records in the championship game, as only the conference winners would qualify for playoff contention. Four times between 1950 and 1966 (in 1951, 1956, 1960, and 1963) the team with the second-best win-loss record did not qualify for the playoffs while the team with the <b>best</b> <b>record</b> <b>in</b> the other conference, but only the third-best in the league, would advance to the championship game.|$|E

The division clinching season finale was highlighted by kick returner Dave Meggett's first career punt return for a touchdown. Though many people predicted an NFC Championship showdown between the Giants and the 49ers, the Giants lost their divisional playoff game to the Rams 19–13 in overtime. The highlight of the game was wide receiver Flipper Anderson's catch of the game-winning touchdown pass over cornerback Mark Collins. After he caught the pass, Anderson raced down the sideline, through the end zone, and into the tunnel {{that led to the}} locker rooms, silencing the crowd.|$|E
