25|$|A {{transmembrane protein}} (TP) {{is a type}} of {{integral}} membrane protein that spans the entirety of the <b>biological</b> <b>membrane</b> to which it is permanently attached.

25|$|Peripheral {{membrane}} proteins are membrane {{proteins that}} adhere only temporarily to the <b>biological</b> <b>membrane</b> {{with which they}} are associated. These proteins attach to integral membrane proteins, or penetrate the peripheral regions of the lipid bilayer. The regulatory protein subunits of many ion channels and transmembrane receptors, for example, may be defined as peripheral membrane proteins. In contrast to integral membrane proteins, peripheral membrane proteins tend to collect in the water-soluble component, or fraction, of all the proteins extracted during a protein purification procedure. Proteins with GPI anchors are an exception to this rule and can have purification properties similar to those of integral membrane proteins.|$|E
25|$|The cell membrane, or plasma membrane, is a <b>biological</b> <b>membrane</b> that {{surrounds}} the cytoplasm of a cell. In animals, the plasma membrane is the outer boundary of the cell, while in plants and prokaryotes it is usually covered by a cell wall. This membrane serves to separate and protect a cell from its surrounding environment and is made mostly from a double layer of phospholipids, which are amphiphilic (partly hydrophobic and partly hydrophilic). Hence, the layer is called a phospholipid bilayer, or sometimes a fluid mosaic membrane. Embedded within this membrane is a variety of protein molecules that act as channels and pumps that move different molecules {{into and out of}} the cell. The membrane is said to be 'semi-permeable', in that it can either let a substance (molecule or ion) pass through freely, pass through to a limited extent or not pass through at all. Cell surface membranes also contain receptor proteins that allow cells to detect external signaling molecules such as hormones.|$|E

500|$|A <b>biological</b> <b>membrane</b> {{is a form}} of {{lamellar}} phase lipid bilayer. The {{formation of}} lipid bilayers is an energetically preferred process when the glycerophospholipids described above are in an aqueous environment. This is known as the hydrophobic effect. In an aqueous system, the polar heads of lipids align towards the polar, aqueous environment, while the hydrophobic tails minimize their contact with water and tend to cluster together, forming a vesicle; depending on the concentration of the lipid, this biophysical interaction may result in the formation of micelles, liposomes, or lipid bilayers. Other aggregations are also observed and form part of the polymorphism of amphiphile (lipid) behavior. Phase behavior is an area of study within biophysics and is the subject of current academic research. Micelles and bilayers form in the polar medium by a process known as the hydrophobic effect. When dissolving a lipophilic or amphiphilic substance in a polar environment, the polar molecules (i.e., water in an aqueous solution) become more ordered around the dissolved lipophilic substance, since the polar molecules cannot form hydrogen bonds to the lipophilic areas of the amphiphile. So in an aqueous environment, the water molecules form an ordered [...] "clathrate" [...] cage around the dissolved lipophilic molecule.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{this review}} article, we {{summarize}} {{the current state}} of biophysical knowledge concerning the phase behavior and organization of cardiolipin (CL) and CL-containing phospholipid bilayer model membranes. We first briefly consider the occurrence and distribution of CL in <b>biological</b> <b>membranes</b> and its probable biological functions therein. We next consider the unique chemical structure of the CL molecule and how this structure may determine its distinctive physical properties. We then consider in some detail the thermotropic phase behavior and organization of CL and CL-containing lipid model membranes as revealed by a variety of biophysical techniques. We also attempt to relate the chemical properties of CL to its function in the <b>biological</b> <b>membranes</b> in which it occurs. Finally, we point out the requirement for additional biophysical studies of both lipid model and <b>biological</b> <b>membranes</b> in order to increase our currently limited understanding of the relationship between CL structure and physical properties and CL function in <b>biological</b> <b>membranes...</b>|$|R

Sequence analysis of high-resolution membrane protein structures show that ionizable amino acid residues are present in transmembrane (TM) helices, often with a functional and/or structural role. Here, using as scaffold the hydrophobic TM domain of the model membrane protein glycophorin A (GpA), we address the consequences of replacing specific residues by ionizable amino acids on TM helix insertion and packing, both in detergent micelles and in <b>biological</b> <b>membranes.</b> Our findings demonstrate that ionizable residues are stably inserted in hydrophobic environments, and tolerated in the dimerization process when oriented toward the lipid face, emphasizing the complexity of protein-lipid interactions in <b>biological</b> <b>membranes...</b>|$|R
40|$|Fluorescence {{lifetime}} imaging microscopy (FLIM) is {{a powerful}} tool to investigate the structure and composition of <b>biological</b> <b>membranes.</b> A wide variety of fluorescent probes suitable for FLIM experiments have been described. These compounds differ strongly {{in the details of}} their incorporation into membranes and in their responses toward changes in the membrane composition. In this chapter, we discuss and compare different classes of fluorescent membranes probes and their applications to studying <b>biological</b> <b>membranes.</b> We devote a section to a detailed description of fluorescent molecular rotors and their application to measuring local viscosity. As Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) can be directly measured by changes in the donor fluorescence lifetime, FLIM is a very robust method to determine the distances between FRET pairs or the local concentrations of FRET-based membrane probes. Thus, we also discuss advantages and challenges of FRET-FLIM in the context of <b>biological</b> <b>membranes.</b> As <b>biological</b> <b>membranes</b> are considerably dynamic systems, imaging speed is often the limiting factor in biological FLIM experiments. Thus, novel fast imaging approaches and analysis methods to alleviate the issue of low photon statistics are also presented...|$|R
