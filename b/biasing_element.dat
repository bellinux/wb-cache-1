A phase change power unit, including a plunger connected to the transfer plate, is in thermal contact with the first thermally conductive plate. A <b>biasing</b> <b>element,</b> connected to the transfer plate, biases the transfer plate in a predetermined position with respect to the first and second plates.

40|$|Abstract—Mother-infant vocal {{communication}} {{is a sort}} of mys-tery of human cognitive development since they can communicate although their body structures and therefore their utterable areas are different. This paper proposes a method that aids unconscious guidance in mutual imitation for infant development based on a <b>biasing</b> <b>element</b> with two different kinds of modules. The first is based on the normal magnet effect in perceiving heard vocal sounds as the listener’s own vowels (perceptual magnet) and also includes another magnet effect for imitating vocal sounds that resemble the imitator’s vowels (articulatory magnet). The second is based on what we call “auto mirroring bias, ” by which the heard vowel is much closer to the expected vowel because the other’s utterance is an imitation of the listener’s own utterance. Computer simulation results of mother-infant interaction show the validity of the proposed bias. Finally future issues are discussed. I...|$|E

Structural analogy of early methyl-triazolo BET inhibitors has prompted a need for structurally dissimilar ligands as probes of bromodomain function. Using fluorous-tagged multicomponent reactions, we developed a focused chemical library of bromodomain inhibitors around a 3, 5 -dimethylisoxazole <b>biasing</b> <b>element</b> with micromolar biochemical IC 50. Iterative synthesis and biochemical assessment allowed optimization of novel BET bromodomain inhibitors based on an imidazo[1, 2 -a]pyrazine scaffold. Lead compound 32 (UMB- 32) binds BRD 4 with a Kd of 550 nM and 724 nM cellular potency in BRD 4 -dependent lines. Additionally, compound 32 shows potency against TAF 1, a bromodomain-containing transcription factor previously unapproached by discovery chemistry. Compound 32 was cocrystallized with BRD 4, yielding a 1. 56 Å resolution crystal structure.

The signal-to-noise ratio of the microphone-preamplifier combination, containing a field-effect transistor (FET) and a high value resistive <b>bias</b> <b>element</b> in a hybrid configuration, is mainly determined by the noise generated in the preamplifier circuit. A theoretical analysis of the noise sources in a source follower is given.

An additional class of Santacruzamate-A derivatives was synthesized to investigate {{the influence of the}} cap group and the linker element on HDAC inhibitory activity. All compounds were evaluated in dose response for their in vitro cytotoxic activity in MTT assay in HCT 116 cells. HDAC inhibitory activity was evaluated in vitro by western blot analysis for histone hyperacetylation assay and biochemically for representative human HDACs isoforms. Two novel compounds were identified to exhibit potent time dependent anti proliferative activity. However, unlike hydroxamic acid analogues, the tested Santacruzamate-A derivatives showed no noticeable HDAC inhibitory activity. The ethylcarbamate moiety as unusual zinc-binding group displayed no ability to coordinate the zinc ion and thus, presumably, was not able to reproduce known inhibitor-substrate zinc-binding group interactions with the HDAC catalytic site.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{structure}} which {{is capable of}} being fabricated into two distinct devices, both with considerable potential {{in the field of}} optical communications in particular with reference to wavelength domain multiplexing. The structure is based on two back to back p-i-n Ga x Al 1 -x As structures with a single quantum well of GaAs in each intrinsic region. The light emitter device operates by forward biasing either of the p-i-n <b>elements.</b> In forward <b>bias</b> holes flood into the quantum well in the intrinsic region. Electrons are prevented from doing so by a potential barrier. A longitudinal electric field applied along the central n-doped region heats the electrons in this region and gives them sufficient energy to overcome the barrier and flood into the quantum well and hence recombine with holes which are already present. The wavelength converter device operates with one p-i-n structure forward biased and one reverse biased. The forward <b>biased</b> <b>element</b> has a quantum well positioned near the p-doped region. Light of the appropriate wavelength is absorbed in this quantum well. The holes scatter out of the quantum well and drift into the p- doped region. The electrons are scattered out of the quantum well and drift towards the n-doped region, creating additional carriers through impact ionization, thereby creating gain. The electrons flooding over the n-doped region, must overcome a potential barrier to enter the forward <b>biased</b> <b>element,</b> therefore cold electrons are prevented from entering this region. Electrons which are able to overcome the barrier fall into a quantum well positioned near the barrier, where holes are already waiting, as in the light emitting device. © 2003 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering...|$|R

Employing multiple tethers biased to high positive voltage levels (kV), electric sails are designed to gain momentum from the solar wind by repelling solar wind protons. To maximize {{the area of the}} sail that interacts with the solar wind, electric sails rely on the formation of a large plasma sheath around each small diameter tether. Motivated by interest in advancing the development of electric sails, a set of laboratory tests has been conducted to study the interaction of a drifting plasma with a sheath formed around a small diameter tether <b>element</b> <b>biased</b> at positive voltages.

40|$|Background/Aim:- A {{study of}} voting {{decisions}} in The Weakest Link TV game show {{has shown the}} contestants tend to avoid their nearest neighbours (Goddard, Hylton, Parke & Noh, 2013), presumably {{this is because the}} vote carries negative connotations. Therefore, the aim {{of this study was to}} test whether vote valence affects voting behaviour in other voting scenarios. Procedure:- Participants were undergraduate Psychology students (n= 233) attending an orientation lecture during their first induction week. A unique seat number was assigned and once seated, participants were given a response sheet, with a seating plan of the lecture, and instructed to cast a vote for someone else in the lecture theatre by placing an ‘X’ on the seating plan. Vote valence varied (- 5,- 1, 0,+ 1, + 5) according to how many ‘vouchers’ were to be added/subtracted in an ensuing lottery for course related ‘prizes’. Result/Discussion:- Participants significantly avoided voting for their nearest neighbour when their vote carried a negative weight, However, those making a positive valence vote, showed an opposite pattern whereby, they were more likely to pick their nearest neighbour. We suggest that for our participants the ‘fairness norm’ was stronger in negative valence voters compared to positive valence voters (Leliveld, Beest, Dijk & Tenbrunsel, 2009). Hence, ‘valence’ and the ‘neighbour effect’ are robust <b>biasing</b> <b>elements</b> in decision making probably operating at an unconscious, implicit level...|$|R

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis encompasses the design, development, realization and testing of novel magnetoelectric thin film elements that do not rely on ferromagnets, but are based entirely on magnetoelectric antiferromagnets such as Cr 2 O 3. Thin film spintronic elements, and in particular magnetoelectric transducers, are crucial building blocks of high efficiency data processing schemes that could complement conventional electronic data processing in the future. Recent developments in magnetoelectrics have revealed, that exchange biased systems are ill-suited to electric field induced switching of magnetization due to the strong coupling of their ferromagnetic layer to magnetic fields. Therefore, ferromagnet-free magnetoelectric elements are proposed here {{in an effort to}} mitigate the practical problems associated with existing exchange <b>biased</b> magnetoelectric <b>elements.</b> This goal is achieved by establishing an all-electric read-out method for the antiferromagnetic order parameter of thin films, which allows to omit the ferromagnet from conventional exchange <b>biased</b> magnetoelectric <b>elements.</b> The resulting ferromagnet-free magnetoelectric elements show greatly reduced writing thresholds, enabled operation at room temperature and do not require a pulsed magnetic field, all of which is in contrast to state-of-the-art exchange biased magnetoelectric systems. The novel all-electric read-out method of the magnetic field-invariant magnetization of antiferromagnets, so-called spinning-current anomalous Hall magnetometry, can be widely employed in other areas of thin film magnetism. Its high precision and its sensitivity to previously invisible phenomena make it a promising tool for various aspects of thin solid films. Based on this technique, a deep understanding could be generated as to what physical mechanisms drive the antiferromagnetic ordering in thin films of magnetoelectric antiferromagnets. As spinning-current anomalous Hall magnetometry is an integral probe of the magnetic properties in thin films, it offers no intrinsic scale sensitivity. In order to harness its great precision for scale related information, a statistical framework was developed, which links macroscopic measurements with microscopic properties such as the antiferromagnetic domain size...|$|R
