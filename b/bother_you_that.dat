500|$|After the {{completion}} of composing [...] "Fifteen", Swift became very nervous to show Anderson the song, for {{she did not know}} how her friend would respond. [...] "It was a really personal song, especially from her angle of it." [...] However, when Swift performed the song for Anderson and asked whether she was comfortable with the song, Anderson confirmed: [...] "She said, 'Does it <b>bother</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> your name is in a song that's so personal?' And it really doesn't just because of the way Taylor and I feel about it. If one girl can kind of learn from it or connect to a song like that, it's totally worth it." [...] With Anderson's consent, Swift recorded [...] "Fifteen" [...] with producer Nathan Chapman, who produced all but one track on Swift's 2006 eponymous debut album, Taylor Swift. Recording the highly personal track caused Swift to cry. Swift attributed the event to {{the fact that she is}} most likely to cry over when her loved ones undergo pain, as she witnesses it, rather than her own experiences. She went to say [...] "Fifteen" [...] usually gets her every time.|$|E

[...] He replied, ...yes, in the beginning it bothered me that people singled it out and poked fun at it. They didn't know what I was doing. The album The Transformed Man is much more extensive than that song. But since people only heard that song, I {{went along with the}} joke.|$|E
5000|$|The story largely seems {{obsessed with}} the {{definition}} of gender, man? or women? does the flesh matter? What about the soul? It also talks about marriage and child birth. There are multiple references to bulls, fields, soil and seeds as euphemisms for sex and conception, and to illuminate the vexing question of “ownership” that arises when a woman is made pregnant by someone other than her husband. And {{then there are those}} troublesome dead ancestors, the “pitrs”, waiting for the arrival of a child so they can be reborn {{in the land of the}} living. Taking the form of crows, they perch outside bedchambers, waiting for quick results, flapping their wings impatiently when foreplay goes on for too long. (“Does it not <b>bother</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> your son’s seed is weak?” one of them indelicately asks Shilavati.) ...|$|E

5000|$|Deen {{has faced}} {{extensive}} criticism {{for the high}} amounts of fat, salt, and sugar in her recipes. She faced particularly strong objections {{with the release of}} Cookbook for the Lunch-Box Set, a cookbook aimed at children, with Barbara Walters saying of the book, [...] "You tell kids to have cheesecake for breakfast. You tell them to have chocolate cake and meatloaf for lunch. And french fries. Doesn't it <b>bother</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> you're adding to this?" [...] Celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain commented in 2011 that he [...] "would think twice before telling an already obese nation that it's OK to eat food that is killing us". On January 17, 2012, Deen announced that she had been diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes three years before. It was also disclosed that Deen is a paid spokesperson for the Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk. She was called a hypocrite for continuing to promote her high-fat and sugar diet while disclosing her medical condition only when it benefited her in representing the drug company to market their diabetes management program.|$|E

5000|$|Tommy {{learned at}} first from G.G. Armstrong, and {{subsequently}} taking further lessons {{for two years}} from Tom Clough after Armstrong gave up teaching through ill-health. He also learned the Highland pipes - it is rare to master both instruments, with their very different fingering and sound. He was perhaps the last piper to have known the playing of the Cloughs directly. He described Tom Clough's set of exercises, which he said were similar to G.G. Armstrong's. They consisted of scales and arpeggios - the pupil would have to start slowly, and increase speed till mistakes happened. Another group of exercises, based on variation sets, are all found in the four tunes Fenwick of Bywell, Jacky Layton, Felton Lonnen and Oh dear, what can the matter be. He also gave a description of Tom Clough's meticulous teaching technique: He made you break a tune down and play it bar by bar. If there was a bar <b>bothering</b> <b>you,</b> <b>you</b> played <b>that</b> bar until <b>you</b> got it right. Then you put the bars together, then put the measure together, and then eventually the tune together. Finally you could {{start at the beginning}} and go through it.|$|R

The dog happens upon the girl while she was exploring the Fortress of Solitude and attacks, {{going so far as}} to use his heat vision and other potentially lethal attacks. Batman, who distrusted Kara at that time, pointed this out as an argument that Kara might not be who she says she is when he remarks [...] "Doesn't it <b>bother</b> <b>you</b> at all <b>that</b> the dog hates her?" [...] Superman's response was [...] "It's his job to protect the fortress while he's here. Besides...the dog hates everybody." ...|$|R

He could show you how to do things. I don't quite know how he did it!. He described Tom Clough's set of exercises, which he said were similar to G.G.

Either they are unavoidable if your living questions are fully discussed, or they are irrelevant and they do not matter. That there is a wisdom and beauty in the classics which is incommunicable in any modern language, which obviously neither ennobles nor empowers, but which is nevertheless supremely precious, is a kind of nonsense dear to the second-rate classical don, but it has nothing endearing about it for any other human beings.
