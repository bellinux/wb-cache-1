5000|$|<b>Bond</b> <b>insurers</b> {{generally}} insure only securities {{that have}} underlying or [...] "shadow" [...] ratings in the investment grade category, with unenhanced ratings ranging from “triple-B” to “triple-A.” [...] Beginning in the 1970s, municipal government bonds were insured by <b>bond</b> <b>insurers,</b> {{also known as}} the “monolines.” Although the global financial crisis of 2008 caused most <b>bond</b> <b>insurers</b> to cease issuing insurance policies, bond insurance has continued to remain available from highly rated providers, including legacy insurers and new industry participants.|$|R

50|$|MBIA, Inc. is a {{financial}} services company. It {{was founded in}} 1973 as the Municipal Bond Insurance Association. It is headquartered in Purchase, New York, and as of January 1, 2015 had approximately 180 employees. MBIA is the largest <b>bond</b> <b>insurer.</b>|$|E
50|$|In January 2012, Assured Guaranty {{acquired}} MIAC from Radian Asset {{and later}} renamed it Municipal Assurance Corp. ("MAC"). Assured Guaranty launched MAC in July 2013 as a municipal only <b>bond</b> <b>insurer.</b> In December 2014, Assured Guaranty acquired Radian Asset, which was fully merged into AGC in April 2015.|$|E
5000|$|Financial Guaranty Insurance Company (FGIC) is a {{monoline}} <b>bond</b> <b>insurer</b> {{established in}} 1983. It faced significant financial difficulties in 2008 which affected {{its ability to}} write new business. [...] The firm was acquired in December 2003 by a consortium of investors including PMI Group, Blackstone Group, The Cypress Group and CIVC Partners.|$|E
5000|$|Bond {{insurance}} {{of residential}} mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) commenced in the 1980s but expanded at an accelerated pace in the 2000s, {{leading up to}} the 2008 financial crisis. As the housing bubble grew in the mid-2000s, <b>bond</b> <b>insurers</b> generally increased the collateral protection required for RMBS. However, both the <b>bond</b> <b>insurers</b> and the rating agencies that evaluated their credit did not anticipate the collapse of the real estate market that precipitated the financial crisis and the magnitude of the disruption to the residential mortgage market that accompanied the financial crisis. In addition, following the crisis, the <b>bond</b> <b>insurers</b> became aware that many RMBS they had insured included large percentages of loans that were ineligible for securitization and were subject to repurchase by, or [...] "putback" [...] obligations of, the RMBS sponsors, in originating the securitizations due to a breach of applicable representations and warranties ("R&W") regarding the securitized mortgage loans.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike {{mortgage}} insurance, {{bond insurance}} generally provides for unconditional payment of claims, although the insurer reserves {{the right to}} pursue contractual or other available remedies. As a result, the <b>bond</b> <b>insurers</b> were faced with {{billions of dollars of}} claims to insured security holders associated with their exposure to RMBS following the financial crisis, with uncertain prospects for recoveries from the sponsors of the securitizations giving rise to those claims. One indication of the extent of loan quality misrepresentation was the settlement in 2011 between Assured Guaranty and Bank of America, which had purchased mortgage originator Countrywide. Under the terms of the settlement, Bank of America made a $1.1 billion payment to Assured Guaranty and agreed to cover 80% of up to $6.6 billion of Assured Guaranty’s future paid losses from breaches of representations and warranties on 21 insured RMBS transactions. [...] Subsequently, in 2013, in the first R&W trial to reach a judgment, Flagstar Bank was required to compensate Assured Guaranty in full for past and future claims. The amounts that Assured Guaranty caused R&W providers to pay or commit to pay through putbacks and settlements plus the amount of future projected losses that Assured Guaranty avoided through negotiated terminations totaled approximately $4.2 billion as of March 31, 2015. While the widespread misrepresentations caused <b>bond</b> <b>insurers</b> to experience considerable losses on insured securities backed by residential mortgage loans (including first lien loans, second lien loans, and home equity lines of credit), the most severe losses were experienced by those monolines that insured CDOs backed by mezzanine RMBS. Although the <b>bond</b> <b>insurers</b> generally insured such CDOs at very high attachment points or collateral levels (with underlying ratings of triple-A), those <b>bond</b> <b>insurers</b> and the rating agencies failed to anticipate the correlation of performance of the underlying securities. Specifically, these <b>bond</b> <b>insurers</b> and rating agencies relied upon historical data that did not prove predictive of residential mortgage loan performance following the 2008 crisis, which witnessed the first-ever nationwide decline in housing prices. Notably, AGM and AGC did not insure such CDOs, which has allowed Assured Guaranty to continue writing business throughout the financial crisis and ensuing recession and recovery.|$|R
50|$|The {{financial}} crisis {{that began in}} late 2007 negatively impacted the <b>bond</b> <b>insurers.</b> Beginning in 2008, the financial guaranty insurers became subject to rating agency downgrades, {{largely as a result}} of their exposure to RMBS, either directly or through insurance of collateralized debt obligations of asset-based securities (so-called “CDOs of ABS”), which included CDOs backed by mezzanine RMBS. Insurers that guaranteed CDOs of ABS suffered the most extreme losses.|$|R
50|$|In 2009, Assured Guaranty {{acquired}} FSA {{and subsequently}} renamed it Assured Guaranty Municipal (“AGM”), thus combining {{under the same}} ownership the two most highly rated bond insurers at that time. As a result, Assured Guaranty was to become the only legacy <b>bond</b> <b>insurer</b> to write insurance continuously from the pre-crisis period to the present.|$|E
50|$|Detroit {{would reach}} deals with of {{more of its}} {{creditors}} throughout the fall. In September {{it would come to}} terms with <b>bond</b> <b>insurer</b> Syncora that had $400 million claim, they would receive $25 million in cash and bonds. They also received a 20-year lease extension their operation of the Detroit-Windsor Tunnel and 30-year lease of the underground garage at Grand Circus Park.|$|E
50|$|From 19901993, Berger joined Financial Guaranty Insurance Co., a {{municipal}} <b>bond</b> <b>insurer</b> wholly owned by GE Capital, as Chairman and CEO in 1990 and was appointed Executive Vice-President of GE Capital in 1992. He {{was responsible for}} a portfolio of companies including the Corporate Finance Group, Private Equity Investment, Railcar Services, Transport International Pool, GE Capital Modular Space and The Financial Guaranty Insurance Company.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1990s and early 2000s {{a new group}} of <b>bond</b> <b>insurers</b> emerged. These {{included}} ACA Financial Guaranty Corp. (1997); XL Capital Assurance Inc. ("XLCA") (2000), initially a subsidiary of XL Capital Ltd. before being spun off in 2006 and subsequently renamed [...] "Syncora Guarantee Inc."; and CIFG (2001). This era also saw the emergence of new reinsurers, such as Ram Reinsurance Company Ltd. ("Ram Re") and AXA Re Finance.|$|R
50|$|AGM, {{which had}} been {{insuring}} RMBS since its inception as FSA, experienced only minor losses in that sector before the 2008 financial crisis. AGM also insured the first collateralized debt obligation (“CDO”) in 1988. By 2008, the insurance of ABS - including RMBS, CDOs, and collateralized loan obligations (“CLOs”) - had grown into significant business sectors for <b>bond</b> <b>insurers.</b> Insurance of ABS {{took the form of}} financial guaranty policies and insured credit default swaps (“CDS").|$|R
5000|$|Dozens {{of suits}} {{involving}} claims of inaccurate ratings were {{filed against the}} rating agencies by investors. Plaintiffs have included by collateralized debt obligation investors (the state of Ohio for losses of $457 million, California state employees for $1 billion), the bankrupt investment bank Bear Stearns (for losses of $1.12 billion from alleged [...] "fraudulently issuing inflated ratings for securities"), <b>bond</b> <b>insurers.</b> [...] The US government is also a plaintiff (suing S&P for $5 billion for [...] "misrepresenting the credit risk of complex financial products").|$|R
50|$|Then he exposed {{accounting}} {{questions about}} MBIA, the <b>bond</b> <b>insurer.</b> Much of his {{focus was on}} the controversial retroactive reinsurance transaction involving the Allegheny Health, Education and Research Foundation (AHERF), which {{was the focus of}} separate investigations by the SEC, the New York Attorney General and the New York State Insurance Department. The company settled the case by paying $75 million in penalties and disgorgement.|$|E
50|$|In 2002, activist {{hedge fund}} manager Bill Ackman {{challenged}} <b>bond</b> <b>insurer</b> MBIA's AAA rating {{calling for a}} division between MBIA's bond insurers' structured finance business and its municipal bond insurance side. Ackman published a report raising extensive concerns about MBIA's continued solvency. He gave Schroeder’s team an early draft and suggested they downgrade MBIA, but they initially resisted. Schroeder and her colleague Vinay Saqi eventually responded to Ackman’s report, partially acknowledging Ackman’s thesis.|$|E
50|$|On October 16 {{lawyers for}} the city and Financial Guaranty Insurance Company (FGIC), a <b>bond</b> <b>insurer</b> with a $1 billion claim, {{disclosed}} in court that they had reached a deal to settle the company's claims. Under the deal, the city and state would pay for the demolition of the city-owned Joe Louis Arena once the Red Wings move into the new arena. After demolition, FGIC would receive the arena site and an adjacent parking lot, giving the company nearly 9 acres (3.6 ha) for redevelopment.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Bond</b> <b>insurers</b> are {{sometimes}} {{also referred to}} as [...] "financial guaranty insurance companies" [...] or [...] "financial guarantors." [...] Companies whose sole line of business is providing a particular type of insurance, in this case bond insurance, are called monoline insurers. Note that the insurance term “monoline” means only that these companies do not have other insurance lines, such as life or property/casualty. It does not mean they operate only in one securities market, such as municipal bonds, as the term is sometimes misconstrued.|$|R
40|$|Municipal {{bonds are}} often insured by {{insurance}} companies that promise to pay investors {{in the event of}} default {{on the part of the}} issuer. However, just as the financial strength of the insurer can provide assurance to investors, questions about insurer stability may heighten investor concerns. This paper considers three major downgrades to large municipal <b>bond</b> <b>insurers</b> and the effects of each downgrade on a large sample of municipal bonds. Results reveal the effects to be widespread: not only are risk premiums on bonds insured by the downgraded insurer affected, but so are those on bonds insured by other insurance companies.

50|$|Tavakoli is {{an outspoken}} critic of the 2008 Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) for {{financial}} institutions. She points out that many decisions made appear to favour companies with connections to government officials making the decisions. In particular, she criticizes the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, headed by Timothy Geithner at the time, for deciding to pay Goldman Sachs and other financial firms 100 cents on the dollar for billions of dollars of troubled AIG credit default swaps, while other <b>bond</b> <b>insurers</b> have settled similar contracts for as little as ten cents on the dollar. AIG had been trying to persuade the banks to settle for a discount of 40 cents on the dollar.|$|R
5000|$|CIVC {{experienced}} {{difficulties in}} 2008 with its high-profile {{investment in the}} Financial Guaranty Insurance Company (also known as FGIC), a <b>bond</b> <b>insurer.</b> CIVC's major past and present investments include: LA Fitness, a health club operator; First Franklin, a sub-prime mortgage bank; The Brickman Group, a commercial landscaping company; Thermo Fluids, an environmental services company; KS Energy Services, a utility services provider; TransWestern Publishing, a publisher of yellow pages directories; Goldline International, a direct marketer of numismatic and bullion coins; and [...] Wintrust Financial Corporation, a regional bank holding company.|$|E
5000|$|As {{soon as a}} court stay expired on May 2, 2017, {{bondholders}} and a <b>bond</b> <b>insurer</b> {{sued the}} Commonwealth for full and timely debt repayment. [...] On May 3, Governor Rosselló reacted by asking the Oversight Board to file in federal district court for debt relief under PROMESA, proceedings which will be very similar to bankruptcy. [...] On May 5, Chief Justice John Roberts assigned the case to Judge Laura Taylor Swain of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. [...] That day, the Puerto Rico Department of Education announced plans to close 184 schools.|$|E
5000|$|Bennet was {{appointed}} superintendent of Denver Public Schools on June 27, 2005, taking {{office on the}} following July 1. Bennet had no experience as a school administrator. In 2008, Bennet persuaded the Denver Board of Education {{to enter into a}} 30-year, $750 million financial bond transaction with variable interest rates designed to fluctuate as economic conditions changed. The New York Times wrote that [...] "In short order, the transaction went awry because of stress in the credit markets, problems with the <b>bond</b> <b>insurer</b> and plummeting interest rates." [...] As of 2010, the school system had paid $115 million in interest and other fees, at least $25 million more than it originally anticipated.|$|E
50|$|The market {{environment}} {{at the time}} was not inconsistent with an increase in counterparty risk and a higher degree of information asymmetry. In the second half of 2007, market participants and regulators started to become aware of the risks in securitized products and derivatives. Many banks {{were in the process of}} writing down the values of their mortgage-related portfolios. House prices were falling all over the country and the ratings agencies had just started to downgrade subprime mortgages. Concerns about structured investment vehicles (SIVs) and mortgage and <b>bond</b> <b>insurers</b> were growing. Moreover, there was very high uncertainty about how to value complex securitized instruments and where in the financial system these securities were concentrated.|$|R
50|$|Until the 2008 {{financial}} crisis, the <b>bond</b> <b>insurers</b> suffered few material losses, with {{notable exceptions}} in the municipal sector including the losses experienced by Ambac in 1984 on its {{exposure to the}} Washington Public Power Supply System (WPPSS), which {{was the subject of}} an adverse court ruling (see The History of Bond Insurance, below), and by MBIA in 1998 on its exposure to Allegheny Health, Education and Research Foundation (AHERF), which declared bankruptcy. The purported benefit for the insurers was that they had very stable profits from a market that almost never defaulted. As publicbonds.org points out, a 1994 BusinessWeek article called MBIA “an almost perfect money machine.” The BusinessWeek story noted that up to 1994, MBIA had only one loss.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the event}} of default on all the {{underlying}} obligations, the premiums paid by Party A to Party C in the above example would be paid back to Party A until exhausted. The next question is who actually pays for the remaining credit risk on the less risky tranches, {{as well as the}} [...] "super-senior" [...] risk that was never structured into tranches at all (because it was thought that no properly structured synthetic CDO would actually undergo complete default). In reality, many banks simply kept the super-senior risk on their own books or insured it through severely undercapitalized [...] "monoline" [...] <b>bond</b> <b>insurers.</b> [...] In turn, the growing mountains of super-senior risk caused major problems during the subprime mortgage crisis.|$|R
5000|$|On July 20, 2014, {{following}} the July 2013 {{approval of a}} $650 million project {{to build a new}} sports and entertainment district in Downtown Detroit, Christopher Ilitch unveiled designs for a new arena near Comerica Park and Ford Field to be completed by 2017, which will succeed Joe Louis Arena as the future home of the Red Wings. Joe Louis Arena will be demolished {{following the}} completion of the new arena, and its site will be redeveloped. On October 16, 2014, lawyers involved in the ongoing Detroit bankruptcy case disclosed in court that after demolition (which will be paid for by the city and state), the land on which the arena currently stands, along with an adjacent parking lot, will be transferred to the Financial Guaranty Insurance Company (FGIC), a <b>bond</b> <b>insurer</b> with a $1 billion claim against the city.|$|E
50|$|The city of Chicago's Department of Streets and Sanitation {{formerly}} {{maintained the}} Chicago Skyway Toll Bridge System. A transaction {{that gave the}} city of Chicago a $1.83 billion cash infusion leased the Skyway to the Skyway Concession Company (SCC), a joint-venture between the Australian Macquarie Infrastructure Group and Spanish Cintra Concesiones de Infraestructuras de Transporte S.A., which assumed operations on the Skyway on a 99-year operating lease. SCC {{will be responsible for}} all operating and maintenance costs of the Skyway but has the right to all toll and concession revenue. The Triple-A <b>bond</b> <b>insurer</b> Financial Security Assurance Inc. (FSA) has guaranteed $1.4 billion of senior bonds to provide long-term funding for the privately operated Chicago Skyway. On June 30, 2006, this same joint-venture assumed responsibility for operating and maintaining the adjacent Indiana East-West Toll Road for $3.8 billion. The agreement between SCC and the city of Chicago marked the first time an existing toll road was moved from public to private operation in the United States.|$|E
5000|$|Also in 2009, MBIA {{separated}} its {{municipal bond}} insurance business from its other mostly asset-backed business, and formed [...] "National Public Finance Guarantee Corp." [...] (“National”) {{as an investment}} grade municipal <b>bond</b> <b>insurer</b> with the municipal bond insurance business that previously resided in MBIA. In January 2017, MBIA sold its U.K. subsidiary to AGC. Continuing the trend of reorganization in 2009, Ambac ceased writing business and was ultimately split into (i) a “segregated account” subject to a rehabilitation order by the Wisconsin Office of the Commissioner of Insurance (“OCI”) and (ii) a “general account” for ongoing operations, limited to municipal bond insurance. Ongoing litigation challenges the allocation of Ambac’s “asset-backed” and select other troubled business to its segregated account. By order of the New York State Insurance Department, FGIC ceased paying claims in 2010 and is in run-off, now paying claims in part. Syncora Guarantee Inc. (“Syncora”), CIFG, Radian Asset and Ram Re remain solvent but are generally not writing new business. Radian Asset was acquired by and merged into AGC in April 2015. AGC later acquired CIFG in July 2016. Ram Re has been renamed American Overseas Re and has been redomesticated to Barbados. They never filed for bankruptcy and are writing new lines of insurance while they run off the financial guaranty book.|$|E
5000|$|Cox also {{targeted}} municipal securities fraud. In April 2008 the SEC charged five former San Diego {{city officials}} with securities fraud involving billions in undisclosed pension liabilities that had placed {{the city and}} taxpayers in serious financial jeopardy. [...] Throughout his chairmanship he railed against the inadequacy of disclosure to investors in municipal securities, which the SEC does not regulate, and asked Congress for explicit authority for the agency to do so. In December 2008, the SEC under his leadership authorized {{the creation of a}} free, Internet-accessible repository for municipal finance disclosure. [...] "With liquidity problems of municipal auction rate securities and rating downgrades of municipal <b>bond</b> <b>insurers</b> contributing to the current credit crisis, the disclosure and transparency of the municipal markets have never been more critical," [...] he said.|$|R
5000|$|The downgrades further {{threaten}} the <b>bond</b> <b>insurers</b> because they become unable to underwrite new business going forward. The downgrades may also require financial institutions holding the bonds {{to lower their}} value or to sell them, as some entities (such as pension funds) are only allowed to hold the highest-grade bonds. The effect of such a devaluation on institutional investors and corporations holding the bonds (including major banks) has been estimated as high as $200 billion. Regulators are taking action to encourage banks to lend the required capital to certain monoline insurers, to avoid such an impact. [...] However, rather than recapitalizing insurance units plagued by exposure to subprime related products, some insurers are focused on moving excess capital to previously dormant units that could continue to underwrite new business.|$|R
5000|$|On December 22 Rosen {{rejected}} a $230 million settlement negotiated {{between the city}} and Bank of America Merrill Lynch and UBS. The city owed the banks $290 million due to the investment by former mayor Kwame Kilpatrick. The city and banks would settle for on the 24th for $185 million in the Rosen negotiated deal. But Rhodes would stun those following the proceedings, in what would {{be known as the}} Christmas Eve Massacre, when three weeks later he would reject the settlement as being [...] "just too high a price to pay". After Orr threatened to sue the two banks, they would end up settling for $85 million. By January 2014 the city would reach a deal with some of its toughest opponents in three <b>bond</b> <b>insurers</b> to whom they owed $388 million on the city's general obligation bonds by agreeing to pay 74%.|$|R
