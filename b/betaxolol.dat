50|$|<b>Betaxolol</b> (trade names Betoptic, Betoptic S, Lokren, Kerlone) is a {{selective}} beta1 receptor blocker {{used in the}} treatment of hypertension and glaucoma. Being selective for beta1 receptors, it typically has fewer systemic side effects than non-selective beta-blockers, for example, not causing bronchospasm (mediated by beta2 receptors) as timolol may. <b>Betaxolol</b> also shows greater affininty for beta1 receptors than metoprolol. In addition to its effect on the heart, <b>betaxolol</b> reduces the pressure within the eye (intraocular pressure). This effect is thought to be caused by reducing the production of the liquid (which is called the aqueous humor) within the eye. The precise mechanism of this effect is not known. The reduction in intraocular pressure reduces the risk of damage to the optic nerve and loss of vision in patients with elevated intraocular pressure due to glaucoma.|$|E
50|$|Bisoprolol has {{a higher}} degree of β1-selectivity {{compared}} to other β1-selective β-blockers such as atenolol, metoprolol, and <b>betaxolol.</b> However nebivolol is approximately 3.5 times more β1-selective.|$|E
50|$|<b>Betaxolol</b> was {{approved}} by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for ocular use as a 0.5% solution (Betoptic) in 1985 and as a 0.25% solution (Betoptic S) in 1989.|$|E
50|$|Beta blockers, {{the second}} most common {{treatment}} method for glaucoma, reduce the production of aqueous humor. They are relatively inexpensive and are available in generic form. Timolol, Levobunolol, and <b>Betaxolol</b> are common beta blockers prescribed to treat glaucoma.|$|E
50|$|The {{second example}} {{involves}} eye-specific delivery of betaxoxime, the oxime derivative of <b>betaxolol.</b> The administered, inactive β-amino-ketoxime {{is converted to}} the corresponding ketone via oxime hydrolase, an enzyme recently identified with preferential activity in the eye, and then stereospecifically reduced to its alcohol form. IOP-lowering activity is demonstrated without producing the active β-blockers systemically, making them void of any cardiovascular activity, a major drawback of classical antiglaucoma agents. Because of the advantages provided by this unique eye-targeting profile, oxime-based eye-targeting CDSs could replace the β-blockers currently used for ophthalmic applications.|$|E
40|$|<b>Betaxolol,</b> a β 1 -adrenoceptor {{antagonist}} {{used for}} the treatment of glaucoma, is known to be neuroprotective in paradigms of ischaemia/excitotoxicity. In this study, we examined whether <b>betaxolol</b> and other β-adrenoceptor antagonists interact directly with neurotoxin binding to sites 1 and 2 of the voltage-sensitive sodium channel (Na+ channel) in rat cerebrocortical synaptosomes. <b>Betaxolol</b> inhibited specific [3 H]-batrachotoxinin-A 20 -α-benzoate ([3 H]-BTX-B) binding to neurotoxin site 2 in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC 50 value of 9. 8 [*]μM. Comparison of all the β-adrenoceptor antagonists tested revealed a potency order of propranolol>betaxolol≈levobetaxolol>levobunolol≈carteolol⩾timolol>atenolol. None of the drugs caused a significant inhibition of [3 H]-saxitoxin binding to neurotoxin receptor site 1, even at concentrations as high as 250 [*]μM. Saturation experiments showed that <b>betaxolol</b> increased the KD of [3 H]-BTX-B binding but had no effect on the Bmax. The association kinetics of [3 H]-BTX-B were unaffected by <b>betaxolol,</b> but the drug significantly accelerated the dissociation rate of the radioligand. These findings argue for a competitive, indirect, allosteric mode of inhibition of [3 H]-BTX-B binding by <b>betaxolol.</b> <b>Betaxolol</b> inhibited veratridine-stimulated Na+ influx in rat cortical synaptosomes with an IC 50 value of 28. 3 [*]μM. Carteolol, levobunolol, timolol and atenolol were significantly less effective than <b>betaxolol</b> at reducing veratridine-evoked Na+ influx. The ability of <b>betaxolol</b> to interact with neurotoxin site 2 of the Na+ channel and inhibit Na+ influx may have a role in its neuroprotective action in paradigms of excitotoxicity/ischaemia and in its therapeutic effect in glaucoma...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare in the {{individual}} hypertensive patient the blood pressure lowering effect of a beta-blocking agent i. e. <b>betaxolol</b> with that of a calcium entry blocker, i. e. verapamil. The antihypertensive efficacy of the drugs was evaluated both at the physician's office and by monitoring ambulatory daytime blood pressure using a portable blood pressure recorder (Remler M 2000). Seventeen patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension (aged 35 - 67 years) were treated for two consecutive 6 -week periods with either <b>betaxolol,</b> 20 mg/day or a slow-release formulation of verapamil, 240 - 480 mg/day.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} the ocular hypotensive efficacy {{and safety of}} a fixed combination of <b>betaxolol</b> (0. 25 %) and pilocarpine (1. 75 %). METHODS: Three multicenter, double-masked, parallel trials were completed in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension of 3 months' treatment duration. Studies 1 and 2 were three-arm comparisons of <b>betaxolol,</b> pilocarpine, and a fixed combination, each used 3 times daily. Study 3 was a two-arm study of the fixed combination with and without a surfactant, used twice daily. In all studies, there was a 1 -month runin period with <b>betaxolol</b> 0. 25 % suspension given twice daily. There were 182 patients in Study 1, 186 patients in Study 2, and 166 patients in Study 3. RESULTS: In all 3 studies, approximately 10 % to 15 % of patients treated with pilocarpine or the combination therapy were terminated from further participation because of typical pilocarpine side effects (eg, blurred vision, headache). In studies 1 and 2, there was a mean reduction in intraocular pressure from a <b>betaxolol</b> baseline of approximately 3 to 4 mmHg. Patients continuing on <b>betaxolol</b> alone or randomly assigned to pilocarpine alone experienced a mean reduction of 1 to 2 mm Hg. Overall, the combination was approximately 2 mmHg more effective than either <b>betaxolol</b> or pilocarpine alone. In Study 3, the two <b>betaxolol</b> combinations had equivalent efficacy. CONCLUSION: In patients requiring more than one ocular hypotensive agent, the combination of <b>betaxolol</b> and pilocarpine in a single formulation {{appears to be an}} effective and relatively safe agent. The use of this combination agent promises the potential for enhanced patient convenience...|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{demonstrate}} the cytotoxic effect of <b>betaxolol</b> and its underlying mechanism on human corneal endothelial cells(HCE cells) in vitro and cat corneal endothelial cells(CCE cells) in vivo, providing experimental basis for safety anti-glaucoma drug usage in clinic of ophthalmology. METHODS: In vivo and in vitro experiments {{were conducted to}} explore whether and how <b>betaxolol</b> participates in corneal endothelial cell injury. The in vitro morphology, growth status, plasma membrane permeability, DNA fragmentation, and ultrastructure of HCE cells treated with 0. 021875 - 0. 28 g/L <b>betaxolol</b> were examined by light microscope, 3 -(4, 5) -dimethylthiahiazo (-z-y 1) - 3, 5 -di-phenytetrazoliumromide (MTT) assay, acridine orange (AO) /ethidium bromide (EB) double-fluorescent staining, DNA agarose gel electrophoresis, and transmission electron microscope (TEM). The in vivo density, morphology, and ultrastructure of CCE cells, corneal thickness, and eye pressure of cat eyes treated with 0. 28 g/L <b>betaxolol</b> were investigated by specular microscopy, applanation tonometer, alizarin red staining, scanning electron microscope (SEM), and TEM. RESULTS: Exposure to <b>betaxolol</b> at doses from 0. 0875 g/L to 2. 8 g/L induced morphological and ultrastructural changes of in vitro cultured HCE cells such as cytoplasmic vacuolation, cellular shrinkage, structural disorganization, chromatin condensation, and apoptotic body appearance. Simultaneously, <b>betaxolol</b> elevated plasma membrane permeability and induced DNA fragmentation of these cells in a dose-dependent manner in AO/EB staining. Furthermore, <b>betaxolol</b> at a dose of 2. 8 g/L also induced decrease of density of CCE cells in vivo, and non-hexagonal and shrunk apoptotic cells were also found in betaxolol-treated cat corneal endothelia.

We also demonstrate attenuation of an amygdalar beta(1) -adrenergic receptor-mediated cell-signaling pathway following this treatment. Male rats were administered <b>betaxolol</b> at 24 and 44 h following chronic cocaine administration.

Methods: One hundred and twelve beta-blockers-naive outpatients with stable angina pectoris were randomized to receive <b>betaxolol,</b> 20 mg once daily or metoprolol tartrate, 50 mg twice daily for 8 weeks. The principal outcome measure was overall compliance measured electronically, whereas secondary outcome measures were drug effectiveness and health-related quality of life. Results: The overall compliance was 86. 5 ± 21. 3 % in the <b>betaxolol</b> group versus 76. 1 ± 26. 3 % in the metoprolol group (p < 0. 01), and the correct number of doses was taken on 84. 4 ± 21. 6 % and 64. 0 ± 31. 7 % of treatment days, respectively (p < 0. 0001). The percentage of missed doses was 14. 5 ± 21. 5 % in the once-daily group and 24. 8 ± 26. 4 % in the twice-daily group (p < 0. 01). The percentage of doses taken in the correct time window (58. 6 % vs 42. 0 %, p = 0. 01), correct interdose intervals (77. 4 % v 53. 1 %, p < 0. 0001), and therapeutic coverage (85. 6 % vs 73. 7 %, p < 0. 001) were significantly higher in the once-daily group.

40|$|AIM—To {{determine}} {{the long term}} efficacy of monotherapy with topically applied β blocking agents and to determine whether selective β blockers were able to preserve the visual field more effectively than non-selective agents.  METHOD—A prospective randomised, open, comparative study of three topically applied β blockers—timolol, <b>betaxolol,</b> and carteolol—was carried out on 153  patients (280  eyes) with newly diagnosed open angle glaucoma. Those patients who were not withdrawn were followed by the same observers {{for a minimum of}} 2  years and a maximum of 7  years, with clinical observations, Goldmann tonometry and 24. 2  Humphrey visual field analysis.  RESULTS—All three drugs lowered the IOP significantly from untreated levels but <b>betaxolol</b> took up to 12  months in some instances to reach the maximum pressure reduction. After 7  years only 43 % of the eyes begun on timolol, 34 % of those started on carteolol, and 29 % of those on <b>betaxolol</b> were still being treated with these medications alone. Visual fields were analysed throughout the trial by CPSD and MD and at the end by linear regression analysis (PROGRESSOR). The visual fields remained the same without apparent improvement or deterioration throughout the period of follow up. Eight patients (11  eyes) were withdrawn because of continuing field loss in spite of reduction in IOP (six using carteolol and five using <b>betaxolol).</b>  CONCLUSIONS—Analysis shows that less than half the eyes initially treated with topical β blockers might be expected to still be being treated with their original medication after 5  years.

40|$|Anxiety {{has been}} {{indicated}} {{as a key}} symptom of the cocaine withdrawal syndrome and {{is considered to be}} one of the most important factors in cultivating the repetitive cycle of chronic cocaine abuse. Cocaine use and withdrawal from cocaine causes alterations in norepinephrine transmission and an associated vulnerability to anxiety. As alterations in noradrenergic transmission in limbic areas underlie withdrawal for many drugs of abuse, the initial goal of the present study sought to determine the effect of cocaine withdrawal on adrenergic receptor expression in the amygdala. ^ Male Sprague Dawley rats were administered intraperitoneal (i. p.) injections of cocaine (20 mg/kg) once daily for 14 days and underwent either a no, short-term (2 days) or intermediate-term (12 days) withdrawal period. Amygdala brain regions were micro-dissected from all of these animals and processed for Western blot analysis. Results from these experiments showed that â 1 –adrenergic receptor expression is significantly increased in amygdala extracts of animals following short-term withdrawal compared to controls. This finding motivated further experiments toward determining whether treatment with <b>betaxolol,</b> a selective β 1 –adrenergic receptor antagonist, could ameliorate cocaine withdrawal-induced anxiety. Therefore, in additional studies, at 24 and then 44 hours following chronic cocaine administration, animals were administered <b>betaxolol</b> (5 mg/kg, i. p.) and anxiety-like behavior in the animals was evaluated on the elevated plus maze test approximately 2 hours following the last <b>betaxolol</b> injection. Animals treated with <b>betaxolol</b> while undergoing withdrawal from chronic cocaine displayed a significant attenuation of anxiety-like behavior characterized by increased open arm exploration compared to control animals. ^ Corticotropin releasing factor (CRF), a peptide neurotransmitter, has also been implicated in mediating the ‘anxiety-like’ behavior that is observed during the initial phase of cocaine abstinence and an increase in amygdalar CRF gene expression has been found to specifically occur during short-term cocaine withdrawal. Using quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, our studies confirmed these findings. Additionally, our anatomical data indicates direct inputs of noradrenergic afferents to CRF neurons in the amygdala and the presence of β 1 -adrenergic receptors on these neurons. ^ Modulation of adrenergic receptors eventually culminates in alterations in downstream signal transduction elements and using Western blot analysis, we also found alterations in a β 1 -adrenergic receptor-mediated cell signaling pathway during early cocaine withdrawal. <b>Betaxolol</b> treatment during early withdrawal blocked increases in CRF gene expression and reversed alterations in the signaling elements to control levels. Together, data from these studies suggest that the effect of <b>betaxolol</b> on ameliorating cocaine withdrawal-induced anxiety may be related to its effect on blocking amygdalar β 1 -adrenergic receptors that are upregulated during early phases of drug withdrawal and hence, modulating downstream cell signaling elements and ultimately CRF gene expression. ...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE. TO {{determine}} whether chronic topical glaucoma therapy can control intraocular pressure (IOP) and protect nerve fibers in a rat model of pressure-induced optic nerve damage. METHODS. Sixteen adult Brown Norway rats were administered unilateral episcleral vein injections of hypertonic saline to produce scarring of the aqueous humor outflow pathways. Twice daily applications of either artificial tears (n — 6), 0. 5 % <b>betaxolol</b> (n = 5), or 0. 5 % apraclonidine (n = 5) were delivered to both eyes, and awake pressures were monitored with a TonoPen XL tonometer for 17 {{days before the}} rats were killed. RESULTS. For animals administered artificial tears, the mean IOP of the experimental eyes was 39 ± 2 mm Hg compared with 29 ± 1 mm Hg for the control eyes. This difference was statistically significant (P < 0. 001). Mean IOPs in the experimental eyes of animals administered <b>betaxolol</b> and apraclonidine were 29 ± 7 and 29 ± 4 mm Hg, respectively, whereas the mean IOP in the control eyes was 28 ± 1 mm Hg for both groups. There was {{no statistically significant difference}} among these values. The mean IOP for the experimental eyes in the <b>betaxolol</b> and apraclonidine groups was lower than that in animals administered artificial tears (P = 0. 003). Quantitative histologic analysis of optic nerve damage in experimental eyes showed that four of the six animals administere...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} hypothesized, based on {{physiological}} evidence, {{that there is}} a greater proportion of 1 -adrenergic receptors on the myocytes of the conduction system when compared with the working myocardium. The purpose of these studies was to examine f 3 -adrenergic receptor subtype in the conduction system of the dog by using the technique of coverslip autoradiography. Scintillation studies of [' 25 l]pindolol binding to ventricular sections demonstrated that binding was saturable (dissociation constant of 116 pM), had the correct order of potency for a 13 -receptor, and was stereoselective. Both <b>betaxolol</b> (p,-selective) and ICI- 118, 551 (f 2 -selective) competition curves fit a two-site model in nonlinear curve-fitting analyses (78 % B 13 -receptors). Autoradiographic studies determined that the myocytes of the sinoatrial node had approximately twice as many autoradiographic grains as the surrounding atrial myocytes. The myocytes of the atrioventricular bundle had a number of grains similar to the number in surrounding septal myocytes. Autoradiographic inhibition curves with <b>betaxolol</b> or ICI- 118, 551 demon-strated that both the sinoatrial node and the atrioventricular bundle had inhibition profiles similar to the surrounding myocytes (predominantly B 13) but unlike the inhibition profiles of arterioles (predominantly j%). Calculations using the dissociation constants derived from the nonlinear curve-fitting analysis and the percent specific binding in the presence of 4 10 - 7 M <b>betaxolol</b> or ICI- 118, 551 determined that th...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Pharmacological {{intervention}} with peripheral sympathetic transmission at ciliary smooth muscle neuro-receptor junctions {{has been used}} {{against a background of}} controlled parasympathetic activity to investigate the characteristics of autonomic control of ocular accommodation. Methods: A continuously recording infrared optometer was used to measure accommodation on a group of five visually normal emmetropic subjects under open- and closed-loop conditions. A double-blind protocol between saline, timolol and <b>betaxolol</b> was used to differentiate between the localised action on ciliary smooth muscle and effects induced by changes in stimulus conditions. Data were collected before and 45 min following the instillation of saline, timolol or <b>betaxolol.</b> Open-loop post-task decay was investigated following 3 min sustained near fixation of a stimulus placed 3 D above the subject's pre-task tonic accommodation level. Closed-loop dynamic responses were recorded for each treatment condition while subjects viewed sinusoidally (0. 05 - 0. 6 Hz) or stepwise vergence-modulated targets over a 2 D range (2 - 4 D). Results: Open-loop data demonstrate a rapid post-task regression to pre-task tonic accommodation levels for saline and <b>betaxolol</b> control conditions. A slow positive post-task shift was induced by timolol indicating that sympathetic inhibition contributes to accommodative adaptation during sustained near vision. Closed-loop accommodation responses to temporally modulated sinusoidal stimuli showed characteristic features for both saline and <b>betaxolol</b> control conditions. Timolol induced a reduced gain for low- and mid-temporal frequencies (< 0. 3 Hz) but did not affect the response at higher temporal frequencies. Response times to stepwise stimuli increased following the instillation of timolol for the near-to-far fixation condition compared with the controls and was related to the period of sustained prior fixation. Conclusions: Modulation of accommodation under open- and closed-loop conditions by a non-selective β-blocker is consistent with the temporal and inhibitory features of sympathetic innervation to ciliary smooth muscle. Although parasympathetic innervation predominates there is evidence to support a role for sympathetic innervation in the control of ocular accommodation. © 2002 The College of Optometrists...|$|E

40|$|AIM—To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} β blockers used in ophthalmology on the release of histamine from mixed cell preparations containing human leucocytes and basophils.  METHODS—A mixed leucocyte and basophil preparation was obtained from venous blood of healthy non-atopic volunteers. Cell preparations were then incubated with <b>betaxolol,</b> metipranolol, timolol, or carteolol. After incubation for 1  hour the histamine content of the supernatant was analysed by automated fluorometric analysis. Cell viability was tested by measuring lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) concentrations.  RESULTS—Betaxolol and metipranolol in concentrations between 10 - 2  M and 10 - 3  M liberated histamine from human blood cells in a dose dependent manner. Carteolol and timolol {{had no effect on}} histamine at these concentrations. At the same concentrations LDH was also detected in the supernatants of cell suspensions incubated with metipranolol or <b>betaxolol.</b>  CONCLUSIONS—Betaxolol and metipranolol induce substantial histamine release from human leucocytes, probably {{as a result of their}} cytotoxic effect. ...|$|E
