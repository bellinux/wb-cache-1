Initially, press reports indicated that the storm wrought up to $500million in damage; however, final damage estimates were about $50million.|$|E

500|$|Based on {{operational}} {{estimates of}} a wind speed increase of 50mph (85km/h), the National Hurricane Center reported that [...] "no tropical cyclone {{in the historic}} record has ever reached this intensity {{at a faster rate}} near landfall." [...] The path of the eye continued northeastward and passed over Port Arthur, Nederland, Port Neches, Groves, and <b>Bridge</b> <b>City,</b> Texas at Category1 hurricane strength. This was the second time within two years (following Hurricane Rita on September 24, 2005) that these cities experienced a direct hit from a hurricane. By eight hours after landfall, Humberto weakened to a tropical storm as it crossed into southwestern Louisiana. Increased upper-level wind shear caused the storm to weaken rapidly over land, and late on September 13 Humberto weakened to a tropical depression. Upon issuing its last advisory, the National Hurricane Center remarked on the potential for the remnants of the storm to turn southward into the Gulf of Mexico. However, the storm continued northeastward through the southeastern United States, and on September 14, the storm began dissipating over northwestern Georgia, and shortly thereafter degenerated into a remnant low pressure area.|$|E
500|$|As {{the storm}} was approaching, the National Weather Service issued flash flood watches from Freeport to Sabine Pass, Texas. Rainfall from the storm peaked at [...] {{in the town of}} Nederland. A 24-hour {{precipitation}} record of [...] was reported at the Southeast Texas Regional Airport in Beaumont. Due to heavy rainfall, an automobile accident in Beaumont resulted in one fatality. A police officer in Beaumont noted that almost every street in the city was flooded. [...] The heavy rainfall resulted in considerable flash flooding in eastern Texas, causing residents to evacuate their homes. Flood waters also forced the shutdown of Interstate 10. According to a police spokesman, at least 60% of streets in Port Arthur were inundated by water. In Orange County, two people were injured in automobile accidents. Along Highway 124, a bayou overflowed its bank. Because there were numerous inundated streets, police barricaded roads in Beaumont, <b>Bridge</b> <b>City,</b> Orange, Vidor, and Port Arthur. A sewer system in Roscoe was also damaged by flood waters, leaving 1,500residents without running water. In Port Arthur, twelve homes were reported flooded; one house in the Lakeview neighborhood had [...] of water inside. Flood waters entered an oil pit at Port Neches, which sent at least 200barrels of oil into the Neches River.|$|E
500|$|Initially, True Detective {{first season}} {{was due to}} shoot in Arkansas, but Pizzolatto later chose to film in Louisiana to take {{advantage}} of state tax incentives and the area's distinctive landscape: [...] "There's a contradictory nature to the place and a sort of sinister quality underneath it all...everything lives under layers of concealment. The woods are thick and dark and impenetrable. On the other hand you have the beauty of it all from a distance." [...] Principal photography took three months (between 100 and 110 days), from January to June 2013. Approximately five minutes of film were shot per day. Production staff constructed various set pieces, among them a scorched chapel, Joel Theriot's tent revival, and the Louisiana State Criminal Investigations Division offices, the last of which they built inside an abandoned light bulb warehouse near Elmwood. For the Dora Lange crime scene, the crew filmed exterior shots at a remote sugarcane field outside Erath which, because it was partially burned, inspired what DiGerlando called a [...] "moody and atmospheric" [...] backdrop for the corresponding interior scenes. The scene in which Cohle, taking Ginger hostage, escapes a housing complex amidst gunfire, was captured in <b>Bridge</b> <b>City</b> as a single six-minute tracking shot, a technique Fukunaga had employed in Sin Nombre (2009) and Jane Eyre (2011). Shot in seven takes, preparation for the scene was extensive and demanding: McConaughey trained with Mark Norby to master a fighting style for his character, {{and the nature of the}} shoot required a team of stunt coordinators, make-up artists, and special effects crew on hand during its entire course. Elsewhere, shooting took place at the old Kenner High School campus and nineteenth-century Fort Macomb, located outside New Orleans.|$|E
