5|$|The {{modern era}} in {{steelmaking}} {{began with the}} introduction of Henry Bessemer's Bessemer process in 1855, the raw material for which was pig iron. His method let him produce steel in large quantities cheaply, thus mild steel came to be used for most purposes for which wrought iron was formerly used. The Gilchrist-Thomas process (or basic Bessemer process) was an improvement to the Bessemer process, made by lining the converter with a <b>basic</b> <b>material</b> to remove phosphorus.|$|E

By etching {{the surface of the}} anode, depending on the required rated voltage, the surface area can be increased by a factor of approximately 200 with respect to a smooth surface.|$|E

25|$|The Soviets, who {{encouraged}} and partly {{carried out the}} expulsions, offered little cooperation with humanitarian efforts, thereby requiring the Americans and Britons to absorb the expellees in their zones of occupation. In contradiction with the Potsdam Agreements, the Soviets neglected their obligation to provide supplies for the expellees. In Potsdam, {{it was agreed that}} 15% of all equipment dismantled in the Western zones—especially from the metallurgical, chemical and machine manufacturing industries—would be transferred to the Soviets in return for food, coal, potash (a <b>basic</b> <b>material</b> for fertiliser), timber, clay products, petroleum products, etc. The Western deliveries started in 1946, but {{this turned out to be}} a one-way street. The Soviet deliveries—desperately needed to provide the expellees with food, warmth, and basic necessities and to increase agricultural production in the remaining cultivation area—did not materialize. Consequently, the US stopped all deliveries on 3 May 1946, while the expellees from the areas under Soviet rule were deported to the West until the end of 1947.|$|E
25|$|Alderfer, {{expanding}} on Maslow's {{hierarchy of}} needs, created the ERG theory. This theory posits {{that there are}} three groups of core needs — existence, relatedness, and growth, hence the label: ERG theory. The existence group is concerned with providing our <b>basic</b> <b>material</b> existence requirements. They include the items that Maslow considered to be physiological and safety needs. The second group of needs are those of relatedness- the desire we have for maintaining important personal relationships. These social and status desires require interaction with others {{if they are to be}} satisfied, and they align with Maslow's social need and the external component of Maslow's esteem classification. Finally, Alderfer isolates growth needs as an intrinsic desire for personal development. Maslow's categories are broken down into many different parts and there are a lot of needs. The ERG categories are more broad and covers more than just certain areas. As a person grows, the existence, relatedness, and growth for all desires continue to grow. All these needs should be fulfilled to greater wholeness as a human being. These include the intrinsic component from Maslow's esteem category and the characteristics included under self-actualization.|$|E

It is narrated {{by a woman}} in the prison cell where she has been sent for the murder of her husband. To express the woman's feelings, Kay deliberately chose a voice that was unpoetic: [...] "I wanted the voice to be so everyday, it would be banal." [...] Turnage's music too includes similarly <b>basic</b> <b>material,</b> what critic Tom Service describes as [...] "simple hummable tunes", but these are transformed and distorted, a metaphor for how initial loving intimacy is destroyed and distorted by years of violence and abuse. Turnage's musical language is modernist but influenced by jazz, an area of musical interest he shared with Kay.|$|E

500|$|Striggio's main {{sources for}} his {{libretto}} were Books 10 and 11 of Ovid's Metamorphoses and Book Four of Virgil's Georgics. These {{provided him with}} the <b>basic</b> <b>material,</b> but not the structure for a staged drama; the events of acts 1 and 2 of the libretto are covered by a mere 13 lines in the Metamorphoses. For help in creating a dramatic form, Striggio drew on other sources—Poliziano's 1480 play, Guarini's Il pastor fido, and Ottavio Rinuccini's libretto for Peri's Euridice. Musicologist Gary Tomlinson remarks on the many similarities between Striggio's and Rinuccini's texts, noting {{that some of the}} speeches in L'Orfeo [...] "correspond closely in content and even in locution to their counterparts in L'Euridice". The critic Barbara Russano Hanning writes that Striggio's verses are less subtle than those of Rinuccini, although the structure of Striggio's libretto is more interesting. Rinuccini, whose work had been written for the festivities accompanying a Medici wedding, was obliged to alter the myth to provide a [...] "happy ending" [...] suitable for the occasion. By contrast, because Striggio was not writing for a formal court celebration he could be more faithful to the spirit of the myth's conclusion, in which Orfeo is killed and dismembered by deranged maenads or [...] "Bacchantes". He chose, in fact, to write a somewhat muted version of this bloody finale, in which the Bacchantes threaten Orfeo's destruction but his actual fate is left in doubt.|$|E

[...] Ross Geoghegan in his 1986 review (...) of two papers by M.A. Armstrong on the fundamental groups of orbit spaces wrote: [...] "These two papers show which parts of elementary covering space theory carry over from the free to the nonfree case.

2500|$|Materialism {{is often}} {{associated}} with reductionism, according to which the objects or phenomena individuated at one level of description, if they are genuine, must be explicable in terms of the objects or phenomena at some other level of description—typically, at a more reduced level. Non-reductive materialism explicitly rejects this notion, however, taking the material constitution of all particulars to be consistent with the existence of real objects, properties, or phenomena not explicable in the terms canonically used for the <b>basic</b> <b>material</b> constituents. Jerry Fodor influentially argues this view, according to which empirical laws and explanations in [...] "special sciences" [...] like psychology or geology are invisible from the perspective of basic physics. A lot of vigorous literature has grown up around the relation between these views.|$|E

This was a taster for Cardiacs’ most epic recorded effort to date. Sing to God was a double album, due to the sheer amount of material that Tim had written over a number of years. The album was notable for a change in Cardiacs' working methods – whereas most previous material had been written and arranged by Smith, the Sing to God sessions saw extensive contributions from Jon Poole who played a strong role in orchestrating Smith's <b>basic</b> <b>material</b> with detailed riffs and keyboard parts (and contributed several songs entirely written by himself).

2500|$|However, Lucretius, {{describing}} atomism in his De rerum natura, gives {{very clear}} and compelling empirical arguments for the original atomist theory. He observes that any material is subject to irreversible decay. Through time, even hard rocks are slowly worn down by drops of water. Things have the tendency to get mixed up: Mix water with soil and mud will result, seldom disintegrating by itself. Wood decays. However, there are mechanisms in nature and technology to recreate [...] "pure" [...] materials like water, air, and metals. The seed of an oak will grow out into an oak tree, made of similar wood as historical oak trees, the wood of which has already decayed. The conclusion is that many properties of materials must derive from something inside, that will itself never decay, something that stores for eternity the same inherent, indivisible properties. The basic question is: Why has {{everything in the world}} not yet decayed, and how can exactly some of the same materials, plants, and animals be recreated again and again? One obvious solution to explain how indivisible properties can be conveyed in a way not easily visible to human senses, is to hypothesize the existence of [...] "atoms". These classical [...] "atoms" [...] are nearer to humans' modern concept of [...] "molecule" [...] than to the atoms of modern science. The other central point of classical atomism is that there must be considerable open space between these [...] "atoms": the void. Lucretius gives reasonable arguments that the void is absolutely necessary to explain how gasses and liquids can flow and change shape, while metals can be molded without their <b>basic</b> <b>material</b> properties changing.|$|E
