30|$|Tannase (tannin acyl {{hydrolase}} E.C 3.1. 1.20) is an inducible, largely extracellular {{enzyme that}} causes the hydrolysis of ester and depside bonds present in various substrates. Large scale industrial application of this enzyme is very limited owing to its high production costs. In the present study, cost effective production of tannase by Klebsiella pneumoniae KP 715242 was studied under submerged fermentation using different tannin rich agro-residues like Indian gooseberry leaves (Phyllanthus emblica), Black plum leaves (Syzygium cumini), Eucalyptus leaves (Eucalyptus glogus) and <b>Babul</b> leaves (<b>Acacia</b> nilotica). Among all agro-residues, Indian gooseberry leaves {{were found to be}} the best substrate for tannase production under submerged fermentation. Sequential optimization approach using Taguchi orthogonal array screening and response surface methodology was adopted to optimize the fermentation variables in order to enhance the enzyme production. Eleven medium components were screened primarily by Taguchi orthogonal array design to identify the most contributing factors towards the enzyme production. The four most significant contributing variables affecting tannase production were found to be pH (23.62  %), tannin extract (20.70  %), temperature (20.33  %) and incubation time (14.99  %). These factors were further optimized with central composite design using response surface methodology. Maximum tannase production was observed at 5.52 pH, 39.72  °C temperature, 91.82  h of incubation time and 2.17  % tannin content. The enzyme activity was enhanced by 1.26 fold under these optimized conditions. The present study emphasizes the use of agro-residues as a potential substrate with an aim to lower down the input costs for tannase production so that the enzyme could be used proficiently for commercial purposes.|$|R

50|$|Due to huge {{requirement}} of pulpwood for production virgin cellulosic fibre based paper, the {{pulp and paper}} industry has become a major demand driver for certain species of tree such as Eucalyptus, <b>Babul</b> <b>Acacia</b> catechu, Subabul(Leucaena leucocephala) and was the connected Casuarina equisetifolia. As a rough estimate, the total demand for pulpwood is approximately 10 million ADMT (i.e. wood having 10% moisture). Indian Paper Manufacturer's Association http://www.ipma.co.in is an umbrella organisation of Indian Pulp and Paper Industry which coordinates and drives plantation efforts by member organisations in India.It is very important to us but on the evil side, it is causing damage to the forest. A full grown up pulp tree takes at least 40 years and gets cut down in 4 mins.|$|E
50|$|Specifically, {{the forest}} {{vegetation}} types {{identified in the}} sanctuary are: dry deciduous scrub, salvadora scrub, desert thorn forest, <b>babul</b> <b>Acacia</b> nilotica forests, tropical Euphorbia scrub, dry savannah type vegetation, - Salvadora association, gorad (Senegalia senegal), Zizyphus scrub and Capparis association. The predominant plant species identified are the gorad and the babul; gorad, is the main species which covers an extensive area in the eastern zone while babul is the dominant species in the western zone where limestone is the geological formation {{in some of the}} patches. The invasive species Prosopis juliflora is noted to be spreading in the sanctuary resulting in decrease of grassy and herbaceous patches. The invasive vegetation of Prosopis chilensis is reported in an area of 12.39 km2 in the sanctuary.|$|E
50|$|The land under Aravalli Biodiversity Park {{was once}} a site for mining. Martha Shinde (Scindias) had a mining lease for the 2.3 km² area. They plundered out {{whatever}} they could. For years Shinde exploited forest resources including minerals, mica, sand, stone, rocks and water. Land, which once {{was covered with a}} dense forest, soon turned into pits and hillocks. A systematic planting program is carried out and every year native trees and bushes are planted to remove unwanted weeds, i.e. Prosopis juliflora. Scientists from the Centre for Environmental Management of Degraded Ecosystems, University of Delhi have so far got over 10 ecosystems reintroduced with over 40 biotic communities. Portions of Aravalli, which come under Gujarat, are covered with natural dense forest. However, the land on which Aravalli Biodiversity Park is being developed, was devoid of such natural growth of forest due to extensive mining of the area. The Centre for Environment Management & Degraded Ecosystem (Delhi University) works closely with Delhi Development Authority and has plans to revive native flora and fauna of Aravalli hill ranges. The planting of native species like dhau (Anogeissus pendula), <b>babul</b> (<b>Acacia</b> nilotica), kair (Capparis decidua), and dhak (Butea monosperma) has been carried out. A rangeland with native grasses has been developed. A conservatory of butterflies, orchidarium and fernery has been developed.|$|E
30|$|A {{number of}} {{different}} agro-residues like leaves of Indian gooseberry (Phyllanthus emblica), Black plum (Syzygium cumini), Eucalyptus (Eucalyptus glogus) and <b>Babul</b> (<b>Acacia</b> nilotica) were collected from the local farms of Ambala Cantt, India. All the samples were collected aseptically in sample bags. These leaves were first dried at 60  °C in an oven and then finely pulverized to powdered form in a grinder mixer. The powder was stored in a dry place in sterilized bottles at room temperature and used as source of crude tannins in submerged fermentation.|$|E
40|$|Tannase {{have been}} {{produced}} using Aspergillus oryzae NCIM 1032. Enzyme production was carried out under Solid State Fermentation using different tannin rich substrates like some tree barks i. e. Arjuna (Terminalia arjuna), <b>Babul</b> (<b>Acacia</b> nilotica), Jamun (Syzygium cumini), Mulberry, Chiku stem barks have been used. The mixture of Jamun and Babul bark in the ratio of 4 : 6 {{was found to be}} best substrates for the enzyme production under SSF. Metabolic heat generated due to fermentation was equally distributed throughout the substrate bed by agitation in rotating drum bioreactor and enzyme production increased at speed of 75 rpm and at intermittent agitation (2 min/day). The yield was increased by 16 % with all these optimized parameters; it is about 116 U/g dry substrate. This is the first report on production of tannase by the combination of Jamun and Babul tree barks under agitated conditions...|$|E
40|$|Active carbon is an {{amorphous}} form of carbon, {{which is}} specially treated {{to produce a}} very large surface area, ranging from 300 to 2000 m 2 /g. This commodity is assuming increasing importance in the control of air pollution, in purifying and controlling the general chemic environment, in certain biomedical applications and {{for the removal of}} organic matter from water and waste water. This study was undertaken to explore certain indigenous cellulosic and mineral based raw materials like inferior woods, a variety of agrowastes, low rank coals and certain cellulosic precursors, as potential raw materials for the preparation of powdered, granular and fibrous activated carbons. Another aim {{of this study was to}} characterize these products, in liquid and gas phase, by Standard Methods, as well as for certain specific industrial requirements. Among indigenous woods, seven inferior woods were explored and <b>Babul</b> (<b>Acacia</b> arabica), was found to be the most suitable, for preparing powdered as well as granular activated carbons. Suitable method of activation and working conditions in respect of particle size, appropriate Activating agent, its impregnation ratio, activation temperature and time were established for preparing powdered and granular products from this particular raw material. It is notable, that during the course of these studies, ' 1 complete new method for standardization of putty, used in granulization, was also established and got patented. As regards agroresidues, a variety of indigenous ones were investigated, but rice husk was found to be the most appropriate one, in view of its abundant availability. A complete new methodology was developed and got patented for the deashing of rice husk. Moreover, detailed studies were carried out for preparing powdered and granular activated carbons from high as well as low ash rice husk by the method of chemical activation and working conditions were established, by designing and performing a series of experiments 1 JLnder different set of variables. Local deposits of low rank coals of Lakhra and Sharigh, in the province of Sindh and Baluchistan respectively, were appropriately being used for the preparation of powdered activated carbon, by the m 0 thod of chemical activation Detailed methodology as well as various working parameters were established, and it was inferred that coaI of Lakhra origin, although lignitic in nature, but found to be comparatively more suitable for this spl 1 cific purpose. Different indigenous cellulosic precursors were also studied in respect of their suitability as possible raw material for the preparation of fibrous / filament activated carbon. It was thereafter established, that a product of desired strength and appropriate adsorptive capacity may be prepared from bleached cotton cloth. Local technology for 'the preparation of granular activate carbon, by the method of physical activation, was develope, 1. In this respect, a pilot scale fluidized bed reactor was indigenously designed, fabricated and installed. Two locally available Taw materials viz. <b>Babul</b> (<b>Acacia</b> arabica) and coconut shells were being explored as possible raw materials, for this purpose. Suitable working conditions were established, as regards particle size of the raw material activation temperature, operating pressure of the fluidizing medium, activation time etc, for preparing a product of desired strength and adsorptive properties inn suitable yield. <b>Babul</b> (<b>Acacia</b> arabica) was not found to be a suitable raw material for physical activation process by fluidization, due to its less inherent strength as compared to coconut shells. All products of powdered, granular and fibre / filament type, were initially characterized in liquid as well as gas phase, by adsorption against adsorbates of certain molecular dimensions. Products of suitable strength and physical and chemical characteristics, in respect of their micro, meso and macroporous surface area, hardness etc, and initially selected from standard evaluation, were then subjected to their detailed characterization. Detailed characterization of these selected products was carried out, in respect of their elemental analysis (C,H,N',O,S), surface area determination by BET method (low temperature nitrogen adsorption),ascertaining of functional groups present on the surface of these products by FTIR spectroscopy and selective neutralization techniques and adsorption of certain trace metals and lower aliphatic & unsaturated organic acids. Physical adsorption of gases and vapours by these active carbons was also determined by calculation of different parameters like characteristic energy, microspore volume, pore width and external surface area, by adsorption of benzene at 293 K, under reduced pressure, using Dubinin Radushkevich (D-R) equation. An outcome of this study, if; the establishment of suitability of different indigenous preCU 1 :'sors like <b>Babul</b> (<b>Acacia</b> arabica), low ash rice husk, Lakhra coal and bleached cotton cloth, as prospective raw materials, for the preparation of powdered, granular and fibrous activated carbons. Moreover, detailed methodology I techniques for the preparation and characterization of these products were also evolved...|$|E
