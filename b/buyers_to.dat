5|$|Traditionally, sales {{took place}} in the {{daffodil}} fields prior to harvesting the bulbs, but today sales are handled by Marketing Boards although still before harvesting. In the Netherlands there are special exhibition gardens for major <b>buyers</b> <b>to</b> view flowers and order bulbs, some larger ones may have more than a thousand narcissus varieties on display. While individuals can visit these gardens they cannot buy bulbs at retail, which are only available at wholesale, usually at a minimum of several hundredweight. The most famous display is at Keukenhof, although only about 100 narcissus varieties are on display there.|$|E
5|$|Voluntary markets, also {{referred}} to as green power markets, are driven by consumer preference.

Benefits may include zero or reduced greenhouse gas emissions, other pollution reductions or other environmental improvements on power stations.|$|E
5|$|According to Quirky, Wink {{products}} were in 300,000 homes by 2015. In April 2015 Wink experienced a security problem that made {{many of its}} hubs go offline or break, forcing the company to issue a recall. The recall caused a several-month inventory backlog and subsequent shortage of the Wink hub. Due to financial difficulties, {{due in part to}} the recall, Quirky began looking for <b>buyers</b> <b>to</b> sell Wink to in 2015. That November, after Quirky went through bankruptcy proceedings, it sold Wink for $15 million to Flextronics (now called Flex), to whom Quirky owed $18.7 million. Flex was Wink's primary supplier of firmware and hardware. Wink continues to operate as an independent subsidiary of Flex. As of 2016, 1.3 million devices are connected to Wink.|$|E

5|$|While {{only a few}} {{artifacts}} were recovered, historians {{said the}} dig offered a clearer view of early 19th-century life at Colross. Discoveries included an underground domed brick cistern {{that served as a}} water purification system and evidence that slaves lived in outbuildings on the Colross estate. Archaeologists also discovered the mansion's original basement floor, which was laid in a herringbone bond. Evidence of the estate's exterior walls, the foundations of the smokehouse, stables, and a burial vault were also unearthed. In the northwestern portion of the property, what is thought to have been the foundation of a rectangular burial vault was found. No burial remains were discovered. All interments were presumably removed in the early 20th century. Thomson Francis Mason was originally interred at the Colross graveyard in 1838, as were two of his daughters. Subsequent residents had their remains reinterred at Christ Church Episcopal Cemetery in Alexandria. According to the Alexandria Economic Development Partnership, the delay in construiction caused 79 condominium <b>buyers</b> <b>to</b> abandon their purchases.|$|E
5|$|Khrushchev {{sought to}} abolish the Machine-Tractor Stations (MTS) which not only owned most large {{agricultural}} machines such as combines and tractors, but also provided services such as plowing, and transfer their equipment and functions to the kolkhozes and sovkhozes (state farms). After a successful test involving MTS which served one large kolkhoz each, Khrushchev ordered a gradual transition—but then ordered that the change take place with great speed. Within three months, {{over half of the}} MTS facilities had been closed, and kolkhozes were being required to buy the equipment, with no discount given for older or dilapidated machines. MTS employees, unwilling to bind themselves to kolkhozes and lose their state employee benefits and the right to change their jobs, fled to the cities, creating a shortage of skilled operators. The costs of the machinery, plus the costs of building storage sheds and fuel tanks for the equipment, impoverished many kolkhozes. Inadequate provisions were made for repair stations. Without the MTS, the market for Soviet agricultural equipment fell apart, as the kolkhozes now had neither the money nor skilled <b>buyers</b> <b>to</b> purchase new equipment.|$|E

40|$|When two sellers {{negotiate}} {{terms of}} trade with a common buyer, {{the order in which}} the negotiations occur can affect the buyer's payoff. This suggests that the buyer may have preferences over which seller to negotiate with first. We find that when the efficient outcome calls for the <b>buyer</b> <b>to</b> purchase from only one seller, the <b>buyer</b> weakly prefers <b>to</b> negotiate first with the inefficient seller, and when the efficient outcome calls for the <b>buyer</b> <b>to</b> purchase from both sellers, the <b>buyer</b> prefers <b>to</b> negotiate first with the seller that has less bargaining power, or offers a smaller stand-alone surplus, all else being equal. These conclusions hold whether or not penalty clauses are feasible. Â© 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
