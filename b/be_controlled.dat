5|$|A brood {{depended}} on a nexus creature to direct it. In the pre-conflict Swarm, this position was filled by cerebrates. However, supplanting the cerebrate with another entity could allow broods, or other {{large groups of}} zerg, to <b>be</b> <b>controlled</b> by non-Swarm agents.|$|E
5|$|Bluebells {{are widely}} planted as garden plants, either among trees or in {{herbaceous}} borders. They flower {{at the same}} time as hyacinths, Narcissus and some tulips. Their ability to reproduce vegetatively, using bulb offsets and seed, means that they can spread rapidly, and may need to <b>be</b> <b>controlled</b> as weeds.|$|E

5|$|Modern Leslie {{speakers}} have an 11-pin interface that {{is safer}} to service, as the mains power is carried separately using a standard IEC mains connector. The Hammond-Suzuki Leslie 2101 also includes line in and line out jacks, so a combo preamp {{is no longer}} required. Its settings can also <b>be</b> <b>controlled</b> via MIDI.|$|E

50|$|Physical human {{traits that}} <b>are</b> <b>controlled</b> {{by a single}} gene are uncommon. Most human {{characteristics}} <b>are</b> <b>controlled</b> by multiple genes (polygenes) although ABCC11 is a peculiar example of a gene with unambiguous phenotypes that <b>is</b> <b>controlled</b> by a SNP. Additionally, it is considered a pleiotropic gene.|$|R

5|$|The Fredericks {{transition}} {{is fundamental to}} the operation of many liquid crystal displays because the director orientation (and thus the properties) can <b>be</b> <b>controlled</b> easily by {{the application of a}} field.|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} widely {{distributed}} across the Americas {{with the exception}} of northern Canada and Alaska.

5|$|The {{timing of}} {{migration}} seems to <b>be</b> <b>controlled</b> primarily {{by changes in}} day length. Migrating birds navigate using celestial cues {{from the sun and}} stars, the earth's magnetic field, and probably also mental maps.|$|E
50|$|Management of {{introduced}} species focuses on {{species that are}} declared noxious and species which have a significant environmental effect. Rabbits <b>are</b> <b>controlled</b> by identification and destruction of warrens. Feral goats are mustered by contractors. Feral pigs <b>are</b> <b>controlled</b> by aerial shooting and foxes <b>are</b> <b>controlled</b> by baiting programs. Where possible, feral animal <b>control</b> <b>is</b> conducted in conjunction with adjoining landholders to maximise effectiveness.|$|R

5|$|Although the story's {{central theme}} is loneliness, it uses shoes and rain as motifs, along with Man'yōshū poetry and the Japanese garden {{in which it}} is set. Although rain is {{typically}} seen as sad and gloomy, in The Garden of Words it makes the world more vivid and protects the two main characters from the reality of their lives and the limitations imposed by society. Shinkai also noted a parallel between love and rain—that neither can <b>be</b> <b>controlled</b> or stopped.|$|E
5|$|Characters can use items {{ranging from}} {{projectiles}} to melee weapons; {{each has a}} different effect on the characters around it. Although many items have returned from previous Super Smash Bros. games, new ones have been introduced as well. Some returning items have changed appearance and function. Two varieties of items, Assist Trophies and Poké Balls, temporarily summon guest characters and Pokémon, respectively, that generally aid the summoner. They cannot <b>be</b> <b>controlled</b> by players and are usually invincible.|$|E
5|$|During normal {{passenger}} {{operation on}} revenue tracks, trains {{are designed to}} <b>be</b> <b>controlled</b> by an integrated Automatic Train Operation (ATO) and Automatic Train Control (ATC) system that accelerates and brakes trains automatically without operator intervention. All trains are still manned with train operators who open and close the doors, make station announcements, and supervise their trains. The system was designed so that an operator could manually operate a train when necessary.|$|E

5|$|Great white {{pelicans}} on Dyer Island, in the Western Cape {{region of}} South Africa, were culled during the 19th century because their predation {{of the eggs}} and chicks of guano-producing seabirds was seen to threaten the livelihood of the guano collectors. More recently, such predation at South African seabird colonies has impacted on the conservation of threatened seabird populations, especially crowned cormorants, Cape cormorants and bank cormorants. This has led to suggestions that pelican numbers should <b>be</b> <b>controlled</b> at vulnerable colonies.|$|E
5|$|In February 2012, President Obama froze {{all assets}} of the Iranian {{government}} in the U.S., which included the Citibank account alleged to <b>be</b> <b>controlled</b> by Bank Markazi. However, there were concerns that existing laws were insufficient for the account {{to be used to}} settle the judgments. Bank Markazi claimed that the account was not an asset of Bank Markazi, but its intermediary, Clearstream, in relation to both TRIA and New York state property law.|$|E
5|$|In {{designing}} the game mechanics, Naka {{was inspired by}} Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto, whose games he had enjoyed playing years earlier. Admiring the simplicity of Miyamoto's mechanics in complex environments, Naka decided that Sonic would <b>be</b> <b>controlled</b> with only a directional pad for movement and a single button for jumping. He also wanted his creation to be more action-oriented than the Mario series; while playing Super Mario Bros., he had wondered why the levels could not be cleared more quickly.|$|E

Manganese <b>is</b> <b>controlled</b> by organic matter diagenesis and carbonate. Copper <b>is</b> <b>controlled</b> by hyperfiltration-osmotic effects in alternating clay-sand units. In addition, barium, manganese, and copper are also enriched by upwelling of hot water and its expansion and flow through permeable layers...|$|R
50|$|In the Republic of Ireland, {{the vast}} {{majority}} of the country's primary schools are owned or managed (or both) by religious organisations. In 2007, and of the national total of 3,279 schools, 3039 (92.7%) <b>were</b> <b>controlled</b> by the Catholic Church, 183 (5.6%) <b>were</b> <b>controlled</b> by the Church of Ireland, 0.7% <b>were</b> <b>controlled</b> by other religious organisations while 1% <b>were</b> <b>controlled</b> by organisations which were not affiliated with any particular religion.

5|$|Myers {{realised}} that normal, globe-shaped hot {{air passenger}} balloons {{were subject to}} the whim of {{the direction of the}} winds. He then thought that perhaps a passenger balloon could <b>be</b> <b>controlled</b> somehow to move against the flow. His first step in an evolution to a controllable balloon was the design of a large elongated spindle instead of a sphere. His theory was that a symmetrical wave line spindle body would have less head resistance when passing through the air than did a blunt globe.|$|E
5|$|Pilot {{control was}} entirely through a single side-mounted control stick. Pitch and roll were {{controlled}} through conventional fore-aft and side-to-side motions, while yaw could <b>be</b> <b>controlled</b> by twisting the stick. No mechanical linkages were used, the stick instead controlled {{the flow of}} high pressure air around the craft, which either directly attached to various control surfaces, or indirectly through local cable linkages to replace controls that were intended to be cable-actuated (like throttle controls on the engines).|$|E
5|$|Several {{different}} {{habitat types}} {{are found in}} Ireland, including farmland, open woodland, temperate broadleaf and mixed forests, conifer plantations, peat bogs {{and a variety of}} coastal habitats. However, agriculture drives current land use patterns in Ireland, limiting natural habitat preserves, particularly for larger wild mammals with greater territorial needs. With no large apex predators in Ireland other than humans and dogs, such populations of animals as semi-wild deer that cannot <b>be</b> <b>controlled</b> by smaller predators, such as the fox, are controlled by annual culling.|$|E
