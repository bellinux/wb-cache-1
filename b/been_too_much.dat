5|$|Also {{during the}} 1970s, Bill Morris was {{studying}} giant lambeosaurine remains from Baja California. He named them ?L. laticaudus in 1981 (type specimen LACM 17715). Morris used {{a question mark}} in his work because no complete crest had been found for his species, and without it a definitive assignment could not be made. From what was known of the skull, he considered it to be most like Lambeosaurus. He interpreted this species as water-bound, due to features like its size, its tall and narrow tail (interpreted as a swimming adaptation), and weak hip articulations, {{as well as a}} healed broken thigh bone that he thought would have <b>been</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> of a handicap for a terrestrial animal to have survived long enough to heal. This species was later (2012) assigned to the new genus Magnapaulia.|$|E
5|$|During {{the pulp}} era, {{explicit}} sexuality {{of any kind}} was rare in genre science fiction and fantasy. For many years, the editors who controlled what was published {{felt that they had}} to protect the adolescent male readership that they identified as their principal market. Although the covers of some 1930s pulp magazines showed scantily clad women menaced by tentacled aliens, the covers were often more lurid than the magazines' contents. In such a context, writers like Edgar Pangborn, who featured passionate male friendships in his work, were exceptional; almost until the end of their careers, including so much as a kiss would have <b>been</b> <b>too</b> <b>much.</b> Implied or disguised sexuality was as important as that which was openly revealed. As such, genre SF reflected the social mores of the day, paralleling common prejudices; This was particularly true of pulp fiction, more so than literary works of the time.|$|E
25|$|On December 4 of {{the same}} year, the designs of the court uniforms for civil {{officials}} were modified, but the designs for junior officials were not updated. Because the officials were responsible for providing their own court uniforms, the cost had <b>been</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> for junior officials. From this point on, junior civil officials wore standard white tie court dress. The difference in price was extreme: when the official Kikuchi Takeo ordered both a three-piece suit and his court uniform at the same shop, the suit cost 28 yen and the uniform 220 yen.|$|E

25|$|The land {{development}} and resettlement policies instituted by the government, however, {{failed to make}} an impact on rural poverty. The government managed to resettle only 40,000 people, despite an estimated 535,000 families engaged in agriculture living below the poverty level. Due to inefficiencies in the program, the beneficiaries of resettlement and development were not always those with the greatest need. It was also alleged by some that there had <b>been</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> emphasis on the difficult process of resettlement and development of new areas, instead of increasing productivity in existing farms. Matters were complicated by the Constitution, which gave the states much control over {{land development}}, and thus requiring the federal government to negotiate with individual state governments. Non-Malay rural families also did not benefit much due to this, as the Constitution reserved portions of land for the Malays, and state governments were not anxious to receive destitute non-Malays.|$|E

Although Mucci had ordered that an airstrip be built in a field next to Plateros so that a plane could evacuate Fisher to get medical attention, it was never dispatched, and he died the next day. His last words were [...] "Good luck on the way out." [...] The other Ranger killed during the raid was Sweezy, who was struck in the back by two rounds from friendly fire.

500|$|As {{the show}} {{is based on the}} uncensored novel {{released}} in 2011, rather than the 1953 film adaptation, it contains references to prostitution and gay sex, as well as the Army's investigation into them, that the film did not feature. The right to create the musical adaptation came with the condition {{that it had to be}} based on the original book. James Jones's daughter Kaylie and son Jamie were in the audience for the show's opening night in London. During its preview period some people walked out of the performance, having been unprepared for the nudity and swearing in the production. Darius Campbell who played First Sergeant Milt Warden, said that the [...] "James Jones novel really portrayed homosexuality and prostitution in the way that it existed in those days and we've dived in head first. Maybe some of the nudity, swearing and explicitness have <b>been</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> for them, but a younger audience and an audience who have loved the film – and wanted to see more – have been giving us standing ovations and for that we are all grateful." [...] Kaylie admitted they had doubts about the idea of the show when it first came up, but added that [...] "I'm thrilled—it's so sophisticated and moving." [...] She also noted that she [...] "was so delighted they put in the gay bar scenes, because my dad said this is just the way it was back then" [...] and that [...] "my father would have been amazed".|$|E
500|$|Unknown was, {{along with}} Weird Tales, an {{important}} early {{influence on the}} fantasy genre. [...] In the foreword to From Unknown Worlds, in 1948, Campbell commented that fantasy before Unknown had <b>been</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> infused with [...] "gloom and terror"; his approach in Unknown had been {{to assume that the}} [...] "creatures of mythology and folklore" [...] could be characters in an amusing tale as easily as they could be made part of a horror story. Horror stories, he said, had a place, but [...] "horror injected with a sharp and poisoned needle is just as effective as when applied with the blunt-instrument technique of the so-called Gothic horror tale". [...] Campbell insisted on the same rational approach to fantasy that he required of his science fiction writers, and in the words of Clareson, this led to the destruction of [...] "not only the prevalent narrative tone but also most of the trappings that had dominated fantasy from The Castle of Otranto and The Monk through the nineteenth century to Weird Tales". [...] Unknown quickly separated itself from Weird Tales, whose fantasies still primarily aimed to produce fear or shock. [...] The closest predecessor to Unknown was Thorne Smith, whose prohibition-era [...] "Topper" [...] stories also mixed fantasy with humor. [...] Before Unknown, fantasy had received little serious attention, though on occasion writers such as James Branch Cabell had achieved respectability. In Ashley's opinion, Unknown created the modern genre of fantasy, though commercial success for the genre had to wait until the 1970s.|$|E
500|$|Crofts was a {{first team}} regular in the 2004–05 season, making 27 Football League appearances, and scoring his first senior goal for the club in a defeat to Brighton & Hove Albion on 26 December. In January 2005, he signed a new {{contract}} designed to keep him at the club until 2009. He was omitted from the team for most of March and April, but was recalled for the last match of the season, in which a draw with Nottingham Forest led to the [...] "Gills" [...] being relegated from the Football League Championship, the second tier of English football, to Football League One, the third tier. In the 2005–06 season, he made the most appearances of any player in the Gillingham squad, missing {{only one of the}} team's 46 matches in League One. Although the team struggled in the league, finishing in {{the lower half of the}} table, they defeated Premier League team Portsmouth in the League Cup, with Crofts scoring the winning goal. The following season, he again made over 40 appearances and also scored eight goals, his best total for an individual season, but Gillingham again finished the season in the bottom half of the table. He made his 100th start for the club on 18 December 2006 in a match against Bournemouth, and marked the occasion with a goal. At the end of the season, he won four awards at the club's Player of the Year event and was dubbed Mr Gillingham by then-manager Ronnie Jepson. He took over as team captain in the 2007–08 season, but it was an unsuccessful season for the team, who were relegated from League One. The following October he was stripped of the captaincy, which was instead given to Barry Fuller. Manager Mark Stimson stated that he felt that the captaincy might have <b>been</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> of a burden for Crofts, and had a negative effect on his form. Soon afterwards, the club made Crofts available for transfer.|$|E

500|$|Fergie's fledglings began November in {{the same}} fashion they ended the {{previous}} month – with a rout. Sheringham, Cole and Solskjær all scored twice each at home to Sheffield Wednesday, in a game that they could have scored so many more. David Pleat managed to get sympathy from Ferguson who admitted [...] "every shot United had in the first half went in" [...] but not from the board, cumulating in his sacking the following Monday. The talk of a one-horse race for the Premiership was put on hold after defeat to Arsenal at Highbury. The psychological impact of United opening up a seven-point lead had they won would have <b>been</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> ground {{to make up for the}} challengers. Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger admitted before the game that defeat would make it [...] "difficult for them" [...] to catch up on United's ground but not [...] "impossible". The Gunners put themselves in front with Nicolas Anelka's first goal for the club and Patrick Vieira's swooping shot which left Schmeichel rattled. Sheringham's admirable brace just before half time left the match finely poised but former United trainee David Platt headed into the far corner with seven minutes left. Thumping Wimbledon courtesy of a Beckham brace and goals from Cole, Scholes and Butt was the perfect response after their second defeat of the season and United bettered it at home to Blackburn Rovers, the only team with an unbeaten away record. A 4–0 win ensured distance between themselves and the challengers, popping the question as to which team was capable of stopping them. The Red Devils managed to score 30 goals in the last nine fixtures prior to this game and qualification to the quarter finals of the Champions League meant that they could prolong their rich domestic goal-scoring form. Ferguson understandably quashed any sort of hype, but admitted that they were in an [...] "ideal position", in comparison to the same point in the last season.|$|E
