2500|$|In {{common law}} systems, a single decided case is binding common law (connotation 1) {{to the same}} extent as statute or regulation, under the {{principle}} of stare decisis. [...] In contrast, in civil law systems, individual decisions have only advisory, not <b>binding</b> <b>effect.</b> [...] In civil law systems, case law only acquires weight when a long series of cases use consistent reasoning, called jurisprudence constante. [...] Civil law lawyers consult case law to obtain their best prediction of how a court will rule, but comparatively, civil law judges are less bound to follow it.|$|E
2500|$|Cyclic {{nucleotides}} can {{be found}} in many different types of eukaryotic cells, including photo-receptor rods and cones, smooth muscle cells and liver cells. [...] Cellular concentrations of cyclic nucleotides can be very low, in the 10−7M range, because metabolism and function are often localized in particular parts of the cell. [...] A highly conserved cyclic nucleotide-binding domain (CNB) is present in all proteins that bind cNMPs, regardless of their biological function. [...] The domain consists of a beta sandwich architecture, with the cyclic nucleotide binding pocket between the beta sheets. [...] The binding of cNMP causes a conformational change that affects the protein's activity. [...] There is also data to support a synergistic <b>binding</b> <b>effect</b> amongst multiple cyclic nucleotides, with cCMP lowering the effective concentration (EC50) of cAMP for activation of protein kinase A (PKA).|$|E

40|$|Four {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} investigate {{the relationship between the}} binding of visual features (as measured by their aftereffects on subsequent binding) and the learning of feature– conjunction probabilities. Both <b>binding</b> and learning <b>effects</b> were obtained, but they did not interact. Interestingly, (shape–color) <b>binding</b> <b>effects</b> disappeared with increasing practice, presumably {{because of the fact that}} only 1 of the features involved was relevant to the task. However, this instability was only observed for arbitrary, not highly overlearned combinations of simple geometric features and not for real objects (colored pictures of a banana and strawberry), where <b>binding</b> <b>effects</b> were strong and resistant to practice. These findings suggest that learning has no direct impact on the strength or resistance of bindings or on speed with which features are bound; however, learning does affect the amount of attention particular feature dimensions attract, which again can influence which features are considered in binding...|$|R

40|$|A {{detailed}} study {{of the effect of}} the η-nucleus final state interaction (FSI) in the p d → ^ 3 He η reaction close to threshold is presented. The FSI is incorporated through a T-matrix for η ^ 3 He elastic scattering, constructed using few body equations. This T-matrix accounts for off-shell and <b>binding</b> <b>effects</b> in η-nucleus scattering. The energy dependence of the data on the p d → ^ 3 He η reaction near threshold is reproduced only after including the FSI. The off-shell and <b>binding</b> <b>effects</b> in η ^ 3 He scattering are found to be important. Given the uncertainty in the knowledge of the elementary η-nucleon interaction, the sensitivity of the p d → ^ 3 He η cross section to different prescriptions of the elementary t-matrix, t_η N →η N is also discussed.

40|$|The author {{demonstrates}} the approximate {{applicability of the}} criteria for the Glauber approximation to nuclear scattering of pions in the energy region of the resonance. It is shown that the approximation should give a reasonable fit to pion scattering from nuclei in the energy region of the (3, 3) resonance, {{in spite of the}} strong p-wave interaction between pions and nucleons. Nuclear <b>binding</b> <b>effects</b> on the target nucleons, {{play an important role in}} making the Glauber approximation valid with a reasonable accuracy. A new formulation of the pion-nucleon scattering amplitude as modified by the <b>effect</b> of nuclear <b>binding</b> on the target nucleon is proposed. The nuclear <b>binding</b> <b>effects</b> confine target nuclei into low-lying states in intermediate states. The locality of the T-matrix for nuclear scattering, which is essential in the Glauber approximation, is shown not to be violated by this freezing of nuclei. (21 refs) ...|$|R
