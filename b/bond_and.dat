40|$|In {{order to}} {{identify}} effective interest rate proxies for equity and mortgage REITs, this study analyzes seven different interest rate proxies that {{have been widely used}} in the REIT literature. They are the monthly holding period returns on long-term U. S. government <b>bonds</b> <b>and</b> high-grade corporate <b>bonds,</b> the percentage changes in yields for long-term U. S. government <b>bonds</b> <b>and</b> high-yield (Baa) corporate bonds, the difference between returns on long-term U. S. government <b>bonds</b> <b>and</b> T-bill rates, the spread between yields on high-yield (Baa) corporate <b>bonds</b> <b>and</b> returns on long-term U. S. government <b>bonds,</b> <b>and</b> the spread between returns on high-grade corporate <b>bonds</b> <b>and</b> returns on long-term U. S. government bonds. The overall OLS results suggest that mortgage REITs are sensitive to all proxies, while equity REITs are significantly affected by only changes in yields on long-term U. S. government <b>bonds</b> <b>and</b> high-yield corporate <b>bonds.</b> The time variation paths for sensitivities indicate that all interest rate sensitivities are time specific. Overall, the changes in yields on high-yield corporate bonds (Baa) has the strongest explanatory power for returns of equity and mortgage REITs for most of the 27 -year sample period (1972 through 1998) ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the risks and}} returns of long-term low-grade bonds for the period 1977 â€“ 1989.
