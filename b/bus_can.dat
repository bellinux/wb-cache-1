50|$|Typically the <b>CAN</b> <b>bus</b> monitor {{will listen}} to the traffic on the <b>CAN</b> <b>bus</b> in order to display it in a user interface. Often the <b>CAN</b> <b>bus</b> monitor offers the {{possibility}} to simulate <b>CAN</b> <b>bus</b> activity by sending CAN frames to the <b>bus.</b> The <b>CAN</b> <b>bus</b> monitor <b>can</b> therefore be used to validate expected CAN traffic from a given device or to simulate CAN traffic in order to validate the reaction from a given device connected to the <b>CAN</b> <b>bus....</b>|$|R

25|$|Hybrid {{technology}} for buses has seen increased attention since recent battery developments decreased battery weight significantly. Drivetrains consist of conventional diesel engines and gas turbines. Some designs concentrate on using car engines, recent designs {{have focused on}} using conventional diesel engines already used in bus designs, to save on engineering and training costs. Several manufacturers are currently working on new hybrid designs, or hybrid drivetrains that fit into existing chassis offerings without major re-design. A challenge to hybrid buses may still come from cheaper lightweight imports from the former Eastern block countries or China, where national operators are looking at fuel consumption issues surrounding {{the weight of the}} bus, which has increased with recent bus technology innovations such as glazing, air conditioning and electrical systems. A hybrid <b>bus</b> <b>can</b> also deliver fuel economy though through the hybrid drivetrain. Hybrid technology is also being promoted by environmentally concerned transit authorities.|$|E
25|$|Many {{competitors}} offer discount {{prices that}} undercut the major bus lines. Typical fares between East Coast cities range from $10 to $20, compared to major curbside bus lines (which typically cost between $1 and $25), terminal-operated bus lines (which cost between $14 and $35), and Amtrak (which costs about $100.) The industry has become highly competitive with companies offering hourly service between major cities. The Appalachian extensions of these lines tend to offer {{less of a}} price advantage; for example, in August 2006, one-way fares from New York to Pittsburgh on the Chinese-owned All State were $35 compared with $45 advance through Greyhound Lines, while tickets from State College, Pennsylvania, to New York were $35, compared to $46 for Greyhound. Chinatown buses also charge flat fees, while other intercity buses may vary pricing based on demand. Low prices led to high demand for many Chinatown bus routes, and although a single round trip can incur hundreds of dollars in expenses, a fully booked <b>bus</b> <b>can</b> net at least $340 in profits per round trip after these expenses are paid.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a design scheme of signal acquisition device, {{as the main}} chip with PIC 18 F 2480, MCP 2551 as CAN controller. Small car often used RS 485 bus but with {{the complexity of the}} car's subsystems increase and the progress of field <b>bus</b> technology, <b>CAN</b> <b>bus</b> systems in cars is use more and more broadly. How to record realtime path experiment data on the car's <b>CAN</b> <b>bus</b> and provide test data for reproducing the process of a cars path is very important. This paper describes high consistency of CAN signals {{that can be used for}} car path scenario. The main idea is to explain the design of hardware and software for the <b>CAN</b> <b>BUS</b> communication network. Hardware interface circuit mainly consist of CAN communication controller, high-speed opt coupler and <b>CAN</b> <b>BUS</b> driver MCP 2551, and design schematic circuit diagram for <b>CAN</b> <b>bus</b> system hardware. The software designs for <b>CAN</b> <b>BUS</b> network are mainly the design of <b>CAN</b> <b>BUS</b> data communication and exchange between nodes, and communication processing for switch-signal, analog signal. From the battery voltage data collected when Electric Vehicle are running, we can see that the system is accurate, stable without number lost, frame dropping and transfer error in data communication.

2500|$|Another type {{of local}} bus {{is called the}} [...] "Frescão" [...] (air-conditioned). These buses run several routes, the main being from Centro through Botafogo, Copacabana and Ipanema to Leblon (and vice versa), and from the International Airport to Barra, through the beach road. They are air conditioned—about —more upscale/comfortable and cost between R$6.00–R$12.00. However, it is only {{available}} during weekdays. The buses also run more frequently during the rush hours {{in the morning and}} evening. Going in the direction of Centro (city center), the <b>bus</b> <b>can</b> be flagged down on the beach road (buses with plaques showing [...] "Castelo").|$|E
2500|$|Once {{the audio}} {{engineer}} has {{made all the}} adjustments to a signal (e.g., the lead vocalist's singing through a microphone), such as equalization, adding effects, and so on, the signal is then electronically routed to {{a section of the}} mixing console known as [...] "bus", also called a [...] "mix group", [...] "subgroup" [...] or simply [...] "group". A group of signals may be routed through an additional bus before being sent to the main bus to allow the engineer to control the levels of several related signals at once. [...] For example, all of the different microphones for a drum set might be sent to their own bus so that the volume of the entire drum set sound can be controlled with a single fader or a pair of faders, rather than the audio engineer having to adjust all of the different drums and cymbals' mic volumes. A <b>bus</b> <b>can</b> often be processed just like an individual input channel, allowing the engineer to process a whole group of signals at once. Once again using the drum kit example, the use of bus-processing can enable the sound engineer to run all of the drum kit through an audio compressor effect to reduce unwanted signal peaks, rather than having to route all of the 10 or more mic signals on the drum kit individually.|$|E

40|$|In the Smart In-Car project, {{in-vehicle}} signals {{obtained from}} the CAN (Controller Area Network) bus are collected along with the GPS position from 200 equipped vehicles. The main <b>CAN</b> <b>bus</b> signals in the available data set from the Smart In-Car project are: speedometer, brake usage, steering position, rpm, indicator usage and fuel consumption, but many more <b>CAN</b> <b>bus</b> signals exist, offering possibilities for many applications. In this thesis, the applicability of <b>CAN</b> <b>bus</b> signals for estimating the Level of Service (LOS) on motorways is assessed. The real <b>CAN</b> <b>bus</b> data of single equipped vehicles, {{obtained from the}} Smart In-Car project, is used to estimate the LOS, using loop detector data as ground truth.
