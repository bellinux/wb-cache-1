5|$|A {{waterfall}} bong (or {{reverse bucket}} bong) is another method of smoking. It is assembled using a large plastic <b>bottle</b> (preferably about 2 liter), a bung or rubber stopper, a brass cut nozzle {{to act as}} a bowl and keep the marijuana (or other herbs) from entering the <b>bottle,</b> and an aerator screen. Once the <b>bottle</b> is filled to its neck in water the lid is screwed on, removing the rubber stopper and igniting the contents of the bowl leads to draining water to cause smoke to be drawn into the <b>bottle.</b> The cap is removed after the water has completely drained out, allowing the user to inhale the smoke.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bottle</b> trees grow best in well-drained, {{slightly}} acidic soil, in full sunshine. They are {{suited to}} cultivation in regional climates equivalent to USDA hardiness zones 9 to 12. In the first stages of growth, the <b>bottle</b> tree is very slow-growing, {{and the formation}} of the unique <b>bottle</b> shape is not visible until the tree is about 5 to 8 years old. Mature trees transplant easily, and can withstand intervals of up to three months between digging and replanting without detriment. <b>Bottle</b> trees grown from seed may take up to 20 years to flower. Flowering takes place after adult leaves have appeared.|$|E
5|$|During rehearsal, Marge {{struggles with}} {{a scene in}} which Blanche is {{supposed}} to break a glass <b>bottle</b> and attack Stanley, but she cannot muster enough anger towards Stanley to break the <b>bottle.</b> After coming home, Marge asks Homer to help her learn her lines, but Homer is uninterested. The day before the performance, Marge and Ned are again practising the <b>bottle</b> scene as Homer arrives to drive Marge home. Homer repeatedly interrupts the rehearsal. Imagining that Stanley is Homer, Marge finally smashes the <b>bottle</b> and lunges at Ned.|$|E

5|$|Most beers are {{cleared of}} yeast by {{filtering}} when packaged in bottles and cans. However, <b>bottle</b> conditioned beers retain some yeast—either by being unfiltered, or by being filtered and then reseeded with fresh yeast. It is usually {{recommended that the}} beer be poured slowly, leaving any yeast sediment {{at the bottom of}} the <b>bottle.</b> However, some drinkers prefer to pour in the yeast; this practice is customary with wheat beers. Typically, when serving a hefeweizen wheat beer, 90% of the contents are poured, and the remainder is swirled to suspend the sediment before pouring it into the glass. Alternatively, the <b>bottle</b> may be inverted prior to opening. Glass bottles are always used for <b>bottle</b> conditioned beers.|$|E
5|$|One further {{variation}} {{places a}} 6-sided die (although other sided die {{could also be}} used) {{on top of the}} <b>bottle.</b> If the <b>bottle</b> is knocked over and the die knocked onto the table, the player is awarded points equal to whatever side of the die lies facing upward when the die comes to a stop. This adds a random effect to hitting the <b>bottle</b> and in practice often results in players only striking the <b>bottle</b> in combination with other point-scoring shots.|$|E
5|$|Originally a <b>bottle</b> {{conditioned}} beer, FES {{has been}} pasteurised to ensure quality consistency since 1948. Since 1950, {{in an attempt}} to recreate the flavour profile of <b>bottle</b> conditioned FES, the beer has been produced by blending fresh FES with 2 per cent FES that has been aged for up to 100 days, which has developed a high lactic acid content. Finally, the beer is allowed to mature in the <b>bottle</b> for 28 days before being sent out for distribution.|$|E
60|$|Directly {{the first}} crate was, in {{accordance}} with his directions, carried into the parlour, the stranger flung himself upon it with extraordinary eagerness, and began to unpack it, scattering the straw with an utter disregard of Mrs. Hall's carpet.

The chemist's shop in Bramblehurst could not boast half so many. Quite a sight it was. Crate after crate yielded <b>bottles,</b> until all six were empty and the table high with straw; {{the only things that}} came out of these crates besides the <b>bottles</b> were a number of test-tubes and a carefully packed balance.|$|R
