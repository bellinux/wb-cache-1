25|$|A <b>block</b> <b>heater</b> warms {{the engine}} of an {{automobile}} in order to ease and speed starting and vehicle warm-up in cold weather. The most common type is an electric heating element connected through a power cord often routed through the vehicle's grille. The <b>block</b> <b>heater</b> may replace one of the engine's core plugs, or may be installed in line {{with one of the}} radiator or heater hoses. The <b>block</b> <b>heater,</b> first known as a head bolt heater, was invented in 1945 by Andrew Freeman in Grand Forks, North Dakota. Freeman used some scrap hoses and copper tubing onto the heating element of an old flat-iron and produced the first headbolt heater, which warmed the engine's water jacket and the oil film between cylinder heads and pistons. U.S. patent #2,487,326 was filed on November 4, 1946 and issued to Freeman on November 8, 1949.|$|E
25|$|There are {{alternatives}} to a <b>block</b> <b>heater</b> that offer {{some of the}} same benefits. These include heaters attached to the engine's oil pan, usually with magnets. Dipstick heaters can be installed in place of the engine's oil dipstick. Heated blankets are available for the entire engine area, as well. A timer can be used with any of these heaters, so that it {{does not have to be}} left on all the time. This can help lower the electrical costs of using a <b>block</b> <b>heater.</b>|$|E
25|$|A <b>block</b> <b>heater</b> warms {{an engine}} to {{increase}} the chances that the engine will start as well as warm up the vehicle faster than it normally would in extremely cold weather.|$|E

25|$|<b>Block</b> <b>heaters</b> are {{frequently}} used in regions with cold winters {{such as the}} northern United States, parts of Canada, Russia and Scandinavia. In colder climates, <b>block</b> <b>heaters</b> are often standard equipment in new vehicles. In extremely cold climates, electrical outlets are sometimes found in public or private parking lots, especially in multi-storey car parks. Some parking lots cycle the power on for 20 minutes and off for 20 minutes, to reduce electricity costs.|$|R
25|$|<b>Block</b> <b>heaters</b> or coolant heaters {{are also}} found on {{permanently}} installed systems using diesel engines to allow standby generator sets to take up load quickly in an emergency.|$|R
25|$|Heaters {{are also}} {{available}} for engine oil so that warm oil can immediately circulate throughout the engine during start up. The easier starting results from warmer, less viscous engine oil and less condensation of fuel on cold metal surfaces inside the engine; thus an engine <b>block</b> <b>heater</b> reduces a vehicle's emission of unburned hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide; also heat is available more instantly for the passenger compartment and glass defogging.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} type is an {{electric}} heating element in the cylinder block, connected through a power cord often routed through the vehicle's grille. The <b>block</b> <b>heater</b> may replace one of the engine's core plugs. In this fashion, the heater element is immersed in the engine's coolant, which then keeps most of the engine warm. This type of heater does not come with a pump. They may also be installed in line {{with one of the}} radiator or heater hoses. Some heaters pump and circulate the engine coolant while heating, others only heat the still coolant in the reservoir.|$|E
25|$|Andrew Freeman of Grand Forks, North Dakota, {{invented the}} head bolt heater around 1940 and {{received}} a patent for it on November 8, 1949. In 1951, Freeman received another patent on an improved head bolt heater. These early heaters replaced one of the engine's cylinder head bolts with a hollow, threaded shank containing a resistive heating element. Before the <b>block</b> <b>heater</b> was introduced, people {{used a variety of}} methods to warm engines before starting them, such as pouring hot water on the engine block or draining the engine's oil for storage inside overnight. Some even shoveled embers underneath their vehicle's engine to obtain the same effect.|$|E
50|$|Some lots have {{charging}} {{stations for}} battery vehicles. Some regions with especially cold winters provide electricity at most parking spots for engine <b>block</b> <b>heaters,</b> as antifreeze may be inadequate to prevent freezing.|$|R
5000|$|A {{variety of}} <b>block</b> <b>heaters</b> called a [...] "freeze plug heater" [...] can be installed, {{replacing}} {{one of the}} core plugs. The electrical heater is used to warm the engine coolant (and therefore the engine) before start up.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Block</b> <b>heaters</b> {{that run}} {{directly}} on the vehicle's own gasoline or diesel fuel supply are also available; these do not require an external power source. The coolant is heated and circulated, usually by thermosiphon, through the engine and the vehicle's heater core.|$|R
25|$|For 2010, {{the last}} year of {{production}} for the PT Cruiser, there was only one trim level available: the PT Cruiser Classic. It included a 2.4L Inline Four-Cylinder (I4) engine producing 150 horsepower, a standard four-speed automatic transmission with overdrive, an AM/FM stereo with single-disc CD player, 3.5-millimeter auxiliary audio input jack and six speakers, a rear-mounted spoiler, standard air conditioning, standard cruise control, standard tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS), standard front and front and rear side SRS airbags, standard keyless entry with two remotes and panic alarm, standard ABS anti-lock brakes, standard sixteen-inch alloy wheels, and more. Optional features included leather seating surfaces, a power front driver's bucket seat, an engine <b>block</b> <b>heater,</b> a power tilt-and-sliding sunroof, and heated dual front bucket seats. Pricing for the 2010 Chrysler PT Cruiser Classic, in MSRP, started at $18,275.00. Exterior color options were Bright Silver Metallic, Brilliant Black Crystal Pearl Coat, Deep Water Blue Pearl Coat, Inferno Red Crystal Tinted Pearl Coat, Silver Steel Metallic, and Stone White Clear Coat. The only interior color option was Pastel Slate Gray.|$|E
500|$|All flexible-fuel {{vehicles}} in Sweden use an E75 winter blend instead of E85 to avoid engine starting problems during cold weather. This blend was introduced since the winter 2006-07 and E75 is used from November until March. For temperature below [...] E85 flex vehicles require an engine <b>block</b> <b>heater.</b> The {{use of this}} device is also recommended for gasoline vehicles when temperatures drop below [...] Another option when extreme cold weather is expected is to add more pure gasoline in the tank, thus reducing the ethanol content below the E75 winter blend, or simply not to use E85 during extreme low temperature spells.|$|E

2500|$|In colder {{areas such}} as Finland, some {{northern}} US states and Canada there already exists some infrastructure for public power outlets provided primarily for use by <b>block</b> <b>heaters</b> and set with circuit breakers that prevent large current draws for other uses. These can sometimes be used to recharge electric vehicles, albeit slowly. [...] In public lots, some such outlets are turned on only when the temperature falls below -20Â°C, further limiting their use.|$|R
50|$|In cold weather, {{high speed}} diesel engines can be {{difficult}} to start because the mass of the cylinder block and cylinder head absorb the heat of compression, preventing ignition due to the higher surface-to-volume ratio. Pre-chambered engines make use of small electric heaters inside the pre-chambers called glowplugs, while direct-injected engines have these glowplugs in the combustion chamber. Many engines use resistive heaters in the intake manifold to warm the inlet air for starting, or until the engine reaches operating temperature. Engine <b>block</b> <b>heaters</b> (electric resistive heaters in the engine block) connected to the utility grid are used in cold climates when an engine is turned off for extended periods (more than an hour), to reduce startup time and engine wear. <b>Block</b> <b>heaters</b> are also used for emergency power standby Diesel-powered generators which must rapidly pick up load on a power failure. In the past, a wider variety of cold-start methods were used. Some engines, such as Detroit Diesel engines used a system to introduce small amounts of ether into the inlet manifold to start combustion. Others used a mixed system, with a resistive heater burning methanol. An impromptu method, particularly on out-of-tune engines, is to manually spray an aerosol can of ether-based engine starter fluid into the intake air stream (usually through the intake air filter assembly).|$|R
2500|$|Diesel fuel [...] {{in general}} is any liquid fuel used in diesel engines, whose fuel {{ignition}} takes place, without any spark, {{as a result of}} compression of the inlet air mixture and then injection of fuel. (Glow plugs, grid <b>heaters</b> and <b>block</b> <b>heaters</b> help achieve high temperatures for combustion during engine startup in cold weather.) Diesel engines have found broad use as a result of higher thermodynamic efficiency and thus fuel efficiency. This is particularly noted where diesel engines are run at part-load; as their air supply is not throttled as in a petrol engine, their efficiency still remains very high.|$|R
2500|$|Research by the Agricultural Engineering Department of the University of Saskatchewan {{has shown}} that {{operating}} a <b>block</b> <b>heater</b> for longer than four hours prior to starting a vehicle {{is a waste of}} energy. It was found that coolant temperature increased by almost [...] degrees in that period, regardless of the initial temperature (4 tests were run at ambient temperatures ranging from continued use of the heater for a further one or two, or more, hours achieved a mere 2 or 3 more degrees Celsius as conditions stabilized.

2500|$|In 1978, Ford {{offered the}} [...] "Diamond Jubilee Edition" [...] Thunderbird {{to commemorate the}} company's 75th year as an auto manufacturer. This option package {{escalated}} {{the price of the}} car to almost US$12,000, virtually doubling the standard price. Naturally, it included every option available except for a moonroof and an engine <b>block</b> <b>heater.</b> A similar option package, called [...] "Heritage", was available for 1979. Though this generation was a sales success with over 955,000 examples produced in its three-year run, Ford sought to downsize the Thunderbird further out of fuel efficiency and emissions concerns, leading to a redesign for 1980. For 1979 the 400 [...] CID engine was discontinued.|$|E
2500|$|Single tank {{conversions}} {{have been}} developed, largely in Germany, {{which have been}} used throughout Europe. [...] These conversions are designed to provide reliable operation with rapeseed oil that meets the German rapeseed oil fuel standard DIN 51605. [...] Modifications to the engines cold start regime assist combustion on start up and during the engine warm up phase. [...] Suitably modified indirect injection (IDI) engines {{have proven to be}} operable with 100% PPO down to temperatures of [...] [...] Direct injection (DI) engines generally have to be preheated with a <b>block</b> <b>heater</b> or diesel fired heater. [...] The exception is the VW Tdi (Turbocharged Direct Injection) engine for which a number of German companies offer single tank conversions. [...] For long term durability it has been found necessary to increase the oil change frequency and to pay increased attention to engine maintenance.|$|E
50|$|While {{gasoline}} {{internal combustion}} engines are {{much easier to}} start in cold weather than diesel engines, they can still have cold weather starting problems under extreme conditions. For years the solution was to park the car in heated areas. In {{some parts of the}} world the oil was actually drained and heated over night and returned to the engine for cold starts. In the early 1950s the gasoline Gasifier unit was developed, where, on cold weather starts, raw gasoline was diverted to the unit where part of the fuel was burned causing the other part to become a hot vapor sent directly to the intake valve manifold. This unit was quite popular until electric engine <b>block</b> <b>heaters</b> became standard on gasoline engines sold in cold climates.|$|R
40|$|SOA (Service-Oriented Architecture) is an {{architectural}} style for creating software systems. It encapsulates the functional behaviour behind services which are loosely coupled to each other. SOA brings flexibility, agility and dynamicity to software systems because it enables the collaboration of systems developed with different technologies. Moreover, SOA reduces {{the cost of}} the development since already existing services can be reused in new systems. Arrowhead Project aims to develop a technical framework, which enables the collaborative automation by networked embedded devices. The framework aims to solve the energy and competitiveness challenges with increased efficiency, which is gained by means of collaborative automation. Collaborative automation is enabled with SOA. The project is targeting to five different areas including Production, Smart Buildings and Infrastructures, Electro-Mobility, Energy Production and End-User Services, and finally Virtual Market of Energy. During the project, project partners are testing Arrowhead Framework by developing pilot applications for the project domains to demonstrate the use of the framework at various use-cases. This thesis presents pilot applications developed at FAST-lab at Tampere University of Technology during Pilot Generation 2. The first application is a managing and monitoring system for street lights and the second one for engine <b>block</b> <b>heaters.</b> They demonstrate how Arrowhead Framework could be used to develop Smart City applications. Since Arrowhead Framework is based on SOA, {{it should be possible to}} reuse the existing services in new applications. Therefore, a third pilot application was developed by integrating the components from the first two pilot applications. The resulting application controls the dimming of street lights based on the luminance and the heating time of engine <b>block</b> <b>heaters</b> based on the temperature. The application shows that Arrowhead Framework gives suitable tools to develop systems where the requested functionality by reusing the existing services in collaborative manner...|$|R

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the results of}} a project to develop an on-board emissions and performance measurement system (OEPMS) for the quantification of carbon monoxide (CO) emissions. Researchers measured emissions from a 1990, 2. 5 liter TBI engine passenger automobile over a typical suburb-to-city commute in the Minneapolis/St. Paul metropolitan area. As a test of the OEPMS, researchers measured CO emissions during cold weather cold starts and commutes at temperatures characteristic of the area's winter weather. Open-loop and closed-loop emissions of CO were measured and compared. Additionally, the effectiveness of magnetic-type <b>block</b> <b>heaters</b> was examined.
