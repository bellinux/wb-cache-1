40|$|Morphological {{studies of}} {{nighttime}} dark current {{data from the}} Nimbus 4 <b>backscattered</b> <b>UV</b> experiment indicate enhancements {{during the period of}} a full moon. The nature and magnitude of these lunar UV radiance enhancements are determined, and their potential use as a measure of nighttime ozone is considered. The data were grouped into five-day study intervals centered about each full moon sequence, and about each corresponding new moon interval. The analysis was performed in a magnetic frame of reference (McIlwain, 1961) in order to evaluate magnetospheric perturbation effects and to minimize the effects of charged energetic particle contamination or precipitation. All isolated elements showing spurious or abnormal enhancements were removed selectively (about 3 %) to further screen the data. Results demonstrate the presence and uniqueness of a lunar signal, induced by atmospherically <b>backscattered</b> <b>UV</b> radiation. This signal was not sufficiently strong, however, to accurately map global nighttime ozone on the Nimbus 4 instrument...|$|E

It is found that a nearby solar wind shock strongly affects the neutral hydrogen breeze.

40|$|A {{model is}} {{developed}} that describes {{changes in the}} sensitivity of the solar <b>backscatter</b> <b>UV</b> instrument deployed with Nimbus 7 to study variations with time in solar irradiance. The exponential decay of instrument exposure to the sun and that of time are combined, and the product is used to describe the sensitivity change. Measured UV irradiances are employed to develop the values of the exponential decays, and the degradation coefficients for time dependence are found to vary with time at shorter wavelengths. Instrument sensitivity is described in terms of a functional relationship based on exponential decay with time with time-varying time dependence and on exponential decay with exposure with constant exposure dependence. The relationship provides a technique for treating data from the solar <b>backscatter</b> <b>UV</b> instrument both at short- and long-term intervals, and solar irradiance is calculated based on the approach...|$|R

A direct relationship is established between radiance differences and differences in ozone column amounts, and {{it is noted that}} the structure of these ozone changes does not agree with current calculations of ozone reduction due to fluorocarbons.

40|$|A {{procedure}} {{was developed for}} determining vertical ozone distributions from spectral measurements of UV radiances diffusely reflected from the terrestrial atmosphere. In this procedure, the inversion method of Aruga and Igarashi (1976) is improved by incorporating the effects of multiple scattering and the lower boundary of the atmosphere. The improved inversion algorithm was tested using data of NIMBUS- 4 <b>backscattered</b> <b>UV</b> experiments. The results indicate that by using this method, the vertical distributions of atmospheric ozone can be obtained with high accuracy {{over a wide range}} of altitude...|$|E

The area of influence of Mount Etna extends from Western Sahara to Greece and even to Near Eastern countries and down to Tchad.

40|$|Data on ozone mixing ratios derived for {{the time}} period 1979 - 1986 from {{measurements}} of the solar <b>backscatter</b> <b>UV</b> instrument on board Nimbus- 7 were used to investigate space-time variations of atmospheric ozone in the equatorial middle atmospohere during this period. Evidence is presented for the appearance of equatorially trapped 'ozone Kelvin waves' above the 10 -mb level, having a zonal wavenumber-one component and an eastward migration period of about 7 days.

The long-term ozone-monitoring program requires a reduction of uncharacterized drifts in the satellite instrument to a value lower than the expected ozone trend at the 95 percent confidence level; this translates into a requirement for the calibration of the SSBUV to a 1 -sigma precision level of 1 percent from one flight to the next. A hierarchy of calibration standards is used to furnish redundancy and minimize biases; laboratory fixtures {{have been designed to}} minimize setup-induced systematic errors...|$|R

(1988) in their analysis of the SBUV data is {{likely to lead to}} an incorrect estimate of the ozone trend. A correction factor is given as a function of time and altitude that brings the SBUV data into approximate agreement with the SAGE, SME, and Dobson network ozone trends. It is suggested that the currently archived SBUV ozone data should be used with caution for periods of analysis exceeding 1 yr, since {{it is likely that the}} yearly decreases contained in the archived data are too large...|$|R
40|$|A {{method is}} {{proposed}} for the calculation of a multiple-scattering correction to the single-scattering calculation of the radiance of the terrestrial atmosphere resulting from backscattered ultraviolet solar radiation in the spectral region used in the ozone profile inversion. This method uses jointly the usual analytical and Monte Carlo methods. Effects of the lower boundary of the atmosphere, cloud tops, and ground surface are investigated both qualitatively and quantitatively. The ratio of multiple to single scattering is determined, and its importance in ozone profile inversion of <b>backscattered</b> <b>UV</b> solar radiation from the terrestrial atmosphere is evaluated. The polarization of the atmospheric radiance is treated briefly...|$|E
40|$|An {{inversion}} {{algorithm is}} presented, {{which is used}} to process Nimbus- 7 solar <b>backscattered</b> <b>UV</b> (SBUV) data collected between November 1978 and October 1980. The SBUV experiment utilizes a double monochromator in the nadir position which measures the backscattered solar radiation in twelve 1 -nm bands; a separate photometer measures the radiance at 343. 0 nm in the field of view coincident with the monochromator. The primary output of the inversion is the total ozone content in umkehr layers in units of m atm cm. In addition, the diagonal elements of the covariance matrix are reported; they represent the uncertainty in the derived ozone content in each layer. The solution covariance is noted to be independent of the measurements...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} errors in {{determining}} temperature, pressure, and density {{in the background}} atmosphere on the measurements of ozone by two different satellite sensors, the Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment II (SAGE II) spectrometer aboard the ERB satellite and the solar <b>backscattered</b> <b>UV</b> (SBUV) spectrometer aboard Nimbus 7, were determined. The {{manner in which the}} differences in these background atmosphere measurements propagate is demonstrated by making direct comparisons of stratospheric ozone profiles by the SBUV and the SAGE II spectrometers. It is shown that, in regions with strong vertical ozone gradients (particularly at 70 mbar in the tropics), modest differences in vertical positioning could result in differences of 5 to 10 percent in ozone concentrations...|$|E

The data reveal a strong semiannual modulation of Kelvin wave activity, confirming the results of previous rocketsonde observations. A comparison of the eight-year-average ensemble spectra to the semiannual oscillation in the stratospheric zonal winds revealed a seasonal asymmetry in the strength of Kelvin waves, which mimics the asymmetry observed in the zonal winds. No consistent relationship was observed with the quasi-biennial oscillation in the lower stratosphere, while correlations with the upper stratospheric winds are weak or nonexistent...|$|R

40|$|Ozone mixing ratios at {{pressure}} levels near 2 mbar are analyzed {{for the purpose}} of estimating the average response of the upper stratospheric ozone to solar UV variability on the time scale of the solar rotation period. The data were obtained from observations made with the Nimbus 4 <b>backscattering</b> <b>UV</b> radiometer in 13 latitude zones between 65 degrees N and 65 degrees S. The anaysis showed that temporal variations are negatively correlated with changes in zonally averaged equivalent temperature measured simultaneously by Nimbus 4 radiometer. A linear regression analysis is performed in order to obtain estimates of the average percent change of ozone at low latitudes, on the considered time scale for given changes in 10. 7 -cm flux, and in the UV flux model developed by Lean et al.

The spectral anomalies are explainable as structure at the 1 - 5 % level in the ozone absorption coefficient, as measured by Bass and Paur (1981). The new absorption coefficient measurements are judged to approach the 1 %-level of accuracy in atmospheric radiation calculation, which should resolve discrepancies between different Dobson wavelength pairs and between different instruments and permit the more accurate analysis of such second-order effects as NO emission, SO 2 absorption in polluted atmospheres, and Raman scattering effects...|$|E

These measurements started with the BUV experiment flown on Nimbus 4 from 1970 to 1977 and are presently being continued with the Solar and Backscattered Ultraviolet/Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (SBUV/TOMS) launched on Nimbus 7 in 1978. NOAA's improved version (SBUV/ 2) is to fly until sometime in the 1990 s and NASA plans to fly an SBUV/ 2 on the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite in 1989.

Good correlation between LIMS and SBUV observations is noted in the ozone layer bounded by pressures of 31. 2 - 15. 6 mb; absolute differences are generally less than 10 percent, with similar zonal variations. Above 35 km SAGE values are systematically larger than SBUV or LIMS. The differences generally increase with height and are largest in the tropics. Finally, excellent agreement is noted to exist among the three data sets between 10 and 35 km of altitude with respect to the latitude dependence of the ozone profiles...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{decrease}} of {{the concentration of}} ozone de-pleting substances (ODSs) in the stratosphere {{over the past decade}} raises the question to what extent observed changes in stratospheric ozone over this period are consistent with known changes in the chemical composition and possible changes in atmospheric transport. Here we present a se-ries of ozone sensitivity calculations with a stratospheric chemistry transport model (CTM) driven by meteorologi-cal reanalyses from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, covering the period 1978 â€“ 2009. In or-der to account for the reversal in ODS trends, ozone trends are analysed as piecewise linear trends over two periods, 1979 â€“ 1999 and 2000 â€“ 2009.

40|$|The {{three-dimensional}} morphology of the Antarctic {{ozone minimum}} {{was obtained by}} mapping ozone distribution data from Nimbus- 7 solar <b>backscatter</b> <b>UV</b> instrument, obtained at different pressure levels, on a south polar projection. These maps show that a clearly defined ozone minimum relative to the local ozone field extends throughout the stratosphere from about 10 km to above 50 km, though {{the intensity of the}} ozone decrease becomes less with altitude. The examination of the behavior of the general ozone-hole area suggests the existence of at least three distinct regions: (1) the region below 33 km, where ozone follows the pattern of the ozone hole, exhibiting a strong trend since 1979 and decreasing from late August to a minimum in October; (2) the 33 - 43 km height region of relatively stable ozone concentration; and (3) the region above 43 km, where ozone is again fluctuating, with a decrease during September to a minimum in October...|$|R
40|$|The {{sensitivity}} of the total ozone distribution in the Douglass et al. (1989) photochemical model to the dynamical inputs of ozone and the zone perturbation scenarios was investigated by computing the residual circulation from three sets of heating rates (used in computing the advection field). The model ozone results were compared to solar <b>backscattered</b> <b>UV</b> ozone data (SBUV). It was found that, depending on the dynamical inputs, the modeled global average total ozone varied up to 10 percent (with even more substantial seasonal and latitudinal variabilities), indicating that total ozone in the middle to high latitudes is very sensitive to the advection field below 100 mbar, the region where the heating rates are most uncertain. The modeled total ozone showed better agreement with solar SBUV climatology when computed horizontal eddy diffusion was used...|$|E
40|$|Values of {{the monthly}} mean heating rates and the {{residual}} circulation characteristics were calculated using NMC data for temperature and the solar <b>backscattered</b> <b>UV</b> ozone for the period between 1979 and 1986. The results were used in a two-dimensional photochemical model {{in order to examine}} the effects of temperature and residual circulation on the interannual variability of ozone. It was found that the calculated total ozone was more sensitive to variations in interannual residual circulation than in the interannual temperature. The magnitude of the modeled ozone variability was found to be similar to the observed variability, but the observed and modeled year-to-year deviations were, for the most part, uncorrelated, due to the fact that the model did not account for most of the QBO forcing and for some of the observed tropospheric changes...|$|E
40|$|The {{contents}} of NO {{in the upper}} stratosphere, mesosphere, and thermosphere were determined {{as a function of}} time and latitude, using spectral scan data for 1979 through 1986 from the solar <b>backscattered</b> <b>UV</b> instrument on Nimbus 7. In that period, the integrated column amount of NO near the equator decreased from 6. 4 x 10 to the 14 th molecules/sq cm to 3. 3 x 10 to the 14 th molecules/sq cm. The time dependence of the decrease in NO correlated with solar activity, following the decline in solar activity from a solar maximum in 1979 to solar minimum in 1985 - 86. At middle and high latitudes, on the other hand, the NO concentration was found to be maximal in 1982 - 1983, a few years after the solar cycle maximum, and declined thereafter...|$|E
40|$|Midlatitude 100 -mb height {{fields are}} {{employed}} {{to determine the}} effects of ground based sampling locations on measurements of variations in the total ozone content of the atmosphere. The precision of the zonal average heights computed by the technique of Angell and Korshover (1978) from data over ozone sampling areas at 50 deg N is compared to the zonal average computed from the entire data set. Linear regressions of ozone contents determined by an analysis of <b>backscatter</b> <b>UV</b> satellite data with respect to 100 mb heights are utilized to transform zonal differences in height to ozone levels. The zonal average total ozone sampling error is found to be on the order of 2 % for midlatitudes of the Northern hemisphere, indicating that the general shape of ozone trends determined by ground-based observations appears to be real and the increase of ozone from the mid- 1960 's to the early 1970 's may be greater than previously suggested...|$|R
40|$|An {{analysis}} of long baseline NIMBUS 7 SBUV (Solar <b>Backscatter</b> <b>UV</b> Spectrometer) {{observations of the}} latitudinal variation of the noontime vertical Mg' content above approx. 70 km have revealed seasonal, solar activity and magnetic activity dependencies in the Mg+ content. The distributions were categorized in terms of magnetic coordinates partially because transport processes lifting metallic ions from the main meteor ionization layer below 100 km up into the F- region and down again are controlled by electrodynamical processes. Alternatively, the Nimbus Mg+ distributions may simply {{be a result of}} ion/neutral chemistry changes resulting from atmospheric changes and not dynamics. In such a case magnetic control would not dominate the distributions. Using in situ satellite measurements of metal ions from the Atmosphere Explorer satellites in the region above the main meteor layer and published sounding rocket measurements of the main metallic ion layers, the effects of the dynamics on the vertical content are delineated. The consequences of atmospheric changes on the vertical content are explored by separating the Nimbus measurements in a geodetic frame of reference...|$|R
40|$|The {{archived}} tape {{products from}} the spectral scan mode measurements of solar irradiance (SUNC tapes) and Earth radiance (EARTH tapes) by the Solar <b>Backscatter</b> <b>UV</b> (SBUV) instrument aboard Nimbus 7 are described. Incoming radiation from 160 to 400 nm is measured at intervals of 0. 2 nm. The scan-to-scan repeatability of the solar irradiance measurements ranges from approximately 0. 5 to 1 percent longward of 280 nm, to 2 percent around 210 nm and 4 percent near 175 nm. The repeatability of the Earth radiance values ranges from 2 to 3 percent at longer wavelengths and low zenith angles to 10 percent at shorter wavelengths and high zenith angles. The tape formats are described in detail, including file structure and contents of each type of record. Catalogs of the tapes and the time period covered are provided, along with lists of the days lacking solar irradiance measurements and the days dedicated to Earth radiance measurements. The method for production of the tapes is outlined and quality control measures are described. How radiances and irradiances are derived from the raw counts, the corrections for changes in instrument sensitivity, and related uncertainties are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Formaldehyde (HCHO) is an {{important}} tracer of tropospheric photochemistry, whose slant column abundance can be retrieved from satellite measurements of solar <b>backscattered</b> <b>UV</b> radiation, using differential absorption retrieval techniques. In this work a spectral fitting sensitivity analysis is conducted on HCHO slant columns retrieved from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment 2 (GOME- 2) instrument. Despite quite different spectral fitting approaches, the retrieved HCHO slant columns have geographic distributions that generally match expected HCHO sources, though the slant column magnitudes and corresponding uncertainties are particularly sensitive to the retrieval set-up. The choice of spectral fitting window, polynomial order, I 0 correction, and inclusion of minor absorbers tend to have the largest impact on the fit residuals. However, application of a reference sector correction using observations over the remote Pacific Ocean, is shown to largely homogenise the resulting HCHO vertical columns, thereby largely reducing any systematic erroneous spectral fitting...|$|E
40|$|Two {{independent}} 22 -month time {{intervals of}} NIMBUS 7 solar <b>backscattered</b> <b>UV</b> (SBUV) ozone and {{stratospheric and mesospheric sounder}} (SAMS) temperature measurements {{for the upper}} stratosphere at low latitudes are analyzed to calculate mean responses to observed changes in solar ultraviolet spectral irradiance occurring on the time scale of the solar rotation period. Average cross-correlation functions of both SBUV ozone and SAMS temperature versus the solar 205 nm flux are in substantial agreement for these two intervals. Linear regression methods are applied to estimate response amplitudes or sensitivities. The derived sensitivities and phase lags relative to the 205 nm flux are also in approximate agreement for the two separate intervals although the temperature response measurements exhibit larger deviations. These results support the validity of previously reported measurements on the 27 -day time scale, and impose firmer constraints on proposed theoretical models for the response of the stratosphere to solar UV forcing on both short and long time scales...|$|E
40|$|Simultaneous in situ {{measurements}} of temperature, pressure, and the NO, NO 2, O 3, jNO 2, CH 4, H 2 O, and CO 2 concentrations {{were conducted in}} the 40 - to 26 -km region of the stratosphere using the JPL Balloon-borne Laser In Situ Sensor, a tunable diode laser absorption spectrometer. The NO, NO 2, CH 4, H 2 O, and CO 2 concentration measurements generally show good agreement with previous observations, with a tendency for somewhat lower NO 2 amounts. Measured O 3 concentrations at 38 km agree well with comparable measurements from in situ UV photometers, but at 28 km they are lower by about 10 percent and agree more closely with the solar <b>backscattered</b> <b>UV</b> data. A decline was found in NO 2 during the night over a 5 -km altitude range, which implies either lower NO 2 postsunset profiles, or an NO 2 decay rate that is significantly higher than current model predictions that use N 2 O 5 chemistry...|$|E

40|$|From an {{examination}} of the agreements and differences between different satellite instruments, it is difficult to believe that existing satellite instruments determine upper stratospheric ozone much better than 4 pct.; by extension, it probably would require at least a 4 pct. change to be reliably detected as a change. The best estimates of the vertical profiles of ozone change in the upper stratosphere between 1979 and 1986 are judged to be those given by the two SAGE satellite instruments. SAGE- 2 minus SAGE- 1 gives a much lower ozone reduction than that given by the archived Solar <b>Backscatter</b> <b>UV</b> data. The average SAGE profiles of ozone changes between 20 and 50 degs north and between 20 and 50 degs south are given. The SAGE- 1 and SAGE- 2 comparison gives an ozone reduction of about 4 pct. at 25 km over temperate latitudes. Five ground based Umkehr stations between 36 and 52 degs north, corrected for the effects of volcanic aerosols, report an ozone reduction between 1979 and 1987 at Umkehr layer 8 of 9 + or - 5 pct. The central estimate of upper stratospheric ozone reduction given by SAGE at 40 km is less than the central value estimated by the Umkehr method at layer 8...|$|R

No instrument throughput degradation has been identified beyond this level and has been confirmed through ice radiance comparisons.
