5|$|Fellow revolutionary Panayot Hitov later {{described}} the adult Levski as being of medium height and having an agile, wiry appearance—with light, greyish-blue eyes, <b>blond</b> <b>hair,</b> {{and a small}} moustache. He added that Levski abstained from smoking and drinking. Hitov's memories of Levski's appearance are supported by Levski's contemporaries, revolutionary and writer Lyuben Karavelov and teacher Ivan Furnadzhiev. The only differences are that Karavelov claimed Levski was tall rather than of medium height, while Furnadzhiev noted that his moustache was light brown and his eyes appeared hazel.|$|E
5|$|Gaudí's {{personal}} appearance—Nordic features, <b>blond</b> <b>hair</b> {{and blue}} eyes—changed radically {{over the course}} of time. As a young man, he dressed like a dandy in costly suits, sporting well-groomed hair and beard, indulging gourmet taste, making frequent visits to the theatre and the opera and visiting his project sites in a horse carriage. The older Gaudí ate frugally, dressed in old, worn-out suits, and neglected his appearance to the extent that sometimes he was taken for a beggar, such as after the accident that caused his death.|$|E

60|$|The bald {{heads of}} the ancient Ki were bobbing in amazement, first to one maid and then toward the other. The <b>blond</b> <b>hairs</b> of the two Ki-Ki were {{standing}} almost on end, and their eyes stared straight before them as if stupefied with astonishment. Nerle was bellowing with rude laughter and holding his sides {{to keep from getting}} a stitch in them, while Prince Marvel stood quietly attentive and smiling with genuine amusement. For he alone understood what had happened to separate the twin High Ki.|$|R
5|$|The FBI {{announced}} that Aruban authorities had provided its agency with documents, suspect interviews, and other evidence. Investigators found {{a piece of}} duct tape with strands of <b>blond</b> <b>hair</b> attached to it; the samples were tested at a Dutch lab. A group from the Aruban police and prosecutor's office then traveled to the FBI central laboratory at Quantico, Virginia, to consult with American investigators. The hair samples were then tested a second time. The FBI {{announced that}} the hair samples {{did not belong to}} Holloway.|$|E
5|$|A pop ballad, {{the song}} {{includes}} instrumentation from guitars, keyboards, drums and a synthesizer, and its lyrics deal with deceit, mistrust and childhood scars. It {{is also about}} being strong, which Madonna recalled {{in an interview that}} she thought about her relationship with her parents, while writing the lyrics. The music video, directed by James Foley, shows Madonna's first image makeover, featuring her with a cleaner look, shoulder-length wavy golden <b>blond</b> <b>hair,</b> conservative wardrobe and subtle make-up. This toned down blond appearance was again inspired by Marilyn Monroe.|$|E
5|$|The Child has curly <b>blond</b> <b>hair</b> {{and sits}} on a white cloth, {{animated}} and upright, {{at the side of}} the Virgin's lap. Like Mary, his body is shown frontally, his head in three quarters view. He reaches for what seems to be a parrot perched on her lap. At some point the Child's nudity was covered up; this overpaint was removed during a late 20th-century restoration. He is intended to represent both the host and Eucharist, common allusions in Early Netherlandish art and reflecting that the panel was intended for the celebration of mass.|$|E

5|$|The Rokeby Venus {{depicts the}} Roman goddess of love, beauty and {{fertility}} reclining languidly on her bed, {{her back to}} the viewer—in Antiquity, portrayal of Venus from a back view was a common visual and literary erotic motif—and her knees tucked. She is shown without the mythological paraphernalia normally included in depictions of the scene; jewellery, roses, and myrtle are all absent. Unlike most earlier portrayals of the goddess, which show her with <b>blond</b> <b>hair,</b> Velázquez's Venus is a brunette. The female figure can be identified as Venus {{because of the presence of}} her son, Cupid.|$|E
5|$|The song's video {{features}} close-up {{shots of}} Beyoncé and incorporates psychedelic light effects and symmetrical filming photography. As the acoustic guitar begins playing, Beyoncé's face comes into view. She stands with her <b>blond</b> <b>hair</b> draped just below her exposed shoulders. As she intently {{stares into the}} camera, her skin glistens as though it has been coated with a honey-like and glittery substance. Turning her head from right to left, with her eyes fixed off-camera, Beyoncé starts belting out the first verse. As the chorus is reached, scenes of Beyoncé in a darkened room are shown. Additionally, she places her face delicately against dripping water, gently brushing it with her lips and palms. The scenery changes and Beyoncé {{is back in the}} darkened chamber, where she removes her dress.|$|E
5|$|Munch (Richard Belzer) is {{reluctant}} {{to follow up on}} the case of murdered drug addict Jenny Goode, who was run over by a car. The case has been cold for three months, but he is made to feel guilty by his partner Bolander (Ned Beatty) into reexamining it. Munch makes no progress after speaking with the family and reexamining notes. Based on witness accounts of a man with long <b>blond</b> <b>hair</b> and a black car, Munch spends all night looking through suspect photos until he finds a man with a black car with front end damage and long black hair, but blond eyebrows. Munch and Bolander question him, believing the suspect (Joe Hansard) to have dyed his hair to change his appearance after killing the woman. He quickly confesses to having hit her accidentally while driving drunk.|$|E

5|$|The {{panel is}} the {{smallest}} extant work by van der Weyden and follows the tradition of a Madonna Lactans, with significant differences. Christ {{is dressed in a}} red garment, as opposed to the swaddling he usually wears in 15th-century Virgin and Child portrayals. This is one of two exceptions where he is fully clothed; the other is Robert Campin's Madonna in Frankfurt, where he is shown in blue clothing. Mary's unbound <b>blond</b> <b>hair</b> falls across her shoulders and down across her arms. Showing the influence of Campin, it is brushed behind the ears. She wears a crown as Queen of Heaven and a ring on a finger as the Bride of Christ. Reinforcing this, the blue colour of her robe alludes to her devotion and fidelity to her son. The folds of her dress are reminiscent of the lengthy, crisp, curved intertwined gowns of Gothic sculpture.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} {{begins with an}} open shot of an {{airplane}} flying surrounded by many doves, referencing the works of Hong Kong director John Woo. Spears appears with <b>blond</b> <b>hair</b> dressed as a flight attendant, receiving a phone call. After serving some of the passengers, she leads a middle aged overweight man {{to the bathroom and}} seduces him. She peels off the man's mask to reveal an attractive man (Matthew Felker) hiding underneath it and steals a black pass from his pocket when they resume kissing. Spears is then dropped {{into the back of a}} Ducati 999, driven by a shirtless male (Tyson Beckford) in a futuristic Paris, that was compared to the 1982 film Blade Runner. She wears a tight black catsuit and sports red hair, inspired by the character of Sydney Bristow from television series Alias. They pass a woman and lift up her dress, a homage to the iconic Marilyn Monroe scene in the 1955 film The Seven Year Itch. They also pass two women frolicking in a store window.|$|E
