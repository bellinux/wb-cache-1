25|$|Former Duke University and NBA {{standout}} Antonio Lang bannered the Thunder in the Commissioner's Cup. After a sub-par {{performance in}} the tournament opener, Lang {{proved to be the}} right import for Red Bull. The Thunder advanced to their first finals appearance against the mighty San Miguel Beermen. Red Bull took the first two games of the series behind strong performances by Lang and Harp. The Beermen later tied the series at 2–2 in a physically intense battle that saw several suspensions on the Red <b>Bull</b> <b>side.</b> But in Game five, Red Bull won 79–77 after a potential game-tying basket by San Miguel import Nate Johnson was blocked from behind by Miller with no time left. In Game six, Lang recovered from a four-point outing in Game five to lead Red Bull to their first PBA championship. Lang was also named as Best Import of the Commissioners Cup.|$|E
60|$|One of them {{by reason}} of his {{tailor-made}} suit and a large ring on his little finger, was especially attractive to me. He was a handsome man of a sinister type, and I regarded his expressionless face {{as that of a}} gambler. I didn't know that he was a poker player but it amused me to think so. Another buyer was a choleric Cornishman whom the other men sometimes goaded into paying five or six cents more than the market admitted, by shrewdly playing on his hot temper. A third was a tall gaunt old man of New England type, obstinate, honest, but of sanguine temperament. He was always on the <b>bull</b> <b>side</b> of the market and a loud debater.--The fourth, a quiet little man of smooth address, acted as peacemaker.|$|E

50|$|Another {{domestic}} {{painting that}} {{is attributed to}} the Kleophon Painter is a calyx krater with two youths preparing to sacrifice a bull, discovered in Spina, Italy, and currently located in Ferrara in the Museo Nazionale di Spina. The Italian location indicates that the Kleophon painter shipped his vases outside of Greece. The date range is 450 to 400 BCE. This is the same date range found on {{almost all of the}} Kleophon Painter’s works which means {{that he did not have}} anyone carry on his workshop after he died. The krater itself has a leaf pattern that circles the top lip. There is a meander pattern, interrupted by a cross every fourth block, that wraps around the bottom. Side A shows two young males leading a bull to an altar, presumably to be sacrificed. Both of these young males have on robes that stop just above their feet. The eyes, again, are triangular shaped on the youths, but much more circular on the <b>bull.</b> <b>Side</b> B shows the same two boys, but no bull. It can be assumed that the goal of painting the krater this way was to show that the bull had been sacrificed. The boys are standing at the same altar that they had led the bull to on Side A.|$|E
40|$|Repeat {{breeding}} in buffaloes {{was evaluated}} {{in terms of}} incidence, risk factors and diagnosis. The incidence of repeat breeding is low in buffaloes however in different studies the incidence varied from 0. 70 % to 30 %. Because of seasonal suppression of fertility repeat breeding in buffaloes {{should be limited to}} the breeding season. Spring and winter calving, first parity, peri-parturient disease and lactation are significant risk factors for repeat breeding in buffaloes. The etiologies of repeat breeding in buffaloes can be failure of fertilization and early embryonic deaths. Only a few of causes of failure of fertilization have been identified in buffaloes. Ovulatory disturbances and ovarian cysts are uncommon in buffaloes and cysts have poor clinical manifestation. Endometritis is the common female cause of fertilization failures in buffaloes whereas poor semen quality and improper insemination are the <b>bull</b> <b>side</b> factors for fertilization failures. Early embryonic deaths are common in buffaloes mated/inseminated during the end of the breeding season due to a low luteal progesterone however embryonic deaths occur late (< 25 days) in buffaloes. Diagnostic approaches for repeat breeding include vaginoscopic and transrectal examination and uterine cytology for genital health. More precise evaluations of the ovarian and uterine function can be obtained by ultrasonographic and hysteroscopic examinations performed sequentially however, precise diagnosis of the cause of repeat breeding seems difficult...|$|E
50|$|Sitting Bull also {{refuses to}} portray Custer's Last Stand as a cowardly sneak attack. Instead, he asks Cody {{to act out}} the {{massacre}} of a peaceful Sioux village by marauding bluecoats.

He was voted 'Player's' Player of the Year and was a great addition to the <b>Bulls</b> <b>side.</b> His direct running and combination of speed and power meant he was equally effective in the second row or in the centres, {{and he had been}} a consistent try scorer in both positions. He was also a tremendous tackler and quickly became a favourite with the Bulls fans.|$|R

50|$|The helmet {{design was}} unique for a {{professional}} football team.

However, {{for the third year}} in a row, Davids tasted defeat {{at this stage of the}} season as they lost 19-23 to a Blue <b>Bulls</b> <b>side</b> that won the title a week later.|$|R
60|$|From the <b>bull's</b> <b>side,</b> just {{forward of}} the flank, {{protruded}} a feathered arrow-end, which accounted for his savageness. Guided by that instinct which came from the old hunting days of the primordial world, Buck proceeded to cut the bull out from the herd. It was no slight task. He would bark and dance about {{in front of the}} bull, just out of reach of the great antlers and of the terrible splay hoofs which could have stamped his life out with a single blow. Unable to turn his back on the fanged danger and go on, the bull would be driven into paroxysms of rage. At such moments he charged Buck, who retreated craftily, luring him on by a simulated inability to escape. But when he was thus separated from his fellows, two or three of the younger bulls would charge back upon Buck and enable the wounded bull to rejoin the herd.|$|R

50|$|The Bulls started April {{off with}} a win against rivals Leeds Rhinos, Bradford won the game 12-4 with Jamie Langley and Ben Jeffries scoring a try each and Jarrod Sammut kicked both goals.

Addy kicked 10 goals.

Platt scored the only Bradford try and Addy converted. Bradford were dumped out of the Challenge Cup by heavily favoured Warrington Wolves however the Bulls battled bravely before finally losing 32-16 with Purtell, Lulia and Olivier Elima all scoring and Luke Gale kicking 2 goals on his return.|$|R
