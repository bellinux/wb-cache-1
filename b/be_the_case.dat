5|$|Bonham's Case was {{met with}} mixed {{reactions}} at the time, with King James I and his Lord Chancellor, Lord Ellesmere, were both deeply unhappy with it. One {{of the reasons for}} Coke's dismissal from the Common Pleas in 1613 was suggested to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>case.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The {{acquaintance}} theorist {{can argue}} that one has a noninferentially justified belief [...] "that P" [...] only when one has the thought [...] "that P" [...] and one is acquainted with both the fact that P <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> <b>the</b> thought [...] "that P", and the relation of correspondence holding between the thought [...] "that P" [...] {{and the fact that}} P <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case.</b> So I must not only know the proposition P, and the fact that P <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> but also know that the fact that P <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>is</b> what makes proposition P true.|$|R

5|$|Some major oilfields such as Ghawar {{are found}} under {{the sands of}} Saudi Arabia. Geologists believe that other oil {{deposits}} were formed by aeolian processes in ancient deserts as may <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> {{with some of the}} major American oil fields.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} {{view is that}} it is not {{the formal}} structure of the Council – which in theory is capable of exercising judicial, legislative and review functions – but the presence of a practically single-party Parliament that drastically undermines the PCMR's powers, restricting it solely to an advisory capacity. This may not <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> if a strong Opposition exists in Parliament to obstruct the mustering of the required two-thirds voting majority required to push through legislation without the endorsement of the Council.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the episode, Robert Lipton {{walks out}} of the {{building}} with Philip and he notices Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez). Robert asks why Oscar did not call after the fundraiser and heavily hints at his attraction to Oscar, which Oscar has repeatedly suggested to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>case.</b> Oscar appears taken aback, but flattered and tempted.|$|E

5|$|Based on {{morphological}} features, the Alexandrine parakeet {{has been}} proposed as the founder population for all Psittacula species on Indian Ocean islands, with new populations settling during the species's southwards colonisation from its native South Asia. Features of that species gradually disappear in species further away from its range. Many endemic Mascarene birds, including the dodo, are descended from South Asian ancestors, and Hume has proposed that this may also <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> for all the parrots there. Sea levels were lower during the Pleistocene, so {{it was possible for}} species to colonise some of these less isolated islands.|$|E
5|$|During Operation Market Garden, the Allied {{parachute}} landings in the Netherlands, JG 11 {{was credited}} with 22 aircraft downed on 22 September, with two credited to Specht. Four days later, Specht claimed two RAF Hawker Typhoons near Deventer. According to RAF records only three Typhoons were shot down on 26 September; two to flak and one in aerial combat against Jagdgeschwader 53 Bf 109s near Apeldoorn. No fighters were recorded lost near Deventer. However, it may <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> that loss records were lost or not well kept, meaning Specht's claims cannot be traced and may well be accurate.|$|E
5|$|Geologists {{feared that}} a large {{earthquake}} that shook Borah Peak, Idaho's tallest mountain, in 1983 would restart volcanic activity at Craters of the Moon, though this proved not to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>case.</b> Geologists predict that the area will experience its next eruption {{some time in the}} next 900 years with the most likely period in the next 100 years.|$|E

5|$|In {{nearly all}} species of birds, an individual's sex is {{determined}} at fertilisation. However, {{one recent study}} demonstrated temperature-dependent sex determination among the Australian brushturkey, for which higher temperatures during incubation resulted in a higher female-to-male sex ratio. This, however, was later proven to not <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>case.</b> These birds do not exhibit temperature-dependent sex determination, but temperature-dependent sex mortality.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unclear}} exactly who was {{responsible}} for the damage on the German ships. It is possible that the mines were air-dropped by RAF Handley Page Hampden bombers. Should this <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> the bombers achieved far more damage than the Royal Navy {{and the rest of the}} RAF combined.|$|E
5|$|No {{compounds}} of oganesson {{have been}} synthesized yet, but calculations on theoretical compounds {{have been performed}} since 1964. It is expected that if the ionization energy of the element is high enough, {{it will be difficult}} to oxidize and therefore, the most common oxidation state would be 0 (as for other noble gases); nevertheless, this appears not to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>case.</b>|$|E

5|$|Several local meteorologists, however, did {{depart from}} the {{official}} predictions of a Tampa Bay landfall {{as early as the}} morning of August 13. Jim Farrell of WINK, Robert Van Winkle WBBH, Steve Jerve of WFLA in Tampa, Jim Reif of WZVN in Fort Myers, and Tom Terry of WFTV in Orlando, all broke with their national news forecasts and stated at around 1500 UTC that Charley was going to turn early, striking around Charlotte Harbor and traveling over Orlando, as would prove to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>case.</b>|$|E
5|$|Species {{recognition}} {{is based on}} combinations of minor structural variations in the shape, aperture, whorl contour, umbilical region, and color pattern. It appears to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> that many species have a stable color pattern, while other species seem to vary tremendously. Adequate unselected field samples will enable {{a better understanding of}} the relative stability or variability of particular species in single localities.|$|E
5|$|Species that {{do need to}} swim {{continuously}} {{to breathe}} go through {{a process known as}} sleep swimming, in which the shark is essentially unconscious. It is known from experiments conducted on the spiny dogfish that its spinal cord, rather than its brain, coordinates swimming, so spiny dogfish can continue to swim while sleeping, and this also may <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> in larger shark species.|$|E

5|$|Supporters of {{evolution}} dismiss such criticisms as counterfactual, and {{some argue that}} the opposite seems to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>case.</b> A study published by the author and illustrator Gregory S. Paul found that religious beliefs, including belief in creationism and disbelief in evolution, are positively correlated with social ills like crime. The Barna Group surveys find that Christians and non-Christians in the U.S. have similar divorce rates, and the highest divorce rates in the U.S. are among Baptists and Pentecostals, both sects which reject evolution and embrace creationism.|$|E
5|$|The Moon {{may have}} {{dramatically}} affected {{the development of}} life by moderating the planet's climate. Paleontological evidence and computer simulations show that Earth's axial tilt is stabilized by tidal interactions with the Moon. Some theorists think that without this stabilization against the torques applied by the Sun and planets to Earth's equatorial bulge, the rotational axis might be chaotically unstable, exhibiting chaotic changes over millions of years, as appears to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> for Mars.|$|E
