50|$|Throughout {{the decade}} {{prior to the}} club's formation, {{combined}} parish teams were entered in various competitions. In 1980 Clonmore and Killea amalgamated as Clonmore / Killea and enter hurling teams competing at junior, intermediate and senior levels. This arrangement continued until the GAA centenary year of '84 when Clonmore and Killea agreed to enter Junior and Intermediate competitions as single clubs but competed as one club at senior level, and it was {{under the name of}} JK <b>Brackens</b> that this group played as. The following year JK <b>Brackens</b> competed at Minor and Under 21 hurling only, however in ’86 and ‘87 the <b>Brackens</b> represented the parish at senior grade once more. A senior JK <b>Brackens</b> selection did not feature in 1988 as Clonmore had won promotion to senior ranks by virtue of winning the County Intermediate Huring Championship of 1987. Instead ‘The Brackens’ were represented at minor and under 21 grades only, and it was at these grades that JK <b>Brackens</b> claimed their first silverware, winning Mid Minor B and Mid Under 21 B hurling titles in 1989 and 1990 respectively.|$|R

25|$|On {{the opening}} drive of the game, Brunell led the Jaguars 73 yards in nine plays, {{featuring}} a 41-yard completion to Smith, {{and finished the}} drive with an 8-yard touchdown pass to Smith 4:28 into the game. After the ensuing kickoff, Jacksonville cornerback Aaron Beasley intercepted Marino's first pass {{of the game and}} returned it five yards to the Dolphins 41-yard line, setting a 45-yard field goal from Mike Hollis. Following a three-and-out for Miami, Tom Hutton's 57-yard punt pinned the Jaguars back at their own 9-yard line. But two plays later, Taylor took off down the right sideline for an NFL playoff record 90-yard touchdown run. Then on Miami's next possession, defensive end Tony <b>Brackens</b> forced a fumble from Marino and dove on the ball. With most players on both teams thinking he was down by contact, <b>Brackens</b> got up and started celebrating while the Dolphins offense walked off the field, but his teammate Bryce Paup realized that no one had touched <b>Brackens</b> and the play was still ongoing. He ran up to <b>Brackens,</b> shoved him in the back, and told him to start running, and <b>Brackens</b> ended up returning the ball 16 yards for a touchdown.|$|R
5|$|St. Elmo was a {{financial}} success, reported by The Photoplayers' Weekly as breaking box office records. The following year, Bertram <b>Bracken</b> directed a film adaptation of another Augusta Jane Evans novel, Beulah (1859), for Balboa. Though {{not directly related}} to St. Elmo, the 1915 Beulah film was marketed as a sequel. In 1923, Fox Film produced another adaptation of the novel, also titled St. Elmo, which was also a success.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{of the top}} AA pros, Stu Thomsen, Harry Leary, Greg Hill, Brent and Brian Patterson among them, {{met with}} ABA {{officials}} before the 1983 Winternationals to discuss the method of choosing the National number one pro for the year. Dissatisfied with the ABA's response, many pros, most notably Greg Hill, shunned the ABA circuit {{and focused on the}} NBL and third-party sanctioning bodies like the regional United Bicycle Racers (UBR) and the National Pedal Sport Association (NPSA). This tactic was not new to Mr. Hill. He led a one-man boycott of the ABA during the 1980 season in part due to Mennenga's perceived lack of concern for an allegedly unsafe number of racers at the starting gate of a national. Mennenga allegedly said to Mr. Hill that the [...] "...ABA doesn't cater to the Pros". Even Tommy <b>Brackens</b> who had a reputation of being low key and easy going had an alleged unpleasant run-in with the alleged intransigence of Merl Mennenga. During the 1982 Fall National in a semi moto race there was an exceedingly close finish for the fourth and last position to qualify for the main between <b>Brackens</b> and Jeff Kosmala at the finish line. Merl Mennenga called the race in Kosmala's favor and against <b>Brackens.</b> <b>Brackens</b> tried to make an official protest. Merl allegedly said check with the scorer as Mr. <b>Brackens</b> moved to do so. Larry Greer, the Race Director, allegedly threatened to have <b>Brackens</b> suspended for 30 days if he did not leave the track. Mennenga allegedly told <b>Brackens</b> shortly after {{that there would be no}} change in his call and whatever he says goes. Such was the relations Mennenga had with the Pros. Indeed, the ABA decided to reuse the same system it used in 1982 to decide the number one pro for 1983. As a result, many pros still feeling that they weren't being listen to stayed away from the ABA circuit and concentrated on the NBL and the NBA.|$|R
5|$|The hilltops {{are covered}} in {{heathland}} of gorse, heather, <b>bracken</b> and thorn with plantations of conifer. The {{western side of the}} Quantocks are steep scarp slopes of pasture, woods and parkland. Deep stream-cut combes to the north-east contain extensive oak-woods with small flower-rich bogs above them. The areas where there is limited drainage are dominated by heather (Calluna vulgaris), with significant populations of cross-leaved heath (Erica tetralix), purple moor-grass (Molinia caerulea), bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus) and wavy hair-grass (Deschampsia flexuosa). Drier areas are covered with bell heather (Erica cinerea), western gorse (Ulex gallii) and bristle bent (Agrostis curtisii), while <b>bracken</b> (Pteridium aquilinum) is common on well-drained deeper soils. The springs and streams provide a specialist environment that supports bog pimpernel (Anagallis tenella). The woodland is generally birch/sessile oak woodland, valley alder woodland and ash/wych elm woodland, which support a rich lichen flora. Alfoxton Wood is one of only three British locations where the lichen Tomasellia lectea is present.|$|E
5|$|The local Biodiversity Action Plan {{recommends}} {{land management}} measures {{to control the}} spread of ragwort and <b>bracken</b> and identifies four non-native, invasive species as threatening native biodiversity: Japanese knotweed, rhododendron, New Zealand flatworm and mink.

5|$|There {{are several}} bush {{remedies}} {{used to treat}} jack jumper stings (and any other Myrmecia sting).

The tips are rubbed on the stung area, and may relieve the local pain after getting stung. Another plant used as a bush remedy is Carpobrotus glaucescens (known as angular sea-fig or pigface).|$|E
