500|$|Thompson has {{rejected}} arguments that such video games {{are protected by}} freedom of expression, saying, [...] "Murder simulators are not constitutionally protected speech. They’re not even speech. They’re dangerous physical appliances that teach a kid how to kill efficiently and to love it," [...] as well as simply calling video games [...] "mental masturbation". In addition, he has attributed part of the impetus for violent games to the military, {{saying that it was}} looking [...] "for a way to disconnect in the soldier's mind the physical act of pulling the trigger from the awful reality that a life may end". Thompson further claims that some of these games are based on military training and simulation technologies, such as those being developed at the Institute for Creative Technologies, which, he suggests, were created by the Department of Defense to help overcome soldiers' inhibition to kill. He also claims that the PlayStation 2's DualShock controller [...] "gives you a pleasurable buzz <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>your</b> hands with each kill. This is operant conditioning, behavior modification right out of B. F. Skinner's laboratory." ...|$|E
500|$|Eileen Lulevitch, {{entertainment}} reviewer for TV Guide, {{was generally}} favorable of the episode, writing, [...] "Watching the season premiere tonight was like welcoming {{an old friend}} <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>your</b> home. It was so easy to slip back into Grey's world and {{get caught up in}} all of the amazing moments that make this show so much fun to watch. And while I expected the night to start off on a somber note, by addressing Cristina and Burke's fallout, I was pleasantly surprised by the way the attendees paid tribute to Bailey, by giving their new interns the same exact first-day speech Bailey had given them." [...] Lulevtich praised Meredith's story arc, noting the surprising turn her character evolution has taken, as she praised Lexie's introduction. While expressing a negative perspective on the writers' decision to have Torres be the Chief Resident, instead of Bailey, Lulevitch described Torres' adjustment to her new position as one of the episode's focal points. Despite praising Yang's storyline in the personal background, the concept of her interaction with the patient she was assigned to was regarded as predictable and obvious, [...] "When the man's family came to see him, and Cristina told them it could be for the very last time. It was that moment that really got Cristina thinking about how much she did in fact miss Burke, as we later learned in the episode." [...] Writing for IGN, Laura Burrows was favorable of the episode. Regarding the storylines developed in [...] "A Change Is Gonna Come", Burrows elaborated, [...] "The season opener was promising in that it had the interns in a new role and introduced a new side of George. As all of his friends progressed from interns to residents, George was forced to re-sit his internship. This created new drama and also opened up the hospital to {{a whole new set of}} interns rife with their own set of emotional baggage and drama. There were a series of interesting and new plots." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2003, MTV {{wrote that}} nu metal's {{mainstream}} popularity was declining, citing that Korn's fifth album Untouchables and Papa Roach's third album Lovehatetragedy both sold {{less than the}} bands' previous releases. Korn's lead vocalist Jonathan Davis blamed music piracy {{for the amount of}} sales of Untouchables because the album had been leaked to the Internet more than four months before its official release date. MTV also wrote that nu metal bands were played less frequently on radio stations and MTV began focusing other musical genres. MTV wrote that Papa Roach's third album Lovehatetragedy has less hip hop elements than the band's previous album Infest and also said that Saliva's 2002 album <b>Back</b> <b>into</b> <b>Your</b> System has less [...] elements than the band's 2001 album Every Six Seconds. MTV also wrote that Crazy Town's second album Darkhorse had no hit singles and sold less than the band's previous album The Gift of Game. MTV wrote that although Kid Rock's album Cocky had characteristics of the musician's 1998 album Devil Without a Cause, Cocky song [...] "Forever", which featured the style of Kid Rock's [...] song [...] "Bawitdaba", was not as popular as Cocky country song [...] "Picture". MTV also wrote, [...] "Another cause for nü-metal and rap-rock's slip from the spotlight could be a diluted talent pool caused by so many similar-sounding bands. American Head Charge, Primer 55, Adema, Cold, the Union Underground, Dope, Apartment 26, Hed (Planet Earth) and Skrape—all of whom released albums between 2000 and 2001—left more of a collective impression than individual ones".|$|E

50|$|A tubular grate heater is any grate or heat {{exchanger}} for a fireplace designed from metal tubing. Through the tubing is circulated home air that becomes heated by the fire. The air is then vented <b>back</b> <b>into</b> {{the room and}} home. It is a heat recovery device that improves the efficiency and ability of a fireplace to get {{the heat from the}} fire out and into the home. From simple to ornate, they can contribute significantly to the overall comfort of a room and potentially to a whole house. This in turn will reduce the amount of firewood needed to achieve the same comfort level, potentially reducing heating costs and expenses.Heaters increase the efficiency of a fireplace and hence the amount of heat that makes it from the fireplace out into the home. They work by having naturally convected and forced air funneled into the metal {{heat exchanger}} tubing that is then heated by the coals and/or fire. They draw in cold air from the floor and blow heated air <b>back</b> out <b>into</b> <b>your</b> home. This adds an element of conductive and convective heating to the radiant heat typical of a basic fireplace. Grate heaters have been called many things: heatilator, hearth heater, fireplace blower, fireplace grate heater, Fireplace Furnace, tubular grate heater, etc.|$|R

6000|$|Coming {{through the}} Dardanelles, we saw camel trains on shore with the glasses, {{but we were}} never close to one till we got to Smyrna. These camels are very {{much larger than the}} scrawny {{specimens}} one sees in the menagerie. They stride along these streets, in single file, a dozen in a train, with heavy loads on their backs, and a fancy-looking negro in Turkish costume, or an Arab, preceding them on a little donkey and completely overshadowed and rendered insignificant by the huge beasts. To see a camel train laden with the spices of Arabia and the rare fabrics of Persia come marching through the narrow alleys of the bazaar, among porters with their burdens, money-changers, lamp-merchants, Al-naschars in the glassware business, portly cross-legged Turks smoking the famous narghili; and the crowds drifting to and fro in the fanciful costumes of the East, is a genuine revelation of the Orient.

30|$|During {{the phase}} 2 trial, {{physicians}} {{were asked to}} complete the Physician Global Assessment (PGA) of disease activity ({{at the end of the}} baseline and treatment periods) using a visual analog scale (0 – 100  mm; ranging from no disease activity to worst possible disease activity) to provide a global assessment of EoE activity for each patient. Scores were categorized as follows: no disease to mild disease (0 – 30  mm); moderate disease (> 30 to ≤ 70  mm); and worst possible disease (> 70 to ≤ 100  mm). Patients {{were asked to complete}} the EoE Symptom Survey at the end of the baseline and treatment periods. The EoE Symptom Survey comprised a checklist of symptoms associated with EoE, and the options were phrased as follows: ‘heartburn (burning sensation in your chest)’; ‘chest pain (not heartburn or reflux related)’; ‘regurgitation (food coming <b>back</b> up <b>into</b> <b>your</b> mouth without vomiting/throwing up)’; ‘abdominal (stomach) pain’; ‘nausea (feeling sick to your stomach)’; and ‘vomiting (throwing up)’. Patients were asked to indicate, by ticking/checking, which symptoms they had experienced within the past 2  weeks. Patients were asked not to check symptoms that were unrelated to EoE. Patients were also asked to complete the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) survey at the end of the treatment period, in which they were asked to rate the change in their dysphagia symptoms from baseline. Responses were: much better; better; a little better; no change; a little worse; worse; or much worse. EoE is a relatively newly described disease [1], and as such has not yet been formally assigned disease severity classifications. The above analyses are a first attempt to classify EoE disease severity using dysphagia symptoms.|$|R
