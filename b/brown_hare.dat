25|$|Since human {{settlement}} many placental mammals {{have been introduced}} to Australia and are now feral. The first animal introduced to Australia was the dingo. Fossil evidence suggests that people from the north brought the dingo to Australia about 5000 years ago. When Europeans settled Australia they intentionally released many species into the wild including the red fox, <b>brown</b> <b>hare,</b> and the European rabbit. Other domestic species have escaped and over time have produced wild populations including the cat, fallow deer, red deer, sambar deer, rusa deer, chital, hog deer, horse, donkey, pig, goat, water buffalo, and the camel. Only three species of placental mammal were not deliberately introduced to Australia: the house mouse, black rat and the brown rat.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background In Europe the {{mountain}} hare (Lepus timidus) exists in Great Britain, Norway, Sweden, Finland, {{parts of the}} Alps and in Eastern Europe, but not in Denmark. Interspecific hybridization has been demonstrated between native Swedish mountain <b>hares</b> and introduced <b>brown</b> <b>hares</b> (Lepus europaeus). During the data collection in a study concerning Danish <b>brown</b> <b>hares</b> we identified 16 hares with a single very divergent haplotype. Results Phylogenetic analysis shows that the divergent Danish haplotype is most {{closely related to the}} Swedish mountain hare. The frequency of Lepus timidus mtDNA haplotype in the Eastern Danish hare populations is estimated to 6 %. Conclusion In contrast to what is known, the Danish hare populations are not pure L. europaeus populations but include introgressed <b>brown</b> <b>hares</b> with Swedish L. timidus mtDNA. The most probable explanation of this is natural migration or translocation of introgressed <b>brown</b> <b>hares</b> from Sweden. The impurity of hare populations has implications for conservation and population genetics. </p...|$|R

Important prey species include the {{mountain}} hare (Lepus timidus) (in the Scottish Highlands and the French Alps), the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) (in the Scottish Highlands, Sicily, the Apennine Mountains, Switzerland, Spain, the Central Massif of France and the French Alps, {{in the first two}} sites mentioned, the rabbit is invasive species introduced by humans), the <b>brown</b> <b>hare</b> (Lepus europaeus) (in Switzerland, the Apennine Mountains, the French Alps and Armenia), the Japanese hare (Lepus brachyurus) (in Japan), the Cape hare (Lepus capensis) (in Mali and Niger) and the Ethiopian highland hare (Lepus starcki) (in the Bale Mountains) In some areas leporids are secondary prey, such as Scandinavia, where the mountain hare comprised about 20% of prey items, the maximum known being 28.4% in Northern Finland. The Tolai hare (Lepus tolai) was a secondary prey item in Mongolia, making up around 21% of prey. The European rabbit appears to be secondary in Hungary, where it comprised 14.3%.|$|E

60|$|In reality, this {{universal}} sombre tint {{of desert}} animals {{is a beautiful}} example of the imperious working of our modern Deus ex machinâ, natural selection. The more uniform in hue is the environment of any particular region, the more uniform in hue must be all its inhabitants. In the arctic snows, for example, we find this principle pushed to its furthest logical conclusion. There, everything is and must be white--hares, foxes, and ptarmigans alike; {{and the reason is}} obvious--there can be no exception. Any brown or black or reddish animal who ventured north would at once render himself unpleasantly conspicuous {{in the midst of the}} uniform arctic whiteness. If he were a <b>brown</b> <b>hare,</b> for example, the foxes and bears and birds of prey of the district would spot him at once on the white fields, and pounce down upon him forthwith on his first appearance. That hare would leave no similar descendants to continue the race of brown hares in arctic regions after him. Or, suppose, on the other hand, it were a brown fox who invaded the domain of eternal snow. All the hares and ptarmigans of his new district would behold him coming from afar and keep well out of his way, while he, poor creature, would never be able to spot them at all among the white snow-fields. He would starve for want of prey, at the very time when the white fox, his neighbour, was stealing unperceived with stealthy tread upon the hares and ptarmigans. In this way, from generation to generation of arctic animals, the blacker or browner have been constantly weeded out, and the greyer and whiter have been constantly encouraged, till now all arctic animals alike are as spotlessly snowy as the snow around them.|$|E

40|$|Hares (Lepus capensis Linnaeus 1758) were {{probably}} introduced into Sardinia in historical times. Previous studies indicated North Africa {{as the most}} likely source area but did not exclude the occurrence of hybridization events with continental <b>brown</b> <b>hares</b> (L. europaeus Pallas 1778) perhaps introduced for hunting purposes. We implemented both morphometric and genetic approaches to verify the genetic isolation of the Sardinian population. Specifically, we conducted a multivariate analysis of craniometric data and analysed 461 bp of the mitochondrial control region and 12 autosomal microsatellites in Sardinian hares, using North African cape <b>hares</b> and European <b>brown</b> <b>hares</b> as reference populations. Sardinian hares displayed a peculiar skull shape. In agreement, both nuclear and mitochondrial markers remarked the distinctiveness of this population. Observed and expected heterozygosity were 0. 52 and 0. 61, while haplotype and nucleotide diversity were 0. 822 and 0. 0129. Selfassignment based on Bayesian cluster analysis was high (average membership 0. 98), and no evident signs of introgression from continental <b>brown</b> <b>hares</b> were found. Our results {{support the hypothesis that}} the Sardinian hares have been introduced from North Africa, remained genetically isolated since the founding event and evolved independently from the source population. This long-lasting isolation and the consequent genetic drift resulted in a differentiation, perhaps accompanied by an adaptation to local environmental conditions...|$|R

Trichophyton terrestre (2. 1 %), Chrysosporium sp, Chrysosporium keratinophilum, Microsporum gypseum, Trichophyton gloriae and Trichophyton mentagrophytes (0. 6 % each), Trichophyton erinacei and Scopulariopsis brevicaulis (0. 4 % each), Chrysosporium asperatum (0. 3 %), Arthroderma sp and Microsporum canis (0. 1 % each) {{were identified in}} cultures with single isolates, whereas Chrysosporium sp/T. mentagrophytes (0. 3 %), Chrysosporium sp/T. terrestre and M. gypseum/T. terrestre (0. 2 % each), Chrysosporium tropicum/T. terrestre, M. canis/T. terrestre and T. ajelloi/T. terrestre (0. 1 % each) were identified in cultures with mixed isolates. T. erinacei and M. canis have not previously been isolated from hares. M. canis, T. erinacei and T. mentagrophytes were the most clinically important dermatophytes found. Altogether, they were isolated only from 1. 5 % hair samples. Thus, it is concluded that <b>brown</b> <b>hares</b> may play a limited epidemiological role as carriers of zoonotic dermatophytes.
