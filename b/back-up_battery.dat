50|$|A {{security}} weakness on {{the rural}} Strowger exchanges (UAX 13s and smaller) {{had been the}} electrical power supply.

50|$|Immediately {{after the}} Fukushima accident, European politicians, {{representatives of the}} nuclear {{industry}} and regulatory bodies agreed on the undertaking of power-plant safety reviews. All 15 member states of the EU operating nuclear power plants were involved. The testing of the two Bohunice NPP V2 units and all four Mochovce NPP units was carried out mainly through engineering analyses, calculations and reports.Stress tests analysed extraordinary external events - earthquakes, floods, and impacts of other events that might result in the multiple loss of power-plant safety functions. The combination of events, including loss of power supply, long-term water supply breakdown, as well as loss of power supply due to extreme climate conditions were also assessed.Stress tests revealed no deficiencies requiring immediate action; the further safe operation of neither the operating units nor the units under construction was put in doubt.

As Astro and the flight crew prepare to depart, Astro Girl hides on board, with Dr. I.Q. Plenty and Spud doing the same. Dr. Boynton appears one last time and gives Astro a special <b>back-up</b> <b>battery</b> cell, but warns Astro not to let it overload. While in space, the ship is attacked by a grotesque monster, and crashes on the planet of the Cybots. Astro and the crew are dragged to the palace of King Cosmo, the leader of the Cybots.

40|$|AbstractThe three {{components}} of the Novacor left ventricular assist system, compact controller, battery, and <b>back-up</b> <b>battery,</b> have been miniaturized {{in the development of}} the wearable system. Therefore patients can be fully mobilized receiving mechanical circulatory support while awaiting heart transplantation. Between February 1992 and April 1994 a total of eight patients with decompensated heart failure (6 dilated cardiomyopathy, 1 acute myocarditis, 1 ischemic cardiomyopathy) were treated with the Novacor left ventricular assist system. In the most recent four cases the wearable system (N 100 P) was used. Patients' ages ranged from 17 to 49 years. In five patients severe failure of the right side of the heart was present at the time of implantation. Hemodynamic stabilization was achieved in all patients during the 2 to 122 days (mean 30. 8 ± 42. 5 days) of support. The following parameters were measured on average before and 24 hours after implantation of the left ventricular assist system: mean arterial pressure 70 ± 11 versus 87 ± 13 mm Hg (p < 0. 05), cardiac index 1. 71 ± 0. 42 versus 3. 23 ± 0. 74 L/min/m 2 (p < 0. 05), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 27. 1 ± 4. 4 versus 9. 9 ± 5. 2 mm Hg (p < 0. 01), mean pulmonary pressure 41 ± 9 versus 27 ± 6 mm Hg (p < 0. 05), and right ventricular ejection fraction 16. 7 % ± 10. 3 % versus 22. 0 % ± 11. 6 % (not significant). Patients who received the wearable system were capable of managing their own power supply during the bridging period and were able to walk to the hospital park and shopping area. One patient had a serious pulmonary infection, which was treated successfully, and two patients had a cerebrovascular accident, which resolved in one and resulted in a minor residual deficit in the other. All eight patients received a heart transplant. One patient died early after transplantation and seven patients are alive and well. In summary, the wearable Novacor left ventricular assist system provides major advantages regarding quality of life of patients during mechanical circulatory support. However, there is a remaining risk of thromboembolism despite anticoagulation therapy. (J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 1995; 109 : 74 - 80...|$|E

40|$|Electrical failure during {{cardiopulmonary}} bypass (CPB) {{has previously}} been reported to occur in 1 of every 1500 cases. Most heart-lung machine pump consoles are equipped with built-in <b>battery</b> <b>back-up</b> units. <b>Battery</b> run times of these devices are variable and have not been reported. Different conditions of use can extend battery life {{in the event of}} electrical failure. This study was designed to examine the run time of a fully charged battery under various conditions of pump speed, pressure loads, pump boot material, multiple pump usage, and battery life. Battery life using a centrifugal pump also was examined. The results of this study show that battery life is affected by pump speed, circuit pressure, boot stiffness, and the number of pumps in service. Centrifugal pumps also show a reduced drain on battery when compared with roller pumps. These elements affect the longevity and performance of the battery. This information could be of value to the individual during power failure as these are variables that can affect the battery life during such a challenging scenario...|$|R
40|$|Fuel cells (FCs) are a {{promising}} alternative energy solution and a reliable technology for niche applications providing high conversion efficiency. FCs are generally classified {{according to the}} type of the electrolyte. Proton exchange membrane FCs (PEMFCs) combine the hydrogen fuel with the oxygen from the atmosphere to produce water, heat (at temperature up to 90 °C) and electricity. The major advantages of the PEMFCs include: being environmentally friendly, offering high efficiency and low operating temperature while providing increased safety. When low-voltage unregulated FC output is conditioned to generate AC power, two stages are generally required: a boost stage and an inversion one. However, due to the cascaded power stage conventional two-stage FC systems have unavoidable drawbacks such as being bulky, inefficient and having a high cost. Moreover, FC systems require an auxiliary unit to improve efficiency, lifetime and safety by cancelling the ripple current and supporting its slow dynamics. In this thesis, single-stage FC systems are reported to overcome the disadvantages of the conventional FC systems caused by cascaded power stages. The proposed FC systems provide high power conversion efficiency, low-cost and compactness for standalone and grid connected applications in single- and three-phase systems. Analysis, simulation and experimental results taken from 1 kW laboratory prototypes operating at 20 kHz are presented to validate the performance of the proposed FC systems. Single conversion stage FC systems based on the boost-inverter and buck-boost inverter with a back-up energy storage unit have been developed in this research as follows: &# 149; A single power stage FC system based on a boost-inverter with a <b>battery</b> <b>back-up</b> unit &# 149; A grid-connected FC system based on a boost-inverter with a <b>battery</b> <b>back-up</b> unit &# 149; A single conversion stage FC system based on a buck-boost inverter with a <b>battery</b> <b>back-up</b> unit &# 149; A single conversion stage three-phase FC system based on a boost-inverter with a <b>battery</b> <b>back-up</b> unit &# 149; Design and implementation of digital control as implemented in an FC energy system The proposed FC systems has achieved satisfactory performance for delivering boosting and inversion functions within the single power conversion offering high efficiency and compactness. Moreover, an integrated <b>battery</b> <b>back-up</b> energy storage unit has also performed two functions: providing the ramping operation to deal with the slow dynamics of the FC and eliminating the ripple current to increase the efficiency and life time of the FC...|$|R

50|$|High-end {{hardware}} disk controllers of {{the type}} found in servers include a small <b>battery</b> <b>back-up</b> unit on their cache memory {{so that they may}} offer the performance gains of write caching while mitigating the risk of unintended shutdowns. The <b>battery</b> <b>back-up</b> unit keeps the memory powered even during a shutdown so that when the computer is powered back up, it can quickly complete any writes it has previously committed. With such a controller, the operating system may request four writes (1-2-3-4) in that order, but the controller may decide the quickest way to write them is 4-3-1-2. The controller essentially lies to the operating system and reports that the writes have been completed in order (a lie that improves performance at the expense of data corruption if power is lost), and the battery backup hedges against the risk of data corruption by giving the controller a way to silently fix any and all damage that could occur as a result.|$|R

40|$|This thesis studies two {{different}} methods of harvesting electrical energy from everyday {{activities such as}} walking and running. It is a design study that aims to create a device which can be attached or incorporated into a shoe, ideally a military boot, so that soldiers can charge <b>back-up</b> <b>batteries</b> for their devices while out in the field. The goal {{was to create a}} device that could achieve a peak energy harvesting power output on the order of 0. 1 Watts. The original concept for the device involved the use of macro piezoelectric fiber harvesters which harness strain energy from the sole of the shoe as it naturally bends and flexes throughout daily activity. Strain testing indicated the the maximum peak power output that could be expected from these actuators was on the order of 10 - 4 W to 10 - 3 W, and testing of the harvesters themselves yielded peak power values on the order of 10 7 W to 10 - 6 W. These low power values turned the design study away from the use of piezoelectrics and a design incorporating a miniature air turbine coupled with an electromagnetic generator was introduced. Initial testing on this proof of concept device yielded peak power values on the order of 10 - 4 W to 10 - 3 W with much room for improvement. It was concluded that this sort of device would be more effective for harvesting energy from the shoes, and future iterations of the initial prototype were proposed. by Kelsey C. Seto. Thesis: S.
