30|$|The {{mechanical}} properties of 613 small clear specimens of 35 species (11 ring-porous hardwoods, 19 diffuse-porous hardwoods, and 5 softwoods) were evaluated. The {{aim of the}} study was to examine indexes of wood quality that are easy to measure and that exhibit a high correlation with bending performance and hardness that are essential properties of hardwood products. The modulus of rigidity, dynamic modulus of elasticity, bending properties (modulus of elasticity, modulus of rupture, stress at the proportional limit, absorbed energy, Tetmajer’s modulus), dynamic energy absorption by an impact bending test, compressive strength parallel to the grain, shear strength, partial bearing strength, and <b>Brinell’s</b> <b>hardness</b> were measured. A high correlation was found between dynamic modulus of elasticity and static modulus of elasticity. Bending stress at the proportional limit was found to be approximately equivalent to the compressive strength parallel to the grain. Static energy absorption correlated with dynamic energy absorption. Tetmajer’s modulus was found to be closely related to the ratio of the initial stiffness within the elastic range to the secant modulus at the maximum load. A high correlation was observed between <b>Brinell’s</b> <b>hardness</b> and partial bearing strength. The difference in the regression coefficients obtained for these correlations between the species groups was small.|$|R

40|$|AbstractA new {{formulation}} for elastic-perfectly plastic {{contact in}} the normal direction between two round surfaces that is solely based on material properties and contact geometries is developed. The problem is formulated as three separate domains: the elastic regime, mixed elastic–plastic behavior, and unconstrained (fully plastic) flow. Solutions for the force–displacement relationship in the elastic regime follow from Hertz’s classical solution. In the fully plastic regime, two well supported assumptions are made: {{that there is a}} uniform pressure distribution and there is a linear force–deflection relationship. The force–displacement relationship in the intermediate, mixed elastic–plastic regime is approximated by enforcing continuity between the elastic and fully plastic regimes. Transitions between the three regimes are determined based on empirical quantities: the von Mises yield criterion is used to determine the initiation of mixed elastic–plastic deformation, and <b>Brinell’s</b> <b>hardness</b> for the onset of unconstrained flow. Unloading from each of these three regimes is modeled as an elastic process with different radii of curvature based on the regime in which the maximum force occurred. Simulation results explore the relationship between the impact velocity and coefficient of restitution. Further comparisons are made between the model, experimental results found in the literature, and other existing elastic–plastic models. The new model is well supported by the experimental measurements of compliance curves for elastic–plastic materials and of coefficients of restitution from impact studies, and in elastic-perfectly plastic regimes is demonstrated to be more accurate than existing models found in the literature...|$|R
40|$|The {{accurate}} 3 D {{finite element}} simulation of the Friction Stir Welding (FSW) process requires a proper knowledge of both material and interface behaviors, but friction, the key phenomenon of this process, is quite difficult to model and identify. Friction stir welding {{is a relatively}} new welding process, that has significant advantages compared to the fusion process such as joining conventionally non-fusion weldable alloys. Being a solid-state joining process it produces weld with reduced distortion and improved mechanical properties. The aluminum alloys are widely used in different industrial applications such as ship building, aerospace and automobile industries due to their light weight, good mechanical strength and high corrosion resistance. A three dimensional finite element model is developed to study the thermal history in the butt welding of 6061 aluminum alloy using ANSYS package. Solid 70 elements are used to develop the model. The heat source incorporated in the model involves the friction among the material, probe and shoulder. In this work, a moving co-ordinate has been introduced to model the threedimensional heat transfer process because it reduces the difficulty of modeling the moving tool. In this model the main parameter considered is the heat input from the tool shoulder and tool pin. The temperature distributions of the weld at various welding speeds are obtained. The friction stir welding experiments are carried out at a transverse speed of 0. 75 mm/sec of tool. <b>Brinell’s</b> <b>Hardness</b> test, tensile test and micro structure analysis are performed on the welded material...|$|R
