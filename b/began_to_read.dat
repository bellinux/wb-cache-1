5|$|That autumn Hogg {{visited the}} couple in Edinburgh, which he greatly enjoyed. Hogg soon became very {{attracted}} to Harriet, and often spent time alone with her whenever Percy asked to write in solitude. Hogg eventually told Harriet of his feelings towards her, but she politely rebuffed him, and <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> novels with moral themes aloud in his presence.|$|E
5|$|After graduating, Deady began {{teaching}} {{to pay off}} a debt incurred for his education, and <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> law. He read law in St. Clairsville, Ohio, {{under the guidance of}} judge and former Congressman William Kennon. Deady passed the Ohio bar on October 26, 1847, and began practicing law in St. Clairsville at the office of Henry Kennon. He remained there until on April 17, 1849, he began his overland journey over the Oregon Trail to the newly created Oregon Territory.|$|E

5|$|As he <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> up on {{the written}} {{accounts}} of cultural cannibalism, {{he was struck by}} inconsistencies and other problems in these tales. In search of reliable accounts from anthropologists who had witnessed the practice of cultural cannibalism first-hand, he placed an advertisement in the newsletter of the American Anthropological Association, but again failed to come up with any first-hand documented cases. Prior to its publication, rumors had circulated in the anthropological community that Arens was putting together a book that would challenge the concept of cultural cannibalism.|$|E
5|$|I {{should say}} I {{wanted to write}} poetry in the {{beginning}} because I {{had fallen in love}} with words. The first poems I knew were nursery rhymes and before I could read them for myself I had come to love the words of them. The words alone. What the words stood for was of a very secondary importance... I fell in love, that is the only expression I can think of, at once, and am still at the mercy of words, though sometimes now, knowing a little of their behaviour very well, I think I can influence them slightly and have even learned to beat them now and then, which they appear to enjoy. I tumbled for words at once. And, when I <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> the nursery rhymes for myself, and, later, to read other verses and ballads, I knew that I had discovered the most important things, to me, that could be ever.|$|E
5|$|Tucker {{was educated}} in Bermuda {{primarily}} by a tutor engaged from Great Britain {{and also by}} Josiah Meigs. His assigned reading included Tom Jones, The Vicar of Wakefield, and Arabian Nights, among the mainstays of an education on the American continent. At age fifteen he helped form a literary club, the Calliopean Society; Meigs later became a professor and reprised {{the name of the}} club at Yale. Tucker at age 16 <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> the law under a successful and prosperous lawyer, George Bascomb. At Bascomb's death, the firm's clients urged Tucker to assume their representation, but feeling quite unqualified, he declined, deciding to begin plans for a career in the United States.|$|E

5|$|Cleveland {{received}} his elementary {{education at the}} Fayetteville Academy and the Clinton Liberal Academy. After his father died in 1853, he again left school so as to help support his family. Later that year, Cleveland's brother William {{was hired as a}} teacher at the New York Institute for the Blind in New York City, and William obtained a place for Cleveland as an assistant teacher. He returned home to Holland Patent at the end of 1854, where an elder in his church offered to pay for his college education if he would promise to become a minister. Cleveland declined, and in 1855 he decided to move west. He stopped first in Buffalo, New York, where his uncle, Lewis F. Allen, gave him a clerical job. Allen was an important man in Buffalo, and he introduced his nephew to influential men there, including the partners in the law firm of Rogers, Bowen, and Rogers. Millard Fillmore, the 13th President of the United States, had previously worked for the partnership. Cleveland later took a clerkship with the firm, <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> the law, and was admitted to the New York bar in 1859.|$|E
5|$|On 1 January 1519, Zwingli {{gave his}} first sermon in Zurich. Deviating from the {{prevalent}} practice of basing a {{sermon on the}} Gospel lesson of a particular Sunday, Zwingli, using Erasmus' New Testament as a guide, <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> through the Gospel of Matthew, giving his interpretation during the sermon, known as the method of lectio continua. He continued to read and interpret the book on subsequent Sundays {{until he reached the}} end and then proceeded in the same manner with the Acts of the Apostles, the New Testament epistles, and finally the Old Testament. His motives for doing this are not clear, but in his sermons he used exhortation to achieve moral and ecclesiastical improvement which were goals comparable with Erasmian reform. Sometime after 1520, Zwingli's theological model began to evolve into an idiosyncratic form that was neither Erasmian nor Lutheran. Scholars do not agree on the process of how he developed his own unique model. One view is that Zwingli was trained as an Erasmian humanist and Luther played a decisive role in changing his theology. Another view is that Zwingli did not pay much attention to Luther's theology and in fact he considered it as part of the humanist reform movement. A third view is that Zwingli was not a complete follower of Erasmus, but had diverged from him as early as 1516 and that he independently developed his theology.|$|E

25|$|Chávez later {{moved to}} the larger town of Barinas, where he {{attended}} high school at the Daniel Florencio O'Leary School. Throughout his high school years, Chávez's best friends were two brothers who were the sons of Jose Ruiz, a communist who had been incarcerated {{by the government of}} military dictator Marcos Pérez Jiménez. In the library of the Ruiz family, Chávez first <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> books dealing with communism and socialism. Later, at the age of seventeen, Chávez joined the Venezuelan armed forces. He later recalled that he joined so that he would be eligible to play in the military baseball leagues. He subsequently enrolled in 1971 as a fourth class cadet of the then Military Academy of Venezuela.|$|E

25|$|His {{father gave}} up {{practicing}} law {{due to the}} failing eyesight that would eventually afflict his son. In 1914, {{the family moved to}} Geneva, Switzerland, and spent the next decade in Europe. Borges Haslam was treated by a Geneva eye specialist, while Jorge Luis and his sister Norah attended school; there Jorge Luis learned French. He read Thomas Carlyle in English, and he <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> philosophy in German. In 1917, when he was eighteen, he met the writer Maurice Abramowicz and began a literary friendship that would last {{for the rest of his}} life. He received his baccalauréat from the Collège de Genève in 1918. The Borges family decided that, due to political unrest in Argentina, they would remain in Switzerland during the war, staying until 1921. After World War I, the family spent three years living in various cities: Lugano, Barcelona, Majorca, Seville, and Madrid.|$|E
25|$|Zhou's diaries {{and letters}} from {{his time in}} Tokyo show a deep {{interest}} in politics and current events, in particular, the Russian Revolution of 1917 and the Bolsheviks' new policies. He <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> avidly Chen Duxiu's progressive and left-leaning magazine, New Youth. He probably read some early Japanese works on Marx, {{and it has been}} claimed that he even attended Kawakami Hajime's lectures at Kyoto University. Kawakami was an important figure in the early history of Japanese Marxism, and his translations and articles influenced a generation of Chinese communists. However, it now seems unlikely that Zhou met him or heard any of his lectures. Zhou's diaries also show his concern over Chinese student strikes in Japan in May 1918, when the Chinese government failed to send the students' scholarships, but he apparently was not deeply involved in the protest. His active role in political movements began after his return to China.|$|E
25|$|The Ninth Session {{was held}} on Friday, 17 May, at which it was decreed that anyone could leave the Obedience of Gregory or the Obedience of Benedict without penalty, but that those who {{positively}} refused to leave would be permanently punished. The Tenth Session took place on Tuesday 22 May, at which a petition was presented to send an embassay to Genoa to engage in negotiations. The two contending parties, Benedict and Gregory, were summoned once again at {{the doors of the}} Cathedral by two cardinals. A petition was presented to certify that the two cardinals had carried out the summons. A Notary <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> the articles which were being proffered against the two popes, first in general terms and then in detail, citing witnesses and documents. These were produced by the Bishop of Pisa, Alamanno Adimari. Twenty articles were read and accepted before the time for the day's sitting elapsed. The reading and the presentation of witnesses and proofs continued at the Eleventh Session on 23 May.|$|E

25|$|At {{the age of}} fifteen, Wheatstone {{translated}} French poetry, {{and wrote}} two songs, {{one of which was}} given to his uncle, who published it without knowing it as his nephew's composition. Some lines of his on the lyre became the motto of an engraving by Bartolozzi. Small for his age, but with a fine brow, and intelligent blue eyes, he often visited an old book-stall in the vicinity of Pall Mall, which was then a dilapidated and unpaved thoroughfare. Most of his pocket-money was spent in purchasing the books which had taken his fancy, whether fairy tales, history, or science. One day, to the surprise of the bookseller, he coveted a volume on the discoveries of Volta in electricity, but not having the price, he saved his pennies and secured the volume. It was written in French, and so he was obliged to save again, until he could buy a dictionary. Then he <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> the volume, and, {{with the help of his}} elder brother, William, to repeat the experiments described in it, with a home-made battery, in the scullery behind his father's house. In constructing the battery, the boy philosophers ran short of money to procure the requisite copper-plates. They had only a few copper coins left. A happy thought occurred to Charles, who was the leading spirit in these researches, 'We must use the pennies themselves,' said he, and the battery was soon complete.|$|E
