40|$|A new {{stochastic}} brand choice model, the <b>Bargain</b> <b>Value</b> Model, is introduced. Using {{consumer panel}} data, the model predicts an individual household's probability of purchasing various brands {{as a function}} of the prevailing price of those brands. Based on consumer behavior constructs, the model differs sharply from the Linear Learning Model in its behavioral interpretation. This difference leads the models to have divergent managerial policy implications. After describing the <b>Bargain</b> <b>Value</b> Model, the differences between the models are explored along with some empirical results. marketing: advertising/promotion, marketing: buyer behavior, marketing: pricing...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the following issue: If {{a set of}} agents bargain {{on a set of}} feasible alternatives 'in the shadow' of a voting rule, that is, any agreement can be enforced if a 'winning coalition' supports it, what general agreements are likely to arise? In other words: What influence can the voting rule used to settle (possibly non-unanimous) agreements have on the outcome of negotiations? To give an answer we model the situation {{as an extension of the}} Nash bargaining problem in which an arbitrary voting rule replaces unanimity to settle agreements by n players. This provides a setting in which a natural extension of Nash's solution is obtained axiomatically. Two extensions admitting randomization on voting rules based on two informational scenarios are considered. <b>Bargaining,</b> voting, <b>value,</b> <b>bargaining</b> in committees. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{distributed}} beamforming {{algorithm is}} proposed for the two-user multiple-input single-output (MISO) interference channel (IFC). The algorithm is iterative and uses as <b>bargaining</b> <b>value</b> the interference that each transmitter generates towards the receiver of the other user. It enables cooperation among the transmitters {{in order to increase}} both users’ rates by lowering the overall interference. In every iteration, as long as both rates keep on increasing, the transmitters mutually decrease the generated interference. They choose their beamforming vectors distributively, solving the constrained optimization problem of maximizing the useful signal power for a given level of generated interference. The algorithm is equally applicable when the transmitters have either instantaneous or statistical channel state information (CSI). The difference is that the core optimization problem is solved in closed-form for instantaneous CSI, whereas for statistical CSI an efficient solution is found numerically via semidefinite programming. The outcome of the proposed algorithm is approximately Pareto-optimal. Extensive numerical illustrations are provided, comparing the proposed solution to the Nash equilibrium, zero-forcing, Nash bargaining, and maximum sum-rate operating points. © 2009 IEEE.

Within this framework we propose a new value that extends the Shapley value to partition function form games, the so-called Rational Belief Shapley (RBS) value. We investigate the strategic {{foundation of the}} RBS value by constructing an implementation mechanism. This mechanism extends existing models of multilateral bargaining by allowing players {{a higher degree of}} freedom to form coalitions. The same framework of bidding and renegotiation allows for natural variations of the RBS-mechanism. In this way, alternative “Shapley-like” values are obtained, and a unified platform to analyze and compare these solutions is provided...|$|R

30|$|The {{approaches}} in [6 – 14] {{are based on}} a well-known game theory. The characterizations of achievable rate region and existence of a unique Nash equilibrium have been provided in [6]. Cooperative beamforming vectors are determined by utilizing the two extreme solutions as the basis, i.e., egoistic beamforming and altruistic beamforming. A simple linear-type combination of egoistic beamforming and altruistic beamforming has been shown to achieve Pareto optimality in multiple-input single-output (MISO) systems [7]. The extension to a general K-user case has been derived in [8, 9]. For the case when the partial CSI is available at the transmitter, Pareto optimality of MISO system has been shown in [10]. The analysis based on competitive market, called Walrasian market, has been studied in [11]. The ICI links and beamforming vectors are considered consumers and goods, respectively. Then, the arbitrator coordinates the transmission strategies for achieving the Pareto optimal Walrasian equilibrium. In [12], a beamforming scheme that uses the generated interference level as a <b>bargaining</b> <b>value</b> has been proposed, where both of instantaneous and statistical CSI are considered. The non-strict Pareto boundary of two-user MIMO scenario has been derived in [13]. It has solved a non-convex problem with rate constraints and an extended K-user MIMO system. The second-order cone programming (SOCP) convex problem has been solved for Pareto optimal points in the achievable rate region of MISO systems in [14]. It has been shown to achieved Pareto optimality in M cell MISO systems. Unfortunately, the aforementioned cooperative beamformings require iterative update procedures to compute cooperative beamforming vectors. Each BS has to recompute new beamforming vectors whenever channel conditions are changed. Thus, this type of approaches typically leads to high computational burden for practical implementations.|$|R

40|$|This paper studies a {{bargaining}} {{model in which}} the seller is uncertain about which distribution the buyer's values are drawn from. The distribution of the buyer's values is fixed across periods, while the buyer’s values are drawn independently from the distribution each period. In the classical model of repeated bargaining where the buyer’s value is drawn from a commonly known distribution and fixed across periods, the high-value buyer has a strong incentive to conceal his value, and the seller loses most of her bargaining power. An important question is whether adding a layer of uncertainty makes the high-value buyer more willing to accept high-price offers and improves the seller’s revenue. We find {{this to be the}} case as long as the seller’s ex ante beliefs are sufficiently optimistic.

40|$|We {{investigate}} a common <b>value</b> bilateral <b>bargaining</b> model with two-sided private information and no aggregate uncertainty. A seller owns an asset whose common valuation is a deterministic {{function of the}} two traders' private signals. We first establish a no-trade theorem for this environment, and proceed to study {{the effect of the}} asset valuation structure and the trading mechanism on extent to which asymmetric information induces individuals to engage in mutually unprofitable exchange. A laboratory experiment is conducted, where trade is found to occur between 19 % and 35 % of the time, and this depends in systematic ways on both the asset valuation function and the trading mechanism. Both buyers and sellers adapt their strategy to changes in the asset valuation function and to changes in the trading mechanism in clearly identifiable ways. An equilibrium model with naïve belief formation accounts for some of the behavioral findings, but open questions remain.

In these years, the IWFP methodology only takes into account the non-zero spike that is more significant in the range of the estimated expected inflation rate.
