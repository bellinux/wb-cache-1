At {{the centre of}} it, a cubature rule for integrals with Chebyshev weight function is needed. We introduce so called Chebyshev lattices as a generalising framework for the multitude of point sets that have been discussed in this context. This framework provides a uniform notation that extends easily to higher dimensions. In this paper we describe many known point sets as Chebyshev lattices. In the introduction we briefly explain how convergence results from hyperinter- polation {{can be used in}} this context. After introducing Chebyshev lattices and the associated cubature rules, we show how most of the two- and three-dimensional point sets in this context can be described with this notation.

40|$|In {{the first}} part, we detail our {{attempts}} {{to improve the}} particle filter performance by replacing pseudo-random numbers by quasi-random point sets. It is known from quasi-Monte Carlo techniques that these point sets provide a better rate of convergence {{in the context of}} numerical integration, however, our experiments did not reveal the same superiority. We extend the Kullback-Leibler divergence to the weighted particle sets that are typically used in particle filters. This did not meet our criteria for a quality measure and so the error on the weighted average has been used. The experiments rely on the BFL library, that has been extended with an object-oriented design for quasi-random point sets {{in the course of this}} research. The second part presents the Chebyshev lattice rules as generalising framework for cubature with Chebyshev weight function and shows how most of the well known point sets in this context fit in the framework. We then developed exhaustive computer searches for good Chebyshev lattice rules. This provided evidence that the <b>blending</b> <b>formulae</b> due to Godzina are the best, i. e., require the lowest number of function evaluations needed to ensure exactness for polynomials up to a certain total degree. Based on hyperinterpolation theory, these Chebyshev lattice rules can be used to approximate multivariate functions by means of a sum of Chebyshev polynomials. For rank- 1 Chebyshev lattices and Godzina's <b>blending</b> <b>formulae,</b> we developed efficient approximation algorithms that benefit from the fast Fourier transform (FFT) by reformulating the approximation as discrete cosine transforms. All this is combined into CHEBINT, an end-user-friendly MATLAB/Octave toolbox, which also provides semi-numerical manipulations of Chebyshev approximations. A third part focusses on software: after an exercise to create an error handling paradigm for Fortran 2003 that is suitable for numerical and scientific software, we detail the developments in the context of CUBPACK.

Each {{of the two countries}} depends heavily on milling-wheat imports since there is very little domestic wheat production. Canadian wheat exports represent only a small share of South Korean wheat imports and about 25 percent of the wheat imported by Japan. The South Korean wheat import market was deregulated in 1990. The liberalization of wheat imports and deregulation of the Korean milling sector have intensified competition in the flour milling industries in that market. Individual millers are interested in developing new <b>blending</b> <b>formulae</b> for wheat flour in order to survive in a more competitive market environment.

South Korea provides a case study of changes that may occur in wheat demand as Japan deregulates its wheat import market. The comparison of the markets for noodle flour in these two Asian nations is highly relevant to the ongoing debate about Canadian domestic policies for wheat breeding, exports and grain regulation.

The chemical composition of C-S-H could not be determined by SEM-EDX because of intermixing with other phases; TEM-EDX was necessary. Inner product C-S-H morphology was fine and homogeneous and that of outer product C-S-H was fibrillar in the water activated systems and foil-like with alkali activation. Fly ash replacement did not change the morphology of lp and Op C-S-H. Small fully hydrated cement and PFA particles were filled with a less dense lp C-S-H with morphology very similar to the foil-like one. TEM-EDX showed that, in general, the mean Ca/(AI+Si) atomic ratio was lower in the water activated blends than that in the neat cement pastes due to the fly ash reaction. The composition- structure data were discussed in terms of models for the nanostructure of C-S-H. Higher curing temperature accelerated the rate of the cement hydration. The mean length of the aluminosilicate of the C-S-H anions was much higher than that of C-S-H formed at lower temperatures, and it was also higher in the blended pastes than with neat cement. Backscattered electron images showed that the grey level of C-S-H in the systems cured at 55 T and 85 T was in places quite similar to that of the calcium hydroxide: that is, it was brighter than in pastes cured at lower temperature. SEM also showed that the microstructure of the systems cured at higher temperature exhibited non uniform porosity. Inner product C-S-H with a fine scale, homogeneous morphology, was abundant in all systems cured at 55 'C and 85 'C. Op C-S-H was generally fibrillar with Nvater, and foil-like with alkali. However, the higher temperature curing did result in coarser fibrillar morphology (water activated systems) than that formed at lower temperatures. The C-S-H gel formed in the commercial WPC- 30 % PFA blended paste hydrated for one year at 25 'C and water leached for twelve weeks was also characterised in this work. A matrix effect was clearly observed by 29 Si MAS NMR. Cross-linking of the aluminosilicate anion structure of C-S-H occurred after leaching the sample for four weeks. Formulae were also presented for the average structural units in the C-S-H present in the unleached and four weeks water leached systems analysed by TEM-EDX. lp C-S-H morphology was fine and homogeneous and Op C-S-H had fibrillar morphology. There were many areas in the microstructure of the leached sample where Op C-S-H with foil-like morphology coexisted with fibrillar Op C-S-H.
