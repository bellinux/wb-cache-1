I {{must tell}} you, you know, as a friend, you'd {{better not be}} meddling with such notions; they are bad, George, very <b>bad,</b> <b>for</b> boys in <b>your</b> condition,--very;" [...] and Mr. Wilson sat down to a table, and began nervously chewing the handle of his umbrella.|$|R

I don't say he's such a bad man as I have fancied--I pray to God he is not.

[...] Then you say: [...] "There is no caste when men go to--look for tarkeean." [...] You stop a little between those words, [...] "to--look". That is thee whole secret.

You knew where you were with those fellows; it was five-and-twenty per cent, off wages and very <b>bad</b> stuff <b>for</b> <b>your</b> money. But as for Shuffle and Screw, what with their fines and their keys, a man never knows {{what he has to}} spend.

6000|$|... "I--reckon," [...] he replied, {{swallowing}} hard. [...] "My Gawd! {{you poor}} little girl! With that gang after you! An' Stanton! I see all now....

6000|$|... "All {{this is a}} very <b>bad</b> {{preparation}} <b>for</b> <b>your</b> future {{career as}} a respectable trader, and I am most annoyed to hear that you will be called on to appear as a witness against the men who have been captured. I have written to Admiral Langton, acknowledging his letter, and expressing my surprise that a gentleman in his position should give any countenance, whatever, to a lad who has been engaged in breaking the rules of his school; and in wandering at night, like a vagabond, through the country." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Never {{you mind}} me, Selina," [...] Mr. Bullsom answered, firmly. [...] "As to where I've been, you know quite well. Political dinners may be <b>bad</b> <b>for</b> <b>your</b> linen, {{and there may}} be more healths drunk than is {{altogether}} wise, but a Member of Parliament has to take things as he finds 'em. Don't let us interrupt your game. Brooks and I {{are going to have a}} game at billiards." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am so glad, Austin. You can't {{think how}} pale and worn {{you have been}} lately. It was really our {{principal}} objection to going to London now {{that we did not}} wish to leave you when you were so pulled down. And your manner has been so strange occasionally--especially that night when you left poor Professor Pratt-Haldane to play dummy. I am convinced that these experiments are very <b>bad</b> <b>for</b> <b>your</b> nerves." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I expect company this evening, but I don't {{wish you}} to sit up, Caroline; you are too young, and late hours are <b>bad</b> <b>for</b> <b>your</b> eyes. Go to bed, and don't forget to brush your hair and teeth well, five minutes for each; cold cream your hands, fold your ribbons, hang up your clothes, put out your boots to be cleaned, {{and put in the}} {{mosquito}} bars; I will come and take away the light when I am dressed.' ...|$|E
5000|$|The Earl of Leicester, a {{supporter}} of young Henry {{who had been in}} Normandy and was chief of the aristocratic rebels, took up the charge next. He raised an army of Flemish mercenaries and crossed from Normandy back to England to join the other rebel barons there, principally Hugh Bigod, Earl of Norfolk. The Earl of Leicester was intercepted by the English forces returning from the north in Scotland, led by Richard de Luci, and was completely defeated at Fornham. Henry II's barons supposedly said to him, [...] "It is a <b>bad</b> year <b>for</b> <b>your</b> enemies." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, then, {{whether you}} do or not, I'll give him something," [...] said the earl. [...] "I shouldn't have ventured to meddle {{in the matter}} had I not {{intended}} to put myself in such a position with reference to him as would justify me in asking the question." [...] And the peer as he spoke drew himself up to his full height. [...] "If such a match can be made, it shall not be a <b>bad</b> marriage <b>for</b> <b>your</b> niece in a pecuniary point of view. I shall have pleasure in giving to him; but I shall have more pleasure if she can share what I give." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Mr. Faulkner; [...] "at least {{none that}} I know of. The only {{association}} {{connected with the}} place in my mind is a purely personal association. Look at this house in your drawing--the house with the water-pipe running down it from top to bottom. I once passed a night there--a night I shall never forget to the day of my death. I have had some awkward traveling adventures in my time; but that adventure--! Well, never mind, suppose we begin the sitting. I make but a <b>bad</b> return <b>for</b> <b>your</b> kindness in giving me the sketch by thus wasting your time in mere talk." ...|$|R
6000|$|The blood {{started to}} the lady's cheek as she gave Waverley a {{reception}} in which courtesy was mingled with kindness, while her trembling hand and faltering voice showed {{how much she}} was startled and discomposed. Dinner was hastily replaced, and while Waverley was engaged in refreshing himself, the Colonel proceeded--'I wonder you have come here, Frank; the Doctors tell me the air of London is very <b>bad</b> <b>for</b> <b>your</b> complaints. You should not have risked it. But I am delighted to see you, and so is Emily, though I fear we must not reckon upon your staying long.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "... We {{are just}} arrived in your City, Monseigneur; where, I think, all the Ambassadors {{and all the}} Cooks in Europe have given one another rendezvous. It seems {{as if all the}} Ministers of Germany had {{assembled}} here for the purpose of getting their Emperor's health drunk. As to Messieurs the Ambassadors of Spain, one of them hears two masses a day, and the other manages the troop of players. The English Ministers [a LORD POLWARTH and a LORD WHITWORTH] send many couriers to Champagne, and few to London. For the rest, nobody expects your Eminence here; it is not thought you will quit the Palais-Royal to visit the sheep of your flock in these parts [no!], it would be too <b>bad</b> <b>for</b> <b>your</b> Eminence and for us all.... Think sometimes, Monseigneur, of a man who [regards your goat-faced Eminence as a beautiful ingenious creature; and such a hand in conversation as never was]. The one thing I will ask [of your goat-faced Eminence] at Paris will be, to have the goodness to talk to me." [...] [OEuvres de Voltaire, 97 vols. (Paris, 1825-1834), lxviii. 95, 96.] ...|$|E

5000|$|... "Dancing with a Broken Heart" [...] was {{released}} {{three months after}} Goodrem had major success with [...] "Sitting on Top of the World". The song is about evolving after removing yourself <b>for</b> a <b>bad</b> situation, <b>for</b> <b>your</b> soul or spirit, making a big move, in leaving it, and becoming a better person from the experience, like in the lyrics [...] "I'm gonna bury all the past just six feet under, under/I'm gonna make a storm from lightning and thunder, thunder/I won't let dogs lie in the peace and quiet/Moving on to another time." [...] The song was written by Goodrem and Vince Pizzinga, and produced by John Shanks. The song has heavy EDM guitar elements and is very pop.|$|R

There {{are a number of}} methods of using the tablets in drawing and editing modes to highlight important points, add graphic elements in a presentation, or do examples of “pen and ink” mark-up edits of papers. There are some issues with loss of mobility that we will look at, as well as ways in which that might be overcome in the future. Also, come see a quick demonstration of remote presentations tools as one of those ways in which {{we might be able to}} free ourselves from the instructor’s station in the front of the room.

Attach yourself to someone smarter, prettier, more fashionable, hipper, funnier than you are, and you will automatically acquire these missing qualities by osmosis. They, equally, will benefit from your particular brand of star quality. Your public perception will become more complete, more exciting.
