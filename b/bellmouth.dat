5|$|The current <b>bellmouth,</b> built {{along with}} the Queens Boulevard connection, is two levels deep with two {{additional}} stub-end subway tracks named T1A and T2A. It is viable for future construction of the bypass or the Northern Boulevard transfer station. The original <b>bellmouth</b> stopped at 29th Street. The lower level of the <b>bellmouth</b> was excavated in 2003 for the LIRR East Side Access project, which also extended the subway stub tracks farther east towards Sunnyside Yard. Just above the connection sits the 29th Street Ventilation Complex, built with the connector, in {{the site of a}} former parking lot. West of the station, a second ventilation complex lies in Queensbridge Park between Vernon Boulevard and the East River.|$|E
5|$|On September 22, 2011, a Second Avenue Subway tunnel-boring machine {{completed}} its {{run to the}} Lexington Avenue–63rd Street station's <b>bellmouth</b> from 92nd Street and Second Avenue. Controlled blasting for the section of tunnel between Third Avenue/63rd Street and Second Avenue/65th Street was completed in March 2012.|$|E
5|$|While {{plans to}} {{construct}} the bypass existed as late as 1985, the connection to the Queens Boulevard line at Northern Boulevard was built {{as an alternative to}} the bypass. A <b>bellmouth</b> was built at the end of the tunnel should construction on the bypass ever commence.|$|E
5000|$|The {{completed}} IND 63rd Street Line, {{which the}} [...] uses {{to cross the}} East River, was designed and built with <b>bellmouths</b> {{to allow for the}} construction of connections to the planned Second Avenue Subway for service to/from the north and south along Second Avenue. Those <b>bellmouths</b> will be used in later construction, unlike most other Second System <b>bellmouths.</b>|$|R
5|$|Two <b>bellmouths</b> {{have since}} been completed, but were {{previously}} unused.|$|R
500|$|The {{completed}} IND 63rd Street Line, {{which the}} [...] uses {{to cross the}} East River, was designed and built with <b>bellmouths</b> {{to allow for the}} construction of connections to the planned Second Avenue Subway for service to/from the north and south along Second Avenue. These <b>bellmouths</b> were completed and opened in 2017.|$|R
5|$|Built {{as a local}} station, {{the station}} was {{constructed}} with <b>bellmouth</b> provisions to allow conversion into an express station. A close observation of both ends of this station reveals that the tunnel wall extends outward to allow space for the two side platforms to be replaced with island platforms, with the local tracks taking the side platforms' place. The station would have accommodated a major system expansion, with additional service coming from the Roosevelt Avenue Terminal station and the former LIRR Rockaway Line. Requests to convert the station were also put forward by the local community shortly after the station opened, due to heavy bus traffic feeding into the station and overcrowding at the Roosevelt Avenue express stop.|$|E
5|$|Once {{construction}} on Phase 2 of the Second Avenue Subway, which runs from 105th Street to 125th Street and Lexington Avenue, is completed, {{it is expected}} that construction will then take place on Phase 3. Phase 3 would extend the Second Avenue Subway south from the provisions for the line to continue further south on Second Avenue. The tracks would diverge from the tracks that continue to the BMT 63rd Street Line running south on Second Avenue. There is currently a large provisional cavern, or <b>bellmouth,</b> for this line. The line would continue down Second Avenue to Houston Street, where the third phase would end. However, no funding has been committed to this phase. After Phase 3, a new T service will operate from 125th Street to Houston Street.|$|E
5|$|Several {{stations}} {{along the}} line also have provisions for other extensions {{as part of the}} IND Second System. The Roosevelt Avenue station has an additional upper level platform and <b>bellmouth</b> provisions east of the station, which would have gone to a Queens crosstown line to the Rockaways. The 63rd Drive station has similar bellmouths, which would have fed directly into the inactive portion of the Long Island Rail Road's former Rockaway Beach Branch near its former junction with the LIRR Main Line (Whitepot Junction). One stop west, the Woodhaven Boulevard station has provisions to be converted into an express station. East of the Briarwood station, there were additional trackways built for an extension down Van Wyck Boulevard (today the Van Wyck Expressway) to Rockaway Boulevard, near the current site of John F. Kennedy International Airport. None of these proposals were ever funded, and only the Briarwood bellmouths were used for future expansion, while the Rockaway line was connected instead to the IND Fulton Street Line.|$|E

500|$|<b>Bellmouths</b> for uncompleted {{lines are}} {{scattered}} in numerous stations, including 21st Street–Queensbridge, 59th Street, 63rd Drive–Rego Park, Bowery, Canal Street, and Woodhaven Boulevard: ...|$|R
5|$|Archer Avenue Line to Springfield Boulevard {{branching}} {{off of the}} BMT Jamaica Line at 127th Street and off of the Queens Boulevard Line at <b>bellmouths</b> railroad north of the Van Wyck Boulevard station.|$|R
25|$|North of this station, a <b>bellmouth</b> {{is visible}} from a Manhattan-bound train. The <b>bellmouth</b> {{was for the}} {{proposed}} Ashland Place Connection which would have connected to the now-demolished BMT Fulton Street El.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{trackway}} {{just east}} of Roosevelt Avenue that diverges away from the Manhattan-bound local track. The trackway ramps up to {{the same level as}} the two trackways coming from the never-used Roosevelt Avenue Terminal, making three trackways on the upper level. The ramp flies over the mainline tracks along with the two other trackways. Between 78th and 79th Streets, the three trackways on upper level curve towards the south and ending at the wall at the edge of constructed subway. There is a diverging <b>bellmouth</b> next to the Jamaica-bound local track several hundred feet north of the station just at the location where the three upstairs trackways are crossing over. This <b>bellmouth</b> also curves towards the south and similarly ends on a concrete wall shortly after the start of the <b>bellmouth.</b> At the end of the unused tunnel there is an emergency exit that opens out to the south side of Broadway across the street from Elmhurst Hospital Center. The four-track subway running south was a plan for a line along the Long Island Rail Road right-of-way to Garfield Avenue and 65th Place. The line, called the Winfield Spur, would have turned along 65th Place to Fresh Pond Road and then along Fresh Pond Road to Cypress Hills Street. The line would have merged with the Myrtle–Central Avenues Line to the Rockaways proposed in 1929. All four trackways end at a concrete wall where they begin to diverge from the excavation for the existing line.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the line}} never saw construction, {{evidence}} remains visible {{of a plan}} to build it. Vestiges of a <b>bellmouth</b> can be seen while traveling on the local tracks south of Canal Street. A large open space above the platform level at East Broadway was intended to become a two-track station. Above {{the north end of the}} Broadway station, a six-track station where the IND Worth Street and the Houston Street Lines would have converged can be envisioned.|$|E
50|$|For the 1967 Model Year (MY) the Spitfire was {{upgraded}} and {{designated as}} Mark III. The racing Amal GP carburettors with open-intakes (<b>bellmouths)</b> {{were replaced by}} Amal Concentrics with individual chome filters which enabled better low-range engine response.|$|R
5|$|East of 63rd Drive–Rego Park on the IND Queens Boulevard Line, <b>bellmouths</b> {{were built}} for a {{proposed}} {{connection to the}} LIRR's Rockaway Beach Branch. They may be used if the Rockaway Beach Branch was ever reused for subway service.|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this program}} were to study the factors leading to increased errors in sub-critical flow metering, utilize existing theoretical methods to design a new sub-critical flow meter for very high accuracy, predict its discharge coefficient, and then experimentally verify it by calibration with an industry standard critical flow meter. The meter design was typical of that used for modern, lightweight, engine mounted <b>bellmouths,</b> but its size was small enough to allow its calibration in a high accuracy laboratory environment. Thus this program provides a "calibration" of the theoretical method and establishes the link between a traceable metering standard and large engine <b>bellmouths</b> whose air flow rates exceed the capacity {{of any of the}} worlds calibration facilities...|$|R
25|$|Canal Street, under Sixth Avenue, is {{the last}} normal four-track station on the line. Crossovers in each direction, beyond the station, take C and late night A trains between the local tracks {{to the north and}} the express tracks to the south. As the subway turns from Sixth Avenue into Church Street, the {{southbound}} local track passes under the express tracks, bringing E trains to the east. At this point, a <b>bellmouth</b> originally intended for the never-built IND Worth Street Line is present {{on the east side of}} the tunnel. It has been proposed to use this to bring Long Island Rail Road Atlantic Branch trains to Lower Manhattan as part of the Lower Manhattan-Jamaica/JFK Transportation Project.|$|E
25|$|In 1896, the {{railroad}} gained {{a connection with}} the Kings County Elevated Railway {{by means of a}} ramp and short elevated railway. The connection connected with the Fulton Street Elevated, which ran from Downtown Brooklyn to Jamaica and was completed in 1893. From there the line bridged over Atlantic Avenue, where the LIRR was still operating at grade. As part of the Atlantic Avenue Improvement program, this portion of the LIRR was submerged in a tunnel between 1903 and 1905. There would have been a future connection from the Atlantic Branch to the Brighton Line, for which provisions were provided. This connection would have been for two tracks, but it was never built. However, space in the tunnel wall, a <b>bellmouth,</b> was provided for this connection. Then the line connected to the existing line several blocks to the south.|$|E
500|$|The TBM, digging {{at a rate}} of {{approximately}} [...] per day, finished its run at the planned endpoint under 65th Street on February 5, 2011. S3 partially disassembled the TBM, backed it out of the tunnel, and placed it in the short eastern tunnel so it could bore again. On March 28, 2011, S3, having completed its task of completing the [...] west tunnel to 65th Street, began drilling the east tunnel. The TBM drilling the east tunnel then negotiated the curve onto 63rd Street and broke through the <b>bellmouth</b> at the existing Lexington Avenue–63rd Street station. The portion of the west tunnel remaining to be created was then mined using conventional drill-and-blast methods, because the curve S3 construction teams would have to negotiate was too tight for the TBM. On September 22, 2011, the TBM completed its run to the Lexington Avenue–63rd Street station's <b>bellmouth.</b>|$|E
5|$|There are <b>bellmouths</b> {{and space}} for two {{additional}} trackways (for {{a total of}} six) on the BMT Fourth Avenue Line south of 59th Street. These provisions were for the Staten Island Tunnel, which would have intersected with the line south of 59th Street.|$|R
50|$|There {{was a plan}} {{to build}} a loop just north of this station to turn back Fourth Avenue local trains from 95th Street. The <b>bellmouths</b> for the un-built loop can be seen just north of this station where the bypass tracks join the bridge tracks that stop at DeKalb Avenue.|$|R
5|$|The {{station is}} fully ADA-accessible, with {{elevators}} to street level. West of this station, {{there is a}} diamond crossover and two <b>bellmouths</b> that curve southward toward an unbuilt portion of the Second Avenue Subway. The station has an unused lower level, which will be used by Long Island Rail Road trains once East Side Access is completed.|$|R
500|$|East of the station, {{before the}} line {{connects to the}} IND Queens Boulevard Line, the tracks veer left while the tunnel wall goes straight, {{stopping}} around Northern Boulevard. This <b>bellmouth</b> {{is part of an}} intended [...] "super-express" [...] bypass of the IND Queens Boulevard Line running along the mainline of the Long Island Rail Road between Queens Boulevard and Forest Hills–71st Avenue planned in 1968. At a proposed station at Northern Boulevard, for which the 29th Street tail tracks might have also been built, a transfer concourse to the Queens Plaza station would have allowed transfers between local, express, and bypass trains.|$|E
500|$|A {{ceremonial}} ground-breaking for the Second Avenue Subway {{was held}} on April 12, 2007; the contractor prepared the initial construction site at 96th Street on April 23, 2007. A tunnel boring machine (TBM) was originally expected to arrive six to eight months after construction began, but the utility relocation and excavation required to create its [...] "launch box" [...] delayed its deployment until May 2010. On May 14, 2010, MTA's contractors completed the TBM installation and turned it on. [...] On March 28, 2011, S3, having completed the west tunnel to 65th Street, began drilling for the east tunnel. The TBM completed its run to the 63rd Street station's <b>bellmouth</b> on September 22, 2011.|$|E
500|$|By 1985, the line's {{construction}} {{had cost}} $800 million, {{and the line}} would need another $200 million of fixes {{in order to make}} it usable. The MTA considered abandoning the line, but because the tunnel was examined and found to be sturdy, the MTA decided to add a single station in Queens: the 21st Street–Queensbridge station in Long Island City. However, the 63rd Street Subway's eastern Queens extension was no longer being planned, although a <b>bellmouth</b> was built at the end of the tunnel, past 21st Street–Queensbridge, as a provision for the express bypass. The usage estimates for 21st Street–Queensbridge, calculated in 1984, were 220 passengers per hour. The MTA considered four alternatives to improve the line's functionality by extending it farther into Queens: ...|$|E
25|$|East of the station, {{the tunnel}} widens {{on both sides}} to {{accommodate}} an additional trackway diverging from the local tracks. These <b>bellmouths</b> were built for a proposed extension along the BMT Jamaica Line, or for a proposed Jamaica Avenue Subway. It was not a provision for the IND Second System, as were similar structures on other IND lines, but rather date from an earlier plan for the IND Fulton Street Line, which would have connected the IND tracks west of the station to two lines {{to the east of}} the station: the BMT Jamaica Line tracks, and the BMT Fulton Street Line tracks to Lefferts Boulevard (which were eventually connected to the IND Fulton Street Line anyway, albeit past Grant Avenue). One of these <b>bellmouths</b> has an emergency exit. There is nothing on the model board in the Broadway/East New York tower to show this provision.|$|R
2500|$|South of this station, {{a pair of}} <b>bellmouths</b> exists, {{allowing}} for a connection to a never-built East River tunnel south of the Montague Street Tunnel, going towards the proposed DeKalb Avenue bypass, using the old LIRR Atlantic Avenue Tunnel or under another street in Brooklyn. Further south is a flying junction joining from Broad Street on the BMT Nassau Street Line (...) [...]|$|R
5|$|In Phase 2, Q {{and limited}} N {{service will be}} {{extended}} to 125th Street and Lexington Avenue. As part of the 2004 FEIS, it was planned for Q service to be increased to 19 trains per hour to accommodate the projected increase in ridership. In order {{to allow for the}} construction of Phase 3, <b>bellmouths</b> have been constructed at the turnoff to the BMT 63rd Street Line.|$|R
500|$|None {{of these}} options came to pass, and the 63rd Street Line was opened in 1989 {{after more than}} a decade of delays, its {{terminal}} station at 21st Street, rendering the once-grandiosely-planned line a [...] "useless subway to nowhere". In 1990, a modified version of the Queens Boulevard Line connection was selected, with connections to both the local and express Queens Boulevard tracks. In 2001, the 63rd Street Connection was completed between the Queens stub of the 63rd Street Line at 29th Street and the 36th Street station of the Queens Boulevard line, allowing service from both Queens Boulevard local and express trains to serve the line. The connection cost $645 million and resulted in several major service changes (see below). Under the 1985 connector plans, the , [...] (which operated on Queens Boulevard until 1987), [...] (then called the QB), and a resurrected K Sixth Avenue route, were among the routes to be extended along Queens Boulevard or a bypass route via 63rd Street, while the F would have retained its routing via 53rd Street. As part of the connector, a new <b>bellmouth</b> and additional tail tracks were built to facilitate a future line such as the bypass options or construction of a transfer station.|$|E
500|$|Phase 2 {{will extend}} the line north from the 96th Street station to a station at 125th Street and Lexington Avenue. North of 120th Street, {{it will be}} {{constructed}} {{through the use of}} TBMs. The TBM Launch Box will be located between 121st Street and 122nd Street on Second Avenue. The TBMs will head north under Second Avenue to 121st Street before turning slightly east to curve under the East River Houses, turning west on 125th Street, crossing Lexington Avenue, before ending [...] west of Fifth Avenue to accommodate storage tracks. South of 120th Street, the line will utilize a tunnel section built during the 1970s, located between 110th Street and 120th Street. This section will have tracks and other essential equipment installed, like that {{of the rest of the}} line. Since it was deemed uneconomical to use TBMs, cut-and-cover will be used to connect the existing tunnel section to the bored section to the north (at 120th Street) and to the portion of the line already in operation to the south (at 105th Street). A <b>bellmouth</b> will be constructed to allow for a future extension to the Bronx. The storage tracks west of the 125th Street station would replace the storage tracks north of the 96th Street station, which would then be used in revenue service as part of Phase 2.|$|E
2500|$|On March 28, 2011, S3, having {{completed}} its task of completing the [...] west tunnel to 65th Street, began drilling the east tunnel, {{with the first}} [...] being through soil frozen by S3 using calcium chloride solution fed through a network of pipes. The TBM drilling the east tunnel then negotiated the curve onto 63rd Street and broke through the <b>bellmouth</b> at the existing Lexington Avenue–63rd Street station. That <b>bellmouth</b> had {{been built in the}} late 1970s and early 1980s as part of the construction of the 63rd Street Line in anticipation of the construction of the Second Avenue line. The portion of the west tunnel remaining to be created was then mined using conventional drill-and-blast methods, because the curve S3 construction teams would have to negotiate was too tight for the TBM. On September 22, 2011, the TBM {{completed its}} run to the Lexington Avenue–63rd Street station's <b>bellmouth.</b> This major milestone was celebrated with a big ribbon-cutting to mark the TBM breaking through to the existing <b>bellmouth.</b> The TBM had dug a total of [...] for the east tunnel.|$|E
5|$|East of 21st Street–Queensbridge, {{before the}} IND 63rd Street Line {{connects to the}} IND Queens Boulevard Line, the tracks veer left while the tunnel wall goes straight. The <b>bellmouths</b> {{were part of a}} {{proposed}} super-express bypass running under the LIRR mainline between Queens Boulevard and Forest Hills. This plan was not in the original Second System plan, but rather, as part of the Program for Action plan that had the tracks from 21st Street–Queensbridge go straight to Forest Hills.|$|R
50|$|The {{station has}} a {{shortened}} mezzanine because room {{was needed for}} a proposed Lafayette Avenue line. The subway connection was never built. North of this station, near the Manhattan Bridge, there is a provision for a never-built loop back to southern Brooklyn without crossing the Manhattan Bridge into Manhattan. <b>Bellmouths</b> for the unbuilt loop are visible from passing trains. South of this station, a junction was built at Fulton Street for a never-built branch to run via Lafayette Avenue and Broadway.|$|R
50|$|South of this station, on {{the express}} tracks {{on the lower}} level, there are <b>bellmouths</b> for a {{proposed}} subway line along Fort Hamilton Parkway and/or the parallel Tenth Avenue. After diverging into two lines at around 65th Street, the mainline would have terminated at 86th Street in Bay Ridge, and the other line would travel west from the mainline towards a partially-built tunnel to Staten Island. An alternate plan proposed {{a connection to the}} BMT West End Line at New Utrecht Avenue. These lines were planned as part of the IND Second System.|$|R
