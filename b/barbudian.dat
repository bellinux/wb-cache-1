2500|$|The British {{originally}} constructed River Fort Martello Tower in {{the early}} 19th century, {{on the site of}} a previous fort (presumed to have been built by the Spanish) to guard nearby River Landing, which was Barbuda's original quay. Confusion with the previous fort is presumably explains the claims made in <b>Barbudian</b> tourism publications that this was the World's first, and is its oldest, Martello tower, built in 1745. [...] The tower is located on the south coast of the island, a mile or so from River Landing and some seven miles south of the island's main village of Codrington. The tower is 56 feet high, has a raised gun platform and extremely thick walls, but is missing the floors.|$|E
50|$|On {{all matters}} of the Antiguan and <b>Barbudian</b> state, the Monarch is advised solely by Antiguan and <b>Barbudian</b> ministers. Effective with the patriation of Antigua and Barbuda's Constitution, no British or other realm {{government}} can advise the Monarch on any matters pertinent to Antigua and Barbuda.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Charles, Prince of Wales, is {{the heir}} {{apparent}} to the Antiguan and <b>Barbudian</b> Throne ...|$|E
50|$|Succession to {{the throne}} is by male-preference primogeniture, and governed by the {{provisions}} of the Act of Settlement, as well as the English Bill of Rights. These documents, though originally passed by the Parliament of England, are now part of Antiguan and <b>Barbudian</b> constitutional law, under control of the Antiguan and <b>Barbudian</b> parliament only. As such, the rules for succession are not fixed, but may be changed by a constitutional amendment.|$|E
50|$|After an {{individual}} ascends the Throne, {{he or she}} continues to reign until death. Monarchs {{are not allowed to}} unilaterally abdicate; no Antiguan and <b>Barbudian</b> monarch has abdicated.|$|E

50|$|Usually the Queen's Antiguan and <b>Barbudian</b> {{government}} pays {{only for}} {{the costs associated with}} the Governor-General in his or her exercising of the powers of the Crown on behalf of the Queen, including travel, security, residences, offices, ceremonial occasions, etc.|$|E
50|$|In addition, {{it is the}} Crown's {{prerogative}} {{to declare}} war, make peace, and direct {{the actions of the}} military, although the Prime Minister holds de facto decision-making power over the armed forces. The Royal Prerogative also extends to foreign affairs: the Sovereign or Governor-General may negotiate and ratify treaties, alliances, and international agreements; no parliamentary approval is required. However, a treaty cannot alter the domestic laws of the Antigua and Barbuda; an Act of Parliament is necessary in such cases. The Governor-General, on behalf of the Queen, also accredits Antiguan and <b>Barbudian</b> High Commissioners and ambassadors, and receives diplomats from foreign states. In addition, all Antiguan and <b>Barbudian</b> passports are issued in the Monarch's name. In Antigua and Barbuda major public inquiries are called Royal Commissions, and are created by the Cabinet on behalf of the Monarch through a Royal Warrant.|$|E
50|$|The Queen is {{the only}} member of the Antiguan and <b>Barbudian</b> Royal Family with any {{constitutional}} role; she, her husband, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, their son The Prince of Wales, and other members of the Royal Family, including the Queen's other children and cousins, undertake various public ceremonial functions within Antigua and Barbuda and abroad.|$|E
50|$|Antiguans and Barbudians {{do not pay}} {{any money}} to the Queen, either for {{personal}} income or to support the royal residences outside of Antigua and Barbuda. Only when the Queen is in Antigua and Barbuda, or acting abroad as Queen of Antigua and Barbuda, does the Antiguan and <b>Barbudian</b> government support her {{in the performance of}} her duties. This rule applies equally to other members of the Royal Family.|$|E
50|$|The current Antiguan and <b>Barbudian</b> monarchy {{can trace}} its ancestral lineage {{back to the}} Anglo-Saxon and Merovingian periods, and {{ultimately}} back to the kings of the Angles, the early Scottish kings, and the Frankish kingdom of Clovis I. Parts of the territories that today comprise Antigua and Barbuda were claimed under King Charles I in 1632. The country was proclaimed fully independent, via constitutional patriation, by Queen Elizabeth II in 1981.|$|E
50|$|Antigua and Barbuda's {{constitution}} {{is made up}} of a variety of statutes and conventions that are either British or Antiguan and <b>Barbudian</b> in origin, which gives Antigua and Barbuda a similar parliamentary system of government as the other Commonwealth realms. All powers of state are constitutionally reposed in the Monarch, who is represented in the country by the Governor-General of Antigua and Barbuda â€” appointed by the Monarch upon the advice of the Prime Minister of Antigua and Barbuda; most of the Queen's domestic duties are performed by these vice-regal representative.|$|E
5000|$|Because the Antiguan and <b>Barbudian</b> Monarchy is a {{constitutional}} one, {{the powers that}} are constitutionally the Monarch's are exercised almost wholly upon {{the advice of his}} or her Prime Minister and the Ministers of the Crown in Cabinet, who are, in turn, accountable to the democratically elected House of Commons, and through it, to the people. It has been said since the death of Queen Anne in 1714, the last monarch to head the British cabinet, that the monarch [...] "reigns" [...] but does not [...] "rule". This means that the Monarch's role, and thereby the Governor-General's role, is almost entirely symbolic and cultural, acting {{as a symbol of the}} legal authority under which all governments and agencies operate.|$|E
