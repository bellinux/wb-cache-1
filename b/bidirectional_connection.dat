40|$|We {{propose a}} network-coding based scheme to protect {{multiple}} <b>bidirectional</b> unicast <b>connections</b> against adversarial errors and failures in a network. The network {{consists of a}} set of <b>bidirectional</b> primary path <b>connections</b> that carry the uncoded traffic. The end nodes of the <b>bidirectional</b> <b>connections</b> are connected by a set of shared protection paths that provide the redundancy required for protection. Such protection strategies are employed in the domain of optical networks for recovery from failures. In this work we consider the problem of simultaneous protection against adversarial errors and failures. Suppose that n_e paths are corrupted by the omniscient adversary. Under our proposed protocol, the errors can be corrected at all the end nodes with 4 n_e protection paths. More generally, if there are n_e adversarial errors and n_f failures, 4 n_e + 2 n_f protection paths are sufficient. The number of protection paths only depends on the number of errors and failures being protected against and is independent of the number of unicast connections.

5000|$|Other {{connection}} protocols, namely UDP and ICMP, are {{not based}} on <b>bidirectional</b> <b>connections</b> like TCP, making a stateful firewall somewhat less secure. In order to track a connection state in these cases, a firewall must transfer sessions to the ESTABLISHED state after seeing the first valid packet. It can then only track the connection through addresses and ports of the following packets' source and destination. Unlike TCP connections, which can be closed by a [...] "FIN, ACK" [...] exchange, these connectionless protocols allow a session to end only by time-out. This, for example, enables UDP hole punching.|$|R

Different from the existing methods, we first focus on using MDCs to traverse all segments rather than just two adjacent segments, under the conditions that minimize the mobile total distance and ensure that different MDCs have moving-distance equilibrium. On the other hand, we consider the segments as a collection of sensor nodes, which sets them apart from most existing methods.|$|E

Although the topographic organization of V 4 's connections with other cortical areas has been established, the detailed topography of its connections with subcortical areas is unclear. We therefore injected retrograde and anterograde tracers in different topographical regions of V 4 in nine macaques to determine the organization of its subcortical connections. The injection sites included representations ranging from the fovea to far peripheral eccentricities in both the upper and lower visual fields. The topographically organized connections of V 4 included <b>bidirectional</b> <b>connections</b> with four subdivisions of the pulvinar, two subdivisions of the claustrum, and the interlaminar portions of the lateral geniculate nucleus, and efferent projections to the superficial and intermediate layers of the superior colliculus, the thalamic reticular nucleus, and the caudate nucleus.
