500|$|The Polish brigade was {{withdrawn}} to Nijmegen and helped defend the airborne corridor {{before returning to}} England in early October. Shortly afterward, the British began making Sosabowski and the Polish Brigade a scapegoat for the failure at Arnhem, perhaps to cover their own failings. On 17 October, Montgomery informed Alan Brooke—Chief of the Imperial General Staff—that he felt the Polish forces had [...] "fought very badly" [...] at Arnhem {{and that he did}} not want them under his command. Author David Bennett observes that Montgomery had almost certainly been fed gross misinformation that supported his own prejudices. A month later, Browning wrote a long and highly critical letter of Sosabowski to Brooke's deputy. In it, he accused Sosabowski of being difficult, unadaptable, argumentative and [...] "loth to play his full part in the operation unless everything was done for him and his brigade". It is possible that Browning himself wanted to make Sosabowski a scapegoat, although it may equally have been the work of officers of the 43rd Division. Browning recommended that Sosabowski be replaced – suggesting Lieutenant Colonel Jachnik or Major Tonn – and in December the Polish government in exile duly dismissed him in a move almost certainly made under British pressure. Although it may <b>be</b> <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> Sosabowski was difficult to work with, his scapegoating is judged as disgraceful by many historical commentators. Brian Urquhart—who had done so much to warn his superiors about the dangers of Arnhem —described the criticism of Sosabowski and the brigade as [...] "grotesque" [...] and that his dismissal was a [...] "shameful act".|$|E
500|$|Another Green World was {{released}} in September 1975 and did not chart in either the United Kingdom or the United States. The album's reception was {{for the most part}} very favourable. Henry Edwards of High Fidelity wrote positively of the album, claiming it to be Eno's [...] "most accessible to date". Tom Hull of The Village Voice felt that, although it [...] "wouldn't <b>be</b> <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> Another Green World is Eno's best album," [...] the album is definitely [...] "his easiest to love." [...] Charley Walters of Rolling Stone found it a [...] "major triumph" [...] that Eno's creative risks [...] "so consistently pan out", and said that it is [...] "indeed an important record—and also a brilliant one". Negative reviews of the album focused on the lack of the rock songs from Eno's previous albums. Jon Pareles, writing in Crawdaddy!, found its electronic excursions less challenging than Eno's previous progressive rock songs and remarked, [...] "This ain't no Eno record. I don't care what the credits say. It doesn't even get on my nerves." [...] Lester Bangs of The Village Voice was lulled by much of the music and said that [...] "those little pools of sound on the outskirts of silence seemed to me the logical consequence of letting the processes and technology share your conceptual burden". Robert Christgau, who originally gave the album an [...] "A–" [...] in his review for The Village Voice, admitted that he resisted the album at first, but ultimately grew to [...] "love every minute of this arty little collection of static (i.e., non-swinging) synthesizer pieces (with vocals, percussion, and guitar)." [...] He felt that its 13 pieces can be appreciated both individually and as a whole, and called the album [...] "the aural equivalent of a park on the moon — oneness with nature under conditions of artificial gravity." [...] In 1977, Another Green World was voted the 11th best album of 1976 in the Village Voices Pazz & Jop critics' poll. Christgau, the poll's creator, ranked it second on his own list for the poll.|$|E

Though the roads and structures are still there and occupied, access to the base is still restricted. It would <b>be</b> <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the two towns are [...] "lost" [...] to Virginia, albeit for purposes of national defense. Also in 1943, the site of another nearby town, Penniman, was acquired and absorbed into the Cheatham Annex complex, which adjoins Camp Peary, and {{is part of the}} Naval Weapons Station Yorktown.|$|E
2500|$|Water {{rights are}} {{extremely}} important to American Indians, especially those American Indian tribes living in the West, where water supplies are limited. American Indian reservations, and those who live within them, rely on water sources for the water necessary {{for them to be}} self-sufficient. American Indian reservations rely on streams and rivers for agricultural purposes. Not only is the water itself important to the American Indian reservations, but also what the water contains. By having the rights to an area of water, one also gains rights to what is in the water. [...] This gives an implied right to fish the waters. [...] Because life relies on water, it may <b>be</b> <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> who controls the water ultimately has control over life on the reservation.|$|E

As {{a matter of}} fact, I read {{everything}} within reach, even the copy of Paradise Lost which my mother presented to me on my fifteenth birthday. Milton I admit was hard work, but I got considerable joy out of his cursing passages. The battle scenes also interested me and I went about spouting the extraordinary harangues of Satan with such vigor that my team one day took fright of me, and ran away with the plow, leaving an erratic furrow to be explained. However, my father {{was glad to see}} me taking on the voice of the orator.|$|E
6000|$|Milton cannot {{certainly}} be taxed with any partiality for low words. He rather loved them tall, as the Prussian King loved {{men to be}} six feet high in their stockings, and fit {{to go into the}} grenadiers. He loved them as much for their music as for their meaning,--perhaps more. His style, therefore, when it has to deal with commoner things, is apt to grow a little cumbrous and unwieldy. A Persian poet says that when the owl would boast he boasts of catching mice {{at the edge of a}} hole. Shakespeare would have understood this. Milton would have made him talk like an eagle. His influence is not to be left out of account as partially contributing to that decline toward poetic diction which was already beginning ere he died. If it would not <b>be</b> <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> he is the most artistic, he may be called in the highest sense the most scientific of our poets. If to Spenser younger poets have gone to be sung-to, they have sat at the feet of Milton to be taught. Our language has no finer poem than [...] "Samson Agonistes," [...] if any so fine in the quality of austere dignity or in the skill with which the poet's personal experience is generalized into a classic tragedy.|$|E
