5|$|There {{are several}} types of {{inflammation}} that can cause knee pain, including sprains, <b>bursitis,</b> and injuries to the meniscus. A diagnosis of prepatellar <b>bursitis</b> can be made based on a physical examination {{and the presence of}} risk factors in the person's medical history; swelling and tenderness {{at the front of the}} knee, combined with a profession that requires frequent kneeling, suggest prepatellar <b>bursitis.</b> Swelling of multiple joints along with restricted range of motion may indicate arthritis instead.|$|E
5|$|A {{definitive}} {{diagnosis of}} the condition can usually be made once a clinical history and physical examination have been obtained, though determining {{whether or not the}} <b>bursitis</b> is septic is not as straightforward. Treatment of prepatellar <b>bursitis</b> depends on the severity of the symptoms. Mild cases may only require rest and icing of the knee. A number of different treatment options have been used for severe septic cases, including intravenous antibiotics, surgical irrigation of the bursa, and bursectomy.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} to prevent the onset of prepatellar <b>bursitis,</b> or prevent the symptoms from worsening, by avoiding trauma to the knee or frequent kneeling. Protective knee pads can also help prevent prepatellar <b>bursitis</b> for those whose professions require frequent kneeling and for athletes who play contact sports, such as American football, basketball, and wrestling.|$|E
5|$|Prepatellar <b>bursitis</b> is an {{inflammation}} of the prepatellar bursa {{at the front of}} the knee. It is marked by swelling at the knee, which can be tender to the touch but which does not restrict the knee's range of motion. It is most commonly caused by trauma to the knee, either by a single acute instance or by chronic trauma over time. As such, prepatellar <b>bursitis</b> commonly occurs among individuals whose professions require frequent kneeling.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{symptom of}} prepatellar <b>bursitis</b> is the {{swelling}} of {{the area around the}} kneecap. It generally does not produce a significant amount of pain unless pressure is applied directly to the swelling. The area of swelling may be red (erythema), warm to the touch, or surrounded by cellulitis, particularly if the area has become infected. In such cases, the <b>bursitis</b> is often accompanied by fever. Unlike arthritis, prepatellar <b>bursitis</b> generally does not affect the range of motion of the knee, though it may cause some discomfort when the knee is completely flexed. Flexion and extension of the knee may cause crepitus.|$|E
5|$|Non-septic prepatellar <b>bursitis</b> can {{be treated}} with rest, the {{application}} of ice to the affected area, and anti-inflammatory drugs, particularly ibuprofen. Elevation of the affected leg during rest may also expedite the recovery process. Severe cases may require fine-needle aspiration of the bursa fluid, sometimes coupled with cortisone injections. However, some {{studies have shown that}} steroid injections may not be an effective treatment option. After the <b>bursitis</b> has been treated, rehabilitative exercise may help improve joint mechanics and reduce chronic pain.|$|E
5|$|The prepatellar bursa and the {{olecranon}} bursa {{are the two}} bursae {{that are}} most likely to become infected, or septic. Septic <b>bursitis</b> typically occurs when the trauma to the knee causes an abrasion, though it is also possible for the infection to be caused by bacteria traveling through the blood from a pre-existing infection site. In approximately 80% of septic cases, the infection is caused by Staphylococcus aureus; other common infections are Streptococcus, Mycobacterium, and Brucella. It is highly unusual for septic <b>bursitis</b> to be caused by anaerobes, fungi, or Gram-negative bacteria. In very rare cases, the infection can be caused by tuberculosis.|$|E
5|$|The various nicknames {{associated}} with prepatellar <b>bursitis</b> {{arise from the}} fact that it commonly occurs among those individuals whose professions require frequent kneeling, such as carpenters, carpet layers, gardeners, housemaids, mechanics, miners, plumbers, and roofers. The exact incidence of the condition is not known; it is difficult to estimate because only severe septic cases require hospital admission, and mild non-septic cases generally go unreported. Prepatellar <b>bursitis</b> is more common among males than females. It affects all age groups, but is more likely to be septic when it occurs in children.|$|E
5|$|Hubbard's health {{deteriorated}} significantly {{during this}} period. A chain-smoker, he also suffered from <b>bursitis</b> and excessive weight, {{and had a}} prominent growth on his forehead. He suffered serious injuries in a motorcycle accident in 1973 and {{had a heart attack}} in 1975 that required him to take anticoagulant drugs for the next year. In September 1978, Hubbard had a pulmonary embolism, falling into a coma, but recovered.|$|E
5|$|A {{physical}} examination and medical history {{are generally not}} enough to distinguish between infectious and non-infectious bursitis; aspiration of the bursal fluid is often required for this, along with a cell culture and Gram stain of the aspirated fluid. Septic prepatellar <b>bursitis</b> may be diagnosed if the fluid is {{found to have a}} neutrophil count above 1500 per microliter, a threshold significantly lower than that of septic arthritis (50,000 cells per microliter). A tuberculosis infection can be confirmed using a roentgenogram and urinalysis.|$|E
5|$|In human anatomy, a bursa {{is a small}} pouch {{filled with}} {{synovial}} fluid. Its purpose is to reduce friction between adjacent structures. The prepatellar bursa {{is one of several}} bursae of the knee joint, and is located between the patella and the skin. Prepatellar <b>bursitis</b> is an inflammation of this bursa. Bursae are readily inflamed when irritated, as their walls are very thin. Along with the pes anserine bursa, the prepatellar bursa {{is one of the most}} common bursae to cause knee pain when inflamed.|$|E
5|$|In the 2005–2006 season, Lysacek again competed on the Grand Prix. He placed {{second at}} the 2005 Skate America, {{but it was}} clear that his Grease free skate was not working. Lysacek and coach Frank Carroll made the {{decision}} to find a new long program. Lysacek's new Carmen program was a success at the 2005 NHK Trophy, where Lysacek placed second. Lysacek was the only American man to qualify for the 2005–2006 Grand Prix Final, but he withdrew before the event because of <b>bursitis</b> and tendinitis in his right hip.|$|E
5|$|Prepatellar <b>bursitis</b> {{is caused}} by either a single {{instance}} of acute trauma to the knee, or repeated minor trauma to the knee. The trauma can cause extravasation of nearby fluids into the bursa, which stimulates an inflammatory response. This response occurs in two phases: The vascular phase, in which the {{blood flow to the}} surrounding area increases, and the cellular phase, in which leukocytes migrate from the blood to the affected area. Other possible causes include gout, sarcoidosis, CREST syndrome, diabetes mellitus, alcohol abuse, uremia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Some cases are idiopathic, though these may be caused by trauma that the patient does not remember.|$|E
5|$|The {{differential}} diagnosis for heel pain is extensive and includes pathological entities including, {{but not limited}} to the following: calcaneal stress fracture, calcaneal <b>bursitis,</b> osteoarthritis, spinal stenosis involving the nerve roots of lumbar spinal nerve 5 (L5) or sacral spinal nerve 1 (S1), calcaneal fat pad syndrome, hypothyroidism, seronegative spondyloparthopathies such as reactive arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, or rheumatoid arthritis (more likely if pain is present in both heels), plantar fascia rupture, and compression neuropathies such as tarsal tunnel syndrome or impingement of the medial calcaneal nerve.|$|E
5|$|Davis was 47 {{years old}} when he was asked to play Carnegie Hall in 1974, which {{followed}} four years of relentless touring. He had played the venue numerous times before and recorded a live album there in 1961. By 1974, Davis had been dealing with depression, cocaine and sex addictions, and several health problems, including osteoarthritis, <b>bursitis,</b> and sickle-cell anemia. He had also lost respect with both critics and his contemporaries because of his musical explorations into more rock- and funk-oriented sounds. Influenced by Karlheinz Stockhausen, Davis wanted to avoid individual songs and instead record extended movements that developed into a different composition. He played his trumpet sparsely and became less of the focal point for his band, whom he allowed more freedom to improvise and with whom he rarely rehearsed, so that the young musicians he enlisted would be tested to learn and play together onstage.|$|E
5|$|Following {{a career}} high in {{appearances}} in 2004, Rivera did not throw during the offseason, unlike previous years. His 2005 season began {{on a low}} note. After missing time in spring training with elbow <b>bursitis,</b> he blew his first two save opportunities of the season against the Red Sox, marking four consecutive blown opportunities against Boston {{dating back to the}} previous postseason. Fans at Yankee Stadium booed Rivera, and baseball journalists speculated if his days as a dominant pitcher were over. He was subsequently cheered by Red Sox fans during pre-game introductions at Fenway Park the following week, in recognition of his struggles against the Red Sox. He responded to the ovation {{with a sense of humor}} by tipping his cap to the crowd.|$|E
25|$|An {{inflamed}} bursa {{is called}} <b>bursitis.</b> Tendinitis and impingement syndrome are {{often accompanied by}} inflammation of the bursa sacs that protect the shoulder. Inflammation caused by a disease such as rheumatoid arthritis may cause rotator cuff tendinitis and <b>bursitis.</b> Sports involving overuse of the shoulder and occupations requiring frequent overhead reaching are other potential causes of irritation to the rotator cuff or bursa and may lead to inflammation and impingement.|$|E
25|$|Ultrasound during hip motion may {{visualize}} tendon subluxation and any accompanying <b>bursitis</b> {{when evaluating}} for iliopsoas involvement in medial extra-articular cases.|$|E
25|$|Ultrasound scans are {{frequently}} used to confirm a suspected tendinitis or <b>bursitis</b> {{as well as}} rule out a tear in the rotator cuff muscles.|$|E
25|$|On April 27, placed RHP Stephen Fife on the 15-day {{disabled}} list with right shoulder <b>bursitis,</b> retroactive to April 22, and recalled RHP Matt Magill from AAA Albuquerque.|$|E
25|$|On July 8, placed OF Matt Kemp (acromioclavicular joint {{irritation}} in {{his left}} shoulder) and RHP Stephen Fife (right shoulder <b>bursitis)</b> on the 15-day disabled list, recalled OF Scott Van Slyke from AAA Albuquerque, and activated RHP Ricky Nolasco.|$|E
25|$|Less commonly, the iliopsoas tendon {{catches on}} the {{anterior}} inferior iliac spine (AIIS), the lesser trochanter, or the iliopectineal ridge during hip extension, as the tendon moves from an anterior lateral (front, side) to a posterior medial (back, middle) position. With overuse, the resultant friction may eventually cause painful symptoms, resulting in muscle trauma, <b>bursitis,</b> or inflammation in the area.|$|E
25|$|If pain is relieved, {{the test}} is {{considered}} positive for rotator-cuff impingement, of which tendinitis and <b>bursitis</b> are major causes. However, partial rotator-cuff tears may also demonstrate good pain relief, so a positive response cannot rule out a partial rotator-cuff tear. However, with demonstration of good, pain-free function, treatment will not change, so {{the test is}} useful in helping to avoid overtesting or unnecessary surgery.|$|E
25|$|Cartilage erosion may {{progress}} {{to the point}} that the bone underneath will become exposed. With the cartilage no longer present to protect it, the navicular bursa and DDF tendon may become damaged by the constant rubbing against the navicular bone. Navicular <b>bursitis</b> (inflammation of the navicular bursa) may occur, even if cartilage damage is not severe. This is probably due to the friction between the navicular bone and the DDF tendon from compression.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that no single physical examination test distinguishes reliably between <b>bursitis,</b> partial-thickness, and full-thickness tears. On the contrary, a combination of tests seems to provide the most accurate diagnosis. For impingement, these tests include the Hawkins-Kennedy impingement sign in which the examiner medially rotates the patient's flexed arm, forcing the supraspinatus tendon against the coracoacromial ligament and so producing pain if the test is positive a positive painful arc sign, and weakness in external rotation with the arm at the side.|$|E
25|$|Signs {{of these}} {{conditions}} include the slow onset of discomfort and pain in the upper shoulder or upper third of the arm and/or difficulty sleeping on the shoulder. Tendinitis and <b>bursitis</b> also cause pain when the arm is lifted {{away from the body}} or overhead. If tendinitis involves the biceps tendon (the tendon located in front of the shoulder that helps bend the elbow and turn the forearm), pain will occur in the front or side of the shoulder and may travel down to the elbow and forearm. Pain may also occur when the arm is forcefully pushed upward overhead.|$|E
25|$|Musculoskeletal {{ultrasound}} {{has been}} advocated by experienced practitioners, avoiding the radiation of X-ray and {{the expense of}} MRI while demonstrating comparable accuracy to MRI for identifying and measuring the size of full-thickness and partial-thickness rotator cuff tears. This modality can also reveal {{the presence of other}} conditions that may mimic rotator cuff tear at clinical examination, including tendinosis, calcific tendinitis, subacromial subdeltoid <b>bursitis,</b> greater tuberosity fracture, and adhesive capsulitis. However, MRI provides more information about adjacent structures in the shoulder such as the capsule, glenoid labrum muscles and bone and these factors should be considered in each case when selecting the appropriate study.|$|E
25|$|A few {{patients}} {{who have had a}} hip replacement suffer chronic pain after the surgery. Groin pain can develop if the muscle that raises the hip (iliopsoas) rubs against the edge of the acetabular cup. <b>Bursitis</b> can develop at the trochanter where a surgical scar crosses the bone, or if the femoral component used pushes the leg out to the side too far. Also some patients can experience pain in cold or damp weather. Incision made {{in the front of the}} hip (anterior approach) can cut a nerve running down the thigh leading to numbness in the thigh and occasionally chronic pain at the point where the nerve was cut (a neuroma).|$|E
25|$|By {{the age of}} 41 he had {{declined}} so far in health that his arms were {{by his own admission}} thin and weak. He suffered from <b>bursitis,</b> possibly aggravated by faulty treatment, arthritis, dermatitis, cirrhosis of the liver, and kidney disease, as well as developing, by his mid-forties, a pronounced limp. How much of this was due to his intake of alcohol is impossible to ascertain, according to Bragg, because of Burton's reluctance to be treated for alcohol addiction. In 1974 Burton spent six weeks in a clinic to recuperate from a period during which he had drunk three bottles of vodka a day. He was also a chain smoker, with an intake of between three and five packs a day for most of his adult life. Health issues continued to plague him until his death of a stroke at the age of 58.|$|E
25|$|However, {{given the}} very real {{possibility}} of a limp, constant and/or debilitating pain, complicated treatment and impaired mobility later in life, careful developmental monitoring is indicated and early intervention is often the result. The worst possible consequence of non treatment is developing early arthritis, sometimes even during teenage years. All treatment aims to delay the onset of arthritis, but no treatment is fully successful in avoiding it; and, all available treatments bear the risk of inflicting equivalent damage. Most unfortunately, studies have as yet {{been unable to find}} a method of predicting outcomes in either the surgical/orthopedic treatment of the condition in infants and young children, or the surgical treatment of these early treatments' negative outcomes later in life (such as arthritis, avascular necrosis, trochanteric <b>bursitis,</b> and bone spurs of up to 2cm just medial of the gluteus maximus insertion point on the greater trochanter due to excessive friction).|$|E
25|$|In 2002, Ferrero {{missed the}} Australian Open due to <b>bursitis</b> {{in his right}} knee. He started his year at the Milan Indoor, but was upset by {{eventual}} champion Davide Sanguinetti 6–3, 6–7(0–7), 4–6 in the second round. He then represented Spain {{in the first round}} Davis Cup tie against Morocco, he went to win one against Hicham Arazi 6–3, 6–1, 6–2 and lost one to Younes El Aynaoui 6–7(2–7), 0–6, 6–3, 6–0, 3–6. He made his first quarterfinal of the year at the Open 13, but was upset by world no. 99 Cédric Pioline 7–6(3–7), 4–6, 5–7. At the ABN AMRO World Tennis Tournament, he lost in his opening match against eventual champion Nicolas Escudé 7–5, 1–6, 0–6. As the defending champion at the Dubai Tennis Championships, he retired in his second-round match 1–2 down against Younes El Aynaoui with a pulled abductor. His form continued to dip with a couple of early exits: In {{the first round of the}} Pacific Life Open to Greg Rusedski, 4–6, 3–6, in the third round of the NASDAQ–100 Open to Adrian Voinea 6–7(6–8), 6–1, 2–6, and in the second round of the Estoril Open to David Nalbandian, 6–4, 4–6, 6–7(7–4).|$|E
500|$|The {{family moved}} to {{affluent}} Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, around 1953. [...] In 1953, Lenore suffered another health crisis when a blood transfusion of the wrong type put her life in danger, but she recovered. [...] In 1954, George was named president and chairman of American Motors Corporation. [...] During this time a bad attack of <b>bursitis</b> left her with no movement in her left arm for five years, {{and the rest of}} the family took up her chores. [...] The couple spent summers at a cottage on the Canadian shore of Lake Huron. [...] A slipped disk suffered there gave her further trouble, and that and the <b>bursitis</b> caused her to switch from golf to swimming as her main exercise.|$|E
500|$|Opinions vary as {{to which}} {{treatment}} options are most effective for septic prepatellar <b>bursitis.</b> McAfee and Smith recommend a course of oral antibiotics, usually oxacillin sodium or cephradine, and assert that surgery and drainage are unnecessary. Wilson-MacDonald argues that oral antibiotics are [...] "inadequate", and recommends intravenous antibiotics for managing the infection. Some authors suggest surgical irrigation of the bursa {{by means of a}} subcutaneous tube. Others suggest that bursectomy may be necessary for intractable cases; the operation is an outpatient procedure that can be performed in less than half an hour.|$|E
500|$|This {{account was}} {{challenged}} {{by a series}} of writers and journalists from the mid-1970s onwards. Writing in 1974, Evans noted that the Veterans Administration had confirmed that (even at that late stage in his life) Hubbard [...] "receives $160 a month in compensation for disabilities incurred during the Second World War. However the conditions listed as being '40% disabling' are: duodenal ulcer, <b>bursitis</b> (right shoulder), arthritis, and blepharoconjunctivitis." [...] Evans noted: [...] "a Navy Department spokesman has stated that 'an examination of Mr Hubbard's record does not reveal any evidence of injuries suffered while {{in the service of the}} United States Navy'." ...|$|E
500|$|Lenore {{continued}} to have health difficulties, visiting medical centers around the country but unable to get a clear diagnosis. One specialist attributed her problems to a failure to absorb sufficient calcium, for which she was given once-a-week shots. She {{was found to have}} several food allergies and spent time at Chicago's Swedish Covenant Hospital in 1967. [...] She suffered an injury outside her house around 1967 and another the next year when she fell and suffered a shoulder dislocation that turned into <b>bursitis.</b> [...] During October 1968 she was hospitalized at Barnes-Jewish Hospital in St. Louis, seeing a bone and mineral specialist.|$|E
500|$|His {{medical records}} state {{that he was}} hospitalized with an acute {{duodenal}} ulcer rather than a war injury. He told his doctors that {{he was suffering from}} lameness caused by a hip infection and he told Look magazine in December 1950 that he had suffered from [...] "ulcers, conjunctivitis, deteriorating eyesight, <b>bursitis</b> and something wrong with my feet". He was still complaining in 1951 of eye problems and stomach pains, which had given him [...] "continuous trouble" [...] for eight years, especially when [...] "under nervous stress". This came well after Hubbard had promised that Dianetics would provide [...] "a cure for the very ailments that plagued the author himself then and throughout his life, including allergies, arthritis, ulcers and heart problems".|$|E
