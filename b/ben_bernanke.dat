40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to empirically examine the effect on US stock, bond and real estate {{investment}} trust (REIT) prices triggered by the US Federal Reserve Chairman <b>Ben</b> <b>Bernanke’s</b> announcement of a possible intent to unwind, or taper, quantitative easing (QE). In particular, the author assessed whether the effect of the “Taper Tantrum” was fundamental or financial on financial markets. Design/methodology/approach – The methodology used to determine whether the effect of the “Taper Tantrum” was fundamental or purely financial is that suggested by French and Roll (1986) as extended by Tuluca et al. (2003). The analysis is based on daily data for large cap stocks, small cap stocks, long-term bonds and REITs for 18 months before <b>Ben</b> <b>Bernanke’s</b> announcement and for 18 months after the announcement. Findings – The results show that the “Taper Tantrum” had a fundamental, rather than a financial effect on all asset classes, especially so for REITs. Practical implications – The author also found that in the post-taper period following <b>Ben</b> <b>Bernanke’s</b> announcement the correlation of REITs with stocks decreased compared with pre-taper period, whereas the correlation of REITS with bonds increased substantially. In other words, the “Taper Tantrum” had a profound effect on the risk/return benefits of including REITs in the US mixed-asset portfolio. Originality/value – This is the first paper to examine the effect of the “Taper Tantrum” on REITs...|$|R

25|$|The {{causes of}} the Great Recession seem similar to the Great Depression, but {{significant}} differences exist. The previous chairman of the Federal Reserve, <b>Ben</b> <b>Bernanke,</b> had extensively studied the Great Depression {{as part of his}} doctoral work at MIT, and implemented policies to manipulate the money supply and interest rates in ways that were not done in the 1930s. Bernanke's policies will undoubtedly be analyzed and scrutinized in the years to come, as economists debate the wisdom of his choices. Generally speaking, the recovery of the world's financial systems tended to be quicker during the Great Depression of the 1930s as opposed to the late-2000s recession.|$|E

The financial system was nearly frozen, as the equivalent of a bank run on the essentially unregulated, non-depository shadow banking system was in-progress. <b>Ben</b> <b>Bernanke</b> later stated that 12 of the 13 largest U.S. financial institutions were at risk of failure during the crisis.|$|E
