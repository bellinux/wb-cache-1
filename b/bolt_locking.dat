25|$|The rotary <b>bolt</b> <b>locking</b> {{mechanism}} {{consists of}} two steel locking lugs that engage locking recesses in the breech, and is identical to that used in the SG 540. A spring-loaded extractor is incorporated into the bolt while a fixed protrusion {{on one of the}} receiver's internal guide rails ejects the spent cartridge casings.|$|E
2500|$|The weapon's only safety was the hinged {{ejection}} port dust cover. [...] This cover had {{a projection}} {{on the underside}} that engaged a notch on the <b>bolt,</b> <b>locking</b> it in either its forward or rearmost positions. The M3 had no mechanical means of disabling the trigger, and the insertion of a loaded magazine would load the gun. [...] With receiver walls made of relatively thin-gauge sheet metal, the M3/M3A1 were subject to disabling damage if dropped on an open dust cover - the covers bent easily, negating the safety feature. [...] Dropping the gun on a sharp or hard surface could dent the receiver enough to bind the bolt.|$|E

50|$|The AR-10 is a lightweight, air-cooled, magazine-fed, gas-operated rifle {{that uses}} a piston within the bolt carrier with a rotary <b>bolt</b> <b>locking</b> mechanism. The rifle has a {{conventional}} layout; it features an in-line stock, an aluminum alloy receiver and a reinforced fiberglass pistol grip, handguard, and buttstock. While mostly an original design, the AR-10 built upon previously proven concepts. From the FAL it took the hinged receiver system allowing the rifle to be opened for cleaning much like a break-action shotgun. The ejection port cover {{is similar to that}} found on the German World War II-era StG44. The <b>bolt</b> <b>locking</b> mechanism is similar to the M1941 Johnson rifle (itself an adaptation of the Browning-designed Remington Model 8 bolt). From the German FG 42 and M1941 Johnson machine gun came the idea of straight-line stocks to reduce muzzle climb in fully automatic fire. The AR-10's method of rotary <b>bolt</b> <b>locking,</b> straight-line recoil, and gas operation enhanced its inherent accuracy.|$|E
50|$|The OTs-14-4A is a {{small arms}} weapon system based on the 5.45×39mm AKS-74U carbine. It is a {{selective}} fire, air-cooled magazine-fed rifle with a gas-actuated piston operating system and a rotary <b>bolt</b> <b>locking</b> mechanism.|$|E
5000|$|The shotgun has a {{relatively}} small number of component parts, incorporating a simple operating principle. The main features of the mechanism are the turning block <b>bolt</b> <b>locking</b> system and the cartridge feeding system (cut off).|$|E
50|$|A dead bolt, {{deadbolt}} or {{dead lock}} is a locking mechanism distinct from a spring <b>bolt</b> <b>lock</b> because a deadbolt cannot {{be moved to}} the open position except by rotating the lock cylinder with the key. The more common spring <b>bolt</b> <b>lock</b> uses a spring to hold the bolt in place, allowing retraction by applying force to the bolt itself. A deadbolt can therefore make a door more resistant to entry without the correct key.|$|R
5000|$|The Model 660, {{along with}} many Model 600s was {{affected}} by a recall in 1979 to remedy {{a problem with the}} <b>bolt</b> <b>lock</b> safety that under certain circumstances allowed accidental discharge. https://www.remington.com/support/safety-center/safety-modification-program/remington-model-600-660 ...|$|R
50|$|The rifle uses bolt action: a {{rotating}} <b>bolt</b> <b>locks</b> the cartridge in the chamber, closes bore, ignites the cartridge, and ejects the spent cartridge. Lugs are missing; locking is {{performed on the}} charging handle.|$|R
50|$|DuBiel rifles were {{constructed}} using only patented DuBiel actions which feature a five lug <b>bolt</b> <b>locking</b> mechanism {{resulting in a}} 36 degree bolt rotation. The short rotation produced the fastest bolt-action rifle available at the time. The actions were produced in three lengths, both right and left hand configurations.|$|E
50|$|The pistol is {{equipped}} with a self-cocking trigger hammer type double-acting SA/DA. The design provides slide catch holding the bolt after firing the last bullet in the rearward position. Blowback action (no barrel grip with a <b>bolt,</b> <b>locking</b> the barrel reached the mass closure and force the return spring).|$|E
50|$|The shotgun has a {{relatively}} small number of component parts, incorporating a simple operating principle. The main features of the mechanism are the turning block <b>bolt</b> <b>locking</b> system and the cartridge feeding system (cut off). These serve to make the Raffaello CrioComfort reliable and practical, easy to strip and maintain.|$|E
50|$|The Model 31 {{was later}} {{used as a}} basis for the Mossberg 500 and related shotguns. The Mossberg is {{simplified}} and cheaper to produce. Notable differences are the use of a two-piece <b>bolt</b> with separate <b>locking</b> piece as well as a significantly simplified barrel mounting system. Further, the <b>bolt</b> <b>locks</b> into a barrel extension rather than directly to the receiver.|$|R
50|$|The RK 95 TP is a select-fire, gas-operated firearm {{using the}} Kalashnikov-pattern {{operating}} {{system with a}} long stroke gas piston rod coupled to the bolt carrier as in the AK rifle. The rotating <b>bolt</b> <b>locks</b> into battery via two locking lugs.|$|R
50|$|The MR1 Storm {{has nine}} {{attachment}} points for slings to accommodate multiple carry options. It {{does not require}} tools for disassembly. When the last round fires, the <b>bolt</b> <b>locks</b> to the rear. A ghost ring sight, adjustable for windage and elevation, is standard.|$|R
50|$|It has a picatinny railing on the {{receiver}} to allow the installations of weapon sights like reflex sights with iron sights built into the railing. The weapon fires in a gas operated mode, utilizing rotary <b>bolt</b> <b>locking</b> and a gas piston. The MSMC can also be suppressed with the installation of a silencer.|$|E
50|$|The rotary <b>bolt</b> <b>locking</b> {{mechanism}} {{consists of}} two steel locking lugs that engage locking recesses in the breech, and is identical to that used in the SG 540. A spring-loaded extractor is incorporated into the bolt while a fixed protrusion {{on one of the}} receiver's internal guide rails ejects the spent cartridge casings.|$|E
5000|$|The DIO {{promotes}} the KH2002 as a [...] "low-recoil, highly accurate, lightweight" [...] weapon, with [...] "modular construction for easy maintenance" [...] and a rotating <b>bolt</b> <b>locking</b> mechanism, presumably designed to facilitate ambidextrous firing, protected under a carrying handle {{that contains the}} rear sight. The carrying handle {{can also be used}} to mount optical or night sights.|$|E
25|$|The bolt in the <b>bolt</b> <b>lock</b> is a {{rectangle}} of metal that is constrained to slide only back and forward. When the knife is open a spring biases the bolt to the forward position where it rests above the tang {{of the blade}} preventing the blade from closing. Small knobs extend through {{the handle of the}} knife on both sides allowing the user to slide the bolt backwards freeing the knife to close. The Axis Lock used by knife maker Benchmade is functionally identical to the <b>bolt</b> <b>lock</b> except that it uses a cylinder rather than {{a rectangle}} to trap the blade. The Arc Lock by knife maker SOG is similar to the Axis Lock except the cylinder follows a curved path rather than a straight path.|$|R
2500|$|Behind {{the bolt}} carrier is a plastic or metal buffer, which rests {{in line with}} a return spring. The buffer spring begins to push the bolt carrier and bolt back toward the chamber once it is {{compressed}} sufficiently. A groove machined into the upper receiver guides the bolt cam pin and prevents it and the bolt from rotating into a closed position. The <b>bolt's</b> <b>locking</b> lugs push a fresh round from the magazine as the bolt moves forward. The round is guided by feed ramps into the chamber. As the <b>bolt's</b> <b>locking</b> lugs move past the barrel extension, the cam pin twists into a pocket milled into the upper receiver. This twisting action follows the groove cut into the carrier and forces the bolt to twist and [...] "lock" [...] into the barrel extension.|$|R
50|$|The company's history {{dates back}} to 1926, when William F. Banham invented the first {{automatic}} latch <b>bolt</b> <b>lock</b> {{after a series of}} burglaries on his wife's dress shop. He opened his own locksmith shop on Oxford Street, London, and offered £25 to anyone who could pick or break one of his patented locks.|$|R
50|$|The Mini-Beryl’s design {{combines}} features {{from both}} the wz. 1989 Onyks carbine and the wz. 1996 Beryl rifle; the principal components that were modified include the barrel, barrel trunnion, upper and lower handguards, muzzle device and magazine. The weapon’s method of operation, the rotary <b>bolt</b> <b>locking</b> mechanism and ammunition are identical {{to those of the}} wz. 1996 Beryl standard rifle.|$|E
5000|$|The HK416 is {{equipped}} with a proprietary accessory rail forearm with MIL-STD-1913 rails on all four sides. This lets most current accessories for M4/M16-type weapons fit the HK416. The HK416 rail forearm can be installed and removed without tools by using the <b>bolt</b> <b>locking</b> lug as the screwdriver. The rail forearm is [...] "free-floating" [...] and does not contact the barrel, improving accuracy.|$|E
50|$|The Fedorov Avtomat is a short-recoil operated, locked-breech weapon which fires from {{a closed}} bolt. The <b>bolt</b> <b>locking</b> is {{achieved}} by two dumbbell-shaped locking plates, mounted at {{either side of the}} breech, latching barrel and bolt together through lugs on the bolt. Those plates are allowed to tilt slightly down after about 10 mm of free recoil, unlocking the bolt. A bolt hold-open device is fitted and the firing mechanism is of hammer type.|$|E
30|$|Nail failure {{has been}} {{reported}} by Gonschorek et al. and Wolinsky et al. [17, 37], {{but the majority of}} studies report failures of the <b>locking</b> <b>bolts.</b> Twenty-eight distal <b>locking</b> <b>bolt</b> breakages were experienced, the majority of them during {{the first part of the}} study [45]. This led to discontinuation of the use of cannulated <b>locking</b> <b>bolts</b> and a policy to insert both bolts in all static nailing procedures. In addition, in severely comminuted fractures and overweight patients, the weight bearing protocol was altered.|$|R
50|$|Long recoil {{operation}} is found primarily in shotguns, particularly ones based on John Browning's Auto-5 action. In a long recoil action the barrel and <b>bolt</b> remain <b>locked</b> together during recoil, compressing the recoil springs. Following this rearward movement, the <b>bolt</b> <b>locks</b> {{to the rear}} and the barrel is forced forward by its spring. The bolt is held in position until the barrel returns completely forward during which time the spent cartridge has been extracted and ejected, and a new shell has been positioned from the magazine. The bolt is released and forced closed by its recoil spring, chambering a fresh round.|$|R

50|$|The pistol is {{manually}} operated using a rotary <b>bolt,</b> <b>locking</b> with two lugs. Loading is performed with a pull/push action using the round knurled knob {{to the rear}} of the weapon. The trigger is single stage with a simple safety at the back of the magazine housing. The detachable single stack magazine contains six or eight rounds (depending on calibre) and serves as a pistol grip with the bottom part enclosed into the plastic cover.|$|E
50|$|The Zastava M21 is gas {{operated}} with a rotating <b>bolt</b> <b>locking</b> system. It features a hard chromium-plated, cold forged standard rifled or an optional polygonal rifled barrel, integrated 22mm flash hider grenade launcher, rigid polymer folding stock, heavy-duty synthetic handguard {{with an additional}} left hand side fire selector, cover mounted picatinny rail for optical sights. The rifle can also mount a 40mm under-barrel grenade launcher. It has a magazine capacity of 30 rounds. The cyclic rate of fire is 680 rounds per minute, and the sustained rate of fire is 120 rounds/min.|$|E
50|$|Mannlicher {{designed}} two semi-automatic rifles both called Model 93, {{one based}} on his turn-bolt rifle and the other based on his straight-pull rifle. The rifles had a recoil spring housing behind the bolt and the <b>bolt</b> <b>locking</b> lugs were angled, so the bolt started turning on firing, essentially a hesitation lock or delayed blowback much like the later Thompson Autorifle utilising the Blish lock. In this system there was no recoiling barrel nor gas piston as with other rifle-caliber autoloading designs, so the mechanism was simple, but ejection of fired cartridge casings was so fierce as to be hazardous to bystanders.|$|E
