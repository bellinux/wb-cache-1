5000|$|After <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> is {{initially}} {{inserted into the}} jig, the middle roller is manually lowered and forced against <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> with a screw arrangement. This causes <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> to undergo both plastic and elastic deformation.

[...] The rollers are then rotated moving <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> along with them. For each new position, the portion of <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> between <b>the</b> rollers takes on the shape of a cubic modified by the end conditions imposed by the adjacent sections of <b>the</b> <b>bar.</b> When either end of <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> is reached, <b>the</b> force applied to the center roller is incrementally increased, the roller rotation is reversed and as the rolling process proceeds, <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> shape becomes a better approximation to a circular arc, gradually, for the number of passes required to bring the arc of <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> to <b>the</b> desired radius.|$|R
