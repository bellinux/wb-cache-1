5|$|On September 26, Anderson {{and his men}} reached Monroe County, Missouri, and {{traveled}} towards Paris, but learned of other nearby guerrillas and rendezvoused with them near Audrain County. Anderson and his men camped with at least 300 men, including Todd. Although {{a large group of}} guerrillas was assembled, their leaders felt that there were no promising targets to attack, <b>because</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the large towns nearby were heavily guarded.|$|E
5|$|<b>Because</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> Germany's {{powerful}} dreadnoughts {{had either}} been scuttled in Scapa Flow or ceded to the Allies as war prizes, the Braunschweig-class battleships were recommissioned into the newly reorganized Reichsmarine. In {{the years following}} World War I, Braunschweig, Elsass, and Hessen were to be rebuilt as coastal defense ships, although this plan was abandoned. Braunschweig served in the Reichsmarine from 1921 to 1926, at which point she was withdrawn from active duty. On 31 May 1931, she was stricken and converted into a hulk at Wilhelmshaven, and eventually scrapped. Elsass saw active duty in the fleet from 1924 until 25 February 1930, at which point she was removed from active service. On 31 March 1931, she was stricken, hulked in Wilhelmshaven. On 31 October 1935, Elsass was sold to Norddeutscher-Lloyd in Bremerhaven, and scrapped in 1936.|$|E
5|$|Washington {{ordered his}} men to build {{earthworks}} that were parallel to the south bank of the Assunpink Creek southeast of Trenton proper (near the modern location of the Trenton Transit Center). The lines extended about three miles (4.8km) down {{the south end of}} the stream. However, one of Washington's aides, Joseph Reed, pointed out that there were fords up stream that the British could cross, and then they would be in position to drive in Washington's right flank. Washington could not escape across the Delaware <b>because</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> his boats were a few miles upstream. Washington told his officers that he planned to move the army and that their current position was only temporary.|$|E

5|$|Broaches {{are shaped}} {{similar to a}} saw, except {{the height of the}} teeth {{increases}} over the length of the tool. Moreover, the broach contains three distinct sections: one for roughing, another for semi-finishing, and the final one for finishing. Broaching is an unusual machining process because it has the feed built into the tool. The profile of the machined surface is always the inverse of the profile of the broach. The rise per tooth (RPT), also known as the step or feed per tooth, determines the amount of material removed {{and the size of the}} chip. The broach can be moved relative to the workpiece or vice versa. <b>Because</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the features are built into the broach, no complex motion or skilled labor is required to use it. A broach is effectively a collection of single-point cutting tools arrayed in sequence, cutting one after the other; its cut is analogous to multiple passes of a shaper.|$|E
5|$|No {{sooner had}} Bryan left the state than Governor Bradley {{reversed}} course and began stumping for Taylor. Though he insisted he {{only wanted to}} defend his administration from Democratic attacks, Louisville Courier-Journal editor Henry Watterson suggested that Bradley was seeking to enlist Taylor's support for his anticipated senatorial bid. Bradley kicked off his tour {{of the state in}} Louisville, charging that Democrats had to import an orator for their candidate <b>because</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the state's best men had deserted him. As evidence, he cited Goebel's lack of support from Democrat John G. Carlisle, his former ally, as well as Senator William Lindsay, W. C. P. Breckinridge, John Y. Brown, Theodore Hallum, W. C. Owens, Wat Hardin, and William Stone. He also encouraged blacks not to desert the Republican Party. He contrasted his appointments of blacks to his cabinet with the Democrats' support of the Separate Coach Bill. Bradley and Republican leader (and later governor) Augustus E. Willson toured the state on behalf of the Republican ticket, often drawing crowds larger than those assembled for Taylor.|$|E

25|$|After {{temporary}} repairs were completed, {{the ship}} continued its {{journey through the}} Panama Canal to the Brooklyn Navy Yard, New York, where she arrived on 28 April 1945. She had to steam to the East Coast of the United States for repairs in New York <b>because</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the repair shipyards on the West Coast were heavily overloaded with American warships that had been damaged by Japanese kamikazes.|$|E
25|$|An {{element is}} a {{chemical}} substance {{made up of}} a particular kind of atom and hence cannot be broken down or transformed by a chemical reaction into a different element, though it can be transmuted into another element through a nuclear reaction. This is so, <b>because</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the atoms in a sample of an element have the same number of protons, though they may be different isotopes, with differing numbers of neutrons.|$|E
25|$|Some western countries, {{including}} the United Kingdom, extend copyright protection to typeface designs. However, this has {{no impact on}} protection in the United States, <b>because</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the major copyright treaties and agreements to which the U.S. is a party (such as the Berne Convention, the WIPO Copyright Treaty, and TRIPS) operate under the principle of national treatment, under which a country is obligated to provide no greater or lesser protection to works from other countries than it provides to domestically produced works.|$|E

25|$|Lomatia tasmanica, {{commonly}} known as King's lomatia, is a shrub from the family Proteaceae native to Tasmania. Growing up to 8 m tall, the plant has shiny green pinnate (lobed) leaves and bears red flowers in the summer, but yields neither fruit nor seeds. King's lomatia is unusual <b>because</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the remaining plants are genetically identical. Because it has three sets of chromosomes (a triploid) and is therefore sterile, reproduction occurs only vegetatively: when a branch falls, that branch grows new roots, establishing a new plant that is genetically identical to its parent.|$|E
25|$|The median wasp, as in {{all other}} Hymenoptera species, {{produces}} females from fertilized diploid eggs, but males are produced from unfertilized haploid eggs. This means that although workers are unable to mate they can still produce male offspring. This type of sex determination is known as haplodiploidy. The result is that brothers have a relatedness of 0.5 as expected of full siblings, but sisters have a higher relatedness of 0.75. Sisters receive half of their mother’s genes {{as well as all}} their father’s genes <b>because</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the sperm he produces are identical. Mothers have a relatedness of 0.5 to both their sons and daughters.|$|E
25|$|The Jin were {{succeeded by}} a series of {{short-lived}} dynasties: Liu Song (420–479), Southern Qi (479–502), Liang (502–557) and Chen (557–589). <b>Because</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> these dynasties had their capital at Jiankang except Liang, they are sometimes grouped together with Eastern Wu and Eastern Jin as the Six Dynasties. The rulers of these short-lived dynasties were generals who seized and then held power for several decades but were unable to securely pass power of rule onto their heirs to continue their dynasty successfully. Emperor Wu of Liang (502–549) was the most notable ruler of his age, being a patron of the arts and of Buddhism.|$|E

25|$|Russian {{policy was}} to {{pressure}} the Serbs to accept the ultimatum {{as much as possible}} without being humiliated too much. Russia was anxious to avoid a war because the Great Military Programme was not to be completed until 1917, and Russia was otherwise not ready for war. <b>Because</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> France’s leaders, including President Poincaré and René Viviani, were at sea on the battleship France, returning from the summit in St. Petersburg, the acting head of the French government, Jean-Baptiste Bienvenu-Martin took no line on the ultimatum. In addition, the Germans jammed the radio messages, at least garbling contacts between the ship-borne French leaders and Paris, and possibly blocking them completely.|$|E
25|$|The {{entire process}} from initial {{notification}} until a unit is dispatched {{can take up}} to two (2) minutes, depending on the complexity of the call, the information provided by the caller(s) and the degree of other alarm activity in the office. If a dispatch office is so busy that its incoming telephone alarm lines are all busy or not answered within 30 seconds, the call is automatically transferred to another borough dispatch office. If an Emergency Reporting System (ERS) street fire alarm box is not answered with 60 seconds, usually <b>because</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the alarm receipt consoles are in use, the computer automatically dispatches an engine company to the location of the physical street fire alarm box.|$|E
25|$|According to Chris Horwill (AREVA T) {{there are}} four main design ratings in the de-icer mode. The first one is the Standard de-icer mode. It works at 250MW and 7200A from ±17.4kV at 10°C. The second one is the Verification mode. It works at 200MW and 5760A from ±17.4kV at 30°C.The third one is the 1-hour overload. This one works at 300MW and 7200A from ±20.8kV at 10°C. The last one is the Low ambient overload. It works at 275MW and 7920A from ±17.4kV at -5°C. KV is the voltage and A is the currents.

25|$|The purchasers of the Richmond and Danville Railroad {{rejected}} the lease of the Richmond, York River and Chesapeake Railroad <b>because</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> {{the stock of}} that company had been deposited with the Richmond Terminal Reorganization Committee. This permitted the committee to convey the Richmond, York River and Chesapeake Railroad line between Richmond, Virginia and West Point, Virginia and the company's 1,251 shares of the Baltimore, Chesapeake and Richmond Steamboat Company to Southern Railway Company on June 28, 1894 in consideration of the assumption by Southern Railway Company of the Richmond, York River and Chesapeake mortgage debt. Southern Railway Company began operations of the former Richmond and Danville Railroad Company lines, including the former Richmond, York River and Chesapeake Railroad line, on July 1, 1894.|$|E
25|$|Late in his life, Dönitz {{made every}} attempt to answer {{correspondence}} and autograph postcards for others. Dönitz was unrepentant regarding his role in World War II, as he firmly believed that he had acted at all times out of duty to his nation. He also maintained the belief that to betray military secrets, even when working with the enemy, is a despicable act of treachery; he was firmly convinced that nobody should or would respect an individual who did not share such a conviction. The West German government argued he should receive only the pension pay of a captain <b>because</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> his advances in rank after that had been because of Hitler, but he won a court case demanding the pension for his final rank.|$|E
25|$|Scholars {{had thought}} that invaders {{attacked}} {{the city in the}} 7th or 8th century, sacking and burning it. More recent evidence, however, seems to indicate that the burning was limited to the structures and dwellings associated primarily with the ruling class. Some think this suggests that the burning was from an internal uprising. They say the invasion theory is flawed because early archaeological work on the city was focused exclusively on the palaces and temples, places used by the upper classes. <b>Because</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> these sites showed burning, archaeologists concluded that the whole city was burned. Instead, it is now known that the destruction was centered on major civic structures along the Avenue of the Dead. Some statues seem to have been destroyed methodically, with their fragments dispersed.|$|E
