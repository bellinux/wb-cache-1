40|$|The {{creation}} {{process in}} design can be artificially divided in two stages: an initial stage called Metaproject, which generates concepts, visions and scenarios, and the Project itself (Celaschi, 2007). This investigation aims to discuss some design {{strategies for the}} Metaproject stage focusing in the so called <b>blue</b> <b>sky</b> <b>research.</b> The <b>blue</b> <b>sky</b> <b>research</b> searches and organizes stimuli (in many different formats) aiming to obtain indications {{of what could be}} some possible scenarios for the construction of answers to design problems. We work with lateral thinking, visual thinking and analogical reasoning to try to identify how visual images are part of this creative strategy.

50|$|Support for <b>blue</b> <b>skies</b> <b>research</b> has varied over time, {{ultimately}} becoming {{subject to}} the political process, {{in countries such as}} the United States, the United Kingdom, and India. Vannevar Bush's 1945 report, Science: The Endless Frontier, made the argument for the value of basic research in the postwar era, and was the basis for many appeals to the federal funding of basic research. The 1957 launch of Sputnik prompted the United States Air Force Office of Scientific <b>Research</b> to sponsor <b>blue</b> <b>skies</b> <b>research</b> into the 1960s. By the 1970s, financial strains brought pressure on public expenditure on the sciences, first in the UK and the Netherlands, and by the 1990s in Germany and the United States.|$|R

40|$|I enjoy {{research}}. My research goal is {{to tackle}} problems afflicting the Internet. The explosive growth {{in the size of}} the Internet over the past couple of decades has meant that many of the assumptions that the Internet design is based on no longer hold true. This has led to a plethora of problems and has made it imperative that we rethink such assumptions and the concomitant design decisions. However, the tremendous success of the Internet has also been a bane for Internet research. It is difficult, if not impossible, to expect a wholesale change in Internet infrastructure. Throughout my graduate career, I have tried to stay cognizant of this ground truth and have strived to strike a balance between two competing urges regarding my research. On one hand is the freedom of doing <b>blue</b> <b>sky</b> <b>research</b> that openly questions the fundamentals underlying the Internet architecture in the face of new needs and challenges. For instance, as part of my dissertation I argue that the fact that the Internet and its precursors started off as simple research networks meant that “manageability ” was never a first-class design goal. Instead, humans operating the network were expected to delve into low-level network details in order to make it work. However, as the Internet becomes bigger and more complex, such an approach becomes intractable. Frustrated by the lamentable state-of-art in network management, I proposed and implemented CONMan [2, 5, 9], a cohesive architecture that leads to easy-tomanage and even largely self-managing networks. Similarly, my work on DefaultOff [10], a DoS-resilien...|$|E
40|$|Methods are {{developed}} for different audiences and purposes. HCI researchers develop methods {{to shape the}} future through pure, applied and <b>blue</b> <b>sky</b> <b>research</b> – as is still the case with most affective interactive applications. Unsurprisingly, practitioners will be more concerned that the methods they use not only are tractable but produce better and more innovative results {{in terms of the}} systems they ultimately release into the world. Researchers, on the other hand, may have other concerns, such as the novelty of their techniques. Up until recently, most HCI methods (both for researchers and practitioners) were developed for work applications and desktop situations. They focused on efficiency, learnability, transparency, control and other work-related values. They were developed in response to a theoretical orientation which viewed the user as an information processing system not so dissimilar to the computer itself. But now that HCI is concerned with technologies that enter all aspects of life, our methods have begun to change and will need to continue to change. In keeping with our changing conception of what a “user” is and a wider concern with their experience of use of new technologies, a key challenge will be to develop and expand methods for analyzing not just what people do with the technology but how it makes them feel, and not just how people understand technology but how they make sense of it as part of their lives. Methods must be concerned, not only with issues of usefulness and usability, but also with issues of aesthetics, expression, and emotion. In addition {{we need to focus on}} evaluating technology not just in the short term under controlled conditions but also in the longer term and in broader social and cultural contexts. In this section, we will therefore provide two strands of evaluation methods. The first concerns what we might see as more traditional usability evaluation: is my system usable for the purpose it was designed for? The second strand tries to get at what we have named “third wave of HCI” in the previous chapters: does my system provide for the kind of (emotional) experience that it aimed to do...|$|E

[...] Proponents of this mode of science argue that unanticipated scientific breakthroughs are sometimes more valuable than the outcomes of agenda-driven research, heralding advances in genetics and stem cell biology as examples of unforeseen benefits of research that was originally seen as purely theoretical in scope.

This research measures the effect of funding receipt from the New Zealand Marsden Fund using a unique dataset of funded and unfunded proposals that includes the evaluation scores assigned to all proposals. This allows us to control statistically for potential bias driven by the Fund’s efforts to fund projects that are expected to be successful, and also to measure the efficacy of the selection process itself. We find that Marsden Funding does increase the scientific output of the funded researchers, but that {{there is no evidence that}} the final selection process is able to meaningfully predict the likely success of different proposals...|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} be able to decide the {{priorities}} for government funding across all areas of scientific research, the Science & Technology Act of 1965 created the Science Research Council (SRC) which took over management of the Rutherford High Energy Laboratory from NIRNS along with many other previously disparate UK science bodies. In order to prioritise economic impact over <b>blue</b> <b>skies</b> <b>research,</b> the SRC became the Science and Engineering Research Council (SERC) in the early 1980s, and in 1994, the SERC was eventually divided into three Research Councils (the EPSRC, PPARC and the CCLRC — which took responsibility for RAL from EPSRC in 1995), so that each could then focus its development around one of three incompatible business models — administratively efficient short duration grant distribution, medium term commitments to international agreements, long term commitments to staff and facilities provision. In order to unify the planning of the provision for UK scientists to access large national and international facilities, in 2007 the CCLRC merged with PPARC and incorporated the nuclear physics discipline from EPSRC to create the Science and Technology Facilities Council which then took responsibility for RAL.|$|R
40|$|Across {{much of the}} Australian {{cultural}} sector, {{the principal}} mission of curatorship remains wedded {{to the production of}} site-specific physical exhibitions. This mission is entirely understandable when viewed through the tradition of ongoing cultural exhibition in well populated urban locations, yet sits less comfortably within the wide geographic distribution of the Australian population. Although a growing desire to reach wider audiences via an expanded online presence is evident, such initiatives are tempered by the prohibitive cost of digitising existing collections optimised for physical exhibition. Significant amounts [...] if not the majority [...] of compelling cultural content remain inaccessible to communities and the general public. Multi-Platform Communication Design is a design method which repurposes existing content across multiple communication channels in order to extend an audience experience across multiple target segments. Applied to the cultural institution sector, MPCD takes existing platform or site-specific artefacts to new, distributed audiences in a cost-effective manner. In so doing, MPCD can extend and increase the audience experience beyond current curatorial and audience expectations. The rationale behind MPCD lies neither in a technological orientation nor <b>blue</b> <b>skies</b> <b>research.</b> Rather, it is firmly focused in providing a tool whereby cultural institutions can reach a wider audience cost-effectively, and communities can not only access content more readily, they may also contribute to the creation of digital collections. This paper acknowledges the exciting potential of synchronous iTV/web broadcast and contributes to the developing multi-platform debate by defining outcomes for both consumers and producers and links this debate to the emerging concept of a 'cultural consumer' within this sector...|$|R
40|$|This {{report is}} the {{published}} {{product of a}} study by the British Geological Survey (BGS) to summarise: the current knowledge, monitoring and management of volcanic hazards in Tanzania; a preliminary fieldwork visit to Mt Meru to investigate opportunities for more detailed characterisation of Holocene volcanic activity; and scope out opportunities for research and collaboration on volcanic hazards in Tanzania. Whilst monitoring of activity, analysis of past activity, and characterisation of volcanic hazards and risk is being conducted in high-resolution in some countries, there are many which have little available data or resource to conduct such research. The East African Rift is one such example. This is a record of our first data collation for Tanzania to capture the current monitoring situation, knowledge of past eruptive activity and unrest, and in-country capacity for volcanic hazard management. The data has been collated for analysis and inclusion in the next Global Assessment Report to be published by the United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (UNISDR) in 2015 (GAR 15). The data summarised here will be presented as the Tanzanian Country Profile as part of the contributory papers for the GAR 15 report. We present the Mt Meru example here as a case study for potential research that BGS could conduct prior to the next GAR report due in 2017. This would have merit both as a <b>blue</b> <b>skies</b> <b>research</b> project, as Mt Meru hosts one of the largest debris avalanches on Earth, and as an applied hazard project supporting capacity development, as Meru shows recent volcanic activity that poses a threat to the large local population living in and around the volcano and tourists who visit this area in large numbers every year...|$|R
40|$|Leora Auslander writes that: “Human beings need {{objects to}} {{effectively}} remember and forget; {{and we need}} objects to cope with absence, with loss and with death. ” This text discusses the personal memories and thoughts about my own Jewish family history {{in the context of}} the holocaust, which are embedded in the design of a picture, embroidered in wool on canvas, that I made in the mid- 1990 s in memory of my great-grandmother, Anna Binderowska. The picture was displayed in the exhibition “Hand Made Tales,” curated by Carol Tulloch at the Women’s Library, Whitechapel, London in 2011, when I was also asked to lecture about it at the related conference. Anna, who married in 1864 and had a large number of children, lived and died in the poor Jewish district of the Polish city of Słonim, then in the Russian Pale of Settlement. Four of her children, including my grandfather, Morris, emigrated and settled in Manchester, England in the mid- 1890 s. Never having been to Słonim, I invented a naive, comforting, idyllic vision of Anna’s gravestone in the old Jewish cemetery in the town, under fallen leaves and a <b>blue</b> <b>sky.</b> <b>Researching</b> that cemetery’s specific history twenty years later for Carol Tulloch’s conference, I found that in July 1942, SS Brigadeführer Eric Naumann, in command of Himmler’s special SS Einsatzgruppen B battalion, reached Słonim. The little town became an infamous killing ground, a place of mass Jewish slaughter and destruction. As all over Poland, the town’s Jewish cemeteries, including Anna’s gravestone, were smashed one by one. This text reflects finally on the fact that Naumann was tried at the Nuremberg war crimes tribunal and executed in 1951. While he took no part in the Naumann trial, my father had been a member of the British prosecution team at Nuremburg and I realized that my embroidery had also been made in memory of my parents, my Jewish mother and my Welsh father...|$|R
40|$|The Author(s) 2014. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract This paper {{reflects on the}} relationship between theory and practice in bioethics, by using various concepts drawn from debates on innovation in healthcare research—in particular debates around how best to connect up <b>blue</b> <b>skies</b> ‘basic’ <b>research</b> with practical innovations that can improve human lives. It argues that {{it is a mistake to}} assume that the most difficult and important questions in bioethics are cases will automatically be of much help in getting clear about more complex cases. It replaces this implicitly linear model with a more complex one that draws on the idea of translational research in healthcare. On the translational model, there is a continuum of cases from the most simple and abstract (thought experiments) to the most concrete and complex (real world cases). Insights need to travel in both directions along this continuum—from the more abstract to the more concrete and from the more concrete to the more abstract. The paper maps out some difficulties in moving from simpler to more complex cases, and in doing so makes recommen-dations about the future of bioethics...|$|R
40|$|This {{strategy}} {{sets out}} the Government’s approach to boosting business investment in innovation and ensuring UK {{success in the}} global economy. Universities and research, entrepreneurship and risk taking, greater connections between people and organisations, and a more open environment will all be {{at the heart of}} our approach. The UK {{has the potential to be}} a world leader in innovation. The strength of UK universities and the wider knowledge base is a national asset. Our knowledge base is the most productive in the G 8, with a depth and breadth of expertise across over 400 areas of distinctive research strength. The UK produces 14 % of the most highly cited papers and our Higher Education Institutions generate over £ 3 billion in external income each year. The Government is committed to invest in maintaining and strengthening the research base, and to continue to fund a balance of <b>blue</b> <b>skies</b> and applied <b>research</b> projects. But the challenges we face in innovation are as big as those elsewhere. Some of them are long-standing, such as ensuring we make the most of the UK’s inventions and discoveries, while others are newer. Other countries are spending more on research and working to develop clusters of knowledge and innovation hotspots. The costs of cutting-edge research and the latest high-tech processes are greater than ever before, and are often too large for any one company. There is more competition for European funds. We have always needed to do better in technician-level skills, but have recently slipped down the OECD league for higher-level skills too. To succeed in the global innovation economy, the UK must strengthen its ability to accelerate the commercialisation of emerging technologies, and to capture the value chains linked to these. The private sector is always going to be central to innovation. But Government can play a key role in ensuring entrepreneurs, financiers and innovators have the best possible environment in which to operate, through: • Funding <b>blue</b> <b>skies</b> <b>research</b> as well as new discoveries and inventions; • Improving the interface between Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) and Business; and • Delivering a better environment for commercialising research.   Economics Paper Underpinning the BIS Innovation Strategy is an economic analysis that sets out the conceptual and empirical thinking behind the Strategy. It rests on three bodies of work and evidence: recent results from innovation economics, recent policy-related studies, and new innovation data. Both theory and evidence show that innovation is the central source of economic growth. But innovation is changing its scope and forms: across borders, across institutions, and in terms of its methods and processes. It is necessary to look at innovation as a system, in which different actors (universities, infrastructures, companies, and the public sector) collaborate directly and indirectly. Four primary policy challenges are identified: the need to facilitate knowledge flows, the need to maintain a high-grade knowledge infrastructure, the need to support business investment in conditions of uncertainty, and the need to build an innovating public sector.
