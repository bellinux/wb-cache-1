The terminology can be unclear, however, because a poorly handled design basis accident can result in conditions beyond what was considered likely, causing a <b>beyond</b> <b>design</b> <b>basis</b> <b>accident.</b> [...] For this reason, some industry experts have criticized the use of design basis terminology. The Three Mile Island accident and the Chernobyl disaster are examples of design basis accidents becoming non design basis accidents largely due to failures to follow the written operating procedures.|$|E

40|$|Ignalina NPP is {{equipped}} with channel-type boiling-water graphite-moderated reactor RBMK- 1500. Results of the level- 1 probabilistic safety assessment of the Ignalina NPP have shown that in topography of the risk, the transients with failure of long-term core cooling other than LOCA are the main contributors to the core damage frequency. The total loss of off-site power with a failure to start any diesel generator, that is station blackout, is the event {{which could lead to}} the loss of long-term core cooling. Such accident could lead to multiple ruptures of fuel channels with severe consequences and should be analyzed in order to estimate the timing of the key events and the possibilities for accident management. This paper presents the results of the analysis of station blackout at Ignalina NPP. Analysis was performed using thermal-hydraulic state-of-the-art RELAP 5 /MOD 3. 2 code. The response of reactor cooling system and the processes in the reactor cavity and its venting system in case of a few fuel-channel ruptures due to overheating were demonstrated.

40|$|Today the use {{of small}} modular {{integral}} reactors {{is one of the}} options for {{the use of}} the nuclear technology in a sustainable energy mix in developing and developed countries. These new designs are relatively portable and well suited for deployment on small electricity grids. Small Modular Reactors (SMR) provide parallel construction capabilities that reduce capital costs, construction times, and finance and costs. They are recognized to be able to reach larger electricity market around the world. In this framework the Multi-Application Small Light-Water Reactor (MASLWR) is a small modular integral Pressurized light Water Reactor (PWR) of 35 MWe relying on natural circulation during both steady-state and transient operation. The integral arrangement of the plant avoids pressurized primary components outside the Reactor Pressure Vessel (RPV) eliminating the possibility of a large break Loss of Coolant Accident (LOCA) and reducing the Small Break LOCA (SBLOCA) initiating event frequency. Of particular interest is the SBLOCA mitigation strategy typical of the MASLWR design based on a natural circulation dynamic coupling between the primary and the containment system. A first test campaign, under a US Department of Energy grant, has been conducted in an experimental test facility constructed at Oregon State University (OSU-MASLWR) to test the MASLWR prototype phenomena. In particular the OSU-MASLWR 003 B test thermal hydraulically investigates the MASLWR dynamic primary/containment coupling during a <b>beyond</b> <b>design</b> <b>basis</b> <b>accident</b> scenario.

40|$|In {{a fusion}} reactor, a {{continuous}} {{erosion of the}} Plasma Facing Surfaces (PFSs) occurs during normal plant operations. This erosion creates a particles debris (dust) spanning from 1 µm to 50 µm in dimension. These formed dust deposits {{on the bottom of}} the Vacuum Vessel (VV), i. e. on the divertor surface. In case of <b>Beyond</b> <b>Design</b> <b>Basis</b> <b>Accident</b> (BDBA), this dust may be mobilized and transported towards the confinement building, or even into the outer environment. Therefore, the evaluation of the maximum mobilized dust mass is a safety issue of main concern, because it may pose a radiological risk to plant operators and to the outer population. To investigate these incidental scenarios, lumped-parameters codes such MELCOR are commonly employed. A specific version of MELCOR, capable to treat the phenomena occurring in a fusion reactor, is developed by Idaho National Laboratory (INL). Although, a model to treat the mobilization of dust is still not yet implemented in this specific MELCOR version. This paper presents, after a review of the available resuspension models, the selection of a specific resuspension model and the efforts made for its validation against different experimental tests. The selected model is the semi-empirical “Force Balance” model, just implemented in the ASTEC and ECART codes, but specific modifications were introduced to allow its implementation in MELCOR through ad hoc developed Control Functions (CFs). Its validation shows a quite good agreement with most of the experimental tests investigated, highlighting its capabilities for the safety analysis of the forthcoming fusion reactors...|$|E

For accurate {{calculation of the}} temperature/pressure rise and hydrogen transport calculation in nuclear reactor containment due to such scenarios, wall condensation heat transfer coefficient (HTC) is used. In the present work, the adaptation of a commercial CFD code {{with the implementation of}} models for steam condensation on wall surfaces in presence of noncondensable gases is explained. Steam condensation has been modeled using the empirical average HTC, which was originally developed to be used for “lumped-parameter” (volume-averaged) modeling of steam condensation in the presence of noncondensable gases. The present paper suggests a generalized HTC based on curve fitting of most of the reported semiempirical condensation models, which are valid for specific wall conditions. The present methodology has been validated against limited reported experimental data from the COPAIN experimental facility.

40|$|Air ingress with {{graphite}} burning {{belongs to}} the accident scenarios in HTRs with potentially severe consequences. This paper gives an overview of basic phenomena of graphite burning like ignition conditions and moving reaction fronts. The pioneering graphite burning experiments of Don Schweitzer are successfully reevaluated. Ignition conditions are examined, and it is underlined that burning depends not only on graphite properties {{but also on the}} heat balance in the whole graphite arrangement. In graphite-moderated reactors, ignition occurs at about 650 °C for small air flow rates: this means that normal operation temperatures in HTRs always allow for ignition. Fuel behaviour in air ingress, as determined in the KORA facility, is discussed: up to about 1300 °C modern TRISO fuel is stable in air, but from 1500 °C a complete, fast destruction is observed. Exemplary calculations on massive air ingress by chimney draught performed with REACT/THERMIX are outlined. For a hot bottom reflector there is a substantial time span before fuel is attacked. Because severe air ingress in well-designed HTRs belongs to <b>beyond</b> <b>design</b> <b>basis</b> <b>accidents,</b> the knowledge is fairly good.

The Final Safety Analysis Report (FSAR) constitutes the key element for demonstrating the safety of a nuclear power plant. Thus BEPU approach is relevant to the FSAR. The present paper deals with a proposal to apply a BEPU approach to the FSAR of Atucha- 2 PHWR (Pressurized Heavy Water Reactor) now in construction in Argentina with operation start expected in 2010. Atucha- 2 is a vessel type two loop KWU-Siemens- AREVA plant with vertical core channels and hydraulically separated moderator and coolant circuits.

New international requirements were issued by the IAEA in 2015 taking into account lessons learned from the accident at the NPP Fukushima Daiichi in Japan on 11 March 2011. The IAEA pays particular attention to the development of safety infrastructure in Member States embarking on a nuclear power programme. In the framework of the national projects of technical cooperation, the IAEA is actively implementing international safety requirements released in the IAEA Safety Standards. Following the IAEA safety standards for these States became mandatory. The key issue of the requirements is a demand to Member State to have a public protection strategy in place before the commissioning the first NPP. The strategy shall be based on the Generic criteria to be used in emergency preparedness and response to protect the people in emergency exposure situation -to prevent severe deterministic effects, and-to limit the risk of stochastic health effects on the reasonably achievable level. The strategy shall include 1. Classification of facilities and areas according to the degree of potential radiological hazard. 2. Classification of emergency planning zones around the hazardous facility. 3. Classification of the status of a facility in event of an emergency. The Russian Federation takes an active part in the construction of nuclear power plants in those countries that are just embarking on a nuclear power programme, therefore, new international requirements should be considered in the design and construction of the NPPs abroad. Those requirements should be also considered in training of national personnel for the implementation of nuclear power programme...|$|E

40|$|The {{analysis}} of <b>beyond</b> <b>design</b> <b>basis</b> <b>accidents</b> (BDBA) {{is an essential}} component of the safety concept of nuclear power plants (NPP). Goal of the analysis is to achieve a set of actions aimed to prevent the escalation into a severe accident, to mitigate consequences of a severe accident, and to achieve a long term controllable state of the NPP. This paper presents an analytical procedure to optimize the timing of operator interventions. The procedure is demonstrated based on four sets of parameters, first, parameters which define the operator actions are chosen. Second, parameters which define the system availability are chosen. Third, parameters which define in a continuous way the status of the plant are chosen. Finally, one looks for a functional dependency of the accident management (AM) -parameters and the parameters describing the plant status.

After {{the decision was made}} to decommission the Ignalina NPP, Unit 1 was shut down on December 31, 2004, and Unit 2 is to be operated until the end of 2009. Despite of this fact, severe accident management guidelines for RBMK- 1500 reactor at Ignalina NPP are prepared. In case of <b>beyond</b> <b>design</b> <b>basis</b> <b>accidents,</b> it can occur that no water sources are available at the moment for heat removal from fuel channels. Specificity of RBMK reactor is such that the channels with control rods are cooled with water supplied by the system totally independent from the reactor cooling system. Therefore, the heat removal from RBMK- 1500 reactor core using circuit for cooling of rods in control and protection system can be used as nonregular mean for reactor cooldown in case of BDBA. The heat from fuel channels, where heat is generated, through graphite bricks is transferred in radial direction to cooled CPS channels. This article presents the analysis of possibility to remove heat from reactor core in case of large LOCA by employing CPS channels cooling circuit. The analysis was performed for Ignalina NPP with RBMK- 1500 reactor using RELAP 5 - 3 D and RELAP 5 codes.

They are to investigate the hydrogen source term that results from reflooding an uncovered core of a Light-Water Reactor (LWR) with emergency cooling water. In the QUENCH experimental program Zircaloy- 4 was used as standard-type material for rod cladding and grid spacer. Up to the end of 2007, 12 QUENCH experiments have been performed with this type of cladding; two test bundles contained B C and one AgInCd absorber. One experiment (QUENCH- 12) was conducted with Zr 1 %Nb cladding (VVER-type). 4 Due to the niobium-bearing cladding, the VVER-type test QUENCH- 12 could be regarded as a precursor for the upcoming program “QUENCH-ACM ” with advanced cladding materials, i. e. M 5, Duplex, ZIRLO, to be tested under SFD or BDBA (<b>beyond</b> <b>design</b> <b>basis</b> <b>accident)</b> conditions. These materials were developed for longer operation times in nuclear power reactors and extended burnup. They are optimized regarding their corrosion behavior under operational conditions and were also tested for LOCA (loss of coolant accident) and RIA (reactivity-initiated accident) conditions by the manufacturers. However, there are only very limited data available on the behavior of the new alloys in the SFD/BDBA temperature range, i. e. above 1500 K.

40|$|Hydrogen {{combustion}} {{may represent}} a threat to containment integrity in a VVER- 440 / 213 plant owing to the combination of high pressure and high temperature. A study {{has been carried out}} using the GASFLOW 2. 1 three-dimensional CFD code to evaluate the hydrogen distribution in the containment during a <b>beyond</b> <b>design</b> <b>basis</b> <b>accident.</b> The VVER- 440 / 213 containment input model consists of two 3 D blocks connected via one-dimensional (1 D) ducts. One 3 D block contains the reactor building and the accident localization tower with the suppression pools. Another 3 D block models the air traps. 1 D ducts represent the check valves connecting the accident localization tower with the air traps. The VVER pressure suppression system, called ''bubbler condenser,'' was modeled as a distributed heat sink with water thermodynamic properties. This model accounts for the energy balance. However, it is not currently possible to model dynamic phenomena associated with the water pools (e. g., vent clearing, level change). The GASFLOW 2. 1 calculation gave detailed results for the spatial distribution of thermal-hydraulic parameters and gas concentrations. The range and trend of the parameters are reasonable and valuable. There are particularly interesting circulation patterns around the steam generators, in the bubbler tower and other primary system compartments. In case of the bubbler tower, concentration and temperature contour plots show an inhomogeneous distribution along the height and width, changing during the accident. Hydrogen concentrations also vary within primary system compartments displaying lower as well as higher (up to 13 - 20 % and higher) values in some nodes. Prediction of such concentration distributions was not previously possible with lumped parameter codes. GASFLOW 2. 1 calculations were compared with CONTAIN 1. 2 (lumped parameter code) results. Apart from the qualitatively similar trends, there are, for the time being, quantitative differences between the results concerning, for example, pressure histories, or the total amount of steam available in the containment. The results confirm the importance of detailed modeling of the containment, {{as well as of the}} bubbler condenser and sump water pools. The study showed that modeling of hydrogen distribution in the VVER- 440 / 213 containment was possible using the GASFLOW 2. 1 code with reasonable results and remarkable physical insights...|$|E
40|$|The {{fluoride}} salt-cooled {{high-temperature reactor}} (FHR) combines high-temperature coated-particle fuel with a high-temperature salt coolant for a reactor with unique market and safety characteristics. This combination can eliminate large-scale radionuclide releases by avoiding major fuel failure during a catastrophic <b>Beyond</b> <b>Design</b> <b>Basis</b> <b>Accident</b> (BDBA). The high-temperature core contains liquid salt coolant {{surrounded by a}} liquid salt buffer; these salts limit core heatup while decay heat drops. The vessel insulation is designed to fail during a BDBA. The silo contains a frozen BDBA salt designed to melt and surround the reactor vessel during a major accident to accelerate heat transfer from the vessel. These features provide the required temperature gradient to drive decay heat from core to the vessel wall and to the environment below fuel failure temperatures. A 1047 MWth FHR was modeled using the STAR-CCM+ computational fluid dynamics package. Peak temperatures and heat transfer phenomena were calculated, focusing on feasibility of melting the BDBA salt that improves heat transfer from vessel to silo. A simplified wavelength-independent radiation model was examined to approximate the heat transfer capability with radiation heat transfer. The FHR BDBA system kept peak temperatures below the fuel failure point in all cases. Reducing the reactor vessel-silo gap size minimized the time to melt the BDBA salt. Radiation heat transfer is a dominant factor in the high-temperature accident sequence. It keeps peak fuel temperatures hundreds of degrees lower than with convection and conduction only; it makes higher core powers feasible. The FHR's atmospheric pressure design allows a thin reactor vessel, ensuring the high accident temperatures reach the vessel's outer surface, creating a large temperature difference from the vessel to the frozen salt. This greatly accelerates the heat transfer over current reactor designs with thick, relatively cool accident outer vessel temperatures. The frozen BDBA salt in the FHR places a limit on the upper temperature at the vessel outer boundary for significant time; it is a substantial heat sink for the accident duration. Finally, surrounding the FHR vessel, the convection of hot air, and circulating salt later in the accident, preferentially transports heat upward in the FHR; this provides a conduction path through the concrete silo to the atmosphere above the FHR. by Matthew J.

The major portion of this elicitation activity occurred during a two-day meeting held on Aug. 10 - 11, 2010 at Argonne National Laboratory. There were two primary objectives of this work: (1) Identify computer codes currently available for SFR accident analysis and reactor safety calculations; and (2) Assess the status and capability of current US computer codes to adequately model the required accident scenarios and associated phenomena, and identify important gaps. During the review, panel members identified over 60 computer codes that are currently available in the international community to perform different aspects of SFR safety analysis for various event scenarios and accident categories. A brief description of each of these codes together with references (when available) is provided. An adaptation of the Predictive Capability Maturity Model (PCMM) for computational modeling and simulation is described for use in this work. The panel's assessment of the available US codes is presented in the form of nine tables, organized into groups of three for each of three risk categories considered: anticipated operational occurrences (AOOs), <b>design</b> <b>basis</b> <b>accidents</b> (DBA), and <b>beyond</b> <b>design</b> <b>basis</b> <b>accidents</b> (BDBA). A set of summary conclusions are drawn from the results obtained. At the highest level, the panel judged that current US code capabilities are adequate for licensing given reasonable margins, but expressed concern that US code development activities had stagnated and that the experienced user-base and the experimental validation base was decaying away quickly...|$|R
40|$|A high {{pressure}} {{test of a}} scale model of a steel containment vessel (SCV) was conducted on December 11 - 12, 1996 at Sandia National Laboratories, Albuquerque, NM, USA. The test model is a mixed-scaled model (1 : 10 in geometry and 1 : 4 in shell thickness) of an improved Mark II boiling water reactor (BWR) containment. This testis part of a program to investigate the response of representative models of nuclear containment structures to pressure loads <b>beyond</b> the <b>design</b> <b>basis</b> <b>accident.</b> The posttest analyses of this test focused on three areas where the pretest analysis effort did not adequately predict the model behavior during the test.

40|$|After the Fukushima <b>accident,</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>design</b> <b>basis</b> <b>accidents</b> (BDBA), {{even though}} their {{frequency}} is predicted by probabilistic safety assessment (PSA) to be low, have moved {{to the center of}} attention. Since then an increased number of analyses on the long term station blackout accidents have been performed. The present paper highlights selected aspects of another accident which, even if its frequency to occur is very low, may be severe in its consequences - a main steam line break with failure of all main steam isolation valves in the affected steam line in a Boiling-Water Reactor (BWR). Following the accident the nuclear power plant (NPP) quickly loses coolant inventory directly to the environment (containment bypass). Without proper operator actions, core heat up and core damage may occur at an early stage in the accident. A plant input model which has been developed at the University of Pisa has been used to run three cases, using the best estimate thermal hydraulic system code Relap 5 mod 3. 3. The first case assumes no operator actions and availability of passive systems only. It is used as baseline to be compared to the two other cases. The second case assumes availability of active and passive systems, and plausible operator behavior following symptom based emergency operating procedures (EOP), considering plant states. The third case presents an optimized strategy, assuming that the operator was able to clearly identify the root cause of the accident. The analysis confirms that, without proper operator actions, the accident can quickly progress to a severe accident (the situation is aggravated by the containment bypass). It shows further that procedures based on plant states, if this special case has not been considered, may not lead to desirable results. Finally it can be seen that, adopting a suitable strategy, the grace period can be extended up to a point where additional sources of coolant can be made available...|$|R
40|$|This thesis study {{presents}} the research work aimed {{to investigate the}} safety features of a next generation Boiling Water Reactor (BWR) design by conducting the experiments on a scaled down facility and simulating the reactor transients with thermal-hydraulic system analysis code (RELAP 5). ^ The Economic Simplified Boiling Water Reactor (ESBWR), designed by General Electric (GE), is a nuclear reactor containing passively safety characteristics. A series of integral tests simulating different types of Loss-Of-Coolant Accidents (LOCAs) were conducted using the P 2 ̆ 6 barbelow;urdue U 2 ̆ 6 barbelow;niversity M 2 ̆ 6 barbelow;ulti-Dimensional Integral Test A 2 ̆ 6 barbelow;ssembly for E 2 ̆ 6 barbelow;SBWR applications (PUMA-E) facility to support the licensing process to this reactor design. This research work {{was sponsored by the}} U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). Several code models have been developed based on the prototypic power plant design, test facility configuration and experiment conditions. Test transients were simulated on the computer and the simulation results were presented as the counterpart of experiment data. ^ Various kinds of Design Basis Accident (DBA) and <b>Beyond</b> <b>Design</b> <b>Basis</b> <b>Accident</b> (BDBA) were simulated in the PUMA-E facility. Depending on the location and size of the break, four types of LOCA tests were performed, namely, Bottom Drain Line Break (MSLB), Gravity Drain Line Break (GDLB), Feed Water Line Break (FWLB) and Main Steam Line Break (MSLB). In addition to the line break, partly failure of safety system, like ICS, PCCS or GDCS was applied on some tests to address the safety margin. This thesis focused on BDLB and MSLB tests particularly since they represented significantly different break size, location and flow type. ^ Generally, the experiment results showed that passively safety system performance was satisfied under those types of LOCAs. Specifically, Automatic Depressurization System (ADS) and Gravity-Driven Cooling System (GDCS) collaborated to fulfill the function of Emergency Core Cooling System (ECCS), providing adequate supply of coolant to keep the Reactor Pressure Vessel (RPV) coolant level above the Top of the Active Fuel (TAF). The Isolation Condenser System (ICS) and Passive Containment Cooling System (PCCS) kept the containment system, composed of Drywell (DW) and Wetwell (WW), below the design pressure limit. No serious challenge to fuel intact and containment integrity had been encountered even for BDBA tests with partly failure of safety system. Several issues like GDCS oscillation and potential low coolant level in the RPV found during the tests have been addressed and summarized for further evaluation. ^ RELAP 5 was claimed to be a 2 ̆ 2 best estimate 2 ̆ 2 system code suitable for the analysis of all transients and postulated accidents in Light Water Reactor (LWR) systems, including both large and small break LOCAs as well as the full range of operational transients. The version of code used in this research is RELAP 5 /Mod 3. 3. Generally the code models gave reasonably accurate predictions of the system thermal hydraulic behaviors compared with the experiment data. The agreement between the code simulation results and experimental data demonstrated that the RELAP 5 had a good capacity to analyze the LOCA transients, thus still had some limitation to reproduce some particular local phenomena. The similarity between the code results of the plant model and test facility model demonstrated the scale up capacity of RELAP 5 and scalability of integral test. The code sensitivity study has been performed to investigate the strength of safety system and code stability upon the perturbation of break size, initial conditions and PCCS capacity. Several comments and suggestion has been made regarding the potential improvement of certain calculation models in the code. ...|$|E
40|$|Department of Nuclear EngineeringThe {{sodium-cooled}} {{fast reactor}} (SFR) {{is one of}} the six Gen-IV reactor concepts, and it is a near-term deployable reactor concept with its technological achievement and the experience through that many countries have operated and developed. On the other hand, the small modular reactor (SMR) concept is representative reactor design concept for the near future regarding the advanced plant design trend. There are some SMR concepts developed in some countries and it is expected that the SMR market would be enlarged to fit the global electricity demand with the flexibility of SMRs. In this thesis, a hybrid concept of SFR and SMR is developed with the characteristics of an ultra-long cycle operation and the advanced safety feature arisen from the combination design of the two reactor design concepts. There are some important parameters in the fast reactor physics such as conversion ratio, capture to fission ratio, fertile fission bonus, and they can be very different according to the design option. The coolant void reactivity and the thermal expansion coefficients are the critical parameters in fast reactor core design that decide the safety of the core. Choosing metal fuel and liquid metal coolant also secure the inherent safety of fast reactor with its reactivity parameters so the materials of them dominate the key characteristics of the core. At the same time, to have transportability of the reactor modules, which {{is one of the}} important identities of SMR, the diameter of the reactor vessel or the core barrel is limited less than 3 m. Before reactor design, the feasibility study of the ultra-long cycle operation was performed for the target of 30 -year operation. For this, existing small fast reactor concepts with long-cycle operation were assessed first, and the fuel, coolant, and structure materials were reviewed. In the reactor design stage, the reactor and core design requirements were set based on the previous SFR and SMR design studies and the feasibility study of long cycle operation of small fast reactors. With the core design requirement, pin, assembly and the core design parameters were determined so as to have the safety feature in any state during the long cycle operation. With the fixed core geometry, five breed-and-burn strategies were tested in the five different cores, and finally an optimized breed-and-burn strategy was developed through the combination of the test cases. The core performance of the final core design was evaluated and the operation feasibility was assessed in the neutronics point of view. It was confirmed that the 30 -year operation of the core is feasible even its conversion ratio is less than unity and that the active core breeds in radial direction from the peripheral region and the power peak moves to the core center as the burnup propagates. The Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR) spent fuel was tested by loading for the blanket material and the operation feasibility of it was also confirmed. Core kinetics parameters and reactivity feedback coefficients were assessed, and the sodium void worth and expansion coefficients show negative values. The control rod system was investigated that it is optimized to control the core reactivity to make it critical throughout its operation time and to secure the shutdown margin and another primary control rod material was proposed. With the integral reactivity parameters, the quasi-static reactivity balance analysis performed for the anticipated transient without scram (ATWS) events, the unprotected loss of flow (ULOF), unprotected loss of heat sink (ULOHS), and unprotected transient over power (UTOP) events, and it shows the inherent safety of the core. Furthermore, the transient analysis was also performed and it has been confirmed that this newly developed core is inherently safe and has capability to cope with the <b>beyond</b> <b>design</b> <b>basis</b> <b>accident</b> (BDBA). Both Monte Carlo and deterministic approaches were utilized by using neutronics computer codes for the steady-state analysis in the design and evaluation stage of the core modeling. Moreover, safety analysis computer code system was also utilized to perform the transient analysis for the modeled core. ope...|$|E
40|$|This report {{provides}} an overview of the mechanical, structural, and neutronic aspects of the Advanced High Temperature Reactor (AHTR) design concept. The AHTR is a design concept for a large output Fluoride salt cooled High-temperature Reactor (FHR) that is being developed to enable evaluation of the technology hurdles remaining to be overcome prior to FHRs becoming a commercial reactor class. This report documents the incremental AHTR design maturation performed over the past year and is focused on advancing the design concept to a level of a functional, self-consistent system. The AHTR employs plate type coated particle fuel assemblies with rapid, off-line refueling. Neutronic analysis of the core has confirmed the viability of a 6 -month 2 -batch cycle with 9 weight-percent enriched uranium fuel. Refueling is intended to be performed automatically under visual guidance using dedicated robotic manipulators. The present design intent is for used fuel to be stored inside of containment for at least 6 months and then transferred to local dry wells for intermediate term, on-site storage. The mechanical and structural concept development effort has included an emphasis on transportation and constructability to minimize construction costs and schedule. The design intent is that all components be factory fabricated into rail transportable modules that are assembled into subsystems at an on-site workshop prior to being lifted into position using a heavy-lift crane in an open-top style construction. While detailed accident identification and response sequence analysis has yet to be performed, the design concept incorporates multiple levels of radioactive material containment including fully passive responses to all identified <b>design</b> <b>basis</b> or non-very-low frequency <b>beyond</b> <b>design</b> <b>basis</b> <b>accidents.</b> Key building <b>design</b> elements include: 1) below grade siting to minimize vulnerability to aircraft impact, 2) multiple natural circulation decay heat rejection chimneys, 3) seismic base isolation, and 4) decay heat powered back-up electricity generation. The report provides a preconceptual design of the manipulators, the fuel transfer system, and the salt transfer loops. The mechanical handling of the fuel and how it is accomplished without instrumentation inside the salt is described within the report. All drives for the manipulators reside outside the reactor top flange. The design has also taken into account the transportability of major components and how they will be assembled on sit...|$|R
40|$|Experimental results {{obtained}} at integral test facilities {{are used in}} the validation process of thermal - hydraulic system codes for the steady - state and transient simulation of light water reactors. The expertise and guidelines derived fro m this work (nota bly the nodalis ation scheme and the specific model options) can later be applied to safety analyses of nuclear power plants. This paper describes work carried out within the STARS project at the Paul Scherrer Institut (PSI) using the U. S. NRC - sponsored sys tem code TRACE. Post - test analyses for eight selected ROSA and ROSA - 2 experiments from the OECD/NEA projects ROSA and ROSA - 2 were conducted previ ously using TRACE version 5. 0 release candidate (RC) 3. A consistent plant nodalisation is employed across all tests, which include typical <b>design</b> and <b>beyond</b> <b>design</b> <b>basis</b> <b>accidents,</b> such as loss - of - coolant - accident, main steam line break, and steam generator tube rupture. The full series of cases has been consolidated and upgraded for TRACE version 5. 0 Patch 4. Sin ce the newer TRACE version includes substantial changes in the area of choked flow modelling, the nodalisation of the break valves {{has proven to be a}} critical upgrade in all test cases. Selected results for the newer TRACE versi on are presented and discuss ed. The complete set of tests has been supplemented by one further post - test analysis presented herein; The OECD/NEA ROSA - 2 Test 7, a PWR 13 % cold leg intermediate break los s - of - coolant accident (IBLOCA). Results show that, for this break size, the influen ce of the uncertainty in the break flow rate is substantial. T here is a fine balance between the timing of the core uncovery and loop seal clearance, the rate of coolant loss following core uncovery, and the ability of the loop seal clearance to effectivel y quench the core. This has a significant effect on the predicted peak cladding temperatures. Updated results for ROSA - 2 a nalysis results for the remaining test cases are consistent with the previous RC 3 analyses and match the experimental data well. U pdat ed results for ROSA - 2 Test 4, a steam generator tube rupture scenario, show improved agreement with experimental data. KEYWORDS TRACE, ROSA/LSTF, ITF, V&VPostprint (published version...|$|R

The Jules Horowitz Reactor will replace it and will offer a quite larger experimental field. It has the ambition to provide the necessary nuclear data and to maintain a fission research capability in Europe after 2010. The Jules Horowitz Reactor will represent a significant step in terms of performances and experimental capabilities. This paper will present the main design option resulting from the preliminary studies. The choice of the specific power around 600 KW/l for the reference core configuration is a key decision to ensure the required flux level. Consequently many choices {{have to be made}} regarding the materials used in the core and the fuel element design. These involve many specific qualifications including codes validation. The main safety options are based on: A safety approach based upon the defence-in-depth principle. A strategy of generic approaches to assess experimental risks in the facility.
