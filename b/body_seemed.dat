25|$|In {{the poem}} Lalla Radha and the Churel, a priest warns the protagonist to not go near the Peepul trees {{because that is}} where the Churel lives and she might take him away and kill him. He still went to the Peepul tree and she called out to him in a sweet tone and seduced him until he went to her. Blinded by his desire, he did not notice that while he lay with her, his <b>body</b> <b>seemed</b> to get frailer until he died in a state of ecstasy. In The Female Element in Indian Culture, it says, “The Churel runs after and seeks to possess every man whom she meets, for, it is said, her carnal {{appetite}} remains unsatisfied in life”. She also possesses girls during dances, causing a trance. According to Persian legend, when travelers saw the tracks of a Churel in the dirt they would try to flee by heading in the opposite direction, but her reversed feet would inevitably lead them right into her grasp. The Patari and Majhwar think that she appears to take her victims to the mountains and {{the only way they can}} be freed is if a goat is sacrificed.|$|E
500|$|Jabba the Hutt's {{physical}} appearance reinforces his personality {{as a criminal}} deviant: in Return of the Jedi, Han Solo entitles Jabba a [...] "slimy piece of worm-ridden filth"; and film critic Roger Ebert describes him as [...] "a cross between a toad and the Cheshire Cat"; and astrophysicist and science fiction writer Jeanne Cavelos gives Jabba the [...] "award for most disgusting alien". Science fiction authors Tom and Martha Veitch write that Jabba's body is a [...] "miasmic mass", and that [...] "The Hutt's lardaceous <b>body</b> <b>seemed</b> to periodically release a greasy discharge, sending fresh waves of rotten stench" [...] into the air. Jabba's appetite is insatiable, and some authors portray him threatening to eat his subordinates.|$|E
500|$|Whereas the {{majority}} opinion wholly ignored {{the proceedings of the}} General Assembly as irrelevant (the court lacking jurisdiction) and Brewer and Brown affirmed them, Harlan excoriated the legislature in his dissent. [...] "Looking into the record before us, I find such action taken by the body claiming to be organized as the lawful legislature of Kentucky as was discreditable in the last degree and unworthy of the free people whom it professed to represent. ... Those who composed that <b>body</b> <b>seemed</b> to have shut their eyes against the proof for fear that it would compel them to respect the popular will as expressed at the polls." [...] He also expressed disbelief at {{the majority}} opinion: [...] "he overturning of the public will, as expressed at the ballot box, without evidence or against evidence, in order to accomplish partisan ends, is a crime against free government, and deserves the execration of all lovers of liberty. ... I cannot believe that the judiciary is helpless in the presence of such a crime." ...|$|E

2500|$|Hearing Callas in Norma in 1952] was a shock, a {{wonderful}} shock. You just got shivers {{up and down}} the spine. It was a bigger sound in those earlier performances, before she lost weight. I think she tried very hard to recreate the sort of [...] "fatness" [...] of the sound which she had when she was as fat as she was. But when she lost the weight, she couldn't seem to sustain the great sound that she had made, and the <b>body</b> <b>seemed</b> to be too frail to support that sound that she was making. Oh, but it was oh so exciting. It was thrilling. I don't think that anyone who heard Callas after 1955 really heard the Callas voice.|$|E
2500|$|One {{night on}} tour in 1945, Tallchief was doing her barre when Balanchine remarked [...] "if only you {{would learn to}} do battement tendu {{properly}} you wouldn't have to learn anything else." [...] It {{was his way of}} saying she needed to start all over– battement tendu is the most basic ballet exercise there is. [...] "I wanted to die", she recalled. [...] "But I had seen the difference between Mary Ellen's [...] dancing and mine. I knew he was right." [...] Under the tutelage of Balanchine, Tallchief lost ten pounds and elongated her legs and neck. She learned how to hold her chest high, keep her back straight, and keep her feet arched. [...] "My <b>body</b> <b>seemed</b> to be going through a metamorphosis", she recalled. Tallchief relearned the basic exercises the way Balanchine wanted and transformed her greatest weakness–turnout–into a strength. Danilova devoted a lot of her time to instructing Tallchief in the ballerina's art, helping her transform from a teenage girl into a young woman.|$|E
