25|$|Pocchiola and Vegter (1996a,b,c) {{originally}} {{defined a}} pseudotriangle to be a simply-connected {{region of the}} plane bounded by three smooth convex curves that are tangent at their endpoints. However, subsequent work has settled on a broader definition that applies more generally to polygons {{as well as to}} regions bounded by smooth curves, and that allows nonzero angles at the three vertices. In this broader definition, a pseudotriangle is a simply-connected region of the plane, having three convex vertices. The three boundary curves connecting these three vertices must be convex, in the sense that any line segment connecting two points on the same <b>boundary</b> <b>curve</b> must lie entirely outside or on the boundary of the pseudotriangle. Thus, the pseudotriangle is the region between the convex hulls of these three curves, and more generally any three mutually tangent convex sets form a pseudotriangle that lies between them.|$|E

2500|$|In the {{mathematical}} subject of geometric group theory, a Dehn function, named after Max Dehn, is an optimal function associated to a finite group presentation which bounds {{the area of}} a relation in that group (that is a freely reduced word in the generators representing the identity element of the group) {{in terms of the}} length of that relation (see pp.7980 in [...] ). The growth type of the Dehn function is a [...] quasi-isometry invariant of a finitely presented group. The Dehn function of a finitely presented group is also closely connected with non-deterministic algorithmic complexity of the word problem in groups. In particular, a finitely presented group has solvable word problem if and only if the Dehn function for a finite presentation of this group is recursive (see Theorem 2.1 in [...] ). The notion of a Dehn function is motivated by isoperimetric problems in geometry, such as the classic isoperimetric inequality for the Euclidean plane and, more generally, the notion of a filling area function that estimates the area of a minimal surface in a Riemannian manifold in terms of the length of the <b>boundary</b> <b>curve</b> of that surface.|$|E

First we approximate the original function along the grid lines of interpolation domain by using the univariate C 1 -rational quadratic fractal interpolation functions (fractal <b>boundary</b> <b>curves).</b> Then we construct the rational quadratic FIS as a blending combination with the x-direction and y-direction fractal <b>boundary</b> <b>curves.</b> The developed rational quadratic FISs are monotonic whenever the corresponding fractal <b>boundary</b> <b>curves</b> are monotonic.

Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the comprehensive performance of the rational quadratic FIS in fitting a monotonic/symmetric surface data.

In {{a single}} phase (P = 1) condition of a pure component system, two variables (F = 2), such as temperature and pressure, can be chosen independently {{to be any}} pair of values consistent with the phase. However, if the temperature and pressure combination ranges {{to a point where}} the pure component undergoes a separation into two phases (P = 2), F decreases from 2 to 1. When the system enters the two-phase region, it becomes no longer possible to independently control temperature and pressure. In the phase diagram to the right, the <b>boundary</b> <b>curve</b> between the liquid and gas regions maps the constraint between temperature and pressure when the single-component system has separated into liquid and gas phases at equilibrium.

Throughout both processes, the temperature and pressure stay in the relationship shown by this <b>boundary</b> <b>curve</b> unless one phase is entirely consumed by evaporation or condensation, or unless the critical point is reached.
