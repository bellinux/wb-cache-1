40|$|AbstractThe {{failure of}} the first stage blade in a steam turbine of 55 MW was investigated. The blade was made of 17 - 4 PH {{stainless}} steel and {{has been used for}} 12 years before failure. The current work aims to find out the main cause of the first stage blade failure. The methods for investigation were metallurgical analysis, chemical composition test, and hardness measurement. The result showed that there was no evidence the blade failure was due to material. The damage found on the blade namely crack on the <b>blade</b> <b>root.</b> Two locations of the crack observed at the <b>blade</b> <b>root,</b> which was at the tang and the fillet, with different failure modes. In general, the damage of the blade was started by the corrosion occurred on the <b>blade</b> <b>root.</b> The crack at the <b>blade</b> <b>root</b> tang was due to corrosion fatigue and the crack occurred at the <b>blade</b> <b>root</b> fillet owing to stress corrosion cracking...|$|R

40|$|The large {{variety of}} turbo-machinery <b>blade</b> <b>root</b> {{geometries}} {{used in industry}} prompted the question if an optimum geometry could be found. The present paper outlines the improved fillet stresses in a steam turbine blade and a special attention is made on SCF of the <b>blade</b> <b>root</b> (T-root) which fails and to guarantee for {{safe and reliable operation}} under all possible service conditions. An optimum <b>blade</b> <b>root</b> was defined, as a root with practical geometry, which when loaded returns the minimum fillet stress concentration factor. Finite element analysis is used to determine the fillet stresses and Peterson's stress concentration factor chart is effectively utilised to modify the <b>blade</b> <b>root.</b> The root is modified due to the difficulty in manufacturing the butting surface of the tang which grips the blade to the disk crowns having small contact area.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Blade</b> <b>roots</b> and <b>blade</b> {{attachment}} grooves {{are highly}} stressed areas of steam turbine rotors. An unknown crack in <b>blade</b> <b>roots</b> or <b>blade</b> attachments {{can lead to}} a serious failure of the complete turbo generator set. Due to the high demand of power energy worldwide there is a strong demand to extend the calculated life of turbo generator sets. The extended operation cycle of turbines leads to the demand of advanced NDT methods, especially for highly stressed areas of turbine and generator rotors. The most critical ranges of a turbine rotor are the turbine <b>blade</b> <b>roots</b> as well as the turbine blade attachment grooves. The individual design of the turbine manufacturer require separate NDT methods for each <b>blade</b> <b>root</b> or <b>blade</b> attachment to be inspected.

40|$|By {{applying}} adaptronics to helicopters, i. e. {{by use of}} self-adapting structural components, noise can be suppressed, vibration {{reduced and}} aerodynamic efficiency increased. This thesis investigates two concepts, the adaptive <b>blade</b> <b>root</b> and the adaptive blade tip, allowing direct adaptive shape control of the main rotor areas that are the main sources of helicopter noise and vibration. Both concepts {{are based on the}} introduction of a local twist into the rotor blades. Since non-stationary helicopter aerodynamics and their interaction with the elastic helicopter structure are the main sources for flight envelope boundaries as well as vibration and noise, the comprehension of aerodynamics is essential to effectively influence local airflow conditions and finally evaluate the investigated concepts. With respect to these relations the adaptive <b>blade</b> <b>root</b> and the adaptive blade tip are described and evaluated. The adaptive <b>blade</b> <b>root</b> represents a torsional actuator integrated in the rotor <b>blade</b> <b>root</b> that mainly introduces rigid body blade torsion. A torsional actuator integrated in the rotor blade tip is realized by the adaptive blade tip. This concept influences the blade twist distribution close to the blade tip and leads to higher aerodynamic efficiency due to this approach. (orig.)

Within the Smart Blades project the IWT- 7. 5 - 164 wind turbine has been used to investigate the feasibility of using trailing edge flaps as active control mechanism for load reduction.

For a tilted rotor without flaps the <b>blade</b> <b>root</b> bending moment acting perpendicular to the rotor plane has been observed to undergo a characteristic cyclic variation due to the tilt and gravity.

The objectives of the test are to demonstrate the structural integrity of the joint and to measure percentage load acting on the bolt when the joint is subjected to external load corresponding to the critical load case. The T-bolt connection is chosen for <b>blade</b> <b>root</b> joint for its simplicity compared to other joints and its effectiveness to improve fatigue life of the bolt. A design preload of 120 kN and an external load of 88 kN corresponding to class III gust wind load case, as defined by Germanischer Lloyd (GL), were considered to test the joint.

40|$|The thesis {{presented}} herein comprises of {{the work}} undertaken to research novel methods of Phased array ultrasonic inspection of complex steam turbine <b>blade</b> <b>roots</b> as found in the power generation industry. The research was conducted {{as part of the}} Engineering Doctorate scheme, administered by the Research Centre for Non-Destructive Evaluation (RCNDE), in conjunction with RWE npower and the University of Warwick. Steam turbine blades, and in particularly last stage blades of low pressure steam turbines, are amongst the most highly stressed components on a power generating plant. Two of the most common <b>blade</b> <b>root</b> fixing types include ‘curved axial entry fir tree roots’ (CAEFTR), and axial pinned roots, both of which are prone to cracking due to the high stresses to which they are subjected under operating conditions. Failure of the <b>blade</b> <b>root</b> fixings of such components, leading to the release of the blades, has historically led to the catastrophic failure and destruction of the whole turbine; the cost of collateral damage to plant components and the loss in generating income are seconded only by the risk these failures pose to life. Due to the high price of failure, NDT plays a critical part in the support and management of engineering maintenance, offering insight into the condition and integrity of turbine components through regular planned inspection regimes. It will be shown in this thesis how the invention of a novel continuous wedge, used to refract ultrasound into the critical regions of the <b>blade</b> <b>roots,</b> has significantly improved the ability to detect defects. Combined with the development of bespoke scanning frames these wedges facilitate the efficient and accurate acquisition of scanned data to assess the integrity of the component.
