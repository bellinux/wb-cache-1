Enacted on August 3, it initially reduced inflation by flooding the market with the central bank's foreign exchange reserves, thereby curving the chief cause for the inflation crisis: the demand for US dollars. Following Machinea's curtailment of the central bank's dollar sales on February 6, 1989, however, the exchange rate ballooned uncontrollably, and he resigned on March 31. These developments led to monthly inflation rates of over 100% by mid-year, as well as unprecedented riots and looting.|$|E

In 1853, the US reduced the silver weight of coins {{to keep them in}} circulation and in 1857 removed legal tender status from foreign coinage. In 1857 the final crisis of the free banking era began as American banks suspended payment in silver, with ripples through the developing international financial system. Due to the inflationary finance measures undertaken {{to help pay for the}} US Civil War, the government found it difficult to pay its obligations in gold or silver and suspended payments of obligations not legally specified in specie (gold bonds); this led banks to suspend the conversion of <b>bank</b> <b>liabilities</b> (bank notes and deposits) into specie.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} modern {{readers to}} the basic understanding of the banking system that was held by academics and practitioners {{in the early years}} of the 20 th century – that is, to traditional banking theory. This theory is completely inconsistent with the theoretic framework that views banks as financial intermediaries that receive deposits and invest those deposits in assets. Thus, this paper first sets forth in detail the basic elements of traditional banking theory and then relates those elements to the modern network effects literature. From this a bank-centered view of the money market is derived: all demand and short-term <b>bank</b> <b>liabilities,</b> including contingent liabilities, are potential money and nearmoney assets, and any non-bank liabilities that have monetary properties will derive them from their relationship with the banking system. This framework is then used to evaluate modern money markets, and this paper finds that indeed the so-called market-based money market in fact functions as a means of reallocating the <b>bank</b> <b>liabilities</b> held (indirectly) by the public from deposits to wholesale and contingent <b>bank</b> <b>liabilities.</b> This paper proposes that bank liability-based measures of the money supply be developed, and that regulators recognize that contingent <b>bank</b> <b>liabilities</b> often function as a substitute for deposits and should be regulated similarly...|$|E

External <b>bank</b> <b>liabilities</b> held by non-banks are found to increase after the introduction of explicit deposit insurance.

40|$|In this paper, I {{discuss the}} {{influence}} of the <b>banking</b> industry’s <b>liability</b> structure on the FDIC’s risk exposure, the relationship between this exposure and the assessment base, and various ways that the FDIC could incorporate the effects of <b>bank</b> <b>liability</b> structure into its price for deposit insurance. For most of the industry, I find that the FDIC’s risk exposure increases when banks move from domestic deposits to other funding sources because decreases in assessment income associated with a smaller assessment base are not offset by reductions in the FDIC’s exposure to loss. However, {{this may not be the}} case for banks that rely heavily on unsecured credits due to the benefits of market discipline. I outline three ways to incorporate <b>bank</b> <b>liability</b> structure into the FDIC’s pricing policy for deposit insurance: 1) change the assessment base; 2) adjust the pricing matrix; and 3) price directly for risk. I conclude that no such changes should be made in isolation. In particular, issues related to bank size must also be addressed because any change associated with liability structure would effectively shift the assessment burden towards larger banks.

30|$|As {{noted in}} the Introduction, Ireland {{was one of the}} {{countries}} worst affected by the Great Recession, with output falling by over 10 % in real terms between 2008 and 2010 and unemployment more than doubling over the same period. The effects of the global recession felt elsewhere were compounded in Ireland by the bursting of a property bubble and the subsequent collapse of output and employment in construction-related sectors. Because bank lending was so highly concentrated in construction, Irish banks experienced huge losses and the government decided to guarantee all <b>bank</b> <b>liabilities</b> in 2008. However, continued falling tax revenue and exposure to <b>bank</b> <b>liabilities</b> resulted in the government deficit going from almost zero in 2008 to 13.9 % in 2010 and to a remarkable 30.8 % in 2011, when banking losses crystallised.
