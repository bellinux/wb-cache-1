5|$|Impulse control {{disorders}} including pathological gambling, compulsive sexual behavior, <b>binge</b> <b>eating,</b> compulsive {{shopping and}} reckless generosity {{can be caused}} by medication, particularly orally active dopamine agonists. The dopamine dysregulation syndrome – with wanting of medication leading to overusage – is a rare complication of levodopa use (Giovannoni, et al. 2000).|$|E
5|$|The {{different}} levels of ovarian hormones {{at different stages of}} the cycle have been used to explain eating behaviour changes. Progesterone has been shown to promote fat storage, causing a higher intake of fatty foods during the luteal phase when progesterone levels are higher. Additionally, with a high estrogen level dopamine is ineffective in converting to noradrenaline, a hormone which promotes eating, therefore decreasing appetite. In humans, the level of these ovarian hormones during the menstrual cycle have been found to influence <b>binge</b> <b>eating.</b>|$|E
5|$|Certain {{physical}} and mental illnesses and the pharmaceutical substances used to treat them can increase risk of obesity. Medical illnesses that increase obesity risk include several rare genetic syndromes (listed above) {{as well as some}} congenital or acquired conditions: hypothyroidism, Cushing's syndrome, growth hormone deficiency, and the eating disorders: <b>binge</b> <b>eating</b> disorder and night eating syndrome. However, obesity is not regarded as a psychiatric disorder, and therefore is not listed in the DSM-IVR as a psychiatric illness. The risk of overweight and obesity is higher in patients with psychiatric disorders than in persons without psychiatric disorders.|$|E
50|$|A dysregulation of the ventral limbic circuit {{has been}} found in {{individuals}} who <b>binge</b> <b>eat.</b> The ventral limbic circuit is important in the regulation of feeding behaviour and includes the amygdalae, insula, ventral striatum, ventral regions of the anterior ACC, and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). A stronger activation of the OFC {{has been found}} in patients who <b>binge</b> <b>eat</b> compared to normal weight controls, when viewing pictures of food.|$|R

25|$|Estrogen {{may play}} a role in suppressing <b>binge</b> <b>eating.</b> Hormone {{replacement}} therapy using estrogen may be a possible treatment for <b>binge</b> <b>eating</b> behaviors in females. Estrogen replacement has been shown to suppress <b>binge</b> <b>eating</b> behaviors in female mice. The mechanism by which estrogen replacement inhibits binge-like eating involves the replacement of serotonin (5-HT) neurons. Women exhibiting <b>binge</b> <b>eating</b> behaviors are found to have increased brain uptake of neuron 5-HT, and therefore less of the neurotransmitter serotonin in the cerebrospinal fluid. Estrogen works to activate 5-HT neurons, leading to suppression of binge like eating behaviors.|$|E

25|$|<b>Binge</b> <b>eating</b> {{disorder}} is {{an eating disorder}} characterized by frequent and recurrent <b>binge</b> <b>eating</b> episodes with associated negative psychological and social problems, but without subsequent purging episodes (e.g. vomiting).

25|$|It is {{not known}} if {{combining}} medication with counseling improves the outcomes.

50|$|After being let go by Warner Bros {{in early}} 1926, Prevost's career {{began to decline}} and she was relegated to {{secondary}} roles. She was also beset with personal problems, including {{the death of her}} mother in 1926 and the breakdown of her marriage to actor Kenneth Harlan in 1927, which fueled her depression. She began to abuse alcohol and <b>binge</b> <b>eat,</b> resulting in a weight gain that made it difficult for her to secure acting jobs. By 1935, Prevost was only able to secure bit parts in films. She made her last onscreen appearance in 1936.|$|R
5000|$|Allowance of one [...] "free day" [...] each week. A free day is {{one day a}} week {{in which}} the person is allowed to make dietary choices that do not {{correspond}} with the BFL eating program. Although this should not be a day to <b>binge</b> <b>eat</b> junk food, BFL encourages people to eat whatever foods or desserts they desire on this day. According to Bill Phillips, this allows the body to avoid the Starvation response and gives the dieter a chance to avoid cheating since they know they simply have to wait until their free day to have what they crave.|$|R
25|$|Bulimia is {{more common}} {{among those who have}} a close {{relative}} with the condition. The percentage risk that is estimated to be due to genetics is between 30% and 80%. Other risk factors for the disease include psychological stress, cultural pressure to attain a certain body type, poor self-esteem, and obesity. Living in a culture that promotes dieting and having parents that worry about weight are also risks. Diagnosis is based on a person's medical history, however this is difficult as people are usually secretive about their <b>binge</b> <b>eating</b> and purging habits. Furthermore, the diagnosis of anorexia nervosa takes precedence over that of bulimia. Other similar disorders include <b>binge</b> <b>eating</b> disorder, Kleine-Levin syndrome, and borderline personality disorder.|$|E
25|$|Bulimia nervosa, {{also known}} as simply bulimia, is an eating {{disorder}} characterized by <b>binge</b> <b>eating</b> followed by purging. <b>Binge</b> <b>eating</b> refers to eating {{a large amount of}} food in a short amount of time. Purging refers to the attempts {{to get rid of the}} food consumed. This may be done by vomiting or taking laxatives. Other efforts to lose weight may include the use of diuretics, stimulants, water fasting, or excessive exercise. Most people with bulimia are at a normal weight. The forcing of vomiting may result in thickened skin on the knuckles and breakdown of the teeth. Bulimia is frequently associated with other mental disorders such as depression, anxiety, and problems with drugs or alcohol. There is also a higher risk of suicide and self-harm.|$|E

The self-control for personal harm model reconceptualizes behaviors that have both urge and control components as demonstrating either successful or failed self-control, depending on the incipient urge. The model underscores the role of expected social rewards as an important incentive for which people sometimes engage in personally risky and aversive behaviors despite feeling that they would rather avoid the behaviors and attendant harm. Research from diverse perspectives converges to show that risky behaviors, which might on the surface appear to be self-control failures, can in fact require self-control exertion. Keyword...|$|R

Not only are habitual ruminators more likely to become depressed, but experimental studies have demonstrated that people who are induced to ruminate experience greater depressed mood.

40|$|A {{number of}} studies have found maladaptive eating {{behaviours}} and attitudes in individuals with narcolepsy, however, few studies have comprehensively investigated possible reasons (other than hypocretin deficiency) for these findings. The aim was to investigate the eating behaviours and attitudes of individuals with narcolepsy. The sample consisted of 73 individuals with narcolepsy and 74 controls. Measures used were the Bulimia Test, Depression Anxiety Stress Scale and Epworth Sleepiness Scale, a one day Food and Drink Intake Diary, a newly developed Meal and Snack Timing Questionnaire and an adapted Meal Choice Questionnaire and Snack and Drink Choice Questionnaire. Results showed that individuals with narcolepsy consumed significantly more snacks and drinks than controls. Controls were more concerned about the impact of snack and drink choice on their weight. Individuals with narcolepsy were more likely to <b>binge</b> <b>eat</b> than controls. Individuals with narcolepsy rated the importance of timing food intake with convenience of sleepiness more highly than controls. Individuals with narcolepsy had significantly higher levels of depression, anxiety and stress than controls. Individuals with narcolepsy with moderate t...|$|R
