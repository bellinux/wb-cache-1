For scenes conveying the time and space altering effects of Slo-Mo, Mantle aimed to create images that would <b>be</b> <b>beautiful</b> but disorienting.|$|E

5|$|After all, {{young people}} are always searching for the beauty in love.

This is as true of boys as it is of girls. Ultimately, they know that only God can give them this love. As a result, they are willing to follow Christ, without caring about the sacrifices this may entail.|$|E

25|$|Childbirth in Ghana {{is often}} seen as a joyous {{occasion}} in Ghanaian society, as children represent wealth, status, and the continuation of a lineage. Pregnant women are often given special privileges and are considered to <b>be</b> <b>beautiful,</b> fragile, and vulnerable to evil spirits. Therefore, women may seek guidance from a religious or spiritual diviner to protect their fetus or to increase their chances of conceiving.

25|$|Foot binding was a {{practice}} fashionable in Ming and Qing dynasty China. Young girls' feet, usually at age six but often earlier, were wrapped in tight bandages {{so they could}} not grow normally, would break and become deformed as they reached adulthood. The feet would remain small and dysfunctional, prone to infection, paralysis, and muscular atrophy. While such feet were considered by some to <b>be</b> <b>beautiful,</b> others considered the practice to be archaic and barbaric. In concert with community leaders, the Colonial Government launched an anti-foot binding campaign in 1901. The practice was formally banned in 1915, with violators subject to heavy punishment. Foot binding in Taiwan died out quickly afterwards.|$|E

25|$|The China Poblana was a {{real person}} who lived during the colonial period. Her real name was Mirra. She was an Indian who was brought over from Manila in the 1620s on the Manila Galleon as a child {{to work as a}} slave for the viceroy Marques de Gélves. She was soon sold to ship captain Miguel de Sosa who lived in Puebla. According to legend, Mirra was {{originally}} a princess in her home country but her family was displaced by the Portuguese and she was kidnapped by pirates who sold her. Mirra was considered to <b>be</b> <b>beautiful</b> and exotic. She had been converted to the Catholic faith. Later in her life, she began to have visions of the child Jesus and angels.

500|$|Moffat {{wanted the}} Silurians to be {{redesigned}} and without their former third eye, as Davros {{also had a}} third eye and he wanted the Silurians to be [...] "completely different". They were {{intended to be a}} different branch of the same species, and so the original Silurians still existed. Chibnall wrote for the redesigned Silurians to <b>be</b> <b>beautiful</b> and it was intended for the redesign to capture the actors' features and allow them to give stronger performances and differentiate themselves. Chibnall believed that it complemented the theme in the two-parter about how the humans and Silurians were alike and different. Due to the expensive prosthetics needed, extra Silurians wore face masks which prevented the need for every actor portraying a Silurian to receive the facial prosthetics. Chibnall also incorporated a poisonous tongue into the new branch of Silurians.|$|E
