5|$|In {{the wake}} of a world {{financial}} crisis, the King encouraged the formation of a National Government in 1931 led by MacDonald and Baldwin, and volunteered to reduce the civil list to help balance the budget. He was concerned by the rise to power in Germany of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party. In 1934, the King bluntly told the German ambassador Leopold von Hoesch that Germany was now the peril of the world, and that there was <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a war within ten years if she went on at the present rate; he warned the British ambassador in Berlin Eric Phipps to be suspicious of the Nazis.|$|E

War junks arrived in coves along the Pearl River and notices above the fresh water springs warned that they were poisoned. On 24 August, the Portuguese Governor of Macao, Don Adraio Accacio da Silveira Pinto, announced that the Chinese had ordered him to expel the British from the colony. He warned Lancelot Dent of the British hong Dent & Co. that the Chinese planned to seize the British dwellings in Macao. On 25 August, former Superintendent John Astell proposed to Elliot that all British boats should evacuate to Hong Kong. By {{the end of the}} month, 2,000 people in over 60 ships were in Hong Kong harbour without fresh food or water. The ships held European merchants, lascars, and dozens of British families. The 28-gun frigate Volage of Captain Henry Smith sailed to Hong Kong on 30 August. Smith was an old friend of Elliot from their service in the West Indies Station. Elliot warned Kowloon officials that there was <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> trouble if the embargo continued against the merchant fleet.|$|E

Al-Shabaab responded to the government offensive by putting up roadblocks to prevent the movement of goods from the seaport.

25|$|When the Spaniards arrived, {{the ruler}} of the Aztec empire was Moctezuma II, who was later killed. His {{successor}} and brother Cuitláhuac {{took control of the}} Aztec empire, but {{was among the first to}} fall from the first smallpox epidemic in the area a short time later. Unintentionally introduced by Spanish conquerors, among whom smallpox was endemic, the infectious disease ravaged Mesoamerica in the 1520s. It killed more than 3 million natives as they had no immunity. Other sources, however, mentioned that the death toll of the Aztecs might have reached 15 million (out of a population of less than 30 million) although such a high number conflicts with the 350,000 Aztecs who ruled an empire of 5 million or 10 million. Severely weakened, the Aztec empire was easily defeated by Cortés and his forces on his second return with the help of state of Tlaxcala whose population estimate was 300,000. The native population declined 80–90% by 1600 to 1–2.5 million. Any population estimate of pre-Columbian Mexico is <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a guess but 8–12 million is often suggested for the area encompassed by the modern nation.|$|E

[...] For the Los Angeles Times, Carina Chocano writes: [...] "sticklers for linear storytelling are <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> frustrated by narrative threads that start promisingly, then just sort of fall off the spool".

40|$|Deciding {{infinite}} two-player {{games on}} finite graphs with the winning condition specified by a linear temporal logic (Ltl) formula, <b>is</b> known <b>to</b> <b>be</b> 2 Exptime-complete. In this paper, we identify Ltl fragments of lower complexity. Solving Ltl games typically involves a doubly exponential translation from Ltl formulas to deterministic ω-automata. First, {{we show that}} the longest distance (length of the longest simple path) of the generator {{is also an important}} parameter, by giving an O(d log n) -space procedure to solve a Büchi game on a graph with n vertices and longest distance d. Then, for the Ltl fragment of the boolean combinations of formulas obtained only by eventualities and conjunctions, we provide a translation to deterministic generators of exponential size and linear longest distance, show both of these <b>bounds</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> optimal, and prove the corresponding games <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Pspace-complete. Introducing next modalities in this fragment, we give a translation to deterministic generators still of exponential size but also with exponential longest distance, show both of these <b>bounds</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> optimal, and prove the corresponding games <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Exptime-complete. For the fragment resulting by further adding disjunctions, we provide a translation to deterministic generators of doubly exponential size and exponential longest distance, show both of these <b>bounds</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> optimal, and prove the corresponding games <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Expspace.

500|$|In June 2007, {{prior to}} production, a German Defence Ministry {{spokesperson}} said that filming of Valkyrie {{would not be}} allowed at the country's military sites if protagonist Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg was portrayed by Tom Cruise, due to the actor's adherence to Scientology, which is regarded as a dangerous cult by the German authorities. The spokesperson further indicated that the ministry had not at that time received official filming requests from Valkyries producers. Colonel Stauffenberg's eldest child, retired Bundeswehr general Berthold Maria Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg, also voiced concerns over Cruise's portrayal of his father, saying that he would not oppose the film's production, but hoped that Cruise would drop the role. [...] "I fear that only terrible kitsch will come out of the project. It's <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> rubbish," [...] he said. [...] "Cruise should keep his hands off my father."

500|$|In {{the text}} {{accompanying}} the first recording of Sonatas and Interludes, Cage specifically {{stated that the}} use of preparations is not a criticism of the instrument, but a simple practical measure. Cage started composing for prepared piano in 1940, when he wrote a piece called Bacchanale for a dance by Syvilla Fort, and by 1946 had already composed a large number of works for the instrument. However, in Sonatas and Interludes the preparation is very complex, more so than in any of the earlier pieces. Forty-five notes are prepared, mostly using screws and various types of bolts, but also with fifteen pieces of rubber, four pieces of plastic, several nuts and one eraser. It takes about two or three hours to prepare a piano for performance. Despite the detailed instructions, any preparation is <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> different from any other, and Cage himself suggested that there is no strict plan to adhere to: [...] "if you enjoy playing the Sonatas and Interludes then do it so that it seems right to you".|$|E

Considine of The Baltimore Sun noted that Madonna's [...] "newfound {{strength}} is particularly apparent in pulsing, rhythm driven tracks like , which finds her soaring confidently {{at the top of}} her register on the busily percolating chorus, then whispering breathily on the brief, dream-like bridge". David Browne, while reviewing Ray of Light for Entertainment Weekly, titled the song as [...] "sirenlike techno-glitter-ball". Idolator's Stephen Sears explained that Madonna's vocals throughout the album were a [...] "game-changer", including on the song, as she strengthened her voice while working on her film Evita. He ends his review by stating [...] "Indeed, no choir is needed to lift 'Ray Of Light' into disco heaven. Madonna supplies the highs herself in some perfect moments: the extended, spiraling way she wails 'yea-ea-ears' at 3:27 or how her vocal spins out of control at 4:14, matched by Orbit's frenzied guitar work".|$|E

The second driver was later confirmed as his more experienced compatriot Roberto Moreno, who had last competed in F1 back in [...] when he had a disastrous year driving for the infamous Andrea Moda team. However, his seat was initially only guaranteed on a race-by-race basis, as Portuguese driver Pedro Lamy, in addition to the team's former F3000 drivers Emanuele Naspetti and Andrea Montermini, were also considered. It was speculated that whoever joined the team would be contractually <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> number two to Diniz and that his father had insisted on an all-Brazilian driver line-up. A Forti spokesman indeed confirmed that Moreno's nationality, in addition to his experience, was the main reason for his selection.
