50|$|Walker's {{natural history}} lectures spanned the {{academic}} year and {{were divided into two}} sections. The {{first half of the year}} he gave his 'Hippocratean' lectures, that is, meteorology, hydrology and geology. The second half of the year was devoted to the three kingdoms of nature: minerals, plants, and animals. During the 1760s, he had accepted Linnaeus' <b>binomial</b> <b>classification</b> <b>system</b> and during his university tenure he readily applied it to botany. However, he did not agree with Linnaeus' classification of minerals and animals and therefore he developed his own unique system for both of these subjects. As shown by Matthew Daniel Eddy, Walker developed a sophisticated theory of the earth based on evidence gathered from geochemistry and human history. Throughout his entire career he kept his ties with the Kirk and in 1790 he was elected to be Moderator, its highest position. Sometime in the late 1790s he began to lose his sight and several of his lectures were taken over by Dr Robert Jameson, a physician and former student who had also studied in mainland Europe. By the time that he died in 1803, Walker had taught well over eight hundred students, some of whom would go on to have a significant impact on nineteenth century natural history. Some of these names include Rev. Prof. John Playfair, Sir James Edward Smith, Sir James Hall, Mungo Park, Robert Waring Darwin, Robert Brown, Thomas Beddoes, Thomas Charles Hope, and Samuel Latham Mitchell.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the effects of {{pressure}} ulcer <b>classification</b> <b>system</b> education on hospital nurses’ knowledge and visual discrimination ability of pressure ulcer <b>classification</b> <b>system</b> and incontinence-associated dermatitis. Methods: One group pre- and post-test was used. A convenience sample of 96 nurses participating in pressure ulcer <b>classification</b> <b>system</b> edu-cation, were enrolled in single institute. The education program was composed of a 50 -minute lecture on pressure ulcer <b>classification</b> <b>system</b> and case-studies. The pressure ulcer <b>classification</b> <b>system</b> and incontinence-associated dermatitis knowledge test and visual discrimination tool, consisting of 21 photographs including clinical information were used. Paired t-test was performed using SPSS/ WIN 18. 0. Results: The overall mean difference of pressure ulcer <b>classification</b> <b>system</b> knowledge (t = 4. 67, p <. 001) and visual dis-crimination ability (t = 10. 58, p <. 001) were statistically and significantly increased after pressure ulcer <b>classification</b> <b>system</b> educa-tion.

40|$|Abstract Background Dengue disease {{severity}} {{is usually}} classified using criteria {{set up by}} the World Health Organization (WHO). We aimed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the WHO <b>classification</b> <b>system</b> and modifications to this system, and evaluated their potential practical usefulness. Methods Patients, admitted consecutively to the hospital with severe dengue, were classified using the WHO <b>classification</b> <b>system</b> and modifications to this system. Treating physicians were asked to classify patients immediately after discharge. We calculated the sensitivity of the various <b>classification</b> <b>systems</b> for the detection of shock and the agreement between the various <b>classification</b> <b>systems</b> and the treating physician's classification. Results Of 152 patients with confirmed dengue, sixty-six (43 %) had evidence of circulatory failure. The WHO <b>classification</b> <b>system</b> had a sensitivity of 86 % (95 %CI 76 – 94) for the detection of patients with shock. All modifications to the WHO <b>classification</b> <b>system</b> had a higher sensitivity than the WHO <b>classification</b> <b>system</b> (sensitivity ranging from 88 % to 99 %). The WHO <b>classification</b> <b>system</b> was in only modest agreement with the intuitive classification by treating physicians whereas several modified <b>classification</b> <b>systems</b> were in good agreement. Conclusion The use of the WHO <b>classification</b> <b>system</b> to classify dengue disease severity is to be questioned, because it is not accurate in correctly classifying dengue disease severity and it lacks sufficient agreement with clinical practice. </p...|$|R

40|$|Several {{methods of}} {{classification}} of partially edentulous arches {{have been proposed}} and are in use. The most familiar classifications are those originally proposed by Kennedy, Cummer, and Bailyn. None of these <b>classification</b> <b>systems</b> include implants, simply because {{most of them were}} proposed before implants became widely accepted. At this time, there is no <b>classification</b> <b>system</b> for partially edentulous arches incorporating implants placed or to be placed in the edentulous spaces for a removable partial denture (RPD).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{describe}} the new subject <b>classification</b> <b>system</b> for the NCSTRL+ project. NCSTRL+ is a canonical digital library (DL) based on the Networked Computer Science Technical Report Library (NCSTRL).

Examination of other scientific and technical information <b>classification</b> <b>systems</b> showed similar discipline-centric weaknesses. Traditional, library-oriented <b>classification</b> <b>systems</b> represented all disciplines, but were too generalized to serve the needs of a scientific and technically oriented digital library. Lack of a suitable existing <b>classification</b> <b>system</b> led to the creation of a lightweight, balanced, general <b>classification</b> <b>system</b> that allows the mapping of more specialized classification schemes into the new framework.

40|$|Purpose: This paper {{distinguishes between}} “methodology” and “method” and {{discusses}} methodological levels of abductive logic {{as related to}} the knowledge <b>classification</b> <b>systems.</b> The purpose is to clarify the application of abductive logic for analyzing knowledge <b>classification</b> <b>systems</b> as an alternative for mainstream logics in the field, i. e. inductive and deductive logic. Methodology: Conceptual analysis. Findings: Abductive logic approaches reality as a social construction. It is obviously an interpretative and constructivist approach. Therefore its aim is to understand the social phenomena that socially constructed by social agents. Therefore any given knowledge <b>classification</b> <b>system</b> is a socially constructed phenomenon reflecting subjective biases and prejudices of its creators. Knowledge <b>classification</b> <b>systems</b> aren’t innocent objective systems. They are systems that determined and restricted by cultural and social forces operating as their conditions of production.
