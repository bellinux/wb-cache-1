5|$|The AFM {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} Pentecostal {{movement}} is South Africa with roots in the Azusa Street Revival, the Holiness Movement teachings of Andrew Murray and the teachings of John Alexander Dowie. The AFM had an interracial character when it started, but, as in American Pentecostalism, this interracial cooperation was short-lived. The decades from the 1950s to the 1980s were marked by the implementation of apartheid. After 1994, the white AFM moved rapidly towards unification with the <b>black</b> <b>churches.</b> By 1996, all the AFM churches were united in a single multi-racial church.|$|E

5|$|<b>Black</b> <b>churches</b> in Maryland hosted many musical, {{as well as}} {{political}} and educational, activities, and many African American musicians got their start performing in churches, including Anne Brown, Marian Anderson, Ethel Ennis and Cab Calloway, in the 20th century. Doctrinal disputes did not prevent musical cooperation, which included both sacred and secular music. Church choirs frequently worked together, even across denominational divides, and church-goers often visited other establishments to see visiting performers. Organists were a major part of African American church music in Baltimore, and some organists became well known, Baltimore's including Sherman Smith of Union Baptist, Luther Mitchell of Centennial Methodist and Julia Calloway of Sharon Baptist. Many churches also offered music education, beginning as early as the 1870s with St. Francis Academy.|$|E

5|$|In 1957, King, Ralph Abernathy, Fred Shuttlesworth, Joseph Lowery, {{and other}} {{civil rights activists}} founded the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC).

One of the group's inspirations was the crusades of evangelist Billy Graham, who befriended King after he attended a Graham crusade in New York City in 1957. King led the SCLC until his death. The SCLC's 1957 Prayer Pilgrimage for Freedom was the first time King addressed a national audience. Other civil rights leaders involved in the SCLC with King included: James Bevel, Allen Johnson, Curtis W. Harris, Walter E. Fauntroy, C. T.

5|$|The Indians had a doubleheader {{against the}} White Sox on Sunday, July 6, for which 31,566 were in attendance; it was {{estimated}} that approximately 30 percent of the crowd were black. Some congregations of <b>black</b> <b>churches</b> let out early while others walked immediately from Sunday service to Comiskey Park. Boudreau had Doby pinch-hit in the first game but for the second, listed him a starter at first base, a position Doby was not expected to fill when the Indians brought him up to play at second base. Doby had played the position before with the Eagles but was without a proper mitt for first base and met much resistance when attempts were made to borrow one from teammates, including first baseman Eddie Robinson, for whom Boudreau had asked Doby to replace that day. Doby said only because Gordon asked in the clubhouse to borrow one of the first baseman's mitts did he have one to use in the second game of the doubleheader as earlier direct requests from Doby were rejected. The mitt was loaned by a White Sox player. Boudreau recounts an incident where Robinson refused the mitt to Doby, but when asked by Indians traveling secretary Spud Goldstein, Robinson obliged. It was the only game Doby started {{for the remainder of the}} season. Doby recorded his first major league hit in four at-bats and had an RBI in a 5â€“1 Indians win.|$|E

40|$|From 1997 to 2013, {{there have}} been {{multiple}} representations of the <b>black</b> <b>church</b> in popular culture. African American artists have always explored spirituality within black communities; in the late 20 th and early 21 st centuries, however, the increasing fame of Tyler Perry, T. D.

This dissertation examines contemporary black Christian popular fiction, stage performances, <b>black</b> <b>church</b> films, and rap music. These representations demonstrate that <b>black</b> <b>church</b> culture is distinct from secular black popular culture and white evangelical Christian culture. The construction of these texts has proven the power of black consumers, created a space for a greater diversity of roles for black actors, and revived a black counter-public who actively debates representations of spirituality and sexuality in <b>black</b> <b>church</b> culture texts. Contemporary representations of the <b>black</b> <b>church</b> engage in a sexual discourse that upholds heteronormative, patriarchal values which are consistent with evangelical interpretations of Christianity...|$|R
40|$|This article {{sets forth}} a {{controversial}} thesis {{which suggests that}} the Uniting Reformed Church in Southern Africa, although considered a <b>black</b> <b>church,</b> is in fact not a <b>black</b> <b>church</b> in the sense in which a radical <b>black</b> <b>church</b> is traditionally understood. A <b>black</b> <b>church,</b> it is argued, is perceived to be one that is a self-determined church which supports initiatives of ameliorating the depressive situations in which black people find themselves. References are made to black theology as a critical theology which was never accepted in the <b>black</b> <b>church</b> due to the dependency syndrome which was brought about by the white benevolence of the Dutch Reformed Church. This, it is argued, had become innate in the Uniting Reformed Church in Southern Africa which still considers itself as a so-called daughter church of the white Dutch Reformed Church...|$|R

40|$|From {{within the}} {{disciplinary}} location of Practical Theology, {{this study will}} argue {{that some of the}} practices of the contemporary <b>Black</b> <b>Church</b> are not as relevant and constructive as they could be. Â  This current state of <b>Black</b> <b>Church</b> praxis is due, in part, to inadequate methods used in the creation and maintenance of <b>Black</b> <b>Church</b> praxis. Using a Practical Theology method, this thesis will study this phenomenon and seek to find ways to address key issues that impact church praxis in the African American context and develop an approach to creating <b>Black</b> <b>Church</b> praxis that is relevant, constructive and faithful to the Christian gospel message. This study will show how the values and meanings that are in and behind <b>Black</b> <b>Church</b> praxis are the products of particular and historical locations, or Black thematic universe. This study will also show how the historical Black thematic universe, which shaped much of the early <b>Black</b> <b>Church</b> in America, has begun to fade and there is emerging a contemporary Black thematic universe whose dominant realities differ from it. This study will also argue that the religious and historical legacy of the <b>Black</b> <b>Church</b> is characterized by a praxiological commitment to the creation and maintenance of relevant and constructive praxis. Â  That praxis, historically, was created and maintained by drawing on the full resources of the Black faith community â€“ historical, cultural, religious, and theological â€“ to create an informed faith response to the existential realities of is contextual location. This is a key strength of the Black faith tradition in America, which this study argues must be recovered and revised in light of the contemporary context in which the <b>Black</b> <b>Church</b> now finds itself.
