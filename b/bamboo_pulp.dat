The most common bamboo species used for paper are Dendrocalamus asper and Bambusa blumeana. It is also possible to make dissolving pulp from bamboo. The average fiber length is similar to hardwoods, but the properties of <b>bamboo</b> <b>pulp</b> are closer to softwood pulps due to it having a very broad fiber length distribution.

40|$|In this experiment, several {{bleaching}} {{methods of}} <b>bamboo</b> kraft <b>pulp</b> used chlorine, alkali and Ca-hypochlorite on 4 - to 7 -stage bleaching process and were discussed from the stand point of brightness. 1) Amount of addition of total chlorine The chlorine required amount for unbleached <b>bamboo</b> kraft <b>pulp</b> is about 10 % {{from the base}} of wood pulp by KMnO_ 4 value. It is possible to obtain bleached pulp which has brightness above 85 with less amount of chlorine by this multistage bleaching process. From this fact, it is hard to say that <b>bamboo</b> kraft <b>pulp</b> is more difficult to bleach than wood pulp. Namely on the 4 -stage bleaching 9 % of chlorine was required, but on the 6 - and 7 -stage bleaching process 6 % of chlorine was satisfactory and brightness was 85 ～ 90. According to O. S. SPROUT, and W. TOOREY et al., the 5 -stage bleaching process, Cl-Na-Cl-H-H, required 6. 63 % of total chlorine to obtained brightness of 86, and the 6 -stage bleaching process also needed the same amount of chlorine. From the data of this experiment, bleachability of <b>bamboo</b> kraft <b>pulp</b> showed better results than wood kraft pulp. 2) Ratio of chlorine On the multistage bleaching process, the problems are how much chlorine and in what ratio should it be added on each stage for the most effective bleaching. Principally, it is considered that the best way is to add a large amount of chlorine on the first stage and decreased gradually. However, this report shown that the principal method is not always suitable from the relationship of chemical actions, and in the discussed chlorine ratio, it was decided that the ratio of Cl: Ca-hypochlorite was divided into definite ratios. Uusually the ratio of 7 : 3 or 8 : 2 was adapted to wood kraft pulp, but in actual industry it is not established and it is differed depending on the factory. [table] In the case of <b>bamboo</b> kraft <b>pulp</b> as shown in this experiment on the ratio of 4 : 6 or 6 : 4 was given good result. The effect of Cl: Ca-hypochlorite ratio was remarkable on the 4 -stage bleaching process, but less with the increase of stages in process. It was impossible to neglect this effect and about equal ratio showed better results. 3) Bleaching method If brightness was required at about 80, the 4 -stage bleaching process was enough for this purpose, and farther more if well controlled, brightness would be raised above 85. Higher value of brightness pulp was obtained constantly with 6 -stage of bleaching process. It is assumed that the 7 -stage bleaching process is not necessary because the results were same as the 6 -stage bleaching process. The most adequate process in the 6 -stage bleaching process was Cl-Na-H-Cl-Na-H or Cl-Na-Cl-Na-H-H...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background With the {{availability}} of rice and sorghum genome sequences and ongoing efforts to sequence genomes of other cereal and energy crops, the grass family (Poaceae) has become a model system for comparative genomics and for better understanding gene and genome evolution that underlies phenotypic and ecological divergence of plants. While the genomic resources have accumulated rapidly for almost all major lineages of grasses, bamboo remains the only large subfamily of Poaceae with little genomic information available in databases, which seriously hampers our ability to take a {{full advantage of the}} wealth of grass genomic data for effective comparative studies. Results Here we report the cloning and sequencing of 10, 608 putative full length cDNAs (FL-cDNAs) primarily from Moso bamboo, Phyllostachys heterocycla cv. pubescens, a large woody bamboo with the highest ecological and economic values of all bamboos. This represents the third largest FL-cDNA collection to date of all plant species, and provides the first insight into the gene and genome structures of bamboos. We developed a Moso bamboo genomic resource database that so far contained the sequences of 10, 608 putative FL-cDNAs and nearly 38, 000 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) generated in this study. Conclusion Analysis of FL-cDNA sequences show that bamboo diverged from its close relatives such as rice, wheat, and barley through an adaptive radiation.

40|$|Sudan {{is almost}} entirely {{depending}} on imports to satisfy its needs of pulp and paper. Out of the total paper consumption (92 %) only 8 % is locally produced. The {{pulp and paper industry}} is looking for unconventional fibrous raw materials for producing different kind of papers and boards. Sudan is endowed with both wood and nonwood lignocellulosic raw materials, all of them are available at the moment due {{to the end of the}} civil war in the South, especially the softwood forests. There must also be a sufficient supply of good quality raw material for running the process throughout the year. It has been shown that nonwood fibrous materials have high biomass production capacity and the pulp yields obtained have in most cases been higher than those from wood species. Nonwood fibres are an important source of raw materials, especially in developing countries. They can be by-product of agriculture such as bagasse and cereal straws, or industrial crops like bamboo, esparto, sisal, flax and hemp. Two bamboo species, Oxytenanthera abyssinica and Bambusa vulgaris together with an industrial by-product, namely bagasse, have been investigated for their potential for producing pulp and paper. The density (for bamboos), fibre dimensions, morphological indices and chemical composition of the raw materials studied were determined. The kraft, kraft-AQ, soda, soda-AQ, AS-AQ and ASAM pulping processes were applied and some of the pulps produced were bleached according to the TCF bleaching methods. The trials to improve the pulp properties included blending of <b>bamboo</b> and bagasse <b>pulps.</b> The average basic density of the two bamboo species was in the range of tropical hardwood of 150 - 1150 kg/m 3 and in the middle for commercial pulpwoods (350 - 650 kg/m 3). The fibre dimensions were microscopically evaluated. The average fibre length of Oxytenanthera abyssinica (1. 5 mm), Bambusa vulgaris (2. 1 mm) and bagasse (1. 7 mm) were in the range of softwood and bamboo (1 - 7 mm). The fibre length of bambusa is considered as long, but that of oxytenanthera is medium-long. The fibre width of the two bamboo species was nearly the same, medium-narrow and of hardwood range (10 - XI 35 μm). According to flexibility coefficients oxytenanthera have higher bonding strength (tensile, burst, double folds). The thicker wall of bambusa (4. 6 μm) compared to that of oxytenanthera (3. 7 μm) indicated a very different morphological indices and behaviour. The narrow fibres of bagasse (8. 4 μm) had wide lumens (5. 2 μm) and thin cell wall thickness (1. 6 μm). Their good flexibility coefficient (62) indicate their ability to collapse easily and to form interfiber bonding important for paper strength. The chemical composition of the raw materials was typical for non-woody plants. They have high ash content, especially silica and low lignin contents. The very good cellulose content of bagasse (54. 8 %) predicted very good to excellent pulp yield. The higher cellulose content (56. 6 %) of oxytenanthera predicted better yields than from bambusa. The overall chemical composition indicates the suitability of alkaline methods for pulping with reasonable alkali charges and predicted good to excellent yields. This was demonstrated by cookings with different alkali charges. Bagasse was pulped easily with alkali charge of 10. 9 - 12. 4 % as Na 2 O for 155 - 160 minutes cooking time at maximum temperature of 170 oC to bleachable kappa number. Bamboo cooking was carried out with alkali charges of 17 - 18. 6 % as Na 2 O for 165 minutes at 170 oC The bagasse alkaline sulphite-anthraquinone pulping gave a very high screened yield (57 %) of a bleachable pulp with a very low kappa number, high viscosity, and high initial ISO brightness. The bagasse soda–AQ cooking gave excellent yield of nearly 58 %. The kraft <b>pulp</b> of <b>bamboo</b> was superior to soda and soda-AQ pulps in all strength properties except for the tensile index of bambusa soda-AQ pulp. Addition of anthraquinone in the kraft <b>pulping</b> of <b>bamboo</b> increased the yield and improved the strength properties. The best bamboo cooking results were obtained with the ASAM process, which gave higher pulp yield and superior optical and strength properties than the kraft process. Higher yield, lower kappa numbers, superior viscosity and brightness were obtained at high pulp strength level for the both bamboo species. XII Oxytenanthera AS-AQ pulp was blended with the strongly bonding bagasse AS-AQ pulp in three ratios (10 : 90, 30 : 70, 50 : 50). With all blending ratios the tensile strength of oxy/bag pulp blends was improved, and the values were more or less the same as for 100 % bagasse pulp. On the other hand, the tear index of the blends was improved compared to that of 100 % bagasse pulp, and 50 : 50 blends were with the highest tear strength. TCF bleaching with Q 1 O/PQ 2 P sequence was applied for bagasse soda, soda-AQ and AS-AQ pulps. The bleached pulps reached a final ISO brightness of 71. 6, 74. 1 and 76. 9 % respectively at a kappa number of 1. 6 – 3. 9 and viscosity in the range of 790 - 990 ml/g. The oxytenanthera pulps Kraft and ASAM were bleached with OQ 1 O/PP sequence. Good bleachability for the oxytenanthera pulps was comparatively difficult to attain as it required additional chemical charges due to the high lignin content of the unbleached pulps. The kappa numbers of the kraft and ASAM pulps were reduced from 24. 8 to 6. 6 and from 19. 4 to 8. 0 respectively. The ISO brightness obtained was about 82 % for the both pulps. The viscosity loss for both pulp types and especially for the ASAM pulps was small (from 1024 to 885 g/ml and 1114 to 1054 g/ml respectively). The addition of DTPA at the chelation stages (Q) improved the delignification selectivity, resulting in an increased ISO brightness in both cases. In the final peroxide stage the addition of DTPMPA (0. 05 %) and MgSO 4 had been proved beneficial for successful peroxide bleaching. All raw materials chosen were well suited for obtaining pulp with acceptable to excellent yield with the most suitable pulping process tried, according to their individual characteristics.

The higher mechanical strength and the lower incidence of morphological defects in the fiber (6. 0 % of curls and 10. 6 % of kinks) can demonstrate the potential of organosolv <b>bamboo</b> <b>pulp</b> as a reinforcing element...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Bamboo, {{as a kind}} of non-wood raw material, has a long, thin fiber {{with wide}} {{distribution}} and rich abundance in China. Its pulping properties are between softwood and hardwood. Adapting to the Chinese situation, developing <b>bamboo</b> <b>pulp</b> industrialization, according to the local conditions, is an available way to solve the shortage of fiber material for paper-making. Delignification of bamboo (Neosinocalamus) was carried out by conventional kraft and soda pulping under varying conditions to determine the relationships between selected cooking parameters (EA 14 ~ 20 %, sulfidity 0 ~ 40 %, maximum temperature 160 and 165 ℃, and time at maximum temperature 60 ~ 110 min) and pulp properties (kappa number and yield). Results indicated that in order to obtain relatively low kappa numbers(17 ~ 27), high sulfidity(20 ~ 40 %) at lower EA(14 ~ 16 %) increased pulp yield compared to the case of low sulfidity(0 ~ 10 %) at higher EA(16 ~ 18 %). Pulp with lower kappa numbers (13 ~ 15) and acceptable yield can be obtained at a sulfidity level of 20 ~ 30 % with 18 % EA or at a sulfidity level of 10 ~ 30 % with 20 % EA. Meanwhile, <b>bamboo</b> <b>pulp</b> in this condition not only helps to decrease kappa number in the subsequent oxygen delignification process, but also reduces the cost of chemicals in the bleaching process...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Focusing on {{the demand}} for green buffer {{material}} with increasingly rapid growth of Express packaging market and main discuss the technology of foamed bamboo fiber and pay more attention on producing them. Add 40 g bamboo powder and <b>bamboo</b> <b>pulp</b> as the original reaction materials, and then contrast the foamed productions. The results show the <b>bamboo</b> <b>pulp</b> has a better buffer ability. Add different contents of photo starches and contrast {{the results of the}} experiments, and then it could conclude that 20 g photo starches could bond the bamboo fibers and adhesives well. By selecting different kinds of foamed reagents and researching the suitable ratio of them, it could concludes that organic foamed adhesive AC should be 0. 3 g, and inorganic foamed adhesive should be (3 gNaHCO 3 : 2 gNH 3 HCO 3 : 1 g(NH 3) 2 CO 3). By adding different contents of CaCO 3, it could conclude that 4 g is the best value. By contrasting the validity of microwaves oven and high temperature container, it could conclude that put the composites into the microwaves for 7 minutes will not only have a high quality, but also a short time. Finally cut the foamed bamboo fiber productions into small grains. Test the static buffer characteristics of the small grains, and then F-X, σ-ε, C-ε curves could be recorded...|$|E

40|$|Key words：Bamboo {{kraft pulp}}, Oxygen {{delignification}}, High Kappa number Abstract：Bamboo kraft pulp with Kappa number of 25. 6 was sampled, and oxygen delignification {{was applied to}} bleach these <b>bamboo</b> <b>pulp</b> samples. By investigating yield, Kappa number, viscosity, brightness of pulp, and delignification selectivity, it has been proven that caustic soda dosage and reaction temperature were major factors for oxygen delignification. The optimal conditions for oxygen delignification were proposed as follows: alkali dosage of 3. 5 % on o. d. pulp-mass, reaction temperature of 85 ℃, oxygen pressure of 0. 6 MPa, and temperature retention time of 80 min. Two stages of oxygen delignification were used and no washing between the two was required. It was found that delignification efficiency and selectivity to lignin-removal were improved significantly. In addition, adding hydroquinone compounds during oxygen delignification can improve the qualities greatly such as higher viscosity and better selectivity of delignification...|$|E
