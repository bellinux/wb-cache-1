25|$|Doro's {{character}} {{plays an}} important role in the novel because he has total control over all of the other characters. Part of the reason that Doro has so much control is because he determines whether one lives or dies. Doro has the gift and curse of being able to take on the body of anyone he desires. This is a gift because he is immortal, but it is a curse because when a body gets old, it is mandatory that he changes bodies in order to live. In order for Doro to survive, he must kill. This causes the other characters to be very wary of how they behave around Doro <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> their life can be over at any moment. Another reason that Doro has so much control is because he is a man. The fact that he is a man makes it much easier for him to control other women, especially Anyanwu. Anyanwu is physically strong enough to fight Doro, but there are times where she does not retaliate against his physical abuse. Doro uses sex to draw women close to him and to create an emotional bond that makes it hard for them to leave.|$|E
500|$|Gernsback {{claimed that}} science fiction was educational. He {{repeatedly}} made this assertion in Amazing Stories, {{and continued to}} do so in his editorials for the new magazines, stating, for example, that [...] "teachers encourage the reading of this fiction <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> it gives the pupil a fundamental knowledge of science and aviation." [...] He also recruited a panel of [...] "nationally known educators [...] pass upon the scientific principles of all stories". Science fiction historian Everett Bleiler describes this as [...] "fakery, pure and simple", asserting that {{there is no evidence that}} the men on the panel—some of whom, such as Lee De Forest, were well-known scientists—had any editorial influence. However, Donald Menzel, the astrophysicist on the panel, has said that Gernsback sent him manuscripts and made changes to stories as a result of Menzel's commentary.|$|E

500|$|Gernsback {{believed}} that science fiction was educational, claiming, for example, that [...] "teachers encourage {{the reading of}} this fiction <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> it gives the pupil a fundamental knowledge of science and aviation". [...] He intended Scientific Detective Monthly to be a detective magazine in which the stories had a scientific background; it would entertain, but also instruct. [...] The subgenre of scientific detective fiction was not new; it had first become popular in the U.S. between 1909 and 1919, {{and the appearance of}} Gernsback's magazine was part of a resurgence of popularity in the subgenre {{at the end of the}} 1920s. [...] The first issue was dated January 1930 (meaning it would have been on the newsstands in mid-December 1929). [...] Gernsback was editor-in-chief, and had final say on the choice of stories, but the editorial work was done by his deputy, Hector Grey.|$|E
2500|$|It {{has also}} been {{discovered}} {{that there is no}} scientific research that directly links naturally high testosterone levels to women’s success in sports. [...] Most people assume that women with high levels of testosterone will be more athletic <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> men have higher levels of testosterone and are usually seen to have more athletic prowess than their female counterparts. [...] Even though testosterone can be a factor in athletic ability, so can a number of other factors, like “physique, thermoregulation, biomechanics, oxygen uptake, training, and genetics, as well as the psychological and the social”. [...] The policy also does not distinguish between natural and enhanced testosterone, and many believe that only doping on testosterone should be regulated against because regulating anything else is just another form of covert discrimination.|$|E

Electrical waste contains hazardous but also valuable and scarce materials. Up to 60 elements can be found in complex electronics. As of [...] 2013, Apple has sold over 796 million iDevices (iPod, iPhone, iPad). Cell phone companies make cell phones that are not made to last so that the consumer will purchase new phones. Companies give these products such short life spans <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> the consumer will want a new product and will buy it if they make it.

2500|$|UNESCO's Director-General Irina Bokova {{has warned}} that ISIL is {{destroying}} Iraq's cultural heritage, {{in what she}} has called [...] "cultural cleansing". [...] "We don't have time to lose because extremists are trying to erase the identity, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> {{if there is no}} identity, there is no memory, there is no history", she said. Referring to the ancient cultures of Christians, Yazidis and other minorities, she said, [...] "This is a way to destroy identity. You deprive them of their culture, you deprive them of their history, their heritage, and that is why it {{goes hand in hand with}} genocide. Along with the physical persecution they want to eliminate – to delete – the memory of these different cultures ... we think this is appalling, and this is not acceptable." [...] Saad Eskander, head of Iraq's National Archives said, [...] "For the first time you have cultural cleansing... For the Yazidis, religion is oral, nothing is written. By destroying their places of worship... you are killing cultural memory. It is the same with the Christians – it really is a threat beyond belief." ...|$|E
2500|$|Just as Lancashire's tail {{had pushed}} {{on at the}} end of their innings, so did Somerset's on the third day. Blackwell made his second century in two innings, finally {{surrendering}} on 122. The second-highest scorer was Richard Johnson with 40. Blackwell explained, [...] "I've changed a few things this year and started to bat on off stump. A lot of bowlers have been going across me <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> I go at widish balls. The ball's now closer to me if it's slanted across and I'm backing my hand-eye co-ordination to avoid being lbw." [...] The day itself was very cold, with Blackwell saying, [...] "It was absolutely perishing out there. I think play should be abandoned if it gets that cold." [...] After Somerset were dismissed for 272, six Somerset men came out to field sporting woollen hats. Bad light and rain meant the day ended at 2.07pm, with Lancashire on 33 for 1, 84 runs ahead. Whilst a Lancashire victory was not out of the question, the most likely result was the draw.|$|E
2500|$|While {{living in}} Cold Springs he {{maintained}} {{a friendship with}} another writer Conrad Richter. Conrad and his wife lived in Pine Grove, Pennsylvania, which was a nearby town. Letters between the two as well as pictures in possession of the family reflect a close camaraderie. Conrad once wrote [...] "If anyone has a unique paradise of his own on earth, that one is Mulford Foster, Master {{of one of the}} prettiest and wildest valleys in Pennsylvania, he has on his immense primeval estate a limpid lake where wood creatures come down to drink, a magic winding little river for his silent canoe, a collection of almost every variety of domestic animal and bird, pet skunks, several dozen kinds of tamed snakes, wild flowers, trees and shrubs and a million wild creatures that have flocked to his place from the mountains about <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> no harm can come to them here, and Foster attired in brown flannel and stealing noiselessly through the woods with the light foot and deftness of a Mohican, is all day long and often at evening out among them.".|$|E

2500|$|Brøderbund Software’s {{marketing}} strategy {{aimed at a}} target demographic: [...] "young parents who have a computer at home and want their kids to learn while playing". To do this, it created edutainment titles with [...] "entertaining graphics and sound", beta-tested them with kids to ensure they were easy to use, and had deals with retailers like Best Buy and Babbages. An MHHE document entitled Marketing’s Role within the Firm or Nonprofit Organization explained [...] "retailers are happy to give new Brøderbund products shelf space <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> Brøderbund’s promotion will help bring customers into the store". In the case of Great Chase Through Time, Brøderbund [...] "not only placed ads in family-oriented computer magazines but also sent direct-mail flyers to its registered customers". Due to brand loyalty, Carmen Sandiego games were able to be sold for more money than software from other companies. Parents appreciated that it [...] "caters to their needs and offers good customer value". The Mirror held a promotion where they would give away 10 copies of the video game through The A List. The game {{was included in the}} TLC School Alliance, which saw its titles being sold at discount at theNSBA Conference in Nashville and the California CUE Conference in Santa Clara. James Lyband Jackson, Computer Education Coordinator for both the YWCA/Day Care and the Church, included the [...] " [...] hands-on history" [...] program as part of their education program. The School Edition of the game came with a three-ring binder to hold the software, a User's Guide, a custom-developed Teacher's Guide, and the resource book World History Simulations by Max W.

50|$|The German Expressionist {{movement}} was initially confined to Germany {{due to the}} isolation the country experienced during World War I. In 1916, the government had banned foreign films.
