5|$|After pacifying central Vietnam, Duyệt was reappointed {{to be the}} viceroy of {{southern}} Vietnam and Cambodia in 1820 by Emperor Minh Mạng, Gia Long's successor. The emperor further enhanced Duyệt's powers by allowing him the power to oversee all foreign trade coming into his area, and collect taxes in Cambodia and on imports and exports at his discretion. This gave Duyệt control over the vast economic resources in the fertile agricultural and lumber-rich region and most importantly, land development. The southern area had only been populated <b>by</b> <b>ethnic</b> Vietnamese in recent centuries and immigration, clearing and development of land was rapid.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} the Soviet Union, two {{problems}} arose for the project. The first was geopolitical in nature: the main spacecraft control center was located at the Yevpatoria facility in the Crimea region. This control center was significant in the Soviet space program, being one of only two in the country equipped with a 70m dish antenna. With the breakup of the Union, the Crimea region, although mostly populated <b>by</b> <b>ethnic</b> Russians, found itself part of the newly independent Ukraine and the center was put under Ukrainian national control, prompting new political hurdles.|$|E

After more than two months of fighting, the Croatian forces in the city surrendered on 18 November. Vukovar suffered great destruction from JNA artillery and rocket barrages against the town.

5|$|At {{the start}} of the war in Slovenia, the army still saw itself as the defender of a federal, {{communist}} Yugoslavia, rather than an instrument of Serbian nationalism. Its head, General Veljko Kadijević, the Yugoslav Minister of Defence and a committed communist, initially sought to forcibly keep Yugoslavia together and proclaimed the army's neutrality in the Serb-Croat conflict. The JNA leadership aimed to cut Croatia in two by seizing the Serb-inhabited inland regions, almost all of the Dalmatian coast and much of central and eastern Croatia. It aimed to force Croatia's political leadership to capitulate and renegotiate its membership of Yugoslavia. The JNA's leadership was not yet dominated <b>by</b> <b>ethnic</b> Serbs, and these early goals reflected the Yugoslav outlook of its multiethnic leadership. Kadijević was half-Croat and half-Serb, his deputy was a Slovene, the commander of JNA forces in the first phase of the battle was a Macedonian, and the head of the Yugoslav Air Force, which repeatedly bombed Vukovar during the battle, was a Croat.|$|E
