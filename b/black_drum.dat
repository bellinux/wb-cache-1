5|$|Carancahua Bay is {{protected}} by the State of Texas and locally by the 300-member Carancahua Bay Protection Association. It is a nursery bay for shrimp, and is a habitat for shellfish including oysters. Finfish such as the redfish and <b>black</b> <b>drum</b> are commonly caught from the bay by recreational fishermen. Birds common to the bay include the wood ibis, roseate spoonbill, snowy egret, great-tailed grackle, Louisiana heron, willet, black-necked stilt, caracara and the black vulture.|$|E

5|$|Laguna Madre {{is home to}} more finfish than {{anywhere}} else on the Texas coast, with such species as blue catfish, hardhead catfish, Atlantic croaker, <b>black</b> <b>drum,</b> red drum, southern flounder, alligator gar, houndfish, crevalle jack, southern kingfish, ladyfish, Atlantic midshipman, mojarras, striped mullet, pinfish, Florida pompano, smooth butterfly ray, spotted seatrout, blacktip shark, sheepshead, bigmouth sleeper, gray snapper, common snook, southern stargazer, southern stingray and tripletail. Many fowl migrate and live around the lagoon including 75% of all redhead ducks. Other birds in the area include the peregrine falcon, piping plover, roseate spoonbill, long-billed curlew, crane, egret and the brown pelican. Sea turtles and dolphins {{can be found in}} the bay, while cattle, white-tailed deer, nilgai and bobcats can sometimes be seen near the shore.|$|E
5|$|The Nueces estuary {{provides}} an ecosystem {{for a wide}} variety of wildlife. However, since the construction of Choke Canyon Reservoir in 1985, freshwater inflows have decreased from the Nueces River, increasing the bay's salinity, and hurting the natural oyster and shrimp habitat. In response, the City of Corpus Christi, Texas Parks and Wildlife Department and two additional state agencies have worked to restore the natural freshwater inflows into the bay. The Odem Bay extension is low in salinity and serves as a nursery for shrimp, which migrate to Nueces Bay in spring. Oyster beds are common throughout the bay and are known to be hiding spots for such fish as trout, <b>black</b> <b>drum,</b> flounder and redfish. Such finfish must be protected from excessive freshwater introduction for survival.|$|E
25|$|Crassostrea and Saccostrea live {{mainly in}} the {{intertidal}} zone, while Ostrea is subtidal. The hard surfaces of oyster shells and the nooks between the shells provide places where a host of small animals can live. Hundreds of animals, such as sea anemones, barnacles, and hooked mussels, inhabit oyster reefs. Many of these animals are prey to larger animals, including fish, such as striped bass, <b>black</b> <b>drum</b> and croakers.|$|E

Abundant {{collections}} of <b>black</b> <b>drum,</b> flounder and trout, can also be found in the bay. Oysters grow in large numbers to form elongated reefs [...] "oriented perpendicular to tidal flow" [...] in the estuary. The reefs provide habitat for fish and sustenance {{for a wide variety of}} birds including the black-bellied whistling-duck, black-necked stilt, brown pelican, gull-billed tern, reddish egret, roseate spoonbill, seaside sparrow, white-faced ibis and the whooping crane. The dominant species of gastropod in the bay is Eulimastoma harbisonae.|$|E

50|$|<b>Black</b> <b>drum</b> larvae eat mostly zooplankton, {{and young}} <b>black</b> <b>drum</b> (less than 20 cm long) eat worms and small fish. <b>Black</b> <b>drum</b> are mostly bottom feeders, with adults eating mostly mollusks and crabs. In shallow water, {{they have been}} {{reported}} to feed with their heads down so that their tails show above the water surface. Their sensitive chin barbels help locate food, and strong pharyngeal teeth crush the shells of these preferred foods. It has been reported that, in captivity, large drum were able to eat more than two commercial-sized oysters per kilogram of body weight each day. This translates into the potential for a 20 kg drum (about 45 lb) to eat 40 oysters a day. Fishing advice for <b>black</b> <b>drum</b> along the east and southeast coasts of the United States often includes the suggestion to locate an oyster bed. However, this preference has also caused <b>black</b> <b>drum</b> to be a nuisance for those who raise oysters commercially. A group of <b>black</b> <b>drum</b> can do great damage to an oyster bed in a single day.|$|E
