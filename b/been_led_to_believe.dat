5|$|The Sultan of Oman ordered six Mercedes 450 limousines in 1977, {{but quickly}} {{discovered}} {{that they were not}} as safe as he had <b>been</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe.</b> His ex-SAS bodyguards tested one of the cars in the desert in July 1977, by firing at it, but a bullet hit an emergency air cylinder, which led to the petrol tank blowing up, burning the whole car. The remaining cars were immediately sent back, with a demand to refund the money spent.|$|E
25|$|Leaving Wilson in the UK, {{the rest}} of the group {{returned}} to Australia. On their return they found out that there was far less work on offer than they had <b>been</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe,</b> but they took what was available and continued gigging to pay back the airfares. Reno Tahei (ex-Sounds Unlimited, Compulsion, Castaways, Luke's Walnut, Genesis) filled in on drums for a few months until Wilson returned. Tahei was arrested and was deported back to New Zealand.|$|E
25|$|By the {{beginning}} of May 1944, Kastner and many other Jewish leaders had received the Vrba-Wetzler report and other evidence that Hungary's Jews {{would be sent to}} their deaths. The report was released to the leaders of Jewish organizations in the hope that Hungarian Jews would be warned that they were being deported to a death camp and were not being resettled, as they had <b>been</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe.</b> However, the report was not made public by the Jewish Council in Hungary or by Kastner.|$|E

25|$|In February 1971 the {{principal}} circulated {{a memo to}} all employees outlining a new dress code, apparently motivated by the administration's belief that {{public support for the}} district's bond issues was in part motivated by the teachers' appearance. Doyle, as an association official, had been aware that the administration was considering such a measure but had <b>been</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that the association would have had some input before it was announced. He thus shared the memo with a friend at Cincinnati radio station WSAI, which used it as the basis for an on-air news item.|$|E
25|$|His {{appointment}} on 3 September 1939 as Chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS) came {{as something}} of a surprise to Ironside; he had <b>been</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> he would be appointed as the Commander-in-Chief of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), and indeed had already despatched his Assistant to Aldershot to begin preparing his headquarters. The reorganisation was politically driven; Hore-Belisha had fallen out heavily with Viscount Gort during 1939, and the outbreak of war provided an excellent pretext for Gort to leave Whitehall. This left the post of CIGS vacant, and after heavy lobbying by Churchill, Ironside was chosen over Sir John Dill, then the General Officer Commanding, Aldershot Command.|$|E
25|$|Worf {{learned that}} the Klingons were {{planning}} to invade Cardassia because of a coup which they had <b>been</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> was engineered by the Dominion. Worf reluctantly informed Sisko, knowing this would jeopardize his status in the empire. After the invasion had begun, Gowron traveled to DS9 to ask Worf {{to join him in}} battle. Gowron believed the Federation was unworthy of Worf's loyalty because they would not fight the Dominion. Worf felt the war was wrong and he could not support it. Gowron punished him by reinstating Worf's discommendation, but this time executing it to the full degree, by stripping him and his family of his honor, lands, and titles, effectively bringing down the House of Mogh.|$|E

25|$|A {{brief period}} of limited {{independence}} for Ireland {{came to an end}} following the Irish Rebellion of 1798, which occurred during the British war with revolutionary France. The British government's fear of an independent Ireland siding against them with the French resulted in the decision to unite the two countries. This was brought about by legislation in the parliaments of both kingdoms and came into effect on 1 January 1801. The Irish had <b>been</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> by the British that their loss of legislative independence would be compensated with Catholic Emancipation, that is, by the removal of civil disabilities placed upon Roman Catholics in both Great Britain and Ireland. However, King George III was bitterly opposed to any such Emancipation and succeeded in defeating his government's attempts to introduce it.|$|E
25|$|Beaumarchais' {{problems}} were eased {{when he was}} appointed to teach Louis XV's four daughters the harp. His role soon grew and he became a musical advisor for the royal family. In 1759, Caron met Joseph Paris Duverney, an older and wealthy entrepreneur. Beaumarchais assisted him in gaining the King's approval for the new military academy he was building, the École Royale Militaire, and in turn Duverney promised to help make him rich. The two became very close friends and collaborated on many business ventures. Assisted by Duverney, Beaumarchais acquired the title of Secretary-Councillor to the King in 1760–61, thereby gaining access to French nobility. This {{was followed by the}} purchase in 1763 of a second title, the office of Lieutenant General of Hunting, a position which oversaw the royal parks. Around this time, he became engaged to Pauline Le Breton, who came from a plantation-owning family from Saint-Domingue, but broke it off when he discovered she was not as wealthy as he had <b>been</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 2001, Campbell's {{contract}} expired. Mindful of the Bosman ruling and what happened with Steve McManaman (Britain's first high-profile Bosman related transfer), Tottenham offered him a contract which would have made him the club's highest-ever paid player, but after months of negotiations and several public assurances he would stay at Spurs, Campbell stated his need to leave the club in order to play UEFA Champions League football, {{with the likes of}} England manager Sven-Göran Eriksson advising him of such a course. Several top continental clubs expressed interest in signing him, but he joined Arsenal— Tottenham's biggest rivals— on a free transfer. Campbell had previously stated in an interview with Spurs Monthly magazine that he would never play for Arsenal. The move was also unusual as no rumours of a move to Arsenal had been leaked or speculated upon in the media before the press conference revealing his decision, and many journalists in attendance had <b>been</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> they were there to witness the unveiling of goalkeeper Richard Wright, which would have been a routine sports news story.|$|E

25|$|Arriving at Cold Bay on 19 March 1945 {{and newly}} {{promoted}} to captain, Maxwell took {{command of the}} naval base there the following day. Under his command were 694 U.S. Navy and United States Coast Guard personnel, 47 United States Marines, and a U.S. Army contingent of 605; his personnel strength soon stabilized at around 1,500 as Army personnel transferred out and naval personnel replaced them. He found that an advance party under his second-in-command, U.S. Coast Guard Lieutenant Commander John J. Hutson, had already established Detachment 3294s Antisubmarine Warfare Department. He also discovered that the naval facilities required more rehabilitation than he had <b>been</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe,</b> so he moved his command into Fort Randall, which had been closed since November 1944, and set about readying its facilities to support Project Hula, including the establishment of housing, classrooms, movie theaters, a radio station, and a softball field, the selection of instructors for courses in radio and radar operation, engineering, gunnery, minesweeping, damage control, and landing craft operation, and the procurement of radios, radars, minesweeping gear, gyrocompasses, engines, movie projectors, and training films and other educational tools.|$|E
500|$|The cricket {{world was}} stunned {{that a single}} American city could turn out a side capable of beating the full {{strength}} of Australia.

500|$|After {{two weeks}} of {{manoeuvre}} and engagements (including The Battle of the Clouds, The Paoli Massacre, and an engagement at Valley Forge where Alexander Hamilton was nearly lost), Howe triumphantly entered the city on 26 September. The reception the British received was not quite what they had expected, however. [...] They had <b>been</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that [...] "Friends thicker than Woods" [...] would greet them upon their arrival; they instead were greeted by women, children, and many deserted houses. Despite Howe's best attempts to minimise the plundering by his army (he authorised the execution of violators of his orders against it), this activity by the army had a significant negative effect on popular support.|$|E

As Esther gains popularity and submits to numerous acts of peer pressure [...] including attacking a girl from her old school [...] her friendship with Sunni starts to deteriorate. [...] At her old school, meanwhile, her classmates have <b>been</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that she was chosen for an elite social experiment, and when she returns she is treated like royalty.|$|E

Walter is an orphan who has <b>been</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> his biological mother was in Henry's apartment, {{where he had been}} found abandoned after birth. To [...] "purify" [...] the apartment, Walter, now in an undead state, is attempting to complete a ritual, which requires twenty-one murders to be committed. Midway through the game, a child manifestation of Walter interrupts the murder of the intended twentieth victim, Eileen Galvin, and she joins Henry trying to find Joseph. At the same time, supernatural occurrences begin to manifest in Henry's apartment. The two eventually find Joseph's ghost, who tells them that their only escape is to kill Walter and reveals that Henry is the intended twenty-first victim.|$|E

Larson, whose interview had been altered to make him seem less happy, filed a formal fraud complaint and withdrew his release. [...] "They had some rather nasty, angry anti-gay people on there who were treated as professionals," [...] he said. [...] "I {{had no problem with}} Harry Morgan or Mike Wallace because they were thorough. But obviously others in the decision-making process were truly upset with homosexuality.

Brewer revealed that Mark's return scenes had to be filmed within a week because McGregor was only in Australia for a brief time. The actress explained that they had to film five weeks worth of episodes in one week, before McGregor flew back to Los Angeles. McGregor told a reporter for The Newcastle Herald that he had a feeling {{he was going to be}} asked back eventually, but it still came as a surprise to him. McGregor [...] added that he could see himself staying for a longer time, but it would have to be right for himself and the show.|$|E
500|$|Khrushchev {{considered}} U.S. Vice President Nixon a hardliner, and {{was delighted}} by his {{defeat in the}} 1960 presidential election. He considered the victor, Massachusetts Senator John F. Kennedy, as a far more likely partner for détente, but was {{taken aback by the}} newly inaugurated U.S. President's tough talk and actions {{in the early days of}} his administration. Khrushchev achieved a propaganda victory in April 1961 with the first manned spaceflight and Kennedy a defeat with the failure of the Bay of Pigs invasion. While Khrushchev had threatened to defend Cuba with Soviet missiles, the premier contented himself with after-the-fact aggressive remarks. The failure in Cuba led to Kennedy's determination to make no concessions at the Vienna summit scheduled for 3 June 1961. Both Kennedy and Khrushchev took a hard line, with Khrushchev demanding a treaty that would recognize the two German states and refusing to yield on the remaining issues obstructing a test-ban treaty. Kennedy on the other hand had <b>been</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that the test-ban treaty could be concluded at the summit, and felt that a deal on Berlin had to await easing of East–West tensions. Kennedy described negotiating with Khrushchev to his brother Robert as [...] "like dealing with Dad. All give and no take." ...|$|E
