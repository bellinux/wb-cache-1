YouTube used to employ Adobe Dynamic Streaming for Flash, but with the switch to HTML5 video now streams video using Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (MPEG-DASH), an adaptive bit-rate HTTP-based streaming solution optimizing the <b>bitrate</b> and quality for the available network.|$|E
5|$|DAB {{technically}} provides low {{audio quality}} in the UK due to 98% of stereo stations using a bit rate level of 128 kbit/s. with the MP2 audio codec, which provides poorer sound quality than FM-quality (assuming good reception on both DAB and FM). In addition, DAB+ stations broadcast in the UK use a <b>bitrate</b> between 24 and 48kbit/s. A bit rate of 256 kbit/s has been judged to provide a high quality stereo broadcast signal. Also, a large and growing number of music stations are only transmitting in mono. Indeed, the bit rates used by the radio stations on other digital platforms, such as cable, terrestrial and satellite are usually higher than on DAB, so the audio quality is also higher. For example, all of the BBC stations use higher bit rates on the digital TV platforms than on DAB apart from the BBC World Service on Freeview. On the other hand, an Ofcom survey, which was undertaken due to many consultation responses citing poor DAB quality, found that 94% of DAB listeners thought DAB was at least as good as FM.|$|E
25|$|A more {{sophisticated}} MP3 encoder can produce variable <b>bitrate</b> audio. MPEG audio may use <b>bitrate</b> switching on a per-frame basis, but only layer III decoders must support it. VBR is used when {{the goal is}} to achieve a fixed level of quality. The final file size of a VBR encoding is less predictable than with constant <b>bitrate.</b> Average <b>bitrate</b> is a type of VBR implemented as a compromise between the two: the <b>bitrate</b> is allowed to vary for more consistent quality, but is controlled to remain near an average value chosen by the user, for predictable file sizes. Although an MP3 decoder must support VBR to be standards compliant, historically some decoders have bugs with VBR decoding, particularly before VBR encoders became widespread. The most evolved LAME MP3 encoder supports the generation of VBR, ABR, and even the ancient CBR MP3 formats.|$|E
50|$|In the {{recently}} released SonicStage version 3.2 and 3.3 some more <b>bitrates</b> have been introduced, the available <b>bitrates</b> are: 48, 64, 96, 128, 160, 192, 256, 320 and 352 kbit/s.

25|$|In digital {{communication}} systems, the physical layer gross <b>bitrate,</b> raw <b>bitrate,</b> data signaling rate, gross {{data transfer rate}} or uncoded transmission rate (sometimes written as a variable Rb or fb) is {{the total number of}} physically transferred bits per second over a communication link, including useful data as well as protocol overhead.|$|E
25|$|Multiplexes {{can make}} use of {{statistical}} multiplexing at the MPEG video coder whereby the <b>bitrate</b> allocated to a channel within the multiplex can vary dynamically depending on {{how difficult it is}} to code the picture content at that precise time, and how much demand there is for bandwidth from other channels. In this way, complex pictures with much detail may demand a higher <b>bitrate</b> at one instant and this can result in the <b>bitrate</b> allocated to another channel in the same multiplex being reduced if the second channel is currently transmitting pictures which are easier to encode, with less fine detail.|$|E

25|$|<b>Bitrate</b> is {{the product}} of the sample rate and number of bits per sample used to encode the music. CD audio is 44100 samples per second. The number of bits per sample also depends on the number of audio channels. CD is stereo and 16 bits per channel. So, {{multiplying}} 44100 by 32 gives 1411200—the <b>bitrate</b> of uncompressed CD digital audio. MP3 was designed to encode this 1411kbit/s data at 320kbit/s or less. As less complex passages are detected by MP3 algorithms then lower bitrates may be employed. When using MPEG-2 instead of MPEG-1, MP3 supports only lower sampling rates (16000, 22050 or 24000 samples per second) and offers choices of <b>bitrate</b> as low as 8kbit/s but no higher than 160kbit/s. By lowering the sampling rate, MPEG-2 layer III removes all frequencies above half the new sampling rate that may have been present in the source audio.|$|E

We propose in this paper a fine-grain scalable audio coder which works on a large range of <b>bitrates</b> (2 kbs to 128 kbs).
