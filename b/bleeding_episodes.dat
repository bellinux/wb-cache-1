5|$|In 2007 the ApHC {{implemented}} {{new drug}} rules allowing Appaloosas to show with the drugs furosemide, {{known by the}} trade name of Lasix, and acetazolamide. Furosemide is used to prevent horses who bleed from the nose when subjected to strenuous work from having <b>bleeding</b> <b>episodes</b> when in competition, and is widely used in horse racing. Acetazolamide ("Acet") is used for treating horses with the genetic disease hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (HYPP), and prevents affected animals from having seizures. Acet is only allowed for horses that test positive for HYPP and have HYPP status noted on their registration papers. The ApHC recommends that Appaloosas that trace to certain American Quarter Horse bloodlines be tested for HYPP, and owners {{have the option to}} choose to place HYPP testing results on registration papers. Foals of AQHA-registered stallions and mares born on or after January 1, 2007 that carry HYPP will be required to be HYPP tested and have their HYPP status designated on their registration papers.|$|E

40|$|Bleeding from esophageal varices {{continues}} to be a major complication of cirrhosis and portal hyperten-sion, with the mortality for a <b>bleeding</b> <b>episode</b> close to 50 % (1). Although the risk for first hemorrhage after discovery of esophageal varices is 25 % to 30 %, the risk for recurrent variceal hemorrhage after control of the initial <b>bleeding</b> <b>episode</b> is close to 70 % (2). Most episodes of recurrent hemorrhage occur within 1 year of the initial episode. Because of the high morbidity associated with variceal bleeding, there is considerable interest in finding a therapy that will both prevent var-iceal bleeding and improve survival.

30|$|Although the {{incidence}} of bleeding in medical ICU patients without haematological malignancies is lower, the exact numbers are not certain, as haematological patients often {{are included in the}} general ICU populations. The prospective multicentre Scandinavian Starch for Severe Sepsis/Septic Shock (6 S) trial [42], which included 798 general ICU patients with severe sepsis, had severe bleeding (defined as clinical bleeding that required 3 or more units of packed red cells within 24  h) as one of the pre-defined outcomes. In 6 S, 19 % of the patients had a <b>bleeding</b> <b>episode</b> and 8 % had severe bleeding [43]. However, 35 % of the patients had surgery prior to ICU admission.

40|$|Chairman Terblanche: Most of the {{discussion}} time will be spent reviewing the long-term management of patients after a variceal bleed. In the last 10 minutes we will attempt to place the role of prophylactic therapy in perspective. In my view there are some end-stage patients who should not be subjected to either emergency or definitive treatment. Unfortunately they are frequently difficult to identify as even apparently poor risk patients may well improve their liver status if they recover from the <b>bleeding</b> <b>episode.</b> There is also {{evidence to suggest that}} the risk of recurrent bleeding and death rapidly diminishes as time passes after a <b>bleeding</b> <b>episode,</b> with this risk returning to baseline within two to three months. I believe that continued non-specific medical management alone is an option that should be considered in some otherwise fit patients who survive a single <b>episode</b> of variceal <b>bleeding.</b> This would allow one to determine whether they fall into the 30 % of so of patients who will not have a further bleed. However, I concede that the majority of patients who have had a variceal bleed do require further therapy to prevent the next variceal bleed...|$|R

50|$|You {{have been}} {{diagnosed}} having a cancer disease. This cancer is in your case treated with chemotherapy. The chemotherapy has caused or can cause severe depression of platelets. You need a normal level of platelets to maintain coagulation and prevent severe <b>bleeding</b> <b>episodes.</b> Neumega is used to increase depressed platelet counts {{to a higher level}} to promote protection against <b>bleeding</b> <b>episodes.</b> The drug is injected once a day subcutaneously e.g., in your hip or thigh. Your clinician will show you the correct technique, so you can complete further courses of Neumega-therapy at home. One course of Neumega usually starts 6 to 24 hours after completion of chemotherapy and is continued for 10 to 21 days at the discretion of the physician. Your doctors will ask you to undergo frequent blood cell counts to determine effects of therapy and the further course of treatment. Please adhere to his/her advices for reasons of your own safety.|$|E
5000|$|Characteristic {{symptoms}} {{vary with}} severity. In general symptoms are {{internal or external}} <b>bleeding</b> <b>episodes,</b> which are called [...] "bleeds".

50|$|The major {{adverse effect}} is {{bleeding}} on local sites of clinical intervention and systemically (regarding {{parts of the}} body or the whole body system). Major bleeding has occurred in 1.4% of patients and minor bleeding in 10.5%. Transfusions were required to terminate bleeding and to improve bleeding-related anemia in 4.0% of all patients.

5000|$|The {{activated}} {{partial thromboplastin time}} (aPTT) is [...]the {{most reliable}} coagulation parameter and should be obtained regularly during treatment, particular if a <b>bleeding</b> <b>episode</b> occurs that may be associated with tirofiban therapy. Other important hematological parameters are platelet count, clotting time, hematocrit and hemoglobin. Proper technique regarding artery site access for sheath placement and removal of sheath should be followed.

40|$|Background: the {{association}} of somatostatin (SMT) with endoscopic therapy in patients with cirrhosis and variceal bleeding significantly improves {{the control of the}} <b>bleeding</b> <b>episode,</b> and hemodynamic data have shown that a dosage of 500 µg/h allows a more marked reduction of portal pressure versus the usual dosage of 250 µg/h. Aim: to assess if the 500 µg/h dosage is associated with an improved outcome. Methods: sixty-two patients with variceal bleeding were included in the study. Patients were randomized to receive the usual dosage of SMT (group I: 250 µg/h), or a double dosage (group II: 500 µg/h), together with emergency endoscopic sclerotherapy. Results: the control of the <b>bleeding</b> <b>episode</b> was similar in both groups of patients. Early rebleeding was less frequent in patients receiving double vs. single dosage of SMT (p = 0. 06). When considering patients with advanced liver disease (Child-Pugh B or C) early rebleeding was significantly less frequent in patients receiving the 500 µg/h dose of SMT (39 vs. 13 %, p = 0. 03). Conclusions: the perfusion of higher doses of SMT (500 µg/h) in association with emergency sclerotherapy in patients with cirrhosis and esophageal hemorrhage significantly decreases the rate of early rebleeding in patients with more advanced stages of liver disease...|$|R
30|$|Results: The mean {{operating}} time ranged from 132  min (LAVH) and 150  min. (TLH) {{at the beginning}} of the learning curve, to 72  min (LAVH) and 68  min (TLH) now. Since we introduced TLH as a routine technique, the rate of LAVH has been continuously decreasing. The overall complication rate was 6.6 % (20 patients). All serious complications, including one major intraperitoneal <b>bleeding</b> <b>episode</b> requiring relaparoscopy, one bowel laceration, one epigastric vessels injury, one bladder injury and one major lymphocoele after pelvic lymphadenectomy happened during or after LAVH. None of them concerned TLH or SLH.|$|R
50|$|Clotting {{factors are}} either given preventively or on-demand. Preventive use {{involves}} {{the infusion of}} clotting factor on a regular schedule {{in order to keep}} clotting levels sufficiently high to prevent spontaneous <b>bleeding</b> <b>episodes.</b> On-demand (or episodic) treatment involves treating <b>bleeding</b> <b>episodes</b> once they arise. In 2007, a trial comparing on-demand treatment of boys (< 30 months) with haemophilia A with prophylactic treatment (infusions of 25 IU/kg body weight of Factor VIII every other day) in respect to its effect on the prevention of joint-diseases. When the boys reached 6 years of age, 93% of those in the prophylaxis group and 55% of those in the episodic-therapy group had a normal index joint-structure on MRI. Prophylactic treatment, however, resulted in average costs of $300,000 per year. The author of an editorial published in the same issue of the NEJM supports the idea that prophylactic treatment not only is more effective than on demand treatment but also suggests that starting after the first serious joint-related haemorrhage may be more cost effective than waiting until the fixed age to begin.|$|E
50|$|Lusher {{started the}} first {{comprehensive}} hemophilia program at the Children's Hospital of Michigan in 1966. The available treatment for hemophilia at the time included transfusion of large volumes of fresh frozen plasma to replenish the missing clotting factors. Cryoprecipitate, and later in 1970, lyophilized factor VIII concentrates became available {{for the treatment of}} hemophilia A. One of the most frustrating complications in the treatment of hemophilia then, was the development of inhibitors to Factor VIII or Factor IX, which neutralized the activity of the factor given for treatment. Prothrombin complex concentrates had been used since the 1970s as a bypassing agent in a few anecdotal cases of hemophilia with inhibitor development, but their efficacy had not been fully established. Lusher was able to demonstrate their efficacy in the treatment of joint bleeding in hemophilia in two multi-center studies in the early 1980s. Lusher later conducted the first studies on the use of recombinant factor VIIa in the treatment of <b>bleeding</b> <b>episodes</b> in patients with hemophilia. As this product was safer than prothrombin complex concentrates, and could be administered at home by the patients themselves, she and colleagues promoted its use in patients with inhibitors to treat <b>bleeding</b> <b>episodes.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} {{treatments}} are transfusions of cryoprecipitate or blood plasma {{to help with}} <b>bleeding</b> <b>episodes</b> or prior to surgery.

40|$|Liver {{cirrhosis}} is the end-stage of {{many different}} chronic liver diseases. Limited data exists on the epidemiology, natural history and complications of liver cirrhosis such as esophageal varices and malignancies in the Nordic countries after the discovery of hepatitis C (HCV). Most hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) develop in patients with liver cirrhosis but data on the occurrence of other malignancies than HCCs in these patients are scarce. Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea are common in patients with advanced liver disease but the importance of portal hypertension for these symptoms is unexplored. The aims {{of the present study}} were to evaluate the incidence, outcome and complications of liver cirrhosis in a Swedish population and in Iceland and the effects of portal hypertension on small bowel motility and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) in patients with liver cirrhosis. The annual incidence of liver cirrhosis in Gothenburg was 15. 3 ± 2. 4 / 100. 000 compared to 3. 3 ± 1. 2 / 100. 000 in Iceland, p< 0. 0001.
