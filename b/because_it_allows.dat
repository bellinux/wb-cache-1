5|$|Classic {{learning}} {{theories and}} the modern dual-coding theory support the introduction of interesting, tangential details to learning content. There is evidence that interesting and engaging information promotes image-based thoughts and is better remembered <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> storage of material in both verbal and nonverbal systems. This suggests that interesting material, even if tangential to the topic, does not detract from learning and can promote recall of vague or uninteresting material.|$|E
5|$|Experiments into behavior, to {{understand}} how organisms detect and {{interact with each other}} and their environment, in which fruit flies, worms, mice, and rats are all widely used. Studies of brain function, such as memory and social behavior, often use rats and birds. For some species, behavioral research is combined with enrichment strategies for animals in captivity <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> them to engage in a wider range of activities.|$|E
5|$|The object element: The eyes also {{test support}} of the HTML object element. The object element {{has been a part}} of HTML since HTML 4 was {{released}} in 1998, yet by 2005 it still was not completely supported in all web browsers. The creators of Acid2 considered object element support important <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> for content fallback—if an object fails to load, then the browser can display alternative (generally simpler, more reliable) content in its place.|$|E
5000|$|Nuns' {{writings}} {{in colonial}} convents were {{a common practice}} in South American subcontinent, not only <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>allowed</b> to reinforce faith or <b>because</b> <b>it</b> was done [...] "for confessional mandate", but also <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>allowed</b> [...] "to express some concerns or dissatisfactions against the lived reality" [...] for including issues related to material and spiritual life that they had within the convent.|$|R

50|$|In medieval architecture, the knotted rope was {{indispensable}} for architects, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>allowed</b> {{the construction of}} equilateral and right-angled triangles, as well as circles.|$|R
5|$|The Irenaean theodicy is a Christian theodicy {{designed}} {{to respond to}} the problem of evil. As such, it defends the probability of an omnipotent and omnibenevolent (all-powerful and perfectly loving) God in the face of evidence of evil in the world. Numerous variations of theodicy have been proposed which all maintain that, while evil exists, God is either not responsible for creating evil, or he is not guilty for creating evil. Typically, the Irenaean theodicy asserts that the world is {{the best of all possible}} worlds <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> humans to fully develop. Most versions of the Irenaean theodicy propose that creation is incomplete, as humans are not yet fully developed, and experiencing evil and suffering is necessary for such development.|$|E
5|$|The non-sliding {{logarithmic}} scale, Gunter's rule, {{was invented}} shortly after Napier's invention. William Oughtred enhanced it {{to create the}} slide rule—a pair of logarithmic scales movable with respect to each other. Numbers are placed on sliding scales at distances proportional to the differences between their logarithms. Sliding the upper scale appropriately amounts to mechanically adding logarithms. For example, adding the distance from 1 to 2 on the lower scale to the distance from 1 to 3 on the upper scale yields a product of 6, which is read off at the lower part. The slide rule was an essential calculating tool for engineers and scientists until the 1970s, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>allows,</b> {{at the expense of}} precision, much faster computation than techniques based on tables.|$|E
5|$|If {{the story}} of the Star of Bethlehem {{described}} an actual event, it might identify the year Jesus was born. The Gospel of Matthew describes the birth of Jesus as taking place when Herod was king. According to Josephus, Herod died after a lunar eclipse and before a Passover Feast. The eclipse is usually identified as the eclipse of March 13, 4 BC. Other scholars suggested dates in 5 BC, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> seven months for the events Josephus documented between the lunar eclipse and the Passover than the 29 days allowed by lunar eclipse in 4 BC. Others suggest it was an eclipse in 1 BC. The narrative implies that Jesus was born sometime between the first appearance of the star and the appearance of the Magi at Herod's court. That the king is said to have ordered the execution of boys two years of age and younger implies that the Star of Bethlehem appeared within the preceding two years. Some scholars date the birth of Jesus as 6–4 BC, while others suggest Jesus' birth was in 3/2 BC.|$|E

50|$|Allowed for Indian participation, albeit limited, in both provincially {{and central}} {{legislative}} councils. Important step <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>allowed</b> Indians, {{to have a}} bigger influence the laws that would be administered to Hindus.|$|R
5|$|In another study, {{students}} who read less-organized material performed better that students given organized material on tasks that required {{an application of}} the knowledge to problem-solving. This suggests that the inclusion of seductive details might be beneficial for transfer performance but detrimental when trainees are recalling information. Interference from seductive details creates confusion of what the core material is and, therefore, the recall {{will not be as}} good and more errors will occur. This distortion can lead to a richer understanding of the material and facilitate transfer performance because trainees are required to form a macro structure of the instructional material. Research using the dual-coding paradigm also suggests that interesting and engaging information promotes image-based thoughts and leads to deeper processing of information <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> storage of material in both verbal and nonverbal systems. When information is made easier to comprehend, material is processed less deeply, thus leading to poorer acquisition of information.|$|E
5|$|In net {{metering}} {{the price of}} the electricity produced {{is the same as the}} price supplied to the consumer, and the consumer is billed on the difference between production and consumption. Net metering can usually be done with no changes to standard electricity meters, which accurately measure power in both directions and automatically report the difference, and <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> homeowners and businesses to generate electricity at a different time from consumption, effectively using the grid as a giant storage battery. With {{net metering}}, deficits are billed each month while surpluses are rolled over to the following month. Best practices call for perpetual roll over of kWh credits. Excess credits upon termination of service are either lost, or paid for at a rate ranging from wholesale to retail rate or above, as can be excess annual credits. In New Jersey, annual excess credits are paid at the wholesale rate, as are left over credits when a customer terminates service.|$|E
5|$|The Internet {{works in}} part because of {{protocols}} that govern how the computers and routers communicate with each other. The nature of computer network communication lends itself to a layered approach where individual protocols in the protocol stack run more-or-less independently of other protocols. This allows lower-level protocols to be customized for the network situation while not changing the way higher-level protocols operate. A practical example of why this is important is <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> an Internet browser to run the same code regardless of whether the computer it is running on is connected to the Internet through an Ethernet or Wi-Fi connection. Protocols are often talked about in terms of their place in the OSI reference model (pictured on the right), which emerged in 1983 as the first step in an unsuccessful attempt to build a universally adopted networking protocol suite.|$|E

25|$|The 1950s saw the Mafia heavily {{penetrate}} {{the construction and}} cement industries. The cement business was appealing to the Mafia <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> high levels of local economic involvement and is a good front for illegitimate operations.|$|E
25|$|The {{language}} of category theory provides a concise definition for Lie groups: a Lie {{group is a}} group object {{in the category of}} smooth manifolds. This is important, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> generalization of the notion of a Lie group to Lie supergroups.|$|E
5000|$|Particularly in the 1920s, the Klan used a {{technique}} {{referred to as}} bloc recruitment. This term was coined by sociologist Anthony Oberschall. Bloc recruitment refers to [...] "the way in which social-movement organizers often recruit members and participants among groups of individuals already organized for some other purpose." [...] This strategy was advantageous to the Klan <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>allowed</b> them to recruit large groups of members from one source instead of being faced with {{the difficult task of}} recruiting individuals one by one. This strategy was also effective <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>allowed</b> the Klan to build upon the solidarity already in place from other organizations.|$|R

50|$|The Realist 45 also {{features}} the then-standard, old-style hot shoe (referred to as an accessory clip). This was more versatile {{at the time}} <b>it</b> was released <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>it</b> to use most contemporary flash accessories, {{and in recent years}} it has made it much easier to find an adapter for modern electronic flash units than it was for the Kodak.|$|R
25|$|In general, type-safety and memory-safety {{go hand in}} hand. For example, a {{language}} that supports pointer arithmetic and number-to-pointer conversions (like C) is neither memory-safe nor type-safe, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> arbitrary memory to be accessed {{as if it were}} valid memory of any type.|$|E
25|$|This rule is {{occasionally}} {{referred to}} as a legal technicality <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> defendants a defense that does not address whether the crime was actually committed. In this respect, it is similar to the explicit rule in the Fifth Amendment protecting people from double jeopardy.|$|E
25|$|Preference for unequal {{distribution}} {{has been}} developed to the human race possibly <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> for better co-operation and allows a person {{to work with a}} more productive person so that both parties benefit from the co-operation. Inequality also solves the problems of free-riders, cheaters and ill-behaving people.|$|E

25|$|In summary, PDiff is {{more general}} than Diff <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> pieces (corners), and one cannot in general smooth corners, while PL {{is no less}} general that PDiff because one can linearize pieces (more precisely, one may need to break them up into smaller pieces and then linearize, which is allowed in PDiff).|$|E
25|$|Varela’s model {{describes}} {{the selection of}} cellular assemblies, {{sometimes referred to as}} resonant or reverberating (Lorente de Nó) circuits, as being integrated into a larger ensemble by transient spike phase locking. This addresses the explanatory difficulty of the simultaneous nature of binding <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> many signals to be in transit in parallel within an overlapping frequency range without interference.|$|E
25|$|MALDI/TOF spectra {{are often}} {{utilized}} {{in tandem with}} other analysis and spectroscopy techniques in the diagnosis of diseases.
