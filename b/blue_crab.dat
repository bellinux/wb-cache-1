5|$|Dyspanopeus sayi is {{a species}} of mud crab that is native to the Atlantic coast of North America. It has also become {{established}} outside its native range, living in Swansea Docks since 1960, the Mediterranean Sea since the 1970s, the North Sea since 2007 and the Black Sea since 2010. It can reach a carapace width of , and has black tips to its unequal claws. It feeds on bivalves and barnacles, and is in turn eaten by predators including the Atlantic <b>blue</b> <b>crab,</b> Callinectes sapidus. Eggs are produced from spring to autumn, the offspring reach sexual maturity the following summer, and individuals can live {{for up to two}} years. The closest relative of D.sayi is D.texanus, which lives in the Gulf of Mexico; the two species differ in subtle features of the genitalia and the last pair of walking legs.|$|E
5|$|There is {{evidence}} that the native <b>blue</b> <b>crab</b> in eastern North America, Callinectes sapidus, is able to control populations of C.maenas; numbers of the two species are negatively correlated, and C.maenas is not found in the Chesapeake Bay, where Callinectes sapidus is most frequent. On the west coast of North America, C.maenas appears to be limited to upper estuarine habitats, in part because of predation by native rock crabs (Romaleon antennarium and Cancer productus) and competition for shelter with a native shore crab, Hemigrapsus oregonensis. Host specificity testing has recently been conducted on Sacculina carcini, a parasitic barnacle, as a potential biological control agent of C.maenas. In the laboratory, Sacculina settled on, infected, and killed native California crabs, including the Dungeness crab, Metacarcinus magister (formerly Cancer magister), and the shore crabs Hemigrapsus nudus, Hemigrapsus oregonensis and Pachygrapsus crassipes. Dungeness crabs were the most vulnerable of the tested native species to settlement and infection by the parasite. Although Sacculina did not mature in any of the native crabs, developing reproductive sacs were observed inside a few Metacarcinus magister and Hemigrapsus oregonensis. Any potential benefits of using Sacculina to control C.maenas on the west coast of North America would need to be weighed against these potential non-target impacts.|$|E
5|$|Saint Charles Bay {{serves as}} a habitat for {{approximately}} 300 species of birds. Birders venture to the site between November and March, when the creatures winter near the bay. The endangered whooping crane, the largest bird in North America, is the most highly prized sight as {{only a few hundred}} remain, including three families on St. Charles Bay. The bird was near extinction in the early 20th century, as only two flocks between Canada and Texas remained. The population increased following the organization of the Aransas Migratory Waterfowl Refuge in 1937, after the Federal government purchased the land of the St. Charles ranch from San Antonio oilman Leroy G. Denman, using funds from commemorative stamps. The Refuge later became known as the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge. Whooping cranes are also protected by Goose Island State Park, which was established by the State of Texas in 1931. Other birds that migrate to the bay include the sandhill crane, American white pelican, brown pelican, roseate spoonbill, great blue heron and Canada goose. The <b>blue</b> <b>crab</b> and other shellfish, help sustain the bird population. Thirty seven species of mammals are found on Blackjack peninsula, including white-tailed deer, nine-banded armadillos and collared peccaries. The spotted seatrout and redfish are the common finfish that reside in the bay. While trout are generally found in the bay's deeper waters, redfish live in shallow waters; their tail fins can be spotted above the surface during the peak summer and fall months. The bay also supports a healthy population of American alligators, which reside in shallow waters. Signs alert visitors to be careful.|$|E

25|$|Other {{species of}} Callinectes may be easily {{confused}} with C. sapidus because of overlapping ranges and similar morphology. One species is the lesser <b>blue</b> <b>crab</b> (C. similis). It is found further offshore than the common <b>blue</b> <b>crab,</b> {{and has a}} smoother granulated carapace. Males of the lesser <b>blue</b> <b>crab</b> also have mottled white coloration on the swimming legs, and females have areas of violet coloration on the internal surfaces of the claws. C. sapidus can be distinguished from another related species found within its range, C. ornatus, by number of frontal teeth on the carapace. C.sapidus has four, while C. ornatus has six.|$|E
25|$|<b>Blue</b> <b>crab</b> populations {{naturally}} fluctuate {{with annual}} changes in environmental conditions. They {{have been described}} as having a long-term dynamic equilibrium, which was first noted after irregular landings data in the Chesapeake in 1950. This tendency may have made it difficult for managers to predict the severe decline of the Chesapeake’s <b>blue</b> <b>crab</b> populations. Once considered an overwhelmingly abundant annoyance, the declining <b>blue</b> <b>crab</b> population is now the subject of anxiety among fishermen and managers. Over the decade between the mid-1990s to 2004, the population fell from 900 million to around 300 million, and harvest weight fell from 52,000 tons (115,000,000 lbs) to 28,000 tons (62,000,000 lbs). Revenue fell further, from $72 million to $61 million. Long term estimates say that the overall Chesapeake population decreased approximately 70% in the last few decades. Even more alarming, the number of females capable of reproducing, known as spawning age females, has plummeted 84% in just a few decades. Survival and addition of juveniles to the harvestable crab population is also low. Many factors are to blame for low <b>blue</b> <b>crab</b> numbers, including high fishing pressure, environmental degradation, and disease prevalence.|$|E
25|$|As {{early as}} the 1600s, the <b>blue</b> <b>crab</b> was an {{important}} food item for Native Americans and European settlers in the Chesapeake Bay area.

25|$|The Chesapeake Bay has had {{the largest}} <b>blue</b> <b>crab</b> harvest {{for more than a}} century. Maryland and Virginia are usually the top two Atlantic coast states in annual landings, {{followed}} by North Carolina. In 2013, crab landings were valued at $18.7 million from Maryland waters and $16.1 million from Virginia waters. Although crab populations are currently declining, <b>blue</b> <b>crab</b> fishing in Maryland and Virginia remains a livelihood for thousands of coastal residents. As of 2001, Maryland and Virginia collectively had 4,816 commercial crab license holders. Three separate licenses are required {{for each of the three}} major jurisdictional areas: Maryland, the Potomac River, and Virginia waters. While the Bay’s commercial sector lands the majority of hard crab landings and nearly all peeler or soft crab landings, the recreational fishery is also significant. In 2013, an estimated 3.9 million pounds of <b>blue</b> <b>crab</b> were harvested recreationally.|$|E
25|$|Species {{other than}} <b>blue</b> <b>crab</b> are often caught {{incidentally}} in crab pots, including fish, turtles, conch, and other crab species. In Georgia, hermit crabs (Pagurus spp.), channeled whelk (Busycon canaliculatum), spider crabs (Libinia spp.), and stone crabs (Menippe mercenaria) {{were the most}} common species observed as bycatch in commercial crab pots. Of important concern is the diamondback terrapin, Malaclemys terrapin. The <b>blue</b> <b>crab</b> and diamondback terrapin have overlapping ranges along the East and Gulf coasts of the United States. Because the funnels in a crab pot are flexible, small terrapins may easily enter and become entrapped. Traps are checked every 24 hours or less, frequently resulting in drowning and death of terrapins. Crab pot bycatch may reduce local terrapin populations to less than half. To reduce terrapin entrapment, bycatch reduction devices (BRDs) may be installed {{on each of the}} funnels in a crab pot. BRDs effectively reduce bycatch (and subsequently mortality) of small terrapins without affecting <b>blue</b> <b>crab</b> catch.|$|E

25|$|The {{early history}} of the {{recreational}} <b>blue</b> <b>crab</b> fishery in the Gulf of Mexico is not well known. Commercial crabbing was first reported in the Gulf of Mexico in the 1880s. Early crab fishermen used long-handled dip nets and drop nets among other simple fishing gear types to trap crabs at night. <b>Blue</b> <b>crab</b> spoiled quickly, which limited distribution and hindered {{the growth of the}} fishery for several decades. The first commercial processing plant in Louisiana opened in Morgan City in 1924. Other plants opened soon after, although commercial processing of hard blue crabs was not widespread until World War II.|$|E
25|$|The early <b>blue</b> <b>crab</b> fishery {{along the}} Atlantic coast was casual and {{productive}} because blue crabs were extremely abundant. In the lower Chesapeake Bay, crabs were even considered a nuisance species because they frequently clogged the nets of seine fishermen. Early on, the <b>blue</b> <b>crab</b> fishery of the Atlantic states was well documented. Atlantic states {{were the first}} to regulate the fishery, particularly the Chesapeake states. For example, after observing a slight decline in harvest, the fishing commissions of Virginia and Maryland put size limits into place by 1912 and 1917 respectively. Catch-per-unit-effort at the time was determined by packing houses, or crab processing plants.|$|E
