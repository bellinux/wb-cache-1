5|$|The {{turning point}} of the match came with ten minutes left. After a period of fluent {{football}} by the Arsenal forwards which saw Smith hit the woodwork and Hayes, Thomas and Rocastle all had shots saved by Dibble, Arsenal were awarded a penalty after Rocastle was fouled in the box. Dibble saved Winterburn's spot-kick by turning the ball round the post. A newly inspired Luton equalised with seven minutes remaining when Caesar mis-kicked a clearance {{on the edge of}} his penalty area, enabling Luton's Wilson to head the ball into the Arsenal goal from a Mark Stein cross. With less than a minute to go, Adams fouled Mark Stein, and from the resulting free kick, Brian Stein scored his second goal of the match to put the game <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> <b>reach</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> defending champions.|$|E

The fiasco of the descent on Saint Cast helped convince British Prime Minister Pitt to send military aid and troops to fight with Ferdinand and Frederick the Great on the continent of Europe. The potential for another disaster and overall expense of expeditions this size was considered to outweigh the temporary gain of the raids.|$|E

The hero lives a kind of folly that nonetheless remains optimistic. Mediation is internal when the mediator is at the same level as the subject. The mediator then transforms into a rival and an obstacle to the acquisition of the object, whose value increases as the rivalry grows. This is the universe of the novels of Stendhal, Flaubert, Proust and Dostoevsky, which are particularly studied in this book.|$|E
25|$|Corruption, in {{this context}} the {{diversion}} of public finance from {{the needs of the}} army, may have contributed greatly to the Fall. The rich senatorial aristocrats in Rome itself became increasingly influential during the fifth century; they supported armed strength in theory, but did not wish to pay for it or to offer their own workers as army recruits. They did, however, pass large amounts of money to the Christian Church. At a local level, from the early fourth century, the town councils lost their property and their power, which often became concentrated {{in the hands of a}} few local despots <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> <b>reach</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> law.|$|E

If these offenses are committed, then the blood of Christ will not cleanse them from their sins even though they repent. Therefore their only hope is to have their own blood shed to atone, as far as possible, in their behalf.|$|E
25|$|Ridgway's forces {{achieved}} the adjusted line {{by the end}} of March, encountering no more than the sporadic delaying action that had characterized the opposition to Operation Ripper from the outset. Thus, since March 7 Eighth Army forces had made impressive territorial gains, recapturing the South Korean capital and moving between twenty-five and thirty miles (40–50km) north to reach the 38th parallel. Estimates of Chinese killed and wounded during the month were high, and some 4,800 Chinese and North Koreans had been captured. Nevertheless, the results in terms of troops and supplies destroyed were considerably less than anticipated. The clear fact was that the communist high command had been and still was marshaling its main forces <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> <b>reach</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Operation Ripper. Equally obvious was that only advances above the 38th parallel north could attack these main forces.|$|E
25|$|The Supreme Court {{took the}} case and heard oral {{argument}} almost a year later. It handed down its decision early in 1977. On the jurisdictional question, Rehnquist held that although the school district had been created by state law, it was primarily a local entity and thus <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> <b>reach</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Eleventh Amendment, its first ruling in that area in 86 years. The Court did not, however, decide {{the question of whether}} Doyle had been fired legally, since there were other incidents suggesting he had difficulties in his relationships with students and fellow teachers which the district had introduced into the record. Instead, it remanded the case to the district court, ordering it to require the district to show by a preponderance of evidence that Doyle would have been fired regardless if he had not contacted the radio station. The school district was later able to do so, and in 1982 the Sixth Circuit upheld that decision.|$|E
