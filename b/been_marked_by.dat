5|$|Achievements in gliding have <b>been</b> <b>marked</b> <b>by</b> the {{awarding}} of badges since the 1920s. For the lower badges, such as the first solo flight, national gliding federations set their own criteria. Typically, a bronze badge shows preparation for cross-country flight, including precise landings and witnessed soaring flights. Higher badges follow the standards set down by the Gliding Commission of the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI).|$|E

He is also the third longest-reigning Intercontinental Champion in WWE history by combined days, behind only Don Muraco and Pedro Morales.|$|E
5|$|A {{promotion}} came in c. 46, when Alexander {{was appointed}} procurator of Judea by Claudius. The province {{had returned to}} direct Roman rule only {{after the death of}} Agrippa in 44, and the tenure of Alexander's predecessor Cuspius Fadus had <b>been</b> <b>marked</b> <b>by</b> unrest, so Alexander's Jewish background may have marked him as a more acceptable governor. Less trouble is attested during his office, although he did condemn James and Simon, sons of an earlier rebel named Judas of Galilee, to crucifixion. It was also at this time that Judea was afflicted by a severe famine. In 48 he was succeeded by Ventidius Cumanus.|$|E

5|$|Anniversaries of Linnaeus' birth, {{especially}} in centennial years, have <b>been</b> <b>marked</b> <b>by</b> major celebrations. Linnaeus {{has appeared on}} numerous Swedish postage stamps and banknotes. There are numerous statues of Linnaeus in countries around the world. The Linnean Society of London has awarded the Linnean Medal for excellence in botany or zoology since 1888. Following approval by the Riksdag of Sweden, Växjö University and Kalmar College merged on 1 January 2010 to become Linnaeus University. Other things named after Linnaeus include the twinflower genus Linnaea, the crater Linné on the Earth's moon, a street in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and the cobalt sulfide mineral Linnaeite.|$|E
5|$|The Ashford Green Corridor is {{a linear}} park {{alongside}} {{the two main}} rivers through the town, which is protected from development by lying on the main flood plain. Most of the area covered by the park has <b>been</b> <b>marked</b> <b>by</b> Ashford Borough Council as a nature reserve. This area includes Victoria Park, which lies to the immediate south of the town centre and the railway. It includes an ornate fountain first shown at the 2nd International Exhibition in London in 1862, and presented to the park by George Harper on 24 July 1912. The Coningbrook Lakes Country Park opened on a former quarry site to the northeast of town in 2015.|$|E
5|$|The Crab Bowl Classic, {{also known}} as the Crab Bowl or the Maryland–Navy rivalry, is an American college {{football}} rivalry between the Maryland Terrapins football team of the University of Maryland and the Navy Midshipmen football team of the United States Naval Academy.

5|$|The Rolling Stones have assimilated various musical genres {{into their}} own {{collective}} sound. Throughout the band's career, their musical contributions have <b>been</b> <b>marked</b> <b>by</b> a continual reference and reliance on musical styles including blues, psychedelia, R, country, folk, reggae, dance, and world music, exemplified by Jones' collaboration with the Master Musicians of Jajouka, as well as traditional English styles that use stringed instrumentation like harps. Brian Jones experimented {{with the use of}} non-traditional instruments such as the sitar and slide guitar in their early days. The group started out covering early rock 'n' roll and blues songs, and have never stopped playing live or recording cover songs.|$|E
5|$|The period since Madsen's {{monograph}} has <b>been</b> <b>marked</b> <b>by</b> a great {{expansion in}} studies dealing with topics concerning Allosaurus in life (paleobiological and paleoecological topics). Such studies have covered topics including skeletal variation, growth, skull construction, hunting methods, the brain, {{and the possibility}} of gregarious living and parental care. Reanalysis of old material (particularly of large 'allosaur' specimens), new discoveries in Portugal, and several very complete new specimens have also contributed to the growing knowledge base.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1917, the British and French were still searching {{for a way to}} achieve a strategic breakthrough on the Western Front. The previous year had <b>been</b> <b>marked</b> <b>by</b> the costly success of the Anglo-French offensive astride the river Somme, while the French had been unable to take the initiative because of intense German pressure at Verdun until after August 1916. The battles consumed enormous quantities of resources while achieving virtually no strategic gains on the battlefield. The cost to Germany of containing the Anglo-French attacks had been enormous and given that the material preponderance of the Entente and its allies could only be expected to increase in 1917, Hindenburg and Ludendorff decided on a defensive strategy on the Western Front for that year. This impasse reinforced the French and British commanders' belief that to end the stalemate they needed a breakthrough; while this desire may have been the main impetus behind the offensive, the timing and location were influenced by political and tactical considerations.|$|E

On 20 May 2008, he was sentenced to six months' imprisonment for common assault and affray during an incident in Liverpool City Centre. Barton served 77 days of this prison term, being released on 28 July 2008. On 1 July 2008, he was also given a four-month suspended sentence after admitting assault occasioning actual bodily harm on former teammate Ousmane Dabo during a training-ground dispute on 1 May 2007. This incident effectively ended his Manchester City career. Barton has been charged with violent conduct three times by The Football Association: for the assault on Dabo, for punching Morten Gamst Pedersen in the stomach and for attacking three players {{on the final day of}} the 2011–12 season.|$|E
5|$|During {{his time}} in the Yankees' minor-league system, Hughes {{was one of the most}} highly {{anticipated}} prospects in baseball, but his major league career has thus far <b>been</b> <b>marked</b> <b>by</b> inconsistency. He debuted in the major leagues in 2007 as a starting pitcher and quickly demonstrated his potential with a bid for a no-hitter in only his second MLB start. However, injury cut short his outing, as well as significant portions of his 2007 and 2008 seasons. Hughes began 2009 in the minors but later returned to the major leagues, eventually converting to a relief pitcher in June; pitching as a setup man for Mariano Rivera, Hughes excelled in the new role during the regular season. Despite his struggles in the postseason, Hughes won a championship with the Yankees in the 2009 World Series over the Philadelphia Phillies.|$|E
5|$|Since Madagascar gained {{independence}} from France in 1960, the island's political transitions have <b>been</b> <b>marked</b> <b>by</b> numerous popular protests, several disputed elections, an impeachment, two military coups and one assassination. The island's recurrent political crises are often prolonged, with detrimental {{effects on the}} local economy, international relations and Malagasy living standards. The eight-month standoff between incumbent Ratsiraka and challenger Marc Ravalomanana following the 2001 presidential elections cost Madagascar millions of dollars in lost tourism and trade revenue as well as damage to infrastructure, such as bombed bridges and buildings damaged by arson. A series of protests led by Andry Rajoelina against Ravalomanana in early 2009 became violent, with more than 170 people killed. Modern politics in Madagascar are colored by the history of Merina subjugation of coastal communities under their rule in the 19th century. The consequent tension between the highland and coastal populations has periodically flared up into isolated events of violence.|$|E

5|$|After {{ten days}} of balloting in Rome, without any {{candidate}} approaching the requisite two-thirds, the cardinals adjourned until June {{and changed the}} location of the election from Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore to Santa Maria sopra Minerva. After a summer epidemic in the city, and the death of Cholet in August, they dispersed until late September. The non-Roman cardinals went to Rieti (except Caetani, who went to his native Anagni) while the Roman cardinals remained in the city. As balloting continued into the next summer, the disorder in Rome increased dramatically (even by the standards of a sede vacante, during which, based on the biblical example of Barabbas, all prisoners were released). The deaths of newly elected Roman Senators Agapitus Colonna and Ursus Orsini around Easter 1293 further exacerbated the anarchy within the city, which had <b>been</b> <b>marked</b> <b>by</b> the destruction of palaces, the slaying of pilgrims, and the sacking of churches. After the summer of 1293, the cardinals dispersed and agreed to reconvene in Perugia on October 18.|$|E
5|$|Communication with Wallace in the far-off Malay Archipelago was {{impossible}} without months of delay, {{so he was}} not part of this rapid publication. Fortunately, Wallace accepted the arrangement after the fact, happy that he had been included at all, and never expressed public or private bitterness. Darwin's social and scientific status was far greater than Wallace's, and it was unlikely that, without Darwin, Wallace's views on evolution would have been taken seriously. Lyell and Hooker's arrangement relegated Wallace to the position of co-discoverer, and he was not the social equal of Darwin or the other prominent British natural scientists. However, the joint reading of their papers on natural selection associated Wallace with the more famous Darwin. This, combined with Darwin's (as well as Hooker's and Lyell's) advocacy on his behalf, would give Wallace greater access to {{the highest levels of the}} scientific community. The reaction to the reading was muted, with the president of the Linnean Society remarking in May 1859 that the year had not <b>been</b> <b>marked</b> <b>by</b> any striking discoveries; but, with Darwin's publication of On the Origin of Species later in 1859, its significance became apparent. When Wallace returned to the UK, he met Darwin. Although some of Wallace's iconoclastic opinions in the ensuing years would test Darwin's patience, they remained on friendly terms for the rest of Darwin's life.|$|E
