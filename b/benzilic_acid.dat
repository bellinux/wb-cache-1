The in vitro effect on spermatozoa was also tested. A total of 100 multiparous female rabbits were divided into 5 groups, which {{at the moment of}} AI, received 0. 2 mL (5 μg/dose) intramuscular (im) inoculation of Lecirelin (control) or the same Lecirelin dose administered intravaginally (iv) with the seminal dose alone (Lecirelin group) or with benzilic alcohol (Lecirelin BA group), benzoic acid (Lecirelin BAc group) or parabens (Lecirelin PA group) as an excipient. After 7 days, 10 rabbits per group were euthanized to analyze their ovarian status. In the control group, a high LH peak was detected 30 min post AI, while in the iv groups a slight increase in LH occurred after 120 min. The ovulation and fertility rate was similar in control and Lecirelin groups, while the lowest fertility rate was detected in the Lecirelin BA group. In a second experiment, the semen samples collected from male rabbits were diluted in TALP (control) or mixed with the 5 μg of Lecirelin solutions used in the first experiment. The highest percentage of capacitated sperm (68. 3 %) was recorded in the Lecirelin PA. The lowest percentages were observed in the Lecirelin BA and BAc groups. In conclusion, the iv administration of Lecirelin represents an alternative method for simplifying rabbit insemination procedures...|$|R

40|$|The {{reactions}} of 3, 3, 3 -trifluoro- 2, 2 -dihydroxy- 1 -phenyl- 1 -propanone (TDPP) with chicken liver carboxylesterase {{have shown that}} this ketone hydrate {{is not only a}} potent inhibitor of the enzyme, but also a substrate for a number of enzyme-catalyzed reactions. The kinetics of inhibition are consistent with a mechanism in which the bound hydrate is initially dehydrated in a rate-limiting step catalyzed by the enzyme. Nucleophilic attack by the active-site serine on the parent ketone then produces a hemiketal adduct. However, the slow reactivation (by dialysis) of TDPP-inhibited enzyme indicates that the interaction with this inhibitor is more complex. At equilibrium, a dissociation constant of 2. 4 pM was obtained for this interaction. 19 F-NMR studies of the enzyme-TDPP complex show that after pre-equilibration, the major adduct is not the hemiketal adduct. It is proposed that this final adduct is a cross-linked adduct formed between TDPP, the active-site serine and the active-site histidine. 19 F-NMR studies reveal that chicken liver carboxylesterase catalyses the cleavage of TDPP to yield either fluoride ion or trifluoroacetate, and also the <b>benzilic</b> <b>acid</b> rearrangement of TDPP to alpha-trifluoromethylmandelate.
