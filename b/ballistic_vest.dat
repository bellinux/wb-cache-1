5|$|Harris {{contacts}} Flynn, {{telling him}} that anti-venom {{will be ready for}} the passengers when they land. However, Flynn discovers that the cockpit is filled with snakes and Rick is dead. After a brief discussion, Troy, Three Gs' bodyguard, agrees to land the plane based on prior flight experience. After everyone gets prepared, Flynn shoots out two windows with his pistol, causing the plane to depressurize. The snakes are blown out of the cockpit and the lower floor of the plane. Flynn and Troy take the controls of the plane and Troy reveals that his flight experience was from a video game flight simulator. Despite his lack of real-world experience, after Troy makes an emergency landing, the plane makes it to the terminal. The passengers leave the plane and anti-venom is given to those who need it. Just as Flynn and Sean are about to disembark the plane, a final snake jumps out and bites Sean in the chest. Flynn draws his gun and shoots the snake, and paramedics rush to Sean, who is unharmed due to his wearing a <b>ballistic</b> <b>vest.</b> As a token of gratitude, Sean later takes Flynn to Bali and teaches him how to surf.|$|E

25|$|In June 2013, the new dark navy uniform was {{introduced}} to all officers as the new standard. The pants are made from rip-stop fabric, the undergarment made from cotton stretch which can be short sleeved or long sleeved and is to be worn under the <b>ballistic</b> <b>vest.</b> Baseball caps remained, although they are darker in colour than pre 2013. The new dark uniform was designed to look more professional and to hide blood, dirt and sweat. The dark blue uniform was modelled after the Oxfordshire and Northumberland police attires.|$|E
25|$|The first soft <b>ballistic</b> <b>vest,</b> Myunjebaegab, {{was invented}} in Joseon Korea in the 1860s shortly after the French {{campaign}} against Korea (1866). Heungseon Daewongun ordered development of bullet-proof armor because of increasing threats from Western armies. Kim Gi-du and Gang Yun found that cotton could protect against bullets if thick enough, and devised bullet-proof vests made of 30 layers of cotton. The vests were used in battle during the United States expedition to Korea (1871), when the US Navy attacked Ganghwa Island in 1871. The US Army captured one of the vests {{and took it to}} the US, where it was stored at the Smithsonian Museum until 2007. The vest has since been sent back to Korea and is currently on display to the public.|$|E
500|$|Before the {{officers}} {{arrived at the}} front of the car, Dexter Bostic, 34, opened fire from the passenger's seat with a [...]45 caliber handgun, striking Timoshenko once in the face and once in the throat. Yan had been approaching on the driver's side, while Timoshenko was coming up from the passenger's side. From the back seat of the BMW, Robert Ellis, 34, shot Yan with a 9mm handgun, striking him in the arm and chest; Yan was saved by his <b>ballistic</b> <b>vest</b> and was able to return fire. A third suspect, 29-year-old Lee Woods, was driving the BMW at the time of the shooting. After firing at least seven rounds at {{the officers}}, the three suspects fled the scene.

40|$|Recent {{research}} on <b>ballistic</b> <b>vests</b> {{has focused on}} comfort performance by enhancing thermal comfort and moisture management. Kevlar/wool fabric has been developed as a potential material for <b>ballistic</b> <b>vests.</b> This study investigates the thermal comfort properties of woven Kevlar/wool and woven Kevlar ballistic fabrics. In this context, the thermal resistance, water-vapor resistance, moisture management performance, air permeability and optical porosity of 100 % Kevlar and Kevlar/wool ballistic fabrics were compared. The effects of fabric physical properties on laboratory-measured thermal comfort were analyzed. This study also presents the fabric bursting strength and tear strength for comparison. Experimental results showed a clear difference in thermal comfort properties of the two fabrics. It was found that Kevlar/ wool possesses better moisture management properties and improved mechanical properties than Kevlar fabric. Keyword...|$|R
