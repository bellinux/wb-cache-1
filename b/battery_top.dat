40|$|Coke oven {{battery is}} complex and {{multifaceted}} facility in terms of air pollutant emissions. As far as stack or quenching tower does not cause major difficulties of emission measurement, the fugitive emission measurement from sources such as <b>battery</b> <b>top</b> elements (charging holes, ascension pipes) or oven doors is still complicated and not fully solved problem. This article presents the discussion concerning main problems and errors likely {{to be made in}} particular stages of procedure of fugitive emissions characterization from coke oven battery (selection of sampling points, sampling itself, measurement of air velocity over <b>battery</b> <b>top</b> and laboratory analyses). In addition, results of concentrations measurements of selected substances characteristic for the coking process (naphthalene, anthracene, 4 PAHs and TSP) originating from fugitive sources of coke oven battery and subjected to reporting under the E-PRTR are presented. The measurements were carried out on coke oven <b>battery</b> <b>top</b> in points {{selected on the basis of}} the preceding detailed air convection velocity measurements over <b>battery</b> <b>top.</b> Results of the velocity measurements were compared with results of numerical modelling using CFD software.

Real time performance evaluation was conducted to determine the effectiveness of the new battery in retaining the electrolyte. Asymmetric polysulfone membrane that functions as an electrolyte retainer was introduced and attached to the battery using a special designed <b>battery</b> <b>top</b> cover assembly. The in-car testing results exhibited that during charging process, electrolyte losses of a membrane-assisted sealed lead acid battery over a period of 1440 hours is approximately 0. 134 grams per hour as compared to 1. 790 grams per hour for conventional lead acid battery...|$|E
