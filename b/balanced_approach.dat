40|$|Cloud {{computing}} is {{a combination}} of parallel and distributed system which aims at effective resource utilization, providing uninterrupted services all the time which adapts itself with varying number of users without much capital investment. Ubiquitous, scalability and elasticity are some of the important features of cloud computing. To maintain essential characteristics, there is a need of mechanism which distributes the load efficiently among the available resources. Load balancing means the distribution of tasks among different available resources so that no one is over or under-utilized. Scalable, adaptable, efficient and reliable are some of the desirable features of a load <b>balancing</b> <b>approach.</b> In this paper, authors have proposed a new load <b>balancing</b> <b>approach</b> named “Weighted Biased Random Walk” for the cloud environment using the concept of biased random walk. Weighted biased random walk approach has been analytically & experimentally analyzed. It has been compared with other load <b>balancing</b> <b>approaches</b> based on biased random walk found in literature. It has been found that weighted biased random walk approach is self-adjustable, distributed, dynamic, scalable and efficient in nature.

Cloud support for the utility model, so user has to pay only for the use resources. Since it provide resource to the users and demand for the resources increasing very fast in the past few decades. So load balancing is the main requirement of the cloud system. But load balancing in cloud is more difficult as compare to other technology because it is so large and user requirement can be change dynamically. It helps in optimizing the resource utilization, hence enhancing the system performance. The prime goal of any load <b>balancing</b> <b>approach</b> is to maximize the resource utilization and reducing the number of active server which will further reduce energy consumption and carbon emission. During the past decades several load <b>balancing</b> <b>approach</b> have been proposed. Main objective of these approaches is to increase the system performance by reducing the number of migration. But these approaches are not focusing on the resource wastage. This paper proposed a load <b>balance</b> <b>approach</b> that reduce the number of migration and increase the resource utilization.

Therefore, a <b>balancing</b> <b>approach</b> is essentially required. This paper proposes an active online cell <b>balancing</b> <b>approach</b> in a fast charging process using the state of charge (SOC) as balancing criterion. The goal {{of this approach is}} to complete pack balancing within the limited charging time. An adaptive extended Kalman filter (AEKF) is applied to estimate the pack cell SOC during the charging process to obtain accurate results under modeling errors and measurement noises. To implement the proposed AEKF, only one additional current sensor is required to obtain the current of each cell required for the SOC estimation. An experimental platform is established to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The results show that the proposed <b>balancing</b> <b>approach</b> with the SOC as a balancing criterion can overcome the challenges of non-uniformity and flat voltage plateau and charge more capacity into a LiFePO 4 battery pack than those with the terminal voltage as a balancing criterion in the fast charging process...|$|R
