25|$|The {{plant species}} {{has a history}} of taxonomic {{uncertainty}} dating back to Carl Linnaeus, who— on the basis of morphological characteristics of the inflorescence and seeds— had placed the species into the genus Actaea. This designation was later revised by Thomas Nuttall reclassifying the species to the genus Cimicifuga. Nuttall's classification was based solely on the dry follicles produced by black cohosh, which are typical of species in Cimicifuga. However, recent data from morphological and gene phylogeny analyses demonstrate that black cohosh is more closely related to species of the genus Actaea than to other Cimicifuga species. This has prompted the revision to Actaea racemosa as originally proposed by Linnaeus. Blue cohosh (Caulophyllum thalictroides), despite its similar common name belongs to another family, the <b>Berberidaceae,</b> and is therefore not closely related to black cohosh.|$|E
500|$|At the Botanic Garden he {{developed}} {{a special interest in}} Vinca, Epimedium, Hosta and Symphytum, all of which he published monographs on. A series of botanical publications followed, starting with a new species of Allium (A. farreri Stearn, 1930). Stearn repeatedly returned to the genus Allium, and was considered a world expert on it; many species bear his name. 1930 would also see his first bibliographic work, on the botanist Reginald Farrer, whom he named Allium farreri after, and also described Rosa farreri (1933) and other species named after Farrer. It was while he was compiling Farrer's works in 1930 that he came across the latter's work, The English Rock-Garden (1919) and its account of Barren-worts (Epimedium), and kindled a lifetime interest in the genus. From 1932, he produced a series of papers on this genus, studying it at Cambridge, Kew and Paris. It became one of the genera which he was best known, and many species of which now bear his name. Epimedium and the related woodland perennial Vancouveria (<b>Berberidaceae)</b> would be the subject of his first monograph (1938) [...] and were genera to which he would return {{at the end of his}} life. At the time the taxonomy of this genus was very confused, and with the help of the Cambridge Herbarium he obtained specimens from all over Europe to produce a comprehensive monograph. The work was so thorough that it was mistakenly considered a doctoral thesis by other botanists. He also began a series of contributions to the catalogue of the Herbarium, together with Gilmour and Tutin.|$|E

2500|$|Brown then {{discusses}} {{each family}} {{represented in the}} collection, in the process splitting up Bernard de Jussieu's Terebinthaceae, and publishing {{for the first time}} Connaraceae, Oxalidaceae, Chailletiaceae (now included in Dichapetalaceae), Chrysobalanaceae, Homaliaceae (now included in Salicaceae), Hydrophyllaceae (now Hydrophylloideae) and Phytolaccaceae. Melastomataceae is given an accurate circumscription, as is <b>Berberidaceae,</b> despite this family not occurring in central Africa. Brown also names and roughly identifies Loganiaceae, though formal publication would have to wait for Carl Friedrich Philipp von Martius in 1827. Of these remarks on the systematics of various families, David Mabberley has claimed [...] "the observations are of immense value to botanists and of almost breathtaking insight." ...|$|E
