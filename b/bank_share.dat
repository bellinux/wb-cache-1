Many of the new companies were conversions of failing private concerns. When the boom ended a hundred companies had been created. An average worker could earn about £1.75 a week (35 shillings). A share could be bought for £5.00. Workers would buy shares in their own company and maybe another mill to balance the risk.

40|$|We embed {{the notion}} of banks as {{monitors}} into a “two trees ” framework, and con-sider how resources are optimally allocated between an intermediated banking sector and a risky sector, given that capital moves sluggishly between the two. We characterize equilibrium {{as a function of}} the relative size of the banking sector — the <b>bank</b> <b>share</b> — and the speed at which capital can move in and out of that sector — the financial flexibility. There are three main implications of the model. First, the <b>bank</b> <b>share</b> and financial flexibility are both important determinants of asset prices. Price-dividend ra-tios are lower, the higher the financial flexibility and the effect on price-dividend ratios of a shock depends on whether the shock arises in the banking sector or in the risky sector. Higher financial flexibility leads to a steeper term structure of interest rates and an inverted term structure is associated with low real growth rates. Second, the relationship between financial flexibility and real growth rates in the economy is am-biguous; high financial flexibility may lead to either higher or lower growth rates. Third, the speed at which capital actually moves into and out of the banking sector is a highly nonlinear function of the <b>bank</b> <b>share.</b> An implication is that the <b>bank</b> <b>share</b> may remain perpetually low after a shock to the banking sector. In such cases, the value of financial flexibility may be extremely high. ∗A previous draft of this paper was entitled The Credit Channel and the Term Structure. We than...|$|E

We characterize how resources are optimally allocated between the intermediated banking sector and a risky sector {{as a function of}} the relative size of the banking sector — the <b>bank</b> <b>share</b> — and the speed at which capital can move in and out of that sector — financial flexibility. The model has three main implications: First, the <b>bank</b> <b>share</b> and financial flexibility affect asset prices; for example, price-dividend ratios are lower the higher the financial flexibility, and shocks to the economy affect the slope of the term structure in a predictable way. Second, the relationship between financial flexibility and real growth rates is ambiguous; high financial flexibility may lead to either higher or lower growth rates. Third, the speed at which capital moves into and out of the banking sector is a highly nonlinear function of the bank share; an implication is that the <b>bank</b> <b>share</b> may remain perpetually low after a shock to the banking sector. Methodologically, our paper contributes to the two-trees literature by allowing for reallocation of resources between trees in a tractable framework; this flexible-tree approach allows for stationary share distributions. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the relationship <b>bank</b> <b>share</b> returns have with interest rate changes. Specifically, {{what is the}} systematic interest rate risk of Australian <b>bank</b> <b>share</b> returns. The reasons why bank shares and interest rates possibly {{have a relationship with}} interest rates are numerous, interrelated and complicated. Shares and interest rates generally have a relationship because of the comparison made between interest bearing securities and dividend paying shares. However, the relationship is compounded with banks, because of their exposure to interest rate risk. This paper involves two separate analyses. The firp. t part involves attempting to measure a <b>bank</b> <b>share</b> 2 ̆ 7 s interest rate sensitivity. This will be achieved using a two index market model, which will give a measure of a banks systematic interest rate risk. The second part attempts to discover the reasons for this relationships existence. This involves a survey of banking analysts. The two index market model was applied to the ANZ Banking Group (ANZ); National Australia Bank (NAB), and; Westpac Banking Corporation (WBC). In addition the Australian Bank Accumulation Index (Bank Index) was used to gain an indication of the general relationship between bank shares and interest rates. The results indicate that the relationship between interest rate changes and a shares return is strongest and inverse for NAB. At various times WBC and the Bank Index showed a significant relationship. However, this was unstable, and varied in both strength and direction over time. At no time was a relationship found for the ANZ. The survey gave reasons for these results. A general relationship was thought to exist mainly because of the comparison made by investors between interest bearing securities and dividend paying shares. The analysts did not believe the operating aspects of banks {{played a major role in}} determining this relationship. With rega 1 d to the differences bank to bank, NAB has a stronger relationship because it is not hampered to the same extent as ANZ and WBC are by poor asset quality. Therefore, interest rate changes are allowed to play a more important role in determining the return on NAB shares. Whereas, for ANZ and WBC, their shares return are affected by other factors which are considered more important than interest rate changes...|$|E
