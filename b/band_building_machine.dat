40|$|In {{this work}} {{processes}} {{and means of}} road and <b>building</b> <b>machines</b> force hydraulic drive tests are investigated. The purpose of this thesis {{is to increase the}} efficiency of experimental investigation and force hydraulic drive tests at the cost of power-saving, experiment optimization and tests acceleration. There has been done theoretical generalization in this work. The methodology of force hydraulic drive power-saving experiment under conditions of road and <b>building</b> <b>machines</b> work has been developed. This system of force hydraulic drive development in stand conditions allowed to reduce the terms of adaptation of road and <b>building</b> <b>machines</b> to the use of force hydraulic drive. There have been received twenty eight author's sertificates on stands, their units etc. Eleven stands and their units have been introduced in the Central Research Experimental Polygon of <b>Building</b> and Road <b>Machines.</b> Design and scientific-technical documentation have been given to four organizations.
