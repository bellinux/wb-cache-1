Following an 8-minute monologue against intolerance, the song was reinvented and performed in a Basque, folk acoustic version, relying only on drums, which were played by the Basque band Kalakan, and Madonna's vocal harmony. Madonna's outfit during the performance consisted of an all-leather look, a custom design by Hervé Léger and Max Azria, with knee-high <b>boots</b> <b>and</b> a mini fur bolero, while her dancers were dressed as soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Myrmecia ants are {{frequently}} encountered by humans, and avoiding them is difficult. Wearing closed footwear such as <b>boots</b> <b>and</b> shoes {{can reduce the}} risk of getting stung; these ants are capable of stinging through fabric, however. A risk of being stung while gardening also exists; most stings occur when someone is gardening and is unaware of the ants' presence. Eliminating nearby nests or moving to areas with low Myrmecia populations significantly decreases the chances of getting stung.|$|E

While Odd is at a restaurant, police come in and arrest the cook. At the shop where he normally buys his pipe tobacco, he learns that the owner has died. He decides to sell his boat, leading to misadventures when the buyer, who works at an airport, asks Odd to meet him there inside the secure zone. Odd goes to the local swimming pool, but his shoes were removed when the facility closed; as he is leaving, he finds a pair of red high-heeled <b>boots</b> <b>and</b> walks away in them.|$|E
40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Grain ScienceBhadriraju SubramanyamMark E. CasadaIn {{commercial}} grain elevators {{and feed}} mills, the <b>boot</b> <b>and</b> pit areas contribute to commingling of insects with grain that {{moves through the}} elevator leg. A pilot-scale bucket elevator leg with a modified removable boot, or slip-boot, {{was used to measure}} the magnitude of commingling as a function of stored-product insect density <b>and</b> <b>boot</b> holding time in tests with wheat and corn. Pilot-scale tests showed that clean grain transferred over infested boots was infested with about 1 insect/kg when transferred immediately after the boot was infested; this increased to 2 insects/kg after incubating the boot for 8 wk. Larger numbers of kernels with internal infestations were picked up by clean grain during transfer compared with externally infesting insects, because the mobility of the latter enabled them to move away from buckets during transfer. Monthly surveys over two years at elevators and feed mills revealed several stored-product insects in grain residues from the <b>boot</b> <b>and</b> pit areas and bulk load-out samples. Insect densities in the <b>boot</b> <b>and</b> pit areas were impacted by seasonal temperatures and facility sanitation practices. Recommended sanitation guidelines for the <b>boot</b> <b>and</b> pit areas include: (1) boot residual grain clean-out every 30 d, (2) removal of grain spillage and floor sweepings from the pit area, and (3) proper disposal of <b>boot</b> <b>and</b> pit residual grain. Facilities following these sanitation guidelines could avoid costly grain discounts, increase income of the business operation and minimize or prevent cross contamination of clean grain by infested grain in the <b>boot</b> <b>and</b> pit areas...|$|R
