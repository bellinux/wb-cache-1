[...] "I told him that I cannot accept a salary for coaching volleyball <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in the Olympics in 1964, {{and at that time}} if you coached a sport for money or played for money you were not considered an amateur and couldn't participate in the Olympics.

[...] "People get put into groups. [...] "You’re a jock, you’re a cheerleader, you’re a freak, you’re in the drama department.

60|$|Fancy your {{imagining that}} you had come into my life in order to darken it. Why, you ARE my life. If you went out of it, what would be left? You talk about my {{happiness}} before I met you--but oh, how empty it all was! I read, and played, and sang as you say, but what a void there was! I did it to please mother, but there really seemed no very clear reason why I should continue to do it. Then you came, and everything was changed. I read because you are fond of reading and because I {{wanted to talk about}} books with you. I played because you are fond of music. I sang in the hope that it might please you. Whatever I did, you were always in my mind. I tried and tried to become a better and nobler woman, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> worthy of the love you bore me. I have changed, and developed, and improved more {{in the last three months}} than in all my life before. And then you come and tell me that you have darkened my life. You know better now. My life has become full and rich, for Love fills my life. It is the keynote of my nature, the foundation, the motive power. It inspires me to make the most of any gift or talent that I have. How could I tell you all this if I did not know that your own feeling was as deep. I could not have given the one, great, and only love of my life in exchange for a half-hearted affection from you. But you will never again make the mistake of supposing that any material consideration can affect our love.|$|E
