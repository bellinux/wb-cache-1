40|$|In {{particular}} the thermal comfort of passengers {{is the essential}} design objective in the cabin air ventilation layout for modern civil passenger aircraft. Solar radiation, electrical equipment, on-board electronics, high power converters, in-flight entertainment and communication devices and most important the heat release of the passengers are representing thermal loads. This heat loads have to be balanced by cold air coming from the air vents of cabin <b>air</b> <b>outlets</b> of the <b>air</b> ventilation system. In fact, the temperature distribution inside the passenger cabin can only be controlled by the air conditioning system. Besides providing the passengers with the fresh, an essential task is to avoid discomfort for the passengers by ensuring a good mixing of fresh with aged air and by guaranteeing a high air flow exchange rate for each individual passenger {{according to the requirements}} defined in. Cabin <b>air</b> <b>outlets</b> are a crucial device for the air flow distribution within the cabin. Although a high air exchange rate is necessary for thermal comfort the incoming fresh air must not exceed a certain flow velocity in order to avoid gust. Therefore, the air should be evenly distributed by an outlet device, i. e. a plenum, an orifice plate or flow straighteners, before it can leave the outlets through the vents forming a homogeneous planar air jet. This optimal precondition facilitates a successive control of the air distribution within the aircraft cabin. In particular, in the early design phase of aircraft cabin layouts numerical flow simulations are undertaken presuming that this precondition is fulfilled. In fact this is not always the case; hence, design work has to be done to improve cabin <b>air</b> <b>outlets.</b> Unfortunately, the space envelope for cabin <b>air</b> <b>outlets</b> is quite limited by stringers, insulation, ducting, wires, cables or lining elements. Not only the outer space envelope is a major constraint when designing <b>air</b> <b>outlets,</b> moreover, internal drag and weight {{have a negative impact on}} the power consumption of the Environmental Control System (ECS) and, therefore, on the fuel consumption of the aircraft. Both have to be minimized in order to save power and costs. Not at all, the optimization of cabin <b>air</b> <b>outlets</b> is a major task in the design process of the air ventilation system, in particular when bearing in mind that future cabin interior will be modularly designed and especially customized in order to meet corporate design constraints of the airliners...|$|R

40|$|The {{fresh air}} {{processor}} (FAP), matched with the variable refrigerant flow {{air conditioning system}} (VRF AC), has been developed. Two control methods were adopted to control the system running and <b>air</b> <b>outlet</b> temperature, contrastively. The first method is that the running frequency in heating mode is adjusted {{in terms of the}} ordinary control method of VRF, i. e., constant condensation temperature. The experiment demonstrates the control method is not feasible. For nominal heating under different static pressure and defrosting under 200 Pa static pressure, the system fluctuates frequently. And for high temperature heating, the <b>air</b> <b>outlet</b> temperature far exceeds the target temperature. Furthermore, the control model of variable condensation temperature target has been presented, and the heat transfer correction factor is introduced into the control model. And the control parameters in the model are determined by experiment. The control model is universal for FAPs with different capacities by identifying and choosing the heat transfer correction factor in the control program. For low temperature heating, the method of switching rotation speed of the motor can be adopted to enhance <b>air</b> <b>outlet</b> temperature to 22 degrees C. The control strategy can provide guide for the design and application of FAP. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
