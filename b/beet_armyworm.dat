40|$|Camptothecin (CPT), a plant {{alkaloid}} originally {{isolated from the}} native Chinese tree, Camptotheca acuminate, exerts the toxic effect by targeting eukaryotic DNA topoisomerase 1 (DNA Topo 1). Besides as potent anti-cancer agents, CPT and its derivatives are now being explored as potential pesticides for insect control. In this study, we assessed their toxicity to an insect homolog, the Topo 1 protein from <b>beet</b> <b>armyworms</b> (Spodoptera exigua Hübner), a worldwide pest of many important crops. The S. exigua Topo 1 gene contains an ORF of 2790 base pairs that is predicted to encode a polypeptide of 930 amino acids. The deduced polypeptide exhibits polymorphism at residue sites V 420, L 530, A 653 and T 729 (numbered according to human Topo 1) among insect species, which are predicted to confer sensitivity to CPT. The DNA relaxation activity of this protein was subsequently examined using a truncated form that contained the residues 337 – 930 and was expressed in bacteria BL 21 cells. The purified protein retained the ability to relax double-stranded DNA and was susceptible to CPT and its derivative hydroxy-camptothecin (HCPT) in a dose-dependent manner. The same inhibitory effect was also found on the native Topo 1 extracted from IOZCAS-Spex-II cells, a cell line established from <b>beet</b> <b>armyworms.</b> Additionally, CPT and HCPT treatment reduced the steady accumulation of Topo 1 protein despite the increased mRNA expression {{in response to the}} treatment.

50|$|This insect is a generalist {{predator}} {{with a broad}} host range, reportedly attacking 90 insect species, {{which includes}} several important economic pests. Reported prey include the larvae of Mexican bean beetle, European corn borer, diamondback moth, corn earworm, <b>beet</b> <b>armyworm,</b> fall armyworm, cabbage looper, imported cabbageworm, Colorado potato beetle, velvetbean caterpillar, and flea beetles. When prey are scarce, the spined soldier bug may feed on plant juices, but this feeding is not reported to cause plant damage. Podisus maculiventris is associated with several crops including alfalfa, apples, asparagus, beans, celery, cotton, crucifers, cucurbits, eggplant, potatoes, onions, soybeans, sweet corn and tomatoes. The effectiveness of this species in preying on economic pests resulted in its use in classical biological control programs in other countries, including Eastern Europe and Russia. However, {{this has not been}} successful in colder climates, perhaps due to an inability of overwinter. Podisus maculiventris eggs are also sold commercially for use in control programs and this has proven successful in controlling pests in European and North American heated greenhouses. Use in large area field crops is often not economically viable due to the production costs of raising the bug. In addition, naturally occurring populations often are not numerous enough to overpower large populations of pests in the spring.

40|$|Abstract The <b>beet</b> <b>armyworm</b> Spodoptera exigua (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) is {{difficult}} to control using chemical insecticides because {{of the development of}} insecticide resistance. Several pest control agents are used to control the <b>beet</b> <b>armyworm.</b> Entomopathogenic fungi are one of the candidates for eco-friendly pest control instead of chemical control agents. In this study, among various entomopathogenic fungal strains isolated from soil two isolates were selected as high virulence pathogens against larva of <b>beet</b> <b>armyworm.</b> Control efficacy of fungal conidia was influenced by conidia concentration, temperature, and relative humidity (RH). The isolates Metarhizium anisopliae FT 83 showed 100 % cumulative mortality against second instar larvae of S. exigua 3 days after treatment at 1 × 107 conidia/mL and Paecilomyces fumosoroseus FG 340 caused 100 % mortality 6 days after treatment at 1 × 104 conidia/mL. Both M. anisopliae FT 83 and P. fumosoroseus FG 340 effectively controlled the moth at 20 ~ 30 oC. M. anisopliae FT 83 was significantly affected mortality by RH: mortality was 86. 7 % at 85 % RH and 13. 4 % at 45 % RH. P. fumosoroseus FG 340 showed high mortality as 90 % at 45 % RH and 100 % at 75 % RH 6 days after conidia treatments.

40|$|Many {{studies have}} {{reported}} the effect of nitrogen (N) fertilization on plant constitutive defense responses; however, {{little is known about}} their effects on plant induced defense patterns and its consequence for insect herbivores. In our experiments, the effects of N availability on growth, nutritional quality (N content, protein/carbohydrate [P:C] ratio, modified gross energy [MGE]), and constitutive phenolics of corn, Zea mays L. were quantified. Moreover, the indirect effects of N fertilization on the <b>beet</b> <b>armyworm,</b> Spodoptera exigua Hübner through larval performance and feeding preference were examined. N fertilization increased plant growth, and depressed defense traits by increasing N content and the P:C ratio, as well as decreasing the constitutive concentration of phenolics. Subsequently, <b>beet</b> <b>armyworm</b> showed higher performance and preferentially fed on high-N corn because of its low defense traits. After <b>beet</b> <b>armyworm</b> feeding, high-N corn significantly deterred larval feeding, and had negative effects on the performance of <b>beet</b> <b>armyworm</b> through decreasing P:C ratio and increasing induced phenolics. On the contrary, there were no significant changes in P:C ratio and phenolics in low-N corn after feeding damage. Larval performance and preference were also not affected by induced compounds in low-N corn, which suggested that the expression of induced defense was dependent on N availability. The result indicates that N availability can exert a variety of bottom-up effect on plant defense patterns to influence insect population dynamics, and thereby may represent a source of variation in plant-insect interactions...|$|E

40|$|Several {{aspects of}} {{the control of the}} <b>beet</b> <b>armyworm,</b> Spodopteraexigua (Hübner) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) in {{greenhouse}} crops with nuclear polyhedrosis viruses (NPVs) (Baculoviridae, subgroup A) were studied. <b>Beet</b> <b>armyworm</b> behaviour was observed in various crops. The distribution of egg batches (Chapter 2) was found to be similar in chrysanthemum, tomato, gerbera and geranium. Most eggs were laid on the underside of leaves within 10 cm of the soil surface. In chrysanthemum moths deposited more eggs on very young than on older plants. No correlation was found between size of egg batches and plant species, plant age or position within in a crop. After hatching <b>beet</b> <b>armyworm</b> larvae gradually moved upwards to the top of chrysanthemum plants (Chapter 3) and then predominantly fed on the upper foliage layers. On tomato, however, larvae did not move upwards and mainly fed on the lower leaves. On chrysanthemums most feeding of the younger larvae occurred at the underside of foliage while the upper epidermis remained intact. Larvae dispersing from a single egg batch of 35 eggs damaged about 90 small and 50 tall chrysanthemum plants during their development. The five successive larval stages contributed 0. 1 %, 0. 4 %, 4 %, 20 % and 75 % to the total foliage consumption, respectively. Five nuclear polyhedrosis viruses infectious for <b>beet</b> <b>armyworm</b> larvae were compared for their potential as biological control agent (Chapter 4). Restriction endonuclease patterns of the DNA showed that three of the isolates, collected from deceased <b>beet</b> <b>armyworm</b> larvae in the Netherlands, are closely related with Mamestrabrassicae nuclear polyhedrosis virus (MbMNPV). Therefore they were named MbMNPV-NL 80, MbMNPV-NL 82 and MbMNPV-NL 83. These isolates are not closely related with AutographcalifornicaMNPV (AcMNPV) and Spodopteraexigua MNPV (SeMNPV), both originating from the USA. Comparison of the biological activity of these five MNPVs (Chapter 4) showed that the SeMNPV has a greater biological activity against <b>beet</b> <b>armyworm</b> larvae than MbMNPV-NL 80, - NL 82, -NL 83 and AcMNPV. The LD- 50 values of the five MNPVs against second instar larvae were 3, 26, 14, 17 and 18 polyhedra, respectively. SeMNPV, therefore, seemed to be the most suitable candidate for biological control of the <b>beet</b> <b>armyworm.</b> Bioassays carried out with the droplet-feeding method showed that larvae became less susceptible to SeMNPV with increasing age (Chapter 5). The LD- 50 values for the five subsequent larval instars were 4, 3, 39, 132 and 11610 polyhedra. The LT- 50 values increased from ca. 3. 5 days for first instars to almost 6 days for fifth instar larvae. Production of SeMNPV (Chapter 6) was carried out in late fourth instar larvae reared on semi- synthetic diet. A maximum amount of virus, 1 to 2 x 10 9 polyhedra/larva, was produced in individually-reared larvae, after seven days of incubation at WC, with an inoculum of 7. 5 x 10 4 polyhedra/cm 2 diet surface. Virus yield was reduced to ca. 9 x 10 8 polyhedra/larva when production was carried out in groups of 400 and 600 larvae per container. Biological activity of virus harvested from living and from deceased larvae was similar. Microbial contaminants, predominantly bacteria, in the produced virus batches numbered 1 - 6 % of the number of polyhedra. Vertebrate pathogens were not present in any of the produced virus batches. The effect of high-volume handspraying (HV), low-volume spinning disc (LV-SD) and ultra-low- volume electrodynamic (ULV-ED) application systems on the efficacy of larval control with SeMNPV was studied on chrysanthemum crops (Chapter 7). Virus applications with the LV-SD system generally showed a slightly better control efficacy than was achieved with the HV system. The efficacy of ULV-ED applications was much lower except on a very short crop, where control comparable with that of the LV-SD system was obtained. The efficacy of SeMNPV for control of <b>beet</b> <b>armyworm</b> larval populations was studied in chrysanthemum, gerbera, kalanchoe and tomato crops (Chapter 8). Applications of 1 x 10 8 polyhedra/m 2 resulted in 95 - 100 % larval mortality on each of the crops. Virus applications caused comparable levels of mortality in populations of early and late instar larvae. Reduction in feeding damage to the crops, however, was more pronounced when the larvae were early instars at the time of virus application. Single applications with the virus resulted in higher levels of larval mortality as double applications with 0. 1 % methomyl or 0. 1 % diflubenzuron. In the general discussion (Chapter 9) the results from the various studies, commercial aspects and the current situation in Dutch greenhouse industry were evaluated. This lead to the final conclusion that there is good potential for the practical use and commercial development of SeMNPV as a control agent of <b>beet</b> <b>armyworm</b> larvae in Dutch greenhouses...|$|E
40|$|Agrobacterium-mediated genetic {{transformation}} {{was applied to}} produce <b>beet</b> <b>armyworm</b> (Spodoptera exigua Hübner) resistant tropical shallots (Allium cepa L. group Aggregatum). A cry 1 Ca or a H 04 hybrid gene from Bacillus thuringiensis, driven by the chrysanthemum ribulose- 1, 5 -bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase small subunit (Rubisco SSU) promoter, along with the hygromycin phosphotransferase gene (hpt) driven by the CaMV 35 S promoter, was employed for {{genetic transformation}}. An average transformation frequency of 3. 68 % was obtained from two shallot cultivars, Tropix and Kuning. After transfer of the in vitro plants to the greenhouse 69 % of the cry 1 Ca and 39 % of the H 04 transgenic shallots survived the first half year. After one year of cultivation in the greenhouse the remaining cry 1 Ca and H 04 transgenic plants grew vigorously and had a normal bulb formation, although the cry 1 Ca transgenic plants (and controls) had darker green leaves compared to their H 04 counterparts. Standard PCR, adaptor ligation PCR and Southern analyses confirmed the integration of T-DNA into the shallot genome. Northern blot and ELISA analyses revealed expression of the cry 1 Ca or H 04 gene in the transgenic plants. The amount of Cry 1 Ca expressed in transgenic plants was higher than the expression levels of H 04 (0. 39 vs. 0. 16 % of the total soluble leaf proteins, respectively).

The proportion of eggs laid on the plants to total that were deposited was highest for pigweed and lowest for cabbage in all tests. <b>Beet</b> <b>armyworm</b> females were significantly deterred from laying eggs on cabbage and sunflower, while pigweed and cotton elicited a positive oviposition preference. Pepper tended to be neutral or slightly unattractive. Apparent interactions among plant species in choice tests produced measurable shifts in oviposition preference. Most notably, female response to pepper was enhanced in the presence of cotton or pigweed. Egg masses laid on the plants contained signiÞcantly higher numbers of eggs than those laid {{on the surface of the}} cage, except in the case of cabbage leaves. Knowledge of hierarchies of host plant oviposition preference by <b>beet</b> <b>armyworm</b> females will be useful in understanding the population dynamics of this important agricultural pest, and for developing effective monitoring and management strategies...|$|E
40|$|The {{boll weevil}} (Anthonomus grandis grandis Boheman) is {{currently}} under eradication in the U. S. The eradication program is implemented {{by means of}} area-wide applications of malathion ULV. Frequent applications of this insecticide result in high mortality of many beneficial insects, and {{a greater risk of}} secondary pest outbreaks. Notable among the latter are the outbreaks of <b>beet</b> <b>armyworm</b> (Spodoptera exigua H?bner) and cotton aphid (Aphis gossypii Glover) in the Lower Rio Grande Valley in 1995. The present study (i) compared densities of beneficial and pest insect and spider populations between cotton fields in eradication and non-eradication areas; (ii) evaluated the use of beneficial cotton arthropod population densities as indicators of pest damage risks from cotton aphid, <b>beet</b> <b>armyworm,</b> bollworm (Helicoverpa zea Boddie), and other worms (Estigmene acrea Drury, Pseudoplusia includens Walker, and Trichoplusia ni H?bner); and (iii) evaluated the effects of malathion ULV on the red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta Buren) a key arthropod predator in cotton agroecosystems. Studies were conducted in central Texas, in the vicinities of College Station and Dallas, during 2002 and 2003. Results showed that a majority of cotton predators were negatively impacted by malathion ULV applications. However, convergent lady beetle (Hippodamia convergens Gu?rin-M?neville) densities were greater in active eradication fields than inactive fields. Stepwise regression analyses identified densities of lacewing (Chrysoperla carnea Stephens) larvae and lady beetle larvae (H. convergens, Coleomegilla maculata De Geer, Harmonia axyridis Pallas, and Coccinella septempunctata L.) as predictors of cotton aphid density, and density of total spiders as predictors of bollworm density. Predictors of <b>beet</b> <b>armyworm</b> or other worm densities could not be determined. This study demonstrated malathion ULV was highly toxic to fire ants, and could repel ants from treated surfaces. Malathion ULV reduced the number of foraging fire ants in the cotton canopy for three weeks and reduced fire ant predation of <b>beet</b> <b>armyworm</b> eggs. Predictors of secondary pest densities have been suggested which, if utilized, may help to prevent the occurrence of secondary pest outbreaks under boll weevil eradication. Validation of these predictors should be preformed before implementing them into an eradication program...|$|E

40|$|A {{field study}} was {{conducted}} at Yuma in 1990 to examine the efficacy of several biological insecticide formulations on <b>beet</b> <b>armyworm</b> in seedling lettuce. After a single application at thinning, none of the insecticides adequately reduced larval populations below damaging levels. Reductions in plant stand by larvalfeeding were significantly lower in plots treated with Lannate, Javelin, Biobit and Dipel. Lettuce seedling densities were reduced greaterthan 80 % in untreated plots...|$|E
