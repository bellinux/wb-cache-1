50|$|The {{mechanism}} of action of <b>benfluralin</b> involves inhibition of root and shoot development.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Benfluralin</b> is an {{herbicide}} of the dinitroaniline class. [...] It is used {{to control}} grasses and other weeds. Annual use in the United States was approximately 700,000 pounds in 2004.|$|E
50|$|Dinitroanilines are {{intermediates}} in {{the preparation}} of various industrially important chemicals including dyes and pesticides. Herbicides which are derivatives of dinitroanilines include <b>benfluralin,</b> butralin, chlornidine, dinitramine, dipropalin, ethalfluralin, fluchloralin, isopropalin, methalpropalin, nitralin, oryzalin, pendimethalin, prodiamine, profluralin, and trifluralin.|$|E
40|$|In this study, Pinus pinea {{seedlings}} mycorrhized with selected ectomycorrhizal fungi (ECMF), Pisolithus tinctorius and Suillus bellinii, {{were exposed}} to the herbicide <b>benfluralin.</b> Non-mycorrhized P. pinea seedlings and seedlings mycorrhized with ECMF were transferred to benfluralin-spiked soils at levels of 0. 165, 1. 65 and 16. 5 mg kg 1. Plant growth and the fungal role on plant antioxidant response were assessed. In the presence of <b>benfluralin,</b> higher plant growth was observed in mycorrhized plants compared to non-mycorrhized plants, but ECMF colonisation and nutrient uptake were affected by the herbicide. <b>Benfluralin</b> showed no effect on lipid peroxidation in P. pinea seedlings. However, seedlings mycorrhized with S. bellinii showed higher levels of lipid peroxidation when compared to non-mycorrhized ones, both in the presence and absence of <b>benfluralin.</b> The increase of lipid peroxidation could be related to seedling growth induced by the fungus and not to <b>benfluralin</b> toxicity. A similar trend was observed in seedlings mycorrhized with P. tinctorius when exposed to higher <b>benfluralin</b> concentrations, suggesting that the antioxidant response to <b>benfluralin</b> is related not only to fungus species, but also to the level of stress applied in the soil. The higher amount of superoxide dismutase activity in P. pinea seedlings tissues exposed to <b>benfluralin</b> could indicate a plant adaptative response to <b>benfluralin</b> toxicity. Catalase activity showed no increase with <b>benfluralin</b> exposure. Pre-established P. tinctorius mycorrhization conferred root protection and enhanced plant growth in <b>benfluralin</b> spiked soil, inferring that P. tinctorius – P. pinea association could advantageous for plant growth in soils contaminated with pesticide...|$|E
40|$|This is {{to inform}} you that the Environmental Protection Agency (hereafter {{referred}} to as EPA or the Agency) has completed its review of the available data and public comments received related to the risk assessment for the dinitroaniline pesticide, <b>benfluralin</b> (Balan ®). Based on its review, EPA has identified risk mitigation measures that the Agency believes are necessary to address the human health and environmental risks associated with the current use of <b>benfluralin.</b> The EPA is now publishing its reregistration eligibility and risk management decisions for the current uses of <b>benfluralin,</b> and its associated human health and environmental risks. The enclosed “Reregistration Eligibility Decision for <b>Benfluralin,</b> ” which was approved on July 30, 2004, contains the Agency’s decision on the individual chemical <b>benfluralin.</b> A Notice of Availability for this Reregistration Eligibility Decision (RED) for <b>benfluralin</b> is published in the Federal Register.

40|$|According to Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has {{reviewed}} the Maximum Residue Levels (MRLs) currently established at European {{level for the}} pesticide active substance <b>benfluralin.</b> In order to assess the occurrence of <b>benfluralin</b> residues in plants, processed commodities, rotational crops and livestock, EFSA considered the conclusions derived {{in the framework of}} Directive 91 / 414 /EEC as well as the European authorisations reported by Member States (incl. the supporting residues data). Based on the assessment of the available data, MRL proposals were derived and a consumer risk assessment was carried out. Although no apparent risk to consumers was identified, some information required by the regulatory framework was found to be missing. Hence, the consumer risk assessment is considered indicative only and some MRL proposals derived by EFSA still require further consideration by risk managers...|$|E
40|$|Leishmania infantum promastigotes and amastigotes were axenically cultured {{and exposed}} to the known tubulin binding compounds, the dinitroanilines, trifluralin, <b>benfluralin,</b> pendimethalin, oryzalin and the {{precursor}} of the dinitroanilines, chloralin, as well as isomers of chloralin and trifluralin and to the benzimidazole, albendazole. Drug induced inhibition was observed using [3 H]thymidine uptake compared with untreated controls. In vitro analysis demonstrated {{a significant difference in}} the activity of five of the seven dinitroanilines between both life cycle stages of L. infantum. The amastigotes were 20 -times more sensitive to chloralin and its isomer than to the dinitroanilines whereas the promastigotes were similar in sensitivity to the dinitroanilines and to chloralin and its isomer. This interesting finding suggests that the dinitroaniline precursors may have different target sites in the amastigotes to those within the promastigotes. Additionally, both chloralin and its isomer, and to a lesser extent <b>benfluralin,</b> caused a substantial stimulation of thymidine incorporation (up to 50 %) at low concentrations. Dose response analysis suggests that the dinitroanilines may have more than one mode of action against L. infantum amastigotes and promastigotes. The inhibitory effects of the dinitroanilines against L. infantum vary from previous findings using the dinitroanilines against other Leishmania spp. The 348 base pair DNA sequence coding for β- tubulin from amino acid residues 132 to 248 was obtained for L. infantum and used to compare the in vivo efficacy of albendazole with predicted activity based on β-tubulin sequences of known benzimidazole sensitive protozoa. The use of β-tubulin sequence as a predictive model of benzimidazole activity is discussed with particular reference to L. infantum...|$|E
40|$|A rodent {{model of}} malaria, Plasmodium berghei, {{was used to}} assess the {{antimalarial}} potential of dinitroaniline herbicides. Trifluralin, pendimethalin, oryzalin, and <b>benfluralin</b> were all active against P. berghei in vitro at, or close to, submicromolar concentrations, with a rank order of potency similar to that against other protozoa. The dinitroanilines did not elicit a cytotoxic effect against a mammalian cell line at concentrations 100 -fold higher than those for activity against P. berghei. Neither trifluralin nor oryzalin exhibited any antimalarial activity in vivo after oral administration at the maximum dose tolerated by the host. In a pharmacokinetic study, {{it was found that the}} lack of in vivo antimalarial activity was due to poor absorption. Other DNs which have better absorption characteristics than either trifluralin or oryzalin may offer more scope for antimalarial activity in vivo...|$|E
