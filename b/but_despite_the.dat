5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1984, Girlschool were {{in need of a}} new lead guitar player and singer, of a new recording contract and chart success <b>but,</b> <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> difficult situation, the band did not give up. The search for new members ended with the arrival of guitarist Cris Bonacci and singer and keyboard player Jackie Bodimead, both from the all-female hard rock band She. She were playing in London clubs at the time, trying to get a record contract and attract the attention of the British music press.|$|E
5|$|Girlschool’s {{third album}} Screaming Blue Murder was {{recorded}} in February and March 1982 {{under the direction of}} Nigel Gray, the successful producer of The Police and The Professionals. The album had a worldwide release in June 1982 <b>but,</b> <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> strong promotion, it reached only No.27 in the UK Album Chart. Critics generally considered Screaming Blue Murder a weaker offering in comparison with the preceding two albums.|$|E

5|$|On August 11, 1952, Williams was {{dismissed}} from the Grand Ole Opry for habitual drunkenness and missing shows. He returned to Shreveport, Louisiana {{to perform in}} KWKH and WBAM shows and in the Louisiana Hayride, for which he toured again. His performances were acclaimed when he was sober, <b>but</b> <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> efforts of his work associates {{to get him to}} shows sober, his abuse of alcohol resulted in occasions when he did not appear or his performances were poor. In October 1952 he married Billie Jean Jones.|$|E
5|$|The {{suicide of}} Nero on 9 June 68 brought the Julio-Claudian dynasty to an end, {{leading to the}} chaotic Year of the Four Emperors, which saw the {{successive}} {{rise and fall of}} the emperors Galba, Otho and Vitellius, until the accession of Vespasian on 21 December 69. Virtually nothing is known of Nerva's whereabouts during 69, <b>but</b> <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> fact that Otho was his brother-in-law, he appears to have been one of the earliest and strongest supporters of the Flavians.|$|E
5|$|After {{two weeks}} in Leipzig, before {{the second week of}} January 1793, Kościuszko set off for Paris, where he tried to gain French support for the planned {{uprising}} in Poland. He stayed there until summer, <b>but</b> <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> growing revolutionary influence there, the French paid only lip service to the Polish cause, and refused to commit themselves to anything concrete. Kościuszko concluded that the French authorities were not interested in Poland beyond what use it could have for their own cause, and he was increasingly disappointed in the pettiness of the French Revolution—the infighting among different factions, and the growing reign of terror.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{recruitment}} of Tomáš Ujfaluši and Johnny Heitinga pushed Pablo down the pecking order, he finished the 2008–09 season with 21 league appearances. An offer from Real Zaragoza of less than €5m {{was rejected by the}} club as insufficient, <b>but</b> <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> arrival of Juanito adding to the defensive competition, Pablo said he was happy to see out the remaining year of his contract. In that final season, he played rarely. He took part in the early rounds of the Copa del Rey and in the group stage of the Champions League as Atlético finished third in their group and dropped into the Europa League, but made his last appearance for the club, as a late substitute, on 20 December 2009.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the final}} Test, Hassett's run-scoring peaked when he stroked 232 against Brown's {{men in a}} drawn match for Victoria. In the Fifth Test at the MCG, he top-scored with 92 before his {{dismissal}} to a one-handed diving catch sparked a collapse and Australia managed only 217 batting first. The tourists took a first innings lead and Hassett made 48 in Australia’s second innings of 197. England made the 95 needed for victory, and the eight-wicket loss was Australia's first Test defeat since the resumption of international cricket after World War II, ending a streak of 25 Tests without defeat. Hassett and Brown described the series as the friendliest they had been involved in, <b>but</b> <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> success on the field, the series was poorly attended and revenue was down by around 25% from the corresponding tour four years earlier, mainly due {{to the absence of}} Bradman to spark public interest.|$|E
5|$|Clemson {{returned}} Georgia Tech's kickoff to its 43-yard line, <b>but</b> <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> good field position, Clemson {{was unable}} to take advantage. On the first play of the drive, Clemson quarterback Parker threw an interception to Georgia Tech defender Dominique Reese, who went out of bounds at the Tech 45-yard line. Georgia Tech's offense returned to the field at that point and began driving down the field. In two plays, Tech passed the 50-yard line. In six more, it penetrated the Clemson 10-yard line. Once there, however, the Yellow Jackets' drive stalled. Three consecutive penalties against Georgia Tech pushed the Yellow Jackets back 20 yards, and Tech {{was unable to}} score a touchdown or gain a first down after that setback. Kicker Blair again returned to the field and scored a 49-yard field goal. With 5:35 remaining in the first half, Georgia Tech extended its lead to 13–7.|$|E

5|$|During Euro 2008, new Dutch manager Marco van Basten {{changed the}} side's {{formation}} to 4–2–3–1, preferring the midfield trio of Rafael van der Vaart, Wesley Sneijder and Dirk Kuyt, with Robben left to battle {{for a position}} with Robin van Persie on the wing. In the group match against France, which the Netherlands won 4–1, Robben was brought on at half-time. He dragged {{the ball out of}} reach of a defender near the half-way line and paced his way ahead of three defenders, then crossed straight to Van Persie, who powered a shot into the goal past France goalkeeper Grégory Coupet. At 2–0, Thierry Henry scored a goal for France, making it 2–1, but almost directly after the restart, Robben was played through by Sneijder and he ran at the France goal and was forced into an acute angle, <b>but</b> <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> angle, he shot the ball into the net past Coupet.|$|E
5|$|Fred Speller {{attempted}} a comeback, appearing twice {{for the first}} team early in the season, but the injury received against Darwen proved {{the end of his}} professional football career. Bernard Pumfrey left for Midland League club Gainsborough Trinity, and went on to captain that club in the Football League. Walter Jackson, William Reynolds and Gilbert Smith were all released to join Birmingham & District League club Berwick Rangers, and Percy Watson returned to his native Yorkshire. Chris Charsley played no more League football, concentrating instead on his police career: he reached the rank of Chief Inspector in the Birmingham force, and in 1899 was appointed Chief Constable of Coventry. Small Heath signed the former Sunderland full back Jack Oliver, whom they had failed to recruit earlier in the season, <b>but</b> <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> misgivings of the local press, they were to negotiate their debut First Division season with no other major signings.|$|E
5|$|Green married Michael Farrar in 1979 while {{practicing}} as {{an emergency}} physician. The marriage was tumultuous, and Farrar filed for divorce in July 1995. Between August and September 1995, Farrar repeatedly fell violently ill, and despite numerous hospitalizations his doctors could not pinpoint {{the source of his}} illness. Green's emotional stability deteriorated and she began to drink heavily, even while supervising her children. On October 24, 1995, the Farrar family home, occupied by Green and the couple's three children, caught fire. Kate Farrar and Debora Green escaped without harm, <b>but</b> <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> efforts of firefighters, Timothy and Kelly Farrar died in the blaze. Investigation showed that trails of accelerant in the house led back to Green's bedroom, and that the source of Michael Farrar's intractable illness had been ricin, a poison served to him in his food by Green.|$|E
50|$|He {{made his}} final {{international}} appearance in 1992 against Australia. That year {{he stood for}} election as Rector of the University of Dundee, <b>but</b> <b>despite</b> being <b>the</b> favourite candidate he was defeated by Stephen Fry.|$|R

50|$|In {{his first}} season, the club made several {{transfers}} of certain reputable players, such as Javi Moreno, Demetrio Albertini and Fabricio Coloccini coming from Milan, <b>but</b> <b>despite</b> this, <b>the</b> club finished {{the season in}} 12th position.|$|R
5|$|In 1892 Piłsudski {{returned}} from exile {{and settled in}} Adomavas Manor near Teneniai (now in Šilalė district). In 1893 he joined the Polish Socialist Party (PPS) and helped organize its Lithuanian branch. Initially he sided with the Socialists' more radical wing, <b>but</b> <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> socialist movement's ostensible internationalism he remained a Polish nationalist. In 1894, as its chief editor, he began publishing an underground socialist newspaper, Robotnik (The Worker); he would also be one of its chief writers, and, initially, a typesetter. In 1895 he became a PPS leader, and took the position that doctrinal issues were of minor importance and that socialist ideology should be merged with nationalist ideology, since that combination offered the greatest chance of restoring Polish independence.|$|E
5|$|Indiana quarterback John Paci was the {{cornerstone}} of Indiana's offense, and completed 133 of 258passes for 1,796yards and eighttouchdowns during the regular season. During the team's regular-season game against Penn State, Paci completed the longest passing play in Indiana history, completing a 99-yard pass to wide receiver Thomas Lewis for a touchdown. That play in part helped make Paci's performance against Penn State the fourth-highest single-game passing total for an Indiana quarterback in school history. Paci suffered a separated shoulder during the regular season, <b>but</b> <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> injury, he was predicted to start at quarterback against Virginia Tech and undergo surgery following the Independence Bowl.|$|E
5|$|Luftflotte 2 {{was well}} {{used in this}} way. Operations against Kenley, Biggin Hill, North Weald and Hornchurch had the {{potential}} to destroy 11 Group's major sector stations and impair its defences. It would also draw the defending fighters into battle. The attempt to attack Kenley, however, failed and 9 Staffel KG 76 paid a high price. The weather prevented any chance of the raids on Hornchurch and North Weald being successful. On the other hand, Luftflotte 3 had poor intelligence, and its raids on the radar stations were ineffective. Radar elimination would enable the Luftwaffe to destroy the command and control system of Fighter Command, <b>but</b> <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> severe damage done to the Poling station, the existence of other stations nearby gave the system plenty of cover. The airfields the Air Fleet attacked at Ford, Gosport and Thorney Island {{had nothing to do with}} the main battle as they belonged to Coastal Command and the FAA. Sperrle and his command remained unaware of their errors in intelligence.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{his return}} to competition, the 200 m {{remained}} Bolt's primary event, beating Justin Gatlin's meet record in Ostrava, Czech Republic. Bolt had aspired to run under twenty seconds to claim a season's best <b>but,</b> <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> fact that bad weather had impaired his run, {{he was happy to}} end the meeting with just the victory. However, a sub-20-second finish was soon his, as he set a new personal best of 19.88 s at the 2006 Athletissima Grand Prix in Lausanne, Switzerland, finishing behind Xavier Carter and Tyson Gay to earn a bronze medal. Bolt had focused his athletics aims, stating that 2006 was a year to gain experience. Also, he was more keen on competing over longer distances, setting his sights on running regularly in both 200 m and 400 m events within the next two years.|$|E

As Viv finishes reading the note, a large police detachment arrives. After taking her statement, the officer in charge of the detail reiterates Bond's advice, but also warns Viv that all men involved in violent crime and espionage, regardless of which side they are on—including Bond himself—are dangerous and that Viv should avoid them. Viv reflects on this as she motors off {{at the end of the}} book, continuing her tour of America, <b>but</b> <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> officer's warning still devoted to the memory of the spy who loved her.|$|E
5|$|After {{a period}} of {{convalescence}} in New Zealand, Shackleton returned to England via San Francisco and New York. As the first significant person to return from the Antarctic, he {{found that he was}} in demand; in particular, the Admiralty wished to consult him about its further proposals for the rescue of Discovery. With Sir Clements Markham's blessing, he accepted a temporary post assisting the outfitting of the Terra Nova for the second Discovery relief operation, but turned down the offer to sail with her as chief officer. He also assisted in the equipping of the Argentinean corvette Uruguay, which was being fitted out for the relief of the stranded Swedish Antarctic Expedition under Nordenskiöld. In search of more permanent employment, Shackleton applied for a regular commission in the Royal Navy, via the back-door route of the Supplementary List, <b>but</b> <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> sponsorship of Markham and {{of the president of the}} Royal Society, he was not successful. Instead, he became a journalist, working for the Royal Magazine, but he found this unsatisfactory. He was then offered, and accepted, the secretaryship of the Royal Scottish Geographical Society (RSGS), a post which he took up on 11 January 1904. On 9 April 1904 he married Emily Dorman, with whom he had three children: Raymond, Cecily, and Edward.|$|E
