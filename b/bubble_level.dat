40|$|First Version: April 2011, This Version: March 2015 This paper {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between bubbles and governmentbailouts. As long as bubble size is relatively small, <b>bubbles</b> increase production <b>level,</b> but once the size becomes too large, then bubbles reduce it. Given this non-monotonic relationship, we show that bailouts for bursting bubbles may positively influence ex-ante production efficiency and relax the existence condition of stochastic <b>bubbles.</b> The <b>level</b> of bailouts has a non-monotonic relationship with production efficiency and a "partial bailout" policy achieves production efficiency. Moreover, it examines the welfare effects of bailout policies rigorously and shows that even non-risky bubbles may be undesirable for taxpayers. 基盤研究(S) = Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (S...|$|R

50|$|The granatnik wz. 30 and granatnik wz. 36 was {{an ingenious}} weapon. Unlike {{ordinary}} mortars of the era, the firing angle was fixed at 45 degrees {{and the range}} was regulated not by raising or lowering the barrel but by limiting the volume of a gas chamber (see also the Type 89 grenade discharger). The unrifled 46 mm barrel was attached to a flat base equipped with a <b>bubble</b> <b>level</b> and stabilised by a folding bipod. On top of the barrel was an exhaust pipe, equipped with a valve and attached {{to the bottom of}} the barrel. By turning the valve, soldiers operating the mortar could limit the size of combustion chamber beneath the grenade, setting the muzzle velocity and thus the firing range at between 100 and 800 metres (700 for the wz. 30 version). The mortar was equipped with a frame sight and a muzzle sight, as well as a firing trigger located at the base of the barrel.|$|E
