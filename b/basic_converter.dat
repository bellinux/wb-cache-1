40|$|A {{modification}} of the series resonant converter topology is presented which extends converter operation from no-load to full-load. This result is accomplished by adding two switches at the secondary-side bridge rectifier, thus improving output voltage control. The resonant inverter can be operated either at constant switching frequency, even for the half-bridge topology, or at variable switching frequency. With constant switching frequency, the output voltage is regulated by controlling the switches of the rectifier stage. Soft-switching commutations of all switches are maintained in any operating condition, thus optimizing overall efficiency.

A switch-mode dc-to-ac inverter based on a dc-to-dc converter topology using a novel nonlinear robust control to generate a sinusoidal output waveform is simulated. The control scheme is such that the output voltage remains dynamically unchanged when there are large disturbances in input voltage or load current. Computer simulation result shows the robustness and fast dynamic response of the control system. This type of inverter has many advantages over the traditional bridgetype inverter. The stability analysis of the control system and MATLAB simulation results are provided. The ultimate objective of this paper is simulation of a switch-mode inverter with dc-to-dc converter topology, which employs a nonlinear robust control strategy so as to acquire the a good steady state and dynamic performance.

40|$|Abstract—A {{variable-frequency}} predictive {{digital control}} method for the inductor current in switched-mode converters is introduced in this letter. This method is predictive in nature because the transistor off-time required for achieving the target current is calculated ahead of time.

The control laws for continuous and discontinuous modes of operation of the three <b>basic</b> <b>converters</b> are derived. Stability and robustness criteria are presented. The variable-frequency predictive control obviates the need for current-loop compensation and has the advantages of single-cycle response and relatively simple implementation. The control method is demonstrated in a digital signal processor (DSP) for a boost power factor corrector (PFC), which shows excellent current tracking and a very low harmonic distortion of the line current.

40|$|The {{switching}} {{behavior of}} power converters with "ideal" electronic devices (EDs) {{makes it difficult}} to define a switched model that describes the dynamics of the converter in all possible operating conditions, i. e., a "complete" model. Indeed, simplifying assumptions on the sequences of modes are usually adopted, also in order to obtain averaged models and discrete-time maps. In this paper, we show how the complementarity framework can be used to represent complete switched models of a wide class of power converters, with EDs having characteristics represented by piecewise-affine (even complicated) relations. The model equations can be written in an easy and compact way without the enumeration of all converter modes, eventually formalizing the procedure to an algorithm. The complementarity model can be used to perform transient simulations and time-domain analysis. Mathematical tools coming from nonlinear programming allow to simulate numerically the transient behavior of even complex power converters. Also rigorous time-domain analysis is possible without excluding pathological situations like, for instance, inconsistent initial conditions and simultaneous switchings. <b>Basic</b> <b>converter</b> topologies are used as examples to show the construction procedure for the complementarity models and their usefulness for simulating the dynamic evolution also for nontrivial operating conditions...|$|E
