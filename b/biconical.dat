5|$|There {{are several}} classifications of beads {{common to the}} Swahili coastal {{settlements}} {{that have been found}} at Gedi. In his examination of beads found at Gedi and the Limpopo Valley (Mapungubwe), Schofield placed beads into three categories: red, blue, green, and yellow cylinders made from cane glass; smaller black, red, green, yellow, and blue <b>biconical</b> and lenticular beads made from wound glass; and spheres of red, black, and yellow pressed glass. Kirkman similarly created eight classifications of beads. All but 25 of the 558 beads categorized as class 1–3 were made from opaque glass. During his excavations at Gedi, Kirkman recovered 631 beads in six stratigraphic layers. Monochrome yellow, green, and black wound and pressed glass beads formed in melon, <b>biconical,</b> globular, barrel, and cylindrical shapes were the most common styles represented in strata from the fourteenth century and sporadically appeared in later levels. Small drawn cane glass beads are also commonly represented in fourteenth and fifteenth century levels with the colors green, opaque red, yellow, and black occurring more frequently than blue, brown, and red. It is believed that Islamic traders brought the majority of glass beads to East Africa, which were traded across the continent, since there is no evidence for local production or trade south or west of Egypt and Nubia {{with the exception of a}} site in Igbo Olokun Grove at Ile-Ife in southern Nigeria.|$|E

25|$|The figurine {{is roughly}} <b>biconical.</b> Typical of other venus figures, the {{feminine}} features are overemphasized: the thighs and hips are large while the belly, breasts and buttocks are protruding. The head is a cone, the arms are barely sketched, {{and there are}} no hands, feet, or shoulders at all. The back is concave. In some points a few traces of red ochre paint are still visible.|$|E
25|$|It was {{a culture}} {{of the end of}} the Bronze Age (12th-10th century BC), {{widespread}} in much of the Italian peninsula and north-eastern Sicily (including the Aeolian Islands), characterized by the funeral ritual of incineration. The ashes of the deceased were placed into <b>biconical</b> urns decorated with geometric patterns. Their settlements were often located on the top of the hills and protected by stone walls.|$|E
25|$|Tsetse populations can be {{monitored}} and effectively controlled using simple, inexpensive traps. These often use electric blue cloth, since this color attracts the flies. Early traps mimicked {{the form of}} cattle but this seems unnecessary and recent traps are simple sheets or have a <b>biconical</b> form. The traps can kill by channeling the flies into a collection chamber or by exposing the flies to insecticide sprayed on the cloth. Tsetse are also attracted to large dark colors like the hides of cow and buffaloes. Some scientists put forward the idea that zebra have stripes, not as a camouflage in long grass, but because {{the black and white}} bands tend to confuse tsetse and prevent attack.|$|E

50|$|In radio systems, a <b>biconical</b> antenna is a broad-bandwidth antenna made of two roughly conical {{conductive}} objects, nearly touching {{at their}} points. <b>Biconical</b> antennas are broadband dipole antennas, typically exhibiting a bandwidth of three octaves or more. A common subtype is the bowtie antenna, essentially a two-dimensional {{version of the}} biconial design which is often used for short-range UHF television reception. These are also {{sometimes referred to as}} butterfly antennas.|$|E

50|$|The <b>biconical</b> antenna has a broad {{bandwidth}} {{because it}} {{is an example of a}} travelling wave structure; the analysis for a theoretical infinite antenna resembles that of a transmission line. For an infinite antenna, the characteristic impedance at the point of connection is a function of the cone angle only and is independent of the frequency. Practical antennas have finite length and a definite resonant frequency. A simple conical monopole antenna is a wire approximation of the solid <b>biconical</b> antenna and has increased bandwidth (over a simple monopole).|$|E

5000|$|<b>Biconical</b> (or [...] "bicon") antennas {{are often}} used in {{electromagnetic}} interference (EMI) testing either for immunity testing, or emissions testing. While the bicon is very broadband, it exhibits poor efficiency at low frequencies, resulting in low field strengths {{when compared to the}} input power. Log periodic dipole arrays, Yagi-Uda antennas, and reverberation chambers have shown to achieve much higher field strengths for the power input than a simple <b>biconical</b> antenna in an anechoic chamber. However, reverberation chambers, especially, are poor choices when the goal is to fully characterize a modulated or impulse signal rather than merely measuring peak and average spectrum energy content.|$|E
50|$|For {{radiated}} emission measurement, antennas {{are used as}} transducers. Typical antennas specified include dipole, <b>biconical,</b> log-periodic, double ridged guide and conical log-spiral designs. Radiated emissions must be measured in all directions around the DUT.|$|E
