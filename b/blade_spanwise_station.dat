40|$|Results {{are shown}} that give a better {{understanding}} of the factors that influence the initiation and subsequent development of the vortex ring state (VRS).

Time-accurate calculations of the evolution of the rotor wake in the VRS are then presented to obtain more insight into the flows experienced by the rotor in the VRS. These calculations suggest that the location of the boundary of the VRS, and the depth of the VRS regime, is sensitive to the <b>blade</b> <b>spanwise</b> loading distribution, which is influenced by blade twist.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedMotivation {{to expand the}} understanding of a helicopter rotor descending into the vortex ring state (VRS) stems from the aircraft mishaps that have plagued the helicopter community. The V- 22 {{has become the most}} recent victim of encounters with VRS. The onset of VRS is associated {{with the collapse of the}} helical vortex wake in the plane of the rotor. The resulting wake disturbances develop an irregular and aperiodic flow. Rotor blade interaction with the disturbed vortices causes large variations in the <b>blade</b> <b>spanwise</b> aerodynamic load distribution.

40|$|AbstractA {{procedure}} is developed for computing {{the pressure and}} velocity distributions {{on the surface of}} thick helicopter-rotor blades in hovering flight with particular attention directed at the distributions near the blade tips. The fluid medium is incompressible and inviscid. The lifting rotor and its wake are represented by vortex systems which, for the most part, satisfy the Helmholtz theorems. The vortex systems include thin, superimposed, vortex sheets whose filaments are oriented in the <b>blade</b> <b>spanwise</b> and chordwise directions and are constrained to move along the blade surfaces, force-free, inner-wake vortex sheets which are shed from the blade-trailing edges and concentrated tip vortices of prescribed geometry which are shed from the vicinity of the blade tips. A lifting-line, two-dimensional, blade-element approach is used to determine initial values of the vortex-strength distributions and inner-sheet geometries. A transfer is then made to the thick-bladed system and an iterative vortex-panel {{procedure is}} used to reach essentially converged results. The computed pressure distributions in the blade-tip region show good agreement with model data, but improvement is needed in the region of the upper surface where the pressure field is dominated by the formation of the tip vortex.
