5|$|Although {{crystallography}} {{can be used}} {{to characterize}} the disorder in an impure or irregular crystal, crystallography generally requires a pure crystal of high regularity to solve the structure of a complicated arrangement of atoms. Pure, regular crystals can sometimes <b>be</b> <b>obtained</b> <b>from</b> natural or synthetic materials, such as samples of metals, minerals or other macroscopic materials. The regularity of such crystals can sometimes be improved with macromolecular crystal annealing and other methods. However, in many cases, obtaining a diffraction-quality crystal is the chief barrier to solving its atomic-resolution structure.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the term}} lipid is {{sometimes}} {{used as a}} synonym for fats, fats are a subgroup of lipids called triglycerides. Lipids also encompass molecules such as fatty acids and their derivatives (including tri-, di-, monoglycerides, and phospholipids), {{as well as other}} sterol-containing metabolites such as cholesterol. Although humans and other mammals use various biosynthetic pathways both to break down and to synthesize lipids, some essential lipids cannot be made this way and must <b>be</b> <b>obtained</b> <b>from</b> the diet.|$|E

5|$|Hydrogen is not {{an energy}} resource, except in the {{hypothetical}} context of commercial nuclear fusion power plants using deuterium or tritium, a technology presently far from development. The Sun's energy comes from nuclear fusion of hydrogen, but this process is difficult to achieve controllably on Earth. Elemental hydrogen from solar, biological, or electrical sources requires more energy to make than is obtained by burning it, so in these cases hydrogen functions as an energy carrier, like a battery. Hydrogen may <b>be</b> <b>obtained</b> <b>from</b> fossil sources (such as methane), but these sources are unsustainable.|$|E
