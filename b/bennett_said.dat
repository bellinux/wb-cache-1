He added that, due to concerns expressed by Lubbock Trust chairman Harry Cichy that some of the material might be seen as 'homophobic', and following a complaint to the website's server, NetPivotal, and a request from them, some of that page had been removed.|$|E
25|$|Former Commissioner Ed Norris {{was indicted}} on three charges by US Attorney Thomas DiBiagio. Two of the counts charged Norris had made illegal {{personal}} expenditures from the Baltimore Police Department's supplemental account. The third count alleged {{that he had}} lied on a mortgage application, stating that approximately $9,000 he received from his father was not a gift—as was stated in the loan papers—but a loan. As part of a plea bargain in May 2004, Norris pleaded guilty to the first two counts {{and was sentenced to}} six months in federal prison, six months of home detention, and 500 hours of community service, which Judge Dick <b>Bennett</b> <b>said</b> must be served in Baltimore. The plea bargain avoided a possible 30-year sentence on the mortgage fraud charge.|$|E
500|$|Apogee's {{branding}} {{was largely}} Jackson's doing. <b>Bennett</b> <b>said</b> in 2005 that the company's decision to sell purple-coloured products {{was one of}} Jackson's ideas: [...] "He has a good eye for design, {{and we wanted to}} distinguish ourselves from the all-black rack gear that everybody had at that point." [...] Jackson encouraged a lighting designer from Clair Brothers to sketch a company logo on a cocktail napkin over dinner one evening, and that was immediately made the Apogee logo.|$|E

500|$|<b>Bennett</b> <b>said</b> that Gaga {{had written}} an {{original}} {{song for the}} album titled [...] "Paradise". It also contained solo performances along with the duets; Gaga later clarified that the album contained only standards.

500|$|It {{was against}} this {{backdrop}} that Sifton announced his government's policy {{with respect to the}} Alberta and Great Waterways Railway Company. [...] Because it had failed to meet its construction obligations, Sifton introduced legislation to confiscate the proceeds of the sale of government-guaranteed bonds sold to finance the railway's construction. [...] He gave no indication of how the money, which was being held in trust by several banks, would be used. [...] Cross's faction of (primarily northern) Liberals opposed the bill {{on the grounds that it}} did not commit the government to using the money to construct the railway, while the Conservatives opposed it as an unjustified confiscation of private property.

500|$|The {{weakened}} economy presented significant {{challenges to}} provincial government finances. [...] 1931 {{saw the first}} deficit of Brownlee's premiership, of approximately $2.5 million, and 1932's was still larger. [...] During the latter year, the province came within hours of defaulting on a $3 million bond, which was avoided only by a loan from the federal government. [...] Brownlee cut spending aggressively: he closed most of the province's agricultural colleges, reduced the civil service {{by more than a}} third, cut provincial employees' salaries, and disbanded the Alberta Provincial Police, replacing it with the RCMP. [...] His government also increased corporate taxes and implemented a new provincial income tax. [...] These measures proved insufficient, and Brownlee joined his colleagues in the other western provinces in entreating Bennett to help. [...] <b>Bennett</b> <b>said</b> he was privately sympathetic to Brownlee but refused to provide assistance.|$|E

500|$|Romney {{emerged as}} the local public face of the Olympic effort, {{appearing}} in photographs, in news stories, on collectible Olympics pins depicting Romney wrapped by an American flag, and on buttons carrying phrases like [...] "Hey, Mitt, we love you!" [...] Robert H.

Garff believed the initial budget situation was not as bad as Romney portrayed, given there were still three years to reorganize. Utah Senator Bob <b>Bennett</b> <b>said</b> that much of the needed federal money was already in place. An analysis by The Boston Globe later stated that the committee had nearly $1billion in committed revenues at that time. Olympics critic Steve Pace, who led Utahns for Responsible Public Spending, thought Romney exaggerated the initial fiscal state {{to lay the groundwork for}} a well-publicized rescue.|$|E
500|$|In 1994, Paula Jones {{initiated}} {{a sexual harassment}} lawsuit against Clinton, claiming that he made unwanted advances towards her in 1991; Clinton denied the allegations. In April 1998, the case was initially dismissed by Judge Susan Webber Wright {{on the grounds that}} it lacked legal merit. Jones appealed Webber Wright's ruling, and her suit gained traction following Clinton's admission to having an affair with Monica Lewinsky in August 1998. In 1998, lawyers for Paula Jones released court documents that alleged a pattern of sexual harassment by Clinton when he was Governor of Arkansas. Robert S. Bennett, Clinton's main lawyer for the case, called the filing [...] "a pack of lies" [...] and [...] "an organized campaign to smear the President of the United States" [...] funded by Clinton's political enemies. Clinton later agreed to an out-of-court settlement and paid Jones $850,000. <b>Bennett</b> <b>said</b> that the president made the settlement only so he could end the lawsuit for good and move on with his life. During the deposition for the Jones lawsuit, which was held at the White House, Clinton denied having sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky – a denial that became the basis for an impeachment charge of perjury.|$|E

Bennett contacted the Special Envoy for North Korean Human Rights Issues, a personal friend of his, who [...] "took the standard government approach: we don't tell industry what to do". Jen Psaki, a spokesperson for the United States Department of State, confirmed that Daniel R.

Construction of the monument began in 1848, was halted from 1854 to 1877, and was completed in 1884. In a Journal review, dated 17 October 1911, Arnold <b>Bennett</b> <b>said</b> of the monument, [...] "Saw Washington monument. Phallic. Appalling. A national catastrophe – only equalled by the Albert Memorial. Tiny doll-like people waiting to go into it." [...] Dan Burstein says of it, [...] "Speaking of sex symbols, there is no more phallic symbol in existence than the Washington Monument, and the Capitol dome can be viewed as breastlike." [...] James Webb used a metaphor to praise the [...] "uplift" [...] power of the Washington Monument as a white phallus, [...] "piercing the air like a bayonet". In the futuristic film Hardwired, set in the United States where everything noteworthy is commercialized, the Washington Monument is used as a giant Trojan condoms billboard.|$|E

[...] The Republican Party {{claimed that the}} ruling {{was based on a}} technicality rather than the merits of the arguments. [...] <b>Bennett</b> <b>said</b> that [...] "The justices did not disagree with our argument that Jennifer Brunner has failed to comply with federal election law. [...] They merely said we don't have a right to bring a private challenge against her under this particular provision." [...] The McCain-Palin campaign said [...] "...the United States Supreme Court does not address violations of the Help America Vote Act (HAVA) by Ohio Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner. Rather, the Court ruled that Congress had likely not authorized private individuals or political parties to bring suit under the section of HAVA requiring voter registration verification through data-matching."

A romantic war film, it focuses on lovers Cecilia and Robbie's (Keira Knightley and McAvoy) lives being torn apart after her jealous younger sister, Briony (Saoirse Ronan) falsely accuses him of rape. Upon reading the script, McAvoy said he thought [...] "If I don't get the part I'm not reading the book because it'll be devastating. It's an amazing role and I really wanted it." [...] McAvoy has called the film [...] "incredibly sad" [...] but considers it an uplifting experience. He also shared that he hoped viewers will be left [...] "absolutely devastated and harrowed."
