Nyong'o also claimed that Weinstein wanted to take off his pants, when she rejected his advances and left the room terrified. Another encounter took place in New York, where she met with Weinstein for dinner after a screening. She quoted Weinstein: [...] "Let’s cut to the chase. I have a private room upstairs where we can have the rest of our meal." [...] She again declined and left the restaurant. She vowed that she would never work with Weinstein, hence her declining a role in Southpaw (2015). Nyong'o mentioned that she hasn't had any more encounters during her time in Hollywood and would rather work with women directors or male feminist directors, who have not abused their power.|$|E

2500|$|Emotional {{education}} trumped intellectual needs, in Neill's eyes, and he {{was associated}} with anti-intellectualism. In actuality, he had a personal interest in scholarship and used his autobiography {{near the end of}} his life to profess the necessity of both emotion and intellect in education, though he often took jabs at what he saw to be education's overemphasis on book-learning. Neill felt that an emotional education freed the intellect to follow what it pleased, and that children required an emotional education to keep up with their own gradual developmental needs. This education usually entailed copious amounts of play and distance from the adult anxieties of work and ambition. Neill was influenced by Sigmund Freud's theories of psychoanalysis, Homer Lane's interpretation of Freud, and later, by the unorthodox sexual theories of Wilhelm Reich. The reverence for Reich appears in the abundant correspondence between them. [...] Neill accepted Reich's claims about cosmic energy and his utopian ideas on human sexuality. In Reich's view, [...] "discharge" [...] of sexual energy leads to happiness, whereas lack of such discharge leads to unhappiness and [...] "rigidity". Although not a trained therapist, Neill gave psychoanalytic private lessons to individual children, designed to unblock impasses in their inner energies. Neill also offered <b>body</b> <b>massage,</b> as suggested by Reich. Neill later found that freedom cured better than this therapy.|$|E

50|$|A Sanhujoriwon is {{a private}} center which offers {{customized}} services both for mothers and their infants during the postpartum period. Until late 1998, the demand for Sanhujoriwon had exceeded its supply and the simple opening of Sanhujoriwon usually guaranteed its success. As a result, poor-quality, unqualified centers had mushroomed before 2000. While many underqualified centers have since been closed due to poor management and fire incidents, the number of Sanhujoriwons has increased gradually recently. According to a national survey in 2012, {{it was estimated that}} about 50 percent of the total female population in Korea have used Sanhujoriwon after childbirth. The services include skin therapy, <b>body</b> <b>massages,</b> and 24/7 care of newborns.

5000|$|A {{concern for}} Hardon's cause for canonization arose in early 2012 when {{documents}} concerning fellow Jesuit Donald McGuire surfaced and were {{featured in a}} story by Peter Jamison in the San Francisco Weekly. McGuire was arrested on charges of sex-abuse in 2005 and found guilty of sexually molesting boys in federal and state courts. Documents show that McGuire had previously admitted to Hardon {{that he had taken}} showers with a teenage boy from Walnut Creek, solicited <b>body</b> <b>massages</b> from him, and allowed him to read pornography in the room they shared on trips together. In spite of these admissions [...] "Hardon concluded that his fellow Jesuit's actions were 'objectively defensible,' albeit 'highly imprudent,' and told McGuire's bosses that he 'should be prudently allowed to engage in priestly ministry.'…The situation is aggravated since McGuire went on to abuse more children after suggestions to return him to ministry were heeded." ...|$|R

5000|$|This {{state of}} affairs was {{in part due to}} A.S. Neill's reverence for {{psychoanalysis}} and in particular for the sexual theories of Wilhelm Reich. Neill's abundant correspondence with Reichshows that Neill uncritically believed Reich's utopic ideas about human sexuality, and pledged to promote them with a dedication bordering on the evangelical. In his book Summerhill (1960), Neill echoes Reich's theories, e.g. promoting adolescent sexual activity, and claiming that a negative attitude towards masturbation causes juvenile delinquency.Moreover, although Neill was not a trained psychotherapist, he held amateur psychoanalytic sessions with some of his children. These sessions were designed to [...] "unblock" [...] the [...] "energies" [...] of the children. For this purpose Neill also gave <b>body</b> <b>massages</b> to the children, a technique advocated by Reich. In Summerhill, Neill gave simplistic and self-serving accounts of such psychoanalytic sessions, which suggest he was more concerned with promoting an ideology than listening to the child.|$|R
