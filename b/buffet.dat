5|$|A free <b>buffet</b> for {{servicemen}} {{was provided}} {{at the station}} during both World Wars. The Preston Station Free <b>Buffet</b> Association served free hot drinks, biscuits and buns and sold sandwiches at cost price to anyone in uniform 24 {{hours a day for}} the duration of the First World War. Four hundred women working 12-hour shifts served over 3million men between 1915 and 1919. 12million cups of tea were served between 1939 and 1945. It was funded by subscription and had its own marked crockery. The station was on a major north-south route for troops. There are three commemorative plaques related to the First World War <b>buffet</b> in the waiting room on platforms 3 and 4, the former site of WWI <b>buffet.</b> One of the drama segments of the televised Preston Passion of 2012 was set in the First World War servicemen's <b>buffet.</b> The Second World War <b>buffet</b> was located in the southern building further down platforms 5&6 (now platforms 3&4).|$|E

40|$|Based on {{conventional}} <b>buffeting</b> theories, a methodology to simulate <b>buffeting</b> response histories for long bridges {{is presented in}} the study. On the basis of specific spectra, <b>buffeting</b> loads are simulated as spatially multi-correlated random processes. Self-excited loads are expressed in terms of convolution integrals between bridge deck motion and impulse response functions, in which unknown parameters are identified from wind tunnel test. Two examples are presented to illustrate calculated <b>buffeting</b> response histories. The presented method is verified by response spectra theory and wind tunnel test. This time domain approach can be employed as an implemental tool for <b>buffeting</b> analysis of long span bridges...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The bridge <b>buffeting</b> {{response}} {{is a type}} of response varying with the time, space and frequency, in this paper, the bridge <b>buffeting</b> response analysis method based on Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and aeroelastic coupling is proposed, which can consider the contribution of effective turbulence on the bridge <b>buffeting</b> response. To test the proposed technique, a cable-stayed bridge is used to compare current analysis with the results using the traditional <b>buffeting</b> simulation method...|$|R
40|$|The <b>buffeting</b> loads {{acting on}} the wing and {{horizontal}} tail of a 1 / 4 -scale model of the X- 1 E airplane have been measured in the Langley 16 -foot transonic tunnel in the Mach number range from 0. 40 to 0. 90. When the <b>buffeting</b> loads were reduced to a nondimensional aerodynamic coefficient of <b>buffeting</b> intensity, {{it was found that}} the maximum <b>buffeting</b> intensity of the horizontal tail was about twice as large as that of the wing. Comparison of power spectra of <b>buffeting</b> loads {{acting on the}} horizontal tail of the airplaneand of the model indicated that the model horizontal tail, which was of conventional force-test-model design, responded in an entirely different mode than did the airplane. This result implied that if quantitative extrapolation of model data to flight conditions were desired a dynamically scaled model of the rearward portion of the fuselage and empennage would be required. A study of the sources of horizontal-tail <b>buffeting</b> of the model indicated that the wing wake contributed a large part of the total <b>buffeting</b> load. At one condition it was found that removal of the wing wake would reduce the <b>buffeting</b> loads on the horizontal tail to about one-third of the original value...|$|R

40|$|Characteristics of fin <b>buffeting</b> over various delta wings was {{investigated}} by measurements of fin tip acceleration, particle image velocimetry measurements, and flow visualization. For slender wings, {{there is a}} strong asymmetry with regard to the effect of fin location on the <b>buffeting</b> response, and largest response occurs for the inboard fin locations. For outboard fin locations, the <b>buffeting</b> is small, even at high angles of attack when vortex breakdown is well upstream. For inboard fin locations, the largest fin vibrations were found for breakdown locations well upstream of the fin, and when the shear layer of the breakdown region impinges on the fin. The results show that single-fin <b>buffeting</b> may be as important as twin-fin <b>buffeting.</b> For a wing with low sweep angle, vortex shedding rather than vortex breakdown may become the responsible mechanism, and large <b>buffeting</b> excitation for outboard fin locations at a specific incidence is possible. For a double-delta wing, the interaction of strake vortices with the wing flow has a major influence on the <b>buffeting</b> characteristics. Finally, it was found that a nonzero fin angle did not have much effect on the conclusions arrived in this study. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{concerns}} the extreme value of typhoon-induced non-stationary <b>buffeting</b> response of long-span bridges. The framework of non-stationary <b>buffeting</b> analysis is briefly introduced first, {{in which the}} non-stationary <b>buffeting</b> response {{is regarded as the}} summation of a time-varying mean response and a dynamic response that can be represented by a zero-mean evolutionary Gaussian process characterized by an evolutionary power spectral density (EPSD) function. The formulas for determining approximate probabilistic characteristics of extreme non-stationary responses are then derived by extending the currently-used Poisson and Vanmarcke approximations. By comparing with the Monte Carlo solution, the extended approximations for extreme value of non-stationary responses are found reliable and accurate enough. Particularly, the extended Vanmarcke approximation can give closer results to the Monte Carlo solution than the extended Poisson approximation. The extended Vanmarcke approximation is finally applied to the Stonecutters Bridge to find the extreme value of non-stationary <b>buffeting</b> response of the bridge to a strong typhoon. The results show that the extreme displacement responses of the bridge from the non-stationary <b>buffeting</b> analysis are larger than those predicted by the conventional stationary <b>buffeting</b> analysis, and therefore the non-stationary <b>buffeting</b> analysis is necessary.

40|$|Attempts {{were made}} to {{alleviate}} the <b>buffeting</b> of external fuel tanks mounted under {{the wings of a}} twin-engine Navy fighter airplane. The Mach number at which <b>buffeting</b> began was increased from 0, 529 to 0. 640 by streamlining the sway braces and by increasing the lateral rigidity of the sway brace system.

40|$|An {{approximate}} {{theory of}} <b>buffeting</b> is here presented, {{based on the}} assumption of harmonic disturbing forces. Two cases of <b>buffeting</b> are considered: namely, for a tail angle of attack greater and less than the stalling angle, respectively.

40|$|An {{enhanced}} nonstationary <b>buffeting</b> force {{model for}} calculating tropical storm (i. e., typhoon/hurricane) -induced <b>buffeting</b> response of long-span bridges is presented. The evolutionary {{power spectral density}} (EPSD) in the existing nonstationary tropical storm wind model is first revisited and enhanced by taking into consideration the recently-proposed typhoon turbulence spectra. A coherence transfer function matrix and time-dependent aerodynamic admittance function are introduced to eliminate the strip and quasi-steady theory assumptions by way of implementing wind tunnel measured span-wise and chord-wise coherence of aerodynamic forces. Finally, the non-linearity in the <b>buffeting</b> forces resulting from the variations in the instant effective angle of attack and the nonuniform span-wise profile of the mean wind speed are considered in the enhanced model. The influence of the aforementioned enhancements in the nonstationary <b>buffeting</b> force model on the tropical storm-induced <b>buffeting</b> response of long-span bridges is assessed through {{the example of the}} Stonecutters Bridge subjected to Typhoon Dujuan. The results suggest that the enhanced EPSD model of tropical storm winds, nonlinearity due to the instant effective angle of attack, and the variations in the velocity span-wise profile slightly change the <b>buffeting</b> responses. However, introduction of the span-wise coherence of <b>buffeting</b> forces increases nonstationary extreme responses by 25 - 40 %, and the time-dependent admittance function reduces the extreme responses by as much as 70 %.

5|$|Spanish {{weaponry}} {{and tactics}} differed greatly {{from that of}} the indigenous peoples. This included the Spanish use of crossbows, firearms (including muskets, arquebuses and cannon), war dogs and war horses. Horses had never been encountered by the Maya before, and their use gave the mounted conquistador an overwhelming advantage over his unmounted opponent, allowing the rider to strike with greater force while simultaneously making him less vulnerable to attack. The mounted conquistador was highly manoeuvrable and this allowed groups of combatants to quickly displace themselves across the battlefield. The horse itself was not passive, and could <b>buffet</b> the enemy combatant.|$|E

40|$|A fully coupled <b>buffeting</b> {{analysis}} of the Tsing Ma suspension bridge in Hong Kong is carried out in this paper. The features of the bridge, its natural frequencies and mode shapes from finite element analysis are first presented. Followed is {{an introduction to the}} formulation for fully coupled <b>buffeting</b> {{analysis of}} cable-supported bridges, which is featured mainly by a combination of finite element approach and pseudo-excitation method in the frequency domain. The <b>buffeting</b> response of bridge deck is then computed and compared with that from the conventional method. After the comparison, the effects from aeroelastic forces, multimodes and intermodes of vibration on deck response are examined. Finally, the <b>buffeting</b> response of the whole bridge is investigated with aerodynamic forces on not only bridge deck but also bridge towers and main cables. The results show that aeroelastic forces significantly affect the torsional response of the deck. The multimode responses are larger than single-mode responses in the vertical and torsional motions of the deck. The significant intermode responses may exist between the vibration modes of similar mode shapes or similar modal components. The <b>buffeting</b> of towers and main cables affects the lateral vibration of bridge deck and, in turn, the vibration of the bridge deck impacts the <b>buffeting</b> of the bridge towers and main cables.

5|$|Arsenal {{finished}} the league season {{without a single}} defeat and earned the tag of The Invincibles, a tag once given to the 1888–89 Preston North End team, the only previous team {{to go through a}} league season undefeated. Van Nistelrooy's missed penalty, therefore, was a crucial moment in Arsenal's season. The return fixture between the two sides at Highbury finished as a 1–1 draw and passed without incident. Manchester United finished in third place in the league table behind Chelsea but defeated Millwall in the 2004 FA Cup Final. Their run included a semi-final victory against Arsenal courtesy of a Paul Scholes goal. The following season, after Manchester United had brought Arsenal's unbeaten run to an end after 49 matches, the two clubs were involved in another incident at Old Trafford, variously dubbed the Battle of Old Trafford II, the Battle of the <b>Buffet</b> or simply the Battle of Old Trafford.|$|E
5|$|Competition {{with the}} GCR on outer {{suburban}} services on the extension line saw {{the introduction of}} more comfortable Dreadnought Stock carriages from 1910. Ninety-two of these wooden compartment carriages were built, fitted with pressurised gas lighting and steam heating. Electric lighting had replaced the gas by 1917 and electric heaters were added in 1922 to provide warmth when hauled by an electric locomotive. Later formed into rakes of five, six or seven coaches, conductor rail pick-ups on the leading and trailing guard coaches were joined by a bus line and connected to the electric locomotive to help prevent gapping. Two rakes were formed with a Pullman coach that provided a <b>buffet</b> service for a supplementary fare. The Vintage Carriages Trust has three preserved Dreadnought carriages.|$|E
5|$|In 1926, Coffin {{fell ill}} {{with a serious}} hip {{infection}} that forced her to curtail much of her physical activity and required a lengthy stay in hospital.

40|$|A {{wide range}} of {{unsteady}} phenomena of leading-edge vortices over stationary and dynamic slender delta wings were investigated. The origin, characteristics, and physical mechanisms of these unsteady phenomena and their role in <b>buffeting</b> were discussed.

40|$|Effect of a trailing-edge jet on the {{interaction}} of a leading-edge vortex with a fin and resulting fin <b>buffeting</b> was investigated in water-tunnel as well as wind-tunnel experiments. Flow visualization showed that fin-induced vortex breakdown can be delayed into the wake even for the head-on collision of the leading-edge vortex with the fin. Hence it was demonstrated that the adverse pressure gradient caused {{by the presence of}} the fin could be overcome with a deflected trailing-edge jet. Delay of vortex breakdown into the wake even for relatively small values of jet velocity ratio is possible for deflected jets, whereas the effectiveness of the jet with no deflection is very limited. <b>Buffeting</b> response of a flexible fin in wind-tunnel experiments showed that there was considerable delay of the onset of <b>buffeting</b> to higher angles of attack with increasing jet momentum for β= 30 and 45 deg. Depending on the fin location with respect to the leading-edge vortex, it was possible to shift the <b>buffeting</b> envelope as much as 12 deg in incidence of the wing. Experiments with varying wing sweep angle showed that jet blowing was as effective in attenuating fin <b>buffeting</b> for less slender wings. Wind-tunnel experiments also showed that the nozzle geometry is very important and causes very different <b>buffeting</b> envelopes for the same momentum coefficient...|$|R

5|$|Another {{feature of}} the wing was its washout. The {{trailing}} edge of the wing twisted slightly upward along its span, the angle of incidence decreasing from +2° at its root to -½° at its tip. This caused the wing roots to stall before the tips, reducing tip-stall that could otherwise {{have resulted in a}} wing drop, often leading to a spin. As the wing roots started to stall, the separating air stream started to <b>buffet</b> (vibrate) the aircraft, warning the pilot, and hence allowing even relatively inexperienced pilots to fly the aircraft to the limits of its performance. This washout was first featured in the wing of the Type 224 and became a consistent feature in subsequent designs leading to the Spitfire. The complexity of the wing design, especially the precision required to manufacture the vital spar and leading-edge structures, at first caused some major hold-ups in the production of the Spitfire. The problems increased when the work was put out to subcontractors, most of whom had never dealt with metal-structured, high-speed aircraft. By June 1939, most of these problems had been resolved, and production was no longer held up by a lack of wings.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, the {{development}} and improvement of the London Underground, meant that Victoria could not compete as a cross-London service. GNR trains stopped running on 1 October 1907, with Midland ones following on June the next year. The GWR ceased to use the station for scheduled services on 21 March 1915, partly due to World War I {{in addition to the}} new Underground lines. Victoria was used as the main station for drafted soldiers, and those returning from action in the war. By the middle of the war, the station served twelve trains a day running between Victoria and Folkestone, with additional trains serving Dover. The station was regularly served with a voluntary <b>buffet</b> for departing soldiers, who served up to 4,000 men a day. Victoria itself did not suffer significant damage during the war, but a section of Grosvenor Bridge was destroyed after an anti-aircraft shell struck a gas main underneath it.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Buffeting</b> {{was another}} early {{aerodynamic}} problem. It {{was difficult to}} distinguish from compressibility as both were reported by test pilots as [...] "tail shake". <b>Buffeting</b> came about from airflow disturbances ahead of the tail; the airplane would shake at high speed. Leading edge wing slots were tried as were combinations of filleting between the wing, cockpit and engine nacelles. Air tunnel test number 15 solved the <b>buffeting</b> completely and its fillet solution was fitted to every subsequent P-38 airframe. Fillet kits were sent out to every squadron flying Lightnings. The problem was traced to a 40% increase in air speed at the wing-fuselage junction where the thickness/chord ratio was highest. An airspeed of [...] at [...] could push airflow at the wing-fuselage junction close to the speed of sound. Filleting solved the <b>buffeting</b> problem for the P-38E and later models.|$|R
