40|$|Many of today's radiofrequency-emitting {{devices in}} telecommunication, telemedicine, {{transportation}} safety, and security/military applications use the millimeter-wave (MMW) band (30 - 300 GHz). To evaluate the biological safety and possible applications of this radiofrequency band for neuroscience and neurology, we {{have investigated the}} physiological effects of low-intensity 60 GHz electromagnetic irradiation on individual neurons in the leech midbody ganglia. We applied incident power densities of 1, 2, and 4 mW/cm^ 2 to the whole ganglion {{for a period of}} 1 minute, while recording the action potential with a standard sharp-electrode electrophysiology setup. For comparison, the recognized U. S. safe exposure limit is 1 mW/cm^ 2 for 6 minutes. During the exposure to MMWs and gradual <b>bath</b> <b>heating</b> at a rate of 0. 04 ºC/sec (2. 4 ºC/min), the ganglionic neurons exhibited similar dose-dependent hyperpolarization of the plasma membrane and decrease in the action potential amplitude. However, narrowing of the action potential half-width during MMW irradiation at 4 mW/cm^ 2 was 5 times more pronounced, as compared to equivalent <b>bath</b> <b>heating</b> of 0. 6 ºC. Even more dramatic difference in the effects of MMW irradiation and <b>bath</b> <b>heating</b> was on the firing rate, which was suppressed at all applied MMW power densities and was increased in a dose-dependent manner during gradual <b>bath</b> <b>heating.</b> The mechanism of enhanced narrowing of action potentials and suppressed firing by MMW irradiation, as compared to gradual <b>bath</b> <b>heating,</b> is hypothesized to involve specific coupling of MMW energy with the neuronal plasma membrane...|$|E

LF and GF surimi exhibited higher endogenous proteolytic activity than BS and TB.

The effect of protective agents (10 % w/w) of lactose, sodium caseinate and lactose:sodium caseinate (3 : 1) was also evaluated. The thermal inactivation kinetics parameters in convective air drying and isothermal water <b>bath</b> <b>heating</b> were determined and compared. The {{results showed that the}} final temperature attained by the droplet affected the survival of the bacteria significantly, however, most of the bacterial death occurred in early stage of drying while evaporative cooling kept the drop temperature relatively low.

At lower droplet temperatures (= 55 °C) the rate of change in droplet moisture content had much stronger effect on the bacterial survival. Lactose and sodium caseinate, as protective agents, enhanced the survival of bacterial cells significantly at all the test conditions. The lactose:sodium caseinate (3 : 1) mixture synergistically enhanced the survival of the bacterial cultures.
