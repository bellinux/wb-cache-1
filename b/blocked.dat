5|$|The storm {{passed to}} the south of most of the Greater Antilles, though its outer rain bands crossed many of the islands, and {{delivered}} hurricane force winds to Jamaica. Puerto Rico, Cuba, and the Cayman Islands were mostly spared, though Hurricane Dean passed 50 to 60mi (80 to 95km) south of Jamaica as a Category4 hurricane. In Jamaica the rain caused flooding on {{the eastern side of the}} island and landslides on the northeast end. At least two direct deaths were confirmed. Over 1,500 roofs were lost, primarily to the hurricane force winds, and 1,582 of the 3,127 damaged homes were uninhabitable. Landslides and fallen trees <b>blocked</b> hundreds of roads, particularly in the rural northeast region. As in the Lesser Antilles, Jamaica suffered severe damage to its agricultural sector. Forty percent of the sugarcane crop, 80 to 100% of the banana crop, 75% of the coffee trees under three years old, and 20% of the top layer of the cocoa crop were lost. Hurricane Dean affected 248 roads, including 186 that were blocked: 10 were <b>blocked</b> in the Kingston metropolitan region, 14 sections were <b>blocked</b> in St. Andrew, 43 roads were <b>blocked</b> in St. Catherine, eight roads were <b>blocked</b> in the Western Region (Saint James, Hanover, Westmoreland, and Trelawny), and 110 roads were <b>blocked</b> in the Northeast region.|$|E

He was also second on the team with 105 assists. Young had the highest rebounding average of any Princeton player since 1978 and was also the thirteenth player in school history to record 100 assists in a season. For his college basketball career, Young accumulated 801 points, 350 rebounds, and 142 blocks. His best game performances included a 20-point game on the road against the 11th-ranked Kansas Jayhawks, a career-high 30 points against Harvard, and a school record of nine <b>blocked</b> shots against the Ohio Bobcats.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Entity Resolution (ER) is {{the problem}} of {{identifying}} which records in a database refer to the same real-world entity. An exhaustive ER process involves computing the similarities between pairs of records, which can be very expensive for large datasets. Various <b>blocking</b> techniques can be used to enhance the performance of ER by dividing the records into <b>blocks</b> in multiple ways and only comparing records within the same <b>block.</b> However, most <b>blocking</b> techniques process <b>blocks</b> separately and do not exploit the results of other <b>blocks.</b> In this paper, we propose an iterative <b>blocking</b> framework where the ER results of <b>blocks</b> are reflected to subsequently processed <b>blocks.</b> <b>Blocks</b> are now iteratively processed until no <b>block</b> contains any more matching records. Compared to simple <b>blocking,</b> iterative <b>blocking</b> may achieve higher accuracy because reflecting the ER results of <b>blocks</b> to other <b>blocks</b> may generate additional record matches. Iterative <b>blocking</b> may also be more efficient because processing a <b>block</b> now saves the processing time for other <b>blocks.</b> We implement a scalable iterative <b>blocking</b> system and demonstrate that iterative <b>blocking</b> is more accurate and efficient than <b>blocking,</b> especially for large datasets.
