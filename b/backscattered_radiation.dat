40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the dose enhancement to soft tissue due to <b>backscatter</b> <b>radiation</b> near metal interfaces during head and neck radiotherapy. The influence of titanium-mandibular plate with the screws on radiation dose was tested on four real bones from mandible with the metal and screws fixed. Radiochromic films were used for dosimetry. The bone and metal were inserted through the film at the center symmetrically. This was then placed in a small jig (7 cm × 7 cm × 10 cm) to hold the film vertically straight. The polymer granules (tissue-equivalent) were placed around the film for homogeneous scatter medium. The film was irradiated with 6 MV X-rays for 200 monitor units in Trilogy linear accelerator for 10 cm × 10 cm field size with source to axis distance of 100 cm at 5 cm. A single film was also irradiated without any bone and metal interface for reference data. The absolute dose and the vertical dose profile were measured from the film. There was 10 % dose enhancement due to the <b>backscatter</b> <b>radiation</b> just adjacent to the metal-bone interface for all the materials. The extent of the backscatter effect was up to 4 mm. There is significant higher dose enhancement in the soft tissue/skin due to the <b>backscatter</b> <b>radiation</b> from the metallic components in the treatment region...|$|R

It {{is based on a}} high-resolution pixelated detector array with a semi-cylindrical multi-pinhole tungsten collimator and is designed to fit inside a compact rectal probe, and is able to resolve the 3 D position of the source with a maximum error of 1. 5 mm. This paper presents an evaluation of the additional dose that will be delivered to the patient as a result of <b>backscatter</b> <b>radiation</b> from the collimator. Monte Carlo simulations of planar and cylindrical collimators embedded in a tissue-equivalent phantom were performed using Geant 4, with an 192 Ir source placed at two different source-collimator distances. The planar configuration was replicated experimentally to validate the simulations, with a MOSkin dosimetry probe used to measure dose at three distances from the collimator. For the cylindrical collimator simulation, backscatter dose enhancement was calculated as a function of axial and azimuthal displacement, and dose distribution maps were generated at three distances from the collimator surface. Although significant backscatter dose enhancement was observed for both geometries immediately adjacent to the collimator, simulations and experiments indicate that backscatter dose is negligible at distances beyond 1 mm from the collimator. Since HDR BrachyView is enclosed within a 1 mm thick tissue-equivalent plastic shell, all <b>backscatter</b> <b>radiation</b> resulting from its use will therefore be absorbed before reaching the rectal wall or other tissues...|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{uncertainties}} for climate change {{is the importance of}} aerosol direct and indirect effects. The uncertainties were stressed in the 4th Assessment Report by the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC). The large diversity of aerosol optical properties, including their sources and the meteorological processes they are subjected to, requires vertically resolved measurements, which can only be performed with routine lidar observations. Networks of aerosol lidars such as the European Aerosol Research Lidar Network (EARLINET) [...] were established to investigate aerosol properties, along with transport and modification phenomena, in a coherent way on a regional to continental scale. As of 2015, EARLINET consists of 27 lidar stations hosting more than 44000 profiles.Elastic-backscatter lidars (EBL) have been used extensively to investigate clouds and aerosol layers since the 1960s. EBLs detect the total backscattered signal (particle and molecular contributions). Profiles of the extinction coefficient have to be estimated using the molecular signal and the assumption of a conditionally “constant” (roughly speaking) aerosol extinction to backscatter ratio, called the lidar ratio. The main equation involved, known as the lidar equation is:where P(r) is the power of the <b>backscattered</b> <b>radiation</b> received by the lidar telescope in distance r, E is transmitted laser-pulse energy, L is the lidar constant summarizing its optical and detection characteristics, O(r) is the overlap function, and [...] and [...] are the aerosol/molecular backscatter- and extinction coefficient respectively. Molecular backscatter and extinction can be derived by meteorological data, therefore the only unknowns in the lidar equation are [...] and [...] However the lidar ratio, as an intensive aerosol property, strongly depends on the size, morphology and chemical composition of the particles and is highly variable with respect to height, which often risks the extinction profile credibility. The process for calculating backscatter- and extinction coefficient profiles from EBL returns is widely known as the Klett method [...] and was originally formalised by Hitschfeld and Bordan in 1954. [...] The aforementioned defect on estimating extinction profiles is overcome by the Raman (inelastic) backscatter lidar by additionally measuring the inelastic backscatter by nitrogen and/or oxygen molecules. This technique provides a direct calculation of the extinction coefficient, eliminating the need for a lidar ratio assumption since any additional terms involved (e.g. the molecular extinction coefficient) are handled by meteorological (e.g. radiosoundings) and standard-atmosphere data. After some mathematical manipulations of the lidar equation the extinction-related equation reads:where the subscripts “inc” and “sca” refer to the incident laser light and the shifted backscattered light respectively, N is the nitrogen / oxygen molecule number density and [...] is the Ångström exponent. A drawback of this method is the presence of a derivative in the resulting extinction coefficient formula (...) which results in potential numerical instability, introducing an active field of research.|$|E

40|$|Scattered {{radiation}} {{is the main}} source of radiation dose to radiation workers when working with x-ray radiography. When radiation from an industrial x-ray machine collides with the walls of an enclosure, some {{radiation is}} back-scattered back within the enclosure. The scattered radiation is due to, mainly, Compton interaction and fluorescence characteristics radiation following photoelectric interactions. The reduction of the <b>backscattered</b> <b>radiation</b> was accomplished by appropriate selection of a material to line the walls on which the primary radiation is incident and by designing a beam catcher that is capable of absorbing significant portion of the scattered radiation. <b>Backscattered</b> <b>radiation</b> from commercially available materials was investigated. These materials include lead, concrete, aluminum and iron. The primary radiation from an x-ray machine was directed normally on the material and the <b>backscattered</b> <b>radiation</b> was measured by using sensitive ionization chamber. Measurements were made at different angles between incident and <b>backscattered</b> <b>radiation</b> and at several x-ray tube voltages ranged from 70 kVp to 110 kVp. It was found that iron produced the least amount of <b>backscattered</b> <b>radiation</b> that was about 50 - 60 % of that of lead. On the other hand concrete and aluminum produced about 35 % of that of lead. The significant reduction of scattered radiation by iron suggests that lead, which is currently used as a primary shield in most installations, should be located on walls from outside the enclosure and the walls should be lined from inside with iron.

However, for the widespread use of these tags to become reality, much basic research is needed to reduce the cost, increase the range, and increase the reliability of the RF tag. This research seeks to enhance the performance of passive RF tags by developing a series of tests, or radio assay, to measure the following: the performance of RF tag antennas as a function of antenna material and manufacturing technique and the antenna performance when attached to various materials. The radio assay experiments are designed for RF tag antennas that operate in the far field of the tag reader and communicate using modulated <b>backscatter</b> <b>radiation</b> at 915 MHz. Three flexible, folded dipoles, printed on plastic substrates, were measured in the radio assay experiments. The results of the experiments include the following: the antenna gain penalty (relative to a baseline antenna) for each antenna material and manufacturing technique, the antenna gain penalty (relative to the free space antenna gain) due to material losses when the tag antenna is attached to an object, and the benefits (in terms of antenna gain) of tuning each tag antenna to the material to which it is attached. The results are presented in a form to aid RF engineers in the design of RF tag system link budgets. M. S. Committee Chair: Dr. Gregory D. Durgin; Committee Member: Dr. Andrew F.
