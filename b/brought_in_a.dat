5|$|At {{the start}} of 1974, the LCL had {{undertaken}} some progressive reforms. They <b>brought</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> less conservative membership at the grassroots level, although the old guard was still prominent in parliamentary roles. They tried to broach the possibility of reintegrating the LM. Wilson and the new {{executive director of the}} LCL, John Vial were at the forefront, but the LM was optimistic about its future and refused unless the LCL changed leaders and allowed for explicitly separate urban and rural factions, which did not happen.|$|E
5|$|Bute {{responded by}} putting {{commercial}} pressure on shipping companies {{to abandon the}} Glamorganshire Canal and using his feudal rights to force shippers to move their wharfs to his docks. His efforts paid off and although trade through the docks only came to 8,000 tons in 1839, they then rose quickly, reaching 827,000 tons by 1849. Between 1841 and 1848 the docks <b>brought</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> gross income of just under £68,000, a relatively disappointing figure compared {{to the size of}} the investment. Successive marquesses would find themselves under huge pressure to continue investing and expanding in the docks and subsequent phases of construction over the coming decades.|$|E
5|$|From the {{day that}} Speaker arrived in Cleveland, manager Lee Fohl rarely made an {{important}} move without consulting him. George Uhle recalled an incident from 1919 during his rookie year with the Indians. Speaker often signaled to Fohl when he thought that a pitcher should be brought in from the bullpen. One day, Fohl misread Speaker's signal and <b>brought</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> different pitcher than Speaker had intended. To avoid the appearance of overruling his manager, Speaker let the change stand. Pitcher Fritz Coumbe lost the game, Fohl resigned that night and Speaker became manager. Uhle said that Speaker felt bad for contributing to Fohl's departure.|$|E

5|$|Half-Life: Opposing Force is an {{expansion}} pack for Valve Software's science fiction first-person shooter video game Half-Life. The game {{was developed by}} Gearbox Software and Valve Corporation and published by Sierra Entertainment on November 19, 1999. Opposing Force is the first expansion for Half-Life and was first announced in April 1999. Randy Pitchford, the lead designer on the game, later noted that he believed Gearbox was selected to develop Opposing Force because Valve wanted to concentrate on their future projects. Over the course of development, Gearbox <b>brought</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> variety of outside talent from {{other areas of the}} video games industry to help bolster various aspects of design.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, Indonesia has <b>brought</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{fishing and}} export ban {{as it has}} {{realized}} that manta ray tourism is more economically beneficial than allowing the fish to be killed. A dead manta is worth $40 to $500 while manta ray tourism can bring in $1 million during {{the life of a}} single manta ray. Indonesia has 5.8 million square kilometers (2.2 million square miles) of ocean and this is now the world's largest sanctuary for manta rays.|$|E
5|$|In direct {{opposition}} to the immense productivity that she displayed in the early 1860s, Dickinson wrote fewer poems in 1866. Beset with personal loss as well as loss of domestic help, Dickinson {{may have been too}} overcome to keep up her previous level of writing. Carlo died during this time after providing sixteen years of companionship; Dickinson never owned another dog. Although the household servant of nine years, Margaret O Brien, had married and left the Homestead that same year, it was not until 1869 that her family <b>brought</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> permanent household servant, Margaret Maher, to replace the old one. Emily once again was responsible for chores, including the baking, at which she excelled.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1860s and 1870s, Wallace was very {{concerned}} about the financial security of his family. While he was in the Malay Archipelago, the sale of specimens had <b>brought</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> considerable amount of money, which had been carefully invested by the agent who sold the specimens for Wallace. However, on his return to the UK, Wallace made a series of bad investments in railways and mines that squandered most of the money, and he found himself badly in need of the proceeds from the publication of The Malay Archipelago.|$|E
5|$|The film {{stayed at}} the top {{position}} in its second weekend, dropping only 38% and grossing another $71,417,527, while averaging $19,755.89 per theater. At the time, this was the highest grossing second weekend of any film. During its second weekend, the film crossed the $200 million mark on its ninth day of release, also a record at the time. At {{the end of its}} second weekend, the film <b>brought</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> 10-day total of $223,040,031.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea was}} first {{discussed}} in 2000. To make the game {{feel like a}} film, Revolution <b>brought</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> cinematic consultant, Bob Keen, who made sure the game conveyed emotions and atmosphere appropriate for each scene. The game was originally planned to have similar cartoon-quality visuals as its prequels, but the developers decided to aim at a style similar to Japanese animated films. Unlike the first two Broken Sword games, which used the Virtual Theatre engine, The Sleeping Dragon was built with the RenderWare engine. The game's music was composed by Ben McCullough, and Rolf Saxon returned to voice George Stobbart.|$|E

5|$|Unable to find wind {{machines}} {{powerful enough}} to mimic hurricane-force winds, Sertner <b>brought</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> jet engine to aim at the actors and props during necessary scenes. Three dimensional storyboards, called animatics, were used to allow the filmmakers {{to see what a}} scene would look like before shooting, using a digital version of the actors. The various weather scenes blended together stock footage of real natural disasters with the computer-generated shots, with care taken to match up the details of the various scenes.|$|E
5|$|Undone is {{the third}} studio album by Christian rock band, MercyMe. It was {{produced}} by Pete Kipley and released on April 20, 2004 on INO Records. Following the success of MercyMe's previous studio efforts, they were given significantly more resources with which to develop the album and <b>brought</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> sixth member, guitarist Barry Graul. Unlike the band's previous songwriting style, which was to write the lyrics first, they wrote the music for the songs on the album before writing the lyrics. The album has a pop rock and adult contemporary sound, while the lyrics are personal and convey Christian themes.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with those}} trivial messages, gandingans {{were also used}} in more seriously matters when {{signaling}} to others of imminent danger. During martial law, gandingans were used to warn villagers of incoming Marcos’ soldiers. Every time the villagers received the signal, they would disappear leaving the soldiers aloof until the soldiers themselves <b>brought</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> translator who told them, the gandingan {{was responsible for the}} scurry. So they arrested the gandingan player. A similar story talks about a brother of a man who stole someone’s carabao. In order to keep his brother from getting arrested, the brother set up a gandingan up in a tree and would clang it every time the police arrived to warn his brother to leave their house. But like Marcos’ soldiers, the police bought a translator and so they were finally able to arrest the theft for stealing and the brother on the gandingan for obstruction of justice.|$|E

5|$|In 1992, the IMA hosted The William S. Paley Collection, a {{traveling}} exhibition {{organized by the}} Museum of Modern Art that included Impressionist, Post-Impressionist, and modern pieces collected by the late CBS news chairman William S. Paley. The exhibit helped establish the IMA as a prominent museum venue in the Midwest and <b>brought</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> record-setting 60,837 visitors. In 2001, the IMA collaborated with the Armory Museum in Moscow to organize Gifts to the Tsars, 1500–1700: Treasures from the Kremlin. The show helped the IMA form partnerships with local arts organizations, gain international exposure, and attracted a record 70,704 visitors. Another important exhibit {{to travel to the}} IMA was Roman Art from the Louvre, which attracted 106,002 visitors during its 2008 run. The exhibition featured 184 mosaics, frescoes, statues, marble reliefs, and vessels loaned from the permanent collection of the Louvre in Paris, France. It was the largest collection ever loaned from the Louvre to date, and only stopped in three U.S. cities before returning to France.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, O'Donnell and Timken began {{talks with}} the Coast Guard Museum Association about selling the station to a {{third-party}} investor associated with the Association. The sale was originally to be effective {{at the end of}} 2014, but was delayed because the Redevelopment Agency never issued a formal certificate of completion for the 1975 sale and renovations. Since the Agency was dissolved in 2008, the City Council issued the certificate in early January 2015, allowing the sale the proceed. On January 12, the Council released the station from the 1960s urban renewal plan as part of an agreement with O'Donnell and Timken to ease the sale process. The new agreement also included stipulations for historic preservation of the building, and allowed – but not required – its continued use as a train station. On January 29, 2015, Union Station Development sold the station to the New London RR Company – a holding company owned by James Coleman Jr., chairman of the Association – for $3 million. Coleman <b>brought</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> restaurant serving locally sourced food for the first floor, and intends to renovate the second floor for use by museum-related tenants.|$|E

In United States dollars, its opening weekend was an all-time record $38.3million, ahead of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix ($33.5million). The film also achieved the largest single-day gross {{on its first}} Saturday and the largest opening week with $57.6million. The film made a total of £73.1million ($117.2million) at the United Kingdom box office, marking the fifth highest-grossing film. It also is the highest-grossing film of 2011 and highest-grossing Harry Potter film.|$|E
