50|$|Founder Daniel Lee {{worked for}} his family's {{pharmacy}} business until 1999, {{when he decided}} to form his own company. His father owned a chain <b>of</b> <b>chemists</b> <b>shops</b> in Leeds. He thought of the idea to found an Internet mail-order pharmacy in 1997 after a report by the NHS about its initiative to deliver prescriptions to patients more efficiently. Although {{at the time it was}} not legal to sell prescriptions by mail in the UK, Lee sold his apartment for £100,000 in order to put the money into the creation of Pharmacy2u.co.uk, basing his shipping out of his father's pharmacy business. The site went live in November 1999, and used a courier service in order to provide a legal, safer service for the website's customers. Julian Harrison from Andersen Consulting became a director in 2000.|$|R

40|$|A {{brief summary}} of the five Acts {{concerned}} with the sale of poisons and the dispensing of prescriptions of medical practitioners is given. This outlines the legal position of persons who are permitted to keep "open shop" and to compound and dispense prescriptions. The number <b>of</b> pharmaceutical <b>chemists</b> on the statutory Register is just over 2, 000, of whom approximately one third are women. Recruitment {{in recent years has}} been insufficient to maintain the number on the Register. Approximately 86 per cent of active pharmacists work in retail shops or as locums. The number <b>of</b> retail <b>chemist</b> <b>shops</b> is just under 1, 300 and in most of these only one pharmacist is engaged. About 3, 000 people in all are working in retail <b>chemist</b> <b>shops.</b> The average shop in· Dublin and in the four provinces has one proprietor with two assistants.

The main aim of the thesis is to demonstrate the application of metodology MMDIS in practice and also the chosen dimensions of multidimensional princip in the GAN phase on the conceptual level using the example <b>of</b> particular <b>chemist's</b> <b>shop.</b> Thanks to the information from a chemist the aim was achieved. The modells of categories, processes and examples of using have been created. The main contribution of the thesis is the implementation of GAN in the chosen dimensions in the particular <b>chemist's</b> <b>shop.</b> The results can be used also for other <b>chemist's</b> <b>shops</b> thanks to the conceptual level of analysis and design. The thesis consists of tree main parts. The first part deals with the metodology and consecutive terms. The second part deals with the description of MMDIS metodology and life cycle IS/ICT.

50|$|The Pharmacy Gallery {{was based}} around a {{recreation}} of Perks and Llewellyn’s Pharmacy, which {{stood in the}} High Street until the 1960s, on a site now occupied by Poundland. John Perks started the chemist business in 1790. It passed through the family until 1878, when the then owner Samuel Perks went into partnership with Charles Llewellyn. Samuel died in 1878 and Charles 1893, the last two family links for the business name. The shop {{was taken over by}} Richard Lewis the then Shop Manager in 1906. The last shop owner was his daughter, Violet Lewis, a trained pharmacist who ran the business from 1930 to 1961. Violet sold the shop site to developers; she however saved the historic interior <b>of</b> the <b>chemist</b> <b>shop</b> which dated back to 1790, re-housing it in a special annex built onto her home. She opened the <b>chemist</b> <b>shop</b> to local schools and groups. By the 1980s, Violet was quite elderly. The Hertfordshire Medical and Pharmaceutical Trust was formed by a group of local people to raise funds to find a permanent home for the <b>chemist</b> <b>shop.</b> It will be redisplayed in the new Museum of North Hertfordshire.|$|R
60|$|Tavernake made no {{immediate}} reply. Mr. Dowling was shortsighted, {{and in any}} case it would never have occurred to him to associate nervousness, or any form of emotion, with his responsible manager. The beautiful lady leaned back in her chair. Her lips were parted in a slight but very curious smile, her fingers supported her cheek, her eyelids were contracted as she looked into his face. Tavernake felt that their recognition was mutual. Once more he was back again in the tragic atmosphere <b>of</b> that <b>chemist's</b> <b>shop,</b> with Beatrice, half fainting, in his arms, the beautiful lady turned to stone. It was an odd tableau, that, so vividly imprinted upon his memory that it was there before him at this very moment. There was mystery in this woman's eyes, mystery and something else.|$|R
60|$|It was {{a quarter}} past eleven and the theatres were {{disgorging}} their usual nightly crowds. The most human thoroughfare {{in any of}} the world's great cities was at its best and brightest. Everywhere commissionaires were blowing their whistles, the streets were thronged with slowly-moving vehicles, the pavements were stirring with life. The little crowd which had gathered in front <b>of</b> the <b>chemist's</b> <b>shop</b> was swept away. After all, none of them knew exactly what they had been waiting for. There was a rumor that a woman had fainted or had met with an accident. Certainly she had been carried into the shop and into the inner room, the door of which was still closed. A few passers-by had gathered together and stared and waited for a few minutes, but had finally lost interest and melted away. A human thoroughfare, this, indeed, one of the pulses of the great city beating time night and day to the tragedies <b>of</b> life. The <b>chemist's</b> assistant, with impassive features, was serving a couple of casual customers from behind the counter. Only a few yards away, beyond the closed door, the chemist himself and a hastily summoned doctor fought with Death for the body of the girl who lay upon the floor, faint moans coming every now and then from her blue lips.|$|R
5000|$|George Griffenhagen, {{pharmacist}} {{and acting}} {{curator of the}} Smithsonian Institution, did extensive research into {{the evolution of the}} show globe and laid to rest many of the more unusual stories about the origin of the show globe. [...] He thought that the show globe appeared when the apothecaries and alchemists merged their professions during the mid 16th to mid 17th century. In England in the mid 1550s, just as physicians competed against apothecaries, the apothecaries, who delivered surgical services along with compounding and dispensing herbal medicines, competed with chemists and druggists. Druggists bought drugs in bulk and sold them as merchants (not as medical practitioners like the apothecaries); while chemists, who were derived from alchemists, prepared and sold chemical preparations used for medicinal purposes, like mercurials.To attract attention to themselves and to symbolize the mystery and art of their profession these chemists displayed show globes with solutions of colored chemicals. Apothecaries and physicians were usually considered more conservative in their practice before the 18th century and often restricted themselves to non-chemical drugs using material of largely botanical origins. Most historians today feel the show globe began as a symbol <b>of</b> the <b>chemist's</b> <b>shop.</b> Eventually the apothecaries began to use chemical remedies, and also adopted the globe as their symbol.|$|R
500|$|A marble {{portrait}} bust of Bewick {{was commissioned}} from Edward Hodges Baily in 1825 by the Literary and Philosophical Society, {{of which there}} are several copies beside the one still at the Society itself. According to Jenny Uglow, his recent biographer, when he came to sit for the sculptor, he “stoutly refused to be portrayed in a toga. Instead he wore his ordinary coat and waistcoat with neckcloth and ruffled shirt, and even asked for some of his smallpox scars to be shown." [...] Baily was so taken with him that he presented Bewick with a plaster model of the finished bust. A bronze copy now rests in a niche of the building that replaced his workshop in the churchyard of Saint Nicholas (see above) and still another is at the British Museum. There is also a full length statue of him at the top left <b>of</b> the former <b>chemist's</b> <b>shop</b> designed by M.V.Treleaven at 45 Northumberland Street in the city.|$|R
60|$|I {{have tried}} to make you picture him, time after time, as the young man <b>of</b> the Wimblehurst <b>chemist's</b> <b>shop,</b> as the shabby {{assistant}} in Tottenham Court Road, as the adventurer of {{the early days of}} Tono-Bungay, as the confident, preposterous plutocrat. And now I have to tell of him strangely changed under the shadow of oncoming death, with his skin lax and yellow and glistening with sweat, his eyes large and glassy, his countenance unfamiliar through the growth of a beard, his nose pinched and thin. Never had he looked so small as now. And he talked to me in a whispering, strained voice of great issues, of why his life had been, and whither he was going. Poor little man! that last phase is, as it were, disconnected from all the other phases. It was as if he crawled out from the ruins of his career, and looked about him before he died. For he had quite clear-minded states in the intervals of his delirium.|$|R
