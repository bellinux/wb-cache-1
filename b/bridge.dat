5|$|A {{more modern}} and {{convenient}} competing <b>bridge</b> opened nearby at Chelsea <b>Bridge</b> in 1858, and usage of Battersea <b>Bridge</b> fell sharply. There were serious public {{concerns about the}} safety of the <b>bridge</b> by this time, after an 1844 incident in which a woman was murdered on the <b>bridge</b> in view of one of the toll collectors, who did not intervene because both parties had paid their fares.|$|E
5|$|A new <b>bridge,</b> the Greenville <b>Bridge,</b> {{was built}} as a {{replacement}} further downriver from the sharp bend. It opened in 2010. In 2011, work began to remove the Benjamin G. Humphreys <b>Bridge.</b>|$|E
5|$|A wooden <b>bridge</b> {{was built}} over the Kennet at Newbury in 1726, {{replaced}} in stone between 1769 and 1772 by James Clarke, and {{now known as the}} Town <b>Bridge</b> or Water <b>Bridge.</b> As there is no tow path, a line to haul the barge had to be floated under the <b>bridge</b> and then re-attached to the horse where the tow path resumed.|$|E

5|$|Abbotsford <b>Bridge</b> is a steel Allan truss-type <b>bridge</b> {{spanning}} the Murray River between Curlwaa, New South Wales, and Yelta, Victoria. It {{is the only}} remaining steel truss <b>bridge</b> with a lift span that crosses the Murray. Opened in 1928, the <b>bridge</b> was built by the New South Wales (NSW) Department of Public Works and was designed by Percy Allan. It was the second last lift-span <b>bridge</b> to be built over the river, the last being the Nyah <b>Bridge,</b> which opened in 1941.|$|E
5|$|According to the Prose Edda, the <b>bridge</b> ends {{in heaven}} at Himinbjörg, the {{residence}} of the god Heimdallr, who guards it from the jötnar. The bridge's destruction during Ragnarök {{by the forces of}} Muspell is foretold. Scholars have proposed that the <b>bridge</b> may have originally represented the Milky Way and have noted parallels between the <b>bridge</b> and another <b>bridge</b> in Norse mythology, Gjallarbrú.|$|E
5|$|After the 1903 {{destruction}} of the original wooden <b>bridge</b> at Belvidere, plans to construct another <b>bridge</b> started immediately. After the storm, the substructure of the crossing had survived the strong storm. The <b>bridge</b> corporation set a completion date, August 17, 1904, which was {{the day that the}} Farmer's Picnic was held in Belvidere. However, the contractor of which they hired to reconstruct the <b>bridge,</b> the New Jersey <b>Bridge</b> Company of Manasquan, New Jersey, believed that the new <b>bridge</b> would need new abutments and piers to be completed by that time, instead of using the old wooden bridge's piers. The three piers from the wooden <b>bridge</b> were used, and would require them to be heightened to be above any high flood waters. On June 3, 1904, the <b>bridge</b> construction began on a barge in the river, with promises to be complete by the set date of August 17. On August 17, the <b>bridge</b> was not complete, but usable, that when the Farmer's Picnic (the predecessor to the Warren County Fair, occurred, people were allowed to cross a majority of the <b>bridge.</b> The picnic itself was a complete success, attracting over 15,000 people, most of which walked the <b>bridge.</b>|$|E

5|$|Although the <b>bridge</b> {{remained}} in service for another 21 {{years as a}} free crossing, the Delaware River Joint Toll <b>Bridge</b> Commission constructed a brand new <b>bridge</b> at the Portland-Columbia. The new toll <b>bridge</b> was constructed in 1953 for $4 million (1953 USD, equal to $ today), but the toll was only one quarter (equal to $ today), like the former price of the Darlington's <b>Bridge.</b> Darlington, who had retired from his job in Orange in 1950, was alive and was in disbelief. The next April, the Toll <b>Bridge</b> Commission went ahead and dismantled the <b>bridge</b> made useful by Darlington, which was fought by several legal actions. The <b>bridge</b> ceased operations on April 3, 1954, being demolished soon after. The covered <b>bridge</b> at Columbia was destroyed during Hurricane Diane the next August. Just before the demolishing of the Darlington's <b>Bridge,</b> the approach on the New Jersey side had been renumbered to State Highway Route 163, which remains in condition from when the <b>bridge</b> was in use.|$|E
5|$|An {{agreement}} was reached in 1984 between the Grand County Commission and the Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT) to balance the conflicting public demands to retire and preserve the aging <b>bridge.</b> As part of this agreement, UDOT would commission a new <b>bridge</b> and once finished, transfer ownership of the original <b>bridge</b> back to Grand County. Grand County agreed to petition to have the <b>bridge</b> {{be included in the}} National Register of Historic Places, assume maintenance and guarantee the <b>bridge</b> would be preserved. The nomination was approved and the <b>bridge</b> was added to the National Register of Historic Places on July 12, 1984. In 1988, the replacement <b>bridge</b> was completed, and the title deed to the Dewey <b>Bridge</b> was handed over to the county in 1989. Grand County completed a restoration project in 2000.|$|E
5|$|Around 1770 {{the neoclassical}} {{architect}} Robert Adam designed Pulteney <b>Bridge,</b> a three-arched <b>bridge</b> spanning the Avon. He used as his prototype an original, but unused, design by Andrea Palladio for the Rialto <b>Bridge</b> in Venice. Thus, Pulteney <b>Bridge</b> became {{not just a}} means of crossing the river, but also a shopping arcade. Along with the Rialto <b>Bridge,</b> {{is one of the}} very few surviving bridges in Europe to serve this dual purpose. It has been substantially altered since it was built. The <b>bridge</b> was named after Frances and William Pulteney, the owners of the Bathwick estate for which the <b>bridge</b> provided a link to the rest of Bath.|$|E

5|$|Construction officially {{began in}} October 2013, {{with the new}} spans being built {{to the north of}} the {{existing}} <b>bridge.</b> The new <b>bridge</b> will connect to the existing highway approaches of I-87 and I-287 on both river banks. The northbound/westbound span opened on August 25, 2017. Southbound/eastbound traffic remained on the old <b>bridge</b> until October 6, 2017. At that point, southbound/eastbound traffic shifted to the westbound span of the new <b>bridge</b> and the old <b>bridge</b> closed. When completed in 2018, including the new eastbound span (to carry lanes currently on the westbound span), the new Tappan Zee <b>Bridge</b> will be one of the longest cable-stayed spans in the nation.|$|E
50|$|Source-route {{transparent}} <b>bridging,</b> abbreviated SRT <b>bridging,</b> is {{a hybrid}} of source routing and transparent <b>bridging,</b> standardized in Section 9 of the IEEE 802.2 standard.

5|$|Contracts {{to build}} the Fort Henry <b>Bridge</b> were let to the American <b>Bridge</b> Company, a {{subsidiary}} of U.S. Steel, and Dravo Corporation of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Costing $6.8million, $1.8million over budget, and taking four years to complete, the Fort Henry <b>Bridge</b> opened to traffic on September 8, 1955 after a ribbon-cutting ceremony with then-governor William C. Marland {{in front of a}} crowd of 55,000 to 60,000 people. The <b>bridge</b> earned an Honorable Mention in 1955 from the National Steel <b>Bridge</b> Alliance, a part of the American Institute of Steel Construction, which recognizes the best steel bridges of the year. At the time of construction, the <b>bridge</b> was only the second tied-arch <b>bridge</b> across the Ohio River.|$|E
5|$|Dismantled in 1937, the <b>bridge</b> was {{relocated}} to Capon Lake in southeastern Hampshire County to carry Capon Springs Road (West Virginia Secondary Route 16) between West Virginia Route 259 and Capon Springs.
