This fight took place in Malang, and Americo upset his {{opponent}} with a ten round decision win, after which <b>Buttoms</b> retired. In his next fight, Americo was pitted against hot prospect Sang Mo-Koo of Busan, South Korea. Mo-Koo was being touted as a possible world title challenger for Mamby's WBC crown and had a record of 21-1-2, with 13 knockout wins. This bout was held on August 15, 1980 at Jakarta. Once again, Americo upset a far more experienced rival by knocking the South Korean out in round eight to win the OPBF Super Lightweight title. With these two upset wins, Americo became ranked by the WBC in the Super Lightweight division and got the world title chance that Mo-Koo was expected to receive next.|$|R

40|$|One of {{the three}} rings of the LCPC's ALT {{facility}} has been equipped in 2002 with a 3 meters high waterproof concrete pit and a pumping station, making possible to completely control the water table level in the soil supporting the experimental pavement. The pit has been filled by clayey-silty sand, which the modulus varies from 110 to 85 MPa according to the water content. This soil has been chosen for its water-content susceptibility, but also for its permeability properties, making possible to rise the water-table from the <b>buttom</b> of the pit {{to the top and}} saturate the soil within a time of about one week. The first experiment using this new installation has concerned the design of flexible pavements. The objective was to improve the taking into account of the hydraulic condition of the subgrade in flexible pavements design. Four different flexible pavements and one bituminous reference structure have been tested. The different structures were designed for a service life varying from 0. 25 to 1. 5 millions of 130 kN French standard loads. During the first stage, the water-table level in soil was maintained at its lowest level (- 2. 80 m) and the mean radius of rotation of the load was fixed at 19 meters. During the second stage, the water-table level was maintained at its upper level (- 0. 70 meter) and the radius of rotation of the load was 16 meters. In total 1. 5 million of 65 kN dual-wheel loading were applied during each stage. The different structures supported this traffic without suffering any particular major failure, except for the thinnest one which had to be reinforced after 250 000 passes during the second phase. The experiment led to globally confirm the current French rational design method for flexible pavement. However, it was also observed that the design model doesn't completely take into account the damaging factors; mainly the rutting of unbound granular aggregates. It is ignored by the design model, but it significantly contributes to the total permanent deformation of the structure...|$|E
40|$|Background The {{presence}} of ganglion cells within an endocrine pituitary adenoma in sellar region is rare, {{and is usually}} diagnosed as "mixed gangliocytoma-pituitary adenoma". Due to lack of radiological characteristics, {{it is very difficult}} to make an accurate diagnosis preoperatively. Herein we describe one case of unusual mixed gangliocytoma - growth hormone (GH) secreting pituitary adenoma in sellar region and review related literatures, so as to summarize the clinicopathological characteristics and improve the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of this tumor. Methods and Results A 28  - year - old female presented with headache and blurred vision for 8 months. She also complained of acromegaly and amenorrhea. Head CT and MRI examinations showed a sellar and suprasellar mass with clear boundary compressing the optic chiasm and <b>buttom</b> of the third ventricle. The mass exhibited isointense signal or mild hypointensity on T 1 WI and mild hyperintensity on T 2 WI with heterogeneous enhancement on the contrast MRI. The tumor was removed totally. The histological sections demonstrated two parts of intermixed areas. One part of areas was marked by a proliferation of scattered gangliocyte - like cells arranged in a fibrillary background. Other areas were marked by a sheet - like or locally papillary proliferation of round and oval cells. Immunohistochemically, cytoplasm of gangliocyte-cells were diffusely positive for synaptophysin (Syn), and negative for adenohypophysial hormones; cytoplasm of round and oval cells were diffusely positive for Syn, and almost 30 % cells were positive for GH, and negative for other neurohypophysial hormones. A final diagnosis of mixed gangliocytoma-GH secreting pituitary adenoma in sellar region (WHO grade Ⅰ) was made. The patient did not receive postoperatively adjuvant therapy and was followed-up for one year, without any neurological deficit or signs of recurrence. Conclusions Mixed gangliocytoma - pituitary adenoma is extremely rare and a definite diagnosis should be made under microscopy examination. Since the histogenesis of this tumor suggests that the uncommitted stem/progenitor cells consist of both adenohypophysial and neuronal characteristics and are capable of giving rise to pituitary adenoma with neuronal component, a diagnostic term of "pituitary adenoma with ganglionic differentiation" is suggested for this independent entity rather than collision tumor combined by two separate tumors.   DOI: 10. 3969 /j. issn. 1672 - 6731. 2016. 10. 011 </p...|$|E
