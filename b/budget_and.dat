40|$|Th e {{case study}} {{reported}} here challenges conventional wisdom about the feasibility of implementing responsibil-ity <b>budgeting</b> <b>and</b> accounting practices in U. S. govern-ment. A variant of this practice took root and operated eff ectively in a large federal agency — the Air Force Materiel Command — {{during the period of}} study. Contrary to conventional wisdom, implementing a meaningful form of responsibility <b>budgeting</b> <b>and</b> ac-counting does not require changes in public management policies or systemic institutional reform. However, the evidence shows that instituting practices of responsibility <b>budgeting</b> <b>and</b> accounting may require considerable administrative ingenuity in adapting the generic practice to the situation at hand. R esponsibility <b>budgeting</b> <b>and</b> accounting is a well-known generic practice for managing organizations that produce goods or deliver services, whether for sale or not. Systemic features of responsibility <b>budgeting</b> <b>and</b> accounting include del-egated and focused responsibility for resource utiliza-tion <b>and</b> results. Usually, <b>budgets</b> are performance targets, whereas accounts measure their degree of accomplishment with some accuracy. Responsibility <b>budgeting</b> <b>and</b> accounting is theoretically appealing — and widely practiced in the private sector — because it solves problems of organizational coordination and control that arise in pursuing such goals as routinely cost-eff ective operations.

5|$|The Senedd was {{constructed}} in two phases, the first in 2001 and the second from August 2003 until it was {{handed over to the}} National Assembly in February 2006. Between phases, the National Assembly changed contractors and the project's management structure, but retained Rogers as the scheme architect. The building was nearly six times over <b>budget</b> <b>and</b> four years and 10 months late, compared to the original estimates of the project in 1997. Total costs rose due to unforeseen security measures after the 11 September attacks, and because the National Assembly did not have an independent cost appraisal of the project until December 2000, three years after the original estimate. Phase 2 costs rose by less than 6% over <b>budget,</b> <b>and</b> that phase was six months late.|$|E
