The {{idea was}} inspired by a visit to Pittodrie to play a friendly against Aberdeen, where such dugouts had been constructed at the <b>behest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dons' trainer Donald Colman. The Goodison Park dugouts were the first in England.|$|E
5|$|It was, at first, {{merely a}} folly. It {{was used as}} a summer-house, and seven {{counties}} could be seen, as now, {{from the top of the}} flagstaff tower. The triangular turreted structure was set amidst a dense plantation of trees and overlooked Virginia Water, a man-made body of water constructed by Thomas and Paul Sandby at the <b>behest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Duke.|$|E
5|$|The {{first trip}} {{was at the}} <b>behest</b> <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Sunday Timess {{features}} editor Leonard Russell; the paper's chairman, Roy Thomson, enjoyed the series so much he requested Fleming undertook a second trip. The book version includes material edited out of the original articles, as well as photographs of the various cities.|$|E

25|$|At <b>the</b> <b>behest</b> <b>of</b> Mother Teresa, <b>the</b> member-sisters {{also took}} part in some {{activities}} of Asha Dhan, an institution to care for destitute women.|$|R
5|$|With this African-centred stance, Nigeria readily sent {{troops to}} the Congo at the <b>behest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United Nations shortly after {{independence}} (and has maintained membership since that time). Nigeria also supported several Pan African and pro-self government causes in the 1970s, including garnering support for Angola's MPLA, SWAPO in Namibia, and aiding opposition to the minority governments of Portuguese Mozambique, and Rhodesia.|$|E
5|$|Erected at the <b>behest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Illinois General Assembly, the University of Illinois Observatory became {{important}} {{in the development of}} astronomy due, in large part, to pioneering research by Dr. Stebbins, from 1907 to 1922. Joel Stebbins left the University of Illinois in 1922 but left behind a legacy of discovery that helped alter the face of modern astronomy. The building served the University of Illinois astronomy department from its opening until 1979, when the department moved into a new, larger building to house its growing staff.|$|E
5|$|Following the 2005 {{purchase}} of the original Colross site by a real estate development company, an archaeological excavation was undertaken between March and June that year at the <b>behest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city of Alexandria. Archaeologists uncovered an underground domed brick cistern and evidence of slave outbuildings, {{in addition to the}} foundations of the estate's peripheral walls and several ancillary structures. The excavation of the Colross site resulted in 79 condominium buyers abandoning their purchase agreements because of the delay in construction of a luxury Monarch Condominium project.|$|E
50|$|In 1900, at <b>the</b> <b>behest</b> <b>of</b> Stoke City, <b>the</b> Football Association {{placed a}} maximum wage in its {{statutes}}. It {{was removed from}} the Football Association's statutes 1904.|$|R
50|$|After <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> {{hostilities}} in <b>the</b> 1991 Gulf War, the Battle Damage Assessment Working Group (BDAWG) {{was formed}} at <b>the</b> <b>behest</b> <b>of</b> MTIC, <b>the</b> Military Targeting Intelligence Committee. Largely, this group sought {{to create a}} standard lexicon of terminology for describing BDA, and to develop an outlook for <b>the</b> future <b>of</b> BDA.|$|R
50|$|At <b>the</b> <b>behest</b> <b>of</b> William I, <b>the</b> Royal Architect Charles Vander Straeten {{designed}} the monument. The engineer Jean-Baptiste Vifquain conceived {{of it as}} a symbol <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Allied victory rather than as glorifying any sole individual.|$|R
5|$|Human rights organisations accuse {{police and}} {{military}} forces of mistreating and even torturing criminal suspects, ethnic minorities, homosexuals, and political activists. Prisons are overcrowded with little access to adequate food and medical facilities, and prisons run by traditional rulers in the north are charged with holding political opponents at the <b>behest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> government. However, since {{the first decade of}} the 21st century, an increasing number of police and gendarmes have been prosecuted for improper conduct.|$|E
5|$|Oliver Parker, an English {{director}} {{who had previously}} adapted An Ideal Husband by Wilde, made the 2002 film; it stars Colin Firth (Jack), Rupert Everett (Algy), Judi Dench (Lady Bracknell), Reese Witherspoon (Cecily), Frances O'Connor (Gwendolen), Anna Massey (Miss Prism), and Tom Wilkinson (Canon Chasuble). Parker's adaptation includes the dunning solicitor Mr. Gribsby who pursues Jack to Hertfordshire (present in Wilde's original draft, but cut at the <b>behest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> play's first producer). Algernon too is pursued {{by a group of}} creditors in the opening scene.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{aircraft}} had departed from U.S. soil and U.S. nationals {{had died in}} the incident, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) was legally required to investigate. On the morning of September 1, the NTSB chief in Alaska, James Michelangelo, received an order from the NTSB in Washington at the <b>behest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> State Department requiring all documents relating to the NTSB investigation to be sent to Washington, and notifying him that the State Department would now conduct the investigation.|$|E
40|$|AbstractLet H be a Hilbert {{space and}} B(H) <b>the</b> algebra <b>of</b> all bounded linear {{operators}} on H. It {{is known that}} {{there are two kinds of}} maximal abelian sub-algebras in B(H), to one of which there exists a unique faithful normal projection of norm one from B(H) and to the other any projection of norm one is singular. Any maximal abelian subalgebra A contains a projection e such that Ae is a maximal abelian subalgebra <b>of</b> <b>B(eH)</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first kind and A(1 − e) is <b>the</b> one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second kind in B((1 − e) H). This will be generalized to an arbitrary von Neumann algebra together with <b>the</b> existence problem <b>of</b> those kinds of maximal abelian subalgebras...|$|R
2500|$|Although Lohse's {{name was}} on the order, it was {{actually}} issued at <b>the</b> <b>behest</b> <b>of</b> Bruno Jedicke, <b>the</b> Ordnungspolizei chief in the Baltic States. [...] Jedicke in turn was subordinate to Friedrich Jeckeln, the senior SS man in the Baltic States and Belarus.|$|R
5|$|The tournament shares {{its name}} with the trophy, {{also called the}} Copa Libertadores or simply la Copa, which is awarded to the Copa Libertadores winner. It was {{designed}} by goldsmith Alberto de Gasperi, an Italian-born emigrant to Peru, in Camusso Jewelry in Lima at <b>the</b> <b>behest</b> <b>of</b> CONMEBOL. <b>The</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> laurel is made of sterling silver, with <b>the</b> exception <b>of</b> <b>the</b> football player at the top (which is made of bronze with a silver coating).|$|R
5|$|The monastery {{was founded}} by Merek Lama Lodre Gyamsto in 1680-81 at the <b>behest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 5th Dalai Lama, who was his contemporary. When Merek Lama was {{experiencing}} difficulties in building the monastery at the chosen location of Tsosum, the ancient name for Tawang, the 5th Dalai Lama issued directives {{to the people of}} the area to provide him all help. To fix the perimeter of the Dzong, the Dalai Lama had also given a ball of yarn, the length of which was to form the limit of the monastery.|$|E
5|$|With Saltimbanco {{finished}} and touring in the United States and Canada, Cirque du Soleil toured Japan {{in the summer}} of 1992 at the <b>behest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Fuji Television Network. Taking acts from Nouvelle Expérience and Cirque Réinventé, they created a show for this tour, titled Fascination. Although Fascination was never seen outside Japan, it represented the first time that Cirque du Soleil had produced a show that took place in an arena rather than a big top. It was also the first that Cirque du Soleil performed outside of North America.|$|E
5|$|A {{friend of}} Edward, Prince of Wales for over 20 years, in 1891 he {{attended}} a house party at Tranby Croft, Yorkshire, where he {{took part in a}} game of baccarat at the <b>behest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prince. During the course of two nights' play he was accused of cheating, which he denied vehemently. After news of the affair leaked out, he sued five members of the host family for slander; the Prince of Wales was called as a witness. The case was a public spectacle, widely reported in the UK and abroad, but the judgement went against Gordon-Cumming and he was ostracised from polite society.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> plea <b>of</b> P.K Deo that Kalahandi Assembly {{has already}} {{unanimously}} passed resolution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> merger with the Eastern States Union {{rather than with}} Orissa was bluntly ignored at Cuttack Darbar in December 1947 which was attended by Sardar Patel and V.P Menon at <b>the</b> <b>behest</b> <b>of</b> H.K Mahatab, <b>the</b> then Orissa Premier.|$|R
50|$|During {{the years}} 1985-90, Sri Ramana and Sri Bapu made videos for school {{subjects}} for children on television.

The same were later dubbed and aired by National Doordarshan. A.R. Rahaman, {{the present day}} music maestro, was then an upcoming drummer, providing background music for few of these videos.|$|R
5|$|During the 1970s and 1980s Tange {{expanded}} his portfolio to include buildings in over 20countries around the world. In 1985, at <b>the</b> <b>behest</b> <b>of</b> Jacques Chirac, <b>the</b> mayor <b>of</b> Paris at that time, Tange proposed {{a master plan}} for a plaza at Place d'Italie that would interconnect the city along an east-west axis.|$|R
5|$|Beginning in 1991, Jashari {{participated in}} {{attacks against the}} Serbian police before {{travelling}} to Albania to receive military training. Arrested in 1993, he was released at the <b>behest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Albanian Army and later returned to Kosovo, where he continued launching attacks against the Yugoslav establishment. In July 1997, {{he was convicted of}} terrorism in absentia by a Yugoslav court. After several unsuccessful attempts to capture or kill him, Serbian police launched an attack against Jashari's home in Prekaz in March 1998. The battle that followed resulted in the deaths of 58 members of Jashari's family, including that of Jashari, his wife, brother and son.|$|E
5|$|Clinton {{traveled}} to 79countries during this time, breaking the mark for most-traveled first lady held by Pat Nixon. She {{did not hold}} a security clearance or attend National Security Council meetings, but {{played a role in}} U.S. diplomacy attaining its objectives. A March 1995 five-nation trip to South Asia, on <b>behest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> U.S. State Department and without her husband, sought to improve relations with India and Pakistan. Clinton was troubled by the plight of women she encountered, but found a warm response from the people of the countries she visited and gained a better relationship with the American press corps. The trip was a transformative experience for her and presaged her eventual career in diplomacy.|$|E
5|$|Despite Venice's {{economic}} and maritime decline, in 1601 at the <b>behest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Doge Marino Grimani, the Venetian Senate {{decided to have}} a new bucentaur built at the cost of 70,000 ducats; although the existing one was still in service, experts regarded it as too old. The designer of the new ship is unknown, but he was selected from among the most qualified marangoni (ships' carpenters) of the Arsenale. The work was supervised by Marco Antonio Memmo, the sovraprovveditore (overseer of the provveditore) of the Arsenale. The new vessel was approved and praised by all on its maiden voyage to the Lido with the newly elected Doge Leonardo Donato on Ascension Day, 10 May 1606.|$|E
5|$|When Sugriva {{challenges}} Vali to a duel, Tara wisely advises Vali not {{to accept}} because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> former's alliance with Rama—the hero <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ramayana and an avatar <b>of</b> <b>the</b> god Vishnu—but Vali does not heed her, and dies from Rama's arrow, shot at <b>the</b> <b>behest</b> <b>of</b> Sugriva. <b>The</b> Ramayana and its later adaptations emphasize Tara's lamentation. While in most vernacular versions, Tara casts a curse on Rama by <b>the</b> power <b>of</b> her chastity, in some versions, Rama enlightens Tara.|$|R

50|$|After <b>the</b> Battle <b>of</b> Actium 31 BC, the Armenian {{king was}} {{executed}} by beheading at <b>the</b> <b>behest</b> <b>of</b> Cleopatra. In <b>the</b> past {{he had been}} an enemy of his namesake, King Artavasdes I of Media Atropatene, who had become an ally of Antony. She sent his head to Artavasdes I of Media Atropatene to secure his help.|$|R
5|$|Jacobson's case {{attracted}} {{some national}} media attention. Civil liberties advocates supported him, worried {{over what they}} saw as dangerous growth in government police powers during the Reagan and Bush administrations, when law enforcement were alleged to have cracked down on drugs as well as pornography distribution at the <b>behest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Religious Right. Operation Looking Glass, the USPS claimed, had netted 147 convictions, but only 35 where evidence was found that the offenders had either been involved in producing child pornography or molested children. Critics claimed that the government was exaggerating the child-porn problem at best and contributing to it at worst, possibly by introducing some consumers to material they might never have developed a taste for otherwise.|$|E
5|$|Kruger {{left the}} Transvaal by rail on 11 September 1900—he wept {{as the train}} crossed into Mozambique. He planned to board the first {{outgoing}} steamer, the Herzog of the German East Africa Line, but was prevented from doing so when, at the <b>behest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> local British Consul, the Portuguese Governor insisted that Kruger stay in port under house arrest. About a month later Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands concluded a deal with Britain to extricate Kruger on a Dutch warship, HNLMS Gelderland, and convey him through non-British waters to Marseille. Kruger was delighted to hear of this, but dismayed that Gezina, still in Pretoria, was not well enough to accompany him. Gelderland departed on 20 October 1900.|$|E
5|$|Seoba Srba (English: Migration of the Serbs) {{is a set}} of four similar oil {{paintings}} by the Serbian artist Paja Jovanović that depict Serbs, led by Archbishop Arsenije III, fleeing Old Serbia during the Great Serb Migration of 1690–91. The first was commissioned in 1895 by Georgije Branković, the Patriarch of Karlovci, to be displayed at the following year's Budapest Millennium Exhibition. In the view of the Serbian clergy, it would serve to legitimize Serb claims to religious autonomy and partial self-administration in Austria-Hungary by upholding the contention that Serbs left their homeland at the <b>behest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Holy Roman Emperor to protect the Habsburg Monarchy's borders.|$|E
25|$|The episode, {{the first}} to be boarded entirely by Moynihan himself, was partly based on a {{scrapped}} Adventure Time television movie that was going to air in <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fifth season. <b>The</b> death <b>of</b> Root Beer Guy was added on <b>behest</b> <b>of</b> Pendarvis, <b>the</b> voice <b>of</b> <b>the</b> character. The episode itself was seen by 1.948 million viewers and received largely positive reviews from critics with an online review courtesy of Entertainment Weekly arguing it was an example <b>of</b> <b>the</b> superiority <b>of</b> Adventure Time when compared to other television series.|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> Corps <b>of</b> Colonial Marines {{were two}} Marine units raised from former slaves for {{service in the}} Americas by the British at <b>the</b> <b>behest</b> <b>of</b> Alexander Cochrane. <b>The</b> units were created at two {{different}} times, and were later disbanded once the military threat had disappeared. Apart from being instigated in each case by Cochrane they had no connection with each other.|$|R
