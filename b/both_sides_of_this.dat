25|$|The frieze is 113 meters long, {{which makes}} it the longest {{surviving}} frieze of Greek Antiquity after the Parthenon frieze. On the western side it is interrupted by the ca. 20 meter wide stairway, which cuts into the foundation on that side and leads to a superstructure with columns. On <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> stairway there are projections constructed and decorated {{in a manner similar}} to the rest of the encircling frieze. The three-wing superstructure is relatively narrow compared with the base. The pillars surrounding the superstructure have platforms with profiles and Ionic capitals. There are many statues on the roof: a quadriga of horses, lion griffins, centaurs and deities, as well as uncompleted gargoyles. The upper hall gives a spacious impression thanks to the widely spaced columns. An additional columned hall was also planned for the inner courtyard where the fire altar itself was located, but not implemented. A frieze was installed there at eye level depicting the life of the mythical founder of the city, Telephus. Although no remains of paint have been found, it can be assumed that the entire structure was brightly painted in antiquity.|$|E

500|$|In the 1967 British Home Championship, Baxter {{produced}} a dominating but controversial performance for Scotland, tantalising England, {{who had won}} the World Cup in 1966, by playing [...] "keepie uppie" [...] (ball juggling) while waiting for teammates to get into good positions. Some commentators accepted that humiliating the opposition was a valid objective, while others regarded it as childish and thought Scotland should have won a more convincing victory than the actual 3–2 scoreline. Teammate Denis Law expressed opinions on <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> debate, saying that Baxter was [...] "the best player on the park" [...] and {{the main reason for}} the Scots' victory, but complaining that Baxter's lack of urgency had prevented Scotland from thoroughly avenging the 9–3 defeat in April 1961. Alex Ferguson said Baxter's performance [...] "could have been set to music". In this game Baxter also conspired with Billy Bremner against Alan Ball, sending Bremner a [...] "50-50" [...] pass, which allowed Bremner to [...] "hit Ball like a train" [...] when Ball contested possession. As Scotland were the first team to beat England after the 1966 FIFA World Cup, the Tartan Army proclaimed themselves [...] "unofficial world champions".|$|E

He said Williams [...] "astonishes in every scene", and praised the script for not racing over topics as many television shows do, but rather taking [...] "full measure {{of the weight of}} grief". Elaine Liner, television critic with the Corpus Christi Caller-Times, described Williams' performance as [...] "heartbreaking", but particularly praised the writers for [...] "taking the show to a higher level" [...] by making the perpetrator sympathetic and three-dimensional, not only the victim. Liner said, [...] "Fontana succeeds in fleshing out the characters on <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> tragedy." [...] Bob Langford of The News & Observer called the episode [...] "brilliant" [...] and praised it for focusing not on the crime but on the effects of it, as well as the realistic portrayals regarding race, such as concerns the crime would keep away white tourists. Langford said it was occasionally preachy, but said [...] "Sometimes, a good sermon is what we need. Amazing that one this powerful can come from a TV show." ...|$|E
