5|$|Bird {{collections}} are curated repositories of scientific specimens consisting of <b>birds</b> <b>and</b> their parts. They are a research resource for ornithology, {{the science of}} <b>birds,</b> <b>and</b> for other scientific disciplines in which information about birds is useful. These {{collections are}} archives of avian diversity and serve the diverse needs of scientific researchers, artists, and educators.|$|E
5|$|British naturalists {{in colonial}} {{considered}} {{them to be}} among the ugliest <b>birds,</b> <b>and</b> their habit of feeding on faeces was particularly despised.|$|E
50|$|Tangkoko Batuangus Nature Reserve protects {{at least}} 127 mammal, 233 <b>bird</b> <b>and</b> 104 reptile and {{amphibian}} species. Of these 79 mammal, 103 <b>bird</b> <b>and</b> 29 reptile and amphibian species are endemic to the island.|$|R
2500|$|On Monday {{nights at}} Minton’s, <b>Bird</b> <b>and</b> Dizzy {{would come in}} to jam, so you’d have a {{thousand}} [...] up there {{trying to get in}} so they could listen to <b>and</b> play with <b>Bird</b> <b>and</b> Dizzy. But most of the musicians in the know didn't even think about playing when <b>Bird</b> <b>and</b> Dizzy came to jam. We would just sit out in the audience, to listen and learn.|$|R

5|$|A nocturnal {{lifestyle}} {{has been}} suggested for the primitive ceratopsian Protoceratops. However, comparisons between the scleral rings of Protoceratops and Psittacosaurus and modern <b>birds</b> <b>and</b> reptiles indicate {{that they may have}} been cathemeral, active throughout the day at short intervals.|$|E
5000|$|Whittington downed a <b>bird</b> <b>and</b> went to {{retrieve}} it. While {{he was out}} of the hunting line, another covey was flushed and Cheney swung on a <b>bird</b> <b>and</b> fired, striking Whittington in the face, neck and chest.|$|R

50|$|Bird {{strike is}} an {{aviation}} {{term for a}} collision between a <b>bird</b> <b>and</b> an aircraft. Fatal accidents {{have been caused by}} both engine failure following <b>bird</b> ingestion <b>and</b> <b>bird</b> strikes breaking cockpit windshields.|$|R
5|$|A {{traditional}} {{story from}} western Arnhem Land tells of Black Cockatoo {{and her husband}} Crow, who are Bird-people, sprouting black feathers after becoming afflicted with a sickness from across the sea to the north. In fear of being buried underground, they transform into <b>birds</b> <b>and</b> fly high in the sky.|$|E
5|$|About 17.8 percent——of {{the total}} forested area of Vietnam was sprayed during the war, which {{disrupted}} the ecological equilibrium. The persistent nature of dioxins, erosion caused by loss of tree cover, {{and loss of}} seedling forest stock meant that reforestation was difficult (or impossible) in many areas. Many defoliated forest areas were quickly invaded by aggressive pioneer species (such as bamboo and cogon grass), making forest regeneration difficult and unlikely. Animal-species diversity was also impacted; in one study a Harvard biologist found 24 species of <b>birds</b> <b>and</b> five species of mammals in a sprayed forest, while in two adjacent sections of unsprayed forest there were 145 and 170 species of <b>birds</b> <b>and</b> 30 and 55 species of mammals.|$|E
5|$|Albatrosses {{are among}} the largest of flying <b>birds,</b> <b>and</b> the great {{albatrosses}} from the genus Diomedea have the largest wingspans of any extant birds.|$|E
30|$|The {{training}} {{images for}} ResNet were acquired as candidate regions of moving objects with background subtraction {{from the entire}} dataset. The training images include <b>bird</b> <b>and</b> non-bird regions, and we prepared a class of <b>bird</b> <b>and</b> seven background classes.|$|R

50|$|Sesame Street: Big <b>Bird's</b> Hide <b>and</b> Speak is a {{game for}} the Nintendo Entertainment System. It {{was one of the}} simplest-to-play NES games ever {{released}} commercially. It was also the first NES game to feature a digitized voice, in the form of Big Bird.

5|$|Animals {{including}} mammals, <b>birds</b> <b>and</b> insects such as {{bees and}} wasps (Ammophila and Sphex), {{are capable of}} learning landmarks in their environment, and of using these in navigation.|$|E
5|$|Archosaurs (crocodilians and <b>birds)</b> <b>and</b> mammals show {{complete}} {{separation of}} the heart into two pumps {{for a total of}} four heart chambers; it is thought that the four-chambered heart of archosaurs evolved independently from that of mammals. In crocodilians, there is a small opening, the foramen of Panizza, {{at the base of the}} arterial trunks and there is some degree of mixing between the blood in each side of the heart, during a dive underwater; thus, only in <b>birds</b> <b>and</b> mammals are the two streams of blood – those to the pulmonary and systemic circulations – permanently kept entirely separate by a physical barrier.|$|E
5|$|Beebe's {{position}} in the Zoological Society underwent a change in 1918: He was given the title of Honorary Curator of <b>Birds,</b> <b>and</b> was made {{the director of the}} newly created Department of Tropical Research. With his new position, Beebe no longer had the duty of caring for the zoo's animals, freeing him to devote himself fully to his writing and research. Beebe's duties as curator were passed to Lee Crandall, the former Assistant Curator who had worked under Beebe, although Crandall continued to rely on Beebe for help treating illness in <b>birds,</b> <b>and</b> caring for the exotic birds brought back from Beebe's expeditions.|$|E
25|$|PSLV-C3 carried and {{deployed}} total three satellites. Technology Experiment Satellite (TES) was {{the main}} payload <b>and</b> <b>BIRD</b> <b>and</b> PROBA were two auxiliary payloads that were mounted on PSLV-C3.

5|$|Bill McGinnis quickly {{discovered}} homeotic gene sequences, homeoboxes, in animals in other phyla, in vertebrates such as frogs, <b>birds,</b> <b>and</b> mammals; they were later {{also found in}} fungi such as yeasts, and in plants. There were evidently strong similarities in the genes that controlled development across all the eukaryotes.|$|E
5|$|Cats hunt small prey, {{primarily}} <b>birds</b> <b>and</b> rodents, and {{are often}} used {{as a form of}} pest control. Domestic cats are a major predator of wildlife in the United States, killing an estimated 1.4–3.7 billion <b>birds</b> <b>and</b> 6.9–20.7 billion mammals annually. The bulk of predation in the United States is done by 80 million feral and stray cats. Effective measures to reduce this population are elusive, meeting opposition from cat enthusiasts. In the case of free-ranging pets, equipping cats with bells and not letting them out at night will reduce wildlife predation.|$|E
5|$|Comparisons {{between the}} scleral rings and {{estimated}} orbit size of Plateosaurus and modern <b>birds</b> <b>and</b> reptiles {{suggest that it}} may have been cathemeral, active throughout the day and night, possibly avoiding the midday heat.|$|E

5|$|Grasshoppers have a {{wide range}} of predators at {{different}} stages of their lives; eggs are eaten by bee-flies, ground beetles and blister beetles; hoppers and adults are taken by other insects such as ants, robber flies and sphecid wasps, by spiders, and by many <b>birds</b> <b>and</b> small mammals.|$|E
