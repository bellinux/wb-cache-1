5|$|During {{his second}} term as governor, in 1906, Beckham made a bid to become a U.S. senator. His stance in favor of {{prohibition}} cost him the votes of four legislators {{in his own party}} and the General Assembly gave the seat to Republican William O. Bradley, who had been governor in 1895-99. Six years later Beckham secured the seat by popular election, but he lost his re-election <b>bid</b> <b>in</b> 1920 largely because of his pro-temperance views and his opposition to women's suffrage. Though he continued to play an active role in state politics for another two decades, he never returned to elected office, failing in his gubernatorial <b>bid</b> <b>in</b> 1927 and his senatorial campaign in 1936.

In 1867, just five days after John L. Helm and Stevenson were elected governor and lieutenant governor, respectively, Helm died and Stevenson became acting governor. Stevenson subsequently won a special election in 1868 to finish Helm's term. As governor, he opposed federal intervention in what he considered state matters but insisted that blacks' newly granted rights be observed and used the state militia to quell post-war violence in the state. Although a fiscal conservative, he advocated a new tax to benefit education and created the state bureau of education.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} individual bidding {{data from}} a series of first price (FP) and second price (SP) sealed-bid auctions in which the number of bidders is unknown.

We find essentially no heterogeneity <b>in</b> <b>bidding</b> <b>in</b> SP auctions where risk preferences and the number of bidders do not affect the optimal <b>bid,</b> while <b>in</b> the FP auctions heterogeneity <b>in</b> <b>bidding</b> persists and increases with experience.

40|$|Motivated by {{efficiency}} and equity concerns, public resource managers have increasingly utilized hybrid allocation mechanisms that combine features of commonly used price (e. g., auction) and non-price (e. g., lottery) mechanisms. This study {{serves as an}} initial investigation of these hybrid mechanisms, exploring theoretically and experimentally how the opportunity to obtain a homogeneous good in a subsequent lottery affects Nash equilibrium <b>bids</b> <b>in</b> discriminative and uniform price auctions. The lottery imposes an opportunity cost to winning the auction, systematically reducing equilibrium auction <b>bids.</b> <b>In</b> contrast to the uniform price auction, equilibrium <b>bids</b> <b>in</b> the uniform price hybrid mechanism vary with bidder risk preferences.
