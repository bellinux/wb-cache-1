40|$|The Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) on- board Envisat {{operated}} {{successfully for}} just over 10 years until {{the failure of}} Envisat in April 2012. ASAR was ESA‚Äôs very first deployment of a C-band phased- array antenna, allowing extended imaging capacity in comparison to its ERS SAR predecessors. As such it operated in various acquisition modes ‚Äì Image (IM), Alternating Polarisation (AP), Wide Swath (WS), Global Monitoring (GM), and Wave (WV). For IM and AP modes there was a selection of 7 swaths with swath width from 100 km to 56 km: IM was single-polarisation, while AP was dual-pol, offering a choice from HH&VV, HH&HV, or VV&VH. WS and GM modes had a total swath width of 405 km based on the combination of 5 sub-swaths. WV acquired imagettes of 10 km by 10 km every 100 km along the satellite track. This paper is a look back to the 10 years of ASAR operations, covering topics such as the ASAR Instrument (characteristics, acquisition modes, product tree and observation scenario), Instrument Calibration and Performance Verification (including instrument stability, internal calibration, external calibration, absolute radiometric calibration, localisation accuracy, absolute geolocation accuracy, performance verification and product calibration), ASAR specific missions (wave and polarimetric), particular ASAR events such as antenna resets, <b>burst</b> <b>synchronisation,</b> AP swath modifications and the Envisat orbit change in October 2010...|$|E
40|$|TerraSAR-L {{is the new}} {{imaging radar}} mission of the European Space Agency. The platform, {{based on the novel}} Snapdragon concept, is built around the active phase array antenna of the L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). Specification of the L-SAR has been guided by careful {{analysis}} of the product requirements resulting in a robust baseline design with considerable margins. Besides having a commercial role for the provision of geo-information products, TerraSAR-L will contribute to the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) initiative and serve the scientific user community. Interferometry (INSAR) is a key element behind a number of mission objectives. A L-band SAR in a 14 -day repeat orbit is an ideal sensor for solid earth applications (earth quake and volcano monitoring, landslides and subsidence) relying on differential interferometry. L-band penetration of vegetation cover facilitates these applications also over vegetated surfaces. Because of the high coherence, L-band is also the preferred frequency for monitoring ice sheet and glacier dynamics. Highly accurate orbit control (orbital tube < 100 m) and special wideband INSAR modes are required to support these applications globally and systematically. Precise <b>burst</b> <b>synchronisation</b> enables repeat-pass ScanSAR interferometry and global coverage within the short repeat cycle. A feasibility study into cartwheel constellations flying in close formation with TerraSAR-L revealed the potential for generating Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of unprecedented quality (2 m relative height accuracy @ 12 m posting). The TerraSAR-L operations strategy is based on a long-term systematic and repetitive acquisition scenario to ensure consistent data archives and to maximise the exploitation of this very powerful SAR system. ...|$|E
40|$|The continual {{demand for}} {{increased}} mobile radio capacity prompts continued {{development of new}} technology to increase system performance. This thesis presents {{an investigation of the}} performance of a generalised linear diversity receiver, as an implementable approximation to the optimum diversity receiver. The receiver utilises space, or antenna, diversity combining to combat the effects of multipath fading experienced in the mobile channel. The receiver is intended for coherent reception of linearly modulated wideband time division multiple access (TDMA) digital transmissions. The receiver structure is also restricted to the linear case. Two major analyses are undertaken in this thesis: the performance of the diversity receiver with finite-length fractionally-spaced branch equalisers, assuming ideal channel-state-information and synchronisation; and the performance of a carrier frequency offset recovery algorithm, assuming only knowledge of the channel autocorrelation function, and <b>burst</b> <b>synchronisation.</b> This thesis presents a general time-varying frequency-selective multipath Rayleigh fading model. The system model includes non-white, non-Gaussian co-channel interferers as well as non-white, but Gaussian co-channel interferers. However, adjacent channel interference is not modelled. Simulation results are presented for the best possible performance (with ideal channel-state-information) of the diversity receiver, showing the effects of diversity and finite equaliser length, and are compared to results for the optimum linear receiver. The results show that increased diversity is very powerful in improving the performance of the receiver, and that the equaliser lengths can be quite short (e. g., 10 taps) and the receiver will still perform close to the optimum. The receiver is shown to be more capable of combating non-Gaussian co-channel interference than Gaussian (or noise-like) interference. The performance of the carrier frequency offset estimator is also determined by simulation. It is found that in most cases, doubling the diversity reduces the error standard deviation by a factor of two or more. The estimator is found to be relatively insensitive to symbol timing, channel delay spread, frequency offset and signal-to-noise ratio, especially with high diversity...|$|E
40|$|The {{brain of}} mammals {{are divided into}} {{different}} cortical areas that are anatomically connected forming larger networks which perform cognitive tasks. The cat cerebral cortex is composed of 65 areas organised into the visual, auditory, somatosensory-motor and frontolimbic cognitive regions. We have built a network of networks, in which networks are connected among themselves according to the connections observed in the cat cortical areas aiming to study how inputs drive the synchronous behaviour in this cat brain-like network. We show that without external perturbations {{it is possible to}} observe high level of <b>bursting</b> <b>synchronisation</b> between neurons within almost all areas, except for the auditory area. <b>Bursting</b> <b>synchronisation</b> appears between neurons in the auditory region when an external perturbation is applied in another cognitive area. This is a clear evidence that pattern formation and collective behaviour in the brain might be a process mediated by other brain areas under stimulation...|$|R
40|$|We {{have studied}} {{neuronal}} synchronisation {{in a random}} network of adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire neurons. We study how spiking or bursting synchronous behaviour appears {{as a function of}} the coupling strength and the probability of connections, by constructing parameter spaces that identify these synchronous behaviours from measurements of the inter-spike interval and the calculation of the order parameter. Moreover, we verify the robustness of synchronisaton by applying an external perturbation to each neuron. The simulations show that <b>bursting</b> <b>synchronisation</b> is more robust than spike synchronisation...|$|R
