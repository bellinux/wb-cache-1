5|$|Never before have I {{written to}} {{a player to}} express my regret at his {{omission}} from the Australian XI. In your case I am making an exception because I {{want you to know}} how much my colleagues and I disliked having to make this move. Captain one match and out of the side the next looks like ingratitude, but you understand the circumstances and will <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> that your form has not been good.|$|E
500|$|The Chicago Sun-Times said, [...] "Valene Ewing Gibson would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> {{that the}} past seven years have been no day at the beach. She lost her first husband to a sultry siren who applies eyeliner with a trowel. She opened her heart and her home to a nagging mother who could drive Mother Teresa to slit her wrists. She {{discovered}} a long-lost brother who just happened to be a psychotic TV evangelist. She even had a nervous breakdown that left her convinced her name was Verna, and was an 'I do' away from tying the knot with a scheming sleazeball who was well aware of her family ties to the Ewings of Dallas even if she had forgotten." ...|$|E
500|$|Berridge {{defended the}} family, saying that Tahil's {{departure}} {{caused a lot}} of problems, however, she added, [...] "he Ferreiras have not been as successful as we had hoped. I think in retrospect we made a mistake in giving their entrance such a fanfare as a New Asian Family. Viewers traditionally {{take a long time to}} adapt to anyone new [...] so it was wrong to emphasise what was different about this family from the start. Even so, we had a terrific first story for them, which was to have culminated in a huge, action storyline to mark the exit of their father. However, the sudden removal of actor Dalip Tahil, for reasons beyond our control, meant that the story had to be abandoned quickly – and 40 scripts rewritten on the spot. The result was the transplant story, which I have to admit did go on for far too long, especially when our biggest story in this period had also to be abandoned because of the pregnancy of Kacey Ainsworth. The writers and production team did their very best under these circumstances but I would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> the end result was not our finest hour. I hope that viewers will not hold this against the Ferreira family and will be prepared to watch the next stage of their stories with an open mind. This is a very talented bunch of actors, who've had to put up with a lot of stick for problems which have not been of their making. Viewer response to their lighter material was very favourable and I am confident the Ferreiras will regain their popularity." [...] Lorraine Heggessey, controller of BBC One, said the show became overdependent on the kidney transplant storyline as there were several cast problems, such as illness, pregnancy, rehab and a car crash. Berridge quit as executive producer of EastEnders and was replaced by Kathleen Hutchison.|$|E

2500|$|A {{particularly}} well-known {{example is}} Arthur Conan Doyle's fictionalization of the Danites in A Study in Scarlet, the first Sherlock Holmes novel, published in 1887. In the story, the Danites constitute a brutal group of enforcing vigilantes {{operating under the}} direction of Brigham Young—and more particularly the fictional Sacred Council of Four, silencing criticism and questioning, and preventing dissenters from leaving the Salt Lake Valley. Doyle's embellishment of the folklore surrounding the original Missouri band transplanted to a romantic wild west setting, the established criminal notoriety of Rockwell, and rumors of Young's Avenging Angels made acceptance of the [...] "authoritative" [...] Sherlock story a simple matter for English readers. However, after a visit to Utah in 1923, Doyle is reported to have said [...] "...he had been misled by writings of the time about the church." [...] In 1991, Doyle's daughter stated that [...] "Father would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> that his first Sherlock Holmes novel was full of errors about the Mormons." ...|$|E

2500|$|After Australia's biggest {{defeat at}} home in 50 years the Australian press were in uproar and the {{selectors}} Ewart Macmillan, Jack Ryder and Don Bradman took drastic action, dropping the captain Brian Booth, batsman Bob Cowper and the bowlers Garth McKenzie, Peter Philpott and David Sincock. Booth {{received a letter from}} Bradman on behalf of the selectors explaining [...] "Never before have I written to a player to express my regret at his omission from the Australian XI. In your case I am making an exception because I want you to know how much my colleagues and I disliked having to make this move. Captain one match and out of the side the next looks like ingratitude, but you understand the circumstances and will <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> that your form has not been good." [...] Booth had made only 84 runs (16.80) in the series and never played for Australia again. Cowper was blamed for slow scoring even though he had made 99 and 60 in the Second and Third Tests. Peter Allan of Queensland was brought back into the side after he had taken the third best bowling figures in Australia – 10/61 in the first innings against Victoria, but was injured and McKenzie was restored to the team. The off-spinner Tom Veivers and young batsmen Ian Chappell were called up and Keith Stackpole made his Test debut, so Australia went to Adelaide with only three specialist bowlers – McKenzie, Hawke and Veivers. England simply kept the same XI from Sydney, even though this meant that Geoff Boycott was their third place bowler after Jeff Jones and Dave Brown. Mike Smith won the toss and decided to bat.|$|E

6000|$|Now {{the modern}} critic is a humbug, because he professes {{to be entirely}} inarticulate. Speech is his whole {{business}}; and he boasts of being speechless. Before Botticelli he is mute. But {{if there is any}} good in Botticelli (there is much good, and much evil too) it is emphatically the critic's business to explain it: to translate it from terms of painting into terms of diction. Of course, the rendering will be inadequate&mdash;but so is Botticelli. It is a fact he would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit.</b> But anything which has been intelligently received can at least be intelligently suggested. Pater does suggest an intelligent cause for the cadaverous colour of Botticelli's [...] "Venus Rising from the Sea." [...] Ruskin does suggest an intelligent motive for Turner destroying forests and falsifying landscapes. These two great critics were far too fastidious for my taste; they urged to excess the idea that a sense of art was a sort of secret; to be patiently taught and slowly learnt. Still, they thought it could be taught: they thought it could be learnt. They constrained themselves, with considerable creative fatigue, to find the exact adjectives which might parallel in English prose what has been clone in Italian painting. The same is true of Whistler and R. A. M. Stevenson and many others in the exposition of Velasquez. They had something to say about the pictures; they knew it was unworthy of the pictures, but they said it.|$|E
