5|$|In 1975, the United States was {{completing}} a retreat from Vietnam. A staunchly anti-communist Indonesia was considered <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>to</b> be an essential counterweight, and friendly {{relations with the}} Indonesian government were considered {{more important than a}} decolonisation process in East Timor. The United States also wanted to maintain its access to deep water straits running through Indonesia for undetectable submarine passage between the Indian and Pacific oceans.|$|E
5|$|High Explosive Research was the British {{project to}} {{independently}} develop atomic bombs after the Second World War. This decision {{was taken by}} a cabinet sub-committee on 8 January 1947, in response to apprehension of an American return to isolationism, fears that Britain might lose its great power status, and the actions <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>to</b> unilaterally withdraw from sharing of nuclear technology under the 1943 Quebec Agreement. The decision was publicly announced in the House of Commons on 12 May 1948.|$|E

Although {{he returned to the}} U.S. in October disheartened by the failure of the conference and exhausted by his obligations at the Exposition, the trip had secured Walker a commanding national and international reputation.|$|E

5|$|Sayyid Abd al-Rahman {{said that}} {{from then on}} the British did {{everything}} they could to break up the Umma party and to thwart him personally. They tried without success to get tribal chiefs and village leaders to leave the Umma. He claimed that it was the Umma that forced the British to establish a committee to start drafting a constitution for an independent Sudan in 1951, a constitution that was endorsed in April 1952. However, broader considerations were anyway leading the British towards support for an independent Sudan despite attempts <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>to</b> persuade them to give Egypt a role.|$|E
5|$|The 1973 war {{convinced}} the Israelis {{of the necessity}} of negotiations with the Arabs. This unprecedented willingness, coupled with Sadat's diplomatic initiatives and intercession <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>to</b> break barriers of mistrust between Egypt and Israel, made possible the long series of discussions between both nations. The negotiations ultimately resulted in the 1978 Camp David Agreements, and the peace treaty between Egypt and Israel in 1979. Thus, without resorting to another major war, Sadat had been able to regain the Sinai through diplomatic means.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet Union {{initially}} denied {{knowledge of}} the incident, but later admitted shooting down the aircraft, claiming that {{it was on a}} MASINT spy mission.

The White House accused the Soviet Union of obstructing search and rescue operations. The Soviet Armed Forces suppressed evidence sought by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) investigation, such as the flight recorders, which were released eight years later, after the dissolution of the Soviet Union.|$|E

5|$|Throughout {{the early}} part of 1956, Cooper {{strongly}} advocated that the U.S. respect Indian nonalignment and increase economic aid to the country. In August 1956, Congress approved a financial aid package for India that included the largest sale up to that point of surplus agricultural products <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>to</b> any country. Cooper's persistence in requesting such aid was critical in getting the package approved, as it was opposed by many administration officials, including Under Secretary of State Herbert Hoover, Jr., Treasury Secretary George M.

5|$|On 17 September, U.S. diplomat Richard Holbrooke and U.S. Ambassador to Croatia Peter W. Galbraith {{met with}} Croatian President Franjo Tuđman in Zagreb. Holbrooke was {{directed}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>to</b> urge Tuđman to stop offensive operations by the HV in western Bosnia and Herzegovina. However, Holbrooke and Galbraith thought the instructions unwise {{and saw the}} opportunity to defeat the VRS and establish a new military balance in the country. Holbrooke also considered that the changing {{situation on the ground}} allowed him and Galbraith to ignore the instructions. Holbrooke urged Tuđman to capture Sanski Most, Novi Grad and Prijedor from the VRS, and to do so quickly, but asked him to stop short of capturing Banja Luka. Holbrooke and Galbraith considered it would be advantageous for them and that justice would be served if the VRS lost Banja Luka, but decided against encouraging it, fearing there would be another 200,000 refugees from the city or that Croatia would not be willing to relinquish control of Banja Luka later on. They were also hoping that more moderate Bosnian Serb leadership might be found in the city, as it was the most urban Bosnian Serb area.|$|E
5|$|In 1920, the Government of Canada {{announced}} that the Imperial War Graves Commission had awarded Canada eight sites—five in France and three in Belgium—on which to erect memorials. Each site represented a significant Canadian engagement, and the Canadian government initially decided that each battlefield be treated equally and commemorated with identical monuments. In September 1920, the Canadian government formed the Canadian Battlefields Memorials Commission to discuss the process and conditions for holding a memorial competition for the sites in Europe. The commission held its first meeting on 26 November 1920 and during this meeting decided that the architectural design competition {{would be open to}} all Canadian architects, designers, sculptors, and artists. The jury consisted of Charles Herbert Reilly representing the Royal Institute of British Architects, Paul Philippe Cret representing the Société centrale des architectes français and Frank Darling representing the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada. Each jury member was a leader in the architectural field; Reilly was training students in design and development of war memorials, and Cret had been selected <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>to</b> design national monuments in Europe. Interested parties submitted 160 design drawings, and the jury selected 17submissions for consideration, commissioning each finalist to produce a plaster maquette of their respective design. The jury recommended in a 10 September 1921 report to the commission that two of the designs be executed. In October 1921, the commission formally selected the submission of Toronto sculptor and designer Walter Seymour Allward as the winner of the competition; the design submitted by Frederick Chapman Clemesha was selected as runner-up. The complexity of Allward's design precluded the possibility of duplicating the design at each site. The approach of selecting one primary memorial ran counter to the recommendation of Canadian Battlefields Memorials Commission architectural advisor Percy Erskine Nobbs, who had consistently expressed his preference for a series of smaller monuments. The consensus went in Allward's favour, his design receiving both public and critical approval. The commission revised its initial plans and decided to build two distinctive memorials—those of Allward and Clemesha—and six smaller identical memorials.|$|E

25|$|In 1846 the Mallarino–Bidlack Treaty, {{negotiated}} {{between the}} U.S. and New Granada, granted the United States transit {{rights and the}} right to intervene militarily in the isthmus.

25|$|The Soviet {{response}} to the SDI during the period March 1983 through November 1985 provided indications of {{their view of the}} program both as a threat and as an opportunity to weaken NATO.
