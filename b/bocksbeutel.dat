50|$|The <b>Bocksbeutel</b> {{has been}} used for wine from Franconia at least since the early 18th century, {{initially}} for the wines from the region's most famous vineyard, the Würzburger Stein, and later for other Franconian wines, in particular those of better quality. The city council of Würzburg decided in 1728 that the best wines from the city's own winery, the Bürgerspital, should be filled in <b>Bocksbeutel</b> bottles.|$|E
5000|$|There is a later {{expression}} einen <b>Bocksbeutel</b> anhängen ("to {{attach a}} <b>Bocksbeutel</b> someone"), meaning [...] "to make someone {{an object of}} ridicule", attested in the 19th-century Deutsches Wörterbuch. A physical <b>Bocksbeutel</b> was indeed used as a practical joke (cf. the [...] "Kick me" [...] prank, cuckold horns {{and other forms of}} public humiliation such as [...] "donkey ears"), but a wine bottle is an unlikely object to use for such a purpose. Both a Booksbüdel and a ram's scrotum are perfectly suitable, being small and light objects with a connotation of ridiculousness. Thus, it is hard to determine to what extent either Booksbüdel or Bokesbudel or both contributed to the modern term.|$|E
50|$|Bukettraube is {{also known}} under the {{synonyms}} <b>Bocksbeutel,</b> Bouquet Blanc, Bouquet Traube, Bouquettraube, Boxer, Buket, Bukettrebe, Bukettriesling, Sylvaner Musqué, Würzburger.|$|E
5000|$|There are two {{conflicting}} {{claims of}} the origin of the name <b>Bocksbeutel,</b> although the Beutel-part stands for [...] "container" [...] in both cases.|$|E
50|$|Within the European Union, the <b>Bocksbeutel</b> {{enjoys the}} status of a {{protected}} bottle shape. The regulations describe the <b>Bocksbeutel</b> as a short-necked glass bottle, pot-bellied but flattened in shape, with the base and the cross-section of the bottle at the point of greatest convexity ellipsoidal in shape. The ratio between the long and short axes of the ellipsoidal cross-section is approximately 2:1, and the ratio of the height of the convex body to the cylindrical neck of the bottle is approximately 2.5:1.|$|E
5000|$|Tauberfranken, in {{the northeastern}} {{outskirts}} {{of the region and}} neighbouring Franconia. The wines are similar to the wines of Franconia, and are sold in the round <b>Bocksbeutel</b> bottle characteristic of Franconia.|$|E
5000|$|Certain {{traditional}} bottle types {{may only}} be used for wines of certain origins; these are the <b>Bocksbeutel</b> and the Clavelin, {{as well as the}} Flûte d'Alsace, the use of which is only regulated within France.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Bocksbeutel</b> {{is a type}} of {{wine bottle}} with the form of a {{flattened}} ellipsoid. It is commonly used for wines from Franconia in Germany, but is also used for some Portuguese wines, in particular rosés, where the bottle is called cantil, and in rare cases for Italian wine (in this case called pulcianella) and Greek wine.|$|E
50|$|Bavaria is {{also home}} to the Franconia wine region, which is {{situated}} along the Main River in Franconia. The region has produced wine (Frankenwein) for over 1,000 years and is famous for its use of the <b>Bocksbeutel</b> wine bottle. The production of wine forms {{an integral part of the}} regional culture, and many of its villages and cities hold their own wine festivals (Weinfeste) throughout the year.|$|E
50|$|Eltmann lies at {{the eastern}} border of the renowned Franconian wine-producing region. Franconian wines are known {{throughout}} Germany for their dryness, and have a spicy or earthy flavor. These wines are bottled in the distinctive, green, flagon-shaped bottle called the <b>Bocksbeutel.</b> The superior quality of these wines has ensured their popularity among Germans, {{and as a result}} little of the Franconian production is exported.|$|E
5000|$|Beyond {{that also}} tourism became a crucial factor {{of the economy}} in Reicholzheim, which {{increased}} lovely Tauber valley [...] "by the wheel drive" [...] in the last years having increased. Reicholzheim also has some glass blowing enterprises, a furniture factory and the winegrowers' co-operative. Reicholzheim also has a branch office to the area winegrowers' co-operative Franconia (GWF). (39 wines, - 5 current an excellent wine grows here, too. The best known is a strong wine called <b>Bocksbeutel,</b> grown in the area of Reicholzheim. A very good vineyard, located in the northern Baden village of Reicholzheim grows some smart, deeply flavored Silvaner.|$|E

40|$|The nuclear lamina {{represents}} a protein network required for nuclear structure and function. One family of lamina proteins {{is defined by}} an ∼ 40 -aa LAP 2, Emerin, and MAN 1 (LEM) domain (LEM-D) that binds the nonspecific DNA-binding protein, barrier-to-autointegration factor (BAF). Through interactions with BAF, LEM-D proteins serve as a bridge between chromosomes and the nuclear envelope. Mutations in genes encoding LEM-D proteins cause human laminopathies {{that are associated with}} tissue-restricted pathologies. Drosophila has five genes that encode proteins with LEM homology. Using yeast two-hybrid analyses, we demonstrate that four encode proteins that bind Drosophila (d) BAF. In addition to dBAF, dMAN 1 associates with lamins, the LEM-D protein <b>Bocksbeutel,</b> and the receptor-regulated Smads, demonstrating parallel protein interactions with vertebrate homologs. P-element mobilization was used to generate null dMAN 1 alleles. These mutants showed decreased viability, with surviving adults displaying male sterility, decreased female fertility, wing patterning and positioning defects, flightlessness, and locomotion difficulties that became more severe with age. Increased phospho-Smad staining in dMAN 1 mutant wing discs is consistent with a role in transforming growth factor (TGF) -β/bone morphogenic protein (BMP) signaling. The tissue-specific, age-enhanced dMAN 1 mutant phenotypes are reminiscent of human laminopathies, suggesting that studies in Drosophila will provide insights into lamina dysfunction associated with disease...|$|E
