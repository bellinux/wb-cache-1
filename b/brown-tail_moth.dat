5|$|In 1905 the USDA {{initiated}} {{its first}} large-scale biological control program, sending entomologists to Europe and Japan {{to look for}} natural enemies of the gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar dispar, and <b>brown-tail</b> <b>moth,</b> Euproctis chrysorrhoea, invasive pests of trees and shrubs. As a result, nine parasitoids (solitary wasps) of gypsy moth, seven of <b>brown-tail</b> <b>moth,</b> and two predators of both moths became established in the USA. Although the gypsy moth was not fully controlled by these natural enemies, the frequency, duration, and severity of its outbreaks were reduced and the program was regarded as successful. This program also {{led to the development}} of many concepts, principles, and procedures for the implementation of biological control programs.|$|E
50|$|Cicely Blair wrote a {{paper about}} the rash {{caused by the}} <b>brown-tail</b> <b>moth</b> {{caterpillar}} in 1979. It {{was found that the}} loose hairs break off as barbs and on contact with skin can cause rashes, skin irritation, headaches and breathing difficulties. The species should be handled using protective gloves at all stages of its life cycle.|$|E
50|$|The factors {{underlying}} <b>brown-tail</b> <b>moth</b> {{population dynamics}} are little understood {{and have been}} only thoroughly investigated by few researchers. They found that parasitoids, microsporidial disease and intraspecific competition {{were the most important}} mortality agents. In North America, the incidence of parasitism is the most important factor dictating the persistence of the exotic populations exclusively in coastal habitats. Knowledge concerning the role of plant factors is limited to larval performance and development on different host plants. With regard to weather factors, it is known that diapausing larvae are cold tolerant but susceptible to freezing by extreme cold. In North America, besides parasitism, cold temperatures may prevent the browntail moth from extending its invasive range from coastal to inland habitats. Intraspecific competition may also be implicated in <b>brown-tail</b> <b>moth</b> mortality, since in several populations survival was higher at low densities. During outbreaks browntail moth females show an increased fecundity.|$|E
5000|$|The {{peculiarity}} of <b>brown-tail</b> <b>moth's</b> {{life history}} {{is that for}} 10 months of a year {{it is in the}} larval stage, overwintering as young larvae. The phenology of this pest may be summarized as follows: ...|$|R
50|$|Geraniums are {{eaten by}} the larvae of some Lepidoptera species {{including}} <b>brown-tail</b> and mouse <b>moth.</b> At least {{several species of}} Geranium are gynodioecious.|$|R
25|$|Leaves are {{eaten by}} the larva {{of the coastal}} race of the ash pug moth and by larvae of other Lepidoptera, {{including}} <b>brown-tail,</b> dun-bar, emperor <b>moth,</b> mottled umber, and Coleophora elaeagnisella.|$|R
5000|$|This {{univoltine}} defoliator {{feeds on}} 26 genera of non-resinous {{trees and shrubs}} belonging to 13 different families. Considering that it is unusual for an insect to feed on members belonging to more than two different families, the polyphagy of this pest is remarkable. <b>Brown-tail</b> <b>moth</b> polyphagy, together with its tendency to reach outbreak densities, makes this species a major pest of hardwood forests; it may also attack fruit and ornamental trees.|$|E
5000|$|The {{gipsy moth}} was {{introduced}} by accident from Europe into Massachusetts about 1861. [...] The sweet potato weevil was first discovered in 1875. About 1892, the <b>brown-tail</b> <b>moth</b> was introduced near Boston from Europe. The boll weevil entered Texas about 1892 {{in the vicinity of}} Brownsville. The Argentine ant was first discovered in the United States at New Orleans in 1891, New International Encyclopedia and the alfalfa leaf weevil was first discovered in Utah in 1904. Establishing control over an increasing number of insect pests and insect-borne diseases led to the establishment of the Bureau of Entomology.|$|E
50|$|John Douglas Tothill was {{the first}} federal {{forestry}} official appointed in New Brunswick. He studied at the Ontario Agricultural College, specialising in entomology and botany, and in 1922 received a doctorate from Harvard University. He was employed {{for a short period}} by the US Bureau of Entomology Gypsy Moth Parasite laboratory. Tothill later joined the Entomology Branch of the Departmentof Agriculture and established a laboratory on the University of New Brunswick campus in Fredericton.Over the next decade he led research on invasive insects, such as the <b>brown-tail</b> <b>moth</b> Euproctis chrysorrhoea, the gypsy mothLymantria dispar, and native insects such as the forest tent caterpillar Malacosoma disstria, the fall webworm Hyphantria cunea, and the spruce budworm Choristoneura fumiferana.|$|E
50|$|The {{wax coating}} on the fruit is indigestible for most birds, {{but a few}} species have adapted {{to be able to}} eat it, notably the yellow-rumped warbler and tree swallow in North America. As the wax is very energy-rich, this enables the yellow-rumped warbler to winter further north in cooler climates than any other American warbler if bayberries are present. The seeds are then {{dispersed}} in the birds' droppings. Myrica species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including <b>brown-tail,</b> emperor <b>moth,</b> and winter moth as well as the bucculatricid leaf-miners Bucculatrix cidarella, B. myricae (feeds exclusively on M. gale) and B. paroptila and the Coleophora case-bearers C. comptoniella, C. pruniella, and C. viminetella.|$|R
50|$|The foliage is {{sometimes}} eaten by the larvae of Lepidoptera, including emperor moth, willow beauty, white-pinion spotted, common emerald, November moth, pale November moth, mottled pug, green pug, brimstone <b>moth,</b> feathered thorn, <b>brown-tail,</b> yellow-tail, short-cloaked <b>moth,</b> lesser yellow underwing, lesser broad-bordered yellow underwing, double square-spot, black and brown hairstreaks, hawthorn moth (Scythropia crataegella) and the case-bearer moth Coleophora anatipennella. Dead blackthorn wood provides {{food for the}} caterpillars of the concealer moth Esperia oliviella.|$|R
50|$|Amelanchier {{plants are}} {{preferred}} browse for deer and rabbits, and heavy browsing pressure can suppress natural regeneration. Caterpillars of such Lepidoptera as brimstone <b>moth,</b> <b>brown-tail,</b> grey dagger, mottled umber, rough prominent, the satellite, winter moth, and the red-spotted purple {{and the white}} admiral (both Limenitis arthemis), as well as various other herbivorous insects feed on Amelanchier. Many insects and diseases that attack orchard trees also affect this genus, in particular trunk borers and Gymnosporangium rust. In years when late flowers of Amelanchier overlap those of wild roses and brambles, bees may spread bacterial fireblight.|$|R

This bulletin discusses the more important insects affecting deciduous shade trees in the western two-thirds of the United States {{with the exception of}} the gispy moth and the <b>brown-tail</b> <b>moth</b> and gives the remedies for them.

40|$|Euproctis chrysorrhoea is a pest of {{park and}} shade trees {{and of the}} public in the Benelux {{countries}} {{as well as in the}} northeastern United States and Canada. In the Benelux countries the <b>brown-tail</b> <b>moth</b> is present every year in the dune regions, where it mainly feeds on Hippophae rhamnoides. Hairs from the larvae are irritating to the human skin producing a papular urticaria. An outbreak of the caterpillars produced widespread discomfort at a beach in the Netherlands in 1982 following defoliation of food plants and migration of the larvae seeking food, with resulting human contact, as well as wind dispersal of the hairs...|$|E
40|$|Excerpt: This slim {{volume is}} easily {{one of the}} most {{attractive}} entomological reprints that has appeared to date. Most American entomologists are familiar with the story of the 2 ̆ 2 <b>brown-tail</b> <b>moth,</b> 2 ̆ 2 Nygmia phaeorrhoea Donovan, the European species which was introducted into Massachusetts in the 1890 s and became a serious pest in the northeastern United States and adjoining Canada until appropriate control measures were taken. The Brown-tail is a defoliator of forests, orchards and hedgerows, and as D. S. Fletcher explains in his entomological notes to this reprint, populations of the species periodically build up to epidemic levels and create havoc. Such an outbreak occurred near London in 1782, and caused widespread fear of a 2 ̆ 7 plague 2 ̆ 7...|$|E
