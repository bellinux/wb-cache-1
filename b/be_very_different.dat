5|$|Most {{countries}} require diving cylinders to {{be checked}} on a regular basis. This usually consists of an internal visual inspection and a hydrostatic test.

5|$|Cicero {{stated the}} twins {{objection}} (that with close birth times, personal outcomes can <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>different),</b> later developed by Saint Augustine. He argued {{that since the}} other planets are much more distant from the earth than the moon, they could have only very tiny influence compared to the moon's. He also argued that if astrology explains everything about a person's fate, then it wrongly ignores the visible effect of inherited ability and parenting, changes in health worked by medicine, or {{the effects of the}} weather on people.|$|E
5|$|Prior to Witten's announcement, string theorists had {{identified}} five versions of superstring theory. Although these theories appeared, at first, to <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>different,</b> work by several physicists {{showed that the}} theories were related in intricate and nontrivial ways. In particular, physicists found that apparently distinct theories could be unified by mathematical transformations called S-duality and T-duality. Witten's conjecture was {{based in part on}} the existence of these dualities and in part on the relationship of the string theories to a field theory called eleven-dimensional supergravity.|$|E
5|$|The {{alternative}} {{train of}} thought {{is that it was}} simply not advantageous to be large until the appearance of the Ediacarans: the environment favoured the small over the large. Examples of such scenarios today include plankton, whose small size allows them to reproduce rapidly to take advantage of ephemerally abundant nutrients in algal blooms. But for large size never to be favourable, the environment would have to <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> indeed.|$|E

5|$|Water megamasers and kilomasers {{are found}} {{primarily}} associated with active galactic nuclei, while galactic and weaker extragalactic water masers {{are found in}} star forming regions. Despite different environments, the circumstances that produce extragalactic water masers {{do not seem to}} <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> from those that produce galactic water masers. Observations of water megamasers have been used to make accurate measurements of distances to galaxies in order to provide constraints on the Hubble constant.|$|E
5|$|Eta Carinae {{is a close}} binary {{and this}} complicates the {{evolution}} of both stars. Compact massive companions can strip mass from larger primary stars {{much more quickly than}} would occur in a single star, so the properties at core collapse can <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>different.</b> In some scenarios, the secondary can accrue significant mass, accelerating its evolution, and in turn be stripped by the now compact Wolf–Rayet primary. In the case of Eta Carinae, the secondary is clearly causing additional instability in the primary, making it difficult to predict future developments.|$|E
5|$|In {{most cases}} the {{electrons}} are close enough to thermal equilibrium that their temperature is relatively well-defined, even {{when there is a}} significant deviation from a Maxwellian energy distribution function, for example, due to UV radiation, energetic particles, or strong electric fields. Because of the large difference in mass, the electrons come to thermodynamic equilibrium amongst themselves much faster than they come into equilibrium with the ions or neutral atoms. For this reason, the ion temperature may <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> from (usually lower than) the electron temperature. This is especially common in weakly ionised technological plasmas, where the ions are often near the ambient temperature.|$|E

5|$|Common {{agreement}} about the day's layout or schedule confers so many advantages that a standard DST schedule {{has generally been}} chosen over ad hoc efforts to get up earlier. The advantages of coordination are so great that many people ignore whether DST is in effect by altering their nominal work schedules to coordinate with television broadcasts or daylight. DST is commonly not observed during most of winter, because its mornings are darker; workers may have no sunlit leisure time, and children may need to leave for school in the dark. Since DST is applied to many varying communities, its effects may <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> depending on their culture, light levels, geography, and climate; {{that is why it}} is hard to make generalized conclusions about the absolute effects of the practice. Some areas may adopt DST simply as a matter of coordination with others rather than for any direct benefits.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{discovery}} of Titanics wreck, in addition to the common assumption that she had sunk in one piece, it had been widely believed that conditions at 12,000 feet down would preserve the ship virtually intact. The water is bitterly cold at only about , there is no light and the high pressure was thought to be likely to lower oxygen and salinity levels to the point that organisms {{would not be able to}} gain a foothold on the wreck. Titanic would effectively be in a deep freeze. The reality has turned out to <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>different,</b> and the ship has increasingly deteriorated since she sank in April 1912. Her gradual decay is due to a number of different processes– physical, chemical and biological. She is situated on an undulating, gently sloping area of seabed in Titanic Canyon which is swept by the Western Boundary Current. Eddies from the current flow constantly across the wreck, scouring the sea bed and keeping sediment from building up over the hull. The current is strong and often changeable, gradually opening up holes in the ship's hull. Salt corrosion eats away at the hull and it is also affected by galvanic corrosion.|$|E
5|$|The term {{attachment}} {{disorder is}} used to describe emotional and behavioral problems of young children, and also applied to school-age children, teenagers and adults. The specific difficulties implied depend on {{the age of the}} individual being assessed, and a child's attachment-related behaviors may <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> with one familiar adult than with another, suggesting that the disorder is within the relationship and interactions of the two people rather than an aspect of one or the other personality. No list of symptoms can legitimately be presented but generally the term attachment disorder refers to the absence or distortion of age appropriate social behaviors with adults. For example, in a toddler, attachment-disordered behavior could include a failure to stay near familiar adults in a strange environment or to be comforted by contact with a familiar person, whereas in a six-year-old attachment-disordered behavior might involve excessive friendliness and inappropriate approaches to strangers.|$|E

5|$|We {{consider}} {{the surface area}} of the entire mass of mercury, including {{the part of the}} surface that is in contact with the glass, because mercury does not adhere to glass at all. So the surface tension of the mercury acts over its entire surface area, including where it is in contact with the glass. If instead of glass, the tube was made out of copper, the situation would <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>different.</b> Mercury aggressively adheres to copper. So in a copper tube, the level of mercury {{at the center of the}} tube will be lower than at the edges (that is, it would be a concave meniscus). In a situation where the liquid adheres to the walls of its container, we {{consider the}} part of the fluid's surface area that is in contact with the container to have negative surface tension. The fluid then works to maximize the contact surface area. So in this case increasing the area in contact with the container decreases rather than increases the potential energy. That decrease is enough to compensate for the increased potential energy associated with lifting the fluid near the walls of the container.|$|E
