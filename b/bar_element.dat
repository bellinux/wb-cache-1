40|$|Abstract. In {{the process}} of {{preparing}} superfine wood-flour with physical method, when the size of wood-flour particle reaches to the corresponding level, a single wood cell will be destroyed. In {{the process of}} analyzing micro-nano wood-flour’s cutting power, the process of cell disruption of the wood cell needs to be computed. Based on the relevant theory of finite element and structural mechanics, this article builds a structure mode of 12 lever hexagon truss model to simulate the cellular structure. There are 6 levers outside to simulate the cell and 6 levers inside to simulate the internal pressure. This establishes a single cell stress model to analyze its stress. It can be obtained that when {{the size of the}} force acting on the node reaches the unit force, the minimum tensile stress of the <b>bar</b> <b>element</b> is bigger than the macroscopic tensile strength of the wood. According to the structural characteristics of the cell wall, this paper compares the tensile stress along the grain of the <b>bar</b> <b>element</b> with the tradition cutting stress.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{electromechanical}} processes of generation and damping of transient waves in bars with attached piezoelectric members. In particular, the influence of amplifier and electrical circuitry on the mechanical waves is of interest. A straight <b>bar</b> <b>element</b> containing piezoelectric members {{is viewed as a}} linear system with one electrical and two mechanical ports where it interacts with external electrical and mechanical devices through voltage, current, forces and velocities. For the modelling of the piezoelectric <b>bar</b> <b>element</b> (PBE) and its environment, coupled piezoelectric theory is used with allowance for the dynamics of the PBE and attached electrical and mechanical devices. Two applications are considered for a PBE that constitutes a part of a long bar, viz. generation and damping of extensional waves. In the first, simulations and experiments were performed when the PBE was driven by a power amplifier. In the second, simulations and experiments were performed when the PBE supplied an output voltage to an external load. In the case of wave generation, the influence of amplifier characteristics in terms of DC voltage gain, 3 dB cut-off frequency, output impedance and current constraints on the output voltage and current of the amplifier and the waves generated are studied. Further, generation of waves of prescribed shapes are studied for a specific amplifier. In general, good agreement between simulated and experimental results was obtained. In the case of wave damping, the influence of external electrical loads and incident waveforms on reflected and transmitted waves, and on gener-ated voltage, current, electrical power and dissipated energy, are studied. In general, fair agreement between simulated and experimental results was obtained.

40|$|A finite-element {{modeling}} {{approach has}} been used in this study to predict the nonlinear behavior and failure patterns of rectangular reinforced concrete structural walls. Efficiency of the model has been evaluated using experimental results of walls with different shear-span ratios, which failed in different modes. The walls are modeled in a finite-element analysis program. Reinforced concrete sections of the walls are represented by curved shell elements along with embedded <b>bar</b> <b>elements.</b> The plane sections are not enforced to remain plane in this type of model, and the in-plane axial-flexure-shear interaction can be simulated without requiring any empirical adjustment. The model is found to be able to reasonably capture the lateral load versus top displacement response of the specimens and predict most of the experimentally observed failure mechanisms of rectangular walls except bar buckling. The simulated failure patterns include shear, flexure, flexure-shear, and flexure-out-of-plane modes, and the failure to predict bar buckling was expected because of inherent deficiencies of embedded <b>bar</b> <b>elements</b> and limitations of material models available in the program. Moreover, the strain profile and crack pattern captured by the model are found to be in good agreement with experimental observations, indicating that in addition to the overall global response predictions, local behavior of the wall models can also be predicted reasonably well. © 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers...|$|R
