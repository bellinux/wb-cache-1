50|$|As {{the name}} suggests, the primary host is Prunus padus, the <b>Bird</b> <b>cherry</b> <b>tree</b> where R. padi overwinters as eggs in Europe. In Northern America, {{it is found}} to overwinter on Prunus virginiana (common choke-cherry). At spring, it attacks all major cereals and pasture grasses and {{particularly}} barley, oats and wheat and other Gramineae members. It {{can also be found}} in maize. It has a worldwide distribution.|$|E
30|$|Plants {{have the}} ability to {{synthesize}} aromatic secondary metabolites, like phenols, phenolic acids, quinones, flavones, flavonoids, flavonols, tannins, and coumarins (Cowan 1999). The components with phenolic structures, like carvacrol, eugenol, and thymol, are highly active against pathogens. Obtained findings are in agreement with Karavaev et al. (2002) who reported that the aqueous extracts from <b>bird</b> <b>cherry</b> <b>tree</b> Padus avium, aspen Populus tremula, and celandine Chelidonium majus effectively suppressed the P. triticina and antifungal activity was attributed to the high content of phenolic compounds in the leaves of these plants.|$|E

30|$|The {{underlying}} {{mechanisms of}} disease suppression by plant extracts are not clearly understood, but {{the involvement of}} induced resistance is considered (Fokkema 1993). In the present work, significant increases in POX and PPO recorded at the plant extract treatments were supported by Kumar et al. (2017). Karavaev et al. (2002) recorded a high POX activity in the wheat leaves treated with the aqueous extracts from <b>bird</b> <b>cherry</b> <b>tree,</b> Padus avium, aspen Populus tremula, and celandine Chelidonium majus, to suppress the P. triticina. Kumar et al. (2017) recorded the maximum PPO activity in L. camara-treated potato leaves. Also, willow aqueous extracts reduced the disease incidence of Fusarium wilt in tomato seedlings by inducing the activities of antioxidant defensive enzymes and decreasing the level of lipid peroxidation after 3 and 7 [*]days of infection (Farag et al. 2011).|$|E
40|$|October 2015 {{marks the}} 160 th {{anniversary of the}} birth of Ivan V. Michurin. As a {{scientist}} and plant breeder, he made a significant improvement of many fruit and berry plants, and flowers. He developed methods of plant breeding, especially regarding long-distance hybridisation of fruit plants, and promoted gardening to the north and east of Russia. He introduced some new berry species, such as Actinidia and black chokeberry, and was the first in Russia to use dwarf and semi dwarf stocks of apples. Michurin initiated the mass movement of gardeners and horticulture experimenters in USSR who changed and significantly extended the assortment and areas of fruit and berries cultivation in the country. He not only brought together a representative collection of species and varieties of fruit, berry and flower plants from around the world, but also used them in breeding by hybridization, including interspecific. He created some new artificial interspecific hybrids such as Cerapadus (cherry and <b>bird</b> <b>cherry</b> <b>tree</b> hybrid), and others. Michurin created 132 cultivars. Eleven of them are not only cultivated, but are also included in “The State Register of Protected Plant Breeding of the Russian Federation”...|$|E
30|$|Dormice {{preferred}} nest {{sites with}} a better-developed understory, particularly {{with a good}} cover of hazel shrubs taller than 4  m and plentiful <b>bird</b> <b>cherry</b> <b>trees,</b> a high diversity of woody plant species in the understory and overstory, and better connectivity of the nest tree with its surroundings. They avoided sites with {{a high number of}} mature Norway spruce trees in the canopy and a high density of young trees. In a stepwise multiple regression analysis, three vegetation parameters of the number of shrub species, the cover of hazel shrubs, and the number of Norway spruce trees in the canopy determined over 85 % of the index of nestbox use by M. avellanarius. The number of shrub species in the surroundings of the nest site had the highest impact of all. Nest sites used by dormice for breeding were distinguished by a better-developed understory, particularly by a significantly higher number of <b>bird</b> <b>cherry</b> <b>trees</b> and a lower number of Norway spruce trees in the canopy, as well as a higher diversity of plants in the understory and overstory.|$|R
30|$|The forest {{understory}} {{consists of}} shrubs and young trees, but {{the importance of}} these two groups is discrepant for M. avellanarius. Dormice avoided nest sites with the highest density of young trees. Young deciduous trees (e.g., lime or ash trees) grow vertically with few diagonal branches and are much less suitable for movement of M. avellanarius in a three-dimensional space compared to hazel shrubs and <b>bird</b> <b>cherry</b> <b>trees.</b> Although the index of nestbox use was positively related to the number of young black alder trees, the last parameter was positively inter-correlated with the total cover of hazel shrubs.|$|R
3000|$|When {{selecting}} nest {{sites for}} breeding, females of M. avellanarius seek greater safety and better feeding conditions {{compared to the}} remaining nest sites. Nest sites used by M. avellanarius for breeding were distinguished by a better-developed and more diverse understory. Nest sites used for breeding were characterized by a higher number of <b>bird</b> <b>cherry</b> <b>trees</b> in the understory, but a lower number of Norway spruce trees in the canopy and a lower cover of oak trees, both of which reduce understory cover. Around nestboxes used for breeding, {{the diversity of the}} overstory was also higher among common tree species, including the willow, Norway spruce, and pedunculate oak, which are important feeding plants for M. avellanarius (Juškaitis and Baltrūnaitė [...]...|$|R
30|$|In the {{stepwise}} {{multiple regression}} analysis, three vegetation parameters, namely {{the number of}} shrub species, the cover of hazel shrubs, {{and the number of}} Norway spruce trees in the canopy, determined over 85 % of the index of nestbox use by M. avellanarius. The number of shrub species {{in the vicinity of the}} nest site had the highest impact among these. Hazel (especially hazel shrubs taller than 4  m) and <b>bird</b> <b>cherry</b> were the most important understory species for M. avellanarius. Typically, hazel shrubs have several stems, which grow apart from each other and form a large distaff-shaped shrub. Every stem has several diagonal or nearly horizontal branches which are in contact with branches of other hazel shrubs or other trees. In this way, inter-communicating hazel shrubs form excellent routes for the movement of M. avellanarius in a three-dimensional space. Branchy <b>bird</b> <b>cherry</b> <b>trees</b> can also be used by M. avellanarius in the same way.|$|R
5000|$|The oldest written {{reference}} to Hyggen is from Aslak Bolts jordebok (1432-1433) a register of properties and incomes of the Archdiocese of Nidaros. The name {{has evolved over}} time; in 1400 Heggenni, Heggiunne and Hæggenne, Hegginna, in 1512 Hegien gorden, in 1617 Heggind and in 1723 Hyggen.

In his book Røyken Bygd - før og nu (1928), Oluf Rygh offered an alternative suggesting it was named after a small stream called Heggja or rather Hegg.|$|R
60|$|De Lescure was daily getting weaker; {{but still}} the weaker he got the less he suffered, and the more capable he became of {{assuming}} his accustomed benevolent demeanour and anxious care for others. Both {{he and his wife}} knew that he was approaching the term of his mortal sufferings; but others, and among them Henri was the most sanguine, still hoped that he would recover; and there certainly was nothing in his cheery manner On the morning of the wedding, to make any one think that such hopes were misplaced. The old Marquis was more sad and melancholy than he had used to be among his beloved <b>birds</b> and <b>cherry</b> <b>trees</b> at Durbellière; and, on this occasion, he was probably the saddest of the party, for {{he was the one who}} would have rejoiced the most that the wedding of his son should be an occasion of joy to relatives, servants, tenants, and the numerous neighbours among whom he had always lived with so much mutual affection.|$|R

Nevertheless he bore it well. At first he beseeched them to leave him and old Momont, among his <b>birds</b> and <b>cherry</b> <b>trees,</b> declaring that nothing that the blues could do to him would be to him so calamitous as his removal from the spot {{in which he had}} so long taken root. But his children soon made him understand that it was impossible that they could abandon him, a cripple as he was, unattended, and exposed to the certain fury of the republicans. He yielded, therefore, and when the sad day came, he blamed no one, as they lifted him into the huge carriage, in which he was removed to Chatillon. To the last he was proudly loyal to the King; and, as he was carried over the threshold of his door, he said, that if God would grant him another favour in this world, it would be, that he might return once more to his own home, to welcome there some scion of his royal master's house.|$|R
