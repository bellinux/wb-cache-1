5000|$|A large {{proportion}} of a semitrailer's weight {{is supported by a}} tractor unit, or a detachable front-axle assembly known as a dolly, or the tail of another trailer. A semitrailer is normally equipped with landing gear (legs which can be lowered) to support it when it is uncoupled. Many semitrailers have wheels that are capable of being totally dismounted and are also relocatable (repositionable) to better distribute load to <b>bearing</b> <b>wheel</b> weight factors. Semitrailers are more popular for transport than full trailers, which have both front and rear axles. Ease of backing is cited as one of the semi's chief advantages. A road tractor coupled to a semi-trailer is often called a semitrailer truck or [...] "semi" [...] in North America & Australia, and an articulated lorry or [...] "artic" [...] in the UK.|$|E
40|$|The major {{components}} of the RI 1170 gyroscope are described. A detailed functional description of the electronics including block diagrams and photographs of output waveshapes within the loop electronics are presented. An electronic data flow diagram is included. Those gyro subassemblies that were originally planned and subsequently changed or modified {{for one reason or}} another are discussed in detail. Variations to the original design included the capacitive pickoffs, torquer flexleads, magnetic suspension, gas bearings, electronic design, and packaging. The selection of components and changes from the original design and components selected are discussed. Device failures experienced throughout the program are reported and design corrections to eliminate the failure modes are noted. Major design deficiencies such as those of the MSE electronics are described in detail. Modifications made to the gas bearing parts and design improvements to the wheel are noted. Changes to the gas bearing prints are included as well as a mathematical analysis of the 1170 gas <b>bearing</b> <b>wheel</b> by computer analysis. The mean free-path effects on gas bearing performance is summarized...|$|E
40|$|Reaction and {{momentum}} wheels have become standard equipment for three-axis attitude stabilisation of conventional satellite classes as used e. g. for telecommunication and remote sensing missions. Owing to very compact mechanical designs and highly integrated electronics, wheels are now also {{more and more}} interesting for small satellites up to 100 … 200 kg with increasingly demanding requirements on attitude control. Wheels suitable for small satellites have a typical momentum capacity up to approximately 0. 4 Nms, and masses up to about 2 kg. All existing miniature wheels known to the authors are relying on ball bearings for rotor suspension, which may limit the lifetime of a particular mission or introduce undesired levels of micro-vibrations. Magnetic bearings {{have the potential to}} overcome those disadvantages. However, the design of a sufficiently small magnetic bearing with all the necessary components and sub-assemblies involves a number of technical challenges, which are discussed in detail. The paper focuses on the magnetic bearing design process, using magnetic field CAE tools, and the overall wheel design. A prototype of a compact magnetic <b>bearing</b> <b>wheel</b> currently under construction is presented. Moreover, control aspects of the magnetic bearing and the drive motor design will be described and an outlook for further improvements and potential future developments will be given...|$|E

50|$|Hudson was a {{major player}} in setting the {{standards}} for coal haulage. In the 1930s the introduction of practical locomotive haulage in coal mines demanded better wagons than the traditional plain bearing designs. Hudson introduced new designs with pressed steel corrugated bodies with roller <b>bearing</b> <b>wheels.</b> This style of vehicle was ultimately adopted by the National Coal Board as its standard coal haulage vehicle.|$|R
50|$|In 1974, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in {{collaboration}} with the Swiss watch industry standards organization NIHS: Normes de l'Industrie Horlogère Suisse published a standard, ISO 1112, which prohibited manufacturers from including such nonfunctional jewels in the jewel counts in advertising and sales literature. This put a stop to the use of totally nonfunctional jewels. However, some experts say manufacturers have continued to inflate the jewel count of their watches by 'upjeweling'; adding functional jeweled <b>bearings</b> to <b>wheels</b> that do not really need them, exploiting loopholes in ISO 1112. Examples given include adding capstones to third and fourth <b>wheel</b> <b>bearings,</b> jeweling minute <b>wheel</b> <b>bearings,</b> and automatic winding ratchet pawls. Arguably none of these additions adds to the accuracy or longevity of the watch.|$|R

50|$|Although the Aerostar used a {{dedicated}} platform, {{it was designed}} {{with a high degree}} of parts commonality with other Ford light-truck products of the time (initially, the Ford Ranger/Bronco II and the later Ford Explorer/Mazda Navajo). Components such as the brake rotors, axle <b>bearings,</b> <b>wheels</b> were all interchangeable and essentially any light-truck powertrain and suspension upgrades were also available to the Aerostar. One notable exception is that the Aerostar's rear suspension was designed with a 3-link coil spring rear suspension with a live rear axle. This rear suspension design was similar to that used by the Ford LTD Crown Victoria and Fox-body Mustang.|$|R

40|$|Magnetic {{suspensions}} offer {{several advantages}} over conventional bearings, arising {{because of the}} contactless nature of the load support. In application to spacecraft reaction wheels, the advantages are low drag torque, wearfree, unlubricated, vacuum-compatible operation, and unlimited life. By the provision of redundancy in the control electronics, single-point failures are eliminated. The rational for selection of a passive radial, active axial, dc magnetic suspension is presented, and {{the relative merits of}} 3 -loop and single-loop magnetic suspensions are discussed.

50|$|In {{a ground}} vehicle with a suspension, the {{unsprung}} mass (or the unsprung weight) is {{the mass of}} the suspension, wheels or tracks (as applicable), and other components directly connected to them, rather than supported by the suspension.

Unsprung mass includes the mass of components such as the <b>wheel</b> axles, <b>wheel</b> <b>bearings,</b> <b>wheel</b> hubs, tires, and a portion of the weight of driveshafts, springs, shock absorbers, and suspension links. If the vehicle's brakes are mounted outboard (i.e., within the wheel), their mass (weight) is also considered part of the unsprung mass.|$|R
