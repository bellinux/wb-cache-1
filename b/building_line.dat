2500|$|The atrium {{beginning}} at the <b>building</b> <b>line,</b> became instead a gabled roof extruded beyond the building facade and stepping back to its seven-story peak.

Lowertown's Weiming Lu and the city planning staff stood fast for the standard Vierendeel truss and bronze aluminum. Galtier Plaza opened in 1986.|$|E

2500|$|The first {{stone of}} the chapel was laid by the King on St James' Day, 25 July 1446. [...] However, within a decade Henry's {{engagement}} in the Wars of the Roses meant that funds began to dry up. By the time of Henry's deposition in 1461, the chapel walls had been raised 60ft high at the east end but only 8ft at the west; a <b>building</b> <b>line</b> which can still be seen today as {{the boundary between the}} lighter stone below and the darker above. Work proceeded sporadically until a generation later in 1508 when the Founder's nephew Henry VII was prevailed upon to finish the shell of the building. The interior had to wait a further generation until completion by 1544 with the aid of Henry VIII. [...] The chapel would be the only part of Henry VI's Founder's Will to be realised.|$|E
2500|$|On January 20, 1926, borough {{president}} Miller sent a {{plan for}} an $11 million elevated highway to be built completely on city property to the Board of Estimate. The elevated railroad {{was removed from the}} plan, since NYCRR had come up with a separate project for partially elevating and depressing their railroad (now known as the High Line). According to Miller, there were questions over who would own and maintain the dual structure. There were also objections to its height of 40 feet (12 m) and its placement at the east <b>building</b> <b>line</b> of the existing surface roads. The elevated highway was to connect to a planned parkway (now the Henry Hudson Parkway) at 72nd Street, forming a highway free from cross traffic stretching from Canal Street to 129th Street. The elevated road was to be 60 feet (18 m) wide, wide enough for six lanes of traffic; the existing surface road would carry local traffic beneath the highway. Ramps would be provided at Canal Street, Christopher Street, 14th Street, 23rd Street, 34th Street, 42nd Street, and 57th Street. Slow-moving traffic would use the left lanes, due to the left-hand ramps. This contrasts with the current method of using the left lane for passing and putting ramps on the right side, and to the method popular around the 1950s of putting ramps on whichever side was easier. The highway would [...] "carry buses that will make both its conveniences and its beauties available to the general public", according to Miller. He suggested Hudson River Boulevard for the name of the highway.|$|E
