5|$|Wellington quickly {{changed his}} plans after seeing his flank attack fail. He {{converted}} his holding attack with the 3rd and 6th Divisions into a head on assault. The new assault began around 11:30 am. The British commander sent every available unit against the French right flank and center. He held back only 2/95th Foot and 3/95th Foot, the Portuguese 3rd Caçadores Battalion and the 17th Line Infantry Regiment from the Light Division. The brigades of Ross and Vasconcellos were withdrawn {{and replaced by}} the 7th Division. The struggle for Saint-Boès broke out anew when Walker's division and William Anson's brigade of 4th Division attacked, supported by two British artillery batteries firing from the church knoll. Four battalions attacked in the center led by the 6th Foot. Two battalions were deployed {{to the left and}} John Milley Doyle's Portuguese brigade was on the right. Taupin's tired soldiers, who had <b>been</b> <b>fighting</b> <b>for</b> about four hours, were driven back behind the Plassotte knoll where they rallied.|$|E

25|$|With the Regeneración (Regeneration) {{period and}} the {{creation}} of the 1886 constitution, the centralist regime only managed to aggravate the political problems. The governments of some departments soon began to complain about these problems to the central government. Poor political decisions also resulted in economic problems.

Murk, the war-profiteer who did not fight and who instead made a fortune from the fighting, and who attempts to steal the soldier's fiancée, symbolizes that feeling by the working class of having been cheated.|$|E
25|$|Following the Grey Cup victory, Garcia {{was signed}} as a backup to Steve Young with the San Francisco 49ers of the National Football League.

25|$|A {{period of}} peace {{followed}} and, in 674, Wamba rebuilt the Roman walls around Toledo. He also fortified other sites about this time, possibly Hondarribia (Fuenterrabia), {{a small village}} in Spain facing the French border over the Txingurri bay, as a military thrust along the Bay of Biscay up to the Pyrenees is attested to in contemporary sources. Wamba brought the Astures and Ruccones (Luggones) under his control and incorporated them into a new province. They had <b>been</b> <b>fighting</b> <b>for</b> their independence since the Visigothic invasions of the 5th century but now finally relented.|$|E

25|$|Ormonde's Royalists {{still held}} most of Munster, but were outflanked by a mutiny {{of their own}} {{garrison}} in Cork. The British Protestant troops there had <b>been</b> <b>fighting</b> <b>for</b> the Parliament up to 1648 and resented fighting with the Irish Confederates. Their mutiny handed Cork and most of Munster to Cromwell and they defeated the local Irish garrison at the Battle of Macroom. The Irish and Royalist forces retreated behind the River Shannon into Connacht or (in {{the case of the}} remaining Munster forces) into the fastness of Kerry.|$|E
25|$|What's Going On is {{a concept}} album {{consisting}} of nine songs, most of which segue into the next. It has been categorized as a song cycle; the album ends with a reprise of the album's opening theme. The story is told {{from the point of}} view of a Vietnam veteran returning to the country he had <b>been</b> <b>fighting</b> <b>for,</b> and seeing only hatred, suffering, and injustice. Gaye's introspective lyrics discuss themes of drug abuse, poverty, and the Vietnam War. He has also been credited with promoting awareness of global warming before the public outcry against it had become prominent.|$|E

As of 2012, Los Zetas are thought to be Mexico's largest criminal organization. Drug violence involving the Sinaloa and Gulf Cartels escalated in 2003, when the city was controlled by the Gulf Cartel. 2012 has seen an unprecedented series of mass murder attacks in the city between the Sinaloa Cartel and Gulf Cartel on one side and Los Zetas on the other.|$|E

It {{was thought that}} Humabon and Lapu–Lapu had <b>been</b> <b>fighting</b> <b>for</b> control of the flourishing trade in the area. On 27 April the Battle of Mactan {{occurred}} where the Spaniards were defeated and Magellan killed by the natives of Mactan in Mactan Island. According to Italian historian and chronicler, Antonio Pigafetta, Magellan's body was never recovered despite efforts to trade for it with spice and jewels. Magellan's second-in-command, Juan Sebastián Elcano took his place as captain of the expedition and sailed their fleet back to Spain, circumnavigating the world.|$|E
25|$|He {{spent most}} of his career at the newly founded Dominican priory at Hereford. The Dominicans had <b>been</b> <b>fighting</b> <b>for</b> a {{foothold}} here for eighty years against the resistance of the Dean and Chapter, before they were finally established under the patronage of Edward II in 1322. Bromyard must therefore have been among the first friars to join the fledgeling priory. In an age when manuscript books were prohibitively expensive, it is likely that he embarked on the task of compiling preaching aids as a means of providing the priory with a library to support its preaching mission. The sheer volume of his work suggests that it may well have been produced by a collaborative process involving the other friars at the Hereford priory, with Bromyard acting as editor in chief.|$|E
25|$|Since 1562 France {{had been}} in the grip of the French Wars of Religion, in which Spain had {{regularly}} intervened in favour of the Catholic League of France. King Henry IV of France (French: Henri de Bourbon) had <b>been</b> <b>fighting</b> <b>for</b> the protestant cause, but in 1594 had converted to Catholicism in Paris on March 22nd 1593. The example of Paris was followed by other towns and cities with several chiefs of the League came over to the king. Henry now directed his chief attention to the fortified towns of Picardy and Champagne from their contiguity to the Spanish Netherlands. From there he received the forced or voluntary submission of the most considerable and at last began to think seriously of his engagements to Elizabeth I of England.|$|E

25|$|Shortly {{after the}} 1968 Olympics, Čáslavská married runner Josef Odložil, {{who had been}} a silver {{medalist}} at the 1964 Olympics in Tokyo. The ceremony, which took place at the Mexico City Cathedral, drew a crowd of thousands. They had a son, Martin, and daughter, Radka. The couple divorced in 1987. In 1993, her son and ex-husband were involved in an altercation with Martin allegedly punching Josef; he fell to the floor and struck his head, leading to his death. Čáslavská became depressed and was rarely seen in public afterwards. Martin Odložil was convicted of causing his father's death but was granted a pardon by Václav Havel in 1997. Čáslavská eventually overcame her depression (which she had <b>been</b> <b>fighting</b> <b>for</b> about 15 years), and returned to both social and sports lives, coaching younger gymnasts.|$|E
25|$|The {{ramifications of}} the tsunami went beyond the {{immediate}} impact to the lives and infrastructure of the Acehnese living on the coast. Since the disaster, the Acehnese rebel movement GAM, which had <b>been</b> <b>fighting</b> <b>for</b> independence against the Indonesian authorities for 29 years, has signed a peace deal (15 August 2005). The perception that the tsunami was punishment for insufficient piety in this proudly Muslim province is partly behind the increased emphasis {{on the importance of}} religion post-tsunami. This has been most obvious in the increased implementation of Sharia law, including the introduction of the controversial 'WH' or Syariah police. As homes are being built and people's basic needs are met, the people are also looking {{to improve the quality of}} education, increase tourism, and develop responsible, sustainable industry. Well-qualified educators are in high demand in Aceh.|$|E
25|$|Since her son’s {{death in}} the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, Ding Zilin has <b>been</b> <b>fighting</b> <b>for</b> justice for the victims. Her {{activism}} has drawn international attention and association with recognizable human rights groups such as Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and HRIC (Human Rights in China). New York based human rights watchdog HRIC has been labelled by the Chinese government as a hostile organization. Because of Ding Zilins efforts Amnesty International has a political campaign {{to put pressure on}} the Chinese government to acknowledge and apologize for the deaths of so many citizens. Amnesty applauded the Chinese government in June 2007 for allowing Ding Zilin, her husband and two other dead citizens’ kin to light candles west of Tiananmen Square. Despite the minimal recognition from the government Amnesty urges Chinese authorities to allow open debate and more public memorials in order to help improve Chinas human rights record and the image of Beijing on the international stage. Ding Zilin and human rights groups demand the Chinese government to stop labelling the student protest with political jargon such as “counter-revolutionary rebellion”.|$|E
