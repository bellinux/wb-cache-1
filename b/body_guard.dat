5|$|Following the mutiny of the French Guards a {{few hours}} before the {{storming}} of the Bastille, the only troops immediately available for the security of the palace at Versailles were the aristocratic Garde du Corps (<b>Body</b> <b>Guard)</b> and the Cent-Suisses (Hundred Swiss). Both were primarily ceremonial units and lacked the numbers and training to provide effective protection for the royal family and the government. Accordingly, the Flanders Regiment (a regular infantry regiment of the Royal Army) was ordered to Versailles in late September 1789 by the king's minister of war, the Comte de Saint-Priest, as a precautionary measure. On 1 October, the officers at Versailles held a welcoming banquet for the officers of the new troops, a customary practice when a unit changed its garrison. The royal family briefly attended the affair, walking amongst the tables set up in the opera house of the palace. Outside, in the cour de marbre (central courtyard), the soldiers' toasts and oaths of fealty to the king grew more demonstrative as the night wore on.|$|E

This unit was later disbanded in 1810, however, following the departure of the New South Wales Corps and the arrival of regular British infantry regiments, while the Governor's <b>Body</b> <b>Guard</b> was eventually amalgamated with the Mounted Police in the mid-1840s, before eventually being disbanded in 1860.|$|E

25|$|A punch {{that makes}} {{contact with the}} opponent's hogu (the <b>body</b> <b>guard</b> that {{functions}} as a scoring target) scores one one point, while a kick scores two points. (The trunk protector {{is referred to as}} a momtong pohodae 몸통 보호대 or trunk guard in the WT rules.) If a kick to the hogu involves a technique that includes fully turning the attacking competitor's body, so that the back is fully exposed to the targeted competitor during execution of the technique (spinning kick), three points are awarded. A kick to the head scores three points; as of October 2010 an additional point is awarded if a turning kick was used to execute this attack, making a spinning head kick worth 4 points. Punches to the head are not allowed. As of October 2017, no additional points are awarded for knocking down an opponent (beyond the normal points awarded for legal strikes).|$|E
25|$|The {{walls of}} the Memorial Chamber are divided into 17 niches {{designed}} by Ira Lake and A. Fortescue Duguid. Each contain a marble slab under a gothic blind arch topped with a gablet and finial, and decorated with various badges and insignia, including those of, on the mouldings: Canada's 178 pre-1914 militia regiments; in the pierced quatrefoil panels: cavalry, and non-infantry field units; in the diaper background: pre-Confederation French and British regiments and colonial forces; on the gablet crockets: reinforced battalions; on the gablet springers: all branches of the Canadian Corps; on the arch quatrefoil and cusps: Badges and insignia of Canada's 178 pre-1914 militia regiments: The Royal Canadian Dragoons, Lord Strathcona's Horse (Royal Canadians), The Governor General's <b>Body</b> <b>Guard,</b> 1st Hussars, 2nd Dragoons, 3rd The Prince of Wales' Canadian Dragoons; on the arch spandrels: medals and war decorations of the allied countries; on the shield: coats of arms appropriate to the relevant historical context; and on the low relief panel: historical scenes of Canadians during World War I. The marble panels themselves originally described the various campaigns and battles in the theatres of war between 1914 and 1918. These, however, were replaced in 1982 with panels illustrating the Canadian Forces' engagements from the Fenian Raids to the Korean War, along with excerpts from the Bible, poems, and other literature.|$|E
500|$|Activity was {{happening}} {{elsewhere on the}} field, however, and as the battle drew to a close, Napoleon's Middle Guard launched {{an assault on the}} British line, to the 52nd's left, and were met by a number of regiments including the 1st Foot Guards, who repulsed the 3rd Chasseurs, but had to themselves retreat when the 4th Chasseurs moved forward to threaten their left. The 52nd, under Sir John Colborne, wheeled to the left, deploying parallel to the French column, and fired volleys against their left flank. William Hay, a Light Dragoon watching from the right, later recalled that [...] "so well-directed a fire was poured in, that down the bank the Frenchmen fell and, I may say, the battle of Waterloo was gained." [...] Seeing the 52nd begin an advance, Wellington reputedly ordered [...] "Go on, Colborne, they won't stand!"; the battalion then advanced diagonally across the field. When this was later followed by a bayonet charge by all of General Adam's 3rd Brigade, the Guard broke, forced into full retreat. Having pursued the French down the escarpment of Mont St Jean, the 52nd crossed the valley floor (that {{at the start of the}} battle had separated the armies) and on the other side attacked a square of Old Guard (part of the personal <b>body</b> <b>guard</b> of Napoleon,) that had formed up to the British right of the inn La Belle Alliance and forced it to retreat.|$|E

2500|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th {{century the}} Swedish working class still lacked {{representation}} in the Parliament and the City Council.

[...] To avoid the demonstration prohibition from 1848, people gathered on various locations to unite on the square. [...] As they run across MPs and other bigwigs on Slottsbacken, they were stopped by the police from reaching the square. [...] Surrounding alleys quickly got clogged by demonstrators, however, and the cordon had to give way to the crowd whose cries and protest songs quickly filled the square. [...] The future PM Hjalmar Branting got involved in a dispute before the crowd threatened to intrude the Stock Exchange Build from Trångsund. [...] The police then got assistance from the Royal <b>Body</b> <b>Guard</b> who had demonstrators flee into the alleys to escape the horses and sabres. [...] Dozens got arrested, but a consequence of the manifestation was a growing awareness among politicians concerning the situation of the working force.|$|E
