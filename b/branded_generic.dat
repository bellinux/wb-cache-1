40|$|Class of 2016 AbstractObjectives: To {{describe}} {{the prices of}} <b>brand</b> versus <b>generic</b> OTC drug products {{in a variety of}} pharmacies and to compare the differences in lower income areas. Subjects: Over-the-counter products available in both <b>brand</b> and house <b>generic</b> forms in all pharmacies. House generic was defined as a line of products sold strictly by a company and its affiliates. Methods: Prices were collected across one week from all stores and locations, in each identical product. Once all the data was collected for the <b>brand</b> and <b>generic</b> medications, the data was evaluated using t tests. Results: The house <b>generic</b> <b>brands</b> (mean = 6. 21) were significantly cheaper (p= 2. 14 x 10 ^- 23) than the brand products (mean = 10. 84). Also, generic drug prices are significantly cheaper at grocery stores (p= 2. 19 x 10 ^- 11). Lastly, The price differences in all four areas were not significantly different in each of the <b>brand</b> and <b>generic</b> calculations (p= 0. 837 and p= 0. 910, respectively).

This paper empirically investigates the optimal levels of <b>brand</b> and <b>generic</b> advertising in a dynamic differentiated product oligopoly. A nested logit demand system incorporating <b>brand</b> and <b>generic</b> advertising goodwill stocks is specified and estimated without imposing any supply-side restrictions. Demand side parameters are then used to calibrate a dynamic game of <b>brand</b> and <b>generic</b> advertising that takes into account the vertical relationship between manufacturers and retailers. Estimates from the fluid milk product category indicate that brand advertising is effective for increasing brand level demand and generic advertising has a differential effect on individual brands. On the supply side, we found that it is not optimal for brand manufacturers to advertise in the presence of generic advertising.

40|$|This {{observational}} study investigates the private sector, retail pharmaceutical market of 19 low and {{middle income countries}} (LMICs) in Latin America, Asia and the Middle East/South Africa analyzing the relationships between volume market share of generic and originator medicines over a time series from 2001 to 2011. Over 5000 individual pharmaceutical substances were divided into generic (unbranded generic, <b>branded</b> <b>generic</b> medicines) and originator categories for each country, including the United States as a comparator. In 9 selected LMICs, the market share of those originator substances with the largest decrease over time was compared to the market share of their counterpart generic versions. Generic medicines (<b>branded</b> <b>generic</b> plus unbranded generic) represent between 70 and 80 % of market share {{in the private sector}} of these LMICs which exceeds that of most European countries. <b>Branded</b> <b>generic</b> medicine market share is higher than that of unbranded generics in all three regions and this is in contrast to the U. S. Although switching from an originator to its generic counterpart can save money, this narrative in reality is complex at the level of individual medicines. In some countries, the market behavior of some originator medicines that showed the most temporal decrease, showed switching to their generic counterpart. In other countries such as in the Middle East/South Africa and Asia, the loss of these originators was not accompanied by any change at all in market share of the equivalent generic version. For those countries with a significant increase in generic medicines market share and/or with evidence of comprehensive "switching" to generic versions, notably in Latin America, it would be worthwhile to establish cause-effect relationships between pharmaceutical policies and uptake of generic medicines. The absence of change in the generic medicines market share in other countries suggests that, at a minimum, generic medicines have not been strongly promoted...|$|E

Design/methodology/approach - A data set containing 243 weeks of scanned sales for 21 <b>generic</b> <b>brands</b> was used in a regression model aimed at measuring the effectiveness of each brand's defence strategies in deterring entry and limiting the market share of these <b>generic</b> <b>brands.</b> 			Findings - The analysis shows that several marketing mix components were effective in limiting the impact of <b>generic</b> <b>brands.</b> What was critical to each component's success was ensuring that they were implemented before the launch of the <b>generic</b> <b>brands.</b> Research limitations/implications - This research has the limitation of being confined to a category of pharmaceutical allergy brands, which limits generalisation of the findings.
