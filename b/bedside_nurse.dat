50|$|Lambertsen {{was born}} in 1916 in Fanwood, New Jersey. She had two brothers. Lambertsen began her career in nursing in the 1930s, working as a <b>bedside</b> <b>nurse</b> while {{studying}} at Overlook Hospital. She graduated from the hospital in 1938. Lambertsen was named the school's director of its nursing department five years later, and became its acting director in 1946. She earned a bachelor of science degree in 1949, later a bachelor's in the following year, and became a Doctor of Education in 1957 from Teachers College, Columbia University. Her dissertation brought forward an idea of team nursing called Nursing Team Organization and Functioning. It was published as a book by Teachers College Press in 1953. The result led to Lambertsen leading a dissertation project at Francis Delafield Hospital which attracted many hospital administrators from across the United States who wanted to pursue the reorganization of their staff.|$|E

40|$|A prospective, {{descriptive}} study {{was used to}} assess the diagnostic validity of the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) administered at the <b>bedside</b> by <b>nurses</b> in daily practice. Two different scoring methods of the CAM (the specific (SPEC) and sensitive (SENS) methods) were compared with a criterion standard (CAM completed by trained research nurses). During a 5 -month period, all patients consecutively admitted to an acute geriatric ward of the University Hospitals of Leuven (Belgium) were enrolled in the study. The 258 elderly inpatients who were included underwent 641 paired but independent ratings of delirium by bedside and trained research nurses. Delirium was identified in 36 of the 258 patients (14 %) or in 42 of the 641 paired observations (6. 5 %). The SENS method of the CAM algorithm as administered by <b>bedside</b> <b>nurses</b> had the greatest diagnostic accuracy, with 66. 7 % sensitivity and 90. 7 % specificity; the SPEC method had 23. 8 % sensitivity and 97. 7 % specificity. <b>Bedside</b> <b>nurses</b> had difficulties recognizing the features of acute onset, fluctuation, and altered level of consciousness. For both scoring methods, <b>bedside</b> <b>nurses</b> had difficulties with the identification of elderly patients with delirium but succeeded in diagnosing correctly those patients without delirium in more than 90 % of observations.

40|$|Background:The Delirium Observation Screening Scale (DOS) is {{designed}} to detect delirium by nurses' observations and has shown good psychometric properties. Its use in palliative care unit patients has not been studied. Aim:To determine diagnostic and concurrent validity, internal consistency, and user-friendliness of the Delirium Observation Screening Scale administered by <b>bedside</b> <b>nurses</b> in palliative care unit patients. Design:In this descriptive study, {{psychometric properties of the}} Delirium Observation Screening Scale were tested by comparing the performance on the Delirium Observation Screening Scale (<b>bedside</b> <b>nurses)</b> to the algorithm of the Confusion Assessment Method and the Delirium Index (DI) (researchers). Paired observations were collected on three time points. Afterward, the user-friendliness of the Delirium Observation Screening Scale was determined by <b>bedside</b> <b>nurses</b> using a questionnaire. Setting/participants:In total, 48 patients were recruited from one palliative care unit (PCU) of a university hospital. Of the 14 eligible <b>bedside</b> <b>nurses</b> of the palliative care unit, 10 participated in the study. Results:Delirium was present in 22. 9 % of patients. Diagnostic validity of the Delirium Observation Screening Scale was very good (area under the curve = 0. 933), with 81. 8 % sensitivity, 96. 1 % specificity, 69. 2 % positive, and 98 % negative predictive value. Concurrent validity of the Delirium Observation Screening Scale with the Delirium Index was moderate (rSpearman = 0. 53, p = 0. 001). The Cronbach's alpha for all Delirium Observation Screening Scale shift scores was 0. 772. Generally, <b>bedside</b> <b>nurses</b> experienced the Delirium Observation Screening Scale as user-friendly. However, most Delirium Observation Screening Scale items (n = 11 / 13 items) need verbally active patients to perform the observations correctly. Conclusion:The Delirium Observation Screening Scale can be used for delirium screening in verbally active palliative care unit patients. The scale was rated as easy to use and relevant. Further validation studies in this population are required. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Aim: To {{share an}} {{experience}} of introducing a ward round checklist, a <b>bedside</b> <b>nurse</b> verbal summary {{and the development of}} standard operating procedure for Ward Rounds in cardiothoracic critical care unit to improve patient safety and care. Background: Francis (2013) described inconsistent ward rounds and failures to conduct ward rounds properly as contributing factors to the poor care seen at the Mid Staffordshire Foundation Trust. He suggested that the absence of a nurse at the bedside had clear consequences for communication, ward round efficiency and patient safety. He recommended that nurses should be actively involved in ward rounds and linked this to high quality patient care. Design and methods: Semi structured interviews of six registered nurses. A questionnaire to 69 registered nurses. An electronic questionnaire sent to 23 members of the MDT. An observational audit of seven ward rounds reviewing 69 patients. Results: 97 % of nurses agreed that verbal summarizing had improved clarity and 90 % felt that it had improved patient care. 87 % of the MDT respondents stated that they had noticed an improvement in the attendance of the <b>bedside</b> <b>nurse</b> at the ward round review. The ward round checklist reduced omissions. Communication with patients during ward rounds was an area which needed to be improved. Conclusions: The introduction of a new ward round approach and audit of its practice has enabled an improvement in the quality of patient care by: Giving more opportunity for the nurse to participate and feel part of the ward round. Reduction of omissions {{through the use of a}} ward round checklist. Improved clarity among the MDT by the use of <b>bedside</b> <b>nurse</b> verbal summarizing of the plan of care.

30|$|The most {{extensively}} studied {{instrument is}} the CAM-ICU, which was validated to assess delirium {{at the bedside}} in nonverbal ventilated ICU patients [41]. Using a structured format, this tool evaluates four features, namely, acute onset or fluctuating course, inattention, disorganized thinking, and altered level of consciousness. When administered by <b>bedside</b> <b>nurses</b> with no formal psychiatric training, the CAM-ICU demonstrated high accuracy (sensitivity of 93 % to 100 % and specificity of 98 % to 100 %) and interrater reliability (K = 0.96) in a single-center study [10]. In another study, the CAM-ICU was systematically applied by <b>bedside</b> <b>nurses</b> in the ICU during an implementation process that involved training of the nurses. The agreement between the assessment from <b>bedside</b> <b>nurses</b> and a research staff rater was low at baseline but very high during the implementation process [42]. However, subsequent {{studies have shown that}} the CAM-ICU has a more modest sensitivity ranging from 64 % to 81 %, whereas the specificity remains high ranging from 88 % to 98 % [33, 43, 44]. In a more recent study, CAM-ICU had a high specificity (98 %) but a rather low sensitivity (47 %) [45]. The contrast between the latter study and others [42, 46] may stem from different implementation processes, that is, different approaches to training and education of providers applying the tool.|$|R

40|$|Patient {{and nurse}} {{interaction}} in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) influences patient recovery, care and outcome [1 - 3].

However, other than verbal inter-rater agreement, no statistical reliability testing was performed, and data were not collected for this purpose. Finally, the need for intervention to improve congruence of parenchymal and ventricular ICP may be linked more to the skill level and experience of the <b>bedside</b> <b>nurse</b> in managing device technology than to device capability.
