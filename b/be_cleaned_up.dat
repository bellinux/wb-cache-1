5|$|Westchester's postwar {{development}} {{led to more}} stormwater runoff, {{which often}} flooded and closed the parkway. By 1958, engineers were urging that the river <b>be</b> <b>cleaned</b> <b>up</b> to reduce flooding. Still, illegal dumping and overflows continued. For example, storm runoff gave the Yonkers section the river's highest concentrations of heavy metals, PCBs, and other chemicals, {{according to a study}} of the river in 1983, the year the city stopped using the Saw Mill as its primary water source. A decade later, the sediment in the Saw Mill had the highest concentration of metals in the United States Geological Survey's entire water-quality assessment program.|$|E

5|$|The third {{match on}} the card was a Straight Edge Society pledge vs. hair match, between CM Punk and Rey Mysterio. For this match, the other Straight Edge Society members (Serena and Luke Gallows) were banned from ringside. Early on in the match, Punk threw Mysterio headfirst {{out of the ring}} into the barber chair at ringside. Punk had {{suffered}} a cut to the head prior to the exchange, and while Mysterio was on the floor, the match was halted so that the blood could <b>be</b> <b>cleaned</b> <b>up.</b> While Punk's wound was being attended, he dropkicked Mysterio, who was on the ring apron, and began attacking him on the floor to restart the match. After Mysterio missed a splash from the top rope, Punk went to pin him, but Mysterio was able to perform a crucifix cradle on Punk for the victory. The other Straight Edge Society members attacked Mysterio after the match, but he was saved by Kane, which allowed Mysterio to handcuff Punk to the ring ropes and shave his head.|$|E

25|$|It is {{a common}} {{practice}} for professional footballers (soccer) and road cyclists to remove leg hair {{for a number of}} reasons. In the case of a crash or tackle, the absence of the leg hair means the injuries (usually road rash or scarring) can <b>be</b> <b>cleaned</b> <b>up</b> more efficiently, and treatment is not impeded. Professional cyclists as well as professional footballers also receive regular leg massages, and the absence of hair reduces the friction and increases their comfort and effectiveness.|$|E

25|$|The Afton {{community}} of Warren County, North Carolina {{is one of}} the most prominent environmental injustice cases and is often pointed to as the roots of the environmental justice movement. PCB's were illegally dumped into the community and then it eventually became a PCB landfill. Community leaders pressed the state for the site to <b>be</b> <b>cleaned</b> <b>up</b> for an entire decade until it was finally detoxified. However, this decontamination did not return the site to its pre-1982 conditions. There has been a call for reparations to the community which has not yet been met.|$|E
25|$|As is {{the case}} when moving APL {{programs}} from one vendor's APL interpreter to another, APL programs invariably will require changes to their content. Depending on the compiler, variable declarations might be needed, certain language features {{would need to be}} removed or avoided, or the APL programs would need to <b>be</b> <b>cleaned</b> <b>up</b> in some way. Some features of the language, such as the execute function (an expression evaluator) and the various reflection and introspection functions from APL, such as the ability to return a function's text or to materialize a new function from text, are simply not practical to implement in machine code compilation.|$|E
25|$|As {{transportation}} improved, {{poverty in}} New York diminished, and street lighting made for safer travel at night, {{the number of}} potential patrons for {{the growing number of}} theatres increased enormously. Plays could run longer and still draw in the audiences, leading to better profits and improved production values. As in England, during {{the latter half of the}} century, the theatre began to <b>be</b> <b>cleaned</b> <b>up,</b> with less prostitution hindering the attendance of the theatre by women. Gilbert and Sullivan's family-friendly comic opera hits, beginning with H.M.S. Pinafore in 1878, were imported to New York (by the authors and also in numerous unlicensed productions). They were imitated in New York by American productions such as Reginald Dekoven's Robin Hood (1891) and John Philip Sousa's El Capitan (1896), along with operas, ballets and other British and European hits.|$|E

25|$|On the {{borrowing}} end, after 10–20 years, the S 500 corporations {{become extremely}} accustomed to obtaining funds via these money markets, {{which are very}} stable. Initially, perhaps they only borrowed in these markets for a highly seasonal cash needs, being a net borrower for only say 90 days per year. They would borrow here as they experienced their deepest cash needs over an operating cycle to temporarily finance short-term build ups in inventory and receivables. Or, they moved to this funding market from a former bank revolving line of credit, that was guaranteed {{to be available to}} them as they needed it, but had to <b>be</b> <b>cleaned</b> <b>up</b> to a zero balance for at least 60 days out of the year. In these situations the corporations had sufficient other equity and debt financing for all of their regular capital needs. They were however dependent on these sources to be available to them, as needed, on an immediate daily basis.|$|E
25|$|The city of Asheville {{is home to}} a Duke Energy Progress {{coal power}} plant near Lake Julian. This power plant is {{designated}} as having Coal Combustion Residue Surface Impoundments with a High Hazard Potential by the EPA. In 2012 a Duke University study found high levels of arsenic and other toxins in North Carolina lakes and rivers downstream from the Asheville power plants coal ash ponds. Samples collected from coal ash waste flowing from the ponds at the Duke Energy Progress plant to the French Broad River in Buncombe County contained arsenic levels more than four times higher than the EPA drinking water standard, and levels of selenium 17 times higher than the agency's standard for aquatic life. In March 2013 the State of North Carolina sued Duke Energy Progress in order to address similar environmental compliance issues. In July 2013 Duke Energy Corp. and North Carolina environmental regulators proposed a settlement in the lawsuit that stated coal ash threatened Asheville's water supply. The settlement called for Duke to assess the sources and extent of contamination at the Riverbend power plant in Asheville. Duke would be fined $99,100 if the settlement is approved. Following the coal ash spill in Eden, NC resulting in 82,000 tons of coal ash leaking into the Dan River, the North Carolina DENR cancelled all previous settlements with Duke Energy. Duke said a stormwater drainage pipe under the utility's Dan River Steam Station lagoon ruptured Feb 2, allowing ash slurry to pour into the river. Duke Energy faces future legislation by Tom Apodaca, republican NCGA Senate leader forcing them to clean up their south Asheville coal ash ponds. Tom Apodaca expects the legislation will be filed as soon as the General Assembly returns to session in May 2014. Apodaca expects the ponds will <b>be</b> <b>cleaned</b> <b>up</b> in 5–10 years under his law.|$|E
25|$|The film flashes back to 21 {{years earlier}} during {{military}} era as Tamuno narrates their ordeal {{to the public}} via Kristy's camera. Ebiere (Mbong Amata) is born in Warri during the Military era; she concludes high school and is offered scholarship by Western Oil to study oversea. A few years later, an oil pipe in the Niger Delta bursts {{and the people of}} the community go to fetch petrol from the pipe, Dede (Hakeem Kae-Kazim), a fisherman discovers that fishes in the river have been killed by the oil spillage. The police arrive at the spillage site and demand that the Villagers vacate the area, but no one listens to them. Ebiere arrives in the village — her home, and is told her mother and siblings are getting fuel from a spillage site. On her way to the site, the site explodes killing her mother and siblings. The explosion appears to have been an accident, caused after one of the police officers sent to disperse the oil collectors lights a cigarette after having failed to do so. He is killed as well. Ebiere speaks up at a consolation visit of Western Oil staff (An oil rig American company based in Warri) and is applauded by members of the Community. This establishes her as one of the speakers for the Niger Delta Community, she is approached by Kate Summers (Sarah Wayne Callies), a reporter who likes her speech and says Ebiere is {{different from the rest of}} the community people, Kate becomes one of Ebiere's friends and supporters. Ebiere starts to organize peaceful protests and mass rallies for their voice to be heard, fighting for the Niger Delta to <b>be</b> <b>cleaned</b> <b>up</b> and well maintained — they are sometimes beaten, killed and/or arrested by the Military in the process. Ebiere is offered bribes severally by Western Oil representatives to stop her from instigating the people, but she always declines.|$|E

2500|$|Senator Shapleigh led the {{opposition}} to the reopening of an ASARCO-operated copper smelter located near downtown El Paso since 1887. [...] The smelter, which had been shut down in 1999 due to low copper prices, filed to renew their air permit application with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality in 2002. [...] Joined by leaders from across the three-state, two-nation region, Senator Shapleigh and hundreds of activists from El Paso, Juarez, and New Mexico placed enormous pressure on the corporation to justify putting over 7,000 tons of new pollutants into El Paso's air. [...] After eight years, the TCEQ Commissioners granted the permit on a 3-0 vote. [...] The Environmental Protection Agency soon intervened, however, citing deficiencies with the permitting process and ASARCO's air control equipment. [...] As a result, ASARCO announced that the El Paso smelter would not reopen. [...] As of July 2009, it appears the smelter property will be placed in an environmental remediation trust so that it may <b>be</b> <b>cleaned</b> <b>up</b> using funding obtained via ASARCO's bankruptcy.|$|E
