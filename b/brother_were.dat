5|$|The family {{continued}} {{collecting and}} selling fossils together, {{and set up}} a table of curiosities near the coach stop at a local inn. Although the stories about Anning tend to focus on her successes, Dennis Dean writes that her mother and <b>brother</b> <b>were</b> astute collectors too, and her parents had sold significant fossils before the father's death.|$|E
5|$|There was {{one report}} {{that her father}} gave Olga a small revolver, which she {{concealed}} in a boot while in captivity at Tsarskoe Selo and at Tobolsk. Colonel Eugene Kobylynsky, their sympathetic jailer, pleaded with the grand duchess to surrender her revolver before she, her sisters, and <b>brother</b> <b>were</b> transferred to Yekaterinburg. Olga reluctantly gave up her gun and was left unarmed.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 1904 season, {{after passing}} his final medical examinations, Verge left Sydney University and stopped playing rugby for the team. A. J. McKenzie, whom he had {{displaced}} in 1902, took over at fullback, although he soon gave way to Verge's brother, Cuthbert. The older Verge was granted a blue, and was elected a vice-president of the club. However, he returned to the team for the tour of New Zealand in September 1906.

5|$|By {{the time}} he was 6 years old, Domitian's mother and sister had long since died, while his father and <b>brother</b> <b>were</b> {{continuously}} active in the Roman military, commanding armies in Germania and Judaea. For Domitian, this meant that a significant part of his adolescence was spent in the absence of his near relatives. During the Jewish-Roman wars, he was likely taken under the care of his uncle Titus Flavius Sabinus II, at the time serving as city prefect of Rome; or possibly even Marcus Cocceius Nerva, a loyal friend of the Flavians and the future successor to Domitian.|$|E
5|$|Howard {{was born}} in Glendale, California, {{where he and his}} older <b>brother</b> <b>were</b> raised by his mother.

5|$|In 2012 Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) {{introduced}} a new Espanto Jr. {{as part of their}} Generacion 2012 group of wrestlers. In the weeks and months following the introduction of Generacion 2012, Hijo del Espanto (unclear if it was I or II) publicly stated that he and his <b>brother</b> <b>were</b> the rightful holders of the rights to the Espanto name, given to them by the only remaining, living member of the original Los Espantos, Espanto II.

5|$|Murray {{grew up in}} Dunblane and {{attended}} Dunblane Primary School. He and his <b>brother</b> <b>were</b> present during the 1996 Dunblane school massacre, when Thomas Hamilton killed 16 children and a teacher before shooting himself; Murray took cover in a classroom. Murray says {{he was too young}} to understand what was happening and is reluctant to talk about it in interviews, but in his autobiography Hitting Back he states that he attended a youth group run by Hamilton, and that his mother gave Hamilton lifts in her car. Murray later attended Dunblane High School.|$|E
5|$|On {{the eve of}} the coup, Rainivoninahitriniony {{informed}} Lambert that {{he could}} not guarantee the support of the army and that the plot should be aborted. One of the officers believed the brothers had betrayed them and sought to exonerate himself by notifying the queen of the failed conspiracy. She reacted by expelling the foreigners from the island and subjecting all the implicated Merina officers to the tangena ordeal in which they were forced to swallow a poison to determine their guilt or innocence. Rainilaiarivony and his <b>brother</b> <b>were</b> excepted from this and remained, like her son Radama, in the queen's confidence for the few remaining years of her life.|$|E
50|$|His older <b>brother</b> <b>was</b> Trevanion William Hugo, Mayor of Duluth, Minnesota from 1900 to 1904, {{and another}} <b>brother</b> <b>was</b> a Minnesota legislator.|$|R

An offensive defenceman, Scott led his Cranbrook midget team in scoring with 55 goals and 92 points in 1988–89.|$|E
5|$|Æthelwold or Æthelwald (died 902 or 903) was {{the younger}} of two known sons of Æthelred I, King of Wessex from 865 to 871. Because Æthelwold ætheling and his <b>brother</b> <b>were</b> still infants when their father the king died while {{fighting}} a Danish Viking invasion, the throne {{passed to the}} king's younger brother (and Æthelwold's uncle) Alfred the Great, who carried on {{the war against the}} Vikings and won a crucial victory at the Battle of Edington in 878.|$|E
5|$|Alexander's death raised {{questions}} about the succession to the throne as well as the nature of the Greek regime. As the king had contracted an unequal marriage his descendants were not in the line of succession. The Hellenic Parliament demanded that Constantine I and Crown Prince George be excluded from the succession but sought to preserve the monarchy by selecting another member of the royal house as the new sovereign. On 29 October 1920, the Greek minister in Berne, acting {{under the direction of the}} Greek authorities, offered the throne to Alexander's younger brother, Prince Paul. Paul, however, refused to become king while his father and elder <b>brother</b> <b>were</b> alive, insisting that neither of them had renounced their rights to the throne and that he therefore could never legitimately wear the crown.|$|E
50|$|Thomas Levett's <b>brother</b> <b>was</b> John Levett, a {{well-known}} attorney at York. Both <b>brothers</b> <b>were</b> large landowners and active in property sales in Yorkshire.|$|R

5|$|Amaral {{was himself}} an arguido in {{relation}} to his investigation of another case, the disappearance of Joana Cipriano. One day after Madeleine's disappearance, Amaral was made arguido, and a month later {{he was charged with}} making a false statement. Four other officers were charged with assault. Eight-year-old Joana had vanished in 2004 from Figueira, seven miles (11km) from Praia da Luz. Her body was never found, and no murder weapon was identified. Her mother and the mother's <b>brother</b> <b>were</b> convicted of her murder after confessing, but the mother retracted her confession, saying she had been beaten by police. Amaral was not present when the beating is alleged to have taken place, but he was accused of having covered up for others. The other detectives were acquitted. Amaral was convicted of perjury in May 2009 and received an 18-month suspended sentence.|$|E
5|$|Ambrose Dudley {{was imprisoned}} in the Tower of London {{with his father}} and his four brothers. All were attainted and {{condemned}} to death, but only the Duke and Guildford Dudley, the second youngest <b>brother,</b> <b>were</b> executed. After the natural death of John, the eldest brother, in October 1554, Ambrose Dudley was the family's heir; he remained longest in the Tower, being released late in 1554 after a plea by his wife, Lady Tailboys. On the whole, the brothers' release was brought about by their mother and their brother-in-law Henry Sidney, who successfully lobbied the Spanish nobles around England's new co-ruler and king consort, Philip of Spain. Out of prison, in December 1554 or January 1555, Ambrose and Robert Dudley took part in one of several tournaments held by Philip to celebrate Anglo-Spanish friendship.|$|E
5|$|Anne's {{downfall}} came {{shortly after}} she had recovered from her final miscarriage. Whether it was primarily the result of allegations of conspiracy, adultery, or witchcraft remains {{a matter of debate}} among historians. Early signs of a fall from grace included the King's new mistress, the 28-year-old Jane Seymour, being moved into new quarters, and Anne's brother, George Boleyn, being refused the Order of the Garter, which was instead given to Nicholas Carew. Between 30 April and 2 May, five men, including Anne's <b>brother,</b> <b>were</b> arrested on charges of treasonable adultery and accused of having sexual relationships with the queen. Anne was also arrested, accused of treasonous adultery and incest. Although the evidence against them was unconvincing, the accused were found guilty and condemned to death. George Boleyn and the other accused men were executed on 17 May 1536. At 8am on 19 May 1536, Anne, age 36, was executed on Tower Green.|$|E
50|$|Many Bengali kinship words {{consider}} both {{gender and}} age. For example, Father's elder <b>brothers</b> <b>are</b> called Jethu (জ্যাঠা)' while younger <b>brothers</b> <b>are</b> called Kaku (কাকু). Their wives are called Jethi-ma (জেঠি-মা) and Kaki-ma (কাকি-মা), respectively. Father's sister is called Pisi (পিসি), mother's sister is Maasi (মাসি). Mother's <b>brother</b> <b>is</b> called Mama (মামা) and his wife, Mami (মামি). English would just use Uncle and Aunt. An elder <b>brother</b> <b>is</b> Dada (দাদা), elder sister is Didi (দিদি), while the younger <b>brother</b> <b>is</b> Bhai (ভাই) and younger sister, Bon (বোন). Similar {{is the case}} with many Indian languages like Hindi, Gujarati and many others including Punjabi and Urdu for many relationships amongst family and relatives.|$|R
