There are 140 trade associations within the confederation who, alongside those direct members of the CBI, employ 7 million people, about {{one third of the}} UK private sector-employed workforce. The National Farmers' Union with its 55,000 members is the largest component of the 188,500 indirect members the CBI claims to speak for. The Country Land and Business association brings another 30,000 indirect members, the Association of Independent Professionals and the Self-Employed 20,000 indirect members, the Freight Transport Association 13,000, the Federation of Master Builders 9,500 and the Road Haulage Association 8,100.|$|E
25|$|The {{scheme was}} opposed during the {{consultation}} phase by {{a range of}} stake holders: The Freight Transport Association proposed an alternative scheme, reliant on a replacement cycle of vehicles, with lorries over 8 years old being liable, with higher years for other vehicles. They also stated that the standards were different from the forthcoming Euro5 requirements as well suggesting the scheme did not {{do anything to help}} reduce CO2 emissions. The Road Haulage Association opposed the scheme, stating the costs to hauliers and benefits to the environment did not justify its introduction. Schools and St.John Ambulance have expressed concern about the additional costs that the scheme will bring them, particularly in light of the restricted budgets they operate under. London First, a <b>business</b> <b>organisation,</b> criticised aspects of the scheme with relation to the categorisation of vehicles, but supported the principle. The scheme has been supported by the British Lung Foundation and the British Heart Foundation.|$|E

The study identified some environmental factors that were peculiar to the <b>business</b> <b>organisations</b> in the manufacturing sector vis-a-vis their significant impact through the administered questionnaires to employees of selected <b>business</b> <b>organisations</b> and inhabitants of three senatorial district that constitute Lagos metropolis. Electricity, government policies and fraudulent practices were found as factors critical with severe impact on the survival and growth of <b>business</b> <b>organisations</b> in the manufacturing sector among other factors which was adduced as the underlying rationale behind exodus of manufacturing organisations to the neighbouring countries. The use of Z value of 1. 96 at 0. 05 level of significance further confirmed the impact {{of each of the}} environmental factors on the survival and growth of <b>business</b> <b>organisations</b> and concluded that these factors signified impending danger that may impede the survival of these <b>business</b> <b>organisations</b> and make growth an impossible task if left on, thus recommended among others that the present arrangement (policy) of centralising electricity which has made the federal government to enjoy monopoly should be jettisoned in order to make way for devolution and alternative to power generation asid...|$|R

40|$|Recently <b>business</b> <b>organisations</b> have enthusiastically embraced {{social and}} {{environmental}} reporting, but questions are starting to emerge about the effects this type of reporting has on organisational or social change. In this book, Dr Colin Higgins examines language and textual strategies that suggest <b>business</b> <b>organisations</b> can use social/environmental reporting to shape broader social understandings about the responsible or sustainable corporation. The insights show new ways in which <b>business</b> <b>organisations</b> resist fundamental social change. Importantly, the book argues that stakeholder groups, equipped with new awareness of language use, can construct new ways to target unsustainable business practice. ...|$|R

He was particularly keen upon the question of continuity in the business, when it behoves the older generation to let in the younger to responsible management and to efface themselves. He was a man of five-and-forty. Incidentally he mentioned that he had never taken anything for his private life out of the great business he had built up but a salary, [...] "a good salary," [...] and that now he was gong to grant himself a pension.

A large number of these <b>business</b> <b>organisations</b> {{can be found in the}} province of Gauteng because of the large and diverse economic contribution the province delivers to the economy of South Africa. With the increased use of technology in the small businesses of Gauteng and South Africa, the risks around cyber-security, information security and other IT-related threats that can harm the businesses increase. As part of the related IT risks comes the information security awareness of the businesses. Research findings show that little to no information security awareness exists in the small IT-dependent <b>business</b> <b>organisations</b> of Gauteng, South Africa.

40|$|The {{institutional}} {{context of}} Chinese industry creates complicated and long decision processes. This has powerful {{consequences for the}} ability of Chinese <b>business</b> <b>organisations</b> to coordinate, motivate, and adapt. â€¢ Complex institutional influences in complex supervisory structures increase the coordination challenges, often compounded by lack of transparency. Chinese <b>business</b> <b>organisations</b> therefore are shot through with coordination failure, and {{there is reason to}} believe that where coordination does not fail, coordination costs are high. â€¢ Chinese <b>business</b> <b>organisations</b> also appear hampered in their ability to motivate actors, align their incentives and thereby solve the problem of assuring cooperation between actors. The attention to the motivations of a large number of external actors appears to make aligning incentives difficult, and the shift from political to economic and firm-level rewards supposedly makes the task of assuring incentive alignment more challenging. â€¢ Finally, Chinese <b>business</b> <b>organisations</b> tend to promote stability and refinement over adaptation and innovation. The design of Chinese decision making structures in and of itself suffices to explain some notable weaknesses, e. g. in innovative activities...|$|R
