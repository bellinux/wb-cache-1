50|$|An endcap return <b>ballnut</b> {{employs a}} cap {{on the end of}} the ball nut. The cap is {{machined}} to pick up balls out of the end of the nut and direct them down holes which are bored transversely down the <b>ballnut.</b> The complement cap on the other side of the nut directs balls back into the raceway.|$|E
50|$|An {{internal}} button <b>ballnut</b> {{employs a}} machined or cast button style return which allows balls {{to exit the}} raceway track and move one thread then reenter the raceway.|$|E
50|$|An {{external}} <b>ballnut</b> {{employs a}} stamped tube which picks up balls from the raceway {{by use of}} a small pick up finger. Balls travel inside of the tube and are then replaced back in the thread raceway.|$|E
50|$|The {{swimming}} area is at {{the northern}} end of Sims Esplanade. It is patrolled for 6 months of the year by Surf Lifesaving Queensland, and has a stinger net to protect swimmers from box jellyfish (Chironex fleckeri). Trust the lifesavers and swim between the flags; there have been drownings around the rocks a short distance away. There are barbecue and picnic facilities, plus public toilets and showers. The beach is lined with she-oak casuarinas, beach almonds, <b>ballnuts</b> and coconut palms. At its southern end the beach meets Thomatis Creek, which lies between Yorkeys Knob and Holloways Beach.|$|R
40|$|As the Shuttle Transportation System (STS) becomes operational, {{the number}} and variety of {{payloads}} will increase. The need to deploy these cargo elements will require a variety of unique actuator designs, all of which will have to conform with STS safety policy. For those missions where payload operations extend beyond the payload bay door envelope, this policy deems the prevention of door closure as a catastrophic hazard. As such, it must be controlled by independent, primary and backup methods. The combination of these methods must be two fault tolerant. The design of such an actuator is described. The device consists of a single linear ballscrew with two <b>ballnuts,</b> each bellnut forming an independent actuator using the common ballscrew. The design requirements, concept development, hardware configuration, and fault tolerance rationale are highlighted...|$|R
5000|$|Littoral forest. These {{trees are}} able to {{withstand}} seawater and most are even dispersed by the sea; they grow in a narrow strip along the beach. Dominant plants are sea poison tree (Barringtonia asiatica), <b>ballnut</b> (Calophyllum inophyllum), Hernandia nymphaeifolia, beach hibiscus (Hibiscus tiliaceus), Phaleria disperma and sea almond (Terminalia catappa).|$|E
5000|$|Tamanu oil (also called beauty leaf oil, calophyllum inophyllum seed oil, calophyllum inophyllum oil, kamani oil, calophyllum oil, calophyllum inophyllum {{essential}} oil, dilo oil, foraha oil, Alexandrian laurel oil, poon oil, nyamplung oil, domba oil, honne oil (as biodiesel), undi oil, pinnai oil, fetau oil, punnai oil, daok oil, pinnay oil, kamanu oil, bitaog oil, tamanu nut oil, punna oil, takamaka oil (ambiguous), laurelwood oil (ambiguous), tacamahac oil (ambiguous), punnaga oil, fetaʻu oil, palo maria oil, <b>ballnut</b> tree oil, <b>ballnut</b> oil, btaches oil, beach calophyllum oil, or mù u oil) {{is pressed}} from nuts {{of either the}} Calophyllum inophyllum (usually) or the Calophyllum tacamahaca (ati) tree. The nuts yield 70 - 75% of the greenish-yellow inedible oil. The oil originates in Polynesia, where it continues {{to play an important}} cultural role. [...] Commercial uses of tamanu oil are predominantly for skin care.|$|E
50|$|C. inophyllum is a low-branching and slow-growing {{tree with}} a broad and {{irregular}} crown. It usually reaches 8 to 20 m in height. The flower is 25 mm wide and occurs in racemose or paniculate inflorescences consisting of four to 15 flowers. Flowering can occur year-round, but usually two distinct flowering periods are observed, in late spring and in late autumn. The fruit (the <b>ballnut)</b> is a round, green drupe reaching 2 to 4 cm in diameter and having a single large seed. When ripe, the fruit is wrinkled and its color varies from yellow to brownish-red.|$|E
