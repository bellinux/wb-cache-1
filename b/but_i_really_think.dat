500|$|French {{director}} Jean-Baptiste Mondino {{was selected}} by Bowie to direct an accompanying music video. Regarding this, Bowie said, [...] "It's an experiment; I'm really putting myself in his [...] hands. [...] I think if I did it , {{it would be very}} abrasive, and I'm not quite sure if that's how I want the song to come off visually. In concert it will be abrasive; it won't have the same quality as the video. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> Mondino is a fantastic video maker. He just knows that this is his genre. He's like a craftsman and that's what he's trying to perfect, this craft of making his five minutes work." [...] Actor Joe Dallesandro makes appearances throughout the clip, announcing the dance marathon. A shot from the music video was used to commercialize 7" [...] releases of the single.|$|E
500|$|Bannon did not {{outwardly}} advertise {{the fact}} that the books had been released again in her department at Sacramento State. Not being tenured, she was unsure how the information would be received. However, word got out: [...] "I was jet-propelled out of the closet. People stared at me around campus, and the PE majors all waved. My chairman told me to put the books into my promotion file, and one of my colleagues told me my file {{was the only one that}} was any fun." [...] She often received small recognitions from students and faculty who were pleased and surprised, once getting a bouquet of flowers from a student. She said of the rediscovery, [...] "I was so ready for something fresh and exciting in my life. It had seemed to me, up to that point, that not only had the books and the characters died, so had Ann Bannon." [...] However, following a bitter divorce, and just as the Naiad Press editions of her books were released, Bannon endured a bout of chronic fatigue syndrome, which she connects to repressing herself for so long. [...] "You've got to think that it's connected, somehow. At the time I denied it fiercely, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> I beat myself up horribly, in ways I'll never know." ...|$|E
2500|$|Continuing his {{outstanding}} form in Serie A {{and in the}} Champions League for the 2010–11 campaign, he was pivotal to Inter's attack line. On 16 March 2011, Eto'o gave {{a legendary}} performance in Munich as he helped Inter eliminate Bayern Munich 3–2 (with an aggregate score of 3–3, winning on away goals) in the Champions League. Eto'o scored the first goal after four minutes, and provided two clinical assists to Wesley Sneijder and to Goran Pandev for the winner. After the game, Inter President Massimo Moratti said, [...] "I'm not sure if the deal that brought Eto'o to the club was my best piece of transfer business ever, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> {{it was a great}} piece of business for us. Eto'o is fantastic. I do not want to take anything away from Ibrahimović, but for everyone it was really a great deal to get Eto'o. Samuel is truly extraordinary." [...] On 29 May, Eto'o scored two goals in the final of the Coppa Italia against Palermo to help Inter win 3–1 and taking his total season goals to 37, a new record high for him.|$|E

6000|$|... "I don't {{think so}} either," [...] Frank agreed, [...] "or I would try and swim back again; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> could get round the point against the tide again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will take}} your advice, sir; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> {{that it would be}} best to follow the custom of the native troops, and march barefooted." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I didn't know," [...] said Jimmy {{with some}} surprise. [...] "Bob claimed he hadn't {{a gun and}} I think he had not. Sometimes I'm puzzled, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> the unlucky shot was mine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Are you? I don't {{know that}} I have shown any very strong preference. I am not {{disposed}} to praise myself for many things, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> do <b>think</b> that <b>I</b> {{have been as}} undemonstrative as most men of my age." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I don't {{want to be}} unreverent to her ladyship; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> don't <b>think</b> she is meaning {{any such}} waste of a Christian carcase.

6000|$|... "You {{are very}} kind, colonel; {{but you know}} you promised {{to give us a}} chance if you could, and having a chance of course means having extra danger; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> don't <b>think</b> that there would be any great danger in it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{what could}} I do? I got that thing because I thought it safer than a pistol, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> it's worse. I might have murdered them all, if I'd lost my temper,--and just for half-a-dozen apricots!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{the fashion}} to abuse Horace Walpole, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> {{him the most}} {{delightful}} writer that ever existed. I wonder who {{is to be the}} Horace Walpole of the present century? some one, perhaps, we least suspect." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{young people}} get to think of it. I shouldn't be {{disposed}} to prevent their coming together in a proper sort of way. I don't like night walkings in churchyards, certainly, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> that was only an accident." ...|$|E
60|$|THE YOUNG LADY. I {{understood}} {{her to do}} so. <b>But</b> <b>really</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> I'd better go.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, sir; very, very pleasant, and I'll {{do my best}} to be a good patient. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> don't <b>think</b> {{anyone could}} be sick in this {{delightful}} room," [...] she said, with a long sigh of happiness as her eye went from one pleasant object to another.|$|R
6000|$|... "I ate {{hardly any}} breakfast, and I've done {{everything}} I know {{to make myself}} extra hungry, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> can eat straight through, unless I burst my buttons off," [...] whispered Geordie to Will, as he surveyed the bounteous stores before him with a hopeless sigh.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, you'll {{get used}} to it," [...] she replied, cheerily. [...] "I always feel it a little at first; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> it's good for a body, kind o' {{stretches}} the lungs." [...] Nevertheless, she eyed him with furtive anxiety.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't want {{to wound}} you, Emily, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> {{that that is}} nonsense. She is a very nice woman;--though I don't think she ought to have said that Mr. Roby is dull. Did Mr. Wharton {{know that she was}} coming?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course, I don't {{want to make}} difficulties, Sir Griffin, and {{no doubt}} the affair has gone very far now. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> Lucinda would consent to break it off if you wish it. I have never thought that you were really in love with her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's kind of you, Gus, {{to tell me}} of this," [...] {{answered}} Dave, heartily. [...] "And I'll be on my guard. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> don't <b>think</b> Nat Poole {{will cut}} much of a figure during this term of school. He has lost too many of his old friends." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{wish to be}} rude, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> do <b>think</b> you are vain of {{your good}} looks, elegant accomplishments, and the {{impression}} you make wherever you go. When it's worth while, you exert yourself, and are altogether fascinating; but the 'I come-see-and-conquer' air you put on spoils it all for sensible people." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We can't {{walk the}} deck, ma'am. We has to {{scramble}} along {{the best way}} we can, holdin' on by hands and teeth and eyelids. Thank 'ee, miss, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> do <b>think</b> I'd better not try to eat any more. I feels chock-full already, an' it might be dangerous. There's severe laws now against overloadin', you know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps I didn't {{translate}} it rightly; {{for it is}} {{very hard}} to put bird-notes into our language, because we haven't words soft and sweet enough. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> there are berries over there, and we will see if what he says is true," [...] said Wee.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, dear," [...] Alan {{was saying}} to his wife, [...] "from first to last {{it has been a}} very queer story, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> that our getting that Asiki gold after all was one of the queerest parts of it; also uncommonly convenient, as things have turned out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “That he’ll try {{to clean}} out the wreck before we get there. It was the only reason he let us go. I dare say you noticed how careful he was not to show any anxiety to buy us off.

6000|$|... "Really, Lady Ongar, I think not. When your ladyship {{returned}} {{there was}} some opposition thought of for a while, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> do not <b>think</b> it was their fault." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am at a loss," [...] he said, [...] "to {{account for}} your {{somewhat}} melodramatic tone, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> do not <b>think</b> that Miss Beverley has {{very much to}} fear." ...|$|R
40|$|I am {{not usually}} someone who follows the Mail {{newspaper}} and headline-chasing backbench MPs in laying {{in to the}} media about ‘offensive’ material. Generally, I take the view that people can always turn off the telly or turn the other cheek. British mainstream media is largely innocuous compared to, say, the Internet. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> do <b>think</b> that the Brand/Ross incident borders on the criminal, literally...|$|R
6000|$|... "I haven't {{the least}} idea what such young ladies expect {{a man to}} do. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> that you had better not meddle with little American girls that are uncultivated, as you call them. You have lived too long out of the country. You will be sure to make some great mistake. You are too innocent." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's all right, Mrs. McLeish," [...] {{said the}} traveller. [...] "I will pay {{you the right}} amount. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> you had better come into your house, for {{it is going to}} be a bad afternoon, and I must get away as soon as I can. I will go, as I came, in the cart, for you won't want it now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Right, Norman, {{that is what}} {{my father}} before me always said, and the way I have always acted myself; much better let a few trifles go on not just as one would wish, than be for ever interfering. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> {{this is a case}} for it, and I don't think you ought to let {{yourself}} be influenced by the fear of any party-spirit." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, I'm very sorry, Mrs Clinton; {{of course}} it's a great blow to you; <b>but</b> <b>really</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> {{arrangements}} {{had better be}} made {{for him to be}} put under restraint.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It will be hot," [...] said Cheyne, as {{they rolled}} out of San Diego in the dawn of Sunday. [...] "We're going to hurry, mama, just as fast as ever we can; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> don't <b>think</b> there's any good of your putting on your bonnet and gloves yet. You'd much better lie down and take your medicine. I'd play you a game o' dominoes, but it's Sunday." ...|$|R
5000|$|On October 3, 2014, Paul told CNN that [...] "I {{believe in}} old-fashioned {{traditional}} marriage <b>but</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>really</b> <b>think</b> {{the government needs}} to be too involved in this and I think the Republican Party can have {{people on both sides of}} the issue," [...] and when asked if he could rethink his own position at some point he then threw his hands up in a half-shrug, half-grimace.|$|R
