50|$|Ten stone <b>beds</b> <b>are</b> seen in {{two places}} on this hillock. One group of five stone <b>beds</b> <b>are</b> seen {{on the top of}} the hill. These <b>beds</b> <b>are</b> carved on a rock facing east. Above these beds, on a rock, a long narrow line were carved to protect the beds from water inflow. On the east of this hillock, another group of five stone <b>beds</b> <b>are</b> seen facing north. A dried pond is also seen on the hillock.|$|R
5|$|While {{historically}} pure, {{the stream}} now suffers from urban stream syndrome, partially {{due to the}} amount of impervious surfaces within its watershed. Flowing over glacial till, the stream's <b>bed</b> <b>is</b> rich in cobbles and the kill supports populations of benthic macroinvertebrates, trees, shrubs, fish, birds, snapping turtles, and frogs. As of 2016, a Vassar–Cornell University program is monitoring the water quality of the Fonteyn Kill.|$|E
5|$|A pair {{of large}} canvases with hunting dogs by Jean-Baptiste Oudry (1742), now {{hanging in the}} Salle du synode, once hung in the Parisian hôtel particulier of Samuel-Jacques Bernard. The three {{paintings}} in the chapel are copies of works by Antonio da Correggio: Adoration of the Shepherds, Virgin and Child with Sts Jerome and Madeleine, and The Rest on the Return from Egypt. They were made in 1724 in Modena and Parma by Robert deSéry (1686–1733) for Armand Gaston, whom he had met in Rome the same year. DeSéry would later provide many other paintings for the cardinal's apartments, all of them copies of paintings by greater masters. Napoleon's green <b>bed</b> <b>is</b> an authentic work by Jacob-Desmalter.|$|E
5|$|Darwin's first {{literary}} {{project was}} his Journal and Remarks {{on the natural}} history of the expedition, now known as The Voyage of the Beagle. In it he expanded his diary notes into a section on this theory, emphasising how {{the presence or absence of}} coral reefs and atolls can show whether the ocean <b>bed</b> <b>is</b> elevating or subsiding. At the same time he was privately speculating intensively about transmutation of species, and taking on other projects. He finished writing out his journal around the end of September, but then had the work of correcting proofs.|$|E
50|$|Today, {{platform}} <b>beds</b> <b>are</b> generally {{made from}} wood, metal, bamboo or leather and {{may or may}} not include a headboard and foot board. Platform <b>beds</b> <b>are</b> able to support a mattress without the use of a box spring, although many <b>beds</b> <b>are</b> able to accommodate the box spring if desired.|$|R

5|$|The Antarctic scallop {{can swim}} rather slowly by {{opening and closing}} its valves. It {{advances}} in this way with {{the rim of the}} shell to the front. It can detect the movement of nearby objects with its rudimentary eyes and, in order to escape predators, can move much more swiftly umbones first, by clapping its valves shut. A remotely controlled camera stationed on the sea <b>bed</b> <b>is</b> apt to find that all the scallops that were originally in its field of view have moved off to other locations.|$|E
5|$|The Segaran {{lake area}} {{was the main}} complex of the Taman Sari during its era. This complex {{consisted}} of a man-made lake called Segaran ("artificial sea") with some buildings located on artificial islands {{in the middle of}} a lake. The buildings are connected by an underwater tunnel. It was used as the starting point for the royal family to reach the Taman Sari pools via a vessel. Today, the Segaran lake cannot be seen any longer as the water had been drained and the lake <b>bed</b> <b>is</b> now filled with human settlements. The underwater tunnel, which is now underground after the water had gone, still exist and can be accessed.|$|E
5|$|The Shimna {{is a short}} spate river, {{meaning it}} becomes deep and fast flowing after periods of rain and is slow, with low water levels, in drier weather. In {{sections}} of the river where the gradient is low, there are riffles and pools, sandy banks, and pebbles and scattered boulders on the river bed. Along steeper parts there is a faster flow, rapids and cascades, and the <b>bed</b> <b>is</b> made up of bedrock and boulders.|$|E
500|$|The Pocono <b>Beds</b> <b>are</b> {{found near}} Shickshinny Creek, on Shickshinny Mountain. The Pocono <b>Beds</b> <b>are</b> {{found at the}} same level as the creek {{slightly}} north of Shickshinny. This rock formation consists of [...] of gray sandstone and brownish sandy shales. Approximately [...] below the Pocono <b>Beds</b> <b>is</b> a layer of rock approximately [...] thick and composed of pebbly sandstone. This may be the Mount Pleasant Formation. The Mauch Chunk Formation is also found in the watershed. Additionally, the Chemung <b>Beds</b> <b>are</b> found on parts of the creek.|$|R

5|$|A {{number of}} foods and {{substances}} {{have been found}} to disturb sleep, due to stimulant effects or disruptive digestive demands. Avoiding nicotine, caffeine (including coffee, energy drinks, soft drinks, tea, chocolate, and some pain relievers), and other stimulants in the hours before bedtime is recommended by most sleep hygiene specialists, as these substances activate neurobiological systems that maintain wakefulness. Alcohol near bedtime is frequently discouraged by clinicians, because, although alcohol can induce sleepiness initially, the arousal caused by metabolizing alcohol can disrupt and significantly fragment sleep. Smoking tobacco products before <b>bed</b> <b>is</b> also thought to reduce one's quality of resting by decreasing the time spent in deep sleep, leading to sleep fragmentation and nocturnal restlessness. Both consumption of a large meal just before bedtime, requiring effort to metabolize it all, and hunger have been associated with disrupted sleep; clinicians may recommend eating a light snack before bedtime. Lastly, limiting intake of liquids before bedtime can prevent interruptions due to urinations.|$|E
5|$|The {{village of}} Rhynie in Aberdeenshire {{is the site}} of an {{important}} sedimentary deposit - Rhynie chert. The bulk of this fossil bed consists of primitive plants that had water-conducting cells and sporangia but no leaves, along with arthropods: Collembola, Opiliones (harvestmen), pseudoscorpions and the extinct, spider-like Trigonotarbids. This fossil <b>bed</b> <b>is</b> remarkable for two reasons. Firstly, the age of the find (early Devonian circa 410 Ma) makes this one of the earliest sites anywhere containing terrestrial fossils, coinciding with the first stages of the colonisation of land by plants and animals. Secondly, these cherts are famous for their exceptional state of ultrastructural preservation, with individual cell walls easily visible in polished specimens. For example, stomata have been counted and lignin remnants detected in the plant material.|$|E
5|$|To {{the eastern}} {{transept}} is the Mother-of-Pearl Bed (พระแท่นบรรทมประดับมุก) {{which was made}} to match the Mother-of-Pearl Throne. The bed was once the king's personal bed and was kept inside the Phra Thinang Phiman Rattaya; however once {{it was no longer}} used it was transferred to the Dusit Maha Prasat Throne Hall. The <b>bed</b> <b>is</b> {{in the form of a}} high platform with many layers, and small steps leading to the top. When royal ceremonies are carried out within the throne hall, member of the royal family take their seat in the southern transept, while government officials sit to the north, Buddhist monks to the east; the funeral urn is to the west. During such times the throne and bed were used as altars for Buddha images.|$|E
50|$|By 1957, {{the number}} of <b>beds</b> <b>was</b> {{increased}} to 120. In 1958, an x-ray block was established. In 1959, a maternity ward with 12 <b>beds</b> <b>was</b> added. In 1960, a TB annexe with 220 <b>beds</b> <b>was</b> created, and subsequently, a cardiology centre was opened. By 1973, an ICU was started and soon many out-patient clinics such as eye, dental and ENT were also introduced.|$|R

25|$|A strong airflow {{is forced}} through a sandbed. The air seeps through the sand until a point is reached where the sand {{particles}} separate {{to let the}} air through and mixing and churning occurs, thus a fluidized <b>bed</b> <b>is</b> created and fuel and waste can now be introduced. The sand with the pre-treated waste and/or fuel is kept suspended on pumped air currents and takes on a fluid-like character. The <b>bed</b> <b>is</b> thereby violently mixed and agitated keeping small inert particles and air in a fluid-like state. This allows all {{of the mass of}} waste, fuel and sand to be fully circulated through the furnace.|$|E
50|$|Platform <b>beds</b> {{which might}} <b>be</b> {{recognized}} as more accurate representations of today's platform <b>beds</b> <b>were</b> better defined as loft <b>beds.</b> The <b>beds</b> <b>were</b> originally situated high {{off the ground}} to allow for more living space below.

50|$|Reed <b>beds</b> <b>are</b> natural {{habitats}} found in floodplains, waterlogged depressions, and estuaries. Reed <b>beds</b> <b>are</b> {{part of a}} succession from young reeds colonising open water or wet ground through a gradation of increasingly dry ground. As reed beds age, they build up a considerable litter layer that eventually rises above the water level and that ultimately provides opportunities for scrub or woodland invasion. Artificial reed <b>beds</b> <b>are</b> used to remove pollutants from grey water.|$|R
