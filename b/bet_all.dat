500|$|The {{scene with}} Grampa and Bea eating their pills seductively is a {{reference}} to the 1963 film Tom Jones. Two of the people waiting in line to ask for Grampa's money are Darth Vader and the Joker. When the family is suggesting places they could go, Homer suggests the Springfield Mystery Spot, {{a reference to}} the Mystery Spot in California—although Lisa says that the Springfield Spot is simply a puddle of mud. They eventually decide to go to the Discount Lion Safari, however. The Diz-Nee-Land amusement park that Grampa visits with Bea's money has a sign that reads [...] "Diz-Nee-Land—Not affiliated with Disneyland, Walt Disney World, or anything else from the Walt Disney Company". The shot of Grampa sitting at a diner resembles the 1942 American painting Nighthawks. Before Grampa attempts to <b>bet</b> <b>all</b> of his money on Roulette he quotes the poem [...] "If—" [...] by Rudyard Kipling. The climax scenes, where Grampa uses the money to fix up the Springfield Retirement Castle, is {{a reference to the}} ending of the 1932 film If I Had a Million.

It is based upon Gen. R. i. and Cant. R. on v. 11, according to which Aleph (א) complained before God that Bet (ב) was preferred to it, but was assured that the Torah of Sinai, the object of creation, would begin with Aleph (אנכי = Anoki = I am); it, however, varies from the Midrash Rabbot.

2500|$|In 1966, as Frazier's {{career was}} taking off, Durham {{contacted}} Los Angeles trainer Eddie Futch. The {{two men had}} never met, but Durham had heard of Futch through the latter's {{reputation as one of}} the most respected trainers in boxing. Frazier was sent to Los Angeles to train, before Futch agreed to join Durham as an assistant trainer.

50|$|Risk of ruin is {{a concept}} in gambling, insurance, and finance {{relating}} to the likelihood of losing all one's investment capital or extinguishing one's bankroll below the minimum for further play.
