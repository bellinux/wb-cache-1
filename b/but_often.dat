5|$|Almost every silver siliqua in the hoard has had {{its edge}} clipped to some degree. This is typical of Roman silver coin finds of this period in Britain, {{although}} clipped coins are very unusual {{through the rest of}} the Roman Empire. The clipping process invariably leaves the imperial portrait on the front of the coin intact, <b>but</b> <b>often</b> damages the mint mark, inscription, and the image on the obverse.|$|E
5|$|Antlion larvae require loose soil, not {{necessarily}} <b>but</b> <b>often</b> sand. The larvae prefer dry places {{protected from the}} rain. When it first hatches, the tiny larva specialises in very small insects, but as it grows larger, it constructs larger pits, and thus catches larger prey, sometimes much larger than itself.|$|E
5|$|As {{in other}} eukaryotes, the {{inheritance}} of endosymbiotic organelles like mitochondria and chloroplasts in plants is non-Mendelian. Chloroplasts are inherited through the male parent in gymnosperms <b>but</b> <b>often</b> through the female parent in flowering plants.|$|E

In my humble judgment, it is sometimes all four, <b>but</b> <b>oftener</b> a disease than anything else, and even when anything else, generally a disease as well." [...] (Inaugural address, 1884).|$|R

5|$|At 6ft 4 in, 225lb (1.93m, 102kg), Ripken was a {{departure}} from the prototypical shortstop of the time—small, fleet-of-foot players who played a defensively difficult position <b>but</b> <b>often</b> did not post the home run and batting average totals that an outfielder might. Power hitting shortstops such as Alex Rodriguez, Nomar Garciaparra and Miguel Tejada are often seen by fans to be part of Ripken's legacy.|$|E
5|$|Gaga grounds {{this sort}} of {{spectacle}} with her voice. She is still a fearsome singer when she chooses to be, {{which is to say}} rarely on records <b>but</b> <b>often</b> in concert... What she gave the faithful was easy to digest: largely bulletproof pop, swinging back and forth between brooding, panting torch songs delivered at top volume and grand-scale 1980s-style digital rock with a nightclub twist.|$|E
5|$|Residents of Arbroath {{are called}} Arbroathians <b>but</b> <b>often</b> refer to {{themselves}} as Red Lichties after the red lamp that shone from the harbour light and foghorn tower {{at the entrance to}} the harbour as an aid to shipping entering the aforementioned harbour.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} {{acquired}} conditions augment {{the risk of}} thrombosis. A prominent example is antiphospholipid syndrome, which is caused by antibodies against constituents of the cell membrane, particularly lupus anticoagulant (first found in people with the disease systemic lupus erythematosus <b>but</b> <b>often</b> detected in people without the disease), anti-cardiolipin antibodies, and anti-β2-glycoprotein 1 antibodies; it is therefore regarded as an autoimmune disease. In some cases antiphospholipid syndrome can cause arterial as well as venous thrombosis. It is also more strongly associated with miscarriage, and can cause {{a number of other}} symptoms (such as livedo reticularis of the skin and migraine).|$|E
5|$|A {{secondary}} {{enemy is}} the Flood, a parasitic alien life form {{that appears in}} three main variants. Infection Forms, the true form of the Flood, are fragile beings and do little damage individually, <b>but</b> <b>often</b> travel in swarms of several dozen in order to infect their prey. Combat Forms result from humans and Covenant Elites who have succumbed to the Infection Forms, and have hideously deformed bodies as a result. Bloated Carrier Forms {{are the result of}} an aged or unused Combat Form and serve as incubators for new Infection Forms; when wounded or near a potential victim, they explode to damage other nearby life-forms and to release their spores, thus perpetuating the Flood life cycle.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 14 in 1904, Kilner {{reached the}} Mitchell Main first team. Although {{selected}} regularly from 1905, Kilner was not particularly successful with the bat. He displayed aggression <b>but</b> <b>often</b> attempted difficult shots and consequently lost his wicket. His bowling was more effective but used infrequently. By 1909 his batting improved; he scored his first century for the team and began to make consistently good scores, attracting the attention of Yorkshire.|$|E

5|$|Cestodes (tapeworms) and digeneans (flukes) cause {{important}} {{diseases in}} humans and their livestock, and monogeneans can cause serious losses of stocks in fish farms. Schistosomiasis, {{also known as}} bilharzia or snail fever, is the second-most devastating parasitic disease in tropical countries, behind malaria. The Carter Center estimated 200million people in 74 countries are infected with the disease, and half the victims live in Africa. The condition has a low mortality rate, <b>but</b> <b>often</b> is a chronic illness that can damage internal organs. It can impair the growth and cognitive development of children, and {{increase the risk of}} bladder cancer in adults. The disease is caused by several flukes of the genus Schistosoma, which can bore through human skin. The people most at risk are those who use infected bodies of water for recreation or laundry.|$|E
5|$|Christian metal bands {{exist in}} most of the subgenres of heavy metal music, and the only common link among most Christian metal bands are the lyrics. The Christian themes are often melded with the {{subjects}} of the genre the band is rooted in, regularly providing a Christian take on the subject matter. It has been argued that the marginal yet transnational Christian metal subculture provides its core members an alternative religious expression and Christian identity, and that the music serves the purpose of offering a positive message through lyrical content. This may not necessarily show a direct connection or reference to the Christian faith <b>but</b> <b>often</b> it does.|$|E
5|$|In other areas, {{such as the}} Mediterranean, some {{individuals}} have adverse reactions to apples because of their similarity to peaches. This form of apple allergy also includes OAS, <b>but</b> <b>often</b> has more severe symptoms, such as vomiting, abdominal pain and urticaria, and can be life-threatening. Individuals with this form of allergy can also develop reactions to other fruits and nuts. Cooking does not break down the protein causing this particular reaction, so affected individuals can eat neither raw nor cooked apples. Freshly harvested, over-ripe fruits tend to have {{the highest levels of}} the protein that causes this reaction.|$|E

60|$|Sometimes, in the glens, we {{came upon}} {{luxuriant}} orchards of figs, apricots, pomegranates, and such things, <b>but</b> <b>oftener</b> the scenery was rugged, mountainous, verdureless and forbidding. Here and there, towers were perched high up on acclivities which seemed almost inaccessible. This fashion {{is as old as}} Palestine itself and was adopted in ancient times for security against enemies.|$|R
60|$|And {{this first}} lesson progressed {{in about the}} same way until the hour was over, save that now and then Mr. Castle would give him some good advice, <b>but</b> <b>oftener</b> he would twist the long lash of the whip around the boy's legs {{with such force that}} Toby {{believed}} the skin had been taken entirely off.|$|R
5|$|In {{the first}} vote of 2008, she placed {{third in the}} January 3 Iowa Democratic caucus behind Obama and Edwards. Obama gained ground in {{national}} polling {{in the next few}} days, with all polls predicting a victory for him in the New Hampshire primary. Clinton gained a surprise win there on January 8, defeating Obama narrowly. It was the first time a woman had won a major American party's presidential primary for the purposes of delegate selection. Explanations for Clinton's New Hampshire comeback varied <b>but</b> <b>often</b> centered on her being seen more sympathetically, especially by women, after her eyes welled with tears and her voice broke while responding to a voter's question the day before the election.|$|E
5|$|Interspersed {{throughout}} his scientific essays for Natural History magazine, Gould frequently {{referred to his}} nonscientific interests and pastimes. As a boy he collected baseball cards and remained a New York Yankees fan {{throughout his}} life. As an adult {{he was fond of}} science fiction movies, <b>but</b> <b>often</b> deplored their poor storytelling and presentation of science. His other interests included singing baritone in the Boston Cecilia, and he was a great aficionado of Gilbert and Sullivan operas. He collected rare antiquarian books, possessed an enthusiasm for architecture, and enjoyed city walks. He often traveled to Europe, and spoke French, German, Russian, and Italian. He sometimes alluded ruefully to his tendency to put on weight.|$|E
5|$|Main {{memory in}} a {{parallel}} computer is either shared memory (shared between all processing elements in a single address space), or distributed memory (in which each processing element has its own local address space). Distributed memory refers {{to the fact that}} the memory is logically distributed, <b>but</b> <b>often</b> implies that it is physically distributed as well. Distributed shared memory and memory virtualization combine the two approaches, where the processing element has its own local memory and access to the memory on non-local processors. Accesses to local memory are typically faster than accesses to non-local memory.|$|E

The family resides in Newport Beach, California, <b>but</b> <b>often</b> returns to Cranbrook, where they spent the off-seasons while he was playing. Scott and Lisa are active in the community. They serve as honorary co-chairs of the Walk for Kids, a charity event that {{supports}} the Ronald McDonald House of Orange County, while Scott and his brother Rob operate a hockey school in Cranbrook and established a fund that offers grants to community associations. An active environmentalist, Scott has also joined with WWF-Canada to speak out in favour of efforts to maintain British Columbia's natural wilderness.|$|E
5|$|Past {{experiences}} {{or general}} knowledge {{is often called}} upon in conversation, {{so it is a}} useful context for children to learn words. Recalling past experiences allows the child to call upon their own visual, tactical, oral, and/or auditory references. For example, if a child once went to a zoo and saw an elephant, but did not know the word elephant, an adult could later help the child recall this event, describing the size and color of the animal, how big its ears were, its trunk, and the sound it made, then using the word elephant to refer to the animal. Calling upon prior knowledge is used not only in conversation, <b>but</b> <b>often</b> in book reading as well to help explain what is happening in a story by relating it back to the child's own experiences.|$|E
5|$|Physical {{examination}} typically reveals {{fluid in}} the joint, tenderness, and crepitus. The tenderness may initially spread, <b>but</b> <b>often</b> reverts to a well-defined focal point as the lesion progresses. Just as OCD shares symptoms with common maladies, acute osteochondral fracture {{has a similar}} presentation with tenderness in the affected joint, but is usually associated with a fatty hemarthrosis. Although {{there is no significant}} pathologic gait or characteristic alignment abnormality associated with OCD, the patient may walk with the involved leg externally rotated in an attempt to avoid tibial spine impingement on the lateral aspect of the medial condyle of the femur.|$|E
