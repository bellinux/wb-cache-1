5|$|Another key {{elements}} to Durkheim's theory {{of knowledge is}} his concept of représentations collectives (collective representations), which is outlined in The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life. Représentations collectives are the symbols and images that come to represent the ideas, <b>beliefs,</b> <b>and</b> <b>values</b> elaborated by a collectivity and are not reducible to individual constituents. They can include words, slogans, ideas, or any number of material items that {{can serve as a}} symbol, such as a cross, a rock, a temple, a feather etc. As Durkheim elaborates, représentations collectives are created through intense social interaction and are products of collective activity. As such these representations have the particular, and somewhat contradictory, aspect that they exist externally to the individual (since they are created and controlled not by the individual but by society as a whole), and yet simultaneously within each individual of the society (by virtue of that individual's participation within society).|$|E

40|$|International audienceMaximin {{expected}} {{utility model}} for individual decision making under ambiguity prescribes {{that the individual}} posits independently a utility function {{and a set of}} probability distributions over events to represent the <b>values</b> <b>and</b> <b>belief,</b> respectively. It assumes that individual evaluates each act {{on the basis of its}} minimum expected utility over this class of distributions. In this paper, we attempt to generalize the model to social decision making. It is assumed that the society’s belief is formed through a linear aggregation of individual <b>beliefs</b> <b>and</b> society’s <b>values</b> through a linear aggregation of individual values. We propose principles which characterize such separate aggregation procedures. We also generalize Choquet expected utility model, which posits a nonadditive measure over events and a utility function to represent <b>belief</b> <b>and</b> <b>values,</b> respectively. We prove that the only aggregation procedures that respect our principles are the separate linear aggregations of <b>beliefs</b> <b>and</b> <b>value...</b>|$|R

From time to time, however, a researcher may be confronted with a situation where such an analysis is unavoidable. This article takes the shape of a conversation between two researchers who have been working for several years in quite different research paradigms in the field of Religion Studies/Religion Education/Religion in Education. They investigate the possibility of collaboration as they were initially trained at the same university. After their graduate studies, their ways parted, and they developed quite different scholarly paradigms as well as <b>belief</b> <b>and</b> <b>value</b> systems. Their conversation not only highlights the differences in their respective current worldviews, <b>belief</b> systems, <b>value</b> systems, <b>and</b> academic approaches to Religious Studies, but also shows in practical terms how different scholarly paradigms (with their concomitant <b>belief</b> <b>and</b> <b>value</b> systems) can impact on researchers’ (views of) scholarship, science practice and research in Religion Education and Religion in Education...|$|R

Ethical issues (for example, relating to climate change, consumerism, economic globalisation, fair trade, migration, poverty and wealth, sustainable development, terrorism, war) are also addressed. Learners are expected to reflect on ethical conflicts related to social and political responsibilities and the wider impact of their choices and decisions. Learners also develop the knowledge, skills, values and attitudes to care for others and the environment and to engage in civic action. These include compassion, empathy, collaboration, dialogue, social entrepreneurship and active participation. They learn about opportunities for engagement as citizens at local, national and global levels, and examples of individual and collective action taken by others to address global issues and social injustice.|$|E

40|$|Research {{indicates}} {{an association between}} parents’disciplinary practices and their children’s developmental outcomes. Research also suggests that disciplinary practices vary with demo-graphic factors such as class, ethnicity, and gender. This article draws on the Douglas-Wildavsky grid-group theory to explain the association between demographic factors and disciplinary practices in microsocial terms. This theory links disparate sets of core <b>beliefs</b> <b>and</b> <b>value</b> priorities to contrasting conceptions of the family (including distinctive orienta-tions toward parenting) and parental preferences for different disciplinary strategies. Studies by other researchers provide empirical support for these linkages. This grid-group theory ap-plication contributes to theory development through (a) bridging macroexplanations and microexplanations by showing how culture contributes to shaping parental practices, (b) dis-tinguishing rival sets of core <b>beliefs</b> <b>and</b> <b>value</b> priorities that help researchers and practitio-ners understand parents, and (c) indicating ways for practitioners to apply these distinctions in family intervention...|$|R

500|$|Regarding {{the society}} itself, like social {{institutions}} in general, Durkheim {{saw it as}} a set of social facts. Even more than [...] "what society is", Durkheim was interested in answering [...] "how is a society created" [...] and [...] "what holds a society together". In The Division of Labour in Society, Durkheim attempted to answer the question of what holds the society together. He assumes that humans are inherently egoistic, but norms, <b>beliefs</b> <b>and</b> <b>values</b> (collective consciousness) form the moral basis of the society, resulting in social integration. Collective consciousness is of key importance to the society, its requisite function without which the society cannot survive. Collective consciousness produces the society and holds it together, {{and at the same time}} individuals produce collective consciousness through their interactions. Through collective consciousness human beings become aware of one another as social beings, not just animals.|$|E

500|$|Despite the {{diversity}} {{found in the}} AG, shared <b>beliefs</b> <b>and</b> <b>values</b> are reflected in local churches. The Assemblies of God is [...] "experience-oriented", and the local church is where experience of {{the activity of the}} Holy Spirit will primarily occur. Regular services are usually held on Sunday mornings and Sunday and Wednesday evenings. There is no formal liturgy or order of service; though, many churches have a familiar routine: opening prayer, congregational and special singing, an offering, a time of intercessory prayer, a sermon, and an altar call. In the traditional and charismatic AG churches, this routine is subject to change spontaneously within a service—possibly being interrupted by an interpretation of a message in tongues, a prophecy, a word of wisdom, or a word of knowledge—and this change is believed to be directed by the Holy Spirit. In addition, evening services may incorporate a time of prayer for those who are seeking something from God either around the altar or in an adjacent prayer room.|$|E

2500|$|The {{transmission}} of individual stories and customs within a family depends {{for the most}} part upon the personality, character, and lifestyle of individual family members. It is not normally passed along as part of a defined family role. As a family reshapes itself around each birth, death, marriage and other life events, individual members elect to pick up items of family lore to own and perform. This might be learning a skill, telling a story (or story cycle) or baking a traditional pie for the Thanksgiving table. The {{transmission of}} individual items can picked up by several different family members, for example when several grown siblings use a family recipe or tradition in their own households. This type of transmission through multiple individuals was first described in an article by Dégh and Vázsonyi as [...] "multi-conduit transmission". By choosing to own a piece of the family lore, a family member signifies that this tradition embodies <b>beliefs</b> <b>and</b> <b>values</b> to which he adheres.
