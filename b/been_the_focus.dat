The cathedral was closed for four years while President Plutarco Elías Calles attempted to enforce Mexico's anti-religious laws. Pope Pius XI closed the church, ordering priests to cease their public religious duties in all Mexican churches. After the Mexican government and the papacy came to terms and major renovations were performed on the cathedral, it reopened in 1930.|$|E

The Italian tarantella is a dance to rid the young woman of the lustful effects of a spider bite.|$|E
5|$|The better-armoured German battlecruisers fared better, in {{part due}} to the poor {{performance}} of British fuzes (the British shells tended to explode or break up on impact with the German armour). —the only German battlecruiser lost at Jutland—had only 128 killed, for instance, despite receiving more than thirty hits. The other German battlecruisers, , Von der Tann, Seydlitz, and , were all heavily damaged and required extensive repairs after the battle, Seydlitz barely making it home, for they had <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> of British fire for much of the battle.|$|E

5|$|The {{franchise}} {{has been}} commercially successful as a multimedia shared universe, though {{some critics have}} found that some of its films and television series have suffered in service of the wider universe. It has inspired other film and television studios with comic book character adaptation rights to attempt to create similar shared universes. The MCU has also <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> of other media, outside of the shared universe, including attractions at the Disneyland Resort and Discovery Times Square, two television specials, guidebooks for each film, multiple tie-in video games, and a commercial with Coca-Cola.|$|E

At the heart of the disputes is the legal concept of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in regards to long-term franchise agreements.|$|E

5|$|Bapaume {{itself was}} a small town linked by rail to Albert and Arras. There were also four major roads running through the town; running to Albert in the south-west, to Peronne in the south-east; to Cambrai {{in the east and}} to the north lay Arras. Captured by the forces of Imperial Germany {{in the early stages of}} the war, it had <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> of the British forces on the opening day of the Battle of Somme in 1916. Still in German hands, it had been largely {{destroyed}} in early 1917 following their withdrawal to the Hindenburg Line. Extensive booby traps had also been left and these troubled the Australians that moved into the town afterwards. It was subsequently recaptured by the Germans during the Spring Offensive. The land surrounding Bapaume was relatively flat and thus was conducive to the use of tanks.|$|E
5|$|Because of poor-quality soil, much of Wales is {{unsuitable}} for crop-growing and livestock farming has traditionally <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> of agriculture. The Welsh landscape (protected by three national parks) and 45 Blue Flag beaches, {{as well as}} the unique culture of Wales, attract large numbers of tourists, who play an especially vital role in the economy of rural areas. Wales has struggled to develop or attract high value-added employment in sectors such as finance and research and development, attributable in part to a comparative lack of 'economic mass' (i.e. population) – Wales lacks a large metropolitan centre. The lack of high value-added employment is reflected in lower economic output per head relative to other regions of the UK – in 2002 it stood at 90% of the EU25 average and around 80% of the UK average. In June 2008, Wales made history by becoming the first nation in the world to be awarded Fairtrade Status.|$|E
5|$|Herschel Shmoikel Pinchas Yerucham Krustofsky, {{better known}} as Krusty the Clown (sometimes spelled as Krusty the Klown), is a cartoon {{character}} in the animated television series The Simpsons. He is voiced by Dan Castellaneta. He is the long-time clown host of Bart and Lisa's favorite TV show, a combination of kiddie variety television hijinks and cartoons including The Itchy & Scratchy Show. Krusty is often portrayed as a cynical, burnt-out, addiction-riddled smoker who is made miserable by show business but continues on anyway. He {{has become one of}} the most common characters outside of the main Simpson family and has <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> of several episodes, most of which also spotlight Bart.|$|E

5|$|Japan Airlines has <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> {{of several}} {{television}} programs in Japan over the years, most being dramas revolving around cabin attendants. Attention Please was a drama in 1970 {{that followed the}} story of a young girl who joins JAL to be a cabin attendant while overcoming many difficulties. This show was remade in 2006 again as Attention Please starring Aya Ueto who joins a class of cabin attendant nominees and later graduates. Most of the action of the story of the 2006 series takes place at JAL's Haneda flight operations headquarters. The series has had two specials since the original, marking the main character's transition into JAL's international operations.|$|E
5|$|Lemurs have <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> of {{monographic}} series, action plans, field guides, {{and classic}} works in ethology. However, few {{species have been}} thoroughly studied to date, and most research has been preliminary and restricted to a single locality. Only recently have numerous scientific papers been published to explain the basic aspects of behavior and ecology of poorly known species. Field studies have given insights on population dynamics and evolutionary ecology of most genera and many species. Long-term research focused on identified individuals is in its infancy and has only been started for a few populations. However, learning opportunities are dwindling as habitat destruction and other factors threaten the existence of lemur populations across the island.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, several {{woodpeckers}} {{are under}} threat as their habitats are destroyed. Being woodland birds, deforestation and clearance {{of land for}} agriculture and other purposes can reduce populations dramatically. Some species adapt to living in plantations and secondary growth, or to open countryside with forest remnants and scattered trees, but some do not. A few species have even flourished when they have adapted to man-made habitats. There are few conservation projects directed primarily at woodpeckers, but they benefit whenever their habitat is conserved. The red-cockaded woodpecker has <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> of much conservation effort in the southeastern United States, with artificial cavities being constructed in the longleaf pines they favour as nesting sites.|$|E
