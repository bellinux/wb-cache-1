5|$|The {{most common}} type (60%) of {{seizures}} are convulsive. Of these, one-third <b>begin</b> <b>as</b> generalized seizures from the start, affecting both hemispheres of the brain. Two-thirds <b>begin</b> <b>as</b> focal seizures (which affect one hemisphere of the brain) which may then progress to generalized seizures. The remaining 40% of seizures are non-convulsive. An example of this type is the absence seizure, which presents as a decreased level of consciousness and usually lasts about 10 seconds.|$|E
5|$|Between {{the stars}} lies the {{interstellar}} medium, {{a region of}} sparse matter. In the densest regions, molecular clouds of molecular hydrogen and other elements create star-forming regions. These <b>begin</b> <b>as</b> a compact pre-stellar core or dark nebulae, which concentrate and collapse (in volumes determined by the Jeans length) to form compact protostars.|$|E

5|$|Tornadoes often <b>begin</b> <b>as</b> funnel clouds with no {{associated}} {{strong winds}} at the surface, {{and not all}} funnel clouds evolve into tornadoes. Most tornadoes produce strong winds at the surface while the visible funnel is still above the ground, so {{it is difficult to}} discern the difference between a funnel cloud and a tornado from a distance.|$|E

The project would involve extending Lafayette Street to the new ramp. This proposed slip ramp is projected to cost $160 million. Montgomery County officials have proposed a surcharge for the new exit in {{to help pay for the}} project. Work on engineering and environmental approval for the interchange occurred in 2008, and acquisition of land began in 2011.

5|$|Cyclogenesis {{describes}} {{the process of}} cyclone formation and intensification. Extratropical cyclones <b>begin</b> <b>as</b> waves in large regions of enhanced mid-latitude temperature contrasts called baroclinic zones. These zones contract and form weather fronts as the cyclonic circulation closes and intensifies. Later in their life cycle, extratropical cyclones occlude as cold air masses undercut the warmer air and become cold core systems. A cyclone's track is guided {{over the course of}} its 2 to 6 day life cycle by the steering flow of the subtropical jet stream.|$|E
5|$|The {{courtship}} {{rituals of}} the American goldfinch include aerial maneuvers and singing by males, who begin courtship in late July. The flight displays <b>begin</b> <b>as</b> the male pursues the female, who flies in zigzagging evasive patterns. The male {{is able to}} signal his quality and fitness, both {{in the short term}} (current body condition) and long term (genes), through ornamentation (bill color and plumage). If a female accepts the male as a mate, the pair will fly in wide circles, as the male warbles throughout the flight.|$|E

5|$|Given Huskisson's importance, and the {{potential}} impact {{on the future of}} Liverpool and Manchester's industries and on the embryonic railway industry of any findings of liability {{on the part of the}} railway, a swift determination of the causes of the accident was considered essential. By 9.00am on the morning after the accident, a hastily convened coroner's jury was assembled in the Grapes public house in Eccles. The coroner himself, MrMilne, arrived at 10.00am and was in a hurry to proceed as he had another inquest scheduled that afternoon, but proceedings were unable to <b>begin</b> <b>as</b> Lord Wilton, the only sworn witness scheduled to attend the inquest, could not be found. In the meantime, Milne sent the jury to the vicarage to view Huskisson's body.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of this disastrous expedition, and sensing his imminent removal as tyrant, Aristagoras chose to incite the whole of Ionia into rebellion against Darius the Great. The revolt then spread to Caria and Cyprus. Three years of Persian campaigning across Asia Minor followed, with no decisive effect, before the Persians regrouped and made straight for the epicentre of the rebellion at Miletus. At the Battle of Lade, the Persians decisively defeated the Ionian fleet and effectively ended the rebellion. Although Asia Minor had been brought back into the Persian fold, Darius vowed to punish Athens and Eretria, who had supported the revolt. In 492 BC therefore, the first Persian invasion of Greece, would <b>begin</b> <b>as</b> {{a consequence of the}} failed attack on Naxos, and the Ionian Revolt.|$|E
5|$|Opponents in Brooktondale to the {{construction}} felt the removal of trees would ruin the village. Feeling that the village of Brooktondale was not likely to grow in population {{as a result of}} this project, they questioned its purpose. Ruining the scenic narrative of the area would be a waste of taxpayer dollars, since the road just ends at two dirt roads in Guideboard Corners. Despite the opposition, the state met with Caroline town officials and they noted that about 20 people were opposed to the project while a petition of 547 people supporting the job existed. In early July1962, the state gave the go-ahead for the project to begin, but that the job would <b>begin</b> <b>as</b> early as 1963.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{theories}} {{propose that}} myths <b>began</b> <b>as</b> allegories for natural phenomena: Apollo represents the sun, Poseidon represents water, and so on. According to another theory, myths <b>began</b> <b>as</b> allegories for philosophical or spiritual concepts: Athena represents wise judgment, Aphrodite desire, and so on. MÃ¼ller supported an allegorical theory of myth. He believed myths <b>began</b> <b>as</b> allegorical descriptions {{of nature and}} gradually came to be interpreted literally. For example, a poetic description of the sea as [...] "raging" [...] was eventually taken literally and the sea was then {{thought of as a}} raging god.|$|R

5|$|The story {{takes place}} in Kolkata. As the credits roll, scenes from {{erstwhile}} Calcutta are displayed along with the narrator's (Amitabh Bachchan) introduction of the era. The narration focuses {{on the night of}} the marriage of Shekhar and Gayatri Tantiya, a rich industrialist's daughter. The audience is introduced to Naveen Roy as Shekhar's father while we see Shekhar grooming himself for the occasion. While he is doing so, images of Lalita calling him by his name flash through his mind. Downstairs, musical celebrations <b>begin</b> <b>as</b> Shekhar meets Vasundhara, a widow from his neighbourhood, who is thankful to her son-in-law, Girish (Sanjay Dutt), for supporting their family after the death of her husband, Gurcharan. Lalita, who is present there, playfully confronts Shekhar as to why he is being indifferent to her. Shekhar admonishes her for speaking so in spite of being married.|$|E
5|$|With {{defeat at}} Lade, the Ionian Revolt {{was all but}} ended. The next year, the Persians reduced the last rebel strongholds, and began the process of {{bringing}} peace to the region. The Ionian Revolt constituted the first major conflict between Greece and the Persian Empire, and as such represents {{the first phase of}} the Greco-Persian Wars. Although Asia Minor had been brought back into the Persian fold, Darius vowed to punish Athens and Eretria for their support for the revolt. Moreover, seeing that the myriad city states of Greece posed a continued threat to the stability of his empire, he decided to conquer the whole of Greece. In 492 BC, the first Persian invasion of Greece, the next phase of the Greco-Persian Wars, would <b>begin</b> <b>as</b> a direct consequence of the Ionian Revolt.|$|E
5|$|Written by Donald Tosh. Beginning life as The Rosacrutians, {{this story}} came about after Tosh {{contacted}} the production staff in early 1968 {{to see if}} they would be interested in him pitching a script. Initial discussion saw the story <b>begin</b> <b>as</b> a story featuring Jamie and Victoria, but by the time Tosh delivered the first materials for the story Patrick Troughton had already decided to depart the series. At the point it was turned down by the production team Tosh had completed a script for the first episode and notes for the subsequent three episodes. Tosh completed a full storyline for DWM in 1994. Set on an Earth Space station it deals with a conflict between the staff of the station and the Rosemariners, a group who plan to hold the staff hostage in return for Earth supplying them with sophisticated weapons. It was later adapted by Tosh for Big Finish's The Lost Stories range in September 2012.|$|E
