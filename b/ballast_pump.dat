40|$|An {{underwater}} glider is a buoyancy-propelled, fixedwing {{vehicle with}} attitude controlled completely, or in part, {{by means of}} internal mass redistribution. We have developed a physics-based nonlinear model {{of the dynamics of}} an underwater glider and adapted it to model the SLOCUM glider’s geometry, rudder, <b>ballast</b> <b>pump</b> and internal movable mass. In this paper we identify the model parameters to match the steady glides in new flight test data from the SLOCUM glider. In the process we also estimate the buoyancy trim offset of the glider used in the flight tests. ...|$|E
40|$|Underwater gliders {{have proven}} to be a {{powerful}} tool in oceanography because they are reusable, inexpensive and achieve a high duration. These qualities have made the acquisition of oceanographic data sets more accessible. The {{purpose of this article is}} to present a study aimed at modelling an underwater glider in the longitudinal and lateral plane. The proposed glider possesses a single stroke <b>ballast</b> <b>pump,</b> a moving internal mass and a symmetrical rudder design. It has an operational depth of 200 m and is geared for coastal and estuarine environments. To provide the vehicle with navigation, a localisation algorithm capable of tracking an underwater glider and estimating ocean currents is proposed. The glider design is evaluated in simulation and results are presented illustrating the anticipated behaviour of this system. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the dynamic model and motion simulation for propeller-driven USM underwater glider with independently controllable wings and rudder. The underwater glider {{is a highly}} efficient autonomous underwater vehicle which glides through the ocean water column in saw-tooth pattern. It uses buoyancy for propulsion by controlling <b>ballast</b> <b>pump</b> and internal moving mass. However, in our research work, we attempt to design an underwater glider which can be driven by buoyancy or propeller, and the external actuators (wings and rudder) can be controlled independently. We have designed the mathematical model and studied the dynamic characteristics of USM underwater glider. The simulation results demonstrate the motion of propeller-driven USM underwater glider based on different angles of wings and rudder. The results show the position of glider, linear and angular velocities of the glider, angle of attack and glider speed. With the resulting glider behavior in this open loop control output, we will extend the control approach {{in order to create}} an efficient biologically inspired control algorithm for an optimized hybrid-driven USM underwater glider...|$|E
5000|$|The pumping of {{the forward}} tanks was not {{possible}} using the usual ballast control method as {{the magnitude of the}} forward list created a vertical distance between the forward tanks and the <b>ballast</b> <b>pumps</b> located astern that exceeded the suction available on the ballast system's pumps; ...|$|R
50|$|When {{the track}} passed over shallow water {{travelling}} excavators were utilized {{to form a}} solid embankment of debris. Pipe-lines were laid down in some places along {{the center of the}} permanent way, and the <b>ballast</b> <b>pumped</b> through these conduits was deposited where required, the water draining off. The drying and draining of these embankments took a long while owing to the saturated state of the soil.|$|R
50|$|Roy A. Jodrey was a steel {{freighter}} {{owned by}} the Algoma Steel Ore Company. On 20 November 1974, Jodrey struck Pullman Shoal in the St. Lawrence river in Alexandria Bay. The ship was tied up to the nearby U.S. Coast Guard Station on Wellesley Island. All the crew members got off the ship safely. The <b>ballast</b> <b>pumps</b> were unable to keep the ship afloat and the ship sank on 21 November 1974 with no loss of life.|$|R
40|$|The thesis firstly {{includes}} {{a study of}} the structure and requirements of a general ballast system. Based on this knowledge a ballast system suiting the needs of the WindFlip concept was designed through using the risk-based design methodology (RBD). The presented ballast system has one sub-system for ballasting during rotation of WindFlip from horizontal to vertical position and back again (called main ballast system). Another sub-system (called the secondary ballast system) is used during transit without payload and during onloading of payload (one Hywind floating offshore wind turbine). The latter system is connected to an eductor circuit for stripping the ballast tanks. The main ballast system ballasts by flooding the ballast tanks. The tank is ventilated so it can flood freely, ventilation is closed when the tank is completely full. As WindFlip does not have a pressure hull, pressure is increased in empty ballast tanks when being submerged to compensate for increased hydrostatic pressure. During deballasting ventilation is used to relieve pressure gradually. Water in the ballast tanks is purged out by compressed air. The main ballast system has two main pipelines which are branched into feeder lines going into each tank. There are two valves connected to the feeder line leading into each tank; a butterfly valve and a pressure reduction valve (PRV). The butterfly valve is used for ventilation and the PRV for the compressed air. The function of the two main lines may be switched (from vent to compressed air and vice versa), and there is an interconnection between the two also securing redundancy. The main ballast system reaches out to 102 ballast tanks. The secondary ballast system reaches out to 27 ballast tanks. The layout of this system is quite similar to common ballast systems. The main difference is that it only has one <b>ballast</b> <b>pump,</b> which is allowed for unmanned barges according to DNV. An eductor system is included in the secondary ballast system for stripping the ballast tanks. This system may however not be mandatory, this should be discussed further with the classing society. A ballast treatment plant is not included in the design as WindFlip mostly will operate locally. There is however a possibility for conducting ballast exchange with the sequential method during continental travel. A Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) was performed in order to find the unreliability of the system. The most interesting result was that a failure during rotation is expected once every third year. The FTA was compared to the use of Bayesian networks (BN). The report shows that BN can replace the FTA and that BN is a more flexible method. </p...|$|E
5000|$|A {{distinct}} {{improvement on}} the Cornish engines {{used at the}} time, Worthington's pump embodied {{one of the most}} ingenious advances in engineering in the nineteenth century and its principle was widely applied. Because of their reliability and low operating cost, these pumps were greatly used thereafter in America for waterworks and for pumping oil through long pipe lines in the oil fields; they are still used (1936) for boiler feeding, tank and <b>ballast</b> <b>pumping,</b> and for hydraulic-press work.|$|R
5000|$|The boat's most {{successful}} patrol began {{when she left}} La Pallice on 10 June 1942. Having crossed the Atlantic Ocean, she was attacked by the Canadian minesweeper [...] shortly after torpedoing Dinaric (see below), in the St. Lawrence Seaway. The warship's depth charges damaged the U-boat's <b>ballast</b> <b>pumps</b> and resulted {{in the loss of}} 4 m³ of fuel. She sank three ships in short order, Anastasios Pateras, Hainaut and Dinaric, all southeast of Cap Chat, Quebec on 6 July.|$|R
2500|$|Various other {{functions}} {{are available in}} some cargo control rooms. [...] Many offer the person in charge additional monitoring and control systems, the ability to monitor inert gas systems, and tank pressures. [...] Modern cargo control rooms typically allow the person in charge to control <b>ballast</b> <b>pumps</b> and valves, and monitor oil content of ballast water {{by the use of}} oily water separators. [...] In cases where ships carry specialty products, specialized monitoring systems are available in the cargo control room.|$|R
2500|$|The ship's {{ballast water}} {{capacity}} of [...] {{is divided into}} sixteen segregated ballast tanks, six pairs located in the double hull around the cargo tanks, two fore peak tanks and two aft peak tanks. She has two electrically driven <b>ballast</b> <b>pumps</b> rated at 2,500 m3/h × 35 m and 3,000 m3/h × 70 m. The ballast capacity is needed to maintain correct trim especially during drydocking — the empty ship has an aft trim of [...] and an uneven weight distribution may damage the hull girder.|$|R
50|$|Most wakeboard-specific inboard-engine boats have {{multiple}} integrated ballast tanks that {{are filled with}} <b>ballast</b> <b>pumps</b> controlled from the helm with rocker switches. Typically the configuration {{is based on a}} three tank system with a tank {{in the center of the}} boat and two more in the rear of the boat on either side of the engine compartment. Just like larger ships when adding water ballast to smaller wakeboard boats the hull has a lower center of gravity, and increases the draft of the boat. Most wakeboard boat factory ballast systems can be upgraded with larger capacities by adding soft structured ballast bags.|$|R
5000|$|In July 1942, Captain Ernst Vogelsang piloted [...] {{into the}} Gulf. On 6 July, within half an hour, he sank three ships from the twelve-ship convoy QS-15: the British {{registered}} Dinaric and Hainaut, and the Greek vessel Anastassios Pateras. Eventually depth charge runs by a ship, [...] and four Curtiss P-40 Warhawk from No. 130 Squadron RCAF damaged the U-boat's <b>ballast</b> <b>pumps</b> {{and resulted in}} the loss of [...] of fuel and a few crewmen. This attack drove the submarine to the bottom where it hid for 12 hours. The submarine then rushed out of the Gulf for repairs.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the thesis {{was to develop a}} {{decision}} support system for ballast water treatment systems, considering both technical and economical aspects of the system. This was done by developing a two part model, which considers both physical constraint given by the ship, and KPI analysis. In order to test the model, it was applied on two vessels from KGJS fleet; MV Corrella Arrow, a 72. 000 DWT general cargo ship, and a cement carrier that is currently being built in Vietnam. For both these ships the model identified 6 – 8 systems that were applicable, but by applying ship specific constraints and additional knowledge of the systems it was possible to eliminate several other systems. As a means to further eliminate systems, a detailed analysis was required. When analysing the operational costs, it was found that installing a treatment system will increase the daily operational costs with $ 1 - $ 30, and increase the annual fuel consumption with 1 – 20 tons. This is negligible when compared to the installation and investment cost. For the cement carrier it was that two systems were applicable to the ship; OptiMarin Ballast System and Hyde Guardian. Where Hyde Guardian be too large, OptiMarin Ballast system will have a higher cost. Simplicity have to be considered against cost. For MV Corrella Arrow, WSE Unitor was found to be the best option. However, {{it should be noted that}} as the reactor unit is located before the <b>ballast</b> <b>pumps,</b> the negative effects it might have on the <b>ballast</b> <b>pumps</b> should be closely monitored after installation. </p...|$|R
50|$|Only three {{ships were}} built in this group, S-1, S-2 and S-3, using {{partially}} German-supplied machinery. The boats were of semi-double hull type, with riveted pressure hull and welded light hull sections in the superstructure and extremities for improved seaworthiness. The sail was medium-sized and oval in plane, to reduce water drag. It housed the conning tower, the bridge, periscope fairings and a 45 mm (1.77 in) anti-aircraft gun. A net cutter was fitted atop the bow. The hull was separated into seven compartments, three of which were able to withstand 10 atm pressure. Nine main ballast tanks, separated into three groups (4 bow, 2 stern, 3 midships), together with a balancing tank and a quick dive tank {{were placed in the}} light hull. Trimming tanks were inside the pressure hull. Ballast tanks were emptied by pressurized air or engines exhaust, thus removing the need for <b>ballast</b> <b>pumps.</b>|$|R
2500|$|On 21 September 1940, Broompark was {{travelling}} from Vancouver to Glasgow in convoy HX-72, {{laden with}} [...] of lumber and metal. At 23:38 it was torpedoed by a German U-boat, U-48. One crewman was killed. Paulsen {{was in his}} bunk at the time. When he reached the bridge, he found that 40 of his 48 crewmen had abandoned ship. With his chief engineer and the seven other crewmen on board, he had <b>ballast</b> <b>pumped</b> into the leeward bilge to lift the ship onto an even keel, and Broompark continued the voyage under its own steam. It was bombed and strafed by a Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condor {{off the coast of}} Scotland, but the Condor was driven off by anti-aircraft fire from Broompark and its escort. Broompark made port, and was repaired and restored to service. For his gallantry, Paulsen was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in January 1941. He was also awarded the Lloyd's War Medal for Bravery at Sea.|$|R
50|$|The <b>ballasting</b> water <b>pumped</b> out, the LCI rose {{up under}} the house and {{supported}} it as the remaining connections to the foundation were severed. The lighthouse was moved to a shore location {{at the mouth of}} Filbert's Creek just west of Edenton, North Carolina, where it would remain for over fifty years; it served as Wiggins's residence from 1960 until his death in 1995.|$|R
50|$|During {{unloading}} of {{the ship}} the ballast tanks are filled with 118,000 tons water. During her return voyage 20% of this <b>ballast</b> is <b>pumped</b> overboard after passing the Gulf of Biscay as the risk of bad weather decreases and the ship will use less fuel when she carries less ballast (which decreases her draught). During the return voyage the cargo area is painted to prevent wear. The return trip takes approximately 11 days.|$|R
50|$|Ship {{caissons}} {{are slow}} to operate and so, during the Victorian period, the more efficient 'sliding caission' (also 'floating-' or 'rolling caisson') was developed. This is a permanent fixture within the dock, like a hinged dock gate, and moves upon a fixed track. The sides of the caisson are vertical, making a narrow rectangular box. Water ballast is used to control its buoyancy, as for the ship caisson, but the floating caisson is then hauled sideways into a recess built {{into the side of}} the dock wall. Rolling caissons are a development of sliding caissons fitted with rollers beneath. These do not rely solely on buoyancy to make them portable and so are easier to operate. The caisson may only need to be lifted a few inches to make it movable on its track, which significantly reduces the <b>ballast</b> <b>pumping</b> time compared to a ship caisson. When closing the gate, the track guides it automatically back into place, avoiding the slow manoeuvering with tugs or winches necessary to align a ship caisson. Electrically-operated sliding caissons, installed around 1900, on the entrance of the Zeebrugge Canal to the North Sea could operate within two minutes.|$|R
50|$|When a large vessel {{such as a}} {{container}} ship or an oil tanker unloads cargo, seawater is pumped into other compartments in the hull to help stabilize and balance the ship. During loading, this <b>ballast</b> water is <b>pumped</b> out from these compartments.|$|R
3000|$|In particular, Minorsky [1] in 1962 {{considered}} {{the problem of}} stabilizing the rolling of a ship by an [...] "activated tanks method" [...] in which <b>ballast</b> water is <b>pumped</b> from one position to another. To solve this problem, he constructed several delay differential equations with damping described by (1.1).|$|R
2500|$|At 9:30 pm, on Saturday, May 20, 1899, Ocean Wave {{departed}} Port Angeles, Washington {{under the}} tow {{of the powerful}} ocean-going steam tug Richard Holyoke. [...] Ocean Wave was not built to operate on the open sea, so before the transfer, it had to boarded up to protect against breaking waves. [...] Water <b>ballast</b> was <b>pumped</b> into the hull. [...] The weather was good and Holyoke arrived with the tow a day earlier than expected, on May 24, 1899. [...] Once the boat arrived, and met with Santa Fe’s approval following inspection, the railroad purchased the vessel from Leale.|$|R
50|$|With {{improper}} ballast operations {{causing a}} substantial port list, fuel inadvertently began to flow by gravity (hydrostatic balancing) from starboard to port, thereby increasing {{the severity of}} the list and eventually causing the aft deck to become awash. An unknown amount of sea water is likely to have entered the #19 & 20 aft ballast tanks through their deck vents, reducing reserve buoyancy further and adding more free surface effect. To counteract this the Captain ordered all <b>ballast</b> to be <b>pumped</b> off, then agreed 20 minutes later to stop <b>pumping</b> <b>ballast</b> water out of the #18 port ballast tank and start <b>pumping</b> <b>ballast</b> water into the #18 starboard ballast tank from the sea (the vessel was not configured to allow internal ballast transfers), causing even more loss of reserve buoyancy. All the while, the barge had been creeping up on them and was now just off the port quarter, with the weight of the tow wire hanging off the port side of the tug. All of this was greatly compounded by the chief mate suffering a fatal fall down the ladder from the wheelhouse and then the loss of an able seaman overboard. Shortly after midnight on the 18th the crew finally released the tow to avoid being tripped. Valour continued to list and roll further to port until it was on its side, then sea water began entering the vessel through the engine room vents on the stack deck.|$|R
50|$|The {{overhaul}} included {{new equipment}} {{to allow the}} dock to submerge and surface by <b>pumping</b> <b>ballast</b> water, {{rather than by the}} previous compressed air system. The barge is no longer capable of submerging completely. Like other floating drydocks, it takes on enough water to allow entry of a vessel, then <b>pumps</b> out <b>ballast</b> until the interior of the dock is above water.|$|R
500|$|Within 45 {{minutes of}} the collision, at least [...] of water had entered the ship. This was far too much for Titanics <b>ballast</b> and bilge <b>pumps</b> to handle; the total pumping {{capacity}} of all the pumps combined was only [...] per hour. Andrews informed the captain that the first five compartments were flooded, and therefore Titanic was doomed. [...] By his estimate, she could remain afloat for no longer than about two hours.|$|R
50|$|A {{ballast tank}} is a {{compartment}} within a boat, ship or other floating structure that holds water, {{which is used}} as ballast to provide stability for a vessel. Using water in a tank allows for easier adjustment of weight than stone or iron ballast as was used in older vessels. It also allows for <b>ballast</b> to be <b>pumped</b> out to temporarily reduce the draft of the vessel when required to enter shallower water.|$|R
50|$|Where a caisson is used, means must be {{provided}} to <b>pump</b> <b>ballast</b> water out to float it, to move it {{in and out of}} position, and to seal around the caisson when in place. Its operating equipment may be part of the gate, if the gate is frequently used, or general dockside equipment such as pumps and capstans may be used if it is rarely used, such as for a dry dock.|$|R
50|$|Within 45 {{minutes of}} the collision, at least 13500 LT of water had entered the ship. This was far too much for Titanics <b>ballast</b> and bilge <b>pumps</b> to handle; the total pumping {{capacity}} of all the pumps combined was only 1700 LT per hour. Andrews informed the captain that the first five compartments were flooded, and therefore Titanic was doomed. By his estimate, she could remain afloat for no longer than about two hours.|$|R
40|$|Man live in two worlds, the {{biosphere}} and the techno sphere world over the years, time needs, growth, speed, and knowledge and competition have created demand that necessitated man to build complex institution. Ship design is not {{left out in}} this process. Inland water, are under treat from untreated waste that can feed bacteria and algae, which in turn exhaust the oxygen. The ocean cover 70 % of the globe, many think that everything that run into it is infinite, the ocean is providing the source of freshening winds and current that are far more vulnerable to polluting activities that have run off into them too many poisons, that the ocean may cease to serve more purpose if care is not taking to prevent pollution. This issue of environment becomes so sensitive in recently and most are linked to infrastructure development work. Most especially in maritime industry polluting activities from oil bilge to <b>ballast</b> <b>pumping</b> that has turned into poison has advert effect on water resources. Some have choked too much estuarine water where there is fish spawn. In a nutshell, the two worlds we live are currently out of balance and in potential conflict. Man {{is in the middle}}, and since the treat are mostly water related, ship is in the middle too. Historical records of number of calamity that has resulted to heavy lost and pollution call for environmentally sound ship. This has led to a number of regulations today that will subsequently affect policies change and procedures interaction with the system. The current situation has affected the design of new ships and modification of existing ships. This paper review and discuss green technology emanating from regulations and highlight new system design being driven by marine pollution prevention and, protection and control regulation...|$|R
50|$|Stevens {{renamed the}} vessel after himself. Many {{contemporary}} newspapers and later historians mistakenly confused the E.A. Stevens with the Stevens Battery. Edwin Stevens designed the gunboat {{to operate in}} shallow waters. The iron hull's ballast tanks were placed at the fore and aft extremes of the hull, and utilized a patented gum rubber liner to ensure a watertight seal. These ballast tanks were {{used to make the}} vessel semi-submersible, allowing the hull to change its draft from 7 ft to 9 ft. The 2 ft reduced freeboard minimized the vessel’s vulnerability to gunfire, keeping the steam machinery below the waterline. Stevens added heavy duty centrifugal pumps that could fill ballast in minutes or, if the boat grounded while <b>ballasted</b> down, <b>pump</b> out to refloat the vessel quickly. With the ballast tanks dry, the vessel's speed increased from 4 kn to over 9 kn.|$|R
50|$|The {{double hull}} has water <b>ballast</b> between, with <b>pumps</b> that can move ballast water {{at up to}} 74 tonnes a minute to aid ice breaking. The hull {{thickness}} is 45 mm at the ice skirt and 25-35 mm elsewhere. Friction between the ship and the ice is reduced by a polymer-paint coating {{at the level of}} the ice skirt. An air bubbling system helps ice breaking. Air can be forced under pressure from 2 m above the keel from the bow to halfway down the ship.|$|R
30|$|When large ships offload their cargo, they flood {{ballast tanks}} with {{seawater}} for stability {{on the return}} trip. Ballast water is widely used on ships to ensure manoeuvrability and stability when cargoes are unloaded (La Carbona et al. 2010). Without proper ballast, the ship’s centre of gravity is too high and can result in their capsizing. At the cargo loading port, the <b>ballast</b> water is <b>pumped</b> into the harbour in order to load more cargo. When <b>ballast</b> water is <b>pumped</b> overboard it may carry with it aquatic nuisance species that can seriously harm indigenous species in ports and coastal waters. These nuisance species may include unwanted bacteria such as Escherichia coli or Vibrio cholerae and animals such as zebra mussels. In addition, the ballast tanks are often contaminated with invasive species of animals, plants, and bacteria from the previous port. The BWMC (Ballast Water Management Convention) 2004 protects the sea environment through regulations regarding future ballast water treatment. Regulations and standards established by the IMO (International Maritime Organization) require treatment limits to be met independently and calls for vessels to carry out monitoring themselves (Albert et al. 2013). Ballast water {{will have to be}} treated once this convention comes into effect (Gregg et al. 2009).|$|R
40|$|A {{practical}} and inexpensive implementation of dimmable electronic ballast for {{compact fluorescent lamps}} is presented. Popular triac dimmer is used for dimming control, while phase-control methodology is employed in eliminating extra control wires. Various types of passive power factor correctors are examined in replacing active power factor correctors to reduce cost {{and complexity of the}} <b>ballast.</b> Charge <b>pump</b> techniques are being investigated in improving the power factor. To achieve stable control of the lamp, especially when it is dimmed down to 10 % of its maximum intensity, a novel application of switching frequency modulation is introduced. To minimize the effect due to fluctuation of the power line, feedforward control is added. The design of EMI (electromagnetic interference) filter is discussed, in arriving at a good performance lighting system. The thesis also discusses technical details of peripheral circuits for start up, dc supply, and automatic shutdown at low intensity...|$|R

5000|$|Racing yachts try {{to reduce}} the wetted surface area, which creates drag, by keeping the hull light whilst having a deep and heavy bulb keel, {{allowing}} them to support a tall mast with a great sail area. Modern designs {{tend to have a}} very wide beam and a flat bottom aft, to provide buoyancy preventing an excessive heel angle and to promote surfing and planing. Speeds of up to 35 knots can be attained in extreme conditions. Dedicated offshore racing yachts sacrifice crew comfort for speed, having basic accommodation to reduce weight. Modern racing yachts may have twin rudders because of the wide stern. Since about 2000 water <b>ballast</b> transfer <b>pumps</b> have become more common as have transversely swinging keels. Both these stiffen the yacht and allow more sail to be carried in stronger winds. Depending on the type of race, such a yacht may have a crew of 15 or more.
