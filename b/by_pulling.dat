However, peroxisomal ABC transporters of land plants are synthesised as a single polypeptide which represents a fused heterodimer. The N- and C-terminal pseudo-halves of COMATOSE (CTS; AtABCD 1) were expressed as separate polypeptides which bound Pex 19 in vitro and targeted independently to the peroxisome membrane in yeast, where they were stable but not functional. When co-expressed, the pseudo-halves were fully functional as indicated by ATPase activity and rescue of the pxa 1 pxa 2 Δ mutant for growth on oleate. The functional significance of heterodimer asymmetry is discussed.

40|$|AbstractHere {{we report}} a {{regulatory}} {{mechanism by which}} LKB 1 is controlled by 14 - 3 - 3 proteins through phorsphorylation of Thr 336. The results from the current study indicate that 14 - 3 - 3 ζ inhibits LKB 1 from phosphorylating its substrate, AMPK (AMP-dependent protein kinase) and attenuates LKB 1 -mediated G 1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis by interfering with the interaction between LKB 1 and its substrates. This regulation does not change either the LKB 1 catalytic activity or subcellular localization of LKB 1. Moreover, we demonstrate that serum starvation enhances LKB 1 activity and increases the phosphorylation of Thr 336. Taken together, our results suggest that autophosphorylation of Thr 336 acts as an activating signal for LKB 1 to recruit 14 - 3 - 3, which in turn attenuates the activation of LKB 1 to keep the activity of LKB 1 in check.

In this report, we identified importin α as a novel target of S 100 A 6. Importin α contains armadillo repeats, essential for binding to nuclear localization signals. Based on the results from GST pull-down assay, gel-shift assay, and co-immunoprecipitation, we demonstrated that S 100 A 6 specifically interacts with the armadillo repeats of importin α in a Ca 2 +-dependent manner, resulting in inhibition of the nuclear localization signal (NLS) -importin α complex formation in vitro and in vivo. These results indicate S 100 A 6 may regulate the nuclear transport of NLS-cargos in response to increasing concentrations of intracellular Ca 2 +.

Here we report that coilin interacts with Ku 70 and Ku 80, which are major players in the DNA repair process. Ku proteins compete with SMN and SmB′ proteins for coilin interaction sites. The binding domain on coilin for Ku proteins cannot be localized to one discrete region, and only full-length coilin is capable of inhibiting in vitro non-homologous DNA end joining (NHEJ). Since Ku proteins do not accumulate in CBs, these findings suggest that nucleoplasmic coilin participates in the regulation of DNA repair.

Here, we describe the purification and subunit composition of the fission yeast MCMMcb 1 complex.

As the pitch of the clarinet is fairly temperature-sensitive, some instruments have interchangeable barrels whose lengths vary slightly. Additional compensation for pitch variation and tuning can be made <b>by</b> <b>pulling</b> out the barrel and thus increasing the instrument's length, particularly common in group playing in which clarinets are tuned to other instruments (such as in an orchestra or concert band). Some performers use a plastic barrel with a thumbwheel that adjusts the barrel length. On basset horns and lower clarinets, the barrel is normally replaced by a curved metal neck.|$|E

Here we identified specific domains of FA protein paxillin interacting with AJ protein and examined regulation of paxillin domain interactions with β-catenin by Rac GTPase. Co-expression of paxillin LD- 1, 2; LD- 3, 4; LIM- 1, 2; and LIM- 3, 4 domains with β-catenin showed exclusive interaction of LIM- 1, 2 and LIM- 3, 4 with β-catenin, which was enhanced by agonist-induced Rac activation or expression of activated Rac mutant. These results demonstrate a novel function of paxillin LIM domains in targeting β-catenin in a Rac-dependent manner, which {{may play a}} role in Rac-dependent control of FA-AJ interactions and monolayer integrity.

40|$|AbstractThe small G-protein Rheb regulates cell growth via the mTORC 1 complex by incompletely {{understood}} mechanisms. Recent studies {{document that}} Rheb activates mTORC 1 via direct, GTP-dependent {{interaction with the}} peptidyl-prolyl-cis/trans-isomerase FKBP 38, which is proposed {{to act as an}} inhibitor of mTORC 1. We have conducted a comprehensive biochemical characterization of the Rheb/FKBP 38 interaction. Using three different in vitro assays we did not detect an interaction between Rheb and FKBP 38. Cell biological experiments illustrate that FKBP 38 plays only a very minor, if any, role in mTORC 1 activation. Our data document that FKBP 38 is not the long-sought Rheb effector linking Rheb to mTORC 1 activation.

40|$|AbstractThe small GTPases Rac 1 and Cdc 42 are key {{regulators}} of the cytoskeleton. We {{have previously}} identified the endocytic protein Intersectin as a binding partner and regulator of Cdc 42 GTPase-activating protein (CdGAP) with activity towards Rac 1 and Cdc 42. This interaction is mediated through the SH 3 D domain of Intersectin {{and the central}} domain of CdGAP, which does not contain any typical proline-rich domain or known SH 3 -binding motif. Here, we have characterized the Intersectin-SH 3 D/CdGAP interaction. We show that Intersectin-SH 3 D interacts directly with a small region of CdGAP highly enriched in basic residues and comprising a novel conserved xKx(K/R) K motif.

5|$|Another {{issue was}} whether the {{exterior}} shutter over Madeleine's bedroom window could be opened from outside. According to journalist Danny Collins, the shutter was made of non-ferrous metal slats on a roller blind that was housed in a box {{at the top of}} the inside window, controlled <b>by</b> <b>pulling</b> on a strap. Once rolled down, the slats locked in place outside the window and could be raised only by using the strap on the inside. Kate said the shutter and window were closed when Madeleine was put to bed, but open when she discovered Madeleine was missing. Gerry told the Polícia Judiciária that, when he was first alerted to the disappearance, he had lowered the shutter, then had gone outside and discovered that it could be raised only from the outside. Against this, the police said the shutter could not be raised from the outside without being forced, but there was no sign of forced entry; they also said forcing the shutter open would have caused a lot of noise.|$|E

When Chef learns that Kyle's brother was abducted and sees a machine emerge from Cartman's anus, he helps the boys escape from school <b>by</b> <b>pulling</b> the fire alarm. Once outside, Cartman reiterates that his abduction was only a dream, when suddenly he is hit by a beam, causing him to begin singing and dancing to I Love to Singa.

5|$|In 1642 the English Civil War {{broke out}} and the Royalists made Oxford their capital. Parliamentary forces {{successfully}} besieged Oxford in 1646 and the city was occupied by Colonel Ingoldsby. Ingoldsby improved the fortification of the castle rather than the surrounding town, and in 1649 demolished most of the medieval stonework, replacing it with more modern earth bulwarks and reinforcing the keep with earth works to form a probable gun-platform. In 1652, in the third English Civil War, the Parliamentary garrison responded to the proximity of Charles II's forces <b>by</b> <b>pulling</b> down these defences as well and retreating to New College instead, causing great damage to the college in the process. In the event, Oxford saw no fresh fighting; early in the 18th century, however, the keep was demolished {{and the top of}} the motte landscaped to its current form.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{transcriptional}} coactivator TAZ recognizes L/PPxY motifs in transcription {{factors like}} Runx 1 / 2 through its WW domain. We {{show that the}} first PDZ domain of zona occludens- 1 (ZO- 1) and 2 (ZO- 2) interacts with the carboxy-terminal PDZ binding motif of TAZ. Deletion of this motif abrogates binding. ZO- 2 colocalizes with TAZ in the nucleus of MDCK cells and ZO- 2 expression alters TAZ localization in human embryonic kidney cells. Luciferase assays demonstrate ZO- 2 inhibition of TAZ-mediated transactivation. We propose that zonula occludens is a negative regulator of TAZ and suggest that selected tight junction proteins control nuclear translocation and activity of TAZ.

40|$|AbstractThe {{mechanism}} {{underlying the}} protein–protein interaction of hnRNP K and PRMT family proteins is unclear. We examined and confirmed the arginine methylation of hnRNP K protein by PRMT 1, not CARM 1, via their direct binding. We also studied hnRNP K protein complexes containing CARM 1, {{as well as}} PRMT 1, using co-immunoprecipitation analysis. PRMT family proteins might {{be involved in the}} regulation of hnRNP K functions in nuclear receptor coactivator, transactivation, and p 21 gene and protein expressions.
