40|$|Satellite-acquired, {{remotely}} sensed {{observations of}} the earth's land areas are substantially advancing knowledge of global vegetation patterns. Recognition that combined visible/near infrared spectral reflectance observations are a general indicator of the presence, condition and magnitude of vegetation foliage provides a basis for explanation.

The satellite-observed patterns are strongly related to the known climatology of the continents and may offer a means to improve understanding of global <b>bioclimatology.</b> For example, South America is shown to have a longer growing season with much earlier spring green-up than North America. The time integral of the measurements, computed from 12 composited monthly values, produces a value that is related to published net primary productivity data.

As interpolation technique, we used regression kriging which combines multiple linear regression (MLR) with ordinary kriging of the residuals. MLR procedures include as independent variables: altitude, latitude, longitude, coast distance and a topographic factor of relative elevation.

The 30 th July of 2005 was chosen as a representative day for case study, because the amount of total ozone dropped 12. 5 % below the long-term mean at Hradec Králové observatory. The statistical model for estimating daily values of UV-B radiation (developed at Institute of Agrosystems and <b>Bioclimatology</b> at Mendel University of Agriculture and Forestry in Brno) was used for 88 stations from the Czech Republic. This model requires (as an input data) values of daily sum of Global radiation (RG), daily sum of extraterrestrial radiation (RA), amount of total ozone and altitude. Firstly, daily sums of UV-B for each station based on measured total ozone content were derived. Subsequently these values were compared with results of model which corresponds to average amount of total ozone content. The UV-B increment during 30 th July 2005 (as effect of stratospheric ozone decrease) reached 323. 6 J·m- 2 ·day- 1 at the average in the Czech Republic.

40|$|The {{number of}} {{variables}} involved in the monitoring of an ecosystem can be high and often {{one of the first}} stages in the analysis is to reduce the {{number of variables}}. We describe a method developed for geological purposes, using the information theory, that enables selection of the most relevant variables. This technique also allows the examination of the asymmetrical relationships between variables. Applied to a set of physical and biological variables (plankton assemblages in four areas of the North Sea), the method shows that biological variables are more informative than physical variables although the controlling factors are mainly physical (sea surface temperature in winter and spring). Among biological variables, diversity measures and warm-water species assemblages are informative for the state of the North Sea pelagic ecosystems while among physical variables sea surface temperature in late winter and early spring are highly informative. Although often used in <b>bioclimatology,</b> the utilisation of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index does not seem to provide a lot of information. The method reveals that only the extreme states of this index has an influence on North Sea pelagic ecosystems.

40|$|Mountains are {{hotspots}} of biodiversity. Yet, evaluating {{their importance}} in global biodiversity inventories requires {{the adoption of}} a pertinent definition of mountains. Here, we first compare the well-established WCMC and GMBA definitions, which both use geographical information systems. We show that the WCMC approach arrives at twice the global mountain area and much higher human population numbers than the GMBA one, which is explained by the inclusion of (mostly) low latitude hill country below 600 m elevation. We then present an inventory of the world’s mountains based on the GMBA definition. In this inventory, each of the 1003 entries corresponds to a polygon drawn around a mountain or a mountain range and includes the name of the delineated object, the area of mountainous terrain it covers stratified into different bioclimatic belts (all at 2. 5 ′ resolution), and demographic information. Taken together, the 1003 polygons cover 13. 8 Mio km 2 of mountain terrain, of which 3. 3 Mio km 2 are in the alpine and nival belts. This corresponds to 83. 7 % of the global mountain area sensu GMBA, and 94 % of the alpine/nival area. The 386 Mio people inhabiting mountainous terrain within polygons represent 75 % of the people globally inhabiting mountains sensu GMBA. This inventory offers a robust framework for the integration of mountain biota in regional and larger scale biodiversity assessments, for biogeography, <b>bioclimatology,</b> macroecology, and conservation research, and for the exploration of a multitude of socio-ecological and climate change-related research questions in mountain biota, including the potential pressure on alpine ecosystems...|$|E

The goal of the paper was to show bioclimatic differences during the summer between the city of Belgrade (116 m a. s. l.) and the mountain resort of Zlatibor (1498 m a. s. l.). The basic principle of bioclimatic analysis is the human heat balance between man and environment. This methodological approach is a combination of physiological and meteorological parameters that result in thermophysiological bioclimatic indices: heat load (HL) in man and the Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI). For this analysis, weather data for July, as the warmest month, was obtained, using daily meteorological data for the decade from 2000 to 2010. Results for July indicate a considerable difference between the two abovementioned environments. HL in Belgrade was dominated by degrees of comfort “hot” and “extremely hot, with the highest value of 4. 540, while for Zlatibor the dominant degree of comfort was “warm”. The UTCI in Belgrade has dominated by strong heat stress and moderate heat stress, compared to Zlatibor where the UTCI is dominated by moderate heat stress. In addition, a significant {{part of the}} monitored decade on Mt. Zlatibor was without heat stress, with the exception of 2006 and 2007, indicating favorable biothermal characteristics.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to look for a new method, to obtain the maximum production, and the minimum economic and environmental cost. Scientific advances in <b>bioclimatology</b> have brought a greater understanding of the functioning of plant individuals, populations and communities, and the study and interpretation of bioclimatic indices reveals the close relationship between the values of these indices and crop yields. In cases where insufficient meteorological data are available to allow the various formulas to be applied, thermoclimatic and ombroclimatic bioindicators must be used, some of which have been collected by us in previous works. This paper contains a bioclimatic study of the southern Iberian Peninsula in relation to the main olive varieties grown in these territories. We establish the values of some key indices for cultivation: continentality index (Ic), which determines the annual thermal range and allows us to establish the period of vegetative activity (PAV); the ombrothermic index (Io), which measures the ombrotype in the different sites; and the thermicity and compensated thermicity index, which denote the thermotype in the territory (It/Itc). In the relationship between the value of the bioclimatic indices and olive production, good fits are obtained in the regression analysis with R 2 > 0. 90, and is very positive influence of the different parameters used. In conclusion the greatest influence on the production of Ic is between 18. 5 - 19. 5, Io 3. 5 - 4. 5 and It / Itc 320 - 350.

This organic matter will also improve both the retention and hydraulic characteristics of the degraded soils, all this contributing to soil restoration. In this study, the microbiological, biochemical, soil-physical and hydrological effects of the addition of a municipal solid waste compost to a degraded soil in El Campello, SE Spain were evaluated in a field experiment. Soil samples from experimental plots were analyzed 6 and 18 months after soil amendment. In both sampling time treated plots showed significantly higher microbial biomass carbon and dehydrogenase activity values than control, indicating that soil microbial population’s development and activity were stimulated by compost addition, this effect being not ephemeral but lasting in the time. Soil urease activity was not affected by compost addition while protease hydrolysing N-α-benzoil-L-argininamide (BAA) activity was strongly stimulated by the incorporation of compost into the soils. Phosphatase and β-glucosidase activities were also stimulated by the organic amendment, this stimulation being particularly noticeable 18 months after the compost addition. Nevertheless, this increase in soil microbial populations and activity did not result in an increase in soil aggregation and hydrological parameters. This can be due to the high content of carbonates and Ca 2 + ions in these calcareous soils, that lead to an initially high content of water-stable macroaggregates. Peer reviewe...|$|E
