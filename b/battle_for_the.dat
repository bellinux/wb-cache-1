5|$|On May 25, 1948, {{during the}} <b>battle</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Old City, {{commander}} of the Jordanian Arab Legion, Major Abdullah el-Tell, wrote to Otto Lehner of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement to warn that unless the Haganah abandoned its positions in the synagogue and its adjoining courtyard, he {{would be forced to}} attack it. Moshe Russnak, {{commander of the}} Haganah in the Old City, ignored his request, knowing that if the Hurva fell, the <b>battle</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Jewish Quarter would soon be lost. On May 26, 1948, the Jordanian Arab Legion delivered an ultimatum to the Jews to surrender within 12 hours; otherwise the Hurva would be bombarded.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the regular}} Confederate {{military}} had a paper strength of 6,000 personnel, the first 100,000 volunteers {{from all over}} the South participated in a variety of dress. Many were from state militia outfits, which had their own state-issued uniforms. In the early battles, some Confederate units that wore dark blue uniforms were often mistaken on the field of <b>battle</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> enemy. Conversely, many Union units that were originally militia units went to war wearing gray.|$|E

The shell of the building survived the blaze and the structure was later reconstructed.|$|E
5|$|During week 8, Michigan faced Minnesota in {{the annual}} <b>battle</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Little Brown Jug. Although Michigan had won ten {{straight}} against Minnesota, the Golden Gophers had previously ruined a perfect season for a 9–0 1986 Michigan team. Michigan entered the game ranked first nationally in both scoring defense (8.1 points per game) and pass efficiency defense (79.62 rating).|$|E

5|$|The Suvla landing was {{reinforced}} {{by the arrival of}} the British 53rd and 54th Divisions along with the British 10th Division from Kitchener's New Army divisions plus the dismounted yeomanry of the 2nd Mounted Division. The unfortunate 29th Division was also shifted from Helles to Suvla for one more push. The final British attempt to resuscitate the offensive came on 21 August with attacks at Scimitar Hill and Hill 60. Control of these hills would have united the Anzac and Suvla fronts, but neither battle achieved success. When fighting at Hill 60 ceased on 29 August, the <b>battle</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Sari Bair heights, and indeed the <b>battle</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> peninsula, was effectively over.|$|E
5|$|The loss knocked Tech out of {{contention}} {{for the national}} championship and the conference championship, since Miami was a fellow member of the Big East. The Hokies also fell to No. 8 in the AP Poll during the week after the game. In that week, they rebounded by beating the University of Central Florida, 4421. Ranked No. 6 after the win, Tech defeated in-state rival Virginia, 4221, in the annual <b>battle</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Commonwealth Cup.|$|E
5|$|The result meant Bräck's {{advantage}} over de Ferran in the Drivers' Championship {{was reduced to}} six points.

Da Matta's strong finish allowed him to move from eighth to fifth. Honda's lead over Ford Cosworth in the Manufacturers' Championship was increased, while Toyota maintained third place, with four races left in the season.|$|E

5|$|Adomnán in his Life of Saint Columba {{offers a}} longer account, which Abbot Ségéne {{had heard from}} Oswald himself. Oswald, he says, {{had a vision of}} Columba the night before the battle, in which he was toldBe strong and act manfully. Behold, I will be with thee. This coming night go out from your camp into <b>battle,</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Lord has granted me that at this time your foes shall be put to flight and Cadwallon your enemy shall be {{delivered}} into your hands and you shall return victorious after battle and reign happily. Oswald described his vision to his council and all agreed that they would be baptised and accept Christianity after the battle. In the battle that followed, the British were routed despite their superior numbers; Cadwallon himself was killed.|$|E

5|$|After {{peace talks}} between the Germans and the Finnish Reds were broken off on 11 April, the true <b>battle</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> capital of Finland began. On 12 April, at 5 a.m. 2,000–3,000 German {{soldiers}} from the Brigade von Tshirsky attacked the city from the north-west, supported via the Helsinki-Turku railway. The Germans broke through the area between Munkkiniemi and Pasila, and advanced on the central-western parts of the town. The German naval squadron Meurer blocked the city harbour, bombarded the southern town area, and landed naval troops at Katajanokka.|$|E
5|$|After the {{conclusion}} of the <b>battle</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Donets, as the spring rasputitsa (mud) season came to an end in 1943, both the German and Soviet commands considered their plans for future operations. The Soviet premier Joseph Stalin and some senior Soviet officers wanted to seize the initiative first and attack the German forces inside the Soviet Union, but they were convinced by a number of key commanders, including the Deputy Supreme Commander Georgiy Zhukov, to assume a defensive posture instead. This would allow the German side to weaken themselves in attacking prepared positions, after which the Soviet forces would be able to respond with a counter-offensive.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the Japanese air attacks on the task force, one U.S. heavy cruiser was sunk, a {{destroyer}} was heavily damaged, {{and the rest of the}} U.S. task force was forced to retreat from the southern Solomons area. Partly because they turned back the U.S. task force in this battle, the Japanese successfully evacuated their remaining troops from Guadalcanal by 7 February 1943, leaving it in the hands of the Allies and ending the <b>battle</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> island.|$|E
