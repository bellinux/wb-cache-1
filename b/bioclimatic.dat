5|$|Their native {{habitats}} {{are very}} varied, with different elevations, <b>bioclimatic</b> areas and substrates, being found predominantly in open spaces ranging from low marshes to rocky hillsides and montane pastures, and including grassland, scrub, woods, river banks and rocky crevices. Although requirements vary, overall {{there is a}} preference for acidic soils, although some species will grow on limestone. Narcissus scaberulus will grow on granite soils where it is moist in the growing season but dry in the summer, while Narcissus dubius thrives best in regions with hot and dry summers.|$|E
25|$|Under the Köppen–Geiger climate {{classification}} system, Dnipro has a hot-summer humid {{continental climate}} (Dfa) with hot summers and cold, snowy winters. However, according to other schemes (such as the Salvador Rivas-Martínez <b>bioclimatic</b> one), Dnipro has a Supratemperate bioclimate, and {{belongs to the}} Temperate xeric steppic thermoclimatic belt, due to high evapotranspiration, Dnipro is in the transition zone between a humid subtropical climate (Cfa) and a hot-summer humid continental climate (Dfa), with relatively drier summers {{than the rest of}} the year.|$|E
25|$|Solar {{chimneys}}, {{also called}} heat chimneys or heat stacks, {{can also be}} used in architectural settings to decrease the energy used by mechanical systems (systems that heat and cool the building through mechanical means). Air conditioning and mechanical ventilation have been for decades the standard method of environmental control in many building types, especially offices, in developed countries. Pollution and reallocating energy supplies have led to a new environmental approach in building design. Innovative technologies along with <b>bioclimatic</b> principles and traditional design strategies are often combined to create new and potentially successful design solutions. The solar chimney is one of these concepts currently explored by scientists as well as designers, mostly through research and experimentation.|$|E
500|$|The {{climate of}} the Vikos–Aoös National Park is Mediterranean, {{transitioning}} to continental. The Mediterranean character {{is characterized by the}} annual distribution of precipitation, high in the winter months and experiencing a drought period of two to three months in summer. The continental climatic element is attributed to the high amplitude of annual temperature variation, {{to such a degree that}} the difference between mean maximum and mean minimum annual temperature, exceeds [...] The {{climate of the}} area is quite unique due to the complex relief, variation in altitude, and the position of the area with regard to the Ionian Sea coastline. The mean annual temperature and annual precipitation are [...] and [...] respectively. Extremely low temperatures occur in the area during the winter months. Compared to Mediterranean <b>bioclimatic</b> divisions, the area belongs to the humid zone with cold winters.|$|E
500|$|Mogadishu {{is located}} {{in or near the}} {{tropical}} thorn woodland biome of the Holdridge global <b>bioclimatic</b> scheme. The mean temperature in the city year round is 27°C, with an average maximum of 30°C and an average minimum of 24°C. Mean temperature readings per month vary by 3°C (5.4°F), corresponding with a hyperoceanic and subtype truly hyperoceanic continentality type. Precipitation per year averages [...] There are 47 wet days annually, which are associated with a 12% annual daily probability of rainfall. The city has an average of 3,066 hours of sunshine per year, with 8.4 hours of sunlight per day. Mean daylight hours and minutes per day are 8h 24'. The annual percentage of sunny versus cloudy daylight hours is 70 and 30, respectively. Average sun altitude at solar noon on the 21st day of the month is 75.|$|E
2500|$|Four {{vegetation}} associations {{have been}} delineated in two <b>bioclimatic</b> life zones. [...] The two climatic biome zones are: the subtropical moist forest life zone (31% of the forest) {{and the lower}} mountain wet forest life zone (the remaining 69% of the forest). The topography is accentuated by {{a large number of}} steep slopes and high waterfalls. [...] Toro Negro subforests are catalogued {{on the basis of their}} elevation and content. From Cerro Maravilla, one of the tallest peaks in the forest, four of Puerto Rico's distinct forest types can be seen: Bosque Tabonuco, Bosque Micropholis Buchenavia, Bosque Sierra de Palmas, and Bosque enano.|$|E
2500|$|The {{hypothesis}} is sometimes also applied to humans as apex predators that produce top-down effects on lower trophic levels. [...] However, {{it fails to}} recognize bottom-up effects that anthropogenic land transformations can have on landscapes on which primary producers, prey species, and mesopredators dwell. [...] Possible bottom-up effects on an ecosystem can be from <b>bioclimatic</b> impacts on ecosystem productivity and from anthropogenic habitat alterations. [...] Examples of anthropogenic habitat change include agriculture, grazing land, and urbanization. [...] More importantly, the hypothesis {{does not take into}} account that higher trophic levels are affected by primary productivity. [...] It also does not mention that trophic interactions operate at different strengths according to the ecosystem. [...] Therefore, the roles of predation and food/nutrient processes in influencing ecosystem structures remain open to controversy and further testing.|$|E
2500|$|There is no {{meteorological}} {{station at the}} mountain itself and the closest one {{is located at the}} village of Papingo. The overall climate of the Vikos–Aoös National Park which includes the mountain is Mediterranean, transitioning to continental. The Mediterranean character is characterized by the annual distribution of precipitation, high in the winter months and experiencing a drought period of two to three months in summer. The continental climatic element is attributed to the high amplitude of annual temperature variation, {{to such a degree that}} the difference between mean maximum and mean minimum annual temperature, exceeds [...] Extremely low temperatures occur in the area during the winter months. Compared to Mediterranean <b>bioclimatic</b> divisions, the area belongs to the humid zone with cold winters. It should be noted that conditions in the mountain might be significantly different from those of lower regions in the same area. Winters are particularly harsh and the mountain is covered in snow from autumn until late May.|$|E
