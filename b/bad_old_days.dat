2500|$|In February 2006, Tutu {{repeated}} {{these statements}} after a UN report was published {{which called for}} {{the closure of the}} camp. Tutu stated that the Guantanamo camp was a stain on the character of the United States, while the legislation in Britain which gave a 28-day detention period for terror suspects was [...] "excessive" [...] and [...] "untenable". Tutu claimed that arguments being made in Britain and the United States were similar to those the South African apartheid regime had used. [...] "It is disgraceful and one cannot find strong enough words to condemn what Britain and the United States and some of their allies have accepted," [...] said Tutu. Tutu also spoke against Tony Blair's failed attempt to hold terrorist suspects in Britain for up to 90 days without charge. [...] "Ninety days for a South African is an awful déjà-vu because we had in South Africa in the <b>bad</b> <b>old</b> <b>days</b> a 90-day detention law," [...] he said. Under apartheid, as at Guantanamo, people were held for [...] "unconscionably long periods" [...] and then released, he said.|$|E

6000|$|DEAR FINN,--You must be mad; we can't touch this. I wanted vampires and the <b>bad</b> <b>old</b> <b>days</b> and {{aristocracy}} hand-in-hand with superstition. They {{like that}} But {{you must know}} the Exmoors would never forgive this. And what would our people say then, I should like to know! Why, Sir Simon is one of Exmoor's greatest pals; and it would ruin that cousin of the Eyres that's standing for us at Bradford. Besides, old Soap-Suds was sick enough at not getting his peerage last year; he'd sack me by wire if I lost him it with such lunacy as this. And what about Duffey? He's doing us some rattling articles on [...] "The Heel of the Norman." [...] And how can he write about Normans if the man's only a solicitor? Do be reasonable.--Yours, E. NUTT.|$|E

[...] "In {{the good old}} days--or the <b>bad</b> <b>old</b> <b>days,</b> whichever of the two you prefer to call them--you pays your money and you takes your choice--Kalaua, they say, was the hereditary priest of that grim goddess, Pélé. His house {{was built on the}} highest habitable point of the mountain where Pélé dwells, that he might be close at hand to appease the angry spirit of the great crater whenever she began to pour down lava over the banana-grounds and cocoanut plantations {{at the foot of the}} volcano. Many a fat pig, and many a basketful of prime taro that hard-looking old man has offered up in his time to Pélé--ay, and I dare say many a human victim, too, if we only knew it. But all that's over long ago, thank goodness. He's a Christian now, of course, like all the rest of them; a very respectable old fellow in his way, with a keen eye of his own to business, and a thorough comprehension of the state of the sugar market. He keeps a good house. You've fallen on your feet, I can tell you, for Hawaii, if you've got an invitation to stop for an indefinite time as a guest at Kalaua's." ...|$|E
