5|$|Derived {{from early}} Slavic flag-like objects, a royal <b>banner</b> <b>of</b> arms dates {{as far back}} as the 11th century CE. A symbol of royal authority, it was used at coronations and in battles. In the interwar period, it was {{replaced}} with the <b>Banner</b> <b>of</b> the Republic of Poland, which was part of the presidential insignia. A national banner is not mentioned in the current (2007) regulations on Polish national symbols, although today's presidential jack is based directly on the pre-war design for the <b>Banner</b> <b>of</b> the Republic.|$|E
