[...] A number of judicial decisions gave conflicting interpretations over the characteristics that were definitive of a fixed charge, particularly with reference to charges over book debts (and a fixed charge that did not contain those characteristics would be [...] "recharacterised" [...] as a floating charge). [...] The position was definitively resolved in NatWest v Spectrum Plus Limited when the House of Lords confirmed that a charge over book debts could be a fixed charge, provided that the secured creditor exhibited the necessary degree of control over the proceeds of the book debts.

50|$|In {{relation}} to the substantive issues, the Revenue had already indicated {{that it would not}} seek to reopen recent liquidations which had been distributed in compliance with the understandings of the old law, so in many senses the ruling took prospective effect only with respect to the largest preferred creditor.

50|$|Days after Warsaw's surrender, German {{leaflets}} {{were hung}} {{on the walls of}} buildings, promising Poles the protection of the German state. A section of the leaflets was devoted to Jews, guaranteeing that their rights, property and lives would be secure. Decrees applying to Jews were posted around the city. From 1 December Jews over the age of 10 had to wear a blue Star of David on a white armband; they were given five days to comply. They had to hand real estate and valuables over to German officials. Jewish families were permitted to own just 2,000 złoty; the rest had to be deposited in a bank in a <b>blocked</b> <b>account.</b> Very few people complied. Szpilman's family—he was living with his parents, his brother Henryk, and his sisters Regina and Halina—hid their money in the window frame, an expensive gold watch under a cupboard, and the watch's chain beneath the fingerboard of Szpilman’s father's violin.|$|E

30|$|It can be {{seen from}} Table  4 that the color of the third {{category}} of color blocks is the best with medium-high lightness L* and highest chroma C*, which is characterized by the highest absolute value of a*, and indicated the lowest absolute value of b*, which deviates from green; that is, all parameters point to the most brilliant green, so it is classified as the highest quality level of vivid fancy green: marked as “Fancy Vivid”, represents 135 color <b>blocks,</b> <b>accounting</b> for 9.41 % of total color blocks. The first category of color block quality is slightly lower, even though the lightness is slightly higher than the level before the third class, but the chromaticity of the medium a* and b* that makes its chroma is slightly lower than the third class and obviously biased towards the slight yellow tone, with color appearance shows Yang green, so it is classified as a high-level of intense fancy green, marked as “Fancy Intense,” represents 129 color <b>blocks,</b> <b>accounting</b> for 8.99 % of total color blocks. The color of the sixth category of color block {{is similar to that of}} the former category with similar medium chroma a* and lower b*, it performed weakening yellow tone and reducing chroma which its color appearance shows medium green, so it is classified as deep fancy green, marked as “Fancy Deep”, represents 159 color <b>blocks,</b> <b>accounting</b> for 11.08 % of total color blocks. The lightness of the second category of color blocks continues to decrease. Although the color is similar to the former category 6, the color appearance is dark green, so it is classified as dark fancy green: marked as “Fancy Dark”, represents 126 color <b>blocks,</b> <b>accounting</b> for 15.05 % of total color blocks. The lightness of color of category 5 is medium, and the color is some lower than that of the former category 2. The appearance of color is pale dark green, so it is classified as fancy green: marked as “Fancy”, represents 280 color <b>blocks,</b> <b>accounting</b> for 19.51 % of total color blocks. Although the color of the fourth kind of color has relatively high lightness, its chroma is lower than the previous grade of the fifth kind, and its color appearance is pale green, so it is classified as light fancy green: marked as “Fancy Light”, represents 186 color <b>blocks,</b> <b>accounting</b> for 12.96 % of total color blocks. The lightness and chorma of the seventh color block are the lowest among all the seven colors categories. The color appearance is pale green with obvious gray tone. For the green tone, the color is very light, so it is classified as very light green: marked as “Very Light,” represents 186 color <b>blocks,</b> <b>accounting</b> for 12.96 % of total color blocks. Through cluster analysis, the boundary between the seven categories of 1435 test blocks is clear, the proportion of each class is in accordance with the normal distribution, and the consistency among individual cases in the class is very high.|$|R
50|$|And yet, even if {{operating}} with <b>blocked</b> <b>account,</b> chairman Branko Grgić boosted {{with promises of}} attractive signings and trophies. Although Hajduk did manage to win Cup in 2003 and league titles in 2004 and 2005, as well as sign Dinamo's promising young captain Niko Kranjčar and their legendary manager Miroslav Blažević, when finances and politically driven leadership finally broke down, so did the clubs results. Hajduk spent rest of the decade finishing behind its rival, with numerous coaching and management changes and reorganizations, players of dubious quality and mediocre international performances, worst of which came after being eliminated by Shelbourne and 0-5 home loss to Debrecen. The election of new chairman Mate Peroš in June 2008, upon which he changed the entire professional staff and reorganized the administration, brought only temporary relief. Hajduk achieved first away win against Dinamo after five-and-a-half years (2-0), but again finished behind their arch-rivals, and reached Croatian Cup finals only to lose to Dinamo once again in a two-game thriller which saw two 3-0 wins by both teams, before Dinamo won 4-3 in penalty shootout. More importantly, the club's finances did not radically change until next season, when Hajduk became joint stock company owned by the City of Split. Even if financially secure, newly appointed chairman Joško Svaguša continued the policy of expensive signings and unsustainable expenses to regain the club's former glory. In 2010, Hajduk won the Croatian Cup, its first trophy in five years, and later managed {{to qualify for the}} group stage of 2010-11 UEFA Europa League which was the first time since 1994 club secured a place in the group stages of UEFA competitions. Home wins against Dinamo București (3-0), Unirea Urziceni (4-1) and Anderlecht (1-0) were, however, just a temporary reminiscence of former successes.|$|E
