5|$|In captivity studies, it {{has been}} {{discovered}} {{that most of the}} hybrids do not follow Haldane's Rule, but sometimes hybrid females die <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>reach</b> sexual maturity, thereby supporting the case for the American black duck being a distinct species.|$|E
5|$|The larvae {{of several}} species of starfish can {{reproduce}} asexually <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>reach</b> maturity. They do this by autotomising some parts of their bodies or by budding. When such a larva senses that food is plentiful, it takes the path of asexual reproduction rather than normal development. Though this costs it time and energy and delays maturity, it allows a single larva to give rise to multiple adults when the conditions are appropriate.|$|E
5|$|The {{primary cause}} of {{vibrations}} in a properly functioning bicycle is the surface over which it rolls. In addition to pneumatic tires and traditional bicycle suspensions, {{a variety of techniques}} have been developed to damp vibrations <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>reach</b> the rider. These include materials, such as carbon fiber, either in the whole frame or just key components such as the front fork, seatpost, or handlebars; tube shapes, such as curved seat stays; and special inserts, such as Zertz by Specialized, and Buzzkills by Bontrager.|$|E

5|$|Six {{returns to}} the surface and travels to the city of New Alexandria. The Spartan aids the local {{military}} in fighting the Covenant and evacuating the city, reuniting with Noble Team along the way. They retreat to an underground bunker when the Covenant begin to bombard the city with plasma, but Kat is killed by a Covenant sniper <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>reach</b> it. Recalled to Sword Base, Noble Team is guided underground to an ancient artifact that Halsey believes is key to winning the war against the Covenant. Six, Carter and Emile are entrusted with transporting the artificial intelligence Cortana, and the information she carries concerning the artifact, to the UNSC ship Pillar of Autumn. Jun leaves the team to escort Halsey to another base.|$|E
5|$|Another {{study in}} July 2017 by Miriam Hirt et al., {{published}} in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution found that the top speed of Tyrannosaurus was around 17mph (27km/h). Other dinosaurs including Triceratops, Velociraptor and Brachiosaurus were also analyzed in the study, as were many living animals like elephants, cheetahs and rabbits. The speed of Tyrannosaurus was calculated by factoring its weight in conjunction with the medium upon which it travelled (in the case of the theropod, land) and by the assumptions that: one; animals reach their maximum speeds during comparatively short sprints, and two; Newton's laws of motion dictate that mass has to overcome inertia. It found that large animals like Tyrannosaurus exhaust their energy reserves long <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>reach</b> their theoretical top speed, resulting in a parabola-like relationship between size and speed. The equation can calculate the top speed of an animal with almost 90% accuracy and can be applied to both living and extinct animals.|$|E
5|$|Adopted {{from the}} Grand Theft Auto series, Red Dead Redemption has a {{modified}} wanted system. When the player commits a crime such as killing people near witnesses, some will {{run to the}} nearest police station. The player can bribe them or kill them <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>reach</b> the station. If a crime is committed near a police officer, the wanted meter immediately appears along with a bounty count which increases with each crime committed. If Marston's bounty becomes high enough he will be pursued by either the U.S. Marshals or by the Mexican Army depending on his locations. To evade law enforcement in pursuit, John Marston must escape a circular zone until the wanted meter disappears. Alternatively, the player character can kill all lawmen in a town to have the wanted meter disappear. Despite the chase being aborted, a bounty is placed upon John which will cause bounty hunters to come after him in the wilderness. It is impossible to surrender to these bounty hunters by putting away Marston's weapon and standing still as they will kill him regardless. Only law enforcement in towns and a posse will accept surrenders. The law will continue to chase Marston unless he pays his bounty at a telegraph station or presents a pardon letter. When arrested, Marston pays off his bounty and is then released. If the player {{does not have enough}} money to pay back the bounty, the law will assign bounty hunting activities.|$|E

5|$|As they {{sail for}} Greenland, strange things begin {{to happen to}} the ships bearing the {{tourmaline}} veils. Marine life and sea birds of all kinds are attracted towards them, and crew stationed aboard them for too long begin acting intoxicated and amorous. The plant and animal life attracted to the ships experiences rapid growth, so that <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>reach</b> Greenland the ships look more like mountains or meadows than ships. Strange sea creatures never before seen appear around the ships, and when the expedition is ready to deploy the tourmaline veils, they have to cut through the riot of organic growth that has totally filled the ships. Once the energy of the veils is unleashed on Greenland, it melts the ice quickly but also has unanticipated effects. Prehistoric bones and plant remains that were buried under the ice are reanimated, and fuse together into monstrous forms made up of plant, animal, and mineral parts. Greenland, free of its icy burden, rises up, ripping from north to south in the process and becoming two separate islands. As the chapter ends, the now enormous monsters brought to life by the volcanic energy are spilling away from Greenland towards Europe.|$|E
5|$|Scully is told by {{the scarred}} man that William is part alien and that she {{is being used to}} raise the child. Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) and Doggett tell Scully that the man's DNA is a match to Mulder's, but Scully refuses to believe it. While the three are talking, the scarred man quietly slips into William's room with a syringe. Though William's crying alerts the agents, the scarred man manages to sneak out of the room <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>reach</b> William. Reyes and Scully take the baby to the {{hospital}} and Doggett discovers the man's syringe. The doctor reports that William is fine except for an elevated amount of iron in his blood. In interrogation, Scully confronts the scarred man about his motives. It is revealed that he is actually Jeffrey Spender, a former FBI agent supposedly killed by The Smoking Man (William B. Davis) three years earlier. Spender is also Mulder's half-brother. Spender admits his actions were a ruse and that the syringe contained magnetite meant to make William normal. He explains that the aliens need the child in order to successfully invade the world, but now they have lost him. However, he notes that the conspirators will always pursue the child, despite what he has done. Spender says that he acted out of his hatred for his father, since the new conspiracy was created by The Smoking Man after the alien rebels burned the original group.|$|E

25|$|High-resolution banding {{involves}} the staining of chromosomes during prophase or early metaphase (prometaphase), <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>reach</b> maximal condensation. Because prophase and prometaphase chromosomes are more extended than metaphase chromosomes, {{the number of}} bands observable for all chromosomes increases from about 300 to 450 {{to as many as}} 800. This allows the detection of less obvious abnormalities usually not seen with conventional banding.|$|E
25|$|Riparian forest buffers are diverse {{communities}} of trees, shrubs and native perennial grasses. They {{are great for}} providing habitat for wildlife on land and in the water.
