2500|$|In addition, {{there are}} three chip select signals (C0, C1, C2), {{allowing}} up to eight stacked chips to be placed inside a single DRAM package. [...] These effectively act as three more <b>bank</b> <b>select</b> bits, bringing the total to seven (128 possible banks).|$|E
2500|$|Also, {{the number}} of bank {{addresses}} has been increased greatly. [...] There are four <b>bank</b> <b>select</b> bits to select up to 16 banks within each DRAM: two bank address bits (BA0, BA1), and two bank group bits (BG0, BG1). [...] There are additional timing restrictions when accessing banks within the same bank group; it is faster to access a bank in a different bank group.|$|E

5000|$|A superset of the General MIDI {{standard}} which added several proprietary extensions. The {{most notable}} addition was {{the ability to}} address multiple banks of programs (instrument sounds) by using an additional pair of <b>Bank</b> <b>Select</b> controllers to specify up to 16384 [...] "variation" [...] sounds (cc#0 is <b>Bank</b> <b>Select</b> MSB, and cc#32 is <b>Bank</b> <b>Select</b> LSB). Other most notable features were 9 Drum kits with 14 additional drum sounds each, simultaneous Percussion Kits - up to 2 (Channels 10/11), Control Change messages for controlling the send level of sound effect blocks (cc#91-94), entering additional parameters (cc#98-101), portamento, sostenuto, soft pedal (cc#65-67), and model-specific SysEx messages for setting various parameters of the synth engine.|$|E

E-Banking is now widely practiced in Bangladesh. There are various types of e-banking services like SMS banking, Tele Banking, Push and Pull services, ATM, Fast Track etc. that have been introduced by the commercial banks in Bangladesh. This study attempts to explore various forms and characteristics of e-banking and finds out the merits and demerits of e-banking in <b>selected</b> commercial <b>banks</b> of our country. The major findings of the study show that all the commercial <b>banks</b> <b>selected</b> for the study have been practicing e-banking successfully and Dutch-Bangla Bank Ltd. is providing electronic banking services more effectively than other commercial <b>banks</b> <b>selected</b> in this study.

Typically, cc#32 (<b>Bank</b> <b>Select</b> LSB) was used to select a family (i.e. 1 - SC-55, 100 - MT-32 etc.) then cc#0 (<b>Bank</b> <b>Select</b> MSB) was used to set a particular variation bank.|$|E
