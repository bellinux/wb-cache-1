Bernard obtained £7000 in funding and opened the Providence Woollen Mill in Foxford in 1892 using power from the River Moy.Bernard's management and results attracted further funding and the Mill undertook training of their own workers and in time training in other skills pertinent to the local activities. Bernard's organisation instilled new methods of <b>breeding</b> <b>poultry,</b> farming and gardening. In 1897 she created the Brass and Reed Band which was still running in 2014.Bernard tried to avoid politics but she did get involved when Charles Stewart Parnell fell from power and there was disagreements between her workers and the parish priest. She also got involved when some of her workers were victimised by the Black and Tans in 1921. Bernard {{was able to get}} the soldiers disciplined.Bernard supported the revival of Gaelic culture and language as she had arranged earlier the building of cottages for workers. She herself organised cart roads to give access to 118 houses.In 1898 Mother Mary Arsenius undertook the task of building roads in the area; through her scheme cart roads were built to the doors of 118 houses. In addition, she encouraged the local authorities to build labourers' cottages. She was also interested in the social and cultural life of the area, and supported the efforts of the Gaelic League to revive Irish language and culture..She died at her convent 20 April 1932 and was buried there three days later.|$|E

40|$|The EU-wide {{salmonella}} {{control programme}} provides for all Member States to submit an annual {{report on the}} percentage of salmonella-positive flocks of <b>breeding</b> <b>poultry</b> (Gallus gal-lus), laying hens and broilers. To meet this requirement, all Länder (German federal states) submit their data to the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) which then evaluates the data. The data reported for 2009 show that the established Community targets for <b>breeding</b> <b>poultry</b> (1 %) and broilers (1 %) were either maintained or reached. In official sampling, salmonella serovars targeted in the control programmes were found in 0. 8 % of <b>breeding</b> <b>poultry</b> and in 0. 4 % of broilers. In laying hens, the detection rate for salmonella serovars targeted in the control programmes was 4. 8 %, which was {{higher than in the}} previous year. Changes in detection rates are also possibly the result of improved reporting. This supports the relevance of harmonised reporting for the consistent implementation and assessment of control programmes. If only the results from official testing are taken into account, the detection rate of the five salmonella serovars targeted in the control programmes in <b>breeding</b> <b>poultry</b> were below the Community target established for salmonella control and thus complied with the target, as they have in previous years. If, however, test results reported by food business operators are also taken into account the result appears differently. Under these circumstances, the sal-monella findings in laying hens clearly exceeded the Community target.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the investigation was to characterize infectious bursal disease viruses (IBDV) circulating in commercial and <b>breeding</b> <b>poultry</b> farms in Ethiopia between 2009 and 2011. The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence for VP 2 hypervariable region of ten IBDVs were determined by RT-PCR, sequenced and compared to well characterised IBDV isolates worldwide. IBDV genetic material was amplified directly from bursa or cell passaged material. Phylogenetically, Ethiopian IBDVs represented two genetic lineages: very virulent (vv) IBDVs or variants of the classical attenuated vaccine strain (D 78). The nucleotide identity between Ethiopian vvIBDVs ranged between 0 % to 2. 6 %. Ethiopian vvIBDVs are clustered phylogenetically with the African IBDV genetic lineage, independent of the Asian/European lineage.

40|$|A {{total of}} 134 cases of H 7 N 9 {{influenza}} infection {{were identified in}} 12 provinces of China between March 25 and September 31, 2013. Of these, 46 cases occurred in Zhejiang Province. We carried out a preliminary comparison of characteristics between rural and urban H 7 N 9 cases from Zhejiang Province, China. Field investigations were conducted for each confirmed H 7 N 9 case. A standardized questionnaire was used to collect information about demographics, exposure history, clinical signs and symptoms, timelines of medical visits and care after onset of illness. Of the 46 H 7 N 9 cases in Zhejiang Province identified between March 25 and September 31, 2013, there were 16 rural cases and 30 urban cases. Compared to urban cases, there was {{a higher proportion of}} females among the rural cases [11 / 16 (69 %) vs. 6 / 30 (20 %), P = 0. 001]. Among the rural cases, 14 / 15 (93 %) with available data had a history of recent poultry exposure, which was significantly higher than that among urban cases (64 %, P = 0. 038). More patients from the rural group had a history of <b>breeding</b> <b>poultry</b> compared with those from the urban group [38 % (6 / 16) vs. 10 % (3 / 30), respectively; P = 0. 025].
