The <b>brake</b> input of the rider is measured by pressure sensors and the information is provided to an ECU. Together with the information of the wheel speed sensors the ECU calculates the optimal distribution of pressure to prevent lockups and to provide best possible deceleration.

One of the many potential benefits of a <b>brake</b> by <b>wire</b> system is the increased brake dynamic performances due to a more accurate and continuous operation of the EMB actuators {{which leads to the}} increased amount of possibilities for control in antilock brake system. The main focus of this thesis is on the application of a model predictive control (MPC) method to devise an antilock brake control system for a <b>brake</b> by <b>wire</b> vehicle. Unlike the traditional ABS control algorithms which are based on a trial and error method, the MPC based ABS algorithm aims to utilizes the behaviour of the model to optimize the wheel slip dynamics su bject to system constraints. The final implementation of the wheel slip controller embraces decentralized control architecture to independently control the brake torque at each four wheel. Performance of the wheel slip controller is validated through Software-in-the-Loop and Hardware-in-the-Loop simulation. In order to support the high demands of the computational power and the real time constraints of the Hardware-in-the-Loop simulation, a novel multi processor real-time simulation system is developed using the reflective memory network and the off-the-shelf hardware components...|$|R

30|$|Chromium is {{available}} in the Earth’s crust layer with a concentration of 100  mg/kg. The only ore of chromium is chromite (FeO·Cr 2 O 4) of commercial importance. Out of six oxidation conditions of Cr the trivalent (III) and hexavalent (VI) structures are thought to be of biological significance. In aquatic environment, Cr+ 6 will be present in soluble form and eventually converted to Cr+ 3, by reduction with hydrogen sulfide, iron sulfide, ammonium, and nitrate. Cr+ 6 and Cr+ 3 have been found accumulated in many aquatic species, especially in fishes such as Cyprinus carpio, Oreochromis niloticus, Aorichthys aor, Labeo calbasu, Cirrhinus mrigala, and Clarias batrachus. The hexavalent shape exists as a segment of an unpredictable anion that shifts with pH and may be changed over as chromate (CrO 4 2 −), hydrochromate (HCrO 4 −), or dichromate (Cr 2 O 7 2 −). Cr 6 + frame is highly dissolvable in water and consequently portable in the aquatic condition. Precipitated Cr+ 3 hydroxides are persisting in the sediments under aerobic conditions; under low pH and anoxic conditions, while Cr+ 3 hydroxides may be solubilized and remain as ionic Cr+ 3 unless oxidizes to Cr+ 6 through mixing and aeration (Ecological Analysts Inc. 1981). Acute toxicity of Cr to invertebrates is highly diversified depending upon the species (Moore and Ramamoorthy 1984). It was seen by the specialists of Indian Institute of Sciences, Bangalore (IISc 2001) that the harmful impact of Cr on plants demonstrates that the roots remain smaller, and the leaves seem to be reduced and display reddish brown staining with little necrotic blotches. The sources of emission of Cr in the surface waters are from municipal effluents, laundry chemicals, paints, leather, road runoff due to tire wear, corrosion of bushings, <b>brake</b> <b>wires,</b> radiators, etc. The abnormal state of Cr in wastewater effluent shows contamination from textile and tanneries (Pachpande and Ingle 2004) and when these effluents enter into the river, contaminate both the water and sediment of the river.|$|R
