50|$|<b>Bioabsorbable</b> scaffolds, or {{naturally}} dissolving stents, {{that have}} been investigated include base materials that are either metals or polymers.

50|$|Bioresorbable (also called {{biodegradable}} or <b>bioabsorbable)</b> metals are metals {{or their}} alloys that degrade safely within the body.

50|$|Magnesium is a {{relatively}} new biomaterial that has recently been gaining traction. While degrading harmlessly, it has been shown to possess a functional degradation time of about 30 days in vivo. This is much short of the three-to-six month window desired for <b>bioabsorbable</b> stents. Thus, much attention has been given to drastically reducing the rate of magnesium corrosion by alloying, coating, etc. Many novel methods have surfaced to minimize the penetration rate and hydrogen evolution rate (or, in layman's terms, the corrosion rate). One of the most successful has involved the creation of <b>bioabsorbable</b> metallic glasses via rapid solidification. Other, alternative solutions have included the development of magnesium-rare-earth (Mg-RE) alloys, which benefit from the low cytotoxicity of RE elements. Coatings and sophisticated materials processing routes are currently being developed to further decrease the corrosion rate. However a number of issues remain limiting the further development of Mg biomaterials in general.|$|E
50|$|Although most {{surgical}} staples {{are made}} of titanium, stainless steel is more often used in some skin staples and clips. Titanium produces less reaction with the immune system and, being non-ferrous, does not interfere significantly with MRI scanners, although some imaging artifacts may result. Synthetic absorbable (<b>bioabsorbable)</b> staples are also now becoming available, based on polyglycolic acid, as with many synthetic absorbable sutures.|$|E
50|$|To {{overcome}} some {{of these}} potential drawbacks, several companies are pursuing the development of bioresorbable or <b>bioabsorbable</b> stents. Like metal stents, placement of a bioresorbable stent will restore blood flow and support the vessel through the healing process. However, {{in the case of}} a bioresorbable stent, the stent will gradually resorb and be benignly cleared from the body, leaving no permanent implant.|$|E

50|$|Sensory loss, {{scarring}} and neuroma formation {{can cause}} morbidity to the donor {{site of the}} patient the nerve is harvested from. Therefore, alloplastic nerve graft research is being conducted for nerve repair. Silicone has been used previously, but long-term use of tubes produces compression and decreased conduction, requiring surgery to remove the tube. Conduits made from polyglycolic acid, a <b>bioabsorbable</b> substance used for dissolvable sutures, reduce {{the problems associated with}} silicone and eliminate problems associated with nerve grafts taken from donors. In a study on nerve repair comparing nerve grafts and polyglycolic acid conduits, there was no statistical differences, but 2-point discrimination showed that the conduit group was better at eliminating donor-site morbidity {{as a result of the}} graft.|$|E
50|$|In April 1995, while reposing in a {{favorite}} armchair and napping, she was startled awake, which caused a strange medical anomaly that mimicked lockjaw but was not, as Craig was eventually able to pry her mouth open. Though {{there seemed to}} be no imminent threat, Craig's condition gradually worsened making it difficult for her to speak and eat. Her dentist diagnosed temporomandibular joint syndrome, for which she was referred to a specialist, though to little avail. She was in turn referred to a series of physicians (reportedly 18) all of whom provided various suggestions but ultimately no solution. In the spring of 1998, she was introduced to Dr. Dennis M. Nigro, typically a cosmetic surgeon, who assessed that Craig had suffered atrophying of her mouth muscles. Corrective surgery was provided by installing <b>bioabsorbable</b> screws into her cheeks. She underwent a four-and-a-half-hour operation and another year of speech therapy. Craig has since fully recovered from the debilitating condition.|$|E
50|$|The next {{aspect of}} the surgery is {{preparation}} and placement of the reconstruction grafts. The preparation can be done while the other steps are being completed by another surgeon or physician’s assistant. The semitendinosus tendon can be harvested using a hamstring stripper for use as the reconstruction autograft. The autograft is sectioned into a 16-cm length for the sMCL reconstruction and 12-cm length for the POL reconstruction. These lengths are also used if the surgery is done with cadaver allograft. The sMCL and POL grafts are pulled into their respective femoral tunnels and each secured with a cannulated <b>bioabsorbable</b> screw. The grafts are passed distally along their native courses to the tibial attachments. The sMCL is passed under sartorius fascia (and any remaining sMCL fibers). Both grafts are passed (but not yet secured) into their respective tibial tunnels using the existing eyelet pins. If simultaneous cruciate ligament surgery is underway, the cruciate reconstructions are secured before securing the medial ligaments.|$|E
30|$|The use of <b>bioabsorbable</b> devices has {{resolved}} {{several problems}} of titanium fixation, {{such as the}} need for a second operation and interference with radiological evaluation. From the literature review, the author concluded that <b>bioabsorbable</b> osteosynthesis systems are reliable for fragment fixation in orthognathic procedures with major maxillomandibular segmental movements. The use of <b>bioabsorbable</b> devices leads to predictable postoperative long-term skeletal stability, which appears to be similar to that provided by titanium devices. In the future, we need less expensive <b>bioabsorbable</b> devices that degrade rapidly in the body.|$|E
30|$|Orthognathic surgery {{requires}} stable fixation for uneventful {{healing of}} osteotomized bony segments and optimal remodeling. Titanium plates and screws {{have been accepted}} as {{the gold standard for}} rigid fixation in orthognathic surgery. Although titanium osteofixation is the most widely used approach, the use of <b>bioabsorbable</b> devices has been increasing recently. Biodegradation of <b>bioabsorbable</b> devices eliminates the need for a second operation to remove metal plates and screws. However, long-term stability and relapse frequency in <b>bioabsorbable</b> osteofixation are still insufficiently studied, especially in cases of segmental movements of great magnitude or segmental movements to a position where bony resistance exists. This paper reviews the background, techniques, and complications of <b>bioabsorbable</b> osteofixation and compares <b>bioabsorbable</b> and titanium osteofixation in orthognathic surgery in terms of skeletal stability.|$|E
40|$|Developments in {{metallic}} coronary stents are toward permanent devices with thinner struts and <b>bioabsorbable</b> devices. To {{facilitate the}} development of these promising technologies an improved understanding of thin-strut and <b>bioabsorbable</b> stent mechanical performance is important. The work presented in this thesis uses computational mechanics to investigate the mechanical performance of corroding <b>bioabsorbable</b> metal stents and computational micromechanics to investigate the performance of thin metallic struts undergoing large plastic deformation. The short-term mechanical performance of stents consisting of a range of <b>bioabsorbable</b> and permanent metals is first investigated using typical stent modelling approaches. It is found that devices consisting of <b>bioabsorbable</b> metals can match the short-term scaffolding performance of permanent stents, however the former has a greater risk of fracture. The mechanical performance of permanent and <b>bioabsorbable</b> stent struts undergoing large deformations is then investigated in more detail, using micromechanical analyses based on crystal plasticity theory. Lower limits on suitable strut thicknesses for <b>bioabsorbable</b> and permanent stents are identified, based on predictions of microstructure-dependent ductility size effects. A corrosion model is developed for <b>bioabsorbable</b> metal stents and is calibrated and validated based on immersion experiments on thin <b>bioabsorbable</b> alloy foils. The model is used to predict the scaffolding performance of stents undergoing corrosion in the body. It is found that the form of corrosion undergone by the device in the body has a strong influence on scaffolding performance. In particular, it is predicted that experimentally observed localized corrosion leads to a significant decrease in scaffolding duration relative to an ideal uniform corrosion behaviour, pointing to recommendations for future alloy development for such applications...|$|E

The {{purpose of this}} study was to compare interbody fusion of an autologous tricortical iliac crest bone graft with that of a <b>bioabsorbable</b> cage using a sheep cervical spine interbody fusion model. This study was designed to determine differences in (1) the ability to preserve postoperative distraction, (2) biomechanical stability, and (3) histological characteristics of intervertebral bone matrix formation. Sixteen full-grown Merino sheep underwent C 3 / 4 discectomy and fusion. After 12 weeks, there was no significant difference between the results with the <b>bioabsorbable</b> PLDLLA cages and tricortical bone grafts.

A technical advance fulfilling these aims would hold tremendous potential to reduce morbidity, mortality and economic costs associated with the percutaneous treatment of coronary artery disease. An attractive approach is the use of <b>bioabsorbable</b> stent designs. These may include stents with different <b>bioabsorbable</b> drugs, <b>bioabsorbable</b> polymers or even <b>bioabsorbable</b> metallic backbones.

Objective: To report the experimental findings with the Inspiron ™ stent – a <b>bioabsorbable</b> polymer-coated stent with sirolimus release from the abluminal surface only, recently approved for clinical use. Methods: 45 stents were implanted in the coronary arteries of 15 pigs. On day 28 after implantation, angiographic, intracoronary ultrasonographic and histomorphological data were collected. Five groups were analyzed: Group I (nine bare-metal stents); Group II (nine coated with <b>bioabsorbable</b> polymer on the luminal and abluminal surfaces); Group III (eight stents coated with <b>bioabsorbable</b> polymer on the abluminal surface); Group IV (nine stents with <b>bioabsorbable</b> polymer and sirolimus on the luminal and abluminal surfaces); and Group V (ten stents with <b>bioabsorbable</b> polymer and sirolimus only on the abluminal surface).

40|$|Transcatheter {{treatment}} {{of children with}} congenital heart disease such as {{coarctation of the aorta}} and pulmonary artery stenosis currently involves the use of metal stents. While these provide good short term results, there are long term complications with their use. Children outgrow metal stents, obligating them to future transcatheter dilations and eventual surgical removal. A <b>bioabsorbable</b> stent, or a stent that goes away with time, would solve this problem. <b>Bioabsorbable</b> stents are being developed for use in coronary arteries, however these are too small for use in pediatric congenital heart disease. A <b>bioabsorbable</b> stent for use in pediatric congenital heart disease needs to be low profile, expandable to a diameter 8 [*]mm, provide sufficient radial strength, and absorb quickly enough to allow vessel growth. Development of absorbable coronary stents has led to a great understanding of the available production techniques and materials such as <b>bioabsorbable</b> polymers and biocorrodable metals. Children with congenital heart disease will hopefully soon benefit from the current generation of <b>bioabsorbable</b> and biocorrodable materials and devices...|$|E
40|$|Ankle {{fractures}} with syndesmotic rupture require operative treatment. In most cases, this {{consists of}} fixation of the tibiofibular joint with 1 or more screws. <b>Bioabsorbable</b> screws are used for the same purpose but have the advantage that screw removal is unnecessary. The aim {{of the present study}} was to compare the results of <b>bioabsorbable</b> and metallic syndesmotic screws. A systematic search was performed in the Ovid MEDLINE electronic database and Google Scholar. Three randomized controlled trials and one comparison study, with 260 patients, were included. The experimental group consisted of patients with syndesmotic injuries treated with <b>bioabsorbable</b> screws versus the control group (patients treated with metallic screws). The primary outcomes were complications and wound infections. No statistically significant difference was demonstrable in the overall number of complications between the 2 groups. In the group of patients with a <b>bioabsorbable</b> screw, 32 of 137 (23. 4 %) experienced a complication versus 7 of 123 patients (5. 7 %) with a metallic screw. Data on wound-related complications showed no statistically significant difference, 19. 7 % versus 5. 7 %. The average maximum range of motion in both groups was comparable. <b>Bioabsorbable</b> syndesmotic screws and metallic syndesmotic screws were comparable with respect to the incidence of complications and range of motion.

40|$|Study Design. In vitro biomechanical {{study of}} <b>bioabsorbable</b> {{cervical}} spine interbody fusion cages using a sheep model. Objectives: The {{purpose of this}} study was to evaluate the segmental stability provided by 2 new developed <b>bioabsorbable</b> cervical spine interbody fusion cages and to compare it with a tricortical iliac crest bone graft and a titanium meshed interbody fusion cage. Further, the biomechanical effect of an additional anterior plate instrumentation was determined. Summary and Background Data. Despite the initial favorable results, the long-term effects of metallic cage devices on spinal motion segments are still unknown. Furthermore, shortcomings of metallic cages like migration, adjacent level degeneration, stenotic myelopathy, and artifacts in postoperative radiologic assessment have already been reported. <b>Bioabsorbable</b> cages have been designed to avoid these complications. Currently, no information is available about the biomechanical properties of <b>bioabsorbable</b> cervical spine interbody fusion cages. Methods. Forty sheep cervical spines (C 2 -C 5) were tested in flexion, extension, axial rotation, and lateral bending with a nondestructive stiffness method using a nonconstrained testing apparatus. First, the motion segment C 3 -C 4 was tested intact. After complete discectomy, the following groups were evaluated: autologous iliac crest bone graft, titanium mesh cylinder (Harms, DePuy AcroMed), <b>bioabsorbable</b> PDLLA-cage (experimental), and <b>bioabsorbable</b> Resorbon cage (Biomet Merck). Further, all implants were tested with an additional anterior plate instrumentation. The mean apparent stiffness, range of motion, neutral zone, and elastic zone were calculated from the corresponding load-displacement curves. Results. No significant difference in range of motion and segmental stiffness among the tricortical iliac crest bone graft, meshed titanium Harms cage, and PDLLA-cage could be determined. The Resorbon cage significantly (P < 0. 05) decreased range of motion and increased stiffness in rotation and flexion in comparison to all tested implants and the intact motion segment. An additional anterior plate significantly (P < 0. 05) decreased range of motion and increased stiffness in flexion and extension. Conclusion. In this study, <b>bioabsorbable</b> cages demonstrated biomechanical in vitro properties equal or superior to metallic cages. From the biomechanical point of view, <b>bioabsorbable</b> cages, especially the Resorbon cage, may be a viable alternative to current metallic interbody cage devices.
