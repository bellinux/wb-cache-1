Later in 2001, he became Senate Minority Leader again after Vermont senator Jim Jeffords became an independent and caucused with the Democrats, allowing them to regain the majority.

500|$|George W. <b>Bush</b> <b>took</b> <b>office</b> in January 2001, {{and changed}} the American policy towards {{countries}} in financial crises. The Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill, a critic of financial aids, said, [...] "We're working {{to find a way}} to create a sustainable Argentina, not just one that continues to consume the money of the plumbers and carpenters in the United States who make $50,000 a year and wonder what in the world we're doing with their money". The September 11 attacks occurred a few months later, and the U.S. focused its foreign policy on the War on Terror against countries suspected of harboring terrorist organizations. As a result, the U.S. gave no further financial aid to Argentina. This policy was confirmed after an interview of Bush with the Brazilian president, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who confirmed Brazil would not be affected by the Argentine crisis.|$|E
2500|$|Under the Bush Administration, {{fighting}} sex slavery {{worldwide and}} domestically became a priority {{with an average}} of $100 million spent per year, which substantially outnumbers the amount spent by other countries. Before President <b>Bush</b> <b>took</b> <b>office,</b> Congress passed the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 (TVPA). The TVPA strengthened services to victims of violence, law enforcements ability to reduce violence against women and children, and education against human trafficking. Also specified in the TVPA was a mandate to collect funds for the treatment of sex trafficking victims that provided them with shelter, food, education, and financial grants. Internationally, the TVPA set standards that governments of other countries must follow in order to receive aid from the U.S. to fight human trafficking. Once George W. <b>Bush</b> <b>took</b> <b>office</b> in 2001, restricting sex trafficking became one of his primary humanitarian efforts. The Attorney General under President Bush, John Ashcroft, strongly enforced the TVPA. [...] The Act was subsequently renewed in 2004, 2006, and 2008. It established two stipulations an applicant has to meet in order to receive the benefits of a T-Visa. First, a trafficked victim must prove/admit to being trafficked and second must submit to prosecution of his or her trafficker. [...] In 2011, Congress failed to re-authorize the Act. [...] The State Department publishes an annual Trafficking in Persons Report, which examines the progress that the U.S. and other countries have made in destroying human trafficking businesses, arresting the kingpins, and rescuing the victims. In September 2017, two anti-trafficking bills were proposed during a session of congress: the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act (S. 1693) and the Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act (H.R. 1865). Although US Senators Rob Portman, Richard Blumenthal and Claire McCaskill authored SESTA specifically to strengthen existing laws combatting sex trafficking, the bill was mainly met with negative responses online, with many expressing concerns that they would endanger online free speech and social media by gutting Section 230, a law that enables platforms relied on by many users on the internet.|$|E
2500|$|Security {{guarantee}} - {{this issue}} has been raised by North Korea since the <b>Bush</b> administration (2001–2009) <b>took</b> <b>office.</b> North Korea labeled the Bush administration as hostile and accused it of planning to overthrow the North Korean government by force.

2500|$|Executive Order 13233, {{drafted by}} Gonzales and issued by President George W. Bush on November 1, 2001, {{shortly after the}} September 11, 2001 attacks, {{attempted}} to place limitations on the Freedom of Information Act by restricting access to the records of former presidents. The order asserted the President's power to delay the release of presidential records longer than the congressionally mandated period of 12 years after the president leaves office. Executive Order 13233 revoked President Ronald Reagan's Executive Order 12667 on the same subject and {{had the effect of}} delaying the release of Reagan's papers, which were due to be made public when <b>Bush</b> <b>took</b> <b>office</b> in 2001. While the policy was being drawn up, Gonzales as Counsel to the President issued a series of orders to the U.S. Archivist to delay the release of Reagan's records. This order {{was the subject of a}} number of lawsuits and Congressional attempts to overturn it. In 2007, a D.C. district court ordered the Archivist not to obey this order, finding it to be [...] "arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act." [...] On January 21, 2009 (his first day in office), President Barack Obama revoked Executive Order 13233 by issuing , with wording largely matching Reagan's Executive Order 12667.|$|E

Following his defeat, he was succeeded by Democrat Bill Clinton, who won the 1992 presidential election.|$|R
5000|$|The {{proposed}} remedy (dividing Microsoft {{into two}} companies) was never applied. The judge who decided the original case {{was removed from}} the decision concerning the penalty due to public statements, and replaced by a judge more sympathetic to Microsoft. While new penalties were under consideration, the Clinton administration ended and the <b>Bush</b> administration <b>took</b> <b>office.</b> The new administration announced that in the interest of ending the case as quickly as possible, it would no longer seek to break the company up, and that it would stop investigating claims of illegal tying of products. Eighteen days later, Judge Kollar-Kotelly ordered the justice department and Microsoft to [...] "engage in discussions seven days a week, 24 hours a day." [...] The judge cited the events of September 11, 2001, in her direction to begin settlement talks but did not explain the linkage between the two. Attorney General Ashcroft, however, denied that the events of September 11 had any effect on the outcome. Microsoft subsequently reached a settlement with the Department of Justice and some of the states which brought suit against it.

In seeking an answer this question, we utilize Kingdon’s (1995) agenda setting framework. Using documentary evidence found in presidential archives, we find an Administration wrestling with divergent views and approaches as it sought to manage and manipulate the agenda setting process in both instances. Policy solutions to the problem of air pollution could be designed in a manner congruent with Administration preferences. However, the issue of global climate change was too large, complex, and ambiguous given the policy atmosphere of the Bush years, and too new, to be addressed in the ordinary flow of Washington’s political work...|$|R
40|$|This article {{appeared}} in Strategic Insights (May 2003), v. 2 no. 5 North Korea's surprise admission last October {{to a secret}} nuclear weapons program based on uranium enrichment triggered a cascading breakdown of the 1994 Agreed Framework structure that had kept North Korea's more advanced plutonium-based nuclear program in check. By year's end North Korea had expelled United Nations inspectors and removed monitoring equipment at its Yongbyon nuclear complex, announced its withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, and begun preparations to restart its plutonium reprocessing facility. This twin proliferation danger surpasses even {{the apex of the}} 1993 - 4 North Korean crisis that nearly triggered a U. S. military attack. The Bush administration's de facto policy of hostile neglect toward North Korea has contributed to this crisis. Although North Korea's uranium-based program began well before the <b>Bush</b> team <b>took</b> <b>office,</b> the administration bears some responsibility for inciting acceleration of this program and for fostering the fragile conditions under which the program's revelation quickly precipitated a complete breakdown of U. S. -North Korea relations. Unfortunately, even as administration supporters have acknowledged the need for a new approach, there remains insufficient appreciation that the deficiency of the current administration's posture has been as much neglect as hostility...|$|R
