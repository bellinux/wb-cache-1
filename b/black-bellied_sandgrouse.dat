5|$|Sandgrouse is {{the common}} name for Pteroclididae, a family of sixteen species of bird, members of the order Pteroclidiformes. They are {{traditionally}} placed in two genera. The two central Asian species are classified as Syrrhaptes and the other fourteen species, from Africa and Asia, are placed in the genus Pterocles. They are ground dwelling birds restricted to treeless, open country, such as plains, savannahs and semi-deserts. They are distributed across northern, southern and eastern Africa, Madagascar, the Middle East and India through to central Asia. The ranges of the <b>black-bellied</b> <b>sandgrouse</b> and the pin-tailed sandgrouse extend into the Iberian Peninsula and France, and Pallas's sandgrouse occasionally breaks out in large numbers from its normal range in Asia.|$|E

The region is also host to numerous gamebirds, including the red-legged partridge (Alectoris rufa).|$|R
40|$|MSc., Faculty of Science, University of the Witwatersrand, 2011 A {{selection}} of southern African bird species were modelled {{in terms of}} the probability of these species colliding with or being electrocuted on overhead power lines in South Africa, based on morphological and behavioral factors. Species were included in the model on the basis of internationally recognized vulnerability to these interactions at the family level. The collision model performed poorly when tested against the actual reported mortalities for species contained in the Eskom-EWT Strategic Partnership Central Incident Register CIR) (chi-square of goodness of fit) at the individual species, family and within family levels. The electrocution model performed slightly better at the family, and within family level. Both collision and electrocution models performed better for the physically larger species (and families) and for those species with higher modelled probability of collision or electrocution. As the product of random carcass detection and reporting, the CIR data are biased in various ways. Testing the models against the CIR is therefore equally important for highlighting inadequacies in the CIR, as in the model. A number of new species have emerged as being of high collision (including most importantly African Pygmy Goose, Southern Ground Hornbill, <b>Black-bellied</b> Bustard, Yellow-throated <b>Sandgrouse,</b> Caspian Tern, Hooded Vulture, Bateleur, African Marsh Harrier, Black Harrier, Pink-backed Pelican and Yellow-billed Stork) or electrocution (Southern Bald Ibis) probability in theoretical terms, and will require further investigation to determine their actual probability of interaction. By mapping the combined distributions of those species with high probabilities of collision and/or electrocution mortality, a number of priority high risk geographic areas emerge around the country...|$|R

40|$|Ascertaining which niche {{processes}} allow coexistence between {{closely related}} species is of special interest in ecology. We quantified variations in the environmental niches and densities of two congeneric species, the pin-tailed and the <b>black-bellied</b> <b>sandgrouse</b> (Pterocles alchata and Pterocles orientalis) in allopatry and sympatry under similar abiotic, habitat and dispersal contexts to understand their coexistence. Using principal component analysis, we defined environmental gradients (niche dimensions) including abiotic, habitat and anthropogenic variables, and calculated niche breadth, position and overlap of both species in sympatry and allopatry. Additionally, sandgrouse density was modelled {{as a function of}} the niche dimensions and the density of the other species. We found evidence that each species occupies distinct environmental niches in sympatry and in allopatry. The <b>black-bellied</b> <b>sandgrouse</b> exploits a broader range of environmental conditions (wider niche breadth) while the pin-tailed sandgrouse reaches high densities where conditions seem to match its optimum. In sympatry, both species shift their niches to intermediate positions, indicating the importance of abiotic factors in setting coexistence areas. Environmental conditions determine regional densities of pin-tailed sandgrouse whereas biotic interactions explain the density of the <b>black-bellied</b> <b>sandgrouse</b> in areas with abiotic conditions similarly conducive for both species. Highly suitable areas for the pin-tailed sandgrouse fall beyond the upper thermal limit of the <b>black-bellied</b> <b>sandgrouse,</b> leading to niche segregation and low densities for the latter. Finally, local niche shift and expansion plus possible heterospecific aggregation allow the pin-tailed sandgrouse to thrive in a priori less favourable environments. This work provides insight into how different mechanisms allow species coexistence and how species densities vary in sympatry compared to allopatry as a result of environmental filtering and biotic interactions.

40|$|Predictive species' {{distribution}} models may answer ecological {{questions about}} habitat selection, co-occurrence of species and competition between them. We studied the habitat preferences and segregation of two sympatric species of declining sandgrouse, the <b>black-bellied</b> <b>sandgrouse</b> (Pterocles orientalis) and the pin-tailed sandgrouse (Pterocles alchata), during the breeding season. We developed predictive models that related sandgrouse presence to environmental variables at three different spatial levels: large geographical, landscape and microhabitat scales. At the large geographical scale, differences between sandgrouse distributions, in the Iberian Peninsula, {{seem to be}} explained mainly in terms of bioclimatology: pin-tailed sandgrouse {{appear to be a}} more thermophilous species and occupy warmer sites usually located in flatter areas. At the landscape spatial level, in those areas that exhibit environmental conditions allowing for both species' co-existence at a large geographical scale, <b>black-bellied</b> <b>sandgrouse</b> appear to be more tolerant to environmental variation than pin-tailed sandgrouse. At the microhabitat level, however, differences between species could be related to different flocking behaviour as a consequence of different sensitivities to vegetation structure and predators. Thus, the observed spatial distribution patterns are the result of different ecological factors that operate at different spatial levels. Conservation guidelines for these species should therefore consider their habitat preferences at large geographical, landscape and microhabitat scales. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

40|$|Capturing and marking {{free-living}} birds {{permits the}} study of important aspects of their biology but may have undesirable effects. Bird welfare should be a primary concern, so {{it is necessary to}} evaluate and minimize any adverse effects of procedures used. We assess short-term effects associated with the capture, handling and tagging with backpack-mounted transmitters of Pin-tailed Pterocles alchata and Black-bellied Pterocles orientalis Sandgrouse, steppe birds of conservation concern. There was a significantly higher mortality (15 %) during the first week after capture than during the following weeks (< 2. 5 %) in Pin-tailed Sandgrouse, but no significant temporal mortality pattern in <b>Black-bellied</b> <b>Sandgrouse.</b> In Pin-tailed Sandgrouse, mortality rate during the first week increased with increasing relative transmitter and harness weight regardless of season, and with increasing handling time during the breeding season. There {{were no significant differences in}} mortality rate between study areas, type of tag, sex or age or an effect of restraint time. These results suggest the use of lighter transmitters (< 3 % of the bird’s weight) and a reduction of handling time (< 20 min), particularly during the breeding season, as essential improvements in procedure to reduce the mortality risk associated with the capture, handling and tagging of these vulnerable species...|$|E
40|$|Niche theory {{predicts that}} coexisting species with similar trophic {{requirements}} should demonstrate resource partitioning, particularly where resources are scarce. Conversely, {{this is not}} expected between species that do not share primary resources. This study analyses the patterns of spatial coexistence and habitat selection, on two spatial scales, of three species of semidesert regions in Morocco: the <b>Black-bellied</b> <b>Sandgrouse</b> (Pterocles orientalis), the Stone Curlew (Burhinus oedicnemus) and the Cream-coloured Courser (Cursorius cursor). Co-occurrence analysis results point to between-species segregation on a macrohabitat scale. Hotelling's T test of the species-presence data showed a pattern of macrohabitat selection that diverged from habitat availability for the three species with differences among them. Both the classification tree and the pattern of microhabitat selection obtained by model averaging showed scant overlap between the Sandgrouse and the Courser, suggesting habitat partitioning between them on a fine scale. Our results confirm spatial segregation of the three species, especially between species with different trophic strategies: the Sandgrouse versus the Stone Curlew and the Courser. The latter two species were best segregated on a microhabitat scale, supporting the conclusions that macro- and microhabitat selection are major factors in bird community configuration in arid ecosystems and contributing to reduce potential competition.

40|$|Sandgrouse are {{birds of}} arid environments adapted {{to cope with}} extreme {{temperature}} variations. We used temperature data-loggers to remotely study incubation rhythms by pin-tailed and <b>black-bellied</b> <b>sandgrouse</b> in Spain. In both species, mates switched incubation roles twice a day, between 08 : 00 and 10 : 00 and between 19 : 30 and 21 : 30, when the nest and ambient temperature were most similar. During mate switches, sandgrouse preferred to risk a cooling rather than a warming of eggs. In the pin-tailed sandgrouse, the timing of morning switches was consistent within-pairs, while the timing of evening switches was more related to sunset time. Absences lasted longer following a disturbance than during a mate switch. During disturbances, changes in nest temperatures depended on the changes in outside temperature, and negatively correlated with absence duration. Absences following a disturbance were shorter when the outside temperature was higher. Nesting success was low (19 %), with no noticeable effect of data-loggers. Our study highlights some of the constraints that birds breeding in arid environments, such as sandgrouse, face during incubation. It also stresses out the importance of evaluating the consequences of disturbances during incubation, in particular nest visits. Temperature data-loggers can provide an easy and effective way of monitoring nests, without the need of repeated nest visits.
