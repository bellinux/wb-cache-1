Whereas the mountain treeshrew visits pitchers during daylight hours, the summit rat is primarily active at night; this may <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> resource partitioning.

5|$|The King Island emu (Dromaius novaehollandiae minor) is an extinct {{subspecies}} of emu {{that was}} endemic to King Island, which {{is situated in}} the Bass Strait between mainland Australia and Tasmania. Its closest relative may be the extinct Tasmanian emu (D. n. diemenensis), as they belonged to a single population until less than 14,000 years ago, when Tasmania and King Island were still connected. The small size of the King Island emu may <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> insular dwarfism.|$|E
5|$|The black morph is {{less common}} than the spotted form but, at about {{six percent of}} the population, it is several orders of {{magnitude}} above the mutation rate. Hence, it is being supported by selection. Some evidence indicates the melanism allele is dominant. The black form may <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> heterozygote advantage; breeding in captivity is not yet conclusive on this. Melanistic jaguars (or “black” jaguars) occur primarily in parts of South America, and are virtually unknown in wild populations residing in the subtropical and temperate regions of North America; {{they have never been}} documented north of Mexico’s Isthmus of Tehuantepec.|$|E

5|$|Some {{species of}} rodent are monogamous, {{with an adult}} male and female forming a lasting pair bond. Monogamy can come in two forms; obligate and facultative. In obligate monogamy, both parents care for the {{offspring}} and play {{an important part in}} their survival. This occurs in species such as California mice, oldfield mice, Malagasy giant rats and beavers. In these species, males usually mate only with their partners. In addition to increased care for young, obligate monogamy can also be beneficial to the adult male as it decreases the chances of never finding a mate or mating with an infertile female. In facultative monogamy, the males do not provide direct parental care and stay with one female because they cannot access others due to being spatially dispersed. Prairie voles appear to <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> this form of monogamy, with males guarding and defending females within their vicinity.|$|E
5|$|The genus Compsognathus gives {{its name}} to the family Compsognathidae, a group {{composed}} mostly of small dinosaurs from the late Jurassic and early Cretaceous periods of China, Europe and South America. For many years it was the only member known; however in recent decades paleontologists have discovered several related genera. The clade includes Aristosuchus, Huaxiagnathus, Mirischia, Sinosauropteryx, and perhaps Juravenator and Scipionyx. At one time, Mononykus was proposed {{as a member of the}} family, but this was rejected by Chen and coauthors in a 1998 paper; they considered the similarities between Mononykus and the compsognathids to <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> convergent evolution. The position of Compsognathus and its relatives within the coelurosaur group is uncertain. Some, such as theropod expert Thomas Holtz Jr. and co-authors Ralph Molnar and Phil Currie in the landmark 2004 text Dinosauria, hold the family as the most basal of the coelurosaurs, while others as part of the Maniraptora.|$|E
5|$|In January 2013, Montag and Pratt as {{a single}} entity competed as housemates on the {{eleventh}} series of the British version of Celebrity Big Brother, where they notably developed a minor feud with singer and television personality Rylan Clark. They were named the runners-up, losing to Clark. On February 18, Channel 5 aired a one-off television special discussing Montag and Pratt's rise to prominence, titled Speidi: Scandal, Secrets & Surgery!. Later that year, they launched the Speidi Show, which was initially {{assumed to be a}} web series in which the couple used a different reality television format for each installment. However, the project was later revealed to <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> networked improv narrative, where Montag and Pratt collaborated with Mark Marino and Rob Wittig to create a Twitter game in which players Live Tweet an imaginary show. In October 2013, Montag revealed that her original F-cup breast implants resulted in severe health issues, and underwent a breast reduction surgery to replace them with D-cup implants. She and Pratt appeared in the television special After Shock: Heidi & Spencer, which premiered on December 9, 2013, on E!, during which they admitted that many of the situations they were involved with in the various reality series they starred on were in fact made up by the shows producers. Montag and Pratt later appeared on an episode of Celebrity Wife Swap in June 2014, for which they swapped with Olympic athlete Amanda Beard and her husband Sacha Brown. In October 2015, Montag and her husband made several media appearances that were largely devoted to two subjects: claiming that their image as terrible people stemming from The Hills was not factual and, somewhat divergently, their intense dislike of Lauren Conrad, which included Montag's husband admitting he spread rumors (which Montag said were true but have never been proven) that Conrad made a sex tape with a former boyfriend. Montag also claimed she had been paid to remain Conrad's friend during her time on the show, while also adding she had reconciled with her family to her husband's displeasure.|$|E
