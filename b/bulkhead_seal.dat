40|$|The new C- 5 M engine pylon was {{subjected}} to live fire testing {{as part of the}} overall C- 5 RERP Live Fire Test and Evaluation (LFT&E) program. The pylon was designed, as much as possible, to physically separate the flammable fluid carrying lines from the ignition sources. This was done by routing the flammable fluid carrying lines through the structural box while the ignition sources are routed from the engine core compartment to the wing/pylon interface through the pylon leading edge. Designed into the pylon are fire resistant materials for structure, hydraulics, fuel, and bleed air lines. The pylon also provides fluid drain lines for potential flammable fluid line fitting leaks, and ventilation in flammable fluid areas. Twelve ballistic shots were performed on this unique, orthogrid construction engine pylon. The objective was to determine the ignition and sustained fire potential by impacting two dry bays within the engine pylon. The bays of interest are Zone 2 – “Wing Interface Compartment (Fire Zone) ” and Zone 3 – “Structural Box Compartment (Flammable Fluids Zone) ”. Zone 2, enclosed by Aluminum 2219 -T 81 skin, contains fuel and hydraulic lines, an ECS duct, wire bundles, fire resistant <b>bulkhead</b> <b>seals,</b> a 5 -min – 2000 ˚F fire-resistant bulkhead, and drainage.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Water {{control has}} been and remains a {{fundamentally}} important aspect of underground coal mine design and operation worldwide. Mining {{in the vicinity of}} large bodies of water, below a worked out coal seam or under confined aquifer or abandoned water logged workings is always fraught with the possibility of the danger of inundation. Inrush control is now part the Fatal Hazard Protocols which is a risk based process in all operations. In modern Australian underground coal mines, in which panel layouts have been extended and production rates are approaching 10 Mtpa, there is much focus on the control of water inflows. Flooding of mine workings can cause deterioration of roadways as was evidenced at Broadmeadow Mine in 2008 soon after the water receded due to a sudden reduction or pore water pressure, mobilisation of joints/cleats and swelling of clay layers in coal measures. Ventilation seals are primarily used in underground coal mines to isolate abandoned or worked out areas. However these seals are often required to impound large volumes of water to control the hazard mostly at the inbye end of longwall operations and in natural valleys. A systematic approach is required for the design of <b>bulkhead</b> <b>seals</b> including consideration of the longevity of building materials, quality control during construction and methods to monitor performance of the retention system.

25|$|The Army Corps of Engineers built a {{cofferdam}} around Maine {{and pumped}} water out from inside it. By 30 June 1911, Maines main deck was exposed. The ship forward of frame 41 was entirely destroyed; a twisted mass of steel {{out of line}} {{with the rest of the}} hull, all that was left of the bow, bore no resemblance to a ship. The rest of the wreck was badly corroded. Army engineers dismantled the damaged superstructure and decks, which were then dumped at sea. About halfway between bow and stern, they built a concrete and wooden <b>bulkhead</b> to <b>seal</b> the after-section, then cut away what was left of the forward portion. Holes were cut in the bottom of the after-section, through which jets of water were pumped, to break the mud seal holding the ship, then plugged, with flood cocks, which would later be used for sinking the ship.|$|R
5|$|Each <b>bulkhead</b> {{could be}} <b>sealed</b> by {{watertight}} doors. The engine rooms and boiler {{rooms on the}} tank top deck had vertically closing doors that could be controlled remotely from the bridge, lowered automatically by a float if water was present, or closed manually by the crew. These took about 30 seconds to close; warning bells and alternate escape routes were provided so that the crew would not be trapped by the doors. Above the tank top level, on the Orlop Deck, F Deck and E Deck, the doors closed horizontally and were manually operated. They could be closed at the door itself or from the deck above.|$|R
50|$|Before the {{development}} of the Cox Box by Nielsen-Kellerman, a megaphone strapped {{to the head of the}} coxswain was used to make the coxswain easier to hear, and the coxswain used an analog stop watch and rate watch - quite a handful when also trying to steer a 60' long racing shell! The use of a system with multiple speakers also became much more important when racing eight construction switched to <b>sealed</b> <b>bulkhead</b> sections to ensure the boat would remain safely buoyant even when damaged. This is because sound could no longer travel down the hull as was possible with the previous open style of construction.|$|R

50|$|Having {{fallen from}} public notice, the tunnel was rediscovered in 1980 by then 20-year-old Robert Diamond, who entered from a manhole he located at Atlantic Avenue and Court Street, crawled a {{distance}} of 70 ft underground through a filled-in section of tunnel less than two feet high, and located the <b>bulkhead</b> wall that <b>sealed</b> off the main portion of the tunnel. With {{the assistance of a}} Brooklyn Union Gas Co. (now National Grid) engineering crew, he then broke through the massive concrete bulkhead wall, which is several feet thick. Diamond thereby opened access to the main portion of the tunnel, and began to popularize the tunnel as an antiquity. He led tours of its interior from 1982 until December 17, 2010, when the Department of Transportation terminated his contract, citing safety concerns. The tunnel has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1989.|$|R
50|$|For several years, Maine {{was left}} where she sank in Havana Harbor, {{although}} it was evident {{she would have to}} be removed sometime. Maine took up valuable space and the buildup of silt around her hull threatened to create a shoal. In addition, various patriotic groups wanted mementos of the ship. On 9 May 1910, Congress authorized funds for the removal of Maine, the proper interment in Arlington National Cemetery of the estimated 70 bodies still inside, and the removal and transport of the main mast to Arlington. Congress did not demand a new investigation into the sinking at that time.The Army Corps of Engineers built a cofferdam around Maine and pumped water out from inside it.

Tensa explains {{that there is no}} escape, as all non-essential machinery is destroyed, every door and <b>bulkhead</b> is <b>sealed,</b> and the station will fall from its decaying orbit in 16 days. The hologram device is blown up, {{and it turns out that}} a [...] "companion" [...] named [...] "Talen" [...] attempted to find a power source (the hologram unit). Talen also gives Sen flight skills and [...] "Chameleon Tech" [...] to disguise his identity. With that, Sen boards a shuttle and enters the planet itself, discovering that the inhabitants have formed two tribes: The [...] "Trasai" [...] and [...] "Ansala". According to Talen, the Transai believe that science is the only answer for survival, while the Ansala profess love of nature, natural methods, and even mental powers to control the environment. Hidden is a nomad named Arko, who refused to take sides with either tribe, and instead is friends of the Companions. Arko explains that in the past there was a great city. Then an alien starship appeared, two young scientists, Sen Geder, a Transai astrophysicist, and Chemay Tars, an Ansala astronomer, both tried to have the aliens intervene, but missiles downed the ship, and a war broke out, lasting over 200 years, turning the planet into a single valley and Sen and Chemay to blame, captured by the Ansala. The Companions were alien machines aided by the Transai, but destroyed or downgraded by the Ansala.|$|R
5000|$|The first cars {{built for}} the P&W never ran on the P&W, since the cars were {{completed}} before the line was ready to open. Twenty-two wooden electric multiple-unit passenger cars and 2 full-baggage-configured MU's were {{built for the}} P&W by the St. Louis Car Co. in 1906. However, due to the San Francisco earthquake 12 of them went to MUNI predecessor United Railroads of San Francisco, 4 went to the Sacramento Northern Railroad, and the remainder went to the Erie Railroad Rochester-Mt. Morris Branch, where they were modified and rewired for overhead AC operation. The 12 cars that went to URR of SF had their <b>bulkhead</b> doors <b>sealed</b> and their MU capabilities removed, operating strictly as single-units. The 4 SN cars were converted into motorized combination baggage/passenger cars and used on the Woodland Branch. The two baggage cars were accepted by the P&W, where they were turned into line-maintenance cars. Finally in 1907, 22 wooden passenger cars, almost {{identical to the original}} order, arrived on P&W property. They were originally equipped with rectangular-shaped bow collectors, which were later replaced with trolley poles for use in the carbarn area in addition to third rail shoes. Of these cars, No. 46 survives, along with line car No. 401 from the original order; both of which are preserved at the Electric City Trolley Museum in Scranton, PA. Prior to the move to Scranton, they ran as a two-car train while in operation at the Philadelphia Waterfront every Christmas season for many years as the [...] "Santa Train," [...] with No. 401 operating as Santa's workshop and No. 46 used for the passengers.|$|R
2500|$|In [...] "Hell Bent", the TARDIS {{gives the}} Doctor {{a brand new}} sonic {{screwdriver}}. The new screwdriver has a TARDIS-blue shaft with gold and silver highlights. The upper half is a rectangular light grid that, when switched on, has four different functions: green light with low-pitched sound, blue light with high-pitched sound, green lights that pulse with a pulsing sound, and a blue light chasing pattern with a pulsing sound. The new sonic screwdriver is meant to represent the TARDIS. The Doctor first uses it in [...] "The Husbands of River Song" [...] (although he also employs the sonic sunglasses earlier in the episode). The new screwdriver has seen use in the spin-off show Class, where the Doctor increases the voltage of flood lights to expel the Shadow Kin and partially close a rift in space-time. He is shown to have working copies of every version of the Sonic Screwdriver ever seen before in a cup on his desk in [...] "The Pilot."
