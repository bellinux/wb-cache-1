5000|$|In 1923, the Hebards were {{approached}} by Ford Motor Company, {{who wanted to}} purchase their timber stands only. Mindful of Pequaming's future, the Hebards convinced Ford to purchase the mill and surrounding town as well, and entered into secret negotiations {{with the hope of}} completing the sale before operations began. On September 8, 1923, Ford Motor Company purchased the mill and surrounding town for the sum of $2,850,000; the purchase included the double <b>band</b> <b>sawmill,</b> lath and shingle mills, 40,000 acres (160 km²) of timber land, [...] of lumber, [...] of cut logs, the town land and buildings, the railroad, and towing and water equipment.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} small {{portable}} sawmills {{consisting of a}} shop-size bandsaw mounted on a guiding table, which are called bandsaw mills (band saw mills, <b>band</b> <b>sawmills).</b> Like chain saw mills (a chainsaw on a guiding table), {{they can be used}} inexpensively by one or two people out in the field.|$|R
5000|$|Band saw: a ripsaw on a {{motor-driven}} continuous <b>band.</b> Portable <b>sawmills</b> {{are typically}} <b>band</b> saw mills.|$|R
40|$|The {{shrinking}} {{average size}} of Connecticut forested land parcels, {{as well as}} increased interest in roadside forest management activities and small-acreage treatments for wildlife habitats, all necessitate scale-appropriate management methodologies for tree harvesting and vegetation management. Corresponding value-added processing for wood products, such as with portable <b>band</b> <b>sawmills,</b> {{has the potential to}} foster local markets and utilization of wood products in the small quantities produced. A survey of portable band saw mill operators (PBSOs) in Connecticut was conducted to help determine the capacity for PBSOs to assist in addressing the state’s small-scale forest management needs. Results of the survey revealed that the majority of sawmill owners are over the age of 60; age and annual income had significant effects on interest in operating a PBSO business, whereas sawmill ownership and income effected possible interest in becoming part of a niche market. Current sawyers indicated a need for education in harvesting and operational practices, value-added techniques, and marketing, with an additional interest in obtaining logs from roadsides. PBSOs can be of assistance in addressing small scale forest management needs...|$|R
50|$|The Collection has got {{a machine}} shop for {{dismantling}} and rebuilding engines, where new parts are made, when necessary. The Collection also exhibits some historical machinery, such as a <b>band</b> saw based <b>sawmill</b> driven by a Bukh engine via an elaborate belt drive, connecting the indoor engine with the outdoor sawmill.|$|R
5000|$|All sawmills use rip saws {{of various}} types {{including}} the circular saw and <b>band</b> saw. Historically <b>sawmills</b> used one or more reciprocating saws more specifically known as an [...] "up-and-down" [...] or [...] "upright saw" [...] which are of two basic types, the frame saw or a muley (mulay) saw {{which is similar to}} the hand powered pit saw. Some sawmills also use crosscut saws to cut boards and planks to length.|$|R
5000|$|During the recording, various {{external}} musicians {{were brought}} in {{to add to the}} band's sound, with Shearer being particularly influenced by The Beach Boys and The Beatles as well as The Pink Floyd and Syd Barrett (where they get their name). Only five of the album's fifteen tracks do not feature a guest bass guitar player: the other ten tracks feature bass playing by sessions musician Dave Quinn, Francolini's former Levitation colleague Robert White (also of The Milk and Honey Band), or the original Octopus bass guitarist Steven McSeveney. In addition, Francolini plays drums on two tracks and piano on another, as well as playing Moog synthesizer on five tracks and contributing keyboards, percussion, samples and various noises throughout the album. Francolini also co-wrote six of the album's songs, including the single [...] "Magazine" [...] although Marc Shearer wrote every song on the album. The recording process was long and expensive with the <b>band</b> experimenting in <b>Sawmill's</b> Studio, using the natural creek as echo and recording in tents. The backwards guitar solo on [...] "Your Smile" [...] is from the original 4-track recording done in Shearer's kitchen in Glasgow and the album is a mixture of high and low production values.Other contributing musicians include both core members of Blowpipe (Robin and Andrew Blick, the latter of whom was part of Octopus' live brass section), singer Katherine Blake (Mediaeval Baebes, Miranda Sex Garden), folk musician Nigel Mazlyn Jones and cellist Audrey Riley. Many songs were recorded during the several sessions with the band pulling in a more psychedelic direction and the label looking for pop hits like [...] "Jealousy" [...] which Shearer had written as a wry comment on pop singles. When the initial singles, [...] "Magazine", [...] "Your Smile" [...] and [...] "Saved" [...] were not major hits, EMI pushed for the release of [...] "Jealousy" [...] believing it to be radio friendly but it also failed to perform well in the charts.|$|R
