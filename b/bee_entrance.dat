40|$|In {{order to}} test various hive systems in growing and {{exploitation}} of bee colonies, {{and in order}} to estimate comparative advantages and disadvantages, assessment of biological bee comfort, as well as economic efficiency of their exploitation in small and medium beekeeping farms, was carried out an experiment on comparative study of maintaining bee colonies in different types of hives: horizontal and vertical, both with Dadant frames. Two similar batches of bee colonies were created. The first batch of 20 colonies was put in horizontal hives and second batch with 25 colonies– in vertical hives. The main sources of honey in the area were: Acacia, Linden tree and spontaneous flora. In beekeeping season of 2011 have been studied main biological and morpho productive characters of bee colonies, such as: colony strengthens, resistance to overwinter and diseases, queens prolificacy, brood viability, total quantity of honey collected in nest after harvest. Appreciation of morpho productive characters was done according to our methodology developed by the new zootechnic regulation according to bee colonies valuation, growing and certification of genitor beekeeping materials, approved by decision of Government of Republic of Moldova no. 306 of 28. 04. 2011. It was found that the types of hives, where were housed the experimental bees, all other equal conditions of maintenance and exploitation, have not had any impact on the biological process of bees overwinter. This is confirmed {{by the fact that the}} average strengthens of bee colonies in both experimental groups, being equal at the beginning of experiment (1, 78 kg in the autumn of 2010, in entry of overwinter) remained same in spring of 2011 (1, 49 kg out of the winter). Therefore, overwinter resistance of bee colonies in both groups was also identical, averaging 83. 1 %. At the same time, the hive types, tested in experiment, had a significant influence on reproduction process and development of bee colonies in high beekeeping season. Thus, the queens prolificacy from 2 nd batch with bee colonies located in vertical hives during the season, was higher compared to the Ist batch, accommodated in vertical hives, with 60 eggs/ 24 hours, or with 3. 5 % (B > 0. 95). A better prolificacy activity of queens in vertical hives can be explained, in our view, by the fact that they have a better comfort of laying, compared with those from horizontal hives. We found that in horizontal hives, queens prefer for laying the area near <b>bee</b> <b>entrance</b> and it is explained by the fact that this place is better aired and ensure the brood with sufficient oxygen. In vertical hives queens laying is more uniform and it is spread on more honeycombs. This is due to a better and uniform ventilation in entire hive, which gives enough oxygen to brood. All this, has led to an active laying of queens from vertical hives, also to a bigger amount of capped brood and as a result, essential increase of bee colony strengthens. At the beginning of first harvest (locust tree), bee colonies placed in vertical hives reclaimed at a bigger rate than those placed in horizontal hives. Regarding bee colonies strengthens, those from 2 nd batch exceeded significant, at this stage, those from 1 st batch, with 0. 33 kg or 9, 4 % (B > 0, 99). Bee colonies from vertical hives entered overwinter significantly more powerful than bees from horizontal hives, which creates premises for a stronger development and better productivity in the next beekeeping season. Due to a quicker development, bee colonies kept in vertical hives accumulated, during active season, a bigger quantity of honey in the nest. Thus, the total quantity of honey accumulated in nest, bee families maintained in vertical hives have significantly exceeded those from horizontal hives with 7. 5 kg, or 19, 1 % (B > 0. 999). Economic effect obtained at exploitation of vertical hives only from honey production is 375 MD lei, or 23. 8 euro per bee colony. Based on obtained results were made following conclusions. 1. Vertical hives compared to horizontal hives, offer to bee colony more comfortable biological conditions. 2. Maintenance of bee colonies in vertical hives ensures an increase of queens laying - 3. 5 % and of average annual strengthens of the bee colony – with 6. 0 %. 3. Use of vertical hives contributes to increasing of honey production with 19. 1 %. 4. Bee colonies exploitation in vertical hives ensures economic efficiency at least 23. 8 euro per bee colony...|$|E

50|$|The primary {{measure of}} defense for A. nigrocincta is to live in {{cavities}}, as the cavities restrict accessibility of resources to a predator, but allow possession of valuable and limited resources to the <b>bees</b> themselves. <b>Entrances</b> to these cavities are guarded and check incoming traffic for any intruders. Another act of defense is “body shaking,” a violent and pendulum like swaying of the abdomen, performed by worker bees to discourage any insects, especially wasps, from invading the nest.|$|R
40|$|Several recent hypotheses, {{including}} sensory {{drive and}} sensory exploitation, suggest that receiver biases may drive selection of biological signals {{in the context}} of sexual selection. Here we suggest that a similar mechanism may have led to convergence of patterns in flowers, stingless <b>bee</b> nest <b>entrances,</b> and pitchers of insectivorous plants. A survey of these non-related visual stimuli shows that they share features such as stripes, dark centre, and peripheral dots. Next, we experimentally show that in stingless bees the close-up approach to a flower is guided by dark centre preference. Moreover, in the approach towards their nest entrance, they have a spontaneous preference for entrance patterns containing a dark centre and disrupted ornamentation. Together with existing empirical evidence on the honeybee's and other insects' orientation to flowers, this suggests that the signal receivers of the natural patterns we examined, mainly Hymenoptera, have spontaneous preferences for radiating stripes, dark centres, and peripheral dots. These receiver biases may have evolved in other behavioural contexts in the ancestors of Hymenoptera, but our findings suggest that they have triggered the convergent evolution of visual stimuli in floral guides, stingless <b>bee</b> nest <b>entrances,</b> and insectivorous pitchers...|$|R
40|$|Summary. Honey <b>bee</b> nest <b>entrance</b> guards {{accepted}} a significantly lower proportion of non-nestmates {{of a different}} subspecies (5 %) than non-nestmates of their own subspecies (18 %). This result was consistent for 5 of the 6 study colonies (the sixth rejected all non-nestmates), 3 each of Apis mellifera mellifera and A. m. ligustica, and for each subspecies of guards (A. m. m. 5 % v 17 %; A. m. l. 4 % v 20 %). These data indicate that there are consistent recognition cue differences across subspecies...|$|R

40|$|In recognition, discriminators use sensory {{information}} to make decisions. For example, honeybee (Apis mellifera) entrance guards discriminate between nest-mates and intruders by comparing their odours with a template of the colony odour. Comb wax {{plays a major role}} in honeybee recognition. We measured the rejection rates of nest-mate and non-nest-mate worker <b>bees</b> by <b>entrance</b> guards before and after a unidirectional transfer of wax comb from a `comb donor¿ hive to a `comb receiver¿ hive. Our results showed a significant effect that occurred in one direction. Guards in the comb receiver hive became more accepting of non-nest-mates from the comb donor hive (rejection decreased from 70 to 47 %); however, guards in the comb donor hive did not become more accepting of bees from the comb receiver hive. These data strongly support the hypothesis that the transfer of wax comb increases the acceptance of non-nest-mates not by changing the odour of the bees, but by changing the template used by guards...|$|R
50|$|The nest {{entrance}} of Schwarziana quadripunctata {{consists of a}} simple, round opening. This is a distinct comparison to the complex entryways consisting of layered entrances or closable doorways observed in some other related species. Through the observation and measurement of several S. quadripunctata nests near São Paulo, Brazil, entrances were discovered to have an average area of 14.5 square millimeters (mm2). In comparison to the average stingless bee having an area of 2.1 mm2, this gives a ratio of 6.8 opening to <b>bee.</b> This smaller <b>entrance</b> provides more than enough space for the relatively low enter and exit traffic of 17.4 individuals per minute.|$|R
50|$|The moth {{also has}} {{numerous}} other unusual features. It {{has the ability}} to emit a loud squeak if irritated. The sound is produced by expelling air from its proboscis. It often accompanies this sound with flashing its brightly marked abdomen in a further attempt to deter its predators. It is commonly observed raiding beehives for honey at night. Unlike the other species of Acherontia, it only attacks colonies of the well-known Western honey bee, Apis mellifera. It is attacked by guard <b>bees</b> at the <b>entrance,</b> but the thick cuticle and resistance to venom allow it to enter the hive. It is able to move about in hives unmolested because it mimics the scent of the bees.|$|R
40|$|International audienceGuard honey <b>bees</b> {{patrol the}} <b>entrance</b> to the nest and {{are thought to}} {{recognise}} nestmates by cuticular hydrocarbons. We aimed to determine whether honey bee guards can recognise predatory common wasps Vespula vulgaris and nestmates by olfactory cues. Odours were transferred between both honey bees and wasps and the responses of guards to controlled introductions monitored. When controlling for the species of introduced insect, the transferred odour was a predictor of aggressive attacks on both bees and wasps. Carriers of incongruous, allospecific odours were antennated by more guards than carriers of conspecific odours. Olfactory cues were, therefore, transferred and guards responded not only to odour per se but also odour incongruity. Olfactory cues may therefore be important in predator recognition by honey bee guards...|$|R
40|$|International audienceCoelioxys chichimeca is a cleptoparasite and an {{important}} cause of mortality for several woodhole nesting pollinator bees in Costa Rica. We studied the behavior of this parasitic bee towards {{one of the more}} common host bee, Centris (Heterocentris) bicornuta. The female parasitic C. chichimeca were attracted to host bee, C. bicornuta nest cells that contained pollen, but only exhibited interest in entering and ovipositing when these host cells contained nectar. This interest was exhibited in three different ways: (1) the female parasite landed near the host <b>bee's</b> nest <b>entrance</b> and waited for the host bee to exit her nest cell before entering; (2) the female parasite entered briefly, re-emerged and re-entered with abdomen first; and (3) the female parasite entered the host bee nest as in (2), but did not exit and re-enter due to larger nest holes, where she could presumably turn around in any direction to lay the egg. We also found that female parasites would briefly hover in front of vials that contained pollen, but would land nearby when the vial contained nectar. Additionally, eggs of the female parasite were inserted horizontally in the wall of the host bee cell, primarily in the upper half. Larvae of these parasites hatched before the host bee egg and with their sickle shaped mandibles, killed any host bee egg or larva present and consumed the nest provisions. Host bees returning to a parasitized cell often removed the nectar, presumably in an attempt to remove the parasite egg...|$|R
50|$|Females {{in search}} of nesting sites are {{attracted}} to existing holes in wood materials where nests are usually formed. Upon arrival at a desirable site {{where there are no}} current inhabitants, the female will inspect the existing tunnel system extensively. If the hole is an occupied and guarded nest, the guarding bee will block the entrance. If not guarded, a resident of the nest will come to block the entrance if in the area by protruding their head from the hole. The stranger will hover around the hole for a brief period of time, and often the resident will attempt to chase the stranger away. If the intruder is able to bypass the resident <b>bee</b> at the <b>entrance,</b> a struggle will ensue accompanied by loud buzzing noises. These struggles can last up to a couple hours. Either the intruder is then thrown out, or will throw out the resident, at which point the process for a takeover occurs, beginning with the eviction of any existing brood. The benefits of guarding behavior can clearly be seen here as strangers hardly ever intrude on social nests containing more than one adult.|$|R
40|$|Honey <b>bee</b> (Apis mellifera) <b>entrance</b> guards {{discriminate}} nestmates from intruders. We {{tested the}} hypothesis that the recognition cues between nestmate bees and intruder bees overlap by comparing their acceptances with that of worker common wasps, Vespula vulgaris, by entrance guards. If recognition cues of nestmate and non-nestmate bees overlap, we would expect recognition errors. Conversely, we hypothesised that guards would not make errors in recognizing wasps because wasps and bees should have distinct, non-overlapping cues. We found both to be true. There was a negative correlation between errors in recognizing nestmates (error: reject nestmate) and nonnestmates (error: accept non-nestmate) bees such that when guards were likely to reject nestmates, they were less likely to accept a nonnestmate; conversely, when guards were likely to accept a non-nestmate, they were less likely to reject a nestmate. There was, however, no correlation between errors in the recognition of nestmate bees (error: reject nestmate) and wasps (error: accept wasp), demonstrating that guards were able to reject wasps categorically. Our results strongly support that overlapping cue distributions occur, resulting in errors and leading to adaptive shifts in guard acceptance thresholds...|$|R
40|$|The {{spectral}} sensitivity of single photoreceptors of Osmia rufa {{was determined by}} a fast voltage-clamp technique. Three receptor types were found whose {{spectral sensitivity}} functions followed a rhodopsin-like photopigment absorption function with A,,, ^ values at 348 nm (ultraviolet receptor), 436 nm (blue receptor) and 572 nm (green receptor). The Amax of the green receptor in Osmia rufa is shifted to much longer wavelengths compared with other insect species. Discrimi-nation of colour signals was tested after training a <b>bee</b> at the <b>entrance</b> to its nest. The colour signals were filter discs (70 mm in diameter) with a hole (10 mm in diameter) in the centre and the bees quickly learned to use the coloured disc as a marker of the nest entrance.

40|$|Research {{has shown}} that the wax combs are {{important}} in the acquisition of colony odour in the honeybee, Apis mellifera. However, many of these studies were conducted in the laboratory or under artificial conditions. We investigated the role of the wax combs in nestmate recognition in the natural context of <b>bees</b> at colony <b>entrances.</b> Wax combs constructed by each experimental colony were swapped between hives and the acceptance of nestmate and non-nestmate forager workers was recorded before and after the swap, and in relation to a control hive not involved in the swap. We conducted the experiment twice, in consecutive years with three different colonies each time. Colonies that exchanged combs became more accepting of each other's workers than of workers from the third colony. The overall acceptance of comb swap non-nestmates increased significantly from 3 % before the swap to 23 % after the swap in the first year, and from 8 to 47 % in the second year. This effect wore off within 3 weeks. Chemical analyses showed that the cuticular profile of non-nestmates involved in the experimental comb swap became more similar to each other after the swap, and that acceptance by guards of bees from different hives was negatively correlated with chemical distance between the hydrocarbon profiles of the workers from different hives. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{experiments}} analyze {{different forms}} of learning and 24 -h retention {{in the field and}} in the laboratory in bees that accept sucrose with either low (≤ 3 %) or high (≥ 30 % or ≥ 50 %) concentrations. In the field we studied color learning at a food site and at the hive entrance. In the laboratory olfactory conditioning of the proboscis extension response (PER) was examined. In the color learning protocol at a feeder, bees with low sucrose acceptance thresholds (≤ 3 %) show significantly faster and better acquisition than bees with high thresholds (≥ 50 %). Retention after 24 h is significantly different between the two groups of bees and the choice reactions converge. Bees with low and high acceptance thresholds in the field show no differences in the sucrose sensitivity PER tests in the laboratory. Acceptance thresholds in the field are thus a more sensitive behavioral measure than PER responsiveness in the laboratory. Bees with low acceptance thresholds show significantly better acquisition and 24 -h retention in olfactory learning in the laboratory compared to bees with high thresholds. In the learning protocol at the hive <b>entrance</b> <b>bees</b> learn without sucrose reward that a color cue signals an open entrance. In this experiment, bees with high sucrose acceptance thresholds showed significantly better learning and reversal learning than bees with low thresholds. These results demonstrate that sucrose acceptance thresholds affect only those forms of learning in which sucrose serves as the reward. The results also show that foraging behavior in the field is a good predictor for learning behavior in the field and in the laboratory...|$|R
