2500|$|Even {{before the}} United States entered World War II {{on the side}} of the Allies, Saginaw's {{industrial}} complex became directed towards military production. Turning its efforts to the production of munitions, ordnance and components for military vehicles made Saginaw a significant contributor to the Allies' eventual victory. Perhaps most famously, Saginaw was home to a production facility that produced [...]30 caliber machine guns far more quickly and for far less than the Army thought possible, armor-piercing shells for anti-tank use, and over half a million M1 Carbine rifles for the U.S. military during World War II, the [...] "Gun Plant" [...] that later became <b>Steering</b> Gear <b>Plant</b> 2. Saginaw <b>Steering</b> Gear's <b>Plant</b> 1 also began wartime production in 1941, concentrating on ball screws that would eventually be used in the wing flaps of the Boeing B-29 Superfortress. Malleable Iron converted its production of Armasteel from engine components to gun parts and tank treads, while Grey Iron specialized in the production of magnesium for use in Pratt and Whitney aeroplane engines.|$|R
60|$|The strange {{vessel was}} about two cables' length ahead of the Scud, {{standing}} by the wind athwart her <b>bows,</b> and <b>steering</b> a course to render it probable that the latter would pass within a few yards of her. She was a full-rigged ship; and, seen through the misty medium of the tempest, the most experienced eye could detect no imperfection in her gear or construction. The only canvas she had set was a close-reefed main-topsail, and two small storm-staysails, one forward and the other aft. Still {{the power of the}} wind pressed so hard upon her as to bear her down nearly to her beam-ends, whenever the hull was not righted by the buoyancy of some wave under her lee. Her spars were all in their places, and by her motion through the water, which might have equalled four knots in the hour, it was apparent that she steered a little free.|$|R
30|$|Food {{security}} is {{of paramount importance}} and a pressing issue of our changing world. A changing climate and growing population are <b>steering</b> <b>plant</b> scientists and agricultural engineers to innovate improved tools to secure food production with less environmental impact. Nanotechnologies are one such novel tool that can be explored to solve this longstanding problem [1 – 3]. Nanotechnology has been predicted to become an important and integral part of the food production chain, serving, for example, a role in crop protection [4 – 6], fertilizers [7, 8], biosensors and precision farming [9], and food packaging and safety [10]. Nanoparticles are ubiquitous in nature, and plants have evolved exposed to various nanoparticles [11]. Iron oxide nanoparticles (IONs) constitute an important part of naturally occurring nanoparticles [12]. There is evidence that plants and soil microbes produce IONs [11, 13, 14]. While some researchers have been concerned with the toxicity to plants of engineered IONs [15, 16], others have focused on the possibility of using IONs as a fertilizer [17 – 22]. Magnetic nanoparticles of magnetite Fe 3 O 4 and maghemite γ-Fe 2 O 3 structure have been suggested to be effective nanozymes of both peroxidase mimetic ability (at low pH) and catalase mimetic ability (at neutral pH) [23 – 25]. It has been shown that, at certain concentrations, nano iron oxide increases plant growth compared to the addition of equivalent amounts of ferrous ions in chelated form [17]. We hypothesize that the enzymatic abilities of nano iron oxide can stimulate growth in plants above that of just iron fertilization. Further, we suggest that this should aid plants during common abiotic stresses such as drought, where catalase and peroxidase becomes important for scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS) being released. Here, we present investigations to test this hypothesis on γ-Fe 2 O 3 and oil seed rape, grown in soil and controlled environment.|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of above–belowground interactions for plant growth and community dynamics became {{clear in the}} last decades, whereas the numerous studies on plant life history improved our knowledge on eco-evolutionary dynamics. However, surprisingly few studies have linked both research fields despite their potential to increase our mechanistic understanding of how above belowground interactions are governed. Here I briefly review studies on above–belowground interactions and plant life history and identify important research gaps. To advance our understanding of ecological strategies and eco-evolutionary dynamics of plants and their associated organisms it is warranted to elucidate the interconnectivity and tradeoffs of plant life history traits of growth, defence, reproduction, nutrient cycling and the functional composition of above- and belowground heterotrophic communities. Using the concept of tradeoffs in growth, reproduction and defence we can postulate that plants in rich soil grow, reproduce and die fast whilst avoiding above- and belowground antagonists, whereas plants in poor soil grow slow, live and reproduce longer and invest in above- and belowground mutualists and defences. However, alternative scenarios are possible and depend on the selection pressure by above- and belowground mutualists and antagonists during plant ontogeny and via after-life effects. To elucidate missing links between life history traits and above–belowground interactions, complementary modelling and empirical studies are needed that reveal the coupling between below- and aboveground plant traits of growth, defence and reproduction, their heritability and their cost/benefit relation. These cost/benefit analyses of defence should span from individuals to future generations, taking feedback effects via altered biotic communities and resource competition into account. The role of soil fertility in <b>steering</b> <b>plant</b> life history traits requires explicit testing of trans-generational trait shifts in growth, defence, reproduction, cost/benefit of associations with mutualists and antagonists and soil feedbacks across plant genotypes/species with distinct life history traits, grown across soil fertility gradients...|$|R

Hailing Gypsum Queen close at hand on her port beam, Venetia {{signaled}} to “stay close…and keep in sight”. At less than a half-hour into the morning watch, at 0425, Venetia spotted a light on her starboard <b>bow</b> and began <b>steering</b> toward it. No sooner had the convoy flagship made contact with her one prodigal, but Gypsum Queen, that had fallen astern during the search for Barnegat, dropped below the horizon.|$|R
40|$|Plants {{are capable}} of synthesizing an {{overwhelming}} variety of secondary metabolites, many of which possess biological activities relevant for the pharmaceutical and chemical industries. Furthermore, there is an ever increasing demand for novel compounds, due to, among others, the growing drug tolerance and resistance in microorganisms and newly emerging diseases. In microorganisms, combinatorial biochemistry is a widely used tool to increase structural variation in several classes of (microbial) natural products. Despite the potential importance of plant secondary metabolites, only a limited fraction of these molecules is currently used, mostly due to their complex structure and the low production levels in planta. Metabolic engineering of plants has offered limited help because the molecular mechanisms <b>steering</b> <b>plant</b> secondary metabolism remain poorly characterized. Here, we used a functional genomics approach to identify candidate genes involved in the saponin biosynthesis of five different plants. After targeted metabolite profiling confirmed the induction of triterpene saponin biosynthesis by methyl jasmonate treatment, a genome-wide cDNA-AFLP transcript profiling was carried out for the five plants. Taking into account the putative functional annotation and the expression pattern of the visualized transcript tags, a set of 259 candidate genes potentially involved in saponin biosynthesis and its regulation were identified. The generated gene list {{provided the basis for}} a combinatorial biochemistry platform that targets triterpene saponins in plants. Proof of concept of combinatorial biochemistry was achieved by heterologous expression of the candidate saponin biosynthesis genes in M. truncatula hairy roots. Three of the generated transgenic hairy root lines were found to accumulate novel molecules, two of which were shown to be novel triterpene saponins, whereas the third line produced a set of novel, non-saponin compounds. Furthermore, the identified transcription factors and other regulators were lead candidates for studies investigating the control of the saponin biosynthesis in planta. This led to the identification of a RING membrane-anchor E 3 ubiquitin ligase, MAKIBISHI 1 (MKB 1), that targets 3 -hydroxy- 3 -methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR), the enzyme catalyzing the rate-limiting step in the mevalonate pathway, for ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation, thereby controlling saponin biosynthesis...|$|R
5000|$|Flapping wing {{propulsion}} {{devices are}} hydrofoils that generate propulsion by forcing a foil {{to move up}} and down in the water. The forward motion of the foil then generates lift as in other hydrofoils. A common design consists of a large foil at the stern that is used both for propulsion and keeping the passenger above the water, connected to a smaller foil at the <b>bow</b> used for <b>steering</b> and longitudinal stability. Riders operate the vehicle by bouncing up and down on a small platform at the stern, whilst holding onto a steering column.

Is our Great State still to have a majority of people glad to do commonplace work for mediocre wages, and will there be other individuals who will ride by on the roads, sympathetically, no doubt, but with a secret sense of superiority? So one opens the general problem of the organisation for labour.|$|R

Initially, {{the company was}} named Hyundai International Inc. and {{changed its name to}} Mando Machinery Corporation in February 1980. In 1988, Mando opened the Brake System Plant in Pyeongtaek and two years later, opened the Munmak <b>Steering</b> System <b>Plant</b> (currently renamed Wonju operations). By 1995, Mando Machinery had a suspension system plant in Iksan as well as a dedicated R&D center. Mando America Corporation (MAC) was founded in 1996.In 1999, during the financial crisis, Mando was sold to Sunsage and was promptly renamed as Mando Corporation. Halla Group repurchased Mando Corporation subsequently. As of 2013, Mando Corporation has six affiliated locations in the United States within Michigan, Alabama, and Georgia. Its headquarters is in Seoul, South Korea. Its affiliates have a 1300-employee presence in North and South America. It is projected that Mando's affiliates will employ roughly 2,400 employees in the United States alone by 2017. In the overall scope, Mando Corporation has corporate offices, research & development facilities, assembly lines, casting plants, and other various functions worldwide such as China, Turkey, Brazil, India, Japan, Sweden, Germany, Poland, Australia, and Malaysia. Worldwide, the manufacturer employs over 9,900 workers, and has more than an annual revenue of $6 billion. Mando Corporation provides highly advanced and quality brakes, suspension, and steering parts to General Motors, Volkswagen, Chrysler, Ford, Nissan, Hyundai, Kia, Suzuki, Chevrolet, and many other automobile manufacturers worldwide.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} works {{related to the}} effect of soil {{compaction}} on cereal yield and focuses on research of field experiments. The reasons for compaction formation are usually a combination of several types of interactions. Therefore one of the most researched topics all over the world is the changes in the soil’s physical and chemical properties to achieve sustainable cereal production conditions. Whether we are talking about soil bulk density, physical soil properties, water conductivity or electrical conductivity, or {{based on the results of}} measurements of on-line or point of soil sampling resistance testing, the fact is more and more information is at our disposal to find answers to the challenges. Thanks to precision plant production technologies (PA) these challenges can be overcome in a much more efficient way than earlier as instruments are available (geospatial technologies such as GIS, remote sensing, GPS with integrated sensors and <b>steering</b> systems; <b>plant</b> physiological models, such Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT), which includes models for cereals etc.). The tests were carried out first of all on alteration clay and sand content in loam, sandy loam and silt loam soils. In the study we examined especially the change in natural soil compaction conditions and its effect on cereal yields. Both the literature and our own investigations have shown that the soil moisture content changes have the opposite effect in natural compaction in clay and sand content related to cereal yield. These skills would contribute to the spreading of environmental, sustainable fertilizing devoid of nitrate leaching planning and cereal yield prediction within the framework of the PA to eliminate seasonal effects...|$|R

This control structure {{is based on}} a simplified linear model of the lateral dynamics of such cars and aims to decouple the control of sideslip from the control of yaw rate. The control design {{is based on a}} linear multivariable plant which incorporates the model of the lateral dynamics mentioned above and whose inputs are linear combinations of the front and rear <b>steering</b> angles. The <b>plant</b> also contains a cross-feedback element. The matrix transfer function of the resulting plant is upper-triangular (partially decoupled). The MIMO design problem can then be recast as two SISO design problems using channel decomposition according to the Individual Channel Design (ICD) paradigm. The proposed control structure has been applied to design sideslip and yaw rate controllers using a more accurate model of the lateral dynamics of 4 -wheel steering cars. This model incorporates the tyre force dynamics and the steering actuators. Simulations are used to illustrate the performance and robustness of the designed controllers...|$|R
40|$|Australia’s steel {{industry}} underwent a transformation {{starting in the}} 1980 s {{in response to an}} international collapse in demand and steeply heightened competition; such a crisis that it threatened the closure of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company’s iconic steelworks located at Newcastle on Australia’s eastern seaboard. Central to this transformation was the shift by the Broken Hill Proprietary Company from the firm’s highly confrontational approach to industrial relations to one that was far more collaborative. Gradual at first, the shift in participation with the steel unions accelerated so that by 1996 a joint management–union consultative committee – the Transition Steering Team – had been established at the Newcastle steelworks to facilitate a shift to electric arc furnace steelmaking. When the Broken Hill Proprietary Company announced in 1997 that it would exit all steelmaking at Newcastle and not proceed with the new furnace, the Transition Steering Team proved to be the key agency in the management of the steelworks’ closure.

To {{solve this problem}} and a specific methodology for pilotage of the pre-emption, and automation tools are being developed. Preliminary study ofpilotage technique and authomatic control algorythm demand a reliable mathematical model of aircraft dynamics at cargo item drop. Such model should take into account {{significant change in the}} position of the aircraft center of mass and aircraft inertia tensor. Simplified models were based on modeling the movement of the center of mass and rotation around the cen- ter of mass of the aircraft. Such models do {{not take into account the}} inertial forces and moments of moving a cargo item. This circumstance does not allow to obtain reliable results in the simulation. The article presents the description of the complete mathematical model of the movement of military transport aircraft in landing of a cargo item. Examines the com- plex material system of solids and a detailed description of the properties of its components. The equations of motion of the aircraft as a system carrier (aircraft without a cargo item) and wear (of moving a cargo item) bodies to reflect the changes in the inertia tensor. The functioning of the power <b>plant,</b> <b>steering</b> actuators, flight control system, an exhaust chute, the sen- sors of the primary information are taken into account.
