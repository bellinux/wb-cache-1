6000|$|... 'A knight--a {{knight in}} <b>bright</b> <b>steel,</b> and with three attendants,' said Lilias; 'one of Patrick's French comrades, say I, {{by the grace}} of his riding.' ...|$|E
60|$|No feint or thrust at first, only on guard, {{quietly on}} guard, and Bucephalus {{seemed to be}} {{infinitely}} multiplied at times so quickly did the <b>bright</b> <b>steel</b> flash out in the grey light and then subside again.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Bright</b> mild <b>steel</b> of {{thickness}} 0.0625 in (1.6 mm) - mean failing stress = 4,980 lbf/in2 (33.7 MPa, 3.50 kgf/mm2) ...|$|R
5000|$|Along {{with the}} renovations was the {{installation}} of a commissioned sculpture by Douglas Kornfeld called the [...] "Tree of Life", a 17' tall laser-cut <b>bright</b> red <b>steel</b> tree.|$|R
50|$|Premiere Specification {{includes}} ambient interior mood lighting, <b>bright</b> stainless <b>steel</b> external trim, flying 'B' radiator mascot, {{rear view}} camera, seat ventilation and massage function and a veneered iPod drawer.|$|R
6000|$|... "Powder {{and your}} auld hands are {{but as the}} snail to the swallow against the <b>bright</b> <b>steel</b> {{in the hands of}} Alan," [...] said the other. [...] "Before your jottering finger could find the trigger, the hilt would dirl on your breast-bane." ...|$|E
6000|$|As I sat musing by {{the frozen}} dyke, [...] There {{was a man}} marching with a <b>bright</b> <b>steel</b> pike, [...] Marching in the dayshine like a ghost came he, [...] And behind me was the moaning and the murmur [...] Of the sea.|$|E
6000|$|De la Fosse cried aloud at the sight. [...] "I have no sword. You {{would not}} murder me?" [...] said he, leaning back with haggard-face and burning eyes against his chair. The <b>bright</b> <b>steel</b> {{shone in the}} lamp-light. Edith shrank back, {{her hand over her}} face.|$|E
50|$|The revolver, {{somewhat}} {{unusual for}} the type of weapon, features a manual safety lever. It also features Pachmayr decelerator grips. The Thunder 5 comes in either matte or <b>bright</b> stainless <b>steel</b> finish and has fixed sights.|$|R
50|$|Stainless {{steel is}} used for all major parts of the pistol {{including}} the frame, slide and barrel. The pistol was offered in four models: the Survivor, Survivor Guardsman, Hunter and the Hunter Guardsman models. The Survivor models come in a <b>bright</b> stainless <b>steel,</b> high-luster finish while the Hunter models are available in a matte finish. The Guardsman models have squared-off trigger guards instead of the rounded trigger guards found on the non-Guardsman models.|$|R
60|$|There {{was a brief}} pause. During {{the last}} few minutes a certain tension had crept in between the two men. With it, their {{personal}} characteristics seemed to have become intensified. Dominey was more than ever the aristocrat; Seaman the plebian schemer, unabashed and desperately in earnest. He leaned presently a little way across the table. His eyes had narrowed but they were as <b>bright</b> as <b>steel.</b> His teeth were more prominent than usual.|$|R
60|$|A shudder {{ran over}} Joe's frame. Fascinated, {{he watched the}} guard. The Indian uttered a low gasp; his eyes started and glared wildly; he rose very slowly to his full height and stood waiting, listening. The dark hand which held the {{tomahawk}} trembled so that little glints of moonlight glanced from the <b>bright</b> <b>steel.</b>|$|E
60|$|There was but {{one thing}} to mention. A little after we had started, the sun shone upon a little moving clump of scarlet close in along the water-side to the north. It was {{much of the same}} red as soldiers' coats; every now and then, too, there came little sparks and lightnings, as though the sun had struck upon <b>bright</b> <b>steel.</b>|$|E
60|$|He {{lifted his}} hand. Makamuk swung the axe, a broadaxe for the {{squaring}} of logs. The <b>bright</b> <b>steel</b> flashed through the frosty air, {{poised for a}} perceptible instant above Makamuk’s head, then descended upon Subienkow’s bare neck. Clear through flesh and bone it cut its way, biting deeply into the log beneath. The amazed savages saw the head bounce a yard away from the blood-spouting trunk.|$|E
60|$|Above all, this man's head, well {{set upon}} his shoulders, claimed some attention. His nose was hooked and rather large, {{his eyes were}} blue, <b>bright</b> as <b>steel,</b> and set a trifle wide. Above a thin-lapped, {{delicate}} mouth his reddish mustachios, slightly streaked with grey, stood out, bristling like a cat's. His hair was darker--almost brown save at the temples, where age had faded it to an ashen colour. In general his aspect was one of rugged strength.|$|R
5000|$|Physically, he was {{considered}} a [...] "little man, scrupulously dressed, somewhat in the old fashion, scrupulously clean, with a fair, reddish face, light grey and scanty hair, mutton-chop whiskers, and the <b>brightest</b> of <b>steel</b> blue eyes, round and full. He was always cleanly shaved, and if a speck could be seen on his glancing shirt, be {{sure it was a}} speck of taddy from his snuff-box. He wore his old large watch in his fob, attached to a black silk ribbon, at which depended a large gold seal".|$|R
25|$|In 1980, the GT {{received}} a restyling. Outside there were new one-piece tail lights, grey plastic bumpers, C-pillar vents and side skirts; all <b>bright</b> stainless <b>steel</b> {{save for the}} Alfa Romeo triangular grille was changed to matte-black trim. The 1.6-litre version was discontinued and the Alfetta GTV became known simply as Alfa Romeo GTV2.0; the Alfetta name was dropped, but the two-litre coupé retained its type designation of 11636 for left-hand drive and 11637 for right-hand drive. 15-inch disc-shaped alloy wheels were now standard, {{as opposed to the}} earlier cars' 14-inch pressed steel or optional 14-inch alloy.|$|R
60|$|Back again came Mrs. Day {{with a box}} of <b>bright</b> <b>steel</b> horn-handled knives, {{silver-plated}} forks, carver, and all complete. These were wiped of the {{preservative oil}} which coated them, and then a knife and fork were laid down to each individual with a bang, the carving knife and fork thrust into the meat dish, and the old ones they had hitherto used tossed away.|$|E
60|$|A long-beaked, <b>bright</b> <b>steel</b> ninety-footer floated at ease for one instant within hail of us, her slings coiled {{ready for}} rescues, {{and a single}} hand in her open tower. He was smoking. Surrendered to the insurrection of the airs through which we tore our way, he lay in {{absolute}} peace. I saw the smoke of his pipe ascend untroubled ere his boat dropped, it seemed, like a stone in a well.|$|E
60|$|Weston fancied {{that this}} was probable, for the man was dexterous, and there was applause when he set the bright blade whirling, and passed the haft from hand to hand. Most of the loungers could do a good deal with the ax themselves, and the lean, muscular {{demonstrator}} made rather a striking figure as he stood poised in statuesque symmetry under the lamplight with the <b>bright</b> <b>steel</b> flashing about him.|$|E
50|$|Daugherty {{narrowly}} escaped death after surviving {{a mortar}} attack. He describes the surprise that other soldiers had at seeing him walking around afterwards with a <b>bright</b> shard of <b>steel</b> shrapnel, {{which he had}} received during the barrage, sticking out of his helmet, and which came within 1/4 of an inch (0.6 cm) from penetrating his skull.|$|R
50|$|The {{seamless}} ferrule {{made from}} carbon steel is aimed for <b>bright</b> and galvanized <b>steel</b> wire ropes. Using the same metals between rope and ferrule prevents electrolytic corrosion. They {{are intended for}} applications with high temperatures and/or abrasion, e.g. the steel melting and fishing industries. From size 8 and upwards they are fully traceable (ISO 9001) and marked with size and type.|$|R
6000|$|The {{intruder}} {{seemed about}} to speak, heard something, glanced swiftly at the door, and suddenly left Graham and ran towards it, shouting quick incoherent words. A <b>bright</b> wedge of <b>steel</b> flashed in his hand, and he began tap, tap, a quick succession of blows upon the hinges. [...] "Mind!" [...] cried a voice. [...] "Oh!" [...] The voice came from above.|$|R
60|$|And Baby? He had grown, it is true, {{a trifle}} larger; {{but he was}} thin, and bore the marks of evident ill usage. His {{beautiful}} coat was matted and unkempt; and his claws, those <b>bright</b> <b>steel</b> hooks, had been ruthlessly pared to the quick. His eyes were furtive and restless; and the old expression of stupid good humor had changed to one of intelligent distrust. His intercourse with mankind had evidently quickened his intellect, without broadening his moral nature.|$|E
60|$|The {{two young}} knights, so goodly in their <b>bright</b> <b>steel,</b> knelt for their mother's blessing, and then sprang like chamois down the ivy- twined steep, {{followed}} by their men, and were lost to sight among {{the bushes and}} rocks. Yet even while her frame quivered with fear, her heart swelled at the thought what a gulf there was between these days and those when she had hidden her face in despair, while Ermentrude watched the Debateable Ford.|$|E
60|$|Then, as the {{man walked}} up to it very quietly and unconcernedly, it seemed to hump itself {{together}} for a furious bound and rush with lowered head, {{and there was no}} sound in the great building until the <b>bright</b> <b>steel</b> flashed. Man's breast and gleaming horns seemed to meet, but apparently in the same second the gorgeously clad figure had stepped aside, and in the next the bull plunged forward and came down upon its knees.|$|E
60|$|At last, {{when the}} dance was over, {{she would not}} sit down, she walked away. He came with his arm round her, keeping her upon the {{movement}} of his walking. And she seemed to agree. She was bright {{as a piece of}} moonlight, as <b>bright</b> as a <b>steel</b> blade, he seemed to be clasping a blade that hurt him. Yet he would clasp her, if it killed him.|$|R
50|$|The JW&NW {{operated}} <b>bright</b> red heavy <b>steel</b> passenger interurban cars (including {{one with}} an observation platform) and interurban freight motors capable of pulling two or three freight cars. The NYC would set out cars on the Westfield interchange tracks {{to be taken to}} Jamestown, and the JW&NW would set out cars for the NYC to pick up. Jamestown had a significant furniture manufacturing industry. Wood and other materials necessary for furniture production went to Jamestown. Finished furniture went to Westfield to be picked up by the New York Central.|$|R
60|$|A {{man stood}} on the floor plates in the engine-room, with his face turned up towards the {{skylight}} {{as if he had}} been disturbed. Marston could not see him well, because the bars of the top platform were in the way, but the fellow carried a small, <b>bright</b> piece of <b>steel</b> and a ball of waste. It looked {{as if he had been}} cleaning a valve-spindle, and his working at night was significant. Marston's heart beat, but after a few moments the other seemed to be satisfied and sitting down on a locker picked up a file.|$|R
6000|$|... 1. [...] Whet the <b>bright</b> <b>steel,</b> [...] Sons of the White Dragon! [...] Kindle the torch, [...] Daughter of Hengist! [...] The steel glimmers not for {{the carving}} of the banquet, [...] It is hard, broad, and sharply pointed; [...] The torch goeth not to the bridal chamber, [...] It steams and glitters blue with sulphur. [...] Whet the steel, the raven croaks! [...] Light the torch, Zernebock is yelling! [...] Whet the steel, sons of the Dragon! [...] Kindle the torch, {{daughter}} of Hengist! ...|$|E
6000|$|Nay, nay, you {{are wrong}} there. It is just [...] "about the matter" [...] that he does know, and knows a great deal, and very accurately; what {{he does not know}} is the matter itself. He will tell you {{wonderful}} things about oxygen gas--how the air is full of it, the water full of it, every living thing full of it; how it changes hard <b>bright</b> <b>steel</b> into soft, foul rust; how a candle cannot burn without it, or you live without it. But what it is he knows not.|$|E
6000|$|Meanwhile Harry {{had pulled}} the table into {{the centre of}} the room, and {{arranged}} the necessary instruments at one end. The <b>bright</b> <b>steel</b> had a most charming and scientific appearance, which added greatly to the general effect. I saw myself already in imagination drawing up an elaborate report for the Royal Society, and delivering a Croonian Oration, with diagrams and sections complete, in illustration of the [...] "Vascular System of a Ghost." [...] But alas, it was not to be. A preliminary difficulty, slight in itself, yet enormous in its preventive effects, unhappily defeated our well-made plans.|$|E
2500|$|Circuit of the Americas {{features}} a [...] observation tower designed by Miró Rivera Architects and built by Patriot Erectors as a landmark for the venue. The {{structure of the}} tower consists of an elevator hoist-way surrounded by a double [...] helix staircase of 419 stairs, both of which lead to an observation platform [...] above ground level. The platform provides a 360-degree panorama of the circuit, as well as views to downtown Austin, Texas. The observation platform, which is accessible {{to the public for}} an admission fee, can accommodate up to 70 visitors and features glass railings and a partial glass floor. In addition, a [...] "veil" [...] consisting of 18 <b>bright</b> red <b>steel</b> tubes runs nearly the full height of the tower, acting as a canopy for both the observation platform and the stage below. The design of the observation tower was inspired by the visual imagery of sports cars and movement, and the red color was selected to mimic the streaks of lights trailing racecars at night.|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} a {{substrate}} bias and prenitride plasma etching on the nitriding response of four steel substrates is investigated in a two factor two level full factorial experimental design. The steels investigated were P 20 (M 200, plastic mould steel), H 13 (W 302, {{hot work tool steel}} - as received), 4140 (preheat treated nitriding steel) and 1020 (CS 1020, <b>bright</b> mild <b>steel).</b> The nitriding response was determined from surface and cross-sectional hardness measurements. Nitrogen depth profile measurements were obtained using glow discharge optical emission spectroscopy. Considering the main effects, the results show that without a worktable bias during the nitriding step there is effectively little or no nitriding response in most of the materials. The prenitride plasma etch did not produce a significant surface hardness response in all steels except H 13, where a prior etch substantially increased surface hardness and influenced the hardness depth profile. The bias also significantly increased the nitrogen wt-%. The plasma etch also influenced the near surface nitrogen wt-% concentrations, however the practical implications of this require further investigation...|$|R
