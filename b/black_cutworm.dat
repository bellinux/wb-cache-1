40|$|Most corn is {{planted in}} {{southern}} Iowa but {{much remains to}} be planted in the northern half of the state. For fields that have yet to be planted, the question of whether to use a preventive insecticide for <b>black</b> <b>cutworms</b> is valid. Below are several points to consider before purchasing and applying an insecticide solely for the prevention of <b>black</b> <b>cutworms...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Black</b> <b>cutworms</b> are {{now doing}} their damage. Rich Pope {{received}} {{a report of}} 5 - 25 percent cut plants in some Washington County fields. Jim Lafrenz, Pioneer sales agronomist, also reports a field with 16 percent cut plants in Scott County. Carroll Olsen, ISU Extension crop specialist, reports a field in Adams County with 85 percent cut plants, whereas Mark Carlton, ISU Extension crop specialist, reports a field in Marion County with a plant population reduced to 4, 000 because of <b>black</b> <b>cutworms...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Black</b> <b>cutworms</b> are an {{occasional}} pest of seedling corn {{that can cause}} major damage. A pheromone trap was placed at the research farm in 2009. The peak flight of six moths occurred on May 6 (Figure 1). The moth flights are used to anticipate when cutting from <b>black</b> <b>cutworms</b> would begin and therefore predict when scouting should begin. Based on this monitoring data and data from other locations in west central Iowa, the scouting date was May 24. This scouting date is four days later than 2008...|$|R
50|$|Agrotis ipsilon, the Dark sword-grass, or <b>black</b> <b>cutworm,</b> {{is a small}} noctuid moth found worldwide. The larvae are {{a serious}} {{agricultural}} pest and feed on nearly all varieties of vegetables and many important grains.|$|E
50|$|SmartStax seeds {{control a}} broad {{spectrum}} of pests which includes larvae of above-ground insects such as European corn borer, <b>black</b> <b>cutworm,</b> southwestern corn borer, corn earworm, fall armyworm, western bean cutworm, and below-ground feeding larvae of western corn rootworm and northern corn rootworm.|$|E
5000|$|Meteorus leviventris is {{a species}} of wasp in the Braconidae family which is a {{parasite}} of significant crop pests including Agrotis ipsilon, the <b>black</b> <b>cutworm.</b> The wasps {{have been shown to}} be easily collected through the use of traps baited with mustard oils. [...] They have been shown to carry Rioviridae RNA viruses, one of only a few parasitoids to carry them.|$|E
40|$|The list of {{caterpillars}} defoliating soybean in Iowa {{continues to}} lengthen. Both <b>black</b> <b>cutworms</b> and variegated cutworms have cut soybean fields throughout the state. <b>Black</b> <b>cutworms</b> in soybean {{have become more}} common in the past 3 years, but variegated cutworms in soybean were totally unexpected. Variegated cutworms may have one or two more generations this year but soybean should grow out of the stage in which plants are susceptible to cutting. Defoliating caterpillars should be the primary concern {{for the remainder of the}} growing season...|$|R
40|$|<b>Black</b> <b>cutworms</b> are {{occasional}} pests of seedling corn in Iowa. Larvae {{can easily}} cut corn through the V 4, and sometimes, the V 5 stages of growth. Adult moths prefer to {{lay their eggs}} in soybean stubble rather than corn stubble, and they are more attracted to fields with winter annual weeds and low-lying wet fields. Prevention of cutting and stand loss from <b>black</b> <b>cutworms</b> is a goal of many corn farmers. A neonicotinoid insecticide applied to the corn seed prior to planting offers the promise of early-season insect control from this and other insects...|$|R
40|$|Each spring, {{seedling}} corn is {{attacked by}} a variety of caterpillars. Insect identification {{is the first step in}} determining whether there is a potential problem. Two of the most commonly confused insects are <b>black</b> <b>cutworms</b> and dingy <b>cutworms.</b> <b>Black</b> <b>cutworms</b> are less than 0. 5 inch in length and feed on leaves, whereas larger larvae can cut or drill plants. Blacks cause almost all cutworm damage to corn. Cutting can occur below the surface when soil is dry, or above ground, when soil is wet and tight around the plant...|$|R
50|$|Each larva can consume over 400 square {{centimetres}} {{of foliage}} during its development. They feed above ground until about the fourth instar. After {{that they do}} considerable damage to crops by severing young plants at ground level. In the midwestern USA the <b>black</b> <b>cutworm</b> {{is considered to be}} a serious pest of corn which is very susceptible at the one-leaf stage but by the 4 or 5-leaf stage it is relatively unaffected. Damage to the underground parts of plants can also be harmful. Other crops where serious damage occurs include cotton, maize, tobacco, sunflower, tomatoes, sugar beet and potato.|$|E
40|$|<b>Black</b> <b>cutworm</b> is a pest of corn in Iowa, {{occasionally}} causing economic loss. Cooperators around Iowa assist Iowa State University integrated {{pest management}} staff in determining when <b>black</b> <b>cutworm</b> adults arrive from overwintering sites near the Gulf Coast. A network of pheromone traps shows that two major <b>black</b> <b>cutworm</b> flights occurred in Iowa this spring, the first on April 14 and the second on April 18 - 20. Both flights were reported across the entire state. Trap data {{provide us with a}} key first step in <b>black</b> <b>cutworm</b> management because it lets us know when the moths arrive and females lay eggs. We then track degree day accumulations to calculate when <b>black</b> <b>cutworm</b> larvae will reach a size that they can start cutting corn...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability of}} Steinernema carpocapsae to reduce damage to {{seedling}} corn by the <b>black</b> <b>cutworm,</b> Agrotis ipsilon, in soil amended with three fertilizers (fresh cow manure, composted manure, and urea) was determined. Total nitrogen was standardized among the fertilizers at 280 kg/ha and 560 kg/ha. <b>Black</b> <b>cutworm</b> damage {{was assessed by}} the percentage of cut corn plants in small field plots. Relative to a control (no nematodes), nematode applications resulted in reduced <b>black</b> <b>cutworm</b> damage in all treatments except in the higher rate of fresh manure. <b>Black</b> <b>cutworm</b> damage in nematodetreated plots was greater in plots with fresh manure than in plots without fertilizer.

40|$|Armyworms {{have been}} {{reported}} by Jim Jensen, extension field specialist-crops, defoliating a field of young corn in Lee County. These insects rarely causes losses in conventional-tilled fields, {{but they should be}} scouted for in minimum- or no-tilled fields with any kind of living ground cover. The moths migrate from the southern United States, similar to <b>black</b> <b>cutworms,</b> and are attracted to fields that were planted into a cover crop such as rye, or where grassy weeds exist...|$|R
40|$|<b>Black</b> <b>cutworm</b> moths {{continue}} to arrive. • Fields {{yet to be}} worked and planted are those of greatest risk to <b>black</b> <b>cutworm</b> damage. • Seed/soil insecticides will provide suppression of this pest, NOT control of heavy populations. Storm fronts {{over the last couple}} weeks have blown significant numbers of <b>black</b> <b>cutworm</b> moths into Indiana. The timing of intensive moth captures (9 or more moths caught over a 2 -night period) and subsequent larval development may be a problem for corn yet to be planted. Refer to the following map, where we are tracking <b>black</b> <b>cutworm</b> development from the time of an intensive capture to when we expect first cutting/damage. Based on the growth development model, it takes approximately 300 heat units (50 ˚F base) from egg hatch to early 4 th instar; this is the life stage when <b>black</b> <b>cutworm</b> larvae begin to cut plants. Some leaf injury may be present before then. Using pheromone trapping of moths and tracking of heat unit accumulations for first cutting is not an exact science, but they do give us a good indication of what to expect. It is not possible to predict if individual fields will be infested...|$|E

40|$|Mark Carlton, {{extension}} crop specialist, and I found a {{field in}} Marion County on May 16 that had variegated cutworms feeding on young corn plants. The variegated cutworms were feeding on the leaves, chewing both circular holes and eating along the leaf margin.

40|$|Now {{that most}} corn is past {{the stage of}} being injured by early-season pests such as wireworms, white grubs, and <b>black</b> <b>cutworms,</b> our {{attention}} needs to turn to mid-season insects. It is estimated that 30 percent of the corn acres will be planted to Bt corn this year, and in those acres, European corn borer injury will be almost nonexistent.

40|$|More {{and more}} corn {{producers}} will be planting hybrids this spring with an insecticide applied {{directly to the}} seed. These seed treatments belong to a class of insecticides known as the neonicotinoids and depending on the rate, they offer the promise of control of seedcorn maggots, wireworms, white grubs, <b>black</b> <b>cutworms,</b> and even corn rootworms. Prevention of cutting and stand loss from soil-dwelling pests is a goal of many corn producers. The seed treatments, such as Cruiser®, Gaucho®, and Poncho®, are systemic in action, meaning that the chemical is absorbed from the seed coat by the growing seedling and transported to the more actively growing sections of the plant, i. e., new leaves and roots...|$|R
40|$|<b>Black</b> <b>cutworms</b> {{are usually}} {{associated}} with damage to corn. But this year, cutworms are causing significant stand loss in some soybean fields throughout central and southern Iowa.

40|$|The {{flight of}} <b>black</b> <b>cutworm</b> into central Iowa continues. A light trap in Ames caught {{substantial}} numbers of moths on consecutive nights during May 17 - 20. These trap catches suggest that egg laying may still be occurring in corn in central Iowa, and perhaps {{other areas of the}} state as well. Therefore, all corn should be scouted for <b>black</b> <b>cutworm</b> injury when the plants emerge. This recommendation includes corn that emerges in late May and early June...|$|E

50|$|The female lays {{batches of}} between twenty and ninety eggs. These are {{barrel-shaped}} {{and have a}} number of small projections {{at the edge of the}} operculum. The nymphs go through five instars in their growth process and have bluish-black heads and thoraxes and red abdomens. The first instars stay close to the egg mass and the later instars also tend to group together, sometimes feeding on a common prey item. In the laboratory, the nymphs have fed on larvae of the greater wax moth (Galleria mellonella), several stages of the Mexican bean beetle (Epilachna varivestis), larvae of tobacco budworm (Heliothis virescens) and larvae of <b>black</b> <b>cutworms</b> (Agrotis ipsilon). Other recorded prey include beetles, planthoppers, weevils, larvae of the long-tailed skipper (Urbanus proteus), and the southern green stink bug (Nezara viridula). The insects have been found on a range of plant types including ornamental plants, citrus, weeds, grasses, trees, bushes and other habitats.|$|R
40|$|Omnivorous predators {{that feed}} on prey and plant {{resources}} {{are recognized as}} {{an important component of}} food webs but their impact on herbivore populations and trophic dynamics is unpredictable. Feeding on food items from multiple trophic levels increases the reticulate nature of food webs and the labile role of omnivores in promoting trophic cascades. Using carabid beetles in a corn agroecosystem, this research explored the interactive effects of predator guild (omnivore or carnivore) and the trophic origin of alternative food resources (seeds or fly pupae) on the control of herbivores (<b>black</b> <b>cutworms)</b> and plant survival. I demonstrated that the trophic guild and feeding performance of carabids can be predicted from their mandibular morphology. Carnivorous carabids, using mandibles with sharp points and a long shearing edge, kill and consume caterpillars more efficiently than omnivores that have mandibles with wide molar areas adapted for consuming prey and seeds. Omnivore preference for seeds and pupae further reduced their consumption of cutworms, which resulted in increased plant damage, ultimately dampening trophic cascades...|$|R
40|$|A {{research}} {{pest management}} scouting program {{was conducted in}} three counties in Iowa from 1979 through 1982. Wireworms were not found in damaging numbers in any scouted fields and, therefore, were considered a rare pest. <b>Black</b> <b>cutworms</b> were an occasional pest and were much more severe in some years than in others. European corn borers were almost always present, but seldom reached damaging levels. The corn rootworms were severe pests because they almost always reached densities that were considered potentially damaging;Two types of sequential sampling plans were devised for corn rootworm adults to make sampling for that pest more efficient. Waters 2 ̆ 7 method of sequential sampling classifies the population into a category and is useful for pest management decision making.
