5|$|Born into a {{blue collar}} Irish-American family in upstate New York, LeHand studied {{secretarial}} science in high school, took {{a series of}} clerical jobs, and eventually began {{to work for the}} Franklin Roosevelt vice presidential campaign in New York. Following the Democrats' defeat, FDR's wife Eleanor invited her to join the family at their home in Hyde Park, New York to clean up the campaign correspondence. FDR subsequently hired LeHand to work for him on Wall Street, where he was the partner in a law firm and also worked for a <b>bonding</b> <b>company.</b> After FDR was partially paralyzed in August 1921, LeHand became his daily companion and one of the main people to encourage him to return to politics, along with Eleanor and his political strategist, Louis McHenry Howe. She remained his secretary when he became Governor of New York in 1929 and when he became president in 1933, serving until a 1941 stroke left her partially paralyzed and barely able to speak. She moved to her sister's home in Somerville, Massachusetts and died after another stroke in 1944.|$|E
25|$|On October 2, 2006, Blumenthal {{launched}} an investigation concerning a botched reconstruction {{project of the}} Interstate 84 in Waterbury and Cheshire. The original contractor for the job, L.G. DeFelice, {{went out of business}} and it was later revealed that hundreds of storm drains had been improperly installed. Blumenthal subsequently announced lawsuits against L.G. DeFelice and the Maguire Group, the engineering firm that inspected the project. United States Fidelity & Guaranty, the insurer behind the performance bond for the Interstate-84 construction, agreed to pay $17.5 million to settle the claims. Under the terms of the agreement, the state of Connecticut retained the right to sue L.G. DeFelice for additional funds. In 2009, the <b>bonding</b> <b>company</b> agreed to pay an additional $4.6 million settlement, bringing the total award to $22.1 million ($30,000 more than the repair costs).|$|E

50|$|The {{idea for}} a bridge in this {{location}} was first brought up in 1993 as a road bridge. The location was later revisited as the location for a light rail crossing for the O-Train, but that extension plan was cancelled. In 2010, the city, provincial, and national governments invested equal amounts totalling $48 million in building the bridge. The original contractor hired, ConCreate USL, went into receivership when the project was about 60% complete and the <b>bonding</b> <b>company,</b> GCNA hired a new contractor, formed by former employees of Concreate, now known as Horseshoe Hill Construction, to complete its bonded work. The project was initially {{expected to be completed}} in 2012. However, due to the contractor going bankrupt and the city's <b>bonding</b> <b>company</b> refusing to accelerate work, the completion date was delayed.

5000|$|Mercenaries in {{this setting}} are unique, because there is an {{international}} Mercenaries’ Guild, {{and part of the}} Code of the Mercenaries’ Guild is that both parties must follow a contract to the letter - if the person doing the hiring violates the contract, he or she is fined by the Guild, and cannot hire a <b>bonded</b> <b>Company</b> for a period of at least one year. If the hired Company violates the contract, the Guild takes it out of their hide and out of the bond they were paid by their employer, for the violation of contracted. Additionally, if a <b>bonded</b> <b>Company</b> or a <b>bonded</b> individual hired in a war surrenders, they are allowed to leave the zone of battle unmolested and report to a neutral zone, where they will “get ransomed,” by the Guild (meaning saved in some context), and this is stated as the reason that a bonded Mercenary (one who actually has a membership with the Mercenaries’ Guild) pays their dues. Additionally, as part of the Code, a <b>bonded</b> <b>Company</b> will not fight for a suicide cause, will not switch sides midway through a conflict, will not follow a mutiny against their employer, and will do all in their power to ensure safe extraction for that employer, if things “go south.” For this reason, <b>bonded</b> <b>Companies</b> are more expensive to hire than either a free-lance Company or spontaneously assembled <b>Company,</b> because <b>bonded</b> <b>Companies</b> are of a correspondingly higher caliber.|$|R
