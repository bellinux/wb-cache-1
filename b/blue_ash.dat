25|$|In 1925, the Grisard Company {{dissolved}} {{and moved}} its hangars {{and equipment to}} Lunken Field, then considered a more desirable location for its proximity to downtown Cincinnati.

After a year at Lunken, he returned to <b>Blue</b> <b>Ash</b> and built his own facility on the northern edge of the property, along Glendale Milford Road.

25|$|<b>Blue</b> <b>Ash</b> Airport's history {{began in}} 1921 with a dirt runway located off Cooper Road, in then-unincorporated Sycamore Township, on land {{that has since}} been {{converted}} into an industrial park. The first Cincinnati–Chicago airmail flight took off from this field. On August 5, 1922, it was dedicated as Grisard Field, after Cincinnati-area pilot Lt. John K. Grisard, who was shot down in France during World War I. The following year, the Grisard Field Company leased the field to Maj. Hugh Watson, a barnstormer and former Army flight instructor, and his brother Parks. They were joined by John Paul Riddle and, in 1924, T. Higbee Embry. The company owned two Curtiss JN-4 biplanes. In its early days, the airfield's grass runways served general aviation, airmail operations, and the 359th Army Reserve Observation Squadron.|$|E

500|$|Green ash {{and black}} ash trees are {{preferred}} by emerald ash borer.

It primarily spreads through flight or by transportation of ash bark containing products such as firewood or nursery stock, which allows it to reach new areas and create satellite populations outside of the main infestation.|$|E

500|$|Competition from interurbans, {{specifically}} the Cincinnati-Lebanon Interurban Railway and Terminal Company, took away passengers from the CL beginning in 1903. But the interurban began to decline, {{going out of}} business in 1922, and it was motor vehicles that would kill the CL's passenger service. The first line to go was the Middletown Branch, discontinued in 1917; the short branch to Montgomery became freight-only in 1926. All service north of Lebanon ended in 1928, and in 1931 only one mixed train between Court Street and Lebanon was left on the schedule. The less-convenient Cincinnati Union Terminal replaced Court Street in 1933, as agreed upon by all railroads participating in its construction. CL trains reached the station via trackage rights on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (ex-M) south of East Norwood. This was never popular among CL riders, and the last scheduled passenger train on the former CL ran on January 31, 1934. With passenger service gone, and several cross-connections to other Pennsylvania lines, the CL was no longer needed as a through route. Several years after the Montgomery Branch was fully abandoned in 1933, the Pennsylvania discontinued freight service between <b>Blue</b> <b>Ash</b> and Mason and between Lebanon and Lytle; trains continued to reach Lebanon via the Little Miami Railroad and Middletown Branch. Service was resumed on the entire line during World War II, but the Lebanon-Lytle segment was torn up in 1952. After the Pennsylvania merged into Penn Central in 1968, a [...] piece north from Brecon was again abandoned, as was the short piece of the Middletown Branch east of the main line at Hageman, with Lebanon service now coming from the ex-New York Central at Middletown. The line through the Deer Creek Valley into Court Street was also abandoned, and the old freight depot was torn down in 1975.|$|E
500|$|The newly {{organized}} CL initially {{operated a}} main line from Court Street in Cincinnati to Dayton, leasing the track from Dodds to Lebanon Junction from the Cincinnati Division trustees, and trackage rights over the Dayton and Ironton Railroad (the old [...] narrow gauge D line) into Dayton. But {{the latter was}} converted to [...] in April 1887, and CL service was cut back to Dodds, since the operations north of there were unprofitable {{even when it was}} able to reach Dayton. (The line from Lebanon to Dodds was leased in 1892 to the company organized to operate north of Dodds.) Avondale Branch operations were discontinued in August 1889, due to competition from the cheaper Mt. Auburn Cable Railway. Under Hafer's leadership, new passenger and freight depots opened {{on the north side of}} Court Street in December 1885. In preparation for conversion to standard gauge, the CL relaid rail and replaced bridges, including a straight trestle in the Deer Creek Valley, completed in January 1889, in place of a curving old narrow gauge structure. The first standard gauge rails were laid by August 1889 as part of a dual gauge setup south of Idlewild, when the Ohio and North Western Railroad (O, successor to the C), which had converted its line to standard gauge, moved its trains from the Little Miami Railroad (Pennsylvania Railroad system) back to the CL Several months later, a third rail was laid north to East Norwood, allowing the O to connect with the Baltimore and Ohio Southwestern Railroad (successor to the M). After undertaking more improvements to the alignment, the company completed the conversion of the main line to Lebanon to standard gauge on September 16, 1894, although, until it acquired a full set of standard gauge equipment, much of the commuter service to <b>Blue</b> <b>Ash</b> continued to use the narrow gauge tracks.|$|E
500|$|When the Consolidated Rail Corporation (Conrail) {{acquired}} {{the assets of}} the bankrupt Penn Central in 1976, it was allowed to choose which lines to keep and which to abandon. The line between Avondale and Brecon still saw heavy freight traffic, and there would still be a reasonable amount of traffic to Mason and Hempstead. Thus Conrail bought about half of the ex-CL, including the main line from Cincinnati to Brecon (<b>Blue</b> <b>Ash</b> Secondary Track), Mason to Hageman (Mason Secondary Track), Hempstead to Pasadena (Kettering Running Track), and Patterson Road to Dayton (DP Industrial Track), as well as Middletown to Hageman (Middletown Secondary) and Hempstead to Clement (Clement Running Track). Ownership of the remaining lines—Brecon to Mason, Hageman to Lebanon, Lytle to Hempstead, Pasadena to Patterson Road, and Hageman to Middletown Junction—remained with the Penn Central trustees, although, with local funding, Conrail operated the two segments from Hageman to Lebanon and Centerville to Hempstead as [...] "light density lines". Tracks between Lytle and Centerville were torn up in 1979. Since then, several more segments have been abandoned, including Avondale to McCullough and Centerville to Kettering. Short line Indiana and Ohio Railway (IORY) acquired most of the remainder in the 1980s, beginning operations from Monroe (near Middletown) to Mason and Lebanon in March 1985, and McCullough to Brecon in December 1986. The city of Lebanon has bought the Hageman-Lebanon segment, initially owned by the Penn Central trustees, and the Southwest Ohio Regional Transit Authority {{acquired the}} property between McCullough and Brecon in 1997 for a proposed public transit line. (IORY continues to operate freight on both of these segments.) The IORY began running tourist trains on the Lebanon segment in 1985. The passenger operations were split in 1996, going through several renamings to Turtle Creek Valley Railway, Turtle Creek and Lebanon Railway, and finally Lebanon Mason Monroe Railroad. Three short segments of line at Middletown and Dayton remained with Conrail until its 1999 breakup, when the Norfolk Southern Railway acquired Conrail's assets in southwestern Ohio.|$|E
