25|$|Burnet, {{aided by}} Close, was {{successful}} in 1959, when Yorkshire at last won the county championship. At {{the end of that}} season, as Close later heard, Burnet was told that, having just won the championship, he could have another season as captain, <b>but,</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> Close would then take over. If Burnet resigned immediately, Vic Wilson could take over as captain in preference to Close. Burnet chose to step down straight-away. Once Wilson took over, with Close as the senior professional Yorkshire enjoyed a period of almost unbroken success, winning the county championship again in 1960, taking second place in 1961, and winning again in 1962.|$|E
25|$|Following Sitriuc's death, Amlaíb {{may have}} become king in York for a short time, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> it {{came to an end}} when Æthelstan took over the kingdom of Northumbria and {{defeated}} Sitriuc's brother Gofraid. According to William of Malmesbury, Amlaíb fled to Ireland while his uncle Gofraid made a second unsuccessful attempt to gain control of York. In 937 an attack on Æthelstan's kingdom by Gofraid's son Amlaíb, assisted by Constantín mac Áeda, the king of Alba, and Owen, the king of Strathclyde, ended in defeat at the battle of Brunanburh. William of Malmesbury wrote that Amlaíb was present at Brunanburh and spied out the English camp the night before the battle disguised as a skald.|$|E
25|$|Langdale {{called in}} his {{advanced}} parties, {{perhaps with a}} view to resuming the duties of advanced guard, on the night of 13 August, and collected them near Longridge. It is not clear whether he reported Cromwell's advance, <b>but,</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> Hamilton ignored the report, for on 17 August Monro was half a day's march to the north, Langdale east of Preston, and the main army strung out on the Wigan road, Major-General William Baillie with a body of foot, the rear of the column, being still in Preston. Hamilton, yielding to the importunity of his lieutenant-general, James Livingston, 1st Earl of Callendar, sent Baillie across the Ribble to follow the main body just as Langdale, with 3,000 foot and 500 horse only, met the first shock of Cromwell's attack on Preston Moor. Hamilton, like Charles at Edgehill, passively shared in, without directing, the Battle of Preston, and, though Langdale's men fought fiercely, they were driven to the Ribble after four hours' struggle.|$|E

500|$|Although he {{had more}} {{knowledge}} of the project than anyone else from Britain, Chadwick had no access to the Hanford site. Lord Portal was offered a tour of Hanford in 1946. [...] "This was the only plant to which Chadwick had been denied access in wartime, and now he asked Groves if he could accompany Portal. Groves replied that he could, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> then 'Portal will not see very much'." [...] For his efforts, Chadwick received a knighthood in the New Year Honours on 1 January 1945. He considered {{this to be a}} recognition of the work of the whole Tube Alloys project.|$|E
500|$|At {{the start}} of the 2009–10 season, Queens Park Rangers had a £1 million {{rejected}} for Hooper. Coventry City were also rumoured to be interested in the striker. On 15 August, Hooper scored twice in a 3–2 win over Derby County. Scunthorpe manager Nigel Adkins said that he thought Hooper was a [...] "massive threat" [...] to the opposition and that he was worried that other teams would try to sign him {{before the end of the}} transfer window. On 22 February, captain Cliff Byrne, described Hooper as the kind of striker who could [...] "create something out of nothing". He also stated that he hoped Hooper would stay at the club <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> leave it would be for a lot of money. This was just after Hooper had scored in a 2–2 draw with Watford, taking his seasonal tally to 13. He scored a hat-trick against Bristol City on his return from a groin injury on 17 April 2010, and added a further two goals at Doncaster Rovers a week later. He scored 20 goals in 39 appearances in all competitions in the 2009–10 season, including 19 in 35 in the league, where he finished as third-top goal scorer behind Peter Whittingham and Nicky Maynard who both scored 20.|$|E
500|$|Jennings {{offered to}} record [...] "Willy the Wandering Gypsy and Me" [...] and told Shaver to sing another song – if Jennings liked it he would record it and Shaver could sing another; <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not like it, Shaver {{would have to}} leave. Shaver sang [...] "Ain't No God in Mexico", {{followed}} by [...] "Honky Tonk Heroes" [...] and [...] "Old Five and Dimers and Me". [...] Jennings was so taken with Shaver's tunes that he decided he would record an album consisting solely of the Texan's songs. [...] RCA producer Chet Atkins was reluctant to record the material of an unknown writer, but since he had creative control, Jennings decided to record the album anyway, although the executives of RCA Records delayed its release. [...] Jennings was also spending more of his time at Tompall Glaser's [...] "Hillbilly Central" [...] studio at 916 Nineteenth Avenue South in Nashville, attracted by the laid back, communal atmosphere that was the antitheses of the traditional setup that Jennings had endured at RCA since 1966. [...] Jennings brought Glaser back with him to RCA Victor Studios to co-produce Honky Tonk Heroes. [...] "Tompall and I were best friends," [...] Jennings reminisced in the audio version of his autobiography Waylon. [...] "We met at {{about the time he}} broke up with his brothers, and I kind of took their place in his life." [...] Jennings and Shaver worked on the songs for several weeks, with [...] Shaver believing that Jennings was not closely following the phrasing of the tunes, and in some cases he played the songs repeatedly so that Jennings would understand them. [...] The title cut was especially problematic, with Jennings and Shaver - both temperamental personalities - clashing over the arrangement. [...] In Michael Striessguth's book Outlaw: Waylon, Willie, Kris, and the Renegades of Nashville, Jennings drummer Richie Albright recalls: ...|$|E

500|$|With the {{relative}} liberalization during the 1960s, which followed {{the rise of}} Nicolae Ceaușescu as communist leader, Caragiale's work enjoyed a more favorable reception. At that stage, nationalism and national communism became standards of official discourse, and intellectuals such as Edgar Papu were allowed to reinterpret Romanian culture {{on the basis of}} nationalist tenets: Papu's controversial theory, known as [...] "Protochronism", claimed that Romanians as a group were at the source of any innovative movement in world culture. Papu thus believed that Caragiale, whom he described as superior to Flaubert, had foreshadowed Lampedusa's writing techniques. Independent of this approach, Mateiu Caragiale was being rediscovered by new generations of writers. In 1966, Viața Românească published Radu Albala's În deal, pe Militari ("On the Hill, in Militari"), which was a sequel and final chapter of Sub pecetea tainei. Albala was significantly influenced by Caragiale throughout his work, as was his contemporary Alexandru George in his series of fiction writings. Other such authors are Fănuș Neagu, who was inspired by Craii... to write his 1976 book The Handsome Lunatics of the Big Cities, and Virgiliu Stoenescu, whose poetry, according to Barbu Cioculescu, was influenced by [...] "the charm of word appositions" [...] in Caragiale's poems. Caragiale's name was also cited by the writer Geo Bogza, who, in his youth, was a major figure of the Romanian avant-garde movement. In one of his late prose pieces, titled Ogarii, [...] "The Borzois", Bogza, who praised the dog breed for its innate grace, wrote: [...] "I do not know if Mateiu Caragiale, who thought himself so uncommon, ever owned borzois. <b>But,</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> I'm sure he gazed on them with melancholy and with secret envy." ...|$|E

If Talhah joined the committee within this period, he was {{to take part in the}} deliberations, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not return to Medina within this period, the other members of the committee could proceed with the decision. Abdur Rahman bin Awf withdrew his eligibility to be appointed as caliph in order to act as a moderator and began his task by interviewing every member of the committee separately. He asked them for whom they would cast their vote. When Ali was asked, he didn't reply. When Uthman was asked, he voted for Ali, Zubayr said for Ali or Uthman and Saad said for Uthman.|$|E
