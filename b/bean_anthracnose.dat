40|$|NYS IPM Type: Vegetables IPM Fact SheetBean anthracnose, {{caused by}} the fungus Colletotrichum lindemuthianum, is a major disease of beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), causing serious crop loss {{in many parts of}} the world. In 1921, M. F. Barrus of Cornell University {{demonstrated}} that <b>bean</b> <b>anthracnose</b> is seedborne. This information resulted in the widespread use of anthracnose-free seed and a subsequent decline in the occurrence of <b>bean</b> <b>anthracnose</b> in the United States. In bean-growing areas that receive frequent rainfall, however, such as central and western New York State, epidemics of the disease may develop. Production is reduced because of poor seed germination, poor seedling vigor, and low yields. Marketing losses are attributed to seed spots and blemishes, which lower their quality rating and salability. The disease is most common and severe on dry and snap beans (P. vulgaris) but may also affect lima bean (P. lunatus L.), scarlet runner bean (P. multiflorus Willd.), mung bean (P. aureus Roxb.), cowpea (Vigna sinensis Savi), and broad bean (Vicia faba L.) ...|$|E

In addition to molecular markers, both maps include map locations of defense genes and phenotypic traits for disease and insect resistance, seed size, color and storage proteins, pod color and those traits associated with the domestication syndrome in bean. Since the bean and cowpea maps were developed independently, LGs with the same number probably refer to non-syntenic groups.

The aim {{of the study was to}} advance understanding of genotype-phenotype-environmental interactions in Colletotrichum spp. through biomolecular approaches including multilocus molecular phylogenetic analysis, AP-PCR and morphological diversity assessment. Following initial screening five loci were selected for further investigation including ribosomal RNA gene block internal transcribed spacer (ITS), tubulin (TUB), glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase, glutamine synthetase, and the mating type gene. Study included 18 Colletotrichum isolates representing wide biogeographic diversity. Two isolates were identified as C. gloeosporioides and C. truncatum, which are not commonly known bean pathogens and this needs further research. The TUB marker was the most conserved amongst the C. lindemuthianum isolates. Universal marker ITS distinguished 5 haplotypes; concatenated sequence data provided the highest resolution with 7 haplotypes. AP-PCR differentiated between 5 - 9 haplotypes and appeared more suitable for local population monitoring purposes.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{common bean}} (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) crop is {{affected}} by more than 200 diseases, capable to narrow the production and decrease the product quality physiological, nutritional and commercial, including anthracnose. The <b>bean</b> <b>anthracnose,</b> caused by the fungus Colletotrichum lindemuthianum (Sacc. 2 ̆ 6 Magnus), {{is one of the}} most serious bean diseases, affecting susceptible cultivars worldwide (Bianchini et al., 1989).

Thus, the research objective was evaluating the severity and the <b>bean</b> <b>anthracnose</b> control under different levels of potassium. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The experiment was conducted in greenhouse with 5 liter pots in the Imperatriz city, in the Maranhão state, Brazil. Three common bean genotypes were used, being the Pérola cultivar (susceptible to anthracnose), BRS Estilo cultivar (moderately resistant to anthracnose) and BRS Madrepérola cultivar (resistant to anthracnose), in a completely randomized design with five treatments (0, 80, 120, 140 And 180 kg. ha- 1 as potassium chloride) and 4 replicates. The inoculation was done with a manual sprayer at the end V 4 stage at 35 days after emergence, with a 1. 2 x 106 conidia. mL- 1 inoculum suspension. Severity assessments were made at 9 and 15 days after inoculation (DAI) according to the descriptive diagram scale proposed by Tamayo (1995), which ranges from 1 to 9 and the closer to 1 the lower the severity.

Azocyclotin foi avaliado à dose de 125 g i. a. 100 L- 1 de água e trifenil hidróxido de estanho a 41, 25 g i. a. 100 L- 1. Os delineamentos experimentais foram inteiramente ao acaso, com cinco repetições. Em condições de campo, foi realizado um experimento com seis tratamentos. Os tratamentos e as doses em g ha- 1 de i. a foram: 1) tebuconazole + trifenil hidróxido de estanho (100 + 200); 2) tebuconazole + trifloxystrobin (40 + 100); 3) trifloxystrobin (125); 4) tebuconazole + azocyclotin (100 + 500); 5) azocyclotin (500) e 6) testemunha. O delineamento foi em blocos ao acaso, com quatro repetições. Para a avaliação in vitro foram medidos diâmetros ortogonais do crescimento micelial do fungo em BDA; in vivo e no campo usou-se escala de notas de 1 a 9, sendo 1 = sem sintoma e 9 = igual ou mais de 25 % de área foliar afetada. In vitro, o tratamento 7 proporcionou maior inibição do desenvolvimento micelial. Em plântulas, observou-se controle de C. lindemuthianum até 144 horas, pelos dois produtos. Uma nova constatação em campo foi o controle de antracnose pelo acaricida azocyclotin, em que se observou também efeito sobre mancha-angular e mancha-de-alternária.

40|$|The {{objectives}} of studies undertaken here were {{to identify the}} species of Colletotrichum associated with coffee berry anthracnose in PNG, {{gain an understanding of}} the infection process and factors affecting it, assess the impact, if any, of anthracnose on coffee quality and identify suitable chemicals for anthracnose control. A total of 40 isolates were collected from PNG and their cultural and morphological characteristics on PDA were studied and used to identify the species. Species identification was further confirmed by molecular characterisation using RFLP and DNA sequencing of the ITS region of the rDNA. After species identification only two isolates were selected to represent C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum for further studies. Studies on conidia germination and the effects of conidia concentration, temperature, relative humidity and pH affecting germination were done on TWA, followed by studies on the infection process on coffee berries and the influence of temperature on germination and appressoria formation in vivo. For assessment of effect of anthracnose on coffee quality, 100 samples of ripe berries were assessed for disease incidence, followed by processing of the berries to green bean and data on bean defects (black <b>bean)</b> together with <b>anthracnose</b> incidence subjected to appropriate statistical analysis. A similar procedure was followed using disease severity but the samples were from one farm only. The closing work on chemical control was done by screening 16 different fungicides for the control of C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum. With the 40 isolates, 29 were identified as C. gloeosporioides and 11 as C. acutatum. This is the first report of C. acutatum on coffee in PNG. Identification of the species was further confirmed by RFLP groupings where C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum were separated at 574 bp and 584 bp respectively and DNA sequence homology identified the PNG isolates with C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum accessions. Optimum conditions for conidia germination in relation to spore concentration, temperature, and pH are 1 x 106 spores/ml, 21 - 29 °C and pH 5 - 7 respectively for C. acutatum and for C. gloeosporioides 1 x 106 spores/ml, 25 - 31 °C and pH 5 - 7 respectively. Humidity is not a limiting factor for activity of both species. Infection process for both species is similar where conidia germinate to produce the germ tube which swells at the tip to form the appressoria. The appressoria produce an infection peg which is responsible for berry cuticle penetration and cell colonisation (resulting in typical anthracnose symptom expression) and eventual sporulation.

Although sources of resistance have been identified and characterized, the early molecular events in the host-pathogen interface have not been investigated. In the current study, we conducted a comprehensive transcriptome analysis using Illumina sequencing of two near isogenic lines (NILs) differing for the presence of the Co- 1 gene on chromosome Pv 01 during a time course following infection with race 73 of C. lindemuthianum. From this, we identified 3, 250 significantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs) within and between the NILs over the time course of infection. During the biotrophic phase the majority of DEGs were up regulated in the susceptible NIL, whereas more DEGs were up-regulated in the resistant NIL during the necrotrophic phase. Various defense related genes, such as those encoding PR proteins, peroxidases, lipoxygenases were up regulated in the resistant NIL. Conversely, genes encoding sugar transporters were up-regulated in the susceptible NIL during the later stages of infection. Additionally, numerous transcription factors (TFs) and candidate genes within the vicinity of the Co- 1 locus were differentially expressed, suggesting a global reprogramming of gene expression in and around the Co- 1 locus. Through this analysis, we reduced the previous number of candidate genes reported at the Co- 1 locus from eight to three.

Breeding for resistance to insect pests is updated for bean pod weevil (Apion), bruchid seed weevils, leafhopper, thrips, bean fly, and whitefly, including the use of arcelin proteins as selectable markers for resistance to bruchid seed weevils. Breeding for resistance to abiotic stresses concentrates on drought, low soil phosphorus, and improved symbiotic nitrogen fixation. The combination of root growth and morphology traits, phosphorus uptake mechanisms, root acid exudation, and other traits in alleviating phosphorus deficiency, and identification of numerous QTL of relatively minor effect associated with each trait, reveals the complexity to be addressed in breeding for abiotic stress resistance in common bean.

To verify the composition of Colletotrichum lindemuthianum races in east of Antioquia, 12 differential bean varieties were used to characterize 15 isolates collected from naturally infected bean varieties. Eleven races were identified among the 15 isolates characterized, six of which (races 9, 131, 135, 139, 643, y 645) were characterized for the first time. In addition, we evaluated 49 bean genotypes collected from the bean genebank of CIAT and CORPOICA, as well as landraces from farmers in producing. These genotypes were evaluated under natural field conditions {{as well as in}} the greenhouse, using races 651 and 653, previously identified as the most virulent races from Antioquia. Only four genotypes (AND 1084, SUG 130, LAS 106 and Diacol Catio) were resistant under both field and greenhouse conditions.

40|$|One of {{the factors}} that {{accounts}} for the low yields in common bean is the simultaneous occurrence of diseases on the common bean crop. Bean root rots and anthracnose are the most important common bean diseases that simultaneously occur on the bean crop in Uganda. Moreover, Colletotrichum lindemuthianum, the pathogen that causes <b>bean</b> <b>anthracnose,</b> possesses a high genetic variability which makes it easily break down single gene resistance. Pyramiding resistance genes for both diseases in commercial varieties would ensure reduction of yield losses resulting from the two diseases. However, the effect of marker assisted gene pyramiding on plant agronomic characters is not well understood. Three-way crosses were made to pyramid three anthracnose and one Pythium root rot resistance genes in four susceptible market class varieties. Sequence characterized amplified regions (SCAR) markers were used to facilitate the pyramiding scheme. Correlation analysis and Path coefficient analysis were used to assess the association between number of pyramided genes and different plant agronomic characters. Number of pyramided genes was negatively correlated with number of pods per plant (- 0. 32), number of seeds per plant (- 0. 25), number of seeds per pod (- 0. 18), pod length (- 0. 17), days to 50...|$|E

Resistance inducers, commercially formulated microorganisms, non-formulated selected strains of different microorganisms (fungi, bacteria and yeasts) and plant extracts were applied as dry or liquid seed treatments on naturally infested seeds. Seedling emergence and disease incidence and/or severity were recorded. Almost all seed treatments turned out to be ineffective in controlling the Ascochyta infections, which is in line with the literature stating that these pathogens are difficult to control. The only alternative treatments that gave some control of Ascochyta spp. were thyme oil and a strain of Clonostachys rosea. The resistance inducers tested successfully controlled infections of bean by C. lindemuthianum. Among the formulated microorganisms, Bacillus subtilis-based formulations provided the best protection from anthracnose. Some strains of Pseudomonas putida, a disease-suppressive, saprophytic strain of Fusarium oxysporum and the mustard powder-based product Tillecur also proved to be effective against <b>bean</b> <b>anthracnose.</b> However, among the resistance inducers as well as among the other groups, certain agents caused a significant reduction of plant emergence.

The knowledge on vegetative compatibility groups (VCGs) is of particular interest in asexual fungi as they subdivide the population in groups that can exchange genetic information via heterokaryosis and the parasexual cycle. Among the techniques used in studies about vegetative compatibility groups, the obtainment of nit mutants is apparent. This paper is aimed at obtaining heterokaryons between different isolates of C. lindemuthianum, grouping them in VCGs and evaluating their genetic variability by using the nit mutants system. Nit mutants were obtained from 20 single spore isolates. The mutants were phenotypically classified and paired for complementation and formation of heterokaryons so as to group them in VCGs. Seventeen mutants from the different phenotypic-rates were recovered: nit 1, nit 2, nit 3 and nitM. At the same time, 10 mutants were selected for pairing and division of the anastomosis groups. Nine heterokaryons were obtained and the isolates were divided into 9 vegetative compatibility groups. In the combinations for the formation of anastomosis, 31 compatible combinations and 24 incompatible combinations were observed. It was concluded that the methodology used to select nit mutants in C. lindemuthianum made it possible to determine the vegetative compatibility groups and that such a technique was adequate to prove genetic variability...|$|E

Colletotrichum lindemuthianum, the causal agent of <b>bean</b> <b>anthracnose,</b> is a highly variabile pathogen, {{and there are no}} host resistance genes that are effective against all known races of the pathogen. To diversify sources of resistance, we screened the core collection of the secondary gene pool of Phaseolus spp. and interspecific lines derived from simple and complex crosses of primary and secondary genotypes for their resistance to anthracnose. High levels of resistance were observed in the secondary gene pool. None of the 162 accessions tested was susceptible to C. lindemuthianum. Of the two species composing the secondary gene pool, P. polyanthus displayed higher levels of resistance than P. coccineus, and all accessions tested were resistant. The response of P. coccineus was more variable, with six genotypes showing an intermediate reaction. Among the 75 lines from interspecific crosses, 49 were resistant to the three races (races 6, 15, and 3481) used in this study, and higher levels of resistance were found in lines that had P. polyanthus as one of the parents in the crosses than in the lines derived from P. coccineus. These lines constitute a valuable source of resistance and may aid in the development of stable resistance to anthracnose. Peer-reviewe...|$|E

One of these, H 433 is a nonpathogenic mutant able to induce necrotic spots on infected leaves rapidly. These spots {{are similar to those}} observed during the hypersensitive reaction. Cytological observations showed that the development of the mutant H 433 is stopped at the switch between the biotrophic and the necrotrophic phases. This mutant carries two independent insertions of the transforming plasmid pAN 7 - 1. Complementation studies using the wild-type genomic regions corresponding to the two insertions showed that one is responsible for the H 433 phenotype. Sequencing analysis identified a single open reading frame that encoded a putative transcriptional activator belonging to the fungal zinc cluster (Zn[II] 2 Cys 6) family. The corresponding gene was designated CLTA 1 (for C.  lindemuthianum transcriptional activator 1). Expression studies showed that CLTA 1 is expressed in low amounts during in vitro culture. Targeted disrupted strains were generated, and they exhibited the same phenotype as the original mutant H 433. Complementation of these disrupted strains by the CLTA 1 gene led to full restoration of pathogenicity. This study demonstrates that CLTA 1 is both a pathogenicity gene and a regulatory gene involved in the switch between biotrophy and necrotrophy of the infection process of a hemibiotrophic fungus...|$|E
40|$|Colletotrichum lindemuthianum is {{a highly}} {{variable}} pathogen of common beans that easily overcomes resistance in cultivars bred with single-gene resistance. To determine pathogenic variability of the pathogen in Uganda, samples of common bean tissues with anthracnose symptoms were collected in eight districts of Uganda, namely Kabarole, Sironko, Mbale, Oyam, Lira, Kapchorwa, Maracha and Kisoro. 51 isolates sporulated successfully on Potato Dextrose Agar and Mathur’s media and were used to inoculate 12 differential cultivars under controlled conditions. Five plants per cultivar were inoculated with each isolate and then evaluated for their reaction using the 1 – 9 severity scale. Races were classified using the binary nomenclature system proposed by Pastor Corrales (1991). Variation due to cultivar and isolate effects was significant (P≤ 0. 001) for severity. The 51 isolates from eight districts grouped into 27 different races. Sironko district had {{the highest number of}} races followed by Mbale and Kabarole. Races 2047 and 4095 were the most frequently found, each with 10 isolates grouped under them. Race 4095 was the most virulent since it caused a susceptible (S) reaction on all 12 differential cultivars and the susceptible check. This was followed by races 2479, 2047 and 2045 respectively. Two races, 4094 and 2479, caused a susceptible reaction on the differential cultivar G 2333, which nevertheless, showed the most broad spectrum resistance followed by cultivars Cornell 49 - 242, TU, and AB 136 respectively.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Common <b>bean</b> <b>anthracnose,</b> {{caused by}} the fungus Colletotrichum lindemuthianum {{is one of the}} most {{important}} diseases of this crop. However, another disease that has caused damage to common bean crop is the scab that Colletotrichum truncatum has been reported as causal agent. Strains isolated from anthracnose and scab lesions have been investigated in recent years and strains of Glomerella spp. (teleomorphic form) and Colletotrichum spp. (anamorphic form) have been obtained and identified by morphological, cytological, molecular and pathogenic analyses (Barcelos et al., 2014; Mota et al., 2016). Barcelos et al. (2014) classified Glomerella sp. strains from anthracnose lesions in two distinct groups, group I and II. Group I strains did not cause symptoms in common bean and amplified for the HMGGlo primer, specific for G. cingulata (Barcelos et al., 2011) and did not amplified by the HMGCl primer, specific for C. lindemuthianum (Garcia-Serrano et al., 2008). On the other hand, group II presented mild symptoms 10 days after inoculation and did not amplified for both HMG primers. Recently, Mota et al. (2016) studying Glomerella sp. Group II and other strains from scab lesions, observed that both caused symptoms in the common bean plants similar to those anthracnose, differing only in pods, which presented typical scab symptoms, indicating that a complex of species may be causing the disease. Due to simultaneous occurrence and similarity of scab and anthracnose symptoms in the leaves and stems of the common bean plants, this study aimed to compare the pathogenicity in common bean of strains obtained from anthracnose and scab lesions. Molecular analysis of these strains also was carried out for possible identification of species...|$|E

Allelism tests indicate that resistance to race 38 of anthracnose in genotypes ‘A 1220 ’, ‘A 1231 ’, and ‘BAT 93 ’ and in the differential cultivars ‘PI 207262 ’ and ‘Mexico 222 ’ is determined by different dominant alleles at the same locus. Therefore, the results obtained suggest that the so far considered as different genes Co- 3 (described as present in ‘Mexico 222 ’) and Co- 9 (described as present in ‘BAT 93 ’) are alleles of the same gene.

40|$|Anthracnose {{caused by}} Colletotrichum lindemuthianum is an {{important}} disease of common bean, resulting in major economic losses worldwide. Genetic diversity of the C. lindemuthianum population contributes to its ability to adapt rapidly to new sources of host resistance. The origin of this diversity is unknown, but sexual recombination, via the Glomerella teleomorph, is one possibility. This study tested the hypothesis that Glomerella strains that are frequently recovered from <b>bean</b> <b>anthracnose</b> lesions represent the teleomorph of C. lindemuthianum. A large collection of Glomerella isolates could be separated into two groups based on phylogenetic analysis, morphology, and pathogenicity to beans. Both groups were unrelated to C. lindemuthianum. One group clustered with the C. gloeosporioides species complex and produced mild symptoms on bean tissues. The other group, which belonged to a clade that included the cucurbit anthracnose pathogen C. magna, caused no symptoms. Individual ascospores recovered from Glomerella perithecia gave rise to either fertile (perithecial) or infertile (conidial) colonies. Some pairings of perithecial and conidial strains resulted in induced homothallism in the conidial partner, while others led to apparent heterothallic matings. Pairings involving two perithecial, or two conidial, colonies produced neither outcome. Conidia efficiently formed conidial anastomosis tubes (CATs), but ascospores never formed CATs. The Glomerella strains formed appressoria and hyphae on the plant surface, but did not penetrate or form infection structures within the tissues. Their behavior was similar whether the beans were susceptible or resistant to anthracnose. These same Glomerella strains produced thick intracellular hyphae, and eventually acervuli, if host cell death was induced. When Glomerella was co-inoculated with C. lindemuthianum, it readily invaded anthracnose lesions. Thus, the hypothesis was not supported: Glomerella strains from anthracnose lesions do not represent the teleomorphic phase of C. lindemuthianum, and instead appear to be bean epiphytes that opportunistically invade and sporulate in the lesions...|$|E
