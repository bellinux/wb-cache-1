5|$|On February 15, 2008, DiBiase {{was arrested}} for DUI in Hillsborough County, Florida, after his Cadillac sport utility vehicle crashed into another vehicle. No one was seriously injured in the crash, but DiBiase failed a field sobriety test, and when breathalysed, {{was found to have}} a <b>blood</b> <b>alcohol</b> <b>level</b> of 0.137–0.138. He was {{released}} later that day on a US$500 bond.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{the morning}} of April 19, 2013, while in Atlanta, Georgia filming The Good Lie, Witherspoon and Toth were pulled over after the car in which they were {{traveling}} was seen weaving across a double line on Peachtree Street. Toth, who was driving, was found to have a <b>blood</b> <b>alcohol</b> <b>level</b> of 0.139 and {{was arrested and charged with}} driving under the influence and failing to maintain a lane. Witherspoon was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct for disobeying the arresting officer's instructions to remain in the vehicle and arguing with him, asking if he knew who she was. Witherspoon pleaded no contest and was fined $313, including court costs.|$|E
5|$|Drivers are {{not legally}} {{required}} to take field sobriety tests, although the results are admissible in court. The Alcotest has replaced the Breathalyzer as the standard device for determining <b>blood</b> <b>alcohol</b> <b>level.</b> When a driver is arrested for DUI, the police are prohibited from using force to obtain a breath, blood, or urine sample, and must warn {{the driver of the}} consequences of refusing a breath sample. In 2010, the New Jersey Supreme Court overturned the breath sample refusal conviction of a non-English speaking driver, ruling that drivers must be notified of the law in a language that they understand. A person can be charged with DUI or breath refusal up to 90 days after the incident, except in cases of serious injury or death, in which case the statute of limitations is 5 years.|$|E

40|$|Oral <b>alcohol</b> {{ingestion}} and <b>blood</b> <b>alcohol</b> <b>levels</b> {{were examined}} in adult female squirrel monkeys to assess the feasibility of using this primate {{as a model for}} fetal alcohol effects, In one experiment, alcohol intake was evaluated in nonpregnant animals under conditions in which the concentration of ethanol, length of ethanol exposure, and degree of liquid deprivation were varied. In another experiment <b>blood</b> <b>alcohol</b> <b>levels</b> were measured in pregnant animals of two subtypes that had been drinking ethanol. In a third experiment, time-dependent <b>blood</b> <b>alcohol</b> <b>levels</b> and behavior were evaluated in nonpregnant monkeys following intubation of specific doses of ethanol. Results showed that nonpregnant monkeys drank ethanol at concentrations of 5 to 10 %, and that the amount of ethanol consumed was related to the concentration and length of time ethanol was available. When given access to a 5 % ethanol solution, pregnant animals drank quantities that varied between individuals and subtypes, with maximum blood levels, measured up to 6 hr after presentation, ranging from 1 to 196 mg%. Intubation of ethanol resulted in <b>blood</b> <b>alcohol</b> <b>levels</b> and incoordination scores that were linearly related to dose, with maximum effects occurring 1 hr after administration.

5000|$|The {{main issue}} of the trial was the {{definition}} of [...] "operating an aircraft." [...] In {{order to get a}} conviction, the state had to prove the pilots were in control of the plane while under the influence of alcohol. The prosecution contended that the pilots were operating the aircraft from the moment they assumed responsibility for the plane. An America West operations manager testified that Cloyd signed a dispatch release accepting responsibility for the Airbus. When they arrived on the plane, prosecutors said, Cloyd and Hughes began several steps to complete the operation process. Hughes performed several safety checks and received clearance to input flight directives. The prosecution also heavily stressed Cloyd and Hughes' <b>blood</b> <b>alcohol</b> <b>levels,</b> which were taken nearly three hours after they arrived at the airport and over seven hours after they had their last drink. One state witness even suggested that at the time they arrived on the plane, the pilots may have had <b>blood</b> <b>alcohol</b> <b>levels</b> as high as 0.15.|$|R

25|$|The {{commission}} {{looked at}} the proposition that Stevens was unfit for command {{on the evening of}} the incident due to illness (a duodenal ulcer), drunkenness or a combination of the two, and that the description of the collision in Spicer's report and the conclusions drawn from it were inconsistent with events. Stevens' ulcer had previously hospitalised him, and he had concealed its recurrence from the RAN. There was evidence that Stevens had been served a triple brandy earlier in the night, and a post-mortem conducted on Stevens' body showed a <b>blood</b> <b>alcohol</b> <b>level</b> of 0.025%, though the significance of this figure was challenged by expert witnesses. The hearings lasted 85 days, and the Burbury Report was released publicly on 25 February 1968. It found that Stevens was medically unfit for command, although not impaired by alcohol {{at the time of the}} collision. Consequently, some of the findings of the first commission— those based on the assumption that Voyager was under appropriate command—required reevaluation. Robertson and the other officers of Melbourne were absolved of blame for the incident.|$|E
25|$|Newson {{had worked}} for London Underground since 1969 and the {{post-mortem}} examination {{did not find any}} evidence of a medical problem, such as a stroke or heart attack, that could have incapacitated him. There was some doubt as to whether he had consumed alcohol. Testing for this was hampered by the four-and-a-half days it took to retrieve his body from the wreckage. Analysis showed that his <b>blood</b> <b>alcohol</b> <b>level,</b> {{at the time of the}} post-mortem, was 80mg/100ml, but it was not possible to reach a definite conclusion as to whether this was the result of consumption of alcohol or a product of the process of decomposition. 80mg/100ml is the current English legal limit for driving a car (the limit at the time of the accident was higher), and the medical experts disagreed with each other on whether any amount consumed would have affected his ability to drive the train. Medical evidence to the official inquiry raised the possibility that the driver had been affected by a condition such as transient global amnesia, or akinesis with mutism, where the brain continues to function and the individual remains aware, although not being able to move physically, but it was stated that there was no evidence to indicate either condition: to positively diagnose akinesis with mutism would depend on a microscopic examination of the brain, which was not possible owing to decomposition, and transient global amnesia would leave no traces at post-mortem in any case.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION : Abundant anecdotal {{evidence}} for products claiming to reduce veisalgia after alcohol overindulgence {{are available on}} the Internet and as many advertisements in journals. None of these claims are, however, substantiated by research. The aim of this research was to ascertain the validity of such claims for the substance Absorbatox™, a potentiated aluminosilicate (cation exchanger able to bind NH 4 +, histamine, and other positively charged ions) by investigating the signs and symptoms, as well as <b>blood</b> or breath <b>alcohol</b> <b>levels,</b> in healthy volunteers. METHODS : <b>Blood</b> or breath <b>alcohol</b> <b>levels</b> were measured in all volunteers in initial controlled experiments, and symptoms were scored on a diary card for gastrointestinal tract symptoms, as well as other symptoms such as headache and light sensitivity. Eighteen volunteers completed the initial <b>blood</b> <b>alcohol</b> study, which investigated the effect of Absorbatox™ on <b>blood</b> <b>alcohol</b> <b>levels</b> after fasting. The follow-up studies researched the effects of the symptoms and signs of alcohol overindulgence. The “night out” study was completed by ten volunteers in a typical controlled environment, which was followed by the real-life four-leg crossover study. In the crossover study, volunteers (number = 25 completers) had to fill matching diary cards to containers of two placebo and two active drugs after a night out where they themselves decided on the container (color coded) to be used and the amount of alcohol to be consumed. RESULTS : Absorbatox™ had no effect on <b>blood</b> <b>alcohol</b> <b>levels,</b> but it significantly reduced the symptoms and signs of veisalgia by approximately 40 %– 50 %. CONCLUSION : This research indicates that Absorbatox™ does not have an effect on blood- or breath-alcohol levels. Furthermore, treatment with Absorbatox™ resulted in an overall significant reduction in central nervous system and gastrointestinal tract symptoms associated with veisalgia, warranting further investigation.

2500|$|Results {{indicate}} that, on average, {{performance with}} a <b>blood</b> <b>alcohol</b> <b>level</b> of 0.05% remained equivalent to performance after being awake for 16.9 to 18.6 hours.

5000|$|Moderate alcohol {{consumption}} 30-60 minutes before bedtime results in disruptions in sleep maintenance and sleep architecture that are mediated by <b>blood</b> <b>alcohol</b> <b>levels.</b> Disruptions in sleep maintenance are most marked once alcohol {{has been completely}} metabolized from the body. Under conditions of moderate <b>alcohol</b> consumption where <b>blood</b> <b>alcohol</b> <b>levels</b> average 0.06-0.08% and decrease 0.01-0.02% per hour, an alcohol clearance rate of 4-5 hours would coincide with disruptions in sleep maintenance {{in the second half}} of an 8-hour sleep episode. In terms of sleep architecture, moderate doses of alcohol facilitate [...] "rebounds" [...] in rapid eye movement (REM) and stage 1 sleep; following suppression in REM and stage 1 sleep in the first half of an 8-hour sleep episode, REM and stage 1 sleep increase well beyond baseline in the second half. Moderate doses of alcohol also increase slow wave sleep (SWS) in the first half of an 8-hour sleep episode. Enhancements in REM sleep and SWS following moderate {{alcohol consumption}} are mediated by reductions in glutamatergic activity by adenosine in the central nervous system. In addition, tolerance to changes in sleep maintenance and sleep architecture develops within 3 days of alcohol consumption before bedtime.|$|R
