6000|$|... "They {{were always}} going to teach me at Warner Grange, but <b>it</b> <b>always</b> <b>snowed,</b> or rained, or skated, I mean we skated, or something, {{whenever}} Hubert had time; but I am perfectly dying to learn." ...|$|R
50|$|Pluto {{runs his}} own {{neighborhood}} in Disney's Toontown Online. It's called the Brrrgh and <b>it's</b> <b>always</b> <b>snowing</b> there except during Halloween. During April Toons Week, a weekly event {{that is very}} silly, Pluto switches playgrounds with Minnie (all other characters do this as well). Pluto actually talks in Minnie's Melodyland.|$|R
6000|$|The way {{the snow}} [...] "goes" [...] for that poor woman is most unfair. <b>It</b> <b>always</b> <b>snows</b> much heavier in the {{particular}} spot where she is sitting than it does {{anywhere else in the}} whole street. Why, we have sometimes seen a heroine sitting {{in the midst of a}} blinding snow-storm while the other side of the road was as dry as a bone. And it never seemed to occur to her to cross over.|$|R
50|$|Moses {{strongly}} denies this, {{claiming he}} instead called Lisp a bean bag <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>always</b> returns {{to its original}} shape.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, well; I'm {{glad you}} are ready to come quickly to business, <b>because</b> <b>it's</b> <b>always</b> best. Won't you come and sit down here?" ...|$|R
50|$|This alga is {{strictly}} a freshwater algae and known as cold water algae, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>always</b> grow in high altitude stream {{where the water}} temperature is always low.|$|R
3000|$|... (iii)in case of nonconvergence, {{we return}} the bound {{computed}} {{in the first}} point. In practice, there is no consequence in doing this <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>always</b> happened for points deep in [...]...|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{wanted us}} to have a classic twelve bar rock and roll, <b>because</b> <b>it's</b> <b>always</b> good for concerts. A fun song, with lyrics without much importance, like in the most of twelve bars." ...|$|R
60|$|On PETER'S portion oysters grew--a {{delicacy}} rare, But oysters were a delicacy PETER couldn't bear. On SOMERS' {{side was}} turtle, on the shingle lying thick, Which SOMERS couldn't eat, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>always</b> made him sick.|$|R
5000|$|In 2007 the Australian Electoral Commission warned GetUp! that it felt its how-to-vote website was [...] "misleading and deceptive", <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>always</b> {{recommended}} against {{voting for}} Coalition candidates, since {{they did not}} provide information to GetUp for the online tool.|$|R
50|$|Second, {{the clue}} 3 can only spread {{somewhere between the}} second cell and the sixth cell, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>always</b> has to include the fourth cell; however, this may leave cells {{that may not be}} boxes in any case, i.e. the first and the seventh.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: The Chancel Repairs Act 1932, {{requiring}} contributions {{for local}} church repairs, accelerated land registration <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>always</b> takes effect against unregistered land, {{but only with}} a notice on registered land after 2013. It was held compatible with the ECHR in Parish of Aston Cantlow v Wallbank.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{never like}} to talk about any {{pleasure}} <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>always</b> vanishes as soon as it has come;--and when it has been real pleasure it never comes back again. I don't think I ever enjoyed anything so much as our ride this morning,--till that tragedy came." ...|$|R
50|$|The apostolic {{service of}} the Cenacle Sisters is both awesome and humbling, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>always</b> {{has to do with}} faith and prayer, and it touches on the deepest nature of the human person. It may take the form of retreats, spiritual direction, {{religious}} education, or other spiritual ministries.|$|R
50|$|Species: Altostratus is not {{divided into}} species <b>because</b> <b>it</b> is <b>always</b> nebulous or featureless in structure.|$|R
5000|$|Har’el {{said in an}} {{interview}} about the video with Filmmaker Magazine: “I suffer a lot when I have no freedom to do what I want <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>always</b> turns less than what it can be. But making films is expansive and you have to choose your battles. In this one, we were all on the same side.” ...|$|R
5000|$|After the World Indoor Championships, Williams {{announced}} that she was to focus on getting selected for the 100 m at the London 2012 Games. She stated, [...] "Now it’s onwards and upwards for the Olympics. I’m really concentrating on the 100m <b>because</b> <b>it’s</b> <b>always</b> been a dream of mine to do the 100m at the Olympics." ...|$|R
30|$|Optimizations are {{possible}} e. g.dependclk if no delayed assignments exists and trans(x) {{is a constant}} value (e. g. false). In this case, the variable xnxtnxt can completely be removed <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>always</b> holds a constant value. Similarly, optimizations {{are possible}} if there are not immediate assignments for a variable x. In this case, the translation shown for the control flow can be used.|$|R
50|$|<b>Because</b> <b>it</b> <b>always</b> halts, {{the machine}} is able to decide whether a given string {{is a member of}} a formal language. The class of {{languages}} which can be decided by such machines is exactly the set of recursive languages. However, due to the Halting Problem, determining whether an arbitrary Turing machine halts on every input is itself an undecidable decision problem.|$|R
50|$|Three sail shape {{controls}} which {{control the}} leech tension, and therefore sail twist, are the mainsheet, the boom vang and the traveler. The mainsheet pulls the boom (and therefore {{the foot of}} the sail) primarily inwards at lower points of sail and downwards at higher points of sail. Manipulation of the traveler can counteract this <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>always</b> pulls the boom laterally. The vang on the other hand does the opposite, <b>it</b> <b>always</b> changes the height of the boom.|$|R
2500|$|Most {{international}} students prefer Potomac Hall <b>because</b> <b>it</b> is <b>always</b> open. (The other dormitories close during Thanksgiving, winter, and spring breaks.) ...|$|R
50|$|Further, plans can {{be defined}} as {{sequences}} of actions, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> is <b>always</b> known in advance which actions will be needed.|$|R

3000|$|... is the BBW with X[*]=[*]{B, C, and D}, {{while the}} other three parts are equally divided in the PR zones {{according}} to (27). The number of BBW bands in the proposed scheme depends upon the number of PR zones. By considering BBW allocation, the tessellation property of FFR- 3 will remain valid <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>always</b> has one FR zone and three PR zones in the scenario.|$|R
50|$|Unopposed {{acceleration}} due to mechanical forces, and consequentially g-force, {{is experienced}} whenever anyone rides {{in a vehicle}} <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>always</b> causes a proper acceleration, and (in the absence of gravity) also always a coordinate acceleration (where velocity changes). Whenever the vehicle changes either direction or speed, the occupants feel lateral (side to side) or longitudinal (forward and backwards) forces produced by the mechanical push of their seats.|$|R
60|$|She avoided {{using the}} verb “to steal,” <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>always</b> made her brother uncomfortable. For Stevie was delicately honest. Certain simple {{principles}} had been instilled into him so anxiously (on {{account of his}} “queerness”) that the mere names of certain transgressions filled him with horror. He had been always easily impressed by speeches. He was impressed and startled now, and his intelligence was very alert.|$|R
5000|$|The {{cartoonist}} {{and fine}} artist Seth in 2003 described Ditko's style as [...] "oddball for mainstream comics. Whereas Kirby's stuff clearly appealed to a boy's sensibility {{because there was}} so much raw power, Ditko's work was really delicate and cartoony. There was a sense of design to <b>it.</b> You can <b>always</b> recognize anything that Ditko designed <b>because</b> <b>it's</b> <b>always</b> flowery. There is a lot of embroidered detail in the art, which is almost psychedelic." ...|$|R
40|$|A {{method for}} finding a global optimum to the on-off minimum-time control problem with limited fuel usage is presented. Each control {{can take on}} only three {{possible}} values: maximum, zero, or minimum. The simplex method for linear systems naturally yields such a solution for the re-formulation presented herein <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>always</b> produces an extreme point solution to the linear program. Numerical examples for the benchmark linear flexible system are presented...|$|R
50|$|The full Māori {{name for}} the island is 'Te Puia o Whakaari', meaning 'The Dramatic Volcano.' It was named 'White Island' by Captain Cook on 1 October 1769 <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>always</b> {{appeared}} to be in a cloud of white steam. Although Cook went close to the island he failed to notice that it was a volcano. Its official name is Whakaari/White Island although it is best known as White Island.|$|R
5000|$|The AAS Flower is the [...] "Crimson Glory" [...] Rose. This flower {{was adopted}} in 1956 because Mrs. Arnold, having been {{presented}} with a silver bud vase by the Air Force Association at their 1955 National Convention, said {{she knew what she}} would put in it: the [...] "Crimson Glory" [...] rose <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>always</b> reminded her of the Air Force, since it had Japanese Beetles during World War II.|$|R
5000|$|The {{users were}} allowed to water {{only in the last}} state to use boiled, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>always</b> {{bacteria}} were detected. Some residents said the source was also with [...] "graveyard water fed. Since an epidemic especially in the care institution concerned, we decided to make the water supply to reorganize. This was the initial impetus for the founding of the circle Roding waterworks, fed by the excellent Neubeuern sources." ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the first}} lecture, [...] "The Uncertainty of Science" [...] Feynman {{explains}} {{the nature of}} science, {{that it is a}} [...] "method for finding things out", and that it is [...] "based on the principle that observation is the judge of whether something is so or not". He says that uncertainty and doubt in science is a good thing, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>always</b> keeps the door open for further investigation.|$|R
5000|$|The {{simplest}} case is digital goods auction. There, step 4 {{is simple}} and consists only of calculating the optimal price in each sub-market. The optimal price in [...] is applied to [...] and vice versa. Hence, the mechanism is called [...] "Random-Sampling Optimal Price" [...] (RSOP). This case is simple <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>always</b> calculates feasible allocations. I.e, <b>it</b> is <b>always</b> possible to apply the price calculated in {{one side to the}} other side. This is not necessarily the case with physical goods.|$|R
5000|$|The {{song was}} written by band member Jonas Berggren, who was hoping to {{reproduce}} the flavour of their hit [...] "All That She Wants". Jonas specifically mentions {{the similarities between the}} two songs in the liner notes of the booklet for The Bridge album: [...] "We decided early on to do an [...] "All That She Wants" [...] arrangement and drums <b>because</b> <b>it's</b> <b>always</b> fun to have something old on a new record." ...|$|R
5000|$|Popper and David Hume {{agreed that}} {{there is often a}} {{psychological}} belief that the sun will rise tomorrow, but both denied {{that there is}} logical justification for the supposition that <b>it</b> will, simply <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>always</b> has in the past. Popper writes, [...] "I approached the problem of induction through Hume. Hume, I felt, was perfectly right in pointing out that induction cannot be logically justified."
