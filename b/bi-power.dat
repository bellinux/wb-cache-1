40|$|We propose two new jump robust estimators of {{integrated}} variance based on high-frequency return observations. These MinRV and MedRV estimators provide a compelling {{alternative to the}} prevailing <b>bi-power</b> and multi-power variation measures. Specifically, the MedRV estimator has better theoretical efficiency properties than the tri-power variation measure and displays better finite-sample robustness to both jumps and the occurrence of “zero ” returns in the sample. Unlike the <b>bi-power</b> variation measure the new estimator allows {{for the development of}} an asymptotic limit theory in the presence of jumps. Finally, it retains the local nature associated with the low order multi-power variation measures. This proves essential for avoiding the potential finite sample biases, arising from a pronounced intraday variation in the volatility level, that afflict alternative jump-robust integrated variance estimators based on longer blocks of returns.

Simulations show that the jump test has nice properties and is generally more powerful than the widely used <b>bi-power</b> variation test. An important feature of our test is that it can be applied-in analytically modified form-to noisy high frequency data and still retain power.

40|$|A {{rapidly growing}} {{literature}} has documented important improvements in volatility measurement and forecasting performance {{through the use}} of realized volatilities constructed from high frequency returns coupled with relatively simple reduced-form time series modeling procedures. Building on recent theoretical results from Barndorff-Nielsen and Shephard (2003 c,d) for related <b>bi-power</b> variation measures involving the sum of high-frequency absolute returns, the present paper provides a practical framework for non-parametrically measuring the jump component in realized volatility measurements. Exploiting these ideas for a decade of high-frequency five-minute returns for the DM/$ exchange rate, the S&P 500 market index, and the 30 -year U. S.

We have found out that the liquidity truly enters into the return-volatility relationship and influences these variables - the magic triangle interacts. However, contrary to our hypothesis, the model shows up that lower liquidity signifies lower realized risk. This inference has been suggested by all three models (3 SLS, 2 SLS and OLS).

We model exchange rate returns, the different components of realized volatility and the central bank intervention using a system of simultaneous equations. We find strong support that interventions by Bank of Japan had increased both the continuous and the jump components of daily realized volatility. This suggests that the interventions by Bank of Japan had increased market volatility which not only caused short-lived positive jumps but were also persistent over time.

Second, asset prices exhibit negative autocorrelations over very short horizons, positive autocorrelations over intermediate horizons, and negative autocorrelations over long horizons, which matches the observed stylized properties of U.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a comprehensive empirical evaluation of option-implied and returns-based forecasts of volatility, in which recent developments {{related to the}} impact on measured volatility of market microstructure noise are taken into account. The paper also assesses the robustness {{of the performance of}} the option-implied forecasts {{to the way in which}} those forecasts are extracted from the option market. Using a test for superior predictive ability, model-free implied volatility, which aggregates information across the volatility ‘smile’, and at-the-money implied volatility, which ignores such information, are both tested as benchmark forecasts. The forecasting assessment is conducted using intraday data for three Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) stocks and the S&P 500 index over the 1996 - 2006 period, with future volatility proxied by a range of alternative noise-corrected realized measures. The results provide compelling evidence against the model-free forecast, with its poor performance linked to both the bias and excess variability that it exhibits as a forecast of actual volatility. The positive bias, in particular, is consistent with the option market factoring in a substantial premium for volatility risk. In contrast, implied volatility constructed from liquid at-the-money options is given strong support as a forecast of volatility, at least for the DJIA stocks. Neither benchmark is supported for the S&P 500 index. Importantly, the qualitative results are robust to the measure used to proxy future volatility, although there is some evidence to suggest that any option-implied forecast may perform less well in forecasting the measure that excludes jump information, namely <b>bi-power</b> variation...|$|E
40|$|Estimating {{integrated}} volatility {{is one of}} {{the most}} important and challenging tasks in quantitative finance. As the ultra-high frequency data becomes available, nowadays new methods for integrated volatility estimation which can take use of as much high frequency data as provided are needed. Because of the complexity of the ultra-high frequency data, these new methods mostly nonparametric in nature. However, most of these nonparametric methods require the price data to be equally spaced in order to obtain asymptotic result. Examples include the class of realized kernel method, the two-time scale method, the <b>bi-power</b> method, and so on. On the other hand, the ultra-high frequency data available in the market is generally non-equally spaced. Applying these nonparametric methods means that we throw away a lot of the data available to make the data equally spaced. ^ In this thesis, we redefine the classical realized kernel estimator in order to accommodate random trading times. In order to characterize its asymptotic behavior, we prove several law of large numbers (LLN) and central limit theorems (CLT) for functionals of unequally-spaced data sampled from a continuous semi-martingale. We show that, based on appropriate constrains, the effect of randomness in sampling time or trading time can be controlled well enough to obtain useful asymptotic results for functionals of the didifferences of price data. Moreover, the CLTs provide us important tools to construct nonparametric methods to estimate integrated volatility using ultra-high frequency data. Based on the main CLT we further develop the asymptotic theory for our redefined realized kernel estimator of the integrated volatility. We show explicitly how the randomness of trading times and the micro-structural noise have influenced the asymptotic properties of our estimator. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three related chapters that study financial market volatility, jumps and the economic factors behind them. Each of the chapters analyzes a different aspect of this problem. The first chapter examines tests for jumps based on recent asymptotic results. Monte Carlo {{evidence suggests that the}} daily ratio z-statistic has appropriate size, good power, and good jump detection capabilities revealed by the confusion matrix comprised of jump classification probabilities. Theoretical and Monte Carlo analysis indicate that microstructure noise biases the tests against detecting jumps, and that a simple lagging strategy corrects the bias. Empirical work documents evidence for jumps that account for seven percent of stock market price variance. Building on realized variance and <b>bi-power</b> variation measures constructed from high-frequency financial prices, the second chapter proposes a simple reduced form framework for modelling and forecasting daily return volatility. The chapter first decomposes the total daily return variance into three components, and proposes different models for the different variance components: an approximate long-memory HAR-GARCH model for the daytime continuous variance, an ACH model for the jump occurrence hazard rate, a log-linear structure for the conditional jump size, and an augmented GARCH model for the overnight variance. Then the chapter combines the different models to generate an overall forecasting framework, which improves the volatility forecasts for the daily, weekly and monthly horizons. The third chapter studies the economic factors that generate financial market volatility and jumps. It extends the recent literature by separating market responses into continuous variance and discontinuous jumps, and differentiating the market’s disagreement and uncertainty. The chapter finds that there are more large jumps on news days than on no-news days, with the fixed-income market being more responsive than the equity market, and non-farm payroll employment being the most influential news. Surprises in forecasts impact volatility and jumps in the fixed-income market more than the equity market, while disagreement and uncertainty influence both markets with different effects on volatility and jumps.

40|$|Financial markets {{sometimes}} generate significant discontinuities, {{so called}} jumps, triggered by large informational shocks and extreme events. In the last decade, {{there is an}} increasing interest in financial economics towards modeling these jumps which may have significant consequences for risk management, and portfolio allocation. This thesis extends the literature within these areas in several ways by using high frequency data in combination with so called realized and power variation measures to identify and analyze jumps. The thesis consists of five chapters. The first reviews some theory of realized volatility and summarizes the thesis. The second chapter investigates the economic importance of this jump component within an asset allocation problem. We find that a risk averse investor with quadratic utility is willing to sacrifice a significant percentage return in order to account for jumps when modeling and forecasting the covariance matrix of returns. In the third chapter, co-authored with Mia Holmfeldt, we propose a framework to improve the predictability of total return variance. Within a GARCH-jump framework we obtain one-step-ahead predictions of the total return variance by modeling the continuous part of total variance and the jump separately. A {{significant increase in the}} predictability is reported when the duration {{and the size of the}} jumps are considered. Ignoring such jump characteristics will result in misleading quantile predictions with unsatisfying risk management as a result. Today there is strong support for changes in the market co-movements in periods of financial distress or extreme events. In chapter four we investigate this by examining the correlation between the stock and bond market on jump days. We find significant changes in both the realized and <b>bi-power</b> version of the correlation coefficient. To investigate the dependence further we apply a volatility decomposition in a vector autoregression and construct a transmission index. We report a transmission effect for both the smooth volatility and the jump component. A time changing version of the index reveal strong support for changes in the dependence on jump days and during periods associated with key economic events. In the last chapter we further explore this issue by studying the dependence structure in multivariate high frequency stock and bond data. Using copula techniques, we find a pronounced time-variation in the dependence with a significant increase on jump days. Furthermore we find support for jumps being transmitted across asset classes given that one of the market jumps. Small stock market jumps are more of idiosyncratic type and is not influencing the dependence structure to the same extent as jumps in the bond market...|$|E
