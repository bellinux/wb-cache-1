25|$|The press {{deserved}} the attacks and criticisms of Will Irwin (1910) and Upton Sinclair (1920) and the muckrakers who followed, {{and it needs}} today the watchdog and gadfly activities of the new critical weeklies, but {{all in all it}} is now a better medium of mass information.... The 1972 Watergate disclosures, it is true, were made by only a score {{of the members of the}} mass media, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> Teapot Dome when only one of our 1,750 dailies (the Albuquerque Morning Journal) dared to tell the truth about White House corruption. We have come a long way since.|$|E
500|$|Steve Belfer, one of Hillenburg's {{friends from}} CalArts, wrote and {{performed}} {{the music that}} is played over the end credits. This theme includes ukulele music, per Hillenburg's request. Drymon said, [...] "It's so long ago, it's hard to be sure, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> Hillenburg having the Belfer music early on, maybe before the pilot".|$|E
500|$|St-Pierre's trainer Greg Jackson {{denied any}} wrongdoing, stating that Nurse was rubbing and tapping on St-Pierre's body {{as part of}} a drill to aid in his {{breathing}} techniques. [...] Jackson said that any Vaseline transferred from residue on Nurse's fingers was accidental and wiped off when pointed out. [...] Georges St-Pierre spoke to Sports Illustrated with regard to the controversy stating, [...] "I haven't seen the fight yet, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> at some point something happened and the athletic commission was complaining. [...] They used a towel to wet my back and wipe it off. [...] I don't mind. [...] I didn't put Vaseline on myself and I'm not a cheater." [...] However, St-Pierre offered Penn a rematch in the summer that Penn verbally accepted but is unlikely to happen due to the fact they have both since been scheduled for title defenses.|$|E

500|$|Producer Norman Whitfield {{had always}} wanted to work with Paul Buckmaster, the British {{arranger}} and composer. One day he called Buckmaster and invited him to work on some recordings he had finished. After meeting, they decided to contact songwriter Miles Gregory to use one of his songs for Whitfield's record group Rose Royce. Buckmaster found that Gregory was under medication from overuse of drugs and [...] "was in considerable discomfort, if not in outright pain. He didn't write a song and dance about his pain, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> him sitting at the piano and wincing. So before jumping on the thing that Miles was merely indulging himself and writing, one has to remember that the guy was in a lot of pain." [...] Nevertheless, Whitfield and Buckmaster encouraged Gregory to write the song and the result was [...] "Love Don't Live Here Anymore", inspired by Gregory's own situation and his deteriorating physical health.|$|E
500|$|For this record, Björk {{incorporated}} shelved songs {{she wrote}} in Manchester with 808 State's Graham Massey, which had preceded the recording sessions for Debut. These included [...] "Army of Me" [...] and [...] "The Modern Things", which had become live staples over the summer, and thus {{did not need to}} undergo extensive transformations at Compass Point. Massey stated: [...] "With [...] "Army of Me" [...] we wanted to try something that was quite hard and techno-y. I'm not sure how she wrote those lyrics so fast <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> that song being almost instantaneous. [...] We kind of knocked that off in one day and then started on [...] "The Modern Things" [...] the same day and finished that the next". Although the album was supposed to be delivered the day after she returned from the Bahamas, Björk felt it was not yet complete and decided to continue its production back in London. She enlisted a new team of engineers and programmers, and spent the next months [...] "tweaking, rearranging, and sometimes completely rerecording her pre-existing tracks". Ultimately, it was the inclusion of more [...] "real" [...] instruments that [...] "resuscitated Post for Björk".|$|E
500|$|At the Clifton House, Bryan's {{rooms were}} {{overwhelmed}} with those wishing to congratulate him, {{despite the efforts}} of police to keep the crowds at bay. [...] Bryan quipped, [...] "I seem to have plenty of friends now, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> well when they were very few." [...] He left the choice of a running mate to the convention; delegates selected Maine shipbuilder Arthur Sewall. [...] Active in Democratic Party politics, Sewall {{was one of the few}} eastern party leaders to support silver, was wealthy and could help finance the campaign; he also balanced the ticket geographically. [...] According to historian Stanley Jones in his account of the 1896 election, [...] "it seemed in retrospect a curious logic that gave a capitalist from Maine a leading role in a campaign intended to have a strong appeal to the masses of the South and West". [...] Bryan and Sewall gained their nominations without the ballots of the gold men, most of whom refused to vote. [...] Amid talk that the Gold Democrats would form their own party, Senator Hill was asked if he remained a Democrat. [...] "I was a Democrat before the Convention and am a Democrat still—very still." ...|$|E

500|$|Israeli actress Ania Bukstein {{was also}} {{introduced}} in the series as the High Priestess Kinvara, who is brought to Meereen to spread propaganda about Daenerys Targaryen's supposed success at eliminating {{the problem with the}} Sons of the Harpy. In an interview with Bukstein she said, [...] "Yes, it's very exciting, but let's calm down. It's not like I'm the new Khaleesi. Game of Thrones came after a ton of hard work. I filmed a lot of audition tapes in front of a white wall at home. I've paid my dues for years." [...] Bukstein also stated that she had previously sent in an audition tape to the series when it was first casting its first season, saying, [...] "A few years ago, when they had only begun to cast the first season of Game of Thrones, I sent an audition tape. I didn't really know for which role, and I mainly didn't know—and neither did the world—what a hit the series was about to become. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> that even then, the scenes that I got excited me, and I completely went with the style." ...|$|E
2500|$|Janick recalls it as follows: [...] "He rang {{me up and}} {{we talked}} <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> saying, 'There is no way {{in this world that}} I am putting on make up or {{anything}} like that, I'm just not into that shit.' But we had a chat and he seemed like a nice enough guy. But I never heard back from him." ...|$|E
2500|$|Daniel Hughes' son, Robert, {{recalled}} {{many details}} of his experiences on the Underground Railroad in his later years. He said about the runaways, [...] "We would hide them in the woods in brush houses. I {{was just a little}} boy, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> very well carrying meals out to them in the woods. They usually traveled in groups of two or three men. Often patrollers would come to our place looking for runaways. They never caught anyone at our place. Rich people and good people in Williamsport, mostly Quakers helped in the work." ...|$|E

2500|$|The parents, David and Eliza, {{were back}} in England by 1834 but they soon moved up to David's family home at Eriboll in the far north of Scotland. The school {{teaching}} there was primitive but effective. [...] repeats an anecdote told by Alexander's younger brother: [...] "I {{do not know what}} schooling he had in those young days, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> his telling me of a dominie putting him under his desk and kicking him from time to time, also how taws were used. Anyway he learned Latin and mathematics." ...|$|E
2500|$|Production on {{the album}} was difficult. A.C. Newman stated, [...] "I {{remember}} 'Letter From an Occupant' was a pretty belabored song. It ended up being almost minimal, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> there's so much shit we put on it. There's a psychedelic 12-string guitar solo, a backwards guitar, there's a kind of really cool synth that's in there but buried. At some point, you have to choose. That was the hardest part about mixing the thing: just making that judgment call. I only feel at peace with the record now because people seem to like it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jay Kanter, Brando's agent, producer, and friend, defended him in Daily Variety: [...] "Marlon {{has spoken}} to me for hours about his fondness for the Jewish people, {{and he is a}} {{well-known}} supporter of Israel." [...] Similarly, Louie Kemp, in his article for Jewish Journal, wrote: [...] "You might remember him as Don Vito Corleone, Stanley Kowalski or the eerie Col. Walter E. Kurtz in 'Apocalypse Now', <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> Marlon Brando as a mensch and a personal friend of the Jewish people when they needed it most." [...] In an interview with NBC Today one day after Brando's death, King also defended Brando's comments, saying that they had been blown out of proportion and taken out of context.|$|E

2500|$|Durance first gained fame in 2004, {{after being}} cast as Lois Lane {{on the popular}} CW {{television}} series, Smallville, playing a sassy, street-smart teenage Lois Lane in season four. Executive Producer Kelly Souders recalled hiring Durance stating: [...] "There {{were a lot of}} wonderful actresses who came in for the role, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> sitting and watching her tape and everybody was like, 'That’s her. There's no question. Fellow producer Brian Peterson added that from the moment Durance was hired they knew she would be Lois for the series. Durance was promoted to series regular in season five and became part of the regular cast {{for the remainder of the}} series run. She played Lois for seven seasons and received three Saturn Award nominations for her portrayal of the character. On playing Lois Lane Durance said: ...|$|E
2500|$|That {{was what}} we liked to call a [...] "pay the rent" [...] job. It wasn't a script I liked, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> my agent at the time saying, [...] "Look, {{you only have to}} work two weeks, and they're going to pay you a lot of money. We'll just say it was your first movie and they just didn't release it." [...] I think people were all fucked up on drugs. I don't know. I was a little removed, because I wasn't on the movie the whole time, but it seemed like it was just a mess. Like, when I'd go, I'd think--I like to make a movie where I know who the boss is. I like a big boss. I like a real director. And it seemed like it was just, [...] "Who's driving the ship here? What's going on?" ...|$|E
2500|$|In her childhood, Jemison {{learned to}} make {{connections}} to science by studying nature. Once when a splinter infected her thumb as a little girl, Jemison's mother {{turned it into a}} learning experience. She ended up doing a whole project about pus. Jemison's parents were very supportive of her interest in science, while her teachers were not. [...] "In kindergarten, my teacher asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up, and I told her a scientist," [...] Jemison says. [...] "She said, 'Don't you mean a nurse?' Now, there's nothing wrong with being a nurse, but that's not what I wanted to be." [...] In an interview with Makers, she further explains how her sheer interest in science was not accepted. [...] "Growing up...I was just like every other kid. I loved space, stars and dinosaurs. I always knew I wanted to explore. At the time of the Apollo airing, everybody was thrilled about space, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> being irritated that there were no women astronauts. People tried to explain that to me, and I did not buy it." ...|$|E

5000|$|A long-running rumor {{was that}} Electrocop was {{initially}} {{developed as a}} 3D sequel to Impossible Mission. However, when asked about this rumor, Electrocop developer Greg Omi said, [...] "It's funny, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> can't <b>remember</b> if {{it was supposed to}} be a sequel to Impossible Mission or not. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> writing a story and basic game design and pitching it to RJ Mical, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>remember</b> if they were asking for a sequel." ...|$|R
2500|$|Writing for Rolling Stone, Langdon Winner {{found the}} songs [...] "distinctly second rate" [...] {{relative}} to McCartney's best compositions as a Beatle, with only [...] "Maybe I'm Amazed" [...] "even com close" [...] to matching that high standard, but he admired McCartney's vocals and added: [...] "if one can accept the album {{in its own}} terms, McCartney stands as a very good, although not astounding, piece of work." [...] Winner admitted to being repelled by the [...] "tawdry propaganda" [...] surrounding the release, however, about which he emphasised: [...] "Remember, this is all stuff that Paul himself deliberately included , not just some idle comments he let slip to a probing journalist." [...] The reviewer concluded: [...] "I like McCartney very much. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> {{that the people of}} Troy also liked that wooden horse they wheeled through their gates until they discovered that it was hollow inside and full of hostile warriors." [...] More recently, Rolling Stone has deemed the album [...] "so modest it barely registers" [...] in comparison with Lennon's Plastic Ono Band, adding: [...] "Only the white soul of 'Maybe I'm Amazed' distinguishes otherwise unbearably slight confections such as 'Lovely Linda.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Schwarzenegger took to {{visiting a}} gym in Graz, {{where he also}} frequented the local movie theaters to see {{bodybuilding}} idols such as Reg Park, Steve Reeves, and Johnny Weissmuller on the big screen. When Reeves died in 2000, Schwarzenegger fondly remembered him: [...] "As a teenager, I grew up with Steve Reeves. His remarkable accomplishments allowed {{me a sense of}} what was possible, when others around me didn't always understand my dreams. Steve Reeves has been part of everything I've ever been fortunate enough to achieve." [...] In 1961, Schwarzenegger met former Mr. Austria Kurt Marnul, who invited him to train at the gym in Graz. He was so dedicated as a youngster that he broke into the local gym on weekends, when it was usually closed, so that he could train. [...] "It would make me sick to miss a workout... I knew I couldn't look {{at myself in the mirror}} the next morning if I didn't do it." [...] When Schwarzenegger was asked about his first movie experience as a boy, he replied: [...] "I was very young, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> my father taking me to the Austrian theaters and seeing some newsreels. The first real movie I saw, that I distinctly remember, was a John Wayne movie." ...|$|E
