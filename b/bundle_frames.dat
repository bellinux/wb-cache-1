25|$|The {{approach}} of Cartan and Weyl, using connection 1-forms on the <b>frame</b> <b>bundle</b> of , gives {{a third way}} to understand the Riemannian connection. They noticed that parallel transport dictates that a path in the surface be lifted to a path in the <b>frame</b> <b>bundle</b> so that its tangent vectors lie in a special subspace of codimension one in the three-dimensional tangent space of the <b>frame</b> <b>bundle.</b> The projection onto this subspace is defined by a differential 1-form on the orthonormal <b>frame</b> <b>bundle,</b> the connection form. This enabled the curvature properties of the surface to be encoded in differential forms on the <b>frame</b> <b>bundle</b> and formulas involving their exterior derivatives.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a generalization of symplectic geometry to a principal bundle over the configuration {{space of a}} classical field. This bundle, the vertically adapted linear <b>frame</b> <b>bundle,</b> is obtained by breaking the symmetry of the full linear <b>frame</b> <b>bundle</b> of the field configuration space, and it inherits a generalized symplectic structure from the full <b>frame</b> <b>bundle.</b> The geometric structure of the vertically adapted <b>frame</b> <b>bundle</b> admits vector-valued field observables and produces vector-valued Hamiltonian vector fields, from which we can define a Poisson bracket on the field observables. We show that the linear and affine multivelocity spaces and multiphase spaces for geometric field theories are associated to the vertically adapted <b>frame</b> <b>bundle.</b> In addition, the new geometry not only generalizes both the linear and the affine models of multisymplectic geometry but also resolves fundamental problems found in both multisymplectic models.

If Q is realized as a reduction of the <b>frame</b> <b>bundle</b> of M, then the solder form is given by the pullback of the tautological form of the <b>frame</b> <b>bundle</b> along the inclusion. Abstractly, if one regards Q as a principal bundle independently of its realization as a reduction of the <b>frame</b> <b>bundle,</b> then the solder form consists of a representation &rho; of G on Rn and an isomorphism of bundles &theta; : TM &rarr; Q &times;&rho; Rn.|$|R
50|$|Local {{sections}} of the <b>frame</b> <b>bundle</b> of M are called smooth frames on M. The cross-section theorem for principal bundles states that the <b>frame</b> <b>bundle</b> is trivial over any open set in U in M which admits a smooth frame. Given a smooth frame s : U → FU, the trivialization ψ : FU → U × GL(n, R) is given bywhere p is a frame at x.

40|$|We {{discuss the}} {{geometric}} foundation behind {{the use of}} stochastic processes in the <b>frame</b> <b>bundle</b> of a smooth manifold to build stochastic models with applications in statistical analysis of non-linear data.

We explain how data mean and covariance {{can be interpreted as}} points in the <b>frame</b> <b>bundle</b> or, more precisely, in the bundle of symmetric positive definite 2 -tensors analogously to the parameters describing Euclidean normal distributions. We discuss a factorization of the <b>frame</b> <b>bundle</b> projection map through this bundle, the natural sub-Riemannian structure of the <b>frame</b> <b>bundle,</b> the effect of holonomy, and the existence of subbundles where the Hormander condition is satisfied such that the Brownian motions have smooth transition densities. We identify the most probable paths for the underlying Euclidean Brownian motion and discuss small time asymptotics of the transition densities on the manifold. The geometric setup yields an intrinsic approach to the estimation of mean and covariance in non-linear spaces...|$|R
