5|$|The 179th Street station (drawn up as 178th Street) {{had been}} planned {{along with the rest}} of the IND Queens Boulevard Line as its {{original}} terminus as early as 1928. In December 1930, however, it was planned to construct stations only up to 169th Street, with tail tracks and switches installed up to the foot of the station at 178th Street, along with a provision for the station. The tracks ended at bumper blocks, and the tunnel at a <b>bulkhead.</b> Under these <b>plans,</b> the 178th Street station would be built during a further eastward extension. The Queens Boulevard Line was extended up to 169th Street on April 24, 1937, with the tail tracks and switches used to store and reverse trains.|$|R
500|$|The Alma-class ironclads were {{designed}} by Henri Dupuy de LÃ´me as improved versions of the armored corvette [...] suitable for foreign deployments. Unlike their predecessor the ships were true central battery ironclads as they were fitted with armored transverse <b>bulkheads.</b> The original <b>plan</b> for these ships {{was to have a}} two-deck battery with four [...] guns on the battery deck and four [...] guns mounted above them on the upper deck, one gun at each corner of the battery. This design was changed to substitute four barbettes for the upper battery, but the addition of armored bulkheads proved to be very heavy and the rear pair of barbettes had to be deleted to save weight. In partial compensation the 164-millimeter guns in the remaining forward barbettes were replaced by an additional pair of 194-millimeter guns. Like most ironclads of their era they were equipped with a metal-reinforced ram.|$|R
5000|$|In [...] "Darkmount, NV", Bulkhead took Miko to {{a meeting}} place where he {{expected}} {{to meet up with}} Wheeljack, who had just been captured by the Decepticons. In [...] "Scattered", Bulkhead and Miko met up with Wheeljack, leading a group of Vehicons into a trap using a tracking device Starscream had implanted on him. In [...] "Prey", <b>Bulkhead</b> and Wheeljack <b>plan</b> to blow up a large energon mine, knowing the explosion would be seen by any Autobot close by. They are attacked by a dragon-like Predacon (later to be known as Predaking) who proves to be too powerful for the Wreckers. They escape with the help of Ultra Magnus though, and later assist in the assault of Darkmount in [...] "Rebellion" [...] until they are defeated by Shockwave. Fortunately, Optimus reappears after being missing in action and defeats Megatron, allowing the human military to destroy Darkmount while the Autobots escape.|$|R
5|$|On 12 June 1917, {{well before}} Mutsu was laid down, Hiraga {{proposed}} a revised {{design for the}} ship that reflected the lessons from the Battle of Jutland that had occurred the previous year, and incorporated advances in boiler technology. Given project number A-125, his design added an extra twin main-gun turret, using space and weight made available by {{the reduction of the}} number of boilers from 21 to 12, while the power remained the same. He reduced the secondary armament from 20 guns to 16, although they were raised in height to improve their ability to fire during heavy weather and to improve their arcs of fire. To increase the ship's protection he proposed angling the belt armor outwards to improve its resistance to horizontal fire, and increasing the thickness of the lower deck armor and the torpedo <b>bulkhead.</b> Hiraga also <b>planned</b> to add anti-torpedo bulges to improve underwater protection. He estimated that his ship would displace as much as Nagato, although it would cost about a million yen more. Hiraga's changes would have considerably delayed Mutsus completion and were rejected by the Navy Ministry.|$|R

It added an extra twin main-gun turret, using space and weight made available by {{the reduction of the}} number of boilers from 21 to 12 while the power remained the same. He reduced the secondary armament from 20 guns to 16; they were moved up a deck to improve their arcs of fire and their ability to shoot during heavy weather.

These changes would have considerably delayed the ship's completion and were rejected by the Navy Ministry. The rejected design formed the basis for a much larger [...] battleship, designated as A-127, with nearly twice as much armor weight as the Nagatos. It was designed to achieve the same speed as the older ships, to allow them to maneuver together as a tactical formation. This design was accepted on 27 March 1918 and became the Tosa class.|$|R
