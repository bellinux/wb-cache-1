5|$|On stage, Harlequin Munchausen, or the Fountain of Love, a {{pantomime}} {{based on}} the Raspe text, was produced in London in 1818, and Herbert Eulenberg made the Baron the main character of a 1900 play, Münchhausen. The Expressionist writer Walter Hasenclever turned the stories into a comedy, Münchhausen, in 1934. Grigori Gorin used the Baron as the hero of his 1976 play That Very Munchausen; a film version was made in 1980. Baron Prášil, a Czech musical about the Baron, opened in 2010 in Prague. The following year, the National <b>Black</b> <b>Light</b> Theatre of Prague toured the United Kingdom with a nonmusical production of The Adventures of Baron Munchausen.|$|E

5|$|The hussar cavalry were garbed in a <b>black,</b> <b>light</b> blue {{collared}} dolman, {{sometimes with}} a black pelisse. Black overalls were worn over tight breeches of the hussar style. The hussars also wore a black Shako. The sword and equipment were originally of Austrian design. The Uhlan squadron wore a green kurtka or lancer's jacket with red facings and a traditional czapka cap, their uniform being {{a copy of the}} Austrian Graf von Meerveldt Uhlan Regiment. The lance had a red and yellow pennon. By 1815, the Uhlans were wearing all-black uniforms, but retained the yellow-topped czapka.|$|E
5|$|The makeup for the Trill host {{featured}} a separate nose and forehead pieces, as the {{intention was to}} retain the general look of a human. Air bladders were placed inside a fake abdomen to create the shot in which the symbiont appeared to move under the host's skin. A second fake abdomen was created for the surgery scene in which the symbiont is moved into Riker, which worked by having a crew member lie under the surgery table, pulling the symbiont into the opening using a concealed string. The design of the symbiont {{was based on a}} caterpillar with an octopus for a head, which {{featured a}} further air bladder in order to give the appearance that it was pulsating and painted in fluorescent paint to glow when a <b>black</b> <b>light</b> was shone on it during that scene.|$|E
25|$|A <b>Black</b> <b>light</b> or UV Light is a lamp {{emitting}} {{electromagnetic radiation}} {{that is almost}} exclusively in the soft ultraviolet range, and emits little visible light. The <b>black</b> <b>light</b> was invented by William H. Byler, in 1935.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{many other}} types of lamp emit {{ultraviolet}} light with visible <b>light,</b> <b>black</b> <b>lights</b> are essential when UV-A light without visible light is needed, particularly in observing fluorescence, the colored glow that many substances emit when exposed to UV. [...] <b>Black</b> <b>lights</b> are employed for decorative and artistic lighting effects, diagnostic and therapeutic uses in medicine, the detection of substances tagged with fluorescent dyes, rock-hunting, the detection of counterfeit money, the curing of plastic resins, attracting insects and the detection of refrigerant leaks affecting refrigerators and air conditioning systems. Strong sources of long-wave ultraviolet light are used in tanning beds. [...] Although the low-power UV-A emitted by <b>black</b> <b>lights</b> is not a hazard to skin or eyes and can be viewed without protection, powerful ultraviolet sources present dangers and require personal protective equipment such as goggles and gloves.|$|R

25|$|<b>Black</b> <b>light</b> is {{commonly}} used to authenticate oil paintings, antiques and banknotes. Black lights {{can be used to}} differentiate real currency from counterfeit notes because, in many countries, legal banknotes have fluorescent symbols on them that only show under a <b>black</b> <b>light.</b> In addition, the paper used for printing money does not contain any of the brightening agents which cause commercially available papers to fluoresce under <b>black</b> <b>light.</b> Both of these features make illegal notes easier to detect and more difficult to successfully counterfeit. The same security features can be applied to identification cards.|$|E
25|$|<b>Black</b> <b>light</b> is used {{extensively}} in non-destructive testing. Fluorescing fluids {{are applied to}} metal structures and illuminated with a <b>black</b> <b>light</b> which allows cracks and other weaknesses in the material to be easily detected. It {{is also used to}} illuminate pictures painted with fluorescent colors, particularly on black velvet, which intensifies the illusion of self-illumination. The use of such materials, often in the form of tiles viewed in a sensory room under UV light, is common in the United Kingdom for the education of students with profound and multiple learning difficulties. Such fluorescence from certain textile fibers, especially those bearing optical brightener residues, can also be used for recreational effect, as seen, for example, in the opening credits of the James Bond film A View to a Kill. <b>Black</b> <b>light</b> puppetry is also performed in a <b>black</b> <b>light</b> theater.|$|E

25|$|A <b>black</b> <b>light</b> {{may also}} be formed by simply using a UV filter coating such as Wood's glass on the {{envelope}} of a common incandescent bulb. This was the method {{that was used to}} create the very first <b>black</b> <b>light</b> sources. Although incandescent <b>black</b> <b>light</b> bulbs are a cheaper alternative to fluorescent tubes, they are exceptionally inefficient at producing UV light since most of the light emitted by the filament is visible light which must be blocked. Due to its black body spectrum, an incandescent light radiates less than 0.1% of its energy as UV light. Incandescent UV bulbs, due to the necessary absorption of the visible light, become very hot during use. This heat is, in fact, encouraged in such bulbs, since a hotter filament increases the proportion of UVA in the black-body radiation emitted. This high running-temperature drastically reduces the life of the lamp, however, from a typical 1000 hours to around 100 hours.|$|E

25|$|Scorpions {{are also}} known to glow a vibrant blue-green {{when exposed to}} certain {{wavelengths}} of ultraviolet light such as that produced by a <b>black</b> <b>light,</b> due {{to the presence of}} fluorescent chemicals in the cuticle. One fluorescent component is now known to be beta-carboline. A hand-held UV lamp has long been a standard tool for nocturnal field surveys of these animals. Fluorescence occurs as a result of sclerotisation and increases in intensity with each successive instar. This fluorescence may have an active role in scorpion light detection.|$|E
25|$|High power mercury vapor <b>black</b> <b>light</b> lamps {{are made}} in power ratings of 100 to 1000 watts. These do not use phosphors, but rely on the {{intensified}} and slightly broadened 350375nm spectral line of mercury from high pressure discharge at between , depending upon the specific type. These lamps use envelopes of Wood's glass or similar optical filter coatings to block out all the visible light and also the short wavelength (UVC) lines of mercury at 184.4 and 253.7nm, which are harmful to the eyes and skin. A few other spectral lines, falling within the pass band of the Wood's glass between 300 and 400nm, contribute to the output.|$|E
