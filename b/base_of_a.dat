5|$|Between the Octagon and {{the main}} {{gatehouse}} in the north wall was a barbican, of which little survives– {{just a piece of}} the west wall– although the structure was originally two storeys high. The surviving fabric includes a slot for a portcullis for the barbican's north gate, although there are no hinges for gates. The <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> garderobe demonstrates that second storey would have provided space for habitation, probably a guard room. Drawings from the late 18th century show the ground floor of the barbican still standing and includes detail such as vaulting inside the passageway.|$|E
5|$|CR115 {{begins at}} the Tioga County line {{in the town of}} Caroline, where it connects to Tioga County's CR33. The county highway passes a {{mountain}} to the west and the Owego River's west branch to the east as it heads northward. It crosses Boyer Creek as 76 Road and enters the hamlet of Speedsville, a small community located on top of a mountain. Here, CR115 turns to the northwest to run along the <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> valley surrounding Boyer Creek. The creek reaches its source at an intersection with Yaple Road; however, CR115 continues northwestward to serve the hamlet of Caroline Center.|$|E

40|$|AbstractA matroid may be {{characterized}} by the collection <b>of</b> its <b>bases</b> or by the collection of its circuits. Along with any matroid is a uniquely determined dual matroid. Given the <b>bases</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> matroid, {{it is possible to}} show that base complements are precisely the <b>bases</b> <b>of</b> the dual. So it is easy to construct <b>bases</b> <b>of</b> the dual given the <b>bases</b> <b>of</b> the original matroid. This paper provides two results. The first enables construction of all circuits of the dual matroid from circuits of the original matroid. The second constructs all <b>bases</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> matroid from its circuits...|$|R

It crosses under the Metro North tracks three times, including two one-lane underpasses with limited sight to the other side. It passes along the northern <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> small mountain and turns slightly southward. The highway turns due eastward and intersects with County Route64 in the hamlet of Towners. Just to the north is Mandel Pond, and the route makes a series of erratic turns around small mountains, passing south of Cornwall Hill as it does so. NY164 turns south-southeast and ends at NY22 in Patterson, east of the East Branch Croton River.|$|E

NY210 heads north from the state line along {{the western edge of the}} <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> deep valley {{surrounding}} the lake to a community known as Indian Park, entirely situated on the steep incline leading away from the lake.

5|$|The Solar updraft tower (SUT) is a renewable-energy {{power plant}} for {{generating}} electricity from low temperature solar heat. Sunshine heats the air beneath {{a very wide}} greenhouse-like roofed collector structure surrounding the central <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> very tall chimney tower. The resulting convection causes a hot air updraft in the tower by the chimney effect. This airflow drives wind turbines placed in the chimney updraft or around the chimney base to produce electricity. Plans for scaled-up versions of demonstration models will allow significant power generation, and may allow development of other applications, such as water extraction or distillation, and agriculture or horticulture.|$|E
