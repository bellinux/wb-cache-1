The recently proposed rakeness-based Compressed Sensing (RCS) offers high compression rate with an associated low computational power.

40|$|Technology scaling enables {{today the}} design of {{ultra-low}} cost wireless body sensor networks for wearable <b>biomedical</b> <b>monitors.</b> The typical behaviour of such systems consists of multi-channel input biosignals acquisition data compression and final output transmission or storage. To achieve minimal energy operation and extend battery life several aspects must be considered ranging from signal processing to architectural optimizations. The recently proposed Rakeness-based Compressed Sensing (CS) paradigm deploys the localization of input signal energy to further increase compression without sensible RSNR degradation.

40|$|The {{matched filter}} {{is a basic}} tool in the signal-processing toolset and is used in many diverse applica-tions from {{communications}} receivers to <b>biomedical</b> <b>monitors.</b> However, the matched filter is sensitive to impulsive interference which results in poor performance compared to its theoretical maximum for Gaussian noise. To address this problem, the affine order-statistic matched filter is introduced. Affine order-statistic filters are hybrid filters which consider the temporal and rank order of the observations. An affinity function is designed to weight {{the relative importance of}} temporal and dispersive sensitivity. However, finding the optimal affinity function for an application is a difficult analytic problem. In this paper, three affinity functions are considered which allow the affine order-statistic matched filter to be adapted from a linear matched filter to robust median filters.

40|$|The {{design of}} {{ultra-low}} cost wireless {{body sensor networks}} for wearable <b>biomedical</b> <b>monitors</b> has been made possible by today technology scaling. In these systems, a typically multi-channel biosignal sensor {{takes care of the}} operations of acquisition, data compression and final output transmission or storage.

In this paper we consider the recently proposed rakeness-based compressed sensing (CS) paradigm along with its zeroing companion. With respect to a standard CS base sensor, the first approach allows us to further increase compression rate without sensible signal quality degradation by exploiting localization of input signal energy. The latter paradigm is here formalized and applied to further reduce the energy consumption of the sensing node. The application of both rakeness and zeroing allows for trading off energy from the compression stage to the transmission or storage one.
