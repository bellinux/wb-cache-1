25|$|The {{riverbank}} {{is lined}} with woodlands and a particular feature are the ancient and large oaks, mostly pedunculate oak (Quercus robur) and associated fungi of ancient oaks, such as the <b>beefsteak</b> <b>fungus</b> (Fistulina hepatica). Some notable old syscamores or celtic maples (Acer pseudoplatanus) are also present.|$|E
2500|$|Examples of Australian native plant foods {{include the}} fruits quandong, kutjera, muntries, riberry, Davidson's plum, and finger lime. Native spices include lemon myrtle, {{mountain}} pepper, and aniseed myrtle. A popular leafy vegetable is warrigal greens. Nuts include bunya nut, {{and the most}} identifiable bush tucker plant harvested and sold in large-scale commercial quantities is the macadamia nut. Knowledge of Aboriginal uses of fungi is meagre but <b>beefsteak</b> <b>fungus</b> and native [...] "bread" [...] (a fungus also), were certainly eaten.|$|E
50|$|Also, {{some other}} quite {{distinctive}} fungi, the puffballs, and some clavaroid fungi, e.g. Typhula, and the <b>Beefsteak</b> <b>fungus</b> have been recently {{been shown to}} lie within the Agaricales.|$|E
50|$|The Fistulinaceae are {{a family}} of fungi, the best-known member {{of which is the}} <b>beefsteak</b> <b>fungus</b> Fistulina hepatica. Molecular studies have now shown it to lie within the Agaricales.|$|E

50|$|Spalting {{is divided}} into three main types: pigmentation, white rot and zone lines. Spalted wood may exhibit one or all of these types in varying degrees. Both {{hardwoods}} (deciduous) and softwoods (conifers) can spalt, but zone lines and white rot are more commonly found on hardwoods due to enzymatic differences in white rotting fungi. Brown rots are more common to conifers, although one brown rot, Fistulina hepatica (<b>beefsteak</b> <b>fungus),</b> is known to cause spalting.|$|E
50|$|Fistulina subhepatica is {{a species}} of fungus in the family Fistulinaceae. It is found in Yunnan Province in {{subtropical}} China, where it causes brown rot on Castanopsis and Lithocarpus. It was described as new to science in 2014 by Bao-Kai Cui and Jie Song. It is named for its resemblance to the common <b>beefsteak</b> <b>fungus,</b> Fistulina hepatica, from which it can be distinguished by its larger spores (measuring 4-6 by 3-4.5 Î¼m), and generative hyphae with clamp connections.|$|E

50|$|Fistulina hepatica (<b>beefsteak</b> <b>fungus,</b> {{also known}} as beefsteak polypore or ox tongue) is an unusual bracket fungus {{classified}} in the Agaricales, that is commonly seen in Britain, but {{can be found in}} North America, Australia, North Africa, and the rest of Europe. As its name suggests, it looks remarkably similar to a slab of raw meat. It {{has been used as a}} meat substitute in the past, and can still be found in some French markets. It has a sour, slightly acidic taste. For eating it must be collected young and it may be tough and need long cooking.|$|E
5000|$|Because {{bracket fungi}} {{are defined by}} their growth form rather than phylogeny, the group {{contains}} members of multiple clades. Although the term classically was reserved for polypores, molecular studies have revealed some odd relationships. The <b>beefsteak</b> <b>fungus,</b> a well-known bracket fungus, is actually {{a member of the}} agarics. Other examples of bracket fungi include the sulphur shelf, birch bracket, dryad's saddle, artist's conk, and turkey tail. The name polypores is often used for a group that includes many of the hard or leathery fungi, which often lack a stipe, growing straight out of wood. [...] "Polypore" [...] is derived from the Greek words poly, meaning [...] "much" [...] or [...] "many", and poros, meaning [...] "pore".|$|E
