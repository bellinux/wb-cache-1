5|$|Mining {{was carried}} out in Ruthwaite Cove, and the remains of several levels and some shallow open {{workings}} are visible near Ruthwaite Lodge. These excavations were made in a search for lead-bearing galena, and are believed to have <b>been</b> <b>worked</b> in the 16th century. Further leases were taken out in 1784 and 1862; the last known operation was in 1880.|$|E
5|$|On 17 March 2014 TDIC {{announced}} {{the completion of}} the first permanent gallery structure to mark {{the first anniversary of the}} start of construction. At this time, it was claimed that a total of ten million man hours had <b>been</b> <b>worked</b> and 120,538 cubic meters of concrete used.|$|E
50|$|The mine <b>was</b> <b>worked</b> further under lease by Henry R. Whittell {{and later}} by Ralph M. Robey, {{although}} it <b>was</b> often not <b>worked.</b> It <b>was</b> <b>worked</b> as South Hetton Colliery as late as 1906.|$|R
50|$|Whereas the PD&SWJR {{main line}} <b>was</b> <b>worked</b> by the LSWR ostensibly {{as part of}} its own system, the Callington branch <b>was</b> <b>worked</b> {{independently}} by the PD&SWJR.|$|R
50|$|Hot short iron can <b>be</b> <b>worked,</b> {{but it has}} to <b>be</b> <b>worked</b> at low {{temperatures}}. Working {{at lower}} temperatures requires more physical effort from the smith or forgeman. The metal must be struck more often and harder to achieve the same result. A mildly sulfur contaminated bar can <b>be</b> <b>worked,</b> but it requires a great deal more time and effort.|$|R
5|$|The poor {{condition}} of the Betelgeuse for which its operator, Total S.A., was to blame: Immediately before the incident, the vessel's hull and tanks were cracked, corroded, and leaking. The 11-year-old vessel had <b>been</b> <b>worked</b> hard and {{was at the end}} of her service life.|$|E
5|$|The site {{reverted to}} private {{ownership}} after the war. As the quarry {{had long since}} <b>been</b> <b>worked</b> out, it was abandoned. The tunnels were not destroyed but were sealed off, though at some point they were reopened by local people and could be entered; the octagon remained sealed off with a ceiling-to-floor barricade. The quarry itself remained in almost the same condition {{as it had been}} in 1944, with sections of railway track still in place on the quarry floor. The hospital section remained relatively intact and was used by the local gendarmes as a shooting range.|$|E
5|$|Winchelsey was {{a preacher}} of some note, and when preaching at St. Paul's he {{attracted}} large crowds to his sermons and lectures. Winchelsey's theological writings date primarily from {{his time at}} St. Paul's, where he delivered a number of quodibeta. The quaestiones disputatae from those sessions survive, and illustrate his highly orthodox trinitarian views and his scholastic method. Miracles {{were said to have}} <b>been</b> <b>worked</b> at his tomb in Canterbury cathedral, but efforts to have him declared a saint have been unsuccessful.|$|E

50|$|Sinking of the {{colliery}} commenced in {{the late}} 1840s with production commencing {{towards the end of}} 1850. The colliery was owned by Earl Fizwilliam, and <b>was</b> <b>worked</b> by Wakefield-based agents J. & J. Charlesworth & Company. Coal <b>was</b> <b>worked</b> from two seams, the 5 ft. seam <b>was</b> <b>worked</b> at a depth of 90 yards, the 9 ft. seam being found at 127 yards. These seams were connected by a shaft.|$|R
5|$|With {{the vocal}} tracks completed, a final {{mix of the}} album was {{undertaken}} with engineer Dick Meaney at the Church in Crouch End during the autumn of 1991; it was the nineteenth studio in which Loveless had <b>been</b> <b>worked</b> on. The album was edited on an aged machine {{that had previously been}} used to cut together dialog for movies in the 1970s. Its computer threw the entire album out of phase. Shields was able to put it back together from memory, yet when it came to mastering the album, to Creation's dismay, he needed 13 days, rather than the usual one day.|$|E
5|$|In 1945, SIRT {{purchased}} {{the property of}} the B and merged it with the Staten Island Railway. The line had <b>been</b> <b>worked</b> with B and SIRT equipment since it opened in 1890. By 1949, there were no longer any staffed offices along the line except at Arlington. All of the stations on the line, with the exception of Harbor Road, Lake Avenue, Livingston and Snug Harbor, had waiting rooms and agents. The stations without waiting rooms were flag stops; the train would only stop if there was someone waiting at the station. The station at Port Ivory, which was used for workers of the Procter & Gamble Plant and was only open for the morning and evening rush hour, closed around the year 1950.|$|E
5|$|Recording {{started in}} December 1971 at Morgan Studios, London. Unlike {{previous}} albums, where Anderson had generally written songs in advance, only the initial {{section of the}} album had <b>been</b> <b>worked</b> out when the band went into the studio. The remainder of the suite was written during the recording sessions. To compensate {{for a lack of}} material, Anderson got up early each morning to prepare music {{for the rest of the}} band to learn during that day's session. The lyrics were written first, with the music constructed to fit around them. Anderson recalls the album took about two weeks to record and another two or three for overdubs and mixing. The final work spanned the entire length of an LP record, split over two sides.|$|E
50|$|One {{metal that}} <b>is</b> <b>worked</b> <b>is</b> wrought iron, mostly for {{utilitarian}} items. In {{the communities of}} El Santuario and Mapethé, they made scrapers for maguey leaves, blades for plows, hoes and blades for scythes, knives, machetes and more. More iron <b>is</b> <b>worked</b> in Huasca de Ocampo and Molango.|$|R
50|$|Faccon SD666715Faccon was a {{very early}} {{colliery}} in Bentham. Coal outcropped by the River Greta and could <b>be</b> <b>worked</b> in shallow pits on Ingleton and Bentham Moors. The pits <b>were</b> <b>worked</b> by turntrees. The workings were levelled and landscaped in 1836.|$|R

5|$|Testing was, however, able to {{continue}} in the meantime, as Platt-LePage had re-negotiated the XR-1 contract to cover a second flight-test aircraft. Built to a revised and improved version of the XR-1's design and designated XR-1A, the second aircraft had flown {{for the first time in}} May 1943. The XR-1A featured a revised cockpit covering compared to that of the XR-1, with the area of glazing being increased for improved visibility, and the pilot and observer's positions being reversed, the pilot now seated in the rear cockpit. During flight testing the XR-1A was found superior in flight performance to the XR-1; however, the controls were still proving troublesome, although the worst of the bugs did seem to have <b>been</b> <b>worked</b> out.|$|E
5|$|The basic backing {{track was}} {{recorded}} at Olympic Sound Studios in Barnes on 6 May 1969. Recording started at 3pm {{and went on}} until 4am the next morning. McCartney sang lead and played piano, Lennon played an Epiphone Casino guitar, George Harrison played a Fender Telecaster guitar fed through a Leslie speaker, and Ringo Starr played drums. The group recorded 36 takes, selecting take 30 as the best, which {{was made into a}} rough stereo mix. The basic structure of the song as it appeared on Abbey Road had not <b>been</b> <b>worked</b> out at this stage, and the original recording ran onto a loose jam session, ending up as a fast rock-and-roll instrumental towards the end.|$|E

50|$|It is {{not clear}} exactly when the quarry ceased to <b>be</b> <b>worked.</b> Kellow states that it <b>was</b> <b>worked</b> from the bottom upwards for 33 years, which he says was the whole time that it <b>was</b> <b>worked,</b> and that {{production}} ceased mid way through World War I, as {{there was no longer}} a market for the slate products which it produced. The details in his autobiography were dictated from memory around 1941, by which time he was almost blind. Richards states that the quarry closed in 1920.|$|R
