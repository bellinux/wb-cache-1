40|$|The {{influence}} of the fin width on substrate-to-gate coupling in long-channel silicon-on-insulator triple-gate transistors is investigated. A complementary analysis, taking into account both the "front coupling" (variation of the front-channel threshold voltage V-T 1, {{as a function of}} the substrate bias V-G 2) and "back coupling" (variation of the back-channel threshold voltage V-T 2, {{as a function of the}} front-gate bias V-G 1) characteristics has been carried out. It is shown that the <b>back</b> <b>coupling,</b> as opposed to the front coupling, is highly sensitive to the fin width in narrow-channel devices and can even be used in fin width extraction. Simple analytical 2 -D models for the body potential, V-T 1, and V-T 2 have been developed to clarify the experimental data, showing in particular the gradual control of the back interface potential by the lateral gates in narrow fins.

40|$|SQUID (superconducting quantum {{interference}} device) microscopes are versatile {{instruments for}} biosensing applications, in particular for magnetic nanoparticle detection in immunoassay experiments. We {{are developing a}} SQUID microscope based on an HTS rf SQUID magnetometer sensor with a substrate resonator. For the cryogenic set-up, a configuration was realized in which the cryostat is continuously refilled and kept at a constant liquid nitrogen level by an isolated tube connection to a large liquid nitrogen reservoir. The SQUID is mounted {{on top of a}} sapphire finger, connected to the inner vessel of the stainless steel cryostat. The vacuum gap between the cold SQUID and room temperature sample is adjusted by the precise approach of a 50 mu m thin sapphire window using a single fine thread wheel. We investigated possible sensing tip configurations and different sensor integration techniques in order to achieve an optimized design. A new scheme of coupling the rf SQUID from its back to a SrTiO 3 substrate resonator was adopted for the purpose of minimization of the sensor-to-sample spacing. By SQUID substrate thinning and washer size reduction, the optimum coupling conditions for <b>back</b> <b>coupling</b> were determined for different rf SQUID magnetometers prepared on LaAlO 3 and SrTiO 3 substrates.

40|$|Abstract Since bibliometric {{indicators}} {{have obtained}} a general acceptance in science policy and attained applied relevance in research evaluation, feedback effects on scientists’ behaviour {{resulting from the}} use of these indicators for science funding decisions have been reported. These adaptation strategies could be called mimicry in science. Scientists apply strategies that should enable them to comply to bibliometric accountability and to secure funds to their own research. Keywords Research evaluation Mimicry Scientific progress Bibliometric data are being used by leading and fast-growing countries in science for research evaluation purposes. In UK the allocation of public funds to the universities will be mainly carried out according to these data. ‘‘The Government has a firm presumption that after the 2008 RAE [Research Assessment Exercise] the system for assessing research quality and allocating ‘quality-related ’ (QR) research funding to universities from the Department for Education and Skills will be mainly metrics-based’ ’ (UK Office of Science and Technology 2006). Due to this development ‘‘the death of peer review’ ’ in the allocation of research funds is being discussed (Gilbert 2006). The reason for the popularity of bibliometrics compared to peer review is seen in lower costs and criticism of the peer review system (Weingart 2005). In an ever more complex science system, bibliometric analysis should allow for evaluation of mass-data no longer understandable to the single reviewer (Butler 2004). <b>Back</b> <b>coupling</b> on scientists ’ behaviour Since bibliometric indicators have obtained a general acceptance in science policy and attained applied relevance in research evaluation, feedback effects on scientists ’ behaviou...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} modeling, analytical {{investigation and}} {{experimental study of}} a nonlinear hybrid energy harvesting system in the bi-stable configuration. Linear energy harvesters are frequency sensitive meaning they only generate reasonable power if they are excited accurately at their first natural frequency. Nonlinear effects {{can be used to}} increase the effective range of excitations frequency by broadening the frequency response. The proposed hybrid energy harvester uses Piezoelectric and Electromagnetic transduction mechanisms. Electromechanical coupling has been included {{in the study of the}} nonlinear dynamics of the harvester. The shooting method has been used to numerically calculate the limit cycles of the bi-stable system. The calculated limit cycles and the Poincare map of the system give the big picture of system vibrations due to the base accelerations. An approximation method is suggested using the method of multiple scales and verified by numerical integrations to find an equivalent forced, damped Duffing oscillator for the original harvesting system. The approximation results the equivalent mechanical system that acts similar to the coupled electromechanical harvester. The approximation is a function of the harvesting circuit so the <b>back</b> <b>coupling</b> is not overlooked. Meanwhile the amount of computations and the complexity of the problem are significantly reduced. The nonlinear vibration of the proposed nonlinear bi-stable harvester is also experimentally investigated. The study shows that the Limit Cycle Oscillations of the nonlinear system increase the power production by two orders of magnitude. The relations between the power output and the excitation level, the excitation frequency, and the electric loads are investigated...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn this paper, a {{modelling}} {{benchmark exercise}} from the DECOVALEX- 2011 project is presented. The benchmark {{is based on}} the performance and results of a laboratory drying test and of the ventilation experiment (VE) carried out in the Mont Terri Underground Rock Laboratory (URL). Both tests involve Opalinus clay. The work aims at the identification, understanding and quantification of mechanisms taking place during the ventilation of a gallery in argillaceous host rocks on one hand and at investigating the capacity of different codes and individuals to reproduce these processes on the other hand. The 4 -year in situ VE took place in a 1. 3 m diameter unlined tunnel and included two resaturation–desaturation cycles. The test area was equipped with over one hundred sensors (including the global water mass balance of the system, relative humidity (RH), water content, liquid pressure, relative displacement and concentration of some chemical species) to monitor the rock behaviour during ventilation. The laboratory drying experiment, carried out before the VE, was designed to mimic the in situ conditions. The work was organized in a progressive manner in terms of complexity of the computations to be performed, geared towards the full hydro-mechano-chemical (HMC) understanding of the VE, the final objective. The main results from the modelling work reported herein are that the response of the host rock to ventilation in argillaceous rocks is mainly governed by hydraulic processes (advective Darcy flow and non-advective vapour diffusion) and that the hydro-mechanical (TM) <b>back</b> <b>coupling</b> is weak. A ventilation experiment may thus be regarded as a large scale-long time pump test and it is used to determine the hydraulic conductivity of the rock mass...|$|E
40|$|The correct signal {{processing}} of neuronal signals requires coordination of {{different groups of}} neurons. To achieve this {{there has to be}} a connection between those neurons. This connection and especially the strength of the connection is not known a priori and can only be measured directly in rare cases. In this thesis I present three publications (Rosjat et al., 2014; Tóth et al., 2015; Popovych et al., under review) and the results from two additional studies focussing on the analysis of couplings in experimental measured neuronal activities. The publications can be divided into investigations of intrinsic, as well as extrinsic intra- and intersegmental connections in the stick insect Carausius morosus and into analysis and mathematical modeling of couplings from EEG-measurements of the human brain while subjects were performing different tasks. In both parts I made use of mathematical models to build hypotheses about so far unknown coupling mechanisms. The first study deals with connectivity changes in the thalamo-cortical loop caused by schizophrenia (Rosjat et al., 2014). To build a mathematical model consisting of neural populations representing the thalamus and the auditory cortex we made use of published EEG-data, which were collected while subjects performed a double-click paradigm. The individual populations comprised a large number of phase oscillators with continuously distributed natural frequencies. Applying reduction methods by Pikovsky and Rosenblum, Ott and Antonsen together with the reduction method by Watanabe and Strogatz we investigated the influences of the bidirectional connections between the brain areas on the synchronization of the neuronal populations. The model was able to replicate the experimental data adequately. We observed that the coupling strength from the thalamic region to the cortical region mainly affected the duration of synchrony while the feedback to the thalamic region had a bigger effect on the strength of synchrony. This led to the hypothesis that the <b>back</b> <b>coupling</b> to the thalamic region might be reduced in schizophrenia patients. The second study will show an analysis of intersegmental couplings in the protractorretractor system of the pro- and mesothoracic ganglion of the stick insect Carausius morosus using mathematical models based on experimental data (Tóth et al., 2015). We made use of phase-response curves that were calculated experimentally on the one hand and simulated by mathematical models on the other hand to determine the nature and the strength of their connection. We showed that connections on both sides from the prothoracic to the mesothoracic network were necessary to achieve a good agreement with the experimental phase-response curves. Additionally, it was found that the strength of the excitatory connection played a key role, while the strength of the inhibitory connection did not have a big influence on the shape of the phase-response curves. The third study deals with the identification of a neuronal marker of movement execution (Popovych et al., under review). In this work we investigated the influence of internally and externally triggered movement on the phase synchronization in the motor system. We tested the signals, that were recorded from electrodes lying above the motor cortex, in the phase space including the major frequency bands (delta-, theta-, alpha-, beta- and low gamma-frequencies) for inter-trial phase synchrony. The study revealed a strong lateralized phase synchronization in the lower frequency bands (delta and theta) in the electrodes above the contralateral primary motor cortex independent of the hand performing and the cue triggering the movement. The results suggest that this phase synchronization could serve as an electrophysiological marker of movement execution additionally to the well established event-related desynchronization and event-related synchronization that are based on the amplitude changes in alpha- and beta- frequency bands...|$|E
