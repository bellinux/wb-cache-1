50|$|Single bevel knives are knives {{made in the}} Japanese {{tradition}} and have an omote (front or face on the right for right-handers), a shinogi (where the front bevel meets the flat of the <b>blade</b> <b>face),</b> and a urasuki (backside hollow to release food). These knives are usually a little thicker at the spine and body than Japanese double bevels but are thinner right behind the edge. They leave a better surface finish but the produce must bend a further distance due to the thickness. These are the knives of the established traditional Japanese cuisine and were originally developed from double bevel knives from China. They are sharpened along the single bevel by applying pressure to the shinogi to raise it and to the edge. Honbadzuke is the initial sharpening to form a flat surface along {{the perimeter of the}} urasuki to strengthen it, straighten the backside, and lay geometry for future sharpening. The omote is sharpened much more than the urasuki {{in order to maintain the}} function of the single bevel. Kansai style knives usually have pointed tip for use standing up (which helps in decorative tip work) and Edo style knives have a square tip for use sitting down (which makes a more robust working knife). The standard Japanese knife kit includes the yanagiba, deba, and usuba. They are essential to Washoku (Japanese cuisine).|$|E
40|$|The main {{difficulty}} is that blade is a highly dynamic moving object. This work suggests two-channel measuring system of helicopter blades position. This measuring system consists of strain-gauge and optical measuring channels. The optical measuring system is based on high-speed camera and computer unit, which processes received video frames with blade image. The strain-gauge measuring system consists of strain sen- sors (located on the <b>blade</b> <b>face)</b> and of strain-gauge station, which records measurements and transmits them to the comput- er unit via radio channel for further analysis. The two-channel system concept was designed and device-algorithmic part of optical and strain-gauge channels was developed. Problems of the optical measuring channel, connected with low image contrast between blade and image back- ground, blades identification and their position estimation were solved. For the strain-gauge measuring channel, a model of measurement translation from intrinsic frame of reference into helicopter frame of reference was suggested and measure- ment transmission system via radio channel to the computer unit was developed. The operational integrity and physical realizability of suggested two-channel system on research facility unit were inquired. The optical channel made measurements of two blades location, the strain-gauge channel made measurements only of that blade which had been equipped with sensors. The results of the research validated physical realizability of sug-gested two-channel measuring system...|$|E

50|$|Furling {{works by}} {{decreasing}} {{the angle of}} attack, which reduces the induced drag from the lift of the rotor, {{as well as the}} cross-section. One major problem in designing wind turbines is getting the blades to stall or furl quickly enough should a gust of wind cause sudden acceleration. A fully furled turbine blade, when stopped, has the edge of the <b>blade</b> <b>facing</b> into the wind.|$|R

At this point, the goaltender may roll back onto the puck-side skate <b>blade,</b> <b>facing</b> the shooter in the familiar ready stance.|$|R
50|$|Stalling {{works by}} {{increasing}} the angle at which the relative wind strikes the blades (angle of attack), and it reduces the induced drag (drag associated with lift). Stalling is simple {{because it can be}} made to happen passively (it increases automatically when the winds speed up), but it increases the cross-section of the blade face-on to the wind, and thus the ordinary drag. A fully stalled turbine blade, when stopped, has the flat side of the <b>blade</b> <b>facing</b> directly into the wind.|$|R

25|$|The rise in {{popularity}} of katana amongst samurai came about {{due to the}} changing nature of close-combat warfare. The quicker draw of the sword was well suited to combat where victory depended heavily on short response times. The katana further facilitated this by being worn thrust through a belt-like sash (obi) with the sharpened edge facing up. Ideally, samurai could draw the sword and strike the enemy in a single motion. Previously, the curved tachi had been worn with the edge of the <b>blade</b> <b>facing</b> down and suspended from a belt.|$|R
40|$|The {{forces on}} a turbine at extreme wind {{conditions}} when the turbine is parked {{is one of}} the most important design cases for the survivability of a turbine. In this work, the forces on a blade and its support arms have been measured on a 12 kW straight-bladed vertical axis wind turbine at an open site. Two cases are tested: one during electrical braking of the turbine, which allows it to rotate slowly, and one with the turbine mechanically fixed with the leading edge of the <b>blade</b> <b>facing</b> the main wind direction. The force variations with respect to wind direction are investigated, and it is seen that significant variations in forces depend on the wind direction. The measurements show that for the fixed case, when subjected to the same wind speed, the forces are lower when the <b>blade</b> <b>faces</b> the wind direction. The results also show that due to the lower forces at this particular wind direction, the average forces for the fixed blade are notably lower. Hence, it is possible to reduce the forces on a turbine blade, simply by taking the dominating wind direction into account when the turbine is parked. The measurements also show that a positive torque is generated from the blade for most wind directions, which causes the turbine to rotate in the electrically-braked case. These rotations will cause increased fatigue loads on the turbine blade...|$|R

The blade is forged from pamor steel or Damascus steel. The tip of the blade tapers like a knife, but does so to appear as if it is held backwards (i.e. the <b>blade</b> <b>faces</b> the wielder). The luwuk's handle is made from wood or animal horn. Overall length of the luwuk is not more than 85 centimeters.|$|R
5000|$|Strob Saw Blades are {{circular}} saw blades {{with the addition}} of two or more specialised raker/cutters and were invented by Keene S. Strobel (1907 - 1989) of Everett and Peter E. Heiser of Issaquah. [...] These rakers are fitted on the trailing edges of more-or-less radial slots cut in the blade and are designed to reduce friction and rapidly eject sawdust, thereby preventing scorching and distortion of the <b>blade</b> <b>faces,</b> improving cutting efficiency and reducing sharpening frequency. Weyerhaeuser were granted a patent on strob saw blades in 1971, but there has been little improvement in the design since then.|$|R
40|$|The blade {{behavior}} in the outer-blade slicing has been analyzed by computer simulation to clarify the machining mechanism. The main results obtained are as follows. (1) The blade deflection comes from a small lateral grinding force on the blade outer edge, and it is enlarged by the lateral grinding force on the <b>blade</b> side <b>face.</b> (2) The lateral grinding force on the <b>blade</b> side <b>face</b> takes the maximum value when the contact arc length between blade and workpiece tends to decrease in the machining process. (3) In {{the case that the}} blade was deflected in the machining process, the cutoff surface form obtained on the deflection side of the blade becomes concave and a large kerfloss occurs on this side. By contrast, the cutoff surface on the opposite side has a uniformly flat surface. (4) The values of lateral grinding force, blade deflection, waviness of cutoff surface and kerfloss increase with the asymmetric shape factor of blade, the speed ratio, the average tip angle of the grains on the <b>blade</b> side <b>face</b> and the inverse of blade thickness...|$|R

50|$|A single {{slip switch}} works on the same {{principle}} as a double slip, but provides for only one switching possibility. Trains approaching {{on one of the}} two crossing tracks can either continue over the crossing, or switch tracks to the other line. However, trains from the other track can only continue over the crossing, and cannot switch tracks. This is normally used to allow access to sidings and improve safety by avoiding having switch <b>blades</b> <b>facing</b> the usual direction of traffic. To reach the sidings from what would be a facing direction, trains must continue over the crossing, then reverse along the curved route (usually onto the other line of a double track) and can then move forward over the crossing into the siding.|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the asymmetry of thermal conditions during directional solidification, the temperature evolution and correspondingly developed undercooling in a simplified single crystal blade cluster were numerically simulated. Simulation results demonstrate that the temperature distribution at the blade platforms is obviously asymmetrical. On {{the outside of the}} <b>blade</b> which directly <b>faces</b> the heating element, the liquidus (TL) isotherms progress relatively smoothly. On the inside of the <b>blades</b> <b>facing</b> the central rod, however, the TL-isotherms are in concave shape and the slope goes upwards to the platform extremities. The average undercooling extent ΔT and undercooling time Δt at the inside are much higher than those at the outside. It was then predicted that the inside platform extremities have significantly higher probabilities of stray grain formation compared to the outside ones. A corresponding experiment was carried out and the metallographic examination exhibited the same side- and height-dependence of stray grain formation in the blades as predicted. On the inside of the blades, all platforms are occupied by stray grains, while the platforms on the outside are nearly stray grain free. The simulation result agrees very well with the experimental observation...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a geometric modeling method and 5 -axis CNC machining algorithm for {{the manufacture of}} screw propellers in one single setup. A novel approach for 5 -axis roughing is developed and implemented in addition to further streamline finishing sequences. The toolpath is generated by dividing the propeller model into milling regions viz. the front & rear <b>blade</b> <b>faces,</b> the leading & trailing blade edges and the lateral hub surfaces between adjacent blades. Cutting tools for each region are then selected along with the appropriate tool orientation for 5 -axis flank milling. The CL-data is acquired using Unigraphics TM and translated into NC code using a postprocessor for the Maho MH 600 E milling machine. The viability of the proposed method is verified by virtual machining on Vericut TM and actual machining on Maho MH 600 E.
