5|$|With {{the dawn}} of the Interstate Highway System {{following}} World War II, new highways were constructed in the region. A series of <b>bridges</b> <b>and</b> <b>tunnels,</b> constructed during fifteen years, linked Norfolk with the Peninsula, Portsmouth, and Virginia Beach. In 1952, the Downtown Tunnel opened to connect Norfolk with the city of Portsmouth. The highways also stimulated the development of new housing suburbs, leading to the population spreading out. Additional <b>bridges</b> <b>and</b> <b>tunnels</b> included the Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel in 1957, the Midtown Tunnel in 1962, and the Virginia Beach-Norfolk Expressway (Interstate 264 and State Route 44) in 1967. In 1991, the new Downtown Tunnel/Berkley Bridge complex opened a new system of multiple lanes of highway and interchanges connecting Downtown Norfolk and Interstate 464 with the Downtown Tunnel tubes.|$|E

5|$|Many {{buildings}} did {{not hold}} up to the shaking of the earthquake and those that did collapse often lacked any survival space, but lack of effective medical care and poor planning {{also contributed to the}} substantial scope of the disaster. Buildings that didn't collapse featured well-maintained masonry and skeletal components that were joined together adequately in a way that allowed for the building to resist seismic waves. Most <b>bridges</b> <b>and</b> <b>tunnels</b> and other public infrastructure withstood the earthquake but hospitals did not fare well. Most collapsed, killing two-thirds of the doctors, destroying equipment and medicine, and reducing the capacity to handle the critical medical needs in the region.|$|E
5|$|Suitable {{work for}} the class began to decline under British Railways {{ownership}} after the widening of <b>bridges</b> <b>and</b> <b>tunnels</b> on the Hastings line, which enabled Bulleid's powerful Q1class 0-6-0 to be used on freight trains between Hastings and Tonbridge. Following {{the completion of the}} Kent Coast electrification in 1959, the class was congregated at Tonbridge shed alongside members of the U1class to haul local services throughout the Central section. The reduction of work over the Brighton main line and the prevalence of the N class precipitated another move to Stewarts Lane shed in London. However, with remaining work being allocated to Bulleid's Light Pacifics, the class was withdrawn from service in November 1962.|$|E

5|$|The Nclass {{was also}} {{successful}} on the Central section, where they worked alongside L. B. Billinton's LB K class 2-6-0s. However the large cylinder and cab sizes of the Nclass prevented {{use of the}} type on the Eastern section's TonbridgeHastings line. The route's narrow <b>bridges</b> <b>and</b> <b>tunnels</b> were unable to accommodate the class, and provided justification for using the narrower 3-cylinder N1 class 2-6-0 on the route. Despite these restrictions, the class was capable of hauling heavy loads at moderate speeds, a useful attribute that was exploited throughout the Second World War. The entire class came into British Railways' ownership in 1948 and {{could be seen in}} most areas of the Southern Region.|$|E
5|$|In 1932, the Southern Railway {{ordered a}} final batch of 15 {{locomotives}} (Nos.14001414) to expand class availability on the Southern Railway's network. These were built at Ashford works and {{differed from the}} previous 65 {{in a number of}} ways. The cabs of the final eight locomotives (Nos.14071414) were fitted for left-hand driving, which was adopted as standard by the Southern Railway. The original Nclass chimney was replaced with the lower-profile version used on the U1class, which increased route availability by allowing the locomotives to pass under lower <b>bridges</b> <b>and</b> <b>tunnels.</b> Maunsell had begun to research smoke deflection techniques to improve driver visibility on the King Arthur class between 1926 and 1927, which resulted in the adoption of a standard smoke deflector design for the Southern Railway. A smaller version was fitted to Nos.14001414 during building.|$|E

5|$|Bradley {{raised the}} {{possibility}} of using nuclear weapons in Korea at a Joint Chiefs of Staff meeting on 9 July 1950 at Eisenhower's instigation, but there was no support for the idea. The Army staff sent a cable to Collins in Tokyo suggesting that he seek out MacArthur's opinion. In a teleconference on 13 July, Major General Charles L. Bolte proposed sending nuclear weapons. MacArthur had already turned down Air Force proposals to fire bomb North Korean cities, and suggested that atomic bombs could be used to isolate North Korea by taking out <b>bridges</b> <b>and</b> <b>tunnels.</b> The Army staff considered this impractical. However, on 28 July, the Joint Chiefs decided to send ten nuclear-capable B-29 bombers of the 9th Bombardment Wing to Guam as a deterrent to Chinese action against Taiwan. Truman publicly denied that he was considering the use of nuclear weapons in Korea, but authorised the transfer to Guam of atomic bombs without their fissile cores. The deployment did not go well; one of the bombers crashed on takeoff from Fairfield-Suisun Air Force Base in California on 5 August, killing the mission commander, Brigadier General Robert F. Travis, and 18 others. The remaining nine bombers remained in Guam until 13 September, when they returned to the United States. The bomb assemblies stayed behind.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{began on}} July 1, 1928, with convict labor for the easier {{portions}} and contractors for the remainder, {{as well as}} <b>bridges</b> <b>and</b> <b>tunnels,</b> but was slowed by the Great Depression. On the most difficult portion, between Cresta and Rock Creek, three tunnels had to be built at Arch Rock, Grizzly Dome, and Elephant Butte; at the former two, surveyors had to hang out on rope over steep granite slopes, and rockslides repeatedly caused delays. The commission dedicated the road at a ceremony at Grizzly Dome, halfway between the ends, on August 14, 1937. Construction had cost $8.15 million for 78 miles (126km) of new road. The remainder of the old trail from Quincy to the junction with Route 29 (now U.S. 395) east of Beckwourth Pass {{was added to the}} state highway system in 1931 as an extension of Route 21, and was paved by 1936. A new Route 87 was created in 1933, stretching from Woodland via Marysville and Oroville to Route 3 (State Route 99) southeast of Chico, including the present SR 70 between Marysville and Oroville. Route 87 from Woodland to Oroville and Route 21 from Oroville to east of Beckwourth Pass became a new State Route 24 in 1934; State Route 24 was extended southwest from Woodland to Oakland by the end of 1937.|$|E
5|$|With the Autobots gone, the Decepticons {{launch a}} {{full-scale}} assault on New York City, randomly annihilating buildings and causing mayhem {{as part of}} a simultaneous galaxy-wide assault. The initial human aerial counterattack is annihilated. Even opposed by Colonel Daniel Witwicky, the Decepticons decimate all further military assaults and destroy all <b>bridges</b> <b>and</b> <b>tunnels</b> leading into the city. The Decepticon assault moves to other cities in the country, including Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C., as the Constructicons begin to build in what was once Manhattan. On Cybertron, the dispirited and beaten Autobots begin to fall apart as Ironhide clashes with Prowl over the traitor in their midst. Another group of Autobots under Kup's command crashed on the planet after the Decepticons gained the access codes, where it is revealed that the situation is grave: Megatron has taken the Matrix. The humans attempt to send in a small commando team to assassinate Megatron, but the party is killed by Ratbat before even making across the river - all save their commander Spike. As the Decepticon assault spreads to other parts of Earth, the Decepticons begin to fall apart internally, with even Megatron worrying about the leadership challenges he will face now they have no enemy. The slaughter in Israel and Beijing worries other nations enough for them to contemplate using nuclear weapons on New York. On Cybertron the Swarm emerge, forcing the Autobots to flee once more.|$|E

50|$|For some time, the <b>bridge</b> <b>and</b> <b>tunnel</b> {{were not}} used for regular {{passenger}} services, and traffic over the bridge was largely limited to freight traffic and for shunting of engines between Connolly and Heuston. An exception to this was occasional match-day services carrying Gaelic Athletic Association fans from southern lines to Connolly Station for Croke Park stadium. However, from the early 21st century, rail transport planners and interest groups such as Platform 11 debated {{the use of the}} <b>bridge</b> <b>and</b> <b>tunnel</b> to link the operationally separate passenger lines which then terminated at Heuston and Connolly stations.
