5|$|In {{designing}} the game mechanics, Naka {{was inspired by}} Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto, whose games he had enjoyed playing years earlier. Admiring the simplicity of Miyamoto's mechanics in complex environments, Naka decided that Sonic would be controlled with only a directional pad for movement and a single <b>button</b> <b>for</b> jumping. He also wanted his creation to be more action-oriented than the Mario series; while playing Super Mario Bros., he had wondered why the levels could not be cleared more quickly.|$|E
5|$|Murphy {{developed}} his eponymous anastomotic <b>button</b> <b>for</b> a sutureless anastomosis of the gallbladder to the duodenum (his preferred treatment for acute cholecystitis), {{but it was}} equally suitable for intestinal anastomoses. He developed it in the experimental animal laboratory in a barn behind his house and first used it {{less than a week}} after developing it on a dog. The Murphy button can be credited as the forerunner of the modern end-to-end stapling instrument after having become the method of choice for operations at the Mayo Clinic and elsewhere in the United States for over twenty years.|$|E

5|$|Schumacher {{moved up}} a {{position}} as he passed <b>Button</b> <b>for</b> fifth position at turn three on the same lap. On lap twenty-eight, Trulli drove back to his garage to retire with a hydraulics failure that was caused by his power steering becoming heavy during the safety car period. Vettel set a new fastest lap of the race of 1:54.098, extending his lead over Alonso to 3.5 seconds. Button, who was under pressure from Hülkenberg and Kubica, made a pit stop {{at the end of}} lap twenty-eight for intermediate tyres and rejoined in fifteenth place. Kovalainen was sent into a spin by Buemi, having been passed by Petrov two laps later.|$|E
5|$|The player {{controls}} {{a yellow}} knight riding a flying ostrich or stork, from a third-person perspective. Using the two-way directional joystick and the <b>button</b> <b>for</b> flapping the ostrich's wings, the player flies the knight amidst the floating rock platforms and above pools of lava; when maneuvering {{off the screen}} to either side, the player will continue its path reappearing from the opposite side. The {{rate at which the}} player repeatedly presses the button causes the ostrich to fly upward, hover, or slowly descend.|$|E
5|$|They {{also agreed}} to fixed limits on how many pop-ups they can {{generate}} on a computer (maximum of 5 per day, 1 per hour), the requirement to provide a mute <b>button</b> <b>for</b> any sound content in the pop-ups {{and be able to}} close the windows, and provide a hyperlink with toll-free number and email utility, to request stopping the pop-ups under certain conditions.

5|$|Coulthard {{set a new}} fastest lap of the race, a 1:40.679 on lap {{seven and}} {{extended}} his lead from Michael Schumacher to 3.6 seconds, who in turn was 2.6 seconds ahead of teammate Barrichello. Wurz was a further 4.2 seconds behind Barrichello but was gradually drawing ahead of Villeneuve in fifth. Verstappen continued to gain positions after passing Fisichella for eleventh. Frentzen became the event's fourth retirement with electrical issues on lap seven. Trulli passed Mazzacane for 16th position one lap later. Salo took Herbert for eighth position on lap 9, while Ralf Schumacher's car began to develop mechanical issues. On the tenth lap, Coulthard ran off the track at turn six, with debris penerating his left-hand radiator. Further down the field, Gené lost 13th position to Alesi, as Trulli made a pit stop for further repairs to his car. By the start of lap twelve, Häkkinen had built a 5.6-second gap over Michael Schumacher, with Verstappen taking <b>Button</b> <b>for</b> tenth position. Häkkinen moved into 14th place after passing Ralf Schumacher and Gené {{within the next two}} laps.|$|E
5|$|Following the Monaco Grand Prix on 4 June, {{the teams}} {{conducted}} testing sessions at the Autodromo Nazionale Monza between 6–8 June {{to prepare for}} the Canadian Grand Prix. Barrichello set the first day's fastest times, ahead of McLaren test driver Olivier Panis. Testing was halted when Nick Heidfeld and Luciano Burti both experienced engine and electronic failures respectively. Häkkinen was fastest on the second day. BAR's Ricardo Zonta lost control of his car and crashed into the barriers at the Parabolica corner, limiting his testing time as repairs were made to his car. Jenson <b>Button</b> <b>for</b> Williams was quickest on the third day. Ferrari undertook additional testing at their private facility, the Fiorano Circuit, with their test driver Luca Badoer who performed practice pit stops and starts, utilising different car set-ups, testing new car components and ran on an artificially wet track.|$|E
5|$|Ferrari ordered Massa {{to reduce}} his car speed on his out-lap to help Alonso {{minimise}} the effects of losing second position. Glock drove back to his pit box where his mechanics examined his car for damage and decided to retire him from the race. Kubica avoided making contact with Sutil when his lollipop man stopped him before he could drive away from his pit box. It {{was the second time}} that season Kubica and Sutil were involved in an incident in a pit lane; Kubica had made contact with Sutil when the latter was driving into his pit box in the Hungarian Grand Prix. The safety car drove into the pit lane {{at the end of the}} thirty-fourth lap and Vettel led at the restart. Hamilton ran deep, heading into the first corner and allowing Alonso to retake second position and immediately came under attack from Massa. Kubica took eighth place from Hülkenberg by taking the inside line at the third corner. Sutil took to the inside line and passed <b>Button</b> <b>for</b> twelfth on lap thirty-six. Button was pushed wide onto the run-off area and fell to fifteenth position.|$|E

5|$|If {{the player}} {{successfully}} matches {{a number of}} consecutive notes correctly, they boost their individual scoring multiplier up to a maximum 4x value; missing a note will reset to the multiplier back to 1x. Throughout each song's respective charts for the instruments are special highlighted phrases; completing all the notes in this phrase, and for guitar/bass players, using the whammy bar on marked sustained notes, fills part of a Star Power meter. When this meter is at least half full, the player can activate Star Power by performing special actions on their controllers: either tilting the guitar controller upward briefly or pressing the Star Power activation <b>button</b> <b>for</b> guitar and bass; striking two pads simultaneously on the drums; and either double tapping the microphone or pressing one of the buttons on the game console's regular controllers for vocals. When Star Power is activated, the overall band scoring multiplier is increased for a limited time until the Star Power meter is drained. After completing a song, the band is awarded a number of stars based on the overall score; in normal modes for Warriors of Rock, up to six stars can be earned; the final being achievable only through zero misses and zero extra strums.|$|E
5|$|Regular pit stops {{started on}} lap eleven, with Massa, Kvyat, Pérez and Grosjean {{being the first}} to come in. In addition, Nico Hülkenberg made a pit stop and exited ahead of both Massa and Kvyat, who both had been {{in front of him}} before their {{respective}} stops. Bottas came in a lap later and maintained position. Kimi Räikkönen, who had been complaining about lack of grip in his front tyres, made a pit stop on lap 13. Race leader Rosberg came in for his tyre change on lap fourteen, simultaneously with Vettel, while Hamilton stayed out for another lap. He was ultimately unable to use his additional lap to come out in front of his teammate and remained second. On lap 18, Nico Hülkenberg, who was suffering from an unstable car, overtook Maldonado for sixth place. Around lap 20, Hamilton was moving closer to Rosberg, being in DRS range for multiple laps before reporting to the garage that his tyres would not last long and eased up. On lap 22, Kvyat moved ahead of Maldonado as well and was now seventh. Lap 24 witnessed Massa go around Maldonado as well, while Felipe Nasr overtook <b>Button</b> <b>for</b> 14th.|$|E
5|$|The Binding of Isaac is a {{top-down}} dungeon crawler game, presented using two-dimensional sprites, {{in which}} the player controls Isaac or other unlockable characters as they explore the dungeons located in Isaac's basement. The characters differ in speed, amount of health, amount of damage they deal, and other attributes. The game's mechanics and presentation {{is similar to the}} dungeons of The Legend of Zelda, while incorporating random, procedurally-generated levels {{in the manner of a}} roguelike game. On each floor of the basement dungeon, the player must fight monsters in a room before continuing onto the next room. This is most commonly done by the character's tears as bullets in the style of a twin-stick shooter, but the player can also use a limited supply of bombs to damage enemies and clear out parts of the room. Other methods of defeating enemies become possible as the character gains power-ups, items that are automatically worn by the player-character when picked up that can alter the character's core attributes, such as increasing health or the strength of each tear, or cause additional side effects, such as for allowing charged tear shots to be fired after holding down a controller <b>button</b> <b>for</b> a short while, or a means to fire tears behind the character. Power-ups include passive items that improve the character's attributes automatically, active power-ups that can be used once before they are recharged by completing additional rooms in the dungeon, and single-use power-ups such as pills or Tarot cards that confer a one-time benefit when used, such as regaining full health, or increasing or decreasing all attributes of the character. The effect of power-ups stack, so that the player may come into highly-beneficial power-up combinations.|$|E

25|$|In 1861 {{the first}} time limits, using sandglasses, were {{employed}} in a tournament match at Bristol, England. The sandglasses were later replaced by pendulums. Modern clocks, consisting of two parallel timers with a small <b>button</b> <b>for</b> a player to press after completing a move, were later employed to aid the players. A tiny latch called a flag further helped settle arguments over players exceeding time limit {{at the turn of}} the 19th century.|$|E
25|$|The 350-16 had an {{interesting}} bug where, occasionally, the machine would just freeze entirely and not even boot up if turned off and on at the mains. Although it would power on, the BIOS just didn't start. The solution was {{to turn on the}} machine at the mains and hold down the power <b>button</b> <b>for</b> 30 seconds, at which point it would normally start. It was suggested that this was due to an under-valued capacitor in the power circuit. This problem appeared to be resolved in the 350-40, which had a different PSU.|$|E
