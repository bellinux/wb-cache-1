5|$|Because I {{always try}} {{so hard to}} win and had my {{troubles}} in Boston, I was suspended. At playoff time it hurts {{not be in the}} game with the boys. However, I want to do what is good for the people of Montreal and the team. So that no further harm will be done, I would like to ask everyone to get behind the team and to help the boys win from the New York Rangers and Detroit. I will take my punishment and come <b>back</b> <b>next</b> <b>year</b> to help the club and the younger players to win the Cup.|$|E
25|$|In February 1942, Clapper {{suffered}} a severed tendon in {{a collision with}} Toronto player Bingo Kampman and was done for the season. It was feared he would be forced into retirement, but he came <b>back</b> <b>next</b> <b>year</b> and returned to form. During the 1944 season, Clapper broke Hooley Smith's career record for games played, holding the record until Maurice Richard surpassed him in 1957.|$|E
500|$|The mob of over 20,000 people {{developed}} into a riot. Windows and doors were smashed at the Forum and surrounding businesses. By the following morning, between 65 and 70 had been arrested. Over 50 stores were looted and 37 people injured. Damage was estimated at $100,000 ($ in [...] dollars). Richard had also attended the game, but left immediately following the forfeit. Frank Selke attempted {{to persuade him to}} return to try to disperse the crowd, but Richard refused, fearing that he would instead further inflame the passions of the mob. He took to the radio the next day asking for calm: [...] "Do no more harm. Get behind the team in the playoffs. I will take my punishment and come <b>back</b> <b>next</b> <b>year</b> and help the club and the younger players to win the Cup." ...|$|E
50|$|As a freshman, he {{appeared}} in every game as a backup running <b>back.</b> The <b>next</b> <b>year,</b> he was converted into a wide receiver, posting 18 receptions for 318 yards (17.7 average) and 4 touchdowns.|$|R
50|$|In 1793, the Spanish again besieged and {{occupied}} Collioure, which General Dugommier took <b>back</b> the <b>next</b> <b>year.</b> He captured Fort Saint-Elme on 25 May {{and forced the}} Spanish general Eugenio Navarro to surrender the next day.|$|R

500|$|In {{the early}} 1930s, Cowan became Manchester City captain, {{succeeding}} Jimmy McMullan. During his captaincy the club reached two further FA Cup Finals. The {{first of these}} was in 1933, against Everton. During the match Cowan was up against Everton captain Dixie Dean. Both players were renowned for their heading ability. Matt Busby claimed that Cowan could [...] "head a ball as far as most of us could kick it", but Dean prevailed in the aerial battle, scoring Everton's second goal with a header. The Daily Mail observed that Dean's presence gave Cowan a dilemma: [...] "He was torn between a determination not to leave Dean {{and a desire to}} help his forwards. He broke down between the two." [...] Everton were 3–0 victors, but when Cowan received his runner's up medal from the Duke of York, he remarked that he would come <b>back</b> <b>next</b> <b>year</b> to win. True to Cowan's word, City returned to Wembley the following year. In the 1934 FA Cup Final, Cowan became the first and thus far only Manchester City player to represent the club in three FA Cup finals. He captained City to a 2–1 victory over Portsmouth. As team captain Cowan held primary responsibility for motivating his fellow players and match tactics. This was typical for a captain of his era, as managers of the period were chiefly administrators who had little input into coaching and tactics.|$|E
500|$|At {{the start}} of the 2009–10 season, Filatov made the Blue Jackets roster after {{training}} camp. Although healthy, he did not play in six of the team's first 18 games, a decision made by Columbus Head Coach Ken Hitchcock. Filatov was unhappy with his playing time and role on the team under Hitchcock and requested to be transferred back to his Russian club team. Hitchcock and the Blue Jackets coaching staff tried to improve Filatov's attention to defensive aspects of the game. [...] The Blue Jackets management agreed to Filatov's request to return to Russia {{for the remainder of the}} season. This arrangement resulted from direct dealings between the Blue Jackets and CSKA Moscow, where Filatov's salary was paid by the Russian club, and the Blue Jackets retained his rights. Shortly after his return to Russia, Filatov set a KHL record by scoring the game-winning goal in three consecutive games. He was named the League's best newcomer (defined by the KHL as [...] "a player born in 1987 or later, who has played no more than 20 top-level matches in previous national tournaments") for November, and the League's best rookie for the 11th week of the season. In his shortened season in Russia, Filatov played 26 games, scoring nine goals and adding 13 assists. Initial statements by both sides indicated the player would return to Columbus after the 2009–10 season, but since returning to Russia, Filatov has been less clear about his intentions for the 2010–11 season, stating, [...] "I hope I'll be <b>back</b> <b>next</b> <b>year,</b> but right now, it's really hard to say because it will again be a tough decision." [...] Howson did not comment on Filatov's stance, except to say that he expects Filatov to be at the team's training camp prior to the 2010–11 season. Subsequently, Filatov stated after the 2009–10 season that he intended to return to Columbus for training camp.|$|E

In July 1937 Normandie regained the Blue Riband, but the Queen Mary took it <b>back</b> <b>next</b> <b>year.</b> After this the captain of Normandie sent a message saying [...] "Bravo to the Queen Mary until next time!" [...] This rivalry could have gone on into the 1940s, but was ended by World War II.|$|E

60|$|My dearest Miss Mitford,--I {{am quite}} in pain {{to have to}} write a {{farewell}} to you after all. As soon as Wilson had returned--and she stayed away much longer than last year--we found ourselves pushed {{to the edge of}} our time for remaining in England, and the accumulation of business to be done before we could go pressed on us. I am almost mad with the amount of things to be done, as it is; but I should have put the visit to you at the head of them, and swept all the rest on one side for a day, if it hadn't been for the detestable weather, and my horrible cough which combines with it. When Wilson came back she found me coughing in my old way, and it has been without intermission up to now, or rather waxing worse and worse. To have gone down to you and inflicted the noise of it on you would have simply made you nervous, while the risk to myself would have been very great indeed. Still, I have waited and waited, feeling it scarcely possible to write to you to say, 'I am not coming this year.' Ah, I am so very sorry and disappointed! I hoped against hope for a break in the weather, and an improvement in myself; now we must go, and there is no hope. For about a fortnight I have been a prisoner in the house. This climate won't let me live, there's the truth. So we are going on Monday. We go to Paris for a week or two, and then to Florence, and then to Rome, and then to Naples; but we shall be <b>back</b> <b>next</b> <b>year,</b> if God pleases, and then I shall seize an early summer day to run down straight to you and find you stronger, if God blesses me so far. Think of me and love me a little meanwhile. I shall do it by you. And do, do--since there is no time to hear from you in London--send a fragment of a note to Arabel for me, that I may have it in Paris before we set out on our long Italian journey. Let me have the comfort of knowing exactly how you are before we set out. As for me, I expect to be better on crossing the Channel. How people manage to live and enjoy life in this fog and cold is inexplicable to me. I understand the system of the American rapping spirits considerably better....|$|E
