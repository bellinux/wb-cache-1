5|$|Przemysł II didn't {{participate}} in this expedition (at least directly, according to Jan Długosz), <b>because</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> moment he was in Ląd, according to a document dated 24 August 1278. Certainly by the command of his uncle, Przemysł II acted as mediator in the dispute between Dukes Leszek II the Black and Ziemomysł of Inowrocław and his subjects.|$|E
5|$|Æthelric was consecrated {{bishop in}} 1058 by Stigand, the Archbishop of Canterbury. Æthelric was consecrated by Stigand, {{unlike most of}} the English bishops of the time period, <b>because</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> point, Stigand held a valid pallium, or symbol of an archbishop's {{authority}} and ability to consecrate bishops.|$|E
5|$|Donayre's {{tenure as}} Commanding General {{of the army}} was {{controversial}} from the start due to corruption allegations and an international incident with Chile. Opposition leader Ollanta Humala criticized Donayre's designation as irregular <b>because</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> time he was not serving as general {{of any of the}} three major army divisions as stipulated by Peruvian law. As commander of the Army, Donayre was also accused of acquiring 50,000 American-made MREs— military rations— to supply troops deployed against Shining Path guerrillas in the Apurímac and Ene river valleys, instead of acquiring cheaper, locally-made alternatives. An attempt to buy 50,000 more rations led to an inquiry by the Ministry of Defense.|$|E
50|$|In 1943 Sylmar volunteers, with {{cooperation}} from the city fire department, established their own branch station at 15097 Roxford Street, principally <b>because</b> Sylmar <b>at</b> <b>that</b> time was separated from other stations by railroad tracks.|$|R
50|$|The term Canadian Cross {{came about}} <b>because</b> <b>at</b> the time <b>that</b> these issues were under discussion, Canada had three {{national}} political parties.|$|R
2500|$|Berthelot's {{empirical}} formula for acetylene (C4H2), {{as well as}} the alternative name [...] "quadricarbure d'hydrogène" [...] (hydrogen quadricarbide) were incorrect <b>because</b> chemists <b>at</b> <b>that</b> time used the wrong atomic mass for carbon (6 instead of 12).|$|R
5|$|Earp's {{anger at}} Holliday's ethnic slur may {{indicate}} that his feelings for Josephine were more serious at the time than is commonly known. The information in the letter is compelling <b>because</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> time in the 1940s, the relationship between Wyatt Earp and Josephine Marcus in Tombstone was not public knowledge. Otero could know these things only {{if he had a}} relationship with someone who had personal knowledge of the individuals involved.|$|E
5|$|In adults, {{blood lead}} levels {{steadily}} increase with increasing age. In adults of all ages, men have higher blood lead levels than women do. Children {{are more sensitive}} to elevated blood lead levels than adults are. Children may also have a higher intake of lead than adults; they breathe faster and {{may be more likely}} to have contact with and ingest soil. Children of ages one to three tend to have the highest blood lead levels, possibly <b>because</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> age they begin to walk and explore their environment, and they use their mouths in their exploration. Blood levels usually peak at about 18–24months old. In many countries including the US, household paint and dust are the major route of exposure in children.|$|E
5|$|For Pokiri, Mahesh {{sported a}} longer hair style {{than in his}} {{previous}} films and shed five kilograms of weight. He used a new wardrobe and the same pair of shoes throughout the film. Jagannadh wanted to cast Ayesha Takia as the female lead. Due to a last minute change, the makers opted to replace Takia and considered several actresses including Deepika Padukone. Jagannadh approached Parvati Melton to play the female lead. She declined the offer <b>because,</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> time, her parents were against her decision to become an actress. He also approached Kangana Ranaut who could not accept the role because of scheduling conflicts with the filming of her scenes in Gangster (2006). After seeing stills of Ileana D'Cruz in her Telugu debut Devadasu (2006), Jagannadh signed her as the female lead since he needed a girl who looked like a teenager {{to play the role}} of the aerobics teacher.|$|E
6000|$|... "Said {{something}} to her! Why, ma'am, {{he came out}} here and asked my permission to pay his addresses to her, which I didn't answer <b>because</b> just <b>at</b> <b>that</b> moment Rachel came in from Farmer Sturt's opposite--" ...|$|R
60|$|The gunners {{were sent}} to their stations, the {{remainder}} of the force disposed here or there as they might be the most useful, we Minute Boys being stationed near the sally-port, which, as Sergeant Corney said, was a great compliment, <b>because</b> <b>at</b> about <b>that</b> place might the hottest work be expected.|$|R
50|$|The Baltic Pride parade rotates {{through the}} Baltic states on a yearly basis and in 2013 {{it was again}} Lithuania's turn to host the event. This time the parade {{attracted}} much more attention <b>because</b> Lithuania <b>at</b> <b>that</b> time {{was in charge of}} the presidency of the Council of the European Union.|$|R
25|$|In 1015, bishop Werner von Habsburg {{laid the}} first stone {{of a new}} cathedral on {{the ruins of the}} Carolingian basilica. He then {{constructed}} a cathedral in the Romanesque style of architecture. That cathedral burned to the ground in 1176 <b>because</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> time the naves were covered with a wooden framework.|$|E
25|$|In {{subsequent}} issues OZ {{made several}} {{investigations into the}} murky realms of Sydney's underworld. One celebrated feature delved into the illegal abortion rackets which were then flourishing in Sydney (and around Australia), <b>because</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> time abortion was still illegal {{for all but the}} most exceptional cases, and corrupt police were widely believed to be running lucrative protection rackets that netted them substantial sums.|$|E
25|$|Launched in July 1979, the 147 was {{the first}} mass-produced car that ran on ethanol as fuel instead of petrol. The {{performance}} slightly increased and fuel consumption was 30% higher {{but the cost of}} the alcohol was a quarter of the gasoline <b>because,</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> time, petrol had become expensive {{as a consequence of the}} 1979 oil crisis. This version was nicknamed cachacinha (little cachaça) because it had the scent of that Brazilian drink.|$|E
50|$|Oddly, the locomotive's {{controls}} {{were laid out}} as in a steam locomotive, <b>because</b> there were <b>at</b> <b>that</b> time no drivers with experience of driving diesel engines.|$|R
5000|$|The {{roots of}} the oriental {{collection}} in Dresden {{can be traced back}} as far as 1591. <b>At</b> <b>that</b> time, the Turkish Chamber was still called [...] "Ungerische Cammer" [...] (Hungarian Chamber), probably <b>because</b> Saxony <b>at</b> <b>that</b> time had primarily come into contact with the Ottoman Empire in Hungary. The first recorded use of the name Turkish Chamber dates from 1614.|$|R
50|$|The {{case was}} {{initially}} titled as Baird v. Quinn (Baird et al. v. Quinn et al.), <b>because</b> <b>at</b> the time <b>that</b> proceedings commenced, Robert H. Quinn was {{attorney general of}} Massachusetts, replaced in 1975 by Francis X. Bellotti.|$|R
25|$|Rodriguez-Trias's {{mother was}} a school teacher in Puerto Rico. However, in New York, she {{was not able to}} get a teacher's license <b>because,</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> time, {{bilingualism}} was considered a handicap. Therefore, her mother had to take in boarders in order to meet her financial needs and to pay the rent. After Rodriguez-Trias graduated from high school, she decided that she would like to study medicine and that her chances would be much better in Puerto Rico, because the island had a good scholarship system.|$|E
25|$|Pierre-Paul Riquet had no {{technical}} training and learnt on the job. He regularly practised experiments and field observations. His technique remained highly empirical <b>because</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> time applied science and hydraulic techniques through laws or concepts {{had not been}} mastered. Even so, Riquet had a scientific approach as he systematically took measurements of flow and made calculations of volumes. In addition, to overcome his technical shortcomings, {{he was surrounded by}} many technicians such as Hector Boutheroüe, François Andreossy surveyor and cartographer, and Pierre Campmas an expert in water flows.|$|E
25|$|Side-to-side {{movement}} of the stick controlled the large rudder. This produced a rolling motion because the wings both had substantial dihedral, through yaw-roll coupling. The rudder had to be quite large not only to produce adequate roll {{but also because the}} fuselage was very short, reducing the leverage of the rudder. The Flying Flea, being a two axis aircraft, could not be landed or taken off in substantial crosswinds. This was not a big issue when the aircraft was designed <b>because</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> time aircraft were usually flown from large open fields allowing all take-offs and landings into wind.|$|E
50|$|Hugues Charles Robert Méray (12 November 1835, Chalon-sur-Saône, Saône-et-Loire - 2 February 1911, Dijon) was a French mathematician. He {{is noted}} {{as the first}} to publish an arithmetical theory of irrational numbers. His work {{did not have much}} of a role in the history of {{mathematics}} <b>because</b> France, <b>at</b> <b>that</b> time, was less interested in such matters than Germany.|$|R

50|$|In 1834 {{he killed}} another Belgian captain in a duel on the {{battlefield}} of Waterloo. He was acquitted by the court martial <b>because</b> Belgium <b>at</b> <b>that</b> time {{did not have a}} law against duelling. That same year he tried to resign his commission but was not allowed to, because he had promised to serve ten years after his admission to the Royal military academy.|$|R
25|$|In 1962, Great Canadian Oil Sands Limited (GCOS) {{received}} {{approval from}} the Alberta government to build and operate a 10,000 cubic metre per day plant near Fort McMurray. The plant was to produce 240 tonnes of sulfur and 900 tonnes of coke per day as by-products. <b>Because</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> time the industry was having difficulties marketing its oil, the provincial government established a policy that would limit oil sands production. According to this policy, synthetic oil from the oil sands could supplement conventional oil sales, but could not displace it. Oil from the plant could not exceed 5 per cent of total volumes in markets already supplied by conventional Alberta oil.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, General Dragomir Milošević, former {{commander}} of the Sarajevo-Romanija Corps, {{was found guilty of}} the shelling and sniper terror campaign against Sarajevo and its citizens from August 1994 to late 1995. He was sentenced to 33 years in prison. The Trial Chamber concluded the Markale town market had been hit on 28 August 1995 by a 120mm mortar shell fired from the Sarajevo-Romanija Corps positions. In 2009, however, the ICTY Appeals Chamber overturned Milošević's conviction for the 28 August 1995 shelling of the Markale Market <b>because</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> time Milošević was in hospital in Belgrade, so that his deputy commander Čedomir Sladoje should in fact be considered responsible for the shelling. Momčilo Perišić was acquitted by the ICTY Appeals Chamber in 2013.|$|E
25|$|At that time, NA {{was not yet}} {{recognized}} by society at large as a positive force. The initial group had difficulty finding places {{that would allow them}} to meet, and often had to meet in people's homes. The first meetings of Narcotics Anonymous were held in the basements of churches for the members protection <b>because</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> time an old law prohibiting convicted felons from congregating was still being upheld and churches offered their basements as a sanctuary. Addicts would have to cruise around meeting places and check for surveillance, to make sure meetings would not be busted by police. It was many years before NA became recognized as a beneficial organization, although some early press accounts were very positive.|$|E
60|$|The cowboy had {{a better}} {{appetite}} that morning, which fact mitigated somewhat the burden of Wade's worry. There was burden enough, however, and Wade had set this day to make important decisions about Moore's injured foot. He had dreaded to remove the last dressing <b>because</b> conditions <b>at</b> <b>that</b> time had been unimproved. He had done all he could {{to ward off the}} threatened gangrene.|$|R
50|$|Despite of Heiler's liberalism, {{his high}} church {{theology}} was also widely known among other, usually very conservative Lutheran high church theologians outside of Germany, <b>because</b> of <b>at</b> <b>that</b> time generally a rare ecumenical attempt, Heiler's Roman Catholic background {{and because of}} his interest on Liturgical Movement. After the ecumenical approach of Second Vatican Council of Roman Catholic Church, Heiler as an ecumenical theologian has been of less interest in academical theology.|$|R

He built 100 Houses near Sanghar for his Family and his best fighters. <b>Because</b> house <b>at</b> <b>that</b> time in balochi was called as 'Kar' so he named that place SowKar or Sokar (Balochi: سوکڑ). This place is still located near Sanghar desert District Dera Ghazi Khan. Now this is the hometown of Malghani Baloch tribe.|$|R
25|$|The {{international}} end of {{the company}} also invested in the arms deal by buying shares of African Defence Systems, a bidder {{for one of the}} lucrative contracts in the arms deal. This bid excluded Nkobi Holdings, which was a shareholder of Thomson-CSF in South Africa—to Shaik's great consternation. In June 1996, Shaik held a meeting to tell his directors that they must gear up to bid for the electronic defence system needed to guide and protect South Africa's newly acquired corvettes. Shaik said that he would use his political connections in order to facilitate the contracts and tenders, <b>because</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> point both Shaik and Zuma were confident that Zuma would be made Deputy President in the post-Mandela government. Zuma was given more loans to facilitate the deal for Shaik and to help Nkobi receive more government contracts.|$|E
25|$|Slytherin's {{background}} is first discussed by Professor Binns in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (and by Professor McGonagall {{in the film}} version and Professor Flitwick in the computer game). He describes {{the founding of the}} school and the schism which developed between Slytherin and the other founders, and he mentions that the castle was founded far from Muggles <b>because,</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> time, common people feared magic and persecuted suspected wizards and witches. Slytherin wanted magical learning restricted to all-magical families, as he believed Muggle-born students to be untrustworthy and he disliked teaching such students. According to ancient legend, Slytherin was responsible for the construction of the Chamber of Secrets. This chamber contained a magical creature, the Basilisk, susceptible to control by his Parselmouth descendants and left there to purge the school of all Muggle-borns. This occurred shortly before infighting among the four founders broke out and resulted in Slytherin's departure.|$|E
25|$|By {{the date}} of the second marquee-auction of 126 more plots, the Land Company had built roads and was {{repairing}} the pier. Plots were advertised more energetically than before and promoted on the basis of Herne Bay's smallness, cheapness, ripeness for speculation and its proximity to the railway line. Sales were aimed at landlords wanting to buy cheaply and rent at profit, <b>because</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> time house-ownership was uncommon and tenancy was the norm. Prospective purchasers were promised trams and buses to take tenants to the railway station, or even an extra railway station close to the estate. The empty and rural nature of this spot was translated into promises of botanising, shooting, bathing, sailing and angling. Although no cheap train was provided on this occasion, plots sold at £8 to £32, making the Land Company £1,370. During 1889 sales were promoted by newspaper advertisements rather than auctions, and the pier's repairs were said to be ongoing. According to these advertisements there were croquet lawns and tennis courts plus a spring.|$|E

The [...] "Plan" [...] led to the later establishment of Radcliffe College. <b>Because</b> Harvard <b>at</b> <b>that</b> time did not grant degrees to women, Vassar College granted her bachelor's and master's degrees after they appointed her to the Vassar faculty.|$|R
50|$|In early 1900s, many {{industries}} {{settled in}} Mooca's quiet plains, an isolated area back then. <b>Because</b> labour <b>at</b> <b>that</b> time {{was in high}} demand, many immigrants from Italy, most of them coming {{from the city of}} Naples, fled to São Paulo to take up jobs at local industries. Indeed, much of Mooca's development was an outcome of the strong Italian immigrant influence. In 1910, two out of three inhabitants of Mooca were Italian.|$|R
60|$|Twenty-one {{years before}} we sailed from London, Sir Walter Raleigh sent out a fleet of seven ships, {{carrying}} one hundred and seven persons, to Virginia, and Master Ralph Lane was named as the governor.
