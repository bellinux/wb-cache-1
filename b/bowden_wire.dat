The base of the design solution is selection optimal conception of suspension which influence external design of the frame. General benefit of this concept is utilizing specific properties of carbon composite for design of funkcional frame parts and their technical and visual integration. Important part of this work is design of frame details: rear ends, rear shox's link and duct of the <b>bowdens,</b> <b>wires</b> and brake hydraulic housing...|$|R

The use of Bowden cable is shown to be feasible for this purpose, even with the changing frictional forces associated with it's use. This method greatly simplifies the control of the hand by removing the coupling between joints, and allows for direct and accurate translation between the joints and the motors driving the <b>Bowden</b> <b>wires.</b> The design also allows for two degrees of freedom (with the same centre of rotation) to be realised in the largest knuckle of each finger, meaning biological finger kinematics are more accurately emulated...|$|R

As a new approach, this platform enables {{the introduction of}} flexible endoscopic instruments through the designed hollow manipulators with ∅ 12 mm and 6 DOFs. Two such highly versatile manipulators and a 5 DOF telescope are combined in a unit that can be inserted through a 30 mm incision into the abdominal cavity. The entire platform is actuated by <b>bowden</b> <b>wires</b> in 2 m distance at the periphery. This design overcomes the problem of having a bulky and heavy platform near the patient. The design of the platform and the individual components are presented in this paper. The implemented control and simulation environment are also illustrated. The working range of one manipulator and the applicable forces were measured. Furthermore, {{the results of the}} accomplished in-vivo studies are presented. I...|$|R
60|$|The {{incidents}} of our flight in Lord Roberts B do not arrange themselves in any consecutive order. To {{think of that}} adventure is like dipping haphazard into an album of views. One is reminded first of this and then of that. We were both lying down on a horizontal plate of basketwork; for Lord Roberts B had none of the elegant accommodation of a balloon. I lay forward, and my uncle behind me in such a position {{that he could see}} hardly anything of our flight. We were protected from rolling over simply by netting between the steel stays. It was impossible for us to stand up at all; we had either to lie or crawl on all fours over the basket work. Amidships were lockers made of Watson's Aulite material,--and between these it was that I had put my uncle, wrapped in rugs. I wore sealskin motoring boots and gloves, and a motoring fur coat over my tweeds, and I controlled the engine by <b>Bowden</b> <b>wires</b> and levers forward.|$|R
