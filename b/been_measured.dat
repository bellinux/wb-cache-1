5|$|Gravitational {{redshift}} has <b>been</b> <b>measured</b> in {{the laboratory}} and using astronomical observations. Gravitational time dilation in the Earth's gravitational field has <b>been</b> <b>measured</b> numerous times using atomic clocks, while ongoing validation is provided as {{a side effect of}} the operation of the Global Positioning System (GPS). Tests in stronger gravitational fields are provided by the observation of binary pulsars. All results are in agreement with general relativity. However, at the current level of accuracy, these observations cannot distinguish between general relativity and other theories in which the equivalence principle is valid.|$|E
5|$|Hilsenhoff Biotic Index {{values for}} Kettle Creek have <b>been</b> <b>measured.</b> The Hilsenhoff Biotic Index {{is a method}} of {{determining}} water quality based {{on the presence of}} macroinvertebrate families and their tolerance to pollution. It ranges from 0 to 10, with 0 being the least polluted. Kettle Creek ranges from 4.61 to 2.54 with an average of 3.32. The EPT Index (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera Index) has also <b>been</b> <b>measured</b> for the creek. It ranges from 10 to 25 with an average of 17. There are 285 vertebrate species that have the potential to inhabit the Kettle Creek watershed.|$|E
5|$|Many of the wettest {{tropical}} cyclones in the United States {{have moved}} into the contiguous United States from the Atlantic Ocean, the Gulf of Mexico, and the eastern Pacific Ocean. The highest rainfall totals in the country have <b>been</b> <b>measured</b> across the Gulf Coast and lower portions of the Eastern Seaboard. Intermediate amounts have <b>been</b> <b>measured</b> across the Southwest, New England, and the Midwest. The northern Great Plains and Pacific Northwest have received the lowest amounts, as those regions lie exceptionally far from the breeding grounds of Atlantic and Eastern Pacific tropical cyclones.|$|E

5|$|Several {{relativistic}} {{effects are}} directly related to the relativity of direction. One is geodetic precession: the axis direction of a gyroscope in free fall in curved spacetime will change when compared, for instance, with the direction of light received from distant stars—even though such a gyroscope represents the way of keeping a direction as stable as possible ("parallel transport"). For the Moon–Earth system, this effect has <b>been</b> <b>measured</b> with the help of lunar laser ranging. More recently, it has <b>been</b> <b>measured</b> for test masses aboard the satellite Gravity Probe B to a precision of better than 0.3%.|$|E
5|$|The {{familiar}} Pauling electronegativity scale relies upon {{chemical bond}} energies, but such values have obviously not <b>been</b> <b>measured</b> for inert helium and neon. The Allen electronegativity scale, which relies only upon (measurable) atomic energies, identifies neon {{as the most}} electronegative element, closely followed by fluorine and helium.|$|E
5|$|Gravitational {{redshift}} {{was first}} measured {{in a laboratory}} setting in 1959 by Pound and Rebka. It is also seen in astrophysical measurements, notably for light escaping the white dwarf Sirius B. The related gravitational time dilation effect has <b>been</b> <b>measured</b> by transporting atomic clocks to altitudes of between tens {{and tens of thousands}} of kilometers (first by Hafele and Keating in 1971; most accurately to date by Gravity Probe A launched in 1976).|$|E

5|$|If the {{large-scale}} universe appears isotropic as viewed from Earth, the cosmological principle {{can be derived}} from the simpler Copernican principle, which states that there is no preferred (or special) observer or vantage point. To this end, the cosmological principle has been confirmed to a level of 10−5 via observations of the CMB. The universe has <b>been</b> <b>measured</b> to be homogeneous on the largest scales at the 10% level.|$|E
5|$|In psychophysiological {{research}} on attachment, {{the two main}} areas studied have been autonomic responses, such as heart rate or respiration, and {{the activity of the}} hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis. Infants' physiological responses have <b>been</b> <b>measured</b> during the Strange Situation procedure looking at individual differences in infant temperament {{and the extent to which}} attachment acts as a moderator. There is some evidence that the quality of caregiving shapes the development of the neurological systems which regulate stress.|$|E
5|$|On March 22, 2005, NASA {{released}} {{news that}} infrared {{light from the}} planet had <b>been</b> <b>measured</b> by the Spitzer Space Telescope, the first ever direct detection of light from an extrasolar planet. This was done by subtracting the parent star's constant light and noting the difference as the planet transited {{in front of the}} star and was eclipsed behind it, providing a measure of the light from the planet itself. New measurements from this observation determined the planet's temperature as at least 750°C (1300°F). The circular orbit of HD 209458 b was also confirmed.|$|E

5|$|Seamounts are {{exceptionally}} {{important to}} their biome ecologically, but their role in their environment is poorly understood. Because they project out above the surrounding sea floor, they disturb standard water flow, causing eddies and associated hydrological phenomena that ultimately result in water movement in an otherwise still ocean bottom. Currents have <b>been</b> <b>measured</b> at up to 0.9knots, or 48centimeters per second. Because of this upwelling seamounts often carry above-average plankton populations, seamounts are thus centers where the fish that feed on them aggregate, in turn falling prey to further predation, making seamounts important biological hotspots.|$|E
5|$|The average yearly {{survival}} rate of emperor penguins has <b>been</b> <b>measured</b> at 95.1%, {{with an average}} life expectancy of 19.9years. The same researchers estimated that 1% of emperor penguins hatched could feasibly reach an age of 50years. In contrast, only 19% of chicks survive {{their first year of}} life. Therefore, 80% of the emperor penguin population comprises adults five years and older.|$|E
5|$|The {{electron}} affinity of an atom {{is the amount}} of energy released when an electron is added to a neutral atom to form a negative ion. Although {{electron affinity}} varies greatly, some patterns emerge. Generally, nonmetals have more positive electron affinity values than metals. Chlorine most strongly attracts an extra electron. The electron affinities of the noble gases have not <b>been</b> <b>measured</b> conclusively, so {{they may or may not}} have slightly negative values.|$|E

5|$|The {{gravitational}} {{field of the}} Moon has <b>been</b> <b>measured</b> through tracking the Doppler shift of radio signals emitted by orbiting spacecraft. The main lunar gravity features are mascons, large positive gravitational anomalies associated {{with some of the}} giant impact basins, partly caused by the dense mare basaltic lava flows that fill those basins. The anomalies greatly influence the orbit of spacecraft about the Moon. There are some puzzles: lava flows by themselves cannot explain all of the gravitational signature, and some mascons exist that are not linked to mare volcanism.|$|E
5|$|The {{individual}} apparent magnitudes {{of the two}} component stars {{cannot be}} directly measured, but their relative brightness has <b>been</b> <b>measured</b> at various wavelengths. They have very nearly equal brightness in the visible light spectrum, with the hotter secondary component generally being {{found to be a}} few tenths of a magnitude brighter. A 2016 measurement gives the magnitude difference between the two stars at a wavelength of 700 nm as 0.00 ± 0.1.|$|E

The more severe toxic effects include psychosis or adverse psychiatric events, renal toxicity, respiratory failure, hyperthermia, serotonin syndrome, rhabdomyolysis and seizure.

5|$|The mass of Beta Pictoris {{has been}} {{determined}} by using models of stellar evolution and fitting them to the star's observed properties.

The star's angular diameter has <b>been</b> <b>measured</b> using interferometry with the Very Large Telescope and {{was found to be}} 0.84 milliarcseconds.
