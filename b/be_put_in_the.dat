When Scully and Doggett confront Pugovel about it, he admits it was Dr. Clifton, a doctor who mysteriously disappeared. He had {{requested}} that he <b>be</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> barrel in order to not ruin the company or slow the research. Doggett and Scully realize that Ray was exposed to the barrel, and thus was transformed into a metal human. At the same time, Doggett notices Nora Pearce at the lab, looking through files for the person responsible. Later, the halfway house is raided by the FBI to find Pearce. Larina finds Ray and he puts one hand over her mouth to muffle, but he kills her by accident.|$|E
5|$|The Russians did {{not believe}} that super firing turrets offered any {{advantage}} as they discounted the value of axial fire, believed that broadside fire was much more important and also believed that super firing turrets could not fire while over the lower turret because of muzzle blast interfering with the open sighting hoods in the lower turret's roof. They therefore designed the ships with a 'linear' arrangement (lineinoe raspolozhenie) of turrets distributed over the length of the ship. This arrangement had several advantages because it reduced the stress on the ends of the ship since the turrets were not concentrated {{at the end of the}} ship, increased stability because the lack of elevated turrets and their barbettes, improved the survivability of the ship because the magazines were separated from each other and gave a lower silhouette. Disadvantages were that the magazines had to <b>be</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle of all the machinery, which required steam pipes to be run through or around them and the lack of deck space free from blast. This greatly complicated the placement of the anti-torpedo boat guns which ultimately had to be mounted in the hull, closer to the water than was desirable.|$|E

25|$|The {{fraction}} {{of water that}} an ethanol-gasoline fuel can contain without phase separation increases with the percentage of ethanol. For example, E30 can have up to about 2% water. If {{there is more than}} about 71% ethanol, the remainder can be any proportion of water or gasoline and phase separation does not occur. The fuel mileage declines with increased water content. The increased solubility of water with higher ethanol content permits E30 and hydrated ethanol to <b>be</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same tank since any combination of them always results in a single phase. Somewhat less water is tolerated at lower temperatures. For E10 it is about 0.5% v/v at 70 F and decreases to about 0.23% v/v at −30 F.|$|E

25|$|Ruth becomes {{convinced}} Elena {{wants the}} plane to be shot down, since it is a Russian airline flight full of civilians, and a British air strike upon it would infuriate the Russian government, ending the partnership negotiations. As Towers meets with the Cabinet Office Briefing Room (COBRA) and sends Eurofighters to intercept the plane, Ruth persuades Harry to make Elena tell him the truth. Harry resorts to threatening to kill Sasha in order to gauge her reaction. It becomes clear that Elena is willing to sacrifice her son to complete her mission. Convinced it was her plan to force the shooting down of the passenger plane, Henry instructs Towers to abort the mission, however Towers is not convinced. Harry solicits the help of Gavrik, who agrees but only {{on the condition that}} he <b>be</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same room as Elena. When this is granted, Gavrik threatens Towers with military action against the UK unless the attack is aborted. With seconds to spare, Towers complies, averting disaster. The plane goes on to land safely at Heathrow Airport with Zykov arrested.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, as two new {{teams were}} added to the IPL, the IPL Governing Council {{declared}} that each franchise could retain a maximum of four players of their squad, only three of whom can be Indian players, {{and the rest of the}} international players would <b>be</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mega-auction. The Chennai franchise, keen to have the same set of core players, retained captain MS Dhoni, vice-captain Suresh Raina, Murali Vijay and all-rounder Albie Morkel for a total of $4.5 million. The retention left them with the power of spending only $4.5 million at the mega-auction. At the auction, they bought back some of their star players of previous seasons such as Hussey, Ashwin, Bollinger and Subramaniam Badrinath. In the 2011 IPL, they lost three of their first five games which placed them at the bottom of the ten-team points table. But then, they went on to win seven of their next eight games to finish second and register a spot in the knockout stages. They faced the top-ranked team Royal Challengers Bangalore in the Qualifying final which they won by 6 wickets thanks to an unbeaten 73 from Suresh Raina. In the final, they faced the same opponents again, which was held at their home ground Chepauk. Vijay and Hussey put on a 133-run first-wicket partnership that helped the Super Kings to post a total of 205/5. Their bowlers, then, restricted Bangalore to only 147 to take the Super Kings to second consecutive title in the IPL. Vijay was awarded Man of the Match for his match-winning innings of 95. CSK also won all their home games that season becoming the first team in IPL to achieve the feat. However at the Champions League later that year, they won only one out of their four group matches and finished at the bottom.|$|E

500|$|In the Middle Ages Scotland {{had much}} more limited {{organisation}} for poor relief than England, lacking the religious confraternities of the major English cities. It possessed a few hospitals, bede houses and leper houses, which offered confinement rather than treatment. Because so many Scottish parishes had been impropriated for some religious foundation, {{perhaps as many as}} 87 per cent, funds were not available for local causes such as poor relief. Protestant reformers in the Book of Discipline (1560) proposed that part of the patrimony of the Catholic Church be used to support the poor, but this aim was never realised. Population growth and economic dislocation from {{the second half of the}} sixteenth century led to a growing problem of vagrancy. The government reacted with three major pieces of legislation on poverty and vagrancy in 1574, 1579 and 1592. The kirk became a major element of the system of poor relief, and justices of the peace were given responsibility for dealing with the issue. The 1574 poor law act was modelled on the English act passed two years earlier; it limited relief to the deserving poor of the old, sick and infirm, imposing draconian punishments on a long list of [...] "masterful beggars", including jugglers, palmisters and unlicensed tutors.

Unlike the English act, there was no attempt to provide work for the able-bodied poor. In practice, the strictures on begging were often disregarded in times of extreme hardship. Poor rates were very slow to be set up in the burghs, with Edinburgh the first as a result of the outbreak of plague in 1584. It was then gradually introduced in other cities, such as St Andrews in 1597, Perth in 1599, Aberdeen in 1619, and Glasgow and Dundee in 1636.|$|E
