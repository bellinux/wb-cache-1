50|$|For drilled bar-stock thermowells, {{the most}} common form of failure is <b>bending</b> <b>fatigue</b> at its base where the bending {{stresses}} are greatest. In extreme flow conditions (high-velocity liquids or high-velocity, high-pressure gases and vapors) catastrophic failure may occur with bending stresses exceeding the ultimate strength of the material. For extremely long thermowells, the static component of the bending stresses may govern design. In less demanding services, fatigue failure is more gradual and often preceded by a series sensor failures. The latter are due to the acceleration of the thermowell tip as it vibrates, this motion causes the element to lift off the bottom of the thermowell and batter itself to pieces. In cases where the acceleration stresses have been measured, sensor accelerations at resonant conditions often exceed 250 Gs and have destroyed the accelerometer.|$|E
5000|$|In 1967 Hydranautics, now Bardex Corporation, designed, patented, {{manufactured}} {{and delivered}} the first shiplift using chain instead of wire rope. These Shiplifts differ distinctly {{in the use}} of hydraulic Chain Jacks and Stud Link Anchor Chain to lift commercial ships, naval vessels and submarines. [...] The five distinct advantages to the Bardex Chain Jack Shiplift are: 1) Chain is inherently less susceptible to corrosion and <b>bending</b> <b>fatigue</b> as any chain corrosion is visible on the outside surfaces as opposed to wire rope. For this reason, Lloyd’s shipping register requires 20% of wire ropes to be removed and destructively tested each year with all wire ropes to be replaced every 5-10 years. Lloyd’s does not stipulate any specific duty life limitations for chains which have been known to last for over 20 years in operation.2) Traditional wire rope shiplift systems rely on synchronous motors powering the winches. These motors cause a large power demand on the system when started. Hydraulic systems start at no load so there is no excessive inrush current demand.3) The use of dual chains for redundancy in lieu of a single wire rope at each hoist provides extra safety and reliability.4) Use of chain allows incremental mechanical synchronization of the entire lift operation. The chain links are made to very tight fabrication tolerances so that after each jacking stroke, the platform is set down on the next set of chain links and the level has been “reset”. Wire rope hoist by comparison can become cumulatively unsynchronized over the duration of a lift requiring the operation to stop and be adjusted.4) At all times the shiplift and the vessel are mechanically held by chain resting on support pins not relying on a braking system. 5) Holding the rigid shiplift platform at the correct elevation for Transfer Operations is a locked mechanical function as the chain is pinned in position without the deflection inherent in wire rope systems. A Bardex Shiplift has never dropped a vessel.|$|E

40|$|An {{investigation}} into the effect of contact geometry on the rotary <b>bending</b> fretting <b>fatigue</b> life of Al 7075 -T 6 GH Majzoobi and K Minaii The effect of contact geometry on the rotary <b>bending</b> fretting <b>fatigue</b> of Al 7075 -T 6 has been investigated. Two types of contact geometries, conforming and non-conforming, have been considered in the investigation. Three different char-acteristic lengths {{have been used for}} each type of contact. In the conforming type, three different contact areas and in the non-conforming type three different fillet radii has been considered in this work. The results show that <b>bending</b> fretting <b>fatigue</b> reduces the life of the material by about 90 % in some cases. The reduction varies with the contact type and characteristic length. In the conforming type of contact, fretting fatigue life increases with the increase of characteristic length for low bending stresses but at higher <b>bending</b> stresses the <b>fatigue</b> life converges to the same cycles, regardless of the characteristic length. In the non-conforming type, fretting fatigue life reaches a minimum at the fillet radius of 1. 5 mm. Since, contact pressure, shear stress, and slip amplitude have great effects on fretting fatigue life, the distribution of these parameters have been determined using Abaqus software for each contact type. The numerical simulations are quite consistent with the experimental results. The numerical results could reasonably explain the manner of variations observed in S–N curves for different contact geometries considered in this work...|$|R

The characterization of the products was completed through a combination of non-contact surface profiling, hardness measurements, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), tensile, and three-point <b>bend</b> <b>fatigue</b> testing.

Recent reexaminations of classical theory have revealed a significant effect of hydrostatic stress on the yield behavior of various geometries. Fatigue tests and nonlinear finite element analyses (FEA) of Inconel 100 (IN 100) equal-arm bend specimens and new monotonic tests and nonlinear finite element analyses of IN 100 smooth tension, smooth compression, and double-edge notch tension (DENT) test specimens have revealed the effect of internal hydrostatic tensile stresses on yielding.

In all monotonic tensile test cases, the von Mises constitutive model, overestimated the load for a given displacement or strain. Considering the failure displacements or strains for the DENT specimen, the Drucker-Prager FEM s predicted loads that were approximately 3 % lower than the von Mises values.
