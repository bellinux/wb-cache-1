5|$|I can quite {{understand}} the Prince of Wales being much annoyed at his son's name being {{coupled with the}} thing {{but that was the}} case <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>left</b> it... we were both accused of going to this place but not together... they will end by having out in open court exactly what they are all trying to keep quiet. I wonder if it is really a fact or only an invention of that arch ruffian H.|$|E
25|$|A {{man came}} in <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>left,</b> who I {{found out later}} was Baby Face Nelson. He {{came in with a}} drum of machine gun bullets under his arm, threw them on the bed or the couch in the bedroom, and started to talk to Van Meter. The two then motioned for Dillinger to come over and the three went back into the kitchen.|$|E
500|$|According to the {{biography}} Michael Jackson: The Magic and the Madness, written by journalist J. Randy Taraborrelli, the pop singer had shown an early {{attachment to the}} story of E.T. After a publicity photo shoot for the soundtrack album in which an animatronic robot of the extraterrestrial character hugged Jackson, the singer stated with wonderment, [...] "He was so real that I was talking to him. I kissed him <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>left.</b> The next day, I missed him." [...] Jackson later revealed in the December 1982 issue of Ebony magazine—in which both he and E.T. appear on the cover—that he felt he actually was the creature during the album recording and shared his thoughts on why he had such a strong connection to the character: ...|$|E

60|$|Day <b>before</b> yesterday, <b>I</b> <b>left</b> {{here with}} about 3000 men in five steamers, convoyed by two gun boats, and {{proceeded}} {{down the river}} to within twelve miles of Columbus. The next morning the boats were dropped down just {{out of range of}} the enemy's batteries and the troops debarked.|$|R
500|$|He soon {{uncovered}} {{a number of}} important buildings including the Ésagila temple. This was a major shrine to the chief Babylonian god Marduk, although its identity was not fully confirmed until the German archaeologist Robert Koldewey's excavation of 1900. The excavators found a large number of business documents written on clay tablets buried in the temple's foundations where they discovered the Cyrus Cylinder. Rassam gave conflicting accounts of where his discoveries were made. He wrote in his memoirs, Asshur and the land of Nimrod, that the Cylinder had been found in a mound {{at the southern end of}} Babylon near the village of Jumjuma or Jimjima. However, in a letter sent on 20 November 1879 to Samuel Birch, the Keeper of Oriental Antiquities at the British Museum, he wrote, [...] "The Cylinder of Cyrus was found at Omran [...] with about six hundred pieces of inscribed terracottas <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>left</b> Baghdad." [...] He left Baghdad on 2 April, returning to Mosul and departing from there on 2 May for a journey to London which lasted until 19 June.|$|E
2500|$|In 1998, Barlow {{wrote the}} article [...] "Africa Rising: Everything You Know About Africa Is Wrong" [...] for Wired, which {{documented}} {{the start of}} his extensive travels as he worked to expand Internet access across the continent: [...] "I went from Mombasa to Tombouctou, experiencing various parts of Kenya, Ghana, the Ivory Coast, Mali, Uganda, and the Virunga volcano area where Uganda, Rwanda, and the Congo meet. Part of the idea was that I would attempt to email Wired a series of dispatches on my travels. The act of finding a port into cyberspace would be part of the adventure... <b>Before</b> <b>I</b> <b>left,</b> I believed Africans could proceed directly from the agricultural epoch into an information economy without having to submit to the dreary indignities and social pathologies of industrialization." ...|$|E
2500|$|You know – & I believe saw {{once that}} odd-headed girl – who {{introduced}} herself to me shortly <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>left</b> England – {{but you do}} not know – that I found her with Shelley and her sister at Geneva – I never loved her nor pretended to love her – but a man is a man – & if a girl of eighteen comes prancing to you {{at all hours of the}} night – there is but one way – the suite of all this is that she was with child – & returned to England to assist in peopling that desolate island... This comes of [...] "putting it about" [...] (as Jackson calls it) & be dammed to it – and thus people come into the world.|$|E
6000|$|<b>Before</b> <b>I</b> had <b>left</b> {{the country}} of my host, while the first {{rays of the sun}} slanted over the mountains, as I stopped by the wayside to gather some raspberries, a very old man, not far from a hundred, came along with a milking-pail in his hand, and turning aside began to pluck the berries near me:-- ...|$|R

2500|$|After {{graduating from}} Princeton, Ward {{spent a year}} as a teacher in Lawrenceville, New Jersey. [...] He also {{returned}} to Princeton during the fall of 1895 as an assistant coach for the Princeton football team. [...] While at Lawrenceville, he sought [...] "to impart into growing youth the mathematical idea, also the rudiments of foot-ball, and the truth of truths that there is no University in the country like Princeton." [...] He later wrote, [...] "Teaching, somehow, did not satisfy me: in fact, even <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>left</b> college I had an idea that I might be a doctor some day." [...] In another piece, he noted that he [...] "tried for a year to instill Princeton ideas, along with a little knowledge into the heads of the younger generation. [...] The work was pleasant and I was associated with some fine men; but medicine is to be my vocation." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{spoke to}} Alex Ferguson and {{the deal was}} close to being done. I then went on holiday, and my agent at the time, Ambrose Mendy, said it wasn't worth me coming back to do a picture in a United shirt when the deal was completed, so I should do one <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>left,</b> {{and it would be}} {{released}} when the deal was announced. Lawrence Luster of the Daily Star took the picture and put in the library. Soon after, their sister paper, the Daily Express, were looking for a picture of me playing for West Ham, and found the one of me in the United shirt in the pile. They published it and all hell broke loose. [...] "I came back from holiday to discover West Ham fans were going mad. It wasn't really my fault. I was only a kid, I did what my agent told me to do, then took all the crap for it." ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{production}} on Kingdom of the Sun, Andreas Deja was the initial supervising animator of Yzma, and incorporated supermodeling poses published in magazines {{in order to}} capture Yzma's sultry, seductive persona. Nik Ranieri was originally slated as the supervising animator for Yzma's rocky sidekick, Hucua. During the research trip to Peru in 1996, Ranieri acknowledged that [...] "I was researching for a character {{that looked like a}} rock so I was stuck drawing rocks for the whole trip. Then when we got back they piled it into this story about ancient Incas." [...] Mark Pudleiner was to be the supervising animator of Kuzco's proposed maiden, Nina. In early 1997, David Pruiksma came on board to animate the llama, Snowball. According to Pruiksma, Snowball was [...] "a silly, vain and egotistical character, rather the dumb blond of the llama set. I really enjoyed developing the character and doing some early test animation on her as well. <b>Before</b> <b>I</b> <b>left</b> the film (and it was ultimately shelved), I created model sheets for not only Snowball, {{but for the rest of}} the herd of seven other llamas and for Kuzco as a Llama." [...] When the film was placed on production shutdown, Pruiksma transferred to work on [...] being developed concurrently and ultimately the llama characters were dropped from the storyline.|$|E
60|$|Walking {{to and fro}} {{upon the}} platform, I {{continued}} to ponder my situation. In a few hours I would be among my old friends and companions, to measure and be measured. Six years <b>before</b> <b>I</b> had <b>left</b> them to seek my fortune in the eastern world. I had promised little,--fortunately--and I was returning, without the pot of gold and with only a tinge of glory.|$|R

Finkelstein has attributed his interest in color to a childhood visit to France. “I noticed that color was relative. Color was not a fixed thing. I began to see colors in nature I had not seen <b>before.</b> <b>I</b> never <b>left</b> that, really.” ...|$|R

60|$|I {{must go back}} here, after telling openly {{the wicked}} things I did, to mention {{something}} which, however, had the face of doing good. I remembered that when I went from England, which was fifteen years <b>before,</b> <b>I</b> had <b>left</b> five little children, turned out as it were to the wide world, and to the charity of their father's relations; the eldest was not six years old, for we had not been married full seven years when their father went away.|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{shall not}} see her again now <b>before</b> <b>I</b> depart. <b>I</b> <b>left</b> her, as <b>I</b> have said, by Don Jose's bedside. The street was dark, the houses shut up, and I {{walked out of the}} town in the night. Not a single street-lamp had been lit for two days, and the archway of the gate was only a mass of {{darkness}} in the vague form of a tower, in which I heard low, dismal groans, that seemed to answer the murmurs of a man's voice.|$|R

50|$|The title, Nuku, {{has always}} been passed from the oldest brother to the youngest, not from father to son. <b>Before</b> King Tupou <b>I</b> <b>left</b> for war to Fiji, he entrusted, Hon.

Therefore the title was stripped off.|$|R
6000|$|... "I swam ashore <b>before</b> they <b>left.</b> <b>I</b> did {{not know}} they had any idea of landing here; I {{expected}} to be the only one, and {{there would have been no}} need for concealment then. But I am not lucky," [...] he added, with a bitter laugh.|$|R
