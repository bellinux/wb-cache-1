25|$|The 2CV design predates the {{invention}} of disc brake, so 1948–1981 cars have drum brakes on all four wheels. In October 1981, front disc brakes were fitted. Disc brake cars use green LHM fluid – a mineral oil – which is not compatible with standard glycol <b>brake</b> <b>fluid.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{hydraulic}} brake is {{an arrangement of}} braking mechanism which uses <b>brake</b> <b>fluid,</b> typically containing ethylene glycol, to transfer pressure from the controlling unit, which is usually near the operator of the vehicle, to the actual brake mechanism, which is usually {{at or near the}} wheel of the vehicle. In 1918, the {{hydraulic brake}} was invented by Malcolm Loughead, which replaced the mechanical brake which was used previously on automobiles.|$|E

25|$|Mark's {{feud with}} Nick Cotton (John Altman) resurfaces after he discovers that Nick gave his brother, Martin Fowler (James Alexandrou), ecstasy. Mark snaps, spikes Nick's drink, leads {{him up to}} the Walford viaduct, and watches delightedly as the {{intoxicated}} Nick falls. He survives but he is severely crippled, and he vengefully enlists his son Ashley (Frankie Fitzgerald) to take revenge on Mark. Ashley steals Mark's motorbike and attempts to run him over but Nick had drained the <b>brake</b> <b>fluid</b> from the bike the night before. Ashley crashes into the launderette and is killed. Nick leaves the Square shortly afterwards and never sees Mark again.|$|E
25|$|In 1920 the French {{automobile}} and aircraft pioneer Gabriel Voisin experimented with systems that modulated the hydraulic braking pressure on his aircraft brakes {{to reduce the}} risk of tire slippage. These systems use a flywheel and valve attached to a hydraulic line that feeds the brake cylinders. The flywheel is attached to a drum that runs at the same speed as the wheel. In normal braking, the drum and flywheel should spin at the same speed. However, when a wheel slows down, then the drum would do the same, leaving the flywheel spinning at a faster rate. This causes the valve to open, allowing a small amount of <b>brake</b> <b>fluid</b> to bypass the master cylinder into a local reservoir, lowering the pressure on the cylinder and releasing the brakes. The use of the drum and flywheel meant the valve only opened when the wheel was turning. In testing, a 30% improvement in braking performance was noted, because the pilots immediately applied full brakes instead of slowly increasing pressure in order to find the skid point. An additional benefit was the elimination of burned or burst tires.|$|E
25|$|At the restart, Hill and Schumacher again {{held their}} positions, whilst Coulthard led the more circumspect Ferraris through Sainte Dévote, with Alesi jumping ahead of Berger. On this {{occasion}} {{there were no}} major incidents, although Katayama sustained light damage to his car's front wing {{as a result of}} a brush with Morbidelli. As the drivers completed the first lap, Hill led by 0.5seconds from Schumacher, who was followed in turn by Coulthard, Alesi, Berger, Herbert, Häkkinen, Irvine, Brundle, Barrichello, Blundell, Panis, Frentzen, Badoer, Morbidelli, Katayama, Martini, Boullion, Gachot, Moreno, Montermini, Salo, Diniz and Inoue. In the early laps, Hill gradually built a lead of nearly twoseconds over Schumacher by lap10, with the two pulling away in tandem from Coulthard, who was at this point a further eightseconds behind the Benetton. By this stage there had already been two retirements: Häkkinen's Mercedes engine failed due to a fuel pump drive problem on the ninthlap of the race, and Moreno spun at Sainte Dévote when a <b>brake</b> <b>fluid</b> leak caused him to lose control of his Forti a lap later. Morbidelli also made an early unscheduled stop to cure a serious tyre vibration caused by a section of tie-rope from a tyre-warming blanket becoming jammed in one of his rear wheels, the Footwork driver dropping to the tail of the field in the process.|$|E

25|$|When Marge {{escapes from}} the {{courtroom}} {{and goes to the}} library to see who Becky really is, she realizes that she is insane and being unfair to Becky, after finding nothing bad about her and a newspaper tablet of how Marge ruined Becky's marriage. Finally, she returns home, only to find Homer tied up, Lisa's arms and legs stuck to the wall, Maggie stuck in a cage, and Becky holding a knife in her hands. When Becky is about to 'kill' Homer, Marge snatches the knife from her and attempts to strangle her. It turns out that Bart is filming a scene in his movie for the school (now a music video). Homer also reveals that while he was fixing Marge's car, he accidentally drained the <b>brake</b> <b>fluid.</b> Marge apologizes to Becky, but Becky admits she was going to kill Marge and steal her family, but decided not to after she couldn't get a shovel. Suddenly the mental hospital doctors show up and shoot three tranquilizer darts into Marge's neck, which don't take effect. Marge tells them that she has too much to do to take a nap. She instructs Lisa to take Maggie out of the cage and tells Homer that she has some 'S for him' - scrubbing and mopping, since he is dressed for the job anyway. As Marge giggles, Homer fires a dart borrowed from the doctors into her, which sends her straight to sleep.|$|E
500|$|The {{most common}} source of {{ethylene}} glycol is automotive antifreeze or radiator coolant, where concentrations are high.

500|$|The team's most fertile {{period of}} {{technical}} innovation {{came in the}} 1970s and 1980s when Gordon Murray became technical director. During 1976, the team introduced [...] "carbon-carbon brakes" [...] to Formula One, which promised reduced [...] "unsprung weight" [...] and better stopping performance due to carbon's greater coefficient of friction. The initial versions used carbon-carbon composite brake pads and a steel disc faced with carbon [...] "pucks". The technology was not reliable at first; in 1976, Carlos Pace crashed at [...] at the Österreichring circuit after heat build-up in the brakes boiled the <b>brake</b> <b>fluid,</b> leaving him with no way of stopping the car. By 1979, Brabham had developed an effective carbon-carbon braking system, combining structural carbon discs with carbon brake pads. By the late 1980s, carbon brakes were used by all competitors in almost all top level motor sports.|$|E

5000|$|Quality {{standards}} {{refer to}} a <b>brake</b> <b>fluid's</b> [...] "dry" [...] and [...] "wet" [...] boiling points. The wet boiling point, which is usually much lower (although above most normal service temperatures), refers to the fluid's boiling point after absorbing {{a certain amount of}} moisture. This is several (single digit) percent, varying from formulation to formulation. Glycol-ether (DOT 3, 4, and 5.1) <b>brake</b> <b>fluids</b> are hygroscopic (water absorbing), which means they absorb moisture from the atmosphere under normal humidity levels. Non-hygroscopic fluids (e.g. silicone/DOT 5 and mineral oil based formulations), are hydrophobic, and can maintain an acceptable boiling point over the fluid's service life.|$|R
2500|$|... 11th Place Overall (out of 36), {{due to a}} {{brake failure}} after <b>brake</b> <b>fluid</b> that was {{incompatible}} with the seals on the brake system caused the team to lose most of a day for repairs.|$|E
2500|$|Hydraulic {{disc brakes}} {{make use of}} two common forms of fluid. Automotive grade DOT 4 or DOT 5.1 which are {{hygroscopic}} and has a boiling point of 230°C, and mineral oil which is not hygroscopic and has varying boiling points depending on the type. O-rings and seals inside the brake are specifically designed to work with {{one or the other}} fluid. Using the incorrect fluid type will cause the seals to fail resulting in a [...] "squishy" [...] feeling in the lever, and the caliper pistons are unable to retract, so a scraping disc is common. The <b>brake</b> <b>fluid</b> reservoir is usually marked to indicate the type of <b>brake</b> <b>fluid</b> to be used.|$|E
2500|$|Isopropyl {{alcohol is}} a major {{ingredient}} in [...] "gas dryer" [...] fuel additives. In significant quantities water {{is a problem in}} fuel tanks as it separates from the gasoline and can freeze in the supply lines at cold temperatures. Alcohol does not remove water from gasoline; rather, the alcohol solubilizes water in gasoline. Once soluble, water does not pose the same risk as insoluble water, as it will no longer accumulate in the supply lines and freeze, but will be consumed along with the fuel itself. Isopropyl alcohol is often sold in aerosol cans as a windshield or door lock de-icer. Isopropyl alcohol is also used to remove <b>brake</b> <b>fluid</b> traces from hydraulic braking systems, so that the <b>brake</b> <b>fluid</b> (usually DOT 3, DOT 4, or mineral oil) does not contaminate the brake pads, which would result in poor braking.|$|E
50|$|Some {{examples}} {{of types of}} products that after use, can be labeled as used oil are: hydraulic oil, transmission oil, <b>brake</b> <b>fluids,</b> motor oil, crankcase oil, gear box oil, synthetic oil, and grades 1, 2, 3 and 4 fuel oil.|$|R
50|$|<b>Brake</b> <b>fluids</b> must {{maintain}} {{a low level}} of compressibility, even with varying temperatures to accommodate different environmental conditions. This is important to ensure consistent brake pedal feel. As compressibility increases, more brake pedal travel is necessary for the same amount of brake caliper piston force.|$|R
40|$|An {{inertial}} {{energy storage}} device is disclosed which uses flywheel made of flexible material {{such as a}} twisted rope ring. A small number of the strands of the rope ring have a tensile strength that is {{lower than that of}} most of the other strands so that should any of these strands fail, they will begin to whiplash allowing such a failure to be detected and braked before a castastrophic failure occurs. This accomplished by the inclusion of glass tubes located around the periphery of the flywheel. The tubes are in communication with a <b>braking</b> <b>fluid</b> reservoir. The flywheel and glass tubes are enclosed within a vacuum-tight housing. The whiplashing of a broken strand breaks one or more glass tubes. This causes the housing to be flooded with the <b>braking</b> <b>fluid</b> thereby <b>braking</b> the rotation of the flywheel...|$|R
2500|$|Cats can succumb {{quickly from}} {{ethylene}} glycol poisoning, after ingesting {{as little as}} one teaspoon. The primary source of ethylene glycol is automotive antifreeze or radiator coolant, where concentrations are high. Other sources of antifreeze include windshield deicing agents, <b>brake</b> <b>fluid,</b> motor oil, developing solutions for hobby photographers, wood stains, solvents, and paints. [...] Some people put antifreeze into their cabin’s toilet {{to prevent it from}} freezing during the winter, resulting in toxicities when animals drink from the toilet. Small amounts of antifreeze may be contained in holiday ornaments such as snow globes. A cat suspected of having ingested ethylene glycol requires immediate veterinary treatment, to receive an antidote within three hours. The earlier the treatment is started, the greater the chance of survival.|$|E
2500|$|Hydraulic brakes {{also use}} brake levers to push fluid through a hose to move pistons in a caliper, thus forcing pads against a braking surface. [...] While {{hydraulic}} rim brakes exist, today the hydraulic actuation mechanism is identified mostly with disc brakes. Two types of <b>brake</b> <b>fluid</b> are used today: mineral oil and DOT fluid. Mineral oil is generally inert, while DOT is corrosive to frame paint {{but has a}} higher boiling point. Using the wrong fluid can cause seals to swell or become corroded. A hydraulic mechanism is closed and therefore less likely have problems related to contamination at exposed areas. Hydraulic brakes rarely fail, but failure tends to be complete. [...] Hydraulic systems require specialized equipment to repair.|$|E
2500|$|The {{strike was}} the most violent {{industrial}} dispute in Britain of the 20th century. [...] Strikes in the British coal industry {{had a history of}} violence, but the 1984–85 strike exceeded even the 1926 strike in the levels of violence. [...] Nevertheless, the majority of pickets lines were non-violent. Instances of violence directed against working miners were reported from the start. The BBC reported that pickets from Polmaise colliery had punched miners at Bilston Glen who were trying to enter their workplace on 12 March. Property, families and pets belonging to [...] working miners were also attacked. [...] Ted McKay, the North Wales secretary who supported a national ballot before strike action, said he had received death threats and threats to kidnap his children. [...] The intimidation of working miners in Nottinghamshire, vandalism to cars and pelting them with stones, paint or <b>brake</b> <b>fluid,</b> was {{a major factor in the}} formation of the breakaway Union of Democratic Mineworkers.|$|E
50|$|<b>Brake</b> <b>fluids</b> {{must not}} corrode the metals used inside {{components}} such as calipers, wheel cylinders, master cylinders and ABS control valves. They must also protect against corrosion as moisture enters the system. Additives (corrosion inhibitors) {{are added to}} the base fluid to accomplish this. Silicone is less corrosive to paintwork unlike glycol-ether based DOT fluids.|$|R
50|$|<b>Brake</b> <b>fluids</b> with {{different}} DOT ratings {{can not always}} be mixed. It must be of the same type, and at least the same rating. DOT 5.1 can replace DOT 4 and 3, DOT 4 can replace DOT 3. DOT 5 should not be mixed {{with any of these}} as mixing of glycol with silicone fluid may cause corrosion because of trapped moisture.|$|R

5000|$|In December 2010, certain 2005-2007 model Acura RLs {{were subject}} to a safety recall for {{potential}} leaking of the brake master cylinder seal. [...] A seal in the brake master cylinder may be susceptible to damage following the use of <b>brake</b> <b>fluid</b> other than the recommended Acura or (Honda) Genuine DOT3 <b>brake</b> <b>fluid.</b> If the seal is damaged, it {{can result in a}} <b>brake</b> <b>fluid</b> leak under certain conditions. If a leak should occur, the driver might see a low <b>brake</b> <b>fluid</b> indicator light or a <b>BRAKE</b> <b>FLUID</b> LOW or CHECK BRAKE SYSTEM message. If the driver continues to drive the vehicle after receiving this message without refilling the <b>brake</b> <b>fluid</b> reservoir, it could result in a brake pedal that feels soft or spongy, and may eventually affect braking performance, increasing the risk of a crash. Affected vehicles were to be inspected and repaired, as applicable, at no charge. Reportedly, this recall applied to both 2005-2007 Acura RL and 2005-2007 Honda Odyssey models.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike {{polyethylene}} glycol based fluids, Dot 5 is hydrophobic.
