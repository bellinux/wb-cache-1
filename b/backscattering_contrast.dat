Excellent methods exist to obtain structures of molecules at atomic, organelles at electron microscopic, and tissue at light−microscopic resolution. A gap exists, however, when 3 D tissue structure {{needs to be}} reconstructed over hundreds of micrometers with a resolution sufficient to follow the thinnest cellular processes and to identify small organelles such as synaptic vesicles. Such 3 D data are, however, essential to understand cellular networks that, particularly in the nervous system, need to be completely reconstructed throughout a substantial spatial volume. Here we demonstrate that datasets meeting these requirements {{can be obtained by}} automated block−face imaging combined with serial sectioning inside the chamber of a scanning electron microscope. <b>Backscattering</b> <b>contrast</b> is used to visualize the heavy−metal staining of tissue prepared using techniques that are routine for transmission electron microscopy. Low−vacuum (20 − 60 Pa H 2 O) conditions prevent charging of the uncoated block face. The resolution is sufficient to trace even the thinnest axons and to identify synapses. Stacks of several hundred sections, 50 − 70 nm thick, have been obtained at a lateral position jitter of typically under 10 nm. This opens the possibility of automatically obtaining the electron−microscope−level 3 D datasets needed to completely reconstruct the connectivity of neuronal circuit...|$|E

40|$|A {{potential}} {{strategy for}} wide area airborne mine/minefield detection {{is to identify}} localized areas of soil that have been disturbed due to mine emplacement amidst the undisturbed soil. Disturbed and undisturbed soils are rough in varying degrees and this roughness affects the backscattering behavior at the microwave frequencies. We investigated the feasibility of using high-frequency radar (8 - 18 GHz) backscatter measurements to detect the residual surface disturbances caused by recent mine emplacement. Radar backscatter measurements from recently buried landmines were obtained at a government minefield data collection site. Case studies of radar backscatter from landmines buried in dirt and gravel for varying incident angles are presented. These results demonstrate that the surface roughness contrast between disturbed and undisturbed soils can be exploited to assist in mine detection operations. The maximum radar <b>backscatter</b> <b>contrast</b> between the disturbed and undisturbed soils was observed at normal incidence.

The primer consists of a Li 2 CO 3 inhibitor phase, along with other inorganic phases including TiO 2, BaSO 4 and Mg-(hydr) oxide. The characterisation techniques included particle induced X-ray and γ-ray emission spectroscopies (PIXE and PIGE, respectively) on a nuclear microprobe, as well as SEM/EDS hyperspectral mapping. Of the techniques used, only PIGE was able to directly map the Li distribution, although the distribution of Li 2 CO 3 particles could be inferred from SEM through using <b>backscatter</b> <b>contrast</b> and EDS.

Snow moisture and large-scale surface roughness are demonstrated to have the largest effect upon HH polarization scattering cross-section sigma(HH) (O) and large differences are predicted between undeformed floe surfaces and deformed or undulating rough ice surfaces. Using a parametric approach, an approximate picture of rough and smooth ice signatures and their relative contrast are provided. The models reproduce a trend observed in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images of increasing <b>backscatter</b> <b>contrast</b> between deformed and underformed ice over an early period of warning: such observations are consistent with the results of analysis of SAR images to date.

SAR technology has been advanced as a complementary and alternative approach to optical remote sensing and in-situ measurement. Water bodies in SAR imagery represent low brightness induced by low backscattering, and reservoir storage {{can be derived from}} the <b>backscatter</b> <b>contrast</b> with the level-area-volume relationship of each reservoir. The threshold segmentation over the routine preprocessing of SAR images such as speckle reduction and low-pass filtering concluded a significant correlation between the SAR-derived reservoir storage and the observation record in spite of the considerable disagreement. The result showed up critical limitations for adopting SAR data to reservoir monitoring as follows: the inappropriate specifications of SAR data, the unreliable rating curve of reservoir, the lack of climatic information such as wind and precipitation, the interruption of inside and neighboring land cover, and so on. Furthermore, better accuracy of SAR-based reservoir monitoring could be expected through different alternatives such as multi-sensor image fusion, water level measurement wit...|$|R

The small ice spheres were produced by spraying fine water droplets directly into liquid nitrogen. The resulting mean particle radii are 1. 47 + 0. 96 - 0. 58 μm. Such a material shares many properties with ice in comets and at the surface of icy satellites. Measurements show that the fresh sample material is highly <b>backscattering,</b> <b>contrasting</b> with natural terrestrial snow and frost. The formation of agglomerates of particles during the sample production results in a noticeable variability of the photometric properties of the samples in their initial state. We have also observed significant temporal evolutions of the scattering behavior of the samples, shifting towards more forward scattering within some tens of hours, resulting most likely from sintering processes. All reflectance data are fitted by the Hapke photometric model (1993 and 2002 formulation) with a one/two/three-parameter Henyey-Greenstein phase function and the resulting Hapke parameters are provided. These parameters can be used to compare laboratory results with the observed photometric behaviors of astronomical objects.

40|$|The Sentinel {{satellite}} constellation series, developed {{and operated by}} the European Space Agency, represents the dedicated space component of the European Copernicus program, committed to long-term operational services in environment, climate and security. We developed, tested and evaluated an algorithm for generating maps of snowmelt area from C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data of the Sentinel- 1 mission. For snowmelt classification, a change detection method is applied, using multitemporal dual-polarized SAR data acquired in Interferometric Wide swath (IW) mode, the basic operation mode over land surfaces. Of particular benefit for wet snow retrievals are the high instrument stability, the high spatial resolution across the 250 km wide swath, and the short revisit time. In order to study the impact of polarization, we generated maps of melting snow using data of the VV-polarized channel, the VH-polarized channel and a combined VV- and VH-based channel using a weighting function that accounts for effects of the local incidence angle. Comparisons are performed with snow maps derived from Landsat images over study areas in the Alps and in Iceland. The pixel-by-pixel comparisons show good agreement between the snow products of the two sensors, with the best performance for retrievals based on the combined (VV and VH) channel and a minor decline for the VH-based product. The VV-based snowmelt extent product shows a drop-off in quality over areas with steep terrain because of the decreasing <b>backscatter</b> <b>contrast</b> of snow-covered versus snow-free surfaces on fore-slopes.

The influence on non-uniform piezoelectric boundaries in lithium niobate transducers is addressed. The potential for multiple piezoelectric zones is also investigated, through modelling of three and more inversion layers through the transducer thickness.

Using Mg II and Fe II emission and absorption as tracers, {{we find that the}} clumps of star formation are driving galactic outflows with velocities of 170 to 250 km/s. The velocities of Mg II emission are redshifted with respect to the systemic velocities of the galaxy, consistent with being <b>backscattered.</b> By <b>contrast,</b> the Fe II fluorescent emission lines are either slightly blueshifted or at the systemic velocity of the galaxy. Taken together, the velocity structure of the Mg II and Fe II emission is consistent with arising through scattering in galactic winds. Assuming a thin shell geometry for the outflowing gas, the estimated masses carried out by these outflows are large (approx 30 - 50 M/yr), with mass loading factors several times the star formation rate. Almost 20 per cent to 50 per cent of the blueshifted absorption probably escapes the gravitational potential of the galaxy. In this galaxy, the outflow is 'locally sourced', that is, the properties of the outflow in each line of sight are dominated by the properties of the nearest clump of star formation; the wind is not global to the galaxy.

Characterisation of one such clast shows that in addition to Ca-carbonate it contains magnetite, olivine and orthopyroxene grains that are supported within a finely crystalline saponite–serpentine–ferrihydrite groundmass. The Ca-carbonate grains are typically rounded, less than 10 μm in diameter, and backscatter Kikuchi patterns identify all those analysed as calcite. Electron <b>backscatter</b> diffraction orientation <b>contrast</b> maps show that most calcites have sub-μm sized e-twins, some of which are cut by corroded grain margins. These microstructures demonstrate that the clast experienced very mild shock during aqueous alteration and probably accompanying impact ‘gardening’ of the parent body regolith. The sample studied hosts several other millimeter sized clasts and a fine grained clastic matrix that are free of Ca-carbonate, olivine and orthopyroxene although can contain apatite, dolomite and pyrrhotite. Within one of these clasts is a network of phyllosilicate–magnetite veins that are inferred to have acted as fluid flow conduits during parent body aqueous alteration. Sulphur-rich reaction rims within the same clast are likely to have formed during post-fall remobilization and crystallization of pre-terrestrial sulphates. This study provides good evidence for alteration of the CI {{carbonaceous chondrite}}s in a dynamic parent body regolith...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2015 This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} two core aspects of remote sensing: (a) {{interpretation of the}} remotely sensed data to identify and characterize sea surface features of interest, and (b) the quantitative analysis of previously characterized features to produce robust estimates of geophysical variables. Specifically, these aspects are addressed {{in the context of}} the nearshore coastal ocean, utilizing a land-based, imaging X-band marine radar. With regard to the latter aspect (b), a robust, phase based depth estimate algorithm is extended to marine radar imagery with the purpose of assessing both absolute and relative performance against optical video derived depths. Depth estimates at both a nearby (< 1 km) and a moderately distant (2 - 3 km) beach are accurate to ∼ 0. 5 m, with global bias of ∼± 0. 3 m; these results are comparable to those acquired via optical video, and performance trends with depth for the two sensors appear complementary. Extended to larger (inlet) domains that require the spatial coverage of marine radar imagery, algorithm performance remains at roughly the same level during slack; currents induce an unmodeled Doppler shift that produces wave frequency-and depth-dependent error that should not be neglected. Mitigation and solution strategies are discussed. With regard to the former aspect (a), sharp internal and interfacial gradients in the water column at a highly stratified estuary mouth are identified in marine radar imagery. The identified features include an internal, oblique hydraulic jump, a bottom salinity front, and a surface intrusion front. Confirmation of co-located, sharp current gradients that induce surface roughness modulations similar to those observed were carried out using remotely sensed surface current estimates (via airborne ATI-SAR) for the jump, and using vertical current profiles collected along cross-front transects via research vessel for the bottom and surface fronts. Presence of the frontal structures below the identified <b>backscatter</b> intensity <b>contrast</b> patterns is directly corroborated using salinity, temperature, and current data from bottom-mounted, ship-mounted, and ship-cast sensors, and presence of the internal jump is indirectly inferred using an inviscid two-layer model. Horizontal evolution of the jump and fronts in the estuary mouth is tracked in quasi-continuous marine radar image time series...|$|R
40|$|An {{in vitro}} {{system for the}} {{investigation}} of the behaviour of contrast microbubbles in an ultrasound field, that provides a full diagnostic range of settings, is yet to be presented in the literature. The evaluation of a good compromise of such a system is presented in this paper. It is based on (a) an HDI 3000 ATL scanner (Bothell, WA, USA) externally controlled by a PC and (b) on the use of well-defined reference materials. The suspensions of the reference ultrasonic scattering material are placed in an anechoic tank. The pulse length ranges from 2 to 10 cycles, the acoustic pressure from 0. 08 to 1. 8 MPa, the transmit frequency from 1 to 4. 3 MHz, and the receive frequency from 1 to 8 MHz. The collection of 256 samples of RF data, at an offset distance from the transducer face, was performed at 20 MHz digitization rate, which corresponds to approximately 1 cm depth in water. Two particle suspensions are also presented for use as reference scatterers for contrast studies: (a) a suspension of Orgasol® (ELF Atochem, Paris, France) particles (~ 5 μm mean diameter) and (b) a suspension of Eccosphere® (New Metals & Chemicals Ltd, Essex, UK) particles (~ 50 μm mean diameter). A preliminary experiment with the contrast agent Definity (DuPont Pharmaceutical Co, Waltham, MA) showed that the above two materials are suitable for use as a reference for <b>contrast</b> <b>backscatter...</b>|$|R
40|$|Evolution of {{vulnerable}} carotid plaques {{are crucial}} reason for cerebral ischemic strokes and identifying {{them in the}} early stage can become very important in avoiding the risk of stroke. In order to improve the identification and quantification accuracy of infancy plaques better visualization techniques are needed. Improving the visualization and quantification of neovascularization in carotid plaque using contrast enhanced ultrasound imaging still remains a challenging task. In this thesis work, three optimization techniques are proposed, which showed an improvement in the sensitivity of contrast agents {{when compared to the}} conventional clinical settings and insonation strategies. They are as follows: 1) Insonation at harmonic specific (2 nd harmonic) resonance frequency instead of resonance frequency based on maximum energy absorption provides enhanced nonlinear contribution. 2) At high frequency ultrasound imaging, shorter pulse length will provide improved harmonic signal content when compared to longer pulse lengths. Applying this concept to multi- pulse sequencing (Pulse Inversion and Cadence contrast pulse sequencing) resulted in increased magnitude of the remaining harmonic signal after pulse summations. 3) Peak negative pressure optimization of Pulse Inversion and Cadence contrast pulse sequencing was showed to further enhance the nonlinear content of the <b>backscattered</b> signal from <b>contrast</b> microbubbles without increasing the safety limits, defined by the mechanical index. The results presented in this thesis are based on computational modeling (Bubblesim software) and as a future continuation we plan to verify the simulation results with vitro studies...|$|R
