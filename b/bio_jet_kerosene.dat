40|$|Biofuels are {{essential}} {{for the future of}} aviation. The airline industry is a worldwide operating business to transport passengers and freight in an economical and fast manner. <b>Jet</b> engines consume <b>kerosene</b> to power the aircraft. However, kerosene is a distillate of crude oil and airlines are entirely dependent on this energy source. As a result, airlines are facing two problems. Firstly, the energy security is at stake when the conventional oil resources are depleted. Secondly, green house gases are produced by burning fossil fuels. Carbon dioxide is one of them and it is regarded by scientists as contributor to climate change (IPCC fourth assessment report group I, 2007). Biofuels solve these two issues, as they are renewable and they emit less carbon dioxide. Several airlines have already conducted test flights with biofuels, such as Virgin Atlantic, Air New Zeeland, Japan Air Lines and KLM. Feedstocks for these biofuels were camelina, jatropha and micro algae. Macro algae are also a feedstock for biofuels. This report is dedicated to the feasibility of <b>bio</b> <b>jet</b> fuel from macro algae from an end-to-end chain perspective. The main research fields were on the technical side, sustainability side and economical side of the <b>bio</b> <b>jet</b> fuel. Technically, it is possible to produce <b>bio</b> <b>jet</b> fuel from macro algae. Several macro algae cultivation methods and conversion methods exists to produce <b>bio</b> <b>jet</b> fuel. It is also better for the environment. The carbon dioxide emissions are reduced at least with 75 % compare to fossil fuels. Besides this, the energy balance is also positive. More energy is produced in the form of biofuel than the energy is needed to produce it. An issue so far is the economical side of <b>bio</b> <b>jet</b> fuel. <b>Bio</b> <b>jet</b> fuel is substantially more expensive than fossil fuels. The price will decline when the production of macro algae increase. The transition from fossil fuels to biofuels will take decades and large investments {{are essential}}. In this report, several actions are discussed how the transition to <b>bio</b> <b>jet</b> fuels can be accelerated. Aerodynamics & Wind EnergyAerospace Engineerin...|$|R

40|$|This {{document}} {{presents a}} study about the viability and profability of a <b>bio</b> <b>jet</b> fuel production made of tobacco seeds oil. Firstly, an analisis {{about the state}} and role that <b>bio</b> <b>jet</b> fuel plays nowadays in the aeronautic industry is made, finding that although more than 2500 flights have been successfully operated using alternative fuels until 2016, vegetable oil based <b>bio</b> <b>jet</b> fuel productions represent an inexperienced study field, with great expectations and future ahead. Aeronautic organizations and airlines had commited with the main goal of neutralize green house growing emissions by 2020 and reduce by half of the levels reported in 2005 by 2050, <b>bio</b> <b>jet</b> fuels have become the main way of achieving that goal. Furthermore, economic fines will be charged to the companies that will not fulfill the emission level requirements. In 2011, Hydrotreated Esters of Fatty Acids HEFA technology is approved inside the ASTM D 7566 - 11 standard. The standard allows fabrication and comercialization of biojet fuels made of vegetable seed oils. Talking about viability, the biojet fuel production made of tobacco seed oil is viable at a local level. Spain, a country with small tobacco productions, {{has the power to}} produce about 2 million liters of biojet fuel, allowing to satisfy about 22 % of the anual fuel consumption used in the route Barcelona-Mallorca operated by a low cost airliner like Vueling, helping to reduce the green house emissions produced in that route. Finally, it is concluded that the individual process of fabricating biojet fuel with tobacco seed oil is not profitable selling at competitive prices, however; the global process taking into account co-products generated, it is profitable and competitive in the market...|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} source of carbon dioxide emissions is the aviation industry, which accounts approximately for 2 percent globally. Therefore, reducing these emissions {{has become a major}} challenge for air travel authorities worldwide. One solution to the problem is the deployment of <b>bio</b> <b>jet</b> fuel, which is a green alternative to the traditional jet fuel and can result in an 80 percent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions. The production of <b>bio</b> <b>jet</b> fuel, however, is to date more expensive relative to the production of traditional jet fuel and leads, as a result, to a higher price of flight tickets. Consequently, this study investigates Swedish companies’ willingness to pay for flying with 50 percent <b>bio</b> <b>jet</b> fuel by employing the contingent valuation method. The results obtained show that the average price premium is 11. 5 percent, and that significant differences in the level of willingness to pay are found for different flight destinations; a result that provides valuable insights into pricing strategies for airlines operating on these destinations. The fact that companies employ certain booking policies have as well significant impacts on the estimated willingness to pay. Overall, {{the results of this study}} will increase airlines’ awareness about the economic possibilities for them to begin the process of implementing the green alternative...|$|R

Despite Albanian efforts and some initial success in repairing the engines of the MiGs, the lack of specific jet fuel forced authorities to start production in a national scale, thus resulting in a low-quality production (The first attempt dates on 1961, when the Kuçova factory produced the special <b>Jet</b> <b>kerosene</b> called TSI). The fuel conditioned the life-time of the jet engines and often was blamed as the main reason of the deadly incidents (35 Albanian pilots lost their life from 1955 to 2005 mainly due to MiG's mechanical failures).|$|R

40|$|After {{the first}} flight was made in 1903 the growth of {{aviation}} has been enormous since then {{and is expected to}} go on the coming decades. In 2009 2. 3 billion passengers and 38 million tons of freight have been handled by airlines. Over time it became clear that aviation has some large negative side effects.

This study focuses on what possible transition routes are according to stakeholders involved. This is done by performing 20 interviews and using this data as input for four social technical scenarios. Four scenarios have been created which deviated on the rate of technological development and whether or not sustainability policies were applied. The scenario with a high technological development and a focus on energy security will have the highest application rate in 2050.

During the interviews it also became clear that the visions as mentioned by stakeholders show some notable deviations from the literature.
