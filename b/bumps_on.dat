5|$|The {{matching}} rules distinguish {{sides of the}} tiles, and entail that tiles may be juxtaposed in certain particular ways but not in others. Two ways to describe these {{matching rules}} are shown in {{the image on the}} right. In one form, tiles must be assembled such that the curves on the faces match in color and position across an edge. In the other, tiles must be assembled such that the <b>bumps</b> <b>on</b> their edges fit together.|$|E
5|$|There is a {{large body}} of {{evidence}} showing that dromaeosaurids were covered in feathers. Some dromaeosaurid fossils preserve long, pennaceous feathers on the hands and arms (remiges) and tail (rectrices), as well as shorter, down-like feathers covering the body. Other fossils, which do not preserve actual impressions of feathers, still preserve the associated <b>bumps</b> <b>on</b> the forearm bones where long wing feathers would have attached in life. Overall, this feather pattern looks very much like Archaeopteryx.|$|E
5|$|Wynnea {{americana}} {{is distinguished}} from other {{species in the}} genus Wynnea by the pustules (small <b>bumps)</b> <b>on</b> the outer surface, and microscopically by the large asymmetrical longitudinally ribbed spores with a sharply pointed tip. The spores are made in structures called asci, which have thickened rings at one end that are capped by a hinged structure known as the operculum—a lid that is opened when spores are {{to be released from}} the ascus.|$|E

5|$|Bony crests {{are found}} on the skulls of many theropods, {{including}} many tyrannosaurids. Alioramus, a possible tyrannosaurid from Mongolia, bears a single row of five prominent bony <b>bumps</b> <b>on</b> the nasal bones; a similar row of much lower bumps is present on the skull of Appalachiosaurus, {{as well as some}} specimens of Daspletosaurus, Albertosaurus, and Tarbosaurus. In Albertosaurus, Gorgosaurus and Daspletosaurus, there is a prominent horn in front of each eye on the lacrimal bone. The lacrimal horn is absent in Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus, which instead have a crescent-shaped crest behind each eye on the postorbital bone. These head crests may have been used for display, perhaps for species recognition or courtship behavior.|$|E
5|$|Based on Z. tonsora, queens {{are similar}} in {{appearance}} to Gerontoformica based on the mandibular structure; these mandibles have two teeth, {{one of which is}} apical (situated closer to the apex) and the other is subapical (below the apex tooth). Other similar body structures include the large ocelli, short scapes, 12 antennomeres (antenna segments), small eyes, and a clypeal margin that has a row of peg-like denticles (small <b>bumps</b> <b>on</b> a tooth). Queens can be distinguished from Gerontoformica by their flattened, broad heads. They have a broad, concave clypeal margin with a high number of denticles and two short vertical rows of denticles. They have mandibles which are half the length of Gerontoformica and have a dense brush of spicule-like setae. Furthermore, the vertex (the upper surface of the head) has a pair of oval-shaped rugose (wrinkled) patches.|$|E
5|$|Both sexes have {{prominent}} horn-like structures called ossicones, {{which are}} formed from ossified cartilage, covered in skin and fused to the skull at the parietal bones. Being vascularized, the ossicones {{may have a}} role in thermoregulation, and are also used in combat between males. Appearance is a reliable guide to the sex or age of a giraffe: the ossicones of females and young are thin and display tufts of hair on top, whereas those of adult males end in knobs and tend to be bald on top. Also, a median lump, which is more prominent in males, emerges {{at the front of the}} skull. Males develop calcium deposits that form <b>bumps</b> <b>on</b> their skulls as they age. A giraffe's skull is lightened by multiple sinuses. However, as males age, their skulls become heavier and more club-like, helping them become more dominant in combat. The upper jaw has a grooved palate and lacks front teeth. The giraffe's molars have a rough surface.|$|E

5|$|Hamilton {{was once}} again fastest during third {{practice}} on Saturday morning, even while suffering from overheating under his seat. The two Mercedes cars were separated by two-tenths of a second with the two Ferraris of Vettel and Kimi Räikkönen behind, another half a second down. Red Bull had a slight upturn in fortune, with Daniel Ricciardo and Daniil Kvyat finishing fifth and sixth respectively. McLaren-Honda had another problematic session as Fernando Alonso stopped the car just after starting his installation lap. Teammate Jenson Button was called into the pit lane as well, citing a similar problem with the engine, but was able to continue later in the session. Felipe Massa experienced smoke in his cockpit both on Friday and Saturday, apparently caused by the new titanium plates underneath the cars which also create sparks when driving over <b>bumps</b> <b>on</b> the track.|$|E
5|$|In September 2008, Apple sent a {{cease and desist}} {{letter to}} the Victoria School of Business and Technology in Saanich, British Columbia, {{claiming}} the school's logo infringed Apple's trademark rights and that the school's logo falsely suggested Apple had authorized the school's activities. The logo in question featured the outline of an apple and a leaf, although the design incorporated a mountain, had three <b>bumps</b> <b>on</b> top of the apple instead of the two used by Apple, and had no bite out of the apple, unlike Apple's logo. In April 2011, the school reported it had settled its 3-year dispute with Apple, was launching a new logo under a new name, Q College, and was expanding its operations. The settlement's full terms were undisclosed.|$|E
5|$|Tarbosaurus and Alioramus shared several skull features, {{including}} a locking mechanism {{in the lower}} jaw between the dentary and angular bones, and both lacked the prong of the nasal bones which connected to the lacrimal bones in all other tyrannosaurids except adult Daspletosaurus. The two genera may be closely related, representing an Asian branch of the Tyrannosauridae. Some specimens of Tarbosaurus have a row of <b>bumps</b> <b>on</b> the nasal bones like those of Alioramus, although much lower. The long and low shape of the only known Alioramus remotus skull indicated that it was immature when it died and might even have been a juvenile Tarbosaurus, which {{lived in the same}} time and place. The more prominent nasal crests and much higher tooth count of Alioramus, however, suggested it was a separate taxon, even if it is known only from juvenile remains, confirmed by the discovery of A. altai. Specimens identified as immature Tarbosaurus have the same tooth count as adults.|$|E

5|$|The Mk 41 Stable Vertical (also called Gun Director) was a {{vertical}} seeking gyroscope. Its function {{was to establish}} and maintain a stable earth vertical with its associated horizontal plane. With the horizontal plane established, the Mk 41 continuously measured the angles between the deck and the horizontal plane. These deck angles were continuously transmitted to the Rangekeeper so that it could keep the guns correctly elevated as the ship rolled and pitched. Mounted waist high on its side were the battery's firing keys. (see picture) The left key was the Salvo Signal Key, and it sounded the Salvo Buzzer in each of the turrets to warn the gun crews that the guns were about to fire. The center key (with <b>bumps</b> <b>on</b> its handle for tactile identification) was the Automatic Firing Key. When this key was held closed, the Mk 41 was enabled to automatically fire the guns whenever the ship's deck was parallel the horizontal plane. Also, if the sea state was such that the turrets' elevation power drives could not keep up with the ship's motion, the guns could be held at a fixed elevation, and the MK 41 could again automatically fire the guns as described. The right key was the Hand Firing Key. It bypassed the Mk 41, and fired the guns directly.|$|E
5|$|The {{green and}} golden bell frog was first {{described}} as Rana aurea by Lesson in 1827. It has changed classification 20 times; {{it was first}} named Litoria aurea in 1844 by Günther, and changed another 9 times before being named again as Litoria aurea. The specific epithet aurea derived from the Latin aureus for 'golden'. The species is now classified within the Litoria aurea complex, a closely related group of frogs in the Litoria genus. This complex is scattered throughout Australia: three species occur in south-east Australia, one in northern Australia, and two in Southwest Australia. The complex consists of the green and golden bell frog (L. aurea), growling grass frog (L. raniformis), yellow-spotted bell frog (L. castanea), Dahl's aquatic frog (L. dahlii), spotted-thighed frog (L. cyclorhyncha) and the motorbike frog (L. moorei). The ranges of L. raniformis and L. castanea overlap with the green and golden bell frog; this, {{as well as physical}} similarities, may make it difficult to distinguish between the species, and until 1972, L. raniformis and the green and golden bell frog were regarded as the same, when electrophoretic studies proved them to be distinct. The tablelands bell frog has not been seen since 1980 and may now be extinct, although the large yellow spots present on its thighs help distinguish it from the green and golden bell frog. The growling grass frog, which is very similar to the green and golden bell frog, can only be readily distinguished by raised <b>bumps</b> <b>on</b> the dorsal surface. It has also been proposed that some populations of L. aurea located near Ulong, New South Wales, be a separate subspecies, L. a. ulongae, but this was not accepted.|$|E

25|$|Non-surgical {{rhinoplasty}} is {{a medical}} procedure in which injectable fillers, such as collagen or hyaluronic acid, are used to alter and shape a person's nose without invasive surgery. The procedure fills in depressed areas on the nose, lifting {{the angle of the}} tip or smoothing the appearance of <b>bumps</b> <b>on</b> the bridge. The procedure does not alter nose size, though {{it can be used to}} correct some functional birth defects.|$|E
25|$|In {{that same}} year, Stark Bro's Nurseries & Orchards Co. {{discovered}} the 'Delicious' apple, an elongated fruit with five <b>bumps</b> <b>on</b> the calyx end.

He called the new 'Delicious' variety “the finest-flavored apple in all the world.” It was also in 1893 that the Starks began their storied cooperation with Luther Burbank and his fantastic new varieties of fruits.|$|E

25|$|The PfEMP1 {{molecule}} is deposited at the RBC membrane at the knobs. These knobs {{are easily}} identified as conspicuous <b>bumps</b> <b>on</b> the infected RBCs {{from the early}} trophozoite stage onward. The malarial parasite cannot induce its virulence on RBCs without knobs. As many as 10,000 knobs are distributed throughout {{the surface of a}} mature infected RBC, and each knob is 50-80nm in diameter. The export of pfEMP1 from Maurer's cleft to RBC membrane is mediated by binding of another protein produced by the parasite called knob-associated histidine-rich protein (KAHRP). KAHRP enhances the structural rigidity of infected RBC and adhesion of PfEMP1 on the knobs. It is also directly responsible for forming knobs, as indicated by the fact that kahrp gene-deficient malarial parasites do not form knobs. To form a knob, KAHRP aggregates several membrane skeletal proteins of the host RBC, such as spectrin, actin, ankyrin R, and spectrin–actin band 4.1 complex. Upon arrival at the knob, PfEMP1 is attached to the spectrin network using the PHIST proteins.|$|E
25|$|Lymphatics {{ultimately}} drain {{into the}} bloodstream, so the plague bacteria may enter {{the blood and}} travel to almost {{any part of the}} body. In septicemic plague, bacterial endotoxins cause disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), causing tiny clots throughout the body and possibly ischaemic necrosis (tissue death due to lack of circulation/perfusion to that tissue) from the clots. DIC results in depletion of the body's clotting resources, so that it can no longer control bleeding. Consequently, there is bleeding into the skin and other organs, which can cause red and/or black patchy rash and hemoptysis/hematemesis (coughing up/ vomiting of blood). There are <b>bumps</b> <b>on</b> the skin that look somewhat like insect bites; these are usually red, and sometimes white in the center. Untreated, septicemic plague is usually fatal. Early treatment with antibiotics reduces the mortality rate to between 4 and 15 percent. People who die from this form of plague often die on the same day symptoms first appear.|$|E
