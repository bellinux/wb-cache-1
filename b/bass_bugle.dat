25|$|Founded by {{clarinet}}ist Juan de Dios Alfonso, {{who moved}} to Havana, where he played clarinet in Feliciano Ramos's band La Unión in 1856, and directed La Almendares in 1859. It is not quite clear when he formed La Flor de Cuba, which {{became one of the}} most popular in the middle of the 19th century. They played contradanzas, and other dances of the time. The orchestra was a típica, with cornet, trombone, ophicleide, two clarinets, two violins, double bass, kettle drum, and güíro. The ophicleide (ophicleide) was a sort of <b>bass</b> <b>bugle</b> with keys, invented in 1817; the t-bone would be a valve trombone.|$|E

50|$|In Cuba a típica is an {{ensemble}} mainly composed of wind instruments. They have existed {{at least from}} the middle of the 19th century to the present day. One of the earliest, Orquesta Flor de Cuba, had the following make-up: cornet, trombone, figle (ophicleide), two clarinets, two violins, double bass, kettle drum, and güiro. The ophicleide was a sort of <b>bass</b> <b>bugle</b> with keys, invented in 1817, now superseded by the tuba and/or baritone horn, the name surviving for a pipe organ stop; the trombone would be more typically a valved rather than a slide instrument. See Early Cuban bands for more examples.|$|E

50|$|Valley Forge Military Academy and College has a {{corps of}} drums {{that is part}} of the regimental band. Uniforms and music are {{modelled}} on the Royal Marines Corps of Drums. VFMAC does have a similar but separate formation which is part of the Corps of Cadets (VFMAC Field Music) which only uses drums (snares, tenors and <b>basses),</b> cymbals and <b>bugles</b> and from 2011, fifes. Formed in 1956, it also provides the official guard-of-honour for visitors to the Delaware Valley area.|$|R
50|$|Like the British Army, Military snare (side) drums (MSD) are the {{principal}} instrument of the corps of drums; however, another core instrument is the <b>bugle.</b> <b>Bass</b> drums are often used during parades and drum displays, while cymbals and single tenor drums are used during parades and ceremonies only. Herald Fanfare trumpets (natural trumpets) are also performed on such occasions where a bugle fanfare would be inappropriate for such. The corps is led by a drum major and a bugle major serves as {{the principal}} player for it.|$|R

50|$|Fanfare bands {{composed}} of either single or multiple tenor drums, snare drums, natural horns, natural trumpets, fanfare trumpets (chromatic and herald) and <b>bugles.</b> <b>Bass</b> drums, cymbals, glockenspiels and timpani are sometimes added or are also permanent {{parts of the}} band instrumentation. The group is usually led by either a drum major or a bugle major that coordinates the timing and speed of the music being played. Only several bands in Germany add the turkish crescent {{as part of the}} ensemble. In France and the Netherlands, they are sometimes paired with brass instruments, and are led by a bandmaster (France only, optional in Dutch bands) with a drum major.|$|R
