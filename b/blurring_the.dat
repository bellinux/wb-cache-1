5|$|Battlecruisers {{served in}} the navies of the UK, Germany, the Ottoman Empire, Australia and Japan during World War I, most notably at the Battle of the Falkland Islands and in the several raids and skirmishes in the North Sea which culminated in a pitched fleet battle, the Battle of Jutland. British battlecruisers in {{particular}} suffered heavy losses at Jutland, where their light armour made them very vulnerable to large-caliber shells. By {{the end of the}} war, capital ship design had developed with battleships becoming faster and battlecruisers becoming more heavily armoured, <b>blurring</b> <b>the</b> distinction between a battlecruiser and a fast battleship. The Washington Naval Treaty, which limited capital ship construction from 1922 onwards, treated battleships and battlecruisers identically, and the new generation of battlecruisers planned was scrapped {{under the terms of the}} treaty.|$|E
5|$|Set in the People's Republic of China {{during the}} 1990s, the film {{centers on a}} 13-year-old {{substitute}} teacher, Wei Minzhi, in the Chinese countryside. Called in to substitute for a village teacher for one month, Wei is told not to lose any students. When {{one of the boys}} takes off in search of work in the big city, she goes looking for him. The film addresses education reform in China, the economic gap between urban and rural populations, and the prevalence of bureaucracy and authority figures in everyday life. It is filmed in a neorealist/documentary style with a troupe of non-professional actors who play characters with the same names and occupations as the actors have in real life, <b>blurring</b> <b>the</b> boundaries between drama and reality.|$|E
5|$|Sinoceratops was {{assigned}} to the taxon Centrosaurinae, as a basal member by Xu et al. (2010) based on characteristics present in the skull. Sinoceratops bears several characteristics that resemble features in chasmosaurines, <b>blurring</b> <b>the</b> distinction between the Centrosaurinae and Chasmosaurinae. According to Xu e.a. the basal position of Sinoceratops indicates that ceratopids originated in Asia. Sinoceratops however, shares a number of features with advanced centrosaurines such as Centrosaurus and Styracosaurus that are not seen in primitive centrosaurines like Diabloceratops, including a well-developed nose horn and reduced brow horns. The implication might be that this genus represents a lineage that invaded Asia from North America through Beringia.|$|E
40|$|A new {{restoration}} algorithm for partial {{blurred image}} {{which is based}} on blur detection and classification is proposed in this paper. Firstly, a new blur detection algorithm is proposed to detect <b>the</b> <b>blurred</b> regions in <b>the</b> partial <b>blurred</b> image. Then, a new blur classification algorithm is proposed to classify <b>the</b> <b>blurred</b> regions. Once <b>the</b> <b>blur</b> class of <b>the</b> <b>blurred</b> regions is confirmed, the structure of <b>the</b> <b>blur</b> kernels of <b>the</b> <b>blurred</b> regions is confirmed. Then, <b>the</b> <b>blur</b> kernel estimation methods are adopted to estimate <b>the</b> <b>blur</b> kernels. In <b>the</b> end, <b>the</b> <b>blurred</b> regions are restored using nonblind image deblurring algorithm and replace <b>the</b> <b>blurred</b> regions in <b>the</b> partial <b>blurred</b> image with <b>the</b> restored regions. The simulated experiment shows that the proposed algorithm performs well...|$|R

5|$|Sweet Tooth {{is a love}} story, a spy novel, and a {{book about}} {{literature}} itself. Serena and her boyfriend Haley– she a well-read but uncritical lover of literature, he a highly accomplished writer and literary scholar– have different attitudes towards literature. Serena prefers a realist approach, where life in the book reflects real life. Haley {{on the other hand}} is of a more modernist school, and enjoys experimentation in his work. McEwan plays with these differences, firstly by placing himself in the novel and <b>blurring</b> <b>the</b> line between author and character, and secondly by writing {{what appears to be a}} straight first-person narrative, only to distort this perception at the very end.|$|E
5|$|Pushing {{design to}} the limits, Simonovich-Efimova created puppets {{to be worn}} on the head, {{allowing}} the puppeteer to manipulate several characters simultaneously. She patented {{a new type of}} rod puppet with rods attached to the elbows to free up the hands. The rods were hidden behind hanging costumes. To make puppets look more lifelike, the Efimovs devised a system where the arms were elongated. Rods rather than the puppeteer's fingers were inserted into the glove to manipulate the arms, which were allowed to move by manipulating strings inside the body of the doll. Simonovich-Efimova utilized other apparatus, like springs in the body of a cat puppet to give it the flexibility of a live animal. These innovations allowed their finely formed, elegantly clad puppets to move about naturally, rather than with the stiff, jerky movements of their predecessors. In an era when almost all puppet performances were designed to entertain children or present government ideology, Simonovich-Efimova went {{out of her way to}} perform shows for adults, including The Enchanted Pear Tree, Macbeth, and works by Molière and Mikhail Saltykov-Shchedrin. Though she also made adaptations in her work with fables to replace what were seen as outmoded ideas, like replacing serfs with young communist characters, Simonovich-Efimova's focus was on artistry, entertainment and professionalism. She also developed a new system of life-sized manikins, <b>blurring</b> <b>the</b> lines between puppetry and acting, when she danced on stage with her Petrushka. Between 1920 and 1940, the Efimovs performed between 1,500 and 2,000 puppet shows.|$|E

25|$|The {{number of}} named species of {{bacteria}} and archaea (approximately 13,000) is surprisingly small considering their early evolution, genetic diversity and residence in all ecosystems.

25|$|The {{similarity}} between Metzinger's work of 1910 {{and that of}} Picasso is exemplified in his Nu à la cheminée. Though less so in Two Nudes, both pictures merge the model with the environment, <b>blurring</b> <b>the</b> distinction between background and foreground. Metzinger, however—in contrast to the extreme faceting, simultaneous views and multiple perspective—has rendered his elegant nudes with grace; the tall and slender models expressing tenderness towards one another (with a hand placed on the shoulder).|$|E

25|$|Although {{some early}} vibes players {{made use of}} four mallets, notably Red Norvo, Adrian Rollini, and {{sometimes}} Lionel Hampton, the fully pianistic four-mallet approach is almost entirely the creation of Burton. Many of the key techniques of the four-mallet style, such as multi-linear playing and the advanced dampening techniques described below, are easily applied to playing with two mallets and some modern two-mallet players have adapted these devices to their playing, somewhat <b>blurring</b> <b>the</b> distinctions between modern two- and four-mallet players.|$|E
25|$|Uruk's {{agricultural}} surplus and large population base facilitated {{processes such as}} trade, specialization of crafts {{and the evolution of}} writing.
