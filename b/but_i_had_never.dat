5|$|McDowell's {{statement}} of admission {{was published in}} David McKittrick's book Lost Lives:"There was very little planning. I only came into it because of my UDR connection {{and the fact that}} I had a uniform. I was given a sub-machine gun <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> fired it. I passed out when the explosion happened and that was when I lost the gun, the glasses, and a UDR beret".|$|E

As I read I became deeply fascinated by his campaigns of nonviolent resistance. I was {{particularly}} moved by his Salt March to the Sea and his numerous fasts. The whole concept of Satyagraha (Satya is truth which equals love, and agraha is force; Satyagraha, therefore, means truth force or love force) was profoundly significant to me. As I delved deeper into the philosophy of Gandhi, my skepticism concerning the power of love gradually diminished, and I came to see {{for the first time}} its potency in the area of social reform." ...|$|E
500|$|Eddie Condon, Hoagy Carmichael, and Mezz Mezzrow, {{all of whom}} hyperbolically {{raved about}} his playing, also saw Beiderbecke play live or {{performed}} alongside him. Condon, for instance, wrote of being amazed by Beiderbecke's piano playing: [...] "All my life I had been listening to music [...] <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> heard anything remotely like what Beiderbecke played. For the first time I realized music isn't all the same, it had become an entirely new set of sounds" [...] "I tried to explain Bix to the gang," [...] Carmichael wrote, but [...] "t was no good, like the telling of a vivid, personal dream [...] the emotion couldn't be transmitted." ...|$|E

500|$|Reagan {{assumed the}} role of {{unofficial}} [...] "protector" [...] for her husband after the attempted assassination in 1981. On March 30 of that year, President Reagan and three others were shot by troubled 25-year old John Hinckley, Jr as they left the Washington Hilton hotel. Nancy was alerted and arrived at George Washington University Hospital, where the President was hospitalized. She recalled having seen [...] "emergency rooms before, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> seen one like this – with my husband in it." [...] She was escorted into a waiting room, and when granted access to see her husband, he quipped to her, [...] "Honey, I forgot to duck", borrowing the defeated boxer Jack Dempsey's jest to his wife.|$|E
500|$|Sternberg, still {{prospecting}} for Cope that spring, was woken by a liveryman who relayed {{word from}} Annie that Cope had died three days earlier. Sternberg {{wrote in his}} memoirs, [...] "I had lost friends before, and I had known {{what it was to}} bury my own dead, even my firstborn son, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> sorrowed more deeply than I did over the news." [...] Cope's Quaker funeral consisted of six men: Osborn, his colleague William Berryman Scott, Cope's friend Persifor Frazer, son-in-law Collins, Horatio Wood, and Harrison Allen. The six sat around Cope's coffin among the fossils and Cope's pets, a tortoise and a Gila monster, for what Osborn called [...] "a perfect Quaker silence... an interminable length of time." [...] Anticipating the quiet, Osborn had brought along a Bible and read an excerpt from the Book of Job, ending by saying, [...] "These are the problems to which our friend devoted his life." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{creator and}} {{caretaker}} of the engine. Dustin Hoffman was {{considered for the}} role. About the character, Harris said, [...] "He's so built up, who this guy is, and then there's this big thing open, and he's just this old guy making dinner with his robe on, but director Bong really {{wanted him to be}} matter-of-fact and very mundane, and simple, and kind of freaky that way." [...] also added that the character is [...] "probably a coagulation of various folks". The role of Wilford was the last to be cast, and it was friend and fellow filmmaker Park Chan-Wook who suggested Harris for the role. Bong stated that Wilford needed to be played by someone with [...] "tremendous presence and performance from the first moment that he appeared in order to convince the audience", adding that [...] " [...] turned Wilford into a lively and ironic character with added appeal." [...] On taking the role of Wilford, Harris mentioned, [...] "When I was sent this script, I was told director Bong is a Korean director, and that he'd made some other films, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> seen any of them [...] I thought they were wonderfully accomplished films, which really made me want to work with the guy. I'm a big fan of his." [...] Harris was very praiseworthy of Bong, especially his tendency of editing the piece whilst shooting. Since the film's release, Bong has revealed background information about the character, such as Wilford being bisexual, [...] "He slept with Claude, the Egg-Head, Mason, and the pregnant teacher. Yet, his the One is the Engine." [...] Tyler John Williams portrays a young Wilford.|$|E

60|$|The {{moment was}} over and passed. Mr. Parker, with a {{movement}} forward, had covered my proceedings. I had been {{face to face with}} death years before, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> felt quite the same thrill.|$|E

6000|$|... "It is {{well that}} it went no farther. Small {{matter for the}} bonnet maker; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> forgiven you had the armourer fallen--there is not his match in Britain. But I hope they hanged the villain high enough?" ...|$|E
60|$|For {{the first}} time in my life, I had a glimmering idea that I distrusted Sebastian. Hilda Wade was right--the man was cruel. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> {{observed}} his cruelty before--because his devotion to science had blinded me to it.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{had never}} before seen {{the sense of being}} oppressed, {{bursting}} forth like a fire. I had supposed that it must be latent in the people somewhere; <b>but,</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> seen it break out, until I saw it in the dying boy.|$|E
60|$|He {{mentioned}} the catastrophes, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> heard of them; and Trafalgar {{was certainly not}} included.

60|$|Then {{of course}} I {{asked what he}} had to get over.

My sister, whose mistrust of me had quite given way, told me all she knew.|$|E
60|$|I {{felt that}} the {{struggle}} for life and death in any living thing was a horrible spectacle. With great interest I had studied natural selection, the variability of animals under different conditions of struggling existence, the law whereby one animal struck down and devoured another. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> seen and heard that law enacted on such a scale; and suddenly I abhorred it.|$|E
