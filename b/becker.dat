5|$|The owner at {{the time}} of the building's {{nomination}} to the National Register of Historic Places, Phil <b>Becker,</b> grew up living on Mazon Street (Illinois Route 17). He had been hanging out at the station since he was nine and began working at the station in 1964. One year after Becker's employment began, Ambler sold the station to Earl Kochler. Kochler sold the station to Royce McBeath, who ran it between 19651970. The station changed hands once again when <b>Becker</b> bought the station from McBeath on March 4, 1970. About a year after <b>Becker</b> took over operation of the station, Texaco suddenly stopped supplying the location with gasoline and <b>Becker</b> contracted with Marathon Oil. The brand change was accompanied by a name change to Becker's Marathon Gas Station, a name the station would be known by for over 26years. <b>Becker</b> operated the station, along with his wife Debbie, from the time of purchase until 1996. After closing the station, the couple leased the building out as an auto repair shop and eventually donated the building to the village of Dwight.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In Gary <b>Becker’s</b> (1991) {{theory of}} {{bandwagon}} effects, {{a portion of}} market demand is positively sloped. In this, he ignores Harvey Leibenstein’s (1950) hypothesis that market demands for bandwagon goods are everywhere negatively sloped (stemming from scarcity imposed constraints). A substantial literature now invokes <b>Becker’s</b> bandwagon, also ignoring Leibenstein. Two anomalies attend <b>Becker’s</b> bandwagon demand when it slopes upward: 1) straightforward parameterizations are inconsistent with the economic requirement that quantities demanded be non-negative; 2) regardless of parameterization, the comparative statics of <b>Becker’s</b> demand carry unworldly implications...|$|R

5|$|A {{cluster is}} a group of loosely coupled {{computers}} that work together closely, so that in some respects they can be regarded as a single computer. Clusters are composed of multiple standalone machines connected by a network. While machines in a cluster {{do not have to be}} symmetric, load balancing is more difficult if they are not. The most common type of cluster is the Beowulf cluster, which is a cluster implemented on multiple identical commercial off-the-shelf computers connected with a TCP/IP Ethernet local area network. Beowulf technology was originally developed by Thomas Sterling and Donald <b>Becker.</b> The vast majority of the TOP500 supercomputers are clusters.|$|E
5|$|A {{graduate}} of the Technical University of Berlin, Wigner worked {{as an assistant to}} Karl Weissenberg and Richard <b>Becker</b> at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Berlin, and David Hilbert at the University of Göttingen. Wigner and Hermann Weyl were responsible for introducing group theory into physics, particularly the theory of symmetry in physics. Along the way he performed ground-breaking work in pure mathematics, in which he authored a number of mathematical theorems. In particular, Wigner's theorem is a cornerstone in the mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics. He is also known for his research into the structure of the atomic nucleus. In 1930, Princeton University recruited Wigner, along with John von Neumann, and he moved to the United States.|$|E
5|$|Among {{professional}} economists {{the revival}} of Keynesian economics has been even more divisive. Although many economists, such as George Akerlof, Paul Krugman, Robert Shiller, and Joseph Stiglitz, supported Keynesian stimulus, others did not believe higher government spending would help the United States economy recover from the Great Recession. Some economists, such as Robert Lucas, questioned the theoretical basis for stimulus packages. Others, like Robert Barro and Gary <b>Becker,</b> say that empirical evidence for beneficial effects from Keynesian stimulus does not exist. However, {{there is a growing}} academic literature that shows that fiscal expansion helps an economy grow in the near term, and that certain types of fiscal stimulus are particularly effective.|$|E
