50|$|In 1990 Andreotti was {{involved}} in getting all parties {{to agree to a}} <b>binding</b> <b>timetable</b> for the Maastricht Treaty. The deep Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union favoured by Italy was opposed by Britain's Margaret Thatcher, who wanted a system of competition between currencies. Germany had doubts about committing to the project without requiring economic reforms from Italy, which was seen as having various imbalances. As President of the European Council, Andreotti co-opted Germany by making admittance to the single market automatic once the criteria had been met, and committing to a rigorous overhaul of Italian public finances. Critics later questioned Andreotti's understanding of the obligation, or whether he had ever intended to fulfill it.|$|E
40|$|FROM THE INTERNAL MARRET TO ECONOMIC AND MONETARY UNION. FUNCTIONAL SPILLOVER AND THE POLITICALLY FEASIBLE This {{thesis is}} a case study {{examining}} European monetary integration from the initiative (1988) through negotiations of an EMU-Treaty (1991). The analysis is devided in two parts: The first part explains why EMU {{was put on the}} agenda and how EMU was brought to the negotiation-table. We find Lindberg/Scheingold's model of system change ("Europe's Would-Be Polity", 1970) relevant, and put emphasis on functional spillover and leadership as important explanatory factors. The second part explains how a politically feasible solution could be achieved in the negotiations. We limit the analysis to four "pivotal" actors (France, Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom). Given the rule of decision-making, the interests and relative power of these four actors, we examine the possibilities for obtaining an integrative solution in the negotiations. The interests and feasible solutions are measured in terms of degree of decision-making power in the EC-system. Our data (actor-interests) have been systematically collected from 1989 - 91. The main sources have been official documents as well as statements and comments in Agence Europe, the Economist and other journals. We found that the internal market with the establishment of a common capitalmarket gave the functional argument for EMU. However, compatible perceptions of interest in the French and German leadership was critical for the follow-up of EMU. Once preparatory work and negotiations got started, it was clear that Germany was "pivotal" for obtaining any substancial solution on EMU. The preferance for a common solution within the EC-system gave furthermore the four actors the necessary formal power to press through their specific interests as to a <b>binding</b> <b>timetable</b> (France), "opt-out" from parts of the common solution (United Kingdom), commitments to side-payments in the next budget-reform (Spain) and institutional reform in a federal direction in the EC-system (Germany). With a reservation {{on the part of the}} United Kingdom, France, Germany and Spain where able to find an integrative solution in the negotiations. This solution will, in terms of decision-making power, lead to a substancial increase in the common decisionmaking power of the EC-system with a federal monetary system and an economic system with binding decision-making although with national implementation of the common policy...|$|E

40|$|The United States {{is home to}} the world’s largest economy. It is {{also the}} second largest {{national}} emitter of greenhouse gases (GHGs), contributing nearly 20 percent of yearly global emissions (US EPA, 2013). In per capita terms, US GHG emissions rank amongst the highest of the developed countries (Garnaut, 2008 : 55). It has long been clear that effective international governance for reducing GHG emissions will necessarily require significant US participation. The US has been a leader in researching the science of climate change through sponsoring research within its high quality university and government research institutions and making contributions to the United Nations scientific body in climate science, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). However, wider US engagement with the international climate change institutions has been significantly less positive. During the early 1990 s the first Bush Administration was active in negotiations to form the first overarching international agreement on climate change, the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). During these negotiations the US successfully opposed initiatives such as the inclusion of a system of internationally negotiated, legally <b>binding</b> targets and <b>timetables</b> for countries to reduce their GHG emissions. Instead, the US advocated that each country pursue their own domestic goals, strategies and/or programs for reducing emissions (Bodansky, 2001 : 29). Despite some support for <b>binding</b> targets and <b>timetables</b> during negotiations for the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, the US position on targets and timetables has largely been one of ongoing resistance...|$|R
500|$|In 1990, Senator Gore {{presided over}} a three-day conference with legislators from over 42 {{countries}} which sought to create a Global Marshall Plan, [...] "under which industrial nations would help less developed countries grow economically while still protecting the environment." [...] In the late 1990s, Gore strongly pushed for {{the passage of the}} Kyoto Protocol, which called for reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. He was opposed by the Senate, which passed unanimously (95–0) the Byrd–Hagel Resolution (S. Res. 98), which stated the sense of the Senate was that the United States should not be a signatory to any protocol that did not include <b>binding</b> targets and <b>timetables</b> for developing as well as industrialized nations or [...] "would result in serious harm to the economy of the United States".|$|R
5000|$|Many {{governments have}} criticized {{the failure of the}} United States to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, which was signed but not {{submitted}} for ratification by the previous administration. Former President Bill Clinton recommended that his successor not submit the treaty for ratification until the wording was altered to reflect U.S. concerns. Bush, who was opposed to the treaty, rescinded U.S. executive approval from the proposed treaty. In 1997, prior to the Kyoto negotiations, the Byrd-Hagel Resolution passed in the U.S. Senate by a 95-0 vote. The resolution stated that the United States should not be a signatory to any protocol that did not include <b>binding</b> targets and <b>timetables</b> for developing nations as well as industrialized ones, or that [...] "would result in serious harm to the economy of the United States".|$|R
5000|$|On 25 July 1997, {{before the}} Kyoto Protocol was {{finalized}} (although {{it had been}} fully negotiated, and a penultimate draft was finished), the US Senate unanimously passed by a 95-0 vote the Byrd-Hagel Resolution (S.

On 12 November 1998, Vice President Al Gore symbolically signed the protocol. Both Gore and Senator Joseph Lieberman indicated that the protocol would not be acted upon in the Senate until there was participation by the developing nations. The Clinton Administration never submitted the protocol to the Senate for ratification.|$|R
40|$|The {{difficulties}} in negotiating a post- 2012 regime of <b>binding</b> targets and <b>timetables</b> and {{the decisions of}} the US, Canada, and Russia on the Kyoto Protocol regime have led to pessimism {{about the future of the}} climate regime. Negotiation issues for different coalitions and actors are placed in a wider historical context by examining the key challenge facing the evolving long-term climate change negotiation process: the principled basis for the allocation of resources, responsibilities, rights, and risks between actors. Four theoretical approaches (problem structuring; negotiation theory; collective action and social practice models; legal theory) are applied to the climate regime. A principled approach is only a distributive approach from a narrow short-term perspective. It becomes an integrative approach from a longer-term perspective when it increases the pie, enhances the win-win opportunities and creates space for sustainable solutions to emerge. It is especially integrative when undertaken within the context of global rule of law, which is able to create predictable rules that apply to future global problems with different country interests. Will this happen? Climate justice movements and climate litigation have begun; statesmanship is still needed. © 2012 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC...|$|R
2500|$|As Vice-President, Gore was {{involved}} in a number of initiatives related to the environment. He launched the GLOBE program on Earth Day 1994, an education and science activity that, according to Forbes magazine, [...] "made extensive use of the Internet to increase student awareness of their environment". In the late 1990s, Gore strongly pushed for the passage of the Kyoto Protocol, which called for reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. He was opposed by the Senate, which passed unanimously (95–0) the Byrd–Hagel Resolution (S.

In 1998, Gore began promoting a NASA satellite that would provide a constant view of Earth, marking the first time such an image would have been made since The Blue Marble photo from the 1972 Apollo 17 mission. The [...] "Triana" [...] satellite would have been permanently mounted in the L1 Lagrangian Point, 1.5 million km away. During this time, he also became associated with Digital Earth.|$|R
