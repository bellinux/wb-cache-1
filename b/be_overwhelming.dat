After a bomb placed by neo-Nazis exploded outside {{his house in}} Vienna on 11 June 1982, police guards were stationed outside his home 24 hours a day. Cyla found the stressful nature of her husband's career and the dragged-out legal matters regarding Kreisky to <b>be</b> <b>overwhelming,</b> and she sometimes suffered from depression.|$|E
5|$|During the game's development, Harmonix {{only used}} low-fidelity {{versions}} of the remasters, which were sufficient for programming and note charting; Apple Corps feared that the leak of any high-fidelity remastered track from Abbey Road studios {{would lead to the}} unauthorized use of samples of the Beatles' music in remixes. High-fidelity {{versions of the}} songs were not implemented until the final publishing of the game. Harmonix performed very little additional remixing upon receipt of these remasters; in some cases, three different guitar parts—lead, solo, and rhythm—were brought into a single cohesive guitar part, slightly raising the volume of the specific guitar track that was used in note tracking {{to make it easier for}} the player to follow in the game. The ability for up to three players to sing vocal harmonies, a feature not present in previous Rock Band games, was designed and implemented as an optional feature so as not to <b>be</b> <b>overwhelming</b> to players.|$|E
5|$|Grand Theft Auto clones allow {{players to}} freely explore the game world, which is {{typically}} {{on the scale}} of an entire city. Some games base their level design on real world cities, such as London, New York City, and Los Angeles. Players are usually able to navigate by vehicle or on foot. Some games put greater emphasis on leaping, climbing, and even swimming. Exploring the world is not just necessary to complete objectives, but also to gain valuable items, weapons, and vehicles. Different parts of the game world may be controlled by different enemy factions, who will attempt to stop the player in a variety of ways. However, more recent games in this genre allow players to acquire their own territory. The freedom of navigating a huge game world may <b>be</b> <b>overwhelming</b> or confusing for new players. Game designers {{have come up with a}} variety of navigational aids to solve this problem. A mini-map feature is common, while Saints Row and Grand Theft Auto IV go so far as to offer a GPS service. Games without these navigation tools are sometimes criticized as confusing.|$|E

500|$|Susan is {{primarily}} characterized {{as the girl}} next door. Teri Hatcher stated [...] "I’m not exactly her, but I get her. I get her insecurities, her flaws." [...] She called the character [...] "a great representation of what [...] deals with daily. Our responsibilities can <b>be</b> <b>overwhelming</b> and things often don't go as you planned, {{so you have to}} roll with it. Susan celebrates rolling with it". She is a hopeless romantic and often expresses her more openly and vulnerably than the other characters in the series. The series begins a year after Susan's first divorce, when she is still emotionally raw. Throughout the series, several other characters have confronted Susan about her inability to live happily and without drama. Susan has a close relationship with her daughter, Julie (Andrea Bowen), who often acts as the parent figure in the relationship.|$|E

500|$|The battle {{system of}} Battle Network was a {{positive}} stand-out aspect for many critics. In his Battle Network series decade retrospective, 1UP.com's Jeremy Parish felt the first game suffered from terrible plotting, unbalanced play design, and unattractive and annoying environment navigation. Still, Parish perceived the game's combat mechanics to be its sole reason for success, marrying the original Mega Man action qualities with an RPG structure and requiring [...] "a combination of sharp thinking and quick reflexes" [...] on the player's part. Speer found battle within the game to rightfully capture the spirit of Mega Man as its [...] "most original and compelling feature". Harris likewise regarded the battle interface to be well-designed, a refreshing change from traditional Japanese RPGs, what gives the game its charm, and a very appreciative addition to the game's limited multiplayer mode. Fudge summarized the combat as [...] "very easy to learn, but difficult to master -- and yet very satisfying". He admitted that the random encounters can occasionally <b>be</b> <b>overwhelming.</b> Brogger considered the gameplay both deep and simple to pick up on, but thought the menu system to be [...] "clunky" [...] at times and its battles to be repetitive.|$|E
500|$|The game's {{gameplay}} {{was positively}} reviewed, with Buchholtz describing {{it as one}} of the game's standout points It was described it as [...] "fun", [...] "excellent" [...] "exhilarating", [...] "enjoyable" [...] and [...] "quick", though Ogilvie, Paras and Dean Takahashi from VentureBeat considered it too easy for players and become repetitive. Takahashi noted that the variety of time manipulation powers offered to players could <b>be</b> <b>overwhelming,</b> but as they progress, the experienced offered is satisfying. Loveridge further added that these powers were addictive. Tom Orry from VideoGamer.com applauded these powers for being [...] "cool" [...] to use, and Ben Reeves from Game Informer praised them for adding variety to the game. As powers can be combined to form a chain of attacks, the game was praised for giving players freedom to explore and experiment with them. Houghton complained that as most powers were available early on in the game, the development team missed the opportunity to fully [...] "evolve" [...] them. The cover system received negative opinions from critics, who complained that they sometimes got stuck in the cover during combat. Brown and Stephen Totilo from Kotaku thought that the gunplay system was not as refined as the powers, and that the weapons featured were [...] "generic". Many critics lamented that the final boss character is too hard to defeat, leading to players' frustration. The platforming section received mixed reviews. Orry and Arthur Gies from Polygon praised them for being [...] "cool" [...] to use and diluting the game's action, while Brown and Jeff Gerstmann from Giant Bomb described them as clumsy and ill-conceived due to the game's loose movement system.|$|E

500|$|In {{some of the}} raw moments {{captured}} in the documentary, Beyoncé appears completely bare. During one video, Beyoncé cries and asks herself: [...] "Why did God give me this life? Sometimes it's overwhelming. Why did God give me my talent, my gift, my family. But I know you're not supposed to question God." [...] She told Entertainment Tonight: [...] "I {{wanted to do something}} a little different with the film ... I wanted people to re-experience the show in a different way. Everyone that had been to the show -- I wanted them to see things that they didn't get to see. I figured it would be cool for everyone to see it from my point of view. It's a peek behind the curtain ... honestly, more than no makeup, the emotions and just being so real and raw, I don't think I'd be able to let down my guard the way I did if anybody was in the room." [...] The last minutes of the film get very sentimental, with a performance of Etta James's classic [...] "At Last" [...] set to the backdrop of Civil Rights-era footage, followed by a close-up moment when Beyoncé admits that her life can <b>be</b> <b>overwhelming,</b> although she is blessed, stating, [...] "I'm grateful... I'm alive and I'm living my dreams." [...] The film's final performance shows Beyoncé performing [...] "Halo" [...] and sees her paying tribute to Michael Jackson. She also splices in footage of an old video from the night she attended her first Michael Jackson concert as a child. At the end of the performance, the whole production wraps as Beyoncé throws up the Roc sign and exits the stage.|$|E

Common infected will often chase down the source of these noises while ignoring lower-pitched, but much louder sounds such as gunfire.

2500|$|Liu Xiu {{would be}} {{instrumental}} in the key victory that sealed Wang Mang's fate. [...] Wang, aware that Emperor Gengshi was becoming a major threat, sent his cousin Wang Yi (王邑) and his prime minister Wang Xun (王尋) with what he considered to <b>be</b> <b>overwhelming</b> force, some 430,000 men, intending to crush the newly constituted Han regime. The Han forces were {{at this point in}} two groups—one led by Wang Feng (王鳳), Wang Chang (王常), and Liu Xiu, which, in response to the arrival of the Xin forces, withdrew to the small town of Kunyang (昆陽, in modern Ye County, Henan) and one led by Liu Yan, which was still sieging Wancheng. The rebels in Kunyang initially wanted to scatter, but Liu Xiu opposed it; rather, he advocated that they guard Kunyang securely, while he would gather all other available troops in surrounding areas and attack the Xin forces from the outside. After initially rejecting Liu Xiu's idea, the Kunyang rebels eventually agreed.|$|E
2500|$|Amtrak {{soon had}} the {{opportunity}} to acquire rights-of-way. Following the bankruptcy of several northeastern railroads in the early 1970s, including Penn Central, which owned and operated the Northeast Corridor (NEC), Congress passed the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976. A large part of the legislation was directed to the creation of Conrail, but the law also enabled the transfer of the portions of the NEC not already owned by state authorities to Amtrak. Amtrak acquired the majority of the NEC on April 1, 1976. (The portion in Massachusetts is owned by the Commonwealth and managed by Amtrak. The route from New Haven to New Rochelle is owned by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and the Connecticut Department of Transportation as the New Haven Line.) This main line became Amtrak's [...] "jewel" [...] asset, and helped the railroad generate revenue. While the NEC ridership and revenues were higher than any other segment of the system, the cost of operating and maintaining the corridor proved to <b>be</b> <b>overwhelming.</b> As a result, Amtrak's federal subsidy was increased dramatically. In subsequent years, other short route segments not needed for freight operations were transferred to Amtrak.|$|E

2500|$|Bird {{received}} {{a scholarship to}} play college basketball for the Indiana University Hoosiers in 1974. After {{less than a month}} on campus he dropped out of school, finding the adjustment between his small hometown and the large student population of Bloomington to <b>be</b> <b>overwhelming.</b> He returned to French Lick, enrolling at Northwood Institute (now Northwood University) in nearby West Baden, and working municipal jobs for a year before enrolling at Indiana State University in Terre Haute in 1975. He had a successful three-year career with the Sycamores, helping them reach the NCAA tournament {{for the first time in}} school history and leading them to the 1979 championship game 33–0 against Michigan State. Indiana State would lose the game 75–64, with Bird scoring 19 points but making only 7 of 21 shots for 33.3 percent shooting rate. The game achieved the highest ever television rating for a college basketball game, in large part because of the match-up between Bird and Spartans' point guard Earvin [...] "Magic" [...] Johnson, a rivalry that lasted throughout their professional careers. Despite failing to win the championship, Bird earned numerous year-end awards and honors for his outstanding play, including the Naismith College Player of the Year Award. For his college career, he averaged 30.3 points, 13.3 rebounds, and 4.6 assists per game, leading the Sycamores to an 81–13 record during his tenure. Bird also appeared in one game for the baseball team, going 1-for-2 with 2 RBI.|$|E
2500|$|Jeremy Estes of PopMatters called Tatsumi's {{imagination}} [...] "dark and disturbing, {{but definitely}} worth the trip." [...] Esters added that Tatsumi's utilitarian art style and clean style of storytelling make the manga {{easy to follow}} visually, but its tone of despair can <b>be</b> <b>overwhelming.</b> Bill Randall of The Comics Journal described the manga's stories [...] "as subtle as pissing in someone's face", but acknowledged Tatsumi's place in manga history {{and the strength of}} his images. In a starred review, Publishers Weekly observed that Tatsumi tackles difficult subjects, but instead of exploiting, he humanizes his characters. It also called his art masterful in how he varies his style and depicts [...] "graceful motion, grisly suffering and complicated emotion." [...] Gordon Flagg of Booklist noted that the stories in the manga are more political than usual for Tatsumi in their portrayal of postwar Japan, saying of the manga: [...] "Tatsumi's mastery of the visual simplicity of classic manga gives a stark power to these devastating, uncompromising pieces." [...] Richard Rayner of the Los Angeles Times described the stories as [...] "remarkable, amazing" [...] saying that their style is [...] "spare, elliptical and it's sometimes necessary to read two or three times to appreciate the full nightmarish power." [...] Andrew Wheeler of ComicMix preferred the stories translated in Abandon the Old in Tokyo, but still found the stories [...] "Hell" [...] and the titular title to be comparable, calling the manga [...] "a stunning achievement, a collection of dark, realistic stories from a side of the world we rarely see." [...] Calling the manga bleak, Tom Baker of The Daily Yomiuri said that [...] "there's no point in reading such depressing stuff unless it is done very well. And Tatsumi does it excellently." ...|$|E
