The paper looks at {{the sensitivity of the}} results to the process of modelling <b>blocking-back</b> in NEMIS, for the same 6 x 6 grid network described by May and Shepherd (1994 b). First of all the <b>blocking-back</b> logic implemented in NEMIS is described. This logic was developed by Shepherd (1990) for use on an arterial network with the intention of blocking cross flows at signalised junctions. When implemented on grid networks with high demands and certain turning ratios this logic can lead to gridlock conditions. The logic implemented in NEMIS caused an irrecoverable gridlock condition i. e. once gridlock occurs it cannot be cleared. Although gridlock conditions may exist for short periods of time in the real world driver behaviour and or external factors combine to relieve the condition eventually. The results will be discussed with and without the <b>blocking-back</b> model implemented in NEMIS for matrix B - heavy inbound traffic. This work also revealed some problems with the tracking approach described by May and Shepherd (1994 a) and the definition of demand when extended from single link/zone networks to multi-zone networks. One of the main problems was that of overlapping in the space-time domain, the amount of overlap increasing as demand is increased...|$|E
40|$|This {{working paper}} {{is the first}} in a series {{relating}} to the EPSRC funded project, " The Definition of Capacity in Urban Road Networks : The role of Area Speed-Flow Relationships". It defines the measures collected and the methods for data collection in terms of space-time diagrams. The four measures are collected by simulating different levels of demand. Two cases are presented, the first simulates constant demand throughout each simulation period, the second simulates a demand profile which stays uniform as peak demand increases. The paper concentrates on single link models with only one OD pair and only one route. Two equivalent networks are presented. The first represents a single link where the capacity of the link is maintained. The second is a purely hypothetical network where the capacity is reduced to zero as demand increases. This is achieved by a loop configuration so that the departure rate is affected by the queue <b>blocking-back</b> on itself...|$|E
40|$|This Working Paper {{is one of}} {{a series}} {{representing}} work under an SERC grant on queue management strategies for urban traffic control systems whose objectives are:- (i) to generalise the strategies developed in an earlier study of queue management, (ii) to develop a computer graphics based representation of queue propagation and management; (iii) to test the strategies' applicability and performance in UK networks; (iv) to investigate their incorporation into standard signal optimisation programs. Clark (1991) in WP 343 describes the graphics model developed at ITS as a queue-management tool for traffic engineers. In order to calibrate the model, and later implement a suitable queue management strategy recommended by the model, a small oversaturated urban traffic network was required. Six possible sites in the West Yorkshire region were suggested by HETS (West Yorkshire Highway Engineering and Technical Services) for consideration. Wellington Street in Leeds city centre was identified as the most suitable being a linked series of three signalized junctions where <b>blocking-back</b> was commonplace, parking violations were minimal and an adequate filming position was available...|$|E
