5|$|The {{successful}} {{resistance of}} Dvin {{put an end}} to the Byzantine advance in Armenia, helping preserve the independence of the smaller Armenian realms of Syunik, Tashir and Khachen. Soon after, the regional balance of power was permanently altered with the first large-scale raid of the Seljuk Turks under Qutlumush ibn Arslan Isra'il and Ibrahim Inal into Byzantine Armenia in 1048. While the Shaddadids may have <b>been</b> <b>tempted</b> to see in them welcome allies against the Byzantines, they were equally likely to be a threat, as demonstrated by the attack on Ganja by Qutlumush in 1046/47.|$|E
5|$|In the Middle East, British {{counter-intelligence}} {{was directed}} at preserving the loyalty of the Indian sepoy {{in the face of}} Turkish propaganda and the concept of The Caliph's Jihad, while a particularly significant effort {{was directed at}} intercepting the Kabul Mission. The East Persian Cordon was established in July 1915 in the Sistan province of Persia to prevent the Germans from crossing into Afghanistan, and to protect British supply caravans in Sarhad from the Damani, Reki and Kurdish Baluchi tribal raiders who may have <b>been</b> <b>tempted</b> by German gold. Among the commanders of the Sistan force was Reginald Dyer who led it between March and October 1916.|$|E

25|$|Kitchener, believing Britain should husband her {{resources}} {{for a long}} war, decided at Cabinet (6 August) that the initial BEF would consist of only 4 infantry divisions (and 1 cavalry), not the 5 or 6 promised. His decision to hold back two of the six divisions of the BEF, although based on exaggerated concerns about German invasion of Britain, arguably saved the BEF from disaster as Sir John French (on the advice of Wilson who was much influenced by the French), might have <b>been</b> <b>tempted</b> to advance further into {{the teeth of the}} advancing German forces, had his own force been stronger.|$|E
25|$|A further {{aspect of}} this work to note is the {{appearance}} of Gregory himself in certain sections, notably {{in the life of}} St. Leobardus. This is for two reasons: Firstly, it creates a distinct link between the temporal and the spiritual worlds, firmly placing the accounts of the lives in a world which is understandable and recognisable, or, seen from the other angle, confirming the presence of miracles in the temporal world. Secondly, the intercession of Gregory serves to set Leobardus straight, after he had <b>been</b> <b>tempted</b> by the devil (Life of the Fathers, XX, 3), and so this act further enhances the authority of bishops as a whole.|$|E

25|$|Many {{philosophers}} {{throughout history}} had, arguably, <b>been</b> <b>tempted</b> to reduce {{two of these}} kinds of belief and knowledge to the other one: René Descartes and David Hume thought that the only knowledge that people start with is self-knowledge. Some logical positivists (and some would say Wittgenstein, or Wilfrid Sellars) held that people start with beliefs only about the external world. (Arguably, Friedrich Schelling and Emmanuel Levinas held that people start with beliefs only about other people.) It is not possible, on Davidson's view, for a person to have only one of the three kinds of mental content; anyone who has beliefs of one of the kinds must have beliefs of the other two kinds.|$|E
25|$|Sedgwick withdrew {{across the}} Rappahannock at Banks's Ford during the pre-dawn hours of May 5. When {{he learned that}} Sedgwick had retreated back over the river, Hooker felt {{he was out of}} options to save the campaign. He called a council of war and asked his corps commanders to vote about whether to stay and fight or to withdraw. Although a {{majority}} voted to fight, Hooker had had enough, and on the night of May 5–6, he withdrew back across the river at U.S. Ford. It was a difficult operation. Hooker and the artillery crossed first, followed by the infantry beginning at 6 a.m. on May 6. Meade's V Corps served as the rear guard. Rains caused the river to rise and threatened to break the pontoon bridges. Couch was in command on the south bank after Hooker departed, but he was left with explicit orders not to continue the battle, which he had <b>been</b> <b>tempted</b> to do. The surprise withdrawal frustrated Lee's plan for one final attack against Chancellorsville. He had issued orders for his artillery to bombard the Union line in preparation for another assault, but {{by the time they were}} ready Hooker and his men were gone.|$|E

500|$|Commentators have <b>been</b> <b>tempted</b> {{to compare}} Bogdan-Pitești with some {{controversial}} characters in world history, most often {{the prototype of}} self-seekers, Alcibiades. Others likened Bogdan-Pitești to the Renaissance writer and notorious blackmailer Pietro Aretino (Zambaccian stresses that, unlike Aretino, Bogdan-Pitești never duped his artists). Comarnescu proposed that Bogdan-Pitești and the equally controversial Arghezi were better understood through the logic of Hinduism ("the ancient Indian ethics"): [...] "good and evil are not opposed, but collocated, combined, {{in a state of}} confusion". Taking in view Alexandru Bogdan-Pitești's preference for orality, his shady political connections, and his mostly informal channels of influence, Cernat concluded that, [...] "the necessary changes having been made", one could compare Bogdan-Pitești with Nae Ionescu, a philosopher and far right activist whose career spanned the interwar period, and who had also debuted as a Symbolist.|$|E

500|$|Several modern {{scholars}} have <b>been</b> <b>tempted</b> to make identification between the Pharnavaz {{of the medieval}} Georgian tradition and the Pharasmanes of the Greco-Roman historian Arrian, a 2nd-century AD author of The Anabasis of Alexander. Arrian recounts that [...] "Pharasmanes (Фαρασμάνης), king of the Chorasmians", visited Alexander the Great with 1500 horseman, and pledged his support should Alexander desire to campaign to the Euxine lands and subdue Colchians, whom Pharasmanes names as his neighbors. Apart from the similarity {{of the names of}} Pharasmanes and Pharnavaz (both names are apparently based on the same root, the Iranian farnah), {{it is interesting to note}} that the king of Chorasmia in Central Asia reports Colchis (today’s western Georgia, i.e., the western neighbor of ancient Kartli/Iberia) to be a neighboring country. Some Georgian {{scholars have}} suggested that the Greek copyists of [...] Arrian might have confused Chorasmia with Cholarzene (Chorzene), a Classical rendering of the southwest Georgian marchlands (the medieval Tao-Klarjeti), which indeed bordered with Colchis and Pontus.|$|E

500|$|Since {{the dawn}} of Newtonian science with its vision of simple {{mechanical}} principles governing the entire universe, some philosophers have <b>been</b> <b>tempted</b> {{by the idea that}} consciousness could be explained in purely physical terms. The first influential writer to propose such an idea explicitly was Julien Offray de La Mettrie, in his book Man a Machine (L'homme machine). [...] His arguments, however, were very abstract. [...] The most influential modern physical theories of consciousness are based on psychology and neuroscience. Theories proposed by neuroscientists such as Gerald Edelman and Antonio Damasio, and by philosophers such as Daniel Dennett, seek to explain consciousness in terms of neural events occurring within the brain. Many other neuroscientists, such as Christof Koch, have explored the neural basis of consciousness without attempting to frame all-encompassing global theories. At the same time, computer scientists working in the field of artificial intelligence have pursued the goal of creating digital computer programs that can simulate or embody consciousness.|$|E
500|$|While professing that Anarky was the {{character}} {{for whom he}} was proudest, and that {{the character}}'s narratives were among his best achievements {{for the amount of}} reaction they generated among readers, the character was also a source of some regret for Grant. Reflecting on his early secret plan to transform Lonnie Machin into a new Robin, Grant has stated that though he came to appreciate the character of Tim Drake, he occasionally experiences [...] "twinges of regret that Anarky wasn’t chosen as the new sidekick for comics' greatest hero." [...] Grant has also stated that he attempted to distance himself from the direction of Anarky following his termination from DC Comics, and actively tried to avoid learning about the fate of Anarky and other characters he had come to care about. He often found himself disappointed to see how some characters were used or, as he felt, were mismanaged. Grant later joked on his disillusion in the handling of Anarky, [...] "if you create something that's close to your heart and you don't own it, 'Oh woe is me!'" [...] In 2011, DC Comics initiated a special DC Retroactive series of comics, exploring different periods in the publication history of popular characters.
