40|$|Abstract: Static {{synchronous}} compensation (STATCOM) is {{an application}} that utilizes a voltage source converter (VSC) to provide instantaneous reactive power {{support to the}} connected power system. Conventionally, STATCOMs are employed for reactive power support only. However, with the integration of energy storage (ES) into a STATCOM, it can provide active power support {{in addition to the}} reactive power support. The control method of a STATCOM with an energy storage device is discussed in this paper. To determine the switching <b>level</b> <b>control,</b> SPWM (Sinusoidal <b>Pulse</b> Width Modulation) methods is used.

As the delay element degrades, the transistor switching time increases, increasing the time delay of the delay output.
