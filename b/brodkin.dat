2500|$|Many American Jews {{identify}} as white, a label which is somewhat contentious within the community, with many instead choosing to identify simply as Jewish. [...] Several commentators {{have observed that}} [...] "many American Jews retain an ambivalence about whiteness". Karen <b>Brodkin</b> explains this ambivalence as rooted in anxieties about the potential loss of Jewish identity, especially outside of intellectual elites. Similarly, Kenneth Marcus observes a number of ambivalent cultural phenomena noted by other scholars, and concludes that [...] "the veneer of whiteness has not established conclusively the racial construction of American Jews". The relationship between American Jews and white majority identity continues to be described as [...] "complicated".|$|E
