5|$|In 1860 Berkeley and Curtis {{described}} the species Agaricus cyanophos from material also {{collected from the}} Bonin Islands. This material was found near the location that the original specimens of M.chlorophos were found, <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of weeks later. Japanese mycologists Seiya Ito and Sanshi Imai studied these collections in the late 1930s, and concluded that Agaricus cyanophos was the same species as M.chlorophos, despite differences in cap shape, gill attachment, {{and the color of}} emitted light. Desjardin and colleagues agreed with this determination after examining the type material of both taxa. M.chlorophos is classified in the section Exornatae of the genus Mycena. Other luminescent species in this section are M.discobasis and M.marginata. Some authors have considered M.illuminans to be synonymous with M.chlorophos due to their morphological similarity, but molecular analysis has shown that they are distinct species.|$|E

25|$|Initially, {{after the}} Second World War, BSA {{motorcycles}} were not generally seen as racing machines, {{compared to the}} likes of Norton. In the immediate post-war period few were entered in races such as the TT races, though this changed dramatically in the Junior Clubman event (smaller engine motorcycles racing over some 3 or 4 laps around one of the Isle of Man courses). In 1947 there were <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of BSA mounted riders, but by 1952 BSA were in the majority and in 1956 the makeup was 53 BSA, 1 Norton and 1 Velocette.|$|E

25|$|Many gay {{artists and}} intellectuals like Reinaldo Arenas were {{attracted}} to the socialist promise of an egalitarian society, which would {{pave the way for}} cultural and sexual freedom and social justice. Gay writers largely wrote the popular journal Lunes de Revolución. Its radical ideas seemed to enjoy the favor of the Cuban government. <b>But</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of years after Castro's rise to power, this journal was closed down amidst a wave of media censorship. Its gay writers were publicly disgraced, refused publication, and dismissed from their jobs. Some were reassigned to work as janitors and labourers.|$|E
25|$|The West Saxon aristocrat, monk, scholar, {{and poet}} Aldhelm (c. 639–709) composed, {{among many other}} works, a set of one hundred hexametrical 'enigmata' or 'enigmas', {{inspired}} by the so-called Riddles of Symphosius. The thirty-third was Lorica ('corselet'). This was translated into Old English, and first witnessed in the Northumbrian dialect of Old English as the Leiden Riddle; the language is of the seventh or eighth century. Unusually, the riddle is also attested, in West Saxon, among the Old English riddles of the later tenth-century Exeter Book, where it is number 33 or 35 (depending on the edition consulted). Apart from differences in language caused by dialect and date, and damage to the Leiden manuscript, the texts are the identical on all <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of points.|$|E
25|$|Statements were {{collected}} from all the crew. These were all written out for presentation to the inquiry on standard forms in identical handwriting with similar phrasing. Quartermaster Johnston later described that pressure had been placed upon him to be loyal to the company, {{and that it had}} been suggested to him it would help the case if two torpedoes had struck the ship, rather than the one which he described. Giving evidence to the tribunal he was not asked about torpedoes. Other witnesses who claimed that only one torpedo had been involved were refused permission to testify. In contrast to his statement at the inquest, Captain Turner stated that two torpedoes had struck the ship, not one. In an interview in 1933, Turner reverted to his original statement that there had been only one torpedo. Most witnesses said there had been two, <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> said three, possibly involving a second submarine. Clem Edwards, representing the seamen's union, attempted to introduce evidence about which watertight compartments had been involved but was prevented from doing so by Lord Mersey.|$|E

25|$|England's total {{could have}} been {{significantly}} higher with a bit more top-order application, especially given the high scoring rate. However, England's bowlers started well when Steve Harmison bowled a maiden over first up to Justin Langer, and Matthew Hayden holed out to Harmison's new-ball partner Matthew Hoggard for a golden duck – the first of Hayden's Test career. Then, Ricky Ponting and Justin Langer hit runs just as quickly as England had done, before the umpire's finger went up twice more before lunch; Ricky Ponting swept a shot off Ashley Giles to the opposing captain Vaughan for 61, and Damien Martyn was run out taking a single for 20. Langer and Michael Clarke continued after lunch in the same vein, hitting 76 runs {{in an hour and}} a half, <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of wickets within five overs took Australia to 208 for 5, needing 199 for the last five wickets for parity. The partnership between Langer and Gilchrist saw them to tea with no further loss, as Langer continued his four-hour unbeaten knock and went into the tea break on 72.|$|E
500|$|Gavin Flood {{states that}} it is not clear from the seal that the figure has three faces, is seated in a yoga posture, or even that the shape is {{intended}} to represent a human figure. He characterizes these views as [...] "speculative", but adds that it is nevertheless possible that there are echoes of Shaiva iconographic themes, such as half-moon shapes resembling the horns of a bull. John Keay writes that [...] "he may indeed be an early manifestation of Lord Shiva as Pashu-pati", <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of his specialties of this figure does not match with Rudra. Writing in 1997, Srinivasan interprets what John Marshall interpreted as facial as not human but more bovine, possibly a divine buffalo-man.|$|E
500|$|As {{initially}} constructed, {{the interior}} was relatively open with two-rail handrails, <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of suicides and an accidental fall prompted the addition of tall wire screening ( [...] high with a large diamond mesh) on the inside edge {{of the stairs and}} landings in 1929. The original steam powered elevator, which took 10 to 12 minutes to ascend to the observation floor, was replaced by an electric elevator powered by an on-site dynamo in 1901 which took five minutes to ascend. The monument was connected to the electrical grid in 1923, allowing the installation of a modern electric elevator in 1925–26 which took 70 seconds. The latter was replaced in 1958 and again in 1998 by 70-second elevators. During 1997–2000, the wire screening at three platforms was replaced by large glass panels to allow visitors on the elevator to view three clusters of memorial stones that were synchronously lit as the elevator automatically slowed as it passed them during its descent.|$|E

500|$|Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian {{commented that}} the lead vocals of the songs {{were likely to be}} sung by each member equally, noting that it made the album a [...] "democratic" [...] one; however she criticized them for {{squandering}} [...] "the extent of their talents" [...] on the album. Tom Sinclair of Entertainment Weekly also noticed its [...] "overall air of democracy at work" [...] and noted that Destiny Fulfilled [...] "often moves at a molasses-like pace, weighted down with a preponderance of exquisitely executed but ultimately dull ballads". Jenny Eliscu of Rolling Stone magazine echoed his comments, saying, [...] "In all <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of songs, the verses are divided into three sections, with Beyonce leading things off, followed by Rowland, then Williams". She noted that after a couple of upbeat songs, [...] "the album slumps into an endless string of overwrought R ballads where the only saving grace is... these ladies can harmonize like nobody's business." [...] Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine has {{commented that the}} ballads of the album build into [...] "the same sort of standoffish sexual supply-and-demand bartering that has marred their worst tracks". Most of the critics questioned why Beyoncé had to return to Destiny's Child after achieving the most success among the members of the group. Henderson lambasted Beyoncé to performing again with the group with the [...] "full intention" [...] of taking advantage to bolster her [...] "divette" [...] status to superstardom. In May 2006, Destiny Fulfilled was listed at number 24 on a list titled [...] "The 50 Worst Albums Ever!" [...] compiled by Q magazine.|$|E

2500|$|Other former {{students}} {{took a different}} view, some citing experiences of anti-Semitism.

Before 1960, Toronto was a pretty narrow, close-minded, little Victorian town and Upper Canada College reflected that reality." [...] At the same time, Peter C. Newman, who came to UCC from Czechoslovakia in 1940, and who is Jewish himself, said that anti-Semitism was [...] "virtually non-existent" [...] at the school.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the right}} of the Ras en Naqb position, the 2nd Light Horse Brigade {{continued}} fighting towards Edh Dhahriye on the main road north from Beersheba to Hebron and Jerusalem. The brigade was deployed on a front of several miles, sending patrols round the Ottoman flank to within [...] of the road, [...] north of Edh Dhahriye, from where they could see the busy motor traffic heading towards Hebron and Jerusalem. However, a general advance, which began at 10:15, was unable to make any gains because the brigade was too thinly stretched over a wide area. This attack was not pressed, <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of days' supply of water was found.|$|E
2500|$|In 1995 and 1996 the Evangelical Church of Papua {{ministering to}} the Gogodala {{people in the}} Middle Fly District {{observed}} that Bahá'ís and other small churches were [...] "peripheral and largely ineffectual" [...] <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> years later [...] "had become more obvious." [...] An ex-pastor suggested to Christian researchers that he had joined the Bahá'í Faith because they respected music and dance as spiritual. `In Bahá'í Faith dancing is not bad. Dancing was put on earth by God; it is for rejoicing {{and it is a}} time of happiness when it comes to dancing time'.

2500|$|Her {{enthusiasm for}} Nikolai Gogol's work became {{reflected}} in both her husband's compositions {{and those of}} his friends. On the day of their betrothal, she and Rimsky-Korsakov read Gogol's short story [...] "May Night" [...] together. Afterwards, {{she told him that}} he should write an opera based on it. A week or two later she wrote him, I've been reading yet another of Gogol's stories today, [...] "The Fair at Sorochyntsi." [...] This is good, too, and would even be suitable for an opera, but not for you; in any case, it's not like 'May Night.' As for that, it's so stuck in my head that nothing will drive it out. Either she or her sister Alexandra then suggested [...] "The Fair at Sorochyntsi" [...] to Mussorgsky.
