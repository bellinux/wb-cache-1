Hans Eysenck responded to Gould by stating that no psychologist had said that intelligence was an area located in the brain. Eysenck also argued IQ tests were not racist, pointing out that Northeast Asians and Jews both scored higher than non-Jewish Europeans on IQ tests, and this would not please European racists.|$|E
25|$|<b>Black-White</b> {{segregation}} {{is consistently}} declining for most metropolitan areas and cities, {{though there are}} geographical differences. In 2000, for instance, the US Census Bureau found that residential segregation has on average declined since 1980 in the West and South, but less so in the Northeast and Midwest. Indeed, the top ten most segregated cities are in the Rust Belt, where total populations have declined {{in the last few}} decades. Despite these pervasive patterns, changes for individual areas are sometimes small. Thirty years after the civil rights era, the United States remains a residentially segregated society in which blacks and whites still often inhabit vastly different neighborhoods.|$|E

500|$|Critic Pierre A. Walker placed Angelou's autobiographies in the African-American {{literature}} {{tradition of}} political protest {{written in the}} years following the American Civil Rights Movement. He emphasized that the unity of Angelou's autobiographies underscored one of her central themes: the injustice of racism and how to fight it. [...] Angelou's biographies, beginning with Caged Bird, consisted of [...] "a sequence of lessons about resisting racist oppression". This sequence led Angelou, as the protagonist, from [...] "helpless rage and indignation to forms of subtle resistance, and finally to outright and active protest" [...] throughout all seven of her autobiographies. [...] Angelou changed her views in the course of her autobiographies about <b>Black-white</b> relationships and learned to accept different points of view. It was changes in how she regarded race, and her views of white people, that provided Angelou with freedom. According to Hagen, one of Angelou's themes was that humans tend to be more alike than different.|$|E
500|$|Beginning with Caged Bird {{and ending}} with her final autobiography, Angelou used the metaphor of a bird, which {{represented}} Angelou's confinement resulting from racism and depression, struggling to escape its cage, {{as described in the}} Paul Laurence Dunbar poem [...] "Sympathy". [...] Angelou's autobiographies can be placed in the African-American literature tradition of political protest. [...] Their unity underscored one of Angelou's central themes: the injustice of racism and how to fight it. [...] According to scholar Pierre A. Walker, all of Angelou's books described [...] "a sequence of lessons about resisting racist oppression". [...] In the course of her autobiographies, her views about <b>Black-white</b> relationships changed and she learned to accept different points of view. [...] Angelou's theme of identity was established from the beginning of her autobiographies, with the opening lines in Caged Bird, and like other female writers in the late 1960s and early 1970s, she used the autobiography to reimagine ways of writing about women's lives and identities in a male-dominated society. Her original goal was to write about the lives of Black women in America, but it evolved in her later volumes to document {{the ups and downs of}} her life.|$|E
500|$|Since {{its initial}} reception, the album has been praised by critics for Charles's style and manner of {{interpreting}} country music into his R musical language. Robert Hilburn of the Los Angeles Times {{wrote that the}} [...] "masterful interpretation of several country standards ... opened a lot of pop ears to country music and showed Nashville much about {{the proper use of}} orchestration." [...] Allmusic editor Stephen Cook called the album a [...] "fine store of inimitable interpretations", and stated, [...] "Less modern for its country-R blend and lushly produced C tone than for its place as a high-profile crossover hit, Modern Sounds in Country and Western fit right in with Ray Charles's expansive musical ways while on the Atlantic label in the '50s". Chris Neal of Country Weekly commented that Charles [...] "recast 12 country favorites in big-band and orchestrated settings with a visionary’s easy grace", adding that he [...] "gets to the heart of each [...] in a way that remains thoroughly modern." [...] John Morthland of the Oxford American called it a [...] "landmark LP of transcendent vocals set against kitschy orchestrations that (along with early rock 'n' roll) illuminated <b>black-white</b> roots connections for a popular audience." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{concept of}} Obsessed was thought up by Clint Culpepper, {{president}} of Screen Gems, and was shared with David Loughery, {{who wrote the}} screenplay.

Director Steve Shill signed on after reading the script and hearing that Beyoncé was on board. Part of the reason Elba joined in was that the <b>black–white</b> theme was ignored; [...] "It's {{not mentioned in the}} film, it's never an issue, and I think that's phenomenal ... To me, that was very refreshing that the studio execs didn't want to make an issue of it." [...] Obsessed was allocated a production budget of $20 million. Shill stated that the intended effect of the film was to have the audience discuss the characters' motivations. Writer David Loughery designed Lisa as [...] "not a villain in a traditional sense; she's not setting out to wreck a marriage or ruin somebody's life. She really believes that [...] is in love with her." [...] Lisa's past was deliberately omitted from the film, explaining, [...] "It's scarier if we never really know how she's developed this personality that can go from very loving to ultimately deadly." ...|$|E
500|$|UPN {{announced}} that Busy Philipps was cast as Denise on July 25, {{and was later}} billed as the show's star. According to Vince Vieluf, the casting change from Doherty to Philipps led to the series being retooled as an ensemble show featuring {{all the members of}} the agency rather than focusing on Denise. Vieluf said the alterations in the series' premise were due to concerns that [...] "people would get tired of a show that was only about the mishaps of one person's love life". Page Kennedy reported that he was considered for a part on the show, but rejected it for the role of Caleb Applewhite on the second season of the ABC drama Desperate Housewives. Retired Los Angeles Lakers player Rick Fox guest starred in three episodes as David, one of Clea's love interests. The casting of racially diverse actors was identified with UPN's position as [...] "the only network to actively program for an African American audience". Tim Good of the San Francisco Chronicle pointed to the show's casting as the only way in which it acts as a [...] "positive reference". Even though the show was set in New York City, filming took place in the Bluhdorn Building at Paramount Studios in Hollywood, and used the multiple-camera format. Aaron Korsh wrote the nineteenth episode as freelance work. Each episode title, with the exception of the pilot, was taken from the names of past sitcoms. Transitions between scenes feature images of New York City set to contemporary music, such as The Black Eyed Peas' single [...] "Don't Phunk with My Heart" [...] and Kelis' single [...] "Milkshake". Todd R. Ramlow of PopMatters described the music as a further attempt to appeal to [...] "an 'urban', <b>black-white</b> audience," [...] and praised it as a [...] "nice try at crossover for a network whose shows usually target a black demographic".|$|E

2500|$|Access to {{prenatal}} care, socioeconomic status, cultural influence, and postpartum breastfeeding {{support all}} influence the differing rates of breastfeeding in different ethnic groups.

2500|$|For decades {{many critics}} have accused {{designers}} of the verbal SAT of cultural bias {{as an explanation}} for the disparity in scores between poorer and wealthier test-takers. A famous (and long past) example of this bias in the SAT I was the oarsman–regatta analogy question. The object of the question was to find the pair of terms that had the relationship most similar to the relationship between [...] "runner" [...] and [...] "marathon". The correct answer was [...] "oarsman" [...] and [...] "regatta". The choice of the correct answer was thought to have presupposed students' familiarity with rowing, a sport popular with the wealthy.

In one early incident, gay activist Jack Baker brought suit against the state of Minnesota in 1970 after being denied a marriage license to marry another man; the Minnesota Supreme Court ruled (in Baker v. Nelson) that limiting marriage to opposite-sex couples did not violate the Constitution. Baker later changed his legal name to Pat Lynn McConnell and married his male partner in 1971, but the marriage was not legally recognized.

2500|$|The {{pattern of}} hypersegregation {{began in the}} early 20th century. African-Americans who moved to large cities often moved into the inner-city in order to gain {{industrial}} jobs. The influx of new African-American residents caused many European American residents to move to the suburbs in a case of white flight. As industry began {{to move out of the}} inner-city, the African-American residents lost the stable jobs that had brought them to the area. Many were unable to leave the inner-city, however, and they became increasingly poor. This created the inner-city ghettos that make up the core of hypersegregation. Though the Civil Rights Act of 1968 banned discrimination in sale of homes, the norms set before the laws continue to perpetuate this hypersegregation. Data from the 2000 census shows that 29 metropolitan areas displayed <b>black-white</b> hypersegregation; [...] in 2000. Two areas—Los Angeles and New York City—displayed Hispanic-white hypersegregation. No metropolitan area displayed hypersegregation for Asians or for Native Americans.|$|E
2500|$|Researchers {{believe that}} the {{difference}} in scores {{is closely related to}} the overall achievement gap in American society between students of different racial groups. This gap may be explainable in part by the fact that students of disadvantaged racial groups tend to go to schools that provide lower educational quality. This view is supported by evidence that the <b>black-white</b> gap is higher in cities and neighborhoods that are more racially segregated. It has also been suggested that stereotype threat has a significant effect on lowering achievement of minority students. For example, African Americans perform worse on a test when they are told that the test measures [...] "verbal reasoning ability", than when no mention of the test subject is made. [...] Other research cites poorer minority proficiency in key coursework relevant to the SAT (English and math), as well as peer pressure against students who try to focus on their schoolwork ("acting white"). Cultural issues are also evident among black students in wealthier households, with high achieving parents. [...] John Ogbu, a Nigerian-American professor of anthropology, found that instead of looking to their parents as role models, black youth chose other models like rappers and did not put forth the effort to be a good student. However, they felt that racism was wrong.|$|E
