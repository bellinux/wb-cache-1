By making individuals aware of the implicit biases affecting their behavior, they can take steps to control automatic negative associations that can lead to discriminatory behavior. A growing body of research has demonstrated that practice pairing minority racial out-groups with counter-stereotypic examples can reduce implicit forms of bias.

5000|$|Neural {{networks}} are different typesof simplified mathematical models of biological neural networks likethose in human brains. In feedforward neural networks (NNs) the information moves forward {{in only one}} direction, from the input layer that receives information from the environment, through the hidden layers to the output layer that supplies {{the information to the}} environment.Unlike NNs, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) can use their internal memory to process arbitrary sequences of inputs. If data mining is based on neural networks, overfitting reduces the network's capability to correctly process future data. To avoid overfitting, Sepp Hochreiterdeveloped algorithms for finding low complexity neural networks like [...] "Flat Minimum Search"(FMS), which searches for a [...] "flat" [...] minimum — a large connected region in the parameter space where thenetwork function is constant. Thus, the network parameters can be given with low precision whichmeans a low complex network that avoids overfitting. Low complexity neural {{networks are}} well suited for deep learning because they control the complexity in each network layer and, therefore, learn hierarchical representations of the input.Sepp Hochreiter's group introduced [...] "exponential linear units" [...] (ELUs) which speed up learning in deep neural networks and lead to higher classification accuracies. Like rectified linear units (ReLUs), leaky ReLUs (LReLUs), and parametrized ReLUs (PReLUs), ELUs alleviate the vanishing gradient problem via the identity for positive values. However, ELUs have improved learning characteristics compared to ReLUs, due to negative values which push mean unit activations closer to zero. Mean shifts toward zero speed up learning by bringing the normal gradient closer to the unit natural gradient because of a reduced <b>bias</b> <b>shift</b> effect.|$|E

The thermal activation effects {{lead to an}} O migration which results in virtually pure Co areas embedded in a structurally relaxed and nearly stoichiometric CoO phase. This yields decreased training and exchange bias shifts, while the blocking temperature significantly increases, coming close to the N'eel temperature of bulk CoO for samples implanted to a fluence above 1 x 1017 ions/cm² (15 % O). The dependence of the exchange <b>bias</b> <b>shift</b> on the pristine O-implanted content is analogous {{to that of the}} antiferromagnetic thickness in most ferromagnetic/antiferromagnetic systems (i. e., an increase in the exchange <b>bias</b> <b>shift</b> up to a maximum followed by a decrease until a steady state is reached), suggesting that, after annealing, the enriched Co areas might be rather similar in size for samples implanted above 1 x 1017 ions/cm², whereas the corresponding CoO counterparts become enlarged with pristine O content (i. e., effect of the antiferromagnet size).

Zero-field-cooled and field-cooled hysteresis loops were double shifted at temperatures below 200 K. This behavior {{is due to the}} presence of a range of antiferromagnetic crystallite sizes in addition to multiple magnetic phases (e. g., FeO, Fe 2 O 3, and NiO). Furthermore, the positive exchange <b>bias</b> loop <b>shift</b> decreases linearly with increasing temperature, with a compensation temperature T-comp similar to 220 K, after which negative exchange bias is measured.
