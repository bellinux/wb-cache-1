25|$|Random {{microsatellite}} primers can {{be developed}} by cloning random segments of DNA from the focal species. These random segments are inserted into a plasmid or <b>bacteriophage</b> <b>vector,</b> which is in turn implanted into Escherichia coli bacteria. Colonies are then developed, and screened with fluorescently–labelled oligonucleotide sequences that will hybridize to a microsatellite repeat, if present on the DNA segment. If positive clones {{can be obtained from}} this procedure, the DNA is sequenced and PCR primers are chosen from sequences flanking such regions to determine a specific locus. This process involves significant trial and error on the part of researchers, as microsatellite repeat sequences must be predicted and primers that are randomly isolated may not display significant polymorphism. Microsatellite loci are widely distributed throughout the genome and can be isolated from semi-degraded DNA of older specimens, as all that is needed is a suitable substrate for amplification through PCR.|$|E

40|$|There is {{considerable}} {{interest in the}} use of <b>bacteriophage</b> <b>vectors</b> for mammalian cell gene transfer applications, due to their stability, excellent safety profile and inexpensive mass production. However, to date, phage vectors have been plagued by mediocre performance as gene transfer agents. This may reflect the complexity of the viral infection process in mammalian cells and the need to refine each step of this process in order to arrive at an optimal, phage-based gene transfer system. Therefore, a flexible system was designed that alowed for the introduction of multiple modifications on the surface of bacteriophage lambda. Using this novel method, multiple peptides were displayed simultaneously from both the phage head and tail. Surface head display of an ubiquitinylation motif greatly increased the efficiency of phage-mediated gene transfer in a murine macrophage cell line. Gene transfer was further increased when this peptide was displayed in combination with a tail-displayed CD 40 -binding motif. Overall, this work provides a novel system {{that can be used to}} rationally improve <b>bacteriophage</b> gene transfer <b>vectors</b> and shows it may be possible to enhance the efficiency of phage-mediated gene transfer by targeting and optimizing multiple steps within the viral infection pathway...|$|R

We now show that, like eukaryotic viruses, <b>bacteriophage</b> <b>vectors</b> {{are subject to}} Fc receptor-mediated, antibody-dependent enhancement of infection in mammalian cells. Antibody-dependent enhancement of phage {{gene transfer}} required FcγRI, but not its associated γ-chain, and was not supported by other FcγR family members (FcγRIIA, FcγRIIB, and FcγRIII). Studies using chlorpromazine and latrunculin A revealed an important role for clathrin-mediated endocytosis (chlorpromazine) and actin filaments (latrunculin A) in antibody-enhanced phage gene transfer. This was confirmed by experiments using inhibitors of endosomal acidification (bafilomycin A 1, monensin) and by immunocytochemical colocalization of internalized phage particles with early endosome-associated protein- 1 (EAA 1). In contrast, microtubule-targeting agents (nocodazole, taxol) increased the efficiency of antibody-enhanced phage gene transfer.

They contained a common S. mutans DNA sequence of about 11. 8 kilobases and coded for a protein with a molecular weight of about 195, 000, which comigrated with a protein of an S. mutans cell wall extract. The expressed protein was purified, and a very strong relationship with the S. mutans 74 K SR protein was found by competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Thus, cloning of the 74 K SR gene allowed us to demonstrate that the saliva receptor appears {{to be a part of}} an S. mutans precursor molecule with a molecular mass of 195, 000 daltons...|$|R
