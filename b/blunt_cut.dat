50|$|Short {{hair for}} women became fashionable in the 1920s. Styles {{included}} the bob cut (a <b>blunt</b> <b>cut</b> to the chin or neck and cut evenly all around), the shingle bob (a haircut that was tapered short {{in the back}}) and cropped hair (cut short {{in the back and}} longer bangs in front). Women wore longer styles in the 1930s and 1940s, but short hair made a comeback when Audrey Hepburn sported a pixie cut (a very short wispy haircut) in the 1953 film Roman Holiday. Short hair was fairly popular throughout the 60s, but the 70s and 80s favored different hairstyles. It became popular in the 1990s and remains so to this day.|$|E
5000|$|This was Jeff Daniels and Harland Williams' second movie together; {{both had}} {{previously}} appeared in Dumb and Dumber (1994). The rat {{used for the}} beginning of the church scene is male, it then switches to being a female rat, and back again between shots. During the scene where the animals get loose, the same event is used twice. When Opal picks up the black and white rabbit to place in its pen, it is shown once as a close up of her 33:41 from behind and once from a distance 33:58 frontal. (This can be clearly seen in the full frame version, but not in the wide screen version at 33:41 where the wide screen cropping of the spherical 35 mm frames crop out the body of the rabbit. Consequently, it is a goof in re-mastering the full frame version from the spherical 35 mm negatives rather than a goof in the wide screen film. Of course, {{it could be argued that}} the rabbit got out again and needed to be put into the pen a second time.) In the scene where Opal brings Winn-Dixie into the church, when she gets up from her seat to get Winn-Dixie, there is a Bible and a purse on the chair beside her. After she returns from getting Winn-Dixie, there is somebody sitting in the seat beside her holding the Bible while the purse is on the floor between the two chairs. Opal's hair length varies throughout the movie, from a short <b>blunt</b> <b>cut,</b> to a longer, and uneven cut, and then back to short. When it starts raining, at the start of the garden party, all of the lights strung around start to flicker and go out. Except when you see everyone standing at the house, the lights to the right can be seen still on. Opal's hair changes from straight and flat to styled and blow-dried during the baseball game and party set-up scenes. The [...] "mouse" [...] Winn Dixie catches during the church service is a rat.|$|E
5000|$|The Mullet haircut {{existed in}} several {{different}} styles, all characterized by hair short on the sides and long in the back. Mullets were popular in suburban and rural areas among working class men. This contrasted with a conservative look favored by business professionals, with neatly groomed short hair and very short sideburns for men and sleekly straight hair for women. White collar men's haircuts were often shaved {{at the nape of}} the neck to create an artificially even hairline. Women's hairstyles became increasingly long {{in the latter part of}} the decade and <b>blunt</b> <b>cuts</b> dominated. <b>Blunt</b> <b>cuts</b> of the late 1980s brought long hair to an equal length across the back. Bangs were popular, with [...] "mall bangs", attributed to teenage girls who frequented shopping malls, were styled by ratting bangs into peaks or mounds, and then using hairspray to keep them in place.|$|R
50|$|During November 2012, President Obama {{expressed}} {{a preference for}} replacing the more <b>blunt</b> <b>cuts</b> of the sequester with more targeted cuts, while raising income tax rates on the top 2% of earners. Senior White House officials recommended a veto of any bill that: 1) averts defense cuts while leaving intact non-defense cuts; or 2) excludes an increase in tax rates for top earners. Obama wants to continue to extend the Bush tax cuts for American couples earning less than $250,000 and individuals earning less than $200,000.|$|R
50|$|Correct chain {{sharpening}} {{is paramount}} to safety in this context. <b>Blunt</b> chain <b>cuts</b> poorly {{and leads to}} increased operator fatigue and increased bar loading.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{procedure is}} proposed {{to measure the}} lowest elastic stored energy density leading to a rapid crack propagation (RCP) in polymeric materials. A strip specimen with a <b>blunt</b> saw <b>cut</b> is uniformly loaded and a razor is pushed into the saw cut to initiate the crack. The very high crack velocity which is reached is measured with a resistive coating on the sample surface. Results obtained for a rubber toughened PMMA show that fracture energy for RCP at approximately 500 m/s is much smaller than that in a quasi static tests.

25|$|Cavalry {{weapons and}} armor. Among the Fulani-Hausa armies of Sokoto, both horse and rider were shielded. The horse was {{generally}} covered by quilted cotton, stuffed with kapok fiber, and its rider generally rode into battle with finely wrought chain mail, or heavy quilted armor. The chain mail armor showed similarities to Mameluke design, but the quilting combined local invention with religious inspiration. Local armorers sew tightly rolled wads of paper inscribed with Quranic verses into {{the layers of}} cotton, and kapok. Whatever their spiritual powers, they could often <b>blunt</b> sword <b>cuts,</b> but were less effective against arrows. Body armor was supplemented by reinforced leather helmets, and tough shields of elephant or hippo hide. Horse stirrups often made effective weapons in a close fought melee, disemboweling enemy mounts and wounding enemy infantry.|$|R
50|$|O'Neill {{remained}} {{embedded with}} the Union District of the Frontier under Blunt. The Union operations had regained control of Fort Smith, and Blunt {{took steps to}} advance his headquarters from Fort Scott, in eastern Kansas, to the western Arkansas river port. His headquarters column, moving southward, had reached Baxter Springs, Kansas when they were intercepted and ambushed on October 6, 1863 by Quantrill's Raiders. This somewhat irregular unit of Southern rangers, commanded by guerrilla warrior William Quantrill, {{did not make a}} practice of taking prisoners. Unarmed and ancillary personnel in <b>Blunt's</b> column were <b>cut</b> down. Correspondent O'Neill was killed in action.|$|R
30|$|The open-entry {{technique}} {{has a low}} complication rate with respect to vascular lesions [12]. In the open technique, a small infraumbilical laparotomy is performed. The skin, rectus sheath, and peritoneum are then incised under direct vision. Incision of the fascia can be facilitated by placing two stay sutures through the fascia, then elevating the fascia and incising it between the two sutures. The peritoneum can now be opened with a <b>blunt</b> clamp or <b>cut</b> open using forceps and scissors. Thereafter a blunt-tipped (Hasson’s) trocar and cannula are inserted and a pneumoperitoneum created [13]. The cannula is kept in place {{with the use of}} the fascia sutures. After the procedure, the sutures are used to close the created fascia defect. An alternative to the Hasson’s trocar is the balloon trocar.|$|R
40|$|Experienced chefs {{know that}} to make a neat cut in a boiled egg {{or a piece of}} cheese, a thin wire, or even a fine piece of thread, can work better than a knife. But even a <b>blunt</b> knife can <b>cut</b> soft solids well if it is rocked back and forth while {{applying}} a gentle pressure. Understanding the balance of forces needed to make a clean cut into deformable materials could be important for developing highly efficient techniques in industrial-scale food processing, or new tools for cutting biological tissue for analysis or during surgery. Writing in Physical Review Letters[1], Etienne Reyssat, at Harvard University, and colleagues provide an intriguing analysis of the cutting of soft solids, applying a combination of theory and experiments to pinpoint the role played by shear in facilitating the fracture of a highly deformable material.

50|$|It is {{generally}} believed {{that while the}} Duchess was sleeping her husband murdered her while she was visiting Paris. After Deluzy was fired, the Duke paid {{for her to have}} an apartment in Paris and he had been away staying with her. The Duchess had her throat slashed and then she was hit with <b>blunt</b> objects, leaving <b>cuts</b> and marks all over her body, until she was dead. This caused further scandal because her husband being a Duke meant that even though he was believed guilty, he was protected from being sentenced and jailed until other peers met and came to an agreement on the proceedings. While the Duke awaited what was likely to be a long prison sentence, he began poisoning himself with what is believed to be arsenic, and he died within six days of first appearing sick on August 24, 1847. He never confessed to his wife's murder. The governess, Henriette Deluzy, was also arrested because officials believed she could {{have been involved in the}} plot with the Duke to kill the Duchess. She was eventually cleared of any wrongdoing, and left France, immigrating to the United States. The younger children of the Duke and Duchess were split up and raised by family members.|$|R
40|$|HÃ necessidade de pesquisas que envolvam a integraÃÃo lavoura-pecuÃria, utilizando trigos diferenciados, que podem ser usados com duplo propÃsito. Por isso neste trabalho, objetivou-se avaliar as caracterÃsticas agronÃmicas e a qualidade da farinha nos genÃtipos de trigos de duplo propÃsito e de novos genÃtipos, submetidos ao {{manejo de}} cortes na fase de perfilhamento. Foram conduzidos dois experimentos no municÃpio de Cascavel, no delineamento de blocos ao acaso com parcelas subdivididas, com quatro repetiÃÃes. Em um dos ensaios as prioridades foram o manejo de corte e a adaptaÃÃo dos genÃtipos de duplo propÃsito. E no outro foi a avaliaÃÃo de genÃtipo para duplo o propÃsito. No primeiro ensaio na parcela foram alocados os trigos (BRS- 277 e BRS-TarumÃ) e nas subparcelas os manejos de cortes (sem corte, com um corte e, com dois cortes) totalizando seis tratamentos. No segundo ensaio na parcela foram alocados os genÃtipos de trigo da Coodetec (BATT 10 - 108, BATT 10 - 109, BATT- 114, BATT- 115, BATT- 119, BATT- 120 e S 09 - 167) e os genÃtipos de duplo propÃsito da Embrapa (BRS- 277 e BRS-TarumÃ) e nas subparcelas foi alocado o manejo de corte (sem corte e com um corte) totalizando 18 tratamentos. Nos dois experimentos foram avaliadas as caracterÃsticas agronÃmicas que foram a matÃria seca, a produtividade de grÃos, a massa de mil grÃos, o nÃmero de grÃos espiga- 1, o nÃmero de espigas m- 2 e a altura de planta. Na qualidade da farinha foram avaliadas a forÃa geral do glÃten, a relaÃÃo de tenacidade por extensibilidade, o glÃten Ãmido, o glÃten seco, o peso hectolÃtrico (qualidade do grÃo), o nÃmero de queda, as cinzas em base seca e a cor (L*, a* e b*). No primeiro ensaio as matÃrias secas dos trigo de duplo propÃsito BRS-TarumÃ (1. 523 kg ha- 1) e BRS- 277 (1. 397 kg ha- 1) nÃo diferenciaram entre si. As produtividades de grÃos sem corte (2. 014 kg ha- 1) e com um corte (1. 779 kg ha- 1) foram semelhantes entre si, mas diferem do manejo com dois cortes (889 kg ha- 1). O menor valor de forÃa geral do glÃten foi do trigo BRS- 277 (323 10 - 4 J) com dois cortes e o maior do BRS-TarumÃ (449 10 - 4 J) com um corte. O aumento do nÃmero de cortes apresentou melhorias para a matÃria seca, a altura de planta e o nÃmero de queda, com reduÃÃo na produtividade de grÃos e massa de mil grÃos, possibilitando no manejo com um corte melhoria na qualidade da farinha nos genÃtipos de trigo. No segundo ensaio com um corte as maiores produtividades de grÃos foram dos genÃtipos BATT- 115 (3. 063 kg ha- 1), BATT- 120 (2. 792 kg ha- 1) e BRS-TarumÃ (2. 657 kg ha- 1). Para o manejo com corte os genÃtipos S 09 - 167 (78, 63 kg hL- 1) e BATT- 114 (78, 13 kg hL- 1) obtiveram os maiores valores de peso hectolÃtrico, porÃm o nÃmero de queda foi entre 220 e 250 s classificado estes como tipo 2. Os genÃtipos da Coodetec que apresentaram as caracterÃsticas agronÃmicas e de qualidade da farinha mais semelhantes aos trigos de duplo propÃsito da Embrapa foram o BATT- 115, o BATT- 119 e o BATT- 120 There need to {{research}} involving crop-livestock integration, using different wheats, {{which can be}} used with dual purpose. Therefore this study aimed to evaluate the agronomic characteristics and quality of flour in wheat genotypes and dual-purpose and of the new genotypes, submitted to the management of cuts in the phase of tillering. Two experiments were conducted in Cascavel, in the design of randomized blocks with split plot with four replications. In a test the priorities were the cutting management and adaptation of genotypes dual-purpose. And the other was to evaluate the genotype for the double purpose. In the first test in the plot were allocated the wheat (BRS- 277 and BRS-TarumÃ) and subplots managements of <b>cuts</b> (<b>blunt,</b> with one <b>cut,</b> and with two cuts), totaling six treatments. In the second test in the plot were assigned the genotypes of Coodetec (BATT 10 - 108, BATT 10 - 109 - 114 BATT, BATT- 115 - 119 BATT, BATT- 120 and S 09 - 167) and the genotypes of wheat of dual purpose of Embrapa (BRS 277 and BRS-TarumÃ) and subplots managements of <b>cuts</b> (<b>blunt,</b> with one <b>cut),</b> totaling 18 treatments. In two experiments were evaluated agronomic characteristics the dry matter, the grain yield, the mass of thousand grains, the number of grains spike- 1, the number of spikes m- 2 and the plant height. As flour was evaluated the general force of the gluten, the ratio of tenacity of extensibility, the wet gluten, dry gluten, the hectoliter weight (grain quality), the number of fall, the ash on a dry basis and color (L *, a * and b *). In the first experiment the dry matter of wheat dual purpose BRS-TarumÃ (1. 523 kg ha- 1) and BRS- 277 (1. 397 kg ha- 1) did not differentiated between them. Yields of grain blunt (2. 014 kg ha- 1) and one cut (1. 779 kg ha- 1) were similar, but differ from management with two cuts (889 kg ha- 1). The force general of gluten smaller was the wheat BRS- 277 (323 10 - 4 J) with two cuts and higher BRS-TarumÃ (449 10 - 4 J) with one cut. The {{increase in the number of}} cuts presented improvements to the dry matter, plant height and number of falls, with a reduction in grain yield and thousand grain weight, enabling the management to with one cut, better quality of flour in wheat genotypes. In the second test with one cut the highest yield of grain was found in the genotypes BATT- 115 (3. 063 kg ha- 1), BATT- 120 (2. 792 kg ha- 1) and BRS-TarumÃ (2. 657 kg ha- 1). For the management to cut the genotypes S 09 - 167 (78, 63 kg hL- 1) and BATT- 114 (78, 13 kg hL- 1) obtained the highest values of hectoliter weight, however the falling number was between 220 to 250 s this classified as type 2. The genotypes of Coodetec that presented the agronomic characteristics and quality of flour more similar to the wheat double purpose of Embrapa were BATT- 115, the BATT- 119 and BATT- 12...|$|R
