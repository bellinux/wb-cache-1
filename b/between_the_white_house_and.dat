5|$|Roosevelt won the 1940 presidential election. After Minton {{left office}} in January 1941, {{he was given}} a {{position}} in the Roosevelt administration as a reward for his loyalty during the court packing failure. He served as one of the president's advisers and a liaison <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>and</b> Congress. The extent of his duties is not fully known; Linda Gugin has speculated that he may have managed Roosevelt's patronage system. Minton was responsible for getting several officials appointed to high offices in the federal bureaucracy and numerous others appointed to lower ranking positions. He also convinced Roosevelt to support the creation of a Senate defense committee chaired by Truman, a position that brought Truman into the national spotlight and helped him gain the vice presidency.|$|E

25|$|The WHCD {{has been}} {{increasingly}} criticized {{as an example}} of <b>the</b> coziness <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> press corps and the administration. The dinner typically includes a skit, either live or videotaped, by the sitting president in which he mocks himself, for the amusement of the press corps. The press corps, in turn, hobnobs with administration officials, even those who are unpopular and are not regularly cooperative with the press. Increasing scrutiny by bloggers has contributed to added public focus on this friendliness.|$|R
2500|$|On September 24, McCain {{announced}} that he would [...] "suspend" [...] his campaign and seek to delay a debate with Barack Obama scheduled for September 26 so that he could work with Congress toward a reworking of and agreement on the Paulson financial rescue plan.

At a bipartisan meeting at <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> on September 25 (pictured) McCain came across as unconstructive and ineffectual to Bush, who felt that McCain had forced him to hold a pointless meeting and then had said nothing at it.|$|R
25|$|The textile {{question}} {{played a}} role in West's election, as thousands of mill workers who had strayed from the Democratic Party to support George C. Wallace's independent candidacy returned to their ancestral political home. Each party blamed the other for the failure to obtain import restrictions. Democrats expressed alarm that textile workers were losing jobs as plants were unable to compete on the world market. Democrats urged President Nixon through executive orders to curtail clothing imports from the Far East; Republicans insisted that only Congress had the legal authority to limit the importation of man-made fabrics. Presidential counselor Harry S. Dent, Sr., of South Carolina, another former aide to Strom Thurmond and the liaison official <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>and</b> the state GOP organizations, said that the administration was meeting with foreign competitors to devise voluntary restraints.

Morton's duties blurred the line between his public and political duties, and caused controversy concerning how Morton would divide his time <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>and</b> Ford's election campaign, and how much of his salary would be supplied by taxpayers versus the Ford election committee. In rebuttal, Morton stated [...] "you can't separate government from politics", and that Presidential aides should be allowed to offer political advice.|$|E
500|$|On January 13, 1970, Nixon {{appointed}} Chotiner as {{a special}} counsel to the President, reporting to White House Chief of Staff Haldeman, a move {{the chief of staff}} described in his diaries as a [...] "mixed blessing".

Haldeman noted in his diaries that his new subordinate was to serve as the [...] "inside White House man for political campaigns". Chotiner served as liaison <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>and</b> Republican organizations in 31 states. Chotiner taught at a March 1970 seminar for Young Republican leaders where he suggested that the Republican running against Senator Edward Kennedy mention the Chappaquiddick incident at every opportunity, while insisting that it was not an issue in the campaign.

40|$|<b>White</b> <b>House</b> press {{briefings}} are daily meetings <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> {{press secretary}} and the press.

Security has always been a key concept in political debate (Buzan 2000), particularly after the events of 9 / 11 and the rising of a new regime of international security (Fairclough 2007). Our analysis of a corpus of press briefings ranging across five presidencies, from Bill Clinton to Barack Obama, will focus on the lexical item security from a modern diachronic corpus-assisted discourse studies perspective (Partington 2010). The analysis of the collocational profile of security across time will enable us to assess the phraseological evolution of the senses of the term and its conceptualisation in US political debate, from “social security” (during Bill Clinton presidencies) to “homeland security” (especially during the first George W. Bush administration), and up to “national security” (in Obama’s presidential term) ...|$|R

50|$|During {{the period}} in which Dr. Masterson worked on <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> Staff, <b>the</b> Executive Branch Liaison Office (of which he was a member) {{performed}} three major functions. First, it acted as <b>the</b> liaison <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House,</b> Cabinet departments and the independent agencies. To accomplish this, Masterson and Rumbough brought about the production of Fact Papers. These fact papers were issued weekly. These papers were meant to acquaint members of the Eisenhower team (including ambassadors) with information on current administration problems, pronouncements and goals, in brief, legible form. Fact Papers were duplicated and sent throughout the country by the Young Republicans, the Women’s Division of the Republican National Committee and members of the Republican Congressional Committee (who, in turn, sent them to GOP congressmen for use in speeches and newsletters). As of January 1955, actual circulation of the Fact Papers had reached 100,000. Spokesmen for the administration were urged to use the Fact Papers as a ready reference in their speeches and other contacts with the public.|$|R
50|$|Shortly {{after the}} Eisenhower {{administration}} became settled in <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House,</b> there appeared <b>the</b> {{need to keep}} the public informed of the current policies, accomplishments and goals of the President and his administration. Thus, shortly after Inauguration Day, Val Peterson (former Governor of Nebraska) was appointed to a position as an Administrative Assistant to President Dwight D. Eisenhower. He was to act as presidential liaison with the various cabinet departments and independent agencies. Upon his leaving in March of that same year to assume the post of Administrator of the Federal Civil Defense Administration, Walter Williams and his (acting) special assistant, Stanley M. Rumbough, Jr. assumed the task of liaison <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House,</b> <b>the</b> cabinet departments and independent agencies. Walter Williams (then Under Secretary of Commerce), originally brought into <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> to establish a system of nationwide economic reporters, resumed his duties at the Commerce Department in late 1953. In September 1953, his position was filled by Charles F. Masterson, a former associate of both Rumbough and Charlie Willis, having worked with them in the National Citizens for Eisenhower organization in the 1952 campaign.|$|R
2500|$|The Inspector General also {{concluded}} that the dispute <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>and</b> the DOJ concerned [...] "Other Intelligence Activities," [...] which, {{though they had been}} implemented through the same Presidential Authorization, were {{not the same as the}} communications interception activities that the President publicly identified as the Terrorist Surveillance Program.

2500|$|In December 1995, Robinson {{was named}} {{chairman}} of a 14-member ad hoc panel established by President Bill Clinton to propose a redesign of the closed segment of Pennsylvania Avenue NW <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>and</b> Lafayette Square. The panel proposed a [...] "town square" [...] idea that would remove the pavement and plant a field of grass, as well as add retail, food service, and educational kiosks to make the area a more attractive gathering place. Unsightly security barriers would be replaced with more decorative planters, access points to Lafayette Square would be widened into better gateways to the park, star-like paving would be used throughout the park, and tour buses would be banned from the area. The panel's design plan extended these decorative motifs several blocks in every direction from the White House.

2500|$|In March 2004, the TSP operations, (code-named Stellar Wind,) {{became the}} focal point for a dispute <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>and</b> then-acting-Attorney-General James B.

[...] According to initial statements by Gonzales, the disagreement was not over TSP; rather, he claimed it concerned other classified intelligence activities which fell under the PSP, which had not been disclosed. However, Comey contended that the incident, (which had culminated in a heated phone conversation following the hospital visit,) had indeed been over the activities comprising the TSP. Through a spokesperson, Gonzales later denied his original assertion that the dispute was over TSP, claiming that he had misspoken. The controversy over these conflicting statements led Senator Charles Schumer to request appointment of a special prosecutor to investigate if Gonzales had committed perjury.|$|E
