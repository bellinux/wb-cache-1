The expense of running such large establishments in a manner appropriate to their opulence was stupendous. Unfortunately, the only detailed household accounts which have survived date from the period just before the new houses were completed but a detailed study of these accounts made by Bishop Brian C. Foley reveals that, in 1760, Robert employed, in the Thorndon Hall household alone, 35 servants. In spite of the modest salaries involved (which ranged from £2 per annum for Elizabeth Summers, the under-nursery maid, to £40 per annum for Mr. Montier, the chef), the wage bill for the year amounted to the tidy sum of £473 18s. Moreover, it is likely that, once the new Thorndon Hall was complete, the roster of household staff would have been significantly increased; there are but three housemaids on the 1760 list, not enough for a house the size of the new Hall.|$|E

40|$|Thermal {{energy storage}} {{can be an}} {{attractive}} technology to enable re-use of waste-heat, especially for batch processes. A case study was carried out to evaluate the technical and economical feasibility of an industrial heat storage system. The study focused on integration of a heat storage system within an existing production facility of organic surfactants. Three different thermal storage systems with operating temperatures between 110 °C to 160 °C were designed to store the heat released during the exothermic reaction phase and re-use the heat for preheating of the reactants in the following batch. The first system uses a Phase Change Material (PCM) contained in metal balls with an assumed phase change temperature at 140 °C. The second system uses a concrete volume as a sensible heat storage material and the third system is also based on concrete, but with a doubling of the storage capacity. A dynamic simulation was performed of a reference cycle of a batch reactor coupled with a thermal storage system to calculate energy savings for preheating of the reactants. It was required to oversize the storage capacity of the PCM system, {{in order to obtain}} a heat transfer rate that matches with the conditions of the actual process. The calculated energy savings for heating of the batch reactors is 50 to 70 %, resulting in financial savings of 26 to 38 k€ on an annual basis. The total capital investment of the storage systems is estimated at 440 to 540 k€. Simple pay out time is higher than 10 years, with the best result for the concrete heat storage. The <b>bare</b> <b>cost</b> of the thermal buffer is 15 % to 30 % of the total capital investment.

Direct costs of mammography screening include cost per mammography, cost per recall examination, maintenance of mammography buses, cost of invitations/results/reminders for mammography, recalling for recall examination, office space, personnel, whilst indirect costs consist of time cost, travelling cost and productivity loss.

Not surprisingly, some individuals are willing to <b>bare</b> additional <b>costs</b> in order to punish defectors.

By means of phase diagrams and the analysis of emerging spatial patterns, we demonstrate that adaptive punishment promotes public cooperation either through the invigoration of spatial reciprocity, the prevention of the emergence of cyclic dominance, or through the provision of competitive advantages to those that sanction antisocial behavior. Presented results indicate that the process of self-organization significantly elevates the effectiveness of punishment, and they reveal new mechanisms by means of which this fascinating and widespread social behavior could have evolved.

In 1979 came the biggest discovery by the German Archaeological Institute. On the left wall of the adyton, small very thin scratched lines were discovered. A closer examination brought the first ancient blueprint of a temple back to life. Starting just after the entrance on an area of 200 m2 were the blueprints and a roughly calculated estimate. The discovery and interpretation made by Lothar Haselberger led to some important information about the planning and the building phase of the Apollo Temple, notably that, in addition to meticulous use of geometry in scribing the profiles of mouldings, the architect permitted himself some intuitive adjustments, guided, but not bound, by the strict obligations imposed on him by the traditional geometry of the design; he transcended these self-imposed rules whenever his aesthetics demanded. Today it is known that three different contractors worked until the end. All three had the responsibility to get the material on site, place the stones, and do the first refinement. After that, a small part was left on every placed block, a small cachet with a special sign of the contractor which indicated that this particular block was not yet paid for. Further on, the inscriptions led to the information that one column would have taken 20,000 workdays to complete by one mason. There were more masons working per column, but {{just for the sake of}} calculation: the daily income of a stonemason was 2 drachmas, which is the cost of approx. 8.6 grams of silver.

Hence the shoulder of the embankment had to be reconstructed. The erosion control strategies on the plots were centred on control (doing nothing after surface preparation), limited use of erosion control blankets and waste ballast as mulch on seeded plots. It has been demonstrated that with a cost effective irrigation system, 100 % grass cover establishment on railway batters is achievable within 12 weeks. 100 % grass cover reduces erosion by over 90 % compared with the <b>bare</b> scenario.

The average yearly income of coastal fishers is US$ 30, 000, and the maximum amount of pension that fishers can receive is US$ 10, 000. The benefits of continuing to fish for pension fishers are their fishery income, certain food supply for themselves, associated benefits of maintaining membership with fishery cooperatives, and their participation with the community. There is no loss, for their opportunity costs are zero, and they are not forced to work. The benefits to the community, on the other hand, can be identified as opportunity costs that might amount if they retire, such as the costs of day-care services provided for free for the elderly and some social security payments provided for the poor. The fishery sector pays additional costs, such as the maintenance costs of fishery infrastructures, hidden <b>costs</b> <b>bared</b> by stagnant fishery reform, and annoying paternalism.

40|$|The global {{absolute}} poverty {{rates of the}} World Bank demonstrate a continued decline of poverty in developing countries between 1983 and 2012. However, the methodology applied to derive these results has received extensive criticism by scholars for requiring the application of PPP exchange rates and CPIs that are not constructed to capture the consumption habits of {{those who live in}} {{absolute poverty}}. Those methodological concerns cast reasonable doubts on the poverty rates reported. First, in this paper, I demonstrate the validity of the hypothesis that the World Bank’s method inconsistently measures global absolute poverty. Second, I introduce new estimates of global absolute poverty based on a consistent methodology suitable for comparisons in time and between countries. For this purpose, I follow a well known concept of measuring bare bones subsistence using a consumption basket. This absolute poverty yardstick tracks <b>bare</b> bones survival <b>costs</b> and is priced in domestic nominal terms. The minimum caloric requirements are calculated separately for each country and year based on the demographic composition. The exact composition of the baskets is determined separately for each combination of country and year. The non-food component contains, among others, clothing and fuel consumption for basic heating, linked to monthly average temperature data. The results validate the critique on the World Bank’s methodology. They demonstrate large discrepancies in levels, which I find in many cases several times lower of what they report. This difference is far from being a linear change in all countries, which in turn fundamentally changes the geography and development of global absolute poverty. A sharp post 1990 increase together with a thereafter modest but longer decline brings the 2012 estimate only 1 % lower than 1990...|$|R

The existing station will have to be rebuilt to accommodate the increased volume of passengers using the station.

This will also open the possibility to use alternative energy paths to secure mobility and making the road transport more independent from crude oil. This chapter analyses the possible role that EVs (it includes Battery Electric Vehicles –BEV, and Plug-in Hybrid Vehicles – PHEV) might play within the urban environment in the short, medium and long term, discusses the expected gains in environmental performance, presents the main bottlenecks in its deployment and addresses the possible additional <b>cost</b> <b>bare</b> by the technology. The chapter also examines the possible business models and policy options that might be put in place in order to support a faster market intake for the electrification of the urban transport. However, the potential of EV to reduce the impact of transportation varies from impact to impact and also depends on the time scale. In other words it does not represent the “silver bullet” to face the problem of environmental decay and transportation inefficiencies (traffic congestions) in our metropolitan areas and as such, it needs to be considered as an option {{in a wide range of}} possibilities at our disposal to meet this challenge. These options include also non-technological alternatives that together with the technological ones need to be considered in a holistic approach.

40|$|Current {{renewable}} {{jet fuel}} (RJF) volumes are limited due to low demand {{as a result}} of high prices. Stringent quality and sustainability criteria require advanced conversion technologies. It is argued that the evolution towards greenfield, cellulosic biofuel production can be expedited by pursuing co-production strategies in which the production facility is located next to (co-location) or integrated (retro-fitted) with existing assets. Potential benefits of co-production include, amongst others, shared supply chains and plant infrastructure. However, {{little is known about the}} comparative techno-economic performance of the production pathways for RJF as well as the economic merits of co-production strategies for the development of RJF. This research assesses the techno-economic performance of co-production strategies (i. e. feedstock-technology combination) of RJF at existing facilities of the pulp and paper, wheat ethanol and beet sugar industry in the EU- 28. The results are used to compare the co-production strategies amongst each other and juxtapose them to greenfield production. The techno-economic assessment comprises the production pathways currently approved for commercial flight or under review by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM). Based on the primary and secondary residue streams in the selected industries, thirteen co-production strategies were selected. The co-production strategies were assessed on a consistent basis for technology-specific <b>bare</b> equipment <b>costs,</b> mass and energy balances and GHG balances which were adopted from existing software-modelling studies. The SCENT factorial estimation method was used to estimate total capital and operating expenditures. A novel methodology was formulated to quantify the benefits of co-production with respect to greenfield production. Geospatial features were taken into account using local feedstock availability on NUTS- 3 level, nation-specific parameters (e. g. feedstock prices, labor costs) and the actual locations of existing facilities. The minimum fuel selling price (MFSP), i. e. the cost price at which the RJF needs to be sold to achieve a zero net present value, was used for evaluation. The results show that biochemical pathways yield a higher MFSP than thermochemical pathways for RJF production, largely because of the lower conversion yields (on feedstock dry basis) and the high capital cost of lignocellulosic sugar extraction. The spread in MFSP indicates the results at different production locations. Co-production strategies based on Pyrolysis and HTL show the lowest MFSP due to relatively high conversion yields and modest CAPEX. Also, co-location can reduce the MFSP with 4 - 8 % with respect to greenfield configurations, mainly due to reduced CAPEX. A pioneer plant analysis shows that co-production has larger economic benefits in the early stages of development. Wheat ethanol facilities and pulp mills prove better incubator facilities than sugar mills as the former two industries accumulate more substantial amounts of residues along their supply chain, resulting in advantages of economies of scale. Lastly, the results show a spatial preference towards countries with low labor costs and low feedstock cost (i. e. Eastern EU and Portugal). It is concluded that co-production strategies can potentially be a catalyst for the ramp-up of RJF production in the short term in the EU- 28, particularly in the first stages of development of a technology...|$|R
40|$|Although the {{concepts}} of chromatic dispersion and chirp are far from new {{in the world of}} wireless microwave communication, their application has always been constrained by the limited bandwidths, insertion losses and integration issues of dispersive devices. Often, a microwave designer seeking to incorporate chirping would fall back on surface-acoustic-wave structures, which are very lossy and do not easily penetrate into the GHz frequency-band, or else photonics-based solutions (e. g. chirped fiber Bragg gratings), which provide high bandwidths but incur integration and cost issues. This is in part due to the perceived lack of a convenient dispersive structure in electronics that is sufficiently low-loss and broadband in the GHz frequency range. Such a structure has in fact been recently demonstrated: it is a chirped electromagnetic bandgap (CEBG), and our work has explored its potential in a number of ultra-wideband sub-systems designed to perform a variety of signal processing tasks. Of particular interest is the close-fitting synergy between the operational frequencies of this new structure and the rapidly emerging ultra-wideband (UWB) wireless technology, which strives to handle signals with fractional bandwidths that can exceed 100 % [...] -a task for which CEBGs are well-suited. This thesis details the first demonstrations of several practical microwave sub-systems made possible by employing dispersive CEBG structures implemented in transmission-line technologies at a <b>bare</b> minimum of <b>cost</b> and complexity. Many of these demonstrations challenge the assumption that transduction to the optical or acoustic domain is required in order to perform dispersion-enabled tasks on very broadband electrical signals.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that the United States’ {{dependence}} on crude-oil negatively affects its economy, safety, and environment. To alleviate these negative consequences, a more economical and environmentally-friendly source of fuel, such as biomass, should be explored. The conversion of biomass to bio-oils involves the pyrolysis of biomass at about 500 °C, thus requiring a great deal of heat. This heat source could be the excess waste heat from a coal gasifier. As such, this report specifies the design of an industrial plant that produces bio-oils from biomass by using the waste heat from a coal gasifier. It is designed to produce 2. 24 × 108 kg/yr of bio-oil that can be sold at $ 0. 79 /kg. This plant involves coal and biomass solids handling, a coal gasification reactor, a biomass pyrolysis reactor, and a series of separation units to remove waste products from the syngas and isolate the bio-oil. The syngas contains methane, hydrogen, and carbon monoxide and is sold as a by-product credit. The plant is expected to run on feeds of 1. 5 x 1011 kg/yr of coal and 5. 4 x 108 kg/yr of raw biomass. The coal gasification reactor was sized based on the heating duty of steam at 273000 kJ/s and the biomass pyrolysis reactor was sized based on a heating duty of 7026 kJ/s. The plant’s operating factor (POF) is 0. 9 at 7884 hrs/yr running 24 hrs/day and 328. 5 days/yr. The total <b>bare</b> module equipment <b>cost,</b> including all pumps, heat exchangers, grinders, separators, absorber, and reactors is $ 93 million. The total capital investment of the plant is $ 173 million. The DCFRR and NRR are 12. 59 % and 20 % respectively.
