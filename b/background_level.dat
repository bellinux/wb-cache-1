5|$|On 9 and 10 October 1946, the {{telescope}} {{was used to}} observe the ionisation in the atmosphere caused by meteors in the Giacobinids meteor shower. When the antenna was turned by 90 degrees at the maximum of the shower, the number of detections dropped to the <b>background</b> <b>level,</b> proving that the transient signals detected by radar were indeed from meteors. Shortly after this, {{the telescope}} {{was used to determine}} the radiant points for meteors. This was possible as the echo rate is at a minimum at the radiant point, and a maximum at 90 degrees to it. The telescope, as well as other receivers on the site, was also used to study auroral streamers that were visible at the site in early August 1947.|$|E
5|$|The PHEBUS {{experiment}} {{was designed by}} CESR (Toulouse) to record high energy transient events in the range 100keV to 100MeV. It consisted of two independent detectors and their associated electronics. Each detector consisted of a bismuth germanate (BGO) crystal 78mm in diameter by 120mm thick, surrounded by a plastic anti-coincidence jacket. The two detectors were arranged on the spacecraft so as to observe 4π steradians. The burst mode was triggered when the count rate in the 0.1 to 1.5MeV energy range exceeded the <b>background</b> <b>level</b> by 8 sigma in either 0.25 or 1.0 seconds. There were 116 energy channels.|$|E
5|$|McClintock's {{breakthrough}} publications, {{and support}} from her colleagues, led to her being awarded several postdoctoral fellowships from the National Research Council. This funding allowed her to continue to study genetics at Cornell, the University of Missouri, and the California Institute of Technology, where she worked with E. G. Anderson. During the summers of 1931 and 1932, she worked at Missouri with geneticist Lewis Stadler, who introduced her {{to the use of}} X-rays as a mutagen. Exposure to X-rays can increase the rate of mutation above the natural <b>background</b> <b>level,</b> making it a powerful research tool for genetics. Through her work with X-ray-mutagenized maize, she identified ring chromosomes, which form when the ends of a single chromosome fuse together after radiation damage. From this evidence, McClintock hypothesized that there must be a structure on the chromosome tip that would normally ensure stability. She showed that the loss of ring-chromosomes at meiosis caused variegation in maize foliage in generations subsequent to irradiation resulting from chromosomal deletion. During this period, she demonstrated the presence of the nucleolus organizer region on a region on maize chromosome 6, which is required for the assembly of the nucleolus. In 1933, she established that cells can be damaged when nonhomologous recombination occurs. During this same period, McClintock hypothesized that the tips of chromosomes are protected by telomeres.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} metal concentrations in unaffected streams located in Västerbotten, Sweden, with the hypothesis that even though unaffected by human activities, some streams will show high metal concentrations due to bedrock geology. Based on previous hypothesis the aim was also to evaluate regional <b>background</b> <b>levels</b> set by the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency, to emphasise the difficulty in using said <b>background</b> <b>levels</b> when evaluating metal loading. Twenty four streams were investigated and plotted according to bedrock, stream order and distance from area of mining explorations, TOC and pH. The results showed that metal concentrations differed from estimated <b>background</b> <b>levels,</b> especially in regard to arsenic and lead. Concentrations of arsenic was in many locations higher than estimated <b>background</b> <b>levels,</b> in Barsele area, very high concentrations was noted. There were also a distinct difference between locations in mountainous areas (mostly mafic and sedimentary rock), that had lower concentrations, and locations in the Baltic shield (mostly felsic and pyrite rock), with higher concentrations than estimated <b>background</b> <b>levels.</b> Concentrations of lead was in all cases lower than estimated <b>background</b> <b>levels,</b> and lowest in the mountainous area. Locations with stream order one often had higher metal concentrations than streams with higher order, indicating a negative correlation between <b>background</b> <b>levels</b> and stream order, the opposite of what had been estimated by Swedish Environmental Protection Agency – with lower metal concentration in smaller streams. ...|$|R

500|$|Within the brain, {{dopamine}} functions {{partly as}} a [...] "global reward signal", where an initial phasic dopamine response to a rewarding stimulus encodes information about the salience, value, and context of a reward. In the context of reward-related learning, dopamine also functions as a reward prediction error signal, that is, {{the degree to which}} the value of a reward is unexpected. According to this hypothesis of Wolfram Schultz, rewards that are expected do not produce a second phasic dopamine response in certain dopaminergic cells, but rewards that are unexpected, or greater than expected, produce a short-lasting increase in synaptic dopamine, whereas the omission of an expected reward actually causes dopamine release to drop below its <b>background</b> <b>level.</b> The [...] "prediction error" [...] hypothesis has drawn particular interest from computational neuroscientists, because an influential computational-learning method known as temporal difference learning makes heavy use of a signal that encodes prediction error.

To put this dose into context, while the average background radiation in the US is about 360 millirem per year, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission regulates all workers' of any US nuclear power plant exposure to radiation to a total of 5000 millirem per year. Based on these low emission figures, early scientific publications on the health effects of the fallout estimated one or two additional cancer deaths in the 10-mile area around TMI.|$|E
2500|$|Small {{traces of}} {{plutonium}} {{have been found}} in the soil near the stricken reactors: repeated examinations of the soil suggest that the plutonium level is similar to the <b>background</b> <b>level</b> caused by atomic bomb tests. As the isotope signature of the plutonium is closer to that of power-reactor plutonium, TEPCO suggested that [...] "two samples out of five may be the direct result of the recent incident." [...] The more important thing to look at is the curium level in the soil; the soil does contain a short-lived isotope (curium-242) which shows that some alpha emitters have been released in small amounts by the accident. The release of the beta/gamma emitters such as caesium-137 has been far greater. In the short and medium term the effects of the iodine and the caesium release will dominate the effect of the accident on farming and the general public. In common with almost all soils, the soil at the reactor site contains uranium, but the concentration of uranium and the isotope signature suggests that the uranium is the normal, natural uranium in the soil.|$|E
2500|$|Between 1965 and 1968 {{production}} of 2,4,5-trichlorophenol in Spolana Neratovice plant in Czechoslovakia seriously poisoned about 60 workers with dioxins; after 3 years of {{investigation of the}} health problems of workers, Spolana stopped manufacture of 2,4,5-T (most of which was supplied to the US military in Vietnam). Several buildings of the Spolana chemical plant were heavily contaminated by dioxins. Unknown amounts of dioxins were flushed into the Elbe and Mulde rivers during the 2002 European flood, contaminating soil.

2500|$|Uncertainty exists {{regarding}} {{the duration of}} the overall extinction and about the timing and duration of various groups' extinctions within the greater process. Some evidence suggests that there were multiple extinction pulses or that the extinction was spread out over a few million years, with a sharp peak in the last million years of the Permian. Statistical analyses of some highly fossiliferous strata in Meishan, Zhejiang Province in southeastern China, suggest that the main extinction was clustered around one peak. Recent research shows that different groups became extinct at different times; for example, while difficult to date absolutely, ostracod and brachiopod extinctions were separated by 670 to 1170 thousand years. In a well-preserved sequence in east Greenland, the decline of animals is concentrated in a period 10 to [...] long, with plants taking several hundred thousand additional years to show the full impact of the event. An older theory, still supported in some recent papers, is that there were two major extinction pulses 9.4 million years apart, separated by a period of extinctions well above the <b>background</b> <b>level,</b> and that the final extinction killed off only about 80% of marine species alive at that time while the other losses occurred during the first pulse or the interval between pulses.
