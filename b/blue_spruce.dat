5|$|Although Sidney was the {{architect}} of the cemetery, it was superintendent John Boetcher that gave Oakwood its charm. Boetcher became superintendent in 1871 and continued in the position until 1898. At the beginning of his tenure, Oakwood was said to be quite crude. During Boetcher's tenure Oakwood's most important icons were built: the Earl Chapel and Crematorium, the Warren Chapel Mortuary, the keeper's house, the office lodge, numerous mausolea, and both the 101st Street and 114th Street entrances (including a bridge over the Troy and Boston Railroad on Oakwood's western border to the 101st Street entrance). Boetcher incorporated exceptional landscape design techniques during his tenure; Oakwood developed shifting landscape scenery: some areas are dominated by flowing lawns while others comprise dense foliage.

The planted trees in the garden advanced over the time, so this part of the park is nowadays rich in the most significant and the oldest vegetation. Until the Second World War the area of the court complex on Terazije was enclosed. After the reconstruction done when the Second World War ended, the former court complex was conceived as the administrative federal and republic centre. Thereto, the fence around the complex was removed, as well as the court guard building and many utility buildings. One of the most important projects of this reconstruction was orienting the former court complex towards the National Assembly building, thus realizing the idea about the forming of the representative administrative centre. The redecoration of the court garden started after the design of the architect Aleksandar Đorđević, and finished after the design of the forestry engineer Vladeta Đorđević. The former court garden was named Pioneers` park. Today`s area around the Pioneers` park, which by origin belongs to the type of the residential parks, consists of three parts, different in concept: the part towards Kralja Aleksandra Boulevard, decorated in free style, the area between the courts with the fountain, and the green area in front of the Old Palace.|$|R

25|$|Since most {{conifers}} are evergreens, {{the leaves}} of many conifers are long, thin and have a needle-like appearance, but others, including most of the Cupressaceae {{and some of the}} Podocarpaceae, have flat, triangular scale-like leaves. Some, notably Agathis in Araucariaceae and Nageia in Podocarpaceae, have broad, flat strap-shaped leaves. Others such as Araucaria columnaris have leaves that are awl-shaped. In the majority of conifers, the leaves are arranged spirally, exceptions being most of Cupressaceae and one genus in Podocarpaceae, where they are arranged in decussate opposite pairs or whorls of 3 (-4). In many species with spirally arranged leaves, such as Abies grandis (pictured), the leaf bases are twisted to present the leaves in a very flat plane for maximum light capture. Leaf size varies from 2mm in many scale-leaved species, up to 400mm long in the needles of some pines (e.g. Apache Pine, Pinus engelmannii). The stomata are in lines or patches on the leaves, and can be closed when it is very dry or cold. The leaves are often dark green in colour, which may help absorb a maximum of energy from weak sunshine at high latitudes or under forest canopy shade. Conifers from hotter areas with high sunlight levels (e.g. Turkish Pine Pinus brutia) often have yellower-green leaves, while others (e.g. <b>blue</b> <b>spruce,</b> Picea pungens) have a very strong glaucous wax bloom to reflect ultraviolet light. In the great majority of genera the leaves are evergreen, usually remaining on the plant for several (2-40) years before falling, but five genera (Larix, Pseudolarix, Glyptostrobus, Metasequoia and Taxodium) are deciduous, shedding the leaves in autumn and leafless through the winter. The seedlings of many conifers, including most of the Cupressaceae, and Pinus in Pinaceae, have a distinct juvenile foliage period where the leaves are different, often markedly so, from the typical adult leaves.|$|E

5000|$|Spruce broom rust {{or yellow}} witches' broom rust is a fungal plant disease {{caused by the}} {{basidiomycete}} fungus known as Chrysomyxa arctosphyli. It occurs exclusively in North America, with the most concentrated outbreaks occurring in northern Arizona and southern Colorado on <b>blue</b> and Engelmann <b>spruce,</b> {{as well as in}} Alaska on black and white spruce. This disease alternates its life cycle between two hosts, with the spruce serving as the primary host and bearberry (also known as kinnickinnick) serving as the secondary or alternate host. The name for the disease comes from the distinctive “witches broom”, commonly yellow in color, which forms on the spruce after young needles have been infected. Management must be carried out through physical or mechanical methods, such as the pruning of brooms or the removal of the secondary host from the area, because no chemical control measures (e.g. fungicides) have yet been determined to be economically effective. Generally, spruce broom rust is seen as a mostly cosmetic issue, and it is very rarely the direct cause of tree death; however, research has shown a reduction in overall productivity and health of infected trees, making it an important issue for logging and timber companies.|$|R

These two species, the bobwhite and ruffed grouse, in 1970 were hunted in forty-seven states and eight provinces and are without question the most important of all North American upland game species (table 27). Although neither species was hunted during 1970 in Arizona or South Dakota, both have been legal game in South Dakota in recent years, and masked bobwhites originally occurred in southern Arizona, where they are now being restocked. In addition, the bobwhite occurs over much of Mexico and is an important game species in that country.

We class the watch among simple ornaments because, although it went-- very demonstratively too, with a loud self-asserting tick--its going was irregular and uncertain. Sometimes it went too slow without apparent cause. At other times it went too fast without provocation. Frequently it struck altogether, and only consented to resume work after a good deal of gentle and persuasive threatening to wind it the wrong way. It had chronic internal complaints, too, which produced sundry ominous clicks and sounds at certain periods of the day. These passed off, however, towards evening. Occasionally such sounds rushed as it were into a sudden whirr and series of convulsions, ending in a dead stop, which was an unmistakeable intimation to the Captain that something vital had given way; that the watch had gone into open mutiny, and nothing short of a visit to the watchmaker could restore it to life and duty.|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{describes}} {{the work done}} in connections with the following Physico-Chemical investigations of the Punjab soils:- PART-I AN EXAMINATION OF SOME OF THE FACTORS DETERMINING THE HYDROGEN-ION CONCENTRATION (PH) OF SUSPENSIONS OF PUNJAB SOILS. The variation in pH of soils has formed {{the subject of a}} number of investigations and as results suggestions have been put forward for the standardization of these determinations. Certain observations made in a series of soils in 1931 led to this work being undertaken to determine the variations and their causes that might be expected in Punjab soils. As results of this investigation it is shown that:- a) The glass electrode is best suited for the determination of pH of the Punjab soils b). The soil : water ratio has a very marked effect on the pH of soil suspensions. c). A variation in pH of soil suspensions is brought about on keeping them for any length of time. d). Bacterial activity, Manifested in soil suspensions on keeping, plays an important part in bringing about the variation in pH values. PART-II. THE CONDUCTOMETRIC METHODS OF ANALYSIS AS APPLIED TO SOIL SURVEY WORK: This part of the investigation deals with the utilization of the principles of conductometry in the chemical analysis of water extracts of soils. A simple apparatus to indicate the change in conductivity during titration is described. A comparison of the analytical results of water extracts of a large number soil samples, analysed both by the ordinary method and the conductometric method for chloride and sulphate contents, shows fair agreement. This method of analysis is shown to be useful in extensive soil survey work involving the analysis {{of a large number of}} soil samples. Paper III deals with this part of the work. PART-III. A STUDY OF THE SOIL PROFILES OF THE PUNJAB PLAINS WITH REFERENCE TO THE TYPE OF NATURAL VEGETATION:- During the soil survey of the uncultivated tracts of land for project purposes in the Punjab it was noticed that areas occurred where a particular type of natural flora was growing abundantly, the other type of vegetation being either absent altogether or present tin comparatively smaller number. In order, therefore, that information might be available which would be of assistance in future soil survey it was decided to examine, in more detail than was necessary for ordinary project work, the soils on which such dominant types soil profiles representing the following dominant types of natural vegetation. i. Wan (Salvadora oleoides) ii. Okan (Tamarix articulate) iii. Karai (capparis aphylla) iv. Jand (prosopis spicigera) v.

Soil profiles representing areas where there was no regeneration and where the regeneration was very abundant were examined. As a result of this part of the work 9 dealt in paper V) it was observed that the depth of A horizon and its organic matter content were factor responsible for regeneration of spruce. (ii). A number of soil profile under deodar, <b>spruce,</b> <b>blue</b> â€“pine and Chir were examined to investigate the special characteristics of soils bearing the above varieties of forest crops. Besides brining out the characteristics of soils under the various types of forest crops this work afforded information which was of interest in connection with the genetic classification of the Punjab Hill soils. As a further result of this investigation important differences were revealed in the podsol type of soils of the Kulu Hill area. The typical characteristics of the soils bearing the different forest types, the classification differences exhibited by the podsol type of soils of the Kulu Hill areas from podsol type met with in other parts of the world and the causes which led to these differences are all dealt with in paper VI PART-V. THE DISTRIBUTION OF SESQUIOXDIES, SILICA AND ORGANIC MATTER IN FOREST SOIL PROFILES OF THE KULU HILL AREA:- The distribution of silica, iron and aluminum oxides and organic matter in a number of soils profiles of the Kulu Hill area were examined.
