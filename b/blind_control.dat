40|$|Summary: We {{describe}} {{a study by}} which the establishment of assigned values of a control serum was simulated. The study covered two controls: The internal known control and a <b>blind</b> <b>control.</b> Seven constituents were analyzed in 10 or 11 laboratories, respectively, yielding a total of 72 sets of analytical values. Each set covered double determi-nations within approximately 18 series for each sample. The course of a <b>blind</b> <b>control</b> correlates better with the unknown sample for which assigned values are to be deter-mined than does a known control. Out of 72 sets 5 sets were found incorrect. Out of these, 2 sets could be recog-nized exclusively {{by means of the}} <b>blind</b> <b>control,</b> and 2 others primarily by means of the known control; one of these could be detected by means of the double determinations. Consequently, a <b>blind</b> <b>control</b> has a greater control efficiency than double determinations.

This paper identifies and compares five manual <b>blind</b> <b>control</b> algorithms with unique control patterns and reports blind occlusion, rate of change data, and annual building energy consumption. The <b>blind</b> <b>control</b> schemes detailed here represent five reasonable candidates for use in lighting and energy simulation based on difference driving factors. This study was performed on a medium-sized office building using EnergyPlus with the internal daylight harvesting engine. Results show that applying manual <b>blind</b> <b>control</b> algorithms affects the total annual consumption of the building {{by as much as}} 12. 5 % and 11. 5 % for interior and exterior blinds respectively, compared to the Always Retracted blinds algorithm.

30|$|For the {{subjective}} feeling of comfort, apart from thermal properties, the visual satisfaction is very important. A system {{taking into account}} exterior conditions can reduce the lighting necessities for rooms, thus saving energy. One possibility {{is to improve the}} situation by intelligent <b>blind</b> <b>control.</b> Aligning blinds according to the position of the sun can lead to an improved lighting situation inside a room. This condition can be measured by sensors (e.g., a luxmeter) {{in order to ensure that}} a certain luminosity is provided. The system can, for example, adjust the position of blind lamellae. If this action does not generate a sufficient light intensity, additional artificial lighting can be used to compensate the deficiency. However, it is always important to keep in mind that a user has a need for self-determination. In other words, the user does not like to be patronized by the system. Therefore, actions concerning <b>blind</b> <b>control</b> should preferably be performed when a room is unoccupied. Also in this use case, the weather condition provided by weather forecast services can be taken into account to assure visual comfort. This way reflections can be minimized and a room can be lightened according to its intended usage.|$|E

40|$|Among {{the various}} {{building}} envelope elements, the glass area {{takes up the}} largest portion in the office building design. However, a large area of glass can cause problems such as excessive solar radiation, thermal comfort, and glare. Thus {{it is important to}} install the glass area to an appropriate level, and control solar radiation and inflow of daylight with blind devices. This study aims to improve the visual performance of the work plane through the automatic control of the venetian blinds. A total of eight kinds of control strategies were chosen; Case 1 does not control the blinds, Case 2 with the blind slats fixed at the angle of 0 degree, Case 3 to 6 using the existing <b>blind</b> <b>control</b> programs, and Case 7 and 8 with improved <b>blind</b> <b>control.</b> Case 3 with 90 degrees had the best energy performance, but the average indoor illuminance was 113 lux, which is below the standards. Cases 4 and 5 showed higher levels of interior daylight illuminance with the average of 281 lux and 403 lux respectively. However, the fixed angles may have difficulties controlling excessive direct sunlight coming into the room and may cause glare. Cases 6 and 7 used sun tracking angle control and cut-off angle control, and the average interior illuminance was measured 250 lux and 385 lux respectively. Case 8 used the cut-off angle control in an hourly manner, satisfying the standard illuminance of 400 lux with an average interior illuminance of 561 lux.
