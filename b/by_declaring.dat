5|$|Danish {{zoologist}} and mineralogist Morten Thrane Brünnich {{first described}} the common loon in 1764, as Colymbus immer in his Ornithologia Borealis. The now-defunct genus Colymbus contained grebes {{as well as}} loons, and remained in use until the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature attempted to clarify the nomenclature in 1956 <b>by</b> <b>declaring</b> Colymbus a suppressed name unfit for further use and establishing Gavia, created by Johann Reinhold Forster in 1788, as the valid genus name for the loons.|$|E
5|$|Great Britain {{had broken}} the Peace of Amiens <b>by</b> <b>declaring</b> war on France in May 1803.

5|$|Following the French Revolution of 1789 {{relations}} between the newly declared French Republic and its European neighbours sharply deteriorated. In April 1791, the Declaration of Pillnitz was jointly issued by the Austria and Prussia stating their support for King Louis XVI. In February 1792 Austria and Prussia formally allied and the French Legislative Assembly responded on 20 April 1792 <b>by</b> <b>declaring</b> war on Austria. This first conflict, known as the War of the First Coalition, began on land as other than France the principal European seapowers remained neutral. The arrest of the French king in August 1792 {{and the expansion of}} the war into Northern Italy brought about the start of the naval war in the Mediterranean Sea.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, the University punished itself when {{it became}} {{apparent}} that its players were guilty <b>by</b> <b>declaring</b> itself ineligible for post season play immediately, returning post season play monetary rewards, vacating five seasons of games, removing commemorative banners, and placing itself on a two-year probation. The following year, the NCAA accepted these punishments, doubled both the probation period and the post-season ineligibility, penalized the school one scholarship for four seasons, and ordered disassociation from the four guilty players until 2012. The disasociation formally ended on May 8, 2013. The additional year of post-season ineligibility was overturned on appeal.|$|E
5|$|In Mackay's account, the panicked tulip speculators {{sought help}} from the {{government}} of the Netherlands, which responded <b>by</b> <b>declaring</b> that anyone who had bought contracts to purchase bulbs in the future could void their contract by payment of a 10 percent fee. Attempts were made to resolve the situation to the satisfaction of all parties, but these were unsuccessful. The mania finally ended, Mackay says, with individuals stuck with the bulbs they held {{at the end of the}} crash—no court would enforce payment of a contract, since judges regarded the debts as contracted through gambling, and thus not enforceable by law.|$|E

5|$|In September 1939, the {{authority}} of the SS expanded further when the senior SS officer in each military district also became its chief of police. Most of these SS and police leaders held the rank of SS-Gruppenführer or above, and answered directly to Himmler in all SS matters within their district. Their role was to police the population and oversee the activities of the SS men within their district. <b>By</b> <b>declaring</b> an emergency, they could bypass the district administrative offices for the SS, SD, SiPo, SS-Totenkopfverbände (SS-TV; concentration camp guards), and Orpo, thereby gaining direct operational control of these groups.|$|E
5|$|In the 1830s the French {{controlled}} {{only the}} northern part of the country. Entering the Oran region, they faced resistance from Emir Abd al-Kader, a leader of a Sufi Brotherhood. In 1839 Abd al-Kader began a seven-year war <b>by</b> <b>declaring</b> jihad against the French. The French signed two peace treaties with al-Kader, but they were broken because of a miscommunication between the military and the Parisian government. In response to the breaking of the second treaty, Abd al-Kader drove the French to the coast. In reply, a force of nearly 100,000troops marched to the Algerian countryside and forced Abd al-Kader's surrender in 1847.|$|E
5|$|In the {{immediate}} month leading up the coup, Khánh's leadership had become increasingly troubled. He {{had tried to}} augment his powers <b>by</b> <b>declaring</b> a state of emergency, but this only provoked large-scale protests and riots calling {{for an end to}} military rule, with Buddhist activists at the forefront. Fearful of losing power, Khánh began making concessions to the protesters and promised democracy in the near future. He also removed several military officials closely linked to the discriminatory Catholic rule of the slain former President Ngô Đình Diệm; this response to Buddhist pressure dismayed several Catholic officers, who made a few abortive moves to remove him from power.|$|E

At {{the end of the}} 1932 fiscal year, figures showed that the state incurred a $2 million deficit. Kentucky was also unable to secure significant financial assistance under President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal because the state was often unable to raise the required matching funds.|$|E

5|$|Six {{months after}} the NFLPA {{declared}} itself an independent union, many players were dissatisfied {{with the lack of}} compensation teams provided and voted to strike on July 3, 1968 after official discussions with the owners stalled. The owners countered <b>by</b> <b>declaring</b> a lockout. By July 14, 1968, the brief work stoppage came to an end. Although a CBA resulted, many players felt that the agreement did not net them as many benefits as they had hoped. The owners agreed to contribute about $1.5 million to the pension fund with minimum salaries of $9,000 for rookies, $10,000 for veterans and $50 per exhibition game; there was at yet no neutral arbitration for disputes.|$|E

5|$|Stephen found {{fault with}} Symeon {{especially}} for his charismatic approach, and {{his support of}} individual direct experience of God's grace. Symeon believed that direct experience gave monks the authority to preach and give absolution of sins, {{without the need for}} formal ordination—as practiced by his own teacher, Symeon the Studite. Church authorities also taught from a speculative and philosophical perspective, while Symeon taught from his own direct mystical experience. Symeon's teachings, especially those regarding the direct experience of God's grace, brought accusations of heresy from Stephen. Symeon responded to Stephen's charges <b>by</b> <b>declaring</b> that the real heresy was to teach {{that it is impossible to}} have direct experience of God (Disc. 29.4).|$|E
5|$|The Iazyges and Carpi raided Roman {{territory}} in 293, and Diocletian {{responded to this}} <b>by</b> <b>declaring</b> war. From 294 to 295 Diocletian waged war upon them, and won.

In 358 it is recorded that the Iazyges were at war with Rome. Later on, in 375, Emperor Valentinian had a stroke in Brigetio, while meeting with envoys from the Iazyges.|$|E
5|$|The Nawab of Junagadh, a princely state {{located on}} the {{south-western}} end of Gujarat and having no common border with Pakistan, chose to accede to Pakistan ignoring Mountbatten's views, arguing {{that it could be}} reached from Pakistan by sea. The rulers of two states that were subject to the suzerainty of Junagadh—Mangrol and Babariawad—reacted to this <b>by</b> <b>declaring</b> their independence from Junagadh and acceding to India. In response, the Nawab of Junagadh militarily occupied the states. The rulers of neighbouring states reacted angrily, sending their troops to the Junagadh frontier and appealed to the Government of India for assistance. A group of Junagadhi people, led by Samaldas Gandhi, formed a government-in-exile, the Aarzi Hukumat ("temporary government").|$|E
