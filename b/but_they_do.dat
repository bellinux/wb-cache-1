5|$|Next, the metamorphosed Precambrian {{basement}} rocks were uplifted and {{a nearly}} 500-million-year-long {{gap in the}} geologic record, a major unconformity, affected the region. Geologists {{do not know what}} happened to the eroded sediment that must have overlain the complex, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> know that regional uplift was responsible; the area was originally below the surface of a shallow sea.|$|E
5|$|The mammary glands {{of mammals}} are {{specialized}} to produce milk, {{the primary source}} of nutrition for newborns. The monotremes branched early from other mammals and do not have the nipples seen in most mammals, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> have mammary glands. The young lick the milk from a mammary patch on the mother's belly.|$|E
5|$|Baleen whales have a small, yet functional, vomeronasal organ. This allows baleen whales {{to detect}} {{chemicals}} and pheromones released by their prey. It {{is thought that}} 'tasting' the water is important for finding prey and tracking down other whales. They {{are believed to have}} an impaired sense of smell {{due to the lack of}} the olfactory bulb, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> have an olfactory tract. Baleen whales have few if any taste buds, suggesting they have lost their sense of taste. They do retain salt-receptor taste-buds suggesting that they can taste saltiness.|$|E

5|$|Cockatoos are {{not wholly}} migratory, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> exhibit regular {{seasonal}} movements {{in different parts}} of Australia. In the northern parts of the Northern Territory, they largely leave areas of high humidity in the summer wet season. In {{other parts of the country}} cockatoo seasonal movements tend to follow food sources, a pattern recorded in Northern Queensland, and New South Wales. In southwest Western Australia, both extant subspecies appear to have a north-south pattern; northwards after breeding in the case of subspecies naso, while movements by subspecies samueli in the wheatbelt can be irregular and unrelated to the seasons.|$|E
5|$|David Kinsley, {{an expert}} on Hindu goddesses and former Professor of Religion at McMaster University, agrees with the Buddhist origin theory, but sees other influences, too. Ancient Hindu goddesses, who are {{depicted}} nude and headless or faceless, may have also influenced the development of Chhinnamasta. These goddesses are mainly depicted headless {{to focus on the}} display of their sexual organs, thus signifying sexual vigour, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not explain the self-decapitation theme.|$|E
5|$|In fact, Squall and {{the heroes}} do help Ultimecia start Time Compression, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> so to confront {{her in her}} own time. After Squall and his party defeat Sorceress Adel, Adel {{transfers}} her power to Rinoa, then Ultimecia possesses Rinoa again, and Ellone uses her power to send their consciousness to the past, at which point Ultimecia starts Time Compression. At that moment, the heroes are able to travel to Ultimecia's distant future and defeat her. After the final battle, the defeated Ultimecia transfers her powers to Edea.|$|E

5|$|River otters {{are active}} year-round, and are most active {{at night and}} during crepuscular hours. They become much more nocturnal in the spring, summer, and fall seasons, and more diurnal during winter. They may migrate {{as a result of}} food {{shortages}} or environmental conditions, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not migrate annually. River otters only settle in areas that consist of vegetation, rock piles, and sufficient coverage.|$|E
5|$|The Emerging and Voluntary Measures Policy {{allows a}} state to add {{unconventional}} forms of heat island mitigation. This can include removing pollution after {{it has already been}} emitted into air, water, or soil. These measures are not implemented into law, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> make it possible for certain parties to voluntarily become more efficient. The purpose of this policy is for all polluting sources to follow by example and use the most successful forms of mitigation.|$|E
5|$|The Roman {{soldiers}} {{break the}} two thieves' legs (a procedure designed to hasten {{death in a}} crucifixion), <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not break those of Jesus, as he is already dead (John 19:33). In , one soldier pierces Jesus' side with a lance, and blood and water flow out. In the Synoptics, when Jesus dies, the heavy curtain at the Temple is torn. In , an earthquake breaks open tombs. In Matthew and Mark, terrified by the events, a Roman centurion states that Jesus was the Son of God.|$|E

5|$|There are {{situations}} in which it may seem that matter, energy, or information travels at speeds greater thanc, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not. For example, as is discussed in the propagation of light in a medium section below, many wave velocities can exceed c. For example, the phase velocity of X-rays through most glasses can routinely exceed c, but phase velocity does not determine the velocity at which waves convey information.|$|E
5|$|There is {{one final}} {{intersection}} with NY32, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not become concurrent and US4 {{heads to the}} northeast. The route passes through Kingsbury and soon after, becomes concurrent with NY149. The two routes head into Fort Ann, where they split, with NY149 heading westward. After passing Battle Hill, NY22 merges in from Comstock. There are several hills before the intersection where the two roads split in Whitehall. US4 continues along its final stretch after NY22, passing fields and such to the state line, where it continues into Vermont.|$|E
5|$|According to Kuhn, {{science is}} an {{inherently}} communal activity {{which can only}} be done as part of a community. For him, the fundamental difference between science and other disciplines {{is the way in which}} the communities function. Others, especially Feyerabend and some post-modernist thinkers, have argued that there is insufficient difference between social practices in science and other disciplines to maintain this distinction. For them, social factors play an important and direct role in scientific method, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not serve to differentiate science from other disciplines. On this account, science is socially constructed, though this does not necessarily imply the more radical notion that reality itself is a social construct.|$|E

5|$|COBOL {{supports}} three file formats, or : sequential, indexed and relative. In sequential files, {{records are}} contiguous {{and must be}} traversed sequentially, similarly to a linked list. Indexed files have one or more indexes which allow records to be randomly accessed and which can be sorted on them. Each record must have a unique key, but other, , record keys need not be unique. Implementations of indexed files vary between vendors, although common implementations, such as C‑ISAM and VSAM, are based on IBM's ISAM. Relative files, like indexed files, have a unique record key, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not have alternate keys. A relative record's key is its ordinal position; for example, the 10th record has a key of 10. This means that creating a record with a key of 5 may require the creation of (empty) preceding records. Relative files also allow for both sequential and random access.|$|E
5|$|Current {{official}} transit {{maps of the}} New York City Subway {{are based}} on a 1979 design by Michael Hertz Associates. The maps are not geographically accurate due to the complexity of the system (i.e. Manhattan being the smallest borough, but having the most services), <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> show major city streets as an aid to navigation. The newest edition took effect on June 27, 2010, and makes Manhattan bigger and Staten Island smaller. Earlier diagrams of the subway (the first being produced in 1958), while being more aesthetically pleasing, had the perception of being more geographically inaccurate than the diagrams today. The design of the subway map by Massimo Vignelli, published by the MTA between 1972 and 1979, has become a modern classic but the MTA deemed the map flawed due to its placement of geographical elements.|$|E
5|$|In {{keeping with}} their history, the Churches of Christ claim the New Testament as their sole rule {{of faith and}} {{practice}} in deciding matters of doctrine and ecclesiastical structure. They view the Old Testament as divinely inspired and historically accurate, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not consider its laws to be binding under the New Covenant in Christ (unless they are repeated in the New Testament) (Hebrews 8: 7-13). They believe that the New Testament demonstrates how a person may become a Christian (and thus {{a part of the}} universal Church of Christ) and how a church should be collectively organized and carry out its scriptural purposes.|$|E
