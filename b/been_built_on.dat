5|$|A {{public house}} has <b>been</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> the island between Keynsham Lock and the weir. The weir {{side of the}} island is also the mouth of the River Chew.|$|E
5|$|Despite problems, the Deutsche Reichsbahn made {{improvements}} to the line and reconstructed at great expense the Westkreuz railway station which had <b>been</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> swamp land.|$|E
5|$|It {{seems to}} have <b>been</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> older foundations. The main {{improvement}} made by the Portuguese was to construct a gun deck looking over the harbor.|$|E
50|$|WZT (Wóz Zabezpieczenia Technicznego - {{armoured}} {{recovery vehicle}}) was a Polish post-World War II {{armoured recovery vehicle}} series. It consists of five versions.The first two, WZT-1 and WZT-2 <b>were</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> T-55/T-55A hull, the WZT-3 <b>was</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> T-72M hull, the WZT-3M <b>was</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> PT-91 hull and the WZT-4 <b>was</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> PT-91M hull for Malaysia.|$|R
50|$|Between 1723 and 1733, Fort Manoel <b>was</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> Manoel Island, while Fort Tigné <b>was</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> Tigné Point in 1793. British barracks <b>were</b> also <b>built</b> <b>on</b> Tigné Point, {{but these}} {{have since been}} demolished.|$|R
50|$|During the 1930s, {{new housing}} <b>was</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> Patchway Estate, {{just north of}} Filton Aerodrome, and {{bungalows}} <b>were</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> Stoke Lane.|$|R
5|$|Runway 8/26 on Blue Grass Airport {{was closed}} on March 2009, {{and the new}} 4000 foot runway, runway 9/27, opened on August 4, 2010. This runway has <b>been</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> a {{separate}} location not connected to the runway 22.|$|E
5|$|A lack of {{preparation}} for the disaster contributed to the high death toll. Armero had <b>been</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> an alluvial fan that had been overrun by historic mudflows; authorities had ignored a hazard-zone map that showed the potential damage to the town from lahars. Residents stayed inside their dwellings to avoid the falling ash, as local officials had instructed them to do, not thinking {{that they might be}} buried by the mudflows.|$|E
5|$|Clegg Hall is a 17th century {{hall and}} Grade II* listed {{building}} situated in green space between Milnrow, Rochdale and Littleborough. It {{was constructed in}} about 1610 for Theophilus Aston and may have <b>been</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> {{the site of a}} mediaeval house and inn.|$|E
50|$|The Birchwood Estate <b>was</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> the {{airfield}} in the 1970s, and the A46 Lincoln Bypass <b>was</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> it in 1986.|$|R

5|$|In Autumn 2011 {{construction}} began of a Tesco Extra 24-hour store. The glass fronted 120,000 sq ft {{store has}} <b>been</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> the old B site next to Ashley Way and was opened in March 2012. The store {{was built on}} stilts allowing a car park to be built underneath the store for around 600 cars.|$|E
5|$|Structure 9 {{is a large}} mound on the {{northwest}} side of Plaza 1. The last phase of construction shows evidence of the interruption of construction by the Spanish Conquest. Terraces were absent on three sides of the structure with only the lowest level having <b>been</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> the fourth. Early Classic ceramic caches were discovered under Structure 9.|$|E
5|$|The Galveston Bay Area {{is located}} on the gulf coastal plain, and its {{vegetation}} is classified as temperate grassland and marshes. The municipalities have <b>been</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> reclaimed marshes, swamps, and prairies, which are all still visible in undeveloped areas.Eubanks (2006), p. 10.|$|E

5|$|The {{majority}} of {{houses in the}} village were built between the 17th and late 19th centuries, including examples of Victorian Gothic architecture. Only one house has <b>been</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> the village's main street since the early 20th century. The parish hall, built in 1897, is predominantly flint and brick.|$|E
5|$|The {{temple was}} {{discovered}} {{by a team of}} archaeologists from the ASI based on clues found in a rock inscription left exposed by the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. Initially, excavations revealed an 8th-century Pallava-era shrine. Further excavations revealed that the 8th-century shrine had <b>been</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> the brick foundation of an earlier shrine. The brick shrine has been dated to the Sangam period.|$|E
5|$|To {{the east}} of the village, Felin Uchaf is an {{educational}} centre exploring ways of living and working in partnership with the environment. Developed on a redundant farm, it provides residential courses in rural skills and sustainable agriculture. A traditional Iron Age roundhouse has <b>been</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> the site.|$|E
50|$|William Casselberry House <b>was</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> Germantown Pike around 1872. Comparable to the A. Everhart Casselberry stone house, it <b>was</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> Glebe lands by Abraham Everhart between 1844 and 1857.|$|R
5000|$|It <b>was</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> {{the churchyard}} {{of the former}} All-Hallows-the-Great on Upper Thames Street (A3211). It <b>was</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> a 2.5 acre site. It cost £18m, with £11m for the {{telecommunications}} equipment.|$|R
50|$|Phillips {{suggests}} that American greatness in the 20th century <b>was</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> oil, much as British greatness in the 19th century <b>was</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> coal, and Dutch greatness before that <b>was</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> {{wind and water}} power. When these energy sources became scarce or were replaced with a new source, argues Phillips, these countries lost their greatness to {{the master of the}} new energy source.|$|R
5|$|A {{number of}} statues and {{memorials}} have <b>been</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> and around Whitehall, commemorating military victories and leaders. The Cenotaph {{was designed by}} Sir Edwin Lutyens and erected {{at the southern end}} in 1919, commemorating victory in World War I and later used as a memorial for both World Wars. It is the main war memorial in Britain and an annual service is held here on Remembrance Sunday, led by the reigning monarch and leading politicians. In 2005 a national Monument to the Women of World War II was erected a short distance north of the Cenotaph {{in the middle of the}} Whitehall carriageway.|$|E
5|$|After closure, {{the line}} was largely forgotten. Because it had <b>been</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> private land without an Act of Parliament, few records of it prior to the Oxford {{extension}} schemes exist in official archives. At {{least some of the}} rails remained in place in 1940, as records exist of their removal during the building of RAF Westcott. Other than the station buildings at Westcott and Quainton Road almost nothing survives of the tramway, although much of the route can still be traced by a double line of hedges. The former trackbed between Quainton Road and Waddesdon Road is now a public footpath known as the Tramway Walk.|$|E
5|$|Fossils of a {{range of}} animals have been found {{including}} the Pleistocene lion (Felis leo spelæ), Cave hyena (Crocuta crocuta spelaea) and Badger (Meles meles). Wookey Hole was occupied by humans in the Iron Age, possibly around 250-300 BC, while nearby Hyena Cave was occupied by Stone Age hunters. Badger Hole and Rhinoceros Hole are two dry caves on the slopes above the Wookey ravine near the Wookey Hole resurgence and contain in situ cave sediments laid down during the Ice Age. Just outside the cave the foundations of a 1st-century hut have been identified. These had <b>been</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> during the Roman era up {{to the end of the}} 4th century.|$|E
50|$|In 1949 Sheikh Badr was {{incorporated}} into a larger area renamed Givat Ram. The Hebrew University of Jerusalem at Givat Ram, the Supreme Court of Israel, and the Jerusalem International Convention Center <b>were</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> land formerly belonging to the village. Claims that the Israeli Knesset <b>was</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> land belonging to the village are erroneous; the Knesset <b>was</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> land leased from the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem.|$|R

5|$|From January until May, the Parrett {{provides}} {{a source of}} European eels (Anguilla anguilla) and young elvers, which are caught by hand netting as {{this is the only}} legal means of catching them. A series of eel passes have <b>been</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> the Parrett at the King's Sedgemoor Drain to help this endangered species; cameras have shown 10,000 eels migrating upstream in a single night. The 2003 BBC Radio 4 play Glass Eels by Nell Leyshon was set on the Parrett.|$|E
5|$|From their commissioning, Alabama and Illinois {{served with}} the North Atlantic Squadron. Both ships made visits to Europe during their early careers, and Illinois served as the {{flagship}} of the European Squadron {{for a short time}} in 1902. She accidentally ran aground outside Oslo, Norway, in 1902 and returned to the North Atlantic Squadron in January 1903. Wisconsin, having <b>been</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> the west coast of the United States, instead served in the Pacific Fleet as its flagship. In 1903, she was transferred to the Asiatic Fleet, and remained there until late 1906 when she returned to California.|$|E
5|$|In 1818 a {{golf course}} was founded on the moor for the Manchester Golf Club, a group of Manchester businessmen, {{some of whom had}} emigrated from Scotland. This was only the second course to be built outside Scotland. The course at that time {{consisted}} of only five holes and had no fairways or greens as the players had to share the ground with other users. The club was very exclusive and by 1825 a club house had <b>been</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> Singleton Road. By 1869 the course had increased to nine holes and the club continued playing on the moor until 1862 when a new course was built a few hundred yards away at Kersal Vale.|$|E
50|$|A Wesleyan Methodist chapel <b>was</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> Manchester Road, Martinscroft, in 1827 and {{demolished}} by the New Town Corporation in 1977. A modern replacement, St Martin's Church, <b>was</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> Gig Lane, Woolston in 1975.|$|R
