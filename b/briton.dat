5|$|At <b>Briton</b> Ferry, {{the canal}} ends under the M4 {{motorway}} at a scrapyard, {{but there are}} plans to refurbish Brunel's <b>Briton</b> Ferry dock, just to the south, and a short extension to it would provide a good terminus. In Neath itself, a masterplan for the Canal Green area, developing both the river frontage and canal sides, {{has the potential to}} provide a canal basin and moorings for Neath.|$|E

5000|$|According to a 2008 poll, 85% of <b>Britons</b> {{have only}} opposite-sex sexual contact while only 94% of <b>Britons</b> {{identify}} themselves as heterosexual. Similarly, {{a survey by the}} UK Office for National Statistics (ONS) in 2010 found that 95% of <b>Britons</b> identified as heterosexual, 1.5% of <b>Britons</b> identified themselves as homosexual or bisexual, and the last 3.5% gave more vague answers such as [...] "don't know", [...] "other", or did not respond to the question.|$|R
5|$|<b>Briton</b> was {{the first}} of the trio to be {{commissioned}} and was assigned to the East Indies Station in 1871. She remained there for four and a half years, mostly engaged on the suppression of the slave trade. The ship was refitted and rearmed upon her return home and <b>Briton</b> remained in reserve until recommissioned in 1881 for service on the Cape Station. She was transferred back to the East Indies after two years on the Cape. Her crew was relieved in 1884 by another sent out from Britain and the ship remained on station until she was sold, less her armament, in Bombay in 1887.|$|E

5000|$|There {{have been}} noticeably fewer native <b>Britons</b> emigrating to Hong Kong since the handover. During British Hong Kong era, <b>Britons</b> wishing {{to live and}} work in Hong Kong were not subject to the {{immigration}} and visa restrictions that would apply today. It was common for young <b>Britons</b> to go to Hong Kong to work in blue-collar occupations, particularly during economic downturns in Britain. This advantage ended with the handover: <b>Britons</b> applying for permission to work in Hong Kong must now prove they will have jobs that cannot be filled by local residents, which means blue-collar jobs in Hong Kong (e.g., in retail or construction) are for the most part no longer an option for <b>Britons.</b>|$|R

Murray then reached the semifinals of the boys' French Open, where he lost in straight sets to Marin Čilić.|$|E

Tom Aggar matched her success with victory in the men's single sculls. A bronze medal for the mixed coxed four crew meant that GB won more medals in the sport than any other nation and topped the rowing medal table.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{many parts}} of South Africa, {{conflict}} was an element largely absent from Jan Smuts's early life. Whether conflict between <b>Briton</b> and Boer, or conflict between Black and White — it had been many years since the farmers of the Swartland had {{had to deal with}} turmoil on their doorsteps. The absence of conflict, along with its inevitable counterpart, development of prejudice, had its effect upon Smuts.|$|E
5000|$|In 2003, Burchill {{was ranked}} number 85 in Channel 4's poll of 100 Worst <b>Britons.</b> The poll was {{inspired}} by the BBC series 100 Greatest <b>Britons,</b> though it was less serious in nature. The aim was to discover the [...] "100 worst <b>Britons</b> we love to hate". The poll specified that the nominees had to be British, alive and not currently in prison or pending trial.|$|R

5|$|After the battle, {{the ship}} was reassigned to the 2nd Battle Squadron, and had been {{transferred}} to the 8th Light Cruiser Squadron in the Adriatic by December.

The ship was placed in reserve the following April, listed for disposal in March 1920 and was sold for scrap on 9 May 1921 to Thos W Ward, of Portishead and <b>Briton</b> Ferry.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{was found}} {{shattered}} into thousands of pieces and is now heavily corroded, the helmet still bears evidence of its original finely decorated design. It was plated with silver-gilt and decorated with images of goddesses and equestrian scenes. It would {{have been used by}} a Roman auxiliary cavalryman for displays and possibly in battle. The identity of the owner is not known but the helmet was discovered on a native British ceremonial site, buried alongside thousands of Iron Age British and Roman coins. It is possible that the helmet was owned by a <b>Briton</b> who fought alongside the Romans during the conquest of Britain.|$|E
5|$|Britain sent eight {{athletes to}} compete in the {{bobsleigh}} events with entries in the two-man, four-man and two-woman competitions.

5|$|Chambers' coach Mike McFarlane {{struggled}} with the workload of full-time training. Frustrated by the distance {{between himself and the}} top sprinters, Chambers decided to relocate to California to work with Ukrainian coach Remi Korchemny and nutritionist Victor Conte. After parting ways with American sprinter Tim Montgomery, Conte looked to Chambers to fill the athlete's berth. In the run up to the year's major events, Chambers was in fine form and recorded a 200m personal best of 20.27s in Athens on 10 June 2002. Montgomery, impressed by Chambers' training regime, tipped the <b>Briton</b> to win the gold at the forthcoming 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester, England.|$|E

25|$|One theory, {{first set}} out by Edward Augustus Freeman, {{suggests}} that the Anglo Saxons and the <b>Britons</b> were competing cultures, and that through invasion, extermination, slavery, and forced resettlement the Anglo-Saxons defeated the <b>Britons</b> and consequently their culture and language prevailed.|$|R
