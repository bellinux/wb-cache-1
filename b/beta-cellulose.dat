The structure of the fibre inter-converts from an alpha- and <b>beta-cellulose</b> mixture to a thermodynamically favourable cellulose II polymorph. In alpha- and <b>beta-cellulose</b> the polysaccharide chains are stabilized by intra-molecular hydrogen bonds {{as well as by}} hydrogen bonds within polysaccharide layers. Between layers only van der Waals forces are in effect. In contrast the crystal structure of cellulose II has also hydrogen bonds between the layers.|$|E

The process was devised in 1844 by John Mercer of Great Harwood, Lancashire, who treated cotton fibres with sodium hydroxide. The treatment caused the fibres to swell, which in Mercer's version of the process shrunk the overall fabric size and made it stronger and easier to dye. In 1890 H. A. Lowe held the yarn under tension during treatment. This prevented shrinking and gave the yarn or resulting fabric a lustrous appearance.Mercerisation alters the chemical structure of the fibre,inter-convertings from alpha-cellulose to a thermodynamically more favorable <b>beta-cellulose</b> polymorph thus swelling of the cell wall. This increases the surface area and reflectance, and gives the fibre a softer feel.|$|E
