5|$|Cited as an {{influential}} {{title in the}} video game industry {{and one of the}} best games of all time, Shadow of the Colossus is often regarded as an important example of video game as art due to its minimalist landscape designs, immersive gameplay and emotional journey. It received wide critical acclaim <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>and</b> was met with strong sales compared to Ico, due in part to a larger marketing campaign. The soundtrack was also widely praised. The game won several awards for its audio, design, and overall quality. Shadow of the Colossus is also referenced numerous times in debates regarding the art quality and emotional perspectives of video games.

5|$|From 2004 until 2007, Asashōryū was sumo's sole yokozuna, and {{was criticized}} at times <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>and</b> the Japan Sumo Association for not {{upholding}} {{the standards of}} behaviour expected of a holder of such a prestigious rank. He became the first yokozuna in history to be suspended from competition in August 2007 when he participated in a charity soccer match in his home country despite having withdrawn from a regional sumo tour claiming injury. After a career filled with a multitude of other controversies, {{both on and off}} the dohyō, his career was cut short when he retired from sumo in February 2010 after allegations that he assaulted a man outside a Tokyo nightclub.|$|E

Service was resumed at the direction of Sound Transit CEO Peter Rogoff, and the following week Sound Transit and King County Metro formalized a new protocol requiring future requests from law enforcement to suspend service be approved by the CEO or general manager.|$|E

5|$|The Giants regressed to an 8–8 {{record in}} 2006. The season was {{characterized}} by inconsistent play, criticism of the coaching <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>and</b> players, and Manning's struggles. They won five straight following a 1–2 start, giving them a two-game lead in the NFC East, but they lost six of their last seven games, and the players publicly clashed with Coughlin. One of the team's worst losses was a 24–21 defeat to Tennessee, in which the team surrendered a 21-point 4th-quarter lead. Following a season-ending win at Washington, the Giants made the playoffs as a wild card {{in spite of their}} record, but were defeated 23–20 by Philadelphia.|$|E

5|$|Up {{to the end}} of the 2016–17 posting period, 22NPB {{players had}} been posted using the system. Of these, 12signed Major League contracts, three signed minor league contracts, five were {{unsuccessful}} in attracting any MLB interest, and two could not come to a contract agreement during the 30-day negotiation period. The four highest-profile players that have been acquired by MLB teams through the posting system are Ichiro Suzuki, Daisuke Matsuzaka, Yu Darvish, and Masahiro Tanaka. The first three attracted high bids of $13.125million, $51.1million, and $51.7million respectively. Tanaka was the first player posted under the current procedure; he was posted for the maximum $20million allowed under the new rules. However, since its implementation the posting system has been criticized <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>and</b> baseball insiders from both countries.|$|E
5|$|A style more melodic {{and more}} akin to the hard rock of bands like Rainbow, Magnum, UFO, Thin Lizzy and Whitesnake was equally {{represented}} during the NWOBHM. The music of Def Leppard, Praying Mantis, White Spirit, Demon, Shy, Gaskin, Dedringer and many others, contained hooks as much as riffs, often retained a closer link with blues rock, included power ballads and featured keyboards, acoustic instruments and melodic and soaring vocals. After {{the peak of the}} movement in 1981, this style was favoured <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>and</b> gained greater acceptance among the British audience; it became prevalent when bands usually playing the more aggressive style of metal adapted to the more popular sound, which resembled that of mainstream American acts. These changes in musical direction disoriented some fans and led them to reject those bands which were perceived as having compromised key elements of their musical identity in the pursuit of success.|$|E
5|$|During the 2010–11 season, Bieksa's {{offensive}} production decreased, {{but he was}} lauded <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>and</b> Head Coach Alain Vigneault {{for improving}} his defensive game. He had been criticized at {{times in the past}} for making risk/reward plays that resulted in scoring chances for the opposing team, but his play improved to become more responsible in the defensive zone. In February 2011, he suffered a 2nd fractured bone in his foot. Playing in a game against the Minnesota Wild, Bieksa sustained the injury while blocking a shot. While he finished the game and initial x-rays came back negative, a subsequent CT-scan revealed the fracture. He became the sixth Canucks defenceman injured at the time. After missing 15 games, he returned to the line-up in late-March. Playing on a shutdown defensive pairing with Dan Hamhuis, his season-ending +32 plus-minus established a personal best and ranked second in the NHL, one point behind Boston Bruins defenceman Zdeno Chára. Complementing his strong defensive play, he recorded six goals and 22 points in 66 games.|$|E

5|$|The {{incident}} occurred {{during a period}} of popular unrest by the Buddhist majority against the Roman Catholic rule of Diệm. Buddhist discontent had grown since the Huế Phật Đản shootings on May 8, 1963. The government decided to selectively invoke a law, prohibiting the display of religious flags, by banning the use of the Buddhist flag on Vesak, the birthday of Gautama Buddha. One week earlier, the Vatican flag had been flown at a celebration for Archbishop Ngô Đình Thục, Diệm's brother. The Buddhists defied the ban, flying their flags on Vesak and holding a demonstration, which was ended with government gunfire and eight deaths. The killings sparked nationwide protests by South Vietnam's Buddhist majority against the policies of Diệm's regime. The Buddhists demanded that Diệm give them religious equality, but with their demands unfulfilled, the protests increased in magnitude. The most notable of these was the self-immolation of Thích Quảng Đức on June 11, which was iconically photographed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>and</b> became a negative symbol of the Diệm régime.|$|E
5|$|Valbuena's next call-up {{was over}} two years later in May 2010, when he {{was named to the}} 30-man {{preliminary}} list by Domenech to play in the 2010 FIFA World Cup. Valbuena's call up was considered surprising <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>and</b> the player himself, despite Valbuena playing well with his parent club who won the league and league cup double in the 2009–10 season. Many journalists in the French media compared Valbuena's call-up to the team with Franck Ribéry's call-up four years previously, as the two players share similarities in playing style and their circumstances {{at the time of their}} respective call-ups. Valbuena was later named to the 23-man team to compete in the competition. He made his national team debut on 26 May 2010 in a friendly match against Costa Rica appearing as a substitute in the second half. After 16 minutes on the field, Valbuena scored the game-winning goal in the team's 2–1 victory. At the World Cup, Valbuena made his debut in the competition in the team's 2–0 loss to Mexico appearing as a substitute on 17 June. It was his only appearance in the competition. During the competition, the players went on strike in protest over the expulsion of striker Nicolas Anelka from the team, which resulted in all 23 players on the team being suspended for its friendly match in August 2010.|$|E
