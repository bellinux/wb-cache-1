5|$|Economists became {{interested}} in hysteresis when unemployment levels spiked with the 1979 oil shock and early 1980s recessions but {{did not return to}} the lower levels that had been considered the natural rate. Olivier Blanchard and Lawrence Summers (1986) explained hysteresis in unemployment with insider-outsider models, which were also proposed <b>by</b> <b>of</b> Assar Lindbeck and Dennis Snower in a series of papers and then a book. Insiders, employees already working at a firm, are only concerned about their own welfare. They would rather keep their wages high than cut pay and expand employment. The unemployed, outsiders, do not have any voice in the wage bargaining process, so their interests are not represented. When unemployment increases, the number of outsiders increases as well. Even after the economy has recovered, outsiders continue to be disenfranchised from the bargaining process. The larger pool of outsiders created by periods of economic retraction can lead to persistently higher levels of unemployment. The presence of hysteresis in the labor market also raises the importance of monetary and fiscal policy. If temporary downturns in the economy can create long term increases in unemployment, stabilization policies do more than provide temporary relief; they prevent short term shocks from becoming long term increases in unemployment.|$|E

25|$|Graz. The name Graz implies {{an early}} Slavic {{settlement}} {{and the street}} plan hints at a possible ovoid enclosure -Sackstrasse on W and the curved Wickenburggasse-Glacisstrasse on the NE – with the Schlossberg in the NW as citadel which have dominated an early settlement. However the earlier walled town first mentioned in 1115, was to the S and W of this and fronted onto the river Mur. Starting in 1544 the refortification of Graz <b>by</b> <b>of</b> the Italian military architect Domenico dell'Allio has done much to disguise the Medieval defences. Merian’s print of Graz from the S in 1679 shows Graz protected by 10 massive angled bastions with a water-filled moat in front of them. In this print some of the Medieval gate towers can be recognised and the Eisen Tor and the southern medieval wall would have coincided with the curtain wall of dell’Allio’s defences. Also to the N of the Y shaped or ‘Driecksform’ marketplace there were three gates on the Sackgasse, and the Bruchentor and Murtor, demolished 1837, were on and adjacent to the bridge across the Mur. To-day the only gates remaining are the Burgtor adjacent to the Schlossberg, and the Aussere Paulustor on the E, which formed part of the later defences.|$|E
