25|$|In February 2006, State Transportation Secretary John Cogliano {{proposed}} a $94 million {{plan that would}} eliminate most of the tunneling and cost of the original proposal while still connecting the two phases of the service. Under Cogliano's plan, the Silver Line would run on the surface via Kneeland Street and Surface Road to a new tunnel portal on Essex Street near South Station. A fare-controlled shelter would be added at Downtown Crossing. The plan also included expansion of surface Silver Line service, with a new branch running from Copley Square into the Essex Street portal to provide a one-seat ride from the Back Bay area. The southern branch would be extended from Dudley to the Red Line stations at Mattapan via Blue Hill Avenue (replacing the #28 bus) and Ashmont via Washington Street (replacing the #23 bus), with additional connections to the Fairmount commuter rail line at the then-planned Blue Hill Avenue and Four Corners/Geneva Ave stations. The plan was popular with Bay Village residents who had <b>been</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> the full-length tunnel, but attracted criticism because it would not substantially speed travel times to downtown.|$|E

2500|$|Peter Warr {{actually}} wanted to replace Nigel Mansell with Senna at Lotus, but their British-based title sponsor, Imperial Tobacco (John Player & Sons), wanted a British driver. Senna, however, {{was determined to}} drive that season and certainly on his own terms. Senna's test for Brabham occurred at Paul Ricard in November 1983, and he set lap times two seconds slower than the team's lead driver, Nelson Piquet, who allegedly gave Senna the nickname [...] "the São Paulo taxi driver". Senna impressed the Brabham team and was linked to their second seat. However, the team's main sponsor, Italian dairy company Parmalat, wanted an Italian driver. Brabham's second car was eventually shared by brothers Teo and Corrado Fabi, while Piquet convinced Ecclestone to sign his friend Roberto Moreno as the test driver. Consequently, he joined Toleman, a relatively new team, using less competitive Pirelli tyres. Venezuelan Johnny Cecotto, a former Grand Prix motorcycle racing world champion, was his teammate. During 1984, Senna hired Nuno Cobra to assess his physical condition. Senna had <b>been</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> his condition due to low weight.|$|E

2500|$|With {{the force}} {{concentrated}} in vital Dazaifu and Hirotsugu's {{connections in the}} capital, this situation posed {{a serious threat to}} the central government. Shōmu, who also might have <b>been</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> a possible involvement of Silla, responded by assigning Ono no Azumabito as general over a suppression army of 17,000 men taken from eastern and western Japan except for Kyushu — the largest royal army of the 8th century. As draftees had been released a year before due to the epidemics, it took another month before they could be mustered. On 29 September the government sends a reconnaissance team of 24 native Hayato. Forces on either side consisted of both infantry and mounted soldiers and were under local command of district magistrates. According to William Wayne Farris, in 8th century [...] Japan, the horsemen played a decisive role in the strength of an army. Before any battle, in this conflict, {{a large part of the}} government troops would be recruited from western Honshu where many good mounted archers were located, giving them a decisive advantage over Hirotsugu who was limited to Kyushu. Later in the conflict, some of Hirotsugu's mounted soldiers would defect, augmenting this advantage.|$|E
2500|$|Edison {{expressed}} {{views that}} AC was unworkable {{and the high}} voltages used were dangerous. As George Westinghouse installed his first AC systems in 1886, Thomas Edison struck out personally against his chief rival stating, [...] "Just as certain as death, Westinghouse will kill a customer within six months after he puts {{in a system of}} any size. He has got a new thing and it will require a great deal of experimenting to get it working practically." [...] Many reasons have been suggested for Edison's anti-AC stance. One notion is that the inventor could not grasp the more abstract theories behind AC and was trying to avoid developing a system he did not understand. Edison also appeared to have <b>been</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> the high voltage from misinstalled AC systems killing customers and hurting the sales of electric power systems in general. Primary was the fact that Edison Electric based their design on low voltage DC and switching a standard after they had installed over 100 systems was, in Edison's mind, out of the question. By the end of 1887, Edison Electric was losing market share to Westinghouse, who had built 68 AC-based power stations to Edison's 121 DC-based stations. To make matters worse for Edison, the Thomson-Houston Electric Company of Lynn, Massachusetts (another AC-based competitor) built 22 power stations.|$|E
