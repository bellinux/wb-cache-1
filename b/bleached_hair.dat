5|$|Madonna's {{look and}} style of dressing, her performances, and her music videos {{influenced}} young girls and women. Her style {{became one of the}} female fashion trends of the 1980s. Created by stylist and jewelry designer Maripol, the look consisted of lace tops, skirts over capri pants, fishnet stockings, jewelry bearing the crucifix, bracelets, and <b>bleached</b> <b>hair.</b> Madonna's popularity continued to rise globally with the release of her second studio album, Like a Virgin, in November 1984. It became her first number-one album in Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain, the UK, and the US. Like a Virgin was certified diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America and sold more than 21 million copies worldwide.|$|E
25|$|The outlaws now {{prepare for}} an attack on D'Eyncourt Castle, {{gathering}} money for their needs. Alan leads Dickon and others to waylay the Abbot of Rufford, disguising themselves as a knight and luring him into an ambush. Seeing Dickon's talent for disguises, Robin sends the boy to infiltrate D'Eyncourt Castle and acquire information about its defences. Disguised as a page with <b>bleached</b> <b>hair,</b> Dickon manages to penetrate D'Eyncourt on Christmas, but is betrayed by an undyed lock of hair. Pursued, he hides on the chapel's beams and eventually escapes from the castle, surviving a crossbow shot.|$|E
25|$|Other {{evidence}} {{presented by the}} prosecution included {{a piece of a}} man's pyjama top supposedly from a pair Cora had given Crippen a year earlier. The pyjama bottoms were found in Crippen's bedroom, but not the top. The fragment included the manufacturer's label, Jones Bros. Curlers, with <b>bleached</b> <b>hair</b> consistent with Cora's were found with the remains. Testimony from a Jones Bros. representative, the store that the pyjama top fragment came from, stated that the product was not sold prior to 1908, thus placing the date of manufacture well within the time period of when the Crippens occupied the house and when Cora gave the garment to Hawley the year before in 1909.|$|E

50|$|The {{song was}} {{proposed}} to Alizée by Pascal Obispo after their earlier conversation about Alizée telling {{that she would}} like to <b>bleach</b> her <b>hair.</b> Pascal told her that he would have a song to match those hair if she'd be interested. Alizée went and <b>bleached</b> her <b>hair</b> and the single was released.|$|R

25|$|The band filmed a {{music video}} {{for the song}} {{depicting}} a teenage boy with <b>bleached</b> <b>hair</b> who is harassed by others. Wanting to fit in, he starts by cutting his hair short. He then takes his shirt off, and starts to cover himself with a black tar-like substance. He puts on a fly mask, as he continues to cover himself with the tar, with Durst watching him in the background with a disgusted look on his face. The boy then exits his room and comes down the stairs, now mutated {{into some sort of}} human fly. He enters the kitchen, where his family simply ignores him. He jumps onto the kitchen table, and begins to throw around the food on the table, while rubbing some into his face.|$|E
25|$|Rey Cometa was {{accompanied}} by Stuka, Jr. for his one-on-one match with Namajague, while his opponent had Okumura at ringside, bringing all four participants in the Homenaje a Dos Leyendas main event back together again. Okumura helped his partner by attacking Rey Cometa before the bell could even ring, giving Namajague the advantage for the first fall, allowing him to pin Cometa after a power bomb. Stuka, Jr. helped Cometa by keeping Okumura at bay during the second fall, even when the two wrestlers fought outside the ring. At one point Rey Cometa was able to leap off the elevated stage, landing a Moonsault assault on Namajague. Once back inside the ring Rey Cometa forced Namajague to submit to an Armbar submission hold. The third fall was the longest of the match as saw both men hold the advantage in the match at different times. After looking like he would lose Rey Cometa was able to outsmart Namajague, allowing him to land a 450° splash so he could pin him to win the match. Following the match Namajague, who had resisted removing his mask during the Dos Leyendas show, accepted the loss and knelt down as Rey Cometa began to cut his hair. After getting a few handfuls of Namajague's black and <b>bleached</b> <b>hair</b> he left the official CMLL barber finish up, shaving all of Namajague's hair off while still sitting {{in the center of}} the ring.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "Open Your Heart" [...] {{music video}} {{presents}} {{an early version}} of Madonna's musings about her Italian-American heritage and focus on her feminocentric street theology, which was also explicitly brought out by 1987's Who's That Girl World Tour. It starts with the little boy trying to go inside a peep show, where Madonna is the star performer, but gets rebuffed by an old man at the ticket booth. Inside Madonna starts singing the song from the center of a carousel that revolves to display her to the gaze of the customers who are sitting safely in their cubicles. Madonna is dressed in a black bustier, spike heels, fishnets, revealing her new slimmed down body at that time. She begins the video wearing a black wig which she subsequently removes, revealing her short <b>bleached</b> <b>hair.</b> The bluish and dark lighting reveals her look as a mix of actresses Marlene Dietrich in the movie The Blue Angel as well as Liza Minnelli as the character Sally Bowles in the Bob Fosse-directed musical film, Cabaret.|$|E
50|$|Common {{side effects}} are peeling, itching, redness, dryness, burning, and dermatitis. Benzoyl {{peroxide}} <b>bleaches</b> <b>hair,</b> clothes, towels, bedclothing, and the like. Prolonged exposure to natural or artificial sun light (UV rays) {{is not recommended}} because the gel may cause photosensitivity. Irritation due to benzoyl peroxide can be reduced by avoiding harsh facial cleansers and wearing sunscreen prior to sun exposure.|$|R

In series 10 Michael comes out and tells his family that he is gay; he is relieved when they accept this.|$|E
2500|$|In 204 BC, the Galli priesthood {{were brought}} to Rome from Phrygia, to serve the [...] "Trojan" [...] Mother Goddess Cybele and her consort [...] Attis {{on behalf of the}} Roman state. They were legally {{protected}} but flamboyantly [...] "un-Roman". They were eunuchs, and told fortunes for money; their public rites were wild, frenzied and bloody, and their priestly garb was [...] "womanly". They wore long, flowing robes of yellow silk, extravagant jewellery, perfume and make-up, and turbans or exotic versions of the [...] "phrygian" [...] hat over long, <b>bleached</b> <b>hair.</b>|$|E

50|$|Benzoyl {{peroxide}} (BPO) is {{a medication}} and industrial chemical. As a medication {{it is used}} to treat mild to moderate acne.

40|$|The {{influence}} of different nonionic and slightly cationic surfactants used only in <b>bleaching</b> of <b>hairs</b> before dyeing with C. I. Acid Blue 80 or only in dyeing on tensile stress/strain properties of dyed human hair was examined. The pretreatment of hair fibres before dyeing {{was carried out}} in alkali media with hydrogen peroxide in the presence or in the absence of surfactants. The results have shown that when the <b>bleaching</b> of <b>hairs</b> was accomplished in the absence of surfactants, but in the subsequent low temperature dyeing of hair fibres were applied nonionic surfactants, the rate of dye adsorption onto the fibres was enhanced. When polyoxyethylene (25) cocamine or ethoxylated (32) castor oil surfactants or ethoxylated (EO 12) coconut acids fatty amide were applied only in the <b>bleaching</b> of <b>hair</b> fibres, the dyeability was enhanced and the tensile characteristic values of dyed hairs were increased as well...|$|R
2500|$|The {{packaging}} and image of Don't Don is darker {{than that of}} their first album. Don't Don came to stores with thirteen different covers, each cover featuring a different member. All thirteen covers of the members are included within the CD package, and the covers can be changed anytime. First impressions of the album were critical but well-accepted, as Super Junior transformed into a much edgier image than from their previous image in [...] "U." [...] The members sported <b>bleached</b> <b>hair</b> and had astounding hairstyles, which were influences from the combination of punk fashion and hip hop fashion. Some of the members also imprinted large temporary tattoos on their skin, which surrounded the arms, back, and stomach.|$|E
2500|$|On February 22, 1998, Steiner {{joined the}} nWo at SuperBrawl VIII, by attacking his brother Rick {{while they were}} {{defending}} the WCW World Tag Team Championship against The Outsiders. The next night, on Nitro, he adopted a new gimmick, dyeing his hair and beard blond and further increasing his muscle mass. Scott then adopted the nicknames [...] "White Thunder", in reference to his <b>bleached</b> <b>hair</b> and goatee and his all-white singlet, and [...] "Superstar", as a homage to [...] "Superstar" [...] Billy Graham. However, he soon discarded both nicknames, and instead proclaimed himself as [...] "Big Poppa Pump". Steiner further altered his attire as he began wearing sunglasses and chain mail headgear {{as part of his}} ring entrance outfit. He then began teaming with former rival Buff Bagwell and remained a member of the nWo until the group disbanded in early 1999.|$|E
2500|$|The final {{match of}} the night had both Shocker and Emilio Charles Jr. both put their hair on the line {{on the outcome of}} the match as well as the [...] "ownership" [...] of the Los Guapos group name as well. Guapo founder Shocker lost the first fall to Guapo usurper Emilio Charles Jr. putting him behind from the beginning. Shocker fought back and showed Charles that Shocker was just as capable of {{cheating}} and using underhanded tactics, even if he was not a tecnico after the other Guapos had turned on him, taking the second fall. The third fall of the match saw the advantage change from moment to moment as neither man dominated, but in the end Shocker took advantage of a miscommunication between Charles as Bestia Salvaje and Scorpio Jr. who tried to interfere in the match and pinned Emilio Charles Jr. for the third and final fall. After the match Charles' long, <b>bleached</b> <b>hair</b> was clipped off, then the rest of his hair was shaved completely off.|$|E

2500|$|In mid-2000 Shocker, Bestia Salvaje and Scorpio Jr. {{teamed up}} in Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) {{to form a}} group called Los Guapos (The Hansome Ones"). The Los Guapos concept {{presented}} all three wrestlers as vain, selffocused bordering on narcissistic metrosexual wrestlers who were almost more concerned with their looks, <b>bleached</b> <b>hair</b> etc. than anything else. The group {{took part in a}} large number of vignettes with them visiting beauty spas and talking about their looks, which played for comedic value, especially considering none of the wrestlers were considered [...] "classically beautiful", in fact Scorpio, Jr's father was nicknamed El Rey Feo ("The Ugly King") and the son took after his father. In mid-2001 both Scorpio Jr. and Salvaje wanted to bring in their long time friend and partner Emilio Charles Jr. to the group, which Shocker opposed on the ground that Charles Jr. was simply [...] "too ugly". Even after attempts at a [...] "make over" [...] Shocker still opposed the inclusion. in the fall Los Guapos turned on Shocker, and the three Nuevo Guapos attacked Shocker during and after several matches. In the end Shocker and Emilio Charles Jr. agreed to a Lucha de Apuesta or [...] "bet match" [...] where both wrestlers would put their hair on the line against the outcome of the match. The Luchas de Apuestas match is the ultimate [...] "storyline settler" [...] in Lucha Libre and would also determine which side would be the true Los Guapos.|$|E

Or, if one is rich, what better fun than to grub-stake an expedition on the supposed site of a dead city and see what turns up?
