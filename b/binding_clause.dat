In this research, we deal with a design problem of material flow in the delivery center. The problem can be expressed as follows: determining the sizes of the automatic warehouses, the number of warehouse cranes, that of depalletizers and robots, and the flow volume among these equipments. An overview of a delivery center, and design objects are shown in Fig. 1. In recent years, some delivery centers have been completely automated to improve the operational costs and shipping efficiency. We propose an extended network flow model in which each device represents a node of the network flow and the conveyed products correspond to the flow within the model. Figure 2, 3 represent the proposed model. When designing a delivery center, {{it is necessary to}} determine the appropriate number of devices, the flow among the devices, device-layout, etc. while holding the costs down and satisfying the demand throughput.

40|$|This Article {{discusses}} {{a troubling}} {{cause of the}} decline in civil trials — the growing ubiquity of predispute <b>binding</b> arbitration <b>clauses</b> — and discusses tension between roles and responsibilities classically associated with zealous advocacy and the pressing need for new roles and responsibilities associated with ethical dispute system design. Over the past decade, two interacting patterns have come to encourage transactional attorneys to engage in zealous advocacy when crafting predispute <b>binding</b> arbitration <b>clauses</b> in adhesion contracts. First, recent U. S. Supreme Court jurisprudence broadly defers and delegates authority to those who create such clauses in adhesion contracts with little oversight. Second, members of the public rarely read or understand these clauses buried in the boilerplate. Predispute <b>binding</b> arbitration <b>clauses</b> displace the legal backdrop of fair, legitimate, and just public legal institutions with the dispute-system procedure most preferred by those who draft and design these adhesion contracts. Therefore, norms of zealous advocacy may collide with a wider and more virtuous ethic that considers third parties and the public’s desire for a fair, legitimate, and just civil justice system. Before turning to the dialectic between these two ethical principles, we report a psychological experiment conducted with the American public. The study randomly assigned members of the public into conditions that varied how much they learned about the procedure (e. g., a legal definition, an example clause, a New York Times article) and asked them to rate the fairness and justice of binding arbitration. The experiment reveals that the more the public learns about pre-dispute binding arbitration, the more they believe this dispute-resolution procedure is unjust and illegitimate. Yet the vast majority of participants mistakenly believed that they had never entered into a binding-arbitration clause. This empirical legal study illustrates the psychological and felt injustice that many poor and middle-income members of the public experience when learning from legal professionals for the first time both that the legal wrongs they have suffered will likely not be remedied because of barriers imposed by binding arbitration and that the will likely not be able to secure legal representation as a result. Drawing on these findings, we discuss the pressing need for a wider ethic that applies to the transactional attorneys who design binding-arbitration clauses within adhesion contracts. We also draw lessons from behavioral legal ethics and social psychology. These lessons reveal that this wider ethic may be endangered by the situational influences that currently operate within law firms (and in-house) due to these two intersecting patterns. We discuss ways of altering the regulatory environment to encourage the wider ethic to flourish in this time of vanishing trials...|$|R
40|$|Counterpurchase {{contract}} {{is one of}} more frequently concluded countertrade transactions in international trade. Like other countertrade transactions, it is not separately regulated in Polish law. The basis of any attempts to systematize these phenomena and to examine their legal character must be the analysis of their contents. In particular, the analysis of stipulations of a counterpurchase contract, i. e. a specific and characteristic type of such transactions, should be carried out. The author defines a counterpurchase contract {{as a type of}} a countertrade transaction in which the exporter obliges himself to purchase from the importer, or from any other person indicated by the latter, goods for the value being usually in proportion to the cost of the export transaction. In his article the author analyses: the stipulation of a counterpurchase contract formulating the duty to conclude in future the execution contracts — the indication of the volume of an obligation, type of goods and prices (sec. 3), clauses typical for international trade contracts — reexport <b>clause,</b> <b>binding</b> force <b>clause,</b> arbitration clause and property clause (sec. 4), stipulations determining the performance of an obligation — time limit, the certificate releasing from the obligation (sec. 5), indications of legal consequences of non-performance — stipulated penalties and the consequences of paying them.

In particular, it argues that binding arbitration is not necessarily better and cheaper for all parties than litigation.

The ability of these hybrids to occur in affixal 'clause fusion' structures, as well as to appear as free main verbs embedding an independent clause, is unusual, and enables us to investigate the conditions on V-V incorporation.

In short, it is telling that in all of the arbitral class actions that attorneys have discussed with this author, the judge rather than the arbitrators decided all the critical class action issues. When the parties have agreed to a broad arbitration clause, it is not appropriate to exclude an entire class of disputes from arbitration, unless permitting class arbitration would violate constitutional, statutory, or contractual interests. Legislation will be needed to prevent companies from using <b>binding</b> arbitration <b>clauses</b> to eliminate class actions entirely, to the extent we decide it would be undesirable to allow companies to insulate themselves from class actions, {{and to the extent that}} courts fail to accept the statutory and contractual arguments set out in this Article or elsewhere...|$|R

40|$|Checking {{accounts}} are {{the cornerstone of}} household financial management, with nine out of 10 Americans using them to deposit earnings, pay bills, manage money, and build an ongoing relationship with a financial institution. However, despite this widespread use, consumers often are unaware {{of the terms of}} their checking account agreements. For instance, Pew found that many consumers are unaware that account agreements restrict their options if they have a dispute with their financial institution. Pew's prior research on terms and conditions of checking account agreements revealed that limitations on dispute resolution, including mandatory <b>binding</b> arbitration <b>clauses,</b> are common. These clauses require consumers to submit all complaints against their financial institution to a third-party decision maker (called an "arbitrator") instead of to a court. Building on earlier research, this report studies the account agreements of the 100 largest retail banks and credit unions by deposit volume to determine the prevalence of mandatory bindingarbitration clauses and other dispute resolution terms. Of these, Pew was able to obtain 92 checking account agreements (85 banks and 7 credit unions). (See Appendix A for list of financial institutions.) The focus was only on what was disclosed in these agreements, not additional rules and procedures required by the private arbitration companies. Additionally, Pew commissioned a survey of 603 consumers to ascertain American attitudes toward mandatory binding arbitration in checking accounts.

This contrast goes along with the placement of subject Agreement morphology: In RCs with CPmodifier clauses, the Agr element is placed on the predicate of the modifier clauses; in RCs with reduced, non-CP modifier clauses, the Agr is placed on the RC-head. The surface realizations, and thus observations, of these analytic claims are as follows: Languages whose RCs bear subject Agreement on the RC-head don’t exhibit a special predicate form on the modifier clause in subject RCs; RCs whose subject Agr is on the predicate of the modifier clause in non-subject RCs exhibit a special predicate form for subject RCs—a CA-effect...|$|R
40|$|This thesis aims to {{contribute}} to cross-linguistic {{research in the area}} of neurodevelopmental disorders by investigating the morphosyntactic abilities of Greek-speaking adolescents with Down Syndrome (henceforth DS). DS is the most common neurodevelopmental disorder and is considered the main genetic cause of mental retardation (Hagerman, 1999). Language development is a special challenge for people with DS since it is regarded to be relatively more impaired that other cognitive functions (Lenneberg, 1967). In addition, some aspects of language are more affected than others, with grammar more severely impaired than lexicon, semantics and pragmatics. The following questions were examined: (1) is the language of Greek-speaking people with DS severely delayed or deviant? (2) Is the language deficit in DS a consequence of a general (non-linguistic) cognitive impairment? (3) Does the language of people with DS exhibit the same clinical markers as other congenital syndromes with different genetic origin (e. g. SLI, WS), or are the impairments of the DS population syndrome-specific? Two groups took part: eight adolescents with DS (mean mental age: 5. 9) and sixteen typically developing children whose chronological age was matched with the mental ages of the DS participants. The phenomena under investigation were syntactic <b>binding,</b> relative <b>clauses</b> and wh-questions, and perfective past tense morphology. Findings revealed that the grammatical development in DS was not simply delayed, but that their language performance also deviated from that of typically developing children. Moreover, whilst difficulties were found for the DS participants in all the domains we investigated, the results do not decide as to whether these difficulties are grammar-specific or due to general cognitive impairments. Finally, comparisons with SLI children (Stavrakaki, 2001) revealed syndrome-specific problems between atypical populations with different genetic origin.

Because 8 -K filings are required only for material events, these contracts likely are carefully negotiated by sophisticated parties who are well-informed about the contract terms. These contracts, therefore, {{provide evidence of}} efficient ex ante solutions to contracting problems. The vast majority of contracts did not require arbitration. Only about 11 percent of the contracts included <b>binding</b> arbitration <b>clauses.</b> The rate of arbitration clauses varied substantially by type of contract. For example, pooling and servicing agreements and trust agreements had no arbitration clauses while employment and licensing contracts had {{the highest rate of}} arbitration clauses, 37 percent and 33 percent respectively. Arbitration clauses are strongly negatively associated with standardization of contract terms: the more standardized the contract, the less likely it will mandate arbitration of disputes. Contracts with California connections tended to have high rates of arbitration clauses while contracts with New York connections tended to have low rates of arbitration clauses. Arbitration clauses {{were significantly more likely to}} appear in contracts with international connections, but even in such contracts, the clauses were infrequent in absolute terms. Only 20 percent of international contracts contained arbitration clauses compared to ten percent of domestic contracts. Our results suggest, in contracts involving two sophisticated actors, that the parties perceive preserving access to litigation to be value-enhancing compared to ex ante binding arbitration. This contrasts with widespread beliefs about arbitration’s efficiency and with imposition of mandatory arbitration clauses in some standardized consumer transactions such as credit card and cellular phone contracts...|$|R
