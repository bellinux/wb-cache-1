500|$|On 28 January 1942, FBI agents {{arrived at}} Townsend's home and arrested him for having {{acted as a}} Japanese agent without {{registering}} under the Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938. A federal investigation into Japanese propaganda which had begun in November 1941 discovered that Townsend had received payments from the Japanese Committee on Trade and Information, a Japanese propaganda organization which had existed between 1937 and 1940. Though Townsend denied being a paid Japanese agent and {{claimed to be a}} victim of political persecution, he did admit to having accepting money from the Committee, stating that it was merely a payment in exchange for the <b>bulk</b> <b>sale</b> of his pamphlets. Even so, Townsend opted to plead guilty on 27 March and argued for a lenient sentence on the grounds that he was not aware that his acts were illegal. Townsend also solicited the support of anti-interventionist politicians and he was sent favorable character references by both former Senator Rush D. Holt and his longtime friend Senator Gerald Nye, the latter of whom described Townsend as [...] "a loyal and patriotic American citizen". The presiding justice T. Alan Goldsborough was, however, unmoved, and deeming his crimes [...] "repulsive, obscene and macabre", Townsend was sentenced on 12 June to between 8 and 24 months in prison and was incarcerated in Washington DC.|$|E
50|$|The sale of {{an entire}} {{inventory}} is not a <b>bulk</b> <b>sale</b> if it is sold to buyers {{in a manner that}} ensures adequate consideration. For example, if a merchant holds an auction sale for the entire contents of the business and the sale is in good faith, the buyer in not required to comply with bulk sales legislation. However, the buyer of a business with inventory would be expected to complete the bulk sales registration as part of the normal course of closing the sale. Similarly, if a merchant has a deep discount sale, that is not a <b>bulk</b> <b>sale</b> as deep discounts can be made in the ordinary course of business.|$|E
50|$|The {{company was}} founded by Aliko Dangote after {{receiving}} a $3,000 loan from an uncle. Initially, the company focused on the <b>bulk</b> <b>sale</b> of foods such as rice, but gradually expanded to shipping and the importing of cement. Dangote competed (and competes) with Lafarge, a French company that imported and produced the bulk of African cement.|$|E

50|$|Wet {{grinders}} {{are mainly}} sold through retail channels with the manufacturer distributing it through intermediaries. Since 2014, the sales through e-commerce channel has grown considerably helping in <b>bulk</b> <b>sales</b> and brand building.|$|R
50|$|Most {{states also}} exempt <b>bulk</b> <b>sales,</b> such as sales {{of an entire}} business. Most states exempt from sales tax goods {{purchased}} for use as ingredients or parts in further manufacturing. Buyers in exempt sales must follow certain procedures or face tax.|$|R
50|$|A <b>bulk</b> <b>sale,</b> {{sometimes}} called a bulk transfer, {{is when a}} business sells all or nearly all of its inventory to a single buyer and such a sale {{is not part of}} the ordinary course of business. This type of action is often used in an attempt to dodge creditors who intend to seize such business's inventory; in order to protect the purchaser from claims made by creditors of the seller, the seller must usually complete an affidavit outlining its secured and unsecured creditors, which must usually be filed with a government department, such as a court office. Such procedures are outlined in the bulk sales act of most jurisdictions. If the buyer does not complete the registration process for a <b>bulk</b> <b>sale,</b> creditors of the seller may obtain a declaration that the sale was invalid against the creditors and the creditors may take possession of the goods or obtain judgment for any proceeds the buyer received from a subsequent sale.|$|E
50|$|For example, in the {{ordinary}} course of business, a car dealer would sell a number of cars in one day. In extraordinary circumstances, it might sell its entire inventory to different buyers within {{a short period of}} time. However, if it attempted to sell all its cars to a single buyer, this would be considered a <b>bulk</b> <b>sale,</b> as it is not something an auto dealer would generally do in the normal course of business.|$|E
5000|$|The {{last great}} problem to face Olmsted in China was {{what to do}} with the surplus {{equipment}} that had to be left behind in the Theater as American forces departed to come home. Not wishing to see all that stuff abandoned in place, Olmsted managed to work out a <b>bulk</b> <b>sale</b> to the Chinese government. When he heard about it, President Truman was reported to have said, [...] "this was the best liquidation of surplus US equipment anywhere in the world".|$|E
50|$|In 1989, the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws {{recommended}} that Article 6 of the UCC, dealing with <b>bulk</b> <b>sales,</b> be repealed as obsolete. Approximately 45 states have done so. Two others {{have followed the}} alternative recommendation of revising Article 6.|$|R
5000|$|The New York Times {{initially}} stated {{they were}} aware of the <b>bulk</b> book <b>sales,</b> and that they were confident the <b>bulk</b> <b>sales</b> had not increased the books position on the best-seller list. After reviewing the article in Bloomberg Businessweek, however, the editor of The New York Times book review section stated it was possible that the result had been manipulated, but that the process [...] "would be so expensive that they'd have to have another reason for doing it beyond simply boosting book sales.|$|R
50|$|Reasons for win: Arrow {{promoted}} their {{store with}} balloons and banners and also {{attempted to make}} <b>bulk</b> <b>sales</b> outside of the store. As a result, the store was constantly busy during the day, with one boss ordering 23 of their products for his employees. Their total sales were $488.|$|R
5000|$|The {{purchase}} {{price of the}} club itself required allocating that price among all of the club's assets (e.g., equipment, players, league fees), not simply assigning a dollar value to each player (as in the free agent market). This transaction was essentially the bulk purchase {{of all of the}} Pilots' players in an arms-length transaction with no restrictions. Because this sort of <b>bulk</b> <b>sale</b> was the reality of the [...] "club" [...] market, the players should be valued in accordance with the market's nature.|$|E
50|$|Although {{statutes}} vary, {{the legal}} requirements for a <b>bulk</b> <b>sale</b> generally {{apply to a}} sale of {{all or most of}} the materials, supplies or inventory of a business in a way not normally done in the ordinary course of the seller's business. Bulk transfers in the United States (U.S.) were generally governed by Article 6 of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC). However, Article 6 has now been repealed by most states, in favor of revisions to other provisions of the UCC that apply to sales and secured transactions.|$|E
5000|$|A 14378 sq ft CVS Pharmacy {{store that}} {{operates}} {{inside the building}} was sold in March 2014, {{at a cost of}} $30 million, the most expensive sale price for a CVS store in the Las Vegas Valley. In April 2015, the tower's remaining unsold 65 units were put on the market as part of a <b>bulk</b> <b>sale</b> that also included 26800 sq ft of vacant retail space on the second and third floors. The sale, with a listed price of [...] "best offer," [...] did not include the CVS store. In September 2015, Pathfinder Partners purchased the tower's remaining 64 units. The CVS was listed for sale in January 2016.|$|E
30|$|To {{test for}} such countervailing effects, we examine café <b>sales</b> and <b>bulk</b> <b>sales</b> {{relative}} to book sales. In all three outcome sub-categories—café <b>sales,</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>sales,</b> and book sales—the ambient chocolate scent treatment produced null results, providing neither {{evidence that a}} chocolate scent increased sales of a within-domain product (food items), nor evidence that the chocolate scent induced a preference for within-domain products over out-of-domain products (books). The direction of the treatment effect on café sales was slightly negative, though not statistically significant (average estimated decrease of 8.9 CAD from a control average of 336.5 CAD, two-tailed p = . 59) and the direction of treatment on bulk coffee bean/loose tea/spice sales was slightly positive, though not statistically significant (average estimated increase of 23.2 CAD from a control average of 71.2 CAD, two-tailed p = . 29).|$|R

50|$|In 2009 the {{organisation}} reviewed how their figures reflected <b>bulk</b> <b>sales,</b> which were often given away for free.

50|$|Today, the nut's demand outstrips supply. The United States {{imported}} 4,056 {{metric tons}} of European in-shell chestnuts worth $10 million in 2007. The U.S. chestnut industry is in its infancy, producing less than 1% of total world production. Since the mid-20th century, most of the US imports are from Southern Italy, with the large, meaty, and richly flavored Sicilian chestnuts being considered among the best quality for <b>bulk</b> <b>sale</b> and supermarket retail. Some imports come from Portugal and France. The next two largest sources of imports are China and South Korea. The French varieties of marrons are highly favoured and sold at high prices in gourmet shops.|$|E
50|$|In {{a curious}} but {{consistent}} {{parallel to the}} founding of the yeshibah in Hebron in 1659, mentioned above, the brothers Pereyra had also founded a yeshibah upon their arrival in Amsterdam circa 1644. They then appointed Menasseh ben Israel as the yeshibahs head or principal. This position provided Manassehs main source of livelihood henceforth and until his death. Roth also refers throughout the book to many of the financial problems of Manassehs Hebrew printing press in Amesterdam, and indicates that the business may have had other sources of funds for its daily operations, besides the <b>bulk</b> <b>sale</b> of books. Abraham Pereyra, as the main personal benefactor of Menasseh, must have been also directly involved in helping finance and support the enterprise from its inception, and throughout its period of activity.|$|E
50|$|Reasons for loss: Apex started {{somewhat}} {{later than}} Mosaic, and {{were forced to}} move from their original sales location near the TKTS center when existing street vendors demanded to see their permit (it was not clear that they actually needed one for the task). In the process, Apex became separated and their carts lost {{contact with each other}} for several hours. Apex tried to bring the carts back together, but Stacie J. misidentified their location as the junction with 7th Avenue, when they were actually standing at the junction with Broadway. Though they eventually got the carts back together, and Jennifer C. made a <b>bulk</b> <b>sale</b> to a restaurant {{near the end of the}} day, the time lost when the carts were separated ultimately proved too much to overcome.|$|E
50|$|Firing verdict: Although Nicole {{was brought}} back, {{she was not}} held liable for the loss since she did her best as far as <b>bulk</b> <b>sales</b> were concerned, and Trump even said he didn't {{understand}} why she was brought back. While Surya did poorly due to his marketing strategies, Trump decided to give Surya a second chance.|$|R

40|$|<b>Bulk</b> <b>sales</b> {{legislation}} arose out of {{an attempt}} to protect the creditors of merchants who would sell their stock in trade and either squander or secrete the proceeds. Under the normal rules relating to fraudulent conveyances, the creditor could pursue the property transfixed if he could show that the transfer was made with the intent to hinder, delay, or defraud creditors, and that the transferee had knowledge of the transferor 2 ̆ 7 s design. However, since a creditor would not be entitled to relief if the transferee was an innocent purchaser for an adequate consideration, and it generally would be difficult to prove that the transferee was aware of any fraudulent intent which the transferor might have had, the protection afforded by the ordinary doctrines concerning fraudulent conveyances or transfers was inadequate. Under <b>bulk</b> <b>sales</b> legislation, the creditor is normally allowed to treat certain transfers in bulk as void if the parties do not comply with the statutory requirements regardless of their intent or the fairness of the transaction. The statutory requirements, though varying from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, ordinarily include the preparation of an inventory of the assets to be transferred, the preparation of a list of creditors, and a requirement that notice of the intended transfer be sent to the creditors of the transferor prior to the completion of the transaction. Article 6 of the Nebraska version of the Uniform Commercial Code, which will become operative at midnight on September 1, 1965, replaces the present Nebraska <b>bulk</b> <b>sales</b> law, and will govern the area of bulk transfers...|$|R
50|$|One of {{the reasons}} for high water prices charged by kiosks was, and perhaps still is, that kiosk owners have to pay bribes to officials, both to allow the initial {{construction}} and to operate the kiosks. To register a water connection the utility requires the applicant's plot number, address details, a landlord's certification as a proof of residence, and a certificate of employment. The kiosk operators often do not have these documents and thus pay bribes. Another reason for high prices is that unregistered kiosk owners are not charged at the preferential <b>bulk</b> <b>sale</b> rate, but rather at the increasing-block rate for residential customers. A 1997 study showed that there is substantial competition between nearby water kiosks. Profits of kiosk owners were low and high prices were caused primarily by high costs.|$|E
50|$|Bulk sales {{legislation}} {{came into}} place {{to prevent the}} fraudulent practice of selling the entire inventory of a farm or a store in order to defeat the claims of creditors who would otherwise be able to seize the goods to satisfy a debt. Under traditional fraudulent conveyance law, such a sale was not void against creditors unless it was made in bad faith for insufficient consideration. However, a <b>bulk</b> <b>sale</b> would generally allow a storekeeper to abscond with money while leaving creditors unpaid. However, because such a transaction was generally at arm's length, was for appropriate consideration, {{and may have been}} made in good faith, it was generally binding on creditors until bulk sales statutes were passed. Bulk sales legislation, such as Article Six of the Uniform Commercial Code was designed to eliminate this type of fraud.|$|E
50|$|It is {{the amount}} of profit after tax which should be paid to the {{shareholders}} of the firm, in the form of dividends, to keep them satisfied. If the minimum level of profit cannot be given out to the shareholders, they might resort of <b>bulk</b> <b>sale</b> of their shares which will transfer the ownership to other hands leaving the company in the risk of a complete take over. Since the shareholders have the voting rights, they might also vote for the change of the top level of management. Thus the job security of the manager is also threatened.Ideally the reported profits must be either equal to or greater than the minimum profits plus the taxes, as it is only after paying out the minimum profit that the additional profit can be used to increase the managerial utility further.|$|E

30|$|We present two regression-based {{analyses}} of the trial. The first is a simple ordinary least squares regression of our four outcomes: total <b>sales,</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>sales,</b> café sales, and book sales in Canadian dollars (CAD). This strategy is logically equivalent to taking a simple mean difference between treatment and control. To improve efficiency, the second strategy uses ordinary least squares adjusting for a mean-centered linear time trend as well as mean-centered fixed effects for the day of week, following Lin (2013). In all cases, robust standard errors are used to estimate standard errors, with p values computed under a normal approximation.|$|R
50|$|Construction Loans {{are often}} {{extended}} for developers {{who are seeking}} to build something but sell it immediately after building it. In this case, a special appraisal is ordered to attempt {{to predict the future}} sales value of the project. The first guideline above, affordability, is usually not used because the owner would immediately attempt to sell the property. However, it is used sometimes for example when a developer is building condominia, the lender might evaluate whether if the project was changed from condominia to apartments if the rents received would more than repay the loan each month. Cash injection requirements are often higher due to the added risk (the immediate need to sell). The loan to value requirements however are often the most impactful. This is because the value is often calculated differently then how people might assume. For example, if a developer is building a 20 unit condominium project, a lender might not just loan a certain percentage of the predicted future total value of the condominia, but only a certain percentage {{of the value of the}} condominium project if, because of an emergency or unforeseen circumstance, the entire building had to be sold at once to one buyer (known as a <b>bulk</b> <b>sale).</b> Since the realizable sales price in this case might be much lower, the maximum loan many lenders would extend would be much lower.|$|E
