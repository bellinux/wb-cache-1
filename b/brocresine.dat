40|$|Administration of a {{specific}} histidine decarboxylase inhibitor, 4 -bromo- 3 -hydroxybenzyloxyamine (<b>brocresine)</b> failed to affect PCA or delayed hypersensitivity reactions in guinea-pigs. Skin histamine levels measured following PCA reactions, when the skin was refractory to a second stimulus showed no significant changes in both treated and untreated animals. Triprolidine, an antihistamine, also failed to significantly alter PCA reactivity. These findings may be interpreted to mean that the operative pool of histamine is very small, its production unaffected by <b>brocresine</b> and its action protected {{from the effects of}} antihistamines. Alternatively, it seems more likely that histamine plays little role in the PCA reactions of guinea-pigs...|$|E
40|$|<b>Brocresine,</b> an {{aromatic}} L-amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor {{with both}} a peripheral and central action was shown to potentiate the therapeutic effect of levodopa in Parkinson's disease. The search for useful decarboxylase inhibitors therefore need {{not be limited to}} agents that do not pass the blood/brain barrier...|$|E
40|$|The {{histidine}} decarboxylase inhibitor <b>brocresine,</b> in doses from 600 mg to 1800 mg daily, {{failed to}} diminish skin histamine and histamine excretion {{in patients with}} chronic urticaria. A slight decrease in clinical symptoms was found, these data, however, are comparable to those found, when chronic urticaria patients are treated with placebo. No patient was cured {{after two weeks of}} treatment. Possible explanations of the lack of potent inhibition and discrepancies with observations of other workers are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} burimamide, an H 2 -antihistamine, on the anaphylactic {{reaction}} in the skin of ovalbumin-sensitized guinea pigs were studied in vitro. Burimamide enhanced the concentration of histamine in the supernatant fraction of antigen-challenged sensitized guinea-pig skin in a dose-related way, but did not alter the concentration of residual histamine in the skin after antigen challenge. The enhanced histamine concentration in the supernatant was not due to increased histamine synthesis by the target cells during the reaction because the increase was not inhibited by a histidine decarboxylase inhibitor, <b>Brocresine.</b> In further experiments it was shown that guinea-pig skin possesses potent histamine degrading enzyme activity which is inhibited by burimamide. We suggest that inhibition of these degrading enzymes leads {{to the increase in}} histamine concentration in the presence of burimamide...|$|E
40|$|We {{previously}} {{reported that a}} factor(s) from rat choriocarcinoma (Rcho- 1) cells suppresses circulating PRL levels and increases tyrosine hydroxylase activity in tuberoinfundibular dopaminergic neurons in uivo. The {{purposes of this study}} were to determine whether this factor(s) increases tyrosine hydroxylase activity in fetal hypothalamic cells in vitro and to evaluate its chemical nature. The Rcho- 1 cells are of placental origin and have the capacity to differentiate into giant cells and produce members of the placental PRL family. MMQ cells, a pituitary cell line that secretes PRL, and HRP- 1, a placental cell line that does not produce any known members of the PRL family, were used as control cells. Tyrosine hydroxylase activity was assessed by incubation of hypothalamic cells for 1 h with 100 FM <b>brocresine,</b> an inhibitor of aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase. Tyrosine hydroxyl-ase activity was increased in a density-dependent manner when Rcho...|$|E
