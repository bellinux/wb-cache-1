5|$|As {{the guards}} brigades reached their objectives, the newly gained ground was {{gradually}} {{turned over to}} reserve HV units. The 163rd Infantry <b>Brigade,</b> defending Dubrovnik during the JNA siege, took over positions captured by the 4th Guards <b>Brigade.</b> The 1st Guards <b>Brigade</b> was relieved and its territorial gains were garrisoned by elements of the 115th Infantry <b>Brigade,</b> the 145th Infantry <b>Brigade,</b> the 148th Infantry <b>Brigade,</b> a battalion of the 156th Infantry <b>Brigade</b> and a company of the 102nd Infantry <b>Brigade.</b> The VRS counter-attacked the reserve infantry on 9 July, causing losses and {{the withdrawal of the}} 102nd Infantry <b>Brigade</b> company east of Zavala and the 115th Infantry <b>Brigade</b> from Zavala and Orahov Do. The retreat created a gap in the HV defences, threatening the town of Slano, but the 3rd Battalion of the 4th Guards <b>Brigade</b> closed it. Days later, the 148th Infantry <b>Brigade</b> conceded some of the offensive's gains to another VRS counter-attack near Bobani.

5|$|After Arnhem, {{replacements}} for the 1st Airlanding <b>Brigade</b> began {{to bring the}} <b>brigade</b> up to strength.

The 1st Airborne Division including the airlanding <b>brigade,</b> the Special Air Service <b>Brigade</b> and an ad hoc <b>brigade</b> formed from the divisional artillery were sent to disarm the German occupation forces in Norway in May 1945. On entering Norway, the division would be responsible for maintaining law and order in the areas it occupied, ensuring that German units followed the terms of their surrender, securing and then protecting captured airfields, and finally preventing the sabotage of essential military and civilian structures. After landing nearby, 1st Airlanding <b>Brigade</b> occupied the Norwegian capital Oslo, where Brigadier Bower became Commander, Oslo Area {{for the duration of the}} division's time in Norway.
