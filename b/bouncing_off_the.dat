5|$|Stacking or rigging the subwoofers in a {{vertical}} array focuses the low frequencies {{forward to a}} greater or lesser extent depending on the physical length of the array. Longer arrays have a more directional effect at lower frequencies. The directionality is more pronounced in the vertical dimension, yielding a radiation pattern that is wide but not tall. This helps reduce the amount of low frequency sound <b>bouncing</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> ceiling indoors and assists in mitigating external noise complaints outdoors.|$|E
5|$|Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) greets {{his friend}} Admiral Gregory Quinn (Ward Costello) and his {{assistant}} Lt. Commander Dexter Remmick (Robert Schenkkan) aboard the Enterprise. For classified reasons, Quinn has ordered Remmick to perform {{an investigation of the}} Enterprise and its crew and expects Picard to fully co-operate. Remmick's query causes tension in the crew, particularly when he questions the trustworthiness of the senior staff based on their personal logs and past actions. A young cadet, having failed the Starfleet Academy entrance examination, attempts to run away in a shuttlecraft but ends up drifting. Picard is able to direct the cadet to pilot the shuttle away from a planet by <b>bouncing</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|In road {{snow and}} ice control, brine is often used as an anti-icer rather than a de-icer. A vehicle carries a tank of brine, which is sprayed on the road surface before or {{at the onset of}} the storm. This keeps {{snow and ice}} from {{adhering}} to the surface and makes mechanical removal by plows easier. Solid salt is also wetted with brine or other liquid deicer. This speeds de-icing action and helps keep it from <b>bouncing</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> pavement into the gutter or ditch. Brine acts faster than solid salt and does not require compression by passing traffic to become effective. The brine is also more environmentally friendly, as less salt is required to treat the same length of road.|$|E

5|$|Following {{his success}} in Sydney, Jackson was tapped to direct the audio design and {{production}} at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, where he directed the opening ceremony and the closing ceremony. His sound design for BC Place Stadium did not have loudspeakers at ground level aimed up at the seating areas—Jackson determined that this approach would produce too much uncontrolled reverberation from sound waves <b>bouncing</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> ceiling. Instead, he configured two rings of loudspeakers {{hung from the ceiling}} 100ft (30m) above the ground, aimed downward. The inner ring held 8 arrays each composed of 12 Clair Brothers i3 line array speakers and the outer ring held 12 arrays of 7 Clair Brothers i3 line array speakers, augmented by 16 subwoofers. The lot was powered by 160 Lab.gruppen amplifiers which were also hung from the ceiling, and were networked via Dante in a triple-redundant configuration. Two DiGiCo D5 digital mixing consoles served as main and backup for the main audience sound, and two Yamaha PM1Ds handled main and backup duties for monitor mixing. Other equipment included dual-redundant Optocore fibre connections, two Dolby Lake Processors, and time code generated by two pairs of Fairlights which also handled audio cues timed to the action on the field.|$|E

25|$|Bowling a yorker {{requires}} {{pinpoint accuracy}} since bowling it slightly too long {{will result in}} a full toss or full pitched delivery that is easy for the batsman to play because the ball has not deviated by <b>bouncing</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> pitch. It also has most of its value as a surprise ball. For these two reasons, yorkers are not common deliveries in most circumstances.|$|E

25|$|There are {{different}} types of bowlers, from fast bowlers, whose primary weapon is pace, through swing and seam bowlers who {{try to make the}} ball deviate in its course through the air or when it bounces, to slow bowlers, who will attempt to deceive the batsmen with a variety of flight and spin. A spin bowler usually delivers the ball quite slowly and puts spin on the ball, causing it to turn at an angle while <b>bouncing</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> pitch.|$|E
25|$|At {{the other}} end of the scale, balls that bounce {{slightly}} closer to the batsman than the good length are said to be full pitched or overpitched or described as a half volley. These are often easier for the batsman to play than the good length because they do not have time to move much after <b>bouncing</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> seam and, arriving at the batsmen low to the ground, are ideal for drive strokes. However, in conditions favourable to swing bowling full pitched bowling gives the ball more time to move through the air challenging the batsman weigh up the risk of being able to play drives against uncertainty about the swing. Closer still to the batsman's feet is the yorker. An effective yorker's length will be difficult to pick early, forcing the batsman back into the crease. Additionally, because it bounces at the batsmen's feet, a well bowled yorker is not playable by a conventional cricket shot. If the ball fails to bounce at all before reaching the batsman it is labelled a full toss or beam ball. It is very easy for a batsman to play such a delivery as it will not have deviated at all from <b>bouncing</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> pitch.|$|E
25|$|PNC Park is {{distinct}} {{for having the}} Allegheny River running behind the right field bleachers. As a result, several balls were hit into the river on the fly (a feat that had only been accomplished once before in the stadium's regular-season history), {{as well as many}} more <b>bouncing</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> walkway alongside the river. Many fans waited in the river in canoes hoping to retrieve a ball, a sight more reminiscent of the following year's All-Star Game and Home Run Derby site, AT Park.|$|E

25|$|At Rutherford's behest, Geiger and Marsden {{performed}} {{a series of}} experiments where they pointed a beam of alpha particles at a thin foil of metal and measured the scattering pattern by using a fluorescent screen. They spotted alpha particles <b>bouncing</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> metal foil in all directions, some right back at the source. This should have been impossible according to Thomson's model; the alpha particles should have all gone straight through. Obviously, those particles had encountered an electrostatic force far greater than Thomson's model suggested they would, which in turn implied that the atom's positive charge was concentrated in a much tinier volume than Thomson imagined.|$|E
25|$|In 2000, his long-time {{admiration of}} the works of Robert A. Heinlein led him to create a new series, called The Dingilliad. It follows a {{resourceful}} teenager and his family as they try to begin a new life. Although not necessarily canon, there are hints that it ties into the War Against the Chtorr universe, with everything from the plagues to the rumored appearance of a giant purple worm (similar cross-universe tie-ins occur in Gerrold's Trackers books). The Dingilliad trilogy consists of Jumping Off the Planet (2000), <b>Bouncing</b> <b>Off</b> <b>the</b> Moon (2001), and Leaping to the Stars (2002). Jumping Off the Planet received the 2002 Hal Clement (Young Adult Award) for Excellence in Children's Science Fiction Literature.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} quarter, Chiefs {{receiver}} Danan Hughes gave his team a big opportunity by returning a punt 35 {{yards to the}} Oilers 42-yard line. But Kansas City ended up empty handed {{at the end of}} a drive in which they squandered multiple chances to get into scoring range. First, Montana threw a pass to the end zone that was barely deflected away from receiver Willie Davis by the outstretched arm of defensive back Cris Dishman. On the next play, he completed a pass to J. J. Birden that moved the ball to the 5-yard line, only to see it wiped out by a false start penalty on tackle John Alt. Then after a screen pass that gained nothing, Montana threw another pass to the end zone on third down, this one <b>bouncing</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> fingertips of a wide open Davis and forcing Kansas City to punt. Houston then drove to the Chiefs 10-yard line on a drive that included Moon's 16-yard scramble with an unnecessary roughness penalty turning it into a 31-yard gain. But after a penalty pushed them back to the 25, they too failed to score when Lewis knocked the ball out of Moon's hand as he pulled it back to throw and rookie linebacker Jaime Fields recovered the fumble. Montana completed a 22-yard pass to Davis on the first play after the turnover, and eventually the Chiefs reached the Houston 36-yard line. But Montana threw an incomplete pass on fourth and 1, and the score remained 10–0 at the end of the half.|$|E
