5|$|Epilepsy {{occurs in}} a number of other animals {{including}} dogs and cats and is the most common brain disorder in dogs. It is typically treated with anticonvulsants such as phenobarbital or bromide in dogs and phenobarbital in cats. Imepitoin is also used in dogs. While generalized seizures in horses are fairly easy to diagnose, it may <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> in non-generalized seizures and EEGs may be useful.|$|E

5|$|Molecular {{analyses}} of the internal transcribed spacer region clearly separate the four species currently recognized in Volvopluteus, but morphological identification can <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> due to the sometimes overlapping morphological variation among the species. Size of the fruit bodies, color of the cap, spore size, {{presence or absence of}} cystidia and morphology of the cystidia are the most important characters for morphological species delimitation in the genus.|$|E

5|$|The {{diagnosis}} and classification of AML can be challenging, {{and should be}} performed by a qualified hematopathologist or hematologist. In straightforward cases, the presence of certain morphologic features (such as Auer rods) or specific flow cytometry results can distinguish AML from other leukemias; however, {{in the absence of}} such features, diagnosis may <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult.</b>|$|E

5|$|Copernicium is {{calculated}} to have several properties {{that differ from}} its lighter homologues in group 12, zinc, cadmium and mercury; due to relativistic effects, it may even give up its 6d electrons instead of its 7s ones. Copernicium has also been calculated to possibly show the oxidation state +4, while mercury shows it in only one compound of disputed existence and zinc and cadmium do not show it at all, although more recent calculations cast doubt on this possibility. It has also been predicted to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> to oxidize copernicium from its neutral state than the other group 12 elements.|$|E
5|$|Digging {{the tunnel}} {{turned out to}} <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> than expected. The soil was rocky, which forced the men to dig deeper than planned. There, they {{discovered}} a leaking gas main, which required the installation of special pumps to bring fresh air to the men. To hide the noise from the digging, one of the crew played piano and sang in the house while the others worked below. On July5, Berkman visited the prison stable, planning to make his escape. He was horrified {{to discover that the}} entrance was blocked by a large load of stones and bricks recently dumped for a construction project.|$|E
5|$|Due to a {{small number}} of embassies, Azerbaijan can <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> to obtain a visa when {{compared}} to other countries which have hosted the Olympiad. This issue was briefly raised during the 83rd FIDE Congress, and Azad Rahimov noted the country had a positive experience with the Eurovision Song Contest 2012, where all participants could receive a visa on arrival at the airport without any problem. In a similar manner, in April 2016, the President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev signed an order on simplifying the visa procedures for travellers to Azerbaijan in connection with the Chess Olympiad, allowing them to get visas in the country's international airports.|$|E

5|$|Efforts {{had begun}} {{as early as}} 1911 to procure arms and smuggle them into India. When {{a clear idea of}} the {{conspiracy}} emerged, more earnest and elaborate plans were made to obtain arms and to enlist international support. Herambalal Gupta, who had arrived in the United States in 1914 at the Berlin Committee's directives, took over the leadership of American wing of the conspiracy after the failure of the SS Korea mission. Gupta immediately began efforts to obtain men and arms. While men were in plentiful supply with more and more Indians coming forward to join the Ghadarite cause, obtaining arms for the uprising proved to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult.</b>|$|E
5|$|Electrical {{generators}} and alternators are frequently used as portable welding power supplies, {{but because of}} lower efficiency and greater costs, they are less frequently used in industry. Maintenance also tends to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult,</b> because of the complexities of using a combustion engine as a power source. However, in one sense they are simpler: {{the use of a}} separate rectifier is unnecessary because they can provide either AC or DC. However, the engine driven units are most practical in field work where the welding often must be done out of doors and in locations where transformer type welders are not usable because there is no power source available to be transformed.|$|E
5|$|Facing {{a second}} hostage crisis, General Smith {{and other top}} UN commanders began to shift strategy. The UN began redeploying its forces to more {{defensible}} locations, {{so that they would}} be harder to attack and so that it would <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> to take UN personnel hostage. General Michael Rose established the UN Rapid Reaction Force, a heavily armed land unit with more aggressive rules of engagement, designed to take offensive action if necessary to prevent hostage-taking and enforce peace agreements.|$|E

50|$|Though {{cognitive}} interviews {{have been}} shown to yield many positive results, this technique is not without its limitations. The most commonly cited problem regarding cognitive interviews is that they <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> to perform than standard police interviews.

5|$|Genital herpes can <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> to {{diagnose}} than oral herpes, since most HSV-2-infected persons have no classical symptoms. Further confusing diagnosis, several other conditions resemble genital herpes, including fungal infection, lichen planus, atopic dermatitis, and urethritis. Laboratory testing {{is often used}} to confirm a diagnosis of genital herpes. Laboratory tests include culture of the virus, direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) studies to detect virus, skin biopsy, and polymerase chain reaction to test for presence of viral DNA. Although these procedures produce highly sensitive and specific diagnoses, their high costs and time constraints discourage their regular use in clinical practice.|$|E
5|$|In the Multiple Classification Card Sorting Task, {{children}} are shown cards {{and asked to}} sort them based on two different dimensions (e.g. by color, such as yellow and blue, and object type, such as animals and food) simultaneously into four piles within a matrix (e.g. yellow animals, yellow foods, blue animals and blue foods). This task appears to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> as {{research has shown that}} seven-year-old children were incapable of sorting cards based on the two dimensions simultaneously. These children focused on the two dimensions separately, whereas at the age of eleven, children were capable of sorting cards based on these two dimensions simultaneously. This demonstrates an increase in cognitive flexibility between the ages of seven and eleven.|$|E

5|$|Seeds do {{not require}} any {{treatment}} prior to planting, and take 26 to 40 days to germinate. Seeds that grow into yellow-flowered plants are pale and unpigmented, while future bronze- and red-flowered plants are dark greyish and black respectively. It generally takes about {{five to seven years}} to flower from seed. The plant favours sandy well-drained soils and a sunny position and can be heavily pruned if necessary, as new growth can arise from the lignotuber. Although it is readily propagated by seed, experiments with in vitro propagation found Banksia menziesii to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> than other species trialled.|$|E
