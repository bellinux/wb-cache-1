2500|$|In Sufism, Iblis {{is often}} {{depicted}} {{as an example}} of a true lover of God, teacher of oneness despite physical separation and rather a tragically fallen angel than a failed creature. According to a narration from Al-Hallaj, Moses met Iblis on the slopes of Mount Sinai, there he asked him, why he refused God's command to bow before Adam, thereupon he was transformed from an angel into a Satan. Iblis replied, this command was actually not a command but a test, to prove who loves God [...] without expecting anything in return and he would rather go to hell than bow down to something that is not God. And now he refines his love to God through longing. Iblis's function as a devil is therefore regarded as a penalty, which he readily accepts. Abd al-Karīm al-Jīlī stated, Iblis will <b>be</b> <b>back,</b> <b>after</b> the Day of Judgement, as one of his cherished angels.|$|E

I've got the camel tied up there, and he can carry two, being fat and strong after four days' rest with plenty to eat.

5000|$|I {{had this}} idea about making edits {{where all of}} the songs would clock in under 5 minutes each. My {{absolute}} first idea {{was to make a}} radio edit version of the album, where every song would simply be cut at precisely 3:50 or something, except for the track America, in which we instead would add like 10 minutes of commercials after the [...] "We'll <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>after</b> this short break!" [...] phrase. But once I was sitting down with the tracks it became sort of a challenge. Some of the songs I prefer in the original version, but some (like Idiocracy and Mrs Modern Mother Mary for instance) really turned out more like I initially intended them to be, and I prefer them. Also, I could use my original idea for an intro to the album - it was scrapped for the official release since I felt it gave away the TPE1 link way too soon. The Slipsync track uses recurring themes, a trademark POS conceptual instrumental passage, and was originally thought as a Japanese bonus track, but then it felt more right on this edited album version, called SCARSICKER.|$|E
5000|$|Will is troubled {{because his}} dad, Ed, is {{constantly}} angling {{to meet the}} other students' parents and make connections to help his sales business.

Elizabeth finally acknowledges to Melinda that the baby's father left town without marrying her. She now fears that Melinda will be similarly seduced and abandoned, but Will assures both Melinda and Elizabeth that he will <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>after</b> his family leaves town.|$|E
