We needed to get some lift to continue on and to have a pathway forward. That didn't happen.

We must remember that the field of insurance is already largely covered by a great mass of benevolent and friendly societies, just as the field of unemployment insurance is already occupied to some extent by trade unions, and the Government would not approve of any development or extension of the policy of insurance which did not do full justice to existing institutions, or which did not safeguard those institutions, to whom we owe so inestimable and incommensurable a debt, or caused any sudden disturbance or any curtailment of their general methods of business. On the contrary, we believe that when our proposals are put in their full detail before the country, they will be found to benefit and encourage and not to injure those agencies which have so long been voluntarily and prosperously at work.|$|E

You and I, Auberon Quin, have both of us throughout our lives been again and again called mad. And we are mad. We are mad, because we are not two men, but one man. We are mad, because we are two lobes of the same brain, and that brain has been cloven in two. And if you ask for the proof of it, {{it is not hard to}} find. It is not merely that you, the humorist, have been in these dark days stripped of the joy of gravity. It is not merely that I, the fanatic, have had to grope without humour.

6000|$|To-night, {{in taking}} up {{the first part of}} the question, I shall {{endeavour}} to put before you a sort of broad notion of our knowledge of the condition of the living world. There are many ways of doing this. I might deal with it pictorially and graphically. Following the example of Humboldt in his [...] "Aspects of Nature," [...] I might endeavour to point out the infinite variety of organic life in every mode of its existence, with reference to the variations of climate and the like; and such an attempt would be fraught with interest to us all; but considering the subject before us, such a course would not be that best calculated to assist us. In an argument of this kind we must go further and dig deeper into the matter; we must endeavour to look into the foundations of living Nature, if I may so say, and discover the principles involved in some of her most secret operations. I propose, therefore, in the first place, to take some ordinary animal with which you are all familiar, and by easily comprehensible and obvious examples drawn from it, to show what are the kind of problems which living beings in general lay before us; and I shall then show you that the same problems are laid open to us by all kinds of living beings. <b>But,</b> first, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>say</b> in what sense I have used the words [...] "organic nature." [...] In speaking of the causes which lead to our present knowledge of organic nature, I have used it almost as an equivalent of the word [...] "living," [...] and for this reason,--that in almost all living beings you can distinguish several distinct portions set apart to do particular things and work in a particular way. These are termed [...] "organs," [...] and the whole together is called [...] "organic." [...] And as it is universally characteristic of them, the term [...] "organic" [...] has been very conveniently employed to denote the whole of living nature,--the whole of the plant world, and the whole of the animal world.|$|R
40|$|I vividly {{recall a}} {{time in my life}} [...] {{especially}} my late teens and early 				twenties [...] when I thought I could be anyone but had no idea which anyone to be. For 				this I blame (or credit) my liberal arts education, which convinced me that there 				was really nothing I couldn 2 ̆ 7 t master but gave me little or no indication of what I 				should do (beyond platitudes like 2 ̆ 2 discover myself 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 do good 2 ̆ 2). So I thrashed 				about, armed with an ounce of knowledge and a ton of arrogance. I was insufferable. 				I won 2 ̆ 7 t go into details, <b>but</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> just <b>say</b> my quest to discover who I was ended 				rather badly, albeit not in the long term. Life taught me what my liberal arts 				education couldn 2 ̆ 7 t: that I was who I was and not much more. Having read Rosamund 				Bartlett 2 ̆ 7 s excellent Tolstoy: A Russia Life (Houghton Mifflin, 2011), I 2 ̆ 7 m left 				wondering if Tolstoy ever came to this realization. Throughout his life, he searched 				for his true self. His launching pad was not a liberal arts education, but rather an 				aristocratic background, a flock of tutors, and a remarkable talent. The first 				taught Tolstoy that he could do anything he wanted (which was largely true as it 				concerned the serfs that Tolstoy 2 ̆ 7 s family owned); the second gave him the cultural 				tools he needed to conduct his search; and the third gave him the ability to rise 				above all the other Russian aristocrats who were {{trying to figure out what}} they 				should do and where Russia should go. Tolstoy tried on Russian identities the way 				you try on cloths at a department store. He was, by turns, a student, a slacker, 				an enfant terrible, a rake, a soldier, a pianist, a slave master, a gambler, a 				journalist, a teacher, a bee-keeper, a patriarch, a national poet, a peasant, a 				pundit, and a child-of-nature. At the end of his life he became a holy fool, or 				monk, or cult leader [...] take your pick. Some see this identity as his final 				destination, his moment of Buddha-like enlightenment. I don 2 ̆ 7 t think so. Had he lived 				another five years he would have become someone else. Tolstoy [...] perpetual 				adolescent. Thankfully for us, the common thread in his loosely woven life was 				writing. He was a always a writer, and one with preternatural descriptive and 				dramatic gifts. Rosamund Bartlett is also a writer with considerable gifts, which 				explains why her grasp of Tolstoy is so solid and why her ability to vividly portray 				him so great. If you want to know Tolstoy, read Bartlett...|$|R

I believe that if you strip it of its theoretical part it still remains one of the greatest encyclopaedias of biological doctrine that any one man ever brought forth; and I believe that, if you take it as the embodiment of an hypothesis, it is destined to be the guide of biological and psychological speculation for the next three or four generations.|$|R
