In 1993, it was determined this bridge needed to be replaced, with the new bridge opening in 2002. A portion of the old bridge became a fishing pier. In 1998, bonds were issued for improvements {{to all of the}} bridges owned by the commission.

5|$|Prior to {{the current}} bridge, four other bridges have spanned the Indian River Inlet, opened in 1934, 1940, 1952, and 1965, the latter widened by an {{additional}} span added in 1976. All were known informally as the Indian River <b>Inlet</b> <b>Bridge,</b> and all but the first officially were named the Charles W. Cullen Bridge. The 1965 bridge, a steel girder bridge, was subject to scouring from the inlet, leading {{to the need to}} replace it. Initial plans for a tied-arch <b>bridge</b> over the <b>inlet</b> in 2004 were over budget, and 2006 plans for a 1,400-foot (427-meter) cable-stayed bridge were cancelled because of early construction and legal problems. Construction of the current, 2,600-foot (792-meter) bridge began in 2008 as part of a design-build project, with Skanska awarded the contract to build the bridge.

50|$|Indian River Bay {{is a body}} {{of water}} in Sussex County, Delaware. It is part of Delaware's inland bay system, along with Little Assawoman Bay and Rehoboth Bay. Fed by the Indian River at its western end, the bay is {{connected}} to the Atlantic Ocean to the east via the Indian River Inlet. A natural waterway that shifted up and down a two-mile (3.2 km) stretch of the coast until 1928, the inlet was kept in its current location by dredging between 1928 and 1937, and in 1938 was fixed in place by the construction of jetties. The Charles W. Cullen Bridge, commonly known as the Indian River <b>Inlet</b> <b>Bridge,</b> spans the <b>inlet.</b>|$|R

After passing through Frisco the road goes north of the Buxton Woods Coastal Reserve before going through Buxton and passing the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse. Continuing northward it passes through the communities of Avon, Salvo, Waves, and Rodanthe. It crosses the temporary New <b>Inlet</b> <b>bridge</b> (the <b>inlet</b> reopened by Hurricane Irene in 2011) and a few miles north the Herbert C. Bonner <b>bridge</b> over Oregon <b>Inlet,</b> separating Pea Island from Bodie Island. Nearby is the Bodie Island Lighthouse and visitor center. NC 12 then continues north, where it intersects US 64 and US 158 south of the town of Nags Head. NC 12 runs through Nags Head along the Virginia Dare Trail just east of US 158. The road continues north through Kill Devil Hills, Kitty Hawk and Southern Shores. NC 12 enters Corolla along Ocean Trail and continues along the west bank through the town. NC 12 ends just north of Corolla and south of the Currituck Banks National Estuarine Research Reserve.
