40|$|In recent years, {{the concept}} of {{temporal}} association rule (TAR) has been introduced in order {{to solve the problem}} on handling time series by including time expressions into association rules. In real life situations, temporal databases are often appended or updated. Rescanning the complete database every time is impractical while existing incremental mining techniques cannot deal with temporal association rules. In this paper, we propose an incremental algorithm for maintaining temporal association rules with numerical attributes by using the negative <b>border</b> <b>method.</b> The new algorithm has been implemented to support the discoveries of crime patterns in a district of Hong Kong. We have also experimented with another real life database of courier records of a shipping company. The preliminary results show a significant improvement over rerunning TAR algorithm. ...|$|E

40|$|International audienceAim To compare two {{different}} cell count strategies, border and center methods for endothelial assessment during corneal storage. Material and Methods Seven observers determined the endothelial cell density (ECD), {{coefficient of variation}} (CV) of cell area, and percentage hexagonality of 30 organ cultured corneas by the border (contour detection and manual retouch) and center method (indicating cell centers) using Sambacornea analyser. Interobserver variability for ECD and agreement between the two methods was determined. The accuracy of the center method was verified by counting on ten standard photolithographic mosaics (called keratotest) by border (reference method) and center methods, first as fast and next as precise as possible (fast and slow modes respectively) and the time noted. Data between border and center methods was compared using nonparametric paired tests. Results For stored corneas, interobserver variability was ± 9. 6 % (95 %CI [6. 5 - 12. 7]) for <b>border</b> <b>method</b> and ± 9. 3 % (95 %CI[6. 3 - 12. 3]) for center method. ECD [mean±SD (range), median] was [2948 ± 565 (1644 - 3878), 3081] and [2961 ± 568 (1736 - 3914), 3037] respectively and showed excellent correlation (Pearson coefficient r= 0. 998, p< 0. 001). The center method underestimated the CV by a mean 9. 5 % 95 %CI [8. 3 - 10. 7] and overestimated the hexagonality by a mean 2. 5 % (95 %CI [1. 4 - 3. 7]) (p< 0. 001 for both). Precision of indication of cell center influenced only the CV (mean for slow and fast modes being 3. 6 ± 0. 7 % and 7. 4 ± 1. 3 % respectively, p< 0. 001) but was more time consuming (p= 0. 005). Discussion The center method gives accurate and reproducible measurement of ECD and {{is comparable to the}} <b>border</b> <b>method</b> (reference).

40|$|Efficient use {{of water}} in {{irrigated}} agriculture is as important in areas of plentiful water supply {{as it is in}} water-short areas. Much of the water delivered to the farm for irrigation is lost while applying it to the land because of the system management practices followed. Field-water application efficiency is the precentage of water delivered to a field that is stored in the soil within the root zone of the growing crop. Factors affecting field-water application efficiency in irrigation are climate, soil, crop, water supply, topography, method of irrigation, irrigation system design, and irrigation system operation. Water is applied to the land by four general methods: flooding, furrows, sprinkler, and subirrigation. Each of these methods has charactersitic water losses, but all losses can be classified under evaporation, deep percolation, or runoff. Water-application efficiency studies have been conducted at a number of locations in the United States. This paper summarizes a study conducted near Boise, Idaho to compare the field-water appli• cation efficiencies of the furrow, border, contour border, and sprinkler methods of irrigation of crops in a grain-legume rotation on 3 to 5 per cent slopes.

40|$|Recent {{research}} shows initial colonization of potato fields by winged {{green peach aphid}} is concentrated at field edges. This suggests that insecticides applied only to field margins during initial colonization would largely eliminate a colonizing aphid population, conserve natural enemies in the field center, and reduce insecticide use. To better understand {{the costs and benefits}} of reducing organophosphate use, the six participating growers were interviewed to ascertain their reason for participating and their satisfaction with the border only treatment method as well as their estimated net economic benefits. Five of the farms ranked cost reduction as the most important reason for participating. The sixth farm ranked reducing virus spread as the most important reason with cost reduction as their second most important reason. The average cost savings over all 28 participating fields of using the border treatment is estimated to be $ 23. 85 per acre for the entire field-a 93 % savings. Almost all the farmers found the border treatment method to be successful at aphid control. None of the farmers observed any impact on the physical yield of seed potato. All the fields were certified during the summer except for one of Farmer F's fields that was lost because of off type. In conclusion, the border treatment method seems likely to be adopted by many farmers since the potential cost saving is large and farmers dislike Monitor. However, some farmers may resist the method due to scouting requirements and costs. Also, farmers with fields that do not meet the uniformity requirements of the border treatment will not be successful in their use of the <b>border</b> <b>method.</b> Crop Production/Industries,...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} investigates people’s responses when {{access to}} or {{the level of}} local public goods is proposed to or actually changes. By understanding how people respond to potential changes in school assignment, construction of the interstate highway system, and the widening of existing highways, researchers can gain better insight into how to accurately estimate people’s valuation of local public goods and policy makers can pursue effective policies to relieve traffic congestion and mitigate the impact of new highway construction. The first essay examines if information regarding potential school reassignment causes cross-sectional capitalization estimation techniques, most notably the <b>border</b> <b>method,</b> to undervalue people willingness to pay for school quality. Using hedonic regression techniques and home sale data from DeKalb County, Georgia, I find that residents’ expectations of future school quality are important factors in determining the magnitude of school quality capitalization estimates. The second essay explores how {{the construction of the}} interstate highway system impacted agricultural land loss in Georgia. Since agricultural land provides many positive externalities while its loss leads to several negative externalities, the results inform policy makers seeking to preserve agricultural land and study the urban form. Using a historical dataset covering 1945 to 2007, I find that each additional highway mile constructed led to the conversion of 468 acres of agricultural land. Finally, the third essay investigates commuter responses to the widening of existing highways in order {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} road construction as a traffic congestion relief measure. The results indicate that the elasticity for the demand of driving with respect to the road supply is 0. 522 and that it grows over time. Taken together, the result for the estimated elasticity imply that road construction may provide some congestion relief in the short run but eventually the expanded roads will be just as congested as before. The results of the three essays suggest that researchers and policy makers should take into the consideration how people will respond to potential changes to public goods as well as the short and long term impacts on investments in public goods...|$|E

40|$|Lanczos type {{algorithms}} {{for solving}} systems of linear equations have their foundations {{in the theory}} of formal orthogonal polynomials and the method of moments which leads to a determinantal formula for their iterates. The various Lanczos type algorithms mainly differ by the way of computing the coefficients entering into the recurrence formulae. If the denominator in the formula for one of these coefficients is zero, then a breakdown occurs in the algorithm, and it must be stopped. Such a breakdown is in fact due to the non-existence of some orthogonal polynomial. In this paper we show how to jump over such a singularity by computing the next existing orthogonal polynomial by the block <b>bordering</b> <b>method.</b> The resulting algorithm, called MRZ, is equivalent to the nongeneric BIODIR algorithm (which is a look-ahead Lanczos type algorithm), but our derivation is much simpler...|$|R
