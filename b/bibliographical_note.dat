50|$|There is {{a mistake}} in the Grand dictionnaire universel du XIXe siècle {{published}} by Pierre Larousse.

However, {{with the exception of}} the Calcul des chances et philosophie de la bourse, all the other books were written by Jean-Joseph Regnault (1797-1863) who signed some of his books “J. Regnault”. This signature can explain the mistake. However, these two authors have no family relationship. The Catalogue général de la librairie française published in 1871 made the same mistake.|$|E
