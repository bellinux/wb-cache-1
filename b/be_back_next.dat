500|$|At {{the start}} of the 2009–10 season, Filatov made the Blue Jackets roster after {{training}} camp. Although healthy, he did not play in six of the team's first 18 games, a decision made by Columbus Head Coach Ken Hitchcock. Filatov was unhappy with his playing time and role on the team under Hitchcock and requested to be transferred back to his Russian club team. Hitchcock and the Blue Jackets coaching staff tried to improve Filatov's attention to defensive aspects of the game. [...] The Blue Jackets management agreed to Filatov's request to return to Russia {{for the remainder of the}} season. This arrangement resulted from direct dealings between the Blue Jackets and CSKA Moscow, where Filatov's salary was paid by the Russian club, and the Blue Jackets retained his rights. Shortly after his return to Russia, Filatov set a KHL record by scoring the game-winning goal in three consecutive games. He was named the League's best newcomer (defined by the KHL as [...] "a player born in 1987 or later, who has played no more than 20 top-level matches in previous national tournaments") for November, and the League's best rookie for the 11th week of the season. In his shortened season in Russia, Filatov played 26 games, scoring nine goals and adding 13 assists. Initial statements by both sides indicated the player would return to Columbus after the 2009–10 season, but since returning to Russia, Filatov has been less clear about his intentions for the 2010–11 season, stating, [...] "I hope I'll <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>next</b> year, but right now, it's really hard to say because it will again be a tough decision." [...] Howson did not comment on Filatov's stance, except to say that he expects Filatov to be at the team's training camp prior to the 2010–11 season. Subsequently, Filatov stated after the 2009–10 season that he intended to return to Columbus for training camp.|$|E

2500|$|On January 13, 2013, the President of The CW Mark Pedowitz {{stated that}} though 90210 doesn't have a season 6 renewal in place, the show {{would most likely}} <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>next</b> year (possibly for the final season {{if it were to}} be canceled) due to him being a [...] "big believer in giving fans a very {{satisfactory}} conclusion" [...] for a long-running show. However, on February 28, 2013 The CW Entertainment President, Mark Pedowitz, announced that 90210 would end its run after five seasons and 114 episodes.|$|E

Its unaccountable disappearance during his absence in another room did much to mar the harmony of an otherwise perfect day. First of all he searched the house from top to bottom; then, screwing up his features, he beckoned quietly to Mrs. Chinnery.|$|R
2500|$|However, {{the origin}} of the [...] "Deacon" [...] {{nickname}} appears to date back to 1896. [...] In February of that year, The Sporting Life, a national baseball newspaper, reported a dispatch from Michigan that McGuire [...] "has experienced religion at a revival meeting and is thinking of giving up baseball and devote his time to preaching, perhaps." [...] The Sporting Life closed with this observation: [...] " [...] If Mac felt bent on doing missionary work his duty is to remain right where he is. But he will <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>next</b> April doing just as brilliant work behind the bat as last year. He will have no redress, however, if he is addressed hereafter as 'Deacon' McGuire." ...|$|E
2500|$|On April Fools' Day, Alain Vigneault {{returned}} to Vancouver with the New York Rangers. The Rangers won 3–1, damaging the Canucks' playoff hopes. A few days later, Mike Gillis was interviewed on TSN 1040 radio. He said: [...] "I {{am not sure}} I'll <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>next</b> season." [...] On April 7, in a game which saw the Ducks up 3–0 against the Canucks with three minutes remaining in the game, fans starting chanting [...] "Fire Gillis". The loss officially ended Vancouver's five-year playoff streak. Mike Gillis was fired the next day. Trevor Linden, a former Canucks winger, replaced Gillis as president of hockey operations, though the team still needed {{to find a new}} general manager. After nineteen consecutive starts, Läck was replaced in goal by Jacob Markstrom for the final three games. On April 12, after a 5–2 loss to the Oilers, Ryan Smyth announced his retirement. On {{the last day of the}} regular season, Daniel Sedin was hit by Paul Byron and left the ice on a stretcher with minor injuries. The Canucks went on to win 5–1. The Canucks ended the 2013–14 season with a 36–35–11 record.|$|E
2500|$|Matt Fowler of IGN rated it 6 out of 10 in his review: [...] "It {{crossed a}} line, {{but not one}} of gore. Or death, even. Not necessarily. It {{basically}} broke the final shred of trust in the show to service characters over gimmickry." [...] Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club gave the episode a C-, the lowest grade given by the website to the show thus far: [...] "The show is so stupid that it thinks we're stupid, prays we're stupid; cross its fingers and hopes like hell that its legion of loyal, obsessive followers will rend their garments at the horrible death of a fan favorite, but still <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>next</b> week." [...] According to Stuart Jeffries of The Guardian, [...] "This was, to put it mildly, uncomfortable viewing: 45-plus minutes of torture porn mingled with something even more unpalatable ... this wasn't so much entertainment as psychic evisceration for us." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of Vox wrote, [...] "I've {{had a lot of}} issues with The Walking Dead of late — especially with that genuinely terrible season six finale — but I probably still would have called myself, in general, a “fan” of the show until tonight". Brian Lowry from CNN also criticized the episode: [...] "Nevertheless, its most admirable qualities have increasingly been overshadowed by its more distasteful ones -- not merely in demonstrating just how brutal humanity can be, but by toying with its audience." [...] Jeff Stone of IndieWire wrote in his review, [...] "It was miserable, and tedious, and made me feel bad. Not in an emotionally compelling way, just in a 'I could be watching something of value' way", and he graded the episode D-. Kristi Turnquist of The Oregonian was also critical: [...] "The most shocking reveal was just how low executive producer and showrunner Scott M. Gimple and [...] "Walking Dead" [...] comics creator Robert Kirkman are willing to go for the sake of sensationalism and torture porn." ...|$|E

60|$|My dearest Miss Mitford,--I {{am quite}} in pain {{to have to}} write a {{farewell}} to you after all. As soon as Wilson had returned--and she stayed away much longer than last year--we found ourselves pushed {{to the edge of}} our time for remaining in England, and the accumulation of business to be done before we could go pressed on us. I am almost mad with the amount of things to be done, as it is; but I should have put the visit to you at the head of them, and swept all the rest on one side for a day, if it hadn't been for the detestable weather, and my horrible cough which combines with it. When Wilson came back she found me coughing in my old way, and it has been without intermission up to now, or rather waxing worse and worse. To have gone down to you and inflicted the noise of it on you would have simply made you nervous, while the risk to myself would have been very great indeed. Still, I have waited and waited, feeling it scarcely possible to write to you to say, 'I am not coming this year.' Ah, I am so very sorry and disappointed! I hoped against hope for a break in the weather, and an improvement in myself; now we must go, and there is no hope. For about a fortnight I have been a prisoner in the house. This climate won't let me live, there's the truth. So we are going on Monday. We go to Paris for a week or two, and then to Florence, and then to Rome, and then to Naples; but we shall <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>next</b> year, if God pleases, and then I shall seize an early summer day to run down straight to you and find you stronger, if God blesses me so far. Think of me and love me a little meanwhile. I shall do it by you. And do, do--since there is no time to hear from you in London--send a fragment of a note to Arabel for me, that I may have it in Paris before we set out on our long Italian journey. Let me have the comfort of knowing exactly how you are before we set out. As for me, I expect to be better on crossing the Channel. How people manage to live and enjoy life in this fog and cold is inexplicable to me. I understand the system of the American rapping spirits considerably better....|$|E
