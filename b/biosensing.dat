This collaborative data exchange system allows users to track health issues as they evolve. <b>BioSense</b> 2. 0 is the only public health tool that provides a picture of what is happening right now with any health condition, anywhere and everywhere in the country. <b>BioSense</b> 2. 0 pulls together information on emergency department visits and hospitalizations from multiple sources, including the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), the Department of Defense (DoD), and civilian hospitals from around the country. The <b>BioSense</b> program works with state or local health departments that have agreed to share data from their own emergency department monitoring systems to collect data from civilian hospitals. Analysis of these data provides insight into the health of communities and the country. Such data are vital to guide decision making and actions by public health agencies at local, regional, and national levels. <b>BioSense</b> 2. 0 was developed and is governed by an active collaboration of CDC, state and local health departments, and other public health partners.

40|$|ObjectiveTo {{conduct an}} initial {{examination}} of the potential use of <b>BioSense</b> data to monitor and rapidly assess the safety of medical countermeasures (MCM) used for prevention or treatment of adverse health effects of biological, chemical, and radiation exposures during a public health emergency. IntroductionBioSense is a national human health surveillance system for disease detection, monitoring, and situation awareness through near real-time access to existing electronic healthcare encounter information, including information from hospital emergency departments (EDs). MCM include antibiotics, antivirals, antidotes, antitoxins, vaccinations, nuclide-binding agents, and other medications. Although some MCM have been extensively evaluated and have FDA approval, many do not (1). Current FDA and CDC systems that monitor drug and vaccine safety have limited ability to monitor MCM safety, and in particular to conduct rapid assessments during an emergency (1). MethodsTo provide a preliminary assessment {{of the use of}} <b>BioSense</b> for this purpose, we reviewed selected publications evaluating the use of electronic health records (EHRs) to monitor safety of drugs and vaccinations (medications), focusing particularly on systematic reviews, reviewed <b>BioSense</b> data elements, and consulted with a number of subject matter experts. ResultsMore than 40 studies have examined use of EHR data to monitor adverse effects (AEs) of medications using administrative, laboratory, and pharmacy records from inpatient- and out-patient settings, including EDs (222 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 c 4). To identify AEs, investigators have used diagnostic codes; administration of antidotes, laboratory measures of drug levels and of biologic response, text searches of unstructured clinical notes, and combinations of those data elements. <b>BioSense</b> ED data include chief complaint text, triage notes, text diagnosis, as well as diagnostic and medical procedure codes. ConclusionsThese findings suggest that <b>BioSense</b> data could potentially contribute to rapid identification of safety issues for MCM and that some methods from published research could be applicable to the use of <b>BioSense</b> for this purpose. However, such use would require careful development and evaluation...|$|R

The concept of a grid of computing resources originated in the 1970 ’s, and has re-emerged in the 90 ’s and this century as computing power, networks and middleware capabilities advanced to support it. Grid computing can provide a powerful backbone for healthcare research issues. However, establishing a grid {{is not just a}} matter of clustering large numbers of disks or blade servers, nor is it a solution for every public health issue. Grid-like resource usage can enable systems not typically associated with massively parallelizable problems to achieve higher levels of availability and reliability. This presentation will review the basics of grid architecture (i. e. grid computing, grid storage, grid collaboration) and existing uses in public health (for example, caBIG™), potential future uses relative to biosurveillance systems such as <b>BioSense,</b> and the pros and cons of introducing grid models in this arena.
