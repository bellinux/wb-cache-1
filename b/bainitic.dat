[...] This microstructure was found to be [...] "tougher for the same hardness than tempered Martensite". Commercial exploitation of <b>bainitic</b> steel did not become common overnight. Common heat treating practices at the time featured continuous cooling methods and were not capable, in practice, of producing fully <b>Bainitic</b> microstructures. The range of alloys available produced either mixed microstructures or excessive amounts of Martensite. The advent of low-carbon steels containing boron and molybdenum in 1958 allowed fully <b>Bainitic</b> steel to be produced by continuous cooling.

50|$|Bainite is an {{intermediate}} of pearlite and martensite {{in terms of}} hardness.

50|$|Austempering is a {{hardening}} {{process that is}} used on iron-based metals to promote better mechanical properties. The metal is heated into the austenite region of the iron-cementite phase diagram and then quenched in a salt bath or other heat extraction medium that is between temperatures of 300 - 375 C. The metal is annealed in this temperature range until the austenite turns to bainite or ausferrite (<b>bainitic</b> ferrite + high-carbon austenite).|$|E

50|$|The {{diffusive}} {{theory of}} bainite's transformation process {{is based on}} the assumption that a <b>bainitic</b> ferrite plate grows with a similar mechanism as Widmanstätten ferrite at higher temperatures. Its growth rate thus depends on how rapildy carbon can diffuse from the growing ferrite into the austenite. A common misconception is that this mechanism excludes the possibility of coherent interfaces and a surface relief. In fact it is accepted that formation of Widmanstätten ferrite is controlled by carbon diffusion and do show a similar surface relief.|$|E
50|$|Early {{research}} on bainite found {{that at a}} given temperature only a certain volume fraction of the austenite would transform to bainite with the remainder decomposing to pearlite after an extended delay. This was the case {{despite the fact that}} a complete austenite to pearlite transformation could be achieved at higher temperatures where the austenite was more stable. The fraction of bainite that could form increased as the temperature decreased. This was ultimately explained by accounting for the fact that when the <b>bainitic</b> ferrite formed the supersaturated carbon would be expelled to the surrounding austenite thus thermodynamically stabilising it against further transformation.|$|E
5000|$|One of the {{theories}} on the specific formation mechanism for bainite is that it occurs by a shear transformation, as in martensite. The transformation is said to cause a stress-relieving effect, which is confirmed by the orientation relationships present in <b>bainitic</b> microstructures. [...] There are, however, similar stress-relief effects seen in transformations that are {{not considered to be}} martensitic in nature, but the term 'similar' does not imply identical. The relief associated with bainite is an invariant—plane strain with a large shear component. The only diffusion that occurs by this theory is during the formation of the carbide phase (usually cementite) between the ferrite plates.|$|E

50|$|Bainite {{occupies}} a region {{between these two}} process in a temperature range where iron self-diffusion is limited but there is insufficient driving force to form martensite. In contrast to pearlite, where the ferrite and cementite grow cooperatively, bainite forms by the transformation of carbon-supersaturated ferrite with the subsequent diffusion of carbon and the precipitation of carbides. A further distinction is often made between so-called lower-bainite, which forms at temperatures closer to the martensite start temperature, and upper-bainite which forms at higher temperatures. This distinction arises from the diffusion rates of carbon at the temperature at which the bainite is forming. If the temperature is high then the carbon will diffuse rapidly away from the newly formed ferrite and form carbides in the carbon-enriched residual austenite between the ferritic plates leaving them carbide-free. At low temperatures the carbon will diffuse more sluggishly and may precipitate before it can leave the <b>bainitic</b> ferrite. There is some controversy over the specifics of bainite's transformation mechanism; both theories are represented below.|$|E

However, compared with the base steel, combined addition of Cr and Al has no significant effect on <b>bainitic</b> transformation and properties.

However up to present a significant disagreement exists regarding the nature and the mechanism of this phase transformation.

40|$|The {{relatively}} good combination of high {{strength and ductility}} makes <b>bainitic</b> steels a candidate to replace many other steels in industrial applications.

In the present study, <b>bainitic</b> steels with varying content of boron were fabricated, {{with the aim of}} analyzing the fracture toughness and changes in the fatigue life. The results show that a relatively small change in the boron content can cause a notable variation in the fracture toughness of <b>bainitic</b> steels. The maximum value obtained in fracture toughness was for the steel with the highest boron content.
