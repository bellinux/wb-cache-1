5|$|Some {{eukaryotic}} protozoa such as Leishmania {{major and}} Trypanosoma cruzi lack the RNAi pathway entirely. Most {{or all of}} the components are also missing in some fungi, most notably the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The presence of RNAi in other <b>budding</b> <b>yeast</b> species such as Saccharomyces castellii and Candida albicans, further demonstrates that inducing two RNAi-related proteins from S. castellii facilitates RNAi in S. cerevisiae. That certain ascomycetes and basidiomycetes are missing RNA interference pathways indicates that proteins required for RNA silencing have been lost independently from many fungal lineages, possibly due to the evolution of a novel pathway with similar function, or to the lack of selective advantage in certain niches.|$|E
5|$|Essential {{genes are}} {{the set of}} genes thought to be {{critical}} for an organism's survival. This definition assumes the abundant availability of all relevant nutrients {{and the absence of}} environmental stress. Only a small portion of an organism's genes are essential. In bacteria, an estimated 250–400 genes are essential for Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, which is less than 10% of their genes. Half of these genes are orthologs in both organisms and are largely involved in protein synthesis. In the <b>budding</b> <b>yeast</b> Saccharomyces cerevisiae the number of essential genes is slightly higher, at 1000 genes (~20% of their genes). Although the number is more difficult to measure in higher eukaryotes, mice and humans are estimated to have around 2000 essential genes (~10% of their genes). The synthetic organism, Syn 3, has a minimal genome of 473 essential genes and quasi-essential genes (necessary for fast growth), although 149 have unknown function.|$|E

25|$|The simple {{observation}} that cells {{of a given}} type are similar in size, {{and the question of}} how this similarity is maintained, has long fascinated cell biologists. The study of cell size control in <b>budding</b> <b>yeast</b> began in earnest in the mid 1970s, when the regulation of the <b>budding</b> <b>yeast</b> cell cycle was first being elucidated by Lee Hartwell and colleagues. Seminal work in 1977 found that yeast cells maintain a constant size by delaying their entry into the cell cycle (as assayed by budding) until they have grown to a threshold size. Later worked refined this result to show that Start specifically, rather than some other aspect of the G1-S transition, is controlled by the size threshold.|$|E

40|$|Accurate {{chromosome}} segregation requires centromeres (CENs), the DNA sequences where kinetochores form, to attach chromosomes to microtubules. In contrast to most eukaryotes, which have broad centromeres, Saccharomyces cerevisiae possesses sequence-defined point CENs. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-Seq) reveals colocalization of four kinetochore proteins at novel, discrete, non-centromeric regions, especially when {{levels of the}} centromeric histone H 3 variant, Cse 4 (a. k. a. CENP-A or CenH 3), are elevated. These regions of overlapping protein binding enhance the segregation of plasmids and chromosomes and have thus been termed Centromere-Like Regions (CLRs). CLRs form {{in close proximity to}} S. cerevisiae CENs and share characteristics typical of both point and regional CENs.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focus on}} one fundamental question: Does it matter where a gene reside on a chromosome? To answer this question, we further asked two questions that are more lineage-specific: Could the large-scale patterns of genome organization across animal species give us new insights to the underling mechanisms of genome evolution? Is there any kind of universal evolutionary patterns of genome organization among yeasts? To answer the first question, we developed a simple model of genome evolution that can explain conservation of macrosynteny (chromosome-scale gene linkage relationships) across diverse metazoan species. Many metazoan genomes preserve macrosynteny from the common ancestor of multi-cellular animal life, but the evolutionary mechanism responsible for this conservation is still unknown. We show that a simple model of genome evolution, in which Double Cut and Join (DCJ) moves are allowed only if they maintain chromosomal linkage among a set of constrained genes, can simultaneously account for the level of macrosynteny conservation observed from pair wise genome comparison and for correlated conservation among multiple species. Results from biological correlation tests prove dosage-sensitive genes are good candidates for these constrained genes and thus suggest that constraints on gene dosage may have acted over long evolutionary timescales to constrain chromosomal reorganization in metazoan genomes. For the second question, we found that fission yeasts show highly conserved genome architecture, compared to <b>budding</b> <b>yeasts.</b> Despite similar rates of sequence divergence, both gene contents and genome organizations are much more conserved in fission <b>yeasts</b> than in <b>budding</b> <b>yeasts.</b> The rate of gene order divergence in fission yeasts is about four times slower than that of <b>budding</b> <b>yeasts.</b> Also, comparing to <b>budding</b> <b>yeasts,</b> gene duplication events among fission yeasts are more synchronized, mainly limited to fewer function categories and significantly enriched in the subtelomeric regions of chromosomes. These results suggested that highly conserved genome organization and lack of gene content innovation might play important roles in constraining the species diversification within fission yeasts. This dissertation established an innovative computational framework for efficiently developing models of genome evolution based on observed patterns from real genome comparisons. Also, it revealed comprehensive evolutionary patterns of genome organization across yeast species and provided insights into {{the relative importance of}} point mutations and large-scale genetic rearrangements as sources of functional innovations and biodiversity...|$|R

40|$|The genetically defined point centromeres of <b>budding</b> <b>yeasts</b> and the epigenetically {{specified}} regional centromeres of {{all other}} eukaryotes harbor a common epigenetic mark {{in the form of}} a non-standard nucleosome. Although, the composition of the protein core of the centromere specific nucleosome and the nature of the DNA wrap around it are at present controversial, there is no doubt that this specialized nucleosome harbors a variant of the standard histone H 3 (cenH 3). The association of cenH 3, called Cse 4 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, with the partitioning locus (STB) of the high copy selfish plasmid 2 micron circle that resides in the yeast nucleus and propagates itself stably is intriguing. Recent observations are consistent with Cse 4 being a nucleosome component at STB.

25|$|The CLN3 gene was {{originally}} {{identified as the}} whi1-1 allele in a screen for small size mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (for Cln3's role in size control, see below). This screen {{was inspired by a}} similar study in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, in which the Wee1 gene was identified as an inhibitor of cell cycle progression that maintained normal cell size. Thus, the WHI1 gene was at first thought to perform a size control function analogous to that of Wee1 in pombe. However, it was later found that WHI1 was in fact a positive regulator of Start, as its deletion caused cells to delay in G1 and grow larger than wild-type cells. The original WHI1-1 allele (changed from whi1-1 because it is a dominant allele) in fact contained a nonsense mutation that removed a degradation-promoting PEST sequence from the Whi1 protein and thus accelerated G1 progression. WHI1 was furthermore found to be a cyclin homologue, and it was shown that simultaneous deletion of WHI1—renamed CLN3—and the previously identified G1 cyclins, CLN1 and CLN2, caused permanent G1 arrest. This showed that the three G1 cyclins were responsible for controlling Start entry in <b>budding</b> <b>yeast.</b>|$|E

The mechanism of the drug's action is still to be defined, {{even though it has}} been clearly demonstrated the key role of Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER). To get further insights into the drug's mode of action, we studied the involvement of the DNA-double strand break repair (DNA-DSB) pathways: homologous and non-homologous recombination, both in <b>budding</b> <b>yeasts</b> and in mammalian cells and the possible cross-talk between NER and these repair pathways. <b>Budding</b> <b>yeasts</b> and mammalian cells deficient in the non-homologous end-joining pathway were moderately sensitive to trabectedin, while systems deficient in the homologous recombination pathway were extremely sensitive to the drug, with a 100 -fold decrease in the IC 50, suggesting that trabectedin-induced lesions are repaired by this pathway. The induction of Rad 51 foci and the appearance of gamma-H 2 AX were chosen as putative markers for DNA-DSBs and were studied at different time points after trabectedin treatment in NER proficient and deficient systems.

25|$|Since {{replication}} machineries do {{not move}} relatively to template DNAs such as factories, they are called a replication factory. In an alternative figure, DNA factories are similar to projectors and DNAs are like as cinematic films passing constantly into the projectors. In the replication factory model, after both DNA helicases for leading strands and lagging strands are loaded on the template DNAs, the helicases run along the DNAs into each other. The helicases remain associated {{for the remainder of}} replication process. Peter Meister et al. observed directly replication sites in <b>budding</b> <b>yeast</b> by monitoring green fluorescent protein(GFP)-tagged DNA polymerases α. They detected DNA replication of pairs of the tagged loci spaced apart symmetrically from a replication origin and found that the distance between the pairs decreased markedly by time. This finding suggests that the mechanism of DNA replication goes with DNA factories. That is, couples of replication factories are loaded on replication origins and the factories associated with each other. Also, template DNAs move into the factories, which bring extrusion of the template ssDNAs and nascent DNAs. Meister’s finding is the first direct evidence of replication factory model. Subsequent research has shown that DNA helicases form dimers in many eukaryotic cells and bacterial replication machineries stay in single intranuclear location during DNA synthesis.|$|E
500|$|In <b>budding</b> <b>yeast</b> Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Holliday {{junctions}} can {{be resolved}} by four different pathways that account for essentially all Holliday junction resolution in vivo. [...] The pathway that produces the majority of crossovers in S. cerevisiae <b>budding</b> <b>yeast,</b> and possibly in mammals, involves proteins EXO1, MLH1-MLH3 heterodimer (called MutL gamma) and SGS1 (ortholog of Bloom syndrome helicase). [...] The MLH1-MLH3 heterodimer binds preferentially to Holliday junctions. [...] It is an endonuclease that makes single-strand breaks in supercoiled double-stranded DNA. [...] The MLH1-MLH3 heterodimer promotes the formation of crossover recombinants. [...] While the other three pathways, involving proteins MUS81-MMS4, SLX1 and YEN1, respectively, can promote Holliday junction resolution in vivo, absence of all three nucleases has only a modest impact on formation of crossover products.|$|E
