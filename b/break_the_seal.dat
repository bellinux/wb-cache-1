5|$|From 1277, Stratton {{acted in}} the {{capacity}} as Countess Isabella's steward, though he never officially used that title. It was in this post that he committed {{some of his most}} grievous offences. In 1278 he was accused of cutting off the seal of a charter from Quarr Abbey, thereby invalidating its authenticity. As a result, several other similar cases were brought to light, but none led to conviction. It was widely believed that he had bought himself off with bribes. Stratton's transgressions continued however, and by the late 1280s the complaints reached King Edward I. Edward returned from a prolonged stay in Gascony in late 1289, and immediately started a purge of corruption in the royal administration, including proceedings against Ralph de Hengham, Chief Justice of the King's Bench. Stratton was relieved of his office of chamberlain, along with his temporal possessions, on 17 January 1290. On his arrest, £12,666 17s 7d was found in his possession, a vast sum at the time, equivalent to about £ in present-day terms. According to the chronicle of Bartholomew Cotton, a silk-lined chest was also discovered, containing fingernail and toenail clippings, women's pubic hair, and feet of toads and moles. These were considered the ingredients of witchcraft, and the box was sealed up by officials, but Stratton managed to <b>break</b> <b>the</b> <b>seal</b> and throw the contents down a latrine.|$|E
5|$|Link is told by {{the priest}} in the {{sanctuary}} that Agahnim, a wizard who has usurped the throne, is planning to break a seal made {{hundreds of years ago}} by the Seven Sages. The seal was placed to imprison a dark wizard named Ganon in the Dark World, a near-mirror of Hyrule which was once known as the Sacred Realm before Ganon invaded it, obtained the legendary Triforce held there, and used its power to turn the realm into a land of darkness. Agahnim intends to <b>break</b> <b>the</b> <b>seal</b> by sending the descendants of the Seven Sages who made the seal into the Dark World. The only thing that can defeat Agahnim is the Master Sword, a sword that can only be wielded by the chosen hero and forged to combat evil. To prove that he is worthy to wield it, Link needs three magic pendants, hidden in dungeons guarded by mythical defenders. On his way to retrieve the first, he meets an elder, Sahasrahla, who becomes Link's mentor, offering hints and advice at key stages of the journey. After retrieving the pendants, Link takes them to the resting place of the Master Sword. As Link draws the sword from its pedestal, Zelda telepathically calls him to the Sanctuary, informing him that soldiers of Hyrule Castle have arrived. Link arrives at the Sanctuary moments after the soldiers have vacated, where he learns from the dying Sanctuary keeper that Zelda has been taken to Hyrule Castle. Link goes to rescue her but arrives too late; Agahnim sends Zelda to the Dark World. Link then faces Agahnim in battle and defeats him, but Agahnim's last act is to send Link to the Dark World as well.|$|E

25|$|The last {{missing in}} {{this list of}} saints is St. John Sarkander (Czech Jan Sarkander), whose statue (holding a lily {{as a symbol of}} purity) is on the second stage. John Sarkander was a priest who was {{tortured}} to death in Olomouc prison {{in the beginning of the}} Thirty Years' War, because he, as the legend says, refused to <b>break</b> <b>the</b> <b>seal</b> of confession. The decision to place him here violated the tradition, since Sarkander had not been canonized and not even beatified in that time yet, which could have resulted in problems with the Holy See. However, his following was so strong here that the craftsmen decided to take the risk. Sarkander was beatified in 1859 and canonized in 1995 on the occasion of the visit of Pope John Paul II in Olomouc.|$|E
25|$|The Dragon God was a {{biological}} plasma machine {{created by the}} Dragonian race that existed in an alternate universe, where the Reptites survived and became the dominant race on Earth. When the city Dinopolis was sucked into the same dimension as Chronopolis, a battle ensued. In the end, the Dragonians lost the war, their city sunk into the sea, and the Dragon God itself was splintered into six beings, which became the Dragon gods that were sealed over the islands. Some like the Sky Dragon and the Water Dragon were worshiped as deities while others receded into hiding. They used Serge and his party to destroy FATE so they could <b>break</b> <b>the</b> <b>seal</b> and become one again. They created Harle to ensure it, though she was reluctant. However, {{it was revealed that}} the Dragon God was absorbed by the Time Devourer long ago during its separation.|$|E

25|$|After rendezvousing with Chester, {{the party}} meets Trinicus D. Morrison, {{one of the}} four heroes who sealed Dhaos away years ago, who reveals that their parents were once his comrades and is shocked to {{discover}} that Cress and Mint's pendants were stolen. Following him to a nearby mausoleum, the group encounters Mars just as he uses the pendants to <b>break</b> <b>the</b> <b>seal</b> on Dhaos's tomb, setting him free. As Mars is killed by the dark sorcerer after asking for his power, Trinicus laments that no force in this time can possibly stop Dhaos, and uses his magic to send Cress and Mint back through time to seek out a means to do so while Chester stays behind to cover their escape. The two arrive one hundred years in the past to a time before Dhaos was initially sealed, where the villain is currently waging a war with his demon armies against the human kingdoms. Learning that only magic can harm him, they seek the aid of a young mage named Arche Klein, and summoner named Claus F. Lester, who accompany them to Dhaos's castle. After a fierce showdown, Dhaos escapes once again, and the party makes their way to an ancient city called Thor that houses a functional time machine to return to the future.|$|E

500|$|... is {{the mother}} of the series' protagonist, Naruto Uzumaki and the wife of the Fourth Hokage, Minato Namikaze. She is a host of Kurama, {{immediately}} preceding Naruto. While Naruto physically resembles his father, Minato, he inherits most of his personality from Kushina, who is brash, temperamental, likes ramen, and even has the [...] verbal tic, which both her son and grandson inherit. Being a member of the Uzumaki Clan, Kushina possesses a special chakra that was distinguished even among her peers, causing her to be sent from her homeland to Konohagakure to be the host of Kurama, replacing Mito Uzumaki. In Konohagakure, Kushina met with Minato who became Kushina's love after he saved her from a kidnapper, leading to their marriage. During her pregnancy, she had to be sent to a secretive place during labor to prevent Kurama's seal being broken. However, the place was subdued by Obito Uchiha, and he released Kurama who ran rampant on Konoha. She and Minato both sacrifice their lives to seal Kurama to Naruto after the tailed beast is weakened from losing his yin-chakra, while also placing some of their chakra to their son as a fail-safe if he would <b>break</b> <b>the</b> <b>seal.</b> In Part II, Kushina's chakra appears during Naruto's subconscious battle with Kurama, helping her son to seal the fox and to tell him the truth behind Kurama's attack sixteen years ago. Before disappearing, she thanks Naruto for forgiving her about the whole ordeal of the sealing of Kurama. In the Japanese anime, Kushina is voiced by Emi Shinohara. She was voiced by Cindy Robinson in the English version before Laura Bailey took over the role since episode 246 and onwards.|$|E

2500|$|Bullet pullers {{are also}} used to {{disassemble}} loaded ammunition of questionable provenance or undesirable configuration, so that the components can be salvaged for re-use. [...] Surplus military ammunition is often pulled for components, particularly the cartridge cases, which are often difficult to obtain for older foreign military rifles. [...] Military ammunition is often tightly sealed, to make it resistant to water and rough handling, such as in machine gun feeding mechanisms. [...] In this case, the seal between the bullet and cartridge can prevent the bullet puller from functioning.
