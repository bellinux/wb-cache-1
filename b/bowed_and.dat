25|$|The {{earliest}} {{image of}} a musical ensemble is found on the 8th century Borobudur temple, Central Java. Musical instruments such as the bamboo flute, bells, drums in various sizes, lute, and <b>bowed</b> <b>and</b> plucked string instruments were identified in this image. However it lacks metallophones and xylophones. Nevertheless, the image of this musical ensemble is suggested to be the ancient form of the gamelan.|$|E
25|$|The {{painting}} {{depicts a}} jack pine as a decorative and abstracted pattern, its shapes boldly simplified against the sunset. This stylization demonstrates Thomson's command of decorative effects, developed {{during his years}} as a graphic designer, and with the strong colour and value contrasts, creates the picture's symbolic resonance. The pine, its branches <b>bowed</b> <b>and</b> placed to the right of centre, extends nearly the full length of the canvas, and is cropped at the top. It rises from a rocky foreground; the hardy jack pine often takes root on shores hostile to other trees, its sparsely leaved branches forming eccentric shapes. It is silhouetted against water and sky, with the canvas bisected by the far shore.|$|E
25|$|A {{full-length}} portrait {{sculpture of}} Junípero Serra {{is on the}} property of the mission. The cast stone sculpture, by Arthur Putnam, was completed in 1909, cast between 1916–1917 and installed in 1918 when the mission was remodeled. Funding for the piece came from D.J. McQuarry and it cost $500 to cast. It is approximately H. 6ft. 6 in. The sculpture depicts Serra wearing a monk's robe belted at the waist with a knotted rope and a rosary around his neck. He looks down, with his head <b>bowed</b> <b>and</b> eyes downward. The sculpture is on a concrete base. It is {{one of a series of}} allegorical figures commissioned by the estate of E. W. Scripps to depict California history. In 1993 it was examined by the Smithsonian Institution's Save Outdoor Sculpture! program. The program determined that the sculpture was well maintained.|$|E

50|$|Throughout {{the history}} of Bhutan, fire <b>and</b> the <b>bow</b> <b>and</b> arrow were an {{important}} means of survival in the highlands during war and on hunts. The <b>bow</b> <b>and</b> arrow {{play a significant role}} in many Bhutanese myths and legends; images of the gods holding a <b>bow</b> <b>and</b> arrows are considered especially favorable. Symbolic and religious significance of the <b>bow</b> <b>and</b> arrow is associated with the legendary murder of Tibetan King Langdarma in the 10th century. The king had persecuted Buddhism, and thus failed to perform his duty as he made mischief. A Buddhist monk, Lhalung Pelgi Dorji, performed the Black Hat Dance to entertain the king, during which he feigned a bow before the king, drew a <b>bow</b> <b>and</b> arrow hidden in the big sleeves of a ceremonial dance costume, and killed the king.|$|R
25|$|Standing {{slightly}} {{forward of}} Royal Crescent {{immediately to the}} east, the building now known as Royal Crescent Mansions was originally built as a two-storey house in the early 19th century. Former Foreign Secretary and Prime Minister George Canning once lived there; this is commemorated by a heritage plaque designed by Eric Gill in the 1920s. Extension to five storeys and conversion into a hotel began in 1848, and it opened in its new form in 1857. Some remodelling took place later in the 19th century. The sea-facing façade has a three-window range: from left to right, canted, <b>bowed</b> <b>and</b> canted. Iron balconies span the second, third and fourth floors. The building has nine windows on each floor on its west façade, next to Royal Crescent, and eleven to the east (facing Burlington Street). After many years as a hotel, it was converted to flats.|$|E
25|$|After another {{injury to}} Almunia in early April 2008, Lehmann {{was back in}} goal for the away game against Manchester United on 13 April 2008. Arsenal lost that game 2–1, {{virtually}} ending their Premier League title hopes for the season, their third consecutive season without a major trophy. There was speculation that {{would be his last}} game for Arsenal, but on 19 April Lehmann played in the home game against Reading, which Arsenal won 2–0. The following week, Łukasz Fabiański was given his Premier League debut against Derby County and Almunia returned to the bench for the game. However, Lehmann made another appearance and was brought on for Fabiański in the last 20 minutes of the game against Everton on 4 May 2008, Arsenal's final home game of the season. He was given a standing ovation after the match as he <b>bowed</b> <b>and</b> clapped to the fans. Later that day, Wenger confirmed that it was Lehmann's farewell appearance.|$|E

500|$|Active mainly at {{dawn and}} dusk, {{springbok}} form harems (mixed-sex herds). In earlier times, springbok of the Kalahari desert and Karoo migrated in large numbers across the countryside, a practice known as trekbokken. A feature unique to the springbok is pronking, in which the springbok performs multiple leaps into the air, up to [...] above the ground, in a stiff-legged posture, with the back <b>bowed</b> <b>and</b> the white flap lifted. Primarily a browser, the springbok feeds on shrubs and succulents; this antelope can live without drinking water for years, meeting its requirements through eating succulent vegetation. Breeding takes place year-round, and peaks in the rainy season, when forage is most abundant. A single calf is born after a five- to six-month-long pregnancy; weaning occurs at nearly six months of age, and the calf leaves its mother a few months later.|$|E

After the song ended, she <b>bowed</b> <b>and</b> thanked the audience before exiting the stage. The encore began with a giant projection of a hologram of Spears onto a water screen. The projection gradually shrunk until Spears rose from the stage while wearing a plastic cowboy hat, blue hip-huggers, and a matching bra top. She began performing [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] in a ballad version until reaching {{the end of the}} runway. Pyrotechnics surrounded the stage while the song changed to a more uptempo version with elements of techno. Her dancers took the main stage while {{she returned}} to it running through the runway. They jumped on the barge while it was lifted into the air and continued to dance. At the end, Spears jumped off the barge with the bungee cords and landed in the main stage and descended from it.|$|E
500|$|The Skanda Purana {{considers}} Narasimha {{as a mere}} irritation and not {{a threat}} to the world, contrary to what was brought out in the Shiva and Linga Puranas. The perception was that Vishnu may permanently adopt the fierce form of Narasimha, which would be detrimental to his role of doing good deeds. Hence, the purpose of Shiva assuming the form of Sharabha was to ensure that the lion body of Vishnu was discarded and he got united with his original divine form. Narasimha struck Sharabha with his body, it was Vishnu who groaned in pain and not Sharabha who was in an [...] "adamantine body". It was then that Vishnu realised that Sharabha was none other than Shiva and <b>bowed</b> <b>and</b> praised Sharabha. Shiva then blesses Vishnu and gives him a boon to kill demons. A Purana ends the story with gods fearing that Sharabha {{may not be able to}} control his rage and thus urging Shiva to give up his Sharabha form. Thereafter, Shiva dismembered Sharabha’s form; his limbs were given away and his torso became a Kapalika. The Vamana Purana too discusses the tale, ending with Narasimha becoming the calm Vishnu again and Sharabha becoming a lingam, the symbol of Shiva.|$|E

500|$|Springbok {{often go}} into bouts of {{repeated}} high leaps {{of up to}} [...] into the air – a practice known as pronking (derived from the Afrikaans pronk, [...] "to show off") or stotting. In pronking, the springbok performs multiple leaps into the air in a stiff-legged posture, with the back <b>bowed</b> <b>and</b> the white flap lifted. When the male shows off his strength to attract a mate, or to ward off predators, he starts off in a stiff-legged trot, leaping into the air with an arched back every few paces and lifting the flap along his back. Lifting the flap causes the long white hairs under the tail to stand up in a conspicuous fan shape, which in turn emits a strong scent of sweat. Although the exact cause of this behaviour is unknown, springbok exhibit this activity when they are nervous or otherwise excited. The most accepted theory for pronking {{is that it is}} a method to raise alarm against a potential predator or confuse it, or to get a better view of a concealed predator; it may also be used for display. Springbok are very fast antelopes, clocked at [...] They generally tend to be ignored by carnivores unless they are breeding. Caracals, cheetahs, leopards, spotted hyaenas, and wild dogs are major predators of the springbok. Southern African wildcats, black-backed jackals, black eagles, martial eagles, and tawny eagles target juveniles. Springbok are generally quiet animals, though they may make occasional low-pitched bellows as a greeting and high-pitched snorts when alarmed.|$|E
