5|$|The <b>British</b> <b>Virgin</b> <b>Islands</b> {{participated in}} seven summer Olympic games between {{its debut in}} the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles and the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. Their Olympic debut was at the 1984 Winter Olympics in Sarajevo, Yugoslavia, where the nation {{submitted}} a single athlete. The number of British Virgin Islanders participating in the summer games, excluding 1996 and 1984, included four or less athletes, and until Tahesia Harrigan in Beijing, only included men. Harrigan was the first female athlete to participate {{on behalf of the}} <b>British</b> <b>Virgin</b> <b>Islands,</b> and was its first female flagbearer. At Beijing, the <b>British</b> <b>Virgin</b> <b>Islands</b> were represented by two athletes, both in their twenties and both participating in track and field events: Eric Matthias and Tahesia Harrigan. Harrigan progressed to quarterfinals in her event, although neither athlete medaled.|$|E
5|$|The <b>British</b> <b>Virgin</b> <b>Islands</b> {{took part}} in the 2008 Summer Olympics, which were held in Beijing, China from 8 to 24 August 2008. The dependency's {{participation}} at Beijing marked its seventh consecutive appearance in the summer Olympics since its debut in 1984, and its eighth Olympic appearance ever. The British Virgin Islander delegation included two athletes in 2008 participating in two distinct events in one sport: discus thrower Eric Matthias and sprinter Tahesia Harrigan. Of the athletes, Harrigan was the flagbearer and the first female Olympian to participate on behalf of the <b>British</b> <b>Virgin</b> <b>Islands</b> in its entire history. Overall, Harrigan advanced to quarterfinals in her event, although neither athlete medaled.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} storm watch was issued for Frances for the Leeward Islands {{during the afternoon}} of August 29, which was upgraded to a warning that night and expanded to include the islands of Anguilla, Antigua, Barbuda, Nevis, Saba, Saint Kitts, Sint Eustatius, and Sint Maarten. A hurricane watch was issued during the night of August 29 for the northern <b>British</b> <b>Virgin</b> <b>Islands,</b> the northern United States Virgin Islands, Culebra, and Vieques. On the morning of August 30, the hurricane watch for Vieques was downgraded to a {{tropical storm}} watch. That afternoon, hurricane watches were changed to tropical storm warnings across Puerto Rico, Culebra, Vieques, <b>British</b> <b>Virgin</b> <b>Islands,</b> and the northern U. S. Virgin Islands while a tropical storm watch was issued for St. Croix while all remaining hurricane watches were dropped. That night, tropical storm watches were issued for eastern portions of the northern coast of the Dominican Republic while a tropical storm warning was issued for Guadeloupe.|$|E

5|$|Although Gabrielle {{remained}} {{far from}} land throughout its duration, its large size caused swells in the Lesser Antilles, the East Coast of the United States, Bermuda, and Atlantic Canada. Minor to moderate coastal flooding damage {{occurred in the}} Leeward Islands and the <b>British</b> <b>Virgin</b> <b>Islands.</b> Along the East Coast of the United States, rough seas caused one fatality in Maine, two in Massachusetts, one in New Jersey, and four in New York. Additionally, swells in Atlantic Canada caused one drowning fatality in Nova Scotia.|$|E
5|$|Before Iris {{moved through}} the Lesser Antilles, {{tropical}} storm watches, and later warnings, were issued from Barbados through the <b>British</b> <b>Virgin</b> <b>Islands.</b> The storm produced tropical storm force winds across the eastern Caribbean, although the primary meteorological event occurred from heavy rainfall. Flooding prompted evacuations in communities in Saint Lucia, Dominica, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. Iris {{was the first of}} three storms in a three-week period to affect the region, preceding the more destructive hurricanes Luis and Marilyn.|$|E
5|$|In Barbados, Gabrielle brought 10feet (3m) {{waves and}} {{flooding}} {{to the island}} nation, causing minor damage. There were no fatalities or injuries. In Dominica and Guadeloupe, waves from Gabrielle caused severe beach erosion along {{the north and east}} coasts of the island but moderate damage was reported. However, the erosion brought by Gabrielle and later Hurricane Hugo resulted loss of 14feet (4.4m) of beach. The Caribbean islands of Nevis and <b>British</b> <b>Virgin</b> <b>Islands</b> also sustained minor to moderate beach erosion. In Bermuda, waves of 10–20feet (4.6–6m) were reported.|$|E

5|$|Originally {{found only}} {{on the island of}} Virgin Gorda, it has since been {{reported}} on Tortola and Moskito Island. Its range is sometimes estimated to encompass the entire <b>British</b> <b>Virgin</b> <b>Islands,</b> although the original expedition by Thomas did not find any specimens on Tortola, Anegada, or other smaller islands, nor in the United States Virgin Islands of Saint Croix, Saint Thomas, and Saint John. Its distribution is considered unusual because despite being separated from its closest relative, S.nicholsi in Puerto Rico, another species, the Puerto Rican Crested Toad (Bufo lemur), has a geographic range that includes both islands, yet it has not diverged.|$|E
5|$|Saint John in the United States Virgin Islands {{reported}} over 15inches (380mm) {{of rainfall}} {{in association with}} Tropical Storm Klaus. Both Saint Thomas and Saint Croix received around 10inches (250mm), while rainfall in the <b>British</b> <b>Virgin</b> <b>Islands</b> remained below 10inches (250mm). Tropical Storm Klaus caused severe flooding and extensive damage throughout the U.S. Virgin Islands. Strong southwesterly winds resulted in gale force winds and rough seas along the southwestern portions of the Leeward Islands. The rough waves caused considerable damage to marine interests in the area. In Anguilla, three ships were wrecked. 1mile (1.6km) off of Saint Martin, the rough seas wrecked a cruise ship. The 60 passengers and 23 crew members swam safely to shore, though one person was hospitalized. Rough seas also damaged local coral reefs. 10,000people were affected {{on the island of}} Dominica. There, the storm caused $2million (1984 USD, $3.9million 2006USD) in damage and resulted in two fatalities. In Antigua, strong waves from the hurricane produced severe beach erosion, which endangered a highway behind an eroded beach. Beach erosion was reported in nearby Barbuda, as well. The <b>British</b> <b>Virgin</b> <b>Islands</b> sustained moderate damage totaling to $152million (1984USD, $315million 2008USD). St. Kitts and Nevis also saw much Leeward coastal damage resulting from the storm, the worst impact being the destruction of the Sandy Point town port in Saint Kitts.|$|E
5|$|The 1984 Winter Olympics, officially {{known as}} the XIV Olympic Winter Games, was a winter multi-sport event held in Sarajevo, Yugoslavia, from 8 to 19 February 1984.

50|$|French {{settlers}} {{arrived in}} the Caribbean in the 1625 and established trading ports on the islands of St. Kitts, Tortuga (in 1628, now a <b>British</b> <b>Virgin</b> <b>Island)</b> in Saint-Domingue (later Haiti), Martinique, and Guadeloupe (both in 1635). Near {{the end of the}} 17th century, the population of the French Caribbean was growing steadily but the territory was increasingly isolated from France because in 1674 the French trading company finally failed, and few artists had arrived from Europe. Currently little or no research has been done to highlight the early French influenced art forms originating in the Caribbean, nor to list artists who might fit within this category.|$|R
5|$|The British Crown {{possesses}} {{a number of}} overseas territories in the Americas, for whom Queen Elizabeth II is monarch. In North America are Anguilla, Bermuda, the <b>British</b> <b>Virgin</b> <b>Islands,</b> the Cayman Islands, Montserrat, and the Turks and Caicos Islands, while the Falkland Islands, and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands are located in South America. The Caribbean islands were colonised under the authority or the direct instruction {{of a number of}} European monarchs, mostly English, Dutch, or Spanish, throughout {{the first half of the}} 17th century. By 1681, however, when the Turks and Caicos Islands were settled by Britons, all of the above-mentioned islands were under the control of Charles II of England, Scotland, France and Ireland. Colonies were merged and split through various reorganizations of the Crown's Caribbean regions, until 19 December 1980, the date that Anguilla became a British Crown territory in its own right. The monarch is represented in these jurisdictions by: the Governor of Anguilla, Andrew George; the Governor of Bermuda, Richard Gozney; the Governor of the <b>British</b> <b>Virgin</b> <b>Islands,</b> David Pearey; the Governor of the Cayman Islands, Stuart Jack; the Governor of Montserrat, Elizabeth Carriere; and the Governor of the Turks and Caicos Islands, Peter Beckingham.|$|E
5|$|The Virgin Islands dwarf sphaero, also {{referred}} to as the Virgin Islands dwarf gecko, was discovered in the summer of 1964 by biologist Richard Thomas during a collecting trip along the dry, wooded slopes of Virgin Gorda in the <b>British</b> <b>Virgin</b> <b>Islands.</b> The holotype for Sphaerodactylus parthenopion, MCZ 77211, was an adult female collected on 12 August 1964 on a hillside above Pond Bay. A total of eight paratypes were collected on Virgin Gorda and used to describe the new species.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Frances was {{the sixth}} named storm, the fourth {{hurricane}}, {{and the third}} major hurricane, of the 2004 Atlantic hurricane season. The system crossed the open Atlantic in mid and late August, moving {{to the north of}} the Lesser Antilles while strengthening. Its outer bands struck Puerto Rico and the <b>British</b> <b>Virgin</b> <b>Islands</b> while passing north of the Caribbean Sea. The storm's maximum sustained wind peaked at , achieving Category 4 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. As the system's forward motion slowed, the eye passed over San Salvador Island and very close to Cat Island in the Bahamas. Frances was the first hurricane to impact the entire Bahamian archipelago since 1928, and almost completely destroyed the agricultural economy there.|$|E

5000|$|In April 2016, it was {{alleged that}} a local company made works worth {{thousands}} of Euros at Mario de Marco house in 2011, {{and that he}} only paid for the works in March 2016, following similar allegations were revealed on senior officials at Allied Newspapers which {{is the owner of}} the Maltese newspaper The Times of Malta and in which De Marco is also a board member. As he was still a Minister, when the works originally took place, he is accused of breaching the Minister's code of ethics. The businessman whose company was commissioned to do these works by de Marco, has been also linked to Panama Papers, by having a secret account at the <b>British</b> <b>Virgin</b> <b>Island</b> and a company registered in Panama.

5|$|On September22, about 3days {{before the}} system had formed into a {{tropical}} storm, its significant rainfall {{in the eastern}} Caribbean prompted flash flood warnings in Puerto Rico and the <b>British</b> <b>Virgin</b> <b>Islands.</b> In the Dominican Republic a green alert was issued for provinces {{in the eastern part}} of the nation. The next day yellow alerts were issued for eight provinces and red alerts in eight more. Evacuations began in vulnerable San Pedro de Macoris, La Romana, and Barahona and San Jose de Ocoa. The system moved westward on September 23, threatening Haiti with its rains which prompted the issuance of heavy rain warnings and a red alert warning by the nation's government.|$|E
5|$|Upon the {{declaration}} of Tropical Storm Erika on September1, tropical storm watches were issued for St. Maarten, Antigua, Barbuda, St. Kitts, Nevis, Anguilla, St. Martin and Saint Barthélemy.

When the storm entered the Caribbean Sea, a tropical storm warning was issued for Dominica and tropical storm watches were for Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and the <b>British</b> <b>Virgin</b> <b>Islands.</b> Early on September3, the tropical storm watches were upgraded to warnings as Erika drifted through the eastern Caribbean. Later that day, the warnings for Dominica and Guadeloupe were discontinued. Shortly thereafter, all remaining warnings were canceled.|$|E
