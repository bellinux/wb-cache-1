5|$|With {{the end of}} the NHL lockout on January 6, Holtby and Schilling left Hershey for the Washington Capitals, which {{cleared the}} way for goaltender Philipp Grubauer to rejoin the Bears from ECHL's Reading Royals. The end of the lockout was {{believed}} to ultimately benefit Hershey because they retained more of their roster than most other AHL clubs. Tomáš Kundrátek scored two goals for Hershey in their 4–3 win against Bridgeport on January 8, including the unassisted game-winner with 25.6 seconds left in overtime. Dany Sabourin made 35 saves, marking his third straight win as starting goaltender. Hershey's seven-game road winning streak ended with a 1–0 loss to the Penguins on January 11, in which Taffe, Potulny and Evan Barlow all suffered lower <b>body</b> <b>injuries.</b> Despite their absences, the Bears beat Connecticut 4–3 the next day, where the line of Kalinski, Mitchell and Barry Almeida combined for two goals and six points. Hershey beat the Whale again on January 13 in a 5–0 shutout, scoring four goals in the first period including three power plays, which equaled 11.1 percent of their 27 power plays of the season thus far. Tom Poti scored one of the power play goals; it marked his first game since January 12, 2011 for the Washington Capitals due to a fractured pelvis that threatened to end his career.|$|E
