50|$|The Randolph James House is a {{historic}} house at 1212 North Madison Avenue in El Dorado, Arkansas. The two-story stuccoed house was designed by Mann & Stern, and was built in 1927 for Randolph James by his father George, a principal in the local Exchange Bank who benefited from the city's oil boom in the 1920s. The house is a fine local example of Spanish Mission Revival styling, with wrought iron <b>balconies,</b> <b>tile</b> roof, stucco walls, and varied windows.|$|R
50|$|Both Bashkotrostan and Sterlitamak have {{implemented}} {{a federal program}} for renovating housing and communal services. In the city it operates since 2008, but few buildings has actually been renovated with <b>balconies,</b> new <b>tile</b> roofs, with streamlined elevators, new sewers and repaired doors.|$|R

Large archways provide access to a wraparound covered porch and a second-story <b>balcony.</b> Terracotta <b>tiles</b> cover the roof of the building, while the walls are covered with light-colored plaster.

50|$|The county {{building}} was added by {{right and left}} wings, modernised facade in Neobaroque, new <b>balcony,</b> Zsolnay roof <b>tile</b> patterns and several other things like electrical lightning and telephone line. At that time, {{it was the most}} modern building in southern part of the Kingdom of Hungary.|$|R
25|$|The {{base was}} {{originally}} built via contract awarded December 5, 1933; {{most of the}} buildings were complete by late 1934. Captain Howard B. Nurse, Construction Quartermaster, supervised the design and construction. He departed from traditional base design by rendering the buildings in the Spanish Eclectic (Spanish Revival) style then popular in California. Churrigueresque elements adorn the more important buildings. Reinforced concrete walls were covered in stucco to appear similar to earlier California missions; mission tile roofs topped the buildings. Recessed porches, cantilevered <b>balconies,</b> polychrome <b>tile</b> bands and wrought iron grillework complement the designs.|$|R
50|$|The {{interiors}} of Anhalt apartments feature amenities and design details that were uncommon in apartments of the time. Many Anhalt apartments featured built-in refrigerators, electric dish washers, wood-burning fireplaces, high ceilings, hand-carved woodwork, and double floors for soundproofing. Although individual apartments were not exceptionally large, many featured individualized floor plans and amenities more {{commonly found in}} single-family homes: upper and lower levels connected by curved interior staircases, private <b>balconies,</b> glazed <b>tile</b> work, and stained-glass window panes. The 25-unit Ten-O-Five apartment building, completed in 1930, was the first apartment building in Seattle to feature an underground parking garage.|$|R
5000|$|Whitehall Apartments is a {{historic}} apartment building located at Haverford in Lower Merion Township, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. It was built in 1925-1926, and is a large, 3 1/2-story, [...] "E"-shaped stucco building in the Mission Revival style. It features wrought iron <b>balconies,</b> blue decorative <b>tile</b> featuring scenes of Christopher Columbus, and red tile roof caps.|$|R

50|$|The Governor's Palace, called Casa Gobierno under Spanish rule, was reconstructed in 1885 {{to replace}} the {{original}} structure built in 1736. The two-story stone building featured a cantilevered <b>balcony</b> and clay <b>tile</b> roofing. Living quarters were upstairs while the first floor spaces were utilized as {{the office of the}} Sargento Mayor de la Plaza, weapons storerooms, and clerical offices.|$|R
5000|$|Located in Frick Fine Arts Building, this two-story library {{houses a}} {{circulating}} research collection serving the Department of the History of Art and Architecture. The Collection contains over 90,000 volumes and subscribes {{to more than}} 350 journals in relevant fields and is ranked among the top 10 fine art libraries in the country. [...] The library's reading room is constructed of fruit wood paneling and cabinetwork with gold leaf trim designed by Italian craftsmen. The library is further appointed by wrought iron <b>balcony</b> railings, terracotta <b>tile</b> flooring, maple tables with matching Windsor chairs, and ceiling-high windows furnishing views of Schenley Park. An inscription on the wall facing the entrance indicates the libraries dedication to Henry Clay Frick.|$|R
40|$|Repeated {{patterns}} (such as windows, <b>tiles,</b> <b>balconies</b> and doors) {{are prominent}} and significant features in urban scenes. Therefore, detection of these repeated patterns be-comes {{very important for}} city scene analysis. This paper attacks the problem of repeated patterns detection in a pre-cise, efficient and automatic way, by combining traditional feature extraction followed by a Kronecker product low-rank modeling approach. Our method is tailored for 2 D im-ages of building façades. We have developed algorithms for automatic selection of a representative texture within façade images using vanishing points and Harris corners. After rectifying the input images, we describe novel algorithms that extract repeated patterns by using Kronecker product based modeling {{that is based on}} a solid theoretical founda-tion. Our approach is unique and has not ever been used for façade analysis. We have tested our algorithms in a large set of images. 1...|$|R
25|$|The {{historic}} shophouses {{could easily}} be re-used for modern businesses, such as restaurants, cafes, bars and small shops. The interior of the buildings could be modified with the new use in mind, in some cases using new non-traditional interior ornamentation, materials, and colours. For instance, {{the interior of the}} Opera Cafe at No. 40 Boat Quay was modified to create an ambiance similar to an opera stage-set. The ground floor of the Lim Family Shophouse at No. 58 Boat Quay was converted into a Japanese restaurant. The upper floor is used as a weekend flat for the Lim family, who lived in the building since 1908. The architect Mok Wei Wei created more open space by demolishing some of the original partition walls, but kept and restored the original teak floors, paint colour on the window frames, wooden <b>balcony</b> doors, and <b>tile</b> roofs. The historic blackwood furniture and art pieces were also restored and re-used.|$|R
50|$|In 1986, Denise Kowal {{bought the}} {{triangle}} building and its 1950's addition {{to save it}} from demolition by speculators who {{wanted to build a}} high-rise on the property. She made extensive interior and exterior renovations. A cupola, wrought iron <b>balconies,</b> awnings, and <b>tile</b> address signs were also added. Three of the original studio apartments were converted to a single apartment that Kowal occupied with her two sons in 1996. In 1997, the residence was featured in the Sarasota Alliance for Historic Preservation annual Historic Homes Tour. It was featured once more in 2005 for the 'Creative and Collectors Tour,' and again in 2015 on the Historic Homes tour for the Sarasota Alliance for Historic Preservation. Today, the structure {{remains one of the most}} unusual in the city, distinctive because of its prominent location and splendid architecture. Also unique is the building's mixed use: commercial and office below, residential above, and zero setback from the sidewalk. Planning and design professionals have since embraced this concept, now referred to as 'New Urbanism' for downtown Sarasota and across the country.|$|R
