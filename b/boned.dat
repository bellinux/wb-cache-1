5|$|A steel corset in the Stibbert Museum, Florence, Italy, is {{dated to}} the mid-16th century, and {{thought to be}} similar to the metal stays {{recorded}} as having been made by a corazzaio mastro (master armour-maker) for Eleanor of Toledo and delivered to her on 28 February 1549. However, as Eleanor's wardrobe records do not list any <b>boned</b> or stiffened corsets, it is thought that her steel bodice was designed for medical or therapeutic reasons rather than worn as a fashionable garment.|$|E
5|$|Because Clumber Spaniels {{are large}} <b>boned</b> and fast growing, they can suffer from {{temporary}} lameness from between six and twelve months of age, with this lameness subsiding when bone growth is complete. Another common condition that the breed suffers from are impacted anal sacs {{and the dog}} may require them to be emptied by a veterinarian. The final common condition that the breed has is heat sensitivity: if Clumber Spaniels are left without shade, they can become uncomfortably hot and dehydrated.|$|E
5|$|The Shetland {{is one of}} the {{smallest}} British breeds. The ewes are usually polled (hornless) and the rams usually horned, although horned ewes and polled rams do occur occasionally. The breed is noted for its very fine, soft wool and the high quality of its meat, though its smaller size limits its use in commercial meat markets. They are small-bodied animals, with some wool on their faces, noses or legs, but not in excess. The legs are of medium length and finely <b>boned.</b> They have small, erect ears. A distinguishing feature of northern short-tailed sheep is the short, fluke-shaped tail, broad at the base, tapering to a point, and covered towards the tip in hair, not wool.|$|E

50|$|Cortical <b>bone,</b> {{synonymous with}} compact <b>bone,</b> {{is one of}} the two types of <b>bone</b> tissue that form <b>bones.</b> Cortical <b>bone</b> forms the {{extremely}} hard exterior of <b>bones.</b> Cortical <b>bone</b> facilitates <b>bone's</b> main functions: to support the whole body, protect organs, provide levers for movement, and store and release chemical elements, mainly calcium. As its name implies, cortical <b>bone</b> forms the cortex, or outer shell, of most <b>bones.</b> Cortical (compact) <b>bone</b> is much denser than cancellous <b>bone.</b> Furthermore, it is harder, stronger and stiffer than cancellous <b>bone.</b> Cortical <b>bone</b> contributes about 80% of the weight of a human skeleton. The primary anatomical and functional unit of cortical <b>bone</b> is the osteon.|$|R

5|$|The {{most common}} {{color of the}} Namib Desert Horse is bay, {{although}} {{there are a few}} chestnut and brown horses. The gene for gray does not occur in the breed. There are many individuals with dorsal striping but no zebra stripes. No other colors have been recorded. The Namib Desert Horses are athletic, muscular, , and strong <b>boned.</b> They are short-backed with oblique shoulders and good withers. The horses have the appearance of well-bred riding horses in head, skin, and coat. Overall, they have good conformation, with few deformities. Club hooves are occasionally seen in foals, likely due to trauma to the hoof while traveling long distances.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} pie in {{the legend}} included sand eels, horse mackerel, pilchards, herring, dogfish and ling along with a seventh fish. In a traditional pie, the primary ingredient is the pilchard (sardine), although mackerel or herring {{is used as a}} substitute. Richard Stevenson, chef at The Ship Inn in Mousehole, suggests that any white fish will work for the filling, with pilchards or herring just added for the presentation. Prior to putting it in the pie the fish should be skinned and <b>boned</b> (except the head and tail) {{to make it easier to}} eat. Along with the fish, the other traditional ingredients are thickened milk, eggs and boiled potatoes.|$|E
5|$|The Canadian horse has {{a rather}} short, high-set {{head with a}} broad forehead. The neck is arched and graceful, and the chest, back and loins broad and {{strongly}} muscled. The shoulders and croup are sloping, with a relatively high-set tail. Overall, the breed gives the impression of strength and agility. Their heavy and wavy mane and tail, arched necks and finely <b>boned</b> heads are all reminiscent of Andalusian and Barb ancestry. Their trot is described as flashy. They are hardy horses and easy keepers. Today, most Canadian horses are used as riding and driving horses, and {{are known for their}} jumping ability. They are seen in competition in almost every discipline, as well as for leisure riding. They can also be found in light draft work, trail riding, and working as a stock horse.|$|E

50|$|<b>Bones</b> are organs {{that are}} made up of <b>bone</b> tissue as well as <b>bone</b> marrow, small blood vessels, {{epithelium}} and nerves. <b>Bone</b> tissue refers specifically to the <b>bone</b> mineral matrix that forms the rigid sections of the organ, and the <b>bone</b> cells within it. The two types of <b>bone</b> tissue are cortical <b>bone</b> and cancellous <b>bone.</b> There is another kind of tissue called subchondral <b>bone</b> which underlies the epiphyseal cartilage at the ends of <b>bones.</b>|$|R
5|$|The head {{should be}} of {{moderate}} width at the ears, narrowing to the eyes, and slightly flat between the ears. There should be a defined but not overpronounced stop {{at the end of}} the muzzle where it meets the head, and a black nose. The jaw should be powerful and well <b>boned</b> with a scissor bite and straight teeth. The eyes are almond shaped and dark coloured and should be full of life and intelligence. Small V-shaped ears of moderate thickness are carried forward on the head. When the dog is alert, the tip of the V should not extend past the outer corner of the eyes. The tail is set high and in the past was docked to approximately five inches in order to provide a sufficient hand-hold for gripping the terrier.|$|E

50|$|<b>Bone</b> mineral (also called {{inorganic}} <b>bone</b> phase, <b>bone</b> salt, or <b>bone</b> apatite) is the inorganic {{component of}} <b>bone</b> tissue. It gives <b>bones</b> their compressive strength. <b>Bone</b> mineral is formed from carbonated hydroxyapatite with lower crystallinity.|$|R
25|$|Trabecular <b>bone</b> (or cancellous <b>bone)</b> is the sponge-like <b>bone</b> in {{the ends}} of long <b>bones</b> and vertebrae. Cortical <b>bone</b> is the hard outer shell of <b>bones</b> and the middle of long <b>bones.</b> Because osteoblasts and osteoclasts inhabit the surface of <b>bones,</b> trabecular <b>bone</b> is more active and is more subject to <b>bone</b> {{turnover}} and remodeling. Not only is <b>bone</b> density decreased, but the microarchitecture of <b>bone</b> is also disrupted. The weaker spicules of trabecular <b>bone</b> break ("microcracks"), and are replaced by weaker <b>bone.</b> Common osteoporotic fracture sites, the wrist, the hip and the spine, have a relatively high trabecular <b>bone</b> to cortical <b>bone</b> ratio. These areas rely on the trabecular <b>bone</b> for strength, so the intense remodeling causes these areas to degenerate most when the remodeling is imbalanced. Around the ages of 30â€“35, cancellous or trabecular <b>bone</b> loss begins. Women may lose as much as 50%, while men lose about 30%.|$|R
50|$|The frontal <b>bone</b> {{is one of}} the {{principal}} paired mid-line <b>bones</b> in dinosaur skulls.

50|$|The {{supporting}} alveolar <b>bone</b> {{consists of}} both cortical <b>bone</b> and trabecular <b>bone.</b> The cortical <b>bone,</b> or cortical plates, consists of plates of compact <b>bone</b> on the facial and lingual {{surfaces of the}} alveolar <b>bone.</b> These cortical plates are usually about 1.5 to 3 mm thick over posterior teeth, but the thickness is highly variable around anterior teeth. The trabecular <b>bone</b> consists of cancellous <b>bone</b> that is located between the alveolar <b>bone</b> proper and the plates of cortical <b>bone.</b> The alveolar <b>bone</b> between two neighboring teeth is the interdental septum (or interdental <b>bone).</b>|$|R
50|$|The raw {{material}} for <b>bone</b> china is about 50% <b>bone</b> ash derived from animal <b>bones.</b> These <b>bones</b> undergo multiple processing stages during which all meat is removed and the <b>bone</b> is completely cleaned. Once cleaned, the <b>bone</b> is heated to about 1000 Â°C (1832 Â°F) so that all additional organic material {{is removed from the}} <b>bone</b> and the <b>bone</b> becomes sterilized. Lastly, the newly sterilized <b>bone</b> is ground with water into fine particles which {{can be used as a}} {{raw material}} for <b>bone</b> china. <b>Bone</b> ash plays an important role in the creation of <b>bone</b> china, as the phosphate of the <b>bone</b> generates beta tricalcium phosphate, and other compounds from the <b>bone</b> create a calcium crystal called anorthite. Synthetic alternatives dicalcium phosphate and tricalcium phosphate are used as substitutes for <b>bone</b> ash.

30|$|<b>Bone</b> {{quality is}} a generic {{term for the}} {{characterization}} of <b>bone</b> tissue in three dimensions: the structural quality, related {{to the amount of}} the cortical <b>bone</b> and to the trabecular <b>bone</b> pattern; the <b>bone</b> density, related to the amount of <b>bone</b> mineralization and/or the amount of <b>bone</b> by its volume; and the amount of <b>bone,</b> related to the volume of <b>bone</b> available [3]. <b>Bone</b> quality varies intra- and inter-subject depending on the thickness of cortical <b>bone,</b> the amount of trabecular <b>bone,</b> and the amount of <b>bone</b> tissue mineralization in the region of interest for implant placement [4]. Some classifications of <b>bone</b> quality have considered cortical <b>bone</b> thickness and trabecular <b>bone</b> structure based on preoperative panoramic radiographs and tactile perception during exploratory drilling of the implant site; <b>bone</b> density based on the tactile sensation and Hounsfield units of computed tomography (CT) images; radiographic pattern of trabecular bone; and intra-surgical <b>bone</b> density and biopsy with histomorphometric evaluation [5 â€“ 8]. However, most classifications of <b>bone</b> quality for routine clinical use still are not validated by using objective and subjective assessment methods.|$|R

25|$|The Japanese Akita and American Akita {{began to}} diverge in type during the Postâ€“World War II era. It {{was during this}} time, that US {{servicemen}} serving {{as part of the}} occupation force in Japan first came into contact with the Akita, the breed so impressed them that many servicemembers chose to bring an Akita back home with them upon completion of their tour. American servicemembers were typically more impressed with the larger more bear-like fighting Akita or German Shepherd type than they were with the smaller framed and fox-like Akita-Inu; the types of dogs they brought back with them to the US reflected this sentiment. Japanese Akita fanciers focused on restoring the breed as a work of Japanese art or to 'Natural Monument' status. American Akita fanciers chose to breed larger, heavier-boned and more intimidating dogs. Although, both types derive from a common ancestry, there are marked differences between the two. First, while American Akitas are acceptable in all colors, Japanese Akitas are only permitted to be red, fawn, sesame, white, or brindle. Additionally, American Akitas may be pinto and/or have black masks, unlike Japanese Akitas where it is considered a disqualification and not permitted in the breed standards. American Akitas generally are heavier <b>boned</b> and larger, with a more bear-like head, whereas Japanese Akitas tend to be lighter and more finely featured with a fox-like head.|$|E

40|$|UNLABELLED: This {{study shows}} that change to cancellous <b>bone</b> {{structure}} is <b>bone</b> volume-dependent in a nonlinear manner. At low <b>bone</b> volume (< 15 %), trabecular thickness and trabecular separation change at a much greater rate than at higher <b>bone</b> volume. This suggests that the structural integrity of the cancellous <b>bone</b> may become rapidly compromised when <b>bone</b> volume falls below a critical value. INTRODUCTION: While <b>bone</b> mass is the major determinant of <b>bone</b> strength, this mass-based paradigm does not fully account for {{the contribution of the}} <b>bone</b> microstructure to mechanical efficiency. Geometric models of cancellous <b>bone</b> structure have been formulated based on stylized representations of the trabecular elements, where the relationships between <b>bone</b> volume and <b>bone</b> surface of cancellous <b>bone</b> are complex and reflect the modulating effect on the cancellous <b>bone</b> structure of <b>bone</b> remodeling at the trabecular surfaces. Using the plate model of cancellous <b>bone</b> structure, the interrelationships between parameters of cancellous <b>bone</b> structure have been studied. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two hundred eighty histological sections of human cancellous <b>bone</b> from eight skeletal sites were analyzed. The structural parameters of cancellous <b>bone</b> (BV/TV, BS/TV, BS/BV, Tb. Th, Tb. Sp, Tb. N, and TBPf) were obtained. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: This {{study shows that}} change to cancellous <b>bone</b> structure is <b>bone</b> volume-dependent in a nonlinear manner. At low <b>bone</b> volume (< 15 %), structural parameters of cancellous <b>bone,</b> such as trabecular thickness and trabecular separation, change at a much greater rate than at higher <b>bone</b> volume. This suggests that the structural integrity of the cancellous <b>bone</b> may become rapidly compromised when <b>bone</b> volume falls below a critical value. These data describe the complex relationships between <b>bone</b> mass and structure in cancellous <b>bone</b> that are often overlooked in the mass-based paradigm of <b>bone</b> strength. Histomorphometric descriptors of cancellous <b>bone</b> structure highlight the potential for accelerated deterioration of the structure with low <b>bone</b> volume, which leads to increased risk of fracture. From a clinical viewpoint, estimation of an individual's fracture risk is constrained to noninvasive techniques, which only provide <b>bone</b> mineral density or <b>bone</b> mineral content. Therefore, {{there is a need to}} better correlate measurement of <b>bone</b> mass with measurements of structural parameters...|$|R
40|$|The Author(s) 2015. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract <b>Bone</b> remodeling, the fundamental process for <b>bone</b> renewal, is targeted by treatments of osteoporosis {{to correct the}} imbalance between <b>bone</b> resorption and <b>bone</b> formation and {{reduce the risk of}} fractures and associated clinical consequences. Currently available therapeutics affect <b>bone</b> resorption and <b>bone</b> formation in the same direction and either decrease (inhibitors of <b>bone</b> resorption) or increase (parathyroid hormone [PTH] peptides) <b>bone</b> remodeling. Studies of patients with rare <b>bone</b> diseases and genetically modified animal models demonstrated that <b>bone</b> resorption and <b>bone</b> formation may not necessarily be coupled, leading to identification of molecular targets in <b>bone</b> cells for the development of novel agents for the treatment of osteoporosis. Application of such agents to the treatment of women with low <b>bone</b> mass confirmed that <b>bone</b> resorption and <b>bone</b> formation can be modulated in different directions and so far two new classes of thera-peutics for osteoporosis have been defined with distinct mechanisms of action. Such treatments, if combined with a favorable safety profile, will offer new therapeutic options and will improve the management of patients with osteoporosis. Key Points In osteoporosis, there is an imbalance between <b>bone</b> resorption and <b>bone</b> formation leading to <b>bone</b> loss and structural decay of the skeleton. Currently available therapeutics affect <b>bone</b> resorption and <b>bone</b> formation in the same direction and either decrease (inhibitors of <b>bone</b> resorption) or increase (PTH peptides) <b>bone</b> remodeling. New classes of therapeutics for osteoporosis with different mechanisms of action are in clinical development. Inhibitors of Cathepsin K reduce <b>bone</b> resorption while preserving <b>bone</b> formation and increase <b>bone</b> mineral density at the spine and the hip continuously for at least 5 years of treatment. Inhibitors of sclerostin increase <b>bone</b> formation while reducing <b>bone</b> resorption and impressively increase <b>bone</b> mineral density at the spine and the hip. ...|$|R
