5|$|Baltische Öl {{consisted}} of five units (Kiviõli, Küttejõu, Kohtla-Järve, Sillamäe, and Kohtla), {{all of which}} were partially restored, previously existing industries. In addition, Baltische Öl started construction of a new mining and shale oil extraction complex in Ahtme, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>never</b> became operational. Prisoners of war and forced labour made up about two-thirds of the work force in these units.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} {{wave that}} {{had reached the}} Eastern Pacific from Africa was first spotted on July 23. The wave continued westward with little development occurring until August 3, when convection increased. After additional slow organization, the wave was classified as Tropical Depression Seven-E on August 6 near the tip of Baja California. The system did not strengthen much, and development was halted when wind shear destroyed the system on August 8. The depression never came near land and hence no one was killed or injured. Like Tropical Depression Three-E, this cyclone was forecast to reach tropical storm intensity, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>never</b> did.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of this attack, a 4-inch Mark III QF gun was erected on a {{promontory}} overlooking Village Bay, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>never</b> saw action against the enemy. Of greater long-term significance to the islanders were the introduction of regular {{contact with the outside world}} and the slow development of a money-based economy. This made life easier for the St Kildans but also made them less self-reliant. Both were factors in the evacuation of the island little more than a decade later.|$|E

5|$|Admiral Nimitz {{recommended}} to the Joint Chiefs of Staff that development {{and control of}} the base facilities be placed under SOPAC by extending its border westward to include the Admiralties. MacArthur was furious; the borders of SWPA could not be changed without the consent of the Australian government. Nimitz's proposal was eventually turned down by the Joint Chiefs but not before MacArthur restricted access to the facilities to ships of the United States Seventh Fleet and British Pacific Fleet. Halsey was summoned to MacArthur's headquarters in Brisbane on 3March 1944, and the two agreed to a compromise. Responsibility {{for the development of the}} base passed from Krueger's Alamo Force to Kinkaid's Allied Naval Forces on 18May 1944. It was proposed control would ultimately pass to SOPAC <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>never</b> did.|$|E

5|$|Industry {{appeared}} {{very early}} in Sélestat. The town had already several factories {{at the beginning of}} the 19th century: a tilery, a sawmill, 12 tanneries and 11 mills. Sélestat quickly became specialised in wire gauze making <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>never</b> became a large industrial centre, remaining a small town with limited influence. The completion of the Strasbourg-Basel railway (1840), one of the first to be built in France, did not lead to significant urban development. The town walls that still encircled the town were a significant factor in its economic and demographic stagnation. After the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, Alsace and a part of Lorraine were annexed by the new German Empire. The German authorities demolished the city walls in 1874 and built new spacious neighbourhoods around the old town, as they did in Strasbourg and Metz.|$|E
5|$|The Erie Railroad was {{constructed}} through Sloatsburg from 1836 to 1841, {{helping with the}} prosperity of the village, along with its population. The station was also near the Sterlington one, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>never</b> served of great importance. The Sloatsburg station building was built in 1868 as a two-story brick facade with a tin roof. The style of the building, according to the railroad's 1920 engineering report, is a Type 6A style, with dimensions of 17' x 29.5' x 19'. The station was equipped to host {{as a base for}} XG Radio from the Suffern Tower (SF) in Suffern. The Sloatsburg station served well for the nearby Greenwood Lake, with a stagecoach leaving the station three times day. The stagecoach was mainly inhabited by fishermen on their way to Greenwood Lake.|$|E

5|$|The {{expanded}} and altered version of The Welsh Opera, The Grub-Street Opera, was first rehearsed in May 1731, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>never</b> ran on stage. It was printed and {{exists in a}} complete printed format, {{and it is possible}} that it was not performed because of government intervention. Its original printing was done without Fielding's consent, and it is uncertain as to when Fielding's official version of the play was printed. The plot focuses on a standard love story but with characters that exhibit less than virtuous characteristics. The title pokes fun at the Grub Street Journal and also links to the theme within the plot of attacking theatre in general.|$|E
5|$|Having {{been officially}} {{suspended}} {{at the end}} of the Cromwellian regime, parliament returned after the Restoration of Charles II in 1661. This parliament, known disparagingly as the 'Drunken Parliament', revoked most of the Presbyterian gains of the last thirty years. Subsequently Charles' absence from Scotland and use of commissioners to rule his northern kingdom undermined the authority of the body. James VII's parliament supported him against rivals and attempted rebellions, but after his escape to exile in 1689 William's first parliament was dominated by his supporters and, in contrast to the situation in England, effectively deposed James under the Claim of Right, which offered the crown to William and Mary, placing important limitations on royal power, including the abolition of the Lords of the Articles. Rosalind Mitchison argues that the parliament became a focus of national political life, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>never</b> reached the position of a true centre of national identity attained by its English counterpart. The new Williamite parliament would subsequently bring about its own demise by the Act of Union in 1707. The English and Scottish parliaments were replaced by a combined Parliament of Great Britain, but it sat in Westminster and largely continued English traditions without interruption. Forty-five Scots were added to the 513 members of the House of Commons and 16 Scots to the 190 members of the House of Lords.|$|E
5|$|It is {{distinguished}} by its position against the French absolute monarchy, support for religious tolerance, including for Jansenism, support for democratic reforms {{such as the}} introduction of parliaments, support for the American independence and the Polish Constitution of May 3, 1791. The newspaper preferred to praise the changes in Poland (the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth) more than those in France, criticizing {{the violence of the}} French Revolution, and contrasting it with the peaceful transformation in Poland. This relative lack of support for the French Revolution may explain why the paper was abolished on 23 April 1798, three years after the invasion of the Netherlands by France and the Batavian Revolution. It reappeared as the Nouvelles politiques publiées à Leyde in October, but it was seen as no longer independent. Under a new name—Journal politique publié à Leyde—it lasted from 1804 until 1811, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>never</b> regained its audience and its quality, and disappeared after the annexation of Holland by the French Empire. A new Leyden Gazette briefly appeared after the liberation of Holland in 1814.|$|E

5|$|Wonder Stories had a {{circulation}} of about 25,000 in 1934, {{comparable to that of}} Amazing Stories, which had declined from an early peak of about 100,000. Gernsback considered issuing a reprint magazine in 1934, Wonder Stories Reprint Annual, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>never</b> appeared. That year he experimented with other fiction magazines—Pirate Stories and High Seas Adventures—but neither was successful. Wonder Stories was also failing, and in November 1935 it started publishing bimonthly instead of monthly. Gernsback had a reputation for paying slowly and was therefore unpopular with many authors; by 1936 he was even failing to pay Laurence Manning, one of his most reliable authors. Staff were sometimes asked to delay cashing their paychecks for weeks at a time. Gernsback felt the blame lay with dealers who were returning magazine covers as unsold copies, and then selling the stripped copies at a reduced rate. To bypass the dealers, he made a plea in the March 1936 issue to his readers, asking them to subscribe, and proposing to distribute Wonder Stories solely by subscription. There was little response, and Gernsback decided to sell. He made a deal with Ned Pines of Beacon Magazines and on 21 February 1936 Wonder Stories was sold.|$|E
5|$|Working as the Deputy Surveyor, Jones {{began to}} build good {{relations}} with the Mississauga Ojibwa Indians and Mohawk Indians of the area. He became fluent in the languages of these groups and earned the trust of many members of the tribes, including influential members like Joseph Brant, of whom he became a good friend. In 1797 the head chief of the Mississaugas in the Credit River area Wabakinine, as well as his wife, were murdered {{by a member of the}} Queen's Rangers. Wabakinine had been a very beloved chief and seen as a firm ally of the British. His murder shocked the members of his band and other local Ojibwa bands. Charles McEwan, the killer was charged and tried, but the Indian witnesses did not attend the trial and he was subsequently acquitted for lack of evidence. Nimquasim, a local Indian chief, met with Augustus Jones on February 15, 1797 and confessed to Jones that he and the local Indian bands were inclined to wage open war against the British over the event. Jones relayed this information to British administrator Peter Russell. The town of York had about 675 white settlers and 135 soldiers, a number that Russell believed might not be sufficient to address an Indian rebellion. If a winter rebellion transpired York would be cut off from large garrisons at the Bay of Quinte and the Niagara Peninsula. Russell and John Graves Simcoe both anticipated rebellion for the next year or so, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>never</b> came. Joseph Brant, a Mohawk chief who had travelled to England cautioned the tribes against rebellion as he knew the military strength of the British was likely to render any war a losing one. Russell, however, set out to undermine alliances and friendships between the Indian bands of southern Ontario, fearing such an uprising.|$|E
