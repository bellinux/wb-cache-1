5|$|Catalytic RNA {{molecules}} (ribozymes) {{were discovered}} in the early 1980s, leading to a 1989 Nobel award to Thomas Cech and Sidney Altman. In 1990, it was found in Petunia that introduced genes can silence similar genes of the plant's own, now known to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> RNA interference.|$|E
5|$|Hearing loss may {{be either}} partial or total. This may <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> injury or damage, {{congenital}} disease, or physiological causes. When hearing loss {{is a result}} of injury or damage to the outer ear or middle ear, it is known as conductive hearing loss. When deafness {{is a result of}} injury or damage to the inner ear, vestibulochoclear nerve, or brain, it is known as sensorineural hearing loss.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{international}} breed associations have been testing the F94L status of cattle registered in their herd books. The absence of F94L genes in some tested cattle might <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> a sire or dam ancestor that had double muscling (MH) genes, {{or more likely}} that the myostatin gene was the normal or wild type variant found most commonly in beef cattle. In the latter case, loss of the F94L variant will arise when grading up to purebred when base animals are not Limousins.|$|E

Thus the process of development and that of aging are coupled by Mis-construction and Mis-re-construction (Misrepair) of the structure of an organism.|$|R
5|$|Directional {{anisotropy}} {{refers to}} a difference in diffusion mechanism or rate in a particular direction on a given crystallographic plane. These differences may <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> either anisotropy in the surface lattice (e.g. a rectangular lattice) or the presence of steps on a surface. One of the more dramatic examples of directional anisotropy is the diffusion of adatoms on channeled surfaces such as fcc (110), where diffusion along the channel is much faster than diffusion across the channel.|$|E
5|$|Except for water, {{the only}} other {{compound}} identified {{on the surface of}} Umbriel by the infrared spectroscopy is carbon dioxide, which is concentrated mainly on the trailing hemisphere. The origin of the carbon dioxide is not completely clear. It might be produced locally from carbonates or organic materials {{under the influence of the}} energetic charged particles coming from the magnetosphere of Uranus or the solar ultraviolet radiation. This hypothesis would explain the asymmetry in its distribution, as the trailing hemisphere is subject to a more intense magnetospheric influence than the leading hemisphere. Another possible source is the outgassing of the primordial CO2 trapped by water ice in Umbriel's interior. The escape of CO2 from the interior may <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> past geological activity on this moon.|$|E
5|$|Factors such as hypoxia and infection, or {{stress and}} {{malnutrition}} {{in the mother}} during fetal development, {{may result in a}} slight increase in the risk of schizophrenia later in life. People diagnosed with schizophrenia {{are more likely to have}} been born in winter or spring (at least in the northern hemisphere), which may <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> increased rates of viral exposures in utero. The increased risk is about five to eight percent. Other infections during pregnancy or around the time of birth that may increase the risk include Toxoplasma gondi and Chlamydia.|$|E

5|$|Florida {{strangler}} figs (Ficus aurea) {{are common}} in hammocks, and find particular ease in rooting at the heads of cabbage palms (Sabal palmetto). After taking root into the ground, they build complex frameworks around the host tree, eventually squeezing out light and nutrients, and essentially taking its place. A variety of invertebrates including beetles, ants, spiders, and tree snails support a food chain that includes frogs, owls and other birds of prey, snakes, rodents, bobcats, and raccoons. There are more than 50varieties of tree snails in the Everglades; the color patterns and designs unique to single islands may <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> the isolation of certain hammocks.|$|E

Their mascots, a smiling anime fish and light bulb, merge to form Mr. Sparkle. Thus, Homer discovers the similarity was a mere coincidence.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} that many transient phenomena might not {{be associated with the}} Moon itself but could <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> unfavourable observing conditions or phenomena associated with the Earth. For instance, some reported transient phenomena are for objects near the resolution of the employed telescopes. The Earth's atmosphere can give rise to significant temporal distortions that could be confused with actual lunar phenomena (an effect known as astronomical seeing). Other non-lunar explanations include the viewing of Earth-orbiting satellites and meteors or observational error.|$|E

5|$|Mating {{has rarely}} been {{observed}} in sharks. The smaller catsharks often mate with the male curling around the female. In less flexible species the two sharks swim {{parallel to each other}} while the male inserts a clasper into the female's oviduct. Females in many of the larger species have bite marks that appear to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> a male grasping them to maintain position during mating. The bite marks may also come from courtship behavior: the male may bite the female to show his interest. In some species, females have evolved thicker skin to withstand these bites.|$|E
5|$|Oberon's {{accretion}} probably {{lasted for}} several thousand years. The impacts that accompanied accretion caused heating of the moon's outer layer. The maximum temperature of around 230K was reached at {{the depth of}} about 60km. After the end of formation, the subsurface layer cooled, while the interior of Oberon heated due to decay of radioactive elements present in its rocks. The cooling near-surface layer contracted, while the interior expanded. This caused strong extensional stresses in the moon's crust leading to cracking. The present-day system of canyons may <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> this process, which lasted for about 200million years, implying that any endogenous activity from this cause ceased billions of years ago.|$|E
5|$|Proposals {{were made}} to find the next Lord Warden, George Curzon, the Marquess Curzon, {{alternative}} accommodation and the Royal Marines were approached as replacement tenants for the castle, but declined the offer. The Ministry acquired agreement {{for most of the}} castle to be opened to the public, with various historical objects related to the property being put on display, including some donated by King Edward VII. Lord Curzon moved into the castle when returned from India in 1905. His wife, Mary, fell ill, which Curzon believed to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> their poor accommodation, and despite being moved to a new residence, she died shortly afterwards. As a result, Curzon decided to resign the post of Lord Warden, leaving the castle, and subsequently the Prince of Wales, the future George V, took up the post.|$|E

5|$|Ruffed lemurs {{are active}} {{primarily}} {{during the day}} (diurnal), during which time they feed primarily on fruits and nectar, often adopting suspensory postures while feeding. The seeds of the fruit they eat pass through their digestive tract and are propagated throughout the rainforests in their feces, helping to ensure new plant growth and a healthy forest ecosystem. These lemurs are also significant pollinators of the traveller's tree (Ravenala madagascariensis). Without destroying the inflorescence, they lick the nectar from deep inside the flower using their long muzzles and tongues, collecting and transferring pollen on their snouts and fur from plant to plant. This relationship is thought to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> co-evolution.|$|E

Its abundance may <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> the absence of ecologically similar competitors. Apart from T.atlantica, the reptile fauna of Fernando de Noronha consists of the indigenous amphisbaenian Amphisbaena ridleyi and two introduced lizards, the gecko Hemidactylus mabouia and the tegu Tupinambis merianae.|$|E
5|$|The {{accretion}} process probably {{lasted for}} several thousand {{years before the}} moon was fully formed. Models suggest that impacts accompanying accretion caused heating of Ariel's outer layer, reaching a maximum temperature of around 195K {{at a depth of}} about 31km. After the end of formation, the subsurface layer cooled, while the interior of Ariel heated due to decay of radioactive elements present in its rocks. The cooling near-surface layer contracted, while the interior expanded. This caused strong extensional stresses in the moon's crust reaching estimates of 30 MPa, which may have led to cracking. Some present-day scarps and canyons may <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> this process, which lasted for about 200million years.|$|E

5|$|These {{events are}} {{at the tail end}} of the long GRB {{duration}} distribution, lasting more than 10,000 seconds. They have been proposed to form a separate class, caused by the collapse of a blue supergiant star, a tidal disruption event or a new-born magnetar. Only a small number have been identified to date, their primary characteristic being their gamma ray emission duration. The most studied ultra-long events include GRB 101225A and GRB 111209A. The low detection rate may <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> low sensitivity of current detectors to long-duration events, rather than a reflection of their true frequency. A 2013 study, on the other hand, shows that the existing evidence for a separate ultra-long GRB population with a new type of progenitor is inconclusive, and further multi-wavelength observations are needed to draw a firmer conclusion.|$|E
5|$|While similar lifeforms {{have been}} known to exist in {{shallower}} oceanic trenches (>7,000m) and on the abyssal plain, the lifeforms discovered in the Challenger Deep may represent independent taxa from those shallower ecosystems. This preponderance of soft-shelled organisms at the Challenger Deep may <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> selection pressure. Millions of years ago, the Challenger Deep was shallower than it is now. Over the past six to nine million years, as the Challenger Deep grew to its present depth, many of the species present in the sediment of that ancient biosphere were unable to adapt to the increasing water pressure and changing environment. Those species that were able to adapt may have been the ancestors of the organisms currently endemic to the Challenger Deep.|$|E
