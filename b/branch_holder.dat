5000|$|The PRC is {{composed}} of five Commissioners—each of whom is appointed to a six-year term of office by the President and confirmed by the Senate, similar to many other high-level Executive <b>Branch</b> office <b>holders.</b> As with Postal Governors, PRC commissioners are permitted to serve for one additional [...] "holdover" [...] year beyond {{the end of their}} term if a replacement has not been nominated and confirmed. The President designates one Commissioner as Chairman of the Commission. The Commissioners together designate one of their number as a Vice-Chairman for a one-year term.

5000|$|In June 2012, during {{proceedings}} that {{related to}} the appointment of an administrator to HSUeast, Federal Court Justice Geoffery Flick criticised attempts by Jackson, through her solicitors, to directly contact him while proceedings were under way. Jackson subsequently responded by sacking her legal representatives and asking the judge to disqualify himself from the proceedings. At the end of June 2012, Justice Flick ordered that former judge Michael Moore be appointed administrator of HSUeast, that all federal and state <b>branch</b> office <b>holders</b> lose their positions and the branch be demerged to become separate NSW and Victorian-based unions. Justice Flick found that Jackson should not keep her position in the HSUeast because [...] "she is very much at the epicentre of the dispute".|$|R

Holder and Burnell produced the single together, and it was published under Noddy Holder Music Ltd./Whild John Music Ltd., and released via Speed Records.

40|$|Carbon nanofibers {{have been}} grown at room {{temperature}} {{using a combination of}} radio frequency and microwave assisted plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition. The nanofibers were grown, using Ni powder catalyst, onto substrates kept {{at room temperature}} by using a purposely designed water-cooled sample <b>holder.</b> <b>Branched</b> carbon nanofiber growth was obtained without using a template resulting in interconnected carbon nanofiber network formation on substrates held at room temperature. This method would allow room-temperature direct synthesized nanofiber networks over relatively large areas, for a range of temperature sensitive substrates, such as organic materials, plastics, and other polymers of interest for nanoelectronic two-dimensional networks, nanoelectromechanical devices, nanoactuators, and composite materials...|$|R
5000|$|Maréchal d'Empire, or Marshal of the Empire, {{was not a}} [...] "rank" [...] {{within the}} French Army, but a {{personal}} title granted to distinguished Divisional generals, along with higher pay and privileges. The same applied to the Corps commanders (General de Corps d'armee) and army commanders (General en chef). The highest permanent [...] "rank" [...] in Napoleon's army was actually Général de division and those higher than it were positions of the same rank but with separate insignia for appointment holders. [...] The position of Colonel General of a branch (such as Dragoons or Grenadiers of the Guard) was akin to Chief Inspector-General of that <b>branch,</b> whose office <b>holder</b> used his current officer rank and its corresponding insignia.|$|R
