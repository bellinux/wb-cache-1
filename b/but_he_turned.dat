5|$|On 1 April 1668, Lady Mainwaring died, and on 3 November {{the same}} year Ashmole married Elizabeth Dugdale (1632–1701), the much younger {{daughter}} of his friend and fellow herald, the antiquarian Sir William Dugdale. All of Elizabeth's pregnancies ended in stillbirths or miscarriages, and Ashmole remained childless. In 1675, he resigned as Windsor Herald, perhaps because of factional strife within the College of Arms. He was offered the post of Garter Principal King of Arms, which traditionally came with a knighthood, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> it down in favour of Dugdale.|$|E

5|$|The {{producers}} originally asked Anthony Hopkins and Clint Eastwood {{to provide}} {{the voice of the}} dentist, Dr. Wolfe, but they both turned the role down. Anthony Perkins was later asked to fulfill the role and he agreed, but died before the role could be recorded. In the end, the role went to Simpsons regular Hank Azaria. As well, the original panelist on Smartline was supposed to be O. J.

Rumors circulated about the University of Florida's interest in hiring Foster to fill its {{defensive coordinator}} position, but Foster declined to comment until after Florida's Jan. 2 Orange Bowl game. Foster proceeded through the interview process and was offered the job, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> it down in favor of remaining at Tech, which offered him contract incentives.|$|E
5|$|An {{enthusiastic}} {{reader and}} independent thinker as a child, Balzac had trouble {{adapting to the}} teaching style of his grammar school. His willful nature caused trouble throughout his life and frustrated his ambitions {{to succeed in the}} world of business. When he finished school, Balzac was apprenticed in a law office, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> his back on the study of law after wearying of its inhumanity and banal routine. Before and during his career as a writer, he attempted to be a publisher, printer, businessman, critic, and politician; he failed in all of these efforts. La Comédie Humaine reflects his real-life difficulties, and includes scenes from his own experience.|$|E

With the advance of the Germans, the nearby Royal Air Force base withdrew; Wodehouse was offered the sole spare seat in one of the fighter aircraft, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> down the opportunity as it would have meant leaving behind Ethel and their dog. On 21 May 1940, with German troops advancing through northern France, the Wodehouses decided to drive to Portugal and fly from there to the US. Two miles from home their car broke down, so they returned and borrowed a car from a neighbour; with the routes blocked with refugees, they returned home again.|$|E
5|$|Atrash {{supported}} {{formation of}} the United Arab Republic (UAR), a union between Syria and Egypt, in 1958. During the UAR years, Atrash became a devoted Nasserite—a supporter of President Gamal Abdel Nasser's policies—and wrote several articles in Nasserite daily newspaper Al Jamahir ("The People.") Atrash opposed the break-up of the union after a secessionist coup in September 1961, and opposed playing a political role in the anti-unionist governments that succeeded the UAR; Prime Minister Bashir al-Azma (term in 1962) offered him a cabinet post, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> down the offer, citing his ideological opposition to a secessionist government. Prime Minister Khalid al-Azm (term in 1962–63) appointed him minister of social affairs without asking him, but Atrash turned down that job as well.|$|E
5|$|For {{the female}} lead of Cliff's girlfriend Jenny, Sherilyn Fenn, Kelly Preston, Diane Lane and Elizabeth McGovern were {{considered}} before Jennifer Connelly was eventually cast. Campbell and Connelly's working relationship {{eventually led to}} a romantic coupling, which Johnston {{found to be a}} technique for method acting that helped with their on-screen chemistry. For Secord's sidekick, Peevy, Dave Stevens hoped that Lloyd Bridges would play the part, but Bridges turned it down and Alan Arkin was cast. The part of Neville Sinclair was offered to Jeremy Irons and Charles Dance before Timothy Dalton accepted the role. Lastly, the part of Eddie Valentine was written with Joe Pesci in mind, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> down the part, which went to Paul Sorvino.|$|E

5|$|Hipper {{set sail}} on 15 December for another raid and {{successfully}} bombarded several English towns, but British destroyers escorting the 1st BCS had already encountered German destroyers of the High Seas Fleet {{in the early}} morning and fought an inconclusive action with them. Communications failures meant that Beatty was not notified of this encounter for several hours afterwards, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> in pursuit of the German ships once he learned of their presence. The lead British ships were closing in on the Germans when Beatty learned that Scarborough was being shelled later that morning and he turned west to intercept the other German force.|$|E
5|$|Originally, {{the role}} of Scaramanga was offered to Jack Palance, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> the {{opportunity}} down. Christopher Lee, who was eventually chosen to portray Scaramanga, was Ian Fleming's step-cousin and Fleming had suggested Lee for {{the role of}} Dr. Julius No in the 1962 series opener Dr. No. Lee noted that Fleming was a forgetful man {{and by the time he}} mentioned this to Broccoli and Saltzman they had cast Joseph Wiseman in the part. Due to filming on location in Bangkok, his role in the film affected Lee's work the following year, as director Ken Russell was unable to sign Lee to play Specialist in the 1975 film Tommy, a part eventually given to Jack Nicholson.|$|E
5|$|While {{producers}} Broccoli and Saltzman originally sought Cary Grant for the role, they discarded {{the idea}} as Grant would {{be committed to}} only one feature film, and the producers decided to go after someone who {{could be part of}} a series. Richard Johnson has claimed to have been the first choice of the director, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> it down because he already had a contract with MGM and was intending to leave. Another actor purported to have been considered for the role was Patrick McGoohan on the strength of his portrayal of spy John Drake in the television series Danger Man: McGoohan turned down the role. Another potential Bond included David Niven, who would later play the character in the 1967 parody Casino Royale.|$|E

Danischewsky had been employed in the studio's advertising department, and Whisky Galore! was his first job in production. With the studio's directors all working on other products, Balcon and Danischewsky asked Ronald Neame to take the role, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> the offer down. A first-time director, Alexander Mackendrick, was chosen from within Ealing's workforce; he was employed as a production designer. The film {{was produced}} {{at the same time}} as Passport to Pimlico and Kind Hearts and Coronets; all three comedies were released into UK cinemas over two months.|$|E
5|$|In January 2007, Hall began a scripted {{rivalry with}} Massaro {{centered}} on Hall's jealousy of Massaro's recent Playboy appearance; the rivalry turned Hall into a villain and matches {{between the two}} mainly resulted in losses for Hall. During the feud, Hall attempted to prove that she was talented in areas beyond wrestling and being eye candy by creating a new in-ring persona, in which she sang badly at every opportunity, but {{thought she was a}} very good singer. She later attempted to impress music producer Timbaland by performing a song she claimed to have composed herself, looking for a spot in a video he was preparing and a possible future collaboration on a music project, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> her down. Massaro, with whom she had been involved in a rivalry, was one of the wrestlers who was chosen to work with Timbaland instead. Jealous of Massaro's recent successes, she attacked her and, in storyline, seriously injured her, with the reasoning that if she could not appear in Timbaland's music project, neither could Massaro.|$|E
5|$|While {{president}} of Congress, Hancock {{became involved in}} a long-running controversy with Harvard. As treasurer of the college since 1773, he had been entrusted with the school's financial records and about £15,000 in cash and securities. In the rush of events {{at the onset of}} the Revolutionary War, Hancock had been unable to return the money and accounts to Harvard before leaving for Congress. In 1777, a Harvard committee headed by James Bowdoin, Hancock's chief political and social rival in Boston, sent a messenger to Philadelphia to retrieve the money and records. Hancock was offended, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> over more than £16,000, though not all of the records, to the college. When Harvard replaced Hancock as treasurer, his ego was bruised, and for years he declined to settle the account or pay the interest on the money he had held, despite pressure put on him by Bowdoin and other political opponents. The issue dragged on until after Hancock's death, when his estate finally paid the college more than £1,000 to resolve the matter.|$|E

5|$|Peggy married Eric Mitchell {{because she}} was {{pregnant}} with Phil (Steve McFadden). Eric, a keen boxer, worked for gangster Johnny Allen (Billy Murray). Johnny would taunt Eric, making him do demeaning jobs because Eric was a better boxer than him. Eric {{fell in love with a}} woman called Maureen and planned to elope with her, but changed his mind, unable to desert his family, who he grew to resent. Eric took his anger out on Peggy and was often violent towards her and Phil.

Peggy considered leaving when her sons, Phil and Grant (Ross Kemp) were teenagers, and once even tried to seduce Johnny, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> her down. Eric cheated on Peggy with Claudette Hubbard (Ellen Thomas), who he also intended to run away with, but changed his mind, leading to Claudette hating the entire family.
