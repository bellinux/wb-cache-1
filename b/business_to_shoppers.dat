40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} pricing of malls in an {{environment}} where shoppers choose between a car and public transportation in getting to a suburban mall. The mall implicitly engages in mixed bundling; it sells goods bundled with parking <b>to</b> <b>shoppers</b> who come by car, and only goods <b>to</b> <b>shoppers</b> who come by public transportation. There are external costs of discomfort in public transportation due <b>to</b> crowdedness. Thus, <b>shoppers</b> using public transportation deter each other. The mall internalizes these external costs, much like a policy maker. To do so, it raises the sales price of the good and sets a parking fee less than parking’s marginal cost. Hence, parking is always a loss leader. Surprisingly, this pricing scheme is not necessarily distortionary...|$|R
