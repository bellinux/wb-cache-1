50|$|Apart {{from the}} buzzing display song, <b>blue-backed</b> <b>manakin</b> {{has a number}} of other calls, {{including}} a whee-whee-CHUP, sometimes given by two male in synchrony.|$|E
50|$|This {{species is}} similar to <b>blue-backed</b> <b>manakin,</b> Chiroxiphia pareola, which breeds further south and east, but the latter lacks the spiky tail, and the male has a {{somewhat}} darker blue back.|$|E
50|$|The Yungas manakin (Chiroxiphia boliviana) is {{a species}} of bird in the Pipridae family. It closely resembles the <b>blue-backed</b> <b>manakin,</b> but unlike that species it has dull dark red legs and is found in humid {{highland}} forests in the Yungas of southeastern Peru and Bolivia.|$|E
50|$|It {{closely resembles}} the lance-tailed manakin (C. lanceolata), the <b>blue-backed</b> <b>manakin</b> (C. pareola), the swallow-tailed manakin (C. caudata), and the Yungas manakin (C. boliviana), which {{all have the}} same red crown and blue back. There is, however, no overlap in range with these four species.|$|E
50|$|Like other manakins, the <b>blue-backed</b> <b>manakin</b> is a compact, brightly {{coloured}} forest bird, typically 13 cm {{long and}} weighing 19 g. The male is mainly black {{with a bright}} blue back, and pale orange legs. The crown is typically red, but yellow in C. pareola regina from the south-west Amazon.|$|E
50|$|It {{is found}} in {{southern}} Colombia, eastern Venezuela, the Guyanas, northeast Brazil, the Amazon Basin in Brazil, Bolivia, Ecuador and Peru; and in Tobago. A disjunct population exists on the coastal strip of southeast Brazil, about 3000 km long. The <b>blue-backed</b> <b>manakin</b> is absent in the northwest Amazon Basin, a region from central Venezuela to the southern border of Colombia. This manakin is a fairly common bird of dry and moist deciduous forests, but not rainforest.|$|E
50|$|This {{forested area}} has great biodiversity, {{including}} {{many species of}} birds (such as the dancing <b>blue-backed</b> <b>manakin),</b> mammals, frogs, (non-venomous) snakes, butterflies and other invertebrates. It {{is one of the}} most approachable areas of rainforest, since it is relatively small and there are government-appointed guides who provide an authoritative guiding service through the forest at a reasonable cost. The guides are knowledgeable about the plants and the animals, and can call down rare and exotic birds from the canopy by imitating their calls. Tobago also has nesting beaches for the leatherback turtle, which come to shore between April and July.|$|E
50|$|The male <b>blue-backed</b> <b>manakin</b> has a {{fascinating}} breeding display, unusual {{in that it}} is a cooperative display rather than competitive. Two males perch next to each other on a bare stick and jump up and down alternately, giving a buzzing call. When a female approaches, the perched bird moves backwards under the jumping bird, so the two perform a vertical circling movement. Groups of up to eight birds may perform together, with a different stick for each pair of displaying males. The female builds a twig nest in a tree; two brown-mottled white eggs are laid, and incubated entirely by the female for about 20 days.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>blue-backed</b> <b>manakin</b> (Chiroxiphia pareola) {{is a small}} {{passerine}} bird which breeds {{in tropical}} South America, its range extending from Colombia and Tobago to southeastern Brazil. It is found in deciduous forests but not evergreen rainforests. It is a small, plump bird about 13 cm long. Males have black plumage with a bright blue back and a red or yellow crown. Females and juveniles are olive-green with paler underparts. At breeding time, males {{are involved in a}} cooperative lekking behaviour during which they jump and twirl. This is a fairly common species with a wide range, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as being of [...] "least concern".|$|E
5000|$|The lance-tailed manakin (Chiroxiphia lanceolata) {{is a small}} {{passerine}} bird which breeds {{in tropical}} Central and South America from Costa Rica to northern Venezuela. This manakin is a fairly common bird of dry and moist deciduous forests, but not rainforest. It is a small, compact bird about 13 cm long and similar to the <b>blue-backed</b> <b>manakin,</b> but both sexes have the two central tail feathers elongated to form a spike. Males have black plumage with a blue back, a red crown and orange legs. Females and juveniles are olive-green with paler underparts. At breeding time, males {{are involved in a}} cooperative behaviour during which they jump up and down alternately. This is a fairly common species with a wide range, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as being of [...] "least concern".|$|E
