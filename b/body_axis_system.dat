40|$|BACKGROUND: Exposure to {{anthropogenic}} chemicals during {{development can}} disrupt the morphogenesis of organ systems. Use of the herbicide atrazine has been debated {{in recent years}} because of its implicated, but poorly characterized, effects on vertebrates. Previous studies primarily {{examined the effects of}} atrazine exposure during metamorphosis or early developmental stages of amphibians. OBJECTIVES: We sought to identify and characterize the susceptibility during the often-overlooked developmental stage of organ morphogenesis. METHODS: We used a static renewal experimental treatment to investigate the effects of 10, 25, and 35 mg/L atrazine from early organ morphogenesis through the onset of tadpole feeding in the aquatic amphibian model system, Xenopus laevis. We quantified malformations of the <b>body</b> <b>axis,</b> heart, and intestine, as well as apoptosis in the midbrain and pronephric kidney. RESULTS: We found a significant dose-dependent increase in the percentage of atrazine-exposed tadpoles with malformations of multiple tissues including the main <b>body</b> <b>axis,</b> circulatory <b>system,</b> kidney, and digestive system. Incidence of apoptotic cells also increased in the both midbrain and kidney of atrazine-exposed tadpoles. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that acute atrazine exposure (10 – 35 mg/L for ≤ 48 hr) during early organ morphogenesis disrupts proper organ development in an amphibian model system. The concurrent atrazine-induced apoptosis in the pronephric kidney and midbrain begins to elucidate a mechanism by which atrazine may disrupt developmental processes in nontarget organisms...|$|R
40|$|A partly {{non-linear}} time-domain {{numerical model}} {{is used for}} the prediction of parametric roll resonance in regular waves. The ship is assumed to be a system with four degrees of freedom, namely, sway, heave, roll and pitch. The non-linear incident wave and hydrostatic restoring forces/moments are evaluated considering the instantaneous wetted surface whereas the hydrodynamic forces and moments, including diffraction, are expressed in terms of convolution integrals based on the mean wetted surface. The model also accounts for non-potential roll damping expressed in an equivalent linearised form. Finally, the coupled equations of motion are solved in the time-domain referenced to a <b>body</b> fixed <b>axis</b> <b>system.</b> This method is applied to a range of hull forms, a post-Panamax C 11 class containership, a transom stern Trawler and the ITTC-A 1 containership, all travelling in regular waves.

40|$|Five midsagittal pelvic {{reference}} {{lines have}} been employed to quantify prolapse using MRI. However, the lack of standardization makes study results difficult to compare. Using MRI scans from 149 women, we demonstrate how use of existing reference lines can systematically affect measurements in three distinct ways: in oblique line systems, distances measured to the reference line vary with antero-posterior location; soft issue-based reference lines can underestimate organ movement relative to the pelvic bones; and systems defined relative to the MR scanner are affected by intra- and interindividual differences in the pelvic inclination angle at rest and strain. Thus, we propose a standardized approach called the Pelvic Inclination Correction System (PICS).

This necessity is more evident when light aircraft and sailplanes are involved [...] This paper presents {{an attempt to}} give simulation possibility almost to everyone {{through the use of}} JDynaSim code, written to meet this goal. JDynaSim is an interactive graphic flight simulation code written in JAVA and VRML languages which practically allows everyone to fly the aeroplane under investigation. This is true {{due to the fact that}} JAVA is a language born to work under a generic Internet browser (such as Microsoft Explorer or Netscape) and thus it is independent from the operating system under which it is running. Dynamic motion equations are solved by 12 ordinary non-linear differential equations in which the non-linear forces are input in multidimensional matrix form and are interpolated at each time instant. Advancing in time is performed using a 4 th order Runge-Kutta integration scheme. Translation equations of motion are written in a flight path axis system while rotational equations are written on <b>body</b> <b>axis</b> <b>system.</b> An on-purpose written pre-processor has to be used to transform forces to appropriate reference system.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Aerospace Engineering. "December 2006. "Includes bibliographic {{references}} (leaves 134 - 140) Icing {{can pose}} problems due to both accretions on aircraft aerodynamic surfaces {{as well as}} through shedding of large ice particles from aircraft surfaces. The shed ice causes damage by impacting downstream aerodynamic surfaces and on ingestion by aft mounted engines. Present ice trajectory simulation tools have limited capabilities {{due to the lack of}} experimental aerodynamic force and moment data for ice fragments and the large number of variables that can affect the trajectories of ice particles in the aircraft flowfield like the particle shape, size, mass, initial velocity, particle shedding location and orientation during shedding. A comprehensive literature review of experimental studies related to "random-shape" bluff body aerodynamics was conducted to support the development of a list of ice fragments for consideration in this research effort. Recommendations were also obtained from aircraft engine manufacturers and industry partners in developing the ice fragment list. Fifteen ice shapes were identified for aerodynamic testing and they were prioritized based on input from industry. The top three were selected for the present wind tunnel study. The ice fragments selected included a rectangular slab, a semicircular shell and a hemispherical shell. The literature review of experimental studies yielded a variety of methods employed by other investigators in obtaining force and moment data for randomshape bodies. However, in most previous experimental investigations force and moment data were obtained for infinite aspect ratio (2 D) fragments. The research described in this thesis was performed to establish 3 D six degree of freedom experimental force and moment data in the WSU 7 -ft by 10 -ft wind tunnel facility. The data obtained will be used in the probabilistic trajectory simulation methods of "random-shape" ice fragments employed at WSU. Experimental results are presented for five ice fragment configurations and include lift, drag and side force coefficients. In certain cases, the pitching, yawing and rolling moment coefficients are also provided. The data was reduced from the balance <b>body</b> <b>axis</b> <b>system</b> to the wind axis system. Transformations were developed to obtain the force and moment data at the model resolving center from the balance virtual center. The forces and moments were resolved by the WSU external balance at the virtual center. Detailed discussions are provided on the effects on the aerodynamic force and moment data due to the test mount, test section wall, model-mount interference, aspect-ratio, ice fragment shape and the associated Reynolds number. Moreover, the flowfield about selected ice fragments was computed using simulation tools like FLUENT (a Navier-Stokes solver) and GAMBIT (meshing preprocessor) to elucidate flow behavior and sting-model interference effects.
