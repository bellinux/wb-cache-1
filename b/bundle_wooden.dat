5000|$|The rute stick {{is held in}} {{the same}} way as a drum stick, and {{therefore}} is usually held either with a matched grip or a traditional grip. The [...] "handle" [...] of the rute is the plastic area, as the drum or cymbal is struck with the wooden [...] "rutes" [...] or <b>bundles</b> of <b>wooden</b> stick.|$|R

50|$|The art of beading, or stringing, {{follows the}} serial process and seriate {{composition}} of Yoruba art, {{an extension of}} the fundamental principle of ase. One bead in a step-by-step (leseese) or one-by-one (leto-lto) manner. Just as the wrapped <b>bundle</b> of <b>wooden</b> sticks (atoori) on an ancestral altar symbolizes the continuity of a family legacy, beads symbolize consistent continuity from generation to generation. When threaded together, beads represent solidarity and unity.|$|R
5000|$|The {{office of}} quaestor, usually a former broad-striped tribune, was adopted {{as the first}} {{official}} post of the [...] ( [...] course of offices), the standard sequence that made up a career in public service. Once elected as quaestor, a Roman man {{earned the right to}} sit in the Senate and began progressing through the [...] Quaestors were also given a [...] (a bound <b>bundle</b> of <b>wooden</b> rods symbolizing a magistrate's authority and jurisdiction) and were entitled to one [...] (civil servant bodyguard).|$|R
5000|$|Fasces ( [...] , (Fasci, , a plurale tantum, {{from the}} Latin word , meaning [...] "bundle") is a bound <b>bundle</b> of <b>wooden</b> rods, {{sometimes}} including an axe with its blade emerging. The fasces had its {{origin in the}} Etruscan civilization, and was passed on to ancient Rome, where it symbolized a magistrate's power and jurisdiction. The axe originally associated with the symbol, the Labrys (Greek: , [...] ) the double-bitted axe, originally was from Crete in Greece, {{is one of the}} oldest symbols of Greek civilization. To the Romans, it was known as a bipennis. Commonly, the symbol was associated with female divinities, from prehistoric through historic times.|$|R
5000|$|The {{anthropomorphous}} sarcophagi resemble {{imitations of}} funeral <b>bundles</b> provided with <b>wooden</b> masks {{typical of the}} [...] "Middle Horizon", a dominant culture on the coast and highlands, {{also known as the}} Tiwanaku-Wari culture. The [...] "mausoleums" [...] may be modified forms of the chullpa or pucullo, elements of funeral architecture observed throughout the Andes, especially in the Tiwanaku and Wari cultures.|$|R
50|$|He noted {{there were}} 15 to 20 baptized Huron {{among the dead}} (rings with Christian symbols were later found at the site.) That evening, the bodies were lowered into the pit with three kettles, which were to help the souls reach the after life. If a bundle fell, {{it was time for}} {{everything}} else (<b>bundles,</b> gifts, corn, <b>wooden</b> stakes and sand) to be thrown in as well. As the pit was filled and covered over, the crowds screamed and sang. Brébeuf described the scene as emotional and chaotic, representing the Huron’s perception of mortality and life in general.|$|R
5000|$|In {{contradiction to}} his species preference, his {{weapon of choice}} is not a club, but rather a {{converted}} siege-crossbow. Originally, this fired a blunt-but-enormous metal bolt, but after further modifications {{he made it to}} shoot a large <b>bundle</b> of <b>wooden</b> bolts at once and renamed the bow as the Piecemaker(c.f. Colt Single Action Army, also known as the Peacemaker). Due to the various forces they are under, the bolts, once fired, quickly become an expanding cloud of high-speed burning wooden shrapnel, resembling less a crossbow and more a blunderbuss. The first time it was fired, it removed several archery targets, the bunker wall behind them, and a flock of seagulls directly above Detritus. Samuel Vimes appreciates its intimidation factor, but otherwise discourages its use except under extreme circumstances. As Vimes himself put it after a single shot from Piecemaker ripped a castles gates to shreds, [...] "Ye, Gods, Detritus. Thats not a weapon. Thats a national emergency." [...] Vimes also once had to remind Detritus that [...] "When Mr safety catch is not on, Mr Crossbow is not your friend." ...|$|R
6000|$|Wednesday, August 15th.--I went to Commencement at Williams College,-- {{five miles}} distant. At the tavern were {{students}} with ribbons, pink or blue, fluttering from their buttonholes, these being the badges of rival societies. There was a considerable gathering of people, chiefly arriving in wagons or buggies, some in barouches, {{and very few}} in chaises. The most characteristic part of the scene was where the pedlers, gingerbread-sellers, etc., were collected, {{a few hundred yards}} from the meeting-house. There was a pedler there from New York State, who sold his wares by auction, and I could have stood and listened to him all day long. Sometimes he would put up a heterogeny [this is a word made by Mr. Hawthorne, but one that was needed.--S. H.] of articles in a lot,--as a paper of pins, a lead-pencil, and a shaving-box,--and knock them all down, perhaps for ninepence. Bunches of lead-pencils, steel-pens, pound-cakes of shaving-soap, gilt finger-rings, bracelets, clasps, and other jewelry, cards of pearl buttons, or steel ("there is some steel about them, gentlemen, for my brother stole 'em, and I bore him out in it"), <b>bundles</b> of <b>wooden</b> combs, boxes of matches, suspenders, and, in short, everything,--dipping his hand down into his wares with the promise of a wonderful lot, and producing, perhaps, a bottle of opodeldoc, and joining it with a lead-pencil,--and when he had sold several things of the same kind, pretending huge surprise at finding [...] "just one more," [...] if the lads lingered; saying, [...] "I could not afford to steal them for the price; for the remorse of conscience would be worth more,"--all the time keeping an eye upon those who bought, calling for the pay, making change with silver or bills, and deciding on the goodness of banks; and saying to the boys who climbed upon his cart, [...] "Fall down, roll down, tumble down, only get down"; and uttering everything in the queer, humorous recitative in which he sold his articles. Sometimes he would pretend that a person had bid, either by word or wink, and raised a laugh thus; never losing his self-possession, nor getting out of humor. When a man asked whether a bill were good: [...] "No! do you suppose I'd give you good money?" [...] When he delivered an article, he exclaimed, [...] "You're the lucky man," [...] setting off his wares with the most extravagant eulogies. The people bought very freely, and seemed also to enjoy the fun. One little boy bought a shaving-box, perhaps meaning to speculate upon it. This character could not possibly he overdrawn; and he was really excellent, with his allusions to what was passing, intermingled, doubtless, with a good deal that was studied. He was a man between thirty and forty, with a face expressive of other ability, as well as of humor.|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{sounds very}} well," [...] said Baxter, [...] "but {{in all those}} {{southern}} countries you must be prepared in winter for {{the rigors of the}} climate. The sun is pretty warm sometimes at this season, but {{as soon as you get}} out of it you will freeze to death if you are not careful. The only way to keep warm is to be in the sun, out of the wind, and that won't work on rainy days, and winter is the rainy season, you know. In the houses it is as cold as ice, and the fires don't amount to anything. You might as well light a <b>bundle</b> of <b>wooden</b> tooth-picks and put it in the fire-place. If you could sleep all the time you might be comfortable, for they give you a feather-bed to cover yourself with. Outside you may do well enough if you keep up a steady walking, but indoors you will have hard work to keep warm. You must wear chest-protectors. They sell them down there--great big ones, made of rabbit-skins; and a nice thing for a man to have to wear in the house is a pair of cloth bags lined with fur. They would keep his feet and legs warm when he isn't walking. It is well, too, to have a pair of smaller fur bags for your hands when you are in the house. You can have a little hole in the end of one of them through which you can stick a pen-holder, and then you can write letters. An india-rubber bag, filled with hot water, to lower down your back, is a great comfort. You haven't any idea how cold your spine gets in those warm countries. And, if I were you, I'd avoid a place where you see them carting coal stoves around. Those are the worst spots. And you need not expect to get one of the stoves, not while they can sell you wood at two sticks for a franc. You had better go to some place where they are not accustomed to having tourists. In the regular resorts they are afraid to make any show of keeping warm, for fear people will think they are in the habit of having cold weather. And in Italy you've got to be precious careful, or you'll be taken sick. And another thing. I suppose you brought a great deal of baggage with you. You, for instance," [...] said our friend, turning to me, [...] "packed up, I suppose, a heavy overcoat for cold weather, and a lighter one, and a good winter suit, and a good summer one, besides another for spring and fall, and an old suit to lie about in in the orange groves, and a dress suit, besides such convenient articles as old boots for tramping in, pocket-lanterns, and so forth." ...|$|R
