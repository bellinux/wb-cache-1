At this time, the south aisle, nave and chancel were also recorded as leaded.|$|E

5|$|Military {{strategy}} and military training {{were treated as}} sciences that could be studied and perfected; soldiers were tested in their skills of using weaponry and in their athletic ability. The troops were trained to follow signal standards to advance at the waving of banners and to halt {{at the sound of}} <b>bells</b> <b>and</b> drums.|$|E
5|$|The English Reformation inevitably {{affected}} St Helen's Church. EdwardVI's 1547 injunction {{decreed that}} all images in churches {{were to be}} dismantled or destroyed, including stained glass, shrines, roods, statues and <b>bells,</b> <b>and</b> altars were {{to be replaced by}} wooden tables. Damage during the Civil War was minimal; there are pike marks on the stonework. The church may have been fortified as part of the defences of the castle, a Royalist stronghold.|$|E
5|$|An {{apprentice}} boilermaker {{before the}} war, Maxwell returned to Australia in 1919 {{and worked as}} a gardener.

5|$|Between 270 and 500, Hellenistic (Ctesibius, Hero of Alexandria, Archimedes) and Roman horologists and astronomers began {{developing}} {{more elaborate}} mechanized water clocks. The added complexity {{was aimed at}} regulating the flow and at providing fancier displays of the passage of time. For example, some water clocks rang <b>bells</b> <b>and</b> gongs, while others opened doors and windows to show figurines of people, or moved pointers, and dials. Some even displayed astrological models of the universe.|$|E
5|$|Bone, {{both human}} and animal, was also sculpted; human bones may have been trophies, or relics of ancestors. The Maya valued Spondylus shells, and worked them to remove the white {{exterior}} and spines, to reveal the fine orange interior. Around the 10th century AD, metallurgy arrived in Mesoamerica from South America, and the Maya began to make small objects in gold, silver and copper. The Maya generally hammered sheet metal into objects such as beads, <b>bells,</b> <b>and</b> discs. In the last centuries before the Spanish Conquest, the Maya began to use the lost-wax method to cast small metal pieces.|$|E
5|$|Cats hunt small prey, {{primarily}} {{birds and}} rodents, {{and are often}} used {{as a form of}} pest control. Domestic cats are a major predator of wildlife in the United States, killing an estimated 1.4–3.7 billion birds and 6.9–20.7 billion mammals annually. The bulk of predation in the United States is done by 80 million feral and stray cats. Effective measures to reduce this population are elusive, meeting opposition from cat enthusiasts. In the case of free-ranging pets, equipping cats with <b>bells</b> <b>and</b> not letting them out at night will reduce wildlife predation.|$|E

5|$|Christ Church, {{although}} a larger building than St John's, {{is the daughter}} church in Radyr. Designed by the Llandaff diocesan surveyor George Halliday, the nave was ready for use at Easter 1904 and the chancel and tower were completed in November 1910. Also in 1910 John Taylor & Co of Loughborough cast a ring of eight bells for the tower. Lieutenant Colonel Fisher paid for the <b>bells,</b> <b>and</b> each bell is inscribed {{with the names of}} members of his family.|$|E
5|$|Each {{bulkhead}} {{could be}} sealed by watertight doors. The engine rooms and boiler {{rooms on the}} tank top deck had vertically closing doors that could be controlled remotely from the bridge, lowered automatically by a float if water was present, or closed manually by the crew. These took about 30 seconds to close; warning <b>bells</b> <b>and</b> alternate escape routes were provided so that the crew would not be trapped by the doors. Above the tank top level, on the Orlop Deck, F Deck and E Deck, the doors closed horizontally and were manually operated. They could be closed at the door itself or from the deck above.|$|E
5|$|East Worldham {{contains}} 10 Grade II listed buildings. St Mary's Church is of Transitional Norman {{architecture and}} is a Grade II* listed building. Notable features include triple lancet windows, a small pointed tower, three <b>bells,</b> <b>and</b> stained glass by Hardman & Co.. The chancel was restored in 1864, and in 1865, the nave was rebuilt. During the late restoration, a stone monument, like a coffin, was found under {{the floor of the}} church, which contained the figure of a 13th-century lady. Magdalen College, Oxford is patron of the vicarage. A church school was built in 1864 upon a site donated by James Dutton, 3rd Baron Sherborne.|$|E

2500|$|In 1978, Homosexualities {{received}} a negative review from Michael Lynch in The Body Politic. It was also reviewed by Norman C. Murphy in The Advocate. With Dean Gengle, Murphy presented {{a discussion with}} Bell about his book. Lynch argued that Homosexualities was in part an attempt by <b>Bell</b> <b>and</b> Weinberg to overcome statistical weaknesses {{in the work of}} Kinsey and his colleagues, and that as a result <b>Bell</b> <b>and</b> Weinberg had put more effort into [...] "data processing" [...] than into [...] "understanding the premises and conclusions of the study." [...] Lynch suggested that <b>Bell</b> <b>and</b> Weinberg were [...] "sometimes silently at odds" [...] with Kinsey and his colleagues, and that they had limited their accomplishments by beginning with an attempt to test negative stereotypes about gay people. Lynch criticized <b>Bell</b> <b>and</b> Weinberg for using language that contained implied value judgments, and suggested that their division of homosexuals into five different [...] "types" [...] was a value-laden classification. Lynch disagreed with what he saw as <b>Bell</b> <b>and</b> Weinberg's attempt to [...] "demote the sense of unified or shared experience among gays", and criticized their failure to [...] "attempt to delineate the experience we all share." [...] He maintained that because <b>Bell</b> <b>and</b> Weinberg's respondents were mainly middle class, <b>Bell</b> <b>and</b> Weinberg were unable to further explore Kinsey's findings about [...] "the division of sexual and sex-related behavior based on class." [...] Lynch considered <b>Bell</b> <b>and</b> Weinberg naive to believe that Homosexualities would make legislators and community leaders change their negative attitudes to gay people.|$|R

5|$|Falkner Island Light {{was chosen}} for fog-signal {{experiments}} in 1865 and in 1902. In 1865, Joseph Henry of the Smithsonian Institution, the Chairman of the Lighthouse Board, set up <b>bells</b> <b>and</b> whistles and tested the distances they could be heard. In 1879, a steam fog whistle was installed {{at the cost of}} $5000. In 1902, a air siren was installed and powered by two 16½ horsepower engines and used in an experiment in sound penetration. In 1934, a Leslie-Tyfon trumpet was installed.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the film}} would not feature any songs, the {{directors}} hired James Newton Howard to compose the score. Approaching it as a live-action film, Howard {{decided to have}} different musical themes for the cultures of the surface world and Atlantis. In the case of Atlantis, Howard chose an Indonesian orchestral sound incorporating chimes, <b>bells,</b> <b>and</b> gongs. The directors told Howard that the film would {{have a number of}} key scenes without dialogue; the score would need to convey emotionally what the viewer was seeing on screen.|$|E
5|$|The {{city also}} has festivals {{representing}} its cultural heritage. Twice each year, {{there is a}} Tejikara Fire Festival. It first occurs on the second Saturday of April at Tejikarao Shrine and it again occurs on the second Sunday of August at Nagara River Park. Half-naked men ring <b>bells,</b> <b>and</b> carry shrines and other devices that shoot off large sparks. Near the end of August, the city sponsors Takigi Noh, a traditional form of Japanese theater that takes place {{on the banks of}} the Nagara River, lit only by the surrounding bonfires and the fires of cormorant boats.|$|E

5000|$|Subsequent to the {{issuance}} of the <b>Bell</b> <b>and</b> Tainter patent No. 341214, Edison {{announced that he would}} shortly produce his 'new phonograph' which, when it appeared, was in fact nothing but the <b>Bell</b> <b>and</b> Tainter record set forth in their patent 341214, being a record cut or engraved in wax or wax-like material, although Edison always insisted on calling this record an 'indented' record, doubtless because his original tin-foil record was an 'indented' record. Edison was compelled to acknowledge that his 'new phonograph' was an infringement of the <b>Bell</b> <b>and</b> Tainter patent 341214, and took out a license under the <b>Bell</b> <b>and</b> Tainter patent and made his records under that patent as the result of that license.|$|R
