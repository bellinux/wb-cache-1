40|$|Background : We {{measured}} {{the effect of}} 30 milliliters (mL) of 4 % lidocaine gel on the <b>breasts</b> and chest <b>wall</b> of healthy women covered for 1 h on plasma concentrations of lidocaine and its principal metabolite, monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX), electrocardiogram (EKG) results, and adverse events. Materials and Methods: This institutional review board-approved, prospective, open-label study complied with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). The study evaluated 10 healthy women aged 42 - 75 years with 30 mL of 4 % lidocaine gel on {{the skin of the}} <b>breasts</b> and chest <b>wall</b> covered for 1 h. Cardiac and neurological assessments were performed and blood was drawn for lidocaine and MEGX levels at baseline and 1 / 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 h after application. EKGs were performed before application and at 3 h. Subjects provided informed written consent. Primary and secondary outcomes were plasma concentrations of lidocaine and MEGX and frequency of adverse events, respectively. Statistical analysis included paired t-tests for EKGs and repeated measures regression for vital signs. Results: No lidocaine was detected in the blood of 9 of 10 subjects. One subject had low plasma concentrations of lidocaine just above the level of detection the first 4 h after application only. No MEGX was detected. Mean decrease in heart rate was likely multifactorial. Conclusion: Thirty mL of 4 % lidocaine gel on the <b>breasts</b> and chest <b>wall</b> covered for 1 h in healthy women resulted in plasma concentrations of lidocaine and MEGX well below therapeutic or toxic levels and no clinically significant adverse events...|$|R

The treatments were planned at three centres belonging to one organisation over a period of 3 months. All 151 plans were used to evaluate inter-centre consistency and compliance with a local planning protocol. A subset of 79 plans, from one centre, were used in a more detailed evaluation of the effects of anatomical asymmetry on heart and lung dose, the effects of a metallic temporary tissue expander port on dose homogeneity and the overall conformity and homogeneity achieved in routine breast treatment planning. Differences in anatomical structure contouring and nomenclature were identified between the three centres, with all centres showing some non-compliance with the local planning protocol. When evaluated against standard conformity indices, these breast plans performed relatively poorly. However, when evaluated against recommended organ-at-risk tolerances, all evaluated plans performed sufficiently well that tighter planning tolerances could be recommended for future planning. Heart doses calculated in left <b>breast</b> and chest <b>wall</b> treatments were significantly higher than heart doses calculated in right sided <b>breast</b> and chest <b>wall</b> treatments (p. 001). In the treatment involving a temporary tissue expander, the inflated implant effectively pushed the targeted breast issue away from the healthy tissues, leading to a dose distribution that was relatively conformal, although attenuation through the tissue expander’s metallic port may have been underestimated by the treatment planning system. The results of this study exemplify the use of bulk treatment planning data to evaluate clinical workloads and inform ongoing treatment planning...|$|R

50|$|Towering in the Bielsko-Biała city centre, the Castle is {{the oldest}} and largest {{construction}} of historical importance, erected in the old town of Bielsko. A legend says that in its place {{there used to be}} a settlement of robbers who attacked travelling merchants. The Opolski Prince, Casimir (1229/30) of the Piasts is said to have conquered that fortalice, wiped out the robbers and had the hunting palace erected in that place, which over the years grew into a magnificent castle around which the city of Bielsko developed. The oldest part of the Castle dates back to 14th century. Over the next centuries the Castle gradually developed and transformed. It is a city castle in its nature, incorporated into the system of Bielsko fortifications from the beginning, at the same time providing their strongest section. Over the centuries it performed the function of a Silesian border-stronghold, first guarding the borders of Cieszyn and Oświęcim district duchies and then in the second half of the 15th century it protected the Czech and Polish state border and from 1526 - the Austrian-Polish border. Starting from the close of the 16th century, its defensive role was declining and the Castle gradually transformed into a nobleman’s mansion. The present appearance of the castle dates back to the last, thorough reconstruction undertaken in the second half of the 19th century, which entirely wiped out its previous characteristics of style. During the years 1899-1973, in place of brick <b>breast</b> <b>wall</b> presently seen on the east part of the Castle, {{there used to be a}} parade of bazaars, constituting an attractive architectural foundation for the body of the Castle. The bazaars were pulled down in connection with widening of Zamkowa Street. The Castle erected by Piasts ruling over the Cieszyn Dutchy was one of their residences for over two centuries. From 1572 it was the administrative and commercial centre of the independent class-based Bielsko state, governed by representatives of nobleman’s families of the Promnitzes, Schaffgotsches, Sunneghs, Solmses and Haugwitzes. In 1752, the position of that state was raised to the position of duchies which went into the rule of the Sułkowskis family. The Bielsko Dutchy existed until 1849, when Austria introduced modern administrative division, thus doing away with old feudal structures and was incorporated into Bielsko District Starosty. The Castle itself and numerous estates in the vicinity of the city remained in the possession of the Sułkowskis until 1945. After World War II the Castle was taken over by the Polish State as the property left by the Germans and was facilitated as the seat of many cultural institutions. Since 1983 the Castle sole usufructary has been the national Museum in Bielsko-Biała, subordinated to Silesian local government in Katowice.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To obtain more {{accurate}} {{data on the}} electron density of tissues {{to be used in}} the treatment planning of breast cancer patients. Methods and materials: Single kV(p) quantitative computed tomography was applied in 70 women, 20 to 77 years old, to study the electron density of the <b>breast,</b> the thoracic <b>wall</b> close and parallel to the breast, and the lung parenchyma. Results: The electron density of the entire breast decreases with increasing age in premenopausal women and remains practically constant in postmenopausal women (8 % less than that of water). No difference was found in the electron densities of the right and left breast. The electron density of the lung parenchyma in proximity to the breast is lower than the density in the entire lung parenchyma. Conclusions: Whenever no accurate data is available on individual patients, the electron density values to be used in treatment planning for <b>breast</b> and thoracic <b>wall</b> have to take into account both age and menstrual status. The regional differences in electron density of the lung also have to be considered. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Inc...|$|R

40|$|Based on {{the theory}} of {{hydraulic}} transients and the method of characteristics (MOC), a mathematic model of the differential surge tank with pressure-reduction orifices (PROs) and overflow weirs for transient calculation is proposed. The numerical model of hydraulic transients is established using the data of a practical hydropower station; and the probable transients are simulated. The results show that successive load rejection is critical for calculating the maximum pressure in spiral case and the maximum rotating speed of runner when the bifurcated pipe is converging under the surge tank in a diversion-type hydropower station; the pressure difference between two sides of <b>breast</b> <b>wall</b> is large during transient conditions, {{and it would be}} more serious when simultaneous load rejections happen after load acceptance; the reasonable arrangement of PROs on <b>breast</b> <b>wall</b> can effectively decrease the pressure difference...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{short-term}} displacement and reproducibility of the <b>breast</b> or chest <b>wall,</b> and {{the internal}} mammary (IM), infraclavicular (ICV), and supraclavicular (SCV) nodal regions have been assessed {{as a function of}} breath-hold state using an active breathing control (ABC) device for patients receiving loco-regional breast radiation therapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Ten patients underwent computed tomographic scanning using an ABC device at breath-hold states of end-exhale and 20 %, 40 %, 60 %, and 80 % of vital capacity (VC). Patients underwent scanning before treatment and at one third and two thirds of the way through treatment. A regional registration was performed for each target using a rigid-body transformation with mutual information as a metric. RESULTS: Between exhale and 40 % of VC, the mean displacement was 0. 27 / 0. 34, 0. 24 / 0. 31, 0. 22 / 0. 19, and 0. 13 / 0. 19 cm anterior/superior for the <b>breast</b> or chest <b>wall,</b> and IM, ICV, and SCV nodes, respectively. At 80 % of VC, the mean displacement from exhale was 0. 84 /. 88, 0. 76 /. 79, 0. 70 / 0. 79, and 0. 54 / 0. 56 cm anterior/superior for the <b>breast</b> or chest <b>wall,</b> and IM, ICV, and SCV nodes, respectively.
