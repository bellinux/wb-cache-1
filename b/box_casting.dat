So {{when he got to}} Teelee Portage he figured a steamboat would get to Forty Mile quicker than his raft. He transferred his cargo, and there you are, fore-lower deck of the Golden Rocket, Flush of Gold being married, and Dave Walsh in his big <b>box</b> <b>casting</b> the shade for her. And there’s one thing I clean forgot. No wonder I thought the husky dog that came aboard at Teelee Portage was familiar. It was Pee-lat, Dave Walsh’s lead-dog and favourite—a terrible fighter, too.

The cylinders were mounted beneath the smokebox and a transverse crankshaft ran crossways beneath the boiler, just ahead of the firebox. The frame of these engines was a large iron <b>box</b> <b>casting</b> that formed a single piece foundation for both the engine and boiler.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Melt {{flow and}} casting {{solidification}} are essential {{parts of the}} permanent mold casting process and affect significantly the quality of castings．For this reason, accurate prediction of mold filling pattern and temperature field in permanent mold castings plays on {{an important role in}} producing sound castings. In this paper, the model filling and solidification of a <b>box</b> <b>casting</b> produced from an aluminum alloy is studied. Different casting processes are employed, simulated and optimized to obtain sound castings. Simulation results reveal that with appropriate gating system, pouring rate, cooling line, a smooth mold filling, reduced shrinkages and other defects are available and desired sound castings can be produced...|$|E
40|$|The {{conversion}} of rapid prototyping models into metallic tools for plastics injection using a ceramic moulding process is presented. The process main steps {{used in this}} experimental work were: production of the model (by rapid prototyping or conventional techniques), conversion into a silicone mould, production of a ceramic mould by casting a ceramic slurry that suffers a sol-gel reaction into a <b>box,</b> <b>casting</b> an alloy and finishing. Processing parameters like preheating of the ceramic moulds, pouring temperature and heat-treating of the moulds have a very important influence on the final characteristics of the metallic tools. This work presents {{the influence of the}} above parameters on the surface roughness, mechanical strength, dimensional changes, microstructure and capacity of details reproduction of the metallic tools...|$|E
40|$|Clear, {{physical}} models or phantoms {{are needed for}} particle image velocimetry (PIV) to accurately record fluid velocities within complex geometries including anatomical structures. Based on Karina Arcaute’s work on “Complex Silicon Cardiovascular Models Manufactured Using a Dip-Spin Coating Technique”, a <b>box</b> <b>casting</b> technique was developed to provide the most effective phantom for testing. The phantom is required {{to be free of}} visual obstructions, thus allowing a CCD camera to capture accurate velocity readings. In this study, complex parts were made of a water-soluble material and sanded until all ridges were removed. The model was created using a fused deposition modeling (FDM) machine. The FDM machine deposits a thermoplastic or water-soluble material layer-by-layer on a platform. Once fully cast, the phantom is placed into a sonic bath to remove the water soluble material, leaving a clear cast. Different sanding and casting methods were explored. The most effective and time efficient technique was recorded to help erase confusion when another phantom is needed. The material chosen for casting was Sylgard 184 – a silicone with a refractive index of 1. 41. The refractive index of the phantom material and of the liquid used for the experiment must match to enable accurately measurements...|$|E

40|$|The European Court of Justice (ECJ) {{has become}} an {{influential}} player {{in the field of}} direct taxation in the European Union in the past twenty years. However, it is unclear whether the ECJ’s decisions actually increase tax neutrality and therefore contribute to the achievement of an internal market as stipulated by the European treaties or not.

40|$|Gavin Turk is {{a leading}} figure in British {{contemporary}} art. His 1991 degree show work Cave, a blue ceramic plaque commemorating his occupancy of a studio, and Pop, the waxwork figure of himself as Sid Vicious, are among the iconic artworks of the 1990 s. His "self-portrait" signatures and his finely crafted sculptures of everyday objects (such as cardboard <b>boxes</b> <b>cast</b> in bronze) bring the commonplace into an art space and challenge the viewer to engage in new ways. In 2003 he created the major sculpture Her for an exhibition at the New Art Centre Sculpture Park and Gallery. This image of "Ariadne in a sleeping bag" draws together many of his key concerns, including the paintings of early modernism and the complexity of sculptural forms, and ideas of authorship, identity and authenticity.

2500|$|The Post Office {{commissioned}} a new design of pillar box in 1980 from {{a panel of}} three competing designers. The competition was won by Tony Gibbs and his design, which {{was thought to be}} ultra-modern at the time, was designated Type K by the Post Office. Made in traditional cast iron, it stayed in production until 2000. Notable features included: replaceable lifting ring screwed into the dome of the box, body and roof of <b>box</b> <b>cast</b> as one piece, large easy-to-read collection time plate, all surface details and collection plate window recessed to give a perfect cylindrical outline, integral restrictor plate, know colloquially as a [...] "Belfast Flap" [...] to restrict posting to letters only and a flanged shallow base suitable for installation in modern buildings, shopping centres and other urban areas. These boxes were thus much easier to move and handle as they could be rolled over level ground or lifted by crane into position. The design had one major flaw {{in the area of the}} door hinge, which is prone to snap under stress and the K type pillar boxes are no longer being installed.|$|R
