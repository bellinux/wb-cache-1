25|$|It was {{reported}} in 2007 that with increased worldwide prosperity and the competition of <b>bio-fuel</b> production for feed stocks, both the demand for {{and the price of}} milk had substantially increased worldwide.

In 2010 the Department of Agriculture predicted farmers would receive an average of $1.35 per US gallon of cow's milk (35 cents per liter), which is down 30 cents per gallon from 2007 and below the break-even point for many cattle farmers.|$|E

40|$|<b>Bio-fuels,</b> wait {{a minute}} In February of this year a sudden rise {{in the price of}} tortillas and tacos enlisted heavy protest from Mexicans. In just two months prices soared by 200 %. The reason why the {{worldwide}} price of maize is so high is because there is growing interest in maize as the raw material for ethanol, a substitute for petrol. What environmental organisations had predicted would happen, has happened: supermarkets and petrol suppliers have become competitors [16]. The production of first generation <b>bio-fuels</b> is putting pressure on the production of food crops. The demand for sustainable transport fuels has increased strongly, especially in Europe and the United States. The large producers of first generation <b>bio-fuels</b> are developing countries.

40|$|<b>Bio-fuels</b> {{are in a}} {{class of}} their own. Our {{research}} has shown that <b>bio-fuels</b> are not in competition with alternative fuel sources such as, fusion, tidal and hydrogen power, but they can pave the way for them. <b>Bio-fuels</b> could potentially buy us and our environment upwards of one hundred years. They are also the only fuel source which can be implemented today and dramatically reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. It is apparent that we may run out of fossil fuels within the next 50 years, and could face a major ecological disaster before then due to climate change. <b>Bio-fuels</b> can step in and alleviate the burden of CO 2 output and give us sufficient time to develop such future technologies, as fusion.

40|$|Abstract — The {{depletion}} of world petroleum reserves results in two crisis that are rising prices {{of fuel and}} global warming problems. The energy security can be maintained by improving the efficiency of energy producing components. Efforts are being made to find the alternatives. <b>Bio-fuels</b> are those whose energy is derived from carbon fixation. Biodiesel is made from vegetable oil, animal fats, and non edible seeds. These resources are available and also can be grown in plenty. <b>Bio-fuels</b> can be used blended with diesel {{and can be used}} to run engines which reduces the dependence on the non renewable resources. There are different types of <b>bio-fuels</b> like Karanja, Jatropha, Mahua etc. These fuels can be blended with ordinary diesel and can be used. Karanja, Jatropha are already being used in engines along with diesel. <b>Bio-fuels</b> can be blended alone with a diesel or two <b>bio-fuels</b> blended separately can be mixed with ordinary diesel. <b>Bio-fuels</b> are still a new entry and a lot of research is being carried to find more effective <b>bio-fuels</b> so that it adds to the overall performance wherever it is used. Our project concentrates mainly on preparing biodiesel from fish oil and then comparing the properties of these with ordinary diesel and also experiments were conducted on Injection pressures of 200 and 225 bars and compression ratio’s 17. 5 : 1 and 14 : 1 as constant to study the performance and emission characteristics of a TV 1, Kirloskar make, direct injection, Four Stroke single cylinder diesel engine using blends of Fish oil methyl esters with diesel.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study {{described}} in this report is to summarize the various barriers to more widespread distribution of <b>bio-fuels</b> through our common carrier fuel distribution system, which includes pipelines, barges and rail, fuel tankage, and distribution terminals. Addressing these barriers is necessary to allow the more widespread utilization and distribution of <b>bio-fuels,</b> in support of a renewable fuels standard and possible future low-carbon fuel standards. These barriers can be classified into several categories, including operating practice, regulatory, technical, and acceptability barriers. Possible solutions to these issues are discussed; including compatibility evaluation, changes to <b>bio-fuels,</b> regulatory changes, and changes in the distribution system or distribution practices. No actual experimental research has been conducted in the writing of this report, but results are used to develop recommendations for future research and additional study as appropriate.
