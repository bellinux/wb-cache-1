40|$|The {{stability}} {{behavior of}} a jet diffusion flame developing in a co-flowing stream is studied experimentally, using natural gas and propane as fuel gases. Effects of oxidant and fuel stream velocities and oxidant stream dilution have been studied. The results of experiments showed that with increasing fuel jet Reynolds number, there appears along the flame a point that is accompanied by reaction zone sudden expansion. Flame becomes turbulent downstream from this point. This point is called transition point. More increment of fuel jet Reynolds number moves the transition point to the upstream. Furthermore, two types of stability limits are observed. <b>Blow-off</b> <b>of</b> the rim-stabilized <b>flame</b> is the first stability limit. The second one is the break-off or extinction of the turbulent portion <b>of</b> the <b>flame</b> at the transition point from laminar to turbulent flow.

40|$|High-fidelity multi-scale {{simulation}} {{tools are}} critically important for examining energy conversion processes {{in which the}} coupling of complex chemical kinetics, molecular transport, continuum mixing and acoustics play important roles. The objectives of this thesis are: (i) to develop a state-of-the-art numerical approach to capture the wide spectra of spatio-temporal scales associated with reacting flows around immersed boundaries, and (ii) to use this tool to investigate the underlying mechanisms <b>of</b> <b>flame</b> stabilization and <b>blow-off</b> in canonical configurations. A second-order immersed boundary method for reacting flow simulations near heat conducting, grid conforming, solid object has been developed. The method is coupled with a block-structured adaptive mesh refinement (SAMR) framework and a semi-implicit operator-split projection algorithm. The immersed boundary approach captures the flame-wall interactions. The SAMR framework and the operator-split algorithm resolve several decades of length and time efficiently. A novel "buffer zone" methodology is introduced to impose the solid-fluid boundary conditions such that symmetric derivatives and interpolation stencils can be used throughout {{the interior of the}} domain, thereby maintaining the order of accuracy of the method. Near an immersed solid boundary, single-sided buffer zones are used to resolve the species discontinuities, and dual buffer zones are used to capture the temperature gradient discontinuities. This eliminates the need to utilize artificial flame anchoring boundary conditions used in existing state-of-the-art numerical methods. As such, using this approach, it is possible {{for the first time to}} analyze the complex and subtle processes near walls that govern flame stabilization. The approach can resolve the flow around multiple immersed solids using coordinate conforming representation, making it valuable for future research investigating a variety of multi-physics reacting flows while incorporating flame-wall interactions, such as catalytic and plasma interactions. Using the numerical method, limits on flame stabilization in two canonical configurations: bluff-body and perforated-plate, were investigated and the underlying physical mechanisms were elucidated. A significant departure from the conventional two-zone premixed flame-structure was observed in the anchoring region for both configurations. In the bluff-body wake, the location where the flame is initiated, preferential diffusion and conjugate heat exchange furnish conditions for ignition and enable streamwise flame continuation. In the perforated-plate, on the other hand, a combination of conjugate heat exchange and flame curvature is responsible for local anchoring. For both configurations, it was found that a flame was stable when (1) the local flame displacement speed was equal to the flow speed (static stability), and (2) the gradient <b>of</b> the <b>flame</b> displacement speed normal to its surface was higher than the gradient of the flow speed along the same direction (dynamic stability). As the blow-off conditions were approached, the difference between the former and the latter decreased until the dynamic stability condition (2) was violated. The blowoff <b>of</b> <b>flames</b> stabilized in a bluff-body wake start downstream, near the end of the combustion-products dominated recirculation zone, by flame pinching into an upstream and a downstream propagating sections. The <b>blow-off</b> <b>of</b> <b>flames</b> stabilized in flow perforated-plate wake start in the anchoring region, near the end of the preheated reactants-filled recirculation zone, with the entire flame front convecting downstream. These simulations elucidated the thus far unknown physics <b>of</b> the underlying <b>flame</b> stabilization and blow-off mechanisms, understanding which is crucial for designing flame-holders for combustors that support continuous burning. Such an investigation is not possible without the advanced numerical tool developed in this work. Based on the insight gained from the simulations, analytical models were developed to describe the dynamic response <b>of</b> <b>flames</b> to flow perturbations in an acoustically coupled environment. These models are instrumental in optimizing combustor designs and applying active control to guarantee dynamic stability if necessary. by Kushal Sharad Kedia. Thesis: Ph.

40|$|There {{have been}} {{significant}} successes in the mathematical modelling of lift-off distances and plume heights <b>of</b> fuel jet <b>flames,</b> and in correlating these parameters experimentally. A dimensionless flow number, or jet velocity, has been developed, with which experimental dimensionless plume heights and flame lift-off distances {{have been successfully}} correlated. However, the prediction <b>of</b> <b>blow-off</b> heights presents significantly more difficulty. This {{is because of the}} strong non-linearities at <b>blow-off,</b> involving complexities <b>of</b> mixing, strain rates, flamelet burning velocities and curvatures, with localised <b>flame</b> extinctions. Because <b>of</b> these, it is difficult to obtain consistency in the measurement <b>of</b> <b>blow-off</b> heights. Consequently, the practice adopted by Kalghatgi of measuring dimensionless fuel jet velocities at blow-off was followed in the present study. Just before blow-off, strong instabilities and flame oscillations develop, and a correlation <b>of</b> <b>blow-off</b> is proposed in terms of the the last stable dimensionless flow number, before blow-off occurs. The study covers acetylene, commercial butanes, ethylene, hydrogen, methane and propane. Blow-off is characterised from plots <b>of</b> the dimensionless <b>flame</b> lift-off distance against the flow number for each fuel, with identification of the last stable dimensionless flow number prior to blow-off.
