The selection of <b>battery</b> <b>packaging</b> must have all the criteria needed by <b>battery</b> <b>packaging,</b> therefore the analysis are made for selection material and heat transfer from <b>battery</b> <b>packaging</b> to outside of the car. The cooling system is effect most on the performance, weight, cost, and maintenances. For example, the liquid cooling system most effective than air cooling system, but liquid cooling have more deficiency in leakage problem, need more mass to complete the circulate of the cooling system and also higher cost of maintenances. The air cooling system less effective, but the cost is low than liquid, easy maintenance and also less mass.

40|$|For {{years the}} {{interest}} of the UDR 1 researcher group has been focused on the development of a Hybrid Series (HS) vehicle, different from the standard one, using a Gas Turbine (GT) set as a thermal engine. The reason of this choice resides in the opportunity to reduce weight and dimension, in comparison to a traditional In- ternal Combustion Engine (ICE). It’s not possible to use the GT engine directly for the vehicle traction, so the UDR 1 HS configuration shows the GT set connected with the electric generator only. The result is that the traction is pure electric. Many efforts are spent in the definition of a generic scientific method to define the correct ratio HD (the Hybridization Degree) between the installed power of the battery pack and that of the GT electric generator which simultaneously guarantee the main life for the <b>battery</b> <b>package</b> and the ca- pacity of the vehicle to complete a common mission (about 15 km - 30 km) without lack of energy or stop.

40|$|A longstanding {{interest}} of the Authors' research group at UDR 1 was the design, development and fielding of a road prototype of a new concept of Hybrid Series vehicle, endowed with a small Gas Turbine set as a thermal engine. This solution offers several advantages with respect to traditional internal combustion engines and even to the existing generation of Hybrid propulsive systems,: a reduced engine weight and size, lower emissions, substantially extended range, ease of maintenance, and more efficient braking energy recovery. In the LETHE (Low Emissions Turbo-Hybrid Engine) the GT does not directly provide traction, but serves solely as a battery pack recharger. The vehicle is, in all respects, equivalent to a purely electric vehicle, except {{for the presence of}} an on-board recharger. Much care was placed in the design phase in the quest for an "optimal" design: first of all, an original method for identifying the most convenient degree of hybridization (ratio of the installed power of the battery pack and that of the GT) was defined and formalized, so that the resulting power balance between the two units satisfies the main design specifications, namely that of guaranteeing a practically acceptable operational life of the <b>battery</b> <b>package</b> while enabling the vehicle to complete a typical city mission (about 25 - 50 km) in a purely electric mode and without recharge.

40|$|The {{dependent}} {{pressure vessel}} (DPV) nickel-hydrogen (NiH 2) battery {{is being developed}} as a potential spacecraft battery design for both military and commercial satellites. Individual pressure vessel (IPV) NiH 2 batteries are currently flying on more than 70 Earth orbital satellites and have accumulated more than 140, 000, 000 cell-hours in actual spacecraft operation. The limitations of standard NiH 2 IPV flight battery technology are primarily related to the internal cell design and the <b>battery</b> <b>packaging</b> issues associated with grouping multiple cylindrical cells. The DPV cell design offers higher specific energy and reduced cost, while retaining the established IPV NiH 2 technology flight heritage and database. The advanced cell design offers a more efficient mechanical, electrical and thermal cell configuration and a reduced parts count. The internal electrode stack is a prismatic flat-plate arrangement. The flat individual cell pressure vessel provides a maximum direct thermal path for removing heat from the electrode stack. The cell geometry also minimizes multiple-cell <b>battery</b> <b>packaging</b> constraints by using an established end-plateltie-rod battery design. A major design advantage is that the battery support structure is efficiently required to restrain only the force applied to {{a portion of the}} end cell. As the cells are stacked in series to achieve the desired system voltage, this increment of the total battery weight becomes small. The geometry of the DPV cell promotes compact, minimum volume packaging and places all cell terminals {{along the length of the}} battery. The resulting ability to minimize intercell wiring offers additional design simplicity and significant weight savings. The DPV battery design offers significant cost and weight savings advantages while providing minimal design risks.

The DPV is capable of delivering up to 76 Watt-hours per kilogram (Wh/kg) at the cell level and 70 Wh/kg at the full battery level.
