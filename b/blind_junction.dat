50|$|A making-of-the-rendezvous {{documentary}} {{indicates that}} Lelouch himself was the driver, {{and that the}} car driven was the Mercedes, although the sound track is from a Ferrari. On the chosen course there were two people who knew to expect Lelouch. First there was Élie Chouraqui, his first assistant, who was posted with a walkie-talkie in the Rue de Rivoli, behind the archway exiting from the gardens of the Louvre palace, meaning to assist the driver at the only <b>blind</b> <b>junction</b> (archway); however, Lelouch has revealed that the radios failed, and if Chouraqui had tried to warn him of a pedestrian the message {{would not have been}} received. Anyway, the traffic light at that junction showed green. The other person who knew about his arrival was Lelouch's girlfriend Gunilla Friden. He'd told her he'd arrive within ten minutes at the Sacré-Cœur and asked her to appear upon his arrival.|$|E

This signal box controls entry and exit to the southern end of the Great Central Railway's unique double track. In 2009 it was joined by an ex-GCR lamp hut taken from Whetstone railway station.|$|R

Alternatively, the capsule can be placed under direct vision during endoscopy. Currently there are no published data comparing the efficiency of one method over the other. The objective {{of this study was to}} compare the method of Bravo wireless pH deviceplacement under direct visualization with the conventional method. Methods: A retrospective study involving 58 patients (29 patients with indirect and 29 patients with direct visualization) who had Bravo capsule placement. The physician endoscopy procedure notes, nurse&rsquo;s notes, postprocedure notes, recovery notes, and pH monitoring results were reviewed. The safety of the procedures, length of the procedures, and patient tolerability were evaluated. Results: None of the 58 patients had early detachment of the device and had no immediate procedure-related complications. The overall incidence of complications in both the groups was similar. No failures due to the technique were noted in either group. Average amount of time taken for the procedure was similar in both groups. Conclusion: The technique of placing a Bravo pH device under direct visualization is as safe and effective as the conventional method. In addition, there is an added advantage of avoiding a second endoscopic intubation in the direct visualization technique. Keywords: Bravo capsule, technique, esophageal pH monitorin...|$|R
