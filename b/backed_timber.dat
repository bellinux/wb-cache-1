500|$|On {{the back}} cover, Harrison is pictured {{sitting on a}} garden bench, the <b>back</b> <b>timbers</b> of which are {{apparently}} carved with his name {{and that of the}} album. Similar to Harrison's attire in the outdoor scenes of the [...] "Ding Dong, Ding Dong" [...] video clip, Leng refers to his appearance here as resembling the Jethro Tull character [...] "Aqualung". Terry Doran's photo, given the same orange hue as the one inside the gatefold, was also used on some European picture sleeves for the [...] "Ding Dong" [...] and [...] "Dark Horse" [...] singles around this time.|$|R

50|$|The shopfronts are {{decorated}} with banded ceramic tiling below the display windows, with a fine continuous band decorating the door and window heads. The eastern-most display window retains its original <b>timber</b> <b>backing</b> shutters. The awning has a pressed metal soffit with geometric motifs.|$|R
60|$|The sudden attack {{brought the}} {{remaining}} Indians to a halt, {{and for a}} second they appeared not {{to know what to do}} next. Then the wounded man staggered <b>back</b> toward the <b>timber,</b> and with another war-whoop the others continued toward the cabin.|$|R
50|$|ANZ {{has been}} the subject of claims that it has <b>backed</b> {{agriculture}} and <b>timber</b> companies that engage in so called 'land grabs'. In 2014 ANZ faced allegations that it funded a Cambodian sugar plantation that has involved child labour, military-backed land grabs, forced evictions and food shortages.|$|R
60|$|Now the Italians are organising this prize, and I saw {{winding up}} far above {{me on the}} steep grey slope a multitudinous string of little things that looked like black ants, each {{carrying}} a small bright yellow egg. They were mules bringing <b>back</b> balks of <b>timber....</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{village was}} founded by Daniel Gaussen in 1788. He built a forge {{on the shore of}} Lough Neagh for {{manufacturing}} spades and soon afterwards erected stores. This led to the building of quays and the formation of a port, which greatly benefited the surrounding countryside. A large distillery was erected in 1824, and a brewery in 1830, by Messrs. Gaussen and Sons. Vessels of about 50 tons burden plied regularly between the village and Belfast, exporting wheat, fruit, spirits, ale, and freestone, and bringing <b>back</b> barley, <b>timber,</b> slate, iron, wine and groceries.|$|R
60|$|Presently {{he found}} himself looking toward the burn. <b>Back,</b> in the <b>timber</b> {{bordering}} the river, was a tall tree which reared its head a score of feet above its fellow trees. As he turned his glass in that direction, something unusual {{in the top of}} the tree attracted his attention.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} Jeanie Johnston {{was bought}} by Tralee, Co. Kerry-based merchants John Donovan & Sons, as a cargo vessel and traded successfully between Tralee and North America {{for a number of}} years. The trading pattern was to bring emigrants from Ireland to North America, and then to bring <b>timber</b> <b>back</b> to Europe.|$|R
50|$|The Timbers Army is {{composed}} of several different subgroups. These subgroups are unique in their own fashion and consist of many different personalities. However, all subgroups fall under the Timbers Army umbrella. Many of the subgroups produce their own special apparel and other items while the proceeds go directly <b>back</b> to <b>Timbers</b> Army causes. Unlike many teams in Major League Soccer, the Timbers Army is the only recognized independent supporters group of the Portland Timbers, while many other clubs have several supporters groups. The subgroups of the Timbers Army rival the size of many other supporters groups in MLS.|$|R
60|$|On the whole, however, {{there seems}} every ground to {{conclude}} that again and again the Norsemen landed on the Atlantic coast of America. We {{do not know where}} they made their winter quarters, nor does this matter. Very likely there were temporary settlements in both 'Markland,' with its thick woods bordering on the sea, and in other less promising regions. It should be added that some writers of authority refuse even to admit that the Norsemen reached America. Others, like Nansen, the famous Arctic explorer, while admitting the probability of the voyages, believe that the sagas are merely a sort of folklore, such as may be found in the primitive literature of all nations. On the other hand, John Fiske, the American historian, who devoted much patient study to the question, was convinced that what is now the Canadian coast, with, probably, part of New England too, was discovered, visited, and thoroughly well known by the Norse inhabitants of Greenland. For several centuries they appear to have made summer voyages to and from this 'Vineland the Good' as they called it, and to have brought <b>back</b> <b>timber</b> and supplies not found in their own inhospitable country. It is quite possible that further investigation may throw new light on the Norse discoveries, and even that undeniable traces of the buildings or implements of the settlers in Vineland may be found. Meanwhile the subject, interesting though it is, remains shrouded in mystery.|$|R
5000|$|... == History == [...] The {{place where}} today the Fray Jorge National Park is located was {{discovered}} in 1627 by a priest of the Franciscan order, who, {{due to a lack}} of timber in the area, set out to search for it with the help of some mules. After [...] "miraculously" [...] finding it at this location, he brought <b>back</b> some <b>timber</b> and used it to build part of the bell tower of the Church of San Francisco in La Serena.The Bosque de Fray Jorge national park was created in 1941 and is administered by the Chilean forest authority CONAF. UNESCO incorporated the national park as a biosphere reservation in 1977.|$|R
5000|$|One day I {{found an}} old gate under a hedge and I started {{cleaning}} <b>back</b> the <b>timber</b> underneath the weathering. As I peeled back those layers I saw {{something in the}} timber that I can only describe as its spiritual essence. So it was in every way a transforming experience for me. I’d made that connection with the wairua spirit of the timber {{and from then on}} I knew that I’d found a material that I connected with at a deep level. And that’s really the beginning. I started a process of learning the characteristics of the timber, of reading and teaching myself methods that I could use to work it.|$|R
60|$|The way lay along a flat {{stretch of}} prairie {{bordering}} the river, {{and then up}} into the hills. The brushwood in the immediate neighborhood was scanty, but in the distance they could see some scrub <b>timber</b> <b>backed</b> up by a stretch of forest. Far to the westward {{they could see the}} distant mountains over which the sun was now setting.|$|R
6000|$|At {{the time}} of which I write, Dawson City was little better than a rude mining camp, containing, as has been {{previously}} mentioned, a half dozen board buildings and fifty tents, strung along what {{was known as the}} principal [...] "street." [...] <b>Back</b> in the <b>timber</b> land a rude saw-mill had been set up, and this was beginning to get out lumber at the moderate price of one hundred and twenty-five dollars per thousand feet! ...|$|R
50|$|He {{returned}} to Manchester City after his loan spell at Galatasaray expired. Jô scored {{in his first}} game <b>back</b> against Portland <b>Timbers</b> and was also successful in further pre-season friendlies against New York Red Bulls, Borussia Dortmund and Valencia CF respectively. He then went on to score in the Europa League win against Salzburg and in the League Cup loss to West Bromwich Albion, his fourth and fifth goals for the club.|$|R
50|$|Long won the 1928 gubernatorial {{election}} {{in large part}} by tapping into the class resentment of rural residents. He proposed government services far more expansive than anything in his state's history. His campaign manager was the Catholic Cajun Harvey Peltier, Sr., a state representative and lawyer/banker from Thibodaux in Lafourche Parish. Long had the <b>backing</b> of the <b>timber</b> businessman Swords Lee, his cousin by marriage and a former state representative for Grant Parish.|$|R
50|$|Michael Stiff and Andrew Trevillion were {{graduates}} {{when they}} founded Stiff + Trevillion {{in the spring}} of 1981. In 1991 Stiff and Trevillion designed the first Wagamama restaurant in Bloomsbury which opened in 1992. After Wagamama was finished the practice was asked to create a restaurant with a similar concept of Japanese dining called Satsuma. The dark-stained <b>timber</b> <b>back</b> wall and the black and white terrazzo floor reflected Japanese and Scandinavian influences.|$|R
50|$|The {{first floor}} is reached via an {{internal}} and original timber staircase at {{the northwest corner}} of the building, which now is accessed only from the front street. The upper floor has been gutted and refurbished as office space not associated with the bank on the ground floor, hence the alterations to create a separate entrance. There is a set of external <b>timber</b> <b>back</b> stairs leading from the first floor to the back yard, at the original northeast corner of the building.|$|R
5000|$|The Reverend Thomas Kendall was {{the first}} European settler to the area, issued a land grant in 1827. He named the estate [...] "Kendall Dale" [...] and {{commenced}} pastoral activities as well as cutting red cedar found in abundance near Narrawallee Creek. Poet Henry Kendall, the grandson of Thomas Kendall was born at the property near Milton in 1839. Further land grants in the 1830s led to a town site being surveyed in 1837 at Boat Harbour (present day Ulladulla). The district prospered through the 1840s on the <b>back</b> of the <b>timber</b> industry.|$|R
30|$|Wood ash, {{in other}} words the {{combustion}} residue of wood fuels, is mainly composed of inorganic components with unburned carbon. The first motivation of our study is to examine whether the wood ash could be put <b>back</b> into <b>timbers</b> again within the space of wood cells {{for the purpose of}} making the wood-inorganic mineral composites. In the previous studies, several wood-inorganic compound complexes have been developed with chemical agents to enhance the fire and decay resistances of the wood [5 – 8]. We, therefore, intend to produce a new composite material by combining the wood ash within woods. However, the ash does not fit in so easily with woods because it has high alkaline and hence causes striking discoloration of the combined woods. So in this study, the wood ash was preliminarily converted into hydroxyapatite (HAp; Ca 10 (PO 4) 6 (OH) 2) solution by a reaction with phosphoric acid, and then it was penetrated and fixed into woods to make the HAp-wood composites.|$|R
60|$|Turning, {{he crawled}} from the spot with care, and once <b>back</b> into the <b>timber,</b> {{commenced}} to run, {{with his gun}} {{slung over his shoulder}} and his hands held out before him, to keep from running afoul of any obstruction. More than once he bumped into a tree or fell sprawling over some exposed roots, knocking the wind out of him. But he always picked himself up and went on again with undiminished speed. Indeed, the nearer he got to home the greater was his fear that something might have happened in his absence and finally he fairly flew, when he reached familiar ground.|$|R
50|$|In 1919, <b>backed</b> by British <b>timber</b> {{merchant}} Montague Meyer, MacMillan {{established the}} H.R. MacMillan Export Company, Ltd, the first privately owned lumber export brokerage {{firm in the}} province. In 1933 he was elected Chairman of the Vancouver Board of Trade. During World War II, he was Timber Controller, Chairman of the Wartime Requirements Board, and President of Wartime Merchant Shipping Ltd. For these efforts, he was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire. In 1951 his company merged with Bloedel, Stewart and Welch Ltd. to form MacMillan Bloedel Limited (now part of Weyerhaeuser).|$|R
50|$|The {{fittings}} {{are rather}} a mixture. The four trebles and the flat 6th have Taylor fittings contemporary {{with them and}} consisting of cast iron headstocks, ball bearings, traditional wheels, stays and sliders.. The <b>back</b> eight have <b>timber</b> stocks, presumably dating from either 1885 or 1904, traditional wheels by Llewellins & James and dating from 1904, and traditional stays and sliders. The bells were rehung on ball bearings by Taylor's in 1932, and the gudgeons and bearings were replaced by Whitechapel in 1991. There is also an Ellacombe chiming apparatus, which was installed by Llewellins & James in 1904.|$|R
50|$|The {{dwelling}} is symmetrically {{composed with}} a central stair and entrance with broad verandahs on either side. It has a low-pitched hipped corrugated iron roof, divided into three portions that emphasises the symmetry of the front elevation. The house is elevated on tall concrete posts. Simple wide stairs lead to a carefully detailed entrance bay with a low, lined ceiling and double timber doors that feature an elongated oval cutout infilled with a fine timber lattice panel. The entrance bay is enclosed at the <b>back</b> with vertical <b>timber</b> louvres that are fixed to the balustrade. A detail of exposed roof timbers is repeated around the eaves of the building.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Portney and {{the boys}} had long since decided where the cabin should be built, up {{against the side of}} a cliff, ten feet in height, which {{overlooked}} the head of the gulch. All the miners in the locality had agreed that this would be the best spot, and six cabins were to be placed there, for hospitality's sake if for no other reason. Mr. Portney had already ordered the dressed lumber needed from the saw-mill; but as this was costly stuff, and expensive to transport, Earl and Randy had declared their intention to go into the <b>timber</b> <b>back</b> of the cliff and get out whatever of rough wood could be made to do.|$|R
50|$|However, in December 2011 it was {{announced}} that this section of the line would be re-opened to facilitate the transport of timber from Heathfield to North Wales. In the same month a timber siding was opened at Teigngrace, just before the level crossing at Exeter Road, to allow the timber to be loaded onto the freight trains. Due to the lack of a passing loop at Teigngrace, the train and its empty wagons continues up the line to Heathfield where the engine can run around the carriages using the loop in the disused station. The empty freight train then drives <b>back</b> to the <b>timber</b> sidings at Teigngrace to be loaded. Loading of the timber is carried out by the lorries that bring the timber to the sidings.|$|R
50|$|The {{construction}} {{method of}} dikes {{has changed over}} the centuries. Popular in the Middle Ages were wierdijken, earth dikes with a protective layer of seaweed. An earth embankment was cut vertically on the sea-facing side. Seaweed was then stacked against this edge, held into place with poles. Compression and rotting processes resulted in a solid residue that proved very effective against wave action and they needed very little maintenance. In places where seaweed was unavailable other materials such as reeds or wicker mats were used. Another system used much {{and for a long time}} was that of a vertical screen of <b>timbers</b> <b>backed</b> by an earth bank. Technically these vertical constructions were less successful as vibration from crashing waves and washing out of the dike foundations weakened the dike.|$|R
5000|$|In 2009 {{the line}} was mothballed until December 2011 when it was {{announced}} that the section of the line to Heathfield would re-opened to facilitate the transport of timber from Heathfield to Chirk in North Wales by Colas Rail. [...] In the same month a timber siding was opened at Teigngrace, just before the level crossing at Exeter Road, to allow the timber to be loaded onto the freight trains.

5000|$|The honour {{board is}} copper {{attached}} to a <b>timber</b> <b>backing</b> board with the roll of honour facing the street (east). A second plaque below this honours those who made the supreme sacrifice. On the western side facing the railway line, back to back with the honour board is a shield - [...] "Linville's tribute {{to the memory of}} the brave". Also on the western face is another plaque describing the machine gun which is set in concrete at base of the memorial: [...] "German machine gun captured on the Western Front by the 9th Battalion AIF 11-4-1918". The timber supports for the honour board backing board are also in poor repair and in need of remedial work. The machine gun is set in a concrete block painted to resemble sandstone.|$|R
