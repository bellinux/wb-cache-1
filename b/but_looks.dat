That building, the Northwest Gallery, was formerly used for storage and as a shop, <b>but</b> <b>looks</b> similar to the Rice House. This gallery focuses on items from Oregon, Idaho, and Washington, and includes collections of agates, thundereggs, zeolites, and placer gold, among others.|$|E

25|$|At Springfield Elementary, Skinner is despondent at {{the thought}} that Edna could leave the school. Groundskeeper Willie lends Skinner his sports car so he can go to Orlando, where he surprises Edna with a kiss under the {{fireworks}} display. They are interrupted by Agnes, whom Skinner brought along, much to Edna's ire. During preparation for the awards ceremony, Skinner is shocked when he hears that the winner receives enough money to be able to retire. He requests Bart to help him sabotage Edna's chances of winning, though he has to resort to blackmail after Bart initially refuses. At the ceremony, each finalist must ask their nominating student a question. When Bart is asked what Edna would like to teach the world, he pretends to be illiterate, until Skinner tells the truth. Skinner asks Edna to marry him, and she agrees. Edna loses the award, <b>but</b> <b>looks</b> forward to marrying Skinner.|$|E
25|$|Based {{on their}} few run-ins, Saša is {{sufficiently}} intrigued with Koka that he tracks {{her down and}} ends up sleeping with her in her apartment. Afterwards, he informs her that he doesn't want to pursue things further, which she takes in stride to his face, passing it all off as a light fling, <b>but</b> <b>looks</b> visibly shaken after he leaves. He decides to stay with Branka and is soon informed by her that she's pregnant so the parents quickly set about organizing a wedding. Meanwhile, Giga decides to call on his Pomoravlje paisano connections {{in order to find}} Saša a job. He wants to track down his old friend Jataganac who's now a powerful politically connected party-installed business manager. Though he manages to get Jataganac's attention after much wrangling, the whole thing eventually goes pear-shaped when Giga refuses to swallow his pride when Jataganac shows up four hours late to the dinner at Popadić's house.|$|E

25|$|Fermentation {{of sugar}} into alcohol during {{winemaking}} always means that {{carbon dioxide is}} released. Carbon dioxide has the property of being very soluble in water (the main constituent of wine), a property that is utilized in sparkling wines. Production always starts from a base wine (where the carbon dioxide from the first fermentation has been gasified). In i.a. Champagne production the base wine is usually a blend of wines from different grape varieties and different wineries, where the distribution gives the final wine its special character, called cuvée. In some commonly used methods the base wine undergoes a secondary fermentation, which encloses the resulting carbon dioxide under excess pressure and binds it to the liquid in the sparkling wine. In this way the carbon dioxide content is created which, after opening the bottle, produces the bubbles. The dead yeast cells form a precipitate called lees, that often helps with appealing aromas to the sparkling wine <b>but</b> <b>looks</b> unappetizing. The lees is therefore normally removed before the wine is distributed.|$|E
25|$|Graham {{is seated}} {{to the right}} of the picture, on the left of the table that divides the picture. He is seen in full length, facing {{forwards}} though looking to the side, while smoking a long pipe. Standing to Graham's right, his lower half obscured by the table cloth, a man holds a sheet of music and is in the act of singing. The third member of the dining party is seated on the left of the painting, and like Graham is visible in full length. Ronald Paulson identifies them as the ship's clerk and chaplain. The music the men are listening or singing along to is provided by a black manservant, standing on the right of the painting and playing a pipe and tabor. A steward stands opposite him on the left of the painting, framing the composition. The steward holds a plate of roast duck, <b>but</b> <b>looks</b> out of the painting towards the viewer with a smile, while gravy drips from the plate down the back of the chaplain's coat. The remaining members of the portrait are two dogs. One is Graham's own, sitting at the chaplain's feet and apparently joining in the singing. The other, sat on his haunches on a chair on the right of the painting, is Hogarth's own pug, Trump. Trump, his tongue lolling out and wearing Graham's wig, holds a scroll and appears to read from his own sheet of music, balanced against a wine glass in front of him.|$|E

500|$|Zinta's next {{release of}} 2006 was Shirish Kunder's romantic musical Jaan-E-Mann, a story {{set in the}} United States about two men, played by Salman Khan and Akshay Kumar, who love the same woman. The film opened to mixed reviews from critics and its {{eventual}} box office profit was poor. Zinta {{played the role of}} Piya, the cynosure of two men. She was mostly criticised for taking a role of minimal importance, though her performance was generally well received. Raja Sen labelled her role an [...] "ornament throughout," [...] but further stated that she [...] "comes vividly alive in the film's last scene, a moment that makes you lament why filmmakers today don't let the babyfaced actress have more fun instead of forcing her to sob copiously. She doesn't have much to do in Jaan-E-Mann, <b>but</b> <b>looks</b> appropriately attractive." [...] Zinta said that the film was a great relief after the more emotionally intense Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna, as Jaan-E-Mann was [...] "easy, happy and much more simple".|$|E
500|$|Reviews of {{the premiere}} were {{generally}} positive. According to Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the premiere {{has received a}} [...] "generally favorable" [...] score of 61, based on 9 reviews. In all three cases the film ranks lowest in the series. [...] Joseph Dilworth Jr. of Pop Culture Zoo praised the premiere of Stargate Universe, stating that it [...] "feels less like a weekly TV series and much more like {{the beginning of a}} twenty part long form story," [...] and is also described as a cross between , Battlestar Galactica and Firefly, though the series seems to be a spiritual successor to Battlestar. Dilworth also praised the cast, stating it as [...] "one of the finest ensemble casts I've seen in a long time." [...] Curt Wagner of Chicago Now rated the episode 4 stars out of four, stating that it shares the optimism of Star Trek: Voyager, and the grimness of Battlestar Galactica, as well as playing homage to its franchise forebears SG-1 and Atlantis, <b>but</b> <b>looks</b> and feels new. IGN reviewer Ramsey Isler gave the episode 8.8 out of 10, starting his review with [...] "Yes, it's another Stargate show. But this might become the best of them all." [...] Further saying the premiere had its [...] "own unique tone." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{a parody}} of Dead Calm, Homer and Marge set sail on a romantic second honeymoon. Their time {{together}} is interrupted when they rescue a castaway. Introducing himself as Roger, the castaway explains {{that he was a}} chef on a yacht called the Albatross, and was knocked out after attempting to stop a poisoning on his ship. Roger makes them a pie, but Homer becomes convinced that Roger poisoned the guests on the Albatross. He grabs the pie from Marge and throws it out the window. Marge chastises Homer, <b>but</b> <b>looks</b> out a window and sees a dead shark with the pie pan in its mouth. Homer and Marge take {{matters into their own hands}} as they seemingly kill Roger using a metal pole, and knock his body overboard. However, finding the Albatross, they realize Roger was telling the truth and that some of the passengers are still alive, as one of the people administered an antidote. Roger appears and explains that the shark they saw had died from a fuel leakage from Homer and Marge's boat. Homer then kills Roger, the surviving Albatross crew, and a pelican, to cover their tracks. However, unable to bear the guilt, Marge eats the poisoned pie, much to Homer's horror. The story is then revealed to be Maggie's imagination while she is taking a bath. Homer asks Marge what Maggie thinks about while bathing, which she responds, [...] "Just sugar plums and buttercups." [...] Maggie then shadily moves her eyes (revealing eyeliner over one eye), puts on a hat, and drinks milk like Alex from A Clockwork Orange as the theme from the movie briefly plays in the background.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{the word}} Gurmukhī has been {{commonly}} translated as [...] "from the Mouth of the Guru," [...] the term {{used for the}} Punjabi script has somewhat different connotations.

Consequently, the script that was used for scribing the utterance was also given the same name.
