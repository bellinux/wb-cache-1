5|$|The Army {{was using}} an {{incremental}} approach to combat vehicle modernization, {{centered on the}} Ground Combat Vehicle. The deployment was to be synchronized with upgrades, reset, and divestiture of existing vehicles. Vehicles displaced by the IFV may then replace selected M113 family of vehicles such as command and control, medical evacuation, and mortar carrier, allowing the Army to begin divestiture of the M113 family of vehicles. Upgrades to existing <b>Bradley</b> <b>and</b> Stryker vehicles may have been considered as risk mitigation based on {{the rate at which}} the GCV was introduced. Although upgraded, the <b>Bradley</b> <b>and</b> Stryker would also be replaced in the midterm.|$|E

5|$|As {{the number}} of works {{featuring}} LGBT characters increased, so did the visibility of LGBT fans. At least {{as early as the}} 1980 Worldcon (Noreascon Two), there were gatherings of gay and gay-friendly members of the SF community, including Samuel R. Delany, Marion Zimmer <b>Bradley</b> <b>and</b> Melissa Scott. However, such meetings did not necessarily indicate whole-hearted acceptance within the fan community, and gay and lesbian fans were not regarded as a unified interest group. Informal gatherings at conferences and the attempted creation of a newsletter for LGBT fans drew little notice.|$|E

5|$|Author Michael <b>Bradley</b> <b>and</b> friend Deanna Theilmann-Beann {{searched for}} Mussie in the Nepenthe, a boat with sonar technology. With their sonar, they found two creatures they {{hypothesized}} could be two marine mammals, three metres long. Bradley concluded {{that at least}} one creature compatible with Mussie's description lived in the lake, though he did not investigate the creatures further. Scientists have also surveyed the area and found nothing, though the definitive nonexistence of a Mussie-like creature is difficult to establish because some of the trenches in Muskrat Lake extend to over 60 metres.|$|E

The {{ceremony}} took place on July 22, 1951, and the couple eventually had four children – Kenneth, Patrice, <b>Bradley,</b> <b>and</b> Ellyn. Ellyn, born June 27, 1975, was the first child born to a Kentucky First Family while they were residing in the Governor's Mansion.|$|E
5|$|Factionalism again {{marked the}} Republican nominating {{convention}} in 1904. <b>Bradley</b> <b>and</b> his faction backed Augustus E. Willson for governor, while Hunter and Yerkes favored Louisville businessman Morris B. Belknap, the son-in-law of former governor Simon Buckner. When convention officials ruled against a county delegation committed to Willson, he {{withdrew from the}} contest. Bradley was angered as Belknap was nominated on the first ballot and subsequently lost to J. C. W. Beckham, who was allowed to seek a second term because a court ruled {{he had not been}} elected to a full term in 1900.|$|E

5|$|Following {{his term}} as governor, Bradley moved to Louisville and resumed his legal practice. Shortly after Bradley left office, Goebel and his running mate, J. C. W. Beckham, {{challenged}} {{the results of}} the 1899 election in the General Assembly, per the state constitution. All the candidates for the state's minor offices contested as well. <b>Bradley</b> <b>and</b> his colleague Augustus Willson formed part of the legal team that represented the Republicans before the General Assembly and in court, where they challenged the legality of the Goebel Election Law and, later, the actions of the General Assembly's contest committee.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{disastrous}} Battle of the Kasserine Pass, Eisenhower sent Smith forward {{to report on}} the state of affairs at the American II Corps. Smith recommended the relief of its commander, Major General Lloyd Fredendall, as did General Harold Alexander and Major Generals Omar <b>Bradley</b> <b>and</b> Lucian Truscott. On their advice, Eisenhower replaced Fredendall with Major General George S. Patton, Jr. Eisenhower also relieved his Assistant Chief of Staff Intelligence (G-2), Brigadier Eric Mockler-Ferryman, pinpointing faulty intelligence at AFHQ as a contributing factor in the defeat at Kasserine. Mockler-Ferryman was replaced by Brigadier Kenneth Strong.|$|E
5|$|In the 1908 presidential election, Bradley {{supported}} Charles W. Fairbanks for the Republican nomination, while Willson favored William Howard Taft. Disharmony marred {{the state}} nominating convention, and despite being a newly minted senator, Bradley was not chosen as a {{delegate to the}} Republican National Convention. This infuriated <b>Bradley</b> <b>and</b> ended his alliance with Willson. In the 1911 Republican nominating convention, Bradley did not support Edward C. O'Rear, the party's eventual gubernatorial nominee. He did little to support O'Rear in the general election, and former governor James B. McCreary was elected.|$|E
