Freyr tells Skírnir that he saw a beautiful woman, so <b>beautiful</b> <b>that</b> he was filled with grief {{and that he would}} soon die if he could not have her. Freyr tells Skírnir that he must go gain her hand on his behalf—whether the woman's father agrees or not—and he will be rewarded. Skírnir replies that he accepts the mission but only in exchange for Freyr's sword, which can fight on its own. Freyr gives him the sword and Skírnir sets off. Skírnir asks for the woman's hand for Freyr and receives her promise. Nine nights later she is to meet with Freyr at a location called Barey. Skírnir delivers the news to Freyr and Freyr responds with the final stanza from the Poetic Edda poem Skírnismál, lamenting that he must wait.|$|E

Lasseter stated, [...] "There will be a gorgeous stairway that goes up into the hat, it's a really great symbol like you're entering the building through the magic of Mickey Mouse's hat." [...] Due to the renovation, the studio's employees were temporarily moved from Burbank into the closest available Disney-controlled studio space– the DisneyToon Studios building in the industrial park in Glendale and the old Imagineering warehouse in North Hollywood under the western approach to Bob Hope Airport (the Tujunga Building).

500|$|... "Ode to Psyche" [...] is a 67-line poem {{written in}} stanzas of varying length, which took its form from {{modification}} Keats {{made to the}} sonnet structure. The ode is written to a Grecian mythological character, displaying a great influence of Classical culture as the poet begins his discourse with [...] "O GODDESS!" [...] (line 1). Psyche, a creature so <b>beautiful</b> <b>that</b> she drew the attention of Cupid himself, draws {{the attention of the}} narrator, whose artistic imagination causes him to dream of her: [...] "Surely I dream'd to-day, or did I see / The wingèd Psyche with awaken'd eyes" [...] (lines 5–6). As he relates himself to the mythical character of Cupid, he confuses the god's emotions with his own and imagines that he too has fallen in love with the woman's beauty. The poet does, however, understand the temporal difference between the characters of ancient Greece and his own as he declares, [...] "even in these days [...] I see, and sing, by my own eyes inspired" [...] (lines 40–43). In line 50, the poet states [...] "Yes, I will be thy priest, and build a fane", which, Harold Bloom suggests, implies that the poet himself becomes a [...] "prophet of the soul" [...] as he regards the beauty of Psyche and attempts to place himself within Cupid's personage. according to T.S. Eliot, it is the most prominent ode among the six great odes.|$|E

[...] The review continued: [...] "Every number is so outstanding {{that it is difficult to}} decide which will be the most popular." [...] The review in New York World-Telegram found the show to be [...] "the ultimate modern blending of music and popular theatre to date, with the finest kind of balance between story and song, and hilarity and heartbreak." [...] Brooks Atkinson of The New York Times especially praised Pinza's performance: [...] "Mr. Pinza's bass voice is the most <b>beautiful</b> <b>that</b> has been heard on a Broadway stage for an eon or two. He sings... with infinite delicacy of feeling and loveliness of tone." [...] He declared that [...] "Some Enchanted Evening", sung by Pinza, [...] "ought to become reasonably immortal." [...] Richard Watts, Jr. of the New York Post focused on Mary Martin's performance, writing, [...] "nothing I have ever seen her do prepared me for the loveliness, humor, gift for joyous characterization, and sheer lovableness of her portrayal of Nellie Forbush... who is so shocked to find her early racial prejudices cropping up. Hers is a completely irresistible performance." ...|$|E

She became a popular {{photographer}} with several rock groups, including the Jimi Hendrix Experience, the Grateful Dead, the Doors and the Beatles, whom she first met at Shea Stadium in 1966. She commented, [...] "It was John who interested me at the start. He was my Beatle hero. But when I met him the fascination faded fast, and I found it was Paul I liked." [...] The pair first properly met in 1967 at a Georgie Fame concert at The Bag O'Nails club, during her UK assignment to photograph rock musicians in London. As Paul remembers, [...] "The night Linda and I met, I spotted her across a crowded club, and although I would normally have been nervous chatting her up, I realised I had to... Pushiness worked for me that night!" [...] Linda said this about their meeting: [...] "I was quite shameless really. I was with somebody else ... and I saw Paul {{at the other side}} of the room. He looked so <b>beautiful</b> <b>that</b> I made up my mind I would have to pick him up." [...] The pair married in 1969. About their relationship, Paul said, [...] "We had a lot of fun together... just the nature of how we are, our favourite thing really is to just hang, to have fun. And Linda's very big on just following the moment." [...] He added, [...] "We were crazy. We had a big argument the night before we got married, and it was nearly called off... miraculous that we made it. But we did." ...|$|E

500|$|The gallery has an {{extensive}} collection of about 60 portraits, including Van Dyck's War and Peace, a John de Critz portrait of James I, a Frans Pourbus the Younger aristocratic portrait of Claude Lorraine, Duc de Chevreuse, a Mary Beale portrait of Charles II {{and others of}} him by court artist Sir Peter Lely, and portraits of George Digby, Second Earl of Bristol and William, First Duke of Bedford. Visiting the gallery in 1748, the Marchioness Grey described the gallery {{in a letter to}} a friend: [...] "Indeed there is a gracefulness and life in the figures beyond what I ever saw, they are quite animated and a strength of colouring that strikes you from one end of that gallery to the other. It is so <b>beautiful</b> <b>that</b> a picture which hangs by it is hurt by its situation." [...] Horace Walpole once wrote: [...] "Althorp has several very fine pictures by the best Italian hands, and a gallery of all one's acquaintances by Vandyke and Lely. In the gallery I found myself quite at home; and surprised the housekeeper by my familiarity with the portraits." [...] The portraits in the Picture Gallery are set in extravagant baroque gilded frames, designed by Robert Spencer, the Second Earl, which feature as [...] "cartouche at the top and a stylised mask at the bottom, with a moulded inner edge, which softens the line between frame and painting". Albert Spencer was so protective of War and Peace, once the most valuable item in Althorp, that he had the nearest tall window in the gallery converted into a door with hinges, so in case of a fire it could safely be lifted outside. There is also a small hidden door between War and Peace and [...] "The Windsor Beauties" [...] cut into the oak which leads to a staircase and the Pink Suite, a guest bedroom. Margaret Douglas-Home, sister of Albert Spencer, lived at Althorp from 1910, and the gallery was a favourite of hers. During the renovation of the 1980s, the old-fashioned celestial and terrestrial globes dating to the George II period were moved from the gallery back to the library.|$|E
500|$|The Britten scholar Donald Mitchell has written, [...] "It is easy, {{because of}} the scope, stature, and sheer volume of the operas, and the wealth of vocal music of all kinds, to pay {{insufficient}} attention to the many works Britten wrote in other, specifically non-vocal genres." [...] Maw said of Britten, [...] "He {{is one of the}} 20th century's great orchestral composers... His orchestration has an individuality, incisiveness and integration with the musical material only achieved by the greatest composers." [...] Among Britten's best-known orchestral works are the Variations on a Theme of Frank Bridge (1937), the Sinfonia da Requiem (1940), the Four Sea Interludes (1945) and The Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra (1945). The Variations, an affectionate tribute to Britten's teacher, range from comic parodies of Italian operatic clichés and Viennese waltzes to a strutting march, reflecting the rise of militarism in Europe, and a Mahlerian funeral march; the piece ends with an exuberant fugal finale. The Sinfonia moves from an opening Lacrymosa filled with fear and lamentation to a fierce Dies irae and then to a final Requiem aeternam, described by the critic Herbert Glass as [...] "the most uneasy 'eternal rest' possible". Mason considers the Sinfonia a failure: [...] "less entertaining than usual, because its object is not principally to entertain but to express symphonically. It fails because it is neither picturesquely nor formally symphonic". The Sea Interludes, adapted by Britten from the full score of Peter Grimes, make a concert suite depicting the sea and the Borough in which the opera is set; the character of the music is strongly contrasted between [...] "Dawn", [...] "Sunday Morning", [...] "Moonlight" [...] and [...] "Storm". The commentator Howard Posner observes {{that there is not a}} bar in the interludes, no matter how <b>beautiful,</b> <b>that</b> is free of foreboding. The Young Person's Guide, based on a theme by Purcell, showcases the orchestra's individual sections and groups, and gained widespread popularity from the outset. Christopher Headington calls the work [...] "exuberant and uncomplicated music, scored with clarity and vigour [...] fits well into Britten's oeuvre." [...] David Matthews calls it [...] "a brilliant educational exercise." ...|$|E
