5|$|Although the RAF claimed six Italian {{aircraft}} {{destroyed and}} two probables, including Cullen's, on 20February, Italian sources reported only the Fiat G.50 of Tenente Alfredo Fusco of the 361a Squadriglia as shot down, killing the pilot, and the G.50 of Tenente Livio Bassi of 395a Squadriglia as damaged in combat and later destroyed by fire in an attempted forced landing at Berat. On 23February, Cullen attacked a CANT Z.506 three-engined floatplane {{as it was}} taking off at Preveza in Greece, at first simply attempting {{to prevent it from}} getting airborne <b>but</b> <b>then,</b> <b>when</b> it refused to stop, destroying it on a second pass.

25|$|Gilliam {{developed}} {{the story and}} wrote {{the first draft of}} the screenplay with Charles Alverson, who was paid for his work but was ultimately uncredited in the final film. For nearly 20 years, Gilliam denied that Alverson had made any material contribution to the script. <b>But</b> <b>then</b> <b>when</b> the first draft was published and original in-progress documents emerged from Alverson's files, Gilliam begrudgingly changed his story. This was too late for either credit on the film or a listing on the failed Oscar nomination for Alverson. He has said that he would not have minded the Oscar nomination, even though he didn’t think much of the script or the finished film. Gilliam, McKeown, and Stoppard collaborated on further drafts. Brazil was developed under the titles The Ministry and 1984 ½, the latter a nod not only to Orwell's original Nineteen Eighty-Four but also to 8½ by Federico Fellini, a director whom Gilliam often cites as one of the defining influences on his visual style when directing. During the film's production, other working titles floated about, including The Ministry of Torture, How I Learned to Live with the System—So Far, and So That's Why the Bourgeoisie Sucks, before settling with Brazil relating to the name of its escapist signature tune.|$|E

He also noted that its contains words that could get an [...] "explicit" [...] sticker by the chain stores. Similarly, Daniel Brockman of The Phoenix remarked that the song is [...] "particularly intriguing" [...] as it progresses through [...] "hard-knockish robbery scenarios" [...] which does not resemble Beyoncé's clean public image. Stacey Anderson of Spin magazine noted that [...] "Diva" [...] places a [...] "startling, sexy snarl over window-rattling bass". Christian Hoard of Rolling Stone noted Beyoncé turns out [...] "modal-sounding hooks" [...] over 808 bass on the song. The Village Voices Nana Ekua Brew-Hammond described Sasha Fierce as [...] "suffer no such identity crisis, brassy, big-headed, confrontational, and witty...", reflected on [...] "Diva".

Noa qualified for the Games by using a wildcard after competing in an event on Tuvalu's main island and was selected {{to take part in the}} men's 100 metres dash. In an interview before the Games he said he was looking to competing in the Olympics and felt nervous but aimed to establish a new personal best time. Noa was drawn in the second heat of the preliminary round on 4 August, finishing sixth out of seven runners, with a time of 11.55 seconds. He finished ahead of Timi Garstang of the Marshall Islands (12.81 seconds) but behind Palau's Rodman Teltull (11.06 seconds) in a heat led by Jurgen Themen from Suriname (10.55 seconds). Overall Noa finished 72nd out of 76 participants and did not advance to the later stages after being 0.75 slower than the slowest athlete in his heat who progressed. After his event he stated: [...] "My race was not good, my aim was to get 10 seconds. The start of my race was good <b>but</b> <b>then</b> <b>when</b> I reached 60 meters, I let it down." ...|$|E

The group was a covers band playing Stray Cats and The Clash material.

2500|$|For {{commercial}} harvesting, collectors {{use either}} basking traps or hoop traps. The basking trap is a floating enclosures with sloping sides and a basking surface. Turtles {{are able to}} climb up the sloping sides onto the basking surface, <b>but</b> <b>then</b> <b>when</b> they jump off into the center, they can't get back out. Hoop traps are cylindrical mesh traps with a funnel opening. Hoop traps are submerged and turtles are attracted by bait. In Minnesota, trappers say that they prefer basking traps to target painted turtles and hoop traps for [...] "meat" [...] turtles (snapping turtles and softshell turtles). Minnesota harvest records also show a clear pattern of most painted turtles coming from basking traps and most softshell and snapping turtles from hoop traps. Three quantitative studies of basking traps also show they are more efficient than baited hoop traps for trapping painted turtles. Despite the many hours of night and cloudiness when the basking traps do not lure turtles, the painted turtle's drive to bask is so powerful, that on a per-day basis, these traps are twice as effective. Or, possibly, the basking traps are more effective since painted turtles frequently escape back out the funnel of hoop traps.|$|E
