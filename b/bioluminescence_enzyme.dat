40|$|Photoswitchable {{spiropyran}} {{has been}} conjugated to the crowned ring system DO 3 A, which improves its solubility in dipolar and polar media and stabilizes the merocyanine isomer. Adding the lanthanide ion gadolinium(III) to the macrocyclic ring system {{leads to a}} photoresponsive magnetic resonance imaging contrast agent that displays an increased spin-lattice relaxation time (T 1 ) upon visible light stimulation. In this work, the photoresponse of this photochromic molecule to weak light illumination using blue and green light emitting diodes was investigated, simulating the emission spectra from bioluminescent enzymes. Photon emission rate of the light emitting diodes was changed, from 1. 75 × 10 16 photons·s− 1 to 2. 37 × 10 12 photons·s− 1 . We observed a consistent visible light-induced isomerization of the merocyanine to the spiropyran form with photon fluxes as low as 2. 37 × 10 12 photons·s− 1 resulting in a relaxivity change of the compound. This demonstrates the potential {{for use of the}} described imaging probes in low light level applications such as sensing <b>bioluminescence</b> <b>enzyme</b> activity. The isomerization behavior of gadolinium(III) -ion complexed and non-complexed spiropyran-DO 3 A was analyzed in water and ethanol solution in response to low light illumination and compared to the emitted photon emission rate from over-expressed Gaussia princeps luciferase...|$|E
40|$|The bright {{bioluminescence}} catalyzed by Photinus pyralis firefly luciferase (Fluc) {{enables a}} vast array of life science research such as bio imaging in live animals and sensitive in vitro diagnostics. The effectiveness of such applications is improved using engineered enzymes that to date have been constructed using amino acid substitutions. We describe ΔFlucs: consecutive single amino acid deletion mutants within six loop structures of the bright and thermostable × 11 Fluc. Deletion mutations are a promising avenue to explore new sequence and functional space and isolate novel mutant phenotypes. However, this method is often overlooked and to date there have been no surveys of the effects of consecutive single amino acid deletions in Fluc. We constructed a large semi-rational ΔFluc library and isolated significantly brighter enzymes after finding × 11 Fluc activity was largely tolerant to deletions. Targeting an “omega-loop” motif (T 352 -G 360) significantly enhanced activity, altered kinetics, reduced Km for D-luciferin, altered emission colors, and altered substrate specificity for redshifted analog DL-infraluciferin. Experimental and in silico analyses suggested remodeling of the Ω-loop impacts on active site hydrophobicity to increase light yields. This work demonstrates the further potential of deletion mutations, which can generate useful Fluc mutants and broaden the palette of the biomedical and biotechnological <b>bioluminescence</b> <b>enzyme</b> toolbox...|$|E
40|$|Members of {{the family}} of {{adenosine}} deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) can catalyze the hydrolytic deamination of adenosine to inosine and thereby change the sequence of specific mRNAs with highly double-stranded structures. The ADARs all contain one or more repeats of the double-stranded RNA binding motif (DRBM). By both in vitro and in vivo assays, we show that the DRBMs of rat ADAR 2 are necessary and sufficient for dimerization of the <b>enzyme.</b> <b>Bioluminescence</b> resonance energy transfer (BRET) demonstrates that ADAR 2 also exists as dimers in living mammalian cells and that mutation of DRBM 1 lowers the dimerization affinity while mutation of DRBM 2 does not. Nonetheless, the editing efficiency of the GluR 2 Q/R site depends on a functional DRBM 2. The ADAR 2 DRBMs thus serve differential roles in RNA dimerization and GluR 2 Q/R editing, and we propose a model for RNA editing that incorporates the new findings...|$|R
40|$|Photorhabdus spp. are Gram {{negative}} enterobacteria {{which have}} a life cycle involving mutualism with a nematode partner and pathogenicity towards insects. Photorhabdus reside as intestinal symbionts of the infective juvenile (IJ) stage of entomopathogenic nematodes of the Heterorhabditis family. The bacteria and its nematode partner together form an insect killing (entomopathogenic) complex that kills the soil dwelling larval stages {{of a wide variety}} of insect species. Photorhabdus spp. have the ability to exist in either of two phenotypically different forms. The bacterial form isolated from the nematode is referred to as the primary phenotype variant, whilst the phenotypically different form is referred to as secondary phenotype variant. This secondary variant is isolated after prolonged stationary phase growth of the primary variant. The secondary variant does not support mutualism with the nematode partner and does not produce pigment, <b>bioluminescence,</b> extracellular <b>enzymes,</b> antibiotics and displays a different colony morphology to the primary variant. Study of the phenotypic switch undergone by Photorhabdus has identified two signalling pathways which play a role in the regulation of phenotypic variation - the LysR-type transcriptional regulator HexA and the ‘adaptation to stationary phase’ AstR-AstS two component signal transduction system. A putative DNA binding protein, Ner, has also been shown to influence the phenotypic switch when overexpressed. This study has confirmed the role of HexA in the regulation of symbiosis, virulence and phenotypic variation in P. temperata K 122 and furthermore, has identified a role for HexA in regulating the small RNA global regulator csrB. Other genes, including hipB (part of a toxin/antitoxin system) and sdiA a LuxR type regulator have also been identified as having potential roles in phenotypic variation. A broad range of other genes that influence phenotypic variation either directly or indirectly have also been identified, providing further insight into the reasons for the occurrence of phenotypic variation in P. temperata K 122...|$|R
40|$|Philosophiae Doctor - PhDPolyamic acid-polypyrrole (PAA/PPy) {{composite}} {{films were}} prepared and characterised {{for the use}} as conducting platforms {{in the design of}} biosensor systems. The thin films were synthesised by electrochemical method from a solution containing controlled molar ratio of chemically synthesised polyamic acid (PAA) and pyrrole monomer. Homogenous films were obtained incorporating PAA into electropolymerised polypyrrole (PPy) thin film. The concentration of PAA (1. 37 × 10 - 6 M) was kept fixed throughout the composite ratio analysis, whilst the concentration of PPy was varied from 1. 9 × 10 - 3 M to 9. 9 × 10 - 3 M. The PAA/PPy thin films were electrodeposited at a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) and characterised using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), Raman spectroscopy, Atomic Force microscopy (AFM), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and electrochemical (CV, SWV) techniques. The composition that best represented the homogenous incorporation of PAA into PPy matrix was observed at a PAA/PPy ratio of 1 : 4. 13 × 10 - 3. This composite was observed to have two sets of coupled peaks with formal potential 99 mV and 567 mV respectively. The De determined from cyclic voltammetry using the anodic peak currents were found to be twice as high (5. 82 × 10 - 4 cm 2 /s) as the De calculated using the cathodic peak currents (2. 60 × 10 - 4 cm 2 /s), indicating that the composite favours anodic electron mobility. Surface morphology and spectroscopy data support the formation of a homogenous polymer blend at the synthesis ratio represented by composite 3. For the construction of a biosensor the spectroscopic and electrochemical properties of the enzyme, luciferase and the analytes i. e naphthalene and fluoranthene were evaluated. Fluorescence spectroscopy studies were carried out to characterize the <b>enzyme’s</b> <b>bioluminescence</b> response in PBS at pH 7. Luciferase showed an absorption peak at 340 nm. The bioluminescence properties of the enzyme with the analytes were explored by fluorescence spectroscopy. The emmision peak at 340 nm gradually decreased as the concentration of each analyte was increased respectively...|$|R
