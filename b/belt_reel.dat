5000|$|... 1981's biggest {{news was}} the {{introduction}} of Cadillac's modulated-displacement 368 in3 V8-6-4 engine. Developed by the Eaton Corporation - with design elements that had been tested for over 500000 mi - allowed various engine computers to decide how many cylinders were needed to power the car for optimal fuel economy. The theory was 8 cylinders from a complete stop, 6 cylinders during usual driving, and just four cylinders at cruising speed. The changes in cylinder operation were seamless, and most drivers did not detect any difference in operation. However, in some cases, reliability and component failure led to customer complaints. Cadillac defended its micro-processor controlled powerplant, and even offered special extended warranties to customers. Also available was Oldsmobile's 5.7-liter V-8 diesel engine. The [...] Buick V6, teamed with an automatic transmission, returned for 1981 after a short initial offering {{in the spring of}} 1980. Coupe de Ville was priced at $13,450, while Sedan de Ville, priced at $13,847, now had the unique option of an available automatic seat belt system - the first offered on a GM vehicle. With the automatic shoulder/lap belt system (only for the outboard front seat passengers), the shoulder point was moved from the upper B-pillar to the upper door glass frame, and the <b>belt</b> <b>reel</b> was moved from the floor onto the door itself, installed in the lower corner. With this, you could theoretically leave the seat belt latched at all times, and simply {{get in and out of}} the vehicle without having to unfasten the belt. The $150 option (which would re-appear as standard equipment on the 1990 - 1992 Brougham), was available only on V6-powered Sedan de Villes. The V6 option itself was a $165 credit over the standard V8 in DeVille. A new grille design was made up of small squares, similar to the pattern from 1979, while the same chromed grille surround from 1980 continued. The egg-crate 1981 grille cast was used again for the 1987 and 1988 Cadillac Brougham models. A new Electronic Climate Control panel did away with the slide lever and thumb wheel in favor of a digital display which allowed the driver to set the interior temperature to a single degree - from 65 to 85 (or [...] "max" [...] settings at 60 and 90 degrees). Option groups included the $1,005 d'Elegance package (available on both models), and the Cabriolet package (for Coupe de Ville) at $363. Sales were up slightly from 1980: 89,991 sedans versus 62,724 coupes (figures include DeVille and Fleetwood models).|$|E
40|$|Title {{supplied}} by photographer.; Part of collection: Jeff Carter collection of photographs, 1952 - 2002.; Also available in an electronic version via the Internet at: [URL] "The military {{influence on the}} surf life saving movement is well illustrated here. There was no sensible reason for such regimentation in the saving of lives, but the practice persisted well after short surfboard and power boat rescues had become more common than <b>belt</b> and <b>reel</b> rescues. When I criticised the antiquated, militaristic surf lifesaving movement in a book title SURF BEACHES OF AUSTRALIA'S EAST COAST (Angus & Robertson 1968) there was a storm of protest from the hierarchy, earheaded by the movement's patron, Sir Adrian Curlewis, who dubbed me the 1968 equivalent of being 'un-Australian'. However the introduction of short Malibu boards, etc. and the dissatisfaction of returning Vietnam veterans with military style restraints quickly revolutionised life saving methods. Today, surfboat races, <b>belt</b> and <b>reel</b> events and march pasts are held purely for their pageantry and tourist drawing potential. " [...] Description {{supplied by}} photographer...|$|R
5000|$|In January 1974 the three-door {{hatchback}} Combi-coupé (marketed as a [...] "Wagon Back" [...] in the USA) was introduced. It was 11 cm {{longer than}} the sedan. Front seats and steering wheel were new for 1974, while the EMS received an all-new, model-specific interior. Inertial <b>reel</b> <b>belts</b> were also fitted.|$|R
5000|$|Aside from a longer, 5 year/50,000 mile warranty, Eldorado {{received}} {{very few}} changes for 1987. A price drop, to $23,740, {{did not raise}} sales any, as only 17,775 were made this year (21,342 for 1986). The standard suspension, with new taller 75 series (previously 70) tires and hydro-elastic engine mounts, was slightly retuned for a softer ride, while the optional ($155) Touring Suspension, with deflected-disc strut valves and 15" [...] alloy wheels, remained for those desiring a firmer ride. As part of a federal requirement to discourage [...] "chop-shop" [...] thieves, major body panels were etched with the VIN. Also new, a combination cashmere cloth with leather upholstery, and locking inertia seat <b>belt</b> <b>reels</b> for rear seat passengers, which allowed for child-seat installation in the outboard seating positions in back. The formal cabriolet roof was added this year. Available for $495 on the base Eldorado, it featured a padded covering over the rear half of the roof, and turned the rear side glass into smaller opera windows. One of Eldorado's most expensive singluar options was the Motorola cellular telephone mounted inside the locking center arm rest. Priced at $2,850, it had been reworked this year for easier operation, and featured a hidden microphone mounted between the sun visors for hands-free operation. Additionally, the telephone featured a clever radio mute control: activated when the telephone and radio were in use at the same time, it automatically decreased the rear speaker's audio volume, and over-rode the front music speakers {{to be used for}} the hands-free telephone. On an interesting note, the square marker lamp, located on the bumper extension molding just behind the rear wheel well on 1986 and '87 Eldorado models, would suddenly re-appear on the 1990 & '91 Seville (base models only) and Eldorado Touring Coupé.|$|R
5000|$|He {{was hired}} as an ocean {{lifeguard}} by Los Angeles County in 1951. When a representative of Surf Life Saving Australia met with Los Angeles County lifeguard leaders, Burnside was appointed to become the president {{of what was to}} be called the Surf Life Saving Association of America, created solely to compete in Australia at the first international lifesaving competition to be held there in conjunction with the 1956 Olympics. He {{was a member of the}} team that traveled to Australia to compete. The team brought Malibu balsa surfboards, which revolutionized surfing in Australia, where up to that time Australians were using boards made of hollow construction mahogany plywood. The team also brought aluminum rescue buoys and the Peterson rescue tube, which were quickly adopted by Australian lifeguards who had previously depended solely on the <b>belt</b> and <b>reel.</b> The team of American lifeguards, who had never competed in Australian lifesaving competition. Burnside placed third in the International belt race at Melbourne, Torquay.|$|R
60|$|At any rate, {{dropping}} the tolla, he snatched at the axe, which was fastened to Twala's wrist by {{a strip of}} buffalo hide, and still rolling over and over, they fought for it like wild cats, drawing their breath in heavy gasps. Suddenly the hide string burst, and then, with a great effort, Sir Henry freed himself, the weapon remaining in his hand. Another second and he was upon his feet, the red blood streaming from the wound in his face, and so was Twala. Drawing the heavy tolla from his <b>belt,</b> he <b>reeled</b> straight at Curtis and struck him in the breast. The stab came home true and strong, but whoever it was who made that chain armour, he understood his art, for it withstood the steel. Again Twala struck out with a savage yell, and again the sharp knife rebounded, and Sir Henry went staggering back. Once more Twala came on, and as he came our great Englishman gathered himself together, and swinging the big axe round his head with both hands, hit at him with all his force.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{introduces}} {{the family of}} the algorithms designed to improve the process of winding up the long conveyor <b>belt</b> passages on <b>reels</b> located inside the bulk containers, used for i. e. rail transport. The proposed method provides the convenient storage technique of the long belt passages, enabling their transport on the standardized rail wagons. Presented solution also addresses the problems related with binding the smaller belt passages, such as shorter life span in comparison to the single-part belt. Moreover, the presented work contains not only the details of the two algorithms representative for the proposed method, but also the outlook of the system of the automatic control required for the successful application of the proposed technique...|$|R
50|$|Mercedes {{introduced}} a coupé {{variant of the}} W114 in 1969, featuring a longer boot hood and available with either a 2.5 or 2.8 litre six-cylinder engine. While a classic and understated design these generally cost less than the W113-based 280 SL model that ran through 1971, and its successor, the 3.5 or 4.5 litre V8 Mercedes SL R107/C107 (1971-1989) roadster and coupé. While a 'hard-top' unlike the fully convertible SL, the pillarless design allowed all the windows to be lowered completely for open air motoring. Only 67,048 coupés were manufactured from 1969 to 1976 (vs. 1.852,008 saloons). Of these 24,669 were 280C and 280CE (top of the range), and 42,379 were the lesser 250C and 250CE (A Mercedes-Benz 220D pickup on the W115 chassis was produced briefly in Argentina in the 1970s.)The W114 received a facelift in 1973 - with a lower bonnet-line, lower and broader grill, a single front bumper to replace the double bumpers, lower placement of the headlamps, A-pillar treatment for keeping the side windows clear, removal of the quarter-windows in the front doors, ribbed tail lights to minimize occlusion of the tail lights with road dirt, and larger side mirrors. The interior received inertia <b>reel</b> <b>belts</b> and a new padded steering wheel with a four-hole design.|$|R
