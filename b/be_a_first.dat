5|$|After a {{successful}} appeal by the British, judges reversed {{the result of}} the match, granting Sarah Stevenson two points for a final round kick to her opponent's head which the judges had previously missed. The reversal of the decision, after video footage was considered, is thought to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>first</b> for the sport. Another British hopeful, Aaron Cook, was also unhappy with the judges after losing out on bronze in the men's −80kg.|$|E
5|$|One Ferugliotherium tooth {{is thought}} to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>first</b> upper molariform (MF1). It is almost {{rectangular}} and bears three longitudinal rows of cusps. There are five cusps in the middle row, which is oriented obliquely, four cusps {{in one of the}} rows {{on the side of the}} tooth, and two or three in the other row on the side. As in the lower molariforms, the cusps are connected by transverse ridges and separated by furrows. LACM 149371, the enigmatic possibly ferugliotheriid tooth from Peru, is a triangular tooth bearing six or seven cusps, which are connected by crests and surround two deep fossae (basins) and a third shallower fossa.|$|E
5|$|The Order is {{dedicated}} to the principles of Charity, Unity, Fraternity, and Patriotism. A First Degree exemplification ceremony, by which a man joins the Order, explicates the virtue of charity. He is said to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>First</b> Degree Knight of Columbus; after participating in the subsequent degrees, each of which focuses on another virtue, he rises to that status. Upon reaching the Third Degree, a gentleman is a full member. Priests do not participate directly in Degree exemplifications as laymen do, but rather take the degree by observation.|$|E

5|$|The first {{aircraft}} in Hasvik was {{an emergency landing}} carried out en route to Svalbard in the early 1970s. The plain where the aircraft landed, located near the village, became {{the site of the}} airport. The regional airline Norving took the initiative in 1972 to construct a simple airfield at Hasvik; they hoped to finance along with the municipality, the National Insurance Administration and the local chapter of the Norwegian Red Cross Search and Rescue Corps. In addition to being able to operate an air taxi service and land air ambulances, locals hoped that the construction would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>first</b> step to becoming part of the state-financed construction of regional airports in Finnmark. However, Hasvik was not selected as one of the original regional airports.|$|E
5|$|The {{numbering}} of the Territorial Force battalions {{was laid}} down by War Office instructions issued in 1914 and 1915. On joining the Territorial Force men {{were asked if they}} would serve overseas (foreign service) or just volunteered for service in the United Kingdom (home service) and their service records amended accordingly. At the declaration of war all Territorial battalions were mobilised and on 15 August 1914 the War Office issued instructions for those men who had volunteered for foreign service to be separated out into what were called first line battalions. Home service men were placed in second line battalions. Thus there would now <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>first</b> line 5th Battalion and a second line 5th Battalion. On 24 November 1914, as the first line battalions began to go overseas, additional instructions were issued allowing the raising of a third line battalion once the first line battalion was on foreign service. In January 1915 these designations were simplified and the battalions called the 1/5th, 2/5th and 3/5th battalions respectively.|$|E

25|$|Motion: Some things {{undoubtedly}} move, though cannot cause {{their own}} motion. Since {{there can be}} no infinite chain of causes of motion, there must <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>First</b> Mover not moved by anything else, and this is what everyone understands by God.|$|E

25|$|Aquinas' {{argument}} from first cause {{started with the}} premise {{that it is impossible}} for a being to cause itself (because it would have to exist before it caused itself) and that it is impossible for there to be an infinite chain of causes, which would result in infinite regress. Therefore, there must <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>first</b> cause, itself uncaused.|$|E

Although Sheringham began the 1998 FIFA World Cup as a starting player with Owen on the bench, after Owen replaced him and almost turned around a defeat against Romania in England's second game of the tournament, it seemed likely that Sheringham's front line international career had come to an end.|$|E
25|$|The {{conjunction}} y avoids denominational confusion {{when the}} paternal surname {{might appear to}} <b>be</b> <b>a</b> (<b>first)</b> name; hence the physiologist Santiago Ramón y Cajal might appear to be named Santiago Ramón (composite) and surnamed Cajal, likewise the jurist Francisco Tomás y Valiente, and the cleric Vicente Enrique y Tarancón. Without the conjunction, the footballer Rafael Martín Vázquez, when referred to by his surnames Martín Vázquez mistakenly appears to be forenamed Martín rather than Rafael, whilst, to his annoyance, the linguist Fernando Lázaro Carreter occasionally was addressed as Don Lázaro, rather than as Don Fernando (Lázaro can be either forename or surname).|$|E

25|$|The 49ers and Raiders {{sharing a}} stadium would not <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>first,</b> {{as the two}} shared Kezar Stadium for part of 1960.

The Raiders, as it stands, play at the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum and are the only NFL team still sharing its home field with a Major League Baseball team; the Raiders' lease on the Coliseum has been on year-to-year extensions since the expiration of the last long-term lease in 2013.|$|E
25|$|The Oct 2017 Law changes {{removed the}} need for {{repetition}} before calling a No ball for dangerous or unfair short-pitched bowling (bouncers), set the limit for beamers in all cricket at waist height, regardless of delivery speed, and treat a deliberate front foot No ball as 'dangerous or unfair,' with immediate sanctions as for a deliberate beamer. There will only <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>first</b> and final warning for throwing. There is now an explicit penalty for underarm bowling. Interception of the ball by a fielder before it reaches the batsman became an explicit No Ball. Bye and Leg bye extras are now be scored as such, rather than as No ball extras.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternative}} minimalist {{approach to}} change provides for removing the sovereign and retaining the governor-general. The most notable model {{of this type}} is the McGarvie Model, while Copernican models replace the monarch with a directly-elected figurehead. These Copernican models allow for regular and periodic elections {{for the office of}} head of state while limiting the reserve powers to the appointed governor-general only. A popularly elected head of state would have the same powers as the monarch, but he or she could not dismiss the prime minister. If this were to happen, it would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>first,</b> as all other former Commonwealth realms have created presidencies upon becoming republics.|$|E
