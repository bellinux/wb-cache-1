5|$|Heyer {{frequently}} {{highlights the}} heroine's many masculine qualities, {{which include a}} fierce independence and a disregard for social mores. Modern literary critics have noted {{that the relationship between}} the protagonists is modelled on those of the latter 20th century, offering companionship and allowing <b>both</b> <b>parties</b> <b>to</b> retain a level of independence. The heroine's unwillingness to conform attracts the hero, rather than repels him.|$|E
5|$|After Kilinochchi was captured, several {{foreign governments}} urged <b>both</b> <b>parties</b> <b>to</b> seek a {{political}} solution. The Colombo Stock Exchange recorded a rise and the rupee stabilized, while celebrators lit firecrackers {{on the streets}} soon after the capture was declared. Amidst the celebrations, a suicide bomb attack occurred in the evening {{in front of the}} air force headquarters in Colombo, killing 3 and wounding about 30 people. The SLA continued to advance into LTTE held territory, capturing some more strategically important locations, including Elephant Pass and the entire A9 Highway soon after the fall of Kilinochchi.|$|E
5|$|In November 1835, an {{expedition}} led by Governor James Stirling joined another party {{led by the}} Surveyor General John Septimus Roe in King George Sound. Roe had made arrangement for <b>both</b> <b>parties</b> <b>to</b> return to the Swan River Colony via an alternative route. The route was intended to join the settlements of King George Sound, York and the Swan River Colony along with the newly established settlement of Williams. This expedition passed through the area of Avondale sighting the Dale River and a granite hill that Roe name Bald Hill on 27 December. Bald Hill was to become the primary reference point for surveying the region.|$|E

5|$|Malaysia {{has never}} {{recognised}} Israel {{and has no}} diplomatic ties with it, and has called for the International Criminal Court {{to take action against}} Israel over their Gaza flotilla raid. Malaysia has stated it will only establish official relations with Israel once a peace agreement with the State of Palestine has been reached and called for <b>both</b> <b>parties</b> <b>to</b> find a quick resolution. Malaysian peacekeeping forces have contributed to many UN peacekeeping missions, such as in Congo, Iran–Iraq, Namibia, Cambodia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Somalia, East Timor and Lebanon.|$|E
5|$|In April 2011, Nhek Bun Chhay {{was elected}} as the party's president, {{replacing}} Keo Puth Rasmey {{who in turn}} was appointed the party's chairperson. Thirteen months later, Nhek Bun Chhay and Ranariddh signed an agreement to merge NRP into FUNCINPEC, which provided for Ranariddh to become FUNCINPEC's president with Nhek Bun Chhay as his deputy. The agreement was brokered by Hun Sen, who wanted <b>both</b> <b>parties</b> <b>to</b> reunite. However, the merger agreement fell apart, as Nhek Bun Chhay and Ranariddh accused each other of harbouring thoughts of supporting other opposition parties. Subsequently, in March 2013, Nhek Bun Chhay was succeeded by Norodom Arunrasmy as the party's president, who in turn resumed his former role as the party's secretary-general. When general elections were held in July 2013, FUNCINPEC suffered defeat as it lost its remaining two seats which it held in the National Assembly. In turn, Nhek Bun Chhay relinquished his Deputy Prime Minister position and was made a government adviser, although the CPP-led government appointed 28 FUNCINPEC members as undersecretaries of state.|$|E
5|$|In July 2003 general {{elections}} were held again, and the CPP won. However, {{they failed to}} secure two-thirds of all parliamentary seats, {{as required by the}} constitution to form a new government. The two runner-up parties of the election, FUNCINPEC and SRP, blocked the CPP from doing so. Instead, in August 2003 they filed complaints with the Constitutional Council over alleged electoral irregularities. After their complaints were rejected, FUNCINPEC and SRP threatened to boycott the swearing-in ceremony of parliamentarians. Sihanouk coaxed <b>both</b> <b>parties</b> <b>to</b> change their decision, stating that he would abstain from presiding over the ceremony as well if they did not comply with his wishes. Both parties eventually backed off from their threats, and the swearing-in ceremony was held in October 2003, with Sihanouk in attendance. The CPP, FUNCINPEC, and SRP held additional talks into 2004 to break the political stalemate, but to no avail. At the same time, Sihanouk proposed a unity government jointly led by politicians from all three political parties, which Hun Sen and Ranariddh both rebuffed.|$|E

5|$|The region took no {{active part}} in the ensuing civil wars until the Battle of Tewkesbury in 1471, but <b>both</b> <b>parties</b> <b>to</b> the feud {{were killed in the}} civil wars over the next few years. The new Earl of Devon, who had killed Radford, was a {{thorough}} supporter of the Lancastrian regime. After the Yorkist victory at the Battle of Northampton in June 1460, he took his troops northwards to Margaret of Anjou in York, where, in April 1461, he was executed by the new king, Edward IV after the Battle of Towton. Bonville's son and grandson had been killed with the Duke of York and the Earl of Salisbury at the Battle of Wakefield in December 1460, and Bonville himself, captured after the Second Battle of St Albans was summarily beheaded – probably, so the chroniclers tell us, after a mock trial directly instigated by the Earl of Devon.|$|E
5|$|By the 1960s, {{even before}} the {{increase}} of abuse of the Case Stated procedure, the United Kingdom {{was estimated to be}} losing £500 million a year through the movement of arbitration business to other countries. In response, the Lord Chancellor convened a Commercial Court Users Conference in 1960, and tasked them with reviewing the system; the conclusion was that the status quo should remain. With the increased use of the Case Stated procedure, more calls for reform came. In June 1977 the London Arbitration Group (LAG) was formed, taking it upon itself to make the government aware of the damage current law was causing. In 1978, in reaction to the continued pressure, the Lord Chancellor established a Commercial Court Committee to again look at the issue; their report, in June 1978, recommended changing the system so that appeal was only allowed when either the High Court permitted it, or <b>both</b> <b>parties</b> <b>to</b> the arbitration agreed it was necessary. This was intended to ensure that any new Act of Parliament fulfilled two roles – firstly, decreasing the use of the Case Stated procedure, and secondly, encouraging arbitrators to give reasons for their decisions.|$|E

25|$|Most notable in the Rabbinic {{period on}} the issue of polygamy, though more {{specifically}} for Ashkenazi Jews, was the synod of Rabbeinu Gershom.
