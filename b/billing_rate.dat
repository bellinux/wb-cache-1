25|$|Madaba Micro Private Sector Participation. In the Madaba Governorate, a {{different}} model of private sector participation (PSP), called Micro PSP, {{has been carried}} out starting in 2006. The Micro PSP involved outsourcing customer service operations to Engicon, a local operator hired on a three-year performance-based contract. Aims of the project were to improve water and wastewater revenue, to increase the <b>billing</b> <b>rate</b> and to develop the customer management organisation, thereby improving efficiency. To achieve this, Engicon trained staff, surveyed and mapped all subscribers and regulated routes to meter readers (to eliminate reader monopoly). The Micro-PSP with Engicon had a variety of positive effects for the Madaba Water Administration: As a result of the cooperation, the Madaba Water Administration could start issuing its own bills instead of having to rely on WAJ structures. The accuracy of meter reading improved and net billed water increased by 75%. Net collections increased from 0.9 million in 2005 to 1.9 million in 2008. The levels of non-revenue water (NRW) initially dropped from an average of 45% to 34%, but in 2009 they were back at 40% due to an increase in water pumping pressure. Advantages of the Micro-PSP model include the fact that WAJ maintained asset ownership and that all revenue collected went to WAJ, so that investment costs could be fully recovered within 13 months of operation. The performance-based contract set strong incentives for the private operator to deliver concrete results.|$|E

The study examines the joint impact of  interest <b>rates</b> and Treasury <b>bill</b> <b>rate</b> on  stock market returns on Ghana Stock Exchange over the period between January 1995 and December 2011. Using Johansen’s Multivariate Cointegration Model and Vector Error  Correction Model the study establish that there is cointegration between Interest <b>rate,</b> Treasury <b>bill</b> <b>rate</b> and stock market returns indicating long run relationship. On the basis of the Multiple Regression Analysis (OLS) carried out by Eviews 7 program, the results show that Treasury <b>bill</b> <b>rate</b> and interest rate both have a negative relationship with stock market returns but  are not  significant. These results lend support to the idea that interest <b>rate</b> and Treasury <b>bill</b> <b>rate</b> has both  negative  relationship  but  weak predictive  power on stock market returns independently. The study conclude that interest <b>rate</b> and Treasury <b>bill</b> <b>rate</b> jointly impact on stock market returns in the long run.

40|$|First, the non-stationarity {{properties}} of the conditional variances in the GARCH(1, 1) model are analysed using the concept of infinite persistence of shocks. Given a time sequence of probabilities for increasing/decreasing conditional variances, a theoretical formula for quasi-strict non-stationarity is defined. The resulting conditions for the GARCH(1, 1) model are shown to differ from the weak stationarity conditions mainly used in the literature. Bayesian statistical analysis using Monte Carlo integration is applied to analyse both stationarity concepts for the conditional variances of the US 3 -month treasury <b>bill</b> <b>rate.</b> Interest rates {{are known for their}} weakly non-stationary conditional variances but, using a quasi-strict stationarity measure, it is shown that the conditional variances are likely to be stationary.

The disturbances of the GARCH model for the treasury <b>bill</b> <b>rate</b> are t-distributed.

We show that consumer heterogeneity in tariff-specific preferences leads to heterogeneity in their sensitivity to price changes.

Our results provide an additional reason why firms should offer multiple tariffs rather than a uniform nonlinear pricing plan to extract maximum consumer surplus.|$|E

The classical assumptions made in the past that call holding times and cell residence times are exponentially distributed are not appropriate for the emerging PCS networks. This paper presents some systematic results on the probability of call completion and the effective call holding time distributions for complete and incomplete calls with general cell residence times and call holding times distributed with various distributions such as Gamma, Erlang, hyperexponential, hyper-Erlang, and other staged distributions.

40|$|In the Australian Medicare system, general {{practitioners}} (GPs) {{are paid}} on a fee-for-service basis. A practitioner {{can choose to}} bill the government directly (termed bulk billing) and receive 85 % of a regulated fee as full payment. Bulk billed consultations are free to the patient. However, GPs are free to charge above the regulated fee. The patient can then claim a rebate from the government but only the equivalent of 85 % of the regulated Medicare fee. Such copayments for GP consultations cannot be covered by private health insurance. In the ten years following the introduction of Medicare in 1984, the bulk <b>billing</b> <b>rate</b> for GP consultations steadily increased to 84 %. Since then the rate has fallen to below 68 %. In April 2003 the Minister for Health announced a reform package under the title A Fairer Medicare which aimed, among other things, to increase the availability of bulk billing for some patients. A key feature of the proposal involved changes to the way that GPs are reimbursed. Following political opposition that would have prevented it passing both houses of the federal parliament, a revised version, MedicarePlus, was released in November 2003.

Due to limited network resources of wireless mobile networks, a call connection may be prematurely disconnected and the ACCT for the call in general {{may not be the}} same as the requested call {{connection time}} (RCCT). The ACCT depends not only on the RCCT, but also on the network resource allocation scheme and network traffic. In this paper, we charac-terize the ACCT and related performance metrics for wireless mo-bile networks under a newly proposed general channel allocation scheme. This scheme generalizes the nonprioritized scheme, the re-served channel scheme, the queueing priority scheme and the sub-rating scheme {{in such a way as}} to reduce the blocking probability of the handoff calls while keeping the ACCT as long as possible. Explicit formulae for the distribution and the expectation of the ACCT are obtained.

It has been successful to build a superior image {{in comparison to the}} other operators. In other words, GP has a clear advantage over the competitors. Grameenphone has some additional features in comparison to its competitors. It is playing a vital role to increase the subscribers of Grameenphone. Another important thing is that GP users are mostly satisfied with the initial price of GP connections and hand-sets. Because, before GP’s introduction to the market, mobile phones were totally out of reach to the major part of the current market. Moreover, Grameenphone subscribers are happy with the country-wide network. But overall, GP users are not satisfied with service of the company. Many important factors are acting as reasons behind this overall dissatisfaction. Grameenphone connections are not always available. The Grameenphonecenters are very important for some after-sales services. But, these have shortage of capacity. GP Subscribers need to spend significant amount of time to reach the customer care. Behavior of the Customer Manager is satisfactory. For customer managers it is too tough to handle a large numbers of subscribers with a smiling face continuously.

40|$|As {{deregulation}} of the electric power system in the United States unfolds, many customers are experiencing changes in their <b>billing</b> <b>rate</b> structure. Some face the addition of power factor penalty tariffs, and seek ways to minimize the added burden. The installation of entrance capacitor banks is the common response, but fails to take complete advantage of capacitor abilities. Other project designs exist that can harness these advantages to the full benefit of the customer. This work will show that distributing shunt capacitors in parallel with induction motors will elevate power factor and voltage, and also decrease ohmic losses in the wiring and protection devices that supply the motor. This reduction often produces a better overall economic solution due to energy savings. The distribution of capacitors at induction motors reduces the reactive current in the branch of the distribution system that supplies them. A reduction in the total current flowing to the motor along the distribution system results in smaller losses throughout the system. As losses diminish, the total real power drawn through the distribution system is lessened, and electric bills are reduced. This alternative to entrance capacitor banks is not as commonly implemented. A misconception that the resistance in facility distribution systems is relatively low has discouraged distributed motor capacitor installation for overall facility power factor correction, in favor of entrance capacitor banks. We will show that the resistance in the distribution system is higher than typically thought, that motor capacitors can exploit this fact, and can often economically outperform entrance capacitor banks which are terminated {{at the point of}} incoming utility power. Motor capacitors are not a new technology. They are commercially available off the shelf technology, suitable for power factor correction for induction motors. Distributed capacitors can be utilized for all significantly sized induction motors in a facility. The elevation in power factor and voltage, reduction in reactive current and real power are calculated, and trends are observed.
