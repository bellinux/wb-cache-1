40|$|Within {{the sport}} of cricket it is common {{practice}} for players to tap the blade of a bat with a hard wood mallet or cricket <b>ball</b> to <b>gauge</b> its potential playing performance. This subjective assessment can produce contradictory opinions on the same bat. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the reliability of the ‘tapping’ test in rating the potential performance of cricket bats. This was done by comparing a measurable performance indicator (apparent coefficient of restitution, ACoR) to player assessment. Twenty experienced amateur and semi-pro cricketers completed a scaled-response questionnaire to describe the sound and feel of impact during the ‘tapping’ test, and rate the predicted performance. Correlations between player responses and ACoR were explored. Predicted bat performance by three out of twenty participants showed correlation with ACoR. It was concluded that the tapping test is not a reliable measure of bat performance across the study population. There are indications that individuals can correctly differentiate bats, but there is clear evidence that they also make errors. A further study with a larger number of participants and an exploration of the relative influence of sensory response will yield further insights to this pilot study...|$|R

40|$|Abstract � This paper {{presents}} {{a comparison of}} different techniques to capture nominal data for its use in later verification and kinematic parameter identification procedures for articulated arm coordinate measuring machines (AACMM). By using four different probing systems (passive spherical probe, active spherical probe, self-centering passive probe and self- centering active probe) the accuracy and repeatability of captured points has been evaluated. The nominal points are materialized by a ball-bar gauge distributed in several positions of the measurement volume. By comparing these systems {{it is possible to}} characterize the influence of the force over the final results for each of the gauge and probing system configurations. The results with each of the systems studied show the advantages and original accuracy obtained by active probes, and thus their suitability in verification (active probes) and kinematic parameter identification (selfcentering active probes) procedures. result in the loss of accuracy in the verification procedure or during the process of capturing data for parameter identification.

40|$|Electrical {{discharges}} {{in liquid}} radiate Aide-band high power ultrasound (HPU) pulses {{which are the}} result of the initial expansion and later collapse of a transient plasma/vapor-filled cavity located between the high voltage and ground electrodes. The cavity may be formed by a process of a fast streamer breakdown, or by a slower Joule heating and evaporation mechanism which leads to the development of an initial inter-electrode gas bubble which subsequently breaks down. An alternative approach is to use fast Joule evaporation of a thin metallic wire placed between the electrodes. Compared with free discharge HPU sources this method could potentially provide a higher efficiency for the conversion of the electrical energy stored in the high-voltage, pulsed power supply into acoustic energy radiated into the liquid. This would be an advantage in practical applications of spark discharge HPU pulses. The present paper discusses the generation of acoustic pulses in water by wire-guided spark discharges. Wire-guided spark discharges with energies up to 1 kJ have been generated by capacitor-based pulsed power circuitry in a plastic tank filled with tap water.

40|$|We ibvestigate the {{continuum}} {{limit of the}} gauge-ball spectrum in the four-dimensional pure U(1) lattice gauge theory. In the confinement phase we identify various states scaling with the correlation length exponent ν ⋍ 0. 35.

Possible scenarios for constructing a non-Gaussian continuum theory with the observed gauge-ball spectrum are discussed. The 0 ++ state, however, scales with a Gaussian value ν ⋍ 0. 5. This suggests {{the existence of a}} second, Gaussian continuum limit in the confinement phase and also the presence of a light or possibly massless scalar in the non-Gaussian continuum theory.

At sufficiently strong gauge coupling, the chiral symmetry is broken {{and the mass}} of the unconfined composite fermion F = χ̅ϕ is generated dynamically by gauge interaction. The scalar supresses this symmetry breaking and induces a line of second order transitions with scaling properties similar to the Nambu [...] Jona-Lasinio model.

40|$|Rail {{lubrication}} in curves {{was widely}} introduced in Sweden during the 1970 ’s {{due to the}} high wear rate of gauge faces in sharp curves. The first tests performed in Sweden showed that lubrication decreased wear rates by roughly 10 times. Based upon these results, the Swedish track system was equipped with wayside lubricators called Clicomatic. Aside from wear, rolling contact fatigue (RCF) is another limiting factor in railway infrastructure productivity. Head checking {{is one of the}} fatigue forms that arises in curves of heavily loaded tracks as well as fast train tracks. Head checkings grow at the rail head, close to the gauge corner. High pressure and a sliding motion lead to plastic strain of the material from the rail <b>ball</b> towards the <b>gauge</b> face. There is a coupling between wear rates and RCF damages, high wear rates may lead to reduced RCF damages and vice versa. Hence, frequent application of lubricants to the rail does extend the rail life by several times but may, on the other hand, lead to fatigue problems. Preventive grinding in combination with lubrication has been {{the most efficient way to}} avoid fast degrading of curved rail track. This thesis concerns the progress of rail lubrication in terms of how environmentally adapted lubricants function both in wayside lubricators and at the track. Another aspect of the thesis is to find a lubricant able to reduce the wear rate at the gauge face while simultaneously decreasing the crack growth at the rail head. One thought was to use controlled wear to reduce rolling contact fatigue. Controlled wear in this situation means that the usage of a lubricant should give a sufficiently high wear rate to continuously wear off the surface layers. Another idea along the same lines was that of low contact friction. Low friction in the contact gives less plastic strain and subsequently less head checking. Rapeseed oil had shown low contact friction in earlier testing, therefore, synthetic esters were of interest to examine in this application. From both field tests and laboratory tests it was concluded that the wear protection for environmentally adapted lubricants was comparable to that of previously used lubricants if they were applied by trackside lubricators. Although they were known to be more sensitive to low temperatures, testing showed how to overcome this issue. Wear and friction tests were performed in the laboratory to evaluate lubricating blends. The tests evaluated rolling / sliding as well as pure sliding contacts. The research performed in this thesis yielded the following results. Pure synthetic ester (TMP-Oleat and TMP-C 8 -C 10) in a sliding contact resulted in high wear rates and a lot of abrasive marks at the surface. By adding friction modifiers, the friction as well as the wear rate decreased considerably in the sliding contact. In the rolling sliding contact, synthetic ester alone and synthetic ester with the addition of friction modifiers both showed similarly low friction and wear rates. PAO gave higher friction, but at the same time, the surfaces had significantly fewer cracks as compared to synthetic ester formulations. One observation was that surfaces lubricated by synthetic esters became less hard and the hardness interval was wider than those lubricated with PAO. One explanation is that even if the overall friction is low, local spots of high friction between asperities can lead to localized strain and crack initiation. The conclusions are that Rapeseed oil is the recommended base for rail lubricants. The tested synthetic esters are a more expensive alternative useful if excellent low temperature properties are needed. Graphite is not necessary in the lubricant if it is applied continuously by a wayside lubricator. Twin-disc tests showed that low contact friction does not necessary mean that crack initiations are avoided in the surface. In conclusion, the base fluid and the additives influenced not only the wear rate but also the ability for cracks to grow. Godkänd; 2006; 20061116 (pafi...|$|R
