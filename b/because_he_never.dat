5|$|Tim Burton {{signed with}} Walt Disney Pictures to direct two films in Disney Digital 3D, which {{included}} Alice in Wonderland and his remake of Frankenweenie. Burton developed the story <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>never</b> felt an emotional tie {{to the original}} book.|$|E
5|$|Retiring {{from the}} {{military}} in December 1963, Shoup {{took a job at}} a life insurance company, but remained influential in the administration. Johnson considered taking Shoup as an adviser on a February 1964 trip to Vietnam, but did not, either <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>never</b> made the invitation or because Shoup declined. Johnson appointed Shoup to the National Advisory Commission on Selective Service in early 1966. It disbanded on 1 January 1967 after submitting a report.|$|E
5|$|Edward VI (12 October 1537 – 6 July 1553) was King of England and Ireland from 28 January 1547 {{until his}} death. He was crowned on 20 February {{at the age}} of nine. The son of Henry VIII and Jane Seymour, Edward was England's first monarch to be raised as a Protestant. During his reign, the realm was governed by a Regency Council <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>never</b> reached his majority. The Council was first led by his uncle Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset (1547–1549), and then by John Dudley, 1st Earl of Warwick, from 1551 Duke of Northumberland.|$|E

5|$|Robinson again {{assumed the}} {{position}} as Speaker of the Senate on August 16, 1862 {{as part of}} a political deal to effect the resignation of Governor Beriah Magoffin. Magoffin's lieutenant governor, Linn Boyd, had died in office in 1859, and Magoffin was unwilling to allow John Fisk, then Senate Speaker and next in line for the governorship, to succeed him. Magoffin agreed to resign if the Senate would elect Robinson as Speaker, putting him next in line for the governorship. This was done, and at 10:00am on August 18, 1862, Robinson succeeded Magoffin upon the latter's resignation. <b>Because</b> <b>he</b> <b>never</b> resigned from the Senate, Robinson technically held both his legislative seat and the governorship concurrently.|$|E
5|$|As Jerry is {{sleeping}} on the plane he dreams of returning to his apartment only to find several FBI agents there interrogating Kramer, who apparently has ratted out Jerry. When Jerry protests that {{he had nothing to}} do with it, they reveal that the Russian was an undercover FBI agent. Jerry tries to flee only to be gunned down by the agents. This jolts him awake. He finds his show is canceled due to bad weather, and George picks up Jerry at the airport. Jerry is initially amazed that George is perfectly willing, even anxious to drive Jerry home. When he informs George they cannot go back to his apartment because of the baby shower, George insists and Jerry discovers that George is wearing the red shirt and is just using the favor as a chance to encounter Leslie at the baby shower. Meanwhile, Kramer and the two Russians crash the shower to install cable television, start to eat all the food and get into a heated argument. When George and Jerry arrive, George's plan proves unsuccessful, as he cannot muster the courage confront Leslie and instead awkwardly tries to curry her favor. He is interrupted when one of the other party guests (Margaret Reed as Mary) suddenly confronts Jerry <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>never</b> called her back after a date. This unpleasant scene is the final straw and the guests leave hurriedly. On the way out of the bathroom the angry woman bumps Leslie and her dessert into George, adding a chocolate cake stain to the Bosco stain already on the shirt. Jerry changes his mind about the cable hook-up, but is still charged with a large amount of money. When he refuses to pay, the Russians break the picture tube of his television set.|$|E
25|$|The Independent Authority Against Corruption (IAAC) arrested Enkhbayar at {{the dawn}} of 13 April 2012. The IAAC stated that it arrested Enkhbayar for {{questioning}} in a graft case involving the illegal privatization of a government-owned hotel <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>never</b> showed up for questioning eleven times over a year during the investigation, thus it was forced to arrest him.|$|E

6000|$|Why {{had this}} {{extraordinary}} resemblance never struck him before? Perhaps <b>because</b> <b>he</b> had <b>never</b> examined Arthur Carr's hair with attention {{until he had}} possessed himself of Mary's bracelet, and had gone away to the country. Perhaps also <b>because</b> <b>he</b> had <b>never</b> yet taken notice enough of Zack's hair to care to look close at it. And now the resemblance was traced, to what conclusion did it point? Plainly, from Zack's youth, to none in connection with him. But what elder relatives had he? and which of them was he most like? ...|$|R

25|$|At times, Don Eleuterio {{has been}} accused of mistreating his son, {{particularly}} <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>never</b> changes the family diet; since the only decent cooking recipe Eleuterio knows was the one he learned as attendant of a mess hall while in the Army (and since cooking anything more extravagant would be, in his view, effeminate), he feeds his son steamed white rice, mashed potatoes and canned corn every single day (and sometimes for both lunch and dinner).|$|E
25|$|For {{many years}} and in part <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>never</b> had to sell his work to support himself, Caillebotte's {{reputation}} as a painter was overshadowed by his recognition as {{a supporter of the}} arts. Seventy years after his death, however, art historians began reevaluating his artistic contributions. His striking use of varying perspective is particularly admirable and sets him apart from his peers who may have otherwise surpassed him. His art was largely forgotten until the 1950s, when his descendants began to sell the family collection. In 1964, The Art Institute of Chicago acquired Paris Street; Rainy Day, spurring American interest in him. By the 1970s, his works were being exhibited again and critically reassessed.|$|E
25|$|Tsukuru stays {{alone with}} Kuro, now a {{successful}} pottery artist. Eri prefers {{to dispense with}} nicknames and explains that Yuzu was mentally ill. The rape accusation was a fabrication, but he was cut off {{as a way of}} not frontally contradicting Yuzu to enable her to deal with her problems. Eri reveals that {{she was in love with}} Tsukuru, which could have played a role in the accusation, but also that Yuzu was actually raped and had a miscarriage, then developed anorexia as a way of never being pregnant again. Eri told him nothing, maybe <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>never</b> noticed her love, but mostly to prevent a confrontation with Yuzu. Tsukuru was sacrificed to protect Yuzu because the group believed he was the strongest emotionally and could deal with the ban. These redemptive revelations give the lie to Tsukuru's own perception of himself as plain and colorless.|$|E

Lilly is cold to Mia's attempts to make up but when she finds out that Mia is planning to lose her virginity to J.P., Lilly interferes and tells her that she and J.P. had sex (J.P. had lied about being a virgin to Mia) and his plans to use Mia's fame to his own advantage. Lilly also helps indirectly in the patching up of Mia and her brother Michael's relationship. The girls make up and become best friends again.|$|E

500|$|In [...] "Que Nadie Vea", {{the singer}} writes about {{homosexuality}} {{for the first}} time in his career. In the song, Arjona became the witness of this character, from his childhood until his adulthood, always hiding his true identity with the goal of being socially accepted. Arjona commented in an interview that [...] "Que Nadie Vea" [...] was not intended to be a [...] "judgemental" [...] song, further stating that it was [...] "just a chronicle" [...] that he wrote for this album <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>never</b> did so before and found the subject to be fascinating.|$|E
500|$|With {{encouragement}} from Jim, Paul started playing the family piano and wrote [...] "When I'm Sixty-Four" [...] on it.

After Paul and Michael became interested in music, Jim connected the radio {{in the living room}} to extension cords connected to two pairs of Bakelite headphones so that they could listen to Radio Luxembourg at night when they were in bed.|$|E
500|$|By 1980, [...] "Captain Jack" [...] had mostly {{disappeared}} from Joel's concert setlists. Nevertheless, he always played it in Philadelphia, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>never</b> forgot {{the role the}} song and the city played in his early career. A version recorded at The Spectrum in July 1980 was used on his live album, Songs in the Attic. Joel wrote, [...] "'Captain Jack' plays with much more power and conviction when a roaring Philadelphia audience sets off a kind of internal explosion and the adrenaline screams through our veins ... When we play 'Captain Jack', we are actually committing an act of pure brutality." [...] Timothy White of Rolling Stone did not like this version, calling it [...] "grating".|$|E

He would eat at the piano with one hand and keep playing with the other. He had no other interests that I was aware of. He could play forever." [...] At this time, Marmarosa did not drink or take hard drugs, but his behavior was often eccentric. Mills reported that [...] "Dodo was just a big kid [...] He never really grew up <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>never</b> allowed anything but the piano to be important to him. The piano was his life. He heard things in his head that he wasn't able to play and it frustrated him. Once, he got mad at the old upright piano we had and chopped it up with an axe." ...|$|E
500|$|At the {{beginning}} of Final Fantasy VIII, Squall {{is known as a}} [...] "lone wolf" [...] <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>never</b> shows his feelings and seems cold to his associates. His superiors (such as teacher Quistis Trepe) consider him difficult to deal with, but respect his talents. Squall is stoic, with his taciturn nature used for comic relief. He is dragged into a heroic role when Cid, headmaster of Balamb Garden, appoints him leader of the academy midway through the game. During a late battle against Galbadia Garden, Squall has difficulty exhibiting leadership because of his lingering isolation. Although other characters try to pull him out of his shell and Rinoa Heartilly expends considerable energy pursuing him, it takes time for him to accept the others' friendship, fall in love with Rinoa and care for her. Squall is more comfortable later in a leadership role, especially when he must fight Ultimecia.|$|E

And I'm not saying that Alex ever consciously thought, I can’t leave her while she's sick, but now that she's not, now that she seems like she's going to get better, it just comes to him. He deserves more. He's a good guy and he deserves more. But loving Izzie showed him that he can be good, is good. So it was a little gift.
