40|$|This study {{analyzes}} the bearings used in pitch control system of a wind turbine which enables the blades {{to have an}} optimum angle of attack for efficient power generation and to prevent over-speeding of the blades. Large forces and moments act on the pitch control bearings causing significant wear and deformations of the bearings. In this study, the wear pattern in the pitch control bearings has been simulated using discrete element method and deformations in the bearings have been investigated using finite element software ABAQUS. ^ A six degree freedom dynamic bearing model (DBM) was developed for analysis of four point contact bearing which are commonly used in wind turbine pitch control. DBM for four point contact bearings was tested for accuracy under simple loading conditions. The model was also used to demonstrate the effectiveness of four point contact bearings to resist moment and axial loads. The model was validated by comparing velocities of bearing elements obtained from DBM for four point contact bearings with those from kinematic model which considers pure rolling conditions between ball and the races and neglects the effect of external forces. Parametric studies were performed to investigate the effect of changes in bearing geometry and operating conditions on the bearing performance. Further, the ball motion causing mechanical wear in pitch control <b>bearing</b> <b>raceways</b> was simulated using the DBM for four point contact bearings. ^ Finite element analysis was performed on a model of wind turbine hub with three pitch control bearings using ABAQUS. Initially, a model was developed to calculate the loads (forces and moments) acting on pitch control bearings {{as a function of}} wind speed, wind turbine blade properties (geometry, weight), angular velocity, pitch angle and angular position of the blade. These loads were applied on the inner race of the bearings modeled in ABAQUS and the deformations and stress in the <b>bearing</b> <b>raceways</b> were investigated. The bearings modeled in ABAQUS were four point contact and double row bearings. ABAQUS / Explicit finite element analysis which is well-suited for non-linear problems such as contacts observed in bearings was used. ^ Due to the large axial loads and moments acting on the pitch control bearings, the bearing races undergo large deformations. The pitch control bearings have large diameter (approximately 2 meters) and as the loads on the outer race vary over its surface, the outer race acquires a shape similar to that of a potato chip. These deformation characteristics of the pitch control bearings were simulated using ABAQUS. The finite element analysis also provides magnitude and locations of maximum stress and deformation in the <b>bearing</b> <b>raceways.</b> Further, the locations of maximum deformation were verified analytically to validate the finite element analysis results. A parametric study was also performed to investigate the effect of wind speed, pitch angle and blade rotation speed on the deformations of the bearings. ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. Annealed {{low-alloy}} steels {{and some}} related alloys exhibit a typical sharp yield point and an immediate stress drop {{followed by a}} yield plateau and further hardening. Most existing constitutive models of cyclic plasticity do not {{take account of the}} aforementioned phenomenon. As a result, these models evaluate a degree of plastic strain inaccurate.

The set-up comprises a spherical roller which is intermittently loaded between two <b>bearing</b> <b>raceways</b> driven at a prescribed speed.

Brinell damage to <b>bearing</b> <b>raceways</b> can lead to torque variations (noise) and reduced bearing life. The growing use of ceramic rolling elements with high stiffness in hybrid bearings exacerbates the situation. A new family of hard yet resilient materials based upon nickel-titanium is emerging to address such bearing challenges. 60 NiTi is a superelastic material that simultaneously exhibits high hardness and a relatively low elastic modulus (~ 100 GPa) and has been shown to endure higher indentation loads than conventional and high performance steel.

When the resulting dent depth data for all the indenter ball sizes are normalized using the Hertz equations, the data (dent depth vs. stress) are comparable.

40|$|International audienceThe {{characterization}} of the stress state in a material {{is important in the}} aeronautical and spatial sector, because the fatigue strength is intimately bounded to their internal stress distribution. The purpose of our work is to present and to develop a magnetic model of the Barkhausen noise to identify the stress profiles of the contact zones of the <b>bearing</b> <b>raceways</b> and rolling elements. By means of a post-processing technique, we succeeded in plotting magnetic Barkhausen noise energy hysteresis cycles MBNenergy(H). These cycles were compared to the usual hysteresis cycles, displaying the evolution of the magnetic induction field B versus the magnetic excitation H. The divergence between these comparisons as the excitation frequency was increased gave rise to the conclusion that there was a difference in the dynamics of the induction field and of the MBNenergy related to the domain wall movements. Indeed, for the MBNenergy hysteresis cycle, merely the domain wall movements were involved. On the other hand, for the usual B(H) cycle, two dynamic contributions were observed: domain wall movements and diffusion of the magnetic field excitation. From a simulation point of view, it was demonstrated that over a large frequency bandwidth a correct dynamic behavior of the domain wall movement MBNenergy(H) cycle could be taken into account using first-order derivation whereas fractional orders were required for the B(H) cycles. The present article also gives a detailed description of how to use the developed process to obtain the MBNenergy(H) hysteresis cycle as well as its evolution as the frequency increases. Moreover, this article provides an interesting explanation of the separation of magnetic loss contributions through a magnetic sample: a wall movement contribution varying according to first-order dynamics and a diffusion contribution which in a lump model can be taken into account using fractional order dynamics...|$|R
