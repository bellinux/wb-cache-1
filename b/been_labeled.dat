5|$|Boletus pinophilus forms ectomycorrhizal {{relationships}} with pine (Pinus), fir (Abies) and spruce (Picea). It {{can therefore be}} located wherever those trees grow, particularly with Scots pine in Britain, preferring the poor, acidic, and sandy soils associated with coniferous forests. It appears to favour Pinus, while {{the form of the}} mushroom occurring in association with Abies and Picea has <b>been</b> <b>labeled</b> Boletus pinophilus var. fuscoruber. However, it is not confined to coniferous trees and may also be found fruiting in deciduous forests, such as under chestnut trees. Fruiting bodies can occur singly, or in small groups throughout the summer and autumn months, although they are known to appear as early as April in Italy.|$|E
5|$|Korn are {{identified}} as the pioneers of nu metal music, a form of alternative metal music {{which began in the}} mid-1990s. While generally considered an alternative metal and nu metal band, the band has also <b>been</b> <b>labeled</b> as heavy metal, grunge, hard rock, rap metal, funk metal, groove metal and industrial metal. Their debut album mixed metal, funk, hip-hop, groove, and dissonance. Their lyrics focus on pain and personal alienation rather than traditional heavy metal themes. In Nu-metal: The Next Generation of Rock & Punk, Korn was marked as the third biggest nu metal band in the world.|$|E

50|$|Carrillo used many intervals, {{although}} {{mainly in}} multiples of 4 such as 16, 32, and 64 so that between {{each of the}} whole tones, 16, 32, or 64 additional notes were created. Carrillo called these intervals 16hs of a tone, 32nds of a tone, and 64ths of a tone, respectively. As a result, C would <b>be</b> <b>labeled</b> 0, D flat would <b>be</b> <b>labeled</b> 8, D would <b>be</b> <b>labeled</b> 16, E flat would <b>be</b> <b>labeled</b> 24, E would <b>be</b> <b>labeled</b> 32, etc., for 16ths of a tone.|$|R
5|$|The {{issues of}} federalism, {{ethnicity}} {{in politics and}} state centralisation were not resolved by the crisis and partly contributed {{to a decline in}} support for the concept of the state among Congolese people. Mobutu was strongly in favour of centralisation and one of his first acts, in 1965, were to reunify provinces and abolish much of their independent legislative capacity. Subsequent loss of faith in central government {{is one of the reasons}} that the Congo has <b>been</b> <b>labeled</b> as a failed state, and has contributed violence by factions advocating ethnic and localised federalism.|$|E

Despite this, Tomoya is very loyal to his friends, and has been known to dedicate himself for those around him in need of help or support. He generally has a selfless personality and does not ask much from others in return for what he does for them.|$|E

5|$|With the {{publication}} of I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, Angelou publicly discussed aspects of her personal life. She was respected as a spokesperson for black people and women, and her works have been considered a defense of black culture. Her works are widely used in schools and universities worldwide, although {{attempts have been made}} to ban her books from some U.S. libraries. Angelou's most celebrated works have <b>been</b> <b>labeled</b> as autobiographical fiction, but many critics consider them to be autobiographies. She made a deliberate attempt to challenge the common structure of the autobiography by critiquing, changing and expanding the genre. Her books center on themes such as racism, identity, family and travel.|$|E
5|$|Nahuatl {{has been}} spoken in central Mexico {{since at least}} the seventh century CE. It was the {{language}} of the Aztecs who dominated what is now central Mexico during the Late Postclassic period of Mesoamerican history. During the centuries preceding the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, the Aztecs had expanded to incorporate a large part of central Mexico, and its influence caused the variety of Nahuatl spoken by the residents of Tenochtitlan to become a prestige language in Mesoamerica. At the conquest, with the introduction of the Latin alphabet, Nahuatl also became a literary language, and many chronicles, grammars, works of poetry, administrative documents and codices were written in it during the 16th and 17th centuries. This early literary language based on the Tenochtitlan variety has <b>been</b> <b>labeled</b> Classical Nahuatl, and is among the most studied and best-documented languages of America.|$|E
5|$|The {{first state}} {{highways}} along the US131 corridor were designated {{as early as}} 1919. When the US Highway System was formed on November 11, 1926, US131 was created along the route of M-13 in Michigan. Originally ending at Fife Lake on the north end, the highway was extended to Petoskey in the late 1930s. Further changes were made, starting in the 1950s, to convert segments {{of the road to}} a full freeway. The state started this conversion simultaneously at two locations: heading north from Three Rivers, and heading both north and south from a point in southern Kent County. A third segment was built south of Cadillac and over subsequent years Michigan filled the gaps in the freeway. Cadillac and Manton were bypassed {{in the early part of}} the 21st century, resulting in the current freeway configuration. Another large-scale construction project in 2000 rebuilt an unusual section of the freeway through Grand Rapids known as the S-Curve. Two bridges formerly used by US131 have <b>been</b> <b>labeled</b> by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) as historic structures; one of them has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).|$|E
