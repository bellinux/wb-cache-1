5|$|The Kangchu {{acted as}} the {{middleman}} in the <b>bulk</b> <b>purchase</b> of the settlement's commodities through suppliers based in Singapore. In particular, opium was highly popular among the coolies, although frowned {{upon by the}} British who took strong measures to suppress its distribution. The Kangchu formed illegal opium syndicates which had links to Chinese leaders from Singapore and other Malay states in the north, particularly Selangor. British contempt for the Kangchu was also fuelled by the coolies' preference for gambling and prostitution, {{both of which were}} seen as social vices by the British colonial government. The Kangchu maintained friendly relations with the Temenggong (later Sultan), and worked closely with the Ngee Heng Kongsi in administrative matters. In particular, the state government attempted to forge close relations with the Kangchu by the appointment of a Malay official who was conversant in Teochew and literate in Chinese characters, Mohamed Salleh bin Perang, as the liaison officer between the Temenggong and the Kangchu. Several years later, in the early 1870s, the state government worked closely with the Ngee Heng Kongsi to draft the Kanun Kangchu which had legal clauses that defined the powers of the Kangchu in Johor. The Kanun Kangchu contained 81 clauses in total, and was implemented in 1873.|$|E

25|$|The {{proportion}} of GNP {{spent on the}} NHS rose from 4.2% in 1964 to about 5% in 1969. This additional expenditure provided for an energetic revival of a policy of building health centres for GPs, extra pay for doctors who served in areas particularly short of them, a significant growth in hospital staffing, and {{a significant increase in}} a hospital building programme. Far more money was spent each year on the NHS than under the 1951–64 Conservative governments, while much more effort was put into modernising and reorganising the health service. Stronger central and regional organisations were established for <b>bulk</b> <b>purchase</b> of hospital supplies, while some efforts were made to reduce inequalities in standards of care. In addition, the government increased the intake to medical schools.|$|E
2500|$|Of {{these eight}} policies, the living wage, the {{unemployment}} allowance, nationalisation of banking and the <b>bulk</b> <b>purchase</b> {{of raw materials}} and foodstuffs were the chief concern of the ILP. Increasing the unemployment allowance and switching to bulk purchasing were {{to be done in}} the conventional way, but the method of paying the living wage differed from Labour practices. The ILP criticised the [...] "Continental" [...] method of paying wage allowances from employers' pools, which had been implemented in 1924 by Rhys Davies. The ILP proposed to redistribute the national income, meeting the cost of the allowances by taxing high income earners.|$|E
