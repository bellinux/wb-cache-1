25|$|Scotia Quay and Panns Bank {{are based}} across the River Wear from St Peter's Campus, {{across the road}} from The <b>Bonded</b> <b>Warehouse.</b> The {{location}} of these halls used {{to be one of the}} many locations on the river that were used by the former ship building industry.|$|E
25|$|The architects were {{local firm}} Foster & Wood, {{working in the}} Bristol Byzantine style. The {{basement}} {{was used as a}} <b>bonded</b> <b>warehouse</b> handling the cargoes from the docks. The original hall included a coffered barrel-vaulted ceiling, and was modelled after St George's Hall, Liverpool. The foyer building with the grand staircase and smaller hall were opened in 1873. A meeting calling for Women's suffrage was held at the hall in November 1880.|$|E

25|$|After the ITV merger in 2004, the {{possibility}} of selling the Quay Street site was considered, with staff, studios and offices moved into the adjacent <b>bonded</b> <b>warehouse</b> building.

ITV considered relocating to Trafford Wharf across the Manchester Ship Canal from the BBC at MediaCityUK. Discussions continued for several years and an agreement in principle was reached in 2008.|$|E
25|$|Sunderland's inaugural {{film festival}} {{took place in}} December 2003 at the <b>Bonded</b> <b>Warehouse</b> on Sunderland riverside, {{in spite of the}} lack of any cinema {{facilities}} in the city at that time, featuring the films of local and aspiring directors as well as reshowings of acclaimed works, such as Alan Bleasdale's The Monocled Mutineer, accompanied by analysis. By the time of the second festival commencing on 21 January 2005, a new cinema multiplex had opened in Sunderland to provide a venue which allowed the festival to showcase over twenty films.|$|E

25|$|The Roundhouse {{was built}} in 1846 as a {{turntable}} engine shed (or roundhouse) for the London and Birmingham Railway, and {{was known as the}} Great Circular Engine House, or the Luggage Engine House. The original building was built by Branson & Gwyther, using designs by architects Robert B. Dockray and Robert Stephenson. Within ten years locomotives became too long for the building to accommodate, and the Roundhouse was used for various other purposes. The longest period of use (50 years, beginning in 1871) was as a <b>bonded</b> <b>warehouse</b> for Gin distillers W & A Gilbey Ltd.|$|E
25|$|Inventory credit {{refers to}} the use of stock, or inventory, as {{collateral}} to raise finance. Where banks may be reluctant to accept traditional collateral, for example in developing countries where land title may be lacking, inventory credit is a potentially important way of overcoming financing constraints. This is not a new concept; archaeological evidence suggests that it was practiced in Ancient Rome. Obtaining finance against stocks {{of a wide range of}} products held in a <b>bonded</b> <b>warehouse</b> is common in much of the world. It is, for example, used with Parmesan cheese in Italy. Inventory credit on the basis of stored agricultural produce is widely used in Latin American countries and in some Asian countries. A precondition for such credit is that banks must be confident that the stored product will be available if they need to call on the collateral; this implies the existence of a reliable network of certified warehouses. Banks also face problems in valuing the inventory. The possibility of sudden falls in commodity prices means that they are usually reluctant to lend more than about 60% of the value of the inventory at the time of the loan.|$|E
500|$|Undeterred, Watkins {{contacted}} {{the agents of}} the cast and director, and eventually the online fan clubs [...] "Friends of Firth" [...] and [...] "Ken Friends". He discovered that the film had appeared {{as part of the}} National Film Theatre's Branagh season in May 1999, and that the film's American distributors, Warner Bros., had a print in a <b>bonded</b> <b>warehouse.</b> However, it was unclear who possessed the rights to the film.

[...] However, the city's Municipal Wharf No. 1 was nearly complete in 1914, and harbor officials next turned their attention {{the construction of a}} large <b>bonded</b> <b>warehouse</b> to handle the [...] "sea caravans" [...] that were expected to crowd the harbor {{at the end of the}} war.|$|E

2500|$|The {{early history}} of Beaujolais Nouveau can trace its roots to 19th century when the first wines of the vintage were sent down the Saône to the early bistros of Lyon. Upon their arrival signs would be put out proclaiming [...] "Le Beaujolais Est Arrivé!" [...] and its {{consumption}} {{was seen as a}} celebration of another successful harvest. In the 1960s, this style of simple Beaujolais became increasingly popular worldwide with {{more than half a million}} cases of being sold. In 1985 the Institut National des Appellations d'Origine (INAO) established the third Thursday of November to allow for a uniform release date for the wine. Wines are typically shipped a few days earlier to locations around the world where they must be held in a <b>bonded</b> <b>warehouse</b> till 12:01am when the wines can be first opened and consumed.|$|E

60|$|Free trade, in {{its true}} signification, {{or in the}} only signification {{which is not a}} fallacy, can only mean a {{commerce}} that is totally unfettered by duties, restrictions, prohibitions, and charges of all sorts. Except among savages, the world never yet saw such a state of things, and probably never will. Even free trade ports have exactions that, in a degree, counteract their pretended principle of liberty; and no free port exists, that is anything more, in a strict interpretation of its uses, than a sort of <b>bonded</b> <b>warehouse.</b> So long as your goods remain there, on deposit and unappropriated, they are not taxed; but the instant they are taken to the consumer, the customary impositions must be paid.|$|E
60|$|One of the rottenest-looking {{parts of}} the town, I think, is down by the landing-wharf: though it may be, that its being {{associated}} {{with a great deal}} of rottenness on the evening of our arrival, has stamped it deeper in my mind. Here, again, the houses are very high, and are of an infinite variety of deformed shapes, and have (as most of the houses have) something hanging out of a great many windows, and wafting its frowsy fragrance on the breeze. Sometimes, it is a curtain; sometimes, it is a carpet; sometimes, it is a bed; sometimes, a whole line-full of clothes; but there is almost always something. Before the basement of these houses, is an arcade over the pavement: very massive, dark, and low, like an old crypt. The stone, or plaster, of which it is made, has turned quite black; and against every one of these black piles, all sorts of filth and garbage seem to accumulate spontaneously. Beneath some of the arches, the sellers of macaroni and polenta establish their stalls, which are by no means inviting. The offal of a fish- market, near at hand--that is to say, of a back lane, where people sit upon the ground and on various old bulk-heads and sheds, and sell fish when they have any to dispose of--and of a vegetable market, constructed on the same principle--are contributed to the decoration of this quarter; and as all the mercantile business is transacted here, and it is crowded all day, it has a very decided flavour about it. The Porto Franco, or Free Port (where goods brought in from foreign countries pay no duty until they are sold and taken out, as in a <b>bonded</b> <b>warehouse</b> in England), is down here also; and two portentous officials, in cocked hats, stand at the gate to search you if they choose, and to keep out Monks and Ladies. For, Sanctity as well as Beauty has been known to yield to the temptation of smuggling, and in the same way: that is to say, by concealing the smuggled property beneath the loose folds of its dress. So Sanctity and Beauty may, by no means, enter.|$|E
6000|$|From 1823 onward, {{the chief}} scene of Charles Jenkin's {{activities}} {{was in the}} West Indies, where he was engaged off and on till 1844, now as a subaltern, now in a vessel of his own, hunting out pirates, [...] "then very notorious," [...] in the Leeward Islands, cruising after slavers, or carrying dollars and provisions for the Government. While yet a midshipman, he accompanied Mr. Cockburn to Caraccas and had a sight of Bolivar. In the brigantine Griffon, which he commanded in his last years in the West Indies, he carried aid to Guadeloupe after the earthquake, and twice earned the thanks of Government: once for an expedition to Nicaragua to extort, under threat of a blockade, proper apologies and a sum of money due to certain British merchants; and once during an insurrection in San Domingo, for the rescue of certain others from a perilous imprisonment and the recovery of a [...] "chest of money" [...] of {{which they had been}} robbed. Once, on the other hand, he earned his share of public censure. This was in 1837, when he commanded the Romney, lying in the inner harbour of Havannah. The Romney was in no proper sense a man-of-war; she was a slave-hulk, the <b>bonded</b> <b>warehouse</b> of the Mixed Slave Commission; where negroes, captured out of slavers under Spanish colours, were detained provisionally, till the Commission should decide upon their case, and either set them free or bind them to apprenticeship. To this ship, already an eyesore to the authorities, a Cuban slave made his escape. The position was invidious: on one side were the tradition of the British flag and the state of public sentiment at home; on the other, the certainty that if the slave were kept, the Romney would be ordered at once out of the harbour, and the object of the Mixed Commission compromised. Without consultation with any other officer, Captain Jenkin (then lieutenant) returned the man to shore and took the Captain-General's receipt. Lord Palmerston approved his course; but the zealots of the anti-slave trade movement (never to be named without respect) were much dissatisfied; and thirty-nine years later the matter was again canvassed in Parliament, and Lord Palmerston and Captain Jenkin defended by Admiral Erskine {{in a letter to the}} Times (March 13, 1876).|$|E
