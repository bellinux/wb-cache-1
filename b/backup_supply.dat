25|$|Aetra {{gets its}} entire raw {{water from the}} West Tarum Canal, while Palyja {{complements}} low-price raw water from the West Tarum Canal by buying bulk treated water at higher prices from the Cisadane Treatment Plant owned by Tangerang District Water Works Enterprise 30km southwest of Jakarta. Palyja also obtains water from the polluted Kali Krukut River in South Jakarta after passing through filtration wells and after treating it. Furthermore, in times of scarcity, water from the heavily polluted Ciliwung River is used for <b>backup</b> <b>supply.</b>|$|E
25|$|The pneumofathometer line on {{a surface}} {{supplied}} umbilical {{is a valuable}} <b>backup</b> <b>supply</b> in case of damage to the main supply hose, or if a diver needs to supply air to another diver on surface supply, as the usual configurations of helmet and full face mask do not allow buddy breathing of the conventional kind. The Pneumo line can be tucked into the neck dam or under the skirt of a full face mask, and provided the helmet or mask is not leaking heavily, will supply adequate air for an assisted ascent.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} 2005, Koeberg started {{experiencing}} numerous technical difficulties. On 11 November 2005, a fault on {{a transmission}} busbar caused the reactor to go into safe mode, cutting supply {{to most of the}} Western Cape for about two hours. On 16 November a fire under a 400 kV transmission line caused the line to trip, causing severe voltage dips which resulted in Koeberg once again shutting down. Various parts of the Cape were left without electricity for hours at a time. On the evening of 23 November, a routine inspection of the backup safety system revealed a below-spec concentration of an important chemical, resulting in a controlled shutdown of the reactor. Due to the sufficiency of <b>backup</b> <b>supply,</b> major power cuts were not experienced until Friday 25 November, when the backup capacity began running out. At this point, rotational load shedding was employed, with customers being switched off in stages for most of the day. Koeberg was re-synchronised to the national grid on Saturday 26 November.|$|E

500|$|Governor Morton {{was called}} the [...] "Soldier's Friend" [...] because of his efforts to equip, train, and care for Union {{soldiers}} in the field. Indiana's state government financed {{a large portion of}} the costs involved in preparing its regiments for war, including housing, feeding, and equipping them, before their assignment to the standing Union armies. To secure arms for Indiana's troops, the governor appointed purchasing agents to act on the state's behalf. Early in the war, for example, Robert Dale Owen purchased more than $891,000 in arms, clothing, blankets, and cavalry equipment for Indiana troops; the state government made additional purchases of arms and supplies exceeding $260,000. To provide ammunition, Morton established a state-owned arsenal at Indianapolis served the Indiana militia, home guard, and as a <b>backup</b> <b>supply</b> depot for the Union army. The state arsenal operated until April 1864, employing 700 at its peak; many of its employees were women. A federal arsenal was also established in Indianapolis in 1863.|$|E

40|$|Distribution system {{reliability}} assessment {{is an important}} part of distribution system operation and planning. This paper presents some approaches taken to minimize the SAIDI (System Average Interruption Duration Index) for a remote distribution feeder in an 11 kV distribution system. Resulting from unavailability of alternative <b>backup</b> <b>supplies</b> from the other adjacent feeders, distributed generators (DG) can be used as <b>backup</b> <b>supplies</b> in this case. Coordinating distribution automation (DA) system with DGs, the restoration area can be made larger and the outage time can be shorter, consequently, the distribution {{system reliability}} can be improved significantly. In this paper, factors affecting SAIDI are discussed and methods including feeder reconfiguration, recloser installation and replacement and DG installation are applied to minimize SAIDI. Comparative studies are performed and related results are addressed...|$|R

50|$|Lake Shenorock once {{supported}} two beaches {{but they}} were closed in 1977 {{so that it could}} be used as a <b>backup</b> <b>supply</b> for the Amawalk and Shenorock water district and tributary to the Amawalk Reservoir. The current association, the United Owners Association of Shenorock, submitted a proposal to the Somers Town Board to create a Park District where recreational swimming would be able to return to the lake after renditions to the Lake were made. Due to the Eutrophic condition of the lake and lack of a clubhouse, restoration projects such as dredging and installment of aeration devies would need to be implemented to enable recreational swimming. For more information on the proposal visit the Shenorock Park District YouTube page.|$|E

5000|$|When built, the Langford {{pumping station}} {{contained}} two triple-expansion steam engines, with {{room for a}} third, which was fitted in 1931. There were used in pairs, and each drove a low lift pump to transfer water to the treatment works, and a high lift pump to take treated water and pump it along a 28 in cast iron pipe to Southend. The pipe crossed below the River Crouch at Hullbridge, where shafts were built {{on either side of}} the river, and a tunnel was constructed between them. The water main is formed of twin steel tubes within the tunnel. The engines were normally worked in pairs, and a pair could deliver [...] per day. In August 1927, water from the Chelmer started to be used, and between then and 1945, 96 per cent of the water supplied by Southend Waterworks came from Langford. The wells and boreholes were maintained, to provide a <b>backup</b> <b>supply</b> when necessary.|$|E
