5|$|In {{almost all}} {{versions}} of the tale, Ila wants to live as a man, but in the Skanda Purana, Ila desires to be a woman. The king Ela (Ila) entered Parvati's grove at Sahya mountain and became the woman Ilā. Ilā wished to remain a woman and serve Parvati (Gauri) and Ganga, the goddess of the Ganges river. However, the goddesses dissuaded {{him and told him}} that life as a woman was a curse and full of sorrow. Ilā <b>bathed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> sacred pool and returned as Ela, bearded and deep-voiced.|$|E
25|$|The {{national}} park is <b>bathed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> subarctic climate (Dfc {{according to the}} Köppen classification). The maritime influence explains why its early summers are colder than they are farther inland, but its autumns are in contrast more mild. The topography causes important local variations.|$|E

25|$|The park is <b>bathed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{continental}} climate (Dfb in the Köppen climate classification), with rain mostly in summer. It is {{situated on the}} climate frontier between north and south, which helps determine the Limes Norrlandicus marking {{the border between the}} north of Scandinavia and the south. The snow cover lasts a little over 3 months and the river is frozen during a similar period, {{with the exception of the}} rapids, which remain ice-free for most of the winter.|$|E
25|$|In Scott's first appearance, {{his body}} would glow green or be <b>bathed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> green light {{whenever}} {{he used his}} power, such as passing through a wall or flying. During his earliest appearances, he would project a beam of green light from his ring that could do {{a variety of things}} such as move objects, melt metal, shrink objects, or put out fires. He rarely used it as an actual weapon and preferred to fight with his fists like any other pulp-adventure hero would do. The ring made him invulnerable to any weapon not made of wood.|$|E
25|$|In 1838 Delacroix {{exhibited}} Medea {{about to}} Kill Her Children, which created a sensation at the Salon. His first large-scale {{treatment of a}} scene from Greek mythology, the painting depicts Medea clutching her children, dagger drawn to slay them in vengeance for her abandonment by Jason. The three nude figures form an animated pyramid, <b>bathed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> raking light which penetrates the grotto in which Medea has hidden. Though the painting was quickly purchased by the State, Delacroix was disappointed when it {{was sent to the}} Lille Musée des Beaux-Arts; he had intended for it to hang at the Luxembourg, where it would have joined The Barque of Dante and Scenes from the Massacres of Chios.|$|E

They are surrounded by fairies, ondines, nymphs, gnomes and other mythical creatures who dance and sing for their entertainment. Suddenly the castle walls part and Stello de Nici appears. René demands to {{know who he is}} and Stello tells him that he is Mélusine's lover. René draws his sword, but Stello's powers make it fall apart in his hands. Stello then reveals Mélusine's trickery to René and tells him about her diabolic nature and pagan practices. René is overcome with remorse and vows to seek Blanche's forgiveness. He curses Mélusine as do a large chorus of demons whom Stello has summoned. As daylight breaks, Mélusine's face takes on a horrible expression and she is <b>bathed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> lurid green light.|$|E
25|$|Job (Arabic Ayyub ايوب) {{is one of}} the 25 prophets {{mentioned}} by name in the Quran, where he is lauded as a steadfast and upright worshiper (Q.38:44). His story has the same basic outline as in the Bible, although the three friends are replaced by his brothers, and his wife stays by his side. In Palestinian folklore Job's place of trial is Al-Joura, a village outside the town of Al Majdal (Ashkelon). It was there that God rewarded him with a Fountain of Youth that removed whatever illnesses he had and restored his youth. Al-Joura was a place of annual festivities (four days in all) when people of many faiths gathered and <b>bathed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> natural spring. In Lebanon the Muwahideen (or Druze) community have a shrine built in the Shouf area that allegedly contains Job's tomb. In Turkey, Job is known as Eyüp, and he is supposed to have lived in Şanlıurfa. There is also a tomb of Job outside the city of Salalah in Oman.|$|E

The four industrial artworks atop the support towers of the Kansas City Convention Center (Bartle Hall) were once the subject of ridicule, but now define the night skyline near the new Sprint Center along with One Kansas City Place (Missouri's tallest office tower), the KCTV-Tower (Missouri's tallest freestanding structure) and the Liberty Memorial, a World War I memorial and museum that flaunts simulated flames and smoke billowing into the night skyline. It was designated as the National World War I Museum and Memorial in 2004 by the United States Congress. Kansas City is home to significant national and international architecture firms including ACI Boland, BNIM, 360 Architecture, HNTB, Populous. Frank Lloyd Wright designed two private residences and Community Christian Church there.|$|E

25|$|The {{kernel of}} Craig's monodramatic {{interpretation}} {{lay in the}} staging of the first court scene (1.2). The stage was divided sharply into two areas {{through the use of}} lighting: the background was brightly lit, while the foreground was dark and shadowy. The screens were lined up along the back wall and bathed in diffuse yellow light. From a high throne upon which Claudius and Gertrude sat, which was <b>bathed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> diagonal, bright golden beam, a pyramid descended, representing the feudal hierarchy. The pyramid gave the illusion of a single, unified golden mass, from which the courtier's heads appeared to stick out through slits in the material. In the foreground in dark shadow, Hamlet lay slouched, as if dreaming. A gauze was hung between Hamlet and the court, further emphasising the division. On Claudius' exit-line the figures remained in place while the gauze was loosened, so that the entire court appeared to melt away before the audience's eyes, {{as if they had been}} a projection of Hamlet's thoughts that now had turned elsewhere. The scene, and the gauze effect in particular, prompted an ovation from the audience, which was unheard of at the MAT.|$|E

In , Murió la Verdad (The Truth has died), she lies dead. In , Si resucitará? (Will she live again?), she is shown lying on her back with breasts exposed, <b>bathed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> halo of light before a mob of [...] "monks and monsters". In plate 82, Esto es lo verdadero (This is the true way), she is again bare-breasted and apparently represents peace and plenty. Here, she lies {{in front of a}} peasant.|$|E

In {{the second part of}} a {{behind the scenes}} look of 4 Intimate Nights with Beyoncé, it is revealed that Beyoncé {{was in charge of the}} orchestra's design and stage set-up, stating that a three level stage would be needed, allowing the back-up singers to be at the top and the orchestra to be on the same level as Beyoncé herself, as to allow viewers to see them.|$|E

500|$|The gondolas were {{filmed in}} the moat on Caerphilly Castle and {{inserted}} with CGI. [...] Locals {{were used in}} the marketplace, including a woman who had passed by the filming site with her goat. A small crew did go to Venice to take wide shots of the buildings that bordered the water but did not have walkways as they did in Trogir. Campbell wanted to incorporate everything he loved about Venice, including church bells and narrow alleyways. Though Trogir was on the coast, it did not have internal waterways, so the production team found they could fill a square on the street below the balcony where the characters were with computer generated water and make it part of the Grand Canal. The chamber in which the girls were taken to be turned into the Saturnynians was <b>bathed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> green light to suggest alien technology and also ease the brief glimpse of Rosanna's true form. The cinematographer accomplished this despite the low ceilings. Parts of this scene were cut due to censorship issues for being [...] "too scary".|$|E
500|$|Quatermass (John Mills), {{now living}} in {{retirement}} in Scotland, travels to London {{in search of his}} granddaughter, Hettie Carlson (Rebecca Saire), who has gone missing. He is shocked by the scale of the urban collapse that has struck the city – law and order has broken down and marauding gangs terrorise the litter-strewn, decaying streets. Appearing as a guest on a television programme covering the [...] "Hands in Space" [...] project, a joint space mission between the United States and Russia, Quatermass is horrified when the two spacecraft are destroyed by some unknown force. Astronomer Joe Kapp (Simon MacCorkindale), another guest on the programme, invites Quatermass to join him at his home in the country where he has constructed a radio telescope. At the radio telescope, Kapp's colleagues report that they detected a powerful signal at the exact time of the incident in space. Quatermass is intrigued by the behaviour of a group of hippie-like youngsters known as the Planet People, who are travelling to various neolithic sites from where they believe they will be transported to a better life on another planet. Quatermass suspects Hettie has joined them. Along with Kapp's wife, Claire (Barbara Kellerman), Quatermass and Kapp follow a group of Planet People to a stone circle of megaliths, Ringstone Round. As they watch, the Planet People assembled inside the circle are <b>bathed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> bright light and disappear, leaving only a residue of white dust.|$|E

500|$|A promotional {{music video}} was {{produced}} {{to accompany the}} release of [...] "Do or Die" [...] as a single. The video was directed by Jake & Jim who also directed the video for the group's previous single, [...] "Fire in My Heart". The video begins with the camera zooming in {{through the door of}} a cartoon house in the desert to reveal Super Furry Animals playing along to the track in a room. The band's heads and instruments are live action footage, filmed in London, while their bodies and surroundings are brightly coloured animations. During the first verse, shots of the group playing the track in the room are intercut with images of band members on cartoon surfboards superimposed onto real life footage of giant waves. This process is repeated during the second chorus, with the video cutting between shots of the band playing in the room and images of the band superimposed onto live footage of tornados. After 1 minute and 4 seconds images of the group's heads being swept along in a lava flow are intercut with the band playing along with the track in the now red room with lava visible through the windows. Snow then begins to fall in the room and the video cuts to shots of the group eascaping an avalanche in a bobsled. As the track ends the lightbulb in the room begins to swing frantically and Super Furry Animals are <b>bathed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> green [...] "radioactive or alien glow". A shot of the house in front of a nuclear explosion cuts to footage of the band frozen mid-word, with the camera moving through 360 degrees to reveal them as two dimensional cutouts.

[...] The subject's attraction was undoubtedly mainly the opportunity it offered for a group of several females to be shown largely nude.|$|E
