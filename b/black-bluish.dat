We have {{demonstrated in the}} past that the ovary can be salvaged provided detorsion is performed. We studied the outcome of women undergoing minimal surgery for ischemic ovaries versus the extended procedure including cystectomy in respect of ovarian function and fertility performance. Methods: We retrospectively studied 102 women who underwent surgery for torsion of the ovary in which the macroscopic appearance of <b>black-bluish</b> ischemic adnexa was encountered during surgery. Detorsion without removal of the adnexa or the ovary was performe...|$|E

A more conservative approach to the treatment of torsion is becoming increasingly common, as seems warranted in light of the low incidence of malignancy [17, 18]. Laparoscopic detorsion, rather than adnexectomy, seems to be an effective adnexa-sparing approach [18]. However, adnexectomy is indicated in cases of gangrenous adnexa, neoplastic ovarian cyst, or unusual ovarian attachment [19]. In this study, adnexectomy was performed for 14 patients (73.7 %), due to extensive gangrenous changes, while detorsion was carried out for only 5 (26.3 %) cases. Late presentation and delayed diagnosis of adnexal torsion were the leading causes of this radical approach. Many of these cases were admitted to other departments with unclear diagnosis for many days before their referral to the gynecology department. Extended awareness of all concerned specialties may lead to early diagnosis and, hence, more conservative management, particularly in infertile women. One-hundred and two women with twisted <b>black-bluish</b> ischemic adnexa were safely treated with detorsion rather than adnexectomy in a previous study [20]. They reported smooth postoperative course, good follicular development, and normal anatomy in most cases. Since leaving dead tissues in the abdomen {{is a serious}} decision, we think that adding Doppler ultrasonography to the preoperative diagnostic work-up in suspected cases of adnexal torsion would differentiate healthy from devitalized tissue to determine the appropriate surgical technique. Instead, intraoperative laparoscopic ultrasonography can properly evaluate the adnexa and the blood vessels [21]. In this study, in the LAS group, cases of large adnexal gangrenous cysts were treated by preliminary aspiration, which was very helpful to have an easy access to the mesosalpinx during adnexectomy. This simple step has made adnexectomy feasible in all cases without the need for laparotomy. Gorkemli et al. [22] performed laparotomy for one case out of nine occurrences of detorsion due to the large size of the ovary. In this study, no case of recurrence of adnexal torsion was encountered and we were not obliged to fix the adnexa by sutures in any case. Ovarian bivalving after detorsion was recently described to decrease intracapsular pressure, increase arterial perfusion, and to facilitate adnexal reperfusion and recovery [23].|$|E
