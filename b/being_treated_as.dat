5|$|In 1974, {{staff at}} Canada Post's Montreal office were noticing a {{considerable}} number of letters addressed to Santa Claus entering the postal system, and those letters were <b>being</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> undeliverable. Since employees handling those letters did not want the writers, mostly young children, to be disappointed at the lack of response, they started answering the letters themselves.|$|E
5|$|Several {{key areas}} have been {{targeted}} for economic analysis and reform: the environmental effects of unconstrained economic growth; the consequences of nature <b>being</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> an economic externality; {{and the possibility of}} an economics that takes greater account of the social and environmental consequences of market behavior.|$|E
5|$|Aggressive mimicry is {{opposite}} {{in principle}} to defensive mimicry, where the mimic generally benefits from <b>being</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> harmful. The mimic may resemble its own prey, or some other organism which is beneficial {{or at least not}} harmful to the prey. The model, i.e. the organism being 'imitated', may experience increased or reduced fitness, or may not be affected at all by the relationship. On the other hand, the signal receiver inevitably suffers from being tricked, {{as is the case in}} most mimicry complexes.|$|E

5|$|Alfred A. Knopf, Inc. {{had planned}} to publish The Well of Loneliness in the United States {{at the same time}} as Cape in the United Kingdom. But after Cape brought forward the {{publication}} date, Knopf found itself in the position of publishing a book that had been withdrawn in its home country. They refused, telling Hall that nothing they could do would keep the book from <b>being</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> pornography.|$|E
5|$|In Reformed theology, baptism is {{a sacrament}} {{signifying}} the baptized person's union with Christ, or {{becoming part of}} Christ and <b>being</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> if they had done everything Christ had. Sacraments, along with preaching of God's word, are means of grace through which God offers Christ to people.

5|$|In {{the period}} from 1975 to 2001, the Emir ruled by decree. Human rights activists and {{opposition}} leaders made repeated allegations of systematic torture, the arbitrary arrest of thousands, and assassinations, {{all of which were}} denied by the authorities.

5|$|Many of Priestley's {{political}} writings {{supported the}} repeal of the Test and Corporation Acts, which restricted the rights of Dissenters. They could not hold political office, serve in the armed forces, or attend Oxford and Cambridge unless they subscribed to the Thirty-nine Articles of the Church of England. Dissenters repeatedly petitioned Parliament to repeal the Acts, arguing that they were <b>being</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> second-class citizens.|$|E

5|$|If {{permanent}} brachytherapy is used, {{low dose}} radioactive sources (seeds) {{are left in}} the body after treatment – the radiation levels are very low and decrease over time. In addition, the irradiation only affects tissues within a few millimeters of the radioactive sources (i.e. the tumour <b>being</b> <b>treated).</b> <b>As</b> a precaution, some people receiving permanent brachytherapy may be advised to not hold any small children or be too close to pregnant women {{for a short time}} after treatment. Radiation oncologists or nurses can provide specific instructions to patients and advise for how long they need to be careful.|$|E

Right after their arrival at the airport, a press conference was held, which was broadcast live around the world. The Libyan government led by Muammar Gaddafi allowed the Munich attackers to take refuge and go into hiding, ignoring the demands of West German foreign minister Scheel {{to put them on}} trial. In a large scale covert operation dubbed Wrath of God, Israel would subsequently aim at them being tracked down and killed.|$|E
5|$|Jersey is {{not part}} of the United Kingdom, and has an {{international}} identity separate from that of the UK, but the UK is constitutionally responsible for the defence of Jersey. The definition of United Kingdom in the British Nationality Act 1981 is interpreted as including the UK and the Islands together. The European Commission have confirmed in a written reply to the European Parliament in 2003 that Jersey is within the Union as a European Territory for whose external relationships the UK is responsible. Jersey is not fully part of the European Union but has a special relationship with it, notably <b>being</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> within the European Community for the purposes of free trade in goods.|$|E
5|$|While {{cyberpunk}} {{remained a}} core {{part of the}} game, the team were faced with the trouble that no-one really knew what cyberpunk was any more: the most recent game and film references they had were from the early 2000s, as many works {{that might have been}} classed as cyberpunk were now <b>being</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> science fiction. While they could easily have replicated the atmosphere of films like Blade Runner, the team wanted to create something original within the genre. Something that concerned the team was about portraying the world of Human Revolution in relation to the original Deus Ex, which chronologically took place 25 years later: while the original Deus Ex used technological elements common {{at the time it was}} made such as 4:3 aspect ratio monitors and landline telephones, Human Revolution used mobiles and wide-screen televisions. According to Jacques-Belletête, this separation was ultimately put down to the differing portrayals of the world between the two games: while Deus Ex was set in poor communities and focused on the social impact of new technology, Human Revolution focused on the high end of society and technology's physical impact.|$|E

30|$|The {{obtained}} inter-story drift {{results are}} indicated {{the amount of}} dissipated displacement and energy dissipation is increased in a system by more ductility and deformability. The flexural frame is contributed more than x-braced frame in strain energy absorption, because of its ductile characteristics. Construction of ODBS system is divided by two patterns. First, adding off-diagonal steel brace to the first story RC frame, since the x-brace system is used for other stories (composed bracing system by ODBS at first story and x-bracing system for other stories). As second pattern, adding the off-diagonal bracing system to all stories of RC frame (without any composed bracing system). If the system of bracing selected from first pattern, the first story <b>treats</b> <b>as</b> a ductile system and other stories were <b>being</b> <b>treat</b> <b>as</b> a semi rigid body.|$|R
50|$|It {{is used as}} a {{fumigant}} {{when other}} pesticide applications are impractical and when structures and installations are <b>being</b> <b>treated,</b> such <b>as</b> in ships, aircraft, and grain silos. All of these structures can be effectively sealed or enclosed in a gastight membrane, thereby containing and concentrating the phosphine fumes. Fumigants are also applied directly to rodent burrows.|$|R
5|$|Tropical Storm Vamei {{weakened}} {{quickly as}} it crossed the extreme southern portion of the Malay Peninsula, and late on December 27 the JMA downgraded it to tropical depression status before the cyclone emerged into the Straits of Malacca. The JTWC initially maintained it as a minimal tropical storm, though the agency downgraded the storm to depression status as the center again approached land. Early on December 28, Vamei moved ashore along northeastern Sumatra, and at 0600UTC the JMA classified the storm as dissipated. However, convection persisted near the circulation over land, {{believed to have been}} caused by the process known as upper-level diffluence. On December 29, what was originally believed to be a separate system reached the southeastern Bay of Bengal. In a post-season re-evaluation, the JTWC classified the system as a continuation of Vamei, based on analysis of satellite imagery that indicated the circulation of Vamei crossed Sumatra without dissipating. Convection re-developed, and late on December 30 the JTWC classified the cyclone as a tropical storm about 390km (245mi) west-southwest of the northwestern tip of Sumatra; initially, due to <b>being</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> a separate system, it was classified as Tropical Cyclone05B. Vamei quickly developed good outflow and organization, though increased wind shear on December 31 rapidly weakened the storm; by late that day, the center was exposed from the deep convection, and Vamei quickly dissipated.|$|E

40|$|The chapter {{takes its}} {{inspiration}} and starting point from Simon Frith's writings about song lyrics. Extending Frith's focus on lyrics as performance, it argues that lyrics can be approached independently from their performed context (without <b>being</b> <b>treated</b> naively <b>as</b> poetry). It {{also argues that}} the practices of songwriters, briefly discussed, should be more central to popular music research and study...|$|R
