5|$|At the Swansea end, Tennant built a sea-lock, so that boats {{could enter}} Fabian <b>Bay,</b> <b>and</b> named the area Port Tennant. His {{terminus}} was destroyed when the Prince of Wales Dock was {{constructed by the}} Swansea Harbour Trust in 1881. It occupied all of the area which had been Fabian <b>Bay,</b> <b>and</b> so a lock was constructed to enable boats to reach tidal water by passing through the dock, and a wharf for the canal was constructed at {{the eastern end of}} the dock. Tennant's wharf was again destroyed in 1898, when the dock was extended. Wharfage was provided for the canal along the entire southern side of the extension, but no lock was built to allow canal boats to enter the dock, even though the Act of Parliament made provision for one. A new branch of the canal was built in 1909, which included a lock into the newly constructed Kings Dock, where a lay-by berth was provided on its north side.|$|E
