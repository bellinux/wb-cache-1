40|$|A {{study was}} made of the pumping {{capacity}} of pitched blade impellers in a cylindrical pilot plant vessel with four standard radial baffles at the wall under a turbulent regime of flow. The pumping capacity was calculated from the radial profile of the axial flow, under the assumption of axial symmetry of the discharge flow. The mean velocity was measured using laser Doppler anemometry in a transparent vessel of diameter T = 400 mm, provided with a standard dished bottom. Three and six blade pitched blade impellers (the pitch angle varied within the interval a Îá 24 °; 45 °ń) of impeller/vessel diameter ratio D/T = 0. 36, as well as a three blade pitched blade impeller with folded blades of the same diameter, were tested. The calculated results were compared with the results of experiments mentioned in the literature, above all in cylindrical vessels with a flat bottom. Both arrangements of the agitated system were described by the impeller energetic efficiency, i. e, a criterion including in dimensionless form both the impeller energy consumption (impeller power input) and the impeller pumping effect (impeller pumping capacity). It follows from the results obtained with various geometrical configurations that the energetic efficiency of pitched blade impellers is significantly lower for configurations suitable for mixing solid-liquid suspensions (low impeller off <b>bottom</b> <b>clearances)</b> than for blending miscible liquids in mixing (higher impeller off <b>bottom</b> <b>clearances)</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Many {{studies on}} solid-liquid mixing have been {{dedicated}} to low density particles at low solids concentrations. In the present work, {{computational fluid dynamics}} (CFD) simulation and experimental methods were employed to study suspension of high density particles (nickel) at high solids concentration in water. The work first focused on establishing the velocity field in a liquid-only system and then progressed to a solid-liquid system. In the liquid-only system, the influence of tank geometry and simulation strategies, including turbulence models, on fluid flow pattern and mixing was investigated in a tank stirred by a Rushton turbine. The standard k-f. model gave better overall predictions of mean velocity fields than the k-ro and RNG k-f. models. The CFD simulation and experimental results obtained with the laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV) method showed that mixing time and homogenization energy decreased with {{a decrease in the}} impeller <b>bottom</b> <b>clearance.</b> It was further shown that there is a <b>bottom</b> <b>clearance</b> range in which a draft tube can aid mixing in a tank stirred by the Rushton turbine. In the solid-liquid system, a hydrofoil impeller was used to investigate the influence of simulation strategies, particle properties and hydrodynamic operating conditions on mixing features such as the off-bottom solids suspension, cloud height, solids concentration distribution and local particle size distribution. The simulation results were compared with experimental ones, in which the off-bottom solids suspension was determined visually and an optical attenuation technique was employed to determine the cloud height and solids concentration distribution. The local particle size distribution (PSD) in the tank was measured by a laser diffraction method. A better agreement between the simulation and experimental results was obtained with drag models that account for the solids loading or free stream turbulence than those that do not. It was shown that the Stokes law applies up to a diameter of 150 ~m for the nickel particles. A CFD simulation strategy for studying mixing of high density solids is proposed and it is shown that a CFD simulation method can be used to develop empirical models that predict mixing features. A CFD simulation approach that takes particle size into account gives predictions that are more representative of practical applications than the mono-size particle simulation approach.

The results showed a reduction in mixing time and power consumption at a low impeller clearance, with reference to the standard clearance, and a further reduction of the same parameters was obtained for a system fitted with a draft tube. At the low clearance, there was an increase in mixing efficiency by 46 %, for a system without draft tube and 61 % for that with the draft tube...|$|E

The placement of the valves necessitated an inside-connected valve gear, and the Stephenson pattern was used (being the dominant type of the era anyway). One extra appliance required was a starting valve, manually controlled, which allowed admission of high-pressure boiler steam directly to the low-pressure intake. Without this, the low-pressure cylinders would have to actually work against atmospheric pressure.|$|R

Two aims of the study were defined: the dependence of the rate of the erosion process of the impeller blades on impeller frequency of revolution and {{on the size of the}} mixing equipment. Experiments were carried out on pilot plant mixing equipment of two sizes (geometrically similar) made of stainless steel (diameters of cylindrical vessels T 1 = 200 mm and T 2 = 300 mm, diameters of impellers D 1 = 100 mm and D 2 = 66. 7 mm, impeller off <b>bottom</b> <b>clearances</b> h 1 = 100 mm and h 2 = 66. 7 mm, respectively) equipped with four radial baffles (width b 1 = 30 mm, b 2 = 20 mm, respectively) and an impeller with four inclined plane blades (pitch angle α = 30 °, 45 °, relative blade with W/D = 0. 2) made of rolled brass (Brinnel hardness 40 - 50 BM) always pumping the liquid downwards towards the float vessel bottom. The wear of the impeller was described by an analytical approximation in exponential form with two parameters (the wear rate constant k and the geometrical parameters of the worn blade C) calculated by the least squares method from the experimentally found profile of the worn leading edge of the impeller blades. While the wear rate constant exhibits a monotonous dependence on the pitch angle only, the geometric parameter is dependent both on the pitch angle and in linear form on the impeller tip speed. Thus in the procedure for scaling up the rate of erosion wear of the pitched blade impellers in a suspension of higher solid particle hardness, the decision process parameters are the impeller blade pitch angle and the impeller tip speed. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — A grade {{crossing}} is a crossing of a railway {{line and a}} motor road. In 2009 alone there were 248 deaths and 682 injuries at {{grade crossing}}s in the United States. Factors like the elevation profile of a crossing or the environment and foliage around the crossing can render it unsafe. Often, vehicles with low ground <b>clearance</b> <b>bottom</b> out on a crossing with a humped elevation profile. Excessive foliage around the crossing can obstruct the visibility of an approaching train, reducing the time a driver has to stop. Hence ensuring safety requires regular monitoring and timely maintenance of grade crossings across the country. In this paper, we describe our method for automatically inspecting grade crossings. Our work employs principled machine learning methods to detect grade crossings from sensor data and then reconstructs the profile of that rail-road intersection. We then show how traffic simulation on the reconstructed profile {{can be used to}} determine whether the crossing is unsafe...|$|R

40|$|The {{influence}} of agitation on nucleation of butyl paraben and m-hydroxybenzoic acid polymorphs {{has been investigated}} through 330 cooling crystallization experiments. The induction time has been measured at different supersaturations and temperatures in three parallel jacketed vessels equipped with different overhead stirring agitators. In each case, the nucleating polymorph of m-hydroxybenzoic acid has been identified by infrared spectroscopy. The influences of agitation rate, impeller type, impeller diameter, impeller to <b>bottom</b> <b>clearance,</b> {{and the use of}} baffles have been investigated. A general trend in all of the experiments is that the induction time decreases with increasing agitation rate. Across all experiments with different fluid mechanics for the butyl paraben system, the induction time is correlated to the average energy dissipation rate raised to the power - 0. 3. It is shown that this dependence is consistent with a turbulent flow enhanced cluster coalescence mechanism. In experiments with m-hydroxybenzoic acid, the metastable form II was always obtained at higher nucleation driving force while both polymorphs were obtained at lower driving force.

This study deals with {{the investigation of the}} Dethridge wheel, which was originally meant for flow measurement purposes, for developing power from very low head sites in open channel flow. Two different approaches are taken to assess the potential of the Dethridge wheel for electricity generation. The first is the experimental approach with a physical model of the wheel built and tested in the laboratory environment. The second approach is the three dimensional numerical modelling of the Dethridge wheel using a commercial Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) code Flow- 3 D. The physical model tests show that at constant water levels the rotational speed of the wheel holds a linear relationship with torque as well as with flow rate. Using these linear regression models, full performance curves of the wheel are developed. Uncertainty analysis is carried out for all the measured data. The wheel housing, wheel to channel width ratio, blade numbers, channel transition shapes and the <b>bottom</b> <b>clearance</b> gap were experimentally investigated for their impact on the wheel performance. Original wheel housing is modified to allow side filling and emptying of the blade cells, which led to gain in efficiency. Performance of the wheel is observed to drop with increased number of blades. Wheel to channel width ratio plays vital role on the performance of the wheel. Two times wider channel is desired to allow for the side filling and emptying of the blade cells and thus improved efficiency. Effect of gradual transition is minimal on wheel performance suggesting no requirement of special channel transition profiles. <b>Bottom</b> <b>clearance</b> gap is identified to be important in controlling leakage losses and consequently wheel performance. A three dimensional CFD model of Dethridge wheel is developed. The Renormalization Group (RNG) model is employed for modelling the turbulence. The wheel motion is modelled using the General Moving Object (GMO) model. Numerical model results are assessed for numerical and model uncertainties. Effect of surface roughness, turbulence model, advection scheme, blade thickness and domain symmetry is studied and validated against the physical model results. A rigorous approach of numerical uncertainty analysis called Grid Convergence Index (GCI) method is employed. Impact of blade shape and shroud shape modification is investigated on the numerical model. Modification of both blade and shroud shape led to the improvement in performance of the wheel. The computed results are in good agreement with the measured results. The development of a CFD model enhances our understandings of the complex hydrodynamics of the wheel. The research findings has revealed that Dethridge wheel is a potential device for energy extraction from open channel flows. An efficiency of around 60...|$|E

Carbon and nitrogen ingestion rates of picoplankton by the different sponges ranged from 0. 17 mg C g dry wt 21 min 21 to 1. 5 mg C g dry wt 21 min 21 and 2 nmol N g dry wt 21 min 21 to 13 nmol N g dry wt 21 min 21. Although excretion compounds and rates varied between sponge species, most of the species exhibited the ability to excrete significant amounts of nitrate with nitrification rates of 3 – 13 nmol N g dry wt 21 min 21. Only one species (Dysidea avara) excreted {{a significant amount of}} ammonium. This is the first account of nitrification by temperate sponges. Particulate nitrogen ingestion and dissolved inorganic nitrogen excretion did not balance in most cases, suggesting that Mediterranean sponges may be using alternative sources of organic nitrogen. Sponge activity could have a relevant role in remineralization of organic nitrogen in oligotrophic marine coastal zones. Benthic-pelagic coupling includes processes working in both directions: (1) planktonic production providing organic matter that settles on the seabed and/or is consumed by benthic communities and (2) nutrient fluxes from the seabed fueling planktonic primary production (Nixon 1981; Asmus and Asmus 1991). Quantification of nutrient flow between plankton and benthos is critical to characterize coupling and to understand biogeochemical cycles in coastal zones. Shallow water conditions and high water motion in coastal zones accelerates the flow of nutrients between plankton and benthos, making the study of benthic trophodynamics (i. e., the flow of energy and materials) particularly relevant to understanding the bi-ological dynamics of coastal systems (e. g., Lopez et al...|$|R

The researches of squat have been developed particularly in western countries where many canal and river water ways are provided. There are many methods for predicting the squat. However, the prediction methods that are mainly proposed based on potential theory are complicated and not sufficient in accuracy.

40|$|The {{dispersion}} behaviour of cyclohexane (dispersed phase) {{into water}} (continuous phase) in a stirred unbaffled batch vessel is studied experimentally and with {{computational fluid dynamic}} (CFD) simulation. The important aspects and fundamentals in liquid-liquid systems including mass transfer are described. The dispersion and distribution of cyclohexane into water is visualized by a red colour tracer and registered with a video camera. Different types of stirrers are used such as anchor impeller (tangential flow), 3 -bladed propeller (axial flow), 4 -bladed pitched blade turbine PBT (combined flow) and 6 -bladed rushton turbine impeller RTI (radial flow). The minimum stirrer velocities for complete and uniform dispersion are determined by tracking the red layer of cyclohexane. The shape {{and size of the}} cyclohexane droplets are measured by using the particle vision microscope (PVM). The axial and radial profiles of cyclohexane volume fractions at different stirrer velocities are measured by using sampling withdrawal method. The minimum stirrer velocities are also determined from this method. Mass transfer of the solute (benzoic acid) from water to cyclohexane is used as an indirect method to calculate the volumetric mass transfer coefficient kcA between the two phases –from the measured transient concentrations of benzoic acid in water– by using the chemical acid-base titration method. The flow velocity fields produced by RTI and propeller impeller are measured by using photographic-light cut method with the help of tracer particles and MathCAD software. For the 3 D steady and transient CFD simulations (using ANSYS CFX- 11 and ICEM CFD- 11), the geometry and the unstructured mesh generation for the anchor and RTI as well as all used submodels, the initial and boundary conditions and also the solution algorithm, are described. The submodels are: Eulerian-Eulerian multi-fluid model, the k-ε turbulent model, algebraic slip (ASM) and Ishii-Zuber models, buoyancy model, the standard free surface flow model, particle model and the sliding mesh model. It is found many vortices and symmetric flow around the impellers. With anchor impeller, large axial vortex is formed in the water phase and large symmetrical vortex of cyclohexane is concentrated around the shaft of the anchor impeller. Whereas a radial flow with two circulations above and below the RTI is formed. The shape of the cyclohexane droplets is found to be spherical. Mean Sauter droplet diameter d 32 is ordered referring to the type of the impeller as d 32,RTI (409 µm) > d 32,anchor (388 µm) > d 32,propeller (376 µm) > d 32,PBT (343 µm), referring to the percentage volume of cyclohexane with RTI as d 32, 20 vol% (399 µm) > d 32, 10 vol% (348 µm) and referring to the RTI <b>bottom</b> <b>clearance</b> as d 32, 4. 1 cm (409 µm) > d 32, 3. 2 cm (399 µm). For better understanding, a droplet size distribution is also analyzed by the number frequency diagram. The anchor impeller gives a bi-modal distribution, whereas the other stirrers give a uni-modal one. The CFD predicted axial and radial profiles of cyclohexane volumetric fractions are in a good agreement with that measured from the sampling method. The ASM is able to predict the axial and radial profiles of cyclohexane volume fractions in case of the RTI, whereas Ishii-Zuber model is suitable in case of the anchor impeller. The grid size should not exceed 0. 001 m for good predictions. Increasing the <b>bottom</b> <b>clearance</b> of RTI reduces the minimum velocity for complete dispersion in the order of 5. 5 cm (400 rpm) (kcA) propeller > (kcA) PBT > (kcA) RTI. The propeller impeller gives the maximum volumetric mass transfer coefficient of 0. 00003 m 3 /s at a minimum velocity of 500 rpm, whereas the PBT impeller gives the same value at 600 rpm. The RTI gives the maximum value of 0. 00002 m 3 /s at velocity of 550 rpm. Increasing RTI <b>bottom</b> <b>clearance</b> enhances the mass transfer of benzoic acid for RTI velocities 450 rpm, but it has no significant effect on kc A. High mass transfer occurs when cyclohexane is completely dispersed and enhanced when a uniform dispersion is achieved. The surface renewal of the dispersed phase by diffusion and turbulence is responsible for mass transfer of the solute. Increasing the initial volume (percentage) of cyclohexane in case of anchor impeller increases kc A. The equilibrium concentrations are similar for all types of stirrers. The anchor impeller gives the minimum equilibrium time of 30 s at a minimum velocity of 350 rpm, whereas the RTI and PBT both reach the equilibrium concentration at the same equilibrium time of 300 s at velocities of 500 and 400 rpm, respectively. The RTI and propeller impeller reach the equilibrium concentration at the same velocity of 500 rpm but at different equilibrium times of 300 s and 60 s, respectively. The predicted radial flow velocities are higher than the axial one in case of the RTI, whereas the axial velocities are higher than the radial one in case of the anchor impeller. The turbulence is high near the impeller, minimum at the free surface and bottom of the vessel and intermediate between these locations. The CFD predicted turbulent flow velocity distributions are in agreement to that obtained by photographic light-cut method and with the cyclohexane volumetric fraction distribution from sampling and visualization methods...|$|E
40|$|The Interim Report of October, 1951, {{presented}} {{a survey of}} the surface barrier studies which had been conducted by the Hydraulic Structures Laboratory up to that date. The performance curves of a number of types of mobile breakwaters were examined, and the decision reached that the most satisfactory one, all factors considered, was the three-bulkhead structure. After investigating the effect of such parameters as freeboard height, <b>bottom</b> <b>clearance,</b> and bulkhead spacing on the overall behavior of the barrier, a scale model of a hypothetical prototype pontoon assembly was constructed which incorporated {{what appeared to be the}} most effective values of these parameters. Performance data of this so-called optimum breakwater was given in the October report. The present report continues where the previous one left off, with a more intensive consideration of certain features of barrier performance which have been but vaguely understood. Specifically, the values of the coefficient of transmission, defined as the ratio of transmitted wave height to incident wave height, were determined under various controlled wave conditions for the following bodies: (1) Fixed single bulkheads of different bottom clearances. (2) Fixed three-bulkhead barrier. (3) Floating three-bulkhead barrier with fixed baffle extending upward from the bottom. (4) Floating barrier with weighted mooring lines. (5) Floating barrier with increased virtual mass on the end bulkheads. (6) Floating barrier with hydrofoil added forward of first bulkhead. In general, these conditions imposed upon the barrier were artificial, and impractical, as far as direct application to a prototype structure is concerned. Some information was gained, however, by separating to a limited degree the various factors which influence energy transmission by the floating breakwater. Unless specified otherwise, the floating barrier referred to in this report is the optimum structure with three bulkheads spaced at 73 and 127 feet, high freeboard, and 15 -foot, 5 -foot and 15 -foot bottom clearances. The original performance curve of this body, obtained using soft springs in the mooring lines, is the second curve of Fig. 8 in the October report, and is used frequently as a convenient basis of comparison for the data obtained in the present series of tests...|$|E

Wastewater treatment plants are required to intensify wastewater digestion process using existing digester capacity by processing concentrated sludge, which affects digester mixing performance. There have been many studies on digester hydrodynamics, but digester mixing is still carried out based on empirical evidence rather than fluid mechanical studies. The main objective of this work {{is to determine the}} optimum mixing method/s for digesters using a hydrodynamic study. This involved a model liquid to represent sludge. Flow visualisation and electrical resistance tomography (ERT) are employed in this work. Also, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models are developed and validated using flow visualisation experimental data. All experiments were conducted in a 0. 19 m diameter cylindrical tank. Three mixing systems, namely mechanical mixing, liquid recirculation and gas sparging, were implemented. Xanthan gum Keltrol-T (XGKT) solution was selected as the model liquid because its rheological characteristics are similar to digester sludge. Specific power inputs ranging from 3. 5 to 10. 5 W/m 3 were employed. Dye tracer and brine solution were used as tracers in flow visualisation and electrical resistance tomography (ERT) techniques respectively. Inactive mixing volume was determined by measuring the volume of the coloured and low conductivity regions in flow visualisation and ERT experiments, respectively. Experimental results show that the total inactive volume in the model digester decreases with increasing mixing time and reaches a plateau. Larger inactive volume was found in solutions with higher apparent viscosity regardless of the mixing mode used. Increasing power input beyond a certain value was found to have no influence in the reduction of inactive volume in liquid recirculation and gas sparging. In case of mechanical mixing, a threshold power input is required to achieve an acceptable value of the active volume. Experiments with liquid recirculation and gas sparging systems were conducted with different nozzle orientations to study their effect on inactive volume reduction. Downward jet in liquid recirculation system produces the largest inactive volume, and upward and angled jets lead to smaller inactive volumes. In gas sparging system, the downward sparger with a low tank <b>bottom</b> <b>clearance</b> leads to the smallest inactive volume. Therefore, the position and orientation of fluid inlet nozzles are very important in the design and operation of digesters processing thicker sludge. ERT can be used to estimate the shape and size of the active mixing region. It provides information on the inactive volume reduction rate and the final dead volume up to a certain level of accuracy depending on the mixing system. However, the estimations require further investigations and improvements. Overall, ERT has the potential of being used in the study of inactive volume in real sludge. CFD models are developed only for mechanical mixing and liquid recirculation systems. The models estimate the flow patterns and the inactive volume fairly well. However, the CFD model for the mechanical mixing system could not predict the presence of a threshold power input) ...|$|E
