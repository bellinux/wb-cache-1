25|$|A {{number of}} {{subsidies}} were allocated to local authorities faced with acute areas of severe poverty (or other social problems).

A number of poor inner-city areas were subsequently granted EPA status (despite concerns that Local Education Authorities would be unable to finance Educational Priority Areas).
