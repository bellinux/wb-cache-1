25|$|During the Risorgimento (Italian unification) of the 19th century, many Piemontese {{winemaker}}s {{and land}} owners played a pivotal role.

Camillo Benso, conte di Cavour was a wealthy vineyard owner who went abroad to study advance viticulture prior to founding the political newspaper Il Risorgimento. He was highly influential in the adoption of many French viticultural techniques among the Piemontese vineyards.|$|E
25|$|The {{mid-19th century}} ushered {{an end to}} the industry's prosperity. First came the 1851 {{discovery}} of powdery mildew, which severely reduced production over the next three years. Just as the industry was recovering through the use of the copper-based <b>Bordeaux</b> <b>mixture</b> fungicide, the phylloxera epidemic that had plagued France and other European wine regions reached the island. By the end of the 19th century, most of the island's vineyards had been uprooted, and many were converted to sugar cane production. The majority of the vineyards that did replant chose to use American vine varieties, such as Vitis labrusca, Vitis riparia and Vitis rupestris or hybrid grape varieties rather than replant with the Vitis vinifera varieties that were previously grown.|$|E

2500|$|Organic {{compounds}} used as fining {{agents are}} generally animal based, a possible cause {{of concern to}} vegans. The most common organic compounds used include egg whites, casein derived from milk, gelatin and isinglass obtained from the bladders of fish. Pulverized minerals and solid materials can also be used, with bentonite clay {{being one of the}} most common, thanks to its effectiveness in absorbing proteins and some bacteria. Activated carbon from charcoal is used to remove some phenols that contribute to browning as well as some particles that produce [...] "off-odors" [...] in the wine. In a process known as blue fining, potassium ferrocyanide is sometimes used to remove any copper and iron particles that have entered the wine from bentonite, metal winery and vineyard equipment, or vineyard sprays such as <b>Bordeaux</b> <b>mixture.</b> Because potassium ferrocyanide may form hydrogen cyanide its use is highly regulated and, in many wine producing countries, illegal. Silica and kaolin are also sometimes used.|$|E

50|$|Similar to the <b>Bordeaux</b> <b>mixture,</b> {{one of the}} {{earliest}} fungicides in use, Burgundy mixture, also known as “sal soda Bordeaux”, is used as a fungus preventative applicant on plants before fungi have appeared. <b>Bordeaux</b> <b>mixture</b> contains copper(II) sulfate, CuSO4, and hydrated lime, Ca(OH)2, while Burgundy mixture contains copper sulphate, CuSO4, and sodium carbonate, Na2CO3. First used around 1885, Burgundy mixture has since been replaced by synthetic organic compounds, or by compounds that contain copper in a non-reactive, chelated form. This helps to prevent the accumulation of high levels of copper in sediments surrounding the plants.|$|E

50|$|Synthetic {{pesticides}} {{allowed for}} use on organic farms include insecticidal soaps and horticultural oils for insect management; and <b>Bordeaux</b> <b>mixture,</b> copper hydroxide and sodium bicarbonate for managing fungi. Copper sulfate and <b>Bordeaux</b> <b>mixture</b> (copper sulfate plus lime), approved for organic use in various jurisdictions, can be more environmentally problematic than some synthetic fungicides dissallowed in organic farming Similar concerns apply to copper hydroxide. Repeated application of copper sulfate or copper hydroxide as a fungicide may eventually result in copper accumulation to toxic levels in soil, and admonitions to avoid excessive accumulations of copper in soil appear in various organic standards and elsewhere. Environmental concerns for several kinds of biota arise at average rates of use of such substances for some crops. In the European Union, where replacement of copper-based fungicides in organic agriculture is a policy priority, research is seeking alternatives for organic production.|$|E
5000|$|Copper sulfate {{pentahydrate}} is a fungicide. However, some fungi {{are capable}} of adapting to elevated levels of copper ions. [...] By mixing a water solution of copper sulfate and a suspension of slaked lime one obtains the <b>Bordeaux</b> <b>mixture,</b> a suspension of copper(II) hydroxide Cu(OH)2 and calcium sulfate, {{which is used to}} control fungus on grapes, melons, and other berries.|$|E
50|$|The {{history of}} downy mildew control {{began with an}} {{accidental}} discovery in 1882. In order to prevent passersby from eating the grapevines close to the road, Pierre-Marie-Alexis Millardet sprayed those vines {{with a mixture of}} copper sulfate and lime, which was both seeable and awful-tasting. He then noticed that the treated grapevines did not show any symptoms of downy mildew, whereas the rest of the vineyard was infected by the disease. After further studies, Millardet published the recommended treatment of the grapevines against the downy mildew in 1885 in which he proposed the use of 8:15:100 of copper sulfate: hydrated lime: water mixture in the treatment (later named as <b>Bordeaux</b> <b>mixture</b> after the Bordeaux region where Millardet conducted the research). The treatment of <b>Bordeaux</b> <b>mixture</b> against the downy mildew was well-received globally due to its strong adhesion to the leaves, its long perseverance in the vineyard, and its color, which allows for observable distribution of the treatment.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are many}} {{fungicides}} which control Cercospora melongenae including Oils with no added pesticides, and some with.

Carefully read labels, and laws regarding application regiments and practices.|$|E
50|$|Contact {{fungicides}} not {{prone to}} resistance, such as Captan, are viable choices. Potassium bicarbonate {{is an effective}} fungicide against apple scab, as well as powdery mildew, and is allowed for use in organic farming. Copper and <b>Bordeaux</b> <b>mixture</b> are traditional controls but are less effective than chemical fungicides, and can cause russeting of the fruit. Wettable sulfur also provides some control. Timing of application and concentration varies between compounds.|$|E
50|$|Most {{diseases}} {{come from}} the uncharacteristic growing conditions of vanilla. Therefore, conditions such as excess water, insufficient drainage, heavy mulch, overpollination, and too much shade favor disease development. Vanilla is susceptible to many fungal and viral diseases. Fusarium, Sclerotium, Phytophthora, and Colletrotrichum species cause rots of root, stem, leaf, bean, and shoot apex. These diseases can be controlled by spraying <b>Bordeaux</b> <b>mixture</b> (1%), carbendazim (0.2%) and copper oxychloride (0.2%).|$|E

5000|$|The {{conventional}} {{method of}} describing the mixture's composition {{is to give}} the weight of CuSO4, the weight of hydrated lime and the volume of water, in that order. The percentage of the weight of CuSO4 to the weight of water employed determines the concentration of the mixture. Thus a 1% <b>Bordeaux</b> <b>mixture,</b> which is typical, would have the formula 1:1:100, with the first [...] "1" [...] representing 1 kg CuSO4 (pentahydrated), the second representing 1 kg hydrated lime, and the 100 representing 100 litres (100 kg) water. As CuSO4 contains 25% copper, the copper content of a 1% <b>Bordeaux</b> <b>mixture</b> would be 0.25%. The quantity of lime used can be lower than that of the CuSO4. One kg of CuSO4 actually requires only 0.225 kg of chemically pure hydrated lime to precipitate all the copper. Good proprietary brands of hydrated lime are now freely available, but, as even these deteriorate on storage (by absorbing carbon dioxide from the air), a ratio of less than 2:1 is seldom used, which corresponds to a 1:0.5:100 mixture.|$|E
50|$|Ives noir is a mid-ripening {{variety that}} usually ripens before Concord. The vine is very {{sensitive}} to air pollution, ozone damage as well as sulphur-based sprays (such as the <b>Bordeaux</b> <b>mixture</b> used to combat powdery and downy mildew). When not grafted to more vigorous rootstock, Ives noir tend to produce a shallow and weak root system that also makes the vine very susceptible to water stress which may require irrigation in drought conditions.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bordeaux</b> <b>mixture</b> (also called Bordo Mix) is {{a mixture}} of copper(II) sulfate (CuSO4) and slaked lime (Ca(OH)2) used as a fungicide. It is used in vineyards, fruit-farms and gardens to prevent infestations of downy mildew, powdery mildew and other fungi. It is sprayed on plants as a preventative; its mode of action is {{ineffective}} after a fungus has become established. It was invented in the Bordeaux region of France in the late 19th century. If it is applied in large quantities annually for many years, the copper in the mixture eventually becomes a pollutant.|$|E
50|$|Cold and wet climates favor this disease, {{which is}} why it is often found in the coastal {{vineyards}} of California and New York. In the eastern vineyards this disease is estimated to infect 30% of grapes while in California it can infect up to half. This can reduce yields by 40-60%. Much like black rot, bunch rot overwinters in the berries and infects the next season's crop through spore ejections in the summer. Originally <b>Bordeaux</b> <b>mixture</b> was used to controlled botrytis bunch rot but the use of synthetic chemicals is now the preferred method.|$|E
5000|$|Because {{blackberries}} {{belong to}} the same genus as raspberries, they share the same diseases including anthracnose which can cause the berry to have uneven ripening and sap flow may also be slowed. They also share the same remedies including the <b>Bordeaux</b> <b>mixture,</b> a combination of lime, water and copper(II) sulfate. The rows between blackberry plants must be free of weeds, blackberry suckers and grasses which may lead to pests or diseases. Fruit growers are selective when planting blackberry bushes as wild blackberries may be infected and gardeners are recommended to purchase only certified disease-free plants.|$|E
5000|$|Yellow sigatoka derives {{its name}} from the Sigatoka valley in Fiji. This was where the disease was first {{documented}} in 1912.

It was first seen in Trinidad in 1934 and quickly spread to the mainland and up through Central America [...] The disease can spread spores over 1,000 miles with wind currents. By 1936 experiments with <b>Bordeaux</b> <b>mixture</b> were developed to control the disease. The disease was first discovered in Hawaii in 1958.|$|E
50|$|Burgundy {{mixture is}} used as a {{preemptive}} fungicide prevention for trees and small fruits. This occurs because the Cu(II) ions are capable of interfering with enzymes found within the spores of many fungi, preventing germination from occurring. Unfortunately, the mechanism for copper antifungal properties is not well understood, though it is thought that interactions between the copper and negatively charged portions of the cellular membranes of the fungi promote an altered shape and increased membrane permeability, which alters the homeostasis of the cell and can lead to insufficient uptake and storage of essential nutrients and ions.Use <b>Bordeaux</b> <b>mixture</b> than this it is effective.|$|E
