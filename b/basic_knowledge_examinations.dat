We compared four methods of weighting multiple-choice items of the <b>Basic</b> Skills and <b>Knowledge</b> <b>Examination</b> (EXHCOBA) : (1) punishing incorrect responses by a constant factor, (2) weighting incorrect responses, considering the levels of error, (3) weighting correct responses, considering the item’s difficulty, based on the Classic Measurement Theory, and (4) weighting correct responses, considering the item’s difficulty, based on the Item Response Theory. Results show {{that none of these}} methods increased the instrument’s predictive validity, although they did improve its concurrent validity. It was concluded that it is appropriate to score the test by simply adding up correct responses...|$|R

40|$|Aim of {{this study}} is {{designing}} a method for automatic gamelan music composition using rule-base expert system approach. The program is designed for non-expert user in order to help them composing gamelan music or analyzing their composition to achieve explanation and recommendation of ideal composition. There are 2 essential components in this method, which are knowledge and inference. Knowledge is represented into <b>basic</b> <b>knowledge</b> and melodic <b>knowledge.</b> <b>Basic</b> <b>knowledge</b> contains rules that control the structure of gamelan song, and melodic knowledge supports system in composing or analyzing notations sequence that fit the characteristics of melody in gamelan music. <b>Basic</b> <b>knowledge</b> represents <b>basic</b> rules of gamelan music that have quantitative value, so deterministic approach is used for <b>basic</b> <b>knowledge</b> acquisition. Melodic knowledge consists of dynamic data, so stochastic approach is used to create the melodic knowledge base. The rules of composing and analyzing a composition are defined based on <b>basic</b> <b>knowledge</b> and melodic knowledge. The inference engine is designed to compose and analyze a composition. Automatic composition for gamelan music is proposed using Generate and Test method (GAT) with random technique, and composition analysis is proposed using backward chaining metho...|$|R
