5|$|Culbreth has umpired in five Division Series, six League Championship Series, two World Series and one All-Star Game, {{as well as}} the National League's single-game playoff in 2007. He was one of {{the umpires}} when a Tampa Bay Rays pitcher threw a no-hitter {{for the first time in}} team history, and he was <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>plate</b> when the New York Mets {{achieved}} the same distinction. Prior to the 2013 Major League Baseball season, Culbreth, Ted Barrett and Jim Joyce became crew chiefs after the retirements of Ed Rapuano, Tim Tschida and Derryl Cousins.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, West {{made his}} first World Series {{appearance}} when the Atlanta Braves faced the Toronto Blue Jays. West was <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>plate</b> in the first World Series game played in Canada and ejected Braves manager Bobby Cox for throwing a helmet onto the field. In 1993, he appeared in the NLCS. He worked another no-hitter on April 8, 1994, when Kent Mercker shut down the Los Angeles Dodgers. The 1995 NLDS was West’s first League Division Series. The following year West worked in the NLCS. He returned to the World Series in 1997, when the Cleveland Indians faced the Florida Marlins.|$|E
5|$|In the 2008 World Series, which {{featured}} the Philadelphia Phillies and Tampa Bay Rays, Culbreth worked behind home plate for Game 3. The Phillies claimed a 5–4 victory {{due to a}} walk–off single by Carlos Ruiz. Philadelphia won the Series in five games. In Game 3 of the 2012 World Series, Culbreth umpired <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>plate</b> for the matchup between the Detroit Tigers and the San Francisco Giants. The Giants shut out the Tigers, 2–0. San Francisco won the World Series in the next game.|$|E
40|$|Direct {{numerical}} {{simulations of}} turbulent viscoelastic fluid flows in a channel with wall-mounted plates {{were performed to}} investigate the influence of viscoelasticity on turbulent structures and the mean flow around <b>the</b> <b>plate.</b> <b>The</b> constitutive equation follows the Giesekus model, valid for polymer or surfactant solutions, which are generally capable of reducing the turbulent frictional drag in a smooth channel. We found that turbulent eddies just <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>plates</b> in viscoelastic fluid decreased in number and in magnitude, but their size increased. Three pairs of organized longitudinal vortices were observed downstream of <b>the</b> <b>plates</b> in both Newtonian and viscoelastic fluids: two vortex pairs were <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>plates</b> and <b>the</b> other one with the longest length was in a plate-free area. In the viscoelastic fluid, the latter vortex pair in the plate-free area was maintained and reached the downstream rib, but its swirling strength was weakened and the local skin-friction drag near the vortex was much weaker {{than those in the}} Newtonian flow. The mean flow and small spanwise eddies were influenced by the additional fluid force due to the viscoelasticity and, moreover, the spanwise component of the fluid elastic force may also {{play a role in the}} suppression of fluid vortical motions <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>plates...</b>|$|R

5|$|During {{his time}} at Michigan, Walker was paid by the White Sewing Machine Company of Cleveland to play for their semi-professional ball club in August 1881. Walker's {{presence}} was controversial when the team arrived for a game in Louisville, Kentucky, {{the first place to}} have a major issue with his race. As the team arrived in the early morning of the game, Walker was turned away from the Saint Cloud Hotel. More issues arose during game time: members of the Louisville Eclipse protested Walker's participation; Cleveland relented and held him out of the lineup. After one inning, his substitute claimed his hands were too badly bruised to continue, and Walker hesitantly walked on to the field for warm-ups. Louisville again protested and refused to resume play until Cleveland's third baseman volunteered to go <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>plate.</b>|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of each half-inning, the nine players on the fielding team arrange themselves around the field. One of them, the pitcher, stands on the pitcher's mound. The pitcher begins the pitching delivery with one foot on the rubber, pushing off it to gain velocity when throwing toward home plate. Another player, the catcher, squats {{on the far side of}} home plate, facing the pitcher. The rest of the team faces home plate, typically arranged as four infielders—who set up along or within a few yards outside the imaginary lines (basepaths) between first, second, and third base—and three outfielders. In the standard arrangement, there is a first baseman positioned several steps to the left of first base, a second baseman to the right of second base, a shortstop to the left of second base, and a third baseman to the right of third base. The basic outfield positions are left fielder, center fielder, and right fielder. With the exception of the catcher, all fielders are required to be in fair territory when the pitch is delivered. A neutral umpire sets up behind the catcher. Other umpires will be distributed around the field as well, though the number will vary depending on the level of play; amateur or children's games may only have an umpire <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>plate,</b> while as many as six umpires can be used for important major league games.|$|E

25|$|The six umpires {{working the}} 79th All-Star game were {{announced}} on June 25. The crew {{was led by}} Derryl Cousins, a thirty-year MLB veteran working his third All-Star game and his first <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>plate.</b>|$|E
25|$|Two years later, he was <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>plate</b> for the All-Star Game, and he {{was again}} named crew chief for the 1988 ALCS, 1991 World Series, and 1992 ALCS. He {{is one of only}} four umpires to have been {{selected}} as crew chief for the ALCS three times.|$|E
25|$|On May 2, 2008, Martin {{started his}} first game at third base since {{reaching}} the Majors, allowing veteran backup Gary Bennett to spell Martin <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>plate.</b> Martin made his second all-star game during the 2008 season. He caught 10 innings of a 15 inning game in which the American League won 4 to 3. Martin's 10 innings caught are tied for fourth place all time among all star catchers in a single game.|$|E

40|$|The present paper {{describes}} the mean-flow patterns, distributions {{of the mean}} velocity and turbulence intensity in <b>the</b> wake <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> normal <b>plates</b> immersed in a smooth-wall turbulent boundary layer with zero-pressure gradient. The effect of a parameter h/δon the mean-flow patterns and distributions of the mean velocity in the wake is examined in some detail, where h and δ are respectively the height of <b>the</b> normal <b>plate</b> and <b>the</b> boundary layer thickness. The main results will be summarized as follows : (a) The geometrical shape of the rear standing eddy and the reattachment point of the separated flow are not very much influenced by the parameter h/δ. (b) The mean velocity profiles in the rear separation eddy are closely approximated by the velocity profile in a constant pressure half-jet theoretically obtained by Goertler.

25|$|Before {{playing at}} catcher for Northwestern High School, his two brothers, Nuel and Charles played <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>plate</b> for the team, {{starting}} {{a streak of}} nine years of Landriths playing at catcher for the school. Nuel played {{in the minor leagues}} for the 1942 and 1946 seasons for the Lamesa Dodgers and Quincy Gems, and Charles also contributed two years in the minor league system, playing from 1948 to 1949 for the Pine Bluff Cardinals and Ogdensburg Maples.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of his retirement, Fisk held the record for most home runs all-time by a catcher with 351 (since surpassed by Mike Piazza). He has held several age- or longevity-related records, {{including}} the record for most games played at the position of catcher with 2,226 (later surpassed by Iván Rodríguez). Fisk still holds the American League record for most years served <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>plate</b> (24). Fisk was voted to the All-Star team 11 times and won three Silver Slugger Awards which is awarded annually to the best offensive player at each position.|$|E
25|$|Throughout spring training, Landrith {{competed with}} Harry Chiti for the {{starting}} role at catcher for the Cubs. Chiti carried the load behind the backstop for Chicago in 1955, playing in 113 games with 11 {{home runs and}} 41 RBI. By coincidence, both Landrith and Chiti played as catchers for exactly the same high school, Northwestern High School in Detroit, Michigan. Landrith was the third brother of three to recently catch for Northwestern High, and as Landrith graduated and briefly went to Michigan State before being signed by the Cincinnati Reds, his high school successor was Harry Chiti. Chiti broke a nine-year streak of a Landrith catching <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>plate</b> for the school.|$|E

Varitek caught his 1000th game on July 31 and by {{the evening of the}} ceremony had appeared in 1,009 games <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>plate.</b> That same night, Varitek also received the 2006 Red Sox Heart and Hustle Award from the local chapter of the Major League Baseball Players Alumni Association, which is presented to a player exemplifying the values, tradition, and spirit of the game of baseball.|$|E
25|$|NBC television's {{relationship}} with Major League Baseball technically {{dates back to}} August 26, 1939. It was on that particular date that on W2XBS (an experimental television station in New York City which would ultimately become NBC's flagship station, WNBC), the first-ever Major League Baseball game was televised. With Red Barber announcing, the Brooklyn Dodgers and the Cincinnati Reds played a doubleheader at Ebbets Field. The Reds won the first game 5–2 while the Dodgers won the second, 6–1. Barber called the game {{without the benefit of}} a monitor and with only two cameras capturing the game. One camera was on Barber and the other was <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>plate.</b> Barber had to guess from which light was on and where it pointed.|$|E
25|$|Landrith {{played at}} {{catcher in the}} New York Mets very first regular season game on April 11, 1962 against the St. Louis Cardinals, batting 8th in the order and going 0 for 4 in an 11-4 loss. The Cardinals stole three bases with Landrith <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>plate.</b> Centerfielder Curt Flood stole two bases and second baseman Julián Javier also stole a base. Landrith was also charged with an error, one of three Mets errors on the day. Stengel gave up on Landrith after one game, giving the {{starting}} job to Joe Ginsberg. After Ginsberg had an 0 for 4 day in the Mets' second game, he then gave the job to Cannizaro. A round robin of catchers played for the Mets that season. 7 different catchers were used, with none playing in more than 70 games.|$|E

25|$|Landrith {{was traded}} to the San Francisco Giants along with {{teammates}} Billy Muffett and Benny Valenzuela for Ernie Broglio and Marv Grissom on October 8, 1958. Landrith was originally considered to be a throw-in player for this five player deal. The Giants announced in late February they would only be keeping two catchers on the roster. Bob Schmidt already had a foothold on the starting job, so the battle for Schmidt's backup came down to Landrith and Albert Stieglitz. Stieglitz was optioned to the AAA Phoenix Giants at the beginning of April, removing all doubt that Landrith would serve as Schmidt's backup to begin the 1959 season. For the first two months, Schmidt pulled most of the duty <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>plate</b> for the Giants. However, in June Landrith began to get more starts, and before the month was out Hobie had become the Giants new number 1 catcher.|$|E
25|$|Having been {{displaced}} by Al Spohrer as the Braves' starting catcher {{early in the}} 1929 season, Taylor's contract was sold to the Chicago Cubs for the waiver price of $7,500 in July after all the other teams in both the American and National Leagues had passed on him. When the Cubs' future Hall of Fame catcher Gabby Hartnett suffered an arm injury early in 1929, Taylor filled in capably, helping the Cubs win the National League pennant. He helped guide the Cubs' pitching staff to a league-leading 14 shutouts and finish second in team earned run average and strikeouts. In the only postseason appearance {{of his career in}} the 1929 World Series against the Philadelphia Athletics, Taylor made only three hits but was cited as an unsung hero in a losing cause for the Cubs because of his consistent, unwavering defensive skills <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>plate.</b> When Hartnett returned from his injury in 1930, Taylor went back to being the Cubs' backup catcher. In 1932, Cub manager Rogers Hornsby credited Taylor with helping develop the skills of Lon Warneke, as the young pitcher led the league with 22 wins.|$|E
25|$|A catcher {{nearly always}} throws {{with his right}} hand. Since most hitters are {{right-handed}} and stand {{to the left side}} of the plate when batting, a catcher who throws left-handed is forced to take some time to sidestep (or otherwise avoid) the right-handed hitter when he throws from <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>plate.</b> In addition, a lefty's throw would tend to come in on the shortstop side of the bag, while a righty's throw would be on the second base side of the bag, which is where the runner is coming in. Consequently, players who are left-handed rarely play catcher. Left-handed catchers have only caught eleven big-league games since 1902, and Jack Clements, who played for 17 years at the end of the nineteenth century, is the only man in the history of baseball to play more than three hundred games as a left-handed catcher. However, some observers, including the famed statistician Bill James and ESPN writer Rob Neyer, have suggested that the real reason that there are no left-handed catchers is because left-handed players with strong throwing arms are almost always encouraged, at an early age, to become pitchers. Benny Distefano, the last lefty thrower to catch a big-league game (in 1989), noted that lefty catchers have difficulty on bunts up the third base line and on fielding throws home for plays at the plate.|$|E
