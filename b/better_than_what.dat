25|$|The {{origins of}} My Own Private Idaho came from John Rechy's 1963 novel, City of Night, which {{featured}} characters who were street hustlers {{who did not}} admit to being gay. Van Sant's original screenplay {{was written in the}} 1970s, when he was living in Hollywood. After reading Rechy's book, Van Sant realized that it was considerably <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>what</b> he was writing, so he shelved the script for years. In 1988, while editing Mala Noche, Van Sant met a street kid named Michael Parker who became a source of inspiration for the character of Mike in what would later become My Own Private Idaho. Parker also had a friend named Scott, a street kid like himself. In the script, Van Sant adapted the Scott character to that of a rich kid. The character of Scott was also fashioned after people Van Sant had met in Portland who were street hustlers.|$|E
25|$|Another {{explanation}} {{given for}} the re-use is the short time between the start of construction (late 312 at the earliest) and the dedication (summer 315), so the architects used existing artwork {{to make up for}} the lack of time to create new art. It could be that so many old parts were used because the builders themselves did notfeelthe artists of their time could do <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>what</b> had already been done by different people. As yet another possible reason, it has often been suggested that the Romans of the 4th century truly did lack the artistic skill to produce acceptable artwork, and were aware of it, and therefore plundered the ancient buildings to adorn their contemporary monuments. This interpretation has become less prominent in more recent times, as the art of Late Antiquity has been appreciated in its own right. It is possible that a combination of those explanations is correct.|$|E

The series is described as being similar to the anime television adaptation of Air, saying [...] "Like Air, the first four episodes can be simply summarized as 'male lead arrives in town and kills time interacting with cute girls.' Unlike Air, however, these interactions can occasionally be very funny."

These are put together at company retreats, which the studio holds every [...] "18 months or so" [...] to plan out and develop the phases of the MCU.

[...] Duvall, who was presented with the Oscar by country music star Dolly Parton, said of winning the award, [...] "It was a nice feeling, knowing I was the home-crowd favorite." [...] In a New York Times profile of Duvall that appeared six years after Tender Mercies release, Nan C. Robertson wrote that despite four previous Academy Award nominations, [...] "it was not until he won as Best Actor in 1983 ... that moviegoers woke up in droves to this great natural resource. The reason was that they rarely recognized Mr. Duvall from one part to another, so effortlessly did he vanish into each celluloid persona." [...] Foote, who was so certain he would not win the Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar for To Kill a Mockingbird he had not attended the 1963 ceremony, made sure he was present to collect his award for Best Original Screenplay. The critical success of the film allowed Foote to exercise considerable control over his future film projects, including final veto power over major decisions; when such power was denied, Foote would simply refuse to do the film.|$|E
