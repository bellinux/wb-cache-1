40|$|The {{present study}} was a {{replication}} of the research of Reason et al. (1990). Its aim was to confirm the distinction between driving errors and violations in a Western Australian driving population. Sixty-one male drivers and 74 female drivers completed a questionnaire containing items on driver demographics, driving penalties incurred, driving convictions and accident history and driver <b>behavioural</b> <b>aberrations</b> drawn from the Driver Behaviour Questionnaire (DBQ). In agreement with Reason et al. factor analysis revealed three factors; {{in the present study}} these were general errors, dangerous errors, and dangerous violations. Young drivers committed more dangerous errors and dangerous violations than older drivers. Females reported more dangerous errors than males. Males reported more dangerous violations than females. Drivers who reported a high level of road exposure and those who reported having been convicted for speeding reported more dangerous violations. Differences in the results of the two studies can largely by accounted for by differences in the representation of age and gender in the two populations studied...|$|R
40|$|Behavioural and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD) are a core {{symptom of}} {{dementia}} and {{are associated with}} suffering, earlier institutionalization and accelerated cognitive decline for patients and increased caregiver burden. Despite the extremely high risk for Down syndrome (DS) individuals to develop dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD), BPSD have not been comprehensively assessed in the DS population. Due to the great variety of DS cohorts, diagnostic methodologies, sub-optimal scales, covariates and outcome measures, it is questionable whether BPSD have always been accurately assessed. However, accurate recognition of BPSD may increase awareness and understanding of these <b>behavioural</b> <b>aberrations,</b> thus enabling adaptive caregiving and, importantly, allowing for therapeutic interventions. Particular BPSD can be observed (long) before the clinical dementia diagnosis and could therefore serve as early indicators of those at risk, and provide a new, non-invasive way to monitor, or at least give an indication of, the complex progression to dementia in DS. Therefore, this review summarizes and evaluates the rather limited knowledge on BPSD in DS and highlights its importance and potential for daily clinical practice. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|A novel {{missense}} mutation in the mediator of RNA polymerase II transcription subunit 12 (MED 12) gene {{has been found}} in the original family with Lujan syndrome and in a second family (K 9359) that was initially considered to have Opitz–Kaveggia (FG) syndrome. A different {{missense mutation}} in the MED 12 gene has been reported previously in the original family with FG syndrome and in five other families with compatible clinical findings. Neither sequence alteration {{has been found in}} over 1400 control X chromosomes. Lujan (Lujan–Fryns) syndrome is characterised by tall stature with asthenic habitus, macrocephaly, a tall narrow face, maxillary hypoplasia, a high narrow palate with dental crowding, a small or receding chin, long hands with hyperextensible digits, hypernasal speech, hypotonia, mild‐to‐moderate mental retardation, <b>behavioural</b> <b>aberrations</b> and dysgenesis of the corpus callosum. Although Lujan syndrome has not been previously considered to be in the differential diagnosis of FG syndrome, there are some overlapping clinical manifestations. Specifically, these are dysgenesis of the corpus callosum, macrocephaly/relative macrocephaly, a tall forehead, hypotonia, mental retardation and behavioural disturbances. Thus, it seems that these two X‐linked mental retardation syndromes are allelic, with mutations in the MED 12 gene...|$|R
40|$|Oxidative {{stress is}} a {{critical}} route of damage in various psychological stress-induced disorders, such as depression. Antidepressants are widely prescribed to treat these conditions; however, few animal studies have investigated {{the effect of these}} drugs on endogenous antioxidant status in the brain. The present study employed a 3 weeks chronic regimen of random exposure to chronic mild stress (CMS) to induce oxidative stress in brain, and <b>behavioural</b> <b>aberrations</b> (anhedonia), in rats. The sucrose preference test was used to identify depression-like phenotypes, and reversal in these indices indicated the effectiveness of treatment with escitalopram 2. 5 mg/kg daily orally following CMS. The level of superoxide dismutase enzyme(SOD) as an antioxidant markers in erythrocyte lysates was reduced in CMS control group while it was elevated in CMS group treated with escitalopram. Also escitalopram significantly reduce the thiobarbituric acid reactive substance(TBARS) levels in selected brain areas homogenates to a level comparable to control group. Catalase activity and GABA levels in these brain areas were also increase in escitlopram treated group. In conclusion, escitalopram is suggested to have antioxidant effect associated with an increase in GABA level in frontal cortices and nucleus accumbens homogenates from rats exposed to CMS...|$|R
50|$|Panayiotopoulos {{syndrome}} is remarkably benign {{in terms of}} its evolution. The risk of developing epilepsy in adult life is probably no more than of the general population. Most patients have one or 2-5 seizures. Only a third of patients may have more than 5 seizures, and these may be frequent, but outcome is again favorable. However, one fifth of patients may develop other types of infrequent, usually rolandic seizures during childhood and early teens. These are also age-related and remit before the age of 16 years. Atypical evolutions with absences and drop attacks are exceptional. Children with pre-existing neurobehavioral disorders tend to be pharmacoresistant and have frequent seizures though these also remit with age.Formal neuropsychological assessment of children with Panayiotopoulos syndrome showed that these children have normal IQ and they are not on any significant risk of developing cognitive and <b>behavioural</b> <b>aberrations,</b> which when they occur they are usually mild and reversible. Prognosis of cognitive function is good even for patients with atypical evolutions.However, though Panayiotopoulos {{syndrome is}} benign {{in terms of its}} evolution, autonomic seizures are potentially life-threatening in the rare context of cardiorespiratory arrest.|$|R

40|$|The {{grounding}} of the MV Rena on Otaiti {{resulted in}} the release of heavy fuel oil and container debris contaminants into the surrounding environments including the rocky shores of the adjacent Mōtītī Island. This is the habitat where significant populations of benthic paua reside. Paua (Haliotis iris) are a staple and consistent food source for Mōtītī Island. Being an offshore island with no amenities, Mōtītī Island residents are reliant on the ocean as a pataka kai (food cupboard) and are therefore acutely aware of environmental influences to the harvest of kaimoana. This thesis aimed to address concerns relating {{to the effects of}} contaminated boundary layer water emanating from contaminated ‘Rena’ sediment on juvenile paua. Research was focused in two areas: 1) the sublethal behavioural effects of contaminated Rena sediment to Paua and 2) the accumulation of trace metals in the edible tissue and viscera mass. The experiments were carried out {{with the use of a}} close circuit aquaria in a laboratory environment, followed by a field experiment. In all experiments, paua in control treatments were healthy by comparison to paua exposed to treatments with Rena contaminated sediments and copper as judged by survivorship and behaviour. The most likely cause of of <b>behavioural</b> <b>aberrations</b> and mortality observed was deemed to be copper as demonstrated by Diffusive Gradient in thin film (DGT) and ambient water analyses in both experiments. Copper that is bioavailable can increase quickly in the edible tissue and viscera mass as was identified as the visceral mass of Rena and copper exposed paua had a higher mean concentration of this and other trace metals. On Otaiti, the effects to paua from the Rena ship wreck and lost container contents, know to include a medly of metals and other contaminants, is not likely to be limited to copper alone. Results demosntrate the relevance of examining the effects of water borne contaminated plumes emanating from complex mixtures of contaminants. This is rarely done in ecotoxicological studies which tend to focus on individual contaminant compounds...|$|R
40|$|During {{a finite}} {{developmental}} phase – the brain growth spurt – the brain grows and matures at an accelerated rate. During this period {{the brain is}} more sensitive to harmful substances such as ethanol and environmental toxins than before or after. This period extends from the last trimester to {{the second year in}} humans and occurs postnatally in the mice used for these studies. The aims of this thesis were; to investigate common anaesthetics ability to promote acute apoptosis and late persistant <b>behavioural</b> <b>aberrations</b> measured with spontaneous behaviour in a novel home environment, learning in a radial arm maze and anxiety-like behaviour in an elevated plus maze, to measure alterations in BDNF, CaMKII, GAP- 43, synaptophysin and tau after anaesthesia exposure, to evaluate clonidine as a potentially protecting agent and examine if theophylline, a chemically unrelated compound, causes similar effects as anaesthetics. Some of the results are: combinations of anaesthetics acting on the GABAA receptor (propofol or pentothal) and NMDA receptor (ketamine) exhibit more apoptosis and behavioural alterations than single anaesthetics. Ketamine, but not propofol, alters the content of CaMKII and GAP- 43 proteins important in brain development. Propofol exposure alters the content of BDNF (brain derived neurotrophic factor) in hippocampus, frontal and parietal cortex. Neonatal propofol exposure leads to less sensitiveness to diazepam in adult age as measured with induced spontaneous behaviour and an elevated plus maze. Clonidine, an alpha 2 adrenergic agonist does not cause any aberrations and appears to prevent apoptosis and behavioural alterations after ketamine. Theophylline, used as apnoea treatment in neonates, also increases apoptosis and alters normal behaviour. Thus, alterations both in neuronal survival, function and protein expression is apparent after neonatal exposure to anaesthetics. This is also shown in studies of Rhesus monkeys. However, it is still difficult to assess how these findings should extrapolate to humans. Epidemiological studies give conflicting results. Insufficient anaesthesia is not a solution as pain and stress cause even more pronounced problems. Minimizing anaesthetic exposure, delaying procedures until after the sensitive phase and finding protective agents, such as clonidine, are possible strategies. Evaluation of other substances that infants are exposed to is needed...|$|R
