50|$|Later, Burroughs {{was selling}} more than adding machines, {{including}} typewriters. But the biggest shift in company history came in 1953: the Burroughs Adding Machine Company was renamed the Burroughs Corporation and began moving into computer products, initially for banking institutions. This move began with Burroughs' purchase, in June 1956, of the ElectroData Corporation in Pasadena, California, a spinoff of the Consolidated Engineering Corporation which had designed test instruments {{and had a}} cooperative relationship with Caltech in Pasadena. ElectroData had built the Datatron 205 and {{was working on the}} Datatron 220. The first major computer product that came from this marriage was the B205 tube computer. In the late 1960s the L and TC series range was produced (e.g. the TC500â€”Terminal Computer 500) which had a golf <b>ball</b> <b>printer</b> and in the beginning a 1K (64 bit) disk memory. These were popular as branch terminals to the B5500/6500/6700 systems, and sold well in the banking sector, where they were often connected to non-Burroughs mainframes. In conjunction with these products, Burroughs also manufactured an extensive range of cheque processing equipment, normally attached as terminals to a larger system such as a B2700 or B1700.|$|E
50|$|Character matrix {{printers}} are {{a category}} of computer printers (typically impact printers) that place characters from a fixed character set anywhere onto a fixed grid of possible locations on the page. Examples of these are daisy wheel <b>printers,</b> golf <b>ball</b> <b>printers,</b> teleprinters, chain printers, and band printers. A character printer prints one character at a time.|$|R
60|$|I {{have turned}} away one artist: the poor {{creature}} was utterly incompetent {{to depict the}} sublime, graceful, and pathetic personages and events with which this history will most assuredly abound, and I doubt whether even the designer engaged in his place can make such a portrait of Miss Ethel Newcome as shall satisfy her friends and her own sense of justice. That blush which we have indicated, he cannot render. How are you to copy it with a steel point and a <b>ball</b> of <b>printer's</b> ink? That kindness which lights up the Colonel's eyes; gives an expression to the very wrinkles round about them; shines as a halo round his face;--what artist can paint it? The painters of old, when they portrayed sainted personages, were fain to have recourse to compasses and gold leaf--as if celestial splendour could be represented by Dutch metal! As our artist cannot come up to this task, the reader will be pleased to let his fancy paint for itself the look of courtesy for a woman, admiration for a young beauty, protection for an innocent child, {{all of which are}} expressed upon the Colonel's kind face, as his eyes are set upon Ethel Newcome.|$|R
