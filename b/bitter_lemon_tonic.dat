40|$|Quinine is a bitter-tasting, {{crystalline}} white powder. It {{is obtained}} from the bark of the cinchona tree and belongs {{to the group of}} alkaloids. In medicine quinine is used to treat malaria and nocturnal leg cramps. In the food sector, quinine is used as a flavouring mainly in beverages like <b>bitter</b> <b>lemon</b> and <b>tonic</b> water. When larger amounts of quinine are consumed, it can constitute a health problem for some consumer groups. BfR sees risks in particular for quinine intakes during pregnancy. For instance, a newborn baby, whose mother had drunk more than 1 litre tonic water a day in the weeks up to its birth, suffered health disorders. Already today quinine must be mentioned by name in the list of ingredients of quinine-containing products. BfR also believes {{that there is a need}} for information which attracts the attention more particularly of pregnant women and other risk groups to possible health impairments. Motor vehicle drivers should be informed that larger amounts of quinine-containing bitter beverages can cause visual disturbances. BfR recommends raising awareness about the possible health risks from quinine to consumers. Specific information should be provided about the symptoms of quinine hypersensitivity and cinchonism (typical adverse reactions to quinine). Consumers should be advised to immediately stop their quinine intake if these symptoms occur, and to consult a doctor. BfR is of the opinion that the problems of quinine-containing bitter soft drinks underline the importance of the systematic recording of adverse reactions that occur in conjunction with the consumption of foods. The Institute, therefore, explicitly supports the setting up of a central reporting office...|$|R
