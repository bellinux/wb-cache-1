40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} how the power dissipation of on-chip buses is affected by introducing a relative delay between the switching lines. Relative delay is shown to reduce the dissipated power of oppositely switching lines while causing a power penalty for similarly switching lines. A new low-power bus scheme that uses this effect is proposed and analyzed. As the introduced delay increases, the achieved power reduction increases while decreasing the bus throughput. Thus, a tradeoff between power reduction and throughput is required when selecting the imposed relative delay. The proposed low-power scheme, dynamic delayed line bus (DDL) scheme, led to a power reduction of up to 25 %, 33 %, and 42 % when applied to data, address, and differential buses, respectively. Simple DDL hardware is designed and implemented in a 0. 18 - m TSMC CMOS technology and applied to a 4500 - m long Metal 4 <b>bus.</b> <b>Circuit</b> simulation results for different bus widths are presented.

40|$|Abstract – The {{paper is}} divided into two parts. The first part of the paper gives the {{motivation}} to use SoC bus for system integration of a SoC as well as a brief review of the SoC concept, IP reuse, and research on SoC bus and SoC interconnect network. We define the SoC network as “classical SoC network ” that delivers data packets on a network. We point out in the paper that the classical SoC network introduces long data latency and contributes to high silicon cost. In {{the second part of the}} paper, we introduce the SoC bus research from Linköping University. We introduce a novel concept, PCC: Packet Connected Circuit. Based on PCC, a data transaction is initialized by packet routing. The rout is locked as a <b>bus</b> <b>circuit</b> after proving and acknowledging the rout. Therefore, we reach fixed and low transfer latency based on high bandwidth supporting multiple simultaneous data transfer. At the same time, buffers in the nodes are eliminated so that the silicon cost of a SoC network becomes feasible. MESA and MISA models are proposed for improving wrappers. A SoC system designer’s methodology is proposed so that a short TTM (Time To Market) SoC design is possible. 1...|$|E

The next is Flaw Confirmation, which involves confirming the flaws generated in the first stage through analysis of the specifications of the bus architectures as well as testing and research in the literature. The third stage is Flaw Generalization, which evaluates the impact of each flaw to determine whether it suggests that a more serious flaw exists in that bus architecture. The final stage is Flaw Elimination, which identifies strategies (and their costs) for mitigating the vulnerabilities based on techniques in the hardware security literature.
