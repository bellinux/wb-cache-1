50|$|This 13.5 - 15.5 cm long insectivorous {{species is}} dimorphic with {{eastern and western}} races, {{sometimes}} split as eastern <b>black-eared</b> <b>wheatear</b> (Oenanthe melanoleuca) and western <b>black-eared</b> <b>wheatear</b> (which then retains the name hispanica). In both forms, birds {{with or without a}} black throat are met with.|$|E
50|$|The <b>black-eared</b> <b>wheatear</b> (Oenanthe hispanica) is a wheatear, a small migratory {{passerine}} {{bird that}} was formerly classed {{as a member}} of the thrush family Turdidae, but is now more generally considered to be an Old World flycatcher (family Muscicapidae).|$|E
50|$|The island, as {{all that}} of the Tuscan Archipelago, {{is a place where}} the bird {{migration}} take a stop along their seasonal movement from North to South. The Audouin's gull, Puffinus yelkouan, <b>Black-eared</b> <b>wheatear,</b> Marmora's warbler and European shag are common on the island.|$|E
50|$|The song-perches {{utilised}} by {{this species}} are high for a wheatear, typically being 5 to 10 metres above ground. It often breeds in woodland habitats, unlike other wheatears (Oliver 1990 {{suggested that it}} occupies the ecological niche used elsewhere in the Western Palearctic by the common redstart). It is the most arboreal species of wheatear in the western palearctic and it uses often aerial sallying and perch-pounce-feeding tactics. Recent work suggest an ecological differentiation between Cyprus wheatear and migrating northern wheatears O. oenanthe and <b>black-eared</b> <b>wheatears</b> O. hispanica melanoleuca. Cyprus wheatear uses more aerial sallying and occupies more forested habitats, but needs a minimum amount of open/bare ground, and a minimum of high bush/tree vegetation (Randler et al. 2009).|$|R
500|$|A {{review of}} American and Pacific golden plover records was begun in 1991, {{with the purpose}} of {{evaluating}} whether any individuals previously accepted as [...] "either American or Pacific" [...] could now be definitely assigned to one species or the other (and vice versa). The results (a small {{decrease in the number of}} accepted American golden plovers, and a small increase in the number of accepted Pacifics) were published in the committee's report for 1996, with a comment that a detailed paper on the subject was being prepared, although as of 2009, this has not been published. A review of isabelline shrike records commenced in 1986. This review, the results of which were published in 1989, established a racial identification for a number of adult isabelline shrikes previously accepted to species level. A further review, with the same aim, was begun in the late 1990s. A preliminary set of results of this review was published in 2003; four previously accepted individuals were rejected, including one, in Cambridgeshire in 1978, which is now thought have been a hybrid with red-backed shrike. The full results of this second review were published in 2007; some of the previous racial attributions were withdrawn, but the committee felt able to confidently assign a race for a number of more recent individuals, although it stressed that this could only be done with adult birds (the committee's 2005 report mentions that a further article is in preparation). A review of <b>black-eared</b> <b>wheatears</b> was conducted in 2002–04, with the aim of assigning individuals to the eastern and western races where possible; this was possible with nine records; both western hispanica and eastern melanoleuca were shown to have occurred.|$|R
500|$|A {{subcommittee}} {{was set up}} in 1997 {{to undertake}} a review of rare bird records from the years immediately prior to BBRC's establishment. The purpose of the review was to ensure that all records from 1950 onwards (the cut-off date for Category A of the BOU British List of birds) have been subjected to a similar level of scrutiny. Not all of the 1,100 records of species considered to be rarities at that time were assessed, but only those related to species not recorded more than 100 times by 1997, as well as a few records of less rare species under particularly unusual circumstances, which were termed [...] "sore thumbs". Much of the original documentation was unavailable for the review, as it had been lost, and so for many records, the review was based solely on published accounts of the birds. The most notable outcome of this review was the reidentification of a frigatebird record from Tiree in 1953. Previously identified as a magnificent frigatebird, the BBRC review concluded that the bird was in fact an Ascension frigatebird, the only individual of this species ever identified in Europe (Walbridge, Small & McGowan 2003). The full results of the review were published in 2006. Of the 126 records reviewed, 37 were rejected as unacceptable. These included a claimed white-tailed eagle, which broke into a chicken-run in a garden and stole a chicken, three little crakes, three European scops owls, the only late December record of tawny pipit, three <b>black-eared</b> <b>wheatears,</b> a record of two White's thrushes together in April, a spring lanceolated warbler, two moustached warblers and a pine grosbeak. Furthermore, issues were found with the identification of Britain's first western sandpiper, on Fair Isle in 1956, and these led the BOURC to reject this record. The western sandpiper has been recorded several times subsequently in Britain however, and remains on the national list. The subcommittee's final report also hints at the prospect that some records from immediately prior to 1950 may be incorrect; because these fell outside the timeframes of the review they were not reassessed.|$|R
50|$|The Stone Mushrooms (Каменните гъби) is a rock {{phenomenon}} near Beli plast {{village in}} Bulgaria, {{on the road}} between Haskovo and Kardzhali. They are about 2.5 metres tall. The 3 hectares area was declared to be a natural resource on May 13, 1974, according to №РД-552 bill of the Ministry of Environment and Water. Interesting kinds of birds {{can be observed in}} the area: short-toed eagle, Egyptian vulture, red-rumped swallow, <b>black-eared</b> <b>wheatear</b> etc.|$|E
50|$|This 15-16 cm long bird breeds in {{semi-desert}} and stony hillsides from Turkey east to Afghanistan {{and western}} Pakistan. It is a short-distance migrant, wintering in Egypt, Cyprus and the Greater Middle East. The nest is {{built in a}} rock crevice, and 4-5 eggs is the normal clutch. In summer the male Finsch's wheatear is a white and black bird. The white crown, central back and belly contrast with the black face, throat and wings. The tail and rump are white, with an inverted black T giving a pattern like <b>black-eared</b> <b>wheatear,</b> but with a uniformly wide terminal band.|$|E
5000|$|The male is a boldly marked white-and-black bird. The white crown {{tinged with}} brown {{contrasts}} with the black face and throat and white rump. The female is browner, and the head is washed with sandy buff. Females are darker than the females of the northern wheatear, look smaller and show less white on the rump. The tail feathers are white with characteristic black markings, which form an inverted black [...] "T" [...] pattern that resembles {{the tail of the}} <b>black-eared</b> <b>wheatear.</b> This 14 cm bird nests in open, stony, sparsely vegetated regions, laying four to six eggs in a hole, under a stone or in a rock crevice. The pied wheatear primarily eats insects but will also take seeds.|$|E
50|$|Krumovitsa Important Bird Area {{supports}} 136 bird species. Sixty-four are {{species of}} European conservation concern (SPEC), {{two of them}} being included in category SPEC 1 as globally threatened, 18 in SPEC 2, and 44 in SPEC 3 as species threatened in Europe. The area is of global importance, {{as it is a}} representative biome for the Mediterranean zone. Seven biome-restricted species, typical for the Mediterranean zone out of nine established in Bulgaria, occur there: <b>black-eared</b> <b>wheatear</b> (Oenanthe hispanica), olive-tree warbler (Hippolais olivetorum), subalpine warbler (Sylvia cantillans), Sardinian warbler (Sylvia melanocephala), rock nuthatch (Sitta neumayer), masked shrike (Lanius nubicus) and black-headed bunting (Emberiza melanocephala). Krumovitsa {{is one of the few}} places in Bulgaria where the cinereous vulture (Aegypius monachus) and lesser kestrel (Falco naumanni) still can be observed. Krumovitsa provides suitable habitats for 46 species, included in Annex 2 of the Biodiversity Act, which need special conservation measures. Thirty-eight of them are listed also in Annex I of the Birds Directive and more than half of them breed in the region in significant populations. The region of the Krumovitsa is one of the most important sites in the country on a European Union scale for the breeding black stork (Ciconia nigra), Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus), booted eagle (Hieraaetus pennatus) and olive-tree warbler.|$|E
