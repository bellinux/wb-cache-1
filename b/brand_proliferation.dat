40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{construct}} a dynamic {{general equilibrium model}} to analyse different aspects of financial reforms in a two sector closed economy. Market structure {{in one of the}} sectors is perfectly competitive, while the other sector is monopolistically competitive. The perfectly competitive firms {{do not have access to}} the equity markets, whereas the imperfectly competitive firms finance their fixed cost needs through the equity market and operate under increasing returns to scale. Both types of firms depend on the banks for working capital finance. Financial reform is modeled as a one shot process of either increasing the efficiency of the equity market or decreasing the cash-reserve ratio of the banks. We analyse a steady state solution of the dynamic structure. Simulation exercises with alternative plausible parametric specifications regarding capital and labour intensities in the production process throw light on the issues of <b>brand</b> <b>proliferation</b> (emergence of new firms) and relative impact on the two sectors, following the initiation of a financial reform programme. <b>Brand</b> <b>Proliferation,</b> Equity Markets, Financial Liberalization...|$|E

40|$|Do price {{promotions}} generate {{additional revenue}} and for whom? Which brand, category, and market con-ditions influence promotional benefits and their allocation across manufacturers and retailers? To answer these questions, we conduct a large-scale econometric {{investigation of the}} effects of price promotions on man-ufacturer revenues, retailer revenues, and total profits (margins). A first major finding is that a price promotion typically does not have permanent monetary effects for either party. Second, price promotions have a predominantly positive impact on manufacturer revenues, but their effects on retailer revenues are mixed. Moreover, retailer category margins are typically reduced by price pro-motions. Even when accounting for cross-category and store-traffic effects, we still find evidence that price promotions are typically not beneficial to the retailer. Third, our results indicate that manufacturer revenue elas-ticities are higher for promotions of small-share brands, for frequently promoted brands and for national brands in impulse product categories with a low degree of <b>brand</b> <b>proliferation</b> and low private-label shares. Retailer revenue elasticities are higher for brands with frequent and shallow promotions, for impulse products, and in categories with a low degree of <b>brand</b> <b>proliferation.</b> Finally, retailer margin elasticities are higher for promo-tions of small-share brands and for brands with infrequent and shallow promotions.

40|$|Competition with product rivalry is {{examined}} {{in a model}} where products are differentiated by both quality and brand name. With no commitment, firms produce a full product line. When firms can commit to restrict their product offerings, firms specialize if the degree of brand-specific differentiation is small and they produce a full product line if brand-specific differentiation is large relative to intrafirm differentiation. Firms may crowd a product space when all competitors would be better-off with specialization. <b>Brand</b> <b>proliferation</b> is a credible entry-deterring strategy if the degree of brand-specific differentiation is not too large.

40|$|Transfer pricing {{can be used}} as a {{strategic}} instrument to accomplish those objectives that enterprises pursue within the context of multi-divisional organization. This paper analyses the use of transfer pricing for decentralized multinational enterprises (MNEs) as {{a strategic}} instrument to tackle the issues of <b>brand</b> <b>proliferation.</b> The centralized headquarters ’ prior action on setting transfer pricing is to backup the decentralized subsidiaries in their output decision- making. It shows that the higher transfer pricing has enabled easier collusion amongst the brand’s agencies in developing an intra-brand competition model. With regard to the level of transfer pricing, this hinges upon the strength of intra-brand competition and inter-brand competition which are expressed in opposite direction. It also demonstrates that the optimal transfer pricing is affected by any difference in tax rates between two countries. (In the case where tax rates are the same, there is no effect on transfer pricing strategy). With the rapid growth of multinational enterprises (MNEs), the pricing of internal transactions undertaken by MNE’s headquarters is a tax issue that tax authorities are concerned about but it is also a strategic concern of MNE in supporting its local subsidiaries in <b>brand</b> <b>proliferation</b> and output decision, as the MNEs have the incentive to manipulate their transfer prices in order to shift profit “cross-border”, so that they may minimize their tax burden. Ramy Elitzur and Jack Mintz (1996) discussed corporate tax competition that is subject to a transfer pricing rule, and argued that tax will be reduced when harmonization is taken into consideration...|$|E

The paper also considers the welfare improving potential of the second-best regulatory policies. One is a behavioral regulation that controls each firm's output, but leaves entry and exit free; the other is a structural regulation that determines the number of firms active on the market, but leaves to each firm to determine its output level. It is shown that the opening up of international trade tends to make structural regulation relatively more welfare improving than behavioral regulation...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{shows that}} the {{relationships}} between the dynamics of drug priees, patent expiry, and competition by multisource drugs vary significantly across countries. A clear distinction seems to emerge. On the one side, systems that rely on market based competition (particularly the US) promote a clear distinction between firms that act as innovators and firms that act as imitators after patent expiry. Original products enjoy premium prices under patent protection, and face fierce price competition after patent expiry. On the contrary, systems that rely on administered prices (particularly France and Italy) nurture strategies of pre-emptive <b>brand</b> <b>proliferation</b> and horizontal differentiation by imitative brand name products, well before patent expiry. Our work confirms that that systems that rely on administered prices have tended to stifle price competition, to protect less efficient companies, and to encourage strategies of incremental innovation and imitation...|$|E
40|$|Interaction between own {{research}} and externally produced knowledge {{has been observed}} both at the firm and the macro level. This paper intends {{to fill a gap}} between endogenous growth models which treat knowledge capital as either a purely national or global public good. As a generalization, we introduce "absorptive capacities" of a smaller country "tapping" the knowledge stock of a larger autarkic country (the technological leader, evolving along its steady state) by means of own investment in R&D into an endogenous growth model with <b>brand</b> <b>proliferation</b> due to Grossman and Helpman. The asymptotic behavior of the ensuing non-linear dynamic model is analyzed in detail. Long-run solutions for the variables representing the evolution of the follower country are compared with the perfect-autarky steady states for both countries. Along a trajectory consistent with perfect foresight in the valuation of the firm, the follower's long-run rate of innovation approaches that of the leader which implies an improvement in the long-run innovative and growth performance of the follower as measured against the perfect autarky benchmark. The limit ratio of the knowledge stocks originating in the two countries is calculated explicitly. The present model is richer in its dynamic behavior than the basic model of <b>brand</b> <b>proliferation.</b> Unlike the basic model, an originally stagnant, non-innovating follower economy might still be able to embark on an equilibrium trajectory with ongoing innovation, in particular when it is linked informationally to a rapidly innovating leader. The model accounts for a number of observed facts about international economic growth. Perfect-foresight trajectories resulting in catching up and secular changes in leadership by taking over in terms of knowledge stocks and total factor productivity are generated by the present model under well-defined conditions. At the same time, the opportunities of catching up and taking over are shown to be limited {{in the sense that the}} backward and forward time-lags vis-a-vis the leader tend to finite values. While long-run rates of innovation and growth are equalized, implicit transitional growth differentials give rise to statements about convergence (or divergence) across countries depending on the set of conditions prevailing in the two countries initially...|$|E
40|$|While {{there has}} been strong {{managerial}} and academic interest in price promotions, much of the {{focus has been on}} the impact of such promotions on category sales, brand sales and brand choice. In contrast, {{little is known about the}} long-run impact of price promotions on manufacturer and retailer revenues and margins, although both marketing researchers and practitioners consider this a priority area (Marketing Science Institute 2000). Do promotions generate additional revenue and for whom? Which brand, category and market conditions influence promotional benefits and their allocation across manufacturers and retailers? To answer these questions, we conduct a large-scale econometric investigation of the effects of price promotions on manufacturer revenues, retailer revenues and margins. This investigation proceeds in two steps. First, persistence modeling reveals the short- and long-run effects of price promotions on these performance measures. Second, weighted least-squares analysis shows to what extent brand and promotion policies, as well as market-structure and category characteristics, influence promotional impact. A first major finding of our paper is that price promotions do not have permanent monetary effects for either party. Second, in terms of the cumulative, over-time, promotional impact on their revenues, we find significant differences between the manufacturer and retailer. Price promotions have a predominantly positive impact on manufacturer revenues, but their effects on retailer revenues are mixed. Retailer (category) margins, in contrast, are typically reduced by price promotions. Even when accounting for cross-category and store-traffic effects, we still find evidence that price promotions are typically not beneficial to the retailer. Third, our results indicate that manufacturer revenue elasticities are higher for promotions of small-share brands and for frequently promoted brands. Moreover, they are higher for storable products and lower in categories with a high degree of <b>brand</b> <b>proliferation.</b> Retailer revenue elasticities, in turn, are higher for brands with frequent and shallow promotions, for storable products and in categories with a low extent of <b>brand</b> <b>proliferation.</b> As such, from a revenue-generating point of view, manufacturer and retailer interests are often aligned in terms of which categories and brands to promote. Finally, retailer margin elasticities are higher for promotions of small-share brands and for brands with infrequent and shallow promotions. Thus, the implications with respect to the frequency of promotions depend upon the performance measure the retailer chooses to emphasize. The paper discusses the managerial implications of our results for both manufacturers and retailers and suggests various avenues for future research...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – This paper first {{attempts}} {{to analyze the}} issue of <b>brand</b> <b>proliferation</b> by a monopolist allowing transfer pricing as a channel to bridge headquarters and brand divisions, and then to view how the headquarters uses transfer pricing as a strategic device to encounter intra-brand competition, inter-brand competition and cross-border profit-shifting under an oligopolistic market. Design/methodology/approach – This paper models cross-country interactions in a Cournot-Nash framework, and characterizes equilibrium that involves both transfer pricing and output decision. MNE’s behavior {{is based on a}} two-stage process in which the centralized headquarters ’ prior action on setting transfer pricing is to backup the decentralized subsidiaries in their output decision-making. Findings – It is demonstrated that MNEs have the incentive to manipulate their transfer prices in order to shift profit cross-border. Higher transfer pricing enables brand divisions to collude easier in the intra-brand competition model, and the level of transfer price hinges upon the strength of intra-brand competition and inter-brand competition. In addition, transfer pricing is affected by tax differences between two countries. Originality/value – This paper provides the theoretical underpinning to see how headquarters may use transfer pricing as a strategic device to face intra- and inter-brand competition that is visibly evident in many diverse industries...|$|E

40|$|Proliferation is a {{strategic}} behavior which follows various logics: the wish for pre-emption {{is one of}} these but does not stand alone. Far from it. However, the literature associates almost systematically the question of proliferation to that of pre-emption, {{in such a way that}} the interest in the incumbent’s offer of proliferation can only be measured in terms of its pre-emptive power. The decision to proliferate is a choice which must be made by the incumbent even before he is aware of the particular characteristics of his future challengers. At the moment of choosing his position in the product space, the incumbent does not know on which market he could be opposed, and he is equally unaware of the cost at which his hypothetical rival is capable of undertaking production. Therefore he runs the risk of choosing a position which he may be unable to sustain once the market is mature, particularly if he was to stand up to more technologically advanced opponents or those with an organization superior to his own. In this setting we show that <b>brand</b> <b>proliferation</b> looks like a development of “hopeful monsters” that can limit the risk run by the ﬁrm of being excluded from the mature markets...|$|E
40|$|The {{purposes}} of this article are threefold: first, to highlight some of the pressures facing those who are charged with the management of brands; second, to suggest a framework for thinking about these challenges and how to deal with them (“brand chartering”); and third, to illustrate how this framework is of help in management practice. The tough world of brand management Six years can be a long time in branding: 1988 was commemorated as the year of the brand; by 1994 times had changed to the extent that meditating over the death of the brand manager had become commonplace (Economist, 1988, 1994). What had happened over this period? The symbolism of Marlboro Friday ensured that 1993 was the year when everyone started to question the added value of brands (Fortune, 1993). Brands might be regarded as valuable intangible assets, but – like all assets – their value could fall as well as rise. “Goodwill ” could be lost as well gained. Ironically, Marlboro’s main marketing platform did not really deserve this inquisition, but go into any supermarket today and see how many one-product brands are trying to retail at over 250 percent of the generic product price. This event led many to question the health of brands, and to wonder whether certain companies had too many fragmented brands (a problem of <b>brand</b> <b>proliferation),</b> or not enough (giving rise to fears of inadequate market exposure). But perhaps the real lesson of the Marlboro experience was to highlight the fact that “world number ones ” are coming under scrutiny as never before (de Jonquieres, 1993; Macrae 1994 a, 1994 b). The problems facing Marlboro (or the problems that were capturing the imagination of commentators) had become a matter of global interest and debate. The following year was when various companies with world-class intentions – including Coca-Cola, Unilever and Intel – showed themselves to have communications processes that were some way short of strategically integrated or forward thinking “ 1994 will go down as the year when the gloves came off in international businesses”, declared an editorial in the Financial Times (1994 a), “the fact is that markets for goods and services are becoming fiercer as they become global”...|$|E
