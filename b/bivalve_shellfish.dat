All commercially harvested shellfish are subject to strict hygiene regulations. Some people do suffer from allergies to shellfish, and this is an unfortunate fact of life. Often the allergies are very specific and caused by one type of shellfish only. Shellfish should be carefully stored keeping them cool but moist. Do not re-water shellfish, which you have bought.

40|$|Abstract The {{interest}} of culturing <b>bivalved</b> <b>shellfish</b> (including mussels, clams, oysters etc.), {{has increased in}} recent years, but the consumption has been hampered both by high levels of heavy metals and toxic algae. The levels of heavy metals (Hg, Cd, Pb, Zn, Cu and As) were determined in soft tissues of different shellfish from Zhejiang coastal waters, East China Sea. The average concentrations of the heavy metals analyzed exhibited the following decreasing order: Zn> Cu> As> Cd> Pb> Hg. Comparison of heavy metals concentrations among species indicated that Bivalves clearly have significant potential as useful bioindicators; however, {{the results indicated that}} no one species is universally suitable, as is true of any organism used in these studies. The distribution of the metals was also investigated along the Zhejiang coast, which the results showed the mean concentra-tion of Hg and Cd detected did not vary greatly and presented a similar spatial pattern at different sam-pling stations, the concentrations of Zn and Pb were highly variable at different sampling sites. The amounts of heavy metals in soft tissue of shellfish were also compared with those from the related species from other seas in China and world marine waters. The results suggested that the coastal area might be considered relatively unpolluted with heavy metals and the concentrations of metals in shellfish also below the seafood safety limits for human consumption...|$|R
40|$|Fish {{and seafood}} are widely {{available}} foods that provide important nutrients to consumers. Research conducted {{over the past few}} years suggests that there are health benefits associated with fish and seafood consumption, including for the cardiovascular and visual systems. It was also reported that such a diet increases protection in infants against arthritis or cancer. Although regular seafood consumption has been linked to health benefits for the general population, contaminants that may be present in seafood could pose a risk to humans. There are a number of contaminants that may be associated with seafood, including chemicals, metals, toxins and other substances as well as potentially harmful microbes. Most seafood contains detectable levels of contaminants because these are a part of the environment and food chain.

40|$|The American {{hard-shelled}} clam (Mercenaria mercenaria) is {{a valuable}} <b>bivalve</b> molluscan <b>shellfish</b> in the U. S. A, and Canada. This bivalve is somewhat like the cockle (familiar to most Irish people) or the palourde (Venerupis decussata) which is gathered on {{some parts of the}} Irish coast and exported to France. Unlike the cockle which lives in sand, or the palourde which is found mainly in coarse sand and shingle, the hard-shelled clam lives in sandy mud. Some years ago this clam established itself in Southampton Water, on the south coast of England. It is thought that this particular stock originated from live clams thrown overboard from an American liner. Due to the warming effect of the outflow from a large power station near Southampton, coupled with naturally occurring high sea-water temperatures in this area, the clams were able to breed and multiply. Normally the seawater temperatures around the coasts of Gt. Britain and Ireland are too low to permit the clams to multiply by natural breeding...|$|R

[...] A keystone species, low in the food chain, <b>bivalve</b> <b>shellfish</b> such as oysters support a complex community of species by performing a number of functions essential to the diverse array of species that surround them. There is also increasing recognition that some shellfish species may impact or control many ecological processes; so much so that they are included on the list of “ecosystem engineers”—organisms that physically, biologically or chemically modify the environment around them in ways that influence the health of other organisms. [...] Many of the ecological functions and processes performed or affected by shellfish contribute to human well-being by providing a stream of valuable ecosystem services over time by filtering out particulate materials and potentially mitigating water quality issues by controlling excess nutrients in the water.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bivalve</b> <b>shellfish</b> recycle {{nutrients}} that enter waterways from human and agricultural sources. Nutrient bioextraction is “an environmental management strategy by which nutrients {{are removed from}} an aquatic ecosystem through the harvest of enhanced biological production, including the aquaculture of suspension-feeding shellfish or algae.” Nutrient removal by shellfish, which are then harvested from the system, {{has the potential to}} help address environmental issues including excess inputs of nutrients (eutrophication), low dissolved oxygen, reduced light availability and impacts on eelgrass, harmful algal blooms, and increases in incidence of paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP). For example, the average harvested mussel contains: 0.8-1.2 % nitrogen and 0.06-0.08 % phosphorus Removal of enhanced biomass can not only combat eutrophication and also support the local economy by providing product for animal feed or compost. In Sweden, environmental agencies utilize mussel farming as a management tool in improving water quality conditions, where mussel bioextraction efforts have been evaluated and shown to be a highly effective source of fertilizer and animal feed In the U.S., researchers are investigating potential to model the use of shellfish and seaweed for nutrient mitigation in certain areas of Long Island Sound.|$|E

40|$|<b>Bivalve</b> {{molluscan}} <b>shellfish,</b> such as oysters, filter {{large volumes}} of water {{as part of their}} feeding activities and are able to accumulate and concentrate different types of pathogens, particularly noroviruses, from fecal human pollution. Based on our previous observation of a specific binding of the Norwalk strain (prototype norovirus genogroup I) to the oyster digestive tract through an A-like carbohydrate structure indistinguishable from human blood group A antigen and on the large diversity between strains in terms of carbohydrate-binding specificities, we evaluated the different ligands implicated in attachment to oysters tissues of strains representative of two main genogroups of human norovirus. The GI. 1 and GII. 4 strains differed in that the latter recognized a sialic acid-containing ligand, present in all tissues, in addition to the A-like ligand of the digestive tract shared with the GI. 1 strain. Furthermore, bioaccumulation experiments using wild-type or mutant GI. 1 Viruslike particles showed accumulation in hemocytes largely, but not exclusively, based on interaction with the A-like ligand. Moreover, a seasonal effect on the expression of these ligands was detected, most visibly for the GI. 1 strain, with a peak in late winter and spring, a period when GI strains are regularly involved in oyster-related outbreaks. These observations may explain some of the distinct epidemiological features of strains from different genogroups...|$|R
40|$|Hepatitis E virus (HEV), an enteric {{pathogen}} of both humans and animals, is excreted by infected individuals {{and is therefore}} present in wastewaters and coastal waters. As <b>bivalve</b> molluscan <b>shellfish</b> are known to concentrate viral particles {{during the process of}} filter feeding, they may accumulate this virus. The bioaccumulation efficiencies of oysters (Crassostrea gigas), flat oysters (Ostrea edulis), mussels (Mytilus edulis), and clams (Ruditapes philippinarum) were compared at different time points during the year. Tissue distribution analysis showed that most of the viruses were concentrated in the digestive tissues of the four species. Mussels and clams were found to be more sensitive to sporadic contamination events, as demonstrated by rapid bioaccumulation in less than 1 h compared to species of oysters. For oysters, concentrations increased during the 24 -h bioaccumulation period. Additionally, to evaluate environmental occurrence of HEV in shellfish, an environmental investigation was undertaken at sites potentially impacted by pigs, wild boars, and human waste. Of the 286 samples collected, none were contaminated with hepatitis E virus, despite evidence that this virus is circulating in some French areas.

40|$|Paralytic {{shellfish}} poisoning (PSP) toxins are a {{group of}} potent neurotoxins produced by certain strains of marine dinoflagellates.

40|$|Human noroviruses (NoVs) are {{considered}} a worldwide leading cause of acute non-bacterial gastroenteritis. Due {{to a combination of}} prolonged shedding of high virus levels in feces, virus particle shedding during asymptomatic infections, and a high environmental persistence, NoVs are easily transmitted pathogens. Norovirus (NoV) outbreaks have often been reported and tend to affect a lot of people. NoV is spread via feces and vomit, but this NoV spread can occur through several transmission routes. While person-to-person transmission is without a doubt the dominant transmission route, human infective NoV outbreaks are often initiated by contaminated food or water. Zoonotic transmission of NoV has been investigated, but has thus far not been demonstrated. The presented review aims to give an overview of these NoV transmission routes. Regarding NoV person-to-person transmission, the NoV GII. 4 genotype is discussed in the current review as it has been very successful for several decades but reasons for its success have only recently been suggested. Both pre-harvest and post-harvest contamination of food products can lead to NoV food borne illness. Pre-harvest contamination of food products mainly occurs via contact with polluted irrigation water in case of fresh produce or with contaminated harvesting water in case of <b>bivalve</b> molluscan <b>shellfish.</b> On the other hand, an infected food handler is considered as a major cause of post-harvest contamination of food products. Both transmission routes are reviewed by a summary of described NoV food borne outbreaks between 2000 and 2010. A third NoV transmission route occurs via water and the spread of NoV via river water, ground water, and surface water is reviewed. Finally, although zoonotic transmission remains hypothetical, a summary on the bovine and porcine NoV presence observed in animals is given and the presence of human infective NoV in animals is discussed. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

However, it is now well documented that shellfish that meet the E. coli standards for human consumption may contain human enteric viruses that cause gastroenteritis and hepatitis. In this study we investigated using F-specific RNA bacteriophage (FRNA bacteriophage) to indicate the likely presence of such viruses in shellfish sold for consumption. FRNA bacteriophage and E. coli levels were determined over a 2 -year period for oysters (Crassostrea gigas) harvested from four commercial sites chosen to represent various degrees of sewage pollution. Three sites were classified as category B sites under the relevant European Community (EC) Directive (91 / 492), which required purification (depuration) of oysters from these sites before sale. One site was classified as a category A site, and oysters from this site could be sold directly without further processing. Samples were tested {{at the point of}} sale following commercial processing and packaging. All of the shellfish complied with the mandatory EC E. coli standard (less than 230 per 100 g of shellfish flesh), and the levels of contamination for more than 90 % of the shellfish were at or below the level of sensitivity of the assay (20 E. coli MPN per 100 g), which indicated good quality based on this criterion. In contrast, FRNA bacteriophage were frequently detected at levels that exceeded 1, 000 PFU per 100 g. High levels of FRNA bacteriophage contamination were strongly associated with harvest area fecal pollution and with shellfish-associated disease outbreaks. Interestingly, FRNA bacteriophage contamination exhibited a marked seasonal trend that was consistent with the trend of oyster-associated gastroenteritis in the United Kingdom. The correlation between FRNA bacteriophage contamination and health risk was investigated further by using a reverse transcription-PCR assay for Norwalk-like virus (NLV). NLV contamination of oysters was detected only at the most polluted site and also exhibited a seasonal trend that was consistent with the trend of FRNA bacteriophage contamination and with the incidence of disease.

Here, we present a unique archival dataset of mussel shells from a locale with recent environmental monitoring and historical climate reconstructions. We compare shell structure and composition in modern mussels, mussels from the 1970 s, and mussel shells dating back to 1000 – 2420 years BP. Shell mineralogy has changed dramatically over the past 15 years, despite evidence for consistent mineral structure in the California mussel, Mytilus californianus, over the prior 2500 years. We present evidence for increased disorder in the calcium carbonate shells of mussels and greater variability between individuals. These changes in the last decade contrast markedly from a background of consistent shell mineralogy for centuries. Our results use an archival record of natural specimens to provide centennial-scale context for altered minerology and variability in shell features as a response to acidification stress and illustrate the utility of long-term studies and archival records in global change ecology. Increased variability between individuals is an emerging pattern in climate change responses, which may equally expose the vulnerability of organisms and the potential of populations for resilience...|$|R

Results Twenty-nine (48. 3 %) oyster samples were revealed to be contaminated {{with one or more}} Vibrio species. The Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Vibrio vulnificus counts in the samples ranged from < 0. 5 log 10 Most Probable Number (MPN) g– 1 to 2. 3 log 10 MPN g– 1 oyster and from < 0. 5 log 10 MPN g– 1 to 2. 1 log 10 MPN g– 1 oyster, respectively. Of the 60 seawater samples analyzed, 44 (73. 3 %) showed signs of contamination with one or more vibrio species. The counts of V. parahaemolyticus and V. vulnificus in the samples ranged from < 0. 3 log 10 MPN· 100 mL– 1 to 1. 7 log 10 MPN· 100 mL– 1 seawater and from < 0. 3 log 10 MPN· 100 mL– 1 to 2. 0 log 10 MPN· 100 mL– 1 seawater, respectively. A positive correlation between V. vulnificus counts and the seawater temperature as well as a negative correlation between the V. parahaemolyticus counts and salinity were observed. Conclusions The results suggest the need to implement strategies to prevent vibrio diseases from being transmitted by the consumption of contaminated <b>bivalve</b> <b>shellfish...</b>|$|E
40|$|Cysts of the {{protozoan}} parasite Giardia {{have been}} detected in many <b>bivalve</b> <b>shellfish</b> species worldwide. The detection of zoonotic Giardia duodenalis assemblages A and B is of public health concern, yet there is limited data available demonstrating the bioaccumulation and elimination of Giardia cysts in <b>bivalve</b> <b>shellfish</b> [...] This study quantified G. duodenalis cysts that were filtered and retained by oysters (Crassostrea virginica) over a one week chronic exposure period, or 24 hour exposure followed by a 6 day depuration period, using static tank systems containing 10 L of 29 ppt water inoculated with 1, 000 or 10, 000 cysts. Under chronic exposure, each oyster retained a mean of 13. 4 and 87. 4 cysts during the first 24 hours of exposure at low and high doses, respectively, and cysts bioaccumulated {{at a rate of}} 1. 2 and 6. 8 cysts/oyster/day, respectively, for the remaining duration of the trials. In acute exposure trials, oysters retained 13. 8 cysts or 78. 9 cysts at low and high dose, respectively, during the initial 24 hour exposure and naturally depurated cysts at a rate of – 0. 92 cysts/oyster/day and - 2. 2 cysts/oyster/day, respectively, after transfer. Although most G. duodenalis cysts were eliminated within the first 24 hours via pseudofeces and feces, detection of some cysts in the fecal material on day 7 of acute exposure trials was indicative of cysts which passed through the digestive tract and released in feces. Only 48 - 53 % of the initial tank inocula was recovered and may indicate that some cysts were selectively filtered by oysters but degraded through digestion...|$|E
40|$|Diarrhetic {{shellfish}} poisoning (IDSP) toxins pose {{a serious}} health risk for consumers of <b>bivalves</b> and other <b>shellfish,</b> {{as well as}} a huge economic burden for the bivalve-producing farmers. In this work, the aim was to utilize a solubilization-based protein-isolation method to produce a low-DSP toxin protein isolate from toxic blue mussels that are unsuitable for the whole shellfish market. A homogenate of whole mussel meat was solubilized at low pH (2. 8) or high pH (11. 1), followed by centrifugation and reprecipitation of the solubilized mussel proteins at the isoelectric pH. In a second centrifugation, precipitated proteins were collected. These processes resulted in 81 (acid solubilization) and 72 % (alkaline solubilization) reduction in the initial DTX- 1 toxin content of the mussel meat. No other DSP toxins were-found in the protein isolates. Acid processing of mussel meat resulted in 50 % reduction in the total lipid content, while alkaline treatment did not significantly affect the) lipid content. The effect of citric acid and calcium chloride addition to the mussel meat-water homegenate on lipid and toxin content was also investigated. A poor correlation factor was surprisingly obtained between reductions in DTX- 1 toxin and lipids in protein isolates from,processed toxic mussels. Results from an analytical mass balance of the DTX- 1 toxin during acid processing showed that 61 % of this toxin ended up in the aqueous supernatant after the second centrifugation. The present study presents a promising alternative way of utilizing mussels for food production in periods when they are toxic...|$|R
40|$|Protocol for {{hatchery}} {{culture of}} the pullet carpet shell clam Venerupis corrugata spat is currently under development, as the only reliable means of providing spat to replenish natural beds or to support aquaculture activities. Among other variables, the microbiota has been demonstrated to be critical for successful <b>bivalve</b> culture. <b>Shellfish</b> hatcheries are hindered by fatal outbreaks of disease, regardless the bivalve species. These mass mortalities are mainly caused by opportunistic bacteria belonging to genus Vibrio and constitute one bottleneck for this economic activity. Different species, as V. tubiashii, V. pectenicida, V. splendidus, V. neptunius, V. ostreicida and V. bivalvicida, {{have been identified as}} responsible of mortalities in hatchery-reared larvae, affecting a wide range of bivalves. This is the first report of the microbiota associated with larval cultures of the pullet carpet shell clam. We present the results of the microbiological analyses of two larval cultures of pullet carpet shell reared in the Centro de Investigacións Mariñas (CIMA, Xunta de Galicia) de Ribadeo (Galicia, NW Spain) following the procedures developed in the institution. Each batch, A and B, was obtained from broodstocks collected in natural environment but in different geographical locations, the stock A (SW Galicia) and the stock B (NW Galicia). Previous records of mortalities led us to divide each batch in two. One sub-batch (A 1 and B 1) was cultured following the routine procedures. Antibiotic was experimentally added to the other sub-batch (A 2 and B 2) with the aim of evaluating the effects on the culturable bacterial population (total marine bacteria and presumptive vibrios) and on larval survival. Chloramphenicol, formerly the most commonly used antibiotic in bivalve hatcheries, was supplied with each change of seawater during larval development. Microbiological samples of broodstock, larvae and seawater in culture tanks were taken and processed immediately following Prado et al. (2005, 2014). The bacteriological media used were Marine Agar, for heterotrophic marine bacteria, and Thiosulphate-Citrate-Bile-Sucrose, selective for vibrios. Bacterial counts were determined in all samples and expressed in colony forming unit (cfu) per millilitre or gram. The different types of colony in the samples of larval cultures were isolated, purified and subjected to a basic phenotypic characterization. Further studies were carried out with the isolates that shared the main features of the genus Vibrio, including phenotypic tests and the genetic characterization by sequencing of 16 S rRNA gene, as described by Prado et al. (2014). The counts of marine heterotrophic bacteria associated to broodstock gonad were similar in both groups (≈ 105 cfu/g). However, substantial differences were observed in the counts of presumptive vibrios, with higher values in the stock B (≈ 104 cfu/g) than in the stock A (≈ 102 cfu/g). Interestingly, the larval batch A showed high bacterial counts in the initial samples, including presumptive vibrios, while the batch B began with lower numbers of total marine bacteria and vibrios. The survival rates {{at the end of the}} larval development were higher in batch B (40 % B 1, 32 % B 2) than in batch A (24 % A 1, 27 % A 2). The use of antibiotic did not imply a significant enhancement of the survival. The total counts in the seawater from the culture tanks were similar. The presumptive vibrios were found mainly associated to larvae, regardless the batch or the use of antibiotic. The differences on the composition of bacterial populations will be analysed, focused on the identification of the presumptive vibrios. Preliminary results showed the dominance of species within the Splendidus clade of the genus Vibrio, as expected taking into account that its members have been isolated from marine environments and many of them from bivalves. Due to the high phenotypic diversity within this clade and the difficult to differentiate species, the correlation between phenotypic and genotypic identification will be evaluated...|$|R
40|$|The {{programme}} WOT- 05 Fishery Research {{is carrying}} out statutory research tasks {{related to the}} management of the fishery and aquaculture in the Netherlands. The programme is developed in consultation with the Ministry of Economic Affairs (EZ). The content and scope of programme has been agreed for the period 2011 - 2015. In September 2015 it was decided to extend the programme till 31 December 2016. This report is a technical report and summarises the progress made in carrying out the work plan of 2016. Fisheries policy makers and managers are dependent on up-todate information. The aim of this programme is to contribute to the collection of essential data needed for the management of fisheries, fish stocks and aquaculture through sampling programmes in as well marine and inshore areas. The data collection includes sampling programmes on fish species landed in fishing ports, discard and by-catch monitoring programmes on board of commercial vessels and scientific surveys using research vessels. In addition, monitoring programmes on <b>shellfish</b> (<b>bivalves)</b> are carried out in coastal waters to estimate the biomass of these resources. In national fresh waters also the eel stock and the stocks in IJsselmeer and Markermeer are monitored. The data have been used to provide advice which is also part of this programme. The advice for marine stocks and fisheries is based on analyses of international data carried out by working groups. The main frameworks in which this was done were ICES and STECF. These frameworks also {{play a role in the}} international co-ordination of the research carried out in this programme. The programme is carried out by the Centre for Fisheries Research (CVO) and the Institute for Marine Resources and Ecosystem Studies (IMARES, since September 2016 Wageningen Marine Research) in IJmuiden. The programme is financed by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and coordinated by Sieto Verver (CVO) CVO rapport 17. 002 Jaarverslag WOT visserij 2016 23 of 98 The programme has been executed according to a pre-agreed work plan.
