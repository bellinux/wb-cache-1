40|$|The Variable Displacement Engine (VDE) {{is a new}} {{generation}} of engines that are designed to decrease the fuel consumption at the cruise speed of a vehicle. The isolation of the VDE's new vibration pattern is beyond the capabilities of conventional mounts and bushings. Consequently, in this thesis, novel active and semi-active solutions are proposed to develop various semi-active and active hydraulic bushing proof-of-concept systems that may solve the isolation problem in a VDE system. The dynamic stiffness response, which is the transfer function that relates the engine displacement to the transmitted force, is normally used as the key design criterion for engine mounts and bushings. In this thesis, a linear mathematical model of a conventional hydraulic bushing is purposed. The validity of the mathematical model is confirmed by an experimental analysis, and the various parameters in the dynamic stiffness equation are evaluated. The experimental results indicate that the dynamic stiffness frequency response of the conventional hydraulic bushing has both soft and stiff regions. The soft region is limited to low frequencies. For the VDE isolation, the goal is to provide a soft bushing for a wider range of frequencies than a conventional bushing can accommodate. Addition of a short inertia track, similar to a decoupler used in conventional hydraulic engine mounts, may be used to extend the soft region of a conventional hydraulic bushing, and the experimental results validate it. Since the short inertia track provides no additional damping, a supplementary Magnetorheological (MR) valve is also devised. The MR valve has the advantage to minimize the amount of MR fluid used, which significantly reduces the cost of the overall system. The novel valve allows the damping coefficient of the <b>bushing</b> <b>assembly</b> to be controlled by varying the electrical current input to a solenoid coil. A mathematical model is derived for the MR bushing, and is validated experimentally. In addition, an active bushing to solve the VDE isolation problem is purposed in this thesis. In this bushing, a magnetic actuator, composed of a permanent magnet and a solenoid coil, is included in the active bushing. This active chamber affects the dynamic stiffness response of the bushing by altering the bushing's internal pressure. The nonlinear equation of motion of the permanent magnet is linearized and is incorporated into the new mathematical model of the system. The new purposed model for the active bushing is in good agreement with the experimental results. This active chamber is also proved capable of producing complex dynamic stiffness frequency response. The conclusion is that the proposals in this thesis can contribute to the isolation of the vibration pattern, imposed by the application of a VDE system...|$|E
40|$|The RAPD {{program is}} a federal {{organization}} funded by the National Science Foundation that supports the development of technologies for new and improved devices or software for persons with disabilities; {{in the case of}} our project and our fellow classmates, the program provided grants to student projects that are designed to help persons with disabilities in participating and enjoying physical activity. Our project is directed with the help of Dr. Widmann and Dr. Taylor of the Mechanical Engineering and Kinesiology Departments respectively, at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo. Three students from the Mechanical Department and one student from the Kinesiology department have been tasked with the design of this unique mobility walker to assist a local 8 -year old Special Olympian. The walker makes use of lightweight materials, specialized balloon beach tires, and a very rigid frame to ensure safety, longevity and overall aesthetic appeal. This report details the idea generation, concept selection, calculations and design of a mobility walker for traversing the beach environment. The design that the team implemented is a direct influence from Sean’s current beach walker, his general purpose walker and other existing designs that were researched. Our final design was fabricated at a total cost of approximately $ 850, which was significantly reduced due to generous donations from multiple suppliers. Despite the success of our final product, a few minor improvements could be made to the design. The pipe fittings used to connect the various components of the frame are slightly too big and result in a loose fit with the tube. A new clamp could be selected to help eliminate any clearance that may affect the overall function and strength of the walker. In addition, the weight could be reduced through the use of thinner wall aluminum tube and the caster could be fabricated by bending thicker aluminum as opposed to the welded design we produced. A final recommendation for improvement is making the foam padding more secure by fastening it directly to the frame to eliminate chances of slipping while Sean is in the water. The primary features of the final design include: 1. High surface area, low pressure, polyurethane balloon tires that are specialized for beach environment are used to allow easy traverse across sand and other comparable terrain. In addition, they provide significant stability and buoyancy while in the water. 2. The handlebars can be adjusted to accommodate Sean’s growth. 3. The frame is powder coated and fastened using corrosive resistant hardware to prevent rust from developing, increasing the life and overall functionality of the walker. 4. The front wheels utilize a caster and <b>bushing</b> <b>assembly</b> that makes turning and maneuvering through the sand easier...|$|E
5000|$|C type presses have a {{bed plate}} {{which is used}} to lock the die bottom bolster. For locking the die, T bolts are used and so this plate contain 'T - slots into which t- bolts are slid in. These slots are placed diagonally and with a slot {{horizontal}} to the longer side of the plate, is the general practice. These slots run up to a central hole made in the plate, the hole being large enough to accommodate another bush with a hole, the hole being used for dropping the punched part {{to the bottom of the}} press. The top of the tool butted against a vertical sliding ram with a clamping system which accommodates only a particular diameter of a threaded cylindrical member called the [...] "shank" [...] of the tool. The bottom portion of the tool is locked to the bottom bed plate and the top portion of the tool is locked to the sliding ram. Top and bottom portions of the tool are generally guided by suitable pillar and <b>bush</b> <b>assemblies,</b> which gives safety to the punching elements of the tool.|$|R

40|$|Environmental and {{commercial}} considerations are strongly driving research into weight saving in aircraft. In this research, innovative manufacturing processes {{were developed to}} produce lightweight titanium alloy bearings capable of withstanding high bearing pressures. This will enable the replacement of heavier conventional bearing materials with titanium alloy bearings {{of the same size}} thereby saving weight. Plasma processing and PVD coating techniques were refined and combined and a sound scientific understanding of the resulting novel processes developed to assure high performance, reliability and repeatability. These techniques were applied to test discs and small bearing (bush) samples, which were tested under progressively greater loads (pressures).

40|$|Automatic {{assembly}} systems plays {{vital role}} in automating production process. They directly affect production efficiency {{and quality of the}} goods. According to the statistical analysis, 30 - 60 % of the tasks in most of the industries branches are assembly operations. Part assembling time takes 35 - 40 % of all manufacture time. Around 33 % of all assembly operations are peg to <b>bush</b> <b>assembly</b> operations. Because of that, assembly operation has big potential in reducing manufacture time by improving assembly methods and installing automatic part assembly systems and devices. This work investigates a new approach of passive vibratory part alignment method using elastic vibrations. In this method bush placed on the assembly plane and is free to move in a narrow space. Another component (peg) fixed in a gripper, which has piezoelectric vibrator in it. Vibrator presses upper end of the peg. Peg and a bush also pressed to each other with a predetermined force. Piezoelectric vibrator generates high frequency harmonic excitation to the peg and creates elastic vibrations of the peg in longitudinal and lateral directions. The lower end of the peg moves in elliptical shape trajectory. Because of the friction force between the components, bush moves to the part alignment direction. Parts successfully assembled after the alignment occurs. This passive alignment method allows assembling parts with circular and rectangular cross-section with no chamfers and at their axial misalignment of few millimetres, or makes it possible to use low accuracy robots Detailed analysis of scientific papers about widely used part alignment methods in a now days industry was done. Vibrations of the peg’s tip while he is in a contact with bush were investigated. Nature of the peg’s vibrations, their relationship to the excitation signal amplitude and bush-to-peg pressing force were determined. Part alignment experiments have been done with circular and rectangular cross-section pegs using their elastic vibrations. Influence of excitation and mechanical system parameters to the alignment efficiency and reliability were determined. Mathematical model of circular part alignment when the peg excited in axial and transversal direction were composed. Excitation signal and mechanical system parameters for the stable and reliable part alignment at impact and non-impact modes were determined...|$|R
