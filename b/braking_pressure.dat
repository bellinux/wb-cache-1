25|$|The braking system, {{adapted from}} the DS, employs disc brakes at all four corners (the DS has drums at the rear), with the front brakes being inboard, and cooled via large ducts on the front {{underside}} of the car. The hydraulic <b>braking</b> <b>pressure</b> front to rear balance is self-adjusting according to the weight {{in the rear of}} the car, so on hard braking the entire car lowers evenly.|$|E
25|$|Typically ABS {{includes}} a central {{electronic control unit}} (ECU), four wheel speed sensors, {{and at least two}} hydraulic valves within the brake hydraulics. The ECU constantly monitors the rotational speed of each wheel; if it detects the wheel rotating significantly slower than the speed of the vehicle, a condition indicative of impending wheel lock, it actuates the valves to reduce hydraulic pressure to the brake at the affected wheel, thus reducing the braking force on that wheel; the wheel then turns faster. Conversely, if the ECU detects a wheel turning significantly faster than the others, brake hydraulic pressure to the wheel is increased so the braking force is reapplied, slowing down the wheel. This process is repeated continuously and can be detected by the driver via brake pedal pulsation. Some anti-lock systems can apply or release <b>braking</b> <b>pressure</b> 15 times per second. Because of this, the wheels of cars equipped with ABS are practically impossible to lock even during panic braking in extreme conditions.|$|E
25|$|In 1920 the French {{automobile}} and aircraft pioneer Gabriel Voisin experimented with systems that modulated the hydraulic <b>braking</b> <b>pressure</b> on his aircraft brakes {{to reduce the}} risk of tire slippage. These systems use a flywheel and valve attached to a hydraulic line that feeds the brake cylinders. The flywheel is attached to a drum that runs at the same speed as the wheel. In normal braking, the drum and flywheel should spin at the same speed. However, when a wheel slows down, then the drum would do the same, leaving the flywheel spinning at a faster rate. This causes the valve to open, allowing a small amount of brake fluid to bypass the master cylinder into a local reservoir, lowering the pressure on the cylinder and releasing the brakes. The use of the drum and flywheel meant the valve only opened when the wheel was turning. In testing, a 30% improvement in braking performance was noted, because the pilots immediately applied full brakes instead of slowly increasing pressure in order to find the skid point. An additional benefit was the elimination of burned or burst tires.|$|E

Although many ways works with the black box, fuzzy logic will give powerful solution. The purpose of the research is looking for relation parameters between velocity and <b>brake</b> <b>pressure</b> of vehicle model that can be control to determine optimum brake distance of vehicle model by using rules base of fuzzy logic with verbose format. The step of research methodology are: determining space input variable of fuzzy logic i. e. : velocity and <b>brake</b> <b>pressure,</b> using fuzzy operator, using implication function, composing space fuzzy output of brake distance, and then processing of defuzzification. The result of this research has given optimum brake distance of model vehicle.

2500|$|Chrysler {{developed}} a unique braking system, offered from 1949 to 1953. Instead of the disc with caliper squeezing on it, this system used twin expanding discs that rubbed against the inner {{surface of a}} cast-iron brake drum, which doubled as the brake housing. The discs spread apart to create friction against the inner drum surface through the action of standard wheel cylinders. Because of the expense, the brakes were only standard on the Chrysler Crown and the Town and Country Newport in 1950. They were optional, however, on other Chryslers, priced around $400, {{at a time when}} an entire Crosley Hot Shot retailed for $935. This four-wheel disc brake system was built by Auto Specialties Manufacturing Company (Ausco) of St. Joseph, Michigan, under patents of inventor H.L. Lambert, and was first tested on a 1939 Plymouth.

2500|$|The V20 Camry {{originated}} {{from a time}} at Toyota when considerable cost and attention to detail was engineered into its cars such as high-quality materials and build quality to transcend the competition. Sedans retained the V10's rear quarter glass; however, the styling is less angular than before. To appease export customers, styling {{lost some of its}} Japanese legacy in its transition to a more Americanized design, with a softer and sleeker silhouette. Toyota designed the body with aerodynamics in mind, with performance of [...] for the sedan. V20 also features headlamps and a grille that are sculptured into a gently curved hood that partially conceal the windscreen wipers, wind splitters up the ends of the windscreen, near-flush glass, and a third door seal to close the gap between the body and window frames. Body dimensions were largely unchanged from the previous model, including an identical wheelbase, although length increases [...] Basic sub-skin hardware is also closely related, including the platform and the fully independent suspension with a strut and a coil spring at each corner and an anti-roll bar at each end. Noise isolation is improved by mounting the rear suspension on a subframe akin to the Toyota Celica (T160) that had now switched to Camry-based mechanicals. As before, the braking package encompasses ventilated discs up front, conventional drums in the rear, upgraded to rear discs in some cars. The braking system has a tandem-type booster and diagonally divided hydraulic circuits. Wagons receive a load-sensing proportioning valve that grants greater <b>braking</b> <b>pressure</b> when laden and prevents wheel lockup under light payloads. Entry-level V20 wheel size increases from 13 to 14inches.|$|E

This alerts drivers of oncoming trains of the possibility of a derailed or parted rake which may foul other tracks (since <b>brake</b> <b>pressure</b> may have been lost for those reasons as well); at the locomotive, it is not possible to tell whether the loss of <b>brake</b> <b>pressure</b> is due to the pulling of the alarm chain.|$|R

5000|$|Electronic brakeforce {{distribution}} (EBD or EBFD) or electronic brakeforce limitation (EBL) is an automobile brake technology that automatically varies {{the amount of}} force applied to each of a vehicle's wheels, based on road conditions, speed, loading, etc. Always coupled with anti-lock braking systems (ABS), EBD can apply more or less <b>braking</b> <b>pressure</b> to each wheel {{in order to maximize}} stopping power whilst maintaining vehicular control. [...] Typically, the front end carries the most weight and EBD distributes less <b>braking</b> <b>pressure</b> to the rear brakes so the rear brakes do not lock up and cause a skid.

50|$|Wheel speed {{transducers}} in each {{main wheel}} axle induce an AC frequency on the DC voltage input proportionate to the wheel speed as they are driven by the wheels. This frequency is compared to a normal deceleration curve and if it deviates it activates a small torque motor in the affected wheel control valve which shunts <b>braking</b> <b>pressure</b> to the return line {{by means of a}} spool valve.

50|$|The {{sole purpose}} of the VDC program is to prevent or {{minimise}} the risks of a potential accident. Up to ten computer systems monitor all four wheels {{in addition to the}} driver's steering, throttle and braking input, in real time. Should the VDC system detect a loss of traction, the ESC and TCS components automatically apply <b>braking</b> <b>pressure</b> and reduce engine speed to prevent oversteer or understeer, ensuring that the driver remains in control. Should the driver apply the brakes in an emergency, the ABS component prevents the wheels from locking up, while EBD assigns appropriate brake force to each wheel and BA increases <b>braking</b> <b>pressure</b> to bring the car to a safe and complete stop. The HHA component prevents the car from rolling backwards whilst on a hill, should the brake pedal be released.|$|E
50|$|It {{works by}} {{applying}} <b>braking</b> <b>pressure</b> asymmetrically despite physically difficult conditions (e.g. the car swerving towards {{the inside of}} the bend when the wheel load changes).

50|$|Emergency brake assist (EBA) or Brake Assist (BA or BAS) is {{a generic}} term for an {{automobile}} braking technology that increases <b>braking</b> <b>pressure</b> in an emergency. The first application was developed jointly by Daimler-Benz and TRW/LucasVarity. Research conducted in 1992 at the Mercedes-Benz driving simulator in Berlin revealed that more than 90% of drivers fail to brake with enough force when faced with an emergency.|$|E
50|$|All Iriz {{variants}} get Proton's VDC (Vehicle Dynamic Control) {{active safety}} net {{which consists of}} ESC, TCS, ABS, EBD, BA and HHA. Vehicle Dynamic Control aims to prevent or minimize the risks of a potential accident.

50|$|Although less common, rolling burnouts can be {{achieved}} with modified line locks by proportionally increasing the front <b>brake</b> <b>pressure</b> and the throttle to keep the car at a steady speed. This makes the rear tires slip and spin faster than the front tires and burnout.|$|R
50|$|EBS still {{relies on}} {{compressed}} air for braking {{and is only}} controlling the air through valves which means {{that it is not}} depending on higher voltages used by the electromechanical or electrohydraulical brake systems where electric power also is used to apply the <b>brake</b> <b>pressure.</b>|$|R
50|$|Following on {{from the}} Mercedes {{innovations}} ABS, ASR, ESP® and Brake Assist, this system is regarded as yet another important milestone to enhance driving safety. With Sensotronic Brake Control electric impulses are used to pass the driver’s braking commands onto a microcomputer which processes various sensor signals simultaneously and, depending on the particular driving situation, calculates the optimum <b>brake</b> <b>pressure</b> for each wheel. As a result, SBC offers even greater active safety than conventional brake systems when braking in a corner or on a slippery surface. A high-pressure reservoir and electronically controllable valves ensure that maximum <b>brake</b> <b>pressure</b> is available much sooner. Moreover, the system offers innovative additional functions to reduce the driver’s workload. These include Traffic Jam Assist, Soft-Stop.|$|R
50|$|In {{a broader}} scope, {{trailing}} off the <b>braking</b> <b>pressure</b> either while straight line braking or, as above, after turn in has begun, {{allows for a}} less abrupt and more accurate final corner entry speed adjustment. Some corner entries, such as decreasing radius turns, are more adapted to the leaned over trail braking technique. In turns where a quicker steering action is more applicable, trailing the brake while turning in is unnecessary.|$|E

Under hard braking, ESS is also activated to warn other motorists. The HHA component prevents the car from rolling backwards whilst on a hill, should the brake pedal be released. The new Persona is the second Proton model to receive the VDC program as standard, after the Iriz. The BH Persona is also the first Proton to get front parking sensors as standard. The two front sensors, located just below the headlamps, complement the twin sensors on the rear bumper.|$|E
50|$|Vehicle wheels may lock-up due to {{excessive}} wheel torque over tire-road friction forces available, caused by too much hydraulic line pressure. The ABS monitors wheel speeds and releases pressure on individual wheel brake lines, rapidly pulsing individual brakes to prevent lock-up. During heavy braking, preventing wheel lock-up helps the driver maintain steering control. Four channel ABS systems have an individual brake line {{for each of}} the four wheels, enabling different <b>braking</b> <b>pressure</b> on different road surfaces. Three channel systems are equipped with a sensor for each wheel, but control the rear brakes as a single unit. For example, less <b>braking</b> <b>pressure</b> is needed to lock a wheel on ice than a wheel which is on bare asphalt. If the left wheels are on asphalt and the right wheels are on ice, during an emergency stop, ABS detects the right wheels about to lock and reduces braking force on the right front wheel. Four channel systems also reduce brake force on the right rear wheel, while a three channel system would also reduce force on both back wheels. Both systems help avoid lock-up and loss of vehicle control.|$|E
25|$|Use of {{distributed}} power (i.e., {{remotely controlled}} locomotive units mid-train and/or {{at the rear}} end) mitigates somewhat the time-lag problem with long trains, because a telemetered radio signal from the engine operator in the front locomotive commands the distant units to initiate <b>brake</b> <b>pressure</b> reductions that propagate quickly through nearby cars.|$|R
