They decided the prescriptive method used by the fire service should be replaced by a more flexible fire risk assessment approach and consequently the Fire Precautions (Workplace) Regulations 1997 (SI 1997/1840) was placed on the statute books using section 12 of the 1971 Act. They also wanted the responsibility of implementing the legislation to be removed from the fire service and placed on the employers, but the fire service would be the enforcing authority for the legislation. It was implemented using the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations, 1992 (MHSAW) (replaced in 1999).|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{effectiveness}} of bracing on preventing curve progression in coronal plane for mild and moderate adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) patients {{has been confirmed}} by previous radiographic researches. However, a hypokyphotic effect on the sagittal plane has been reported by a few studies. A relatively increasing number of AIS patients were noticed to wear {{a new kind of}} elastic orthotic belt for the treatments of scoliosis without doctors' instructions. We postulate the correcting mechanism of this new appliance may cause flattening of the spine. To our knowledge, no study has investigated the effects of this new orthosis on the sagittal profile of AIS patients. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate and compare the effects of elastic orthotic <b>belt</b> <b>and</b> Milwaukee <b>brace</b> on the sagittal alignment in AIS patients. Methods Twenty-eight female AIS patients with mild or moderate thoracic curves were included in this study. Standing full-length lateral radiographs were obtained in three conditions: natural standing posture without any treatment, with elastic orthotic <b>belt</b> <b>and</b> with Milwaukee <b>brace.</b> Thoracic kyphosis (TK), lumber lordosis (LL) and pelvic incidence (PI) were measured and compared between the above three conditions. Results Both elastic orthotic <b>belt</b> <b>and</b> Milwaukee <b>brace</b> can lead to significant decrease of TK, however, the decrease of TK after wearing elastic orthotic belt is significantly larger than that after wearing Milwaukee brace. Compared with no treatment, LL was found to be significantly smaller after wearing Milwaukee brace, however, such significant decrease was not noted after wearing elastic orthotic belt. No significant changes were observed for the PI between 3 conditions. Conclusions The elastic orthotic belt could lead to more severe thoracic hypokyphosis when compared with Milwaukee brace. This belt may not be a suitable conservative method for the treatment of mild and moderate AIS patients. </p...|$|R

He was very politically active during the 1970s working {{for a variety of}} Theatre in Education companies including national touring work with Brian Way, and several years with the Wearabout Theatre Company in Sunderland. As {{an active member of the}} Workers Revilutionary Party, he was latterly drawn to the political theatre company <b>Belt</b> <b>and</b> <b>Braces</b> run by Gareth Richards, and appeared in their West End run of 'Accidental Death if an Anarchist' by Dario Fo. When questioned as to his motives for entering into a west end show, given his political convictions, Gavin replied, [...] " [...] I have three reasons for doing this show. The first is financial, the second is economic, and the third is I'm doing it for the money". This was characteristic of his general self deprecating humor. He met and latterly married his wife, Teresa, a formidable Northern Irish woman, in 1974. They remained together until his death in 2002. He was a warm and generous human being with a tremendous sense of humour. The world and the business is a worser place for his absence.|$|E

50|$|The Service Dress uniform {{continued}} to be the field uniform of the British Army until shortly before the Second World War, although many units {{continued to}} wear it {{after the start of}} hostilities and many Home Guard personnel wore it throughout the War. Service Dress was officially replaced as the standard combat uniform of the British and Canadian Armies in 1939, with the introduction of Battle Dress. Service Dress {{continued to be}} used by officers throughout the war, as a walking out dress and for semi-formal functions. Senior officers might rarely be seen in any other uniform. The Sam Browne belt had been replaced as carrying equipment for officers by the '37 Pattern web equipment but continued to be worn with the Service Dress, usually reduced to the <b>belt</b> <b>and</b> one <b>brace</b> (worn as a cross strap), though a frog or pistol holster might be added as needed).|$|R
40|$|The {{responses}} of composite buildings under wind loads clearly become more critical as the building becomes taller, less stiff and more lightweight. When the composite building increases in height, the stiffness {{of the structure}} becomes more important factor <b>and</b> introduction to <b>belt</b> truss <b>and</b> outrigger system {{is often used to}} provide sufficient lateral stiffness to the structure. Most of the research works to date is limited to reinforced concrete building with outrigger system of concrete structure, simple building plan layout, single height of a building, one direction wind and single level of outrigger arrangement. There is a scarcity in research works about the effective position of outrigger level on composite buildings under lateral wind loadings when the building plan layout, height and outrigger arrangement are varied. The aim {{of this paper is to}} determine the optimum location of steel <b>belt</b> <b>and</b> outrigger systems by using different arrangement of single and double level outrigger for different size, shape and height of composite building. In this study a comprehensive finite element modelling of composite building prototypes is carried out, with three different layouts (Rectangular, Octagonal and L shaped) and for three different storey (28, 42 and 57 -storey). Models are analysed for dynamic cyclonic wind loads with various combination of steel <b>belt</b> <b>and</b> outrigger bracings. It is concluded that the effectiveness of the single and double level steel <b>belt</b> <b>and</b> outrigger <b>bracing</b> are varied based on their positions for different size, shape and height of composite building...|$|R
5000|$|In {{front of}} the hotel was a long hut-type building. There was one guard, who was silently killed by Danish {{commando}} Anders Lassen, using the commando knife he carried. This annexe comprised a corridor and six rooms wherein were five sleeping Germans, none found to be officers. The men were roused and taken outside [...] whereafter the Commandos decided to go on to the hotel and capture more of the enemy. To minimise the guard left with the captives, the Commandos tied the prisoners' hands with the six-foot toggle ropes each carried, and required them to hold up their trousers. The practice of removing <b>belts</b> and/or <b>braces</b> <b>and</b> tearing open the fly was quite a common technique the Commandos used to make it as difficult as possible for captives to run away. Most of the prisoners when captured were dressed for sleeping, one was naked and were not allowed to dress.|$|R

40|$|Injuries {{are common}} for {{participants}} {{in sport and}} exercise. To help with the rehabilitation process, athletes often tape or brace the injured area. Athletes also continue to use tape <b>and</b> <b>braces</b> beyond rehabilitation periods, or without a prior injury for preventative reasons. However, the evidence for the benefits of taping <b>and</b> <b>bracing</b> beyond rehabilitation is mixed. So far research has struggled to identify clear physical (e. g., joint stability) benefits {{regarding the use of}} taping <b>and</b> <b>bracing</b> in sport <b>and</b> exercise. Research has started to demonstrate, though, that athletes consistently report improved confidence, support, and reassurance by taping or bracing an area of their bodies, regardless of whether the area is injured. These results have prompted further study into the psychological benefits of taping <b>and</b> <b>bracing</b> in sport <b>and</b> exercise. This study further explored the psychological effects of taping <b>and</b> <b>bracing</b> for athletes that do and do not tape or brace when participating in sport or exercise. Using previous research, a survey was developed to explore perceptions of the taping <b>and</b> <b>bracing</b> habits of athletes from a variety of sports and exercise (N= 136). Independent sample t-tests and one-way ANOVAs were performed to test a number of research questions and hypotheses. The results indicated that participants who taped or braced reported psychological benefits to taping/bracing, regardless of a number of factors. Conversely, individuals who chose not to tape/brace didn’t expect taping/bracing to be effective. Hence, athletes may choose to tape or brace due to perceived rather than actual benefits. These results are discussed in terms of how misinformation may influence choices around use. Health care providers may also need to consider how taping/bracing affects athletes when assisting athletes to return to their sport or exercise...|$|R
