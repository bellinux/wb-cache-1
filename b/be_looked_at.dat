On 4 March 2008, the EU requested countries to place BZP under control within a year and France complied in May 2008.|$|E

5|$|Mells' war {{dead were}} first commemorated by a stone tablet {{on a wall}} in St Andrew's Church, {{designed}} by the Kensington School of Art and listing the names of 14 villagers. The idea for a larger, public memorial originated with the Horner family, who called a public meeting to discuss the possibilities. The participants first considered whether the memorial should be something with a utilitarian function or something purely monumental. Suggestions for utilitarian memorials included benches, a fountain, a garden, and a children's playground, but they felt that the memorial should be something to <b>be</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> and admired. After discussing various potential locations, including St Andrew's churchyard, they decided that the memorial {{should be on the}} road in a prominent position where it would be obvious to passers-by.|$|E

These reference model can be constructed in layers, and offer a foundation for the analysis of service components, technology, data, and performance.|$|E
25|$|Animal {{husbandry}} and Integrated Crop Management (ICM) {{often are}} just two branches of one agricultural enterprise. In modern agriculture, animal husbandry and crop production must be understood as interlinked sectors which cannot <b>be</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> in isolation, as the context of agricultural systems leads to tight interdependencies. Uncoupling animal husbandry from arable production (too high stocking rates) is therefore not considered {{in accordance with the}} principles and objectives of Integrated Farming (Lütke Entrup et al., 1998 1). Accordingly, holistic concepts for Integrated Farming or Integrated Farm Management such as the EISA Integrated Farming Framework, and the concept of sustainable agriculture are increasingly developed, promoted and implemented at the global level.|$|E

25|$|Lenders {{argue that}} the real estate attorney's fee, for example, is a {{pass-through}} cost, not a cost of the lending. In effect, they are arguing that the attorney's fee is a separate transaction and {{not a part of}} the loan. Consumer advocates argue that this would be true if the customer is free to select which attorney is used. If the lender insists, however, on using a specific attorney, the cost should <b>be</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> as a component of the total cost of doing business with that lender. This area is made more complicated by the practice of contingency fees – for example, when the lender receives money from the attorney and other agents to be the one used by the lender. Because of this, U.S. regulators require all lenders to produce an affiliated business disclosure form which shows the amounts paid between the lender and the appraisal firms, attorneys, etc.|$|E
25|$|Two Players: In this variation, {{the cards}} are not dealt at the {{beginning}} of the game. Instead, the deck is placed face down and the players take turns drawing two cards with each turn. Once drawn, players must choose one card of the pair to discard and one to keep. This continues until the deck is exhausted after which, each player will possess 13 cards. The game then proceeds normally. :A variation of this deal is to decide whether or not to keep the first card drawn. If the player decides to keep the first card, the second card may <b>be</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at,</b> but must be discarded. If the player decides to discard the first card, the second card must be kept. This variation introduces a greater degree of chance into the game. To add an even greater degree of chance, forbid viewing of the second card if the first card is kept. This gives both players less certainty as to which cards their opponent is holding.|$|E
25|$|The {{inherent}} tendency test theoretically {{has a lower}} threshold {{than the}} real risk test, thereby causing persons who are charged with scandalizing contempt to be convicted for the offence with greater ease. In Shadrake, Justice Loh identified two problems with the inherent tendency test {{as it had been}} set out in Wain. First, the High Court had said that the justification for scandalizing contempt was the prevention of interference with the administration of justice as opposed to protecting public confidence in the administration of justice. The former is the concern of sub judice contempt– that is, contempt relating to a case that is currently under consideration by a court– while it is the latter that is concerned with scandalizing contempt. Secondly, such a test indicates that the words in the impugned publication or speech are to <b>be</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> alone. This has the effect of ignoring the circumstances surrounding the utterance or publication of the words, and is excessively harsh.|$|E
