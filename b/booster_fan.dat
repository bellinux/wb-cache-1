40|$|A <b>booster</b> <b>fan</b> is an {{underground}} fan installed {{in series with}} a main surface fan and used to boost the air pressure of the ventilation air passing through it. To accomplish this objective, the fan is installed in a permanent stopping and equipped with airlock doors, a monitoring system, and interlocking devices between main and <b>booster</b> <b>fan</b> controls. The stopping and doors are used to prevent flow recirculation, and the monitors to ensure safe operation of the fan. A <b>booster</b> <b>fan,</b> properly sized and sited, {{can be used to}} create safe work conditions and allow the extraction of minerals from areas that would otherwise be uneconomic to mine. In deep and large mines with heavy emissions of air contaminants, the required quantities of air can only be supplied by using high pressure fans. These fans will inevitably induce significant losses of fresh airflow through the stoppings and doors. For well defined ventilation circuits, booster fans can be used to decrease the main fan pressures and reduce the leakage flows. However, this will require a good understanding of the correct ventilation practice, from planning to operation and maintenance of booster fans. The objective {{of this study is to}} investigate the conditions under which booster fans can be used safely and efficiently in underground coal mines. Specifically, the study is directed at (1) collecting reliable information on airway resistances and flow requirements from two large U. S coal mines, (2) collecting fan performance data from one or more existing coal mine where booster fans are used regularly, (3) monitoring the performance of booster fans in a laboratory model and an experimental mine, (4) developing a <b>booster</b> <b>fan</b> selection method to assist the ventilation engineer at the planning stage, and (5) training six M.

40|$|Centrifugal <b>booster</b> <b>fans</b> are {{important}} equipment used to recover {{blast furnace gas}} (BFG) for generating electricity, but blade crack faults (BCFs) in centrifugal <b>booster</b> <b>fans</b> can lead to unscheduled breakdowns and potentially serious accidents, so in this work quantitative fault identification and an abnormal alarm strategy based on acquired historical sensor-dependent vibration data is proposed for implementing condition-based maintenance {{for this type of}} equipment. Firstly, three group dependent sensors are installed to acquire running condition data. Then a discrete spectrum interpolation method and short time Fourier transform (STFT) are applied to preliminarily identify the running data in the sensor-dependent vibration data. As a result a quantitative identification and abnormal alarm strategy based on compound indexes including the largest Lyapunov exponent and relative energy ratio at the second harmonic frequency component is proposed. Then for validation the proposed blade crack quantitative identification and abnormality alarm strategy is applied to analyze acquired experimental data for centrifugal <b>booster</b> <b>fans</b> and it has successfully identified incipient blade crack faults. In addition, the related mathematical modelling work is also introduced to investigate the effects of mistuning and cracks on the vibration features of centrifugal impellers and to explore effective techniques for crack detection...|$|R

Testing on the 4. 0 MW Pilot Wet FGD unit continued this month with the Trace Element Removal test block (TER) as the Pilot was operated under forced oxidation conditions. With this testing, the mercury measurement (Method 29) studies also continued as investigations into various activated carbons, metal amalgams, and impinger capture solutions were conducted. Following these studies, a brief test of the Pilot High Velocity FGD configuration (PHV) was conducted. This test block will be continued {{at the end of}} the month after the Fall outage is completed. The 1. 0 MW Cold-Side Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) unit remained idle this month in a cold-standby mode. During this month`s outage, the inlet and outlet damper plates were sealed to isolate the SCR system from flue gas. Also, the internals of the heat pipe heat exchanger (HPHE) and catalyst reactor tower were inspected and cleaned so that the system could be available for future test activities. Monthly inspections of all SCR system equipment placed in this cold-standby mode, as well as the fire safety systems in the SCR building, will continue to be conducted by the ECTC maintenance department and will include manual rotation of the <b>booster</b> <b>fan...</b>|$|E

For certain offshore installations, CO 2 capture and storage (CCS) could be an alternative to decrease the CO 2 emissions. When opting for a chemical absorption CO 2 capture system, a heat source for the stripper reboiler is needed. Since most offshore installations are powered by simple cycle GTs, there is typically no steam available {{that could be used}} for stripper reboiler heat. A compact steam bottoming cycle could, in addition to providing the reboiler steam, partly or fully provide power from a steam turbine generator to the equipment in the CCS system, including CO 2 compressors, pumps, and flue gas <b>booster</b> <b>fan.</b> Three different steam cycle configurations were designed, modeled, and simulated. The design of the post-combustion CO 2 capture system is also presented but the main focus in the paper is on the steam cycle design. In addition to the energy and mass balance results, a weight assessment of the major equipment was done with the objective to come up with a simplified weight relationship for changes in the {{oil and gas}} installation size in terms of changes in total mass flow from the gas turbines.

40|$|Controlled {{recirculation}} {{has been}} used in the metal/nonmetal mining industry for energy savings when heating and cooling air, in undersea mining and for increasing airflow to mining areas. For safe and effective use of controlled district recirculation, adequate airflow to dilute contaminants must exist prior to implementation, ventilation circuit parameters must be accurately quantified, ventilation network modeling must be up to date, emergency planning scenarios must be performed and effective monitoring and control systems must be installed and used. Safety and health issues that must be considered and may be improved through the use of controlled district recirculation include blasting fumes, dust, diesel emissions, radon and contaminants from mine fires. Controlled recirculation methods are expected to become more widely used as mines reach greater working depths, requiring that these health and safety issues be well understood. The U. S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) conducted two controlled recirculation tests over three days at a Wyoming trona mine, utilizing an inline <b>booster</b> <b>fan</b> to improve airflow to a remote and difficult-to-ventilate development section. Test results were used to determine the effect that recirculation had on air qualities and quantities measured in that section and in other adjacent areas. Pre-test conditions, including ventilation quantities and pressures, were modeled using VnetPC. During each test, ventilation quantities and pressures were measured, as well as levels of total dust. Sulfur hexafluoride (SF 6) tracer gas was used to simulate a mine contaminant to monitor recirculation wave cycles. Results showed good correlation between the model results and measured values for airflows, pressure differentials, tracer gas arrival times, mine gasses and dust levels.

40|$|During the {{presentation}} I will discuss two examples from my practice that consider {{the relationship between}} materials that have been salvaged from the cusp of collapse, with their alternative interpretation activated through processes of resurrection encountered through crafted intervention. I hope to explore how a crafted intervention may be presented as a simultaneous interface between artist, maker, community, audience and end-user. The first example presents {{an image of a}} rusting auxiliary fan, also known as a <b>booster</b> <b>fan,</b> once used to boost the air supply into the development of new coal mine seams. The auxiliary fan is no longer in use and can be found above ground on display at Snibston Discovery Museum in Leicestershire. An inflatable sculpture called Ventilation Dress based on Snibston’s auxiliary fan is embellished with the dress design of the 1972 National Coal Queen. The vinyl sculpture is pumped with air and then is released in a constant cycle. The apparent breathing motion of Ventilation Dress is fundamental to its character, breathing life into past lives, objects, accounts, and communities and representing something from the inside that could otherwise be missed. The second example presents a sleeping bag discarded on a field after a music festival. This is the catalyst for an empathetic politics that attempts to bring a gesture of care through a crafted intervention to those without a home. The sleeping bags are washed, in some cases there is hand embellished decoration inside the form, giving it further individuality beyond the ubiquity of a commercial artefact. Challenging traditional art and craft hierarchical value systems through bringing a subtle crafted intervention to the displaced, the sleeping bag reveals unacknowledged and hidden materiality’s of communication between maker and homelessness. In the case of Ventilation Dress the artwork decontextualizes assumptions about the materiality and narratives of industrial archeology and fashion, while the abandoned sleeping bag is an industrially produced commercial object that is charged with new purpose and human touch...|$|E
40|$|The Office of Mine Safety and Health Research (OMSHR) {{investigated}} ways {{to increase}} mine airflow to underground metal/nonmetal (M/NM) mine working areas to improve miners' health and safety. One of those areas is controlled recirculation. Because the quantity of mine air often cannot be increased, reusing part of the ventilating air {{can be an effective}} alternative, if implemented properly, until the capacity of the present system is improved. The additional airflow can be used to provide effective dilution of contaminants and higher flow velocities in the underground mine environment. Most applications of controlled recirculation involve taking a portion of the return air and passing it back into the intake to increase the air volume delivered to the desired work areas. OMSHR investigated a Nevada gold mine where shaft rehabilitation was in progress and one of the two main fans was shut down to allow reduced air velocity for safe shaft work. Underground <b>booster</b> <b>fan</b> operating pressures were kept constant to maintain airflow to work areas, inducing controlled recirculation in one work zone. Investigation into system behavior and the effects of recirculation on the working area during times of reduced primary ventilation system airflow would provide additional information on implementation of controlled recirculation into the system and how these events affect M/NM ventilation systems. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health monitored the ventilation district when both main fans were operating and another scenario with one of the units turned off for maintenance. Airflow and contaminants were measured to determine the exposure effects of induced recirculation on miner health. Surveys showed that 19 % controlled recirculation created no change in the overall district airflow distribution and a small reduction in district fresh air intake. Total dust levels increased only modestly and respirable dust levels were also low. Diesel particulate matter (DPM) levels showed a high increase in district intake mass flow, but minor increases in exposure levels related to the recirculation percentage. Utilization of DPM mass flow rates allows input into ventilation modeling programs to better understand and plan for ventilation changes and district recirculation effects on miners' health.

40|$|The {{current trends}} towards {{increased}} coal production from seams at greater depth {{has led to}} increased demands being placed on the methane drainage and mine ventilation systems. This study has been directed towards the development of computer models to simulate and analyse the gas flows in methane drainage ranges and the airflow and pressure distribution in mine ventilation networks. The {{first part of this}} thesis describes the conventional techniques of methane drainage currently employed and the mathematical approach used to model gas flow in the methane drainage range. It also discusses how, when combined with measured underground data, predicted results can be used to assess the performance of the range. Subsequent analysis techniques will suggest measures that can be undertaken to optimise this performance and assess the effect of selective network reconfiguration. The second part of the thesis includes a discussion of the increasing application of <b>booster</b> <b>fans</b> in U. K. underground coal mines and a critical analysis of the mathematical methods used to model airflow and pressure distribution in mine ventilation networks. One particular method was adopted in a simulation model used to analyse networks with <b>booster</b> <b>fans</b> and specified face airflows. Both simulation models developed have been used to analyse representative underground methane drainage ranges and mine ventilation networks. The thesis concludes that the accuracy of the methane drainage models can only be guaranteed when developed in conjunction with suitable measured data. The mine ventilation model requires user guidance through the solution and analysis procedure. Results are presented in a simple graphical manner and this approach, rather than the 'black box' non interactive approach, is to be favoured in the analysis of mine ventilation networks...|$|R

40|$|Ventilation of {{underground}} mines {{is required to}} dilute and remove hazardous gases, control heat and provide oxygen for workers and machinery. Kahatagaha- Kolongaha mines, Dodamgaslanda was selected {{for the present study}} as it was restarted recently and therefore very little research has been done on air quantity and quality of the mine. The objectives of this research are to make a proposal to rectify the existing ventilation system and to upgrade the existing airflow system with modifications to the present system. A detailed ventilation survey was carried out by measuring the variations of airflow, pressure drop and humidity differences along four levels of the mine (i. e. 565 ft, 805 ft, and 965 ft and 1132 ft levels) and compared with the corresponding standard values which describe the permissible conditions to be met for working underground. The distributions of airflows, pressures and humidity in each level could be detailed on graphs and the areas where the additional air supplies were identified.

The control room emergency zone served by the CREV System consists of the main control room and the Train B Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) equipment room. The safety related function of the CREV System consists of a single high efficiency air filtration train for emergency treatment of outside supply air. The filter train consists of an electric heater, a prefilter, a high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter, an activated charcoal adsorber section, a second HEPA filter, two 100 % capacity <b>booster</b> <b>fans</b> in parallel, the Train B air handling unit (excluding the refrigeration condensing unit), and the associated ductwork and dampers. The electric heater is used to limit the relative humidity of the air entering the filter train. Prefilters and HEPA filters remove particulate matter, which may be radioactive. The charcoal adsorbers provide a holdup period for gaseous iodine, allowing time for decay. The CREV System is a standby system, parts of which also operate during normal unit operations to maintain the control room emergency zone environment.

On Friday 24 October, in the early afternoon the English Trader left the Thames for what would be her last voyage. By late afternoon she had reached Southend on Sea. Here the Thames estuary was wide enough for convoys to form up in relative safety. Convoy EC90 was made up of 20 ocean-going freighters, two or three coastal steamers and two Royal Navy destroyers, one of which was the ageing HMS Vesper. Convoy EC90 set off on its voyage in single file to start with, proceeding at a steady eight knots. For the English Trader this was close to her maximum speed with a crew who knew how to get the best from her, which the new crew did not. The convoy's route took it up the east coast of England and around the top of Scotland and down into the Atlantic Ocean. The English Channel was far too hazardous for shipping convoys {{at this stage of the}} war. By 3 pm, the English Trader's troubles had begun. She had been running sluggishly, which had been noticed by the crew members from previous voyages. She was now a least a half a mile behind the bulk of the convoy and HMS Vesper was enquiring for the reasons for the poor speed of the ship. The speculation from the more experienced crew members was that the English Traders coal-fired boilers, which were forced draught fed, required the <b>booster</b> <b>fans</b> to be precisely set. It was agreed that the ill-experienced new crew and the new chief engineer were unable to accomplish this.

40|$|A 3 D {{multistage}} {{simulation of}} each {{component of a}} modern GE Turbofan engine has been made. An axisymmetric view of this engine {{is presented in the}} document. This includes a <b>fan,</b> <b>booster</b> rig, high pressure compressor rig, high pressure turbine rig and a low pressure turbine rig. In the near future, all components will be run in a single calculation for a solution of 49 blade rows. The simulation exploits the use of parallel computations by using two levels of parallelism. Each blade row is run in parallel and each blade row grid is decomposed into several domains and run in parallel. 20 processors are used for the 4 blade row analysis. The average passage approach developed by John Adamczyk at NASA Lewis Research Center has been further developed and parallelized. This is APNASA Version A. It is a Navier-Stokes solver using a 4 -stage explicit Runge-Kutta time marching scheme with variable time steps and residual smoothing for convergence acceleration. It has an implicit K-E turbulence model which uses an ADI solver to factor the matrix. Between 50 and 100 explicit time steps are solved before a blade row body force is calculated and exchanged with the other blade rows. This outer iteration has been coined a "flip. " Efforts have been made to make the solver linearly scaleable with the number of blade rows. Enough flips are run (between 50 and 200) so the solution in the entire machine is not changing. The K-E equations are generally solved every other explicit time step. One of the key requirements {{in the development of the}} parallel code was to make the parallel solution exactly (bit for bit) match the serial solution. This has helped isolate many small parallel bugs and guarantee the parallelization was done correctly. The domain decomposition is done only in the axial direction since the number of points axially is much larger than the other two directions. This code uses MPI for message passing. The parallel speed up of the solver portion (no 1 / 0 or body force calculation) for a grid which has 227 points axially...|$|R
40|$|For {{an engine}} running at a {{constant}} speed, both exhaust and intake processes are periodic in nature. This inspires the muffler designer {{to go for the}} much easier and faster frequency domain modeling. But analogous to electrical filter, as per Thevenin’s theorem, the acoustic filter or muffler requires prior knowledge of the load-independent source characteristics (acoustic pressure and internal impedance), corresponding to the open circuit voltage and internal impedance of an electrical source. Studies have shown that it is not feasible to evaluate these source characteristics making use of either the direct measurement method or the indirect evaluation method. Hence, prediction of the radiated exhaust or intake noise has been subject to trial and error. Making use of the fact that pressure perturbation in a duct is a superposition of the forward moving wave and the reflected wave, a simple hybrid approach has been proposed making use of an interrelationship between progressive wave variables of the linear acoustic theory and Riemann variables of the method of characteristics. Neglecting the effect of nonlinearities, reflection of the forward moving wave has been duly incorporated at the exhaust valve. The reflection co-efficient of the system downstream of the exhaust valve has been calculated by means of the transfer matrix method at each of the several harmonics of the engine firing frequency. This simplified approach can predict exhaust noise with or without muffler for a naturally aspirated, single cylinder engine. However, this proves to be inadequate in predicting the exhaust noise of multi-cylinder engines. Thus, estimation of radiated noise has met only limited success in this approach. Strictly speaking, unique source characteristics do not exist for an IC engine because of the associated non-linearity of the time-varying source. Yet, a designer would like to know the un-muffled noise level in order to assess the required insertion loss of a suitable muffler. As far as the analysis and design of a muffler is concerned, the linear frequency-domain analysis by means of the transfer matrix approach is most convenient and time saving. Therefore, from a practical point of view, it is very desirable to be able to evaluate source characteristics, even if grossly approximate. If somehow it were possible to parameterize the source characteristics of an engine in terms of basic engine parameters, then {{it would be possible to}} evaluate the un-muffled noise before a design is taken up as a first approximation. This aspect has been investigated in detail in this work. A finite-volume CFD (one dimensional) model has been used in conjunction with the two-load or multi-load method to evaluate the source characteristics at a point just downstream of the exhaust manifold for the exhaust system, and upstream of the air filter (dirty side) in the case of the intake system. These source characteristics have been extracted from the pressure time history calculated at that point using the electro-acoustic analogy. Systematic parametric studies have yielded approximate empirical expressions for the source characteristics of an engine in terms of the basic engine parameters like engine RPM, capacity (swept volume or displacement), air-fuel ratio, and the number of cylinders. The effect of other parameters has been found to be relatively insignificant. Unlike exhaust noise, the intake system noise of an automobile cannot be measured because of the proximity of the engine at the point of measurement. Besides, the intake side is associated with turbocharger (<b>booster),</b> intercooler, cooling <b>fan,</b> etc., which will make the measurement of the intake noise erroneous. From the noise radiation point of view, intake noise used to be considered to be a minor source of noise as compared to the exhaust noise. Therefore, very little has been done or reported on prediction of the intake noise as compared to the exhaust noise. But nowadays, with efficient exhaust mufflers, the un-muffled intake noise has become a contributing factor to the passenger compartment noise level as a luxury decisive factor. Therefore, in this investigation both the intake and the exhaust side source characteristics have been found out for the compression ignition as well as the spark ignition engines. Besides, in the case of compression ignition engines, typical turbocharged as well as naturally aspirated engines have been considered. One of the inputs to the time-domain simulation is the intake valve and exhaust valve lift histories as functions of crank angle. It is very cumbersome and time-consuming to measure and feed these data into the program. Sometimes, this data is not available or cannot be determined easily. So, a generalized formula for the valve lift has been developed by observing the valve lift curves of various engines. The maximum exhaust valve lift has been expressed as a function of the swept volume of the cylinder. This formulation is not intended for designing a cam profile; it is for the purpose of determining approximate thermodynamic quantities to help a muffler designer for an initial estimation. It has also been observed during the investigation that from the acoustic point of view, sometimes it is better to open the exhaust valve a little earlier, but very slowly and smoothly, and keep it open for a longer time. Although the exact source characteristics for an automobile engine cannot be determined precisely, yet the values of source characteristics calculated using this methodology have been shown to be reasonably good for approximate prediction of the un-muffled noise as well as insertion loss of a given muffler. The resultant empirical expressions for the source characteristics enable the potential user to make use of the frequency-domain cum-transfer matrix approach throughout; the time consuming time-domain simulation of the engine exhaust source is no longer necessary. Predictions of the un-muffled sound pressure level of automotive engines have been corroborated against measured values as the well as the full scale time-domain predictions making use of a finite-volume software...|$|R
