However, because of accumulated damage in the specimen with repeated cycles of axial loading/unloading, the shear strength is prone to be underestimated. Therefore, considering two models which were previously developed for a siltstone and a mudstone, a generalized Multiple-step Loading Damage (MLD) model was developed to simulate ML-TCTs with various stress paths. Numerical simulations of generalized MLD model indicated that the margin between shear strength parameters determined by Single-step Loading Triaxial Compression Tests (SL-TCT) and ML-TCTs, increase with increasing rock strength. Moreover, the upper <b>bound</b> <b>values</b> for c′ and lower <b>bound</b> <b>values</b> for ф′ could be resulted for ML-TCTs with confining pressure in increasing manner.

40|$|Abstract- Classification of precise or point valued data is {{the regular}} {{practice}} in traditional approaches. If the data varies from point valued {{to a range}} <b>bound</b> <b>values</b> makes the classification complicated. In this scenario of uncertain data usual practice is to match the range <b>bound</b> <b>values</b> to single values by considering their mean or average. This approach however sacrifices {{the accuracy of the}} classifying the tuples to their associated class labels. The classical decision tree technique can be extended to handle the range <b>bound</b> <b>values</b> by considering the probability density function (pdf) over complete information of a feature or attribute. In this paper we propose distribution-based approach for classifying the uncertain data over decision tree. This technique is more accurate than traditional approach and incurs more computational cost. We produce empirical results supporting distribution based approach over traditional approach...|$|R

Find the bottleneck links of the second layer. Minimize the maximal load of all remaining links, but now without the bottlenecks of the second layer as well.

5000|$|A {{note about}} methodology: when using a {{topographic}} map to determine prominence, one often has {{to estimate the}} height of the key col (and sometimes, {{the height of the}} peak as well) based on the contour lines. Assume for simplicity that only the col elevation is uncertain. There are three simple choices. The pessimistic, or clean prominence, assumes that the col is as high as it can be, i.e., its elevation is that of the higher contour line nearest the saddle. This gives a lower bound on the possible prominence of the peak, ignoring map error; inaccuracies in mapping lead to further uncertainties and a larger error bound. [...] Optimistic prominence assumes that the col is as low as possible, yielding an upper <b>bound</b> <b>value</b> for the prominence. Midrange or mean prominence uses the mean of these two values. Mean prominence is sometimes referred to as rise. In Britain, where topographic mapping is more detailed than in many countries, it is customary to use a fourth method: interpolated prominence. The true prominence is estimated by visualising the three dimensional surface in the neighborhood of the col and interpolating between the enclosing contours.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{predominance}} of multicore processors {{has increased the}} inter-est in developing parallel Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) solvers. As a result, more parallel SAT solvers are emerging. Even though parallel approaches are known to boost performance, parallel approaches developed for Boolean optimization are scarce. This paper proposes parallel search algorithms for Boolean optimiza-tion and introduces a new parallel solver for Boolean optimization problem in-stances. Using two threads, an unsatisfiability-based algorithm is used to search on the lower <b>bound</b> <b>value</b> of the objective function, {{while at the same}} time a linear search is performed on the upper <b>bound</b> <b>value</b> of the objective function. Searching in both directions and exchanging learned clauses between these two orthogonal approaches makes the search more efficient. This idea is further extended for a larger number of threads by dividing the search space considering different local upper values of the objective function. The parallel search on different local up-per values leads to constant updates on the lower and upper bound values, which result in reducing the search space. Moreover, different search strategies are per-formed on the upper <b>bound</b> <b>value,</b> increasing the diversification of the search. ...|$|E
