5000|$|A <b>band</b> <b>collar</b> is a {{standing}} band-shaped collar that encircles the neck without a full turndown or a collar [...] "cape". It {{can be any}} height or [...] "stand", but is usually under 2" [...] at the front, {{so as not to}} push up into the chin. Variations of the <b>band</b> <b>collar</b> are the clerical collar, the mandarin collar and the cadet collar.|$|E

50|$|The Bell-boy Jacket is {{modelled}} on uniforms traditionally worn by hotel bell-boys and messengers, {{consisting of}} a very fitted waist-length jacket and a <b>band</b> <b>collar,</b> often double-breasted and trimmed with fancy braid or piping, and rows of close-set brass buttons. The cuffs of the jacket often have similar decoration. The style is based on 19th century military dress uniforms and drummer boys.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to regular Coast Guard uniforms, the Coast Guard Band is authorized wear of special ceremonial dress consisting of navy blouses with <b>banded</b> <b>collars</b> and shoulder boards, and a multi-colored aiguillette.

25|$|Though {{less common}} among men's suits in the west, other jacket styles feature no lapels. Jackets with {{mandarin}} collars, also called stand <b>collars,</b> <b>band</b> <b>collars</b> or choker collars, include Nehru jackets and various military dress uniforms, {{such as the}} British Army and US Marine Corps. Turndown collars, also called Prussian collars and ghillie collars, were once common on military uniforms and on the Mao suit.|$|R
25|$|Cadets at the U.S. Coast Guard Academy wear {{standard}} Coast Guard uniforms, {{but also}} wear two {{different styles of}} parade dress uniforms, similar to those worn by cadets at the U.S. Naval Academy. Fall Parade Dress Blue consists of navy blouses with <b>banded</b> <b>collars</b> and double rows of buttons, worn with matching navy trousers and a white peaked hat. Spring Parade Dress Blue substitutes white trousers in lieu of navy.|$|R
5000|$|Among the Eastern Orthodox Church and Eastern Catholic Churches a band {{collarette}} with no [...] "notch" [...] {{in front}} may be worn by seminarians, although the norm {{is still a}} standard clerical collar. However, as the cassock is more commonly, if not mandatorily, worn to classes, often a plain white shirt will suffice, or a <b>band</b> <b>collar</b> with no collarette. Slavic cassocks button to the side, and thus a collar is often pointless, whereas a Greek cassock buttons {{to the front and}} has a higher collar, so the collar prevents chafing—as was its original function under a cassock. Eastern deacons and sometimes subdeacons, but rarely readers or clerics, also wear a clerical collar, with subdeacons and readers often having a style with no notch, or a tab shirt with no tab. Most Orthodox clerics do not wear a clerical collar; those who do are usually to be found in Western Europe or North America ...|$|E
50|$|Since {{the late}} 18th century, {{merchant}} seamen and dockworkers have worn denim flared trousers, striped undershirts, knitted roll neck jumpers, and short blue peacoats. This basic outfit, {{paired with a}} thick leather belt, flat cap and clogs, was also a mark of identification for {{turn of the century}} criminal gangs such as the Scuttlers.On the more luxurious cruise ships and ocean liners, deckhands wore neatly pressed dress blues {{similar to those of the}} Royal Navy and USN, while waiters and cabin stewards wore white uniforms with a <b>band</b> <b>collar,</b> gilded brass buttons, and a gold stripe on the trouser leg. In wet weather, sailors wore oilskins and Souwesters, but contemporary fishermen generally wear a two piece yellow or orange waterproof jacket and trousers. Modern updates to the traditional look include polar fleeces, hoodies, baseball caps, and knit caps. Straw hats, sailor caps and tarred waterproof hats are no longer in widespread civilian use, but wool or denim versions of the Greek fisherman's cap remain common.|$|E
5000|$|While {{the men of}} the ad hoc {{battalion}} {{continued to}} attract more recruits—and in some instances impressing “known Yankees” into service, shaving their heads—Wheat worked through the Ladies Volunteer Aid Association of New Orleans to help uniform the Walker Guards, the Delta Rangers, and the Old Dominion Guards in red flannel “battle” or “Garibaldi” shirts and jean-wool trousers “of the mixed color known as pepper and salt.” For headgear, the men apparently retained their own broad brimmed hats of various earthy tones (except Henry Gardner’s Delta Rangers who were reportedly presented with gray or blue wool kepis and white cotton havelocks). Harry Chaffin’s Rough and Ready Rangers were reportedly uniformed in light gray wool jackets and trousers with matching kepis. [...] The Tiger Rifles received their uniforms from A. Keene Richards, a wealthy New Orleans businessman. Because he was “so impressed by their drill and appearance” at Camp Davis, Richards elected to outfit White’s company in the Zouave fashion, viz.: dark blue wool Zouave jackets with red cotton trim (no sereoul), distinctive red fezzes with red tassels, red flannel <b>band</b> <b>collar</b> shirts with five white porcelain buttons, and outlandish “Wedgwood blue and cream” one-and-one-half-inch vertically striped cottonade ship pantaloons that would become their signature. They were also provided with blue and white horizontally striped stockings and white canvas leggings.|$|E

5000|$|The final decree in {{this case}} was entered July 28, 1881. The {{decisions}} of the Court in Miller v. Brass Co., 104 U. S. 350, and James v. Campbell, 104 U. S. 356, were made January 9, 1882. Under those decisions and many others made by this Court since, the first and fourth claims of the reissue cannot be sustained. Although this reissue was applied for a little over three months after the original patent was granted, the case is one where it is sought merely to enlarge the claim of the original patent by repeating that claim and adding others; where no mistake or inadvertence is shown, so far as the short or sectional bands are concerned; where the patentee waited until the defendants produced their continuous <b>band</b> <b>collar,</b> and then applied for such enlarged claims as to embrace the defendants' collar, which was not covered by the claim of the original patent, and where it is apparent from a comparison of the two patents that the reissue was made to enlarge the scope of the original. As the rule is expressed in the recent case of Mahn v. Harwood, 112 U. S. 354, a patent [...] "cannot be lawfully reissued for the mere purpose of enlarging the claim unless there has been a clear mistake, inadvertently committed, in the wording of the claim and the application for a reissue is made within a reasonably short period after the original patent was granted." ...|$|E

With the release of their debut album Rockin' the Road in 2006 with independent record label Huba Records, the band garnered a good rotation of local radio play. Their second album Long Hard Road, released in 2009, fared much better and was widely played, including winning song of the month in May 2009 on a Texas radio station, Hoss the Boss with DJ Don Cudd, as well as coming in fourth for song of the year on that same station's yearly contest for 2009, setting an all-time record at that point for most fan votes of any one song {{in the history of the}} contest.
