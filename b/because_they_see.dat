Dash 8 built after 2009 can't use them. Few countries apart from Norway have such short airports. There is however no room for this at Hasvik, so the plan here and for some other airports with few passengers, is to use small planes with less than 20 seats.|$|E

25|$|Rabbi Arthur Waskow {{said that}} far from {{enabling}} antisemitism, most of the authors the AJC attacked (Tony Kushner, Adrienne Rich, and Daniel Boyarin, among others) are in fact major contributors to the renewal and revitalization of Jewish culture, cutting across the conventional Jewish diaspora and religious-secular divides. He holds that Rosenfeld and the AJC see no value in such contributions <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> Jewish value only in supporting {{the policies of the}} State of Israel. He also argued that the AJC has done far more to undermine Israel and its Jewishness than the questions raised by these intellectuals, by the AJC's support for some specific policy decisions by the U.S. and Israeli governments: especially the Iraq War, which has increased dangers to Israel, and the settlement {{of hundreds of thousands of}} Israeli Jews into Palestinian areas.|$|E

Van der Byl responded in a speech on 8 August which asserted that [...] "The terrorists who are trained and equipped outside our border and who invade our country with the willing help of other governments are here for a much wider purpose than the overthrow of Rhodesia. They are here to represent a force which sees Rhodesia as just one more stepping stone to victory over South Africa <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> South Africa as a vital key to the security of America, Europe {{and the rest of the}} western world." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to Australia's 2011 census, 1,140 people {{identify}} as Aboriginal Muslims, {{almost double the}} number of Aboriginal Muslims recorded in the 2001 census. Many are converts and some are descendants of Afghan cameleers or, as in the Arnhem Land people, have Macassan ancestry {{as a result of the}} historical Makassan contact with Australia. [...] In north east Arnhem Land, there is some Islamic influence on the songs, paintings, dances, prayers with certains hymns to Allah and funeral rituals like facing west during prayers, roughly the direction of Mecca, and ritual prostration reminiscent of the Muslim sujud. As a result of Malay indentured laborers, plenty of families in Northern Australia have names like Doolah, Hassan and Khan. Notable Aboriginal Muslims include the boxer Anthony Mundine and Rugby League footballer Aidan Sezer. Many indigenous converts are attracted to Islam <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> a compatibility between Aboriginal and Islamic beliefs, while others see it as a fresh start and an aid against common social ills afflicting indigenous Australians, such as alcohol and drug abuse.|$|E

2500|$|The job {{characteristic}} studies primarily focus on perceived {{job characteristic}}s, which are measured subjectively. [...] Nevertheless, {{it has also}} been shown that objective measures of job characteristics, such as how challenging a job is (i.e., job complexity) can also influence the relationship between core self-evaluations and job satisfaction. [...] Specifically, job complexity partially mediates the relationship between core self-evaluations and job satisfaction, such that a high CSE individual with a complex job {{will be more likely to}} be satisfied with their job. Similar to job characteristics, there is more than one explanation for this relationship. [...] It could be that people high in core self-evaluation are attracted to more complex jobs <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> an opportunity for greater intrinsic rewards. [...] However, it could also be the case that those with high core self-evaluations simply perceive higher complexity in their jobs. [...] Judge et al. (2000) measured job complexity using job titles and confirmed both of these explanations; finding that individuals with high core self-evaluations not only perceived higher job complexity, but were also more likely to hold complex jobs, which led to higher job satisfaction.|$|E
2500|$|Within a few years, Trafficante owned or held {{stakes in}} both The Tropicana and The Sans Souci (the only casinos {{which had been}} {{operating}} in Havana for several years prior to 1955). Both clubs served drinks and meals which just about covered the operating costs. The profits from gambling amounted to approximately $5,000 a day, after [...] "deductions". [...] It was suspected that he also had behind-the-scenes interests in other syndicate owned Cuban gambling casinos namely those at, the Habana Riviera, the Nacional, the Sevilla-Biltmore, the Capri and the Havana Hilton.

[...] "Bartenders don't drink, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> the consequences", Trafficante said at one point. [...] "I know the odds are stacked against the players." [...] According to a 1958 Treasury Department investigation The Tropicana casino (along with those at The Capri and The Nacional) were rumored to be using [...] "bust-out dice" [...] and [...] "rigged equipment."

[...] Discussing all the Titans rookies (including Ringer), offensive coordinator Mike Heimer-dinger said [...] "Right now, you can tell they're all rookies. But that's about it." [...] Ringer was one of three Titans rookies who remained unsigned trough July 20. Bruce Tollner, Ringer's agent, said of signing Ringer “We are continuing to talk with the Titans, and hopefully we should have something done pretty soon." [...] However, Ringer and the Titans agreed to a multi-year deal on July 21, 2009. His base salary is expected to be $310,000. Titans' running backs coach Earnest Byner said of the running backs, “Each one knows that they're competing for playing time and a position on this team, so there's something to be said about that.” He also said of Ringer, “Bringing in Javon has definitely added to the mix because, right away, guys know he's something to reckon with <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> what he's done out here." ...|$|E

2500|$|Contemporary Eastern Orthodox Christians often {{object to}} the dogmatic {{declaration}} of her immaculate conception as an [...] "over-elaboration" [...] of the faith and <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> it as too closely connected with a particular interpretation {{of the doctrine of}} ancestral sin. All the same, the historical and authentic tradition of Mariology in Byzantium took its historical point of departure from Sophronios, Damascene, and their imitators. The most famous Eastern Orthodox theologian to imply Mary's Immaculate Conception was St. Gregory Palamas. Though many passages from his works were long known to extol and attribute to Mary a Christlike holiness in her human nature, traditional objections to Palamas' disposition toward the Immaculate Conception typically rely on a poor understanding of his doctrine of [...] "the purification of Mary" [...] at the Annunciation. Not only did he explicitly cite St. Gregory Nazianzen for his understanding of Jesus' purification at His baptism and Mary's at the Annunciation, but Theophanes of Nicaea, Joseph Bryennius, and Gennadios Scholarios all explicitly placed Mary's Conception as the first moment of her all-immaculate participation in the divine energies {{to such a degree that}} she was always completely without spot and graced. In addition to Emperor Manuel II and Gennadius Scholarius, St. Mark of Ephesus also fervently defended Mary's title as [...] "prepurified" [...] against the Dominican, Manuel Calecas, who was perhaps promoting thomistic Mariology that denied Mary's all-holiness from the first moment of her existence.|$|E

Ballinger told Backstage: [...] "It's sort of like an Andy Kaufman thing. You wouldn't believe the hate mail. ... You would never say that stuff to someone's face, but you can type anything online." [...] TheaterJones commented that [...] "perhaps because the Internet is some crazy postmodern distortion of reality, people ... felt it was their duty to point out how woefully untalented [...] was, in the most horrific ways. ... Her hate mail, which she reads some of on stage, is an art form all its own." [...] Ballinger noted: [...] "The whole reason Miranda went viral is because people were making fun of how stupid it was. If I didn't get hate mail, I wouldn't have a job." [...] The online critics were so harsh that Miranda became a [...] "hero of the anti-bullying movement". Her young fans find the character empowering <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>see,</b> perhaps selectively, [...] "a conservatively attired girl who does what she likes, gets lots of attention and has bottomless self-esteem." [...] Miranda also teaches that [...] "Popular girls don’t have to be stylish. ... Fear no one. ... It's [...] to be cranky." [...] An article at The Conversation observed that some YouTubers [...] "use humour and satire to challenge ideas of popular femininity. ...

2500|$|FACTNet has {{maintained}} a relatively low news profile since 1999, occasionally cited for speaking out against topics they consider important. [...] The 2000 film Battlefield Earth starring John Travolta stirred up controversy because {{it was based on}} a book by L. R.

[...] The Guardian reported on FACTnet's claims that the film was a proselytism piece for Scientology, noting: [...] "FACTnet suggested that subliminal messages had been cunningly inserted by Scientologists to win over new converts to join the church." [...] The makers of the film asserted that {{it had nothing to do}} with the Church of Scientology, but The New York Times reported on FACTnet's assertions that: [...] "..the film was secretly financed by Scientology, and that Scientology plans recruiting efforts to coincide with the movie's release." [...] Sociology professor James Richardson did not agree with FACTnet's claims, stating: [...] "I seriously doubt that someone is going to go out and join Scientology just <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> this movie."
