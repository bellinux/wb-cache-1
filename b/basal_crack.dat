In {{the case of}} a major <b>basal</b> <b>crack,</b> we show (i) that the usual form of Griffith's criterion is valid if elastic energy is stored in a shallow and hard slab only, and (ii) that rapid healing of broken ice bonds may lead to shear toughnesses larger than expected from tensile toughness experiments. In {{the case of a}}valanches resulting from failure of multi-cracked weak layers, where a simple Griffith's criterion cannot be applied, frequency/size plots obtained from discrete elements and cellular automata simulations are shown to obey scale invariant power law distributions. These findings are confirmed by both frequency/acoustic emission duration and frequency/size plots obtained from field data, suggesting that avalanche triggerings may be described using the formalism of critical phenomena...|$|E
40|$|Glaciological {{observations}} of under-flooding suggest that fluid-induced hydraulic fracture of an ice sheet from its bed sometimes occurs quickly, possibly driven by turbulently flowing {{water in a}} broad sheet flow. Taking the approximation of a fully turbulent flow into an elastic ice medium with small fracture toughness, we derive an approximate expression for the crack-tip speed, opening displacement and pressure profile. We accomplish this by first showing that a Manning-Strickler channel model for resistance to turbulent flow leads to a mathematical structure somewhat similar to that for resistance to laminar flow of a power law viscous fluid. We then adapt the plane-strain asymptotic crack solution of Desroches et al. (1994) and the power law self-similar solution of Adachi and Detournay (2002) for that case to calculate the desired quantities. The speed of crack growth is shown to scale as the overpressure (in excess of ice overburden) to the power 7 / 6, inversely as ice elastic modulus to the power 2 / 3, and as the ratio of crack length to wall roughness scale to the power 1 / 6. We tentatively apply our model by choosing parameter values thought appropriate for a <b>basal</b> <b>crack</b> driven by the rapid drainage of a surface meltwater lake near {{the margin of the}} Greenland Ice Sheet. Making various approximations perhaps relevant to this setting, we estimate fluid inflow rate to the basal fracture and vertical and horizontal surface displacements and find order-of-magnitude agreement with observations by Das et al. (2008) associated with lake drainage. Finally, we discuss how these preliminary estimates could be improved...|$|E
40|$|The fatigue {{behavior}} of structural {{components in the}} regime of very high cycle fatigue (VHCF) (10 ^ 6 - 10 ^ 9 cycles) has been attracting increased commercial interest as components are increasingly being called upon to perform in this regime of lifetimes. In VHCF, the applied stresses relative to the yield stress are very low. Therefore, it is presumed that {{a substantial portion of}} fatigue lifetime is consumed by the fatigue crack initiation process, and that cyclic plasticity only accumulates in microstructural neighborhoods that are susceptible to fatigue damage accumulation. Thus, microstructural heterogeneity is believed to significantly effect the fatigue lifetime variability. The very high cycle fatigue {{behavior of}} Ti- 6246 has been investigated using ultrasonic fatigue techniques, and lifetimes ranging from 10 ^ 6 - 10 ^ 9 cycles have been observed. Fatigue cracks initiate by facet formation within αp grains. It has been found that the facets form in grains that are slightly larger than average and that the facets appear to form by a process of slip since the facet plane normals are oriented approximately 35 - 55 ° with respect to the tensile axis. Three characteristic fatigue crack initiation sites have been identified. These initiation sites, ranked in order of increasing fatigue resistance are: surface, subsurface with isolated facets, and subsurface with contiguous transgranular faceting. The texture of the material in these initiation regions is favorable for basal and prism slip. This texture is derived from the prior β texture, and a mechanism of fatigue crack initiation resulting from strain incompatibility has been proposed. Fatigue crack growth experiments have been completed to measure the influence of local texture on the ease of fatigue crack initiation and the resulting fatigue crack growth rates. These experiments have found that the controlling microstructural dimension is on the order of 20 - 25 µm. The texture appears to affect initiation of fatigue cracks from notches as well. For notches placed within neighborhoods favorably oriented for <b>basal</b> slip, fatigue <b>crack</b> initiation will be encouraged. However, for notches placed within microstructural regions unfavorably oriented for <b>basal</b> slip, fatigue <b>crack</b> initiation will be inhibited...|$|R
