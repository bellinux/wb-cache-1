25|$|Physicists have <b>been</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> solar {{spectrum}} since Isaac Newton first used a simple prism {{to observe the}} refractive properties of light. In the early 1800s Joseph von Fraunhofer used his skills as a glass maker to create very pure prisms, which allowed him to observe 574 dark lines in a seemingly continuous spectrum. Soon after he combined telescope and prism to observe the spectrum of Venus, the Moon, Mars, and various stars such as Betelgeuse; his company continued to manufacture and sell high-quality refracting telescopes based on his original designs until its closure in 1884.|$|E

After Ronald Reagan became president, {{and after the}} attempt on his life on March 30, 1981, Nancy asked Quigley {{if she could have}} foreseen, and {{possibly}} prevented, the assassination attempt. Quigley answered affirmatively, saying that she could have done so had she <b>been</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time. At that point, Nancy Reagan enlisted Quigley's astrological advice on a regular basis, and held frequent telephone conversations with Quigley. Explaining why she turned to Quigley, Nancy later wrote, [...] "Very few people can understand what it's like to have your husband shot at and almost die, and then have him exposed all the time to enormous crowds, tens of thousands of people, any one of whom might be a lunatic with a gun.... I was doing everything I could think of to protect my husband and keep him alive." ...|$|E

40|$|In {{this lesson}} {{students}} will build on knowledge gained in the Hurricane Research lesson and the Hurricane Frequency and Intensity Lesson. Specifically, they {{will discuss the}} interaction (pathway) between a specific 'sphere' and the 'event' (hurricane). Working in groups, students will be assigned a specific sphere to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> more closely in relation to hurricanes. When all groups are finished, each will present their findings to the class for comparison and a closer look. If the group is assigned the Hydrosphere they will <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> oceans in the Live Access Server (LAS), if the group is assigned the Lithosphere <b>the</b> group will <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Land Surface in the LAS, if the group is assigned the Biosphere they will <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Biosphere in the LAS and the group that is assigned <b>the</b> Atmosphere will <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Atmosphere in the LAS.
