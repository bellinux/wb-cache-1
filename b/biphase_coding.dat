40|$|The present thesis aims {{to make an}} {{in-depth}} study of Radar pulse compression, Neural Networks and Phase coded pulse compression codes. Pulse compression is a method which combines the high energy of a longer pulse width with the high resolution of a narrow pulse width. The major aspects that are considered for a pulse compression technique are signal to sidelobe ratio (SSR) performance, noise performance and Doppler shift performance. Matched filtering of <b>biphase</b> <b>coded</b> radar signals create unwanted sidelobes which may mask important information. The adaptive filtering techniques like Least Mean Square (LMS), Recursive Least Squares (RLS), and modified RLS algorithms are used for pulse radar detection {{and the results are}} compared. In this thesis, a novel approach for pulse compression using Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is proposed. The 13 -bit and 35 -bit barker codes are used as signal codes to RNN and results are compared with Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) network. RNN yields better signal-to-sidelobe ratio (SSR), error convergence speed, noise performance, range resolution ability and Doppler shift performance than neural network (NN) and some traditional algorithms like auto correlation function(ACF) algorithm. But the SSR obtained from RNN is less for most of the applications. Hence a Radial Basis Function (RBF) neural network is implemented which yields better convergence speed, higher SSRs in adverse situations of noise and better robustness in Doppler shift tolerance than MLP and ACF algorithm. There is a scope of further improvement in performance in terms of SSR, error convergence speed, and Doppler shift. A novel approach using Recurrent RBF is proposed for pulse radar detection, and the results are compared with RBF, MLP and ACF. <b>Biphase</b> <b>codes,</b> namely barker codes are used as inputs to all these neural networks. The disadvantages of <b>biphase</b> <b>codes</b> include high sidelobes and poor Doppler tolerance. The Golay complementary codes have zero sidelobes but they are poor Doppler tolerant as that of <b>biphase</b> <b>codes.</b> The polyphase codes have low sidelobes and are more Doppler tolerant than <b>biphase</b> <b>codes.</b> The polyphase codes namely Frank, P 1, P 2, P 3, P 4 codes are described in detail and autocorrelation outputs, phase values and their Doppler properties are discussed and compared. The sidelobe reduction techniques such as single Two Sample Sliding Window Adder (TSSWA) and double TSSWA after the autocorrelator output are discussed and their performances for P 4 code are presented and compared. Weighting techniques can also be applied to substantially reduce the range time sidelobes. The weighting functions such as Kaiser-Bessel amplitude weighting function and classical amplitude weighting functions (i. e. Hamming window) are described and are applied to the receiver waveform of 100 element P 4 code and the autocorrelation outputs, Peak Sidelobe Level (PSL), Integrated Sidelobe Level (ISL) values are compared with that of rectangular window. The effects of weighting on the Doppler performance of the P 4 code are presented and compared. ...|$|R
40|$|In Wireless {{signals and}} Radar signals where power, real estate, speed and low cost are tight {{constraints}} and Doppler tolerance {{is not a}} major concern <b>biphase</b> <b>codes</b> are popular and FIR filter is used for digital pulse compression (DPC) implementation to achieve required range resolution. Disadvantage of low peak to sidelobe ratio (PSR) of <b>biphase</b> <b>codes</b> can be overcome by linear programming for either single stage mismatched filter or two stage approach i. e. matched filter followed by sidelobe suppression filter (SSF) filter. Linear programming (LP) calls for longer filter lengths to obtain desirable PSR. Longer the filter length greater will be the number of multipliers, hence more will be the requirement of logic resources used in the FPGAs and many time becomes design challenge for system on chip (SoC) requirement. This requirement of multipliers can be brought down by clustering the tap weights of the filter by kmeans clustering algorithm at the cost of few dB deterioration in PSR. The cluster centroid as tap weight reduces logic used in FPGA for FIR filters to a great extent by reducing number of weight multipliers. Since kmeans clustering is an iterativealgorithm, centroid for weights cluster is different in different iterations and causes different clusters. This causes difference in clustering of weights and sometimes even it may happen that lesser number of multiplier and lesser length of filter provide better PSR. In this paper few sample optimum <b>biphase</b> <b>codes</b> have been provided in tabular form with their optimum sidelobe supression filter (SSF) with optimum lengths and minimum multipliers to achieve low sidelobe level of - 35 dBto - 40 dB and have been compared against PSR achieved without clustering. Clustering is used in FIR filter for pulse compression and its effect is seen on peak to sidelobe ratio. This is being a genericmethod for FIR filters to reduce number of multipliers can be extended to other similar applications...|$|R

When ranging accuracy request is low or platform is particularly limited by power, the platform would perform both data transmission and range measurement with single-frequency modes. In this paper, the ranging resolution of MPPSK pulse waveforms with the match filter and impacting filter processing are discussed, respectively. Also, the parameter selection of MPPSK modulator for ranging is considered. In particular, requirements {{that allow for}} employing such special parameter values for range measurements with high accuracy and high range are investigated. Moreover, high repetition frequency (HRF) <b>biphase</b> <b>code</b> MPPSK pulse train base on m sequence is presented, and the ranging accuracy of the proposed signal with the match filter processing is deduced.

40|$|The linearized {{tracking}} {{errors of}} three Manchester (<b>biphase</b> <b>coded)</b> symbol tracking loops are compared {{to determine which}} is appropriate for Block 5 receiver applications. The first is a nonreturn to zero (NRZ) symbol synchronizer loop operating at twice the symbol rate (NRZ x 2) so that it operates on half symbols. The second near optimally processes the mid-symbol transitions and ignores the between symbol transitions. In the third configuration, the first two approaches are combined as a hybrid to produce the best performance. Although this hybrid loop is the best at low symbol signal to noise ratios (SNRs), it has about the same performance as the NRZ x 2 loop at higher SNRs (greater than 0 -dB E sub s/N sub 0). Based on this analysis, it is tentatively recommended that the hybrid loop be implemented for Manchester data in the Block 5 receiver. However, the high data rate case and the hardware implications of each implementation must be understood and analyzed before the hybrid loop is recommended unconditionally...|$|R
40|$|By {{introducing}} phase code into multicarrier orthogonal {{frequency division}} multiplex signal, the multicarrier phase coded (MCPC) radar signal possesses a good spectrum utilization rate and can achieve a good combination of narrowband and wideband processing. Radar pulse train signal not only reserves {{the high range}} resolution of monopulse signal, but also has the same velocity resolution performance as continuous wave signal does. In this study, we use the chaotic <b>biphase</b> <b>code</b> generated by Chebyshev mapping to conduct a phase modulation on MCPC pulse train so as to design {{two different types of}} multicarrier chaotic phase coded pulse train signal. The ambiguity functions of the two pulse train signals are compared with that of P 4 code MCPC pulse train. In addition, we analyze the influences of subcarrier number, phase-modulated bit number, and period number on the pulse train’s autocorrelation performance. The low probability of intercept (LPI) performance of the two signals is also discussed. Simulation results show that the designed pulse train signals have a thumbtack ambiguity function, a periodic autocorrelation side lobe lower than P 4 code MCPC pulse train, and excellent LPI performance, as well as the feature of waveform diversity...|$|R

40|$|Pulse {{compression}} {{techniques are}} used in radar systems to avail the benefits of large range detection capability of long duration pulse and high range resolution capability of short duration pulse. In these techniques a long duration pulse is used which is either phase or frequency modulated before transmission and the received signal is passed through a filter to accumulate the energy into a short pulse. Usually, a matched filter is used for pulse compression to achieve high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). However, the matched filter output i. e. autocorrelation function (ACF) of a modulated signal is associated with range sidelobes along with the mainlobe. These sidelobes are unwanted outputs from the pulse compression filter and may mask a weaker target which is present nearer to a stronger target. Hence, these sidelobes affect {{the performance of the}} radar detection system. In this thesis, few investigations have been made to reduce the range sidelobes using computational intelligence techniques so as to improve the performance of radar detection system. In phase coded signals a long pulse is divided into a number of sub pulses each of which is assigned with a phase value. The phase assignment should be such that the ACF of the phase coded signal attain lower sidelobes. A multiobjective evolutionary approach is proposed to assign the phase values in the <b>biphase</b> <b>code</b> so as to achieve low sidelobes. Basically, for a particular length of code mismatch filter is preferred over matched filter to get better peak to sidelobe ratio (PSR). Recurrent neural network (RNN) and recurrent radial basis function (RRBF) structures are proposed as mismatch filters to achieve better PSR values under various noise conditions, Doppler shift and multiple target environment...|$|R
50|$|Differential Manchester {{encoding}} is a {{line code}} in which data and clock signals are combined to form a single 2-level self-synchronizing data stream. In various specific applications, this line code is also called by various other names, including <b>Biphase</b> Mark <b>Code</b> (BMC), Frequency Modulation (FM), F2F (frequency/double frequency), Aiken Biphase, and Conditioned diphase. It is a differential encoding, using {{the presence or absence}} of transitions to indicate logical value. It is not necessary to know the polarity of the sent signal since the information is not represented by the absolute voltage levels but in their changes: in other words it does not matter which of the two voltage levels is received, but only whether it is the same or different from the previous one; this makes synchronization easier.|$|R
40|$|Knowing the {{waveform}} or pulse-compression {{technique of}} a radar {{is a very}} useful feature in Electronic Support Measures (ESM) systems. Classification of radars (and their platforms), deinterleaving radar pulses, and efficient/smart jamming are some purposes. As pulse-compression becomes more advanced, and the peak power decreases in favour of spreading the energy over time, classification of the waveform becomes more difficult as the diversity increases. Several different phase-modulations and frequency modulations exists and are in use, e. g. Linear FM Chirp, <b>biphase</b> and polyphase <b>codes</b> and Costas frequency codes. In this thesis an automatic modulation recognizer (AMR), originally developed for communication signals by E. E. Azzouz and A. K. Nandi, has been implemented in LabVIEW and adapted to classify radar intrapulse modulations. Testing showed that the algorithm successfully classified unmodulated-, LFM-, PSK 2 -coded and PSK 4 -coded pulses down to 7 dB SNR, and {{it is believed that}} even better results can be achieved by further tweaking of the AMR. The bandwidth of the receiver had a large influence on the key-features that were extracted by the algorithm. The AMR still needs to be tested on real radar signals. It is necessary to first develop a working carrier-frequency estimator and investigate the influence of inaccurate frequency estimation on the extracted key-features. Azzouz & Nandi also proved artificial neural networks (ANN) superior to the decision tree as classifier, and future implementations should by that reason use ANN's instead. ANN's were avoided here as time did not permit implementation. </p...|$|R
