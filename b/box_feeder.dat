40|$|Design {{revisions}} {{are expensive}} and time consuming. Yet, these are inevitable because product designers have limited knowledge about casting processes {{and have no}} means to evaluate the influence of design features on castability (costs, quality and productivity). Problems appear much later, at the tooling or manufacturing stage, when {{it is much more}} expensive to incorporate changes than at the design stage. Progressive engineering companies therefore rely on design review committees, which include tooling and casting engineers, to suggest early modifications to a product design for ease of manufacture. This paper presents an intelligent design environment to assist product engineers in assessing a part design for castability. The software simulates the way casting engineers decide the casting process, parting line, cores, mold <b>box,</b> <b>feeders,</b> gating system and mold layout, and analyzes each decision to suggest how the design could be modified to improve quality as well as reduce tooling and manufacturing costs. The software also facilitates electronic exchange of information between product, tooling and casting engineers, thus improving the level of communication between them and helping compress the total lead time to complete a project...|$|R

The objective of our research was to gain insights into the facility usage and behavioral needs of the hen over 24 h {{when there are no}} obvious restraints. Twenty ISA Brown commercial laying hens (Gallus domesticus) that were 18 wk old and not beak trimmed, were accommodated in a pen (4 × 6 m) at 19 ± 2 °C on a light-dark cycle of 10 L: 14 D. The pen providing nest <b>boxes,</b> drinkers, <b>feeders,</b> perches, sand, and wood shaving was designed to accommodate the hens for the experimental period. Video recordings were made for 10 d. Behavioral analyses were conducted on 5 birds for 5 d. Time spent on each behavior, log survivor analysis of events and inter-event intervals, bout analysis, diurnal pattern in events and bouts, occurrence of behavior in different segments and the corridor of the pen, and sequence analysis were performed to gain insights into the temporal and sequential structures of behavior. Hens spent 97 % of the day on nest use, preening, drinking, feeding, still, walking, perching, and resting; 43 % on commodity-dependent behavior; and 57 % not on commodity-oriented behaviors.

40|$|Many animals display {{seasonal}} {{patterns of}} behaviour and metabolism {{that can be}} also be observed in captivity. During an obesity-control program in Andean bears (Tremarctos ornatus) at Zoo Zurich, a seasonal fluctuation of body mass war observed once ideal body mass had been reached. The focus {{of this study was}} the question if metabolism of a male and three female animals was affected by seasonality according to their seasonal breeding behaviour, using data on pelleted food intake (from computer controlled feeders) and body mass (from regular weighing). The pelleted diet in the <b>feeder</b> <b>boxes</b> was provided additionally to a daily ration containing vegetables, fruits, pellets for environmental enrichment, and fish. This daily ration was adjusted, within prescribed limits, by the animal keepers depending on the previous day's consumption. Formulas developed for dogs were used to estimate the metabolizable energy (ME) content of the diet and maintenance requirement of the bears depending on their individual body mass. Energy requirements for minimum walked distances between the feeders was calculated as well as energy requirement for fat accretion or energy gained from body fat by body mass loss. Body mass showed a seasonal fluctuation with maxima in spring and minima in autumn, in contrast to the pattern typically observed in animals from the temperate zone; in the male, the body mass maximum occurred later than in the females. Feed intake from <b>feeder</b> <b>boxes</b> peaked in autumn, at the beginning of body mass gain in the females. These patterns cannot be explained as seasonal adaptations to climatic changes in the zoo environment, but match the natural breeding season of Andean bears in their natural habitat, suggesting genetically fixed photoperiodic clues. The data indicate that body mass fluctuation in a range considered ideal for the species was mostly based on the additional food whose amount was adjusted - within limits - by the keepers on a daily basis. Such adjustment, without incurring the risk of obesity in bears that are known as voracious eaters, {{is a good example of}} the skill required in animal husbandry...|$|R
40|$|Although {{the costs}} of parental care are at the {{foundations}} of optimal-parental-investment theory, {{our understanding of the}} nature of the underlying costs is limited by the difficulty of measuring variation in foraging effort. We simultaneously measured parental provisioning and foraging behavior in a free-living population of Zebra Finches (Taeniopygia guttata) using an electronic monitoring system. We fitted 145 adults with a passive transponder tag and remotely recorded their visits to nest <b>boxes</b> and <b>feeders</b> continuously over a 2 -month period. After validating the accuracy of this monitoring system, we studied how provisioning and foraging activities varied through time (day and breeding cycle) and influenced the benefits (food received by the offspring) and costs (interclutch interval) of parental care. The provisioning rates of wild Zebra Finches were surprisingly low, with an average of only one visit per hour throughout the day. This was significantly lower than those reported for this model species in captivity and for most other passerines in the wild. Nest visitation rate only partially explained the amount of food received by the young, with parental foraging activity, including the minimum distance covered on foraging trips, being better predictors. Parents that sustained higher foraging activity and covered more distance during the first breeding attempt took longer to renest. These results demonstrate that in some species matching foraging activity with offspring provisioning may provide a better estimate of the true investment that individuals commit to a reproductive attempt. 10 page(s...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Previous {{behavioral}} studies (Minichiello et al., Neuron 1999; 24 : 401 – 414) {{showed that}} mice deficient for the TrkB receptor in the forebrain {{were unable to}} learn a swimming navigation task with an invisible platform and were severely impaired in finding a visible platform in the same setup. Likewise, additional behavioral deficits suggested a malfunction of the hippocampus and proximally connected forebrain structures. In order to discriminate whether the behavioral impairment was caused either by deficits in spatial memory and learning, or alterna-tively by loss of behavioral flexibility, 8 trkB mutant, 13 wild-type, and 22 heterozygous mice were implanted with transponders and released for 21 days into a large outdoor pen (10 10 m).

Methane emission factors for termites are presented in units of lb CH 4 / 1000 lb termites/hour, and vary by species, which is accounted for by presenting emission factors for six different ecological regions. 1, 2 The emission factors are {{based on the results of}} laboratory tests which quantified emission rates per termite mass per hour. For example, one study removed nests from tropical forests and placed them in chambers. 3 The size and weight of the nests were measured, along with the weight of the termites in each nest and the CH 4 generated in the chamber. In another study termites were placed in glass jars, provided wood fiber, and maintained in ambient conditions within the jars in order to monitor CH 4 concentrations. 2 Methane concentrations were analyzed using flame ionization detector gas chromatographs. Emissions from a living termite mound which was maintained in a steel tank containing sand and soil, and connected to a <b>feeder</b> <b>box</b> were also studied. 2 To aid in using the AP- 42 emission factors to estimate CH 4 emissions from termites...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{grew out}} of a basic problem in the {{management}} of a "Nationally Endangered" New Zealand bird species, the stitchbird. Following European colonisation of New Zealand it is hypothesized that predation and severe habitat loss along with disease, extirpated stitchbird from the North Island and reduced the distribution to a single population on Little Barrier Island. Efforts to recover the stitchbird have involved many translocations to other islands. Three of these translocations failed and the remaining three populations only persist due to intensive management by the Department of Conservation, mainly through supplementary feeding and provision of nesting boxes, as a way of artificially enhancing the island habitats. The primary aim {{of this study was to}} determine the effect of habitat on stitchbird nesting behaviour and reproductive success. To investigate this, I conducted research that aimed to relate stitchbird parental provisioning, reproductive success and habitat on Little Barrier Island, the single self-sustaining population of stitchbird from where little information was previously available. I then examined these results with similar data from three other stitchbird populations (Kapiti, Tiritiri Matangi and Mokoia Islands) to assess the effects of management enhanced and unmanaged habitats on stitchbird. An in-depth analysis of habitat structure was then conducted in two of the populations (Little Barrier and Kapiti Islands). These data were then analysed with respect to the reproductive success of these populations (with Kapiti's reproductive success being taken during the period when there was little management). When all islands are considered, conservation management, through the provisioning of nest <b>boxes</b> and <b>feeders</b> led to a significant increase in fledging success. This habitat management did not affect paternal behaviour. Although maternal investment was highly variable between individuals, females showed increased visitation rates when their habitat was enhanced through conservation management. In the unmanaged populations habitat complexity and nest tree size were found to be very important to the reproductive success of the stitchbird. Regardless of management and location, habitat quality played an integral part in determining the pattern of parental investment, and significantly affected reproductive success. In the unmanaged populations habitat complexity may provide a proximate assessment of overall habitat quality, while nest tree size may influence the internal microclimate of the nesting cavities. It appears that in lower quality habitats, parent's trade off their own survival against current and future reproduction. Conservation managers have managed to offset the restrictions of low quality habitat by enhancing habitats to a higher quality than natural environments. Now there is a need to find new sites where self- sustaining populations can be established, without the aid of expensive conservation management. I have found that it may be important to consider not only the phenology of the habitat, but also its complexity and the availability of large potential nest trees when considering new translocation sites...|$|R
40|$|The {{major fire}} and fire injury {{findings}} for all metal/nonmetal mining categories for 1990 - 2001 {{are shown in}} tables 64 - 65. Table 66, partly illustrated in figure 22, shows the number of fires, fire injuries, fire fatalities, risk rates, employees' working hours, and lost workdays for all metal/nonmetal mining categories by time period. For all metal/nonmetal operations (including stone and sand and gravel), a total of 518 fires occurred during 1990 - 2001; 296 of those fires caused 308 injuries and 4 fatalities (Ewhr = 4, 012 x 106 hr, In = 0. 015, LWD = 36, 204). Thirty fires and 26 injuries involved contractors. The greatest number of fires and fire injuries occurred at surface operations; the highest risk rate values were also calculated for surface operations. The number of fires increased during the first four 2 -year time periods (1990 - 1991, 1992 - 1993, 1994 - 1995, and 1996 - 1997), then decreased {{during the last two}} periods (1998 - 1999 and 2000 - 2001). The number of injuries showed a decrease throughout the periods, accompanied by an increase in employees' working hours. Twenty-five firefighting interventions by mine rescue teams in underground mines and at least 30 interventions at surface operations were required to combat these fires. However, 45 fires destroyed or heavily damaged facilities and equipment (including 19 pieces of mobile equipment) because of failure of firefighting methods, late fire detection, undetected fires, or fire size. Ninety-seven fires were detected late, and 30 fires were undetected. The ignition sources that caused the greatest number of fires were flame cutting/welding spark/slag/flame (169 fires or 33 % with 137 injuries), hydraulic fluid/fuel sprayed onto equipment hot surfaces (89 fires or 17 % with 46 injuries and 3 fatalities), heat source/explosion and flammable liquids/ gas/refueling fuel on hot surfaces (98 fires or 19 % with 73 injuries), electrical short/arcing (51 fires or 10 % with 16 injuries), and spontaneous combustion/hot material (46 fires or 9 % with 17 injuries). The flame cutting/welding spark/slag/flame source caused fires usually involving welders' clothing or oxyfuel/grease and other materials (including chute and dust collector liners, flammable liquids, belt material, crusher, hopper and shaker deck materials, washer plants, equipment mechanical components, stampler breaker, hydraulic fluid, rubber tires and hoses, gear <b>boxes,</b> bin <b>feeder,</b> dump rope cables, screen liner and screen panel, kiln and shaft material, pipelines, liquor pumps, wood pallets, electrical junction boxes, handrails, grease, refuse, shop and wood). The spontaneous combustion/hot material and electrical fires were usually detected late due to lack of combustion gas/smoke detection systems. At least 55 of the 89 mobile equipment hydraulic fluid/fuel fires became large fires (requiring 12 mine rescue team interventions in undergroun...|$|R
