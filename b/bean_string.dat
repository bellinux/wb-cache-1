40|$|Introduction: Type 2 {{diabetes}} mellitus is deficiency of insulin and caused by decreases of insulin receptor or bad quality of insulin. As a result, insulin hormone {{does not work}} effectively in blood glucose regulation. <b>String</b> <b>bean</b> juice contains thiamin and fiber may regulate blood glucose level. The {{aim of this study}} was to analyze the effect of <b>string</b> <b>bean</b> juice to decrease blood glucose level of patients with type 2 {{diabetes mellitus}}. Method: This study employed a quasy-experimental pre-post test control group design and purposive sampling.   The population were all type 2 diabetes mellitus patients in Puskesmas Pacar Keling Surabaya. Sample were 12 patients who met inclusion criteria. The independent variable was <b>string</b> <b>bean</b> juice and dependent variable was blood glucose level. Data were analyzed by using Paired T-test with significance level of α≤ 0. 05 and Independent T-test with significant level of α≤ 0. 05. Result: The results showed that <b>string</b> <b>bean</b> juice has an effect on decreasing blood glucose between pre test and post test for blood glucose with independent T-test is p= 0. 003. Analysis: In conclusion, <b>string</b> <b>bean</b> juice has an effect on blood glucose level in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Discussion: The possible explanation for this findings is <b>string</b> <b>bean</b> juice contains two ingredients: thiamine and fiber. Thiamine helps support insulin receptors and glucose transporter in cells hence GLUT- 4 could translocated to the cell membrane brought glucouse enter to the  intracellular compartment, that leads to blood glucouse level well regulated.  Dietary fiber reduces food transit time so slowing the glucose absorption. Therefore blood glucose level will be decreased...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{years have}} {{witnessed}} {{growing interest in}} research on the structure and pro-perties of proteins and peptides as physiologically active dietary components. The above has spurred a new interest in the isolation of animal, plant and microbiological peptides and investigation of their biological activity. The isolation and separation of protein and peptide mixture {{is not an easy}} procedure. Immobilised Metal Ion Affinity Chromatography (IMAC) is increasingly often used in this process. Affinity chromatography relies on the specific interactions between amino acids, their reactive groups in peptides and metal ions. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine whether copper and nickel ions can be used for the separation of peptides isolated from <b>string</b> <b>beans</b> than had been blanched and he-ated in a microwave oven. In this study, peptides extracted with 1 % trichloroacetic acid (TCA) from <b>string</b> <b>beans</b> that had been blanched and heated in a microwave oven, were separated by chromatography on columns with copper and nickel ions immobilised thro-ugh iminodiacetic acid (IDA). Peptide concentrations of the separated fractions were deter-mined. Peptides found in <b>string</b> <b>beans</b> had similar affinity for metal ions in the Cu> Ni sequence, with selectivity in the Ni> Cu sequence. Microwave heating of <b>string</b> <b>beans</b> decreases the peptide content of extracts isolated with 1 % TCA. The resulting changes are dependent on the duration of the process and the type of heating medium. Affinity chro-matography with the use of metal ions immobilized to iminodiacetic acid (IDA) -Sephadex G- 25 may be successfully used for the separation of peptides isolated from <b>string</b> <b>beans...</b>|$|R
