25|$|Chopin {{appeared}} {{to express her}} belief in the strength of women. Marquand draws from theories about creative nonfiction {{in terms of her}} work. In order for a story to be autobiographical, or even biographical, Marquand writes, {{there has to be a}} nonfictional element, but more often than not the author exaggerates the truth to spark and hold interest for the readers. Kate Chopin might have been surprised to know her work has been characterized as feminist in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, just as she had <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> own time to have it described as immoral. Critics tend to regard writers as individuals with larger points of view addressed to factions in society.|$|E
25|$|Stafford {{returned}} to the French campaign during the 1430s, and, {{as a result of}} his loyalty and years of service, he was elevated from being Earl of Stafford to Duke of Buckingham. Around the same time, his mother died. As much of his estate had <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> hands for life, Humphrey went from having a reduced income in his early years, to being one of the wealthiest and most powerful landowners in England of his generation. His lands stretched across much of the country, ranging from East Anglia to the Welsh border. Being such an important figure in the localities was not without its dangers, and for some time he feuded with, and was being attacked by, Sir Thomas Malory.|$|E

500|$|Public {{reaction}} varied.

Her public approval ratings {{in the wake of the}} revelations shot upward to around 70percent, the highest they had ever <b>been.</b> <b>In</b> <b>her</b> 2003 memoir, she would attribute her decision to stay married to [...] "a love that has persisted for decades" [...] and add: [...] "No one understands me better and no one can make me laugh the way Bill does. Even after all these years, he is still the most interesting, energizing and fully alive person I have ever met." ...|$|E

A wise and witty teacher, two generations of Egyptologists have forever <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> debt." [...] Alongside teaching them, Murray was known to socialise with her UCL students outside of class hours. The archaeologist Ralph Merrifield, who knew Murray through the Folklore Society, described her as a [...] "diminutive and kindly scholar, who radiated intelligence and strength of character into extreme old age". Davidson, who also knew Murray through the Society, noted that at their meetings [...] "she would sit near the front, a bent and seemingly guileless old lady dozing peacefully, {{and then in the}} middle of a discussion would suddenly intervene with a relevant and penetrating comment which showed that she had missed not one word of the argument". The later folklorist Juliette Wood noted that many members of the Folklore Society [...] "remember her fondly", adding that Murray had been [...] "especially keen to encourage younger researchers, even those who disagreed with her ideas".|$|E

2500|$|In 1985 a {{group of}} investors headed by a local developer, Rick Butera, bought the Jerome for $6 million ($ in modern dollars) and began the {{restoration}} Gilmore had tried to begin 17 years earlier, a project that cost more than quadruple the purchase price. The structural system was restored. All the original finishes on the inside were brought back to their original appearance. On the outside, Bayer's paint scheme was blasted off in favor of the original brick. The last change was as popular with the community as the original paint scheme had not <b>been.</b> <b>In</b> <b>her</b> 1991 romance novel Aspen Gold, Janet Dailey praised the result: [...] "... once again, the Hotel Jerome stood in stately dignity ... no longer a symbol of Aspen's rich past but a vital part of its present."

2500|$|The {{opening track}} and lead single, [...] "Mr. Know It All," [...] {{features}} a steady four-four stomp, synthetic strings and drum-machine loops, with Clarkson's vocals being deemed as [...] "raw". It {{talks about a}} deceptive, arrogant man, with Rolling Stone remarking that [...] "Clarkson sasses a controlling man with double-entendres that up her R appeal." [...] The second track, [...] "What Doesn't Kill You (Stronger)", {{was described as a}} [...] "chilly" [...] electropop and [...] "glitter-disco" [...] song, about encouraging personal reinvention. Clarkson herself compared it to her 2004 hit single [...] "Since U Been Gone". The third, [...] "Dark Side", is a mid-tempo track about a longing to be loved and accepted unconditionally, while [...] "Honestly" [...] longs for the truth, even when it's hard. Clarkson wrote [...] "You Love Me" [...] following an incident that she thought would break her, which she described as the most hurt she has ever <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> life, and while writing about it she was able {{to get it out of}} her system.

2500|$|The rise of Slavophile {{ideology}} in the Russian Empire led Alexander II of Russia {{to search for}} a bride for the heir apparent, Tsarevich Nicholas Alexandrovich, in countries other than the German states that had traditionally provided consorts for the tsars. In 1864, Nicholas, or [...] "Nixa" [...] as he was known in his family, went to Denmark where he was betrothed to Dagmar. On 22 April 1865 he died from meningitis. His last wish was that Dagmar would marry his younger brother, the future Alexander III. Dagmar was distraught after her young fiancé's death. She was so heartbroken when she returned to her homeland that her relatives were seriously worried about her health. She had already become emotionally attached to Russia and often thought of the huge, remote country that was to have been her home. The disaster had brought her very close to [...] "Nixa's" [...] parents, and she received a letter from Alexander II in which the Emperor attempted to console her. He told Dagmar in very affectionate terms that he hoped she would still consider herself a member of their family. In June 1866, while on a visit to Copenhagen, the Tsarevich Alexander asked Dagmar for her hand. They had <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> room looking over photographs together.|$|E
2500|$|Determining {{the cause}} of death was inconclusive, as the severe {{decomposition}} on the body had removed all signs of possible violence from the remains. However, the case is believed to have been a murder, as suicide was eliminated as a possibility of the girl's death. The circumstances of the location of the remains had also sparked suspicion among authorities. Toxicology tests were conducted to see if any drugs or alcohol had <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> system, yet the results were never released. Although the body was found in autumn, she had died in the summer, two to four months previously. This was established by examining traces from insects that were found on the remains. She had an overbite, and some fillings and dental sealants were found on the upper molars with no current cavities. The overbite was not described as extreme, but may have been noticeable, which could be a reliable feature depicted in her facial reconstruction. The estimated height was between 4'10" [...] and 5'4", the victim being between fifteen and twenty-one years old and weighing between 110 to 135 pounds, at an [...] "average frame". Examiners believe she was either white or Hispanic, although Native American and Asian races cannot be ruled out. She also may have been biracial. Other physical characteristics included a healed rib fracture and being pigeon toed or knock-kneed, which may have been noticeable when she walked, as her feet were slanted inward. She also suffered from spina bifida occulta, but may have been unaware of the condition. To obtain DNA information, her femur was transported to the University of Texas.|$|E
2500|$|The curtain rises on Inspector Colquohoun and Sergeant Penny {{looking at}} the {{portrait}} of Ainswick, and discussing the estate's inheritance.

[...] Coulqouhoun states that ballistics evidence prove it was not the murder weapon after all. [...] At Coulqouhoun's request, Henry checks his collection again, and discovers that a second gun of the same calibre is missing. [...] Colquoun shows him the gun found in Veronica's handbag, and Henry confirms that it is one and the same gun. [...] Colhouqhoun then questions Gudgeon about Doris' earlier statement; Gudgeon confirms the event, saying he was simply up (having found the gun laying out), and had simply forgotten the incident. [...] Lucy enters, dismisses Gudgeon, and reveals that the butler has been attempting to cover for her – the gun had <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> basket of eggs, though she claims not to remember why. [...] When the detectives are gone, she confides to Henry that she had thought John might have an accident involving the basket, but that she would never actually go so far as to commit murder. [...] Edward and Midge soon find themselves alone on stage. [...] Edward's affections have changed, and he and Midge become engaged. [...] Lucy enters, and is delighted by the news. [...] Midge and Henrietta have a private conversation, and Midge begins to suspect that Edward has only proposed to create the illusion that he is not in love with Henrietta, which might be a motive for him to have murdered John. [...] By the time Edward returns, Midge is convinced of this motivation, and calls off their engagement. [...] Edward is distraught, and returns to the stage with a gun, clearly contemplating suicide. [...] Midge finds him, confesses her fears, and the two reconcile.

2500|$|The series seven opener [...] "Asylum of the Daleks" [...] (2012) shows Amy, {{still working}} as a fashion model, signing papers for her and Rory's divorce. In the episode, the Doctor {{engineers}} a reconciliation between the two during the mission, allowing them to discuss their feelings for each other. It is revealed Amy left Rory because she has been infertile since [...] "A Good Man Goes to War", and knew he wanted children. The couple continue traveling with the Doctor on small adventures in [...] "Dinosaurs on a Spaceship" [...] and [...] "A Town Called Mercy", but leave {{at the end of}} each to return to their normal lives. In [...] "The Power of Three", Amy says that the Doctor has <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> and Rory's life for ten years, and she now works as a journalist. The couple realise they have to choose between their normal lives and their life with the Doctor. They are inclined to choose the former, but Rory's father Brian (Mark Williams) encourages the pair to continue travelling with the Doctor. Their next adventure, [...] "The Angels Take Manhattan", is their last. In the story, Amy and Rory are threatened by the evil Weeping Angels, whose touch will send them into the distant past to die alone. Having witnessed this eventuality, they attempt suicide, creating a paradox which destroys all but one Angel, but also renders the area permanently off-limits to the Doctor's TARDIS. In the present, the surviving Angel sends Rory back in time, and knowing the Doctor cannot recover him, Amy allows the Angel to touch her too so she can be with him. Gravestones in a New York cemetery reveal that Rory died at the age of 82 and Amy died at the age of 87. River arranges for Amy to leave the Doctor a message in the afterword of a 1930s pulp fiction novel, where she says she is happy with Rory and that they worry about the Doctor travelling alone. [...] "P.S.", a mini shows-episode supplement based on the original script for this episode, shows that Rory and Amy adopted a son, in 1946, and named him Anthony Brian Williams. The actress reprised the role in [...] "The Time of the Doctor" [...] (2013), in which Matt Smith departs the series. During the Eleventh Doctor's regeneration, he hallucinates images of young Amelia Pond on board his TARDIS, before a vision of adult Amy approaches and says a final goodbye.|$|E
