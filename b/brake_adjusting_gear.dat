5000|$|The [...] "Aero-Eight" [...] Model 880 for 1920 was boldly announced: [...] "The Forecast of Future Fashions". The ad further bragged {{that there}} were 15000 mi {{possible}} on its tires. Available were only three body styles, all of them of an open type: A Roadster for 2 and a Speedster for 4 passengers at $2,750 plus a [...] "Tourster" [...] a.k.a. touring car for $2,850. But naming the product got even more creative. While [...] "Sportsedan" [...] and [...] "Sportcoupe" [...] might sound familiar in our ears, [...] "Sportosine" [...] and [...] "Tourosine" [...] for some closed cars definitely do not. These cars got adjustable, [...] "storm-proofed" [...] windshields that had an angled position. Cole switched to Johnson carburettors and introduced a one-piece rear axle and a <b>brake</b> <b>adjuster.</b> The <b>gear</b> ratio was 4.45 (until 1922). A new measure for power replaced the antiquated N.A.C.C. rating. Thus, the Cole V-8 came in with [...] and stayed there until car production ceased. Prices were slightly up and were between $2,750 and $3995.|$|R

The transmission usually was of a crank-mounted centrifugal clutch and chain drive to a rear sprocket. As the minibike and the mini-powersports field grew, Comet introduced a continuously variable transmission, much like a snowmobile's, called the Torque-a-Verter, which automatically <b>adjusts</b> <b>gear</b> ratios, resulting in better top speed and acceleration.|$|R

40|$|Pulse fishing, {{or fishing}} heavily at regular {{intervals}} rather than continually, has often been suggested to produce higher yields than constant fishing with a lower effort. Existing models, however, are largely {{based on the assumption}} that the gear selectivity cannot be adjusted. In many such cases, whilst pulse fishing with equal selectivity for all fish above the age of recruitment is superior to continually fishing with the same gear, the yield can be improved still further by <b>adjusting</b> <b>gear</b> selectivity and fishing continually. This paper modifies the existing model of DeKlerk and Gatto and shows that nonselective pulse fishing may generate higher yields than either nonselective continual fishing or continual fishing for only the most valuable single cohort...|$|R
50|$|As {{the brake}} linings wear, the shoes must travel a greater {{distance}} {{to reach the}} drum. When the distance reaches a certain point, a self-adjusting mechanism automatically reacts by adjusting the rest position of the shoes {{so that they are}} closer to the drum. Here, the adjusting lever rocks enough to advance the <b>adjuster</b> <b>gear</b> by one tooth. The adjuster has threads on it, like a bolt, so that it unscrews a little bit when it turns, lengthening to fill in the gap. When the brake shoes wear a little more, the adjuster can advance again, so it always keeps the shoes close to the drum. Typically the adjusters only operate when the vehicle is going in reverse and the brakes are engaged.|$|R
500|$|The freeway follows Clear Creek {{down the}} eastern side of the Rockies, passing through the Veterans Memorial Tunnels near Idaho Springs. Farther to the east, I-70 departs the US6 corridor, which {{continues}} to follow Clear Creek through a narrow, curving gorge. The interstate, however, follows the corridor of US40 out of the canyon. The highway crests a small mountain near Genesee Park to descend into Mount Vernon Canyon to exit the Rocky Mountains. This portion features grade-warning signs with unusual messages, such as [...] "Trucks: Don't be fooled," [...] "Truckers, you are not down yet," [...] and [...] "Are your <b>brakes</b> <b>adjusted</b> and cool?" [...] Runaway truck ramps are a prominent feature along this portion of I-70, with a total of seven used along the descent of either side the Continental Divide to stop trucks with failed brakes.|$|R

50|$|In {{most cases}} when using an {{electro-mechanical}} actuator, it is preferred {{to have some}} type of speed control.

40|$|Over {{the last}} decades, views on {{fisheries}} management have oscillated between alarm {{and trust in}} management progress. The predominant policy for remedying the world fishing crisis aims at maximum sustainable yield (MSY) by <b>adjusting</b> <b>gear</b> selectivity and fishing effort. Here we report a case study on how striving for higher yields from the Eastern Baltic cod stock by increasing selectivity has become exceedingly detrimental for its productivity. Although there is a successive increase in numbers of undersized fish, growth potential is severely reduced, and fishing mortality in fishable size has increased. Once density-dependent growth is introduced, the process is self-enforcing {{as long as the}} recruitment remains stable. Our findings suggest that policies focusing on maximum yield while targeting greater sizes are risky and should instead prioritize catch rates over yield. Disregarding the underlying population structure may jeopardize stock productivity, with dire consequences for the fishing industry and ecosystem structure and function...|$|R

40|$|When a {{uniaxial}} {{tensile test}} is performed to investigate tension softening behavior of concrete, a secondary flexure occurs inevitably {{because of the}} heterogeneous nature of concrete, even {{in the case of}} no eccentricity in the applied load. The secondary flexure causes a significant reduction in the observed peak load, and then makes the estimated observed tensile strength unreliable. Therefore, the prevention of the flexure occurrence is essential to obtain reliable experimental results. In order to meet this requirement, the authors have developed a unique test procedure, which consists of a manually operated <b>adjusting</b> <b>gear</b> system. Although the system has provided successful and informative results, it also has an intrinsic drawback, i. e. human related malfunction. The main objective {{of this study is to}} establish and to qualify automation for the prevention of the secondary flexure, using computer-controlled DC motors instead of manual operations. Consequently, the application of the automatic system on the uniaxial tensile test not only provides better test results but also reduces long time efforts...|$|R
40|$|Case StudyCentrifugal {{compressor}} {{train in}} a refinery experienced high vibration problem due to torsional resonance. Sidebands in the VFD output current based on VFD control loop frequencies {{were identified as}} the root cause. In this VFD, stator current was used for torque and speed control, hence control loop frequencies had a potential to generate such sidebands. Frequencies {{of this type of}} sidebands widely vary with the rotation speed (proportional to harmonics of the fundamental frequency), hence it is difficult to avoid resonance at the train torsional natural frequency. In addition, even if a compressor system is proven to have sufficient safety margin against high cycle fatigue failure due to the torque pulsation by this mechanism, such minute torque pulsation may have a potential to excite high lateral vibration at speed <b>adjusting</b> <b>gear.</b> If unpredicted or overlooked during design stage, such high vibration may disturb plant operation. This case study therefore proposes guidelines to predict such vibration levels by a simplified torsional-lateral coupled vibration analysis...|$|R

40|$|Fisheries {{managers}} go {{to great}} lengths to reduce cod catches in the North Sea, aiming for recovery of the cod stock. The Dutch government asked IMARES to provide an overview of all measures that are in place in various countries around the North Sea for reducing cod catches. The Dutch fisheries managers were specifically interested in the existence of gear adjustments, which might also be applicable in Dutch fisheries. With a complete overview of possible measures, the government, fishing industry and gear scientists can decide together which gear adjustments may be effective and feasible in Dutch fisheries. Whether a gear adjustment is effective, depends on changes in selectivity of the <b>adjusted</b> <b>gear</b> compared to the standard gear. Selectivity depends on the shape and size of fish and on the shape and size of meshes in the cod-end. Also behavioural differences between species determine selectivity. IMARES and ILVO made an inventory of existing gear adjustments for reduction of the cod catch. For a series of gear adjustments we determined the effectiveness and applicability for the Dutch and Belgian fisheries...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{research}} suggests that drivers use specific visual information to execute braking behaviors [Faj 05] and that drivers calibrate braking behavior to this visual information over time [Faj 09]. Specifically, Fajen (2005) argued that when successfully <b>braking,</b> participants <b>adjust</b> <b>braking</b> pressure to maintain a visually-specified ideal braking pressure less than one’s maximum ability to brake. In the current paper, we investigated whether factors, specifically one’s emotional state, would alter the relationship between braking behavior and visually-specified ideal braking pressure over time. Specifically, we investigated whether the performance of braking changed when anxious. Previous research demonstrated that anxiety influences static perceptual judgments of space [Gra 12] {{and the performance of}} open-loop sports actions [Bei 10]. Open-loop actions are actions where once the movement has been initiated there are no opportunities to alter the outcome (i. e., putting a golf ball). This research shows an influence of anxiety on static perceptual tasks and the performance of open-loop actions suggesting that anxiety may also influence more complex everyday actions like braking. It is important to know whether, and how, the influence of anxiety extends to the performance of closedloop actions like braking given the potential realworld consequences of poor performance...|$|R
