40|$|Aim: To {{determine}} whether the pronounced ecological importance of pebble mounds to pebble-mound mice (Pseudomys) is manifest in their continental biogeography. Location: Northern Australia. Methods: A GIS-based comparison was made between the habitats contained within the potential climatic distributions of mice, representing a null hypothesis of no habitat selection, and their actual distributions based on all known location records. Results: All species had a clear preference for hilly, rocky landscapes with a surficial cover dominated by bedrock. Simple vegetation communities with relatively open eucalypt overstorey and grassy understorey were preferred. Highly degraded rocks and aggradational surfaces and plains were avoided. The extent of the summer monsoon may be important in determining the southern limits of the group's distribution. Major disjunctions between species were attributable {{to the presence of}} clay plains and sand sheets. The <b>behavioural</b> <b>requirement</b> of pebble-mound mice for mounds determines their population distribution pattern and the distribution of the different species within the genus. Main conclusions: The behavioural need for pebble mounds drives the distributional pattern of populations and species of pebble-mound mice. The initial spread of pebble-mound mice probably occurred during the late Pliocene or earliest Pleistocene. There has predominantly been degradation of the potential distribution of the group since that time due to the stability of Australian landscapes and Pleistocene planation and sand sheet development over large areas of northern Australia. This process is ongoing, and past regions of rocky contact between current distributions have disappeared, while the distributional limits of several species are steadily being reduced by erosion of hills and the spread of dune fields...|$|R

40|$|The {{responses}} of neurones in forelimb motor cortex to impulse volleys evoked by single pulse electrical stimulation (at 1. 5 or 2 times the threshold for most excitable nerve fibres) of the superficial radial (SR) and ulnar (UL) nerves of the contralateral forelimb were studied in awake cats both resting quietly and {{walking on a}} horizontal ladder. Nerve volley amplitude was monitored by recording the compound action potential elicited by the stimulus. In the resting animal 34 / 82 (41 %) cells yielded statistically significant responses to SR stimulation, and 20 / 72 (28 %) responded to UL stimulation. Some responses were confined to or began {{with an increase in}} firing probability (‘excitatory’ responses) and others with a decrease in firing (‘inhibitory’ responses), typically including a brief interruption of the spike train (zero rate). Cells responding to both nerves usually yielded responses similar in type. Most (78 %) response onset latencies were less than 30 ms. Responses involved the addition or subtraction of from 3. 4 to 0. 1 impulses stimulus− 1 (most < 1 impulse stimulus− 1). The distribution of response sizes was continuous down to the smallest values, i. e. there was no ‘gap’ which would represent a clear separation into ‘responsive’ and ‘unresponsive’ categories. Responses were commonest in the lateral part of the pericruciate cortex, and commoner among pyramidal tract neurones (PTNs) than non-PTNs. During ladder walking most cells generated a rhythmic step-related discharge; in assessing the size of responses to nerve stimulation (20 studied, from 13 cells) this activity was first subtracted. Response onset latencies (90 % < 30 ms) and durations showed little or no change. Although most cells were overall more active than during rest both ‘excitatory’ and ‘inhibitory’ responses in both PTNs and non-PTNs were often markedly reduced in large parts of the step cycle; over some (usually brief) parts responses approached or exceeded their size during rest, i. e. response size was step phase dependent. Such variations occurred without parallel change in the nerve compound action potential, nor were they correlated with the level of background firing {{at the time that the}} response was evoked. When responses to both nerves were studied in the same neurone they differed in their patterns of phase dependence. The findings are interpreted as evidence for central mechanisms that, during ‘skilled’, cortically controlled walking, powerfully regulate the excitability of the somatic afferent paths from forelimb mechanoreceptors (including low threshold cutaneous receptors) to motor cortex. Retention (or enhancement) of responsiveness often occurred (especially for ulnar nerve) around footfall, perhaps reflecting a <b>behavioural</b> <b>requirement</b> for sensory input signalling the quality of the contact established with the restricted surface available for support...|$|R
40|$|Studies {{of habitat}} use by animals must {{consider}} <b>behavioural</b> resource <b>requirements</b> at different scales, which could influence the functional value of different sites. Using Cape buffalo (Syncerus caffer caffer) in the Okavango Delta, Botswana, {{we tested the}} hypotheses that behaviour affected use between and within habitats, hereafter referred to as macro- and microhabitats, respectively. We fitted GPS-enabled collars to fifteen buffalo and used the distances and turning angles between consecutive fixes to cluster the resulting data into resting, grazing, walking and relocating behaviours. Distance to water and six vegetation characteristic variables were recorded in sites used for each behaviour, except for relocating, which occurred too infrequently. We used multilevel binomial and multinomial logistic regressions to identify variables that characterised seasonally-preferred macrohabitats and microhabitats used for different behaviours. Our results showed that macrohabitat use was linked to behaviour, although this was least apparent during the rainy season, when resources were most abundant. Behaviour-related microhabitat use was less significant, but variation in forage characteristics could predict some behaviour within all macrohabitats. The variables predicting behaviour were not consistent, but resting and grazing sites were more readily identifiable than walking sites. These results highlight the significance of resting, as well as foraging, site availability in buffalo spatial processes. Our results emphasise the importance of considering several behaviours and scales in studies of habitat use to understand the links between environmental resources and animal behavioural and spatial ecology...|$|R

This notion includes health, productive comfort and also involves the animal protection. The Universal Declaration on Animal Welfare, issued by the World Society for Animals Protection, defines welfare as: Degree in which the animal physical, <b>behavioural</b> and psychological <b>requirements</b> are met.

There are seven measures to ensure the minimum standards concerning animal welfare on farms and they include: flooring, lighting, fights prevention, potable water, microclimate, dry bedding, health. Increasing the number of farms in which are applied superior measures in comparison with the mandatory technological measures and improving the welfare of pigs leads to improving the environment and the rural space. The animal welfare superior standards often involve additional costs and therefore the state provides some tools to compensate producers for higher production costs for: increasing by at least 10 % of available space allocated to each animal, ensuring at least 11 hours / day artificial light with a value of 50 lux of lighting, improving pig welfare conditions during transport, correction the nitrites and nitrates level in the water, reducing pollutants by 30 % in comparison with the mandatory minimum level, by maintaining optimal microclimate parameters limits, improving the rest area...|$|R

A number of Non-invasive Head Immobilisation Systems (NHIS) for monkeys are available, but the need remains for a feasible integrated system combining {{a broad range}} of essential features. New methodWe developed an individualised macaque NHIS addressing several animal welfare and scientific needs. The system comprises a customised-to-fit facemask that can be used separately or combined with a back piece to form a full-head helmet. The system permits presentation of visual and auditory stimuli during immobilisation and provides mouth access for reward. ResultsThe facemask was incorporated into an automated voluntary training system, allowing the animals to engage with it for increasing periods leading to full head immobilisation. We evaluated the system during performance on several auditory or visual behavioural tasks with testing sessions lasting 1. 5 – 2 h, used thermal imaging to monitor for and prevent pressure points, and measured head movement using MRI.

40|$|Animals {{must be able}} to {{initiate}} and terminate motor behaviour patterns according to prevailing <b>behavioural</b> and developmental <b>requirements.</b> Even among closely related species, the expression and emergence of different patterns of motor behaviour during development can follow different temporal sequences, presumably to meet the demands imposed by their distinct ecological niches. However, the way in which motor networks are modified during ontogeny to enable species-specific temporal expression of different motor patterns is not fully understood. Neuronal inputs originating in the brainstem and descending to the spinal cord both modulate ongoing motor programs and prime, activate and suppress motor behaviour. As such, developmentally regulated ingrowth to the spinal cord by the axonal processes of brainstem neurons may be important for the temporal expression of different behaviour patterns. For example, at the time of hatching, the tadpole of Rana temporaria (stage 20 : Gosner, 1960) is capable of generating a well-coordinated swimming motor pattern (Soffe, 1991; Soffe and Sillar, 1991). However, fictive swimming in Rana temporaria is relatively more mature than in hatchling tadpoles of the related anuran Xenopus laevis in that motor bursts are longer and more variable on a cycle-by-cycle basis (Sillar and Soffe, 1989). It has been speculated that this interspecific difference at equivalent stages of development is due to the greater development of descending serotonergic projections in Rana temporaria because serotonin (5 -HT) is known to facilitate motor burst generation in both species (Woolston et al., 1994; Sillar et al., 1993).

In certain countries, such as the United States and Australia, the industry comprises {{a small number of}} integrated, self-regulated companies, whereas in Europe the industry is more diverse, with greater competition, and more government regulation. There is much more meat chicken welfare research and regulation in Europe, and in particular the United Kingdom, than in countries with self-regulated industries, such as the United States, even taking into account the level of meat chicken production in the relevant areas. By contrast, welfare regulation in two of the world 2 ̆ 7 s major meat chicken producing countries; namely Brazil and China, is negligible. Some welfare issues are regional, such as high temperatures which are particularly problematic for free range birds, breeds selected for rapid growth and when birds are removed from fully-housed systems. However, similar welfare issues affect intensively-housed birds worldwide, which comprise the majority of animals produced. These include rapid growth rates, predisposing birds to heart and leg problems, especially ascites and sudden death syndrome, and high stocking densities, which inhibit locomotion and environmental exploration, predisposing birds to contact dermatitis. Welfare research in Europe has shown that highly stocked birds spend longer sleeping, congregate around feeders and are more fearful, as well as experiencing higher ammonia levels, which irritate their eyes and respiratory systems. The review concludes that intensive systems present similar welfare issues worldwide; however, European research is more directed to the <b>behavioural</b> and cognitive <b>requirements</b> of the birds, than in self-regulated countries.

40|$|Although {{amphibians}} {{are one of}} {{the most}} threatened animal groups, little published evidence exists on effective management programs. In order for conservation initiatives to be successful, an understanding of habitat use patterns is required to identify important environmental features. However, habitat use may differ between the different sexes and age classes due to different <b>behavioural</b> and resource <b>requirements.</b> For this study, we compared microhabitat use during the active breeding season among the sexes and age classes in the endangered green and golden bell frog Litoria aurea, a species which has had several failed management programs. We found aquatic vegetation was selected for by every L. aurea class, and should be the focus of future management plans for this species. Females were the only class to select for terrestrial vegetation more than availability. Increasing the amount of terrestrial vegetation around ponds may help encourage female occupancy, and possibly improve management outcomes, as they are typically a limiting resource. Although large rock piles have been used in past L. aurea habitat management, they were selected for by adults and juveniles, but not metamorphs. Therefore, large rocks may not be necessary for captive breeding portions of management initiatives, which typically only involve tadpoles and metamorphs prior to release. The results indicate that the most appropriate management plans should contain a habitat mosaic of various microhabitats, such as a large proportion of aquatic and terrestrial vegetation with patches of bare ground and a small proportion of rocks for basking and shelter. Recognizing differences in microhabitat use patterns between individuals in a population and implementing them into management strategies should be a pivotal step in any conservation plan...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background In the Australian {{state of}} Queensland, many Department of Education Policies include {{behavioural}} directives for school teachers, whereby "the teacher must墠behave {{in a certain}} manner. The introduction of an Education policy, such as the mandatory reporting {{of child sexual abuse}} by teachers, has significant and wide-ranging implications for the lives of children. However, little is known, and little literature has been found, about student-teachers' knowledge and understanding of these new behavioural directives for teachers. Purpose This study audits Bachelor of Education (Primary School) student-teachers who are about to become qualified teachers, on their knowledge, and their confidence in that knowledge, of their Department of Education behavioural directives on child sexual abuse mandatory reporting policy, which they will soon have to implement when they are employed in professional teaching positions in Primary Schools. Sample A 4 th-year, final-semester, volunteer cohort of 52 Bachelor of Education (Primary School) student-teachers at a major university in Queensland, Australia provided this sample of 42 females and 10 males whose ages ranged from 21 to 45 years. Design and methods The audit's 5 -page anonymous and confidential questionnaire included a series of valid statements, and one invalid statement, about the behavioural directives for teachers contained in the Queensland Department of Education Policy on the mandatory reporting of suspected child sexual abuse. Participants self-evaluated their knowledge of the Policy on a quantitative 3 -point scale, and their confidence in that knowledge on a 4 -point scale, and then responded to an open-ended qualitative query about their understanding of the Policy, during their tutorial classes. The quantitative responses were analysed and displayed as histograms, and the qualitative responses were clustered into three categories. Results Analysis of the data shows that while the majority of these student-teachers claim satisfactory levels of knowledge and confidence concerning their Department's behavioural directives, such results seem disappointing given a necessarily high standard of competence, and significant numbers indicating uncertainty of knowledge and/or lack of confidence regarding their roles as mandatory reporters of suspected child abuse. Conclusions It is expected that all new teachers be properly equipped and prepared in pre-service training, with appropriate knowledge and understanding of these important directives, to report the cases of suspected child abuse they will encounter in their schools. Current pre-service education of Primary school teachers at this university in Queensland, and very likely throughout the state, does not reach a standard that engenders educators' satisfaction and confidence in student-teachers' understanding of their Department's <b>behavioural</b> and legal <b>requirements</b> upon qualification. This conclusion is consistent with national and international research (See Baginsky & Macpherson, 2005; Hawkins & McCallum, 2001; Laskey, 2004) showing that teachers and student-teachers lack confidence and are inadequately prepared to fulfil their role as mandatory reporters of child sexual abuse.

However, state machines are difficult to write; determining how to decompose behaviour into states is not obvious, different stakeholders will have different opinions on how to structure the state machine, and the state machines can easily become too complex. This thesis proposes a pattern for decomposing and structuring the model of a feature's <b>behavioural</b> <b>requirements,</b> based on modes of operation (e. g., Active, Inactive, Failed) that are common to features in multiple domains.
