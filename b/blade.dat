5|$|Before filming began, Cinefantastique {{magazine}} commissioned Paul M. Sammon {{to write}} an article about <b>Blade</b> Runners production which became the book Future Noir: The Making of <b>Blade</b> Runner.|$|E
5|$|<b>Blade</b> Runner has {{numerous}} deep {{similarities to}} Fritz Lang's Metropolis, including a built-up urban environment, {{in which the}} wealthy literally live above the workers, dominated by a huge building– the Stadtkrone Tower in Metropolis and the Tyrell Building in <b>Blade</b> Runner. Special effects supervisor David Dryer used stills from Metropolis when lining up <b>Blade</b> Runners miniature building shots.|$|E
5|$|It was {{announced}} on April 27, 2010 that the DC Agenda would rename {{itself to the}} Washington <b>Blade.</b> The ownership group of the Agenda consisted of many former staff members of the <b>Blade,</b> who purchased the trademark and paper archives out of bankruptcy court. The first issue of the newly independent <b>Blade</b> debuted on April 30, 2010.|$|E
50|$|Generally, {{there are}} three types of {{sintered}} metal-bonded diamond <b>blades</b> according to their manufacturing methods: wholly sintered diamond <b>blades,</b> silver brazed diamond <b>blades</b> and laser welded diamond <b>blades.</b>|$|R
5000|$|If possible, {{diamond saw}} <b>blades</b> {{should be used}} instead of {{abrasive}} saw <b>blades</b> to cut. Diamond saw <b>blades</b> normally cut more quickly than abrasive <b>blades</b> while requiring less water.|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} determine the effect of electropolishing precision-forged <b>blades</b> and of machining <b>blades</b> from oversize forgings on the engine performance of Nimonic 80 and Nimonic 80 A turbine <b>blades.</b> These <b>blades,</b> along with precision-forged <b>blades,</b> were run in a J 33 - 9 turbojet engine. The tests resulted in the following conclusions: (1) Electropolishing of precision-forged <b>blades</b> did not improve engine life relative to the life of nonelectropolished <b>blades.</b> (2) Machining <b>blades</b> from oversize forgings did not improve the engine life of precision-forged <b>blades.</b> (3) The precision-forging and heat-treating practice used in fabricating the <b>blades</b> investigated was such that the surface roughness and oxide penetration was so slight, approximately 0. 0005 inch in depth, as to preclude any benefits derived from surface removal by electropolishing or machining...|$|R
5|$|The {{decision}} to use a straight or curved laryngoscope <b>blade</b> depends partly on the specific anatomical features of the airway, and partly on the personal experience and preference of the laryngoscopist. The Macintosh <b>blade</b> is {{the most widely used}} curved laryngoscope <b>blade,</b> while the Miller <b>blade</b> is the most popular style of straight <b>blade.</b> Both Miller and Macintosh laryngoscope blades are available in sizes 0 (infant) through 4 (large adult). There are many other styles of straight and curved blades, with accessories such as mirrors for enlarging the field of view and even ports for the administration of oxygen. These specialty blades are primarily designed for use by anesthetists and otolaryngologists, most commonly in the operating room.|$|E
5|$|A {{controversy}} over the effects of running <b>blade</b> length arose at the 2012 Paralympic Games, as Brazilian runner Alan Oliveira and USA runner Blake Leeper changed to longer running blades {{within a few months}} before the 2012 Paralympic Games. This led to marked improvement in their running times. Pistorius complained after the 200m race that the blades provided artificially lengthened running strides, which would be an infringement of the IPC rules, regardless of that the blades were within the allowable height limits for the athletes concerned. His complaint was supported by single-leg runners including Jerome Singleton and Jack Swift, who called for the T43 double <b>blade</b> and T44 single <b>blade</b> classes to be separated in future events, as single <b>blade</b> runners were unable to adjust the height of the prostheses, and must always match the length of their biological leg with a running <b>blade.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Blade</b> Runner {{continues}} to reflect modern trends and concerns, {{and an increasing}} number of critics consider it one of the greatest science fiction films of all time. It was voted the best science fiction film ever made in a 2004 poll of 60 eminent world scientists. <b>Blade</b> Runner is also cited as an important influence to both the style and story of the Ghost in the Shell film series, which itself has been highly influential to the future-noir genre. <b>Blade</b> Runner has been very influential to the cyberpunk movement. It also influenced the cyberpunk derivative biopunk, which revolves around biotechnology and genetic engineering.|$|E
50|$|Al is {{the late}} younger brother of former Seattle Seahawks wide {{receiver}} Brian <b>Blades</b> and former Detroit Lions safety Bennie <b>Blades,</b> and late uncle of H. B. <b>Blades,</b> who played 4 seasons for the Washington Redskins in the NFL as well. His son, Alphonso <b>Blades</b> II (Al <b>Blades</b> Jr.) is currently playing {{high school football}} at Fort Lauderdale-St. Thomas Aquinas as a defensive back. The younger <b>Blades</b> verbally committed {{to play with the}} Hurricanes in 2015. <b>Blades</b> then withdrew his commitment to the Hurricanes, only to later recommit in 2017.|$|R
5000|$|Cutting <b>blades</b> are {{standard}} saw <b>blades</b> with various tooth configurations for cutting different material. They are either straight <b>blades</b> with the teeth on the end, allowing {{the user to}} 'plunge cut' directly into the material they are cutting or circular <b>blades.</b> Bi-metal <b>blades</b> offer smaller hardened teeth that allow the user to cut soft metals and the popular Japan tooth <b>blades</b> have large teeth that cut wood quickly but cannot cut metal ...|$|R
50|$|Diamond <b>blades</b> {{designed}} for specific uses include marble, granite, concrete, asphalt, masonry, and gem-cutting <b>blades.</b> General purpose <b>blades</b> are also available.|$|R
5|$|In 1913, Chevalier Jackson was {{the first}} to report a high rate of success for the use of direct {{laryngoscopy}} as a means to intubate the trachea. Jackson introduced a new laryngoscope <b>blade</b> that incorporated a component that the operator could slide out to allow room for passage of an endotracheal tube or bronchoscope. Also in 1913, New York surgeon Henry H. Janeway (1873–1921) published results he had achieved using a laryngoscope he had recently developed. Another pioneer in this field was Sir Ivan Whiteside Magill (1888–1986), who developed the technique of awake blind nasotracheal intubation, the Magill forceps, the Magill laryngoscope <b>blade,</b> and several apparati for the administration of volatile anesthetic agents. The Magill curve of an endotracheal tube is also named for Magill. Sir Robert Reynolds Macintosh (1897–1989) introduced a curved laryngoscope <b>blade</b> in 1943; the Macintosh <b>blade</b> remains to this day the most widely used laryngoscope <b>blade</b> for orotracheal intubation.|$|E

5|$|In April 2006, Marvel hired Andrew W. Marlowe {{to write}} a script for Nick Fury. In May 2013, The Hollywood Reporter {{reported}} that Marvel had a working script for <b>Blade.</b> In July 2015, Wesley Snipes, who played <b>Blade</b> in three films before the character's rights reverted to Marvel, stated that he had discussions with Marvel to reprise the role.|$|E
40|$|The {{cycloidal}} <b>blades</b> {{system is}} a thrust propulsion system that consists of several <b>blades</b> rotating about a horizontal axis perpendicular to the direction of normal flight. In order to generate the thrust required, the pitch angles of the individual <b>blades</b> to the tangent of the circle of the <b>blade’s</b> path are varied by a pitch control mechanism installed in the cycloidal <b>blades</b> system so designed that the periodic oscillation of the <b>blades</b> about their span axis may be changed both in amplitude and in phase angle. Therefore, the cycloidal <b>blades</b> {{system is a}}ble to vector its high thrust anywhere within a 360 ° arc parallel to the propellers plane of rotation. This characteristic enables the cycloidal <b>blades</b> system to take off and land vertically, hover and fly forwardly by simple adjustment of <b>blades</b> pitch angles...|$|R
25|$|The {{high-pressure}} turbine <b>blades</b> are single-crystal <b>blades,</b> {{and they are}} cooled by a thin film of air from inside of the <b>blades.</b> The low-pressure turbine <b>blades,</b> like the high-pressure compressor, were improved between the F3 and the XF3-400 using 3D CFD.|$|R

5|$|In {{between the}} time Scott {{released}} Alien in 1979 {{and returned to the}} franchise with Prometheus in 2012, he directed another notable science fiction film concerning artificial intelligence, <b>Blade</b> Runner, in 1982. Contrary to the white-blooded androids of Alien that emulate emotions and recognize a disconnect with humanity, <b>Blade</b> Runner features the replicants- enhanced biorobotic humanoids that may only be identified by their lacking emotions. In order to maintain control, the replicants' human creators install false memories that detail entire lives that give them a sense of identity. <b>Blade</b> Runner, a largely influential film, has prompted a slew of philosophical questions concerning artificial intelligence and whether or not an android could truly be considered alive. The film specifically questions whether thoughts, a sense of identity, emotions and consciousness in general, may be something genuine when applied to artificial intelligence. Due to David identifying himself as a living entity - similar to the replicants - film critics in 2012 would come not to only question if Prometheus was a direct prequel to Alien, but if the film had a relation to <b>Blade</b> Runner.|$|E
5|$|Jim Bowie was {{inducted}} posthumously into the <b>Blade</b> Magazine Cutlery Hall of Fame at the 1988 <b>Blade</b> Show in Atlanta, Georgia, {{in recognition of}} the impact that his eponymous design made upon generations of knife makers and cutlery companies.|$|E

5000|$|The {{diaphragm}} has two {{to twenty}} <b>blades</b> (with most lenses today featuring {{between five and}} ten <b>blades),</b> depending on price {{and quality of the}} device in which it is used. Straight <b>blades</b> result in polygon shape of the diaphragm opening, while curved <b>blades</b> improve the roundness of the iris opening. In a photograph, the number of <b>blades</b> that the iris diaphragm has can be guessed by counting the number of diffraction spikes converging from a light source or bright reflection. For an odd number of <b>blades,</b> there are twice as many spikes as there are <b>blades.</b>|$|R
50|$|An M1000e {{holds up}} to 32 quarter-height, 16 half-height <b>blades</b> or 8 full-height <b>blades</b> or {{a mix of}} them (e.g. 2 full height + 12 half-height). The 1/4 height <b>blades</b> require a {{full-size}} sleeve to install. The current list are the currently available 11G <b>blades</b> and the latest generation 12 models. There are also older <b>blades</b> like the M605, M805 and M905 series.|$|R
5|$|On May 25, 2001, {{the print}} edition {{announced}} {{the sale of}} the Washington <b>Blade</b> to Window Media, LLC, a group of gay publications. With the new ownership came several changes to standardize the paper with other Window Media publications, such as the return of editorials to the publication after being missing for several decades. Shortly after {{the sale of the}} paper, staff at the <b>Blade</b> sought a vote to unionize {{with the help of the}} Washington-Baltimore Newspaper Guild. The Guild and the staff of the <b>Blade</b> brought a complaint to the National Labor Relations Board and deliberated for a few weeks over this issue resulting in a ten to eight vote against unionization on July 20, 2001.|$|E
5|$|The Benchmade factory {{version was}} sold under the model name BM970 or BM975 {{depending}} on <b>blade</b> length. Other designations followed which denoted <b>blade</b> finish, manual or automatic opening, or partially serrated <b>blade.</b> The knife retained {{the profile of}} Emerson's custom piece {{in addition to the}} ATS-34 steel and the titanium liners. However, on Benchmade's offering the titanium bolsters and micarta scales were replaced with G10 fiberglass scales, the slotted screws were replaced by Torx head screws, and the pocket clip was repositioned so that the knife could be carried in the pocket in a tip-down position.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Blade</b> started {{publishing}} weekly in January 1983 and coverage {{shifted to the}} AIDS crisis and news about this newly emerging disease. The ever-breaking news caused the paper to remain in a heightened state of coverage and nearly exhausted the papers resources {{with members of the}} community having to step in to support the work of the <b>Blade.</b> The reporting of the AIDS crisis from this timeframe allowed the newspaper to come of age to the mature and professionally driven publication seen today. In June 1988, the editors of the paper used a computer to layout the paper for the first time. The 1990s saw increases in readership and circulation of the Washington <b>Blade.</b> In April 1993, during the 1993 Gay March on Washington, the paper published its largest edition to date consisting of 216 pages. The paper expanded into new markets and mediums with the 1995 launch of the online version of the <b>Blade,</b> followed two years later with the launching of a sister publication in New York, called the New York <b>Blade.</b> In the later part of the century, coverage was expanded to include local and national news, as well as international news of interest to the LGBT community.|$|E
50|$|The talwar was {{produced}} in many varieties, with different types of <b>blades.</b> Some <b>blades</b> are very unusual, from those with double-pointed tips (zulfikar) to those with massive <b>blades</b> (sometimes called tegha - often deemed to be executioner's swords but on little evidence). However, all such <b>blades</b> are curved, {{and the vast majority}} of talwars have <b>blades</b> more typical of a generalised sabre.|$|R
50|$|The skate <b>blades</b> are {{typically}} made of tempered carbon steel, {{coated with a}} high-quality chrome. Lightweight aluminum and stainless steel <b>blades</b> are becoming more popular with skaters. <b>Blades</b> are about 3/16 inch (4 mm) thick and may have a slightly tapered cross-section. There are different <b>blades</b> for different levels of skaters which often correspond to a skater's age, size and skill level. <b>Blades</b> for advanced skaters often have larger toe picks and different curves than <b>blades</b> for beginner, intermediate and recreational levels.|$|R
