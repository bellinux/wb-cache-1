40|$|This paper {{presents}} a {{comparative study of}} the output of industrial research and development (R&D) of the major EU and US companies within the information and communication technology (ICT) sector. In R&D, multinational companies are playing a key role both as heavy investors and as mediators between scientific breakthroughs and disruptive technologies. This is also acknowledged by the EU and logically the <b>Barcelona</b> <b>objectives</b> stipulates that two third of the investments in R&D should come from the private sector. In contrast to a measure of input, i. e. money spent, this paper focuses on output from industrial R&D. As a measure of R&D activity, publications in highly ranked peer-review journals is used. The study comprises the 30 largest ICT companies in the EU {{as well as in}} the US. The study shows that, despite the fact that the total turnover of the American companies almost equals the total turnover of the European companies, the American dominance in almost all fields is striking. The most severe example is the almost negligible (4 percent) proportion of research emanating from European companies in the three most prestigious scientific journals during a 15 year time period. The paper precedes discussing possible implications of the key findings. The main line of argument is that the European innovation system lacks one important ingredient, namely a strong bridge between academia and industry with the necessary flux of people and ideas...|$|E
40|$|It {{is widely}} {{recognized}} that productivity gains, {{sustained economic growth}} and employment are largely determined by technological progress, innovation and human capital. The 2000 Lisbon strategy to make Europe a competitive knowledge-based economy by 2010 and, more specifically, the <b>Barcelona</b> <b>objectives</b> agreed upon in 2002 to increase R&D investment in the EU to approach 3 % of GDP, ensuring that there are sufficient human resources for research, are a preliminary step in this direction. If we want to reach this goal we have to succeed in retaining the best researchers, creating the right environment where they can perform their activities and develop their careers. To this aim the Organization of European Cancer Institutes (OECI) {{has set up a}} working group on Education and Training with the mandate to encourage continuing education in cancer research and applications and to verify the feasibility to promote mobility programs inside the network and in association with industries. Until now only few OECI training programs have been launched and a full mobility program has not been developed yet due to limited budget resources. The Italian Network of Comprehensive Cancer Centers, Alleanza Contro il Cancro, has planned the launch of a mobility program awarding 70 annual fellowships over a period of 36 months. This program, which will be open to the world research community, could represent a first interaction through mobility among the members of the OECI network also involving industries. The program is a tangible approach to sustain the translational process needed for the development of an European Research Area in the field of cancer and its related biomedical disciplines, thus providing a practical answer to the 2005 renewed Lisbon Strategy...|$|E
40|$|With the {{adoption}} of the Lisbon Strategy in March 2000, to make Europe a competitive knowledge-based economy by 2010, and the <b>Barcelona</b> <b>objectives</b> agreed upon in 2002 to increase R&D investment in the EU to approach 3 % of GDP, the European leaders acknowledged the need for profound reforms in the EU in view of the challenges of ageing, enlargement and globalisation. EU Heads of State and Government were well aware that such policy endeavour could only be effectively undertaken by a concerted approach involving all Member States and involving many policy areas where competence lies at both national and EU level. These objectives and orientations were confirmed and strengthened in the renewed Lisbon strategy launched in 2005. To date, one of the most disappointing aspects of the Lisbon strategy is the performance on R&D andInnovation. While there are examples of good performance in particular sectors and particular Member States, overall the EU innovation environment remains weak This is all the more remarkable taking into account that the Lisbon European Council rightly recognised that Europe's future economic development would depend crucially on its ability to create and grow high value, innovative and research-based sectors. This contribution tries to provide some insight into the issue by first assessing (section 2) and identifying the causes (section 3) of EU's growth and innovation problem. It then discusses how policy should be designed to tackle EU's innovative capacity (section 4), to continue with a discussion of EU's actual policy agenda (section 5). We conclude with suggestions for moving policy forward (section 6).

40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this study is to {{determine}} how teaching English in European schools can become more effective in order to improve the quality of foreign language education and the quantity of students learning it. Currently, only the minority (38 %) of European citizens possesses the ability to speak English, while its importance continues to grow. In addition, it is argued that English can be a very useful instrument in the process of European unification. The current crisis laid bare that there is no underlying emotional bond between people from different member state countries and English has the potential to change that. This research consists of a total of four parts with every part answering a different sub question. In the first part is discussed what the implications of the growing importance of English are on national identities and languages. The second part includes the factors which influence the process of second language acquisition. Subsequently, a case study is conducted which compares the organization of and participation in Dutch, Swedish, Spanish and Bulgarian primary and secondary education and also looks at the teachers and teaching processes. Finally, in the fourth part numbers are presented and analyzed on whether or not EU member state countries are attaining the Barcelona objectives: mother tongue plus two. The main conclusions of all these parts are that a national identity and a possible European identity are able to co-exist instead of replace the other. Similarly, national languages are very robust and will never dissolve into new intermediate idioms. The difference between the percentages of English speakers within Europe cannot merely be explained by education. There are also important linguistic and societal factors influencing second language acquisition. Only a few countries are attaining the <b>Barcelona</b> <b>objectives</b> so far, but there have been reforms in many states which show that they are making an effort. The case study showed that there is still a lot of room for improvement in all four countries when it comes to teaching foreign languages in primary and secondary education. The conclusion lists twelve recommendations on how to do this. For example, it is advised to lower the age of compulsory language learning to the age of 5, to exclusively use the language of instruction in the classroom, to expose students to the target language outside of school and to offer more programs and courses taught in English in universities...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore the {{influence}} of dubbing and subtitling on EFL competence in dubbing and subtitling countries in the EU. If significant differences exist in EFL competence between dubbing and subtitling countries in the EU, this might have implications for dubbing countries, especially in the light of the 2002 <b>Barcelona</b> <b>objective,</b> which states that citizens of the EU should speak two languages in addition to their mother tongue. Since English is the most commonly learned foreign language in the EU, and because the majority of dubbed or subtitled material in the EU is anglophone in origin, this paper asks how dubbing and subtitling affect EFL competence in dubbing and subtitling countries in the EU. To answer this question, secondary data from a number of large-scale EU studies were analyzed. The results of the analysis showed a clear link between subtitling countries and relatively high EFL competence; EFL competence was found to be lower in dubbing countries. However, there were exceptions to this general trend, suggesting that other factors such as quality and quantity of exposure and issues related to formal education also play an important part in determining overall EFL competence...|$|R

40|$|In 2002, the Barcelona European Council set the {{objective}} that further action {{needs to be}} taken to " improve the mastery of basic skills, in particular by teaching at least two foreign languages from a very young age". In response to this, the European Commission produced the language learning and linguistic diversity Action Plan (2004 - 2006). The main aim of this thesis is to evaluate if the Member States of the European Union complied to the seven recommendations set in this Action Plan that directly addressed the <b>Barcelona</b> <b>objective.</b> The seven recommendations were made towards the pre-primary and primary language-in-education policies of the Member States. Furthermore, this thesis investigates whether the national linguistic factors of the countries are reflected in their language-in-education policies, and if this in turn affects the countries ability to comply to the recommendations. This thesis took a case study approach, concentrating on Luxembourg and Ireland. The key findings of this thesis were that both Luxembourg and Ireland did not comply to the recommendations. Moreover, for both cases the linguistic situations were highly reflected in the language-in-education policies, which affected their compliance to the recommendations. Luxembourg complied to three out of the seven recommendations, and {{it was found that the}} teaching of German and French as foreign languages were a huge reflection of the linguistic situation within Luxembourg; which largely affected the countries compliance with the recommendations. Ireland complied to none of the recommendations, as they fail to teach any compulsory foreign languages in their pre-primary and primary curriculum. It was found that the teaching of Irish, which is not considered a foreign language, came at the expense of teaching foreign languages. This showed that the linguistic situation of the country was highly reflected within the language-in-education policies and in-turn affected the countries ability to comply to the recommendations...|$|R

40|$|Green {{spaces are}} {{associated}} with improved health, but {{little is known about}} mechanisms underlying such association. We aimed to assess the association between greenness exposure and subjective general health (SGH) and to evaluate mental health status, social support, and physical activity as mediators of this association. This cross-sectional study was based on a population-based sample of 3461 adults residing in Barcelona, Spain (2011). We characterized outcome and mediators using the Health Survey of <b>Barcelona.</b> <b>Objective</b> and subjective residential proximity to green spaces and residential surrounding greenness were used to characterize greenness exposure. We followed Baron and Kenny's framework to establish the mediation roles and we further quantified the relative contribution of each mediator. Residential surrounding greenness and subjective residential proximity to green spaces were associated with better SGH. We found indications for mediation of these associations by mental health status, perceived social support, and to less extent, by physical activity. These mediators altogether could explain about half of the surrounding greenness association and one-third of the association for subjective proximity to green spaces. We observed indications that mental health and perceived social support might be more relevant for men and those younger than 65 years. The results for objective residential proximity to green spaces were not conclusive. In conclusion, our observed association between SGH and greenness exposure was mediated, in part, by mental health status, enhanced social support, and physical activity. There might be age and sex variations in these mediation roles.

Design/methodology/approach – Face-to-face interviews with a representative sample of Latin American {{immigrants in}} the Metropolitan area of Barcelona are undertaken. Ethnic identity is measured using the MEIM scale, which combines aspects from the social identity and personal development theories. Finally, a Multinomial Logit Model is used to identify the relationship between food habits and ethnical identity. Findings – Results indicate that the higher the level of ethnic identity and feeling of belonging of immigrants in Catalonia, the greater the persistence of dietary habits from the country of origin. Contrasting with results from other studies, no correlation is found between the persistence of dietary habits and either the length of time spent in Spain or the level of integration into the Catalan culture (measured through use of the Catalan language). Research limitations/implications – Findings should logically be interpreted {{within the context of the}} population and sample studied. Further research should be addressed to analyze other immigrant groups such as Muslims, Asians and Eastern Europeans. Originality/value – This study explores the strength of traditional food habits of immigrants living in a foreign cultural environment and the role of ethnic identity in contributing to this strength.

40|$|This {{communication}} {{is part of}} a larger teaching innovation project financed by the University of <b>Barcelona,</b> whose <b>objective</b> is to develop and evaluate transversal competences of the UB, learning ability and responsibility. The competence is divided into several sub-competencies being the ability to analyze and synthesis the most intensely worked in the first year. The work presented here part from the results obtained in phase 1 and 2 previously implemented in other subjects (Mathematics and History) in the first year of the degree of Business Administration Degree. In these subjects’ previous experiences there were deficiencies in the acquisition of learning skills by the students. The work in the subject of Mathematics facilitated that students become aware of the deficit. The work on the subject of History insisted on developing readings schemes and with the practical exercises was sought to go deeply in the development of this competence. The third phase presented here is developed in the framework of the second year degree, in the World Economy subject. The objective of this phase is the development and evaluation of the same cross competence of the previous phases, from a practice that includes both, quantitative analysis and critical reflection. Specifically the practice focuses on the study of the dynamic relationship between economic growth and the dynamics in the distribution of wealth. The activity design as well as the selection of materials to make it, has been directed to address gaps in the ability to analyze and synthesize detected in the subjects of the first year in the previous phases of the project. The realization of the practical case is considered adequate methodology to improve the acquisition of competence of the students, then it is also proposed how to evaluate the acquisition of such competence. The practice is evaluated based on a rubric developed in the framework of the project objectives. Thus at the end of phase 3 we can analyze the process that have followed the students, detect where they have had major difficulties and identify those aspects of teaching that can help to improve the acquisition of skills by the students. The interest of this phase resides in the possibility to value whether tracing of learning through competences, organized in a collaborative way, is a good tool to develop the acquisition of these skills and facilitate their evaluation. 2012 PID-UB/ 00...|$|R

Comienza con un breve an&# 225;lisis de las estructuras de membrana y los retos que supone esta nueva aplicaci&# 243;n. Destaca en ello una investigaci&# 243;n asociada al proyecto, la construcci&# 243;n y las pruebas de una pasarela con estructura de membrana en Call&# 250;s (Barcelona). Su objetivo global fue hacer real la idea, materializando una sobre el terreno, y comprobar su aptitud funcional y su viabilidad estructural y constructiva. Hubo tambi&# 233;n objetivos parciales de an&# 225;lisis estructural (c&# 225;lculo adecuado de forma de membrana y cables de borde), proyecto, proceso constructivo, implantaci&# 243;n en el entorno y comportamiento en uso, para extraer conclusiones espec&# 237;ficas. Por supuesto, tal investigaci&# 243;n (realizada por acuerdo entre el CSIC, la FECYT y el Ayuntamiento de Call&# 250;s) es descrita con cierto detalle en todas sus etapas: 1. Proyecto de la pasarela (especialmente, la estructura de membrana). 2. Construcci&# 243;n de la pasarela en Call&# 250;s. 3. Pruebas en la pasarela. Los resultados fueron satisfactorios y el prototipo cumpli&# 243; su misi&# 243;n de hacer real una idea. Con tal base de partida, se concluy&# 243; proseguir el estudio de esta tecnolog&# 237;a de membranas para pasarelas (cosa nada obvia antes de Call&# 250;s). En fin, tras efectuar una valoraci&# 243;n de la tecnolog&# 237;a, se habla de la continuidad y la proyecci&# 243;n futura de esta l&# 237;nea de trabajo; apuntando ah&# 237; la perspectiva de poder llegar con dicha tecnolog&# 237;a, muy perfeccionada, a vanos de gran luz...|$|R
