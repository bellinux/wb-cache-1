50|$|The {{performance}} of radio communications depends on an antenna system, termed smart or intelligent antenna. Recently, multiple antenna technologies are emerging {{to achieve the}} goal of 4G systems such as high rate, high reliability, and long range communications. In the early 1990s, to cater for the growing data rate needs of data communication, many transmission schemes were proposed. One technology, spatial multiplexing, gained importance for its <b>bandwidth</b> <b>conservation</b> and power efficiency. Spatial multiplexing involves deploying multiple antennas at the transmitter and at the receiver. Independent streams can then be transmitted simultaneously from all the antennas. This technology, called MIMO (as a branch of intelligent antenna), multiplies the base data rate by (the smaller of) the number of transmit antennas {{or the number of}} receive antennas. Apart from this, the reliability in transmitting high speed data in the fading channel can be improved by using more antennas at the transmitter or at the receiver. This is called transmit or receive diversity. Both transmit/receive diversity and transmit spatial multiplexing are categorized into the space-time coding techniques, which does not necessarily require the channel knowledge at the transmitter. The other category is closed-loop multiple antenna technologies, which require channel knowledge at the transmitter.|$|E

40|$|For a {{wireless}} sensor network (WSN) {{with a large number}} of low-cost, battery-driven, multiple transmission power leveled sensor nodes of limited transmission <b>bandwidth,</b> then <b>conservation</b> of transmission resources (power and bandwidth) is of paramount importance. Towards this end, this paper considers the problem of power scheduling of Kalman filtering for general linear stochastic systems subject to data packet drops (over a packet-dropping wireless network). The transmission of the acquired measurement from the sensor to the remote estimator is realized by sequentially transmitting every single component of the measurement to the remote estimator in one time period. The sensor node decides separately whether to use a high or low transmission power to communicate every component to the estimator across a packet-dropping wireless network based on the rule that promotes the power scheduling with the least impact on the estimator mean squared error. Under the customary assumption that the predicted density is (approximately) Gaussian, leveraging the statistical distribution of sensor data, the mechanism of power scheduling, the wireless network effect and the received data, the minimum mean squared error estimator is derived. By investigating the statistical convergence properties of the estimation error covariance, we establish, for general linear systems, both the sufficient condition and the necessary condition guaranteeing the stability of the estimator.

40|$|A {{multistage}} Linear Parallel Interference Cancellation (LPIC) {{approach is}} presented {{to mitigate the effect}} of multiuser interference in uplink Direct Sequence Code Division Multiple Access (DS CDMA) system. The system is overloaded to accommodate more number of users than the processing gain of the system. The performance of this overloading scheme is evaluated by assigning one set of orthogonal Gold codes to the first N users and another set of orthogonal Gold codes to extra users. Both the sets are overlaid by a common pseudo noise scrambling sequence. This paper proposes a novel technique of using Weighted Linear Parallel Interference Cancellation (WLPIC) for overloaded CDMA system resulting in bandwidth saving, better performance and increase in the speed of interference cancellation. Also this technique considerably reduces the multiple-access interference, since set- 1 users suffer from interference of the set- 2 users only, while the set- 2 users suffer from interference of the set- 1 users. This provides a way for accommodating additional users in the same available <b>bandwidth.</b> Considerable <b>conservation</b> of time is achieved by avoiding the usage of conventional successive Interference Cancellation (IC) for scrambled CDMA system. The empirical results show that this scheme provides 50 % overloading with three-stage weighted linear parallel interference cancellation (WLPIC) technique for N = 64 at a Bit Error Rate (BER) of 10 - 3 and 75 % overloading at a BER of 10 - 2.

This thesis presents information on the design and implementation of various components of a virtual classroom system for researching methods of student feedback with a focus on <b>bandwidth</b> <b>conservation.</b> A facial feature technique is implemented and used within the system to determine the viability of using facial feature extraction to provide and prioritise feedback from students to teacher while conserving bandwidth. This allows a teacher to estimate the comprehension level of the class and individual students based on student images.

Feedback is improved as teachers adapt to class circumstances using experience gained in traditional classrooms. Feedback is also less reliant on intentional student participation. New page-turner, page suggestion and class activity components are presented as possible methods for improving student feedback. In particular, the effect of virtual classroom system parameters on feedback delays and bandwidth usage is investigated. In general, delays are increased as bandwidth requirements decrease.

40|$|As {{transistor}} density {{continues to}} grow at an exponential rate in accordance to Moore’s law, the goal for many Chip Multi-Processor (CMP) systems is to scale the number of on-chip cores proportionally. Unfortunately, off-chip memory bandwidth capacity is projected to grow slowly compared to the desired {{growth in the number}} of cores. This creates a situation in which each core will have a decreasing amount of off-chip bandwidth that it can use to load its data from off-chip memory. The situation in which offchip bandwidth is becoming a performance and throughput bottleneck is referred to as the bandwidth wall problem. In this study, we seek to answer two questions: (1) to what extent does the bandwidth wall problem restrict future multicore scaling, and (2) to what extent are various <b>bandwidth</b> <b>conservation</b> techniques able to mitigate this problem. To address them, we develop a simple but powerful analytical model to predict the number of on-chip cores that a CMP can support given a limited growth in memory traffic capacity. We find that the bandwidth wall can severely limit core scaling. When starting with a balanced 8 -core CMP, in four technology generations the number of cores can only scale to 24, as opposed to 128 cores under proportional scaling, without increasing the memory traffic requirement. We find that various individual <b>bandwidth</b> <b>conservation</b> techniques we evaluate have a wide ranging impact on core scaling, and when combined together, these techniques have the potential to enable super-proportional core scaling for up to 4 technology generations...|$|E

All satellite systems are limited by bandwidth and power, which are both expensive resources. Operators of satellite systems receive fixed allocations of these resources and as a result, are limited in the number of users they can support on one system. To combat this problem and to lower the costs for system operators, certain power and <b>bandwidth</b> <b>conservation</b> methods have been developed. In the past, satellite systems were used to deliver telephony or transaction-based applications. Since telephony is a single application with a predefined bandwidth requirement, a simple resource allocation technique such as Demand Assigned Multiple Access (DAMA) is sufficient. A transaction-based application requires a simple ALOHA channel.

As a result, Bandwidth On Demand (BOD) algorithms were developed to manage resource allocation and Quality of Service mechanisms were developed to identify the needs of different applications.

40|$|Abstract—In {{this work}} we {{consider}} an event-driven wireless visual sensor network (WVSN) comprised of untethered camera nodes and scalar sensors deployed {{in a hostile}} environment. In the event-driven paradigm, each camera node transmits a surveillance frame to the cluster-head only if an event of interest was captured in the frame, for energy and <b>bandwidth</b> <b>conservation.</b> We thus examine a simple image processing algorithm at the camera nodes based on difference frames and the chi-squared detector. We show that the test statistic of the chi-squared detector is equivalent {{to that of a}} robust (non-parametric) detector and that this simple algorithm performs well on indoor surveillance sequences and some, but not all, outdoor sequences. In outdoor sequences containing significant changes in background and lighting, this simple detector may produce a high probability of error and benefits from the inclusion of scalar sensor decisions. The scalar sensor decisions are, however, prone to attack and may exhibit errors that are arbitrarily frequent, pervasive throughout the network and difficult to predict. To achieve attack prediction and mitigation given an attacker whose actions are not known a priori, we employ game-theoretic analysis. We show that the scalar sensor error can be controlled through cluster-head checking and appropriate selection of cluster size. Given this attack mitigation, we employ real-life sequences to determine the total probability of error when individual and combined decisions are utilized and we discuss the ensuing ramifications and performance issues.

40|$|In modern Distributed Control Systems (DCS), an {{industrial}} computer network protocol known as fieldbus {{is used in}} chemical, petro-chemical and other process industries for real-time communication between digital controllers, sensors, actuators and other smart devices. In a closed-loop digital control system, data is transferred from sensor to controller and controller to actuator cyclically in a timely but discontinuous fashion at a specific rate known as sampling-rate or macrocycle through fieldbus. According to the current trend of fieldbus technology, in most industrial control systems, the sampling-rate or macrocycle is fixed {{at the time of}} system configuration. This fixed sampling-rate makes it impossible to use a multi-rate controller that can automatically switch between multiple sampling-rates at run time to gain some advantages, such as network <b>bandwidth</b> <b>conservation,</b> energy conservation and reduction of mechanical wear in actuators. This thesis is concerned about design and implementation of a dual-rate controller which automatically switches between the two sampling-rates depending on system’s dynamic state. To be more precise, the controller uses faster sampling-rate when the process goes through transient states and slower sampling-rate when the process is at steady-state operation. The controller is based on a Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm and a Kalman filter based observer. This thesis starts with theoretical development of the dual-rate controller design. Subsequently, the developed controller is implemented on a Siemens PCS 7 system for controlling a physical process. The investigation has concluded that this control strategy can indeed lead to conservation of network bandwidth, energy savings in field devices and reduction of wear in mechanical actuators in fieldbus based distributed control systems...|$|E
