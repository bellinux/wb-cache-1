I was pretty thirsty, and I picked up mine and took a big swig of it. Right there was where the little lady had made a mistake. She had put in the lemon all right, but she'd forgot the sugar. The best housekeepers slip up sometimes. I thought maybe Miss Sterling was just learning to keep house and cook--that rabbit would surely make you think so--and I says to myself, 'Little lady, sugar or no sugar I'll stand by you,' and I raises up my <b>bowl</b> again <b>and</b> drinks the last drop of the lemonade. And then all the balance of 'em picks up their <b>bowls</b> <b>and</b> does the same. And then I gives Miss Sterling the laugh proper, just to carry it off like a joke, so she wouldn't feel bad about the mistake.|$|R

There, they defeated the heavily favored and previously undefeated 18-0 New England Patriots and spoiled their perfect season. [...] The 2007 New York Giants became the 9th wild card team in NFL history to reach the Super Bowl and the 5th wild card team to win the Super Bowl, and the very first NFC wild card to accomplish the feat. They were the third team in history to win three road playoff games en route to a Super <b>Bowl</b> <b>and</b> <b>set</b> a league record for most consecutive road wins in a single season (11), though the Super Bowl is played on a neutral field rather than an opponent's stadium. It was the 7th league championship season for the New York Giants and their first since they won Super Bowl XXV in 1991.|$|E

5000|$|American Sweetheart was {{produced}} in pale pink, translucent white (Monax), with dessert sets produced in ruby red, Ritz blue, and crystal. The pattern was an elaborate design of lacy swirls, finely detailed and quite feminine, created from a mold-etched pattern. The translucent white, when held up to the light, had a faint bluish hue to it. This unique colored glass is called [...] "Monax" [...] and is sometimes mistaken as milk glass, which is thicker and whiter. American Sweetheart's Monax dishware is thinner, more opaque {{and appears to be}} more delicate. Plates, saucers, <b>bowls,</b> sugar <b>and</b> creamer <b>sets,</b> salt <b>and</b> pepper <b>sets,</b> tumblers, pitchers were created with this pattern. The dessert sets included plates, cups, saucers, sugar <b>and</b> creamer <b>sets,</b> console <b>bowls,</b> <b>and</b> tid-bit <b>sets.</b> American Sweetheart was referred to as the R-pattern and produced from 1930 to 1936.|$|R

60|$|As Baucis had said, {{there was}} but a scanty supper for two hungry travelers. In {{the middle of the}} table was the remnant of a brown loaf, with a piece of cheese on one side of it, and a dish of {{honeycomb}} on the other. There was a pretty good bunch of grapes for each of the guests. A moderately sized earthen pitcher, nearly full of milk, stood at a corner of the board; and when Baucis had filled two <b>bowls,</b> <b>and</b> <b>set</b> them before the strangers, only a little milk remained in the bottom of the pitcher. Alas! it is a very sad business, when a bountiful heart finds itself pinched and squeezed among narrow circumstances. Poor Baucis kept wishing that she might starve for a week to come, if it were possible, by so doing, to provide these hungry folks a more plentiful supper.|$|R

Applewhite led Texas to two Big 12 Championship games, to victory in 2 <b>Bowl</b> games, <b>and</b> <b>set</b> 48 school records along the way.|$|R

40|$|My {{starting}} point for this paper is a Victorian jug, <b>bowl</b> <b>and</b> chamber-pot <b>set,</b> that I encountered displayed in the toilet of a small Yorkshire Museum. The story of this set is the framework for an exploration of literature on how we invest personal, domestic possessions with meaning. Before starting its life in the museum, the jug, <b>bowl</b> <b>and</b> chamber pot <b>set</b> belonged {{to the secretary of}} the museum board. It was gifted to her by a friend 4 or 5 years ago, and she kept it in her bathroom, filled with potpourri, dried flowers and soaps. When she had her bathroom replaced, there was no longer enough surface space for displaying the set. She moved it into storage in the shed, where she still kept it on view to remind her that it needed a new home. Then she thought of putting it on display in the new museum toilet, on an old wooden cabinet she had in her conservatory. Her decision to move it out of her home and into the museum toilet was a creative and caring one, which triggered the washstand’s transformation from a personal possession, into a public historical artifact. The Victorian washstand set has an interesting -and in many ways ordinary- ‘life’ story, punctuated by transitions in meaning, value and purpose. By writing this paper I will ‘visit’ the most significant transitions, and use my visits as the basis for considering literature that discusses peoples’ relationships to their domestic possessions, and practices of keeping them that influence transitions in meaning. In particular, I am seeking instances where the physical and material properties of an object are discussed in relation to meaning-making. </p...|$|R

5000|$|Stannard was {{probably}} trained {{as an artist}} by her father, and her style was influenced by traditional Dutch still life painting, especially the artist Jan van Huysum. Her subjects were mainly fruits—particularly fruits not grown in England—piled in baskets <b>and</b> <b>bowls,</b> <b>set</b> against a monochrome background in natural light and sometimes accented with small insects. Her fine brushwork and multiple paint layers produced a characteristically luminous surface. Stannard is today considered one of Britain's most gifted still life painters.|$|R
