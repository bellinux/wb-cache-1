40|$|Media Advisory Athens, Ga. - According to University of Georgia School of Law Assistant Professor Sonja R. West, {{who specializes}} in the U. S. Supreme Court and {{has served as a}} {{judicial}} clerk for Justice John Paul Stevens, the court 2 ̆ 7 s loss of Stevens opens up a big hole on the bench. 2 ̆ 2 Justice Stevens was unique on the court for his dual roles as both an alliance builder and as a maverick. He was the undisputed leader of the court 2 ̆ 7 s more left-leaning justices and was exceptionally skilled at being able to piece together a majority of five from some of the most unlikely of places. Yet, at the same time, he was an independent thinker and never afraid to stand alone when he felt the case necessitated it, making him one of the court 2 ̆ 7 s most-frequent sole dissenters. 2 ̆ 2 West added that {{there is no doubt that}} there will be a readjustment period for the justices after Stevens steps down. 2 ̆ 2 A new justice simply cannot walk onto the court with the same respect that comes from decades of experience, proven intellect and unparalleled collegiality. If President Barack Obama truly wants to nominate someone in the mold of Justice Stevens, he should start by looking for someone with, of course, the exceptional smarts. The nominee, however, should also have the courage to speak up when no one else will, yet do so in a cordial manner. Justice Stevens always answered his critics, but never attacked them. I think this is part of the secret of his success. 2 ̆ 2 As this change on the U. S. Supreme Court continues to unfold, West can <b>be</b> <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> <b>comment</b> at srwest@uga. edu. West joined the Georgia Law faculty in 2006 as an assistant professor specializing in constitutional law, media law and the U. S. Supreme Court.

40|$|Osgoode Hall Law School Professor to Publish New Book on Corporate Board Diversity TORONTO, November 17, 2014 – New {{research}} by Professor Aaron Dhir of York University’s Osgoode Hall Law School offers compelling {{insights into the}} role law can play in addressing the lack of gender diversity in corporate boardrooms. In his forthcoming book, Challenging Boardroom Homogeneity, {{to be published by}} Cambridge University Press in February, Dhir analyses the homogeneity of corporate boards around the world and the two main ways in which law has been used to address this heated topic of debate. He compares the U. S. model of diversity disclosure with the Norwegian quota model, revealing stark contrasts. Dhir examines the disclosures that the S 2 ̆ 6 P 100 submitted to the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission after the SEC implemented a rule in 2010 requiring companies to report on whether they consider diversity in nominating directors. He finds that since the SEC provides no definition of the term “diversity,” corporations most frequently define the term with reference to a director’s prior experience rather than his or her socio-demographic characteristics. The SEC rule thus gives firms little reason to think seriously about the socio-demographic composition of their boards. By contrast, Dhir’s study of the Norwegian quota model reveals a strategy that has produced very different results. Norway was the first country to enact a board diversity quota and today women in the country hold 40. 5 percent of board positions. While speculation about the effects of corporate board quotas abounds, Dhir, who interviewed Norwegian corporate directors about their experiences under Norway’s controversial law, replaces the conjecture with an account of real-life boardroom reality. “The lack of gender parity in the governance of business corporations has ignited intense global debate, leading policymakers to wrestle with difficult questions that lie at the intersection of market activity and social identity politics,” said Dhir, who is currently a Visiting Professor of Law at Yale Law School. “Regulators globally are now debating what paths to pursue to diversify the upper echelons of their corporate sectors. Canada is no exception. Just last month, the Ontario Securities Commission and eight other provincial and territorial securities regulators announced new disclosure rules that will require Canadian firms to be more forthcoming about the inclusion of women in their governance structures. At the same time, a bill currently under consideration in the Canadian Senate seeks to mandate gender parity in corporate boardrooms. ” Dhir’s research findings are generating considerable media attention ahead of the publication of his book, including coverage in the New York Times, Forbes, and ThinkProgress.
