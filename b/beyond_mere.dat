25|$|The Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association {{argued that}} the court should look <b>beyond</b> <b>mere</b> {{dictionary}} definitions of “sewer” to examine the legal {{meaning of the term}} in the specific context of how that term is used in Proposition 218.

25|$|The Nazi antisemitic program quickly {{expanded}} <b>beyond</b> <b>mere</b> speech. Starting in 1933, repressive {{laws were}} passed against Jews, {{culminating in the}} Nuremberg Laws which removed most {{of the rights of}} citizenship from Jews, using a racial definition based on descent, rather than any religious definition of who was a Jew. Sporadic violence against the Jews became widespread with the Kristallnacht riots, which targeted Jewish homes, businesses and places of worship, killing hundreds across Germany and Austria.|$|E
25|$|Konkani {{is one of}} the few modern Indo-Aryan {{languages}} {{to apply}} the avagraha <b>beyond</b> <b>mere</b> sustenance of an exclamation, cry or shout in speech. It is used by verbs in continuous tense. The avagraha is not used in Standard Konkani in the continuous tense. Its use is however popular and prevalent amongst the Canara Saraswats, both Gaud and Bhanap, writing in their native Amchigele dialect, in the continuous tense with the aim of conforming to the schwa deletion rule.|$|E
25|$|The {{inclusion}} of the elements shown is largely an engineering decision based upon economics, being {{a balance between the}} costs of raw materials, off-site fabrication, component transportation, on-site erection, the availability of machinery and the cost of labor. In other cases the appearance of the structure may take on greater importance and so influence the design decisions <b>beyond</b> <b>mere</b> matters of economics. Modern materials such as prestressed concrete and fabrication methods, such as automated welding, have significantly influenced the design of modern bridges.|$|E

25|$|In religion, {{a prophet}} is an {{individual}} who has been contacted by a divine being in order to speak on the entity's behalf, serving as an intermediary with humanity by delivering messages or teachings from the supernatural source to other people. The message that the prophet conveys is called a prophecy, which transports—at least in Judaism—a message <b>beyond</b> <b>mere</b> pagan soothsaying, augury, divination, or forecasting, and, most prominently in the neviim of the Tanakh, often comprises issues of social justice.|$|E
25|$|Samuel Pepys (1633–1703) is the {{earliest}} diarist who {{is well known}} today; his diaries, preserved in Magdalene College, Cambridge, were first transcribed and published in 1825. Pepys was amongst the first who took the diary <b>beyond</b> <b>mere</b> business transaction notation, {{into the realm of}} the personal. Pepys' contemporary John Evelyn also kept a notable diary, and their works are among the most important primary sources for the English Restoration period, and consist of eyewitness accounts of many great events, such as the Great Plague of London, and the Great Fire of London.|$|E
25|$|From their {{principal}} settlements {{in cities like}} Byblos, Tyre and Sidon, the Phoenicians began to expand their trade influence to their neighbors and {{among the first to}} bring wine to Egypt. From there they expanded from <b>beyond</b> <b>mere</b> trading to establishing colonies of trading cities throughout the Mediterranean. They continued along the southern shores to found Carthage in 814 BC in northern Africa, and from there to the Balearic Islands and the Iberian Peninsula. The Phoenicians were the founders of Málaga and Cádiz in present-day Spain sometime in the 9th century, though a small outpost may have been established even earlier.|$|E

25|$|The modernist {{influence}} went <b>beyond</b> <b>mere</b> aesthetics: urbanisation tied {{to modern}} building techniques {{and the introduction}} of regulations both in building and town planning, and moreover, to the rise of social forces that resulted in a change in political ideology toward the Left, resulting in the Nordic welfare state, and new programmes for public buildings such as hospitals (e.g. the Beckomberga Hospital in western Stockholm (1927-1935) by Carl Westman) and schools (e.g. the Fridhemsplan school, Stockholm, (1925–27) by Georg A. Nilsson). But while Nordic classicism was employed for a number of important public buildings, it was also applied as a model for low-cost housing (e.g. the Puu-Käpylä Garden Town, Helsinki (1920–25) by Martti Välikangas) and domestic architecture in general (e.g. an affordable sense of style for the nouveau-riche).|$|E
25|$|At {{the peak}} of the terror, the {{slightest}} hint of counter-revolutionary thoughts or activities (or, {{as in the case of}} Jacques Hébert, revolutionary zeal exceeding that of those in power) could place one under suspicion, and trials did not always proceed according to contemporary standards of due process. Sometimes people died for their political opinions or actions, but many for little reason <b>beyond</b> <b>mere</b> suspicion, or because some others had a stake in getting rid of them. Most of the victims received an unceremonious trip to the guillotine in an open wooden cart (the tumbrel). In the rebellious provinces, the government representatives had unlimited authority and some engaged in extreme repressions and abuses. For example, Jean-Baptiste Carrier became notorious for the Noyades ("drownings") he organised in Nantes; his conduct was judged unacceptable even by the Jacobin government and he was recalled.|$|E
25|$|A protégé {{of black}} activist and {{educator}} Mary McLeod Bethune, Roundtree {{was selected by}} Bethune for the first class of African-American women to be trained as officers in the newly created Women's Army Auxiliary Corps (later the Women's Army Corps) during World War II. In 1961 she {{became one of the}} first women to receive full ministerial status in the African Methodist Episcopal Church, which had just begun ordaining women at a level <b>beyond</b> <b>mere</b> preachers in 1960. With her controversial admission to the all-white Women's Bar of the District of Columbia in 1962, she broke the color bar for minority women in the Washington legal community. In one of Washington's most sensational and widely covered murder cases, United States v. Ray Crump, tried in the summer of 1965 on the eve of the Watts riots, Roundtree won acquittal for the black laborer accused of the murder of Georgetown socialite (and former wife of a CIA officer) Mary Pinchot Meyer, a woman with romantic ties to President John F. Kennedy.|$|E

500|$|Traherne {{is heavily}} {{influenced}} by the works of Neoplatonist philosophers {{and several of his}} contemporaries who were called the Cambridge Platonists. The Cambridge Platonists were latitudinarians in that they argued for moderation and dialogue between the factions of Puritans and High Churchmen in the Anglican church. [...] They believed that religion and reason could be in harmony with one another based on a mystical understanding of reason—believing that reason rose <b>beyond</b> <b>mere</b> sense perception but was [...] "the candle of the Lord" [...] and an echo of the divine residing within the human soul. [...] Reason was both God-given and of God.|$|E
500|$|Mézières' arrival on the French comics {{scene with}} Valérian was {{contemporaneous}} with the debuts of other notable French science fiction strips including Luc Orient by Greg and Eddy Paape and Lone Sloane by Philippe Druillet. The {{success of these}} strips would eventually lead {{to the creation of}} Métal Hurlant, the highly influential French comics magazine dedicated to science fiction. Mézières' influence has been noticed in such strips as [...] (by Víctor Mora and Carlos Giménez) and Gigantik (by Mora and José Maria Cardona). His visual style has also influenced some American comics artists notably Walt Simonson and Gil Kane. Sometimes this has gone <b>beyond</b> <b>mere</b> influence – following a complaint by Mézières, the artist Angus McKie admitted that several panels of his strip So Beautiful and So Dangerous were copied from the Valérian album Ambassador of the Shadows.|$|E
