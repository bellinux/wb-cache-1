Aluminium wire rings {{can be used as}} cheap gaskets in demountable seals. Aluminium has high thermal conductivity, good corrosion resistance, and low solubility of hydrogen. Loss of strength at high temperatures limits its use in <b>bakeable</b> applications, but aluminium is advantageous for large-size systems due to its lower weight and lower cost than stainless steel. Use of aluminium is limited by difficulties in its welding and brazing. It can be used for x-ray windows.|$|E

40|$|The new GSI {{accelerator}} facilities (FAIR project) {{are planned}} to deliver heavy ion beams of increased energy and highest intensity [1]. Whereas the energy is {{planned to be}} increased roughly {{by a factor of}} 30, the ion beam intensities are planned to be enlarged by three orders of magnitude. To achieve highest beam intensities, medium charged heavy ions (e. g. U 28 +) are accelerated. Since the ionization cross sections for these ions are comparably high, a UHV-accelerator system with a base pressure in the low 10 - 12 mbar regime is required, even under the influence of ion beam loss induced desorption processes.

Instead of using the original three frequency bands, (0. 9 - 1. 6 GHz, 1. 6 - 2. 45 GHz and 2. 4 - 3. 2 GHz) only the first of these was used due to lattice limitations and other constraints. The same pick-ups and kickers are in use at two different energies. As in the AC, simultaneous cooling in all three phase planes is required. Switching between two transmission paths (at 3. 5 GeV/c and 2. 0 GeV/c) became necessary, including separate notch filters and delay compensation for the kicker sections.

The radiation hardness of the proposed wires for the electrostatic septa for high intensity operation has been verified with beam at the HHT cave at GSI. Design and integration of the extraction septa Due to the large magnetic rigidity of the SIS 100 beam, the maximum achievable septum angle and {{the distance of the}} deflected beam {{to the edge of the}} circulating beam is rather small (3 mrad and 11 mm). On the other hand, the extracted beam has to bypass the next quadrupole magnet with an angle of 3 1 / 3 deg. In fact, this large total deflection angle can be realized with three magnetic septa. Since the gap between two neighbouring s. c. quadrupole units is quite short, the integration of the resonance sextupole magnet, three magnetic septa and the internal beam dump in such a cell is challenging.

40|$|Typical beam {{lines are}} {{comprised}} of an assembly of vacuum valves and shutters {{referred to as}} a ''front end'', optical elements to monochromatize, focus and split the photon beam, and an experimental area where a target sample is placed into the photon beam and data from the interaction is detected and recorded. Windows are used to separate sections of beam lines that are not compatible with storage ring ultra high vacuum. Some experimental beam lines share a common vacuum with storage rings. Sections of beam lines are only allowed to vent up to atmospheric pressure using pure nitrogen gas after a vacuum barrier is established to protect ring vacuum. The front end may only be bled up when there is no current in the machine. This is especially true on the VUV storage ring where for most experiments, windows are not used. For the shorter wavelength, more energetic photons of the x-ray ring, beryllium windows are used at various beam line locations so that the monochromator, mirror box or sample chamber may be used in a helium atmosphere or rough vacuum. The window separates ring vacuum from the environment of the downstream beam line components. The stored beam lifetime in the storage rings and the maintenance of desirable reflection properties of optical surfaces depend upon hydrocarbon-free, ultra-high vacuum systems. Storage ring vacuum systems will operate at pressures of {approximately} 1 x 10 {sup {minus} 10 } Torr without beam and {approximately} 1 x 10 {sup {minus} 9 } Torr with beam. Systems are free of hydrocarbons in the sense that no pumps, valves, etc. containing organics are used. Components are all-metal, chemically cleaned and <b>bakeable.</b> To the extent that beam lines share a common vacuum with the storage ring, the same criteria will hold for beam line components. The design philosophy for NSLS beam lines is to use all-metal, hydrocarbon-free front end components and recommend that experimenters use this approach for common vacuum hardware downstream of front ends. O-ring-sealed valves, if used, are not permitted upstream of the monochromator exit aperture. It will be the responsibility of users to demonstrate that their experiment will not degrade the pressure or quality of the storage ring vacuum.

40|$|In {{contrast}} to {{the large number of}} measurements which have been made of the transition probabilities of electric dipole allowed spectral lines, there have been very few experimental determinations of the absolute transition probabilities of electric dipole "forbidden" lines. The radiative lifetimes of the metastable states from which forbidden radiation is emitted may be as long as one second or more and in most laboratory spectral lamps such species are destroyed by collision processes before forbidden radiation can be emitted. However, metastable atoms and molecules play important roles in determining the energy balance of the upper atmosphere and many of the prominent spectral features of the aurorae and the airglow are forbidden by the selection rules for electric dipole radiation. An experimental determination of the radiative lifetime of the 1 S 0 metastable state of atomic oxygen is presented in this thesis. The principal emission from this state is the electric quadrupole 2 1 S 0 - 2 1 D 2 line at 5577 Å, {{which is one of the}} strongest features of the auroral spectrum. The metastable states of oxygen were populated in a pulsed low current discharge through moderate pressures of either neon or argon which were mixed with a trace concentration (typically 10 - 4 torr) of oxygen. In such a discharge, oxygen molecules are dissociated by collision with metastable inert gas atoms and the oxygen atoms so produced are excited to the metastable levels by electron exchange collisions. Atomic recombination is slow so that the oxygen is present mainly in the atomic form. The intensity of the 5577 Å forbidden line was recorded as a function of time during the afterglow period which followed a discharge pulse. The light was detected by a photomultiplier tube and the individual photoelectric events were recorded by the multi-channel scaling technique. The channel address cycle was initiated at the end of each discharge pulse and the photopulses were then counted as the channels of the multiscaler were successively addressed during the afterglow period. In this way, the intensity detected from the afterglow was obtained as a function of channel number or time. The statistical scatter on the recorded signal was reduced by adding the intensities detected from many afterglow cycles. During the late afterglow, the decay of the metastable state population was exponential with decay constant Γ = A′ ⁄ p + Γ 0 + α′p + β′p + α′ o p o where the terms represent respectively diffusion to the walls of the vessel, the reciprocal Γ 0 of the 0 (1 S 0) radiative lifetime and deactivation of metastable atoms during two and three body collisions with both inert gas atoms and oxygen atoms. Here p and p o are the partial pressures of the inert gas and of atomic oxygen respectively, and the coefficients α′, β′ and α′ o are the rate constants for the different collisional deactivation processes. A large volume discharge vessel and inert gas pressures of typically 10 torr were used in order to reduce the loss of metastable population by diffusion. The spectroscopically pure gases used in the experiments were mixed in a <b>bakeable</b> gas handling system. The oxygen partial pressure could not be measured directly because of adsorption of atomic oxygen on the walls of the vessel. Instead, the effect of the 0 (1 S 0) deactivation by atomic oxygen was estimated by correlating the measured decay constants with the observed intensity of the afterglow signal. This intensity decreased as the oxygen was adsorbed. A "reduced" decay constant was determined at each inert gas pressure investigated as the value which would be expected at zero signal intensity or zero oxygen pressure. Afterglow curves were recorded using both neon and argon at pressures ranging between 1 torr and 40 torr and the radiative lifetime of the 0 (1 S 0) metastable state was evaluated by correlating the values of the reduced decay constants obtained at different inert gas pressures. The result °C expt [0 (1 S 0) ] = 0. 76 ± 0. 03 seconds is considerably more accurate than the previous experimental determinations and is in good agreement with the best theoretical estimate °C theory [0 (1 S 0) ] = 0. 80 seconds Furthermore, the result is the first experimental determination of a metastable state radiative lifetime which is sufficiently reliable to be compared to theoretical estimates. Measurements were also made of the coefficients for diffusion of 0 (1 S 0) metastable atoms through neon and argon, and the rate constants for deactivating collisions with neon and argon. The products of the inert gas pressure and the diffusion coefficients were determined as 416 ± 12 torr cm 2 s - 1 for neon at 298 °K, and 268 ± 8 torr cm 2 s - 1 for argon at 298 °K in good agreement with previous measurements. These results are consistent with a Lennard-Jones collision diameter of 2. 85 Å and a force constant ε/k = 21. 7 °K for elastic collisions between two 0 (1 S 0) atoms. Upper limits on the rate constants for two body deactivating collisions between 0 (1 S 0) atoms and inert gas atoms were determined as 4 × 10 - 19 cm 3 s - 1 for neon, and 5. 5 × 10 - 18 cm 3 s - 1 for argon. Deactivation during three body collisions was found to be insignificant compared to the other loss processes. </p...|$|E
