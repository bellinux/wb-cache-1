50|$|There {{might be}} a gender {{difference}} in reporting rates of sick building syndrome because women tend to report more symptoms than men do. Along with this, some {{studies have found that}} women have a more responsive immune system and are more prone to mucosal dryness and facial erythema. Also, women are alleged by some to be more exposed to indoor environmental factors because they have a greater tendency to have clerical jobs, wherein they are exposed to unique office equipment and materials (example: <b>blueprint</b> <b>machines),</b> whereas men often have jobs based outside of offices.|$|R

50|$|Next, the {{original}} is peeled from the diazo paper as the sandwich of master and diazo exits the machine, and the diazo sheet alone is {{fed into the}} developing chamber. Here, fumes of ammonium hydroxide create an extremely alkaline environment. Under these conditions, the azodyes (couplers) react with the remaining diazonium salt and undergo a chemical reaction that results in the unexposed lines changing color from invisible (or yellow) to a visible dark color. The range of colors for these lines is usually blue or black, but sepia (a brownish hue) is also quite popular. When making multiple copies of an original {{no more than four}} or five copies can typically be made at a time, due to the build-up of ammonia fumes, even with ventilation fans in the duplication room. A slight delay of perhaps five minutes is often required for the fumes to subside enough to permit making additional copies if no ventilation exists. Many blueprint shops ran ventilation ducts from the machines to outside. Smaller and mid-size <b>blueprint</b> <b>machines</b> were often outfitted with ammonia neutralizer absorbers which absorbed some of the ammonia for a period of time.|$|R

Laws can characterize what happens in a reliable way, but they do not do this easily. We do not have laws for everything occurring in the world, but only for those situations where what happens in nature is represented by a model: models are <b>blueprints</b> for nomological <b>machines,</b> which in turn give rise to laws.

50|$|Von Neumann's {{goal was}} to specify an {{abstract}} machine which, when run, would replicate itself. In his design, the machine consists of three parts: a 'blueprint' for itself, a mechanism that can read any blueprint and construct the <b>machine</b> (sans <b>blueprint)</b> specified by that blueprint, and a 'copy machine' that can make copies of any blueprint. After the mechanism {{has been used to}} construct the machine specified by the <b>blueprint,</b> the copy <b>machine</b> is used to create a copy of that blueprint, and this copy is placed into the new machine, resulting in a faithful replication of the original machine.|$|R
40|$|The {{issue of}} whether or not it is {{acceptable}} to alter the genetic material of an organism is largely dependent on one’s values. Nonetheless, with values aside, during the process of bioengineering genetic alteration is precisely what happens. Even the name “bioengineering ” combines two words that are almost contradictory. “Bio refers to life, what is not mechanistically predictable or controllable- and engineering refers to making the <b>blueprints</b> for <b>machines</b> that are predictable- but not alive ” (Batalion 2000). The decisions that we are going to have to make in the near future concerning genetic modification could have huge effects on the way we live and on genetic diversity around the globe. Decisions concerning monitoring practices, government involvement in genetically modified (GM) crop regulation, issues with patenting nature and farmer’s livelihoods could have effects on human health, what is socially acceptable and how we value natural systems. Genetic engineering has made a rapid entrance onto the agricultural scene in recent years. The first GM crop that was available commercially was released in 1996. The first GM crop released was round-up ready soybeans and now there are over 4...|$|R
40|$|The {{process of}} {{economic}} development {{is characterized by a}} transformation of the technologies used in production. Technological change in the poor countries has often been seen as a process through which techniques of production invented and first used in the rich countries are imported and adapted for local use. Experimentation and learning have only a minor role to play in this process of technology transfer; production technologies are chosen “off the shelf ” and are often embodied in capital goods imported from rich countries. The crucial determinants of this type of technological change are current and expected factor and product prices- poor countries need devote few resources to the process of invention itself. If the changes in technology which occur as the currently poor countries develop are welldescribed by this notion of the transfer of technology, then this provides one of the “benefits of backwardness ” described by Gerschenkron (1962). Poor countries can free ride on the investments in technology made in rich countries, and this might be one mechanism through which the convergence of productivity levels between poor and rich countries could occur. It can be argued, however, that technological change in poor countries is more complex than a simple transfer of <b>blueprints</b> (or <b>machines)</b> from rich countries. Evenson and Westpha...|$|R

40|$|We {{provide the}} first {{theoretical}} {{analysis of the}} effects of human capital use, innovative activity, and patent protection, on economic growth in a model with many regions. In each region, consumers have constant relative risk-aversion preferences, there is no human capital growth, and there are three kinds of manufacturing activities involving the production of <b>blueprints</b> for inputs (<b>machines),</b> the inputs themselves, and a single final consumption good. Our analysis generates four results. For any given region, we first describe the balanced growth path (BGP) equilibrium and show that the BGP growth rate depends negatively on the rate at which patents expire. Second, we characterize the transitional dynamics in our model. Third, we determine the value of the patent expiry rate that maximizes the equilibrium growth rate of a region. Finally, we show that a policy of offering perpetual patent protection does not necessarily maximize social welfare in a region. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC...|$|R

Thompson finds in Masters' possession a supposedly incriminating file on Carter and a secret Council key. Manfredi becomes concerned with Frost's behavior, {{and her new}} obsession with opening another rift, {{this time with a}} machine of her own design. He meets with Stark—an old friend of his—and the others, and agrees to distract Frost while Carter and Sousa photograph the <b>blueprints</b> for Frost's <b>machine,</b> which Stark and Wilkes build themselves. They open a new rift, and Frost is drawn to it. They use the gamma cannon to knock the Zero Matter from her, into the other dimension; Frost is left insane from her time controlled by the Zero Matter, and is placed in a mental asylum. Thompson gives the secret key to Carter, who is convinced to stay in Los Angeles to be with Sousa. Thompson prepares to return to New York, but is shot in his hotel room; the shooter takes the file on Carter.|$|R
40|$|Free (Libre) /Open Source Software (FLOSS) is an open, {{evolutionary}} {{arena in}} which hundreds and sometimes thousands of users voluntarily explore and design code, spot bugs in code, make contributions to the code, release software, create artwork, and develop licenses in a fashion that is becoming increasingly prevalent in the otherwise hugely monopolised software market. This ‘computerisation movement’ emerged {{as a challenge to}} the monopolisation of the software market by such mammoth firms as Microsoft and IBM, and is portrayed as being revolutionary (Elliot and Scacchi, 2004; DiBona, Ockman, and Stone, 1999; Kling and Iacono, 1988). Its ‘ultimate goal’ is ‘to provide free software to do all of the jobs computer users want to do and thus make proprietary software obsolete’ (Free Software Foundation, 2005). However, if it is to succeed in bringing about a new social order (Kling and Lacono, 1988), this movement must be re-evaluated from a critical standpoint through a look into the practices of knowledge production based on radical licenses for property sharing and development such as the General Public Licence (GPL) and the emerging subjectivities of participants. Free Software may be viewed as a social movement while Open Source is perhaps a development methodology, but it is not always necessary to isolate analysis to one or the other, firstly due to the extensive overlap in software communities, and secondly because their rhizomatic roots emerge from a shared intellectual and moral response to the exploitation of markets by powerful firms (see Elliot and Scacchi, 2004). Here, I query whether the activities of collaborative software producers as well as hardware production communities such as those found in FabLabs, which release playbots and other <b>blueprints</b> for <b>machine</b> replications as well as agricultural and construction initiatives, can indeed be perceived as revolutionary due to their subversive work and production methods. The recursive communities (Kelty 2006; Powell 2008) that develop around these practices are linked, with shared practices, goals and self-perceptions. People’s emerging subjectivities are the most important dimension of such radical production ecologies, because they reflect both the immaterial and material dimensions of the inherently political projects involved...|$|R
50|$|Cinder has {{a meeting}} with the other rulers of Earthen continents and places her {{conditions}} for agreeing to a peace treaty with Earth. They mostly consist of cyborgs and humans being treated equally, and Thorne and the crew be the ones to deliver the cure to earth. One of the leaders, however, makes a point, wondering how they can trust that Lunars will no longer have the desire to possess humans, as this has been a problem between Earth and Luna for decades. Cinder reveals that her late 'stepfather', the husband of Linh Adri, had invented a machine that Lunars could use to disable their Lunar gift without causing Lunar sickness. Similarly, an Earthen could use it to immunize themselves to the Lunar gift. It is also revealed that the <b>blueprints</b> to this <b>machine</b> were hidden inside Cinder's faithful companion Iko, the android who had stayed with Cinder the whole series. In the final chapter, at the pond where Cinder almost died, Cinder tells Kai that she has decided to make Luna a republic so that there won't ever be another ruler like Levana. Kai says that once she abdicates, she can come live in his palace, to show that Lunars and Earthen can live peacefully together. The book ends with Kai asking Cinder if someday, she would consider being Empress of the Eastern Commonwealth. Cinder tells him that she would, and drops the foot she had lost in the first book (Kai having returned it) in the lake.|$|R
40|$|Nancy Cartwright views {{models as}} <b>blueprints</b> for nomological <b>{{machines}}</b> - machines that, if properly shielded, generate law‐like behaviour or regularities. Marcel Boumans {{has argued that}} we can look for devices inside models, which enable us to measure aspects of these regularities. Therefore, if models do produce regular behaviour (Cartwright), they might perhaps generate numbers about phenomena in the world, provided we can locate a good measuring device in the model (Boumans). How do they do this? Models are often understood to consist of internal principles and bridge principles. Both of these {{play a role in}} the measuring process. This paper suggests that we can understand the internal principles to be responsible for generating the regularities displayed by the model - and for many users of the model, this is sufficient use. The bridge principles (following Cartwright - ‘the real bridge principles’) are a matter of picking the right mathematical representation to make the model work with respect to some real world case at hand. These ‘real’ bridge principles may enable the model to generate numbers and so serve to make the model into a measuring device. This paper explores this construction of a measuring device of duration dependence of unemployment. Since search theory cannot be made operational for this purpose duration models, which model of the outflow process of unemployment with a Weibull function, are taken as a representation of reservation wage setting in search models. As I show, this Weibull function serves as a bridge principle to make a measure of the elasticity of response between unemployment benefit and duration of unemployment. It enables measurement to take place by modelling behaviour according to some assumptions, which operate as constraints. While this Weibull function serves this purpose, its assumptions are arbitrary rather than connected to theory, and measurements generated with this bridge principle turn out to be highly sensitive to its specification. The Weibull function does enable the model to function as a measuring device, but the lack of ability to make newly invoked unobservable variables operational makes it of dubious worth...|$|R
