Buser became a naturalized U.S. citizen in a ceremony under the <b>Burled</b> Arch in Nome following the 2002 race. In 2003, Norwegian Robert Sørlie became the first non-resident of the United States to win the race. Winning ceremonies included a giant decorated cupcake with sugar coated huskeys on top.|$|E
25|$|A {{reading room}} was {{continuing}} aft on the starboard side. This space's amidships {{was the first}} class writing room. The forward staircase's highest level was just aft with its <b>burled</b> panels and magnificent modern glass railings. Also, there was an elevator, linking the first class decks {{in this part of}} the ship. The deluxe suite facility started along port and aft passageways, to a small gymnasium, playroom, solarium, and message room on the starboard side. The aft part of Boat Deck, which had its own pool, lido and bar, was cabin class's facility.|$|E
50|$|For example, ash <b>burl</b> {{consistently}} {{looks like}} ash <b>burl</b> and maple <b>burl</b> like maple <b>burl.</b> However, sometimes a <b>burl</b> will not exhibit its telltale character traits —- {{it may have}} the traits {{of more than one}} species or just some of them, but then have an altogether unfamiliar trait. To identify this we can just make an educated guess. Nearly 90 percent of <b>burl</b> treen in North America was fashioned from black ash <b>burl.</b> It is a common misbelief that the majority of <b>burl</b> was fashioned from maple or walnut <b>burl.</b> It should be stressed that not every piece of wood that exhibits a strong or decorative grain is <b>burl.</b>|$|R

500|$|The [...] lobby was paneled in <b>burled</b> {{mahogany}} {{with added}} trim {{heavily influenced by}} Art Deco, a design movement which had been popular during the 1920s and 30s. McCarthy ordered furnishings and decor in 63 shades of green, a nod to his ancestral Ireland. Hedrick's architectural firm had reportedly been the third-largest in the US, however his conservative design for the building's exterior along with its lavish interiors by Robert D. Harrell of Los Angeles drew wide criticism, notably from Frank Lloyd Wright who while being shown the completed facility before it opened, pointed at the lobby ceiling and said to Fay Jones, [...] "That, young man, {{is an example of}} the effects of venereal disease on architecture." [...] Wright also called the Shamrock [...] "an imitation Rockefeller Center" [...] (which had been completed ten years earlier). McCarthy claimed the decor represented [...] "the best of all periods." [...] Time magazine described it as [...] "eclectic." [...] The building's structural design has since been characterized as [...] "more robust and sturdy than sleek and futuristic." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{official}} {{finish line}} is the Red [...] "Fox" [...] Olson Trail Monument, more {{commonly known as the}} [...] "burled arch", in Nome. The original <b>burled</b> arch lasted from 1975 until 2001, when it was destroyed by dry rot and years of inclement weather. The new arch is a spruce log with two distinct burls similar but not identical to the old arch. While the old arch spelled out [...] "End of Iditarod Dog Race", the new arch has an additional word: [...] "End of Iditarod Sled Dog Race".|$|E
2500|$|In 1989 and 1990, a new {{trim level}} to the Electra was offered: the Park Avenue Ultra. The Ultra was {{essentially}} an upgrade to the Electra Park Avenue line, and featured a standard leather trimmed interior with dual 20-way electric front seats (shared with Cadillac's restyled 1989 Sixty Special), lower-body accent exterior paint treatment, distinctive thick-padded vinyl top with limousine-style rear-window surround (available only on Ultra), simulated <b>burled</b> elm trim on the doors and instrument panel, unique aluminum wheels, anti-lock brakes, chromed B-pillar moldings, specific grille and tail lamps, leather-wrapped steering wheel, electronic instrumentation, padded glove-compartment door, unique interior door panel trim, {{and a variety of}} otherwise minor changes. With its long list of standard equipment, the Park Avenue Ultra carried a higher base price than Cadillac's Sedan de Ville. [...] The Park Avenue Ultra did not gain much popular recognition, however, until the following generation of Park Avenue where the [...] "Ultra" [...] badge offered even more features.|$|E

2500|$|The Edward V. Babcock Memorial Room is a plush, carpeted, wood-paneled {{conference room}} {{constructed}} on the 40th floor {{for use as}} the University trustees' boardroom. Funded by a Babcock family grant of $327,000 ($ in [...] dollars) and dedicated in November 1958, all of the room’s features are original, except for the lighting, furniture and carpeting. The room's square shape is modified by four alcoves, in {{one of which is}} a portrait of Babcock by Malcolm Stevens Parcell. The walls, featuring intricate geometric patterns, are paneled in Appalachian white oak with <b>burled</b> walnut inlays and touches of rosewood. The windows, adorned by leaf-patterned curtains, boast a spectacular panoramic view of the surrounding area. The room is also adjoined by a kitchen. Access to the room is limited to a spiral staircase and an elevator, both requiring a key, that originate on the 36th floor. During the early 1970s at the height of student activism, a group of protesting students attempted to barricade the room during a trustees meeting. [...] Today, the trustees have outgrown the room and generally meet in the Assembly Room of the William Pitt Union. [...] The Babcock room now serves as a seminar and meeting room and is also used for special events. A pair of peregrine falcons nests on the balcony outside the room.|$|E
6000|$|Every few years, as {{one might}} say, the Auld Licht kirk gave way and <b>burled</b> its minister. The {{congregation}} turned their empty pockets inside out, and the minister departed in a farmer's cart. The scene was not an amusing one to those who looked on at it. To the Auld Lichts was then the humiliation of seeing their pulpit [...] "supplied" [...] on alternate Sabbaths by itinerant probationers or stickit ministers. When they were not starving themselves to support a pastor the Auld Lichts were saving up for a stipend. They retired with compressed lips to their looms, and weaved and weaved till they weaved another minister. Without the grief of parting with one minister there {{could not have been}} the transport of choosing another. To have had a pastor always might have made them vainglorious.|$|E

2500|$|Redwoods {{may also}} {{reproduce}} using <b>burls.</b> A <b>burl</b> is a woody lignotuber that commonly appears on a redwood tree below the soil line, though usually within [...] in depth {{from the soil}} surface. Coast redwoods develop <b>burls</b> as seedlings from the axils of their cotyledon, a trait that is extremely rare in conifers. When provoked by damage, dormant buds in the <b>burls</b> sprout new shoots and roots. <b>Burls</b> are also capable of sprouting into new trees when detached from the parent tree, though exactly how this happens {{is yet to be}} studied. Shoot clones commonly sprout from <b>burls</b> and are often turned into decorative hedges when found in suburbia.|$|R
6000|$|... "And withal {{it is very}} simple, David. The {{earth was}} once a nebulous mass. It cooled, and as it cooled it shrank. At length a thin crust of solid matter formed upon its outer surface--a sort of shell; but within it was {{partially}} molten matter and highly expanded gases. As it continued to cool, what happened? Centrifugal force <b>burled</b> the particles of the nebulous center toward the crust as rapidly as they approached a solid state. You have seen the same principle practically applied in the modern cream separator. Presently {{there was only a}} small super-heated core of gaseous matter remaining within a huge vacant interior left by the contraction of the cooling gases. The equal attraction of the solid crust from all directions maintained this luminous core in the exact center of the hollow globe. What remains of it is the sun you saw today--a relatively tiny thing at the exact center of the earth. Equally to every part of this inner world it diffuses its perpetual noonday light and torrid heat.|$|E

50|$|Amboyna <b>burl</b> is a {{particularly}} expensive type of <b>burl,</b> much more than bigleaf maple <b>burl,</b> for example. It comes from padauk trees (Pterocarpus spp.) of Southeast Asia. Padauk trees are quite common but <b>burl</b> wood is rare. The amboyna is usually a deep red, although the more rare moudui <b>burl</b> is the same species but the color is from golden yellow to yellow-orange. The sapwood is creamy white with brown streaks. The common use for amboyna is interiors for luxury vehicles, turnery, cabinets, veneer, and furniture.|$|R

50|$|<b>Burl</b> is a {{cancerous}} growth {{on a tree}} or bush. This irregular cell growth makes determining the species difficult unless {{a portion of the}} host or straight grain is available.

50|$|Because of {{the value}} of <b>burls,</b> ancient redwoods in National Parks in Western United States have {{recently}} been poached by thieves for their <b>burls,</b> including at Redwood National and State Parks. Poachers often cut off the <b>burls</b> from the sides of the trunks using chainsaws, which exposes the tree to infection and disease, or fell the entire tree to steal <b>burls</b> higher up. Because of risk of poaching, Jeff Denny, the state park’s redwood coast sector supervisor, encourages those buying <b>burl</b> to inquire where it came from and to ensure it was obtained legally. Legal acquisition methods for <b>burl</b> include trees from private land cleared for new development and from lumber companies with salvage permits.|$|R
