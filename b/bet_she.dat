Homer briefly cheers her up, but shows that he still only wants to win a <b>bet.</b> <b>She</b> agrees to tell Homer who she thinks the winner will be, but she fears that she may be so distraught that she subconsciously wants Homer to lose his bet, leading her to a cryptic prediction: if she still loves Homer, Washington will win; if she does not, Buffalo. As a nervous Homer watches the game at Moe's Tavern, Washington scores {{at the last second}} to win the game. Homer becomes happy and Bart tells Lisa that she still loves Homer, in which she agrees. Homer cancels his bowling date with Barney and—on the Sunday after the Super Bowl—makes good on his promise to go hiking with Lisa.|$|E

2500|$|Welch {{did with}} Fox her first {{starring}} vehicle, the British Modesty Blaise-style spy movie Fathom (1967), filmed in Spain. Second unit director Peter Medak said Welch [...] "was {{at that time}} quite inexperienced, exactly {{like one of those}} American drum majorettes. But she tried very hard and went to see the rushes each day, gradually improving. 'Who's this dumb broad?' people used to say. But I said: 'You wait. I'll <b>bet</b> <b>she</b> makes it.' I liked her very much because she was such a genuine person. And she had a beautiful body which always helps." [...] Welch said her role was [...] "a blown up Barbie doll." [...] Reviewing her performance, the Los Angeles Times film critic said that [...] "each new Raquel Welch picture brings further proof that when Maria Montez died they didn't break the mold. Like Maria, Raquel can't act from here to there, but both ladies seem to have been born to be photographed... this sappiest of spy pictures." ...|$|E

30|$|Intuitively, the {{explanation}} for this result is the following: The spread bookmaker has only one degree of freedom to modulate the actual thresholds that determine the <b>bets.</b> <b>She</b> can make the H and A bets volumes simultaneously larger or smaller, but not individually in order to equalize both scenarios. The worst-case scenario arises when the favorite team wins. Since commission is applied to prizes, when the favorite team wins, the bet volume is not high enough to compensate the low prize for winning a bet.|$|R
