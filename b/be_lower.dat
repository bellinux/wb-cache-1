5|$|A {{division}} of the DOT, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA), regulates safety for the U.S. trucking industry. The FMCSA enforces the length, width, and weight limits of CMVs set by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) for interstate commercial traffic. Interstate commercial traffic is generally limited to a network of Interstate Highways, U.S. Highways, and state highways known as the National Network (NN). Provided the truck remains on the NN, it {{is not subject to}} state limits. These limits (which can <b>be</b> <b>lower</b> or higher than federal limits) come into effect for intrastate commercial traffic, provided the vehicle is not on the NN.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Objective: This study {{investigated}} {{the changes in the}} anterior pituitary hormones of patients who were admitted to an emergency service and diagnosed with acute meningitis. Methods: A total of 21 patients who were admitted to an emergency service between 01 January and 31 October 2012, and diagnosed with meningitis, were included. Blood samples were collected from the patients within an initial 24 hours of admission and at month 6, in order to measure thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), growth hormone (GH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), prolactin (PRL), and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels. The results were analyzed using SSPS- 18 software. Results: Of the patients, 47. 6 % were male, and 52. 4 % were female. At month 6, TSH, LH, and ACTH levels were higher than those measured on admission. This difference was meaningful for TSH, but insignificant for LH and ACTH. At month 6, mean GH, FSH, and PRL levels <b>were</b> <b>lower</b> than admission levels. At the time of admission, FSH <b>was</b> at <b>lower</b> than normal levels in seven patients, LH <b>was</b> <b>lower</b> in six patients, TSH <b>was</b> <b>lower</b> in four patients, GH <b>was</b> <b>lower</b> in four patients, and ACTH in <b>was</b> <b>lower</b> in three patients. At month 6, FSH <b>was</b> <b>lower</b> in five patients, LH <b>was</b> <b>lower</b> in four patients, TSH <b>was</b> <b>lower</b> in one patient, GH <b>was</b> <b>lower</b> in six patients, and ACTH <b>was</b> <b>lower</b> in five patients. Conclusion: The differences between hormone levels at admission and at month 6 show that meningitis causes changes in anterior pituitary hormones...|$|R
5|$|Besides regular sexual {{reproduction}} with meiosis, certain fungi, {{such as those}} in the genera Penicillium and Aspergillus, may exchange genetic material via parasexual processes, initiated by anastomosis between hyphae and plasmogamy of fungal cells. The frequency and relative importance of parasexual events is unclear and may <b>be</b> <b>lower</b> than other sexual processes. It is known {{to play a role in}} intraspecific hybridization and is likely required for hybridization between species, which has been associated with major events in fungal evolution.|$|E
5|$|Bromine is {{intermediate}} in reactivity between chlorine and iodine, {{and is one}} of {{the most}} reactive elements. Bond energies to bromine tend to <b>be</b> <b>lower</b> than those to chlorine but higher than those to iodine, and bromine is a weaker oxidising agent than chlorine but a stronger one than iodine. This can be seen from the standard electrode potentials of the X2/X− couples (F, +2.866V; Cl, +1.395V; Br, +1.087V; I, +0.615V; At, approximately +0.3V). Bromination often leads to higher oxidation states than iodination but lower or equal oxidation states to chlorination. Bromine tends to react with compounds including M–M, M–H, or M–C bonds to form M–Br bonds.|$|E
5|$|Especially in warmer areas, {{the house}} sparrow may build its nests in the open, on the {{branches}} of trees, especially evergreens and hawthorns, or in the nests of large birds such as storks or magpies. In open nesting sites, breeding success tends to <b>be</b> <b>lower,</b> since breeding begins late and the nest can easily be destroyed or damaged by storms. Less common nesting sites include street lights and neon signs, favoured for their warmth; and the old open-topped nests of other songbirds, which are then domed over.|$|E
