25|$|A BWR {{is like a}} PWR {{without the}} steam generator. A <b>boiling</b> <b>water</b> <b>reactor</b> is cooled and moderated by water like a PWR, but at a lower {{pressure}}, which allows the water to boil inside the pressure vessel producing the steam that runs the turbines. Unlike a PWR, there is no primary and secondary loop. The thermal efficiency of these reactors can be higher, {{and they can be}} simpler, and even potentially more stable and safe. This is a thermal neutron reactor design, the newest of which are the Advanced <b>Boiling</b> <b>Water</b> <b>Reactor</b> and the Economic Simplified <b>Boiling</b> <b>Water</b> <b>Reactor.</b>|$|E
25|$|More {{than a dozen}} {{advanced}} reactor designs are {{in various stages of}} development. Some are evolutionary from the PWR, BWR and PHWR designs above, some are more radical departures. The former include the advanced <b>boiling</b> <b>water</b> <b>reactor</b> (ABWR), two of which are now operating with others under construction, and the planned passively safe Economic Simplified <b>Boiling</b> <b>Water</b> <b>Reactor</b> (ESBWR) and AP1000 units (see Nuclear Power 2010 Program).|$|E
25|$|Two {{things are}} {{characteristic}} for the {{pressurized water reactor}} (PWR) when compared with other reactor types: coolant loop separation from the steam system and pressure inside the primary coolant loop. In a PWR, there are two separate coolant loops (primary and secondary), which are both filled with demineralized/deionized water. A <b>boiling</b> <b>water</b> <b>reactor,</b> by contrast, has only one coolant loop, while more exotic designs such as breeder reactors use substances other than water for coolant and moderator (e.g. sodium in its liquid state as coolant or graphite as a moderator). The pressure in the primary coolant loop is typically , which is notably higher than in other nuclear reactors, and nearly twice that of a <b>boiling</b> <b>water</b> <b>reactor</b> (BWR). As an effect of this, only localized boiling occurs and steam will recondense promptly in the bulk fluid. By contrast, in a <b>boiling</b> <b>water</b> <b>reactor</b> the primary coolant is designed to boil.|$|E

50|$|<b>Boiling</b> <b>water</b> <b>reactors</b> (BWR) and Advanced <b>Boiling</b> <b>Water</b> <b>Reactors</b> {{can use a}} {{combination}} of control rods and the speed of recirculation water flow to quickly reduce their power level down to under 60% of rated power, making them useful for overnight load-following. In markets such as Chicago, Illinois where half of the local utility's fleet is BWRs, it is common to load-follow (although less economic to do so).|$|R

25|$|Almost {{the entire}} {{existing}} base of Indian nuclear power (4780 MW) {{is composed of}} first stage PHWRs, {{with the exception of}} the two <b>Boiling</b> <b>Water</b> <b>Reactor</b> (BWR) units at Tarapur.|$|E
25|$|The {{composition}} of corium {{depends on the}} design type of the reactor, and specifically on the materials used in the control rods, coolant and reactor vessel structural materials. There are differences between pressurized water reactor (PWR) and <b>boiling</b> <b>water</b> <b>reactor</b> (BWR) coriums.|$|E
25|$|<b>Water</b> cooled <b>reactor.</b> There are 104 {{operating}} reactors in the United States. Of these, 69 are pressurized <b>water</b> <b>reactors</b> (PWR), and 35 are <b>boiling</b> <b>water</b> <b>reactors</b> (BWR).|$|R

25|$|Activated carbon {{filters are}} used to retain {{radioactive}} gases within the air vacuumed from a nuclear <b>boiling</b> <b>water</b> <b>reactor</b> turbine condenser. The large charcoal beds adsorb these gases and retain them while they rapidly decay to non-radioactive solid species. The solids are trapped in the charcoal particles, while the filtered air passes through.|$|E
25|$|Unit 1 is a 460MW <b>boiling</b> <b>water</b> <b>reactor</b> (BWR-3) {{constructed}} in July 1967. It commenced commercial electrical production on March 26, 1971, and was initially scheduled for shutdown in early 2011. In February 2011, Japanese regulators granted {{an extension of}} ten years for the continued operation of the reactor. It was damaged during the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami.|$|E
25|$|A {{nuclear reactor}} coolant — usually water but {{sometimes}} a gas or a liquid metal (like liquid sodium) or molten salt — is circulated past the reactor core {{to absorb the}} heat that it generates. The heat is carried away from the reactor and is then used to generate steam. Most reactor systems employ a cooling system that is physically separated from the water that will be boiled to produce pressurized steam for the turbines, like the pressurized water reactor. However, in some reactors the water for the steam turbines is boiled directly by the reactor core; for example the <b>boiling</b> <b>water</b> <b>reactor.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Alabama Power Company {{proposed}} constructing four 1,159 MWe General Electric <b>Boiling</b> <b>Water</b> <b>Reactors</b> at {{the site}} approximately 15 miles southeast of Clanton, Alabama.|$|R
50|$|The site {{contains}} two General Electric <b>boiling</b> <b>water</b> <b>reactors,</b> which are cooled by water {{collected from the}} Cape Fear River and discharged into the Atlantic Ocean.|$|R
25|$|BWRs are {{characterized}} by boiling water around the fuel rods in the lower portion of a primary reactor pressure vessel. A <b>boiling</b> <b>water</b> <b>reactor</b> uses 235U, enriched as uranium dioxide, as its fuel. The fuel is assembled into rods housed in a steel vessel that is submerged in water. The nuclear fission causes the water to boil, generating steam. This steam flows through pipes into turbines. The turbines are driven by the steam, and this process generates electricity. During normal operation, pressure {{is controlled by the}} amount of steam flowing from the reactor pressure vessel to the turbine.|$|E
25|$|The Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station {{is located}} in the {{southern}} part of the township. The single-unit 636 MWe <b>boiling</b> <b>water</b> <b>reactor</b> power plant adjoins the Oyster Creek and is owned and operated by Exelon Corporation. It produces 9% of the state's electricity and is the nation's oldest operating nuclear power plant, having first been brought online on December 1, 1969, and is licensed to operate until April 9, 2029. In 2010, Exelon announced that it would close the facility in 2019 as part of an agreement with the State of New Jersey under which the plant would be allowed to operate without cooling towers.|$|E
25|$|Pressurized water {{reactors}} (PWRs) {{constitute the}} large majority of the world's nuclear power plants (notable exceptions being the United Kingdom, Japan, the United States and Canada) and are one of three types of light water reactor (LWR), the other types being boiling water reactors (BWRs) and supercritical water reactors (SCWRs). In a PWR, the primary coolant (water) is pumped under high pressure to the reactor core where it is heated by the energy released by the fission of atoms. The heated water then flows to a steam generator where it transfers its thermal energy to a secondary system where steam is generated and flows to turbines which, in turn, spin an electric generator. In contrast to a <b>boiling</b> <b>water</b> <b>reactor,</b> pressure in the primary coolant loop prevents the water from boiling within the reactor. All LWRs use ordinary water as both coolant and neutron moderator.|$|E
50|$|Units B and C are, like unit A, <b>boiling</b> <b>water</b> <b>reactors.</b> In {{this type}} of <b>reactor,</b> the <b>water</b> flows around the fuel elements, boils, and the steam {{directly}} drives the turbines. Thus, in <b>boiling</b> <b>water</b> <b>reactors,</b> in contrast to pressurized <b>water</b> <b>reactors,</b> {{there is only a}} single, primary coolant loop. Each unit is loaded with 784 fuel elements. One fuel element contains approximately 174 kg uranium and consists of 100 (i.e. 10 x 10) fuel rods. Units B and C together generate a total of approximately 21,000,000,000 kWh of electricity annually. Hence they are calculated to supply approximately 30% of Bavaria's electricity.|$|R
50|$|<b>Boiling</b> <b>water</b> <b>reactors</b> (BWRs) are {{the second}} most common form of light <b>water</b> <b>reactor</b> with a direct cycle design that uses fewer large steam supply {{components}} than the pressurized <b>water</b> <b>reactor</b> (PWR), which employs an indirect cycle. The ABWR is the present state of the art in <b>boiling</b> <b>water</b> <b>reactors,</b> and is the first Generation III reactor design to be fully built, with several reactors complete and operating. The first reactors were built on time and under budget in Japan, with others under construction there and in Taiwan. ABWRs are on order in the United States, including two reactors at the South Texas Project site.|$|R

2500|$|The {{prototype}} {{was constructed}} at the NRTS site from July 1957 to July 1958. It was operational on October 24, 1958. The 3 MW (thermal) <b>boiling</b> <b>water</b> <b>reactor</b> (BWR) used 93.20% {{highly enriched uranium}} fuel. It operated with natural circulation, using light water as a coolant (vs. heavy water) and moderator. ANL used its experience from the BORAX experiments to design the BWR.

The plant {{was turned over to}} the U.S. Army in December 1958 after extensive testing, with Combustion Engineering acting as the lead contractor beginning in February 1959. Members of the U.S. Army, called cadre, began training as plant operators, although some Navy personnel also trained with them.|$|E
2500|$|The {{supercritical}} water reactor (SCWR) is {{a reduced}} moderation water reactor concept that, {{due to the}} average speed of the neutrons that would cause the fission events within the fuel being faster than thermal neutrons, it is more accurately termed an epithermal reactor than a thermal reactor. It uses supercritical water as the working fluid. [...] SCWRs are basically light water reactors (LWR) operating at higher pressure and temperatures with a direct, once-through heat exchange cycle. As most commonly envisioned, it would operate on a direct cycle, much like a <b>boiling</b> <b>water</b> <b>reactor</b> (BWR), but since it uses supercritical water (not {{to be confused with}} critical mass) as the working fluid, it would have only one water phase present, which makes the supercritical heat exchange method more similar to a pressurized water reactor (PWR). [...] It could operate at much higher temperatures than both current PWRs and BWRs.|$|E
