500|$|Although the C5 reached {{retail stores}} {{at the start}} of March 1985, sales had tailed off. Sinclair resorted to hiring teams of {{teenagers}} to drive around London in C5s to promote the vehicle, at a cost to the company of £20 a day. Similar teams were established in Manchester, Birmingham, and Leeds. The company denied that it was a marketing campaign; a spokesman told The Times that [...] "we haven't done... tests on inner city roads. That is what the team is doing. Marketing is not the prime function but will undoubtedly be a spin-off." [...] Sinclair was reported to <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> lack of demand and blamed the press for [...] "a lack of foresight and pessimistic reporting". Matters did not improve. The retail chain Comet acquired 1,600 C5s but nine months later most were still unsold.|$|E
500|$|Due to his immense {{popularity}} {{during his}} lifetime, Holmes was {{often called upon}} to produce commemorative poetry for specific occasions, including memorials, anniversaries and birthdays. Referring to this demand for his attention, he once wrote that he was [...] "a florist in verse, and what would people say / If I came to a banquet without my bouquet?" [...] As critic Hyatt Waggoner noted, however, [...] "very little... survives the occasions that produced it". Holmes became known as a poet who expressed the benefits of loyalty and trust at serious gatherings, as well as one who showed wit at festivities and celebrations. Edwin Percy Whipple for one considered Holmes to be [...] "a poet of sentiment and passion. Those who know him only as a comic lyricist, as the libellous laureate of chirping follow and presumptuous egotism, would <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> clear sweetness and skylark thrill of his serious and sentimental compositions".|$|E
500|$|CDs were {{submitted}} to Weiland containing music in completed demo form, including scratch melodies, which Weiland {{had the option}} to use or discard. Dean did not mind when his melodies were not accepted by Weiland. [...] "hen I write a song, I know what I {{want it to be}} melodically. But Scott always... knocks my melodies out of the water." [...] Weiland worked on the lyrics using these demo arrangements, often making suggestions for musical phrases to be doubled or moved. Weiland was credited for the lyrical melodies, but Robert pointed out, [...] "This record was made in a way that Scott wasn't really there for the creation of these songs, musically." [...] However, both Dean and Robert would <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> direction Weiland would take the songs, which could have been composed with an entirely different vision. Robert found this to be a strength within the band. [...] "People always have this misconception that a band all need to think alike... so many different ways of looking at songs and [...] put together, and that's really the beauty of a great band".|$|E

500|$|Recovered, the nonagenarian Meeker {{began making}} fresh travel plans. [...] With the International Air Races {{to be held}} at Dayton, Ohio, in 1924, Meeker tried to get the War Department to allow him to fly there. [...] He was successful, and flew with the Army pilot, Oakley G. Kelly. [...] At a stop in Boise, Meeker quipped they were making better time than with his ox team, and in Dayton met {{aviation}} pioneer Orville Wright, to whom he commented, [...] "You'd <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> difference between riding in a Prairie Schooner and in an airplane." [...] The publicity was so favorable that the Army had Kelly fly Meeker {{the rest of the way}} to Washington, D.C., where the onetime pioneer met President Calvin Coolidge in October 1924. [...] Meeker returned to Seattle by train. Wanting the government to build a road over Naches Pass, where he had guided his father's party seventy years before, Meeker ran for the Washington House of Representatives in 1924 from the 47th district but was defeated in the Republican primary by 35 votes. In 1925, Meeker drove an ox team for several months while touring in J.C. Miller's Wild West Show.|$|E
2500|$|We {{should not}} <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> lack of ruins in America in general. Actually the {{scarcity}} of identifiable remains in the Old World is even more impressive. In view {{of the nature of}} their civilization one should not be puzzled if the Nephites had left us no ruins at all. People underestimate the capacity of things to disappear, and do not realize that the ancients almost never built of stone. Many a great civilization which has left a notable mark in history and literature has left behind not a single recognizable trace of itself. We must stop looking for the wrong things.|$|E
2500|$|In an interview, Masters {{described}} her fiction: [...] "All my writing is about human behaviour. There's not much drama, no great happenings in it. No violence. It's about the violence that's inside the human heart, I think, {{more than anything}} else". In the same interview she also credits her journalistic career for helping her creative writing: [...] "you would sometimes take quite an ordinary and humble person and write a story about them, and you'd <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> quality that there was in the ordinary human being ... I {{learned a lot about}} human nature, and human behaviour, as a journalist ... there is more in life, more in situations, than meets the eye".|$|E

2500|$|Writer David Malitz of The Washington Post {{felt that}} the album [...] "is overstuffed with high-wattage cameos." [...] adding that [...] "Game {{surrounds}} himself with these stars, regularly gets out-rapped by them and proceeds to thrust his chest out and proclaim his superiority." [...] Los Angeles Times writer Mikael Wood commented that [...] "In stark contrast with such charm merchants as Jay-Z and Lil Wayne, Game’s low likability is no impediment to his art; indeed, The R.E.D. Album, his fourth studio set, succeeds not {{in spite of his}} character [...] flaws but because of them." [...] Carl Chery of XXL gave the album a rating of [...] "L" [...] and noted [...] "Game’s flows and lyrical skills are still sharp, but his narrative hasn’t changed much through the course of four albums". Despite that [...] "one shouldn’t be surprised," [...] David Amidon of PopMatters wrote [...] "A lot of what initially made Game an intriguing artist is missing from this release, replaced instead by fleeting moments of great music and extended periods of mediocrity or whackness." [...] and added that [...] "neither should one <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> schizophrenic nature that pervades much of the album." [...] Pitchfork Media's Jordan Sargent commented that the albums [...] "unsightly storm of star power is the backbone [...] of what could've been a coherent album." [...] Arwa Haider of Metro viewed it as a [...] "cinematic drama of the rapper's Westside life experience, which could easily have become schmaltzy but is fuelled by his rugged wordplay and guests on sharp form." ...|$|E
2500|$|He put Death on hold {{after this}} to {{continue}} Control Denied, {{which he had}} been putting together prior to the release of The Sound of Perseverance, and released The Fragile Art of Existence in 1999. Control Denied also had other players from the latest Death album but featured a melodic metal vocalist. Schuldiner also played guitar in the [...] "supergroup" [...] Voodoocult on the album Jesus Killing Machine in 1994 and played a guest solo on Naphobia's 1995 release, Of Hell on the track [...] "As Ancients Evolve" [...] as a favor to the band's bassist at the time who was a friend of Schuldiner's. Schuldiner was also asked {{to be one of the}} many guest vocalists on Dave Grohl's 2001 Probot. Grohl, Napalm Death, Ozzy Osbourne, and Anthrax all increased efforts to raise funds for Schuldiner's medical bills with Grohl trying to involve Schuldiner on an album he was working on. In a 1999 interview Schuldiner spoke about why he didn't sing on the album The Fragile Art of Existence [...] "...these vocals are all I ever wanted to do in Death but couldn't. I've had this dream of recording like that for years, and it seems like a dream come true. Tim Aymar is an amazing singer and this is the main difference. I think people will <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> violence and strength of the album. Many people are expecting something like Iron Maiden, but, despite being one of my favorite bands, I didn't want to make an Iron Maiden-like album. I wanted to make an unpredictable album, just like I did in Death, I guess. I don't like to make predictable albums." ...|$|E
