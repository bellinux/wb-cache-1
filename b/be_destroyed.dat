The final ground rules agreed upon by the German Admiralstab were that all enemy vessels in Germany's self-proclaimed war zone would <b>be</b> <b>destroyed</b> without warning, that enemy vessels outside the war zone would <b>be</b> <b>destroyed</b> only if armed, and—to avoid antagonizing the United States—that enemy passenger steamers were not to be attacked, regardless of whether in the war zone or not.|$|E
