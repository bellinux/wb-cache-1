50|$|Galvanic {{corrosion}} (also called <b>bimetallic</b> <b>corrosion)</b> is an electrochemical {{process in}} which one metal corrodes preferentially when it is in electrical contact with another, {{in the presence of}} an electrolyte.

40|$|Chemical {{dealloying}} of Pt {{binary alloy}} precursors {{has emerged as}} a novel and important preparation process for highly active fuel cell catalysts. Dealloying is a selective (electro) chemical leaching of a less noble metal M from a M rich Pt alloy precursor material and has been a familiar subject of macroscale corrosion technology for decades. The atomic processes occurring during the dealloying of nanoscale materials, however, are virtually unexplored and hence poorly understood. Here, we have investigated how the morphology and intraparticle composition depend on the particle size of dealloyed Pt-Co and Pt-Cu alloy nanoparticle precursor catalysts. To examine the size-morphology-composition relation, we used a combination of high-resolutionscanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), electron energy loss (EEL) spectroscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and surface-sensitive cycling voltammetry. Our results indicate the existence of three distinctly different size-dependent morphology regimes in dealloyed Pt-Co and Pt-Cu particle ensembles: (i) The arrangement of Pt shell surrounding a single alloy core ("single core-shell nanoparticles") is exclusively formed by dealloying of particles below a characteristic diameter d(multiple cores) of 10 - 15 nm. (ii) Above d(multiple cores), nonporous bimetallic core-shell particles dominate and show structures with irregular shaped multiple Co/Cu rich cores ("multiple cores-shell nanoparticles"). (iii) Above the second characteristic diameter d(pores) of about 30 nm, the dealloyed Pt-Co and Pt-Cu particles start to show surface pits and nanoscale pores next to multiple Co/Cu rich cores. This structure prevails up to macroscopic bulklike dealloyed particles with diameter of more than 100 nm. The size-morphology-composition relationships link the nano to the macro scale and provide an insight into the existing material gap of dealloyed nanoparticles and highly porous bulklike <b>bimetallic</b> particles in <b>corrosion</b> science...|$|R

Duralumin walkways were provided to allow ready access to the engines for maintenance purposes. The tail unit consisted of braced monoplane horizontal and vertical stabilizers; the tailplane was fitted with Flettner-type servo tabs for trimming on the Short Scylla which had the same wings and tail as the Kent. The anodised duralumin fuselage was mounted below the lower wing, with the planing bottom of the hull made of stainless steel (as on the Singapore II) with a transverse main step. The use of stainless steel reduced the frequency of land inspections of the hull.

40|$|In this work, copper <b>bimetallic</b> <b>corrosion</b> and {{inhibition}} in ultra {{large scale}} interconnect fabrication process is explored. Corrosion behavior of physical vapor deposited (PVD) copper on ruthenium on acidic and alkaline solutions was investigated {{with and without}} organic inhibitors. <b>Bimetallic</b> <b>corrosion</b> screening experiments were carried out to determine the corrosion rate. Potentiodynamic polarization experiments yielded information on the galvanic couples and also corrosion rates. XPS and FTIR surface analysis gave important information pertaining inhibition mechanism of organic inhibitors. Interestingly copper in contact with ruthenium in cleaning solution led to increased corrosion rate compared to copper in contact with tantalum. On the other hand when cobalt was in contact with copper, cobalt corroded and copper did not. We ascribe this phenomenon to {{the difference in the}} standard reduction potentials of the two metals in contact and in such a case a less noble metal will be corroded. The effects of plasma etch gases such as CF 4, CF 4 +O 2, C 4 F 8, CH 2 F 2 and SF 6 on copper <b>bimetallic</b> <b>corrosion</b> was investigated too in alkaline solution. It was revealed that the type of etching gas plasma chemistry used in Cu interconnect manufacturing process creates copper surface modification which affects corrosion behavior in alkaline solution. The learning from copper <b>bimetallic</b> <b>corrosion</b> studies will be useful in the development of etch and clean formulations that will results in minimum defects and therefore increase the yield and reliability of copper interconnects...|$|E

This corrosion occurs more in Al, which is the less noble metal (anode) than in Cu (Solacity, 2011).|$|E
40|$|Copper (Cu) {{electrodeposition}} on ruthenium (Ru) oxides was studied due {{to important}} implications in semiconductor industry. Ruthenium, proposed as the copper diffusion barrier/liner material, has higher oxygen affinity to form different oxides. Three different oxides (the native oxide, reversible oxide, and irreversible oxide) were studied. Native oxide can be formed on exposing Ru in atmosphere. The reversible and irreversible oxides can be formed by applying electrochemical potential. Investigation of Cu under potential deposition on these oxides indicates {{the similarity between}} native and reversible oxides by its nature of inhibiting Cu deposition. Irreversible oxide formed on Ru surface is rather conductive and interfacial binding between Cu and Ru is greatly enhanced. After deposition, <b>bimetallic</b> <b>corrosion</b> of Cu/Ru in different polyphenols was studied. Polyphenols are widely used as antioxidants in post chemical mechanical planarization (CMP). For this purpose, different trihydroxyl substituted benzenes were used as antioxidants. Ru, with its noble nature enhances <b>bimetallic</b> <b>corrosion</b> of Cu. Gallic acid (3, 4, 5 - trihydroxybenzoic acid) was chosen as model compound. A mechanism has been proposed {{and validity of the}} mechanism was checked with other antioxidants.

40|$|To form Cu interconnects, dual-damascene {{techniques}} like {{chemical mechanical planarization}} (CMP) and post-CMP became inevitable {{for removing}} the "overburden" Cu and for planarizing the wafer surface. During the CMP processing, Cu interconnects and barrier metal layers experience different electrochemical interactions depending on the slurry composition, pH, and ohmic contact with adjacent metal layers that would set corrosion process. Ruthenium as a replacement of existing diffusion barrier layer will require extensive investigation to eliminate or control the corrosion process during CMP and post CMP. <b>Bimetallic</b> <b>corrosion</b> process was investigated in the ammonium citrate (a complexing agent of Cu in CMP solutions) using micro test patterns and potentiodynamic measurements. The enhanced <b>bimetallic</b> <b>corrosion</b> of copper observed is due to noble behavior of the ruthenium metal. Cu formed Cu(II) -amine and Cu(II) -citrate complexes in alkaline and acidic solutions and a corrosion mechanism has been proposed. The currently used metallization process (PVD, CVD and ALD) require ultra-high vacuum and are expensive. A novel method of Si surface metallization process is discussed {{that can be achieved}} at room temperature and does not require ultra-high vacuum. Ruthenation of Si surface through strong Si-Ru covalent bond formation is demonstrated using different ruthenium carbonyl compounds. RBS analysis accounted for monolayer to sub-monolayer coverage of Si surface. Interaction of other metal carbonyl (like Fe, Re, and Rh) is also discussed. The silicon (111) surface modifications with vinyl terminated organic compounds were investigated to form self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) and there after these surfaces were further functionalized. Acrylonitrile and vinylbenzophenone were employed for these studies. Ketone group of vinylbenzophenone anchored to Si surface demonstrated reactivity with reducing and oxidizing agents...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study, a {{rotating}} electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance {{was used to}} investigate the effect of lead on the leaching of gold in aerated alkaline cyanide solutions. It {{was found that the}} addition of trace amounts of lead substantially increased the leaching rate, and it is believed that the role of lead was to modify the surface of the gold by cementation. Complementary electrochemical studies showed that lead acts in two ways: it reduces the overpotential required for the oxidation of gold and it enhances the reduction of oxygen. Thus, it is likely that <b>bimetallic</b> <b>corrosion</b> was occurring during gold leaching in the presence of lead. The effect of rotation rate, and cyanide and oxygen concentrations were investigated, and {{it was found that the}} action of lead was critically dependent on leaching conditions...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. To {{study the}} {{corrosion}} behaviors on the rod and tube {{materials used in}} oil well {{is very important for}} prolonging oil well repairing periods, lowering oil production maintenance costs and increasing oil production efficiency. Through selecting some kinds of tube and rod materials which are always used in oilfield, chemical corrosion experiment and electrochemical corrosion experiment were carried out under different conditions. The results show that the corrosion rates are accelerated with material prestress increasing, liquid mineralization rate and temperature rising. The nitrified materials have better corrosive resistance than untreated materials. The electrochemical corrosion experiment results show that the electrode potentials of four materials (45, 20 CrMo, J 55, N 80) have tiny difference and don’t exceed 20 mV. The <b>bimetallic</b> <b>corrosion</b> tests show that the couple corrosion of the four selected materials pair can be ignored under short period and oxygen conditions...|$|E
40|$|AlMgSi 0 · 5 -C 35 {{friction}} welds {{were exposed}} to marine climate in Helgoland for 2 years. The corrosion products formed on the samples were investigated in view of their electrochemical reactivity, morphology as well as chemical and phase compositions. Various types of corrosion attack (atmospheric corrosion, <b>bimetallic</b> <b>corrosion</b> and pitting corrosion) were verified. Generally, the corrosion attack of C 35 is stronger than that of aluminium. Aluminium serves as a sacrificial electrode only close to the welding plane. The rust scale formed on the steel side of the friction weld mainly consists of γ-FeOOH and α-FeOOH. Despite the significant chloride concentration inside the rust layer, no β-FeOOH was found. As it is well known, only the γ-FeOOH phase is electrochemically high ly reactive and {{can be reduced to}} Fe 3 O 4, depending on the polarisation potential. The reduction of γ-FeOOH is associated with an increase of oxygen reduction...|$|E
40|$|The {{first part}} of this {{dissertation}} highlights the contents of the electrochemical characterization of Cu and its electroplating on Ru-based substrates. The growth of Ru native oxide does diminish the efficiency of Cu plating on Ru surface. However, the electrochemical formed irreversible Ru hydrate dioxide (RuOxHy) shows better coverage of Cu UPD. The conductive Ru oxides are directly plateable liner materials as potential diffusion barriers for the IC fabrication. The part II of this dissertation demonstrates {{the development of a new}} rapid corrosion screening methodology for effective characterization Cu <b>bimetallic</b> <b>corrosion</b> in CMP and post-CMP environments.

This novel SEC cell can offer cheap, rapid optical screening results, which helps the efficient development of a better ORR catalyst. Also, the SEC method is capable for identifying the poisoning of electrocatalysts. Our data show that the RuOxHy processes several outstanding properties of ORR such as high tolerance of sulfation, high kinetic current limitation and low percentage of hydrogen peroxide...|$|E
40|$|Liquefied {{petroleum}} gas (LPG) {{is used as}} a fuel and intermediate product for petrochemical manufacturing. For storage and transportation, usual LPG tanks will be sealed and pressurized to eliminate the potential evaporative emissions and spillage. However, if there is a leakage, the probability on developing corrosion at the tank’s floor either internally or externally, will cause potential hazardous condition. Corrosion is the destructive attack on a substance, usually metal due to the interaction of chemical or electrochemical reaction with the environment Even though the failure or leakage of storage tanks may not disturb the normal operations but it may have serious impact on economic and environment. Tank floor failures due to corrosion process are dangerous because the leakage would penetrate into the ground for years before it been detected. It has been estimated to a loss of USD 5. 5 billion per year due to the corrosion on the storages (NACE, 1984). External corrosion can be categorized as pitting corrosion, <b>bimetallic</b> <b>corrosion</b> and corrosion caused by water trap. It is very difficult to detect on when and where the corrosion has been set off as the ultrasonic measurements on plates which are irregularly corroded underneath may not give accurate results, and the inspected area is generally too large to be covered by a single probe...|$|E
40|$|In this work, the {{possibility}} of Cu electrodeposition on Ru-Ta alloy thin films is explored. Ru and Ta were sputter deposited on Si substrate with different composition verified by RBS. Four point probe, XRD, TEM and AFM were used to study the properties of Ru-Ta thin films such as sheet resistance, crystallinity, grain size, etc. Cyclic voltammetry is used to study the Cu electrodeposition characteristics on Ru-Ta after various surface pretreatments. The results provide insights on the removal of Ta oxide such that it enables better Cu nucleation and adhesion. <b>Bimetallic</b> <b>corrosion</b> of Cu on modified Ru-Ta surface was studied in CMP related chemicals. In Cu interconnect fabrication process, the making of trenches and vias on low-k dielectric films involves the application of fluorocarbon plasma etch gases. Cu microdots deposited on Ru and Ta substrate were treated by fluorocarbon plasma etch gases such as CF 4, CF 4 +O 2, CH 2 F 2, C 4 F 8 and SF 6 and investigated by using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, contact angle measurement and electrochemical techniques.

40|$|Ruthenium, {{proposed}} {{as a new}} candidate of diffusion barrier, has three different kinds of oxides, which are native oxide, electrochemical reversible oxide and electrochemical irreversible oxide. Native oxide was formed by naturally exposed to air. Electrochemical reversible oxide was formed at lower anodic potential region, and irreversible oxides were formed at higher anodic potential region. In this study, we were focusing {{on the effect of}} copper electrodeposition on each type of oxides. From decreased charge of anodic stripping peaks and underpotential deposition (UPD) waves in cyclic voltammetry (CV), efficiency of Cu deposition dropped off indicating that interfacial binding strength between Cu and Ru oxides was weakened when the Ru surface was covered with irreversible oxide and native oxide. Also, Cu UPD was hindered by both O 2 and H 2 plasma modified Ru surfaces because the binding strength between Cu and Ru was weakened by O 2 and H 2 plasma treatment. Cu/Ru and Cu/Ta <b>bimetallic</b> <b>corrosion</b> was studied for understanding the corrosion behavior between diffusion barrier (Ta and Ru) and Cu interconnects under the post chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) process in semiconductor fabrication. Gallic acid is used in post CMP slurry solution and is known well as antioxidant which is supposed to oxidize itself to prevent other species from oxidizing. However, in this study under the observation of Cu microdot corrosion test, copper was corroded only in gallic acid at specific pH region of alkaline condition which is close to the pH region for post CMP solution formula. With different pH alkaline condition, gallic acid formed different oxidized products which are characterized by cyclic voltammetry and UV-Vis spectroscopy. Therefore, the specific oxidized product from particular pH region condition caused the Cu corrosion. Also, the corrosion rate of Cu microdots was influenced by substrate effect (Cu/Ru and Cu/Ta) and ambient control, which was included in this study...|$|E
40|$|In {{the first}} part of this dissertation, copper <b>bimetallic</b> <b>corrosion</b> and its {{inhibition}} in cleaning processes involved in interconnect fabrication is explored. In microelectronics fabrication, post chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) cleaning is required to remove organic contaminants and particles left on copper interconnects after the CMP process. Use of cleaning solutions, however, causes serious reliability issues due to corrosion and recession of the interconnects. In this study, different azole compounds are explored and pyrazole is found out to be a potentially superior Cu corrosion inhibitor, compared to the most widely used benzotriazole (BTA), for tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide (TMAH) -based post CMP cleaning solutions at pH 14. Micropattern corrosion screening results and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) revealed that 1 mM Pyrazole in 8 wt% TMAH solution inhibits Cu corrosion more effectively than 10 mM benzotriazole (BTA) under same conditions. Moreover, water contact angle measurement results also showed that Pyrazole-treated Cu surfaces are relatively hydrophilic compared to those treated with BTA/TMAH. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis supports Cu-Pyrazole complex formation on the Cu surface. Overall Cu corrosion rate in TMAH-based highly alkaline post CMP cleaning solution is shown to be considerably reduced to less than 1 Å/min by addition of 1 mM Pyrazole. In the second part, a novel technique built in-house called multiple internal Reflection Infrared Spectroscopy (MIR-IR) was explored as a characterization tool for characterization of different low-k structures. In leading edge integrated circuit manufacturing, reduction of RC time delay by incorporation of porous ultra low-k interlayer dielectrics into Cu interconnect nanostructure continues to pose major integration challenges. The main challenge is that porous structure renders interlayer dielectrics mechanically weak, chemically unstable and more susceptible to the RIE plasma etching damages. Besides the challenge of handling weak porous ultra low-k materials, a lack of sensitive metrology to guide systematic development of plasma etching, restoration and cleaning processes is the major stumbling block. We explored Multiple Internal Reflection Infrared Spectroscopy and associated IR techniques as a sensitive (sub- 5 nm) characterization tool to investigate chemical bonding modification across fluorocarbon etch residues and low-k dielectric interface after plasma etching, ashing, UV curing and post-etch cleaning. The new insights on chemical bonding transformation mapping can effectively guide the development of clean-friendly plasma etch for creating ultra low-k dielectric nanostructures with minimal dielectric damages...|$|E
