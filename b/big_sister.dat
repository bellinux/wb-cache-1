25|$|The genre {{began in}} Australia on radio, {{as it had}} in the United States and the United Kingdom. One such radio serial, <b>Big</b> <b>Sister,</b> {{featured}} actress Thelma Scott in the cast and aired nationally for five years beginning in 1942. Probably the best known Australian radio serial was the long-running soap opera Blue Hills, which was created by Gwen Meredith and ran from 1949 to 1976.

The first Australian television soap opera was Autumn Affair (1958) featuring radio personality and Blue Hills star Queenie Ashton making the transition to television. Each episode of this serial ran for 15 minutes and aired each weekday on the Seven Network. Autumn Affair failed to secure a sponsor and ended in 1959 after 156 episodes.

25|$|As a Big Daddy, {{the player}} can attempt to defeat other Big Daddies who are {{themselves}} escorting Little Sisters. Should the player succeed, {{they can then}} choose to either harvest or adopt the Little Sister. While adopted, the Little Sister can lead the player to corpses from whom she can extract more ADAM. While she does this, the player must defend her from splicer attacks and other foes. Once the Little Sister has collected enough ADAM, the player can then return her to an escape vent, where the player must choose to either rescue or harvest the Little Sister. Rescuing her gives the player a modest amount of ADAM but also the possibility of beneficial gifts later; harvesting her yields a large ADAM boost. ADAM can then be spent at Gatherer's Garden machines throughout Rapture to buy new plasmids, gene tonics, slots, or health/eve upgrades. Once the player has either rescued or harvested each of the Little Sisters on the level, the player will be attacked by a <b>Big</b> <b>Sister.</b> The Big Sister's agility and resourcefulness will task the player with a difficult fight before the player can proceed further in the game.|$|E
