5000|$|Ismach Leon, a {{campaign}} manager for the opposition party First Justice said, [...] "The Tupamaros <b>began</b> following <b>me</b> <b>to</b> get <b>me</b> out of Coche (a Caracas slum) because I was campaigning for (conservative candidate) Julio Borges." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No!" [...] she answered. [...] "I must accustom {{myself to}} speak to him. I will <b>begin</b> to-day. Take <b>me</b> <b>to</b> him--but don't let him touch me!" ...|$|R
5000|$|And {{it was in}} the {{subsequent}} search for the biological family of one of my girlfriends that so much trouble <b>began,</b> and led <b>me</b> <b>to</b> reconsider who I am.|$|R
6000|$|... "But before I <b>begin,</b> permit <b>me</b> <b>to</b> {{present to}} you this young officer, who was {{yesterday}} appointed to your regiment. I have already spoken to you of him. This is Cornet Fergus Drummond, a cousin of my own, and whom I recommend strongly to you. As I informed you, he will for the present act {{as one of my}} aides-de-camp." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I want {{to think}} too," [...] said Ethel. [...] "It is the <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> of a new life, and I {{have not been able}} to look at it yet." ...|$|R
60|$|A change {{passed over}} her face as I spoke; a vague doubt of <b>me</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> show itself in her eyes. She drew back a little, without making any reply.|$|R
6000|$|... "No trouble, I assure you, {{and this}} book {{reminds me of}} what I was about to say. Have you an hour to spare for my little niece? Her mother wants her <b>to</b> <b>begin,</b> and desired <b>me</b> <b>to</b> make the inquiry." ...|$|R
6000|$|Now, at this {{information}} I turned positively sick. Nor {{did it make}} me feel better when the youngest of the victims, hearing the executioner's words, flung himself upon his knees, and <b>began</b> <b>to</b> implore <b>me</b> <b>to</b> spare him. His grandfather also addressed me, saying: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not at all. I {{never thought}} {{of such a thing}}. I never dreamed of such a thing when he <b>began</b> talking <b>to</b> <b>me</b> out in the woods at Stalham on Saturday." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You did certainly, and it {{was granted}} with all my heart. I am sure. But if you recollect, I begged {{that you would have}} the {{goodness}} <b>to</b> omit <b>me</b> from the list of your acquaintance for the future; and when we met in public, that you would not take the trouble <b>to</b> recognise <b>me.</b> Will you please to remember this, hereafter? and as the song is <b>beginning,</b> permit <b>me</b> <b>to</b> leave you to the unrestrained enjoyment of the music." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{mentioned}} the hour; {{and she began}} her letter. Before she could have written more than the first two or three lines, she turned round on her seat, and <b>began</b> talking <b>to</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
60|$|Lau. Indeed, papa, now I'll {{tell you}} how it was. I was {{sometime}} taken with a sudden giddiness, and Humphrey seeing <b>me</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> totter, ran to my assistance, quite frightened, poor fellow, and took me in his arms.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is. You {{must have}} some strainch power of {{attracting}} frondship, Van der Kemp, for zee poor yout' is so fond of you zat he <b>began</b> <b>to</b> entreat <b>me</b> <b>to</b> take him, ant he says he vill go on vit zee traders if you refuse to let him follow you." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{must have}} slid {{downward}} {{thousands of feet}} before the steep incline curved gently on to a broad, smooth, snow-covered plateau. Across this I hurtled with slowly diminishing velocity, until at last objects about <b>me</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> take definite shape.|$|R
6000|$|... "To {{save you}} from the devil, of course, Baas," [...] he replied aptly. Then, resting the gun against the stone, the old fellow knelt down by my side and, {{throwing}} his arms around <b>me,</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> blubber over <b>me,</b> exclaiming: ...|$|R
6000|$|She did not answer, but {{continued}} {{staring at the}} letter. I went up to her, and {{put my hand on}} her shoulder, feeling very uncomfortable. She took no notice of <b>me,</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> murmur: [...] "Poor Frankâ€”Poor Frank." [...] That was my father's name.|$|R
60|$|As Screw obeyed I saw a look pass {{between him}} and the two strangers which made <b>me</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> feel a little uneasy. I thought the doctor noticed it too; but he {{preserved}} his countenance, as usual, in a state of the most unruffled composure.|$|R
2500|$|... "And I {{think at}} that time he'd {{made up his mind}} {{that it would be a}} good idea to tie {{intelligence}} into the inner circle of his policy-making and decision-making process. So starting from that time he <b>began</b> <b>to</b> invite <b>me</b> <b>to</b> the Tuesday lunches, and I remained a member of that group until the end of his administration." ...|$|R
60|$|Here {{the girl}} importuned her {{again with the}} utmost earnestness, and cried bitterly, insomuch that my poor Quaker was {{softened}} with it, and <b>began</b> <b>to</b> persuade <b>me</b> <b>to</b> consider of it, and, if it might consist with my affairs, to see her, and hear {{what she had to}} say; but this was afterwards. I return to the discourse.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You mean,' she {{answered}} uneasily, 'that you might apply yourself {{to work when}} your recollection of <b>me</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> fade, and my life to {{become a matter of}} indifference to you? [...] . Yes, go! No,--I cannot bear it! The remedy is worse than the disease. I cannot let you go away!' ...|$|R
60|$|In that vortex {{of visits}} and visitors, that endless vista of amusements and eating and drinking--some hidden spring {{of life in}} <b>me</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> fail. What a little {{self-conscious}} affected donkey I became, shrilly hee-hawing away; the centre of a simpering throng plying me with flattery. What airs I put on.|$|R
60|$|I now {{felt that}} I must ask {{the advice of}} {{somebody}} in regard to this embarrassing and important affair. For a moment I thought of my grandmother, but she would be sure <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> by advising <b>me</b> <b>to</b> change my secretary. She seldom urged <b>me</b> <b>to</b> do what I {{did not want to}} do, but if I offered her a chance <b>to</b> give <b>me</b> advice on this occasion I knew what would be uppermost in her mind.|$|R
60|$|My {{idea was}} to draw out six dollars of it for present use. Someone gave me a chequebook through a wicket and someone else <b>began</b> telling <b>me</b> how <b>to</b> write it out. The people in the bank had the {{impression}} that I was an invalid millionaire. I wrote something on the cheque and thrust it in at the clerk. He looked at it.|$|R
6000|$|... "That," [...] {{answered}} the Soldier, [...] "is a sad, sad story I {{was in love}} with a beautiful Munchkin girl, who lived with a Wicked Witch. The Witch did not wish <b>me</b> <b>to</b> marry the girl, so she enchanted my sword, which <b>began</b> hacking <b>me</b> <b>to</b> pieces. When I lost my legs I went to the tinsmith, Ku-Klip, and he made me some tin legs. When I lost my arms, Ku-Klip made me tin arms, and when I lost my head he made me this fine one out of tin. It was the same way with my body, and finally I was all tin. But I was not unhappy, for Ku-Klip made a good job of me, having had experience in making another tin man before me." ...|$|R
6000|$|Swish-swish! The cutter came by; Noel started {{forward to}} {{her place in the}} row; but {{catching}} her arm, he said: [...] "No, let me do this little bit. I haven't had a day in the fields since the war <b>began.</b> Talk <b>to</b> <b>me</b> while I'm binding." ...|$|R
60|$|From {{that time}} he showed less frequently, and, if anything, he grew slower and heavier. I felt no more rushes. And along about this time I found I could lead him somewhat. This made <b>me</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> work hard. Yet, notwithstanding, I had no hope of {{capturing}} the fish. It was only experience.|$|R
6000|$|... "God knows," [...] he answered. [...] "What {{would have}} {{happened}} if the world had not been made in seven days? I have known you for just about that time. It <b>began</b> by <b>me</b> coming <b>to</b> you at night--like a thief in the night. Where the devil did I hear that? And that man you are married to thinks I am no better than a thief." ...|$|R
5000|$|Sharon Creech {{stated that}} the {{inspiration}} for this story was an occasion when, [...] "I'd been living overseas (England and Switzerland) for about ten years, and I was sadly missing my family back in the States. I thought I'd write a story about normal family chaos and that's how this <b>began,</b> with <b>me</b> trying <b>to</b> {{remember what it was}} like growing up in my family. Writing the story was a way for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> feel as if my family were with me, right there in our little cottage in England.".|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, mamma, beg him, pray him!' exclaimed Sophy. 'I know it {{will make}} <b>me</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> be good! I can't bear not {{to be one of}} those marked and sealed. Oh! and, mamma, you will be my godmother? Can't you? If the gleams of {{goodness}} and brightness do find me out, they are always from you.' ...|$|R
60|$|She did not answer. For a {{long time}} we sat in silence. And then the {{newspaper}} must have moved--a gleam from the fire fell upon her face, lighting up her eyes; and at the sight something in <b>me</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> throb, like a drum warning a city against danger. The next moment the shadow had covered them again.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{remember}} it perfectly. Turenne said a young officer, but I did {{not imagine that}} it could have been but a lad. However, Captain Campbell, I will not detain you here talking, or you will <b>begin</b> by considering <b>me</b> <b>to</b> be a very bad nurse. Directly I received the letter I ordered a chamber to be prepared for you. By this time all will be in readiness, and a lackey ready to disrobe you and assist you to bed." ...|$|R
5000|$|He explained: [...] "Now, when {{everything}} around <b>me</b> <b>begins</b> <b>to</b> shine, when I find myself dancing {{around in my}} back yard for no particular reason other than {{it feels good to}} be alive, when I get this deep sense of gratitude that I don't need drugs or God or doomed romance to fuel myself through the gauntlet of a normal day, I call that feeling 'Transnormal Skiperoo'." ...|$|R
60|$|The spring laziness {{is already}} upon me--insomuch {{that the spirit}} <b>begins</b> <b>to</b> move <b>me</b> <b>to</b> cease from Mississippi {{articles}} and everything else and give myself over to idleness until we go to New Orleans. I have one article already finished, but somehow it doesn't seem as proper a chapter to close with as the one already in your hands. I hope {{to get in a}} mood and rattle off a good one to finish with--but just now all my moods are lazy ones.|$|R
60|$|I {{dropped on}} the sofa. That horrid hungering for revenge, which I felt {{for the first time}} when I knew how Helena had wronged <b>me,</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> degrade and tempt me again. In the effort to get away from this new evil self of mine, I tried to find sympathy in Selina, and called to her to come and sit by <b>me.</b> She seemed <b>to</b> be startled when I looked at her, but she {{recovered}} herself, and came <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> and took my hand.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, yes--I own it," [...] {{she cried}} under her breath, with a drowsy fervour of manner and tone which was quite {{peculiar}} to her. [...] "Don't <b>begin</b> speaking <b>to</b> <b>me</b> as you did, Damon; you will drive <b>me</b> <b>to</b> say words I would {{not wish to}} say to you. I had given you up, and resolved {{not to think of}} you any more; and then I heard the news, and I came out and got the fire ready because I thought that you had been faithful to me." ...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is dedicated}} to my father, Slater Hunter King, who inspired <b>me</b> <b>to</b> work for the educational betterment of all children. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS There are many people that I would like to recognize who inspired <b>me</b> <b>to</b> move down the path of pursuing my career in Higher Education. First and foremost, I {{would like to thank}} my wife Esther, who supported me from the very start, and continued <b>to</b> provide <b>me</b> with unconditional love, encouragement, and sustenance during the hard times and the lean times. Her steadfastness in supporting me during this period was the foundation on which our family rested. I am eternally indebted to her for the sacrifices that she made to keep our family safe and secure while I was away on school and business trips. I am especially grateful to my Mother who was always a source of spiritual strength and guidance <b>to</b> <b>me</b> during my tenure as a graduate student. Her special knack of getting <b>me</b> <b>to</b> see the end in the <b>beginning</b> enabled <b>me</b> <b>to</b> enjoy the process of being a student again, as well as kept my eyes fixed on the prize of finishing my coursework in a timely manner...|$|R
