5|$|The {{original}} {{purpose of the}} Tribal Hidage remains unknown: many scholars {{believe that it was}} a tribute list created by a king, but other possibilities have been suggested. The hidage figures may be purely symbolic and merely reflect the prestige of each territory, or they may represent an early example of <b>book-keeping.</b> Many historians are convinced that the Tribal Hidage originated from Mercia, which dominated southern Anglo-Saxon England until the start of the 9th century, but others have argued that the text was Northumbrian in origin.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, O'Reilly taught English {{to primary}} school {{children}} in Griffith, {{as well as}} singing—most of the pieces were Irish. At Rylstone he taught <b>book-keeping</b> and business, and {{he was promoted to}} the high school at Kandos. During this time he supplemented his income by travelling from town to town, playing in one-off cricket matches {{at the expense of the}} host's club. He worked on his bosie during the period and regularly dismissed outclassed opposition batsmen. O'Reilly regarded his cricketing isolation as highly beneficial as he regarded coaches to be ill-advised and detrimental to development.|$|E
5|$|Construction of {{the railway}} was finally {{completed}} in 1840, and in July the Preston and Wyre Railway opened. The following year St Peter's Church was finished, and Hesketh-Fleetwood appointed as vicar the Rev. St. Vincent Beechey of Hilgay in Norfolk. Also in 1841, the North Euston {{was the fourth}} hotel {{to open in the}} town. Steamer services opened to the Isle of Man, Whitehaven, Ardrossan and Belfast. Fleetwood initially flourished, but Hesketh-Fleetwood had run out of money and was compelled to take out mortgages. He lost the £75,000 he had invested in the Preston and Wyre Railway Company owing to a lack of accounts. Kemp claimed that Hesketh-Fleetwood owed him money, but Kemp refused to explain his <b>book-keeping.</b> In the face of enormous debts Hesketh-Fleetwood sold his estates at Blackpool, Southport, Meols Hall, and Tulketh Hall. Charles bought the Churchtown estate, where {{he and his wife had}} been living, from his brother. In 1844 Hesketh-Fleetwood auctioned off his personal possessions from Rossall Hall and left Lancashire. The Rev. St. Vincent Beechey had set up the Northern Church of England School for boys. Close to bankruptcy, Hesketh-Fleetwood leased the buildings at Rossall Hall to the school for six years, with the option to buy it after nine for £7,000. Thereafter, the school was called Rossall School.|$|E
5|$|Weber's {{best known}} work in {{economics}} concerned the preconditions for capitalist development, particularly {{the relations between}} religion and capitalism, which he explored in The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism {{as well as in}} his other works on the sociology of religion. He argued that bureaucratic political and economic systems emerging in the Middle Ages were essential in the rise of modern capitalism (including rational <b>book-keeping</b> and organisation of formally free labour), while they were a hindrance in the case of ancient capitalism, which had a different social and political structure based on conquest, slavery, and the coastal city-state. Other contributions include his early work on the economic history of Roman agrarian society (1891) and on the labour relations in Eastern Germany (1892), his analysis of the history of commercial partnerships in the Middle Ages (1889), his critique of Marxism, the discussion of the roles of idealism and materialism in the history of capitalism in his Economy and Society (1922) and his General Economic History (1923), a notable example of the kind of empirical work associated with the German Historical School.|$|E

25|$|As {{with all}} public budgets, the EU's budget {{is also at}} risk of maladministration. Every year, the Court of Auditors reports on the {{management}} of the budget. The introduction of transparency and a double-entry <b>book-keeping</b> system is likely to improve budget management.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{attempts}} {{to cover up}} the murders during the war, the investigators were aided by such things as Germany's meticulous <b>book-keeping,</b> such as at various crematoria, as well as willing eye-witness accounts and many confessions among the Gestapo members themselves, who cited that they were only following orders.|$|E
25|$|Other {{informal}} clubs, mainly comprising discussion groups, {{were established}} in the other compounds. They covered topics such as chess and draughts (checkers), <b>book-keeping,</b> sailing, and French conversation lessons.

AI can react to changes overnight or when {{business is not}} taking place. In August 2001, robots beat humans in a simulated financial trading competition. AI has also reduced fraud and financial crimes by monitoring behavioral patterns of users for any abnormal changes or anomalies.|$|E
25|$|The academy's founders {{operated}} the school from a two-story house that provided classrooms for the students. The facility was named Ellen House after its leaser, Ellen Buckle. The academy began {{work with a}} student enrolment of 19, distributed into Forms 1 through to 3. The founders of the academy together with M. F. Dei-Anang and Samuel Sonkor Sackey comprised the initial teaching staff of the school. Sackey worked {{as a teacher and}} Bursar and Awuletey taught shorthand and <b>Book-keeping.</b> Lutterodt set up the science department and Alema taught agricultural science.|$|E
25|$|There can be {{no doubt}} that most early peoples which have left records knew {{something}} of numeration and mechanics, and that a few were also acquainted with the elements of land-surveying. In particular, the Egyptians paid attention to geometry and numbers, and the Phoenicians to practical arithmetic, <b>book-keeping,</b> navigation, and land-surveying. The results attained by these people seem to have been accessible, under certain conditions, to travelers. It is probable that the knowledge of the Egyptians and Phoenicians was largely the result of observation and measurement, and represented the accumulated experience of many ages.|$|E
25|$|The {{accounting}} {{profession is}} not particularly organized in Iran. However, {{the influence of the}} foreign accounting practices implies an evolution and a relation between the Iranian accountants training and the American one. Thus, an increasing number of accountants and Iranian auditors receives an American training and apply it in Iran. This will contribute to strengthen the harmonization of Iranian <b>book-keeping</b> systems with international standards. Iranian banks use interest-based transactions and retain the accounting standards of conventional banking. Following international sanctions, KPMG, PriceWaterhouseCoopers, RSM, Crowe Horwath and Grant Thornton have suspended their activities in Iran in recent years. The main professionals and representative organization in Iran is the Iranian Institute of Certified Accountants.|$|E
25|$|The SM-sarja {{was also}} {{outdated}} on its own, {{as it was}} run according to amateur principles. Clubs {{were not supposed to}} pay their players beyond compensation for lost wages. However, by the 1970s many clubs were already run like businesses and recruited players through a contract of employment, paying their wages secretly and often evading taxes. However, in 1974, accounting reform in Finland extended <b>book-keeping</b> standards to cover sports clubs, and shortfalls were exposed in audit raids. The SM-liiga was to allow wages for players, and clubs were also put under a tighter supervision. They were to establish their own association for SM-liiga ice hockey only, separating their commitments from junior activities and other sports. Copies of all player contracts were to be sent to the SM-liiga to provide players with adequate security, such as insurance and pensions.|$|E
25|$|The Phoenicians, {{noted for}} their {{seafaring}} skills, plied their ships across the Mediterranean, becoming a major trading {{power by the}} 9th century BCE. The Phoenicians imported and exported wood, textiles, glass and produce such as wine, oil, dried fruit and nuts. Their trading skills necessitated a network of colonies along the Mediterranean coast, stretching from modern day Crete through to Tangiers and onto Sardinia The Phoenicians not only traded in tangible goods, but were also instrumental in transporting culture. The Phoenician's extensive trade networks necessitated considerable <b>book-keeping</b> and correspondence. In around 1500 BCE, the Phoenicians developed a consonantal alphabet which was much easier {{to learn that the}} complex scripts used in ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia. Phoenician traders and merchants were largely responsible for spreading their alphabet around the region. Phoenician inscriptions have been found in archaeological sites at a number of former Phoenician cities and colonies around the Mediterranean, such as Byblos (in present-day Lebanon) and Carthage in North Africa.|$|E
25|$|The College of Agricultural and Life Sciences {{fulfills}} the UW–Madison's {{mission as}} a land-grant university, which {{dates back to}} 1862, when Congress passed legislation to establish a national network of colleges devoted to agriculture and mechanics and Wisconsin received 240,000 acres of allotted federal land. In 1885 the university began offering a winter course for farmers, the Agriculture Short Course, which was greatly developed and enhanced by Ransom Asa Moore from 1895 until 1907 and continues today as the Farm and Industry Short Course. In 1889 the university put all of their agricultural offerings under a new College of Agriculture, with W.A. Henry as dean. Professors listed in the 1896 Agricultural Short Course for the College of Agriculture at the University of Wisconsin–Madison listed popular professors such the Dean of the College of Agriculture, W.A. Henry (Feeds and Feeding), S.M. Babcock (Agricultural Chemistry; Farm Dairying), F.H. King (Agricultural Physics, Agricultural Mechanics, and Meteorology), E.S. Goff (Plant Life, Horticulture, and Economic Entomology), H.L. Russell (Bacteriology), J.A. Craig (Breeds: Breeding and Judging Live Stock), Wm. A. Scott (Economics of Agriculture), C.I.

[...] The lawsuit contended that JFK made in excess of $150 million worldwide but the studio claimed that, under its [...] "net profits" [...] accounting formula, the film earned no money, and that Garrison's estate did not receive any of the more than $1 million net profits income he was due.|$|E
500|$|The round {{figures of}} the hidage {{assessments}} make it unlikely they {{were the result of}} an accurate survey. The methods of assessment used probably differed according {{to the size of the}} region. The figures may be of purely symbolic significance, reflecting the status of each tribe at the time it was assessed. The totals given within the text for the figures suggest that the Tribal Hidage was perhaps used as a form of <b>book-keeping.</b> Frank Stenton describes the hidage figures given for the Heptarchy kingdoms as exaggerated and in the instances of Mercia and Wessex, [...] "entirely at variance with other information".|$|E
500|$|The first {{prospectus}} promised [...] "religious {{instruction in}} accordance with the principles of the Christian Faith" [...] and the following subjects: reading, writing, arithmetic, geography, history, English (grammar, composition, and literature), Latin, at least one other foreign European language, mathematics, <b>book-keeping,</b> natural science, drawing, drill, and vocal music. It also said that instruction may also be given [...] "in the use of tools for working in wood", for which a carpentry shed was placed in the yard of Stafford House. At the turn of the 20thcentury, 15 subjects were taught and lessons lasted one hour; school began at nine, and the day included 15 minutes of hymns, prayers and roll calls.|$|E
500|$|The {{funds for}} the {{dividend}} payment were raised by a debenture of £50,000. By the end of 1890 many City figures were suspicious of the Hansard Union, and were calling it [...] "Bottomley's swindle". Despite Bottomley's outward optimism, in December 1890 the company defaulted on the payment of debenture interest and in May 1891, amid growing rumours of insolvency, the debenture holders petitioned for the company's compulsory winding-up. In the same month Bottomley, who had taken at least £100,000 from the company, filed a petition for bankruptcy. Under examination by the Official Receiver, he could not say where the money had gone, and professed total ignorance of the company's <b>book-keeping.</b> After further enquiries, the Board of Trade instituted prosecutions for fraud against Bottomley, Isaacs and two others.|$|E
500|$|Shackleton {{estimated}} {{that he would}} need £50,000 (current value £) {{to carry out the}} simplest version of his plan. He did not believe in appeals to the public: [...] "(they) cause endless <b>book-keeping</b> worries". His chosen method of fund-raising was to solicit contributions from wealthy backers, and he had begun this process early in 1913, with little initial success. The first significant encouragement came in December 1913, when the Government offered him £10,000, provided he could raise an equivalent amount from private sources. The Royal Geographical Society, from which he had expected nothing, gave him £1,000—according to Huntford, Shackleton, in a grand gesture, advised them that he would only need to take up half of this sum. Lord Rosebery, who had previously expressed his lack of interest in polar expeditions, gave £50. In February 1914 The New York Times reported that playwright J. M. Barrie – a close friend of Captain Scott – had confidentially donated $50,000 (about £10,000). With time running out, contributions were eventually secured during the spring and early summer of 1914. Dudley Docker of the Birmingham Small Arms Company (BSA) gave £10,000, wealthy tobacco heiress Janet Stancomb-Wills gave a [...] "generous" [...] sum (the amount was not revealed), and, in June, Scottish industrialist Sir James Caird donated £24,000 (current value £). [...] Shackleton informed the Morning Post that [...] "this magnificent gift relieves me of all anxiety".|$|E
500|$|Within a year {{of moving}} to Manchester, Brady was caught with a sack full of lead seals he had stolen {{and was trying to}} smuggle out of the market. He was sent to Strangeways for three months. Because he was still under 18, he was sentenced to two years in borstal for [...] "training". He was sent to Latchmere House in London, and then Hatfield borstal in the West Riding of Yorkshire. After being {{discovered}} drunk on alcohol he had brewed he was moved to the much tougher unit at Hull. Released on 14 November 1957, Brady returned to Manchester, where he took a labouring job, which he hated, and was dismissed from another job in a brewery. Deciding to [...] "better himself", he obtained a set of instruction manuals on <b>book-keeping</b> from a local public library, with which he [...] "astonished" [...] his parents by studying alone in his room for hours. In January 1959, Brady applied for and was offered a clerical job at Millwards, a wholesale chemical distribution company based in Gorton. He was regarded by his colleagues as a quiet, punctual, but short-tempered young man. He read books including Teach Yourself German and Mein Kampf, as well as works on Nazi atrocities. He rode a Tiger Cub motorcycle, which he used to visit the Pennines.|$|E

Construction of the 'New Schools', designed by Andrew Barrie, commenced in 1787 and was completed the following year. The buildings were constructed on the Mid Links, an area of parkland in the town, and contained separate accommodation for the Grammar School, English School and Writing School. Between the ruin of the old Grammar School and the building of the 'New Schools', the Grammar School operated from rooms in the Town House.|$|E

2500|$|Just as Blood Bowl has {{rules to}} {{encompass}} fouls {{and other forms}} of cheating by players, so too do the rules involve in-game consequences for actions by players that in most games would be considered either neutral <b>book-keeping</b> or downright cheating. For instance, players are responsible for policing each other's accounting for game turns; failing to move the turn marker at the start of one's turn is an [...] "illegal procedure" [...] which costs one of the offending team's valuable re-roll counters. Along the same lines, in some editions coaches are welcome to attempt to set up with more than 11 players on the pitch, and it is down to the other coach to spot this behaviour.

2500|$|Color {{charge is}} conserved, but the <b>book-keeping</b> {{involved}} in this {{is more complicated than}} just adding up the charges, as is done in quantum electrodynamics. One simple way of doing this {{is to look at the}} interaction vertex in QCD and replace it by a color-line representation. The meaning is the following.

2500|$|Montrose Academy {{is seen to}} have {{replaced}} the ancient Grammar School of Montrose which had established itself during the 16th century and absorbed all other existing burgh schools in the area. Its inception as an academy {{was part of a}} broader 18th century development in the Scottish school system towards the inclusion of more practical subjects such as navigation, drawing, arithmetic and <b>book-keeping,</b> alongside the traditional tuition of the Classics. This was seen in other Scottish provincial towns and reflected a commitment to learning which was [...] "rooted in the past, but re-energized and adapted" [...] due to the effects of urban growth and the rise of a commercial elite. Academies were concentrated in the industrial towns of the east. The wide curricular provision was such that an 1866 report complained that [...] "Classics do not occupy a prominent place, and nothing else has been substituted in the way of sound and systematic training".|$|E
2500|$|Potter was demobilised in 1919, {{and spent}} {{a few months in}} his father's office {{learning}} <b>book-keeping,</b> before going to Merton College, Oxford, to study English. His family paid for his university education, a fact that put him in the shadow of his elder sister Muriel (later a form mistress at St Paul's Girls' School, then headmistress of South Hampstead High School), who had won a scholarship to St Hugh's College, Oxford, and had taken a first-class degree. Potter achieved only a second-class degree in English language and literature. On the strength of this he was offered the post of talks producer at the BBC, but turned it down as it was based in the provincial city of Birmingham, where he had no wish to reside. Potter instead tried to earn a living as an elocution teacher in London, advertising [...] "Cockney accents cured", but attracted only one pupil. He then tried his luck as a tutor and schoolmaster before becoming private secretary to a well-known playwright, Henry Arthur Jones.|$|E
2500|$|Hindus {{across the}} world {{celebrate}} Diwali {{in honor of the}} return of Lord Rama, wife Sita, brother Lakshmana and lord Hanuman to Ayodhya from exile of 14 years after Rama defeated Ravana. To honor and celebrate Lord Rama, Sita, Lakshmana and Hanuman returning from Sri Lanka and to illuminate their path, villagers light Diyas to celebrate the triumph of good over evil. For some, Diwali also celebrates the return of Pandavas after 12 years of Vanvas and one year of [...] "Agyatavas" [...] in Mahabharata. Furthermore, Deepavali is linked to the celebration of Lakshmi, who is venerated amongst Hindus as the goddess of wealth and prosperity and is the wife of Lord Vishnu. The 5-day festival of Diwali begins on the day Goddess Lakshmi was born from the churning of cosmic ocean of milk by the Devas (gods) and the Asuras (demons); while the night of Diwali is the day Lakshmi chose Vishnu as her husband and they were married. Along with Lakshmi, devotees make offerings to Ganesha, who symbolizes ethical beginnings and fearless remover of obstacles; Saraswati, who embodies music, literature and learning and Kubera, who symbolizes <b>book-keeping,</b> treasury and wealth management. Other Hindus believe that Diwali is the day Vishnu came back to Lakshmi and their abode in the Vaikuntha; so those who worship Lakshmi receive the benefit of her good mood, and therefore are blessed with mental, physical and material wellbeing during the year ahead.|$|E
