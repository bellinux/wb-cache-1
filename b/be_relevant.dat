Gravitation is too weak to <b>be</b> <b>relevant</b> to individual particle interactions except at extremes of energy (Planck energy) and distance scales (Planck distance). However, since no successful quantum theory of gravity exists, gravitation is not described by the Standard Model.|$|E
5|$|Inspired by Gorée's example, Carabane is {{attempting}} {{to pay homage to}} victims of slavery by starting a small museum like the House of Slaves. Like Gorée and Saint-Louis, Carabane places great importance on its cultural heritage. The architectural reminders of this heritage require significant restoration as they have experienced considerable degradation. In 1964, French anthropologist Louis-Vincent Thomas posed the question of whether Carabane should be preserved, and this question continues to <b>be</b> <b>relevant.</b> The local people suggest that the entire Diogue–Nikine–Carabane area needs saving.|$|E

This may be complicated by adverse circumstances or an emergency situation.|$|E

5|$|Fruit flies (Drosophila), {{because of}} the large array of {{techniques}} available for studying their genetics, have been a natural subject for studying the role of genes in brain development. In spite of the large evolutionary distance between insects and mammals, many aspects of Drosophila neurogenetics have been shown to <b>be</b> <b>relevant</b> to humans. The first biological clock genes, for example, were identified by examining Drosophila mutants that showed disrupted daily activity cycles. A search in the genomes of vertebrates revealed a set of analogous genes, which were found to play similar roles in the mouse biological clock—and therefore almost certainly in the human biological clock as well. Studies done on Drosophila, also show that most neuropil regions of the brain are continuously reorganized throughout life in response to specific living conditions.|$|E
5|$|The well-studied CAS {{proteins}} BCAR1 and NEDD9 {{have important}} roles in cancer and other pathological conditions, which have been addressed in many studies and reviews. EFS has attracted less study. However, the conserved functional properties of EFS relevant to cellular adhesion and migration, and RTK signaling, suggest changes in activity of this protein may also <b>be</b> <b>relevant</b> to cancer and other disease states, influencing prognosis and therapeutic response. The changes in EFS expression and post-translational modification {{in the context of}} disease discussed below are summarized in Table 2.|$|E
5|$|Understanding the Massey Lectures {{were part}} of the Canadian culture, Gopnik, who was born in Philadelphia but lived in Montreal between the ages of 10 to 25, wanted a topic that would <b>be</b> <b>relevant</b> to Canadians but also have {{universal}} appeal: winter. Winter had appeared as a theme or setting in many of his previous writings, and he especially looked forward to talking about ice hockey. Gopnik spent the next year researching and writing the book, alongside another non-fiction book he was working on at the time: The Table Comes First: Family, France, and the Meaning of Food. This other book was released shortly after Winter, and purposefully contained one identical sentence.|$|E

5|$|In a 2015 study, {{high-quality}} genome sequences {{from three}} Asian elephants and two woolly mammoths were compared. Approximately 1.4 million DNA nucleotide {{differences were found}} between mammoths and elephants, which affect the sequence of more than 1,600 proteins. Differences were noted in genes for a number of aspects of physiology and biology that would <b>be</b> <b>relevant</b> to Arctic survival, including development of skin and hair, storage and metabolism of adipose tissue, and perceiving temperature. Genes related to both sensing temperature and transmitting that sensation to the brain were altered. One of the heat-sensing genes encodes a protein, TRPV3, found in skin which also affects hair growth. When inserted into human cells, the mammoth's version of the protein was found to be less sensitive to heat than the elephant's. This is consistent with a previous observation that mice lacking active TRPV3 are likely to spend more time in cooler cage locations than wild type mice, and have wavier hair. There were also several alterations in circadian clock genes, perhaps needed to cope with the extreme polar variation in length of daylight. Similar mutations are known in other Arctic mammals, such as reindeer.|$|E
5|$|Luther lists several criticisms {{advanced}} by laypeople against indulgences in theses 81–91. He presents these as difficult objections his congregants are bringing {{rather than his}} own criticisms. How should he answer those who ask why the pope does not simply empty purgatory {{if it is in}} his power? What should he say to those who ask why anniversary masses for the dead, which were for the sake of those in purgatory, continued for those who had been redeemed by an indulgence? Luther claimed that it seemed strange to some that pious people in purgatory could be redeemed by living impious people. Luther also mentions the question of why the pope, who is very rich, requires money from poor believers to build St. Peter's Basilica. Luther claims that ignoring these questions risks allowing people to ridicule the pope. He appeals to the pope's financial interest, saying that if the preachers limited their preaching in accordance with Luther's positions on indulgences (which he claimed was also the pope's position), the objections would cease to <b>be</b> <b>relevant.</b> Luther closes the Theses by exhorting Christians to imitate Christ even if it brings pain and suffering. Enduring punishment and entering heaven is preferable to false security.|$|E
