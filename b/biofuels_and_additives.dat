40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{high-temperature}} combustion kinetics of n-dibutyl ether (n-DBE), including unimolecular decomposition, H-abstraction by H, H-migration, and C{single bond}C/C{single bond}O β-scission {{reactions of the}} DBE radicals. The energetics of H-abstraction by OH radicals is also studied. All rates are determined computationally using the CBS-QB 3 and G 4 composite methods in conjunction with conventional transition state theory. The B 3 LYP/ 6 - 311 ++G(2 df, 2 pd) method is used to optimize the geometries and calculate the frequencies of all reactive species and transition states for use in ChemRate. Some of the rates calculated in this study vary markedly from those obtained for similar reactions of alcohols or alkanes, particularly those pertaining to unimolecular decomposition and β-scission at the α-β C{single bond}C bond. These variations show that analogies to alkanes and alcohols are, in some cases, inappropriate means of estimating the reaction rates of ethers. This emphasizes the need to establish valid rates through computation or experimentation. Such studies are especially important given that ethers exhibit promising <b>biofuel</b> <b>and</b> fuel <b>additive</b> characteristics. © 2014...|$|R

30|$|In {{the past}} few years, several {{microorganisms}} including cyanobacteria, fungi and bacteria have been proved to produce <b>biofuels</b> <b>and</b> fuel <b>additives</b> using different biomasses (Domínguez de María 2011; Gross 2012; Yan et al. 2009]. E. coli is extensively used as a model organism for biofuel production using pentose and hexose sugars from lignocellulosic biomass (Bokinsky et al. 2011). Now, it has been proved that recombinant E. coli can produce numerous biofuels including ethanol, acetone, butanol, α-pinene, isoprenol, isobutanol and fatty alcohols through biosynthetic pathways (Bokinsky et al. 2011; May et al. 2013; Atsumi et al. 2008; Zhang et al. 2013; Yang et al. 2013). Nevertheless, these biofuels are highly toxic to E. coli, {{and the production of}} new end products which are less or non-toxic to microbial cells is needed to obtain high product yield (Baez et al. 2011) using low-cost or negative-cost biomass. Thus, less toxic metabolic products such as 2, 3 -BD, 1, 3 -propanediol (1, 3 -PDO) and acetoin can be produced through biotechnological routes (Ji et al. 2011). Moreover, an industrially important platform chemical 2, 3 -BD could be produced through the oxidative pathway of recombinant E. coli (Xu et al. 2007). A high heating value (27, 200  J/g) bulk chemical 2, 3 -BD could be used as liquid fuel or fuel additive (Xiao et al. 2012); it has very low toxicity to bacterial cells (Oliver et al. 2013). Therefore, 2, 3 -BD could be a promising alternative for biofuel production through recombinant E. coli strains.|$|R
30|$|Microalgae are {{superior}} in remediation methods because various toxic substances, {{as well as}} other wastes can be treated with algae and most significantly they are non-pathogenic. The menace of accidental discharge of contaminants into the atmosphere instigating human health and environmental issues can be escaped while algae are used to remediate. Algae use the wastes as nutritional sources and enzymatically degrade the contaminants. Metal ions and xenobiotics are recognized for being transformed/detoxified/or volatilized by algal metabolism (Muthukumaran et al. 2005). Algal growth can retain the water clean and make natural water more appropriate for human ingestion. As microalgae use CO 2 as a carbon source, they can grow photoautotrophically without the adding an organic carbon source (Rao et al. 2011). Phycoremediation is mostly eye-catching since it has the capability for dealing with more than one problem on-site. The cultivation of algae in wastewater offers the combined advantages of treatment of the wastewaters, mitigation of greenhouse gases {{and at the same time}} creating algal biomass. This biomass can be used for multiple applications such as bioenergy resources (biogas <b>and</b> <b>biofuels),</b> food <b>additives</b> <b>and</b> protein supplements (human and animal feed), bio-ore for precious heavy metals, fertilizer, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and other valued chemicals (Priyadarshani et al. 2011; Kumar et al. 2013; Sahu et al. 2013). The drawbacks of using microalgae for metal ion remediation are the requirement of energy for drying while using dead microalgae, necessity for being immobilized and has restricted use in the batch systems (Brinza et al. 2007), its small size, low mass index are easily degraded by microorganism (Soeprobowati and Hariyati 2013). It has been recommended that a living species shows better biosorption of metals than dead biomass, probably because of effective membrane binding and metabolic energy-dependent intracellular uptake (Terry and Stone 2002; Doshi et al. 2007). The selection of microalgae for being used in wastewater treatment is done by their robustness against wastewater and by their competence for growing in and taking up nutrients from wastewater (Olguín 2003).|$|R

40|$|Biobased furanics like 5 -hydroxymethylfurfural (5 - 1 -IMF) are {{interesting}} platform chemicals for {{the synthesis of}} <b>biofuel</b> <b>additives</b> <b>and</b> polymer precursors. 5 -HMF is typically prepared from C 6 ketoses like fructose, psicose, sorbose and tagatose. A known byproduct is 2 -hydroxyacetylfuran (2 -HAF), particularly when using sorbose and psicose as the reactants. We here report an experimental and kinetic modeling study on the rate of decomposition of 2 -HAF in a typical reaction medium for 5 -HMF synthesis (water, Bronsted acid), with the incentive to gain insights in the stability of 2 -HAF. A total of 12 experiments were performed (batch setup) in water with sulfuric acid as the catalyst (100 - 170 degrees C, C-H 2 SO 4 ranging between 0. 033 and 1. 37 M and an initial 2 -HAF concentration between 0. 04 and 0. 26 M). Analysis of the reaction mixtures showed a multitude of products, of which levulinic acid (LA) and formic acid (FA) were the most prominent (Y-max,Y-FA = 24 mol %, Y-max,Y-LA = 10 mol %) when using HCI. In contrast, both LA and FA were formed in minor amounts when using H 2 SO 4 as the catalyst. The decomposition reaction of 2 -HAF using sulfuric acid was successfully modeled (R- 2 = 0. 9957) using a first-order approach in 2 - 1 -IAF and acid.
