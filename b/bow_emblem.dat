50|$|Another Chola - Nalam Killi also {{captured}} Vanci. Vanci {{is mentioned}} as Puva Vanci - (Vanci {{that is not}} a flower, meaning a city)(16). A third Chola who captured Karur was Killivalavan The Chera was besieged and never stirred out. The Chola army destroyed the protective forest around Karuvur fort. The trees so cut fell on the sands of An Porunai river. The Poet Alattur Kilar who was an eyewitness to the siege(17) of Karuvur by the Chola gives a description of the war. This siege of Karuvur was seen by another Sangam poet Nappasalaiyar of Marokkam(18). He mentions that 'Karuvur is surrounded by a deep moat with full of water and crocodiles. The Chera is indeed a great ruler, who embossed his royal <b>bow</b> <b>emblem</b> on the lofty Himalayas. He is known for his great chariot. The Chola is now destroying his capital Karuvur, which never witnessed destruction'. The Chera suffered worst defeat in this war. Another Chola Killivalavan, who died at Kurappalli, also captured Karuvur.In these poems the Chera capital is called Vanci, which the ancient commentator, invariably mentions at Karuvur. Thus, Karur continued to be respected as the capital of the Cheras, though it changed hands now and then, the Cholas more often and the Pandya, once invading it. But soon the Chera recaptured it and established his rule.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the reign}} of Raja Raja Chola the Chola coins had on the obverse the tiger emblem and the fish and <b>bow</b> <b>emblems</b> of the Pandya and Chera Dynasties and on the reverse {{the name of the}} King. But during {{the reign of}} Raja Raja Chola {{appeared}} a new type of coins. The new coins had on the obverse the figure of the standing king and on the reverse the seated goddess. The coins spread over a great part of South India and were also copied by the kings of Sri Lanka.|$|R
2500|$|... (Regarding the <b>bowing</b> Hobbit <b>emblem,</b> {{some say}} the boots the hobbit wears {{conflicted}} with the text's description of a bare-footed hobbit, prompting the publisher to replace it. Yet the device comes directly from Tolkien's picture of Bilbo bowing to Smaug on his horde of treasure. Tolkien defended the boots to an astute reader by explaining that Bilbo had acquired them along the way.) ...|$|R
50|$|The Corn Maiden Nimue, the Spring Queen. She is {{the spirit}} of new growth, of both plants and animals. She is the {{daughter}} of the Earth Mother, the spirit of all her children. The Corn Maiden appears as a young girl, her body shining white, holding a silver <b>bow.</b> Her <b>emblem</b> is a six-day-old crescent Moon, which She wears upon her brow. Her grain is Barley.|$|R
2500|$|The American second editions {{from the}} 5th through 14th printings measure 12.7 x 19.0cm, contain 315 {{numbered}} pages, and have end-paper maps printed in black, white, and red. The frontispiece is printed in color, but the remaining color plates {{of the first}} edition have been eliminated. With {{the exception of the}} 5th printing, the cover design is similar to the American first edition, only smaller, differently colored, and lacking the <b>bowing</b> hobbit <b>emblem</b> on the front board. Both variants of the 5th printing, on the other hand, are bound identically to the British printings, with the only distinction being the notation [...] "Houghton Mifflin Company" [...] {{at the base of the}} book's spine.|$|R
25|$|The tiger {{is one of}} {{the animals}} {{displayed}} on the Pashupati seal of the Indus Valley Civilisation. The tiger crest is the emblem on the Chola coins. The seals of several Chola copper coins show the tiger, the Pandya emblem fish and the Chera <b>emblem</b> <b>bow,</b> indicating that the Cholas had achieved political supremacy over the latter two dynasties. Gold coins found in Kavilayadavalli in the Nellore district of Andhra Pradesh have motifs of the tiger, bow and some indistinct marks.|$|R
25|$|Some {{consider}} the first American edition of The Hobbit {{to be the}} most beautifully designed of any edition. Houghton Mifflin chose to print it in a larger size and on heavier stock than Allen & Unwin's first edition, and they chose to include four color plates of Tolkien's original artwork. Margins are ample and the typesetting well crafted for readability. The lettering on the tan cloth cover is printed in deep blue. The <b>bowing</b> hobbit <b>emblem</b> on the front and the dwarf's hood emblem on the spine are filled with bright red. Regrettably, however, the publisher chose to print the end-paper maps in red only, instead of the black and red chosen by Allen & Unwin. They also mistakenly put the Wilderland map in front and the Lonely Mountain map in back, the reverse of the description in the text.|$|R
25|$|A {{series of}} {{changes to the}} book suggest Houghton Mifflin printed the first edition several times. The {{earliest}} copies show the same <b>bowing</b> hobbit <b>emblem</b> on the title page as is visible on the cover, but in outline. At some point, however, the publisher replaced the emblem on the title page with a seated flautist. This earliest printing also has no half-title page. The first two printings mistakenly identify Chapter VII as Chapter VI on page 118, a defect corrected in the third. While generally similar in all the variants, the binding's cloth changes in color and texture in step with other changes. The first printing's table of illustrations lists Thr√≥r's map as the front endpaper, {{in accordance with the}} text (page 30) but contradicting the actual order. The later printings of the first edition list the Wilderland map as the front endpaper, in accordance with the actual order but contradicting the text. This mess was not fully straightened out until the second edition.|$|R
5|$|The tiger {{is one of}} {{the animals}} {{displayed}} on the Pashupati seal of the Indus Valley Civilisation. The tiger was the emblem of the Chola Dynasty and was depicted on coins, seals and banners. The seals of several Chola copper coins show the tiger, the Pandyan emblem fish and the Chera <b>emblem</b> <b>bow,</b> indicating that the Cholas had achieved political supremacy over the latter two dynasties. Gold coins found in Kavilayadavalli in the Nellore district of Andhra Pradesh have motifs of the tiger, bow and some indistinct marks. The tiger symbol of Chola Empire was later adopted by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam and the tiger became a symbol of the unrecognised state of Tamil Eelam and Tamil independence movement.|$|R
60|$|It was a sight. The humblest {{craft that}} floats makes its {{appeal to a}} seaman by the {{faithfulness}} of her life; {{and this was the}} place where one beheld the aristocracy of ships. It was a noble gathering of the fairest and the swiftest, each bearing at the <b>bow</b> the carved <b>emblem</b> of her name, as in a gallery of plaster-casts, figures of women with mural crowns, women with flowing robes, with gold fillets on their hair or blue scarves round their waists, stretching out rounded arms as if to point the way; heads of men helmeted or bare; full lengths of warriors, of kings, of statesmen, of lords and princesses, all white from top to toe; with here and there a dusky turbaned figure, bedizened in many colours, of some Eastern sultan or hero, all inclined forward under the slant of mighty bowsprits as if eager to begin another run of 11,000 miles in their leaning attitudes. These were the fine figure-heads of the finest ships afloat. But why, unless for the love of the life those effigies shared with us in their wandering impassivity, should one try to reproduce in words an impression of whose fidelity there can be no critic and no judge, since such an exhibition of the art of shipbuilding and the art of figure-head carving as was seen from year's end to year's end in the open-air gallery of the New South Dock no man's eye shall behold again? All that patient, pale company of queens and princesses, of kings and warriors, of allegorical women, of heroines and statesmen and heathen gods, crowned, helmeted, bare-headed, has run for good off the sea stretching to the last above the tumbling foam their fair, rounded arms; holding out their spears, swords, shields, tridents in the same unwearied, striving forward pose. And nothing remains but lingering perhaps in the memory of a few men, the sound of their names, vanished a long time ago from the first page of the great London dailies; from big posters in railway-stations and the doors of shipping offices; from the minds of sailors, dockmasters, pilots, and tugmen; from the hail of gruff voices and the flutter of signal flags exchanged between ships closing upon each other and drawing apart in the open immensity of the sea.|$|R
