5|$|The major global industrial-scale use {{of boron}} {{compounds}} (about 46% of end-use) is in production of glass fiber for boron-containing insulating and structural fiberglasses, especially in Asia. Boron {{is added to}} the glass as borax pentahydrate or boron oxide, to influence the strength or fluxing qualities of the glass fibers. Another 10% of global boron production is for <b>borosilicate</b> <b>glass</b> as used in high strength glassware. About 15% of global boron is used in boron ceramics, including super-hard materials discussed below. Agriculture consumes 11% of global boron production, and bleaches and detergents about 6%.|$|E
5|$|Boron is {{primarily}} used in chemical compounds. About {{half of all}} boron consumed globally is an additive in fiberglass for insulation and structural materials. The next leading use is in polymers and ceramics in high-strength, lightweight structural and refractory materials. <b>Borosilicate</b> <b>glass</b> is desired for its greater strength and thermal shock resistance than ordinary soda lime glass. Boron compounds are used as fertilizers in agriculture and in sodium perborate bleaches. A small amount of boron {{is used as a}} dopant in semiconductors, and reagent intermediates in the synthesis of organic fine chemicals. A few boron-containing organic pharmaceuticals are used or are in study. Natural boron is composed of two stable isotopes, one of which (boron-10) has a number of uses as a neutron-capturing agent.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} types of glass fiber used in {{fiberglass}} is E-glass, which is alumino-borosilicate glass {{with less than}} 1% w/w alkali oxides, mainly used for glass-reinforced plastics. Other types of glass used are A-glass (Alkali-lime glass {{with little or no}} boron oxide), E-CR-glass (Electrical/Chemical Resistance; alumino-lime silicate with less than 1% w/w alkali oxides, with high acid resistance), C-glass (alkali-lime glass with high boron oxide content, used for glass staple fibers and insulation), D-glass (<b>borosilicate</b> <b>glass,</b> named for its low Dielectric constant), R-glass (alumino silicate glass without MgO and CaO with high mechanical requirements as reinforcement), and S-glass (alumino silicate glass without CaO but with high MgO content with high tensile strength).|$|E

50|$|Glasses {{containing}} 15-25% B2O3, 65-70% SiO2, {{and smaller}} amounts of alkalis and Al2O3 as additional components have low softening points and low thermal expansion. Sealability to metals {{in the expansion}} range of tungsten and molybdenum and high electrical insulation are their most important features. The increased B2O3 content reduces the chemical resistance; in this respect, high-borate <b>borosilicate</b> <b>glasses</b> differ widely from non-alkaline-earth and alkaline-earth <b>borosilicate</b> <b>glasses.</b> Among this <b>glasses</b> are also <b>borosilicate</b> <b>glasses</b> that transmit UV-ray down to 180 nm, which combine {{the best of the}} borosilicate glass- and the quartz world.|$|R
40|$|Tb 3 +-doped {{aluminum}} <b>borosilicate</b> <b>glasses</b> {{are important}} magneto-optical materials for optical isolators. Optical waveguides are basic components in integrated photonics. By using the ion implantation technique, optical guiding structures {{can be produced}} in Tb 3 +-doped aluminum <b>borosilicate</b> <b>glasses,</b> and miniaturized waveguide isolators can be realized. In this paper, planar waveguides have been fabricated in Tb 3 +-doped aluminum <b>borosilicate</b> <b>glasses</b> by (6. 0 + 5. 5) MeV carbon ion implantation at doses of (8. 0 + 4. 0) 9 10 13 ions/cm(2). The optical properties of optical waveguides are measured by equipments of prism coupling and end-face coupling systems. They are also analyzed by simulation programs of intensity calculation method and beam propagation method.

5|$|Glass {{can also}} be welded to metals and ceramics, {{although}} with metals the process is usually more adhesion {{to the surface of}} the metal rather than a commingling of the two materials. However, certain glasses will typically bond only to certain metals. For example, lead glass bonds readily to copper or molybdenum, but not to aluminum. Tungsten electrodes are often used in lighting but will not bond to quartz glass, so the tungsten is often wetted with molten <b>borosilicate</b> <b>glass,</b> which bonds to both tungsten and quartz. However, care must be taken to ensure that all materials have similar coefficients of thermal expansion to prevent cracking both when the object cools and when it is heated again. Special alloys are often used for this purpose, ensuring that the coefficients of expansion match, and sometimes thin, metallic coatings may be applied to a metal to create a good bond with the glass.|$|E

25|$|The {{windows of}} the photomultipliers act as {{wavelength}} filters; this may be irrelevant if the cutoff wavelengths are outside of the application range or outside of the photocathode sensitivity range, but special care {{has to be taken}} for uncommon wavelengths. <b>Borosilicate</b> <b>glass</b> is commonly used for near-infrared to about 300nm. High borate borosilicate glasses exist also in high UV transmission versions with high transmission also at 254 nm. Glass with very low content of potassium can be used with bialkali photocathodes to lower the background radiation from the potassium-40 isotope. Ultraviolet glass transmits visible and ultraviolet down to 185nm. Used in spectroscopy. Synthetic silica transmits down to 160nm, absorbs less UV than fused silica. Different thermal expansion than kovar (and than <b>borosilicate</b> <b>glass</b> that's expansion-matched to kovar), a graded seal needed between the window {{and the rest of the}} tube. The seal is vulnerable to mechanical shocks. Magnesium fluoride transmits ultraviolet down to 115nm. Hygroscopic, though less than other alkali halides usable for UV windows.|$|E
25|$|Glassblowing is a glassforming {{technique}} that involves inflating molten glass into a bubble (or parison), {{with the aid}} of a blowpipe (or blow tube). A person who blows glass is called a glassblower, glassmith, or gaffer.

The arc discharge is generally confined to a small fused quartz arc tube mounted within a larger <b>borosilicate</b> <b>glass</b> bulb. The outer bulb may be clear or coated with a phosphor.

25|$|In {{order to}} grind {{telescope}} optics into an accurate shape, a highly versatile material {{must be used}} such as glass. The amateur casting process is usually done through a temperature controlled glass fusing kiln, in which layers or chunks of glass (usually plate or <b>borosilicate</b> <b>glass)</b> are stacked on top of or around each other within a round mold specified to aperture size. After the melting point is reached, the glass fuses together and then the annealing process begins. Proper annealing procedures ensure that internal stresses are relieved within the glass, which reduces risk of failure for the newly cast blank.|$|E
25|$|Silica glass can be doped {{with various}} materials. One purpose of doping {{is to raise}} the {{refractive}} index (e.g. with germanium dioxide (GeO2) or aluminium oxide (Al2O3)) or to lower it (e.g. with fluorine or boron trioxide (B2O3)). Doping is also possible with laser-active ions (for example, rare-earth-doped fibers) {{in order to obtain}} active fibers to be used, for example, in fiber amplifiers or laser applications. Both the fiber core and cladding are typically doped, so that the entire assembly (core and cladding) is effectively the same compound (e.g. an aluminosilicate, germanosilicate, phosphosilicate or <b>borosilicate</b> <b>glass).</b>|$|E

They have fairly low coefficients of thermal expansion (7740 Pyrex CTE is 3.25/°C as compared to about 9/°C for a typical soda-lime glass), making them more dimensionally stable. The lower {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} (CTE) also makes them less subject to stress caused by thermal expansion, thus less vulnerable to cracking from thermal shock. They are commonly used for reagent bottles, optical components and household cookware.|$|E

40|$|International audiencehe {{presence}} of sulfur in radioactive waste to be incorporated in <b>borosilicate</b> <b>glasses</b> entails difficulties mainly {{due to the}} relatively low solubility of sulfates in the vitreous phase. In this work a study is presented {{on the effects of}} the ratio R = [Na 2 O]/[B 2 O 3], the type of sulfate added and the addition of V 2 O 5 on the incorporation of sulfates in <b>borosilicate</b> <b>glasses.</b> Glass samples were prepared at the laboratory scale (up to 50 – 100 g) by melting oxide and sulfate powders under air in Pt/Au crucibles.

The main experimental results confirm that the incorporation of sulfates in <b>borosilicate</b> <b>glasses</b> is favored by the network depolymerization, which evolves with the ratio R. The addition of V 2 O 5 seems to accelerate the kinetics of sulfur incorporation in the glass and, probably, increase the sulfate solubility by modifying the borate network and fostering the formation of voids of shape and size compatible with the sulfur coordination polyhedron in the glassy network. The kinetics of X 2 SO 4 incorporation in the glass seems to be slower when X = Cs...|$|R
5|$|The <b>glass</b> forms include <b>borosilicate</b> <b>glasses</b> and {{phosphate}} <b>glasses.</b> <b>Borosilicate</b> {{nuclear waste}} <b>glasses</b> are used on an industrial scale to immobilize high level radioactive waste {{in many countries}} which are producers of nuclear energy or have nuclear weaponry. The glass waste forms {{have the advantage of}} being able to accommodate a wide variety of waste-stream compositions, they are easy to scale up to industrial processing, and they are stable against thermal, radiative, and chemical perturbations. These glasses function by binding radioactive elements to nonradioactive glass-forming elements. Phosphate glasses while not being used industrially have much lower dissolution rates than <b>borosilicate</b> <b>glasses,</b> which make them a more favorable option. However, no single phosphate material has the ability to accommodate all of the radioactive products so phosphate storage requires more reprocessing to separate the waste into distinct fractions. Both glasses have to be processed at elevated temperatures making them unusable for some of the more volatile radiotoxic elements.|$|R
25|$|In 1879 {{the young}} glass {{engineer}} Otto Schott sent Abbe glass samples {{with a special}} composition (lithium silicate glass) that he had prepared himself and that he hoped to show special optical properties.

Nevertheless, Ernst Abbe invited Otto Schott to work on the problem further and to evaluate all possible glass components systematically. Finally, Schott succeeded in producing homogeneous glass samples, and he invented <b>borosilicate</b> <b>glass</b> with the optical properties Abbe needed. These inventions gave rise to the well-known companies Zeiss and Schott Glass (see also Timeline of microscope technology). Systematic glass research was born. In 1908, Eugene Sullivan founded glass research also in the United States (Corning, New York).|$|E

Sugar is added to control the ruthenium chemistry and to stop {{the formation of the}} volatile RuO4 containing radioactive ruthenium isotopes. In the West, the glass is normally a <b>borosilicate</b> <b>glass</b> (similar to Pyrex), while in the former Soviet bloc it is normal to use a phosphate glass. The amount of fission products in the glass must be limited because some (palladium, the other Pt group metals, and tellurium) tend to form metallic phases which separate from the glass. Bulk vitrification uses electrodes to melt soil and wastes, which are then buried underground. In Germany a vitrification plant is in use; this is treating the waste from a small demonstration reprocessing plant which has since been closed down.|$|E

The solder glass can be also applied from molten state {{to the area of}} the future joint during manufacture of the part. Due to their low viscosity in molten state, lead glasses with high PbO content (often 70–85%) are frequently used. The most common compositions are based on lead borates (leaded borate glass or <b>borosilicate</b> <b>glass).</b> Smaller amount of zinc oxide or aluminium oxide can be added for increasing chemical stability. Phosphate glasses can be also employed. Zinc oxide, bismuth trioxide, and copper(II) oxide can be added for influencing the thermal expansion; unlike the alkali oxides, these lower the softening point without increasing of thermal expansion.|$|E

In 1934, Nordberg and Hood discovered that alkali <b>borosilicate</b> <b>glasses</b> separate in soluble (sodium borate rich) and insoluble (silica rich) phases if the glass is thermally treated. By extraction using mineral acids the soluble phase can be removed and a porous silica network remains.
