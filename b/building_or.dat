5|$|Aesthetics as {{a factor}} of well-being. From the early austere {{principle}} that form should strictly follow function, {{there is a growing}} sensibility that aesthetics affect the physical and emotional health of those who use a <b>building</b> <b>or</b> structure. Norwegian laws concerning occupational health have for several decades emphasized access to daylight and fresh air, and it may also be that harsh climatic conditions create an added imperative for uplifting aesthetics.|$|E

The scientists are forced to maintain a 3 kilometer stand-off distance due to the extreme radiation hazard.|$|E

Brunner planned a bridge to cross the railroad tracks and connect the capitol with the highest point in the city at 13thStreet. Brunner had also originally planned to have another bridge span the Susquehanna River, {{on the west side}} of the capitol. After his death, parts of the bridge were redesigned and became the current State Street Bridge, which was completed in 1930.

5|$|Banished {{revolves}} around the player guiding citizens of a remote community of outcasts to grow and maintain a settlement through a command economy. The game focuses on the player's town as a whole, with {{the citizens of the}} town acting as a resource to be managed. The player must assign citizens to various jobs such as <b>building</b> <b>or</b> fishing. The citizens then perform the job without specific direction from the player. Citizens have needs that must be met in order to keep them happy and healthy, such as ensuring enough food is available or that they have a home. Additional citizens come from two sources, the birth of children and the arrival of nomads, wandering groups that wish to join the player's town. The player's citizens will age and eventually die.|$|E
5|$|By the 2000s, the Rohm and Haas Corporate Headquarters needed {{upgrades}} to its building {{systems and}} facilities. The company {{spent two years}} deciding whether to renovate its current <b>building</b> <b>or</b> to move to cheaper, more modern space in Center City. In 2006 Rohm and Haas decided {{to stay in the}} current building and spend up to US$25 million on renovations. The building's architecture and layout were the main reason for the company to stay. The building allows single departments to stay together on the same floor, while in a Center City skyscraper departments would likely have to be spread out over several floors.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the grand}} opening, the theatre {{served as a}} venue for {{vaudeville}} and film, and following the decline of vaudeville as a movie palace until the 1970s. With the economic recession, the advent of television, and movie complex development in the suburbs, crowds dwindled and the theatre struggled to stay open. It was forced to close its doors in 1978 along with the nearby Orpheum theatre. A variety of re-use possibilities were proposed for the theatre including a Chinese restaurant, a triplex movie theater, an office <b>building,</b> <b>or</b> a shopping center. The city of Seattle was unable to protect the theatre as a designated landmark because of its unique position {{on the site of}} the original territorial university grounds owned by the state of Washington.|$|E

5|$|For many years, Germany {{simply had}} no battleships. The Armistice with Germany {{required}} {{that most of}} the High Seas Fleet be disarmed and interned in a neutral port; largely because no neutral port could be found, the ships remained in British custody in Scapa Flow, Scotland. The Treaty of Versailles specified that the ships should be handed over to the British. Instead, most of them were scuttled by their German crews on June 21, 1919 just before the signature of the peace treaty. The treaty also limited the German Navy, and prevented Germany from <b>building</b> <b>or</b> possessing any capital ships.|$|E
5|$|Most major {{shipping}} {{lines have}} a permanent {{presence in the region}} with some combination of sales, distribution, and/or logistical offices, many of which are located in Norfolk.

These companies are either located at the Norfolk World Trade Center <b>building</b> <b>or</b> have constructed buildings in the Lake Wright Executive Center office park. The French firm CMA CGM, the Israeli firm Zim Integrated Shipping Services, and Maersk Line Limited, a subsidiary of the world's largest shipping line, A. P. Moller-Maersk Group, have their North American headquarters in Norfolk. Major companies headquartered in Norfolk include Norfolk Southern, Landmark Communications, Dominion Enterprises, FHC Health Systems (parent company of ValueOptions), Portfolio Recovery Associates, and BlackHawk Products Group.|$|E
