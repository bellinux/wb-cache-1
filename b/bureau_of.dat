5|$|The {{imperial}} household was staffed {{almost entirely}} by eunuchs and ladies with their own bureaus. Female servants were organized into the <b>Bureau</b> <b>of</b> Palace Attendance, <b>Bureau</b> <b>of</b> Ceremonies, <b>Bureau</b> <b>of</b> Apparel, <b>Bureau</b> <b>of</b> Foodstuffs, <b>Bureau</b> <b>of</b> the Bedchamber, <b>Bureau</b> <b>of</b> Handicrafts, and Office of Staff Surveillance. Starting in the 1420s, eunuchs began taking over these ladies' positions until only the <b>Bureau</b> <b>of</b> Apparel with its four subsidiary offices remained. Hongwu had his eunuchs organized into the Directorate of Palace Attendants, but as eunuch power at court increased, so did their administrative offices, with eventual twelve directorates, four offices, and eight bureaus. The dynasty had a vast imperial household, staffed with thousands of eunuchs, who were headed by the Directorate of Palace Attendants. The eunuchs were divided into different directorates in charge of staff surveillance, ceremonial rites, food, utensils, documents, stables, seals, apparel, and so on. The offices {{were in charge of}} providing fuel, music, paper, and baths. The bureaus were in charge of weapons, silverwork, laundering, headgear, bronzework, textile manufacture, wineries, and gardens. At times, the most influential eunuch in the Directorate of Ceremonial acted as a de facto dictator over the state.|$|E
