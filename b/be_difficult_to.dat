5|$|The Golondrina can <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> type {{because of}} its {{similarity}} to other point classifications. In particular the distinction between Golondrina and Plainview is not yet completely resolved.|$|E
5|$|Brook Farm {{was named}} for the brook that ran near the {{roadside}} and that eventually went to the Charles River. It was surrounded by low hills and its meadows and sunny slopes were diversified by orchard, quiet groves and denser pine woods. The land, however, turned out to <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> farm.|$|E

5|$|In some countries, {{the need}} for more land for housing is {{threatening}} small airfields. These airfields may also be used for other general aviation activities, and the addition of gliding may <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> accommodate. This can limit the number of available airfields and so it can require longer drives to reach them.|$|E
5|$|Pneumonia is {{typically}} diagnosed {{based on a}} combination of physical signs and a chest X-ray. However, the underlying cause can <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> confirm, as there is no definitive test able to distinguish between bacterial and non-bacterial origin.|$|E
5|$|Propagation is by seed, {{though these}} can <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> extract from the follicles. Seeds {{do not require}} any {{treatment}} before sowing, and take 12 to 48 days to germinate. Cultivars require propagation by cutting for progeny to grow true. Cuttings are slow to strike. Attempts to graft B.coccinea have met with little success.|$|E

5|$|Since Norfolk {{serves as}} the {{commercial}} and cultural center for the unusual geographical region of Hampton Roads (and in its political structure of independent cities), it can <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> separate the economic characteristics of Norfolk {{from that of the}} region as a whole.|$|E
5|$|The highest notes {{can have}} a shrill, {{piercing}} quality and can <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> tune accurately. Different instruments often play differently in this respect due to {{the sensitivity of the}} bore and reed measurements. Using alternate fingerings and adjusting the embouchure help correct the pitch of these notes.|$|E
5|$|The song {{differs from}} that of the Iberian chiffchaff, which has a shorter djup djup djup wheep wheep chittichittichiittichitta. However, mixed singers occur in the {{hybridisation}} zone and elsewhere, and can <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> allocate to species.|$|E

5|$|Based on {{external}} appearance, Plectania nannfeldtii {{is similar to}} Pseudoplectania vogesiaca. Although this latter species may <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> distinguish by its less hairy external fruit body surface, its microscopic characters identify it more definitively: P.vogesiaca has spores that are much smaller, typically with widths of 12–14µm. Helvella corium is another black cup fungus that appears in the spring; it has smaller spores, whitish margins on the cup edges, and shorter stems than P.nannfeldtii. Pseudoplectania nigrella is smaller, with a hairier outer surface, a darker inner cup surface, and a rudimentary stem.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} {{carnivorous}} {{nature and the}} beauty of their glistening traps, sundews have become favorite ornamental plants; however, the environmental requirements of most species are relatively stringent and can <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> meet in cultivation. As a result, most species are unavailable commercially. A few of the hardiest varieties, however, have made their way into the mainstream nursery business and can often be found for sale next to Venus flytraps. These most often include D. capensis, D. aliciae, and D. spatulata.|$|E
5|$|Besides the director, a matron, {{business}} manager and dietitian staffed a typical camp. An educational director {{was responsible for}} creating recreational, social and educational programs for the men. Church history, Bible and first aid were standard course topics. The strength of instructional programs varied from camp to camp, and after nine hours of physical labor, it could <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> motivate the men to attend classes. Most camps had libraries, some showed current films and camp number 56 (Camp Angel) near Waldport, Oregon had a particular emphasis on the arts. Camps produced newsletters and yearbooks documenting their experiences.|$|E
50|$|Crochet {{has been}} used to {{illustrate}} shapes in hyperbolic space that <b>are</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> reproduce using other media or <b>are</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> understand when viewed two-dimensionally.

50|$|Since {{counterfeiting}} <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> detect, investigate, quantify, or stop, {{the quantity}} of counterfeit medication <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> determine.

50|$|Usually, it <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> {{analyze the}} {{asymptotic}} stability of time-varying systems because it <b>is</b> very <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> find Lyapunov functions {{with a negative}} definite derivative.|$|R
5|$|Birt–Hogg–Dubé can <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> {{diagnose}} from symptoms alone, because hereditary renal cancers, pneumothorax, and cutaneous tumors {{occur with}} other syndromes. Hereditary bilateral, multifocal kidney tumors {{similar to those}} seen in BHDcan occur with von Hippel–Lindau disease (clear cell renal cell carcinoma), hereditary papillary renal cancer (papillary renal cell carcinoma), and hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer syndrome. They are differentiated with examination of the tumors' histology.|$|E
5|$|Blomkamp {{declared}} the project dead in late 2007, but Jackson replied {{that the film}} would still be made. Blomkamp and Jackson collaborated on District 9, but the director told /Film {{that he was no}} longer considering working on a Halo film if the opportunity arose, saying that after working on the film for five months before the project's collapse it would <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> return. The rights for the film have since reverted to Microsoft.|$|E
5|$|C.mutica closely {{resemble}} Caprella acanthogaster, also {{a native of}} East Asian waters. It may <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> distinguish the two species, particularly since Caprellamutica can exhibit considerable morphological variations among males. C.mutica can only be reliably differentiated by their setose first and second pereonites (smooth in C.acanthogaster), {{as well as the}} elongated oval shape of their gills (linear in C.acanthogaster).|$|E

5|$|Cholangiocarcinoma is {{definitively}} diagnosed from tissue, i.e. it {{is proven}} by biopsy or examination of the tissue excised at surgery. It may be suspected in a patient with obstructive jaundice. Considering it as the working diagnosis may be challenging in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC); such patients {{are at high risk}} of developing cholangiocarcinoma, but the symptoms may <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> distinguish from those of PSC. Furthermore, in patients with PSC, such diagnostic clues as a visible mass on imaging or biliary ductal dilatation may not be evident.|$|E
5|$|Data {{collected}} by land locations coding in METAR are conveyed worldwide via phone lines or wireless technology. Within many nations' meteorological organizations, this data is then plotted onto a weather map using the station model. A station {{model is a}} symbolic illustration showing the weather occurring at a given reporting station. Meteorologists created the station model to plot a number of weather elements in a small space on weather maps. Maps filled with dense station-model plots can <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> read, but they allow meteorologists, pilots, and mariners to see important weather patterns.|$|E
5|$|Food webs {{are often}} limited {{relative}} to the real world. Complete empirical measurements are generally restricted to a specific habitat, such as a cave or a pond, and principles gleaned from food web microcosm studies are extrapolated to larger systems. Feeding relations require extensive investigations into the gut contents of organisms, which can <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> decipher, or stable isotopes {{can be used to}} trace the flow of nutrient diets and energy through a food web. Despite these limitations, food webs remain a valuable tool in understanding community ecosystems.|$|E
30|$|It <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> {{reduce the}} cost of EVs, because the {{environmental}} benefits are not urgent, direct, or easy to be quantified.
