It was the development of this analytical method, using the indicator diethyl para phenylene diamine (DPD), that provided the key to {{open the door to the}} explanation of the <b>breakpoint</b> in <b>chlorination</b> and laid the foundation for the present classification of modern processes.|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of ammonia nitrogen (NH 3 -N) in the effluent strongly affected {{the formation of}} disinfection by-products (DBPs) during its chlorination. The effect of chlorine (as mg/L Cl- 2) to NH 3 -N (as mg/L N) mass ratios (Cl- 2 /N) and the chemical fractions of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the effluent on the DBPs formation was investigated. Results indicated that the formation of DBPs increased with increasing Cl- 2 /N. The concentration and speciation of DBPs varied among different DOM fractions at different zones of <b>chlorination</b> <b>breakpoint</b> curves. The formation rate of total haloacetic acids (THAA) and total trihalomethanes (TTHM) was promoted after the <b>chlorination</b> <b>breakpoint,</b> whereas the reaction of monochloramine with HOCl to dichloramine may cause {{a decrease in the}} DBPs formation potential thereafter. Organic acids were found to be the dominant precursors of DBPs with or without the {{presence of}} NH 3 -N, which indicated that the C=C, C=O and C-O structures contributed to the formation of DBPs significantly. In addition, the incorporation of bromine in THMs of the HiA fraction increased with the increasing of Cl- 2 /N mass ratios before the <b>chlorination</b> <b>breakpoint,</b> but decreased sharply after the breakpoint. Delta A(280) (absorbance at 280 nm), defined as A(280,initial) -A(280. final), was proved to be linearly related to the TTHM and THAA of wastewater without containing Br- during chlorination or chloramination.

40|$|Dissolved {{organic matter}} (DOM) in {{reclaimed}} {{water from a}} conventional sewage treatment plant was isolated using resin adsorption chromatography technique into six classes: hydrophobic bases (HoB), hydrophobic acids (HoA), hydrophobic neutrals (HoN), hydrophilic bases (HiB), hydrophilic acids (HiA) and hydrophilic neutrals (HiN). It was found that organic acids dominated in reclaimed water and the ratios Of UV(254) (absorbance at 254 nm) to dissolved organic carbon (DOC) (SUVA(254)) ratio exhibited a common relationship: HoA > reclaimed water > HiA. The influences of chemical structures and experimental conditions on the formation of disinfection by-products (DBPs) were investigated, respectively. SUVA 254 was found to exhibit a positive and statistically significant correlation with DBPs formation potential. The specific trihalomethanes (THMs) and haloacetic acids (HAAs) formation potential decreased as the same sequence: acids, neutrals and bases. The formation of DBPs depended more {{on a combination of}} aromatic moieties and aliphatic structures such as hydroxy acids. Furthermore, THMs formed more easily at alkaline conditions; however, hydrophobic organics formed HAAs more easily at acidic conditions. whereas hydrophilic organics achieved relatively high HAAs at both acidic and strong alkaline conditions. Moreover, the observed rate constant for HAAs formation was larger than the rate constant for THMs formation. Addition of ammonia nitrogen (NH(4) -N) changed chlorine to chloramines with lower oxidation potential, and correspondingly influenced the formation of DBPs especially at the <b>chlorination</b> <b>breakpoint.</b> (C) 2008 Elsevier B.

40|$|ABSTRACT: False positives for cyanide {{analysis}} in wastewaters have been reported. We {{examined the effects}} of storage time at high pH and of pH adjustments on the cyanide levels. Cyanide levels changed within the holding time allowed by Standard Methods. We also studied the difference in cyanide levels using two disinfection conditions [...] <b>breakpoint</b> <b>chlorination</b> and chloramination. Glycine was used as the precursor to study the cyanide formation pathways. Under <b>breakpoint</b> <b>chlorination</b> conditions, cyanide formation is complete relatively quickly and detectable cyanogen chloride is produced. On the other hand, chloramination yields cyanide through a relatively slow, base-catalyzed reaction. Chloramination followed by dechlorination with sodium arsenite and addition of NaOH results in cyanide levels that increase significantly upon re{{analysis in}} the first 24 hours and then remain relatively constant after that time.

40|$|Electrochemical {{systems are}} an {{attractive}} option for onsite latrine wastewater treatment {{due to their}} high efficiency and small footprint. While concerns remain over formation of toxic byproducts during treatment, rigorous studies examining byproduct formation are lacking. Experiments treating authentic latrine wastewater over variable treatment times, current densities, chloride concentrations, and anode materials were conducted to characterize byproducts and identify conditions that minimize their formation. Production of inorganic byproducts (chlorate and perchlorate) and indicator organic byproducts (haloacetic acids and trihalomethanes) during electrolysis dramatically exceeded recommendations for drinking water after one treatment cycle (∼ 10 – 30   000 times), raising concerns for contamination of downstream water supplies. Stopping the reaction after ammonium was removed (i. e., the <b>chlorination</b> <b>breakpoint)</b> was a promising method to minimize byproduct formation without compromising disinfection and nutrient removal. Though treatment was accelerated at increased chloride concentrations and current densities, byproduct concentrations remained similar near the breakpoint. On TiO_ 2 /IrO_ 2 anodes, haloacetic acids (up to ∼ 50 μM) and chlorate (up to ∼ 2 μM) were of most concern. Although boron-doped diamond anodes mineralized haloacetic acids after formation, high production rates of chlorate and perchlorate (up to ∼ 4 and 25 μM) made them inferior to TiO_ 2 /IrO_ 2 anodes in terms of toxic byproduct formation. Organic byproduct formation was similar during chemical chlorination and electrolysis of wastewater, suggesting that organic byproducts are formed by similar pathways in both cases (i. e., reactions with chloramines and free chlorine) ...|$|R
40|$|A lettuce (Lactuca sativa) {{washing process}} was {{simulated}} to assess chlorine as a disinfectant {{for maintaining the}} microbial water quality “clean” i. e. to prevent water becoming a vehicle for transmission of unacceptable levels of micro-organisms to the lettuce. Cut lettuce leaves were inoculated overnight with E. coli O 157 to obtain ca. 4. 0 log CFU/g, and subsequently washed. The washing process consisted of washing portions of 50 g of lettuce for one minute. The process was executed for 1 hour by taking lettuce portions of 50 g, and continuing to pass each subsequently through the same washing bath to obtain a final product-to-water ratio of 0. 5. kg/L. Each portion of lettuce was rinsed after washing. The pH of the washing water was reduced to 6. 5 and free chlorine was continuously added to maintain 1 mg/L of free chlorine in the water. The experiment was performed in i) tap water and ii) in artificial process water, including lettuce extract, the latter with COD values of 500 (C 500) or 1000 mg O 2 /L (C 1000). In the absence of chlorine, the E. coli O 157 levels rapidly increased in the wash water and eventually reached 5. 3 ± 0. 4 log/ 100 mL. When maintaining 1 mg/L of free chlorine, the contamination could be controlled to 2. 2 ± 0. 05, 1. 2 ± 0. 6 and 1. 3 ± 0. 4 log CFU/ 100 mL in tap water, C 500, and C 1000 respectively. <b>Chlorination</b> <b>breakpoint</b> and cumulative chlorine dose positively correlated with the COD load {{of the water and}} this higher chlorine consumption resulted in increased total trihalomethanes concentrations in the water: <LOD, 27. 8 ± 5. 4 and 124. 5 ± 13. 4 µg/L, the latter exceeding the amount allowed in drinking water in the EU. However, on the lettuce no detectable amounts were observed in all cases. This experiment shows that low amounts of chlorine are effective for maintaining a “clean” water quality. Nevertheless, the correlation of trihalomethanes with COD load illustrates the importance of the physicochemical quality and suggests the possible use of pre-treatments to lower the COD load...|$|R

40|$|Chlorination is {{most widely}} used {{disinfection}} method in water and wastewater treatment. This process has demonstrated its effectiveness in protecting the public health. However, chlorine reacts with natural organic matter (NOM) to form disinfection by-products (DBPs). Trihalomethanes (THMs) and haloacetic acids (HAAs) are the most prevalent compounds. Many studies have conducted to investigate the factors such as chlorine dosages, characteristics of NOM, bromide ion concentration {{in the formation of}} these DBPs, but there are few investigations on the influence of organic nitrogen compounds. Besides, DBP formation in chlorination of wastewater is unclear but of concern in recent years. In this study, <b>breakpoint</b> <b>chlorination</b> of wastewater effluents from different sources was conducted to study the formation of DBPs including THMs and HAAs in wastewater chlorination. Synthetic solutions containing ammonia, humic acid, organic-N compounds, and bromide were chlorinated under different experimental conditions to study the effect of organic-N compounds on the formation of DBPs. Glycine was chosen as the primary model organic-N compound and effects of other model organic-N compounds were also evaluated for comparison. Samples were periodically withdrawn and subjected to analyses for evaluating chlorine residuals and the formation of THMs, HAAs and cyanogen halides (CNXs). Results of the study showed large variations in the patterns of THMs and HAAs from <b>breakpoint</b> <b>chlorination</b> of different wastewater effluents. However, the formation of THMs and HAAs increased sharply at chlorine dosages above the breakpoint. In chlorination of synthetic solutions, the formation of THMs and HAAs were found to decrease with increasing glycine and ammonia concentrations, but increase with increasing bromide ion concentration. CNXs formation was found to be highly sensitive to free-chlorine-to-glycine ratio and its formation trend was significantly affected by the presence/absence of ammonia. The incorporation of bromine changed the by-product speciation towards the brominated species and enhanced the yields of total THMs, HAAs and CNXs. Different model organic-N compounds exerted different effects on the formation of THMs, HAAs, and CNXs.

Bromine incorporations into THMs and HAAs increased with an increasing bromide to DOC molar ratio. In addition, the bromine incorporation was also found to be highly dependent on the chlorine dosage and the bromide to ammonia ratio. A longer reaction time increased the yields of THMs and HAAs and was found to favor the formation of dihalogenated HAAs.

To better understand how water treatment parameters affect NDMA formation from the polymers, the effects of in situ chloramination, <b>breakpoint</b> <b>chlorination,</b> and pre-oxidation on the NDMA formation from the polymers were investigated. NDMA formation potential (NDMA-FP) as well as dimethylamine (DMA) residual concentration were measured from poly(epichlorohydrin dimethylamine) (polyamine) and poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (poly-DADMAC) solutions upon reactions with oxidants including free chlorine, chlorine dioxide, ozone, and monochloramine under different treatment conditions. The results supported that dichloramine (NHCl 2) formation was the critical factor affecting NDMA formation from the polymers during in situ chloramination. The highest NDMA formation from the polymers occurred near the breakpoint of chlorination. Polymer chain breakdown and transformation of the released DMA and other intermediates were important factors affecting NDMA formation from the polymers in pre-oxidation followed by post-chloramination. Pre-oxidation generally reduced NDMA-FP of the polymers; however, the treatments involving pre-ozonation increased polyDADMAC's NDMA-FP and DMA release. The strategies for reducing NDMA formation from the polymers may include the avoidance of the conditions favorable to NHCl 2 formation and the avoidance of polymer exposure to strong oxidants such as ozone.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{established}} that chlorination of naturally coloured waters produces chloroform and other trihalomethanes in concentrations that are considerably higher {{than most of the}} organic microcontaminants commonly found in polluted surface waters. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the origin of the trihalomethanes in drinking water and the mechanism responsible for their formation. Chapter 1 gives a historical survey of the use of chlorine in drinking water treatment. The main application of chlorine originally was disinfection. Soon after, chlorination became common practice for the oxidative removal of earthy tastes and odors. Additionally the bleaching of naturally coloured water was found to be advantageous. As a result of studies of the various reactions between chlorine and inorganic ammonium the breakpoint phenomenon was discovered in 1940. Since then <b>breakpoint</b> <b>chlorination</b> is used for quantitative removal of ammonium from raw water. Until that time alternate methods of removal included biological means such as slow sand filtration. <b>Breakpoint</b> <b>chlorination</b> led to the development of water purification methods that could be accomplished by entirely physico-chemical treatment. However, as the levels of pollution of river Rhine water increased, the experience in Rotterdam was that <b>breakpoint</b> <b>chlorination</b> became less and less effective. Additionally the taste was adversely affected. In 1965 gaschromatography was applied in an attempt to determine the reaction products responsible for the taste problem. Chapter 2 describes the development in our laboratory of a modified headspace vapour analysis method for water. This allowed for the capture of minute amounts of volatile organics before and after chlorination of the river water. The technique basically is a static method in which a gas volume (headspace) is brought into equilibrium with the water sample. The headspace gas is collected on a cold trapping column which contains the same adsorbent as used for the stationary phase in the subsequent gaschromatographic separation. Using this technique for drinking water four large peaks were found which were not present in the untreated water. The four compounds were identified with chloroform, dichloro-bromomethane, chloro-dibromomethane and bromoform. Chapter 3 gives the analytical data obtained from Rotterdam drinking water, first prepared from river Rhine and later from river Meuse. Surprisingly the same four haloforms were found after chlorination of both waters. It was analytically established that the chlorine gas didnot contain trihalomethanes. Neither did it contain bromine in detectable amounts, i. e. less than 100 mg/kg. In an investigation of natural waters chloroform formation was found to occur after chlorination of samples from several unpolluted ponds and. lakes. Those that contained bromide-ions in concentrations higher thans 0. 1 mg/l also gave the brominated trihalomethanes. It was suspected that both the organic precursor for chloroform and the inorganic precursor for the brominated compounds were present in all types of natural waters. Chlorination resulted in the oxidation of Br -to HBrO, which in turn is known to react as a halogenating agent. Chapter 4 : Since the major soluble organic compounds in natural waters are humic substances - mainly fulvic acids - it was logical to assume that they are the organic precursor. Humic acids contain both carboxylic and phenolic functionalities. Polyphenols are known to make up for the bulk of the degradation products of humic acids. Furthermore several polyhydroxybenzenes are known to give the iodoform reaction. The combination of the latter two facts led to the theory that polyphenolic structures in the humic acid matrix are the reactive sites from which chloroform is formed. To prove this, the principle experiment consisted of chlorination of peat extracts and aqueous solutions of commercial humic acids. Both solutions gave chloroform when treated with chlorine. Addition of inorganic bromide before chlorination resulted in the formation of all four haloforms. Chapter 5 involves an investigation of the specific type of polyhydroxybenzene responsible for chloroform-formation. Compounds in which two hydroxy-groups are in the meta-position gave the highest yields of chloroform. We also found that in the methylethers of resorcinol and phloroglucinol the formation of chloroform is suppressed. This led to the theory that the phenoxide-ion is essential for the formation of the halogenated mono-carbon degradation product. It is a reasonable assumption that in the competetive oxidation and substitution reactions the aromatic nucleus is destroyed to give an alpha-chlorinated ketone. A reaction mechanism is proposed in which the carbon atom in between two meta-positioned OH-groups is chlorinated twice. This is followed by scission into a linear alpha-ketone. This intermediate is further chlorinated to RCCl 3 according to the pathways known to occur in the haloform reaction. In chapter 6 cursory pilot plant studies focused on removal of chloroform by adsorption on activated carbon are described. It was found that the adsorptive capacity of carbon for chloroform was too low to be of interest. Further investigation aimed at the removal of the fulvic acids which are the precursor for the trihalomethanes. Pre-ozonation was tried but had little effect. Some experimental results with macroporous ion exchance resins appear effective in removing a major portion of the precursor for the haloformformation...|$|E
40|$|In most “real-world” {{applications}} of chlorine to aqueous systems, {{the interactions between}} chlorine and organic N-compounds are of concern {{in terms of both}} disinfection efficacy and analytical interference. The organic chloramines that are formed in these reactions are much less effective than inorganic chloramines in terms of antimicrobial potential. Conventional analytical techniques for “active” chlorine measurements have demonstrated potential interference by organic chloramines. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a more accurate technique for chlorination process control so as to provide adequate disinfection while limiting the toxicity associated with residual chlorine and DBPs. ^ A membrane introduction mass spectrometric (MIMS) method for differentiation and quantification of free chlorine and inorganic chloramines in aqueous solution was developed based on a low cost mass spectrometer. Several factors were examined for system optimization. Linearity of the response and limits of detection of all inorganic chlorine and chloramines were evaluated. System performance was evaluated with comparison of DPD/FAS titration from chlorination of ammoniacal water, aqueous solutions containing glycine and samples of potable water and wastewater. ^ The MIMS system was applied for purposes of studying the chlorination of aqueous solutions containing model organic N-compounds and pure bacterial cultural solutions. DPD/FAS pure bacterial cultural solutions. DPD/FAS titration was performed in parallel for comparison. DPD/FAS titration yielded false-positive measurements of chloroorganic N-compounds as “apparent” chloramines, while little or no inorganic chloramines were detected by MIMS. in the cases of model organic N-compound chlorination, the <b>breakpoint</b> <b>chlorination</b> curve shape and by-product formation were evaluated and found to be strongly dependent on Cl:N molar ratio, as well as the structure of the compounds. In the cases of bacterial solution chlorination, the results indicated that residual chloramines existed in the form of organic chloramines and the bacterial cells were the source of organic-N.

Chlorine {{has been}} used for many years to treat {{municipal}} and industrial water and wastewater. The basic reasons for using chlorine in the treatment of wastewater is the destruction of inherent pathogenic organisms, bacteria and viruses {{to prevent the spread of}} disease by water borne agents. However, there is increasing concern and regulation over the levels of residual chlorine in wastewaters that are discharged to the receiving streams. Current regulatory agencies are examining the effect of residual chlorine and chlorinated compounds in water on human and aquatic life. It is not always possible to maintain a low chlorine residual by dose alone. <b>Breakpoint</b> <b>chlorination</b> and wastes with high chlorine demand (for adequate disinfection) may result in a high chlorine discharge. Therefore, it may be necessary to use dechlorination agents to reduce or eliminate residual chlorine levels in wastewaters. Gwinnett County has been concerned about the effects of the potentially toxic nature of chlorine in the treatment plant effluent and its effects on the aquatic life found in the receiving streams. The work that Gwinnett County has done in the past year in constructing a delivery system for sodium thiosulfate shows one means of addressing the dechlorination of wastewater without considerable capital outlay. Other municipalities have study the system that we have installed and are making plans to have a similar system designed because they are to receive new chlorine limits on their N. P. D. E. S.

40|$|Over 2 × 10 ^ 11 {{kilograms}} of ammonia are produced globally per {{year by the}} Haber-Bosch process which combines molecular hydrogen and nitrogen to synthesize ammonia. Most is used for fertilizer and agriculture while the remaining is used for other purposes including industrial processes and explosives. Explosives used in the mining industry are commonly ammonium nitrate (43) -based. Excess ammonia and nitrate which can be dissolve into mine runoff water during blasting. Ammonia in mine and mineral wastewater can range from 20 - 110 mg/L. Ammonia is also present in several types of industrial wastewater such as caustic soda solutions used in the oil re-refining industry for removal of sulfur compounds from hydrocarbon streams. These waste streams are known as sulfidic caustic solution (SCS) or spent caustic. This thesis concerns the treatment of ammonia in two distinct types of industrial wastewaters {{in order to meet}} specific discharge criteria. The first industrial wastewater is a low ammonia concentration WWTP effluent (2 – 6 mg/L TAN as N) from a gold mine in Alaska. The other is an extremely high (6000 + mg/L TAN as N) concentration sulfidic caustic solution from oil re-refining. It was hypothesized that that for the low concentration of ammonia mine water, which had low turbidity and relatively simple water chemistry, advanced separation technologies such as ion-exchange, zeolite and membrane filtration, and electrocoagulation would work well compared to alternative treatment options. For the highly complex matrix oil refining caustic solution, it was expected that a straightforward commonly used ammonia removal technology, such as <b>breakpoint</b> <b>chlorination</b> would work very well. Laboratory column and batch testing using ion-exchange adsorption and chloramination were performed using actual waters contaminated with ammonia. For the low level mine water, several ion-exchange resins and zeolites were tested and compared based on the amount of water that could be treated per unit volume of resin. For the high concentration ammonia water linear regression relationships were determined which model the removal of ammonia {{as a function of the}} applied chlorine dose. For the mine water with low levels ammonia it was found that the number of bed volumes in which ammonia was removed with BRZ increased with increasing EBCT and decreasing potassium concentration. It was also found that temperature of a 5 °C did not significantly impact the removal. For removal of ammonia from SCS solution, applied chlorine doses needed to remove ammonia were measured between 2. 54 and 2. 01 [Cl₂]/[N]. In conclusion the results obtained from this investigation and implications described can be used to assist in the design of systems to remove of ammonia from wastewaters of similar characteristics...|$|E
