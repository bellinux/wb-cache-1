Aim: {{the aim of this}} study was to compare the effects of aerobic training (AT) and aerobic plus resistance training (AT + RT) on anorexigenic and orexigenic factors in obese adolescents undergoing interdisciplinary weight loss therapy. Methods: A total of 26 obese adolescents, aged 15 - 19 years with BMI >= P 95 were submitted to 12 months of interdisciplinary intervention (clinical support, nutrition, psychology and physical exercise) and divided into two groups, aerobic training (AT) (n = 13) or aerobic plus resistance training (AT + RT) (n = 13), which were matched according to gender and <b>body</b> <b>mass.</b> Blood samples were collected to analyze orexigenic factors (AgRP, NPY, MCH) and the anorexigenic factor alpha-MSH. Results: the AT and AT + RT groups significantly reduced <b>body</b> <b>mass,</b> <b>body</b> <b>mass</b> index and <b>body</b> fat <b>mass</b> (<b>kg)</b> during the therapy. the AT group showed no significant changes in <b>body</b> lean <b>mass</b> (<b>kg),</b> whereas the AT + RT group showed an increase in <b>body</b> lean <b>mass</b> (<b>kg)</b> during the interdisciplinary intervention. There was an increase in AgRP levels (ng/ml) only in the AT + RT group after 6 months of interdisciplinary intervention compared with baseline condition. Conversely, alpha-MSH levels (ng/ml) increased only in the AT group after 12 months of interdisciplinary intervention compared with baseline condition. Conclusion: Aerobic training (AT) as part of an interdisciplinary therapy is more effective than aerobic plus resistance training (AT + RT) to improve secretion of anorexigenic/orexigenic factors in obese adolescents.
