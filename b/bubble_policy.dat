40|$|First, we {{show that}} welfare {{reducing}} asset bubbles, which we call toxic bubbles, can emerge in a standard framework of rational bubble. In our model, limited liability and defaultable debt contracts induce banks to shift the bubble’s risk of collapse to their creditors. Risk shifting enables risky toxic bubbles to emerge in equilibrium, even if all agents are rational and forward looking. We then analyze welfare effects of an intervention policy that pricks an existing bubble, and of a preventative macroprudential banking regulation. Second, we generalize the model to two large open economies. The global model shows that an emerging economy can “outsource ” a toxic bubble to a developed economy through global financial intermediation. Hence, a toxic bubble can emerge in the developed economy, {{where there is no}} dynamic inefficiency. The model formalizes the idea that a “savings glut” coming from emerging economies to the United States fueled the boom of a subprime mort-gage bubble. The model provides a tractable framework for <b>bubble</b> <b>policy</b> analysis in open economies...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} bubble-bursting policy in the case where the central bank sometimes tries to deflate an asset which is not, in fact, overpriced. We {{consider the case of}} a “semi-bubble,” where some traders know that an asset is overpriced, but others do not. Unlike most previous papers on <b>bubble</b> <b>policy,</b> our framework assumes rational traders. We also assume a finite time horizon, to rule out infinite horizon type bubbles. The market’s “fulfilled expectations” equilibria are derived, and standard tools of welfare economics are applied to evaluate the effect of anti-bubble policy. Under the assumption that the announcements of the financial authority can help less informed traders to learn more about a risky asset, market equilibria are presented and compared. We show that, if sellers care relatively more about the states where the central bank makes a negative bubble-bursting announcement, an announcement policy interferes with the asset’s ability to share risks. Conversely, if sellers care relatively less about the announcement states, an announcement policy improves risk sharing. “Information leakage” {{plays an important role in}} our analysis. Because of this leakage, central bank announcements can initiate further information revelation between traders. That is, the leakage effect can reveal information that the central bank, itself, does not have. However, this information leakage may not be welfare improving. Also, this leakage effect makes it difficult to predict the effects of bubble-bursting policy. This may complicate both private investment strategies and public policy analysis. ...|$|E

It is shown that such a policy tends to improve welfare if it protects less-informed buyers from 'bad' sellers, who know the asset is overpriced. However, if policy deflates prices only in 'strong bubbles,', where all private agents know the asset is overpriced, this tends to reduce welfare. This is because, in those states where the central bank turns out not to deflate prices, bad sellers become more confident of selling the asset.

40|$|The paper {{attempts}} to assess {{to what extent}} the central bank or the government should respond to developments that can cause financial instability, such as housing or asset <b>bubbles,</b> overextended budgetary <b>policies,</b> or excessive public and household debt. To analyse this question we set up a simple reduced-form model in which monetary and fiscal policy interact, and imbalances (bubbles) can occur in the medium-run. Considering several scenarios with both benevolent and idiosyncratic policy-makers, the analysis shows that the answer depends on a number of characteristics of the economy, {{as well as on the}} monetary and fiscal policy preferences with respect to inflation and output stabilization. We show that socially optimal financial instability prevention should be carried out by: (i) both monetary and fiscal policy (sharing region) under some circumstances, and (ii) fiscal policy only (specialization region) under others. There is however a moral hazard problem: both policy-makers have an incentive to be insufficiently pro-active in safeguarding financial stability, and shift the responsibility to the other policy. Specifically, under a range of circumstances we obtain a situation in which neither policy mitigates instability threats (indifference region). These results can be related to the build-up of the current global financial crisis, and have strong implications for the optimal design of the delegation process. financial instability, <b>bubbles,</b> fiscal-monetary <b>policy</b> interaction, asset prices, public debt, deficit EDIRC Provider-Institution: RePEc:edi:smlatau...|$|R

40|$|The {{financial}} sector is heavily regulated {{in order to}} prevent financial crises. The recent crisis showed how ineffective this regulation and other types of government intervention were in achieving this aim. We argue that the crisis was primarily caused by housing price bubbles. These occurred because of too loose monetary policies and the easy availability of credit resulting from the build up of large foreign exchange reserves by Asian central banks. A number of regulatory reforms are suggested. It is also argued that central banks need to have more checks and balances. Finally, the international financial architecture needs to be changed so that Asian countries do not feel the need to accumulate large foreign exchange reserves. <b>Bubbles,</b> Monetary <b>Policy,</b> Global Imbalances...|$|R
40|$|This paper articulates three {{insights}} regarding {{asset prices}} and monetary policy: (1) Asset price appreciation due to monetary expansion, despite its “paper” wealth nature, {{tends to make}} current consumers as a whole wealthier; (2) the wealth effect of monetary policy (on consumption) is negatively correlated with Tobin’s q effect (on investment), which positively depends on investment elasticity; and (3) the soundness of asset market performances {{does not depend on}} whether they are fundamental or not, but on their compatibility with the AD-AS balance in the long run. These basic insights and their implications reveal some limitations of monetary policy as a stabilization policy, clarify some misperceptions on fundamental asset prices, and provide a rationale for monetary policy to react directly to asset market performances.

The record over the past decade, in fact, has raised the prospect of asset price booms and busts as a permanent feature of the monetary policy landscape.

The typical linear policy reaction function has a substantial change after 1991, but lacks the robustness in that the estimation result is sensitive to a minor change of the sample period. To alleviate the problem, we allow for temporary and permanent variations of the reaction coefficients by introducing nonlinearity and a structural break. The time variation of the inflation coefficient shows that the Fed is more aggressive in periods of inflationary pressure. However, unlike the linear model case, we find little evidence of {{a significant change in}} the Fed's active response to inflationary pressure after the structural break at 1991 :I.

40|$|The paper models {{the links}} between {{financial}} fragility, asset markets and monetary policy. It is shown that central banks concern {{about the cost of}} financial disruption generates an asymmetric response, thus contributing to the creation of an asset price bubble. In an economy with a highly leveraged financial structure, the central bank has an incentive to prevent a run on financial intermediation by injecting liquidity when asset values fall significantly. The inflationary side effect of this policy reduces the real value of nominal debt and so gives rise to a put option for investors, driving up asset prices above their fundamental value. The paper shows that the size of such a bubble is likely to be rather small. The bubble is only equal to the expected value of capital gains on outstanding debt, which are fairly limited in a crisis. Since, in contrast, the gains from preventing the disruption of financial intermediation can be quite large, it is rational for a central bank to inject liquidity in a crisis.
