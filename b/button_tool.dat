40|$|Internet of Things {{communication}} is mainly {{based on a}} machine-to-machine pattern, where devices are globally addressed and identified. However, {{as the number of}} connected devices increase, the burdens on the network infrastructure increase as well. The major challenges are the size of the routing tables and the efficiency of the current routing protocols in the Internet backbone. To address these problems, an Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) working group, along with the research group at Cisco, are still working on the Locator/ID Separation Protocol as a routing architecture that can provide new semantics for the IP addressing, to simplify routing operations and improve scalability in the future of the Internet such as the Internet of Things. Nonetheless, The Locator/ID Separation Protocol is still at an early stage of implementation and the security Protocol e. g. Internet Protocol Security (IPSec), in particular, is still in its infancy. Based on this, three scenarios were considered: Firstly, in the initial stage, each Locator/ID Separation Protocol-capable router needs to register with a Map-Server. This is known as the Registration Stage. Nevertheless, this stage is vulnerable to masquerading and content poisoning attacks. Secondly, the addresses resolving stage, in the Locator/ID Separation Protocol the Map Server (MS) accepts Map-Request from Ingress Tunnel Routers and Egress Tunnel Routers. These routers in trun look up the database and return the requested mapping to the endpoint user. However, this stage lacks data confidentiality and mutual authentication. Furthermore, the Locator/ID Separation Protocol limits the efficiency of the security protocol which works against redirecting the data or acting as fake routers. Thirdly, As a result of the vast increase in the different Internet of Things devices, the interconnected links between these devices increase vastly as well. Thus, the communication between the devices can be easily exposed to disclosures by attackers such as Man in the Middle Attacks (MitM) and Denial of Service Attack (DoS). This research provided a comprehensive study for Communication and Mobility in the Internet of Things as well as the taxonomy of different security protocols. It went on to investigate the security threats and vulnerabilities of Locator/ID Separation Protocol using X. 805 framework standard. Then three Security protocols were provided to secure the exchanged transitions of communication in Locator/ID Separation Protocol. The first security protocol had been implemented to secure the Registration stage of Locator/ID separation using ID/Based cryptography method. The second security protocol was implemented to address the Resolving stage in the Locator/ID Separation Protocol between the Ingress Tunnel Router and Egress Tunnel Router using Challenge-Response authentication and Key Agreement technique. Where, the third security protocol had been proposed, analysed and evaluated for the Internet of Things communication devices. This protocol was based on the authentication and the group key agreement via using the El-Gamal concept. The developed protocols set an interface between each level of the phase to achieve security refinement architecture to Internet of Things based on Locator/ID Separation Protocol. These protocols were verified using Automated Validation Internet Security Protocol and Applications (AVISPA) which is a push <b>button</b> <b>tool</b> for the automated validation of security protocols and achieved results demonstrating {{that they do not have}} any security flaws. Finally, a performance analysis of security refinement protocol analysis and an evaluation were conducted using Contiki and Cooja simulation tool.

40|$|Geographic Information Systems (GIS) {{modelling}} enables {{rational management}} of spatially distributed resources. However, use of GIS for dynamic environmental resource management is an emerging area of research. Resource managers often face problems when managing environmental conservation or restoration works {{due to the}} lack of user friendly, spatially distributed modelling tools. The present work developed a GIS database and management tools incorporating user friendliness, effective computation and manipulation of data to demonstrate the potential of GIS for spatially distributed environmental resource management. Kalutara District of Sri Lanka was selected with Grama Niladhari Division as the smallest spatial entity and taking birds as the environmental resource. In this work GIS model was developed to identify locations indicating the spatial variation of bird availability. The developed model was based on the Analytical Hierarchy Process as described by (Sooriyabandara & Wijesekera, 2010). Tool development consisted of a ArcGIS model builder assembly to obtain modelled bird availability results. A <b>button</b> <b>tool</b> within the ArcGIS environment was incorporated to capture and manage bird availability results for decision making and visualization. Model and tools developed by the study incorporated the modelling results of Bird “Black Rumped Flameback” for model development and testing. GIS tool and GIS model development presented a new approach compared to other software development processes. Four main user surveys were carried out to develop the best fit GIS tool and those were carried out one after the other. User comments and suggestions at each survey were incorporated in the model development. Questionnaires were used effectively for the identification of best tool. GIS model and Tool development in the present work is a unique contribution to the use of GIS based resource management models for environmental resource management. This work developed and tested the model which incorporated the dynamic capability and the elimination of cross migration from the active ArcGIS environment. The tool ensured user friendliness through the incorporation of tooltips, attractive buttons, verification messages and error messages. Consistency of the GUI were achieved by careful and unique design of buttons and sizes, button labels, graphics for prominence, interface titles, and interface arrangements. Tool coding requirements were changed to dynamically link multiple interfaces, objects and geographic locations. In this work, handling of multiple interfaces was added to the GIS tool as a “. dll” file which required incorporating of new codes. This semi-automated model is recursive, adaptive and it allows changing the weights of the parameters and also it is possible to carryout forecasting. Developed GIS tool is capable of carrying out Database to Map, Map to Database and Database to Database operations. This tool is capable of displaying the available resources in a selected area either according to resource type, or characteristics. The present study demonstrates the capability of the GIS model to support decision making under resource utilization, change of use, or in case of resource conservation. The present work carried out three case study scenarios to evaluate (i) climate change, (ii) Deforestation and the case of (iii) Water body enhancement with forestation. Present work concluded the successful development of a GIS based System to demonstrate the potential of Geographic Information Systems for efficient management of spatially distributed environmental resources.

40|$|Abstract. While {{a diverse}} array of {{approaches}} to applying machine learning to testing has appeared in recent years, many efforts share three central challenges, {{two of which are}} not always obvious. First, learningbased testing relies on adapting the tests generated to the program being tested, {{based on the results of}} observed executions. This is the heart of a machine learning approach to test generation. A less obvious challenge in many approaches is that the learning techniques used may have been devised for problems that do not share all the assumptions and goals of software testing. Finally, the usability of approaches by programmers is a challenge that has often been neglected. Programmers may wish to maintain more control of test generation than a ”push <b>button</b> ” <b>tool</b> generally provides, without becoming experts in software testing theory or machine learning algorithms, and with access to the full power of the language in which the tested system is written. In this paper we consider these issues, in light of our experience with adaptation-based programming as a method for automated test generation. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{process of}} {{designing}} and analyzing a multiple-reflector system {{has traditionally been}} time-intensive, requiring large amounts of both computational and human time. At many frequencies, a discrete approximation of the radiation integral {{may be used to}} model the system. The code which implements this physical optics (PO) algorithm was developed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. It analyzes systems of antennas in pairs, and for each pair, the analysis can be computationally time-consuming. Additionally, the antennas must be described using a local coordinate system for each antenna, which makes it difficult to integrate the design into a multi-disciplinary framework in which there is traditionally one global coordinate system, even before considering deforming the antenna as prescribed by external structural and/or thermal factors. Finally, setting up the code to correctly analyze all the antenna pairs in the system can take a fair amount of time, and introduces possible human error. The use of parallel computing to reduce the computational time required for the analysis of a given pair of antennas has been previously discussed.
