Those that pose Aborigines as Ecological <b>Beings</b> <b>manipulate</b> superseded understandings of ecosystems. Noting the extent of environmental change to Australia post- 1788, the article concludes that posing Aborigines as environmentalists ignores the structural causes of environmental change, as well as ignoring the interrelationships between epistemologies and the practices they sanction...|$|R

Thus, this political climate ensured that national identity would be defined singularly across ethnic lines—a dangerous prelude to the ensuing genocide. The tense situation became inflamed with Habyarimana’s mysterious death in 1994.
