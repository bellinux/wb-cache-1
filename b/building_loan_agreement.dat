5000|$|A <b>loan</b> <b>agreement</b> is a {{contract}} between a borrower and a lender which regulates the mutual promises made by each party. There are {{many types of}} <b>loan</b> <b>agreements,</b> including [...] "facilities agreements," [...] "revolvers," [...] "term loans," [...] "working capital loans." [...] <b>Loan</b> <b>agreements</b> are documented via a compilation of the various mutual promises made by the involved parties.|$|R
50|$|A <b>loan</b> <b>agreement</b> is {{made between}} the project company (borrower) and the lenders. <b>Loan</b> <b>agreement</b> governs {{relationship}} between the lenders and the borrowers. It determines the basis on which the loan can be drawn and repaid, and contains the usual provisions found in a corporate <b>loan</b> <b>agreement.</b> It also contains the additional clauses to cover specific requirements {{of the project and}} project documents.|$|R
50|$|<b>Loan</b> <b>agreements</b> {{are usually}} in written form, {{but there is}} no legal reason why a <b>loan</b> <b>agreement</b> cannot be a purely oral {{contract}} (although oral agreements are more difficult to enforce).|$|R
40|$|<b>Loan</b> <b>agreements</b> {{rely upon}} the {{existence}} of allowable indemnity for their justification and validity in the joint tortfeasor situation. If indemnity is allowed in a given situation, objections {{to the use of}} a <b>loan</b> <b>agreement</b> must be rejected. If, however, a suit for indemnity is not allowed between two joint tortfeasors, <b>loan</b> <b>agreements</b> should not allow such a result indirectly. Therefore, it may be concluded that the use of <b>loan</b> <b>agreements</b> in Nebraska in the joint tortfeasor situation will only be upheld when a suit for indemnification would also be upheld. Whether <b>loan</b> <b>agreements</b> are held to be valid or invalid in any given situation should not, however, preclude an injured plaintiff from receiving full compensation for his damages. In applying pro tanto reduction, the court in Tober v. Hampton justifiably held that any amount received under the invalid <b>loan</b> <b>agreement</b> should be deducted from any judgment rendered in a suit against the other joint tortfeasor. The court ruled inconsistently, though, in requiring the plaintiffs to pay back any money received in such a suit to the loaning joint tortfeasor. Since the <b>loan</b> <b>agreement</b> was held invalid, no repayment under it should have been required. As a result of this inconsistent combination of pro tanto reduction and mandatory repayment under an invalid <b>loan</b> <b>agreement,</b> the court 2 ̆ 7 s decision that the plaintiffs were not the real parties in interest seems erroneous...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} my thesis is to {{generally}} describe the legal {{aspects of the}} <b>loan</b> <b>agreement</b> which includes the describtion of credit and customer credit too. The thesis is composed of eight chapters {{and each of them}} dealing with different aspects of the credit or the <b>Loan</b> <b>agreement.</b> Chapters describes the term "credit" and the difference between his legal and economic sense for society.

40|$|Resumé The {{purpose of}} my thesis is {{to analyze the}} {{effective}} regulation of the <b>loan</b> <b>agreement.</b> First chapters deal with {{a distinction between the}} meaning of credit in an economic and in a legal sense, <b>loan</b> <b>agreement's</b> historical evolution and basic principles of credit granting. Then I outline the changes to the regulation of the <b>loan</b> <b>agreement</b> in the past 19 years and briefly deal with the proposal of the new complex civil code, which is being drafted at the moment. The main part of this thesis lies within the Chapter 9. There, I deal with the main issues concerning the <b>loan</b> <b>agreement.</b> Subchapter 9. 1 discusses the parties to the <b>loan</b> <b>agreement.</b> It is generally accepted that there are no limitations as to who may be a creditor or who may be a debtor. Subchapters 9. 2 and 9. 3 deal with the obligation of the creditor to provide the financial resources stated in the agreement, with the possibility to terminate such obligation and with the payment for the conclusion of the <b>loan</b> <b>agreement.</b> The payment is deemed to a fee for the reservation of funds. Description of ways of disbursement of the loan is included in subchapter 9. 4. One of the basic obligations of the debtor, the obligation to repay the loan together with the accrued interest is discussed in chapters 9. 5 and 9. 6. I also deal with a possibility of having [...] ...|$|R

50|$|A {{promissory}} note {{is very similar}} to a loan. Each is a legally binding contract to unconditionally repay a specified amount within a defined time frame. However, a {{promissory note}} is generally less detailed and rigid than a loan contract. For one thing, <b>loan</b> <b>agreements</b> often require repayment in installments, while promissory notes typically do not. Furthermore, a <b>loan</b> <b>agreement</b> usually includes the terms for recourse in the case of default, such as establishing the right to foreclose, while a promissory note does not. Also, while a <b>loan</b> <b>agreement</b> requires signatures from both the borrower and the lender, a promissory note only requires the signature of the borrower.|$|R
