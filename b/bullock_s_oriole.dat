There are also questions about how effectively artificial life software can evolve increasing levels of complexity. We extend our previous work demonstrating an evolutionary increase in an information theoretic measure of neural complexity in an artificial life system (Polyworld), and introduce a new technique for distinguishing driven from passive trends in complexity. Our experiments show that evolution can and does select for complexity increases in a driven fashion, in some circumstances, but under other conditions it can also select for complexity stability.

A wide range of UAV applications has been identified in the last decade, both for civil and military use. An autonomous AAR capability is perceived as an advantage to future support and deployment of mid-large scale UAV to meet operational requirements. Despite drawing a lot of attention and research, bow wave effects in an AAR scenario has not received enough attention. Some existing works have discussed and attempted to model the effect of the bow wave from a comparatively large receiver (B- 2, C- 17) onto the tanker (KC- 135) during boom refuelling. However the effects of bow wave from the receiver aircraft onto the drogue in a probe and drogue refuelling system has received very little attention. This paper analyses the effects of the bow wave and results suggest that a solution to the bow wave effect is not only desirable but essential for a successful AAAR refuelling. This paper considers the use of an offset which is used by human pilots to compensate for the drogue movement resulting from the receiver's bow wave. This simple yet effective solution was found to restore the loss in performance in the AAAR simulation which results from the bow wave interaction.

Ecologists, already excited by the apparent ability of Greater Prairie-Chickens to lek in improbable habitats, such as corn fields and dirt edges of Rainwater Basin playas, will welcome the use by Lark Buntings and Vesper Sparrows of wheat stubble fields with a growing corn crop. The Vesper Sparrows of the east, a different subspecies {{from those in the}} north and west, have been at the mercy of full-tillage cropping systems, but now have a reprieve and may even be increasing because of no-till and minimum tillage methods currently in vogue due to high fuel prices and conservation benefits. White-faced Ibis again nested in several places, and Red-shouldered Hawk is showing signs of expanding from its limited range at Fontenelle Forest. Very exciting was the confirmation of breeding {{for the first time in}} Nebraska of Ash-throated Flycatcher, only the second record of the species 2 ̆ 7 occurrence in the state. Hopefully confirmation is soon to follow for Broad-tailed Hummingbird, which has now twice been reported during the breeding season. A phenomenon that may be applicable to those early migrant passerines that appear well before local breeders seem to have finished breeding and have even contemplated migration, is molt-migration. A recent article in Birding ([URL] discusses this strategy for such species as Dusky Flycatcher, Warbling Vireo, Western Tanager, Lazuli Bunting, and Bullock 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Oriole,</b> which is probably best known for its early departure from breeding areas for an intermediate staging area where it molts, and then continues to its wintering grounds. The possibility was raised by Ted Floyd that Chipping Sparrow might be in this group as well. Unfortunately, other than the existence of many such rather early fall records for various species in areas where breeding does not occur, Nebraska has little data to support or contradict this idea. Observers should continue to report obvious indications of early fall movement (flocking, appearance out of breeding habitat, disappearance of adults) ...|$|R

40|$|D. M. Jacobs and C. F. Michaels (2006) {{concluded}} that aspects of hand movements in lateral catching were {{predicted by the}} ratio of lateral optical velocity to expansion velocity. Their conclusions were based partly on {{a modified version of}} the required velocity model of catching (C. E. Peper, R. J. Bootsma, D. R. Mestre, & F. C. Bakker, 1994). The present article considers this optical ratio in detail and asks whether it, together with a control law, predicts the (often curious) hand trajectories observed in lateral interception. The optical ratio was used to create a succession of target-position inputs for the vector integration to endpoint model of hand movements (D. <b>Bullock</b> & <b>S.</b> Grossberg, 1988). The model used this succession, initial hand position, and model parameters (fit to 60 trials) to predict hand trajectories on each trial. Predicted trajectories were then compared with observed hand trajectories. Hand movements were predicted accurately, especially in the binocular condition, and were superior to predictions based on lateral ball position, the input variable of the required velocity model. The authors concluded, as did C. E. Peper et al. (1994), that perceivers continuously couple movements to optics. Copyright 2006 by the American Psychological Association...|$|R
40|$|Analytical and {{geometrical}} {{properties of}} generalized power-law (GPL) density profiles are reviewed, and special effort {{is devoted to}} the special cases where GPL density profiles reduce to (i) a double power-law (DPL), and (ii) a single power-law (SPL). Then GPL density profiles are compared with simulated dark haloes (SDH) density profiles, and non-linear least-squares fits are prescribed, involving five parameters (a scaling radius, r 0, a scaling density, ρ 0, and three exponents, α, β, γ), which specify the fitting profile (RFSM 5 method). More specifically, the validity of a necessary condition for the occurrence of an extremal point, is related to the existence of an intersection between three surfaces in a three-dimension space. Using the algorithm makes also establish that the extremal point is a fiducial minimum, while the explicit calculation of the Hessian determinant is avoided to gain in simplicity. In absence of a rigorous proof, the fiducial minimum can be considered as nothing but a fiducial absolute minimum. An application is made to a sample of 17 SDHs on the scale of cluster of galaxies, within a flat ΛCDM cosmological model (E. Rasia, G. Tormen, L. Moscardini, MNRAS 351 (2004) 237). In dealing with the averaged SDH density profile (ADP), a virial radius, rvir, equal to the mean over the whole sample, is assigned, which allows the calculation of the remaining parameters. The following results are found. (i) A necessary condition for the occurrence of an extremal point is satisfied for eight sample haloes, and is not for the remaining nine together with ADP. In the former alternative, an extremal minimum point (EMP) may safely exist. In the latter alternative, the occurrence of an EMP cannot be excluded, but only a non-extremal minimum can be determined. (ii) The occurrence of an EMP implies a sum of square residuals which is systematically lower than its counterpart deduced by use of numerical RFSM 5 methods. Accordingly, EMPs may safely be thought of as absolute minima. With regard to sample haloes where no EMP is detected, the above result maintains in four cases (including ADP), while the contrary holds for the remaining five cases. (iii) The best fit (with no EMP detected) is provided by DPL density profiles for three sample haloes. In addition, DPL density profiles make a rough, but viable approximation in fitting SDH density profiles. The contrary holds for SPL density profiles. No evident correlation is found between SDH dynamical state (relaxed or merging) and asymptotic inner slope of the logarithmic density profile or (for SDH comparable virial masses) scaled radius. Mean values and standard deviations of some parameters are calculated and, in particular, the decimal logarithm of the scaled radius, ξvir, reads and, the standard deviation exceeding by a factor 3. 3 – 3. 4 its counterpart evaluated in an earlier attempt using Navarro et al. (J. F. Navarro, C. S. Frenk, S. D. M. White, MNRAS 275 (1995) 720, J. F. Navarro, C. S. Frenk, S. D. M. White, ApJ 462 (1996) 563, J. F. Navarro, C. S. Frenk, S. D. M. White, ApJ 490 (1997) 493) density profiles (J. <b>S.</b> <b>Bullock,</b> T. <b>S.</b> Kolatt, Y. Sigad, MNRAS 321 (2001) 559). If a large dispersion still maintains for richer samples, in dealing with analytical RSFM 5 methods, a low dispersion found in N-body simulations seems to be an artefact, due to the assumption of Navarro et al. (or any equivalent choice) density profile. It provides additional support to the idea, that Navarro et al. density profiles may be considered as a convenient way to parametrize SDH density profiles, without implying that it necessarily produces the best possible fit (J. <b>S.</b> <b>Bullock,</b> T. <b>S.</b> Kolatt, Y. Sigad, MNRAS 321 (2001) 559). With regard to RFSM 5 methods formulated in the current paper, the exponents of both the best fitting GPL density profile to ADP, (α, β, γ) ≈ (0. 3, 4. 5, 1. 5), and related averages calculated over the whole halo sample,, are far from their Navarro et al. counterparts, (α, β, γ) = (1, 3, 1). The last result, together with the large value of the standard deviation,, is interpreted as due to a certain degree of degeneracy in fitting GPL to SDH density profiles. If it is a real feature of the problem, or it could be reduced by the next generation of high-resolution simulations, still remains an open question. Values of asymptotic inner slope of fitting logarithmic density profiles, are consistent with results from recent high-resolution simulations (J. Diemand, B. Moore, J. Stadel, MNRAS 353 (2004) 624; D. Reed, F. Governato, L. Verde, et al., MNRAS 357 (2005) 82) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{spring of}} 2001 {{will likely be}} remembered as the winter that wouldn 2 ̆ 7 t end, {{especially}} in central and western Nebraska. The last remnants of roadside snowbanks remained in the east until 10 April, but the last blizzard closed down the Panhandle on 21 - 22 April, and the last appreciable snowfall there was on 19 May. None of these dates represent late records, but are remarkably later than average for the past 10 - 15 years, and seemed especially burdensome following the long cold winter and the remarkably early spring the previous year. While I recognize the danger inherent in making generalizations when working with such a small sample size, I feel it worthwhile to comment on differences and similarities between the timing of the 2000 and 2001 nesting seasons. While only a few species allowed direct comparison by being found nesting again in the same location as last year, the following information is offered for what it 2 ̆ 7 s worth. It would have been interesting to compare data on more of the cavity nesters, but unfortunately, I did not locate any active nuthatch nests this year, nor take the time to search out more of the other cavity nesters. In the southern Panhandle, Cassin 2 ̆ 7 s, Western and Eastern Kingbirds, Bluegray Gnatcatcher, Bullock 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Oriole</b> (and Red-winged Blackbird in the east), all appeared to be 2 - 3 weeks later in their breeding cycle than last year. By contrast, also in the Panhandle, Great Blue Heron, Great Homed Owl, Lewis 2 ̆ 7 s Woodpecker, Western Wood-Pewee, Lark Sparrow, and McCown 2 ̆ 7 s Longspur seemed {{to be on the same}} schedule as last year, as were American Crow, Common Grackle, and House Finch in the east. While it seems intuitive that some species would respond to the late spring by nesting later, why didn 2 ̆ 7 t some other species? How much of the difference in timing was actually due to the weather, and how much was due to the randomness of the small sample size or other variables? Obviously, it will take more years of data collection and a much larger sample size, one that includes all species, before generalizations can be made. Witnessing a blizzard disrupt breeding by Pinyon Jays and Canada Geese makes the reason for those delays pretty apparent. But what about kingbirds and gnatcatchers that were not even present yet? Were they later because of delayed plant growth and insect development? More study and many more records are needed before we can speak with certainty...|$|R

I will not routinely list early and late dates and peak counts for each species unless they are significant; readers should refer to past issues of NBR for guidelines as to what are early or late dates and high counts. Observers are, however, urged to report early and late dates and high counts of all migrant species; {{it is difficult to know}} if a sighting is significant until all the reports are pooled in my computer. In general, most observers thought this a fairly routine fall, although the Panhandle continued to be a source of significant new information, thanks to consistent coverage by Steven Dinsmore. Similar coverage of the Rainwater Basin by Joel Jorgensen also has enhanced our knowledge considerably. Every report is valuable: very few of the large list of observers fail to have at least one of their sightings included in the report. There were no new species added to the state list this fall, but this year was amazing in that respect, with 7 new species (some awaiting approval by the Records Committee) bringing the total state list to a very respectable 441 species. Rarest this fall was the pair of Black-bellied Whistling-Ducks in the Rainwater Basin, a second documented state record. Also very rare were a 7 th state record White-winged Dove and 8 th state record Lesser Goldfinch. Other interesting finds included a Brant of the western race, 3 Pomarine Jaegers, the first documented central Nebraska Blue-headed Vireo, a Mountain Chickadee, a Varied Thrush, another report of Baird 2 ̆ 7 s Sparrow, the first Bullock 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Oriole</b> for fall east of the Panhandle, and a White-winged Crossbill.

50|$|A {{leadership}} {{dispute between}} Baldwin de Spynale and Gobert de Lapion in the 1330s made the priory {{particularly vulnerable to}} secular intervention. Gobert was sent over by the abbot to head the priory, accompanied by another monk, John le Large. Baldwin was already in place as prior and vindicated his claim in 1334 {{in the court of}} Bishop Roger Northburgh, which excommunicated Gobert. Baldwin complained that the Vicar of Lapley and other men had raided his home, stolen all his documents and driven off 40 oxen, 20 cows, 15 <b>bullocks,</b> 15 <b>s,</b> and 40 pigs, livestock valued at a total of 100 marks, as well as felling trees and Edward III responded with a commission of oyer and terminer. He then tried to achieve a pause in proceedings in 1335 by granting first Gobert and then Baldwin royal protection for a year, styling each Prior of Lapley. This was to no avail, as there was a second raiding party, this time including Gobert himself and his clerk Gerard, which stole another 100 marks worth of animals and even removed fish from the ponds, leading to a second commission of oyer and terminer. The king, on campaign at Perth in Scotland, then instituted an inquisition that was clearly calculated to exploit the situation for royal advantage, asking not only what had caused the conflict but also whether there was any justification for claiming advowson of the priory. The commissioners discounted the idea, concluding anachronistically that Algar, the founder, had been Earl of Chester and not king. The dispute seems to have continued.|$|R

He was born in Oneida County, New York, in 1833, and was {{for a number of}} years a {{merchant}} at Bainbridge, New York. Daniel subsequently spent two years in the west and then located in Fulton, Oswego County, New York, where he engaged in the carriage business. There Bullock taught music, remaining at that place 14 years. By this marriage, she had three children: Frank C., who was educated at Falley Seminary, became the editor of the Fulton Times, and died in Fulton in 1884, at the age of 27 years, leaving a wife but no children; Phoebe L. died in infancy; and Florence L., born April 22, 1879, who made her home with her mother in Elmira. She was a graduate of the high school of this city, and also took a course in kindergarten work at Providence, Rhode Island.Soon after the death of her son, in 1884, Bullock adopted a little motherless girl, five years of age.|$|R

Richardson, ???Vision based {{closed-loop}} control system for satellite rendezvous with model-in-the-loop validation and testing???, {{paper presented at the}} 23 rd International Symposium on Space Flight Dynamics, Pasadena, California, USA, 29 - 31 October, 2012. A relative motion robotic facility has been developed at the University of Bristol which allows model in the loop testing of Matlab and Simulink based models. Automated rendezvous is highly desirable for space debris collection and satellite on-orbit servicing missions, both of which could require rendezvous with a tumbling object or satellite. For the purposes of this paper, a simple 6 DoF closed loop satellite model was run in real-time with a 1. 3 m scale satellite model mounted on one robot, tracked from the second. Successful closed loop tracking and rendezvous are demonstrated for selected configurations, using a single real sensor and real-time vision tracking software. Key details of the RMR robotic facility are also given, in particular with reference to the real-time interface implementation...|$|R
40|$|Autism {{spectrum}} disorder (ASD) {{is characterized}} by many behavioral symptoms, including delays in social and communicative development. A cluster of symptoms concentrate on speech and language development, especially manipulation of non-verbal information conveyed in prosody. It is largely unknown whether {{this is due to}} functional or structural differences in the brain regions involved in auditory and speech processing, although recent studies have shown that ASD individuals do exhibit different activation patterns in various brain regions in response to speech stimuli. This study investigated responses in regions of the auditory pathway to short recorded and synthesized vowel stimuli. These regions were the Inferior Colliculus, the Left Thalamus, the left Posterior Insula, the Auditory Cortex, Wernicke's area, and Broca's area. The stimuli were parametrized so as to target different signal processing capabilities associated with each region. They were presented to ASD and typically developing (TD) subjects while the salient regions were subject to a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The results suggest that there were not gross differences in how ASD individuals responded from TD individuals in the subcortical regions. Results from the Auditory Cortex, however, showed a significant hemisphere dominance in TD subjects with more temporally complex stimuli that did not appear in ASD subjects. Moreover, the results showed that it was temporally-measured periodicities in the signal that were responsible for this difference. The results also show slightly different activation patterns in cortical regions which could have implications for attentiveness, and semantic and emotional processing. These results suggest that deficiencies in the temporal processing capabilities of the left Auditory Cortex {{play a major role in}} ASD speech processing. byBennett <b>Bullock.</b> Thesis (<b>S.</b> M.)

50|$|Early {{owners of}} the United Verde copper mine in Jerome relied on mule-drawn wagons to {{transport}} material {{to and from the}} mine. In 1882, the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad (A&P) had completed a railway line across northern Arizona, and a north - south 60 mi wagon road was built between Jerome and Ash Fork, where it met the railroad. By 1886, an investor, Thomas <b>S.</b> <b>Bullock,</b> had built another line, the Prescott and Arizona Central (P&AC), from Seligman on the A&P line south to Prescott. Eugene Jerome - for whom Jerome is named - and the other {{owners of the}} United Verde mine switched to shipping about 30 mi west to the P&AC, still by wagon. This arrangement briefly succeeded, but in 1887 the United Verde mine closed after the price of copper fell, and Bullock's line faced serious problems with debt, mismanagement, and failing infrastructure. In 1892, Santa Fe Railway interests built a branch line from Ash Fork to Prescott and forced Bullock's P&AC line out of business. The new line, the Santa Fe, Prescott and Phoenix Railway (SFP&P), was financially sound and well-managed.|$|R

Richardson, ???Control Methodologies for Relative Motion Reproduction in a Robotic Hybrid Test Simulation of Aerial Refuelling???, paper {{presented}} at the AIAA Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC) Conference, Hyatt Regency, Minneapolis, USA, 13 - 16 August, 2012. In many applications it is advantageous to simulate the relative motion of two bodies in a laboratory environment. This permits the testing of sensors and systems critical to the safety of equipment and personnel with reduced risk, and facilitates stage-gate management of large projects to mitigate financial risks. The University of Bristol is collaborating with Cobham Mission Equipment to develop a large-scale facility for relative motion simulation, primarily for the purpose of testing automated air-to-air refuelling systems. The facility incorporates two 6 DOF articulated robotic arms whose motion is dictated by real-time numerical simulations of the physical environment. Sensors on the robot-mounted equipment feed back into the numerical simulation to perform closed loop simulations with real hardware. This paper discusses the development of the facility and the different approaches considered for achieving real-time control of the robotic hardware. It then goes on to focus on aspects of the control topologies and motion optimisation which are used to maximise the performance of the facility. The current capabilities are demonstrated with respect to an aerial refuelling exercise and future challenges are explored...|$|R

Alternative approach methods, such as deep stall and spin techniques, are beneficial for such environments but are less conventional and would benefit from further qualitative and quantitative understanding to improve their implementation. Flight tests of such techniques, with a representative remotely piloted vehicle, {{have been carried out}} for this purpose and the results are presented in this paper. Trajectories and flight data for a range of approach techniques are presented and conclusions are drawn as to the potential benefits and issues of using such techniques for SUAV landings. In particular, the stability of the vehicle on entry to a deep stall was noticeably improved through the use of symmetric inboard flaps (crow brakes). Spiral descent profiles investigated, including spin descents, produced faster descent rates and further reduced landing space requirements. However, sufficient control authority was maintainable in a spiral stall descent, whereas it was compromised in a full spin. - See more at: [URL]...|$|R
