The Harry Potter films have been top-rank box office hits, with all eight releases {{on the list of}} highest-grossing films worldwide. Philosopher's Stone was the highest-grossing Harry Potter film up until the release of the final instalment of the series, Deathly Hallows, while Prisoner of Azkaban grossed the least. As well as being a financial success, the film series has also <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>success</b> among film critics.|$|E

5|$|The {{town was}} turned over to Sheik Dewar, a local ruler who professed support for the British, and Wainwright withdrew his forces to Muscat in early December; all of the {{squadron}} reassembled there by Christmas. Only one further operation was launched, a successful attack on 3 January 1810 against the town of Shinas, which had rebelled against Sultan Sa'id and was swiftly recaptured and restored to him. Although minor naval operations against individual local ships continued into 1810, Wainwright and {{the main body of the}} squadron returned to Bombay in January, having considered their mission to inflict significant damage on the Al Qasimi forces in the Persian Gulf to have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>success.</b>|$|E
5|$|By 22:00, the Rangers and ex-POWs {{arrived at}} Plateros, where they rested {{for half an}} hour. A radio message was sent and {{received}} by Sixth Army at 23:00 that the mission had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>success,</b> {{and that they were}} returning with the rescued prisoners to American lines. After a headcount, it was discovered that POW Edwin Rose, a deaf British soldier, was missing. Mucci dictated that none of the Rangers could be spared to search for him, so he sent several guerrillas {{to do so in the}} morning. It was later learned that Rose had fallen asleep in the latrine before the attack. Rose woke early the next morning, and realized the other prisoners were gone and that he was left behind. Nevertheless, he took the time to shave and put on his best clothes that he had been saving for the day he would be rescued. He walked out of the prison camp, thinking that he would soon be found and led to freedom. Sure enough, Rose was found by passing guerrillas. Arrangements were made for a tank destroyer unit to pick him up and transport him to a hospital.|$|E
5|$|On 17 February 1979, China retaliated against Vietnam's {{invasion}} of Kampuchea by attacking along the Sino-Vietnam border, and within ten days {{had reached the}} provincial capitals. Fighting bogged down due to the maze of tunnels the Chinese encountered; nevertheless, the Chinese army captured Cao Bằng on 2 March and Lạng Sơn on 4 March, reportedly advancing towards Hanoi at a high speed, though not on good terms with its supply lines. However, the following day, China {{announced that it would}} not move deeper into Vietnam, apparently after meeting fierce and unexpectedly harsh resistance by well trained and equipped Vietnamese forces, supplied with American technology left behind from the Vietnam War. Confident that the threat of invasion had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>success,</b> the Chinese subsequently withdrew their forces. Although China failed to decisively win the 27-day conflict, the diversion of troops from Kampuchea facilitated a strong resurgence in Khmer Rouge insurgent operations, making it unavoidable for the young PRK regime in Kampuchea to implement conscription, and requiring Vietnam to station a large portion of its army along the Sino-Vietnamese border.|$|E

5|$|On 27 June, Maisky {{agreed to}} the sending of two {{commissions}} to Spain, to enumerate foreign volunteer forces, and to bring about their withdraw. It was estimated to cost £1,750,000 to £2,250,000, borne by member countries of the Committee. The Nationalists wished to prevent {{the fall of the}} favourable Chamberlain government in the United Kingdom, and so were seen to accept the plan. With much bemoaning, the Republicans also accepted the plan. The Nationalists demanded belligerent rights first, then withdrawals of 10,000 from each side after, which amounted to a rejection of the plan. Following the Munich Agreement – judged by Chamberlain to have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>success</b> – Britain would host similar mediation in Spain. Negrín would propose the removal of the International Brigades, a majority of whom were now Spaniards, at the last meeting of the League of Nations, thereby showing his contempt for the Non-Intervention Committee. Similarly, Italians would leave Spain under the Anglo-Italian agreement, not through the Committee.|$|E
5|$|The CFL re-gained {{relative}} {{stability in the}} 2000s, mostly thanks to enforcement of a salary cap, stricter standards of ownership, and increasingly lucrative television contracts negotiated with Canadian networks. The league has remained solely focused on its Canadian operations, with expansion efforts focused on returning a stable team to Ottawa. The first attempt at a replacement for the Rough Riders, the Ottawa Renegades, played from 2002 to 2005; in its last season, despite league resistance but without any other buyers, the Gliebermans purchased the franchise, then gave {{it back to the}} league, which suspended it prior to the 2006 season. After an extended delay due to stadium problems in Ottawa, the Ottawa Redblacks, who own the Rough Riders' history and trademarks, launched in 2014 and have so far <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>success</b> under the ownership of Jeff Hunt's consortium. Further expansion has been limited to one-off games such as Touchdown Atlantic and Northern Kickoff in more distant Canadian markets.|$|E
