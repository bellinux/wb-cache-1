50|$|The green-capped tanager (Tangara meyerdeschauenseei) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Thraupidae. It is endemic to forest edge and gardens at altitudes of 1450-2200 m. in Puno, Peru, and La Paz, Bolivia. It is fairly common and {{possibly}} spreading, but its small population has led to it being evaluated as Near Threatened by BirdLife International and IUCN. It closely resembles the widespread <b>burnished-buff</b> <b>tanager,</b> but its mantle is bluer (male) or greener (female), and its crown is greenish-buff. Its specific name commemorates the ornithologist Rodolphe Meyer de Schauensee.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are several}} {{subspecies}} of the <b>burnished-buff</b> <b>tanager,</b> them falling into two main groups: The northern and western cayana group, {{and the southern}} and eastern flava group (the subspecies huberi from Maraj√≥ Island is intermediate between the two main groups). Males of the cayana group have an orange-rufous crown, black mask, and cream underparts distinctly tinged blue on the throat and chest. Males of the flava group have an orange-buff crown, and buff underparts with a black patch extending from the mask, over the throat and central chest, to the mid-belly. Males of both groups have turquoise wings and tail. Females are duller than the males, and have black restricted to a poorly demarcated [...] "shadow" [...] of a mask.|$|E
