40|$|During warm weather, {{incorrect}} <b>bedding</b> <b>levels</b> on {{a trailer}} transporting market weight pigs {{may result in}} heat stress, fatigue, and death.

Experiment 2 used 131 loads (n = 22, 917 pigs) {{to determine the effects of}} bedding (3 vs. 6 bags) on transport losses (dead, sum of dead- and euthanized- on arrival; non-ambulatory, sum of fatigued and injured; total transport losses sum of dead and non-ambulatory). Bedding did not affect surface temperature, vocalizations, or slips and falls (p = 0. 58, p = 0. 50, and p = 0. 28, respectively). However, pigs transported on 6 bags/trailer had 1. 5 % more stress signs than pigs transported on 3 bags/trailer (p < 0. 01).

40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>bedding</b> <b>levels</b> and trailer {{compartment}} on internal trailer temperature and relative humidity (RH) during loading and transport of finishing pigs was evaluated in cold and mild weather. Three <b>levels</b> of <b>bedding</b> {{were used in}} each experiment: 0. 6 m 3, 1. 2 m 3, and 2. 4 m 3. In mild weather, internal temperatures were lower when 1. 2 m 3 or 2. 4 m 3 of bedding were used during loading and transport compared to 0. 6 m 3 (P < 0. 05). Internal trailer temperature increased in a quadratic fashion in the top front compartment when 1. 2 m 3 was used (P < 0. 05), and in a linear fashion in the top rear compartment when 2. 4 m 3 were used in cold weather (P < 0. 05). In mild weather, temperature increased linearly in the top front compartment with heavy <b>bedding</b> <b>levels.</b> Relative humidity increased in a linear fashion in the top front compartment with 0. 6 m 3, bottom front with 1. 2 m 3, and top front with 1. 2 m 3 in cold weather (P < 0. 05).

With mega-scale we refer to the whole Scheldt estuary; with meso-scale we refer to tidal channels within a macro-cell.

The model simulations were morphostatic, i. e. the <b>bed</b> <b>levels</b> were fixed.

40|$|In the U. S., 113 million pigs are transported {{annually}} to market, primarily by {{road in a}} tractor trailer. The conditions under which pigs are handled and transported can have {{a direct impact on}} their well-being, which may result in increased transport losses (the sum of dead on arrival and non-ambulatory (sum of fatigued and injured)). Transport losses cost 125 /head for dead on arrival and 37 /head for non-ambulatory pigs, which sum to 46 million yearly. The National Pork Board has recently funded research to improve pig well-being during handling and transport. The objectives of Chapter 3 were to compare the effects of 2 <b>bedding</b> <b>levels</b> on the (1) pig measures at the time of unloading and (2) transport losses during warm weather for market weight pigs.

40|$|The broad aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether <b>bedding</b> <b>level</b> in the transport trailer influenced pig performance and welfare. Specifically, the objective was to define the bedding requirements of pigs during transportation in commercial settings during cold and mild weather. Animals (n = 112, 078 pigs on 572 trailers) used were raised in commercial finishing sites and transported in trailers to commercial processing plants. Dead on arrival (DOA), non-ambulatory (NA), and total dead and down (D 2 Ì† 6 D) data were collected and skin surface temperatures of the pigs were measured by infrared thermography. Data were collected during winter (Experiment 1) and fall/spring (Experiment 2). Total D 2 Ì† 6 D percent showed no interaction between <b>bedding</b> <b>level</b> and outside air temperature in any experiments. Average skin surface temperature during unloading increased with outside air temperature linearly in both experiments (P 3 Ì†c 0. 01).

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a short study {{to examine the}} behaviour of submerged flow over a thin plate weir with differing upstream and downstream <b>bed</b> <b>levels</b> i. e. an unequal bed weir {{as opposed to an}} equal bed weir where the upstream and downstream beds are at the same level. As submerged weir flow is a function of downstream conditions, it was thought that a lower downstream bed would make submerged flow over the weir easier, This is turn suggested that; 	The shape of the upstream head (Hu) vs downstream head (Hd) graph would change, being initially more steep in the unequal bed case. 	The Froude Number of the approaching flow would be lower for the unequal bed weir than for an equal bed weir at the same submergence. 	Using one of the existing submerged flow formula would lead to an erroneous calculated value. A series of measurements was done on two model weirs of different sizes subject to successive levels of submergence. Analysis of the readings of upstream and downstream heads indicated that the difference in <b>bed</b> <b>levels</b> was significant and the three effects above were noted. The work also suggested a new form of equation to calculate flow over a submerged weir. This was looked at briefly...|$|R
