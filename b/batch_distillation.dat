25|$|The main {{difference}} between laboratory scale distillation and industrial distillation is that laboratory scale distillation is often performed batch-wise, whereas industrial distillation often occurs continuously. In <b>batch</b> <b>distillation,</b> {{the composition of}} the source material, the vapors of the distilling compounds and the distillate change during the distillation. In <b>batch</b> <b>distillation,</b> a still is charged (supplied) with a batch of feed mixture, which is then separated into its component fractions which are collected sequentially from most volatile to less volatile, with the bottoms (remaining least or non-volatile fraction) removed at the end. The still can then be recharged and the process repeated.|$|E
25|$|To {{control and}} {{optimize}} such industrial distillation, a standardized laboratory method, ASTM D86, is established. This test method {{extends to the}} atmospheric distillation of petroleum products using a laboratory <b>batch</b> <b>distillation</b> unit to quantitatively determine the boiling range characteristics of petroleum products.|$|E
25|$|Brandy {{is usually}} {{produced}} in pot stills (<b>batch</b> <b>distillation),</b> but the column still {{can also be}} used for continuous distillation. Distillate obtained in this manner has a higher alcohol concentration (approximately 90% ABV) and is less aromatic. Choice of the apparatus depends on the style of brandy produced. Cognac and South African brandy are examples of brandy produced in batches while many American brandies use fractional distillation in column stills.|$|E

The present methodology is demonstrated with the detailed study of the transesterification of dimethyl carbonate in two reversible cascade reactions in <b>batch</b> reactive <b>distillation</b> process. Pure methanol is produced as distillate, and pure diethyl carbonate is produced at the bottom simultaneously in middle-vessel column; in each section, continuous feeding of ethanol is necessary.

2500|$|Laboratory scale distillations {{are almost}} {{exclusively}} run as <b>batch</b> <b>distillations.</b> The device used in distillation, {{sometimes referred to}} as a still, consists at a minimum of a reboiler or pot in which the source material is heated, a condenser in which the heated vapour is cooled back to the liquid state, and a receiver in which the concentrated or purified liquid, called the distillate, is collected. Several laboratory scale techniques for distillation exist (see also [...] ).|$|R
40|$|<b>Batch</b> {{reactive}} <b>distillation,</b> {{which combines}} {{the flexibility of}} batch process with the advantages of reactive distillation, {{can be an effective}} alternative to conventional batch processing. For instance, acetate esters such as n-butyl acetate and amyl acetate can be produced using <b>batch</b> reactive <b>distillation.</b> Previous studies have shown that isopropyl acetate can also be produced in <b>batch</b> reactive <b>distillation</b> with the addition of chloroform as an entrainer and using a large reflux ratio and number of stages. This paper compares the vapor−liquid and liquid−liquid features of these acetate ester systems, and shows the similarities and differences among them. We show why the isopropyl system is more difficult than the others and how semibatch reactive distillation without an additional entrainer can result in a feasible and more efficient process for the production of isopropyl acetate than has been previously known. In a semibatch reactive distillation, the loss of isopropyl alcohol can be substantially decreased, the purity of water byproduct can be improved, and the total reflux or recycle of the organic distillate phase can be avoided. The semibatch reactive distillation can provide 20 % higher production efficiency than <b>batch</b> reactive <b>distillation...</b>|$|R
25|$|In modern {{industrial}} uses, a {{packing material}} {{is used in}} the column instead of trays when low pressure drops across the column are required. Other factors that favor packing are: vacuum systems, smaller diameter columns, corrosive systems, systems prone to foaming, systems requiring low liquid holdup, and <b>batch</b> <b>distillation.</b> Conversely, factors that favor plate columns are: presence of solids in feed, high liquid rates, large column diameters, complex columns, columns with wide feed composition variation, columns with a chemical reaction, absorption columns, columns limited by foundation weight tolerance, low liquid rate, large turn-down ratio and those processes subject to process surges.|$|E
25|$|Heating {{an ideal}} mixture of two {{volatile}} substances A and B (with A having the higher volatility, or lower boiling point) in a <b>batch</b> <b>distillation</b> setup (such as in an apparatus {{depicted in the}} opening figure) {{until the mixture is}} boiling results in a vapor above the liquid which contains a mixture of A and B. The ratio between A and B in the vapor will be different from the ratio in the liquid: the ratio in the liquid will be determined by how the original mixture was prepared, while the ratio in the vapor will be enriched in the more volatile compound, A (due to Raoult's Law, see above). The vapor goes through the condenser and is removed from the system. This in turn means that the ratio of compounds in the remaining liquid is now different from the initial ratio (i.e., more enriched in B than the starting liquid).|$|E
25|$|Continuous {{distillation}} {{differs from}} <b>batch</b> <b>distillation</b> in the respect that concentrations should not change over time. Continuous distillation can be run {{at a steady}} state for an arbitrary amount of time. For any source material of specific composition, the main variables that affect the purity of products in continuous distillation are the reflux ratio {{and the number of}} theoretical equilibrium stages, in practice determined by the number of trays or the height of packing. Reflux is a flow from the condenser back to the column, which generates a recycle that allows a better separation with a given number of trays. Equilibrium stages are ideal steps where compositions achieve vapor–liquid equilibrium, repeating the separation process and allowing better separation given a reflux ratio. A column with a high reflux ratio may have fewer stages, but it refluxes a large amount of liquid, giving a wide column with a large holdup. Conversely, a column with a low reflux ratio must have a large number of stages, thus requiring a taller column.|$|E

500|$|An {{alternative}} to continuous distillation is <b>batch</b> <b>distillation,</b> where {{the mixture is}} added to the unit {{at the start of the}} distillation, distillate fractions are taken out sequentially in time (one after another) during the distillation, and the remaining bottoms fraction is removed at the end. [...] Because each of the distillate fractions are taken out at different times, only one distillate exit point (location) is needed for a <b>batch</b> <b>distillation</b> and the distillate can just be switched to a different receiver, a fraction-collecting container. [...] <b>Batch</b> <b>distillation</b> is often used when smaller quantities are distilled. [...] In a continuous distillation, each of the fraction streams is taken simultaneously throughout operation; therefore, a separate exit point is needed for each fraction. [...] In practice when there are multiple distillate fractions, the distillate exit points are located at different heights on a fractionating column. The bottoms fraction can be taken from the bottom of the distillation column or unit, but is often taken from a reboiler connected to the bottom of the column.|$|E
500|$|Since a {{continuous}} distillation unit is fed constantly with a feed mixture and not filled {{all at once}} like a <b>batch</b> <b>distillation,</b> {{a continuous}} distillation unit does not need a sizable distillation pot, vessel, or reservoir for a batch fill. [...] Instead, the mixture can be fed directly into the column, where the actual separation occurs. [...] The height of the feed point along the column can vary on the situation and is designed so as to provide optimal results. [...] See McCabe–Thiele method.|$|E
2500|$|An {{implication}} of one boiling {{point is that}} lighter components never cleanly [...] "boil first". At boiling point, all volatile components boil, but for a component, its percentage in the vapor {{is the same as}} its percentage of the total vapor pressure. Lighter components have a higher partial pressure and thus are concentrated in the vapor, but heavier volatile components also have a (smaller) partial pressure and necessarily evaporate also, albeit being less concentrated in the vapor. Indeed, <b>batch</b> <b>distillation</b> and fractionation succeed by varying the composition of the mixture. In <b>batch</b> <b>distillation,</b> the batch evaporates, which changes its composition; in fractionation, liquid higher in the fractionation column contains more lights and boils at lower temperatures. Therefore, starting from a given mixture, it appears to have a boiling range instead of a boiling point, although this is because its composition changes: each intermediate mixture has its own, singular boiling point.|$|E
