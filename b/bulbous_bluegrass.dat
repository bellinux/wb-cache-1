5000|$|Poa bulbosa is {{a species}} of grass known by the common names <b>bulbous</b> <b>bluegrass</b> or bulbous meadow-grass. It is native to Eurasia and North Africa, but it is present {{practically}} worldwide as an introduced species. It is widespread in the United States and southern Canada. It {{was introduced to the}} eastern United States around 1906 and the western US in 1915 as a contaminant in shipments of alfalfa seed. It was intentionally planted on both the east and west coasts to control weeds and prevent erosion. Today it is a common grass across the continent and is a noxious weed in some areas. It is a sturdy, hardy, persistent, aggressive grass that easily outcompetes many other plants and becomes the dominant species in disturbed habitat types, such as overgrazed fields.|$|E

40|$|The {{increase}} in abundance {{and distribution of}} <b>bulbous</b> <b>bluegrass</b> (Poa bulbosa) has been a concern of the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources. Very {{little research has been}} conducted to analyze the invasiveness of <b>bulbous</b> <b>bluegrass</b> in the Intermountain West. This study used data from 1982 to 2012 at range trend study sites across the state of Utah to investigate trends in <b>bulbous</b> <b>bluegrass</b> abundance, range expansion, and co-occurrence with big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata) and cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum). This study addressed {{the question of whether the}} increase of <b>bulbous</b> <b>bluegrass</b> correlates with changes in sagebrush and/or cheatgrass in Utah using a log-response ratio analysis. The log-response ratio identified the correlation of dominance of each species to one another over time. Results of this analysis illustrated an increased abundance of <b>bulbous</b> <b>bluegrass</b> in relation to cheatgrass and sagebrush. In addition to the log-response analysis, a series of maps were created that clearly show the increase abundance and range expansion of <b>bulbous</b> <b>bluegrass</b> during the study period. The results illustrate the need for more research to identify if <b>bulbous</b> <b>bluegrass</b> is detrimental to sagebrush populations. The increased abundance of <b>bulbous</b> <b>bluegrass</b> within sagebrush rangelands could threaten desirable flora and fauna and have negative effects on human dimensions and economics. Further research is recommended to identify the effects of <b>bulbous</b> <b>bluegrass</b> on sagebrush rangelands, and whether <b>bulbous</b> <b>bluegrass</b> is detrimental to sagebrush plant communities and how this will affect social and economic aspects of human dimensions. In addition, research is needed to examine whether climatic, landscape, or anthropogenic variables are attributing to the increase of <b>bulbous</b> <b>bluegrass</b> within sagebrush rangelands...|$|E
40|$|<b>Bulbous</b> <b>bluegrass</b> (Poa bulbosa) is a {{perennial}} bunchgrass with a widespread distribution throughout its native range in Europe and the Mediterranean. This grass {{has been introduced}} into North America and now occurs {{throughout much of the}} western United States. Within its native range, <b>bulbous</b> <b>bluegrass</b> reproduces mainly through sexual means; however, in North America clonal reproduction occurs primarily through the production of vegetative structures called bulblets. High chromosome counts are frequently reported for this species and suggest it is a polyploid. To assess the level and pattern of genetic diversity of <b>bulbous</b> <b>bluegrass</b> across a portion of its introduced range, a total of 10 populations from Idaho, Oregon, and Washington were analyzed by staining for 14 enzymes that were coded for by 19 genetic loci. Results indicate that <b>bulbous</b> <b>bluegrass</b> contains higher levels of genetic variation than expected for an introduced clonal plant species: 27. 9 % of loci are polymorphic per population, with an average of 1. 54 alleles per locus, and a mean observed heterozygosity of 0. 202. On average, 64 % of all individuals within these populations possess three or four alleles at one or more loci; a value consistent with previous reports for autopolyploid species. A total of 84 multilocus genotypes were detected in these 10 populations, with an average of 9. 6 genotypes per population. The number and complex distribution of multilocus genotypes observed in this study {{may be the result of}} multiple introductions of this species into its new range, and/or occasional sexual reproduction within introduced populationsNovak and Welfley "Genetic diversity in the introduced clonal grass Poa bulbosa (<b>Bulbous</b> <b>Bluegrass).</b> " Northwest Science. 1997; 71 (4) : 271 - 28...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1974 The {{seasonal}} {{development and}} habits of Labops hesperius Uhler were studied in rangeland seeded to intermediate wheatgrass (Agropyron intermediurn (Host) Beauv.) in Baker County, Oregon, The first nymphs appeared on March 22, and required about one week to complete {{each of the}} five nymphal stadia. Most small nymphs stayed on the ground beneath the straw and litter during daylight and fed on the leaf blades of grasses at night. Fifth instars and adults fed on the leaf blades during both the day and night. The adults began to emerge on April 26, and the preoviposition period of the females lasted about two weeks. A maximum of 48 eggs was found in the ovaries of a single female, but the mean number of eggs laid per female was estimated at twenty-one and nine eggs, respectively, at two study sites. Most eggs had been laid by June 15, and the eggs remained dormant until March of the following year. Thus L. hesperius completed its development and reproduction in about 2 1 / 2 months and had an obligatory diapause that lasted about 9 1 / 2 months. Labops hesperius was found in a variety of habitats, but the greatest numbers were found in two dense stands of intermediate wheatgrass which had received little or no grazing during the past 12 years. Other grasses used as food included Agropyron desertorum (Fisch.) Schult., A. repens (L.) Beauv., A. spicatum (Pursh) Scribn. and Smith, A. trichophorum (Link) Richt., Bromus carinatus Hook and Arn., B. tectorum L., Dactylis glomerata L., Festuca idahoensis Elmer. Hordeum vulgare L., Koeleria cristata (L.) Pers., Poa bulbosa L., P. pratensis L., Secale cereale L., and Stipa lemmonii (Vasey) Scribn. Females usually oviposited in dry straws of grass that had been produced during the previous season, because oviposition was completed before straws suitable for oviposition were produced. However, dry straws of <b>bulbous</b> <b>bluegrass</b> (Poa bulbosa L.) were used for oviposition during the same season in which they grew, since <b>bulbous</b> <b>bluegrass</b> matured earlier than other grasses and had dried before oviposition was completed. Straws of <b>bulbous</b> <b>bluegrass</b> were the preferred oviposition site although <b>bulbous</b> <b>bluegrass</b> was rare in most ranges. Straws of Agropyron desertorum, A. intermedium, and A. spicatum were also readily used for oviposition. The effect of feeding injury by L. hesperius on the yield and composition of wheatgrass was determined by chemical analysis of forage samples from sprayed and unsprayed plots. Feeding injury reduced the yield and nutritional value of wheatgrass by removing the cell contents from the leaves. The loss of forage production was about 18 percent in May when feeding injury was most severe. However, the grass continued to grow because of adequate moisture and when the grass reached maturity near the end of July, the loss of forage production was only about two percent of the total forage production. Exploratory tests suggested that field burning, removal of a hay crop, and grazing might reduce densities of L. hesperius by destroying the overwintering eggs and the straw used for oviposition. Insecticidal control {{did not appear to be}} economical, since the return per acre from rangelands was small and since frequently the cost of treatment would have been greater than the value of the forage lost to L. hesperius...|$|E

Please look for up-to-date information in the OSU Extension Catalog: [URL] wheatgrass, beardless wheatgrass, and big bluegrass were seeded as overstory grasses. Streambank wheatgrass, canby bluegrass, <b>bulbous</b> <b>bluegrass,</b> and Ladak alfalfa were seeded as companion species. Pure and mixed stands were seeded on sagebrush-bunchgrass range in eastern Oregon to compare yield and competitiveness. The grasses were planted in 1956, 1957, and 1958, and half of each plot was fertilized with ammonium nitrate at 20 or 30 pounds of N per acre. The plots were evaluated for seeding success, herbage production, weed production, and brush establishment in four consecutive years after planting. Yields of overstory grasses in pure stands exceeded those in mixed stands. Nitrogen fertilization increased yields about 45...|$|E
40|$|According to memoirs and {{historical}} anecdotes, weedy species replaced native bunchgrasses at many locales in the Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument {{during the late}} 1800 s and early 1900 s under high use, season-long grazing by sheep, cattle, and horses. Starting in the 1950 s, improved management reduced the spread of medusahead (Taeniatherum caput-medusae) and replaced weedy annual grasses with non-native perennial <b>bulbous</b> <b>bluegrass</b> (Poa bulbosa). Anecdotes reported that native perennial grasses increased in response to improved management of the livestock. Recent inventories verify continued increase of native bunchgrass under modern range management practices at certain locations. Re-examination of 15 to 30 year old stand inventories indicates changes in extent and abundance of individual species and lifeforms at the landscape level. Non-native perennial forbs, native or non-native grasslike plants (including sedges), and non-native perennial grasses have increased in extent over time. Only one non-native perennial forb occupies fewer stands than previously. Native and non-native perennial grasses were the only life-forms that changed significantly i...|$|E
40|$|We studied big {{sagebrush}} {{plant community}} {{responses to a}} two-way chain harrow and broadcast seeding of herbaceous species at eight Wyoming big sagebrush sites with the same ecological site classification; five were cultivated for dryland wheat production during the 1950 - 1980 s, then seeded with introduced forage grasses and reverted back to grazing lands, while three had not been previously cultivated. Five years after treatment, densities of sagebrush seedlings and snakeweed plants increased in cultivated sites during {{the second and third}} year after treatment. In addition, perennial forb cover increased for cultivated sites, while perennial grass biomass increased for non-cultivated sites. Plant community change after treatment also varied between non-cultivated and cultivated sites, and response to treatment was most strongly correlated with reductions in sagebrush cover, increases in the perennial grass <b>bulbous</b> <b>bluegrass,</b> and increases in 10 herbaceous species—four of which were seeded. Our results emphasize that broad variability in plant community responses to sagebrush reduction is possible within the same ecological site classification, and that cultivation history can leave long- lasting legacy effects...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2015 The {{sagebrush}} steppe ecosystem of the Columbia Plateau {{has become}} degraded {{by a long}} history of alternative land use and associated perturbations. Protection of remnant stands of intact sagebrush steppe currently relies upon their preservation within the nation's network of parks and protected-areas. The John Day Fossil Beds National Monument, located in central Oregon, and Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve, located in southeast Idaho provided a unique opportunity to examine the pattern of plant species distribution and invasion dynamics in two Columbia Plateau protected-area landscapes with a mixed history of alternative land management and protection. Non-metric multidimensional scaling and nonparametric multiplicative regression were applied to data from the National Park Service's Inventory and Monitoring program to investigate correlations of native and non-native plant species to environmental and landscape variables. Understanding how these patterns change at the landscape scale and identifying variation in these patterns between landscapes may improve efficacy in resource management planning. Principle native species reviewed included sagebrush species (Artemisia spp.), broom snakeweed (Gutierrezia sarothrae), currants (Ribes spp.), desert sweet (Chamaebatiaria millefolium), dwarf goldenbush (Ericameria nana), green rabbitbrush (Chrysothamnus viscidiflorus), bluebunch wheatgrass (Pseudoroegneria spicata), bluegrass species (Poa spp.), sandberg bluegrass (Poa secunda.), wheatgrass species (Agropyron spp.), Great Basin wildrye (Lymus cinereus), and squirreltail (Elymus elymoides). Principle non-native invasive species reviewed included cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum), medusahead (Taeniatherum caput-medusae), and <b>bulbous</b> <b>bluegrass</b> (Poa bulbosa), tumble mustard (Sisymbrium altissimum), and tansy mustard (Descurainia spp.). The distribution and relative cover of principle species within the John Day Fossil Beds National Monument were found correlated to combined effects of slope and aspect, representing a transition from steep south-facing slopes to steep north-facing slopes. Species cover and distribution were also found to be correlated to crop year precipitation, the amount of rain and snow falling between October and May. Individual species response along topographic gradients revealed higher relative cover of B. tectorum on the more xeric, south-facing slopes and an increase in the cover of P. spicata on more mesic, north-facing slopes. The relative cover of G. sarothrae and T. caput-medusae were found to increase with increasing crop year precipitation. The distribution and relative cover of principle species within Craters of the Moon National Monument were found correlated to a north to south spatial separation of sampling frames. This gradient represented a transition from higher elevation to lower elevation, decreasing moisture availability, and increasing proximity to alternative land use (i. e. grazing, agriculture) and transportation corridors. Individual species response along these topographic and environmental gradients revealed higher relative cover of non-native invasive species in southern portions of the monument and with positive correlation to the more xeric and disturbed portions of the Monument. The results of this study have increased the understanding of species cover distribution across environmental and topographic gradients within protected sagebrush steppe landscapes while providing insight into the applicability of resilience theory to Columbia Plateau ecology...|$|E
