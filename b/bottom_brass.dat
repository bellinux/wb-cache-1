Calico firearms feature a top-mounted, helical-feed, 50- or 100-round magazine that ejects spent shells from a port in the <b>bottom,</b> making a <b>brass</b> catcher practical in various situations. The Calico 9 mm pistols, carbines and submachine guns use the roller-delayed blowback principle used in the Heckler & Koch series of firearms.|$|R

50|$|Fazilka {{was used}} to carry troops from India to South Africa during the Boer war. She left Port Natal on 30 January 1900 to make the return trip to India. Four days after passing through the Mozambique Channel the tail shaft broke. The shaft had broken in two places {{partially}} rupturing the stern tube, so the first requirement was to shift ballast and get the stern out of the water. Attempts were made to rig sails but progress was slow and after an attempt to tow, the engineers under Mr. Brown worked in intolerable conditions to repair the shaft. The repairs were complicated and after various failures {{it was decided to}} take down the high pressure engine and use the <b>bottom</b> end <b>brasses</b> as a clamp. This was effective in holding the shaft and then the rear end breakage was connected by a Thomson coupling. Using the low pressure engines only, Fazilka was able to make Colombo at a speed of 9 knots km/h. This {{was one of the most}} heroic ship repairs at sea and the Engineers were rewarded accordingly. John Macdonald, the 4th Engineer receiving a Gold watch and the sum of £30.|$|R
5|$|The skins of the fuselage, {{wings and}} {{tailplane}} were secured by rivets, and in critical {{areas such as}} the wing forward of the main spar where an uninterrupted airflow was required, with flush rivets; the fuselage used standard dome-headed riveting. From February 1943 flush riveting was used on the fuselage, affecting all Spitfire variants. In some areas, such as {{at the rear of the}} wing, and the lower tailplane skins, the top was riveted and the <b>bottom</b> fixed by <b>brass</b> screws which tapped into strips of spruce bolted to the lower ribs. The removable wing tips were made up of duralumin-skinned spruce formers. At first the ailerons, elevators and rudder were fabric-covered. When combat experience showed that fabric-covered ailerons were impossible to use at high speeds, a light alloy replaced the fabric, enhancing control throughout the speed range.|$|R
