5|$|While Mackay's account {{held that}} {{a wide array of}} society was {{involved}} in the tulip trade, Goldgar's study of archived contracts found that even at its peak the trade in tulips was conducted almost exclusively by merchants and skilled craftsmen who were wealthy, but not members of the nobility. Any economic fallout from the bubble was very limited. Goldgar, who identified many prominent <b>buyers</b> <b>and</b> <b>sellers</b> in the market, found fewer than half a dozen who experienced financial troubles in the time period, and even of these cases {{it is not clear that}} tulips were to blame. This is not altogether surprising. Although prices had risen, money had not changed hands between <b>buyers</b> <b>and</b> <b>sellers.</b> Thus profits were never realized for sellers; unless sellers had made other purchases on credit in expectation of the profits, the collapse in prices did not cause anyone to lose money.|$|E

As a high price tends to dampen demand while a low price tends to increase demand, in theory there is a particular price {{somewhere in the middle}} where supply and demand will match.|$|E

25|$|Marx {{also argues}} that, insofar as {{capitalist}} class society is intrinsically a very contradictory system – it contains many conflicting and competing forces – the masking of its true characteristics becomes an integral feature {{of how it}} actually operates. <b>Buyers</b> <b>and</b> <b>sellers</b> compete with other <b>buyers</b> <b>and</b> <b>sellers.</b> Businesses cannot practically do so without confidentiality and secrecy. Workers compete for job opportunities and access to resources. Capitalists and workers compete for {{their share of the}} new wealth that is produced, and nations compete with other nations. The masks are therefore not optional, but necessary, and the more one is able to know about others, the more subtle, ingenious and sophisticated the masks become.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} a middleman on the search and trading behavior of the traders. It is shown that the <b>buyer</b> <b>and</b> <b>seller</b> types with middle valuations choose to search for each other, while the <b>buyer</b> <b>and</b> <b>seller</b> types with high or low valuations drop out of the search market and choose to trade directly with the middleman. The ask and bid prices of the middleman act as an outside option for the <b>buyer</b> <b>and</b> <b>seller,</b> <b>and</b> influence the outcome of the bargaining between the two. The model generalizes Gehrig (1993) by endogenizing the traders' search intensities, by allowing the traders to go to an intermediary even if thy have engaged in search, and by enabling the intermediary to provide the service of immediacy.

25|$|The NYSE {{trades in}} a {{continuous}} auction format, where traders can execute stock transactions on behalf of investors. They will gather around the appropriate post where a specialist broker, who is employed by a NYSE member firm (that is, he/she is not {{an employee of the}} New York Stock Exchange), acts as an auctioneer in an open outcry auction market environment to bring <b>buyers</b> <b>and</b> <b>sellers</b> together and to manage the actual auction. They do on occasion (approximately 10% of the time) facilitate the trades by committing their own capital {{and as a matter of}} course disseminate information to the crowd that helps to bring <b>buyers</b> <b>and</b> <b>sellers</b> together. The auction process moved toward automation in 1995 through the use of wireless hand held computers (HHC). The system enabled traders to receive and execute orders electronically via wireless transmission. On September 25, 1995, NYSE member Michael Einersen, who designed and developed this system, executed 1000 shares of IBM through this HHC ending a 203-year process of paper transactions and ushering in an era of automated trading.|$|E
25|$|For example, in marketplaces such as eBay or Taobao, <b>buyers</b> <b>and</b> <b>sellers</b> {{are the two}} groups. Buyers {{prefer a}} large number of sellers, and, meanwhile, sellers prefer {{a large number of}} buyers, such that the members in one group can easily find their trading {{partners}} from the other group. Therefore, the cross-side network effect is positive. On the other hand, a large number of sellers mean severe competition among sellers. Therefore, the same-side network effect is negative. Figure 1 depicts these relationships.|$|E

40|$|Part 2 : Short PapersInternational audienceIn e-marketplaces {{with limited}} {{inventory}} where buyers’ demand {{is larger than}} sellers’ supply, promoting honesty raises new challenges: sellers may behave dishonestly because they can sell out all products without the necessity of gaining high reputation; buyers may provide untruthful ratings to mislead other buyers {{in order to have}} a higher chance to obtain the limited products. In this paper, we propose a novel incentive mechanism to promote <b>buyer</b> <b>and</b> <b>seller</b> honesty in such e-marketplaces. More specifically, our mechanism models both <b>buyer</b> <b>and</b> <b>seller</b> honesty. It offers higher prices to the products provided by honest sellers so that the sellers can gain larger utility. Honest buyers also have a higher chance to do business with honest <b>sellers</b> <b>and</b> are able to gain larger utility. Experimental results confirm that our mechanism promotes both <b>buyer</b> <b>and</b> <b>seller</b> honesty...|$|R

25|$|Another {{factor to}} be {{considered}} in valuing closely held companies is the marketability of an interest in such businesses. Marketability is defined as the ability to convert the business interest into cash quickly, with minimum transaction and administrative costs, and {{with a high degree of}} certainty as to the amount of net proceeds. There is usually a cost and a time lag associated with locating interested and capable buyers of interests in privately held companies, because there is no established market of readily available <b>buyers</b> <b>and</b> <b>sellers.</b>|$|E
25|$|Contracts are {{negotiated}} at futures exchanges, which act as {{a marketplace}} between <b>buyers</b> <b>and</b> <b>sellers.</b> The buyer of a contract {{is said to be}} long position holder, and the selling party is said to be short position holder. As both parties risk their counter-party walking away if the price goes against them, the contract may involve both parties lodging a margin {{of the value of the}} contract with a mutually trusted third party. For example, in gold futures trading, the margin varies between 2% and 20% depending on the volatility of the spot market.|$|E
