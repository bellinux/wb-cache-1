40|$|Nemo Engineering AS (Nemo) {{has built}} a series of Tees for welding into {{offshore}} pipelines for transportation of hydrocarbons. The purpose with the Tees is to allow connection of new pipelines from existing or future oil and gas fields. This is often a cost-effective solution which minimises the need for construction of new pipelines. Some of the Tees are designed with open tee branch which is isolated with a ball valve system. Another solution is to design a Tee where the branch is blinded off by a solid steel <b>barrier</b> <b>plate.</b> This is a socalled Hot Tap Tee (HTT). At the time when a new pipeline is {{to be connected to}} the HTT, the steel <b>barrier</b> <b>plate</b> is drilled open by a core drill operation. This operation is performed when the pipeline is at full flow and operational pressure. The core drill operation is complex and requires a large amount of subsea tooling equipment. In addition, the operation is time consuming and involves elements of risk in case of failing equipment. Nemo Engineering as is currently working on the Ormen Lange project where two HTTs at 850 m water depth will be opened by core drilling in 2009 for connection of pipelines from a new gas field (Ormen Lange Southern Field). During this project, equipment for blinding/sealing of the opened HTT’s has been developed. This is an Isolation Plug (IP), which is used to seal off the open HTT. The purpose with the IP is to use it in case of future disassembly of the connected pipeline and isolation ball valve without compromising the integrity and operational service condition for the HTT-pipeline. Nemo Engineering as has initiated a development project of a new HTT design where the steel <b>barrier</b> <b>plate</b> is changed out with a combination of using the IP and a steel membrane seal in the tee branch. The membrane will function as a substitution for the thick steel <b>barrier</b> <b>plate</b> and function as a metallic seal until the IP is removed.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a new {{concentrating solar power}} central receiver system with integral thermal storage. Hillside mounted heliostats direct sunlight into a volumetric absorption molten salt pool, which also functions as a single tank assisted thermocline storage system. Concentrated light penetrates the molten salt and is absorbed over a depth of several meters; the molten salt free surface tolerates high irradiance levels, yet remains insensitive {{to the passage of}} clouds. Thermal losses to the environment are reduced with a refractory-lined domed roof and a small, closeable aperture. The molten salt and cover provide high and low temperature heat sources that can be optimally used to maximize energy production throughout the day, even when the sun is not shining. Hot salt is extracted from the upper region of the tank and sent through a steam generator, then returned {{to the bottom of the}} tank. An insulated <b>barrier</b> <b>plate</b> is positioned vertically within the tank to enhance the natural thermocline which forms and maintain hot and cold salt volumes required for operation. As a result, continuous, high temperature heat extraction is possible even as the average temperature of the salt is declining. Experimental results are presented for sodium-potassium nitrate salt volumetric receivers optically heated with a 10. 5 kilowatt, 60 -sun solar simulator. Designs, construction details and performance models used to estimate efficiency are presented for megawatt-scale molten salt volumetric receivers capable of operating with low cost nitrate or chloride salt eutectics at temperatures approaching 600 'C and 1000 'C, respectively. The integral storage capabilities of the receiver can be sized according to local needs, thereby enabling power generation on demand. by Daniel Shawn Codd. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|A concentrating {{solar power}} system is {{presented}} which uses hillside mounted heliostats to direct sunlight into a volumetric absorption molten salt receiver with integral storage. The concentrated sunlight penetrates and is absorbed by molten salt in the receiver through a depth of 4 – 5 m, making the system insensitive {{to the passage of}} clouds. The receiver volume also acts as the thermal storage volume eliminating the need for secondary hot and cold salt storage tanks. A small aperture and refractory-lined domed roof reduce losses to the environment and reflect thermal radiation back into the pond. Hot salt is pumped {{from the top of the}} tank through a steam generator and then returned to the bottom of the tank. An insulated <b>barrier</b> <b>plate</b> is positioned within the tank to provide a physical and thermal barrier between the thermally stratified layers, maintaining hot and cold salt volumes required for continuous operation. As a result, high temperature thermal energy can be provided 24 / 7 or at any desired time. The amount of storage required depends on local needs and economic conditions. About 2500 m[superscript 3] of nitrate salt is needed to operate a 4 MW[subscript e] steam turbine 24 / 7 (7 h sunshine, 17 h storage), and with modest heliostat field oversizing to accumulate energy, the system could operate for an additional 24 h (1 cloudy day). Alternatively, this same storage volume can supply a 50 MWe turbine for 3. 25 h without additional solar input. Cosine effect losses associated with hillside heliostats beaming light downwards to the receiver are offset by the elimination of a tower and separate hot and cold storage tanks and their associated pumping systems. Reduced system complexity also reduces variable costs. Using the NREL Solar Advisor program, the system is estimated to realize cost-competitive levelized production costs of electricity.

Due to a slight adjustment of the standard screen printing process, and subsequent plating of Ni, Cu and Ag, silver consumption was reduced to < 16  mg per cell front side on standard BSF 15. 6  cm x 15. 6 cm mono crystalline wafers, produced only with inline capable techniques. Contact adhesion forces of 1. 5  N/mm and, efficiencies of 18. 4  % were achieved. For the long term stability analysis on cell and module level, cells with different nickel diffusion barrier masses (10 - 40 mg/cell) were treated on hotplates at 200, 225 and 250 °C while detecting degradation due to copper diffusion by measuring the pFF. Sufficient cell life times are predicted for 10  mg Ni by the resulting Arrhenius plot. After 750 h damp heat test of one cell modules no visible degradation was determined. This means that accelerated degradation on hotplates show the degradation due to copper diffusion more strongly than 750 hours damp heat test.

Since analytical methods are limited to relatively simple geometries, boundary conditions and loadings, numerical methods have been applied to this problem.

In addition, this study includes an elasto-plastic analysis of plate bending problems. The elasto-plastic formulation utilizes moment-based yield criterion and a nonlayered approach.

40|$|Graduation date: 1976 Extensive new trackline {{coverage}} of the Chile Trench between 23 °S and 34 °S, including more than 60 bathymetric and seismic reflection profiles across the trench axis, allows a much more detailed study of the tectonics and sedimentation of this feature than previously possible. Sediment distribution along the axis shows a remarkable variation from over a kilometer of turbidites in the axis south of 33 °S to a barren axis in places north of 27 °S. Turbidity currents originating on the outer continental margin in the south carry sediment northward along the axis. Ponding behind structural <b>barriers</b> created by <b>plate</b> convergence restricts the amount of sediment reaching northern trench sections. Horst and graben blocks are the dominant structural features on the seaward trench slope, with fault offsets of 500 to 1000 meters. Grabens range in width from 4 to 8 km, while the faulting probably extends down into oceanic layer three. Faulting is most pronounced in the deeper northern parts of the trench, but {{can also be seen}} in the basement beneath undeformed axial sediments in the south. This crustal rupture can be related to extensional stress in the upper oceanic crust due to the downbending of the Nazca Plate prior to subduction. Most of the active normal faulting occurs soon after the plate begins its descent into the trench, and not within the trench axis. Using structure, sediment distribution, bathymetry, and morphology, the trench and outer continental margin can be divided into three provinces (Northern, 23 °- 27 °S; Central 27 °- 33 °S; and Southern, 33 °- 34 °S) separated by distinct tectonic transition zones at 27 °S and 33 °S. These boundaries coincide with breaks in onshore geologic trends and correlate less well with seismic zone segmentation. An analysis of potential strain due to subduction along a non-arcuate trench concludes that segmentation in the trench is probably controlled more by continental block structure than by the linearity of the trench. A narrow, continuous pond of sediment partially fills the Central Province trench axis between 32 ° 30 'S and 27 °S. Trench axis morphology and piston core samples indicate there is transport of terrigenous sediment down the axis from the abundant sediment supply regions of the Southern Province. A model is formulated from this data which accounts for the sediment wedge in the Central Province by supply of turbidites from the south. A steady-state of axial fill can be maintained by one typical flow every 14 to 27 years. Uplifted axial turbidites are present on the seaward trench slope at 30 ° 35 'S, elevated 350 meters above the axis. Radiocarbon dating puts the age of initial uplift at 5380 ± 350 years B. P., which results in a minimum vertical movement rate of 6. 5 cm/yr. Reversed faulting due to compressive stresses generated by plate convergence is the presumed mechanism of uplift. A model is proposed to explain the differences in the Chilean continental margin morphology {{in each of the three}} provinces. The radical differences in the amount of sediment available to the trench axis appears to be a prime influence in the development of the margin. An abundance of axial sediments provides a buffer zone along the major interplate contact (slip) zone, plus material to be accreted into the lower continental slope. If the amount of axial sediments is limited, excessive frictional resistance to slippage between the converging plates may tectonically erode the margin by slowly wearing away the underside of the continental slope...|$|R
40|$|This work is {{motivated}} by {{the quest for a}} material system that can simultaneously act as a Cu diffusion barrier and seed layer for the galvanic fill of vias and trenches in BEOL processing. Ru itself has insufficient barrier properties, even though a remarkable difference was found between PVD and PECVD or PEALD Ru-C films [1]. Since Ta(N) is known as excellent Cu diffusion barrier, alloying of TaN had been considered a promising method to retard Cu diffusion in Ru films during the last years. Chun-Wei Chen et al. demonstrated a thermodynamic stability of higher than 600 °C for PVD Ru 39 - Ta 16 N 19 films using analytical techniques like TEM and XPS depth profiling [2]. In our recent study we investigated PVD Ru 65 -Ta 17 N 18 films on the basis of bias temperature stress (BTS) and triangular voltage sweep (TVS) after 600 °C annealing, revealing an excellent Cu diffusion barrier performance [3]. All Ru-TaN diffusion barrier layers discussed above were deposited on the SiO 2 layer by reactive magnetron cosputtering using Ru and Ta targets. The total gas flow consisted of a Ar / N 2 mixture. However, these potential Ru-TaN films were not directly plateable by means of Cu ECD since their Ru content was too low. Sung-Wook Kim et al. produced PEALD Ru 52 -TaN 45 films and demonstrated a thermodynamic stability higher than 700 °C on the basis of TEM, XRD and sheet resistance measurements [4]. S. Kumar et al. identified a PEALD Ru 92 -TaNC 8 layer, i. e. with a very high Ru concentration, to be a sufficient Cu diffusion barrier according to their BTS / TVS measurements [5]. Cu ECD and feature fill were conveniently demonstrated directly on the latter films, but no high temperature annealing and subsequent BTS, as well as oxygen diffusion barrier tests or Cu wetting tests were carried out on PEALD Ru-TaNC so far. However, T. Nogami et al. reported that neither PVD Ru-Ta nor their nitrides in form of RuTa(N) would act as a Cu diffusion barrier according to their TVS measurements [6]. The Ru content in this study varied between 70 at. % and 90 at. %. In another study, N. Torazawa et al. investigated RuTa(N) films on the basis of SIMS profiles and also found that their RuTa(N) films were not thermodynamically stable [7]. It should be noted, however, that these films were fabricated using an alloyed RuTa target and reactive sputtering in a Ar / N 2 plasma. Thus, two major questions arise from the literature so far. First, the possibility of plateable PVD Ru-TaN films that have a Ru concentration higher than 85 at. % and exhibit also excellent Cu diffusion barrier properties, good oxygen barrier properties and good Cu wetting properties. Second, the high temperature stability of plateable PEALD or PECVD Ru-TaNC films, as well as their oxygen barrier properties and Cu wetting behaviour. This work comprises a comparison of PECVD, PEALD and PVD Ru-TaN films with a focus on those films that exhibit a Ru concentration higher than 85 -at. %. Fig. 1 plots XRD curves of several PEALD Ru-TaNC films. It was found that even a small amount of 4 at. % TaN inside Ru significantly decreases crystallization. For PECVD and PVD films a similar trend was observed (not shown here). Fig. 2 is a HRTEM cross-sectional picture of a Ru 90 -TaNC 10 film. It still shows lattice fringes. Its corresponding HAADF STEM image reveals a continuously mixed phase that was also quantitatively found in this shape in the XPS depth profile for the Ru-signal (not shown here). Fig. 3 + 4 are TVS plots of different barrier samples after 350 °C and 600 °C, respectively, and subsequent BTS. It was found for PEALD Ru-TaN that addition of 5 at. % of TaN into the Ru matrix produces an excellent Cu diffusion barrier, since no Cu peak was detected after 600 °C annealing and BTS of + 2 MV/cm, 1 / 2 hr, at 250 °C. Nanolaminate-like PECVD films needed somewhat higher TaN concentrations for an excellent behaviour. Investigations on PVD Ru-TaN are still ongoing. Table I summarizes some results from the O 2 <b>barrier,</b> Cu direct <b>plating</b> and Cu wetting tests. PVD Ru-TaN films showed good Cu wetting behaviour and better oxygen barrier properties than PEALD Ru-TaNC so far. Direct Cu plating occurred only for samples with Ru concentrations of more than 90 at. % for all investigated PVD, PECVD and PEALD Ru-TaN films...|$|R
