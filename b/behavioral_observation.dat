As part of a thor-ough and accurate assessment of children’s progress in response to psychosocial interventions, psychologists often utilize repeated systematic direct <b>behavioral</b> <b>observations</b> and <b>behavioral</b> rating scales (Shapiro & Heick, 2004). Rat-ing scales provide {{the advantage of being}} nationally normed, thereby facilitating meaningful comparisons between children. However, research has indicated that teachers often exaggerate their ratings of ADHD-related behaviors when children also display oppositional behavior (Stevens, Quittner, & Abikoff, as cited in Lauth, Heubeck, & Mackowiak, 2006). Whereas systematic <b>behavioral</b> <b>observations</b> and behavior rating scales can complement each other as part of a thorough psychological evaluation, <b>behavioral</b> <b>observations</b> {{can also be used to}} directly track the behaviors of both the student and the teacher; systematic <b>behavioral</b> <b>observations</b> can be used to examine teacher instructional behaviors, how teachers respond to student misbehavior, and for monitoring their levels of intervention implementation integrity (Sheridan, Swanger-Gagné, Welch, Kwon, & Garbacz, 2009).

2500|$|Behavioral Checklists and Scales: {{behaviors}} are more definite than traits. [...] The critical incidents method (or critical incident technique) concerns [...] "specific behaviors indicative of {{good or bad}} job performance". [...] Supervisors record behaviors of what they judge to be job performance relevant, and they keep a running tally of good and bad behaviors. [...] A discussion on performance may then follow. [...] The behaviorally anchored rating scales (BARS) combine the critical incidents method with rating scale methods by rating performance on a scale but with the scale points being anchored by behavioral incidents. [...] Note that BARS are job specific. In the <b>behavioral</b> <b>observation</b> scale (BOS) approach to performance appraisal, employees are also evaluated {{in the terms of}} critical incidents. In that respect, it is similar to BARS. However, the BOS appraisal rate subordinates on the frequency of the critical incidents as they are observed to occur over a given period. The ratings are assigned on a five-point scale. The behavioral incidents for the rating scale are developed {{in the same way as}} for BARS through identification by supervisors or other subject matter experts. Similarly, BOS techniques meet equal employment opportunity because they are related to actual behavior required for successful job performance.|$|E

40|$|Observations {{of hunting}} and meat eating in our closest living relatives, {{chimpanzees}} (Pan troglodytes), suggest that among primates, regular inclusion of {{meat in the}} diet is not a characteristic unique to Homo. Wild chimpanzees are known to consume vertebrate meat, but its actual dietary contribution is, depending on the study population, often either unknown or minimal. Constraints on continual direct observation throughout the entire hunting season mean that <b>behavioral</b> <b>observations</b> are limited {{in their ability to}} accurately quantify meat consumption. Here we present direct stable isotope evidence supporting <b>behavioral</b> <b>observations</b> of frequent meat eating among wild adult male chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) in Taï National Park, Côte d’Ivoire. Meat eating among some of the male chimpanzees is significant enough to result in a marked isotope signal detectable on a short-term basis in their hair keratin and long-term in their bone collagen. Although both adult males and females and juveniles derive their dietary protein largely from daily fruit and seasonal nut consumption, our data indicate that some adult males also derive a large amount of dietary protein from hunted meat. Our results reinforce <b>behavioral</b> <b>observations</b> of male-dominated hunting and meat eating in adult Taï chimpanzees, suggesting that sex differences in food acquisition and consumption may have persisted throughout hominin evolution, rather than being a recent development in the human lineage...|$|R

Behavioral traces are pieces of evidence that indicate behavior occurred, but the actor is not present (e.g., litter in a parking lot or readings on an electric meter). <b>Behavioral</b> <b>observations</b> involve the direct witnessing of the actor engaging in the behavior (e.g., watching how close a person sits next to another person).
