50|$|Tapered roller {{bearings}} use conical rollers {{that run on}} conical races. Most {{roller bearings}} only take radial or axial loads, but tapered roller bearings support both radial and axial loads, and generally can carry higher loads than ball bearings due to greater contact area. Tapered roller bearings are used, for example, as the wheel bearings of most wheeled land vehicles. The downsides to this bearing is that due to manufacturing complexities, tapered roller bearings are usually more expensive than ball bearings; and additionally under heavy loads the tapered roller is like a wedge and bearing loads tend to try to eject the roller; the force from the collar which keeps the roller in the bearing adds to <b>bearing</b> <b>friction</b> compared to <b>ball</b> <b>bearings.</b>|$|R

They are sized {{to fit into}} racks with mounting flanges on the ends to mate to the mounting holes in racks. In some cases, one mounting flange is formed into the rack slide with an adapter bracket attached {{to the other end}} to accommodate different depths of the rack. The outer fixed member is attached to the rack and the inner moving member is generally screwed {{to the side of the}} mounted equipment. Rack slides are typically compound or 3-part slides allowing full extension of the mounted equipment and generally include provision for sliding the inner member completely free to allow removal of the equipment from the rack. They can also include stops to prevent accidentally pulling the equipment out of the rack without releasing the stop mechanism.|$|R

30|$|We {{introduced}} closed-form symbolic expressions for {{the possibility}} distributions of the coefficients of friction during the tightening process of bolted joints. This relieves the engineer from the burden of propagating the uncertainties through the computations to obtain the uncertain output. The parameters in the distribution functions can be identified by a standardized fastener testing system according to ISO 16047 as has been demonstrated in this paper. An uncertainty analysis also revealed that {{the total amount of}} uncertainty in the coefficient of <b>bearing</b> <b>friction</b> is almost 40 % larger than in the coefficient of thread friction. This finding suggests that in practice, {{it is more important to}} control the coefficient of <b>bearing</b> <b>friction</b> than the coefficient of thread friction. The uncertainty analysis also showed that the real value of the coefficient of <b>bearing</b> <b>friction</b> is likely to be about 5 % and the real value of the coefficient of thread friction to be about 1 % higher than the corresponding expected value.|$|R

40|$|Wind tunnel {{tests were}} {{conducted}} at Mach numbers 1. 70, 2. 16, and 2. 86 to determine the static aerodynamic characteristics of a cruciform canard-controlled missile with fixed or free rolling tailfin afterbodies. Mechanical coupling effects of the free-rolling-tail afterbody were investigated by using an electronic electromagnetic brake system providing arbitrary tail-fin brake torques with continuous measurements of tail-to-mainframe torque and tail roll rate. Remote-controlled canards were deflected to provide pitch, yaw, and roll control. Results indicate that the induced rolling moment coefficients due to canard yaw control are reduced and linearized for the free-rolling-tail (free-tail) configuration. The canards of the latter provide conventional roll control for the entire angle-of-attack test range. For the free-tail configuration, the induced rolling moment coefficient due to canard yaw control increased and the canard roll control decreased with increases in brake torque, which simulated <b>bearing</b> <b>friction</b> torque. It appears that a compromise in regard to <b>bearing</b> <b>friction,</b> for example, low-cost <b>bearings</b> with some <b>friction,</b> may allow satisfactory free-tail aerodynamic characteristics that include reductions in adverse rolling-moment coefficients and lower tail roll rates...|$|R

40|$|The International Space Station (ISS) {{attitude}} control {{is provided by}} two means: The Russian Segment uses thrusters and the U. S. Segment uses double-gimbaled control moment gyroscopes (CMG). CMGs are used as momentum exchange devices, providing non propulsive {{attitude control}} for the vehicle. The CMGs are {{very important for the}} ISS program because, first, they save propellant - which needs to be transferred to the Station in special cargo vehicles - and, second, they provide the microgravity environment on the Station - which is necessary for scientific experiments planned for the ISS mission. Since 2002, when one of the CMG on the ISS failed, all CMGs are closely monitored. High gimbal rates, vibration spikes, unusual variations of spin motor current and bearing temperatures are of great concern, since these parameters are the CMG health indicators. The telemetry analysis of these and some other CMG parameters is used to determine constrains and make changes to the CMGs operation on board. These CMG limitations, in turn, may limit the ISS attitude control capabilities and may be critical to ISS operation. Therefore, {{it is important to know}} whether the CMG parameter is nominal or out of family, and why. The goal of this project is to analyze an important CMG parameter - spin motor current. Some operational decisions are made now based on the spin motor current signatures. The spin motor current depends on gimbal rates, ISS rates, and spin <b>bearing</b> <b>friction.</b> The spin <b>bearing</b> <b>friction</b> in turn depends on the bearing temperatures, wheel rates, normal load - which is a function of gimbal and wheel rates - lubrication, etc. The first task of this project is to create a spin motor current mathematical model based on CMG dynamics model and the current knowledge on <b>bearing</b> <b>friction</b> in microgravity...|$|R
