5|$|A {{division}} of the U.S. Department of Transportation, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) regulates nearly {{all aspects of the}} trucking industry. Truck drivers are limited by the number of daily and weekly hours they may drive, the roads and highways they may drive upon, and a lower legal definition of drunkenness. The Federal Highway Administration has established 0.04 percent as the blood alcohol concentration (BAC) level at or above which a CMV driver is deemed to <b>be</b> <b>driving</b> under the influence of alcohol. States maintain a BAC level between 0.08 and 0.10 percent for non-CMV drivers. In some states, trucks also have special speed limits, in addition to restrictions on driving in certain lanes (normally the far right lanes of multi-lane highways).|$|E

The average house price across Angus has risen by 14.9% in the past year (to November 2006) and now stands at £124,451.

5|$|She later {{made her}} {{debut in the}} Winston Cup Series in the No. 84 Michael Kranefuss Racing Ford Taurus, and planned to run six races. The events were chosen because they were at tracks where Robinson felt comfortable, located in large markets where they would receive more attention. Her {{schedule}} was devised to allow Robinson time to test. She planned to race at Talladega Superspeedway but decided against {{it because of the}} rules regarding restrictor plate racing. Robinson failed to qualify for the first race she attempted (at California Speedway) when her car's rear-end gearing became detached causing her to collide with the wall. Four races later, she started from 32nd at Michigan International Speedway, and became the first woman to start a NASCAR Cup Series race since Patty Moise in 1989. Robinson finished 34th after spinning her car in the track's second turn but avoided damage. After she failed to qualify for her next two races, she was unable to complete her schedule due to sponsorship issues. Robinson stated that she used the season as motivation; she hoped to <b>be</b> <b>driving</b> consistently in five years, and wanted to be a spokesperson for women.|$|E

McDuffie during his death at the 1991 Budweiser at The Glen racing event. A single-car crash with rookie Parker Kligerman caused Nemechek's car to struggle until it was driven to the garage on lap 310 of 500. Nemechek's constant start and park performances has caused him to beat McDuffie's old record in 655 races. In April 2014, Nemechek {{announced that he would}} <b>be</b> <b>driving</b> the No. 86 Deware Racing Group Chevrolet Camaro with sponsorship from Bubba Burger. In the 2014 Aarons 312, Nemechek was running towards the front during the entire race. With 3 laps remaining, Nemechek was running in the top 10 and finished 6th, his 126th top ten in the Nationwide Series. For the Coke Zero 400, Nemechek entered with the No. 29 RAB Racing Toyota with sponsorship from Toyota Care, but failed to qualify. Nemechek joined Randy Humphrey Racing for the Oral-B USA 500, qualifying 34th and finishing 37th. He returned to RAB Racing's No. 29 at the 2014 GEICO 500, and initially qualified 24th. However, his car failed post-race inspection for an improperly sealed oil tank encasement, leaving him as one of the race's 3 DNQs. This was the first time Nemechek did not race on a superspeedway in his 22 years of Sprint Cup competition.|$|E
