25|$|These {{locomotives}} {{were converted}} from Class 31 locomotives. The first, no. 97203, was {{operated by the}} Railway Technical Centre, based at Derby. It was used to haul various test-trains operated by the centre. However, in 1987, the locomotive was written-off after having sustained fire damage. Therefore, a replacement {{in the form of}} 97204 was converted. This later returned to normal traffic, as no. 31970. Both locomotives were painted in RTC's red/cream livery with a black <b>bodyside</b> band.|$|E
25|$|Externally, the {{locomotives}} all received high-intensity headlights, which {{changed the}} appearance of the front end. Starting with 50006, the first six locomotives were outshopped in the standard BR Blue livery. However, in 1980, 50023 Howe became the first to be outshopped in a revised livery with wrap around yellow cabs, large <b>bodyside</b> numerals and BR logo, in a livery that became known as BR Large Logo Blue.

25|$|The SS {{was now a}} trim option {{limited to}} the mid-level Malibu series. Shoppers could even get an SS station wagon this year - with the option of a 454-cubic-inch V8 engine, no less—but the mix of sport and {{utilitarian}} wagon virtues would last only a single season. Included was a black grill with SS emblem, lower <b>bodyside</b> and wheel opening striping, bright roof drip moldings, color-keyed dual sport mirrors, black taillight bezels, SS fender and rear panel emblems, special front and rear stabilizer bars, 14x7 inch rally wheels, 70-series raised white lettered tires, special instrumentation and SS interior emblems.|$|E
25|$|The late-1980s {{also saw}} the {{introduction}} of many new liveries. The class had previously only worn electric blue when built, replaced by the standard BR Blue livery from 1967. The first new livery was introduced by the InterCity sector in 1984 with the unveiling of a new grey and white livery, with a red <b>bodyside</b> stripe.

25|$|In the 2004 model year, the XG350 {{received}} larger front brakes (discs {{went from}} 10.9- to 12-inch), {{which in turn}} required a 16-inch spare tire as standard equipment, replacing the 'space-saver' design used since 2001. Also new this year were restyled front and rear bumpers, <b>bodyside</b> moldings, headlights (now with HID availability), driving lights, tail lamps, grille, and deck lid with recessed license plate holder. The high-mounted stop lamp in the rear window went to an all-new LED design. The interior wood-tone trim changed to a lighter shade, glove compartment and storage bins were now covered in charcoal gray material (formerly black), the door-mounted power window switch panels now matched the interior color (previously, they were high-gloss wood-tone), recessed seat tethers allowed for secure installation of child seats in all three rear seat positions, and the trunk hinges were now supported using hydraulic pistons. Standard equipment leather upholstery was available in solid deep charcoal or a two-tone finish featuring a tan interior with brown dashboard/center console and upper door trim. The L versions were equipped with specific 12-spoke silver-painted allow rims featuring center caps covering the lug nuts.

In its most patriotic or flamboyant factory trim The Machine was painted white featured bold red, white, and blue reflective stripes (made by 3M) on the <b>bodysides</b> that wrapped over the trunk lid.|$|R
50|$|Due in part {{to their}} large, mainly flat <b>bodysides,</b> Swiss Federal Railways were {{approached}} early on with requests for the Re 460 {{to be used as}} mobile advertising hoardings. Despite opposition from some quarters, the money that could be earned swayed the decision and the first such locomotive, Re 460 015 was unveiled in 1994 in Agfa livery. Today no other loco type in Switzerland carries so many different liveries.|$|R
500|$|Like the {{original}} version, the Aurion continues to offer differing frontal design treatments across the range. From side, the rehashed design is {{identified by the}} deletion of <b>bodyside</b> moulding strips {{and a range of}} new wheels designs, including the standard fitment of alloy wheels on the base-line AT-X. Interior upgrades in the form of new colour combinations are featured, along with upgraded instruments and gauges giving greater turn signal and warning-signal clarity. Revised audio systems, lighting and in-cabin storage are also featured. Prodigy and Presara versions receive a new [...] "linear satin" [...] wood grain finish.|$|E
2500|$|Railfreight livery, a colour scheme {{specifically}} for freight locomotives, was unveiled when Class 58 58001 drove through a plastic screen at Doncaster Works on 9 December 1982.

A later version added a red stripe along the lower edge of the locomotive <b>bodyside.</b>|$|E

25|$|Like {{the other}} GM divisions, Buick {{completely}} restyled its B- and C-body cars for 1971. The full-size cars emerged larger and heavier than before and also ever after. The styling featured curved <b>bodysides,</b> long hoods and wide expanses of glass, {{similar to that}} of Chrysler Corporation's 1969 full-sized cars, but with a lower beltline than the Chrysler products. Semi-fastback rooflines were utilized on two-door hardtop coupes and convertibles had a new top design to permit a full-width rear seat.|$|R

2500|$|Upon sectorisation, most {{secondary}} passenger routes {{which did}} not fall under the InterCity or Network SouthEast banner were re-designated as Regional Railways (originally Provincial).

5000|$|Taillights on hardtop coupes and sedans still ran wall-to-wall, but {{the twin}} backup lights were {{moved from the}} center to further outboard—approximately eight inches in from either fender side. Once again, the wagon {{received}} few changes at the rear, but added a new design for its optional woodgrain side trim, which filled in its upper <b>bodysides.</b> Its lower edge flowed downward aft of its peak {{at the leading edge}} above each front wheelhouse, in similar fashion to the Buick Skylark's side [...] "sweepspear" [...] styling cue.|$|R
2500|$|Another two-car set was {{converted}} from former Keihin-Tōhoku Line end cars at Nagano Works, {{and moved to}} the JR East Yokohama area training centre next to Kurihama Station in July 2008, replacing the 105 series 2-car set previously used there.

2500|$|... "Landau" [...] {{model was}} also {{introduced}} in 1975, and was primarily an appearance package.
