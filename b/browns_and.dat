5|$|During the strike-shortened 1982 season, {{only nine}} regular season games were played, and a {{modified}} playoff format was instituted. Divisional play was ignored (there were some cases where division rivals had both games {{wiped out by}} the strike, although each division ultimately sent at least one team to the playoffs), and the top eight teams from each conference (based on W-L-T record) were advanced to the playoffs. As a result, this became {{the first time that}} teams with losing records qualified for the playoffs: the 4–5 Cleveland <b>Browns</b> <b>and</b> the 4–5 Detroit Lions.|$|E
5|$|Eleven of the Bears' UFAs did not return, nine of whom joining other teams, {{starting}} with linebacker Geno Hayes' signing with the Jacksonville Jaguars on March 13. The Bears lost another linebacker in Nick Roach on March 15, {{when he joined}} the Oakland Raiders, and another defensive player was lost when cornerback D. J. Moore was signed by the Carolina Panthers four days later. On March 20, eight-time Pro Bowler and 13-year linebacker Brian Urlacher was not retained for the 2013 season. Six days later, Jason Campbell was signed by the Cleveland <b>Browns,</b> <b>and</b> the next day, Lance Louis joined the Miami Dolphins.|$|E
5|$|One year later, eleven {{more players}} were {{selected}} in the 2009 NFL Draft, again leading all universities {{in the number of}} players drafted into the NFL that season.

5|$|Slowed by knee injuries, Motley {{left the}} Browns after the 1953 season. He {{attempted}} a comeback in 1955 as a linebacker for the Pittsburgh Steelers but was released {{before the end}} of the year. He then pursued a coaching career, but was turned away by the <b>Browns</b> <b>and</b> other teams he approached. He attributed his trouble finding a job in football to racial discrimination, questioning whether teams were ready to hire a black coach. Motley was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1968.|$|E
5|$|As the Browns recaptured {{a hint of}} past {{success in}} 1994, all was not well behind the scenes. Modell was in {{financial}} trouble. The origins of Modell's woes dated to 1973, when he worked out a deal to lease Cleveland Municipal Stadium from the city for a pittance: only enough to service the facility's debt and pay property taxes. Cleveland Browns Stadium Corporation, or Stadium Corp., a company Modell and a business associate created and owned, held the 25-year lease. Stadium Corp. then subleased the stadium to the <b>Browns</b> <b>and</b> the Cleveland Indians, and rented it out for concerts and other events. While the deal worked fine {{for the city and}} Modell early on, the owner was later dogged by excessive borrowing and lawsuits.|$|E
5|$|Chappuis {{was drafted}} by the Pittsburgh Steelers, and reports in February 1948 {{indicated}} that the Steelers had offered him a two-year contract for $20,000 per year. However, Chappuis passed up the Steelers' offer, opting instead {{to play for the}} new All-America Football Conference (AAFC). In June 1948, Chappuis signed with Branch Rickey's Brooklyn Dodgers of the AAFC after coach Carl Voyles outbid the Steelers for his services at $17,000. Chappuis had been drafted by the Cleveland <b>Browns,</b> <b>and</b> the Dodgers gave the Browns three draft picks in exchange for the right to sign Chappuis. Rickey had felt that modern football was based on speed and that he could win with a good center, passing quarterback and two tall sprinting ends. Thus, he placed a premium on signing Chappuis, the passing quarterback. The college All-star game caused Chappuis to miss three weeks of practice and he played little in the early season games because he had not learned his plays.|$|E

5|$|For {{the second}} year in a row, the Cleveland <b>Browns</b> <b>and</b> the New York Yankees faced off in the AAFC {{championship}} game, this time on a cold December day at Yankee Stadium. The crowd of 61,879 was the largest ever to watch a professional football championship game. The <b>Browns</b> <b>and</b> Yankees had played to a 28–28 tie the previous month, but the championship game did not feature much scoring because of an icy field. The Browns scored a touchdown in the first quarter on a short run by Graham set up by a 51-yard run up the middle of the field by Motley. New York scored a field goal in the second quarter, but Jones ran for another touchdown in the third, and the Browns won 14–3. The slippery field made longer passes dangerous, and Graham instead relied on shorter routes, ending the game with 14 completions and 112 passing yards. Motley was a key performer for the Browns, running for 109 yards on 13 carries, including his touchdown. The Browns' defense, meanwhile, kept Spec Sanders and New York's offense in check. New York had just 13 first downs in the game and 212 total yards. A stop by the defense in the second quarter as the Yankees reached the Browns' five-yard line forced New York to kick its lone field goal. Tommy Colella added an interception in the third quarter to stop another New York drive. Sanders had just 40 yards of rushing on 12 attempts and 89 yards of passing. Gillom's booming punts – his five kicks averaged 45 yards – also helped the Browns stop New York's dangerous return game. The Yankees had a 4.7-yard punt return average.|$|E
5|$|Houtteman {{continued}} his successful {{season in the}} second half. On August 19, he faced the <b>Browns</b> <b>and</b> pitched a one-hitter, and faced the minimum 27 batters in the process. Houtteman ended the season just short of Ted Gray's prediction of 20 victories, and finished {{the season with a}} 19–12 record. He led the league in shutouts with four and was second in games started with 34, second in innings pitched with 274.7, third in wins, and third in complete games with 21. His ERA of 3.54 was good for fifth in the American League. He also earned six points in MVP voting, and finished tied for 24th. On October 2, the day after the 1950 season ended, Houtteman married Shelagh Marie Kelly. They met in New York's Catskill Mountains at Grossinger's Resort.|$|E
