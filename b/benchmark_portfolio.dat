40|$|We {{propose a}} new multiple-benchmark tracking-error model for {{portfolio}} selection problem. The tracking error of a portfolio from {{a set of}} <b>benchmark</b> <b>portfolios</b> {{is defined as the}} difference between its return and the highest return from the set of benchmarks. We derive closedform solution of our portfolio strategy, whose main component is the sum of the <b>benchmark</b> <b>portfolios</b> weighted by their respective probabilities of attaining the highest return among the <b>portfolios</b> in the <b>benchmark.</b> These probabilities, also known as the persistency values, are less sensitive to estimation errors in the means and covariances. These features help to stabilize the computational performance of our portfolio strategy against estimation errors. We use the proposed model to address several pertinent issues in active portfolio management: (1) What are the benefits in tracking performance of multiple benchmarks? We demonstrate that under suitable conditions, multiple benchmarks tracking error model can actually produce portfolio strategy that has less variability in portfolio returns, compared to the portfolio strategy constructed using single benchmark model, given a fixed target rate of returns. This addresses the agency issue in this problem, as portfolio managers are more concerned with variability of the excess returns above the benchmark, whereas the investors are more concerned with the variability of the total returns. (2) How and when to rebalance the portfolio allocation when prices and asset returns change over time, taking into account transaction cost? We show that our model can control for transaction cost by adding the buy-and-hold strategy into the set of <b>benchmark</b> <b>portfolios.</b> This approach reduces drastically the transaction volume of several popular static portfolio rules executed dynamically over time. Last but not least, we perform comprehensive numerical experiments with various empirical data sets to demonstrate tha our approach can consistently provide higher net Sharpe ratio (after accounting for transaction cost), higher net aggregate return, and lower turnover rate, compared to ten different <b>benchmark</b> <b>portfolios</b> proposed in the literature, including the equally weighted portfolio (the 1 /N strategy) ...|$|R

50|$|In {{portfolio}} theory, {{a mutual}} fund separation theorem, mutual fund theorem, or separation theorem is a theorem stating that, under certain conditions, any investor's optimal portfolio can be constructed by holding each of certain mutual funds in appropriate ratios, where the number of mutual funds is smaller {{than the number of}} individual assets in the portfolio. Here {{a mutual fund}} refers to any specified <b>benchmark</b> <b>portfolio</b> of the available assets. There are two advantages of having a mutual fund theorem. First, if the relevant conditions are met, it may be easier (or lower in transactions costs) for an investor to purchase a smaller number of mutual funds than to purchase a larger number of assets individually. Second, from a theoretical and empirical standpoint, if it can be assumed that the relevant conditions are indeed satisfied, then implications for the functioning of asset markets can be derived and tested.|$|E

In fact, we have to distinguish between normal returns, provided by the fair reward for portfolio exposure to different risks, and obtained through passive management, from abnormal performance (or outperformance) due to the manager’s skill (or luck), whether through market timing, stock picking, or good fortune. The first component is related to allocation and style investment choices, which may not be under the sole control of the manager, and depends on the economic context, while the second component is an evaluation {{of the success of the}} manager’s decisions. Only the latter, measured by alpha, allows the evaluation of the manager’s true performance (but then, only if you assume that any outperformance is due to skill and not luck).|$|E

It {{is the result of}} an extensive analysis done on the historical time series of approximately 430 systemic assets and 835 single stocks worldwide. The systemic assets are bond, equity and commodity indices and a selection of currency pairs. The single stocks are mainly US and European, equities. The monthly FCO cockpit reports are usually divided into two parts: the first part presents the state of the world, based on the analysis of the systemic assets, including stock and bond indices, currencies and commodities; the second part zooms in on the bubble behavior of single stocks by calculating the bubble warning indicators as well as two financial strength indicators, which indicate the fundamental value of the stock and the growth capability respectively. The stocks are the constituents of the Stoxx Europe 600, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 indices. These indicators provide a stock classification into four quadrants: Quadrant 1: Stocks with a strong positive bubble score and a strong value score; Quadrant 2: Stocks with a strong positive bubble score and a weak value score; Quadrant 3: Stocks with a strong negative bubble score and a weak value score; Quadrant 4: Stocks with strong negative bubble score and a strong financial strength. These four quadrants are used to construct four <b>benchmark</b> <b>portfolio</b> each month and are followed to test for their performance.

40|$|Large {{institutional}} investors allocate their funds {{over a number}} of classes (e. g. equity, fixed income and real estate), various geographical regions and different industries. In practice, these allocation decisions are usually made in a hierarchical (top-down), consecutive way. At the higher decision level, the allocation is made on basis of <b>benchmark</b> <b>portfolios</b> (indexes). Such indexes are then set as targets for the lower levels. For example, at the top level the allocation decision is {{made on the basis of}} asset class benchmark indexes, on the second level the decisions are made on the basis of sector benchmark indexes, etc. Obviously, the lower levels have considerable flexibility to deviate from these targets. That is the reason why targets often come with limits on the maximally allowed deviation (or "tracking error") from these targets. The potential consequences of deviations from the <b>benchmark</b> <b>portfolios</b> have received very little attention in the literature. In this paper, we discuss and illustrate this influence. The lower level tracking errors with respect to the benchmark indexes propagate to the top level. As a result the risk-return characteristics of the actual aggregate portfolio will be different from those of the initial benchmark-based portfolio. We illustrate this effect for a two level process to allocate funds over individual US stocks and sectors. We show that the benchmark allocation approaches used in practice yield inferior solutions when compared to a non-hierarchical approach where full information about individual lower level investment opportunities is available. Our results reveal that even small deviations from the <b>benchmark</b> <b>portfolios</b> can cause large shifts in the top-level risk-return space. This implies that the incorporation of lower level information in the initial top-level decision process will lead to a different (possibly better) allocation. decision flexibility;multi-level decision process;porfolio management;tracking error analysis...|$|R

50|$|Performance {{measurement}} {{should not}} be reduced to the evaluation of fund returns alone, but must also integrate other fund elements that would be of interest to investors, such as the measure of risk taken. Several other aspects are also part of performance measurement: evaluating if managers have succeeded in reaching their objective, i.e. if their return was sufficiently high to reward the risks taken; how they compare to their peers; and finally whether the portfolio management results were due to luck or the manager’s skill. The need to answer all these questions has {{led to the development of}} more sophisticated performance measures, many of which originate in modern portfolio theory. Modern portfolio theory established the quantitative link that exists between portfolio risk and return. The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) developed by Sharpe (1964) highlighted the notion of rewarding risk and produced the first performance indicators, be they risk-adjusted ratios (Sharpe ratio, information ratio) or differential returns compared to benchmarks (alphas). The Sharpe ratio is the simplest and best known performance measure. It measures the return of a portfolio in excess of the risk-free rate, compared to the total risk of the portfolio. This measure is said to be absolute, as it does not refer to any benchmark, avoiding drawbacks related to a poor choice of benchmark. Meanwhile, it does not allow the separation of the performance of the market in which the portfolio is invested from that of the manager. The information ratio is a more general form of the Sharpe ratio in which the risk-free asset is replaced by a <b>benchmark</b> <b>portfolio.</b> This measure is relative, as it evaluates portfolio performance in reference to a benchmark, making the result strongly dependent on this benchmark choice.|$|E

40|$|Despite a {{great deal}} of {{interest}} by institutional investors and others in the issue of corporate governance, there is surprisingly little empirical evidence linking governance practices with firm performance. This dissertation examines the link between corporate governance practices and firm performance, acknowledging the endogenous nature of the relationship. I begin by defining corporate governance as a set of constraints and incentives on managers and shareholders bargaining to determine how the value of the firm will be allocated. In chapter one, I examine an unbalanced panel of 1, 721 firms from 1980 to 1995, which includes each firm's charter and bylaw provisions, existence of a poison pill, applicable state anti-takeover laws, and board composition data, combined with financial data from CRSP and Compustat. This chapter provides the stylized facts about corporate governance today and details how governance practices have evolved over time. It also provides an explanation as to why shareholders would be willing to adopt governance provisions that have the potential to constrain their future allocations of firm value. I document that firms adopting governance provisions requiring shareholder approval tend to out perform <b>benchmark</b> <b>portfolios</b> prior to adoption and firms adopting poison pills under perform <b>benchmark</b> <b>portfolios</b> prior to adoption. I find that firms tend to under-perform <b>benchmark</b> <b>portfolios</b> following the adoption of governance provisions that are potentially harmful to shareholders. I find no relationship between CEO age, tenure, or compensation surrounding governance changes. In chapter two, I investigate the relationship between corporate governance practices and firm performance by examining firms where the constraints imposed by the governance system {{are most likely to be}} binding, i. e., firms that have experienced significant declines in quarterly operating performance. My results suggest that firms covered by fair price charter amendments and/or state control share acquisition statutes take longer to recover from declines in operating performance. I also examine firms with significant negative shocks in quarterly earnings, and find the persistence of these shocks is greater in firms covered by a freeze out statute and the persistence is lower in firms covered by cash out statutes, findings consistent with some governance features constraining shareholder value...|$|R
