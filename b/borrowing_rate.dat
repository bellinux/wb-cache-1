500|$|The FairTax {{would be}} tax free on {{mortgage}} interest {{up to the}} federal <b>borrowing</b> <b>rate</b> for like-term instruments {{as determined by the}} Treasury, but since savings, education, and other investments would be tax free under the plan, the FairTax could decrease the incentive to spend more on homes. [...] An analysis in 2008 by the Baker Institute For Public Policy concluded that the FairTax would have significant transitional issues for the housing sector since the investment would no longer be tax-favored. In a 2007 study, the Beacon Hill Institute concluded that total charitable giving would increase under the FairTax, although increases in giving would not be distributed proportionately amongst the various types of charitable organizations. The FairTax may also affect state and local government debt as the federal income tax system provides tax advantages to municipal bonds. Proponents believe environmental benefits would result from the FairTax through environmental economics and the re-use and re-sale of used goods. Advocates argue the FairTax would provide an incentive for illegal immigrants to legalize as they would otherwise not receive the rebate. Proponents also believe that the FairTax would have positive effects on civil liberties that are sometimes charged against the income tax system, such as social inequality, economic inequality, financial privacy, self-incrimination, unreasonable search and seizure, burden of proof, and due process.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{the possibility of}} a systemic banking crisis as a result of debt defaults, putting this risk {{and its impact on the}} economy into recent historical context. It looks at the vulnerability of the personal and business sectors to increases in <b>borrowing</b> <b>rates,</b> and at the evidence for a risk related rise in <b>borrowing</b> <b>rates.</b> There is an investigation of the impacts from a significant rise in the spread between lending and <b>borrowing</b> <b>rates</b> for both producers and consumers. Such an increase in spreads might arise when banks wish to rebuild their capital after a crisis or reflect significant credit rationing. In either case they represent the immediate impacts of a crisis in the banking sector. It also investigates the impact on output of a permanent, regulation induced, rise in margins in the financial sector, taking into account the impacts of regulation on equity market valuations and on country specific risk premia. ...|$|R

50|$|Reverse Repo rate is {{the short}} term <b>borrowing</b> <b>rate</b> at which RBI borrows money from banks. The Reserve bank uses this tool when it feels {{there is too much}} money {{floating}} in the banking system. An increase in the reverse repo rate means that the banks will get a higher rate of interest from RBI. As a result, banks prefer to lend their money to RBI which is always safe instead of lending it others (people, companies etc.) which is always risky.|$|E
50|$|Because of {{the special}} status of most {{municipal}} bonds granted under Section 103 of the Internal Revenue Code, which provides that the interest on such bonds is exempt from gross income, investors usually accept lower interest payments than on other types of borrowing (assuming comparable risk).

5000|$|Key risk {{indicators}} became {{highly volatile}} during September 2008, a factor leading the U.S. government {{to pass the}} Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. The “TED spread” {{is a measure of}} credit risk for inter-bank lending. It is the difference between: 1) the risk-free three-month U.S. treasury bill (t-bill) rate; and 2) the three-month London Interbank <b>Borrowing</b> <b>Rate</b> (LIBOR), which represents the rate at which banks typically lend to each other. A higher spread indicates banks perceive each other as riskier counterparties. The t-bill is considered [...] "risk-free" [...] because the full faith and credit of the U.S. government is behind it; theoretically, the government could just print money so investors get their money back at the maturity date of the t-bill.|$|E
5000|$|The {{present value}} of the minimum lease {{payments}} (MLP) is {{equal to or greater}} than 90% of the fair market value of leased property. To understand and apply this criterion, you need familiarize yourself with what is included in the minimum lease payments and how the present value is calculated. The minimum lease payments include the minimum rental payments minus any executory cost, the guaranteed residual value, the bargain purchase option, and any penalty for failure to renew or extend the lease. The amount calculated is then discounted using the lessee’s incremental <b>borrowing</b> <b>rate.</b> However, if the lessee knows the implicit rate used by the lessor and the rate is less than the lessee’s rate, the lessee should use the lessor’s rate to discount the minimum lease payment.|$|E
