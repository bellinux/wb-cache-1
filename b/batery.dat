40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{feasibility}} of using inductive links for a vehicle application where wiring an electronic control unit (ECU) to the sensors or detectors become unfeasible or unpractical. The selected application is occupancy and belt detection in removable vehicle seats. Two ways of using inductive links are considered: 1) passive detection {{of the state of}} the seat detectors from a readout unit and 2) remote power transmission to a detection unit and subsequent data transmission by a wireless transceiver. Inductive links have been widely proposed for sensors placed in harsh or inaccessible environments, where wiring is unpractical. Usually, the sensor forms part of an LC resonant network. The resonant frequency is dependent on the quantity to be measured and is estimated from a coupled reader. We propose the use of inductive links for switch-type sensors. First, a comprehensive analysis for an arbitrary number of sensors is presented. Secondly, we show {{the feasibility of}} using inductive links for occupancy and belt detection in removable vehicle seats. The state (open or closed) of the related sensors was attained by first measuring the equivalent resistance of the readout inductor and then estimating its resonant frequency. Commercial ferrite-core coils were used to increase the detection distance. Experimental tests were carried out using an impedance analyzer connected to the readout coil and commercial seat detectors connected to the resonant network. The detection of the sensors¿ state was feasible at all tested distances, from 0. 5 cm up to 3 cm. The second proposed alternative consists on remote powering, via an inductive link, the electronic device where the seat detectors are connected. Resonant coupled coils were used in order to increase the powering distance range and the power efficiency. Working frequency was restricted to 150 kHz. Commercial small-size magnetic-core coils were selected and their resistance and quality factor over frequency measured. At the receiving network, a rectifier and a voltage regulator were required to provide a DC voltage supply to the autonomous sensor. Four type of voltage regulators were compared from the point of view of the system power efficiency. Both a theoretical analysis and experimental results are presented. Results showed that shunt regulators provide the best power efficiency over the other alternatives, which are linear series and switching buck and boost regulators. On the other hand boost regulators led to an unstable behavior of the system in most of the cases. The use of rechargeable batteries was also considered in order to increase the power efficiency. Achieved power efficiencies were around 40 %, 25 % and 10 % for coil distances of 1 cm, 1. 5 cm and 2 cm respectively. Experimental tests also showed that the autonomous sensor was properly powered up to coil distances of 2. 5 cm. Finally, different types of coils were assessed and the effect of metallic structures analyzed for the intended application. The final aim is, on the one hand, to increase the powering distance and, on the other hand, to minimize the influence of the metallic structures. Three different coil types, two with ferrite-core coils and one with an air-core coil were used. Numerical results showed that ferrite-core coils are less affected by the presence of metallic structures. Experimental results showed that the air-core coils provided a larger powering distance thanks to its much larger winding diameter. However, when approaching a metallic plate, the transferred power with the air-core coils to the load was insufficient for the intended application. On the other hand, ferrite-core coils barely noticed the presence of the metallic plate. As for the passive detection, the presence of a metallic plate below the primary air-core coil slightly affected the measured resistance values but detection for the four possible states of the seat detectors was still possible. Algunes aplicacions a l'entorn de l'automòbil no són possibles si no és mitjançant la connexió sense fils dels seus dispositius a causa que el cablejat és difícil o inviable. Alguns exemples els trobem en el monitoratge de sensors situats en parts rotatòries, com les rodes, o en elements extraïbles, com els seients. Els sistemes de monitoratge de la pressió de l'aire en les rodes (TPMS) són d'obligat compliment als EUA i ho seran en breu també als països membres de la UE per als vehicles de categories M 1 o N 1 aprovats a partir de l' 1 de novembre de 2012 o per als vehicles matriculats a partir de l' 1 de novembre de 2014. Actualment, els sistemes TPMS existents al mercat estan alimentats per piles. Amb tot, la vida útil exigida per a les <b>bateries</b> és d'uns 10 anys, esdevenint el seu ús un autèntic repte. Un altre element en contra de l'ús de <b>bateries</b> és la directiva 2006 / 66 /CE que limita el nombre màxim permès en els vehicles. D'altra banda, moltes furgonetes o mini furgonetes i vehicles familiars incorporen seients extraïbles amb l'objectiu d'aprofitar al màxim l'espai interior. Alguns models comercials incorporen en el seient extraïble el detector de cinturó de seguretat. Per evitar el cablejat, existeixen sistemes de detecció passiva mitjançant acoblament inductiu. A partir del present any 2012, una regulació de la agència nord-americana NHTSA requereix de l'ús de coixins de seguretat intel·ligents per minimitzar els riscos en nens. Aquests seients intel·ligents haurien de detectar si el passatger és un adult, una cadira infantil o si està lliure per evitar problemes ocorreguts en anterioritat amb els sistemes coixí de seguretat. Els sensors usats per a aquests coixins de seguretat intel·ligents requeririen d'energia per operar. Una opció per als seients extraïbles és la transmissió de potència via acoblament inductiu des del terra del xassís del vehicle fins al seient. També és possible usar l'acoblament inductiu per detectar l'estat de diversos sensors existents en els seients extraïbles mitjançant detecció passiva. Precisament, la detecció d'ocupació i de cinturó de seguretat en seients extraïbles ha estat seleccionada per aplicar la investigació present que consisteix, d'una banda, en el monitoratge de sensors de tipus commutat (dos possibles estats) via acoblament inductiu i, per una altra, en la transmissió mitjançant el mateix principi físic de la potència necessària per alimentar els sensors autònoms remots.

Suitable methods to efficiently capture and convert this unused energy into electricity may {{have an important role}} {{for the development of a}} broad range of applications, i. e. battery replacement in miniaturized devices, autonomous robots, or sensors operating in remote. Energy storage is a critical question to obtain a complete autonomous system. In the present work a new storage system based in electrochemical double layer capacitor has been developed and tested in field applications. It’s has been used into smart sensor network with an efficient Energy management. Sunlight is the major source of renewable energy, a lot of efforts have been devoted to study and improve the energy conversion from sunlight to electric power, also, light and thermal from human activities constitute another source of unused power. Related to kinetic, environmental vibrations and/or motions caused by wind, high waters, waves, industrial and traffic activities, have been identified among the major sources of unused power. These sources constitute ideal inputs for piezoelectric materials which have the ability to convert mechanical energy into electrical energy with high conversion efficiency. Textile materials are commonly used in large-area industrial, engineering, architectural, clothes and transport applications, where they are subjected to large amounts of motion, vibration, torsion and strain. Thus, textiles appear as optimum structures to implement piezoelectric systems for large-area scavenging, storage and transmission of electric energy.

The model {{was used to}} simulate the active material loading on <b>batery,</b> fuel cell and supercapacitor electrodes. The active layer was reconstructed by the deposition of 108 particles and by varying the interaction between particles. Instead of simulating each generated layers at macro scale, the renormalization group theory was applied to reduce {{the complexity of the}} system. It was shown, that the generated layers belong to the same universality class and can be normalized by a self-affine transformation. The non-linear scaling function, obtained at micro-scale, was incorporated into the macrohomogenious model to simulate the impact of ultra-low Pt loading on specific activity of fuel cells and of thickness of supercapacitors layers on volumetric capacitance. The analysis of experimental data and modeling results revealed that specific activity and volumetric capacitance increase at ultra-low loading, because the surface area in unit volume is not independent of the loading or the thickness. Finally a general relationship was given, which describes the evolution of volumetric surface area density of fuel cells, batteries and supercapacitor with loading, and can be used to build a bridge between microscale morphology and macroscopic simulation.

40|$|Ganaxolone {{is a new}} potencional {{antiepileptic}} drug, synthetic analog of allopregnanolone {{which is}} a metabolite of progesterone. Preclinical and clinical studies point out its anticonvulsive effect {{in the treatment of}} both partial and generalized seizures including refractory epilepsy. The aim of our research was to investigate changes in the motor performance of the immature rats after administration of ganaxolone. We also focused on the relation between motoric impairment and the age of the rats which correlates with the age of children. 90 immature rats of age 12, 18 and 25 days were tested. Rats were divided in three groups injected with doses of 20 mgGNX/kg or 40 mgGNX/kg and the control group. The tests for assessing motor performance were chosen with respect to the maturation of sensorimotor reflexes from the following <b>batery</b> of tests: righting test, bar holding test, wire mesh test, negative geotaxis test and open field test. There were no significant differences before and after injection of the drug and in comparison with the control group not even in comparison of classes of age. We have demonstrated that the dose of ganaxolone effective against epileptic seizures does not markedly affect the motoric performance of the immature rats. Powered by TCPDF (www. tcpdf. org...|$|E
40|$|A {{functional}} catechol-o-methyltransferase (COMT Val 158 / 108 Met) polymorphism, a valine (Val) to methionine (Met) substitution, {{has been}} associated with cognitive processing in the normal brain, older age, mild cognitive impairment and in various dementias. COMT is involved in the breakdown of dopamine and other catecholamines, especially in the frontal cortex; hence the carriers of Met allele, with the lower enzymatic activity, are expected to perform better on particular neuro-cognitive tests. The study included 46 patients with dementia and 65 healthy older subjects. The neurological status was assessed, using the Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE), and the <b>batery</b> of different neurological tests. In DNA samples COMT polymorphism was genotyped. Patients with dementia exhibited significant genotype-induced differences in scores for MMSE, Visual Association Test (VAT) duration of numbers test, VAT time of response to numbers test, VAT average response to numbers test and WPLCR/PPLR unanswered. Carriers of Met/Met genotype had significantly lower scores of MMSE, significantly longer time to respond to VAT duration of numbers test, VAT time of response to numbers test and VAT average response to numbers test, and significantly greater number of unanswered questions to WPLCR/PPLR when compared to Met/Val or Val/Val genotypes. Our preliminary data showed significantly impaired performance in several neuro-cognitive tests in carriers of Met/Met genotype in patients with dementia compared to either Met/Val or Val/Val genotype carriers. Although Met/Met genotype with more dopamine available in the frontal cortex should be associated with better neuro-cognitive test results than Met/Val or Val/Val genotype, our data on patients with dementia did not confirm this hypothesis. Further study on larger sample of patients is needed to clarify the role of COMT polymorphism in cognitive functions...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, biker like {{to spend}} their time with the nature such as visiting {{waterfall}} or camping in a jungle where the electric power is not available. This situation have made new technology to be developed such as powerbank and portable lamp. One of the new tachnology {{that have been developed}} is electrical portable water kettle. This device help people to boil the water without using fire as the heater. In this thesis, the portable DC water kettle suitable for motorcycle is designed, developed and tested. This device use 12 v, 5 a battery as it power supply which is directly connect to the source. The reason for choosing this type of battery is because it commonly use by the motorcycle in Malaysia. The kanthal 26 AWG is used as it heating element while the mechanical thermostate will sense the boiled water. The device has been tasted with different length of heating element which are 15 cm, 30 cm and 50 cm corrensponding to resistance value 2. 6 ohm, 5. 0 ohm and 8. 3 ohm respectively. The kanthal is connected to the thermostate by using copper wire. This device can boil 500 ml of water at one times. The device also equiped with autooff sensor to cut the power supply when the water reach at it boiling point. Experiment conducted shows that the most optimal condition is achieved when the device uses kanthal 26 AWG, with resistance is at 5. 0 ohm. With 500 ml water in the container, the device took about 25 minutes to reach boiling point while maintaining the motorcycle’s <b>batery</b> at healthy condition...|$|E
40|$|The {{expansion}} of basketball game, just like up-to-date sports results represent the stimulus for further fundamental researches in {{the aim of}} improvement scientific and methodological basis of a training work and all other factors connected to the improvement of a training process and top sports creativity. The research was conducted with the aim to determine the specifics of motor abilities in basketball players of the junior rank of competition. All the examinees were male, 16 (+/- 6 months) years old, 132 in total, {{all of them were}} basketball players of the basketball club ”Student” from Nis. The <b>batery</b> of tests for the evaluation of motor abilities included tests for the evaluation of coordination, strength (explosive, repetitive and static), flexibility and stamina and it consisted of 13 motor tests in total. The gained results were processed by the program system for multivariant analysis of data, especially made by Popovic D. for personal computers. The gained results are shown in tables and they give insight into the structure of latent dimensions of basketball players. The motor structure of basketball players is explained by 72. 3 % of common variance. From the matrix of intercorrelations, four main components were gained. The fist defines tests of static strength, flexibility and repetitive strength; the second is saturated by the test for the evaluation of explosive strength, balance and two tests for the evaluation of repetitive strength. The third is the best explained by the test for the evaluation of balance, flexibility and coordination. The fourth main component is defined by explosive strength. Then, the rotation of components into the oblimin solution is conducted and some better structure of latent dimensions is gained that way. In basketball and other popular sports games in our country, scientific and expert methods and possibilities of scientific fundation of the trainig work are very slowly but surely accepted. The trend of constant improvement and promotion of better competition results never stops. Taking into account that this research is limited to the space of motorics, we emphasize that for the achievement of success in basketball game, beside the examined space, it is also necessary to percieve other segments of anthropological status of players...|$|E
40|$|La Enfermedad o Mal de Parkinson (EP) fue descrita en 1817 y se caracteriza por ser un trastorno neurodegenerativo cuyos síntomas principales son de tipo motriz. Sin embargo, en años reciente ha crecido la evidencia de que también se presenta con disfunción cognitiva temprana. Se seleccionó una {{muestra de}} pacientes con Mal de Parkinson idiopático, atendidos en dos Servicios de Neurología de adultos, con no más de 4 años de evolución en su enfermedad y con criterios de inclusión que descartaran deterioro cognitivo por otras causas, para un estudio descriptivo de tipo transversal. Los pacientes se clasificaron según los tipos Rígido y Tembloroso y el estadio funcional. Ambos grupos fueron sometidos a escalas de clasificación funcional (UPDRS, Hoehn y Yars) y una batería de pruebas neuropsicológicas (Mini Mental Parkinson, Signoret, Stroop, Trail Making Test, Frontal Assessment Battery, Syndrom Kurztest, Figura Compleja de Rey). Se encontró un deterioro específico de la memoria episódica inmediata, un gran efecto Stroop, facultades ejecutivas y visuoespaciales normales bajas y un "trastorno mental orgánico leve" en ambos grupos, sin diferencias estadísticas significativas entre ambos. No se encontró relación con el estadio funcional pero sí {{con el tiempo}} de evolución, en la prueba Trail Making parte A. Llama la atención el compromiso temprano de la memoria episódica, sin compromiso de las facultades ejecutivas y visuoespaciales, aunque con esa tendencia. The Parkinson disease (PD) was {{described}} in 1817 and it characterizes for showing neurodegenerative disorder with tremor, slow movements, rigidity and progressive difficulty for keeping posture and balance. More severe cognitive dysfunctions {{have been reported in}} PD patients who exhibited tremor {{at the onset of the}} illness in contrast with those of the acinetic/rigid subgroup; however, this point has not been cleared up yet. With the aim of studying the cognitive state of PD patients, a sample of PD idiopatic individuals was selected. The inclusion criteria which they had to comply with included an evolution of the disease inferior to 4 years and no cognitive damage for various causes. A battery of neuropsychological tests was used (Minimental Parkinson, Signoret, Stroop, Trail Making Test, Frontal Assessment <b>Batery,</b> Syndrom Kurztest Complex Figure of Rey), and some scale to classify patients as Rigid or Trembling were utilized (UPDRS, Hoehn & Yars). Considering also their functional status both groups presented a specific episodic immediate memory failure, worse in Trembling, a great Stroop effect, normal visuospatial and executive faculties and "Slight indication of organic mental disorder" (Syndrom Kurztest), without significant differences between them. No relationship was found between the functional stage, and the cognitive functions except for the A part of the Trail Making Test which proved a difference through the years. The early episodic memory deterioration founded without executive and visuospatial functions failure, although with that tendency, is remarkable...|$|E
40|$|O teste de fluência verbal fonémica é largamente utilizado tanto em contexto clínico como de investigação. Devido às suas especificidades e por possibilitar uma avaliação alargada do funcionamento cognitivo parece ser útil para discriminar entre a existência e a ausência de défice cognitivo. Em Portugal, o conjunto {{de letras}} utilizadas na aplicação do teste de fluência verbal fonémica é o conjunto M, P e R, no entanto parece não estar claro se é esse o conjunto de letras com melhor poder discriminatório entre a existência e a ausência de um défice cognitivo. Assim os principais objetivos foram apurar quais as letras predominantes na língua portuguesa através da aplicação do teste de fluência verbal fonémica com todas as letras do alfabeto, analisar a relação entre o total de palavras no teste de fluência verbal fonémica e as variáveis sociodemográficas e obter um conjunto de letras com melhor poder discriminatório para distinguir entre a existência e a ausência de défice cognitivo. A amostra foi composta por 66 sujeitos (idade: M = 63, 12; DP = 17, 88; 59, 1 % mulheres), divididos em dois subgrupos com base nas pontuações do Mini-Mental State Examination e da Frontal Assessment <b>Batery,</b> ficando 33 sujeitos no grupo com défice cognitivo e 33 sujeitos sem défice. O conjunto de letras predominantes ao nível da língua portuguesa foi o P, C e M. Verificou-se a existência de uma correlação significativa entre o total de palavras e a idade (p < 0, 01) e também a existência de uma correlação significativa entre o total de palavras e a escolaridade (p < 0, 01). Não se verificou correlação entre o total de palavras e o sexo (p = 0, 34). Apurou-se o conjunto de letras Q, T e P como o conjunto que melhor discrimina entre existência e ausência de défice cognitivo. As letras Q, T e P apresentam-se como promissoras para discriminar entre a existência e a ausência de défice cognitivo. Revela-se importante replicar este estudo com uma amostra clínica maior e mais jovem. [Phonemic verbal fluency test {{is widely used}} in {{clinical}} context {{as well as in}} investigation. Regarding its specificities and due to the possibility to evaluate a large scale of cognitive abilities {{it seems to be a}} useful instrument to discriminate between cognitive impairment and healthy subjects. In Portugal, phonemic verbal fluency test is presently applied with the letters M, P and R. However, it is not clear if these letters are the letters which can discriminate most between cognitive impairment and healthy subjects. In this sense, the aim of this study is to determine which letters are the predominate letters in the Portuguese language, through the application of the phonemic verbal fluency test with all the letters of the alphabet, to analyse the relation between the total of words in the phonemic verbal fluency test and sociodemographic variables like gender, age and education and to obtain a set of letters with high discriminatory power to distinguish between existence and absence of cognitive impairment. This study included 66 subjects (age: M = 63, 12; DP = 17, 88; 59, 1 % women), which were divided into two subgroups based on the results of Mini-Mental State Examination and Frontal Assessment Battery. This way, we obtain one subgroup of 33 subjects with cognitive impairment and another subgroup of 33 healthy subjects. It was found that the set of predominant letters for the Portuguese language was the set P, C and M. Significant correlation was found between the total of words in phonemic verbal fluency test and age and level of education. No significant correlation was found between the total of words in phonemic verbal fluency test and sex. The set of letters Q, T and P was identified as the set that best discriminates between existence and absence of cognitive impairment. The letters Q, T and P seem to be promising to discriminate between the existence and absence of cognitive impairment. It appears to be important to replicate this study with a larger and younger clinical sample. ...|$|E
