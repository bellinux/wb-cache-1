40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the development of}} spontaneous gratings arising in light-sensitive waveguide AgCl–Ag films on glass substrates at various cases of linear polarization of the single inducing laser beam. The cause of such a grating development is the appearance of an interference field created by the summation of the incident beam and scattered waveguide TE- and TM-modes. Positive feedback in grating growth is provided by Wood’s anomalies taking place for all the gratings, and the simultaneous development of many microgratings results in their competition. Earlier we found that two-dimensional <b>Bragg’s</b> <b>diffraction</b> seriously affects this competition. This kind of diffraction results in the appearance of secondary dominant gratings. Now we found that at the beam’s polarization, deviated from P-polarization, the appearance of tertiary gratings becomes possible due to the <b>Bragg’s</b> <b>diffraction</b> on secondary dominant gratings instead of this diffraction on primary gratings. The influence {{of the existence of}} the first and second steps in two-dimensional diffraction on grating growth is proved by both optical microscopy and complete identification of the modes excited in the substrate and in air (radiative modes in small-angle scattering pattern) ...|$|R

2500|$|<b>Bragg</b> <b>diffraction</b> (also {{referred}} to as the Bragg formulation of X-ray diffraction) was first proposed by William Lawrence Bragg and his father William Henry Bragg in 1913 in response to their discovery that crystalline solids produced surprising patterns of reflected X-rays (in contrast to that of, say, a liquid). [...] They found that these crystals, at certain specific wavelengths and incident angles, produced intense peaks of reflected radiation. The concept of <b>Bragg</b> <b>diffraction</b> applies equally to neutron diffraction and electron diffraction processes. Both neutron and X-ray wavelengths are comparable with inter-atomic distances (~150pm) and thus are an excellent probe for this length scale.|$|E
2500|$|A similar process occurs upon {{scattering}} neutron {{waves from}} the nuclei or by a coherent spin interaction with an unpaired electron.

2500|$|<b>Bragg</b> <b>diffraction</b> may {{be carried}} out using either light of very short {{wavelength}} like X-rays or matter waves like neutrons (and electrons) whose wavelength is {{on the order of}} (or much smaller than) the atomic spacing. The pattern produced gives information of the separations of crystallographic planes d, allowing one to deduce the crystal structure. [...] Diffraction contrast, in electron microscopes and x-topography devices in particular, is also a powerful tool for examining individual defects and local strain fields in crystals.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Bragg</b> <b>diffraction</b> {{occurs when}} radiation, with {{wavelength}} comparable to atomic spacings, is scattered in a specular fashion by the atoms of a crystalline system, and undergoes constructive interference. For a crystalline solid, the waves are scattered from lattice planes separated by the interplanar distance d. [...] When the scattered waves interfere constructively, they remain in phase since {{the difference between}} the path lengths of the two waves is equal to an integer multiple of the wavelength. [...] The path difference between two waves undergoing interference is given by 2dsinθ, where θ is the scattering angle (see figure on the right). [...] The effect of the constructive or destructive interference intensifies because of the cumulative effect of reflection in successive crystallographic planes of the crystalline lattice (as described by Miller notation). This leads to Bragg's law, which describes the condition on θ for the constructive interference to be at its strongest: ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{limitation}} to a {{blazed grating}} is {{the width of}} the mirrors, which can only be ground a finite amount before focus is lost; the maximum is around 1000 lines/mm. In order to overcome this limitation holographic gratings were developed. [...] Volume phase holographic gratings use a thin film of dichromated gelatin on a glass surface, which is subsequently exposed to a wave pattern created by an interferometer. This wave pattern sets up a reflection pattern similar to the blazed gratings but utilizing <b>Bragg</b> <b>diffraction,</b> a process where the angle of reflection is dependent on the arrangement of the atoms in the gelatin. The holographic gratings can have up to 6000 lines/mm and can be up to twice as efficient in collecting light as blazed gratings. Because they are sealed between two sheets of glass, the holographic gratings are very versatile, potentially lasting decades before needing replacement.|$|E
