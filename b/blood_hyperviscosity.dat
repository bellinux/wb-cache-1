The at-risk group was balanced with the acute stroke group for types of risk factors and medication usage, and all four groups were balanced for age. The viscosity of whole blood at low rates of shear and the plasma viscosity were significantly elevated in both groups with cerebrovascular symptoms and in the at-risk group compared with the healthy controls.

In addition, the relationship between the hematocrit and the logarithm of blood viscosity tended to be linear at any given protein concentration. In patients with very high levels of paraprotein the blood viscosity was modified by low hematocrits; the latter was below 30 in 70 % of patients in whom the concentration of paraprotein was above 4 g/ 100 ml.

Of the two main types of RVO, branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) is 4 to 6 times more prevalent than central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO). A basic risk factor for RVO is advancing age. Further risk factors include systemic conditions like hypertension, arteriosclerosis, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, vascular cerebral stroke, <b>blood</b> <b>hyperviscosity,</b> and thrombophilia. A strong risk factor for RVO is the metabolic syndrome (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia).

Therefore, in a patient with acquired erythrocytosis, it is reasonable to begin the diagnostic work-up with JAK 2 mutation analysis to distinguish PV from secondary erythrocytosis.

Aims: This issue in the series seeks to determine the association and correlation between whole blood viscosity and {{white blood cell count}} (WBCC), with a view to advance the cause of a neglected clinical pathology index. Materials & Methods: Based on archived clinical pathology data, 10, 857 cases that were concomitantly tested for full blood count and total proteins in the 2008 calendar year were audited for hyperleucocytosis. Whole blood viscosity level was determined and compared in the group with leucocytosis relative to the group with leucopenia and normal WBCC. The confounding effects of age, gender and red blood cell indices were evaluated. The correlation between whole blood viscosity and WBCC was also determined. Results: As a generalization, hypoviscosity is observed among individuals who presented hyperleucocytosis. There is no correlation (r = 0. 20) between leucocytosis and blood viscosity. Conclusion: It is known that anaemia and thromboembolism, which can be associated with leucocytosis, predispose to hypoviscosity. The finding from this study provides evidence of association between hypoviscosity and leucocytosis. The absence of association and insignificant correlation between leucocytosis and hyperviscosity may be one explanation for ineffectiveness of therapeutic leukapheresis. Further, the non-correlation lends credence to specificity of blood viscosity, for which critical leucocytosis is not a substitute...|$|E

Male Wistar rats were divided in 5 groups receiving different doses of rHuEPO (100, 200, 400 and 600 IU/kg body weight (BW) /week) and saline solution (control), during 3 weeks. Blood and 24 h urine were collected to perform hematological and biochemical analysis. BP was measured by the tail-cuff method. Kidney tissue was collected to mRNA and protein expression assays and to characterize renal lesions. A dose-dependent increase in red blood cells count, hematocrit and hemoglobin levels was found with rHuEPO therapy, in rHuEPO 200, rHuEPO 400 and rHuEPO 600 groups. Increased reticulocyte count was found in rHuEPO 400 and rHuEPO 600 groups. BP raised in all groups receiving rHuEPO.

We evaluated the activation status of vascular cells in 18 consecutive ET and 14 PV patients by measuring the plasma levels of the nitric oxide derivatives (NOX) (i. e. nitrites and nitrates) and of soluble selectins of platelet (P-selectin), endothelial cell (P-selectin and E-selectin) and leukocyte (L-selectin) origin. The effect of hydroxyurea (HU) therapy on these parameters was also investigated. NOX were significantly (p< 0. 01) increased in ET patients treated with HU (11. 5 +/- 2. 6 nM) compared to non-HU treated ET (1. 41 +/- 0. 3 nM) and to controls (4. 78 +/- 2. 49 nM). Multivariate analysis confirmed HU therapy as an independent predictor of higher NOX levels in ET. In addition, NOX significantly correlated with haematocrit. Plasma P-selectin was significantly elevated in ET (350 +/- 40 ng/ 10 (6) platelets) and PV (482 +/- 53 ng/ 10 (6) platelets) patients compared to controls (120 +/- 8 ng/ 10 (6) platelets). In PV, also E-selectin (23. 8 +/- 4. 2 ng/ml) was significantly increased compared to controls (11. 2 +/- 1. 1 ng/ml; p< 0. 01). P-selectin was significantly correlated to platelet (R= 0. 33; p= 0. 01) and leukocyte count (R= 0. 6; p= 0. 000), while E-selectin (R= 0. 34; p=. 014) and sL-selectin (R= 0. 3; p= 0. 03) were correlated with leukocyte count only.

40|$|Hypoalbuminemia causes {{high blood}} {{viscosity}} by increasing red cell lysophosphatidylcholine. Albumin deficiency {{is accompanied by}} a reduction in red cell deformability and <b>blood</b> <b>hyperviscosity.</b> Albumin deficiency increases plasma fibrinogen and triglyceride levels and may alter red cell membrane lipid composition. These options, which could all contribute to reduced red cell deformability (RCD) and hyperviscosity, were studied in the Nagase analbuminemic rat (NAR), a mutant Sprague Dawley rat (CON), characterized by normal total protein levels, with an absolute deficiency of albumin, but elevated levels of non-albumin proteins and hyperlipidemia. Plasma protein-binding of the polar phopholipid lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) was markedly decreased. LPC comprised only 26 ± 1 % of total plasma phospholipids as compared to 42 ± 2 % in CON. NAR red cells in CON plasma had a viscosity that was similar to CON red cells in CON plasma. Conversely, CON red cells in NAR plasma show an increased viscosity as compared to CON red cells in CON plasma. The maximum deformation index of both NAR and CON red cells was markedly decreased in NAR plasma as compared to either NAR or CON cells in CON plasma (0. 04 ± 0. 03 and 0. 02 ± 0. 02 vs. 0. 22 ± 0. 06 and 0. 15 ± 0. 04, respectively; P < 0. 05). Thus, plasma composition causes hyperviscosity and reduced RCD in NAR. Fibrinogen is not responsible since red cells in serum and red cells in plasma had a similar viscosity and differences in viscosity and RCD between NAR and CON were maintained. Plasma triglycerides are also not responsible since the viscosity of red cells in serum with a 50 % reduction in triglycerides was not reduced. LPC levels in red cells were increased in NAR (8. 7 ± 0. 2 vs. 5. 5 ± 0. 3 % of total phospholipids; P < 0. 01). Adding albumin to NAR blood dose-dependently decreased whole blood viscosity, despite marked increases in plasma viscosity, and increased RCD of NAR cells (from 0. 04 ± 0. 03 to 0. 21 ± 0. 01; P < 0. 05). There was also some effect on CON RCD of similar albumin addition to CON blood (from 0. 15 ± 0. 04 to 0. 29 ± 0. 03; P < 0. 05). Adding albumin to NAR blood reduced red cell LPC content and increased plasma LPC content in a dose-dependent fashion, whereas there were only slight effects of adding albumin to CON blood. There was a reciprocal relation between red cell LPC and the other polar phospholipids in the red cell membrane, probably indicating exchange. The maximum deformability index of either NAR or CON cells was not affected much by adding LPC to CON plasma (NAR, from 0. 22 ± 0. 06 to 0. 18 ± 0. 10; CON, from 0. 15 ± 0. 04 to 0. 12 ± 0. 05; NS), whereas adding LPC to NAR plasma caused the red cells to become rigid. Adding LPC to CON red cells in NAR plasma caused a much stronger increase in relative LPC content (from 6. 6 ± 0. 7 to 10. 9 ± 0. 9 % P < 0. 05) than adding LPC to CON red cells in CON plasma (from 5. 6 ± 0. 4 to 6. 4 ± 0. 8 % NS). Thus, in the absence of albumin, LPC in red blood cells is increased. As a consequence of the latter, RCD is decreased and whole blood viscosity increased. Alterations in red cell phospholipids are far more important than increases in plasma fibrinogen or triglycerides in determining hyperviscosity of blood and reduced RCD in NAR...|$|E
