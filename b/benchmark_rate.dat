40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} {{understand}} how interest rates are formed in Lebanon, {{by focusing on the}} pass-through from <b>benchmark</b> <b>rates,</b> prevailing liquidity conditions, and the main characteristics of the Lebanese economy, notably its open capital account, fixed exchange rate, high government borrowing requirement, large public debt, and high degree of deposit dollarization. We find that international interest rates are an important element in the determination of interest rates in Lebanon. In particular, the pass-through of global <b>benchmark</b> <b>rates</b> to interest rates on sovereign bonds is about 70 percent. The less-than-complete pass-through could be attributed to a home-bias effect reflecting a relatively stable and dedicated investor base. The study also shows that interest rates in Lebanon are affected by liquidity conditions as well as perceived sovereign risk.

50|$|Efficient {{functioning}} of the markets for such instruments relies on well-established and stable reference rates. The <b>benchmark</b> <b>rate</b> used to price many US financial securities is the three-month US dollar Libor rate. Up until the mid-1980s, the Treasury bill rate was the leading reference rate. However, it eventually lost its benchmark status to Libor due to pricing volatility caused by periodic, large swings in the supply of bills. In general, offshore reference rates such as the US dollar Libor rate are preferred to onshore benchmarks since the former {{are less likely to}} be distorted by government regulations such as capital controls and deposit insurance.|$|E
5000|$|The Bank's main {{priority}} {{has been}} to keep inflation at a moderate level. As part of that strategy, interest rates were kept at a low level for almost seven years. Since September 2010, the key interest rate (overnight rate) was 0.5%. In mid 2017, inflation remained below the Bank's 2% target, (at 1.6%) mostly because of reductions {{in the cost of}} energy, food and automobiles; as well, the economy was in a continuing spurt with a predicted GDP growth of 2.8 percent by year end. Early on 12 July 2017, the bank issued a statement that the <b>benchmark</b> <b>rate</b> would be increased to 0.75%. [...] "The economy can handle very well this move we have today and of course you need to preface that with an acknowledgment that of course interest rates are still very low," [...] Governor Stephen Poloz subsequently said. In its press release, the bank had confirmed that the rate would continue to be evaluated at least partly on the basis of inflation. [...] "Future adjustments to the target for the overnight rate will be guided by incoming data as they inform the bank's inflation outlook, keeping in mind continued uncertainty and financial system vulnerabilities." [...] Poloz refused to speculate {{on the future of the}} economy but said, [...] "I don't doubt that interest rates will move higher, but there's no predetermined path in mind at this stage".|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{a method for}} {{determining}} benchmark rates for the excess of loss reinsurance of a Motor Third Party Liability insurance portfolio will be developed based on observed market rates. The benchmark rates are expressed {{as a percentage of}} the expected premium income that is available to cover the whole risk of the portfolio. The rates are assumed to be based on a compound process with a heavy tailed severity, such as Burr or Pareto distributions. In the absence of claim data these assumptions propagate the theoretical <b>benchmark</b> <b>rate</b> component of the regression model. Given the whole set of excess of loss reinsurance rates in a given market, the unknown parameters are estimated within the framework of quasi-likelihood estimation. This framework makes it possible to select a theoretical <b>benchmark</b> <b>rate</b> model and to choose a parsimonious submodel for describing the observed market rates over a 4 -years observation period.

40|$|This paper uses {{data of the}} Turkish banking {{sector to}} {{investigate}} whether the {{stance of monetary policy}} has an impact on the level of risk of individual bank loans. Using bank level quarterly data over the period 2003 q 1 - 2012 q 3 a dynamic panel data model is estimated. There is a positive relationship between the changes in short-term interest rates and banks risk taking. This result reflects that a decrease in short term interest rates has a positive impact on the loan portfolio via outstanding loans. However, negative relationship was found between the interest rate falling below <b>benchmark</b> <b>rate</b> and the risk taking by banks. The magnitude of this effect decreases in the large scale and high liquidity level of the banks. According to these results, it was concluded that low interest rates in Turkish banking system affects risk taking of the banks in the period of 2003 q 1 - 2012 q 3.

30|$|Another {{important}} distinction between short- and long-run closures {{relates to the}} treatment of the supply side of regional industry capital markets. In short-run closure, capital stock is fixed, while, in the long-run, policy changes can affect the capital stock. In the long-run, industry “re-location” becomes relevant since factors of production are assumed to be free to move among the regions. Investment decisions define the marginal re-location of activities, guiding the spatial distribution of capital stocks. Regional industry capital stocks adjust to move regional industry rates of return to the exogenously determined <b>benchmark</b> <b>rate</b> of return.
