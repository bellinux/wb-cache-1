40|$|International audienceThis paper {{contributes}} to the quest for an operational definition of <b>begging.</b> Researchers and policy makers examining <b>begging</b> suffer from definitional shortcomings. Social scientists generally provide a minimalistic and paradoxical definition of <b>begging.</b> <b>Begging</b> is indeed, simultaneously considered as a productive activity and as a non-reciprocated gift. Among law and policy makers, {{there is no consensus}} on a definition of <b>begging.</b> <b>Begging</b> can be defined broadly or narrowly, it can be considered as acceptable or be criminalized. In order to illustrate the need for an operational definition, the legal definitions of <b>begging</b> enacted in India, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and Philippines are compared. Major theoretical definitions of <b>begging</b> are also reviewed. We then suggest an operational definition of <b>begging</b> in which we distinguish between <b>begging</b> policies, <b>begging</b> strategies and <b>begging</b> techniques...|$|R
40|$|Nestling <b>begging</b> {{behavior}} is usually {{characterized by a}} behavioral response of increasing <b>begging</b> levels {{with an increase in}} nestling need or hunger. Recent evidence for the possible effect of learning on <b>begging</b> intensity raises the question of how learning can shape this response rule. In particular, {{it is not clear whether}} hungry nestlings can learn to reduce their <b>begging</b> when it is not successful or, rather, whether they must first acquire positive experiences with low <b>begging</b> levels in order to do so. To explore this question, we conducted 3 hand-feeding experiments with pairs of house sparrow (Passer domesticus) nestlings. In the first 2 experiments, the nestlings targeted to lower their <b>begging</b> were rewarded mainly or only for low <b>begging</b> postures. However, despite the high expected reward for low <b>begging,</b> these nestlings did not lower their <b>begging.</b> Controlled by their behavioral response function, hungry nestlings were "stuck" at high postures without being able to experience the potential success of low postures. In the third experiment, nestlings targeted to lower their <b>begging</b> levels were rewarded for any <b>begging</b> posture, ensuring that satiation would provide their initial "positive experience" with low <b>begging</b> postures. <b>Begging</b> postures were reduced by this treatment. In light of these results, we suggest that parents are unlikely to reduce offspring <b>begging</b> levels by simply ignoring them. However, they might be able to do so by attending to the <b>begging</b> as soon as possible, thereby allowing their offspring to explore low <b>begging</b> and learn that it is sufficiently effective.

40|$|<b>Begging</b> {{by young}} provokes adults to provide food for them. However, {{eventually}} <b>begging</b> by young and provisioning by adults cease and young become nutritionally independent. Why do young cease <b>begging</b> and so forgo food brought {{to them by}} adults? Three explanations have been proposed: (1) adults may not respond to <b>begging</b> anymore and cease feeding <b>begging</b> young: (2) young may voluntarily switch from <b>begging</b> to independent foraging as they gain more rewards from this: (3) young may become unable to produce stimulating <b>begging</b> calls. We tested the three explanations using meerkat, Suricata suricatta, pups. Playback of <b>begging</b> calls at groups where <b>begging</b> had naturally ceased provoked adults to resume provisioning, suggesting that adults had not stopped responding to <b>begging.</b> Experimental provision of food to pups mimicking either natural pup feeding or foraging success produced no differences in subsequent changes in <b>begging</b> or foraging behaviour, suggesting that pups were not assessing the most rewarding means of obtaining food and switching from <b>begging</b> to foraging accordingly. The <b>begging</b> calls of pups (aged 40 - 60 days) were acoustically different to those produced when they were juveniles (aged 100 - 120 days), and adults discriminated between rate-controlled playbacks of the two age classes of calls, delivering less food calls of a juvenile than to the same individual’s calls recorded when a pup. Adult meerkats {{paid attention to the}} acoustic structure of <b>begging</b> calls, and ceased provisioning when the call structure changed.

40|$|Offspring solicit food {{to their}} parents by <b>begging</b> displays, which are {{important}} in the parent [...] offspring communication. Most theoretical approximations on this behavior have centered on the view of <b>begging</b> as an honest signal of need or {{as a form of}} scramble competition for resources. In both signaling models, costly <b>begging</b> is necessary to stabilize the <b>begging</b> strategy at equilibrium. Nevertheless, evidence supporting <b>begging</b> as costly behavior remains scarce. We investigated whether oxidative stress may represent a general form of proximate cost of <b>begging</b> and also whether <b>begging</b> is related to offspring nutritional condition. To test this, we experimentally modified the chicks' nutritional condition and vitamin E availability and measured the effects on different <b>begging</b> components. The intensity of all <b>begging</b> components increased in chicks that were intake restricted, whereas vitamin E specifically enhance the total number of chatter calls given by chicks, mainly in those with a lower body size. Our results suggest that <b>begging</b> behavior is an antioxidant demanding activity and support the idea that oxidative stress may be a cost of <b>begging.</b> Our findings also suggest that <b>begging</b> behavior may be an honest signal of the nutritional and oxidative status of the chicks.

50|$|The {{black-headed gull}} (Larus ridibundus) is a semi-altricial bird with a brood size {{of one to}} three siblings. When a parent returns to the nest, its chicks {{recognize}} its calls and start <b>begging</b> before the adult lands; <b>begging</b> behaviour is also exhibited when the parent is in the nest. Parents respond to the total solicitation emerging from the nest; therefore, the probability of getting food increases {{with the number of}} chicks <b>begging</b> together. The more siblings there are, the more they coordinate their <b>begging</b> while decreasing the number of individual <b>begging</b> bouts. In this way, intra-brood synchronization of <b>begging</b> enables chicks to reduce their effort in <b>begging.</b>|$|R

50|$|While the {{ultimate}} causation for <b>begging</b> {{is an increase}} in the animal's individual fitness, several theories have been proposed for how food <b>begging</b> evolved proximate causes including scramble competition, honest signalling of need, and cooperative <b>begging</b> by siblings. Various types of information such as nutritional status or immunocompetence can be transmitted with auditory and visual <b>begging</b> signals and the behavior can be modulated by several factors such as brood size and hormones. Similarly, several costs of <b>begging</b> have been investigated including energetic, growth and predation cost. <b>Begging</b> from humans also occurs under artificial circumstances such as donkeys, elephants and dolphins <b>begging</b> for food from tourists.|$|R

40|$|<b>Begging</b> {{signals and}} {{endogenous}} testosterone (T) levels of young birds {{have been shown}} to be positively correlated. If T is causally involved in controlling the level of <b>begging</b> effort, an endocrine control mechanism could explain the evolution of <b>begging</b> as a costly signal reflecting need. We tested experimentally whether elevated circulating T levels enhanced <b>begging</b> behaviour in nestling pied flycatchers, Ficedula hypoleuca. A pilot study confirmed that nestling T levels could be elevated within a natural physiological range using an oral dose of T. After T-dosing, nestling <b>begging</b> behaviour was measured as: i) the duration of <b>begging</b> displays and ii) the maximum height of <b>begging</b> stretches. Our results show that nestling T levels were elevated at 90 min post dosing and that at this time point both measures of <b>begging</b> behaviour were performed more intensely by T-dosed nestlings than controls. Nestling <b>begging</b> displays in response to dosing varied between individuals, which in part was explained either by the date in the breeding season or nestling mass.

40|$|Elaborate {{solicitation}} displays are {{a common}} feature of interactions between care-givers and offspring. These displays are interpreted as the phenotypic expression of the conflict of interests between parents and offspring over parental investment. Offspring typically have siblings and thus do not exist in isolation. Therefore, they may adjust their <b>begging</b> in response to their siblings' <b>begging,</b> either competitively or cooperatively. Alternatively, <b>begging</b> may be independent of the <b>begging</b> efforts of siblings. Studies of avian <b>begging</b> have primarily focused on nestlings, where offspring are immobile and compete directly over the allocation of parental resources. We investigated the influence sibling <b>begging</b> had on individual fledgling <b>begging</b> in the cooperatively breeding pied babbler, Turdoides bicolor. Using experimental manipulations, we found that fledgling <b>begging</b> behaviour was negatively correlated with satiation and unrelated to the <b>begging</b> effort of siblings. Pied babbler care-givers were able to target increased provisioning to individuals with artificially increased demand while maintaining provisioning rates {{to the rest of}} the brood. Thus, fledglings were found to incur no provisioning costs or benefits from either increased or decreased <b>begging</b> by their siblings. We propose that the combination of targeted provisioning, flexible levels of provisioning and the dispersed nature of fledglings reduces the benefits of competitive or cooperative <b>begging</b> in this species. 9 page(s...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between <b>begging</b> behaviour, chick nutritional state, and parental distribution of food within broods was studied in 4 - and 5 -chick magpie Pica pica broods under natural conditions.

Daily growth during the preceding day, as well as average cumulative food intake by the brood during the preceding 24 h, seemed not to affect <b>begging</b> in a similar way. <b>Begging</b> signals employed by hungrier nestlings involved a higher degree of muscular activity, thus supporting the prediction that nestlings in greater need should employ more costly signals.
