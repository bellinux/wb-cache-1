40|$|The study {{analyzes}} {{the performances of}} built-up columns made of FRP (fiber reinforced polymer) profiles connected by steel bolts. The research aims specifically at verifying {{the influence of the}} shear deformability as well as the local effect after collapse at the bolted connections. The analyzed case regards a <b>built-up</b> <b>column</b> made of four pultruded FRP channel. The investigation involves two different types of built-up columns, the first one with smaller pultruded FRP channels and less intermediate bolted connection with respect to the second one, which is generally stiffer. The study proposes a numerical analysis and comparison to experimental results. The research highlights that shear effect generates a reduction of the Eulerian critical load that came from to 10 % to 20 %; this phenomenon is less for single channel in which case the Eulerian critical load prevails. The investigation shows also a good agreement between the non linear analysis and the experimental results because it well captures the interaction between global buckling and the local one that appears in a single channel of the <b>built-up</b> <b>column</b> between bolts...|$|E

They are the stress concentration, brittle fracture of the welds and semi-rigid {{behavior of the}} connection. To upgrade the connection behavior, it is proposed to replace parts of the column cover plate, situated in critical areas where the beam flanges (or flange plates) connect to the column cover plate, by thicker and larger plates. To investigate the cyclic behavior of the proposed connection, a series of nonlinear finite element analysis were carried out on different models. Results indicate that the modified connection has such a strength and ductility {{that can be used}} in special moment frames. Its stiffness is also in the range of a fully restrained connection...|$|E
40|$|The {{two main}} effects {{that should be}} taken into account in the design of <b>built-up</b> <b>columns</b> are the {{shearing}} effect due to their reduced shear rigidity and the interaction between global and local buckling modes in the presence of imperfections. EC 3 considers such columns as Timoshenko members for accounting for shear deformation and provides guidance for the calculation of their collapse load under axial compression only for the simply supported case. In the present work an approximate analytical procedure for the calculation of the maximum 2 nd order bending moment along imperfect Timoshenko members with arbitrary rotational and translational boundary conditions under combined axial and lateral external loading is formulated. The procedure is verified by means of geometrically nonlinear numerical analyses with the use of shear deformable beam elements. This method is then used for the evaluation of the maximum actions due to combined axial and lateral loading along laced <b>built-up</b> <b>columns</b> with various end conditions accounting also for initial imperfections. Incorporating the 2 nd order bending moments in an interaction equation specifically formulated for laced <b>built-up</b> <b>columns,</b> the collapse load is calculated. Analytically obtained results based on the proposed method are compared with the ones found from geometrically and materially nonlinear imperfection analyses (GMNIA) of laced <b>built-up</b> <b>columns</b> modeled using either beam or shell elements. The accuracy of the analytical results is found to be very satisfactory. Due to its simplicity and accuracy the proposed method is a useful tool for the design of laced <b>built-up</b> <b>columns</b> in structural engineering practice. Â© 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|With the {{advantages}} of CFST <b>built-up</b> <b>columns,</b> including the higher confinement in the concrete, delay of the steel local buckling, higher compressive and flexural strength, earthquake and fire resistance, rapid construction, savings in the construction costs, etc. CFST <b>built-up</b> <b>columns</b> are increasing adopted in structural members with larger load eccentricity ratio and slenderness ratio, such as stadium, industrial buildings, bridge pier and pillar, and electrical transmission tower. However, the research is mainly focused on static performance, seldom research has been reported on the dynamic behavior of CFST <b>built-up</b> <b>columns.</b> The present research investigates the seismic behavior of CFST <b>built-up</b> <b>columns.</b> A detailed literature survey on the CFST built-up structures, including mechanical characteristics, applications, ductility in seismic design, previous experimental researches, and finite element formulation, is firstly illustrated. Six specimens with different grades of concrete and brace arrangements are designed and tested subjected to cyclic loading. The hysteretic behavior, such as failure mode, deformed shape, displacement ductility, rigidity and strength degradation, and energy dissipation capacity of test specimens are discussed. The corresponding validated finite element model (FEM) simulations are developed for parametric analysis, to discuss the hysteretic behavior, affected by axial load ratio, chord spacing, brace spacing, diameter to thickness ratio, and steel yield strength. Results indicate that the hysteretic characteristics of specimens are saturated and exhibited good ductility. The concrete strength and steel yield strength played a slight effect to the displacement ductility factor. While the ductility will be significantly affected by axial load ratio and geometrical types. Based on extended parametric analysis and regression analysis, a simplified method, consisted by equivalent slenderness ratio, axial load ratio and steel yield strength, is proposed to calculate the displacement ductility factor of CFST battened columns and laced columns, respectively. The accuracy is validated with test results. After that, to investigate the seismic performance of <b>built-up</b> <b>columns</b> used in practice, an innovative lightweight bridge with CFST composite truss girder and CFST lattice pier is studied as case study. For the purpose, FEM simulation and shaking table test are carried out. The FEM results agree with experimental data. In addition, the plastic hinges were predicted under transverse and longitudinal excitation respectively, revealed that CFST <b>built-up</b> <b>columns</b> has a favorable seismic performance. ...|$|R

However, failures have been observed in this type of columns in previous seismic events. This study analyses the performance of <b>built-up</b> <b>columns</b> with different configurations of battens when it is subjected to seismic loads. Four columns with different size of battens were simulated and subjected to three different intensities of axial load along with a lateral cyclic load. Results indicate that the size of battens influences significantly the seismic behavior of columns. Lower shear capacity of battens results in higher ultimate strength and ductility for <b>built-up</b> <b>columns.</b> It is observed that intensity of axial load has a significant effect on the ultimate strength of columns, but it is less influential on the yield strength. For a given drift value, the stress level in the centroid of smaller size battens is significantly more than that of larger size battens signifying damage concentration in battens rather than chords. It is concluded that design of battens for shear demand lower than code specified values only slightly reduces initial stiffness of columns; however, it improves seismic performance of battened columns...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{evaluates the}} presence of buckling modes in <b>built-up</b> <b>columns</b> made from pultruded fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) profiles when flexural instability is coupled with torsional instability. This phenomenon is already {{well known in the}} field of steel construction and is tested and emphasized with the use of thin walled open cross sections of pultruded FRP materials in testing to analyze the effects of local buckling due to FRPâs or thotropy and high deformability.

40|$|Columns are {{essential}} members in a structural system. Their types include pure axial compression members (rolled and built-up steel sections) and beam-columns. Columns are important members and thus many {{scholars in the}} past have been dedicated to the column research. This study presents a direct experimental verification of the AISC Specification for built-up compression members and steel tubs filled with aggregate concrete. To find out the difference of different steels (rolled and cold-formed), we also investigate the AISI Standard of slender C-shaped cold-formed steel members with web openings. The following findings can be drawn from this study and are specified as follows: 1. The AISC Specification for steel columns appears quite conservative, but they are still in the range of reasonable acceptance. 2. The AISI Standard for columns also appears reasonable (Ptest/Pu = 1. 02 ~ 1. 21), for column members with web openings, they are too conservative (Ptest/Pu = 1. 22 ~ 1. 54). 3. The effective sectional area concept was adopted to conduct the analysis of cold-formed steel. When consider the width-to-thickness ratio of members, analysis is long and tedious procedure. The most difficulty job is the calculation of warping constant (Cw) for an open thin-walled open section which is a tedious and difficult task and thus presenting an obstacle to the routine design in practice. This study proposes a step-by-step numerical procedure for evaluating the warping constant of a general open thin-walled section. The proposed procedure is a reliable and useful tool for computing the warping constant for an arbitrary rolled and cold-formed steel open section, which does not need a sophisticated computer software being used. æ±å­çºå£åæ§ä»¶ä¹éç¨±ï¼å¶é¡ååæ¬ç´è»¸å£æ§ä»¶(åé¼æ·é¢ãçµåæ·é¢) ãåææ¿åè»¸å£èå½ç©çæ§ä»¶åå±¬å£åæ§ä»¶ãé·ä¹ä»¥ä¾æ±æ§ä»¶çåå­¸è¡çºä¸ç´é½æ¯ç±éç ç©¶ä¸»é¡ï¼æ¬ç ç©¶éå°AISCè¦ç¯ä¸­åé¼æ·é¢(rolled section) ãçµåæ·é¢(build-up section) ï¼åé¼ç®¡æ··åå(CFT) é²è¡æ±æ§ä»¶è¦ç¯ä¹æ¢è¨èçè«æ¨å°ï¼ä¸¦ä½ä»¥ç¸éä¹å¯¦é©ä»¥è²æ¯è¼ãçºäºæ´äºè§£ä¸åé¼æéä¹å·®ç°ï¼äº¦éå°AISIè¦ç¯ä¸­å·è»åé¼æ§ä»¶(Cold-Formed Steel) é²è¡ç¸éä¹ç ç©¶èå¯¦é©ï¼ä»¥æå¾çè«ãè¦ç¯èå¯¦é©æ¯è¼ä¸­æ´å ç­è§£åå£é¼æ§ä»¶ä¹åå­¸è¡çºã æ¬è«æä¸»è¦çµè«åæ¬ 1. ç¶ç±çè«æ¸å¼èå¯¦é©çæ¯è¼ï¼AISCè¦ç¯å°æ¼æ±æ§ä»¶ä¹æ¿è¼è½åæ¯ç¸ç¶ä¿å®ï¼æå°å¨åççç¯åä¹å§ã 2.

40|$|<b>Built-up</b> <b>columns</b> {{are often}} used in steel {{buildings}} and bridges providing economical solutions in cases of large spans and/or heavy loads. Two main effects {{should be taken into}} account in their design that differentiate them from other structural members. One is the significant influence of shear deformations due to their reduced shear rigidity. The second is the interaction between global and local buckling. These effects are addressed here from both a numerical and an analytical point of view for laced <b>built-up</b> <b>columns.</b> It is concluded that the largest loss of capacity occurs when the local and global Euler critical stresses and the yield stress all coincide. This reduction in capacity becomes more prominent in the presence of imperfections, reaching magnitudes in the order of 50 %. Despite the detrimental effects of mode interaction many major design codes do not provide sufficient pertinent guidance. In order to address this issue, a simple analytical method is proposed for calculating the collapse load of laced built-up members taking into account the above effects as well as global imperfections, local out-of straightness and plasticity, which is then verified by means of nonlinear finite element analysis, using either beam or shell elements. The proposed method is found to provide improved accuracy in comparison to EC 3 specifications in cases of global elastic failure. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

Dicuonzo et al. (4 th Int. Conf. on FRP Comp. in Civil Eng., CICE 2008) presented a temporary, modular all-GFRP structure designed for an expo fair stand. In this structure, the 3 m-high columns are comprised of two standard PFRP C-shaped profiles with dimensions 203 x 56 x 9. 5 mm, connected with one another through 500 mm-spaced bonded battens. The modular, 6 m-span roof girders allow for covering 12 m-span lengths without requiring intermediate columns. Top and bottom chords of the roof girders are comprised of two standard PFRP equal-leg angles with dimensions 102 x 102 x 9. 5 mm, once again connected with one another using bonded battens. Bai et al. (Mater Struct 2013; 46 : 1143 - 54) performed four-point bending tests on built-up members used in the five-storey GFRP Eyecatcher building in Basel, Switzerland. That structure, built in 1999, still remains the tallest FRP building in the world. Its structural skeleton is comprised of three parallel trapezoidal GFRP frames connected by wooden decks. The {{various members of the}} frames were designed by assembling individual standard PFRP shapes by continuous bonding. Boscato et al. (Compos Struct 2015; 121 : 46 - 63) presented experimental results on PFRP <b>built-up</b> <b>columns</b> comprised of four standard C-shaped profiles mutually connected at discrete points either by bolting or by bonding. In a first attempt to interpret the experimental results with simple closed-form equations, the authors compared the experimentally evaluated buckling loads with those estimated using (1) Euler's and (2) Engesser's equations (applied to the <b>built-up</b> <b>columns</b> considered as members with uniform cross-section) and (3) an expression typically adopted for steel built-up members. Unfortunately, none of these expressions was capable to predict the experimental buckling loads and the authors concluded that geometrically nonlinear FE analyses are necessarily to be performed to capture the actual column behavior. The previously quoted papers do not raise the issue of a systematic approach to the design of PFRP built-up members, which should consider: various basic profiles (C- and L-shaped, etcetera); different types of connection between basic profiles (battens and or lacings, connected by bolting and/or bonding, etcetera); changes in geometric characteristics (member total length, spacing of the battens, etcetera); and various types of loading. In this context, the present paper deals with a series of parametric analyses of PFRP <b>built-up</b> <b>columns</b> comprised of two closely spaced C-shaped profiles. Numerical models of the columns are developed using bidimensional orthotropic finite elements. In order to define the maximum distance between the battens that ensures an overall buckling behavior, linear buckling analyses are carried out for different spacings of the battens. Moreover, to investigate the influence of the batten stiffness, both rigid and deformable battens are used in the models. Finally, geometrically nonlinear analyses of the coumns with initial imperfection are carried out to capture the ultimate resistance. In these analyses, the ultimate conditions are located either by a peak in the load-lateral deflection column response or by the attainment of the limiting material strenght at some point of the column. Since several battens spacings are considered, the numerical results obtained could be used, in analogy to the case of PFRP I-section columns (see National Research Council of Italy, CNR-DT 205 / 2007), to define a buckling design curve for <b>built-up</b> <b>columns...</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe (DSM) direct {{strength}} method [1] is used {{in order}} to predict the axial compression capacity of innovative cross-section shapes for <b>built-up</b> <b>columns</b> from cold-formed steel (CFS) profiles. The proposed four composed shapes have been adapted {{in order to obtain}} members of increased strength-to-weight ratio. After excluding various buckling mechanisms from the columns response to compressive loads, highly stable members with reduced sensitivity to initial imperfections are obtained. DSM predictions are validated experimentally for the four built-up cross-sections types. The investigation shows that DSM could easily be extended towards composed members if provisions for members sensitive to global-distortional buckling interaction are included in the method. The good agreement with experiments also indicates that the proposed built-up assemblies are reliable and can be integrated into everyday construction practice...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an improved constitutive equation of frame {{in the context}} of continuous medium technique. This improved constitutive equation, which is a consistent formulation of column global bending, is applicable to a complete class of frameworks including the ideal shear frame panel, for which the beams are assumed to be rigid, and the associated column system, for which the rigidity of beams is negligible. Global buckling and second-order effects of the frame structure are discussed. The main results can be extended to other types of lateral stiffening elements as <b>built-up</b> <b>columns.</b> A worked example is presented in order to compare the main results with those obtained by the classic matrix method.

30|$|During {{the past}} decades, several {{researches}} {{have concentrated on}} the performance of steel <b>built-up</b> batten <b>columns</b> due to axial loads (Hosseini Hashemi and Jafari 2009, 2012). Following the Bam earthquake of 2003 in south-eastern Iran, several steel structures were damaged (Eshghi et al. 2003). Failure of the <b>built-up</b> batten <b>columns</b> {{was one of the most}} observable failure modes in damaged buildings (Hosseini Hashemi and Jafari 2004; Hosseinzadeh 2004). In most of these studies, the behavior of the batten columns due to gravitational loads was investigated. In other words, most of the researchers neglected the effect of the lateral loads on the behavior of steel batten columns (Hosseini Hashemi and Jafari 2004). Following the Bam earthquake, some studies were conducted to investigate the behavior of batten columns due to the earthquake. Razzaghi et al. (2010) investigated the performance of <b>built-up</b> batten <b>columns</b> due to axial and cyclic lateral loads. The results of this study revealed that laterally loaded batten columns had extremely unstable behaviors in the post-buckling region. It was also shown that existing code provisions are not sufficient for seismic design of batten columns. Furthermore, Hosseini Hashemi and Hassanzadeh (2008) studied the performance of the damaged steel building with batten columns due to the Bam earthquake.|$|R

The specimens tested are assembled using four C-shape (off-the-shelf) GFRP pultruded profiles, having the same detailing as strut members in a large FRP structure that was executed in 2009 for restoration activities at the Santa Maria Paganica church in LâAquila (Italy). This church had partially collapsed walls and no roof after the 2009 LâAquila earthquake. A total of five columns have been characterised with two different configurations for the bolted connections joining together the C-shapes into the built-up member.

Several papers have been published on buckling and instability analysis of pultruded FRP columns, but the same studies do not deal with built-up type. In this case, it is necessary not only {{to take into account the}} effect of the high deformability of the FRP material, but also to clearly identify the extent of each element in the overall bearing capacity as well as in the type of connection - i. e. it can play a key role by increasing the axial stiffness or it may contribute to the shear stiffness. The investigation compares the results predicted by the existing formulas to experimental data as well as to an appropriate finite element analysis previously carried out.

40|$|Buckling of {{rectangular}} building frames is customarily analyzed {{under the}} assumption that the effect of axial extensions is negligible. The structure can then buckle only in modes whose wave-length is short, Le., of the order column length. The negligence of axial extensions is certainly justified if the building is not too high as compared with its width. However, the limiting height is not known precisely. Thus, in view of the permanent trend to taller and slenderer buildings, the question of safety against overall, long-wave buckling modes, in which the columns undergo significant extensions or shortenings, the floors tilt and the whole building frame buckles as a single column, gains in importance. Buckling modes with axial extensions have been studied for I-bay frames modeling <b>built-up</b> <b>columns</b> (7, 8, 9, 14, 19, 21), in which case the problem leads directly to one-dimensional difference equations.

40|$|The {{problem of}} <b>built-up</b> <b>columns</b> {{has been under}} {{investigation}} {{since the collapse of}} the Quebec Bridge in 1907, which occurred due to the failure of the lower chords. It was reported that these elements were not designed as latticed columns. It is widely accepted that <b>built-up</b> <b>columns</b> exhibit reduced shear stiffness resulting in an increase in lateral deflection. This reduction in shear stiffness leads to a reduction in the strength of the column, which may be accounted for by increasing the slenderness ratio of the built-up member to an equivalent slenderness ratio. One of the questions addressed by this research was to determine the appropriate value of this equivalent slenderness ratio. A differentiation was made between the action of a battened and a buttoned column. The second problem tackled was the need to limit the slenderness ratio of the individual members between interconnectors to something less than the slenderness ratio of the integral member. It was found that increasing this slenderness ratio decreased the strength of the column, but this could be accounted for by using the equivalent slenderness ratio. The second concern with increasing the slenderness ratio of the individual members between interconnectors was the occurrence of simultaneous local and global buckling. This interaction could also lead to a decrease in the strength of the column resulting from imperfection sensitivity. An experimental program was designed to investigate these problems. Three groups of specimens were tested. The first two groups were composed of channel sections, interconnected by batten plates, placed toe-to-toe forming a box-like section. The ends were hinged about the axis passing through the web, the X axis, and fixed about the other axis, the Y axis. The specimens with one and two interconnectors buckled about the Y axis, whereas, the specimens with more interconnectors buckled about the X axis. The third group was composed of channel sections, placed back-to-back, interconnected by batten or button plates. These specimens were hinged about the Y axis and fixed about the X axis, and buckled about the Y axis. The specimens of the experimental program were modelled using the finite element method and results were compared. Dept. of Civil and Environmental Engineering.

A total of six columns are characterized with two different configurations for the bolted connections joining the channel sections into a built-up strut. Test results are discussed and a comparison is made with closed-form equation predictions for flexural buckling resistance, with buckling resistance values established from both eigenvalue and geometric nonlinear finite element analyses. Results show that there is a significant role played by the end loading condition, the composite action, and imperfections. Simple closed-form equations overestimate the flexural buckling strength, whereas the resistance provided by the nonlinear analysis provides a reasonably reliable numerical approach to establishing the actual buckling behavior...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of an experimental and numerical investigation on the performance of <b>built-up</b> <b>columns</b> made by four FRP pultruded channel shapes connected through steel bolts along the length. The experimental investigation gives prominence to the different structural behavior of this kind of column {{in the case of the}} load applied only to the composed web â two of the four channels â and the case of the load applied to the overall cross-section, aspect that strongly influences the transfer mode of stresses. The experimental outcomes are used to check the available formulas to calculate the reduced length and the critical load and are compared to the results of an appropriate FE analysis. The results of the investigation put in evidence, in particular, the effectiveness of the built-up technique in presence of pultruded FRP elements, the significant influence of the mode of load application on the performance of the columns and the interaction between local and global buckling. The influence of the type of connection between the members and of the material shear deformability on the buckling behavior of the columns is also investigated...|$|R
