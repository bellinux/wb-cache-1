40|$|We {{present results}} of an {{investigation}} of the fine structure of the night sector diffuse auroral zone, observed simultaneously with optical instruments (ALIS) from the ground and the FAST electron spectrometer from space 16 February 1997. Both the optical and particle data show that the diffuse auroral zone consisted of two regions. The equatorward part of the diffuse aurora was occupied by a pattern of regular, parallel auroral stripes. The auroral stripes were significantly brighter than the <b>background</b> <b>luminosity,</b> had widths of approximately 5 km and moved southward with a velocity of about 100 m/s. The second region, located between the region with auroral stripes and the discrete auroral arcs to the north, was filled with weak and almost homogeneous luminosity, against which short-lived auroral rays and small patches appeared chaotically. From analysis of the electron differential fluxes corresponding to the different regions of the diffuse aurora and based on existing theories of the scattering process we conclude the following: Strong pitch angle diffusion by electron cyclotron harmonic waves (ECH) of plasma sheet electrons in the energy range from a few hundred eV to 3 – 4 keV was responsible for the electron precipitation, that produced the <b>background</b> <b>luminosity</b> within the whole diffuse zone. The fine structure, represented by the auroral stripes, was created by precipitation of electrons above 3 – 4 keV as a result of pitch angle diffusion into the loss cone by whistler mode waves. A so called "internal gravity wave" (Safargaleev and Maltsev, 1986) may explain the formation of the regular spatial pattern formed by the auroral stripes in the equatorward part of the diffuse auroral zone...|$|E

The accelerators, the method of injecting and analyzing the beams using television techniques and particle counters, and how the beams simulate the natural trapped electrons are summarized.

By design, this study closely follows the compilation by Hill & Zaritsky of the structural parameters of stellar clusters in the Small Magellanic Cloud. Both King and Elson-Fall-Freeman (EFF) model profiles are fit to V-band surface brightness profiles measured from the Magellanic Cloud Photometric Survey images.

In general, visible band image sequences are used to automatically detect suspicious fire events in indoor or outdoor environments. There are several methods which aim to achieve automatic fire detection on visible band images, however, {{it is difficult to}} identify which method is the best performing as there is no fire image dataset which can be used to test the different methods.

40|$|ABSTRACT. We have drilled 13 {{boreholes}} {{within and}} around a through-cutting rift on the (unofficially named) Roi Baudouin Ice Shelf, East Antarctica. Logging by optical televiewer (OPTV) combined with core inspection {{has resulted in}} the identification and characterization of several material facies. Outside the rift, OPTV-imaged annual layering indicates 150 years of accumulation over the 66 m length of one of the boreholes. Luminosity analysis of this image also reveals the presence of numerous dark melt layers as well as a systematic decrease in <b>background</b> <b>luminosity,</b> interpreted in terms of a progressive increase in light transmission during firnification. We identify four material facies within the rift: snow, granular ice, marine ice and unconsolidated platelets. We interpret the granular ice facies as snow that has been saturated by percolating sea water, and the underlying marine ice as compacted buoyant platelets that have adhered to the rift base. Core sections reveal the presence of tubular channels within the marine ice, indicating that it is macroporous and permeable to sea water. The lower boundary of this facies merges into a mushy layer of unconsolidated platelets that were successfully imaged by OPTV, revealing irregular sub-horizontal layering similar to that reported previously on the basis of (directional) borehole video...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} narrow linewidth, high resolution, and high quantum {{efficiency}} optical transmission filter, {{which can be}} used to image atomic potassium line radiation from flames, plumes or discharges over a bandwidth narrow enough to fall within a Fraunhofer dark zone in the solar spectrum. Our previous work demonstrated that resonant absorption and subsequent fluorescence near the entrance window of an optically thick potassium cell acts as a 1 GHz wide (. 002 nm) imaging screen transmission filter with high quantum efficiency (> 60 %). With laser illumination at the potassium absorption line center, this screen has an outstanding imaging capability (33 μm resolution). The work presented here focuses on using an ultra-thin (200 micron) potassium vapor cell to maintain image quality for in-band but off-resonant photons that are present with broad band radiation such as that from flames, plumes and discharges. In a thick cell, those photons are absorbed farther away from the entrance window and lead to <b>background</b> <b>luminosity</b> and image blurring. By employing a thin cell, it is shown that the filter maintains the high quantum efficiency (~ 50 %) and good imaging capability (~ 20 lines per mm) with broad band light, has a transmission linewidth of between 1. 5 and 2 GHz (0. 003 ~ 0. 004 nm), and an out-of-band rejection of better than 1000.

40|$|Infrared (IR) planar laser-induced {{fluorescence}} (PLIF) {{techniques for}} imaging {{of carbon monoxide}} and carbon dioxide are reported. These diagnostics employ a tunable IR source to excite overtone and com-bination band transitions of CO and CO 2, respectively, {{and one or two}} InSb focal plane arrays to collect fluorescence emitted via fundamental transitions from excited vibrational states. A brief outline of the theoretical framework for absorption and fluorescence modeling is presented, with most attention paid to the distinct characteristics stemming from the use of vibrational (IR) transitions as compared to more traditional electronic (UV) transitions. Of note are the conclusions that (1) acceptable fluorescence quan-tum yield (and therefore signal level) can be achieved despite relatively small Einstein A coefficients, as the quenching processes following IR excitation are often slow; and (2) vibration-to-vibration transfer to other IR-active species can enable imaging of more than one species with a single excitation wavelength. Experimentally, the large dynamic range afforded by the IR cameras (14 bit) allows for effective imaging despite the presence of <b>background</b> <b>luminosity,</b> while the use of two cameras enables imaging of multiple species simultaneously and/or common-mode rejection of luminous background in unsteady flows.

40|$|This is {{the first}} paper of a series {{dedicated}} to nebular physics and the chemical evolution of nearby galaxies by investigating large samples of HII regions with the CFHT imaging spectrograph SITELLE. We present a technique adapted to imaging spectroscopy to identify and extract parameters from 4285 HII region candidates found in the disc of NGC 628. Using both the spatial and spectral capabilities of SITELLE, our technique enables the extraction of the position, dust extinction, velocity, Halpha profile, diffuse ionised gas (DIG) <b>background,</b> <b>luminosity,</b> size, morphological type, and the emission line fluxes for individual spaxels and the integrated spectrum for each region. We have produced a well-sampled HII region luminosity function and studied its variation with galactocentric radius and level of the DIG background. We found a slope of 1. 12 +/- 0. 03 with {{no evidence of a}} break at high luminosity. Based on the width of the region profile, bright regions are rather compact, while faint regions are seen over a wide range of sizes. The radius function reveals a slope of 1. 81 +/- 0. 02. BPT diagrams of the individual spaxels and integrated line ratios confirm that most detections are HII regions. Also, maps of the line ratios show complex variations of the ionisation conditions within HII regions. All this information is compiled in a new catalogue for HII regions.

40|$|The lobula giant motion {{detector}} (LGMD) in the locust visual {{system is a}} wide-field, motion-sensitive neuron that responds vigorously to objects approaching the animal on a collision course. We investigated the computation performed by LGMD when it responds to approaching objects by recording the activity of its postsynaptic target, the descending contralateral {{motion detector}} (DCMD). In each animal, peak DCMD activity occurred a fixed delay δ (15 ≤ δ ≤ 35 msec) after the approaching object had reached a specific angular threshold θthres on the retina (15 ° ≤ θthres ≤ 40 °). θthres was independent of the size or velocity of the approaching object. This angular threshold computation was quite accurate: the error of LGMD and DCMD in estimating θthres(3. 1 – 11. 9 °) corresponds to the angular separation between two and six ommatidia at each edge of the expanding object on the locust retina. It was also resistant to large amplitude changes in <b>background</b> <b>luminosity,</b> contrast, and body temperature. Using several experimentally derived assumptions, the firing rate of LGMD and DCMD could be shown {{to depend on the}} product ψ(t − δ) · e^(−αθ(t−δ 0)), where θ(t) is the angular size subtended by the object during approach, ψ(t) is the angular edge velocity of the object and the constant, and α is related to the angular threshold size [α = 1 /tan(θthres^(/ 2)) ]. Because LGMD appears to receive distinct input projections, respectively motion- and size-sensitive, this result suggests that a multiplication operation is implemented by LGMD. Thus, LGMD might be an ideal model to investigate the biophysical implementation of a multiplication operation by single neurons...|$|E
40|$|On the {{way towards}} a low {{emission}} combustion a possible solution {{seems to be}} the use of leaner fuel mixtures. But the main problem occurring at full power conditions are the thermo-acoustic combustion oscillations which can not be tolerated. In order to examine the reasons for that problem we applied two different measurement techniques – DGV and OH* imaging – to an industrial sized combustion chamber operating at atmospheric pressure conditions. For the DGV measurements in hot environments the biggest challenge is to overcome the strong <b>background</b> <b>luminosity.</b> Therefore we applied a self-developed pulse laser system with suitable DGV characteristics such as high power (1 mJ), narrow bandwidth (< 1 MHz) and frequency stability (single-mode operation) together with a gated camera system. To record phase resolved measurements we extracted a trigger signal from the output of a piezo pressure transducer placed in front of the burner outlet. Another important aspect of applying the DGV technique is the addition of seeding particles to the flow. Therefore we used AlO-powder in a solid particle seeding generator which contains a sintered glass filter and a stirring device. Three light sheets were guided through small slits from the sidewalls into the measurement area. A cooled endoscope was mounted inside the combustor looking directly onto the burner head. With this arrangement we obtained all three velocity components for stationary conditions and for different phase angles during an oscillation cycle. The results show that under stationary conditions the flow field is nearly rotational symmetrically with a distinct recirculation zone. In contrast to the stationary flow the phase resolved measurements revealed a drastic change from a combustion with recirculation to a complete forward directed flow depending on the phase angle. In addition to this flow field measurements we recorded heat release images. The underlying principle of this technique is the use of the chemical excitation of the OH-radical as an indicator of the heat release. This is a simple imaging technique which uses only an intensified CCD-camera together with a wavelength filter permeable for OH* fluorescence. We examined the transition from stationary conditions to combustion oscillations with the help of those heat release images. During combustion oscillations the maximum of the heat release is connected {{to the development of a}} maximum velocity gradient between the recirculation zone and the outer swirled flow. The minimum of the heat release corresponds to a complete forward directed flow with a vanishing recirculation zone. ...|$|E

The absorption spectrum of the anomalous pigment can be inferred with assumptions (analogous to those already made with protanomalons trichromats) about how the different cone mechanisms pool their responses to yield luminosity.

40|$|Analogous to protans, the {{two types}} of deutan color-defectives—the dichromats (deuteranopes) and the {{anomalous}} trichromats (deuteranomalous) —do not differ in spectral sensitivity in the red-green range at threshold (either in the dark or against bright colored <b>backgrounds).</b> However, <b>luminosity</b> curves obtained by heterochromatic brightness matching show the latter to be slightly more sensitive in the blue-green, and slightly less so in the red, than the former. Experiment proves that these differences are due (at least in part) to contributions of cones containing the deuteranomalous anomalous pigment which are missing from the deuteranope's eye. The absorption spectrum of the anomalous pigment can be inferred with assumptions (analogous to those already made with protanomalous trichromats) about how the different cone mechanisms pool their responses to yield luminosity. Two alternatives thus revealed are (a) the normal red pigment in dilute solution or (b) a spectrum very {{similar to that of the}} normal red pigment but shifted slightly toward the short wave end of the spectrum. Since the spectrum inferred by (a) has the same λmax as the normal red pigment, (a) predicts that deuteranomalous observers will require a negative red primary when matching monochromatic lights of wavelengths near the λmax. This is not observed...|$|R
