5|$|Complete {{independence}} from British rule was granted on 10 December 1963, with the ZNP/ZPPP coalition as the governing body. The government requested a defence agreement from the United Kingdom, {{asking for a}} battalion of <b>British</b> <b>troops</b> to be stationed on the island for internal security duties, but this was rejected as it was deemed inappropriate for <b>British</b> <b>troops</b> {{to be involved in}} the maintenance of law and order so soon after independence. Much of the cabinet which was seeking closer ties with Egypt (ruled by the radical, anti-Western nationalist Nasser) did not want <b>British</b> <b>troops</b> in Zanzibar anyway. British intelligence reports predicted that a civil disturbance, accompanied by increasing communist activity, was likely in the near future and that the arrival of <b>British</b> <b>troops</b> might cause the situation to deteriorate further. However, many foreign nationals remained on the island, including 130 Britons who were direct employees of the Zanzibar government.|$|E

5|$|Montgomery {{then turned}} the army toward Montreal. The march was {{difficult}} {{as there was}} snow, water, and ice {{on the ground and}} a winter storm struck several days after their departure. In an attempt to stop an escape of <b>British</b> <b>troops</b> from Montreal to Quebec, Montgomery sent a detachment to Sorel where the force briefly clashed with <b>British</b> <b>troops.</b> The <b>British</b> <b>troops</b> quickly withdrew to their vessels in the St. Lawrence River. When Montgomery and the main army reached the outskirts of the city, Montgomery sent a messenger in demanding the surrender of the city or they would suffer bombardment. While negotiations for the city's surrender took place, Carleton fled down the St. Lawrence River in a small flotilla of ships. The city surrendered on November 13, and Montgomery and his army marched into the city without a shot being fired.|$|E

50|$|When General Howe {{had all of}} {{his forces}} in place, his initial moves did not alert Washington to the full danger that the Continental Army faced because Washington's {{intelligence}} operatives seriously underestimated <b>British</b> <b>troop</b> strength. On August 22, 1776, <b>British</b> Army <b>troops</b> from Staten Island landed on Long Island to begin the New York and New Jersey campaign to drive the Continental Army from New York City.|$|R
5|$|On September 15, 1776, British forces under Howe {{landed on}} Manhattan. The next morning, some <b>British</b> <b>troops</b> marched toward Harlem, {{where the two}} armies clashed again, while others marched into the city.|$|E
5|$|The Americans {{were still}} unaware {{that this was}} not the main British attack, in part due to the ferocity of the {{fighting}} and the number of <b>British</b> <b>troops</b> engaged.|$|E
5|$|The {{flanking}} party {{consisted of}} Knowlton's Rangers, {{which had been}} reinforced by three companies of riflemen, in total about 200 men. As they approached, an officer accidentally misdirected the men, and the firing broke out on the British flank, not their rear. The <b>British</b> <b>troops,</b> realizing that they had almost been surrounded, retreated to a field, {{where there was a}} fence. The Americans soon pursued and, during the attack, Knowlton was killed. Despite this, the American troops pushed on; driving the <b>British</b> <b>troops</b> beyond the fence {{to the top of a}} hill. When they reached the hill, the British forces received reinforcements; including some artillery. For two hours, the <b>British</b> <b>troops</b> held their ground at the top of the hill until the Americans once again forced them to retreat, into a buckwheat field where Barnard College now stands.|$|E

5|$|At 05:10 on August 22, {{an advance}} guard of 4,000 <b>British</b> <b>troops</b> left Staten Island {{under the command}} of Clinton and Cornwallis to land on Long Island. At 08:00, all 4,000 troops landed unopposed on the shore of Gravesend Bay. Colonel Edward Hand's Pennsylvanian riflemen had been {{stationed}} on the shore, but they did not oppose the landings and fell back, killing cattle and burning farmhouses on the way. By noon, 15,000 troops had landed on shore along with 40 pieces of artillery, as hundreds of Loyalists came to greet the <b>British</b> <b>troops.</b> Cornwallis pushed on with the advance guard, advancing six miles onto the island and establishing a camp at the village of Flatbush. He was given orders to advance no further.|$|E
