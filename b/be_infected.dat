5|$|Bears {{have been}} hunted for sport, food, and folk medicine. Their meat {{is dark and}} stringy, like a tough cut of beef. In Cantonese cuisine, bear paws are {{considered}} a delicacy. Bear meat should be cooked thoroughly, as it can <b>be</b> <b>infected</b> with the parasite Trichinella spiralis.|$|E
5|$|Native Americans and Inuit {{are more}} likely to <b>be</b> <b>infected</b> with colds and develop {{complications}} such as otitis media than Caucasians. This may be explained by issues such as poverty and overcrowding rather than by ethnicity.|$|E
5|$|Vertebrate predators {{of young}} birds include cats and crows. This species may also <b>be</b> <b>infected</b> by parasites, {{such as an}} eyeworm, a tick, Hyalomma marginatum, {{and at least two}} species of Haemoproteus blood parasites.|$|E
5|$|In the US, 58% of the {{population}} <b>is</b> <b>infected</b> with HSV-1 and 16% <b>are</b> <b>infected</b> with HSV-2. Among those HSV-2-seropositive, only 19% were aware they <b>were</b> <b>infected.</b> During 2005–2008, the prevalence of HSV-2 was 39% in blacks and 21% in women.|$|R

40|$|Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) was {{isolated}} from 11 % of 148 Hmong children under 1 year old with diarrhea at {{a refugee camp}} in northern Thailand. Of 16 children with EPEC-associated diarrhea, 11 <b>were</b> <b>infected</b> with EPEC that adhered to HeLa cells in a diffuse pattern, 3 <b>were</b> <b>infected</b> with EPEC that adhered to HeLa cells in a localized adherence (LA) pattern, and 2 <b>were</b> <b>infected</b> with EPEC that were nonadherent. In Bangkok, EPEC {{was isolated}} from 6 % of 64 children under 1 year old with diarrhea and 7 % of 56 children {{of the same age}} without diarrhea. Of four children with diarrhea, two <b>were</b> <b>infected</b> with EPEC with an LA pattern, and two <b>were</b> <b>infected</b> with nonadherent EPEC. Of four children without diarrhea, one <b>was</b> <b>infected</b> with EPEC with an LA pattern, one <b>was</b> <b>infected</b> with EPEC that adhered in a diffuse pattern, and two <b>were</b> <b>infected</b> with nonadherent EPEC. The 21 EPEC isolates with an LA pattern hybridized with the EPEC adherence factor DNA probe. EPEC was the only enteric pathogen identified in 16 (80 %) of 20 children with EPEC-associated diarrhea. EPEC was as frequently isolated from children under 1 year old as were other bacterial enteric pathogens. The problem of identifying EPEC with pools of polyvalent antisera are described, and the need to identify additional enteropathogenic determinants of EPEC is discussed...|$|R
5|$|A white {{cockatoo}} and a sulphur-crested cockatoo {{were found to}} <b>be</b> <b>infected</b> with the protozoon Haemoproteus and another sulphur-crested cockatoo had the malaria parasite Plasmodium on analysis of faecal samples at Almuñecar ornithological garden in Granada in Spain. Like amazon parrots and macaws, cockatoos frequently develop cloacal papillomas. The relationship with malignancy is unknown, as is the cause, although a parrot papilloma virus has been isolated from an African grey parrot with the condition.|$|E
5|$|Bee-eaters may be infested {{by several}} blood-feeding flies {{of the genus}} Carnus, and the biting fly Ornithophila metallica. Other parasites include chewing lice of the genera Meromenopon, Brueeliaa and Meropoecus, {{some of which are}} {{specialist}} parasites of bee-eaters, and the stickfast flea Echidnophaga gallinacea. The hole-nesting lifestyle of bee-eaters means that they tend to carry a higher burden of external parasites than non-hole-nesting bird species. Bee-eaters may also <b>be</b> <b>infected</b> by protozoan blood parasites of the genus Haemoproteus including H. meropis.|$|E
5|$|Changes in {{ecosystem}} biological diversity, {{evolution of}} parasites, and invasion by exotic species all frequently result in disease outbreaks such as cholera which emerged in 1992 in India. The frequency of AIDS/HIV is increasing. In 1996, about 46,000 Indians out of 2.8million (1.6% of the population) tested {{were found to}} <b>be</b> <b>infected</b> with HIV.|$|E
25|$|Most {{people who}} <b>are</b> <b>infected</b> {{with only a}} small number of worms have no symptoms.

40|$|Almost one {{in every}} {{two people in the}} {{developing}} world <b>is</b> <b>infected</b> with one or more types of intestinal nematode worms. When fewer than 50 % of people <b>are</b> <b>infected,</b> most carry only a few worms; but when more than 50 % <b>are</b> <b>infected,</b> the number carrying moderate to heavy numbers increases markedly, as does the risk of disease. The WHO recommends annual mass deworming of children when 20 % or more <b>are</b> <b>infected</b> and twice a year if 50 % or more <b>are</b> <b>infected.</b> We estimated the cost of this to treat children with 10 + worms, an arbitrary moderate to heavy infection. We concluded that it is not cost-effective to mass treat children when fewer than 40 % <b>are</b> <b>infected</b> because the majority are uninfected and few are likely be diseased. We propose annual treatment when 40 % or more children <b>are</b> <b>infected,</b> twice a year at 60 %, and three times a year at 80 % or more. This would cost USD 224 million annually to treat all children aged 2 – 14 years in 107 developing countries compared with USD 276 million using current WHO guidelines. The new three-tier guidelines also treat a larger proportion of infected children and treat children with moderate to heavy worm burdens more often...|$|R
5|$|The primary {{determinant}} of infection for any virus {{is its ability}} to enter a cell and produce additional infectious particles. The presence of CD155 is thought to define the animals and tissues that can <b>be</b> <b>infected</b> by poliovirus. CD155 is found (outside of laboratories) only on the cells of humans, higher primates, and Old World monkeys. Poliovirus is, however, strictly a human pathogen, and does not naturally infect any other species (although chimpanzees and Old World monkeys can be experimentally infected).|$|E
5|$|Two {{types of}} HIV have been characterized: HIV-1 and HIV-2. HIV-1 is {{the virus that}} was {{initially}} discovered and termed both LAV and HTLV-III. It is more virulent, more infective, and {{is the cause of}} the majority of HIV infections globally. The lower infectivity of HIV-2 compared to HIV-1 implies that fewer of those exposed to HIV-2 will <b>be</b> <b>infected</b> per exposure. Because of its relatively poor capacity for transmission, HIV-2 is largely confined to West Africa.|$|E
5|$|A mass murder–suicide occurs among {{a team of}} geophysicists at an outpost in Icy Cape, Alaska. FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{head for}} the outpost, {{accompanied}} by physician Dr. Hodge (Xander Berkeley); toxicologist Dr. Da Silva (Felicity Huffman); geologist Dr. Murphy (Steve Hytner) and Bear (Jeff Kober), their pilot. With the scientists' bodies the group finds a dog, who attacks Mulder and Bear. Scully notices black nodules on its skin, and suspects that it may <b>be</b> <b>infected</b> with bubonic plague; she also notices movement beneath its skin. Although Bear (who was bitten by the dog) becomes ill and develops similar nodules on his body, autopsies reveal no such nodules on {{the bodies of the}} scientists.|$|E

5|$|Archaea can <b>be</b> <b>infected</b> by {{double-stranded}} DNA {{viruses that}} are unrelated {{to any other}} form of virus and have a variety of unusual shapes, including bottles, hooked rods, or teardrops. These viruses have been studied in most detail in thermophilics, particularly the orders Sulfolobales and Thermoproteales. Two groups of single-stranded DNA viruses that infect archaea have been recently isolated. One group is exemplified by the Halorubrum pleomorphic virus 1 ("Pleolipoviridae") infecting halophilic archaea and the other one by the Aeropyrum coil-shaped virus ("Spiraviridae") infecting a hyperthermophilic (optimal growth at 90–95°C) host. Notably, the latter virus has the largest currently reported ssDNA genome. Defenses against these viruses may involve RNA interference from repetitive DNA sequences that are related to the genes of the viruses.|$|E
5|$|Brazza's martin may be hunted by humans, {{and both}} species may <b>be</b> <b>infected</b> {{with a variety}} of parasites. These {{swallows}} may be affected by poor weather when breeding, but neither appears to be under serious threat. The small islands which are the home of the Mascarene martin subspecies P. b. borbonica may be devastated by cyclones, which have the potential to cause severe temporary losses to the populations on Mauritius and Réunion. The legal protection afforded to the Phedina martins varies with jurisdiction, and ranges from none for Mascarene martins on Réunion to special protection for the same species on Madagascar. The Brazza's martin is not a protected species anywhere in its range.|$|E
5|$|Green-head ants are prey for {{a number}} of predators, {{including}} assassin bugs and the short-beaked echidna (Tachyglossus aculeatus), in the faeces of which have been found worker ants. Birds also eat these ants, including the Australian white ibis (Threskiornis moluccus), black kite (Milvus migrans), masked lapwing (Vanellus miles) and the Australian owlet-nightjar (Aegotheles cristatus). Workers and larvae can <b>be</b> <b>infected</b> by parasites; examined workers were seen with late-stage pupae of an unidentified parasite in their thoraces. In some nests of the green-head ant, some myrmecophilous insects such as the beetle Chlamydopsis longipes are sometimes seen living inside colonies.|$|E

5|$|One-third of the world's {{population}} {{is thought to}} <b>be</b> <b>infected</b> with TB. New infections occur in about 1% of the population each year. In 2016, {{there were more than}} 10 million cases of active TB which resulted in 1.3 million deaths. This makes it the number one cause of death from an infectious disease. More than 95% of deaths occurred in developing countries, and more than 50% in India, China, Indonesia, Pakistan and the Philippines. The number of new cases each year has decreased since 2000. About 80% of people in many Asian and African countries test positive while 5–10% of people in the United States population tests positive by the tuberculin test. Tuberculosis has been present in humans since ancient times.|$|E

5|$|Poliomyelitis is {{a disease}} of the central nervous system. However, CD155 is {{believed}} to be present on the surface of most or all human cells. Therefore, receptor expression does not explain why poliovirus preferentially infects certain tissues. This suggests that tissue tropism is determined after cellular infection. Recent work has suggested that the type I interferon response (specifically that of interferon alpha and beta) is an important factor that defines which types of cells support poliovirus replication. In mice expressing CD155 (through genetic engineering) but lacking the type I interferon receptor, poliovirus not only replicates in an expanded repertoire of tissue types, but these mice are also able to <b>be</b> <b>infected</b> orally with the virus.|$|E
5|$|Red foxes are {{the most}} {{important}} rabies vector in Europe. In London, arthritis is not uncommon in foxes, being particularly frequent in the spine. Foxes may <b>be</b> <b>infected</b> with leptospirosis and tularemia, though they are not overly susceptible to the latter. They may also fall ill from listeriosis and spirochetosis, as well as acting as vectors in spreading erysipelas, brucellosis and tick-born encephalitis. A mysterious fatal disease near Lake Sartlan in the Novosibirsk Oblast was noted among local red foxes, but the cause was undetermined. The possibility was considered that it was caused by an acute form of encephalomyelitis, which was first observed in captive bred silver foxes. Individual cases of foxes infected with Yersinia pestis are known.|$|E
5|$|Several parasites {{have been}} {{isolated}} from the hartebeest. These parasites regularly alternate between hartebeest and gazelles or wildebeest. Hartebeest can <b>be</b> <b>infected</b> with theileriosis due to Rhipicephalus evertsi and Theileria species. South of the Sahara, common parasites include Loewioestrus variolosus, Gedoelstia cristata and G. hassleri. The latter two species can cause serious diseases such as encephalitis. However, parasites are not always harmful – 252 larvae {{were found in the}} head of one Zambian individual without any pathogenicity. Nematodes, cestodes, paramphistomes; and the roundworm Setaria labiatopapillosa have also been {{isolated from the}} hartebeest. In 1931, a red hartebeest in Gobabis (southwestern Africa) was infected with long, thin worms. These were named Longistrongylus meyeri after their collector, T. Meyer.|$|E
