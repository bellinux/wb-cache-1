5|$|The album cover, {{photographed by}} Punk magazine's Roberta Bayley, {{features}} the four members {{leaning against a}} brick wall in New York City. The record company paid only $125 for the front photo, which has since {{become one of the}} most imitated album covers of all time. The back cover depicts an eagle <b>belt</b> <b>buckle</b> along with the album's liner notes. After its release, Ramones was promoted with two singles which failed to chart. The Ramones also began touring to help sell records; these tour dates were mostly based in the United States, though two were booked in Britain.|$|E
5|$|Mythology and {{folklore}} often {{exaggerate the}} skills of famous gunfighters. Most of these historical figures were not known {{to be capable of}} trick shooting, nor did they necessarily have a reputation for precision sharpshooting. Such tropes that are frequently seen in Westerns include shooting the center of a coin, stylistic pistol twirling, glancing shots that intentionally only graze an opponent (the bullet through the hat being an example), shooting an opponent's <b>belt</b> <b>buckle</b> (thus dropping his pants), a bullet cutting the hangman's rope, or shooting the guns out of opponents' hands (typically as an alternative to killing). The latter was debunked by Mythbusters as an impossibility, as unjacketed bullets tend to shatter into fragments that can hurt or even kill. Ed McGivern dispelled the myth of the inaccuracy of pistol fanning by shooting tight groups while fanning the revolver.|$|E

5|$|A set of iron carpenter's tools {{from the}} 3rd-4th century, {{including}} a compass for marking circles, {{was found in}} Przywóz, Wieluń County, {{where there was a}} Przeworsk culture settlement and a 2nd/3rd century dynastic burial complex. The graves of Przeworsk men typically include substantial collections of arms, so that their warrior's battle equipment and its evolution are well known. Less wealthy warriors fought typically on foot, with spears (for close range combat) and javelins (for throwing), both with iron heads. The better off fighters used swords, first of the long Celtic kind, and then in the 1st and 2nd century AD of the short and broad, gladius Roman infantry type. Swords were kept in sheaths, some of which, depending on status, were very ornate. The long and narrow swords, better suited for horseback combat, became popular again in the 3rd century, but only the more wealthy warriors had horses, not to mention iron helmets or ring armor. Round wooden shields had iron umbos in the middle, usually with a thorn for piercing the enemy. There were no saddles, but the richest of horsemen used silver spurs and bronze bridles with chain reins. Numerous Przeworsk culture objects including spurs and a unique silver <b>belt</b> <b>buckle</b> were recovered at the Aleksandrowice, Kraków County settlement area; some relics there are dated possibly as late as {{the first half of the}} 6th century.|$|E

25|$|Webelos Scouts have {{a choice}} of uniforms: the Cub Scout uniform or the Boy Scout field uniform with blue {{shoulder}} loops. The Webelos cap is green with a plaid panel and the oval Webelos emblem; the plaid is made up of the Cub Scout blue and gold and the Boy Scout red and green. The neckerchief is plaid with the Webelos logo and is worn with the slide with Webelos emblem. The blue Cub Scout belt, using the Webelos <b>belt</b> <b>buckle,</b> is worn with the Cub Scout uniform. Scouts wearing the Boy Scout Uniform may choose to use the Webelos <b>belt</b> <b>buckle</b> with either the blue Cub Scout or the green Boy Scout belt; Cub Scout belt loop recognitions, however, fit only the blue belt. The Webelos den may elect to wear a den emblem in place of the den number; the patches are the same as the Boy Scout patrol patches.|$|E
25|$|The uniform gives a Cub Scout {{visibility}} {{and creates a}} level of identity within both the unit and the community. The neckerchief, the neckerchief slide and the <b>belt</b> <b>buckle</b> uniforms are similar in basic design, they do vary in color and detail to identify the different divisions of Cub Scouts, Boy Scouts and Venturers. In all cases, shirts are tucked in.|$|E
25|$|The Question's {{specialized}} belt-buckle, which {{releases a}} binary gas that binds his mask to {{his skin and}} temporarily recolors his garb and hair, {{is similar to that}} of the Spider-Man villain Chameleon. In his initial appearances, which were drawn by Steve Ditko, the Chameleon had used a device in a <b>belt</b> <b>buckle</b> which emitted a transformation-enhancing gas. The binding element is adjusted to Sage's specific body chemistry.|$|E
50|$|Instead {{of wearing}} a {{conventional}} belt, skateboarders often wear shoelaces in belt loops {{to hold their}} trousers up. This is done mostly for fashion, {{but it is also}} useful because <b>belt</b> <b>buckles</b> often dig into a skater's stomach when skating. Since shoelaces do not require <b>belt</b> <b>buckles,</b> this digging is avoided. Another reason this is done is to avoid the excessive pain belts can cause if a skateboarder should fall.|$|R

25|$|Many observant Jews {{avoid the}} {{prohibition}} of carrying by use of an eruv. Others make their keys into a tie bar, part of a <b>belt</b> <b>buckle,</b> or a brooch, because a legitimate article of clothing or jewelry may be worn rather than carried. An elastic band with clips on both ends, and with keys placed between them as integral links, may be considered a belt.|$|E
25|$|There was {{no major}} change to the uniform since then, except for the {{adoption}} of embroidered shoulder ranks and badges for all ranks in the 1990s.

25|$|The {{discovery}} of the first tomb in 1889 was made while taking gravel from a neighbouring area of Apahida. Some of the artifacts were recovered for the Transylvanian Museum by H. Finály, and another two pieces (a sealing ring with monogram and a pendant with bells) were purchased by the Hungarian National Museum on the antiquities market in 1897. From the inventory of the tomb were preserved many objects of gold, a cruciform brooch with onion-shaped cufflinks, a bracelet with thickened ends, three rings, a <b>belt</b> <b>buckle</b> and a second smaller buckle, five pendants with bells, two silver mugs, a gold band and several appliques, probably used to decorate or repair vessels.|$|E
25|$|The {{official}} Cub Scout uniform is worn by {{youths in}} Cub Scouting. The basic Cub Scout uniform {{consists of a}} navy blue shirt, navy blue pants, shorts or Switchbacks, navy blue socks with gold tops for Cub Scouts or orange tops for Tiger Cubs, a navy blue web belt with brass buckle with Cub Scout logo, a neckerchief with slide, and a navy blue cap with a colored panel. The shirt has buttons, a pointed collar, two front button-flap pockets, and short or long sleeves. The insignia on the cap, neckerchief, neckerchief slide and <b>belt</b> <b>buckle</b> vary by section: Tiger, Wolf, Bear, and Webelos Scouts. The Cub Scout uniform originally was deliberately designed to emulate the uniform colors and design of the United States Cavalry of the 1800s.|$|E

25|$|The Service Khaki uniform {{today is}} {{reserved}} for commissioned officers (grades O-1 through O-10), chief warrant officers (current grades W-2 through W-5, W-1 not in use) and chief petty officers (grades E-7 through E-9). It is a khaki button-up shirt and trousers, worn with a gold <b>belt</b> <b>buckle.</b> The shirt features two front flap pockets and a pointed collar. Ribbons are worn above the left pocket of the shirt, with the warfare insignia above them. A nametag may be worn above the right pocket, and rank insignia is worn on the collar. The regulations for ribbons state the highest three awards, or all ribbons can be worn at once. There {{are two kinds of}} headgear authorized: a khaki combination cap is standard, but a khaki garrison cover is also authorized. Currently black and brown oxford shoes are authorized for all officers and CPOs. However, tradition and social pressure tend to restrict the wearing of brown shoes to members of the aviation community. Females are authorized to wear the same over-blouse as junior enlisted sailors.|$|E
25|$|The astylar {{design is}} by Jean Chalgrin (1739–1811), in the Neoclassical version of ancient Roman {{architecture}} (see, for example, the triumphal Arch of Titus). Major academic sculptors of France {{are represented in}} the sculpture of the Arc de Triomphe: Jean-Pierre Cortot; François Rude; Antoine Étex; James Pradier and Philippe Joseph Henri Lemaire. The main sculptures are not integral friezes but are treated as independent trophies applied to the vast ashlar masonry masses, not unlike the gilt-bronze appliqués on Empire furniture. The four sculptural groups {{at the base of}} the Arc are The Triumph of 1810 (Cortot), Resistance and Peace (both by Antoine Étex) and the most renowned of them all, Departure of the Volunteers of 1792 commonly called La Marseillaise (François Rude). The face of the allegorical representation of France calling forth her people on this last was used as the <b>belt</b> <b>buckle</b> for the honorary rank of Marshal of France. Since the fall of Napoleon (1815), the sculpture representing Peace is interpreted as commemorating the Peace of 1815.|$|E

Outside, Callum {{compliment}} Rani's dress, but Rani believes he is making fun of her and after telling Priya that she hates her, Rani leaves. Mason turns up to work as a waiter. As Sonya puts her drink down on his tray, she spots Mason's <b>belt</b> <b>buckle</b> and remembers it from the robbery earlier. With most of the party outside, Rhys Lawson (Ben Barber) comes inside to get a drink, while Priya tells her husband, Ajay (Sachin Joab), that she is going to text Rani. Outside the marquee, a shocked Sonya prepares to throw her bouquet, while one of the waiters changes the gas bottle. As Sonya throws the bouquet, a fire breaks out and the marquee explodes. Rhys comes to and tries to stand up, while Toadie discovers Sonya is bleeding from the back of her head. Ajay runs into the collapsed marquee to find Priya. Karl Kennedy (Alan Fletcher) advises Toadie not to move Sonya, before going to help out with the other injured guests.|$|E
