5|$|Diagnostic imaging by CT scan and MRI is {{recommended}} after a first non-febrile seizure to detect structural problems {{in and around}} the <b>brain.</b> <b>MRI</b> is generally a better imaging test except when bleeding is suspected, for which CT is more sensitive and more easily available. If someone attends the emergency room with a seizure but returns to normal quickly, imaging tests may be done at a later point. If a person has a previous diagnosis of epilepsy with previous imaging, repeating the imaging is usually not needed even if there are subsequent seizures.|$|E
5|$|Some {{treatments}} for stroke are time-critical. These include clot dissolution or surgical {{removal of a}} clot for ischaemic strokes, and decompression for haemorrhagic strokes. As stroke is time critical, hospitals and even pre-hospital care of stroke involves expedited investigations – usually a CT scan to investigate for a haemorrhagic stroke and a CT or MR angiogram to evaluate arteries that supply the <b>brain.</b> <b>MRI</b> scans, not as widely available, {{may be able to}} demonstrate the affected area of the brain more accurately, particularly with ischaemic stroke.|$|E
5|$|Brain AVMs may be {{detected}} on computed tomography angiography (CTA or CT angio) or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA); CTA is better in showing the vessels themselves, and MRA provides more {{detail about the}} relationship between an AVM and surrounding brain tissue. In general, MRI is recommended. Various types of vascular malformations may be encountered: AVMs, micro-AVMs, telangiectasias and arteriovenous fistulas. If surgery, embolization, or other treatment is contemplated (see below), cerebral angiography may be required to get sufficient detail of the vessels. This procedure carries a small risk of stroke (0.5%) and is therefore limited to specific circumstances. Recent professional guidelines recommend that all children with suspected or definite HHT undergo a <b>brain</b> <b>MRI</b> early in life to identify AVMs that can cause major complications. Others suggest that screening for cerebral AVMs is probably unnecessary in those who are not experiencing any neurological symptoms, because most lesions discovered on screening scans would not require treatment, creating undesirable conundrums.|$|E

25|$|Whether Devic's {{disease is}} a {{distinct}} disease {{or part of the}} wide spectrum of multiple sclerosis is debated. Devic's disease differs in that it usually has more severe sequelae after an acute episode than standard MS, MS infrequently presents as transverse myelitis, and oligoclonal bands in the CSF, as well as white matter lesions on <b>brain</b> <b>MRI,</b> are uncommon in Devic's disease, but occur in over 90% of MS patients.|$|E
25|$|In <b>brain</b> <b>MRI,</b> {{there is}} often an {{increased}} T2 signalling at the posterior columns of the spinal cord in patients with myelopathy caused by copper deficiency. T2 signalling is often an indicator {{of some kind of}} neurodegeneration. There are some changes in the spinal cord MRI involving the thoracic cord, the cervical cord or sometimes both. Copper deficiency myelopathy is often compared to subacute combined degeneration (SCD). Subacute combined degeneration is also a degeneration of the spinal cord, but instead vitamin B12 deficiency is the cause of the spinal degeneration. SCD also has the same high T2 signalling intensities in the posterior column as copper deficient patient in MRI imaging.|$|E
25|$|All {{people who}} present with red flags {{indicating}} a dangerous secondary headache should receive neuroimaging. The best form of neuroimaging for these headaches is controversial. Non-contrast computerized tomography (CT) scan {{is usually the}} first step in head imaging as it is readily available in Emergency Departments and hospitals and is cheaper than MRI. Non-contrast CT is best for identifying an acute head bleed. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is best for brain tumors and problems in the posterior fossa, or back of the <b>brain.</b> <b>MRI</b> is more sensitive for identifying intracranial problems, however it can pick up brain abnormalities that are not relevant to the person's headaches.|$|E

25|$|A {{study from}} 2013 {{provided}} brain imaging evidence that human responses to fear chemosignals may be gender-specific. Researchers collected alarm-induced sweat and exercise-induced sweat from donors extracted it, pooled it and {{presented it to}} 16 unrelated people undergoing functional <b>brain</b> <b>MRI.</b> While stress-induced sweat from males produced a comparably strong emotional response in both females and males, stress-induced sweat from females produced a markedly stronger arousal in women than in men. Statistical tests pinpointed this gender-specificity to the right amygdala and strongest in the superficial nuclei. Since {{no significant differences were}} found in the olfactory bulb, the response to female fear-induced signals is likely based on processing the meaning, i.e. on the emotional level, rather than the strength of chemosensory cues from each gender, i.e. the perceptual level.|$|E
25|$|Microcephalic osteodysplastic {{primordial}} dwarfism (MOPD) type II is an autosomal multisystem disorder including severe pre- and post-natal growth retardation, microcephaly with Seckel syndrome-like facial appearance, {{and distinctive}} skeletal alterations. Usually those affected have {{mild to moderate}} mental retardation. This female child is the first born of nonconsanguineous parents at 35 weeks gestation through a cesarean section due to intrauterine growth retardation. She had a retarded psychomotor development and was repeatedly hospitalized during her {{first six months of}} life due to recurring respiratory infections. Her electroencephalography, auditory brainstem response evaluation, and chromosomal analysis were relatively normal. A <b>brain</b> <b>MRI</b> revealed thickened cerebral cortices with few and large gyri prominently in the frontal and posterior temporal regions, incomplete development of the Sylvian fissures, and dilatation of the posterior horns of the lateral ventricles (colpocephaly). Usually only mild brain malformations are associated with MOPD type II. The imaging findings of this child’s brain most likely represent diffuse pachygyria, a mild form of lissencephaly. This child’s neurodevelopmental findings were mild when compared to previous reports of a well-defined chromosome 17-linked and X-linked lissencephaly in a bedridden patient with severe developmental delays.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, an {{optimized}} {{fuzzy logic}} method for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (<b>MRI)</b> <b>brain</b> imagessegmentation is presented. The method {{is a technique}} based on a modified fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering algorithm. The FCM algorithm that incorporates spatial information into the membershipfunction is used for clustering, while a conventional FCM algorithm does not fully utilize the spatialinformation in the image. The advantages of the algorithm are that it is less sensitive to noise than othertechniques, and it yields regions more homogeneous than those of other methods.

30|$|This study {{examined}} the effect of expertise and diagnosis on performance and gaze behaviour in a brain tumour detection task using MRI scans. Novices, medical students and experts completed both a whole-brain tumour detection task, which better reflects the clinical setting, and an independent-slice brain tumour detection task commonly used in experimental research. In the independent task (Experiment 1 b), diagnostic accuracy was recorded and revealed that Experts were the most accurate, confident and sensitive, followed by Medics and then Novices. This fits with the existing literature that diagnostic performance improves with expertise (Crowley, Naus, Stewart, & Friedman, 2003; Donovan & Litchfield, 2013) and confirms that participants were appropriately classified according to expertise level. A limitation of the task, however, was that participants {{were not required to}} localise the tumour and therefore could have been correct for the wrong reasons. Future research should collect localisation responses to provide more insight into the decision-making process. In addition, this result offers some insight into the development of expertise because three expertise levels were included. Medics, whose previous exposure to <b>brain</b> <b>MRIs</b> was to learn about brain structures and who had no formal training on the interpretation of <b>brain</b> <b>MRIs,</b> were more accurate and displayed higher sensitivity than Novices. We propose that their superior performance was driven by their knowledge of brain anatomy rather than perceptual skill. This fits with both Snowden, Davies, and Roling (2000) who reported that experience with a given stimulus enhances one’s sensitivity to critical features essential for detecting abnormalities and Nodine et al. (1999) who suggested that differences in resident performance resulted primarily from a lack of perceptual-learning experience. These findings indicate that perceptual skill is acquired with expertise but, since our Medics had little exposure to <b>brain</b> <b>MRIs,</b> {{it is unlikely that the}} perceptual component of medical image interpretation differentiated Novices’ and Medics’ performance on this task.|$|R
