2500|$|Tesla {{described}} its July 2015 {{introduction of}} the 90kWh battery as a [...] "range upgrade" [...] of the 85kWh battery and explained that the 6% energy increase was due to [...] "improved cell chemistry" [...] {{and the introduction of}} silicon into the cell's graphite anode. Tesla additionally announced its expectation of an annual improvement in battery capacity of about 5%. Tesla also explained that apart from the P90D the Model S has its main <b>battery</b> <b>conductor</b> protected by a fuse rated for 1,300A and that this rating is somewhat conservative given the uncertainty of the exact conditions under which a fuse melts. To reduce this uncertainty Tesla has for the P90D introduced Inconel battery contactors and an electronically controlled pyro-activated fuse, which monitors the current at the millisecond level, cuts the power with [...] "extreme precision and certainty" [...] and has a rating of 1,500A.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This study {{performed}} the quantitative distribution analysis of created voids to an insulator when applying general flame and DC short-circuit current to 2. 5 mm 2 HIV (600 V Grade Heat-Resistant Polyvinyl Chloride Insulated Wires). The diameter of cross-section of HIV normal product and the radius of conductor were measured to be 3. 3 mm and 1. 8 mm. The exterior of HIV exposed to general flame showed severe carbonization and its interior exhibited voids created by dechlorination reaction. This study observed the characteristics that, when the short-circuit current applied for 2 seconds from a DC 12 V lead <b>battery,</b> the <b>conductor</b> and neighboring insulator were melted, causing the insulator {{adhering to the}} conductor. On average, 87 voids were created on 10 mm of the HIV. The average diameter of voids was 0. 25 mm. In addition, it was found that, when the short-circuit current applied for 4 seconds, the interior of insulator in contact with conductor severely carbonized and showed exfoliation phenomenon. On average, 47 voids were created, with more voids at the bottom. The average diameter of voids was 0. 20 mm. When the short-circuit current for 6 seconds, most parts of upper part of conductor was carbonized, 20 voids were created. The average diameter of voids {{was measured to be}} 0. 24 mm. It could be seen that the created voids received little influence by the type of energy source and th...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{battery system}} {{consisting}} of Mg/MgS and Cu/CuS electrodes and a novel anion conductor has been developed. The sulfide based electrolyte contains Li 2 S and Li-TFSI in triglyme. After the first cycle it shows cycle stability for 10 measured cycles, {{and a high}} initial capacity of ∼ 660 mAh⋅g− 1 (based on the mass of magnesium), which drops to ∼ 100 mAh⋅g− 1 after the first cycle. Cu/CuS and Mg/MgS electrodes as well as full cells from these electrodes were developed and tested. Experimental and theoretical work was conducted with special focus on the electrolyte. Solutions of various inorganic and organic sulfides were tested for high concentration, (electro-) chemical stability, viscosity and ionic conductivity. Good results were obtained for a solution of Li 2 S and Li-TFSI (Lithium-bis(trifluoromethane) sulfonimide) in triglyme. Raman investigations prove that CuS forms and disappears reversibly on the electrode surfaces, i. e. {{that it is in}} fact a <b>battery</b> with anion <b>conductor...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{outstanding}} {{properties of}} carbon nanotubes (CNTs) {{make them a}} compelling material for use in applications including nanoscale circuits, flexible <b>conductors,</b> <b>battery</b> electrodes, and reinforced composites; and their combination of attractive mechanical, thermal and electrical properties makes CNTs truly unique. However, as with any new material, practical use of CNTs requires efficient and scalable processing methods, and commercial development requires these methods to be compatible with existing manufacturing platforms such as semiconductor processing. This chapter presents a thorough review of methods for integrating CNTs in micro- and nano- devices and systems, focusing on challenges of: controlling CNT size and structure; precisely placing and packing CNTs; and achieving device-compatible growth and processing methods. Examples are selected across the spectrum from early-stage research to present commercialization. Overall, while we are far from meeting the aforementioned challenges, near-term uses of CNTs will include interconnects, non-volatile memory, inertial sensors, and thermal interfaces. 1.

40|$|Consumer {{applications}} of microwave devices have grown very {{rapidly in the}} last few years. Consumer wireless communication applications require packaging materials with high performance, high volume manufacturing capability, and low cost. Microwave loss is one important performance factor. Utilization of low loss materials can reduce power consumption and prolong <b>battery</b> life. Both <b>conductor</b> and ceramic contribute to the microwave loss. At microwave frequency, conductor loss contributes significantly to the total loss. To take the advantage of the low loss LTCC dielectric, conductor loss has to be minimized. New generation Low Temperature Co-fired Ceramic (LTCC) tape and silver-based conductors were developed {{to address the needs of}} consumer wireless packaging applications. The new LTCC tape (A 6 S) shows excellent cutability and is suitable for large volume manufacturing, and offers low microwave loss. A new silver conductor system shows low conductor loss. The silver surface conductor exhibits excellent conductivity, solderability and leach resistance, and excellent initial and aged adhesion. The shrinkage of inner layer conductor is matched with that of LTCC. The via-fill conductor is compatible with the silver conductors and has high electrical and thermal conductivity...|$|R
40|$|Emergent technologies, such as {{electric}} vehicles and grid energy storage, are driving iterations of the lithium-ion battery (LIB) to exhibit enhanced safety and higher temperature capabilities. The commercial LIB based on organic liquid electrolytes presents {{a variety of}} safety concerns most notably flammability. Batteries encompassing inorganic solid electrolytes, known as solid-state batteries, have attracted significant attention in recent years due to resolution of overheating and thermal runaway, as well as lithium-ion conductivities matching liquids yet still maintaining a lithium transference number of unity. With commercial deployment rapidly approaching, solid-state research has been intensified to resolve {{many of the problems}} introduced once a liquid is replaced with a solid. The most challenging problems presented in solid-state batteries are interfaces. These interfaces are present on a variety of length scales: between lithium and electrolyte, electrolyte and binder, active material and conductive additives, and within the active material itself. To mitigate many of the interfacing problems, a materials and/or engineering design approach is employed dependent upon the situation. Fundamentals of electrolytic stability, particularly with Li 10 SiP 2 S 12, against metallic lithium are explored including the effects of the decomposition layer on <b>battery</b> performance. Mixed <b>conductors,</b> such as tin and TiS 2, are used for amplifying reaction area and simplifying charge transfer when interfacing with the active materials of silicon and FeS 2, respectively. A new design approach is demonstrated on producing thin solid membranes utilizing a self-healing polymer to form an in-situ polymeric matrix for mechanical strength and enhanced conductance. The new membrane is demonstrated as a self-optimizing interface to suppress the formation of lithium metal dendrites. In the final chapter, the solid interfaces are taken advantage of to demonstrate a new phenomenon of charge storage that is only present in the solid-state - pseudocapacitance in disordered LiTiS 2...|$|R
30|$|The growing {{demands of}} energy and the {{degradation}} of non-renewable resources {{have led to the}} conversion and storage of solar energy through photovoltaic method. Therefore, recently, the researchers have been seeking alternative materials and methods to improve the efficiency of solar cells. Lead oxides, existing in four basic types, namely, PbO, PbO 2, Pb 2 O 3 and Pb 3 O 4, have wide applications including semiconductors, transparent <b>conductors,</b> <b>batteries,</b> electro-catalysts, gas sensors, solar energy conversion materials, and other electronic or electronic related materials. Amongst these, PbO (lead monoxide) was utilized as a photoactive layer in Schottky type photovoltaic devices [1, 2] and a surface modification layer in inverted polymer solar cells [3]. PbO exists in two polymorphic forms as a tetragonal phase (α-PbO or litharge), and an orthorhombic phase (β-PbO or massicot). Though both phases have very low electrical conductivity (≈ 10 − 12 mho cm− 1), they exhibit interesting semiconducting and photoconducting properties. α-PbO and β-PbO are photoactive semiconductors with band gaps of 1.92 and 2.7  eV, respectively. α-PbO has potential application in photovoltaic [4] while β-PbO was used as a surface modification layer for lowering work functions [3]. In recent years, PbO nanoparticles and nanostructures have been prepared via different chemical techniques, such as precipitation, hydrothermal, sonochemical, etc. Till date, to synthesize PbO nanostructures viz. nanoparticles [5], nanorods [6], nanosheets [7, 8] as well as nanowires, hexagonal nanoplates, and microspheres [9, 10] above mentioned chemical techniques have been used. But, there are rare reports on the synthesis of PbO nanodiscs/nanoflowers using simple and cost-effective precipitation method. It is well known that the high surface area of nanostructures like nanorods, nanosheets, nanowires and nanodiscs, etc., of any material has profound effect on their applications. The size and shape of these structures can be controlled using capping ligand as reported elsewhere [11, 12]. It was reported that nanocomplexing with polymer can be used to combine the desirable properties of nanoparticles and polymer {{to be used in the}} Organic Thin Film Transistor (OTFT) [13]. In a similar way, the high surface area of semiconducting PbO nanostructures and electrical conductivity of polymers can be combined to be applied in the photovoltaic device. Besides the effect of capping ligand, it was also observed that the shape and size as well as surface area of the nanostructure can be influenced by the ultrasonic waves [14]. There are many reports on the synthesis of PbO and PbO 2 nanostructures using sonochemical (ultrasonication) methods [14, 15]. Ultrasonication can also cause the aggregation of the precipitated primary particles leading to 1 D, 2 D or 3 D nanostructures. Further, the ball milling and fine grinding of the dried powder help to reduce the particle size and their aggregation. Taking all these into account, attempts have been made to synthesize PbO nanodiscs/nanoflowers using simple method of precipitation employing ultrasonication and the effects of ball milling as well as fine grinding in agate mortar on the structure and morphology of PbO have been studied.|$|R
