They {{can be played}} alone, in teams, or online; by amateurs or <b>by</b> <b>professionals.</b> The players may have an audience of non-players, such as when people are entertained by watching a chess championship. On the other hand, players in a game may constitute their own audience as they take their turn to play. Often, part of the entertainment for children playing a game is deciding who {{is part of their}} audience and who is a player.|$|E
5|$|From {{the late}} seventeenth music became less an {{accomplishment}} of the gentle classes and increasingly a skill pursued <b>by</b> <b>professionals.</b> It was enjoyed in otherwise silent concert rooms {{rather than as}} incidental entertainment in the houses of royalty and nobles. The German flute was probably introduced into Scotland {{towards the end of}} the seventeenth century. The Italian style of classical music was probably first brought to Scotland by the Italian cellist and composer Lorenzo Bocchi, who travelled to Scotland in the 1720s, introducing the cello to the country and then developing settings for Lowland Scots songs. He possibly had a hand in the first Scottish Opera, the pastoral The Gentle Shepherd, with libretto by Allan Ramsay. Music in Edinburgh prospered through the patronage of figures including the merchant Sir John Clerk of Penicuik, who was also a noted composer, violinist and harpiscordist. The growth of a musical culture in the capital was marked by the incorporation of the Musical Society of Edinburgh in 1728.|$|E

5|$|Music in {{religious}} rituals, especially Roman Catholic, {{manifests itself in}} a number of ways. Parish bands, for example, are quite common throughout Italy. They may be as small as four or five members to as many as 20 or 30. They commonly perform at religious festivals specific to a particular town, usually in honor of the town's patron saint. The historic orchestral/choral masterpieces performed in church <b>by</b> <b>professionals</b> are well-known; these include such works as the Stabat Mater by Giovanni Battista Pergolesi and Verdi's Requiem. The Second Vatican Council from 1962 to 1965 revolutionized music in the Roman Catholic Church, leading to {{an increase in the number}} of amateur choirs that perform regularly for services; the Council also encouraged the congregational singing of hymns, and a vast repertoire of new hymns has been composed in the last 40 years.|$|E
5|$|Clarinet {{bodies have}} been made {{from a variety of}} {{materials}} including wood, plastic, hard rubber, metal, resin, and ivory. The vast majority of clarinets used <b>by</b> <b>professionals</b> are made from African hardwood, mpingo (African Blackwood) or grenadilla, rarely (because of diminishing supplies) Honduran rosewood and sometimes even cocobolo. Historically other woods, notably boxwood, were used. Most inexpensive clarinets are made of plastic resin, such as ABS. Resonite is Selmer's trademark name for its type of plastic. Metal soprano clarinets were popular in the early 20th century until plastic instruments supplanted them; metal construction is still used for the bodies of some contra-alto and contrabass clarinets and the necks and bells of nearly all alto and larger clarinets. Ivory was used for a few 18th-century clarinets, but it tends to crack and does not keep its shape well. Buffet Crampon's Greenline clarinets are made from a composite of grenadilla wood powder and carbon fiber. Such clarinets are less affected by humidity and temperature changes than wooden instruments but are heavier. Hard rubber, such as ebonite, has been used for clarinets since the 1860s, although few modern clarinets are made of it. Clarinet designers Alastair Hanson and Tom Ridenour are strong advocates of hard rubber. Hanson Clarinets of England manufactures clarinets using a grenadilla compound reinforced with ebonite, known as 'BTR' (bithermal reinforced) grenadilla. This material is also not affected by humidity, and the weight is {{the same as that of}} a wooden clarinet.|$|E
5|$|In 1925, Ferrari {{was called}} to assist a {{military}} wife during childbirth at the Hospital Militar Central of Buenos Aires, which had no gynecological unit. After she proposed that one be developed, Ferrari started the facility with one bed and donated equipment and supplies. The military gazette began advertising from June of that year that gynecological services were available from Mondays to Fridays at the hospital. As military wives {{became aware of the}} services, the growth was exponential and within five years Ferrari had expanded the service to two floors that housed a maternity unit with two delivery rooms, their own sterilization facility, a recovery unit, and forty beds in private rooms. She also developed a small sealed room with purified air and an incubator, {{the first of its kind}} in Argentina. Ferrari brought the techniques she had learned abroad to Argentina. Though radiology had been performed in other parts of the world for decades, there was resistance to implementing it <b>by</b> <b>professionals</b> who had no experience with it. Ferrari insisted it should be introduced and fought against the previous practice of surgical solutions for all cases, advocating that surgery only be used when absolutely necessary. A commemoration for the 10th anniversary of the maternity unit was attended by the Minister of War, the Director General of Health, the Hospital Director and other senior officials, as well as by children born over the past 10 years together with their families. A commission of the Marine wives who had received service from Ferrari's unit made a substantial donation. Despite her success, the atmosphere at the hospital remained hostile. Following the 1930 coup d'état of José Félix Uriburu with the country's shift to a more conservative stance during the Infamous Decade, Ferrari ultimately was forced to leave the hospital in 1939.|$|E

5|$|William Lindsay Brandon {{was born}} to Irishman Gerard Brandon, {{a veteran of the}} American Revolution, in either 1801 or 1802 in Adams County, Mississippi. Brandon's exact birth date cannot be {{determined}} as his family records were destroyed in an 1831 fire. He settled in Wilkinson County, Mississippi near Pinckneyville in 1824. The following year, Brandon married Ann Davis. This union produced two children, however, both Davis and her children would soon die. Brandon was educated at Washington College (now Washington and Lee University) in Virginia, and the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University) where he studied medicine. In his antebellum career, he became a planter, highly interested in horses and hunting. In 1826, Brandon served in the Mississippi State Legislature, around the same time that his brother Gerard Brandon was serving as the governor of Mississippi. In 1828, Brandon founded the Kelter Club, a gentlemen's club populated by propertied men from the Natchez area of Mississippi and from West Feliciana Parish in Louisiana. In 1833, Brandon married Ann Eliza Ratliff, having three sons, William, Lane William and Robert, all of whom later served in the Confederate States Army. A fourth son, Eugene, {{died at the age of}} two. Brandon enlisted for service in the Mexican American War, and become a major general in the local militia. Because of his medicinal expertise, Brandon was consulted often <b>by</b> <b>professionals</b> in the field. When Brandon's wife died in 1840, he continued to take care of her plantation, as well as his own Arcole Plantation. By 1860, Brandon owned a considerable amount of property, including $14,000 in real estate and $64,000 in personal property, as well as 63 slaves and 16 slave quarters.|$|E
