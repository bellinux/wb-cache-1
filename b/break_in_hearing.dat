Meanwhile, Dalia notices a strange similarity between a recent photo of Roberto and Nina and some unseen person in another photo. Before she can contact Roberto, the killer <b>breaks</b> <b>in.</b> She <b>hears</b> noises and climbs stairs to an attic, hiding in a wardrobe, but when she emerges, the killer stabs her to death. Roberto returns home to find the body. The police perform an optographical test to see the last thing Dalia saw before she died, but only get a blurry image of four dark smudges against a gray background, an image which the technician refers to as [...] "four flies on gray velvet."

Threshold shifts could be averaged for 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz. The shift immediately after the ending of the music was 1. 7 dB for right ears, and 3. 4 dB for left ears. The difference between left and right ears was significant. One hour after the exposure, right ears were recovered to baseline conditions whereas left ears showed a small but clinically irrelevant remaining shift of approximately 1 dB. The advice to use chill-out zones is still valid, because this helps to reduce the duration to the exposure.

40|$|This article {{offers an}} {{examination}} of the psychophysical studies of accommodation <b>in</b> <b>hearing</b> by Ernst Mach and Max Planck, natural scientists better known for their accomplishments in physics and philosophy. Early in his career, Mach sought to experimentally locate the possible mechanism of accommodation <b>in</b> <b>hearing,</b> the phenomenon <b>in</b> which individuals can alter their experience of sound by changing their attention. Planck, employing a microtonal harmonium, studied the role of attention in vocalists’ abilities to hear tempered intervals—what he termed accommodation <b>in</b> <b>hearing.</b> Both mobilized music as a means of argument and experiment. This article shows how each physicist’s conception of accommodation <b>in</b> <b>hearing</b> drew on music and, in turn, informed his ideas about the historicity of hearing, the universality of the nineteenth- century Western musical aesthetic, and the nature of knowledge itself...|$|R
40|$|Office {{workers are}} {{commonly}} targeted in interventions {{to modify their}} sitting behaviour, yet there is limited evidence of the correlates of <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> sitting to inform intervention development. This study identifies the individual, workplace and spatial configuration correlates of the frequency of <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> sitting (number/hour) in office workers (n = 5531) stratified by office type (private-enclosed, shared, open plan). All behaviours and potential correlates were measured via self-report using an online cross-sectional survey. Regression analyses revealed age was the only socio-demographic characteristic associated with frequency of <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> sitting in all office types. Greater job autonomy and local connectivity were positively associated with frequency of <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> sitting in shared and open-plan offices. In open-plan offices co-worker proximity was negatively associated with frequency of <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> sitting. Co-worker visibility was positively associated with frequency of <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> sitting in all office types. This study demonstrates that individual, workplace and spatial configuration factors are all associated with the frequency of <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> sitting and that these relationships differ by office type. These observations extend prior studies that have only examined correlates at a single level (e. g. the individual). This evidence could be useful to guide future interventions {{in the design of}} workplaces to increase <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> sitting and workers physical activity...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: To date it {{is unknown}} whether there are moderating {{variables}} for the associations between children’s self-reported screen time and <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> screen time and objectively measured sedentary time and <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> sedentary time. The aim {{of the present study}} was to examine whether the associations between self-reported screen time and <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> screen time and accelerometer assessed sedentary time and <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> sedentary time were moderated by gender, ethnicity, children’s moderate-to vigorous physical activity (MVPA), parents’ educational level, parents’ screen time and <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> screen time and parents physical activity (PA). Methods: Screen time and <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> screen time were assessed with questionnaires in a sample of 445 children (10 - 12 years) in Belgium, Greece, Hungary and Norway. Parents’ screen time, <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> screen time, parents’ PA and demographics were also assessed with questionnaires. Accelerometers measured sedentary time per day and <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> sedentary time per day and MVPA (children only). Bivariate and multivariate linear regression analyses were applied to assess the associations between the independent variables and the dependent variables. Interaction terms were added in the final model to examine whether the associations between self-reported screen time and <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> screen time and accelerometer assessed sedentary time and <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> sedentary time were moderated by the significant independent variables. Results: No statistical significant interactions were found between the significant independent variables. Country specific significant associations were found between self-reported screen time and gender, parents’ screen time, parents’ educational level and accelerometer assessed sedentary time. Country specific associations were found between self-reported breaks during one hour of screen time and parents’ educational level and ethnicity.

40|$|In most OECD countries, {{we cannot}} reject {{up to three}} <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> the mean of inflation: one <b>break</b> <b>in</b> the late 1960 ’s-early 1970 ’s, one in the early-mid 1980 ’s and another <b>break</b> <b>in</b> the early 1990 ’s.

Finally, controlling for <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> the mean of inflation weakens the effects on inflation of M 3 growth and of the real unit labour cost towards insignificance while {{the effects of the}} output gaps on inflation are more robust.
