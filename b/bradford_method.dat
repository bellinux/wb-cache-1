40|$|A {{comparative}} study between the biuret method (standard method for total proteins) and spectrophotometric methods using dyes (Bradford, 3 ', 3 ", 5 ', 5 "-tetrabromophenolphthalein ethyl ester-TBPEE, and erythrosin-B) {{was carried out}} for the determination of total proteins in blood plasma from rats. <b>Bradford</b> <b>method</b> showed the highest sensitivity for proteins and biuret method showed the lowest. For all the methods, the absorbance for different proteins (BSA, casein, and egg albumin) was measured and <b>Bradford</b> <b>method</b> showed the lowest variation of absorbance. The concentration of total protein obtained by using <b>Bradford</b> <b>method</b> was not statistically different (p> 0. 05) from concentration of total protein obtained by the biuret method. But in regard to erythrosin-B and TBPEE methods the concentrations of total protein were statistically different (p< 0. 05). Thus, <b>Bradford</b> <b>method</b> could be used instead of the biuret method for determination of total proteins in blood plasma...|$|E

40|$|The {{response}} of the Baltic diatom Cyclotella meneghiniana to iron deficiency was examined. The following growth parameters were measured: cell number, chlorophyll a and protein content.

40|$|The article {{presents}} a comparative analysis of four methods for quantifying the protein-peptide complexes content in extracts obtained from animal raw materials, {{as well as}} the low- and highmolecular weight extract fractions: the direct spectrophotometric determination at wavelengths of 260 and 280 nm with subsequent calculation by the Kalckar formula; the biuret reaction by the Kingsley-Weichselbaum method; the <b>method</b> with <b>Bradford</b> reagent and the standard Lowry method. Experimental data analysis demonstrates that in case of the extract that contains protein-peptidic complexes in different molecular weights range, the Kingsley-Weichselbaum method shows the highest quality of protein concentration determination; while studying highmolecular weight fraction (more than 30 kDa), it is possible to obtain more information by combining the spectrophotometric method and the Kingsley-Weichselbaum method. Low-molecular weight fractions (less than 30 kD) should be investigated by complex methods including the spectrophotometric <b>method,</b> Lowry and <b>Bradford</b> <b>methods.</b> These methods make it possible to presumably estimate protein molecules size ranges (by amount of peptide bonds), and also to determine hydrophobic and aromatic amino acids presence...|$|R

30|$|In this leakage of {{reducing}} sugars and proteins through the membrane was determined. For this, overnight grown cultures of E. coli, Bacillus cereus, and Staphylococcus aureus were taken, and 2 [*]ml sample was withdrawn from each culture and was marked as 0 [*]h sample. One milliliter of AgNPs solution (1 [*]mg/ml) {{was added to}} each culture and was incubated at 200 [*]rpm and 37 [*]°C. Now, the sample was withdrawn after 2 [*]h, 4 [*]h, and 6 [*]h from each culture. All the samples were centrifuged at 10, 000 [*]rpm for 5 [*]min.

30|$|A nickel {{affinity}} chromatography {{was used to}} purify the VEGF proteins. The total protein extract (either from total soluble proteins or from solubilised IB) was loaded on His Trap™chelating HP 1  ml column (GE healthcare life sciences) with a flow rate of 1  ml/min. The resin was washed with 30  ml binding buffer (20  mM NaH 2 PO 4 Na 2 HPO 4, 500  mM NaCl, 10  mM Imidazole, pH 7.4) to enable elution of non-specifically-bound proteins. Finally, the His-tagged proteins were eluted from the resin with Imidazole linear gradient from 10 to 500  mM in Elution Buffer (20  mM NaH 2 PO 4 Na 2 HPO 4, 500  mM NaCl, pH  7.4). The purity of collected fractions was assessed by SDS-PAGE, and protein concentration was checked using <b>Bradford’s</b> <b>method.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} heat induced {{changes on the}} immunoreactivity of a-lactalbumin (a-la) in whey was evaluated. Whey and acidified a-la {{solutions}} were heated for various times at temperatures between 60 and 100 °C. After heating, the samples were clarified and the protein content (by <b>Bradford's</b> <b>method),</b> the quantity of a-la (by FPLC method) and the immune response to an anti a-la probe were determined. The samples heated at 80 °C were characterized by the highest a-la immunoreactivity properties. Raising temperature up to 90 °C and 100 °C caused a marked decrease in a-la immunoreactivity. As was found by FPLC method in the samples heated at 60 and 65 °C, a-la content changes were not statistically significant. A gradual decrease {{in the content of}} a-la was observed with increased temperature and duration of heating. ...|$|R
