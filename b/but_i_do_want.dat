2500|$|On his Home Truths BBC {{radio show}} John once commented {{about his own}} death: [...] "I {{definitely}} want to be buried, although not yet. I'm 61 on Wednesday—just a working day for me, I'm afraid—so actually I should have {{a mile or two}} left in me, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> the children to be able to stand solemnly at my graveside and think lovely thoughts along the lines of 'Get out of that one, you swine', which they won't be able to do if I've been cremated. I think I want 'Teenage dreams, so hard to beat' on my gravestone and every night at dusk the trumpeters of the 5th Battalion King's Shropshire Light Infantry to play Misty in Roots' 'Mankind' over the grave. Lovely." ...|$|E
6000|$|LATTER. I don't in {{the least}} want to destroy {{the balance of the}} scene, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> to be clear about the spirit. What is the spirit? ...|$|E
60|$|DICK. I {{would n't}} ask her to promise, {{it would n't be}} fair when she 's so young, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> her to know that I shall never change.|$|E
5000|$|By 2000 {{they had}} taken on a new bassist, Sam Powers, and {{released}} their third full-length album, In the Valley of Dying Stars, as produced by long-time friend Nick Raskulinecz with help from Don Coffey Jr, who was beginning to show a keen interest in life {{on the other side of}} the glass. In the Valley of Dying Stars is by far the most emotional and raw of all of their albums; and, musically, in stark contrast to Head Trips diverse instrumentation, Dying Stars kept to the standard rock format: guitar, drums, bass. The emotional core of Dying Stars emanates from the death of Daviss grandfather (his namesake), to whom John had been very close and had admired dearly. Davis feelings on the record industry also emerged in songs such as [...] "Keep it Close to Me:" [...] "I want rock and roll, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>dont</b> <b>want</b> to deal with the hassle. I know what <b>I</b> know, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>dont</b> <b>want</b> to feel like an asshole." ...|$|R
60|$|CLEOPATRA. Then I {{consent to}} stay, because <b>I</b> am asked. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not <b>want</b> to, mind.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{wanted no}} telling as to that; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>want</b> telling as to your mode of life, and I {{have had it}} now. You had better not press me. You had better see Mr. Boltby. He {{will tell you what}} I am willing to do for you upon {{receiving}} your written assurance that you will never renew your offer of marriage to Miss Hotspur." ...|$|R
6000|$|Louis sighed, and {{presently}} added, smiling, 'I am {{not going}} to rave about preferences for another; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> to know whether anything can be done for poor Jem Frost.' ...|$|E
6000|$|MRS. G. (Turning over {{contents}} of table.) I know you'll hate me for this; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> {{to see what}} your work is like. (A pause.) Pip, what are 'farcy-buds'? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh dear, no, I can't speak; I {{have none}} {{of that sort of}} talent. I have no self-possession, no eloquence; I can't put three words together. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> to contribute." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I did," [...] said Aunt Beatrice weakly. Margaret's sudden attack fairly startled {{the truth}} out of her. [...] "It is very silly of me, <b>I</b> know, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>want</b> to go. <b>I</b> didn't care {{about a new}} dress. I'd have been quite willing to wear my grey silk, and I could have fixed the sleeves. What {{difference}} would it have made? Nobody would ever have noticed me, but Bella thought it wouldn't do." ...|$|R
6000|$|As the old roan jogged {{away from}} the doctor's house, Miss Panney remarked to her companion, [...] "I needn't have hurried you off so soon, Dora, for it is three hours before the next mail will leave; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>want</b> Mrs. Tolbridge {{to sit down at}} once and write that letter without being {{interrupted}} by anything which you might have come to tell her. Of course, the sooner you send her the address, the better." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No; I {{have not}} seen him since I met him in the Park. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not <b>want</b> to talk about Mr. Hamel, Ayala. Mr. Hamel is nothing." ...|$|R
60|$|LADY UTTERWORD. I DON'T {{want to be}} kissed; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> you {{to behave}} {{properly}} and decently. We are sisters. We have been separated for twenty-three years. You OUGHT to kiss me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, mammy, {{how good}} you be! It don't seem as if I ought to take it. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> to go!" [...] cried Eli, {{catching}} her round the neck in an ecstasy of boyish delight and gratitude.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Not immediately, at any rate, dear Jane. It is {{very kind}} in you to wish {{to take her}} off our hands, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> to try her a little longer. I thought {{she seemed to be}} {{softening}} last night.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Toby {{was quite}} {{overcome}} with the presents, and seemed {{at a loss}} how to thank her for them. He attempted to speak, but could not get the words out at first; and then he said, as he put the two photographs in the same pocket with his money: [...] "You're awful good to me, an' when I {{get to be a}} man I'll give you lots of things. I wasn't so very hungry, if I am such a big eater, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>want</b> something." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{would serve}} him {{with all my}} heart, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not <b>want</b> to stay here. I love the Castle of Montemar better, and my mother has no one but me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Aye! <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not <b>want</b> the {{stranger}} hurt--not just yet," [...] murmured Chauvelin, savagely, [...] "but there, you've done your best. The Fates grant that I {{may not be}} too late. [...] ." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> to be {{thoroughly}} well educated. I {{meant to go}} through them all, like Gillian and Mysie, and I am sure father must wish it too. I know he meant it when he went out last year.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Only {{you said}} more than you meant, Japs. If it {{relieves}} your mind, it hurts other people. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> the note taken, so go and come back {{in time for the}} sports; which I don't think you will find much damaged.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you, sir! It seems a {{great deal}} for such a small job. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> it very much. May I tell you how I'd like to spend it, father?" [...] cried Abby, beaming with the sweet delight of helping others.|$|E
60|$|That promise was a relief. I knew Greaser {{would come}} to a bad end, and {{certainly}} would get his just deserts; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not <b>want</b> him punished any more {{for what he had}} done to me.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Good-bye, my lord. I shall {{always think}} of you {{as one of the}} kindest people I ever knew. I thought it best to send to you for {{different}} reasons, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not <b>want</b> you to come back.' ...|$|R
60|$|OCTAVIUS. [rising, pettishly] It's {{horrible to}} talk like that about her when she is upstairs crying for her father. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> so <b>want</b> her to eat me that I can bear your brutalities because they give me hope.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course I don't {{want you}} to eavesdrop, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> you {{to find out about}} them. And about Mr. Burnamy, too. I can wait, about the others, or manage for myself, but these are driving me to distraction. Now, will you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I'll admit Marky is {{a perfect}} little devil. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> you to observe that she's been brave enough to eat part of her sandwich. Let's go. Where is the nice smiling little man? Let's pay our bill and go." ...|$|E
6000|$|Spencer Brydon {{recognised}} it--it {{was in fact}} what he {{had absolutely}} professed. Yet he importantly qualified. [...] "He isn't myself. He's the just so totally other person. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> to see him," [...] he added. [...] "And I can. And I shall." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is it? I {{knew there}} was some little trouble, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not <b>want</b> to ask any questions. Your mother is {{unnecessarily}} frightened, and I have not wished to disturb her. Your sister is taking plenty of nourishment?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course," [...] he said. [...] "I had forgotten. Well, I {{want you}} to go up to him now. I want to see him, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not <b>want</b> to go to his offices. Where do you live, Winifred?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was a nice}} looking beast," [...] he said, [...] "and I {{had half}} a mind to ask them what they would take to {{exchange}} him with my roan, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not <b>want</b> to dip further into my purse." ...|$|R
6000|$|She stared hard at her finger-nails. [...] "It is hard {{to express}} one's self, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> {{to be honest with}} you. When I promised to marry you I thought I could; I thought it was a {{possible}} arrangement. I did think it could be done. I admired your chivalry. I was grateful." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> a quart measure," [...] said Mattie, in her sweet, {{unchanged}} voice, [...] "but all in good time. You {{must stay}} and have tea with me, Jed. I'm all alone now--Mother and Father have gone. Unhitch your horse {{and put him}} in the third stall in the stable." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I don't {{think the}} little we should spend would do any good. We've each got a dollar, {{and the army}} wouldn't be much helped by our giving that. I agree not to expect {{anything}} from Mother or you, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> to buy Undine and Sintran for myself. I've wanted it so long," [...] said Jo, who was a bookworm.|$|E
6000|$|... "Louise, {{very soon}} we shall know. Until then I will say nothing. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not <b>want</b> you {{altogether}} {{to forget that}} there has been something in my life dearer to me even than my career for these last few years." ...|$|R
5000|$|U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, {{who said}} that she had spoken a number of times with Karzai in recent days, {{announced}} that Karzai would be making an announcement the next day, saying [...] "He is going to announce his intentions ... <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>dont</b> <b>want</b> to pre-empt in any way President Karzais statement, which will set the stage for how we go forward in the next stage of this." [...] An unnamed diplomatic source also said that Karzai would be making a nationwide address flanked by U.S. Senator John Kerry and U.N. Special Representative to Afghanistan Kai Eide, and claimed that Karzai was prepared to make concessions, such as forming a power-sharing coalition or agreeing to a run-off.|$|R
5000|$|... "It is sad, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> {{believe this}} is the way Jean would have wanted it. I have, of course, had offers, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not <b>want</b> Jean's name to fall into the wrong hands and be mis-used. That would be horrendous and she would have hated it." ...|$|R
