25|$|The storage {{condition}} of the <b>bottled</b> <b>wine</b> will influence a wine's aging. Vibrations and heat fluctuations can hasten a wine's deterioration and cause adverse effect on the wines. In general, a wine has a greater potential to develop complexity and more aromatic bouquet if it is allowed to age slowly in a relatively cool environment. The lower the temperature, the more slowly a wine develops. On average, the rate of chemical reactions in wine double with each 18°F (8°C) increase in temperature. Wine expert Karen MacNeil recommends keeping wine intended for aging in a cool area with a constant temperature around 55°F (13°C). Wine can be stored at temperatures as high as 69°F (20°C) without long term negative effect. Professor Cornelius Ough of the University of California, Davis believes that wine could be exposed to temperatures as high as 120°F (49°C) {{for a few hours}} and not be damaged. However, most experts believe that extreme temperature fluctuations (such as repeated transferring a wine from a warm room to a cool refrigerator) would be detrimental to the wine. The ultra-violet rays of direct sunlight should also be avoided because of the free radicals that can develop in the wine and result in premature oxidation.|$|E
2500|$|Even if the {{temperatures}} do not reach extremes, temperature variation alone can also damage <b>bottled</b> <b>wine</b> through oxidation. All corks allow some leakage of air (hence old wines become increasingly oxidized), and temperature fluctuations will vary the pressure differential between {{the inside and}} outside of the bottle and will act to [...] "pump" [...] air into the bottle at a faster rate than will occur at any temperature strictly maintained.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{wines are}} {{packaged}} in thick plastic bags within corrugated fiberboard boxes, and are called [...] "box wines", or [...] "cask wine". Tucked inside {{the package is}} a tap affixed to the bag in box, or bladder, that is later extended by the consumer for serving the contents. Box wine can stay acceptably fresh {{for up to a}} month after opening because the bladder collapses as wine is dispensed, limiting contact with air and, thus, slowing the rate of oxidation. In contrast, <b>bottled</b> <b>wine</b> oxidizes more rapidly after opening because of the increasing ratio of air to wine as the contents are dispensed; it can degrade considerably in a few days.|$|E

2500|$|Refermentation, {{sometimes}} called secondary fermentation, {{is caused by}} yeasts refermenting the residual sugar present within <b>bottled</b> <b>wine.</b> It occurs when sweet wines are bottled in non-sterile conditions, allowing the presence of microorganisms. The most common yeast to referment wine is the standard wine fermentation yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but has also been attributed to Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Zygosaccharomyces bailii. The main issues associated with the fault include turbidity (from yeast biomass production), excess ethanol production (may violate labelling laws), slight carbonation, and some coarse odours. Refermentation can be prevented by bottling wines dry (with residual sugar levels <1.0g/L), sterile filtering wine prior to bottling, or adding preservative chemicals such as dimethyl dicarbonate.

40|$|Issue: A {{successful}} {{program for}} re-washing recycled glass containers {{for use in}} applications such as <b>wine</b> <b>bottling</b> depends on overcoming a number of challenges, including developing collection infrastructure, sorting diverse bottle streams, achieving efficient washing, and market penetration. Bottle washing programs may focus {{on a variety of}} bottle types, including beer <b>bottles,</b> <b>wine</b> <b>bottles,</b> or juice bottles. This Best Practice focuses on the key elements of a wine bottle-washing program, although many of the concepts are applicable to other containers. A successful bottle-washing program requires the integration of collection and supply infrastructure, sorting protocols, and equipment selection. Best Practice: Historically, bottles were manufactured to heavy specifications as returnables. Today, most glass containers are manufactured as one-way containers, not intended to withstand the rigors of multiple re-washings. <b>Wine</b> <b>bottles</b> remain an exception. <b>Wine</b> <b>bottles</b> manufactured in the United States generally have the same weight as those manufactured in Europe, where washing <b>wine</b> <b>bottles</b> is a common procedure. Because it contains a non-pressurized liquid, a <b>wine</b> <b>bottle</b> does not have the same potential to break from pressure, as does a defective container of beer or soda. However, the development of coated glass bottles may lead to lighter weight <b>wine</b> <b>bottles</b> as well. In addition, only regions with an adequate wine production industry are potential locations for <b>wine</b> <b>bottle</b> washing facilities. Finally, <b>wine</b> <b>bottles</b> wholesale for 35 ¢- 40 ¢each, while beer bottles cost only about 10 ¢, so washing may be more economically feasible for <b>wine</b> <b>bottles.</b> The collection of bottles must be structured to maximize the recovery of usable containers.
