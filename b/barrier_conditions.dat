5000|$|Antecedent <b>barrier</b> <b>conditions</b> {{combined}} {{with changes in}} the balance between marine and fluvial processes results in shifts between a variety of morphological states in a hapua or river-mouth lagoon on a MSG beach. Marine processes includes the direction of wave approach, wave height and the coincidence of storm waves with high tides. [...] Marine processes tend to dominate the majority of morphodynamic conditions {{until there is a}} large enough flood event in the associated river to breach the barrier. [...] The level and frequency of base or flood flows are attributed to fluvial processes. Antecedent <b>barrier</b> <b>conditions</b> are the permeability, volume and height of the barrier as well as the width and presence of previous outlet channels. [...] During low to medium river flows, the outlet from the lagoon to the sea becomes offset in the direction of longshore drift. [...] Outlet efficiency tends to decrease the further away from the main river-mouth the outlet is. [...] A decrease in efficiency can cause the outlet to become choked with sediment and the hapua to close temporarily. The potential for closure varies between different hapua depending on whether marine or fluvial processes are the bigger driver in the event. A high flow event; such as a fresh or flood can breach the barrier directly opposite the main river channel. [...] This causes an immediate decrease in the water level of the hapua; as well as transporting previously deposited sediments into the ocean. Flood events are important for eroding lagoon back shores; this is a behaviour which allows hapua to retreat landward and thus remain coastal landforms even with coastal transgression and sea level rise. [...] During high flow events there is also the possibility for secondary breaches of the barrier or lagoon truncation to occur.|$|E

40|$|Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) {{methods have}} {{successfully}} {{been used in}} many applications in engineering, statistics and physics. However, these are seldom used in financial option pricing literature and practice. This paper presents SMC method for pricing barrier options with continuous and discrete monitoring of the <b>barrier</b> <b>condition.</b> Under the SMC method, simulated asset values rejected due to <b>barrier</b> <b>condition</b> are re-sampled from asset samples that do not breach the <b>barrier</b> <b>condition</b> improving {{the efficiency of the}} option price estimator; while under the standard Monte Carlo many simulated asset paths can be rejected by the <b>barrier</b> <b>condition</b> making it harder to estimate option price accurately. We compare SMC with the standard Monte Carlo method and demonstrate that the extra effort to implement SMC when compared with the standard Monte Carlo is very little while improvement in price estimate can be significant. Both methods result in unbiased estimators for the price converging to the true value as 1 /√(M), where M is the number of simulations (asset paths). However, the variance of SMC estimator is smaller and does not grow with the number of time steps when compared to the standard Monte Carlo. In this paper we demonstrate that SMC can successfully be used for pricing barrier options. SMC can also be used for pricing other exotic options and also for cases with many underlying assets and additional stochastic factors such as stochastic volatility; we provide general formulas and references.

5000|$|River-mouth lagoons on mixed {{sand and}} gravel (MSG) beaches form at the river-coast {{interface}} where a typically braided, although sometimes meandering, river interacts with a coastal environment that is significantly affected by longshore drift. [...] The lagoons which form on the MSG coastlines are common {{on the east coast}} of the South Island of New Zealand and have long been referred to as hapua by the Māori. This classification differentiates hapua from similar lagoons located on the New Zealand coast termed waituna. Hapua are often located on paraglacial coastal areas where there is a low level of coastal development and minimal population density. Hapua form as the river carves out an elongated coast-parallel area, blocked from the sea by a MSG barrier which constantly alters its shape and volume due to longshore drift. [...] Longshore drift continually extends the barrier behind which the hapua forms by transporting sediment along the coast. Hapua are defined as a narrow shore-parallel extensions of the coastal riverbed. [...] They discharge the majority of stored water to the ocean via an ephemeral and highly mobile drainage channel or outlet. [...] The remainder percolates through the MSG barrier due to its high levels of permeability. Hapua systems are driven by a wide range of dynamic processes that are generally classified as fluvial or marine; changes in the balance between these processes as well as the antecedent <b>barrier</b> <b>conditions</b> can cause shifts in the morphology of the hapua, in particular the barrier.
