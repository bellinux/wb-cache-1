It is a vandal state. There is a Russian writer who once described vandal states as Genghis Khan with a telegraph. Israel is Genghis Khan with a computer. I feel no emotion of affinity with that state. I have some good friends and their families there, and of course I would not want any of them to be hurt. That said, sometimes I feel that Israel has come out of the boils (sic) of the hell, a satanic state.|$|E

The episode represents one of the first entries in the series to be written by someone from outside the main writing staff of The X-Files. Originally, the script called for Banton's shadow {{to be able to move}} independently; Carter and writer Howard Gordon rewrote the story to remove this aspect. Gilligan later noted, [...] "they rewrote the episode [...] this saved an enormous amount of money in animation costs." [...] In addition, the [...] character of X was not in the first draft of the script. However, the series staff realized that Banton's fear of having the government control him should be [...] "more than just paranoia". Thus, X was written into the story. Writer Frank Spotnitz later noted, [...] "it had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> X had done anything and the character really needed to grow." ...|$|E

Arguably Jackson's most angry, raw, emotional album, the new {{tracks on}} HIStory revealed a musician worn and torn {{by years of}} superstardom, now reportedly reacting against people who tried to bring him down. This reaction is what some people say ultimately stunted his previous skill at creating cutting edge musical trends, with Jon Pareles of The New York Times writing that [...] "It has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> Michael Jackson was simply a performer. He's the main asset of his own corporation, which is a profitable subsidiary of Sony". Some reviewers commented on the unusual format of a new studio album being accompanied by a [...] "greatest hits" [...] collection, with Q magazine saying [...] "from the new songs' point of view, it's like taking your dad with you into a fight."

[...] In addition, Lyons was not thrilled with [...] the Jenna character, reporting [...] "It's <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> we've seen Jenna do something redemptive – and I'd settle for anything not strenuously vacant and narcissistic. I get that that's her bit, but... that note is starting to drive me crazy." [...] IGN contributor Robert Canning also delivered a mixed review of the episode, writing that he laughed [...] "quite a bit" [...] but said it ultimately [...] "felt like {{it could have been}} so much more." [...] Canning also concluded his review by stating that it [...] "fell shy of being an absolute classic." [...] Writing for The Palm Beach Post Kevin D. Thompson said [...] "While last night's episode was far from unwatchable, it wasn't one of the show's best, either. But as I've written before, a so-so 30 Rock is still better than 99 percent of TV's other so-called comedies." [...] Thompson noted that he was not thrilled with the return of Dean Winters as Dennis, and called his plot with Liz and Jenna [...] "the show's least interesting plot".|$|E
500|$|According to {{the sheet}} music {{published}} by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, [...] "You and I" [...] {{is set in}} common time with a slow tempo of 60 beats per minute. It is written in the key of A major. During the song Gaga's voice spans from the notes of E3 to C5. The song begins with an A–G–A chord progression, which changes to A–Bm/A–D/A–Bm during the chorus, {{and back to the}} former chords afterwards. The opening lyrics—"It's <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> I came around/ It's been a long time, but I'm back in town/ And this time, I'm not leaving without you"—describe a whiskey-breathed lover for whom she is pining. Gil Kaufman of MTV News described it as the [...] "tune eschewed most of her dance flavor, right down to a rollicking barrel-house piano solo." [...] Her voice sounded like growling during the main verses, where she sings the lines: [...] "He said, 'Sit back down where you belong, in the corner of my bar with your high heels on, Sit back down on the couch where we made love the first time..." [...] Noting the differences between live performances of the song and the studio version, Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph observed that the piano parts were replaced mostly by [...] "fizzing synths, a stomping beat sampled from [...] "We Will Rock You", thundering electric guitars and backing vocals stacked into shimmering choral walls." [...] Kitty Empire of The Guardian described the song as an [...] "umlaut-toting digital country power ballad" [...] with two Bruce Springsteen references: [...] "born to run" [...] and Nebraska.|$|E
500|$|Several critics {{used their}} reviews to discuss Spielberg and analyze what the movie {{signified}} in his {{development as a}} filmmaker. Andrew O'Hehir of the online magazine Salon expressed excitement over the atypically hard edge of the movie. [...] "Little Steven Spielberg is all grown up now...into of all things a superior film artist...It's too early to know whether Minority Report, {{on the heels of}} A.I., marks a brief detour in Spielberg's career or a permanent change of course, but either way it's a dark and dazzling spectacle." [...] J. Hoberman of The Village Voice said it is [...] "the most entertaining, least pretentious genre movie Steven Spielberg has made in the decade since Jurassic Park." [...] Randy Shulman of Metro Weekly said that [...] "the movie is a huge leap forward for the director, who moves once and for all into the world of adult movie making." [...] Roger Ebert called the film a [...] "masterpiece" [...] and said that when most directors of the period were putting [...] "their trust in technology", Spielberg had already mastered it, and was emphasizing [...] "story and character" [...] while merely using technology as a [...] "workman uses his tools". David Edelstein of Slate echoed the positive sentiments, saying [...] "t has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> a Spielberg film felt so nimble, so unfettered, so free of self-cannibalizing." [...] Jonathan Rosenbaum, then of the Chicago Reader, was less convinced. Though he approved of the movie, he derided it in his review as a superficial action film, cautioning audiences to enjoy the movie, but not [...] "be conned into thinking that some sort of serious, thoughtful statement is being delivered along with the roller-coaster ride." ...|$|E

During the controversy one criticism was that Andrews justified his decision based on [...] "concerns raised by the community", however no official report or inquest has been tendered, leading {{to the conclusion that}} any 'concerns' were both unofficial, undocumented and most probably belonging to a racially intolerant minority. The Howard government had before used the race card in an election year to distract the voters from its other failures. This was most significant in the 2001 election with the infamous Tampa affair, in which the government was badly trailing in the polls before vilifying middle-eastern [...] "boat people". The strategy worked for the government by exploiting the underlying racist elements of Australian society. Andrews defended the system of having refugee quotas against the opinion expressed that intakes of refugees should be variated on the basis of global needs [...]" [...] In October 2007, Howard [...] "admitted breaking a promise to keep interest rates at record lows". During the 2004 campaign, Howard was also cited as giving the same promise, personally, on radio. Inflation figures released on 24 October indicated underlying inflation was higher than expected, which resulted in seven of eight financial companies believing there will be an interest rate rise when the reserve bank met in the middle of November, the first during an election campaign.|$|E

Executive producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins said: [...] "It is only right that all of Peggy Mitchell's children would be at her funeral. Danniella is the final piece of the Mitchell jigsaw puzzle, so it will be great for viewers to see Phil, Grant and Sam all back on screen. Sam will only be back for a few episodes, but these scenes are bound to go down in the soap's history." [...] While appearing on an episode of Loose Women on 24 March 2016, Westbrook expressed interest in reprising the role of Sam on a full-time basis. Westbrook returned to filming on 3 May 2016. Letitia Dean who plays Sharon Watts revealed that there would be [...] "fireworks" [...] when Sam returns. Dean revealed: [...] "Sam coming back is a shock.

But Peggy is her mum, so of course she had to be there for the funeral". She went on to say: [...] "They do have a bit of a run-in with each other and Sharon is caught out which really panics her, especially that Sam has come back and seems to be unhappy that Sharon is so involved with the Mitchells." [...] Westbrook later expressed her disappointment with Sam only appearing in four episodes in an Instagram post. [...] "It's such a shame I won't be going back to the show as I think people would of [...] loved to see Sam as a mum and with a different take on the character… But I don't write the show I just do what they tell me," [...] Westbrook went on to say: [...] "And they've done what they always do use Sam when she's needed & then send her off in a black cab.
