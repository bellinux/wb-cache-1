[...] When, on a 1974 trip to California, White House correspondent Fred Barnes pressed Ford on the matter, Ford replied in surprisingly frank manner: [...] "I just can’t <b>bring</b> <b>myself</b> to do it.” ...|$|E

[...] LTC's digitisation deliberately maintained its eccentricity and irregularity true to period printing, avoiding perfect verticals. In 1923, Morison at the British branch of Monotype thought it somewhat florid {{in comparison to the}} version of his branch which he considered a personal project, noting in a 1923 letter to American printer Daniel Berkeley Updike that [...] "I entertain very decided opinions about this latest of Mr. Goudy's achievements... a comparison leaves me with a preference for our version." [...] He added that he [...] "could not <b>bring</b> <b>myself</b> to believe" [...] that Garamond himself had cut the swash capitals that [...] "Mr. Goudy has done his best to reproduce".|$|E

500|$|Nixon did {{not reply}} to Voorhis's April debate proposal. [...] In May, the congressman wrote to Long as Nixon's {{campaign}} initially made the alleged PAC endorsement an issue. [...] Voorhis suggested that Nixon be challenged to debates {{as a matter of}} urgency. [...] Long responded in June, saying that though Nixon was known as a champion debater during his Whittier College days, [...] "with your age and experience the general public might not take kindly to your challenging a boy like Nixon". [...] Long advised awaiting a challenge from Nixon. [...] By August, the two campaigns had settled on a debate to be held before a veteran's group in Whittier on September 20. However, the [...] "Independent Voters of South Pasadena" [...] (IVSP), headed by future Voorhis biographer Paul Bullock, announced a September 13 town meeting on campaign issues at South Pasadena Junior High School. The IVSP's actual purpose in having the meeting was to get a vulnerable Republican assemblyman (who declined his invitation) to debate his Democratic rival, but Senate and 12th district Republican and Democratic candidates were invited. Given that the debate sponsors were liberals, some of Nixon's aides advised him to refuse, but he overrode them. Voorhis also accepted; when it was suggested to him later he should have sent a spokesman, he responded, [...] "I suppose so, but I just couldn't <b>bring</b> <b>myself</b> to refuse." [...] Both Senate candidates declined their invitations, with Senator Knowland sending Chotiner in his place, while Democratic candidate Will Rogers, Jr. sent Representative Chester E. Holifield of the neighboring 19th district.|$|E

5000|$|Not all reviews were positive. Holly E Ordway of DVD Talk {{disliked the}} series, stating [...] "I'd heard {{that it was}} a gripping, {{intelligent}} series that told great spy-thriller stories with gritty realism ... Well, it seems Spooks and I are not meant to be together; I bounced off the show on the very first episode and never succeeded afterwards in <b>bringing</b> <b>myself</b> to like it any better." [...] Ordway further felt it was [...] "poorly acted", the rapid cuts and frantic editing [...] "doesn't work" [...] to make it more entertaining, and that the attempts for complexity were [...] "painful".|$|R

2500|$|Cardinale, {{one of two}} Republicans {{to oppose}} Farber's nomination, {{said that he was}} {{concerned}} about the state appointing someone who had been repeatedly accused of breaking traffic laws as its top law enforcement official. [...] "Your record taken in its totality does not support the notion that you have respect for the law," [...] he said. Later, he said that approving Farber's nomination might send a message [...] "to young people, to the whole population of the state of New Jersey, that it's O.K. to offend the law repeatedly time after time.

2500|$|Frankfurter took {{exception}} {{to the extent to}} which his brethren had agreed with the studios that the District Court had not adequately explored the underlying facts in affirming the consent decree. He pointed to another recent Court decision, International Salt Co. v. United States that lower courts are the proper place for such findings of fact, to be deferred to by higher courts. Also, he reminded the Court that the District Court had spent fifteen months considering the case and reviewed almost 4,000 pages of documentary evidence: [...] "I cannot <b>bring</b> <b>myself</b> to conclude that the product of such a painstaking process of adjudication as to a decree appropriate for such a complicated situation as this record discloses was an abuse of discretion." [...] He would have modified the District Court decision only to permit the use of arbitration to resolve disputes.|$|E
2500|$|At {{a meeting}} at the War Office (4 November 1913), Wilson told French, who had {{recently}} been asked by the King for his views, that he for one “could not fire on the north at the dictates of Redmond” and that “England qua England is opposed to Home Rule, and England must agree to it … I cannot <b>bring</b> <b>myself</b> to believe that Asquith will be so mad as to employ force”. It is unclear what Wilson meant by [...] "England qua England", although he did believe that the Government should be forced to fight a General Election on the issue, which on the basis of recent by-elections the Conservatives might win. Each side thought the other was bluffing. French, whom Wilson urged to tell the King that he could not depend on the loyalty of the whole of the Army, was unaware that Wilson was leaking the contents of these meetings to the Conservative leader Bonar Law.|$|E

But not only the lapse of time, twenty-four long years, take away from all its effect; it is no longer the anxious desire that the name of so much virtue should not be obliterated; that it should ever be present to the world: a variety of intervening circumstances have altered {{the very nature of the}} thing, and under existing ones I must become myself a bar to the revival of his title—would it be for his honour—can I by any stretch of the imagination, <b>bring</b> <b>myself</b> to conceive, that I am reviving his dignity in the peerage when I am placing it at the tail of a Marquess of Sligo etc. etc. ...
