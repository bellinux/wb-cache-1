40|$|In this study, a {{comprehensive}} set of transit, intermodal and multimodal assignment models (FAST-TrIPs) is developed for transportation planning and operations purposes. The core {{part of the}} models is a schedule-based transit assignment with capacity constraint and <b>boarding</b> <b>priority.</b> The problem is defined to model the system performance dynamically by {{taking into account the}} scheduled transit service and to model user behavior more realistically by taking into account capacity of transit vehicles and <b>boarding</b> <b>priority</b> <b>for</b> passengers arriving early to a stop or a transfer point. An optimization model is proposed for both deterministic and stochastic models, which includes a penalty term in the objective function to model the <b>boarding</b> <b>priority</b> constraint. The stochastic model is proposed based on logit route choice with flexibility on the level of stochasticity in route choice. Optimality conditions show that the models are consistent with network equilibrium and user behavior. An extension of the optimization models is proposed for multimodal assignment problem, in which the transit and auto networks interact dynamically. To solve the proposed models, since the penalty term is non-linear and makes the model an asymmetric nonlinear optimization model with side constraints, a simulation-based approach is developed. The solution method incorporates the path assignment models and a mesoscopic transit passenger simulation in conjunction with Dynamic Traffic Assignment (DTA) models. The simulation model can capture detailed activities of transit passengers and determines the nonlinear penalty explicitly by reporting passengers' failure to board experience. Therefore, the main problem can be solved iteratively, by solving a relaxed problem and simulating the transit network in each iteration, until the convergence criterion is met. The relaxed problem is a path generation model and can be either a shortest/least-cost path or a logit-based hyperpath in the schedule-based transit network. An efficient set of path models are developed using Google's General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) files, taking into account the transit network hierarchy for computational efficiency of the model. A multimodal assignment model is also developed by integration of the proposed transit assignment model with DTA models. The model is based on simulation and is able to capture the effect of transit and auto mode on each other through an iterative solution method and feedback loop from the transit assignment model to the DTA models. In the multimodal assignment model, more realistic transit vehicle trajectories are generated in the DTA models and are used for assigning transit passengers to transit vehicles. In an application of the multimodal assignment, intermodal tours are modeled considering the timing of auto trips and transit connections, the schedule-based transit network, and the constraint on park-n-ride choice in a tour. The model can simulate the transit, auto, and intermodal tours together with high resolution and realistic user behavior...|$|R

40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the implementation of}} a web-based e-portfolio into nonmedical prescribing (NMP) modules at the University of Huddersfield. The e-portfolio adopted has all the elements of the former paper-based document. A key advantage of implementing an e-portfolio is the contribution it makes to the National Information <b>Board’s</b> (2015) digital <b>priorities</b> <b>for</b> health and social care. The e-portfolio can equip NMP students, as part of the wider health-care workforce, with digital skills and knowledge that are appropriate to their role and also their impending prescribing role. Adopting an e-portfolio within the NMP modules has brought many benefits, including strengthened assessment methods in terms of authenticity, reliability and mentor preparation. The main challenges experienced were related to the IT literacy and skills of participants, as well as computer or internet access issues in the workplace. These challenges were similar to those faced by Moule et al (2011). The module team overcame these issues through continual review of the assessment strategies being deployed and the functionality of the e-portfolio...|$|R

40|$|Scientists aboard French {{purse seine}} vessels {{recorded}} {{the number and}} condition of silky sharks (Carcharhinus falciformis) caught during three fishing cruises in the Indian Ocean. A sample of 31 individuals that showed signs of life were tagged with satellite tags to investigate their postrelease mortality. The majority of individuals (95 %) were brought on board using the brailer. Combining the proportion of sharks that were dead (72 %) and the mortality rate of those released (48 %), the overall mortality rate of brailed individuals was 85 %. Few individuals (5 %) were not brailed as they were entangled and landed during the hauling process. The survival rate of these individuals was high, with an overall mortality rate of meshed individuals of 18 %. The combination of these two categories led to an overall mortality rate of 81 %. This high value reflects the harsh conditions encountered by sharks during the purse seine fishing process. Consequently, methods that prevent sharks being brought on <b>board</b> are a <b>priority</b> <b>for</b> future investigations, but good handling practices should also be promoted as they could reduce mortality by at least 19 %...|$|R
50|$|Aircraft often {{operate with}} a minimum set of {{optional}} equipment, further reducing costs of acquisition and maintenance, as well as keeping {{the weight of the}} aircraft lower and thus saving fuel. Ryanair seats do not recline and do not have rear pockets, to reduce cleaning and maintenance costs. Others have no window shades. Pilot conveniences, such as ACARS, may be excluded. Often, no in-flight entertainment systems are made available, though many US low-cost carriers do offer satellite television or radio in-flight. It is also becoming a popular approach to install LCD monitors onto the aircraft and broadcast advertisements on them, coupled with the traditional route-altitude-speed information. Most do not offer reserved seating, hoping to encourage passengers to board early and quickly, thus decreasing turnaround times. Some allow <b>priority</b> <b>boarding</b> <b>for</b> an extra fee instead of reserved seating, and some allow reserving a seat in an emergency exit row (for longer leg room) at an extra cost.|$|R

40|$|Poor {{management}} of post-operative acute pain {{can contribute to}} medical complications including pneumonia, deep vein thrombosis, infection and delayed healing, {{as well as the}} development of chronic pain. It is therefore important that all patients undergoing surgery should receive adequate pain management. However, evidence suggests this is not currently the case; between 10 % and 50 % of patients develop chronic pain after various common operations, and one recent US study recorded > 80 % of patients experiencing post-operative pain. At the first meeting of the acute chapter of the Change Pain Advisory <b>Board,</b> key <b>priorities</b> <b>for</b> improving post-operative pain management were identified in four different areas. Firstly, patients should be more involved in decisions regarding their own treatment, particularly when fateful alternatives are being considered. For this to be meaningful, relevant information should be provided so they are well informed about the various options available. Good physician/patient communication is also essential. Secondly, better professional education and training of the various members of the multidisciplinary pain management team would enhance their skills and knowledge, and thereby improve patient care. Thirdly, there is scope for optimizing treatment. Examples include the use of synergistic analgesia to target pain at different points along pain pathways, more widespread adoption of patient-controlled analgesia, and the use of minimally invasive rather than open surgery. Fourthly, organizational change could provide similar benefits; introducing acute pain services and increasing their availability towards the 24 hours/day ideal, greater adherence to protocols, increased use of patient-reported outcomes, and greater receptivity to technological advances would all help to enhance performance and increase patient satisfaction. It must be acknowledged that implementing these recommendations would incur a considerable cost that purchasers of healthcare may be unwilling or unable to finance. Nevertheless, change is under way and the political will exists for it to continue. status: publishe...|$|R
