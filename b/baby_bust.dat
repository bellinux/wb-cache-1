5000|$|At {{the mature}} stages of his {{intellectual}} life, {{he came to}} take particular interest in population policies. Inspired by the classical economist John Stuart Mill, he advocates for stationary population as an optimal response to the quest for ecological and economic sustainability, national identity, social cohesion and world peace. Western democracies, in particular, {{are faced with a}} unique set of challenges arising out of the prevailing imbalance between fertility and immigration. Hence, in order to actualize the benefits of a stationary demographic configuration, they need to raise their fertility to the generational replacement level. In respect to the doctrinal debates, the virtue of the stationary population is that it cuts across ecologists’ long-term concerns and economists’ short term concerns. [...] Dr. Romaniuk’s outlook of the Western European civilization is rather pessimistic, Spenglerian. Under the guise of multiculturalism, new “instant, artificial societies” are erected, purely based on formal citizenship, thus superseding the notion of the historical nation taking centuries to evolve into a nationally conscious community of peoples. Europe of the 20th century had a disastrous record of failed attempts to create instantaneously man-made new types of societies, inspired by either classless society or racist ideologies. While singling out national identity as an issue, no intent is implied therein of elevating nationhood to the sacrosanct to be forever locked and frozen in time. Nor would he suggest closing the gates to the transnational movement of people. Not all is wrong with multiculturalism, he argues. Respect for another’s culture is a virtue in itself. Diasporas, in many cases, can play a positive role in interstate relations, and in mutual enrichment through cross-fertilisation. The matter is not all-or-nothing, but that of moderation. It all boils down {{to the question of what}} the French humanist, writer and philosopher, Albert Camus, encapsulated in two words: “mesure et démesure”. Dr. Romaniuk’s book, Fertility in Canada: from Baby Boom to <b>Baby</b> <b>Bust,</b> published by Statistics Canada in 1984, deserves to be singled out for it stirred wide public debate on the future of Canada, and brought successive governments to adopt policies, particularly about immigration, to counter potential population implosion.

Osborn, from the Department of Preventive Medicine and Biostatistics of University of Toronto “Probably, all that can be said in the way of scenario for the future is that the prevailing regime among industrialized nations will be one of low and unstable fertility”, wrote Frank Trovato, whereas another Canadian demographer, Roderic Beaujot, echoes the book’s view that “procreative behaviour may be more a matter of mores than of economics”.|$|E

Using {{an extension of the}} adjusted TFR that incorporates variance changes, we show that there was no reduction in the pace of postponement of first births in Sweden during the period 1980 - 1995. Thus, the baby boom was overwhelmingly due to quantum effects, and did not have a relevant tempo component as suggested by the TFR-adjustment without variance effects. Moreover, the tempo changes duringthis period clearly reflect the implications of the policy changes in the 1980 s: while the tempo for first births remained relatively constant, the tempo at higher orders was reduced substantially after the extension of policies that favor short interbirth intervals. However, this pattern is not visible in the tempo effects without adjestment for variance effects. We therefore argue that variance effects deserve further attention in the investigation of recent fertility patterens and in the adjustment of total fertility rate. (AUTHOR) ...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the course}} of the 20 th century, the {{expansion}} of female participation in education and the gradual re-entrance of women into the labour market changed the dynamics of union formation and fertility. After the Baby Boom period, the association between wealth or social status {{on the one hand and}} fertility on the other was turned around. In the meantime, educational attainment became a key determinant of fertility. In this paper we investigate the relation between educational assortative mating and marital fertility. We focus on the fertility trends during the Baby Boom and subsequent <b>Baby</b> <b>Bust,</b> which have been shown to be related to changes in marriage patterns. More particularly, we investigate how changes in the timing and quantum of marital fertility were related to the changing combination of his and her educational attainment. We adopt a couple-oriented approach and use retrospective Belgian census data with rich information on educational attainment and marriage and childbearing histories, which allows us to use event history analysis to analyse fertility of the relevant birth cohorts. Results show that couples where both partners are poorly educated experienced the highest fertility among most of the Baby Boom producing birth cohorts. Hypergamous couples (husband more educated than wife) were not far behind, and their fertility levels even exceeded the levels of the low-educated couples among some birth cohorts. Highly educated homogamous couples had slightly lower fertility than hypergamous couples. Hypogamy (husband less educated than wife) was clearly associated with lower fertility, even among the younger cohorts.

40|$|This paper explores whether {{changes in}} the age {{distribution}} have significant effects on financial markets that are rational and forward-looking. It presents a stationary overlapping generations model in which agents save for retirement while working, making a portfolio decision over risky equity and riskless bonds in zero net supply. The model features only aggregate uncertainty, a technology shock to production and random population growth, and is solved numerically using the parameterized expectations approach (PEA) following Den Haan and Marcet (1990). The methodology of Den Haan and Marcet (1994) is {{used to test the}} accuracy of the solution. Although agents' degree of risk aversion is constant over time, they invest as if increasingly risk averse with age: young workers short the riskless asset in order to hold equity, while old workers hold mostly the riskless asset. This portfolio behavior stems from an implicit holding of a nontradable asset, human capital. Using the PEA solution to simulate a <b>baby</b> boom-baby <b>bust</b> reveals that the return differential between equity and bonds rises significantly when boom turns to bust. At this point a large cohort of old workers trades with a smaller cohort of young workers, resulting in excess demand for the riskless asset, which pushes down the riskfree rate relative to the return on equity. There is thus cohort-specific demographic risk in financial markets that are rational and forward-looking, with returns to baby boomers significantly below steady state returns. The paper also demonstrates that a simple pay-as-you-go pension scheme fails to insure agents against this cohort-specific risk, concluding that only government can insure agents against it, by varying borrowing over time and thereby making transfers of wealth across non-overlapping generations. An appendix solves the model using a "projection" PEA, which uses a nonlinear equation solver to find the coefficients at which the approximating function equals the numerically computed conditional expectation. It compares the efficiency and accuracy of this solution method to that of the Monte Carlo PEA. ...|$|R

Indeed, our main results show that the proposed mathematical models result in power law distributions under quite general polynomial Gärtner-Ellis conditions, the generality of which could explain the ubiquitous nature of power law distributions. In addition, on a logarithmic scale, we establish an asymptotic equivalence between the reflected branching processes and the corresponding multiplicative ones. The latter, as recognized by Goldie (1991) [32], is known to be dual to queueing/additive processes. We emphasize this duality further in the generality of stationary and ergodic processes...|$|R
40|$|What {{caused the}} baby boom? And {{can it be}} {{explained}} {{within the context of}} the secular decline in fertility that has occurred over the last 200 years? The hypothesis is that: (a) The secular decline in fertility is due to the relentless rise in real wages that increased the opportunity cost of having children; (b) The baby boom is explained by an atypical burst of technological progress in the household sector that occurred in the middle of the last century. This lowered the cost of having children. A model is developed in an attempt to account, quantitatively, for both the <b>baby</b> boom and <b>bust.</b> (JEL E 1, J 1, 03) The fertility of American women over the last 200 years has two salient features, portrayed in Figure 1. 1 First, it has declined drastically. The average white woman bore 7 children in 1800. By 1990 this had dropped to just 2. This decline in fertility ran unabated during the 140 -year period between 1800 and 1940. Second, fertility showed a surprising recovery between the mid- 1940 s and mid- 1960 s. The upturn was large, a “baby boom. ” 2 Just how large depends upon the concept of fertility used. For example, the number of births per fecund woman increased by 41 percent between 1934 and 1959. Alternatively, the number of realized lifetime births per female was 28 percent higher for a woman born in 1932 (whose average child arrived in 1959) vis-à-vi...|$|R
