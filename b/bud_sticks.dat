The Red grapefruit, starting with the Ruby Red, has even become a symbolic fruit of Texas, where white “inferior” grapefruit were eliminated and only red grapefruit were grown for decades. Using radiation to trigger mutations, new varieties were developed to retain the red tones which typically faded to pink. The Rio Red variety is the current (2007) Texas grapefruit with registered trademarks Rio Star and Ruby-Sweet, also sometimes promoted as [...] "Reddest" [...] and [...] "Texas Choice". The Rio Red is a mutation bred variety which was developed by treatment of <b>bud</b> <b>sticks</b> with thermal neutrons. Its improved attributes of mutant variety are fruit and juice color, deeper red, and wide adaptation.|$|E

Virus and viroids have been recognized as serious problem limiting the vigor, yield and quality of citrus. These diseases are graft transmissible through infected <b>bud</b> <b>sticks.</b> So, obtained of disease-free plants is imperative to provide certified microscions to the growers and to encourage the planting of grafts instead of seedlings. Micrografting is one of virus-free plant production methods, but, it is complex and its successful percent is low especially it is followed by acclimatization stage. Our paper is the first one to examine producing virus-free microscions via in vitro propagation of vegetative nucellar embryos and examine in vitro treatments which may affect microshoots propagation and successful of grafting the in vitro producing microscions on volkamariana rootstock in greenhouse. Firstly, the sexual nucellar embryo was determined using RAPD marke...|$|E

Again, the Englishman will {{sacrifice}} {{everything to}} comfort, {{and will not}} only take great pains to secure it, but he has generally also the power of doing so: for the English peasant is, on the average, wealthier than the French. The French peasant has no idea of comfort, and therefore makes no effort to secure it. The difference {{in the character of}} their inhabitants is, as we have seen, written on the fronts of their respective cottages. The Englishman is, also, fond of display; but the ornaments, exterior and interior, with which he adorns his dwelling, however small it may be, are either to show the extent of his possessions, or to contribute to some personal profit or gratification: they never seem designed for the sake of ornament alone. Thus, his wife's love of display is shown by the rows of useless crockery in her cupboard; and his own by the rose tree at the front door, from which he may obtain an early <b>bud</b> to <b>stick</b> in the buttonhole of his best blue coat on Sundays: the honeysuckle is cultivated for its smell, the garden for its cabbages. Not so in France. There, the meanest peasant, with an equal or greater love of display, embellishes his dwelling as much as lies in his power, solely for the gratification of his feeling of what is agreeable to the eye. The gable of his roof is prettily shaped; the niche at its corner is richly carved; the wooden beams, if there be any, are fashioned into grotesque figures; and even the [...] "air négligé" [...] and general dilapidation of the building tell a thousand times more agreeably to an eye accustomed to the picturesque, than the spruce preservation of the English cottage.|$|R
40|$|Due to its environmental, safety, {{health and}} {{socio-economic}} impacts, marine litter {{has been recognized}} as a 21 st century global challenge, so {{that it has been}} included in Descriptor 10 of the EU MSFD. For its morphological features and anthropogenic pressures, the Adriatic Sea is very sensitive to the accumulation of debris, but data are inconsistent and fragmented. This thesis, in the framework of DeFishGear project, intents to assess marine litter on beaches and on seafloor in the Western Adriatic sea, and test if debris ingestion by fish occurs. Three beaches were sampled during two surveys in 2015. Benthic litter monitoring was carried out in the FAO GSA 17 during fall 2014, using a rapido trawl. Litter ingestion was investigated through gut contents analysis of 260 fish belonging to 8 commercial species collected in Western Gulf of Venice. Average litter density on beaches was 1. 5 items/m 2 during spring, and decreased to 0. 8 items/m 2 in summer. Litter composition was heterogeneous and varied among sites, even if no significant differences were found. Most of debris consisted of plastic sheets, fragments, polystyrene pieces, mussels nets and cottons <b>bud</b> <b>sticks,</b> showing that sources are many and include aquaculture, land-based activities and local users of beaches. Average density of benthic litter was 913 items/Km 2 (82 Kg/Km 2). Plastic dominated in terms of numbers and weight, and consisted mainly of bags, sheets and mussel nets. The highest density was found close to the coast, and sources driving the major differences in litter distribution were mussel farms and shipping lanes. Litter ingestion occurred in 47...|$|E
