50|$|A <b>bespoke</b> <b>portfolio</b> is a {{table of}} {{reference}} securities. A <b>bespoke</b> <b>portfolio</b> may serve as the reference portfolio for a synthetic CDO arranged by an investment bank and selected by a particular investor or for that investor by an investment manager.|$|E
5000|$|Part of {{the problem}} lies in {{calibrating}} tranches on a <b>bespoke</b> <b>portfolio</b> to observable data generated from credit index tranche prices. Matching a <b>bespoke</b> <b>portfolio</b> to a credit index can be extremely subjective. Rajan, McDermott and Roy discussed the problem and its possible solution: [...] "... we have no insight into {{the value of a}} tranche that spans, for example, part of two index attachment points ... by being able to relate correlation skews across a range of portfolios through their risk characteristics and maturities, one can price and hedge customized tranches of bespoke portfolios." [...] However, it is extremely difficult to obtain certainty as to the correlation skew appropriate to a given <b>bespoke</b> <b>portfolio.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{overall volume}} of CDOs on bespoke {{portfolios}} rose {{rapidly in the}} early 2000s. In 1999, synthetic CDO issuance in total was less than $10 billion. 2005 issuance of <b>bespoke</b> <b>portfolio</b> tranches was cited by Rajan, McDermott and Roy as $294 billion.|$|E
50|$|Also, arrangers like CDOs on <b>bespoke</b> <b>portfolios</b> {{because they}} are {{relatively}} easy to set up. Traditional CDOs take {{three to six months}} to arrange and typically cost $2 to $4 million in legal, rating and marketing costs, whereas single tranches on <b>bespoke</b> <b>portfolios</b> can be arranged in four to six weeks and upfront costs are typically less than $500,000.|$|R
5000|$|The {{aforementioned}} 2005 Banque de France report {{pointed out}} that CDO tranche issuance referencing <b>bespoke</b> <b>portfolios</b> [...] "may {{have a major impact}} on credit spreads due to their leverage". Because CDO tranches on <b>bespoke</b> <b>portfolios</b> could have very narrow spreads between their attachment and detachment points - far less than the 3% to 5% thickness on index tranche products - they could be far more leveraged, meaning that a small movement in credit default swap spreads could cause a very large change in the value of CDO tranches linked to <b>bespoke</b> <b>portfolios.</b> This in turn meant that changes in observed correlations on index tranches caused very large scale buying of CDS protection by swaps dealers during the financial crisis, increasing instability and illiquidity.|$|R
50|$|CDO tranches {{linked to}} <b>bespoke</b> <b>portfolios</b> {{continued}} to trade after {{the financial crisis}} of 2007-08 but in considerably reduced amounts.|$|R
50|$|A {{synthetic}} CDO can {{be structured}} as a swap between an investor and an arranger, {{in which case}} the investor does not need to fund the purchase of the synthetic CDO notes. The majority of <b>bespoke</b> <b>portfolio</b> linked CDOs, however, are embedded into credit-linked notes that are purchased by the investor.|$|E
5000|$|As {{mentioned}} above, the {{key advantage}} to investors {{was that it}} allowed them to specify the reference securities in the <b>bespoke</b> <b>portfolio</b> {{as well as the}} tranche's attachment and detachment points and other characteristics. A report from the Banque de France stated that: [...] "this avoids some of the dangers of traditional CDO structures, such as the risks of moral hazard or adverse selection in the choice of the names in the portfolio ...".|$|E
50|$|Initially, bespoke {{portfolios}} referenced in most synthetic CDOs were static, {{meaning that}} the list of reference securities would change only because of default, because of a succession event, or because of the disappearance of a reference security or its issuer. From 2004 onwards, managed transactions were also issued. Managed bespoke portfolios are those where a third party investment manager is appointed to select the <b>bespoke</b> <b>portfolio</b> but also {{to buy and sell}} the underlying reference securities to exploit trading opportunities or avoid credit losses.|$|E
5000|$|Because CDOs {{linked to}} <b>bespoke</b> <b>portfolios</b> are, by their nature, only held {{by one or}} {{a very small number}} of investors, there is no liquid market where they can be bought, sold or valued. Therefore, these CDOs are valued using {{mathematical}} models that performed poorly both before and during the financial crisis. [...] Subsequently banking industry regulators have pointed out concerns applicable to CDO tranches on <b>bespoke</b> <b>portfolios</b> that exceed even the regulators' concerns about index-based tranches (which are referred to as [...] "standardized products" [...] in regulatory literature). The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision's Regulatory Consistency Assessment Programme tested banks' internal models to identify the factors [...] "contributing to the observed variability in trading book RWAs". [...] "Bespoke products" [...] were found to [...] "exhibit much larger variability than standardised products" [...] with respect to value at risk dispersion.|$|R
5000|$|A {{key reason}} for this was the {{correlation}} characteristics of <b>bespoke</b> <b>portfolios,</b> which by their nature were unique to the specific portfolio and inherently unobservable in the markets. Brigo, Pallavicini and Torresetti summed up the problem in their 2010 book as follows: [...] "Bespoke corporate pools have no data from which to infer default [...] "correlation" [...] and dubious mapping methods are used." ...|$|R
5000|$|According to {{researchers}} at Joseph L. Rotman School of Management, the [...] Tranches of nonstandard portfolios are regularly traded. These {{are referred to}} as “bespokes.” <b>Bespoke</b> <b>portfolios</b> differ in the names that are included in the portfolio, the average CDS spread for the names in the portfolio, and in the dispersion of the CDS spreads. The approach to estimating tranche spreads for a bespoke depends on its characteristics. Hull and White 2008 ...|$|R
5000|$|One {{result of}} this was that hedge funds specializing in credit {{correlation}} were able to arbitrage tranches among dealers, buying protection from one dealer and almost immediately selling it at a profit to another dealer. [...] The hedge funds would do this by specifying their own <b>bespoke</b> <b>portfolio</b> and asking 5 to 10 dealers to quote bids and offers on tranches on the portfolio, usually allowing the dealers {{only a few hours}} to quote. Often both dealers would report a first-day profit on the trade.|$|E
5000|$|A {{synthetic}} CDO is a tranche or tranches on {{a portfolio}} of credit default swaps (CDS). The portfolio could either consist of an index of reference securities, such as the CDX or iTraxx indices, or could be a <b>bespoke</b> <b>portfolio,</b> consisting of a list of reference obligations or reference entities selected by or specifically for a particular investor. Bespoke portfolios were more popular in Europe than in North America, and thus acquired the British term [...] "bespoke", implying a suit tailored for a specific customer by a London Savile Row tailor.|$|E
50|$|CPDOs {{are formed}} first by {{creating}} a SPV that issues a debt note. The SPV invests in an index of debt securities, commonly credit default swap indices such as CDX and iTraxx (in theory, this could be deal-specific, such as a <b>bespoke</b> <b>portfolio</b> of sovereign debt), similar to a CDO. The structure allows for continual adjustment of leverage such that the asset and liability spreads stay matched. In general this involves increasing leverage as when losses are taken, similar to a doubling strategy, in which one doubles one's bet at each coin toss until a win occurs.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The {{behaviour}} of {{the efficient}} frontier for CDOs of <b>bespoke</b> <b>portfolios</b> is investigated under one-factor copula marginal distributional assumptions. This {{approach has been}} thoroughly used in statistical literature. The main feature of these models is that default events, conditional on some latent state variable, are independent. This eases the computation of the aggregate loss distribution, a crucial element in credit portfolio optimisation. Both Gaussian and Clayton copula models are applied to the default dependence structure. The Clayton copula model demonstrates superiority in capturing the default dependence inherent in credit portfolios. The portfolio optimisation problem set-up under the newly defined Copula Marginal Expected Tail Loss (abbreviated as CMETL) risk measure is convex and can be easily solved in terms of linear programming algorithms. Numerical analysis is conducted by creating a <b>Bespoke</b> CDO collateral <b>portfolio</b> using the iTraxx Europe IG Series 5 index constituents as an illustrative example...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a robust and practical CDO valuation framework {{based on the}} application of multi-factor credit models in conjunction with weighted Monte Carlo techniques used in options pricing. The framework produces arbitrage-free prices and {{can be seen as}} an extension to the implied copula methodology of Hull and White (2006). We demonstrate the practical advantages of working through multi-factor models, rather than directly on a common hazard rate (or a set of them), to value consistently CDOs of <b>bespoke</b> <b>portfolios,</b> CDO-squared and cash CDOs. The multi-factor credit models which determine the codependence of obligor defaults are defined generally within the mathematical construction of Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs). The implied copula approach {{can be seen as a}} special case of a GLMM, as are other common credit portfolio models. For a given model, the quoted prices of various credit portfolio instruments, such as CDO tranches, are used to imply the “risk-neutral ” distributions (or processes) for the underlying systematic risk factors...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a new semi-parametric {{approach to the}} pricing and risk management of bespoke CDO tranches, with a particular attention to bespokes {{that need to be}} mapped onto more than one reference portfolio. The only user input in our framework is a multi-factor model (a "prior" model hereafter) for index portfolios, such as CDX. NA. IG or iTraxx Europe, that are chosen as benchmark securities for the pricing of a given bespoke CDO. Parameters of the prior model are fixed, and not tuned to match prices of benchmark index tranches. Instead, our calibration procedure amounts to a proper reweightening of the prior measure using the Minimum Cross Entropy method. As the latter problem reduces to convex optimization in a low dimensional space, our model is computationally efficient. Both the static (one-period) and dynamic versions of the model are presented. The latter can be used for pricing and risk management of more exotic instruments referencing <b>bespoke</b> <b>portfolios,</b> such as forward-starting tranches or tranche options, and for calculation of credit valuation adjustment (CVA) for bespoke tranches. ...|$|R
50|$|In a <b>bespoke</b> <b>portfolio</b> transaction, the {{investor}} chooses or agrees {{to the list}} of reference entities, the rating of the tranche, maturity of the transaction, coupon type (fixed or floating), subordination level, type of collateral assets used etc. Typically the objective is to create a debt instrument where the return is significantly higher than comparably rated bonds. In a nutshell, a single-tranche CDO is a CDO where the arranging bank does not simultaneously place the entirety of the capital structure. These CDOs are also called arbitrage CDOs because the arranging bank seeks to pay a lower return than the return available from hedging the single-tranche exposure.|$|E
50|$|Bespoke {{portfolios}} {{can have}} very different default correlation characteristics from credit indices with similar distributions of riskiness. Bespoke portfolios almost invariably have numbers of reference securities {{similar to those of}} the major credit indices - 100 to 125 reference securities - but bespoke portfolios can include reference securities that have highly correlated default probabilities, either because they are issued by different subsidiaries of the same parent company, because they include closely related but separate companies, or because the bespoke portfolios include much higher concentrations in single industries than occurs in credit indices. Determining the fair default correlations for a <b>bespoke</b> <b>portfolio</b> can be very difficult. The chart on the right shows that differences in correlation can greatly change the probability distribution of defaults and thus change the fair value of any given CDO tranche linked to a particular portfolio.|$|E
40|$|Credit {{derivatives}} {{are among}} the most criticized financial instruments in the current credit crises. Given their short history, finance professionals are still researching to discover effective ways to reduce the mark-to-market (MTM) volatility in credit derivatives, especially in turbulent market conditions. Many credit portfolios have been struggling to find out appropriate tools and techniques to help them navigate the current credit crises and hedge mark-to-market volatility in their portfolios. In this study we provide a tool kit to help reduce the pricing fluctuations in structured credit portfolios utilizing data analysis and statistical methods. In Chapter One we provide a snapshot of credit derivatives market by summarizing different types of credit derivatives; including single-name credit default swaps (CDS), market credit indices, bespoke portfolios, market index tranches, and bespoke tranches (synthetic CDOs). In Chapter Two we illustrate a method to calculate a stable hedge ratio (beta) by combining industry practices and statistical techniques. Choosing an appropriate hedge ratio is critical for funds that desire to hedge mark-to-market volatility. Many credit portfolios suffered 40 %- 80 % market value losses in 2008 and 2009 due to the mark-to-market volatility in their long positions. In this chapter we introduce ten different betas in order to hedge a long <b>bespoke</b> <b>portfolio</b> by liquid market indices. We measure the effectives of these betas by two measures: Stability and mark-to-market volatility reduction. Among all betas we present, we deduct that the following betas are appropriate to be used as hedge ratios: Implied Beta, Quarterly Regression Beta on Spread Levels, Yearly Regression Betas on Spread Levels, Up Beta, and Down Beta. In Chapter Three we analyze the risk factors that impact the MTM volatility in CDS tranches; namely Spread Risk, Correlation Risk, Dispersion Risk, and Curve Risk. We focus our analysis in explaining the risks in the equity tranche as this is the riskiest tranche in the capital structure. We show that all four risks introduced are critical in explaining MTM volatility in equity tranches. We also perform multiple regression analysis to show the correlations between different risk factors. We show that, when combined, spread, correlation, and dispersion risks are the most important risk factors in analyzing MTM fluctuations in equity tranche. Curve risk can be used as an add-on risk to further explain local instances. After understanding various risk factors that impact the MTM changes in equity tranche, we put this knowledge to work to analyze two instances in 2008 in which we experienced significant spread widening in equity tranche. Both examples show that a good understanding of the risks that drive MTM changes in CDS tranches is critical in making informed trading decisions. In Chapter Four we focus on two topics: Portfolio Stratification and Index Selection. While portfolio stratification helps us better understand the composition of a portfolio, index selection shows us which indices are more suitable in hedging long bespoke positions. In stratifying a portfolio we define Class-A as the widest credits, Class-B as the middle tier, and Class-C as the tightest credits in a credit portfolio. By portfolio stratification we show that Class-A has significant impact on the overall portfolio. We use five different risk measures to analyze different properties of the three classes we introduce. The risk measures are Sum of Spreads (SOS), Sigma/Mu, Basis Point Volatility (BPVOL), Skewness, and Kurtosis. For all risk measures we show that there is high correlation between Class-A and the whole portfolio. We also show that it is critical to monitor the risks in Class-A to better understand the spread moves in the overall portfolio. In the second part of Chapter Four, we perform analysis to find out which credit index should be used in hedging a long <b>bespoke</b> <b>portfolio.</b> We compare four credit indices for their ability to track the <b>bespoke</b> <b>portfolio</b> on spread levels and on spread changes. Analysis show that CDX. HY and CDX IG indices fits the best to hedge our sample <b>bespoke</b> <b>portfolio</b> in terms of spread levels and spread changes, respectively. Finally, we perform multiple regression analysis using backward selection, forward selection, and stepwise regression methods to find out if we should use multiple indices in our hedging practices. Multiple regression analysis show that CDX. HY and CDX. IG are the best candidates to hedge the sample <b>bespoke</b> <b>portfolio</b> we introduced...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} a primer on the hedging {{and the risk}} {{management}} of CDO tranches. It intends to provide a global perspective on the current issues and refers to research papers for modelling and mathematical details. Though the basics of the risk management within the Gaussian copula model are not discussed, we review some issues which may eventually lead to {{the decline of the}} current market approach. We consider the computation of spread sensitivities in arbitrage-free dynamic models based on affine intensities and on Markov chains. We show that the one dimensional Markov chain for the aggregate loss process may viewed as the analogue for credit markets of the local volatility model in equity derivatives markets. In such a framework, CDO tranches can be fully replicated with the credit default swap index and a risk-free asset and the corresponding deltas correspond to a “sticky implied tree model”. Hedging issues related to tranchelets on standard indices or to CDO tranches on <b>bespoke</b> <b>portfolios</b> are dealt with. We also investigate some paths for the future, including the use of credit default swaps of different maturities to cope simultaneously with default and credit spread risks, local and asymptotic hedging approaches...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} work investigates the theoretical foundations and computational aspects of constructing optimal bespoke CDO structures. Due to the evolutionary {{nature of the}} CDO design process, stochastic search methods that mimic the metaphor of natural biological evolution are applied. For efficient searching the optimal solution, the nondominating sort genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) is used, which places emphasis on moving towards the true Paretooptimal region. This {{is an essential part}} of real-world credit structuring problems. The algorithm further demonstrates attractive constraint handling features among others, which is suitable for successfully solving the constrained portfolio optimisation problem. Numerical analysis is conducted on a <b>bespoke</b> CDO collateral <b>portfolio</b> constructed from constituents of the iTraxx Europe IG S 5 CDS index. For comparative purposes, the default dependence structure is modelled via Gaussian and Clayton copula assumptions. This research concludes that CDO tranche returns at all levels of risk under the Clayton copula assumption performed better than the sub-optimal Gaussian assumption. It is evident that our research has provided meaningful guidance to CDO traders, for seeking significant improvement of returns over standardised CDOs tranches of similar rating...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a dynamic multi-portfolio default model for consistent and arbitragefree pricing synthetic CDO tranches that reference a <b>bespoke</b> <b>portfolio.</b> In order to incorporate standard tranche price information, {{we assume that}} the <b>bespoke</b> <b>portfolio</b> has name overlapping with some index portfolios. Dividing the total portfolio (parent) into non-overlapping sub-portfolios (children), and assuming homogeneity for both the parent and the children, we use a top-down dynamic default intensity model for the parent, and specify the conditional probability of default in the children given imminent default in the parent. We consider two fundamental cases which are building blocks of more complex applications: (a) the parent is an index and the bespoke is a child; and (b) the bespoke is the parent that contains one or more indices as children. When the parent is the index, the parent default process is uniquely determined independent of the children, and the child conditional default probability distribution is calibrated to the spreads of the children. When the bespoke is the parent and one or more children are indexes, we simultaneously calibrate the parent default intensity model and the child default probability to the standard tranches and child portfolio spreads. The model is designed to establish consistency between the pricing of standard tranches and the pricing of bespoke tranches. Application may include Portfolio enlargement where the bespoke tranche references a “global ” portfolio that contains “regional ” indexes as sub-portfolio. For example, tranches referencing CDX. NA. IG and iTraxx Europe. Portfolio thinning where the bespoke tranche references a sub-portfolio of an index. Combination of portfolio enlargement and thinning. For example, tranche referencing a subset of CDX and a subset of iTraxx. * Risk Management, The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation...|$|E
40|$|In 2006, the Open University Awarding Body, Faculty of Health & Social Care and the Vocational Qualifications Assessment Centre began {{exploratory}} {{discussions with}} {{health and social}} care (HSC) employers regarding {{the creation of a}} flexible programme of vocational and academic development which would seek to bridge the FE-HE divide, embed learning in the workplace rather than the classroom and facilitate progression in this field of practice. The product of these discussions was the ‘Integrated Vocational Route’ (IVR). The IVR is designed {{to meet the needs of}} support staff directly involved in the provision of health and/or social care who have higher career aspirations and employers seeking to develop those non-professional care workers in their organisation whom they believe have the greatest potential to progress to more senior roles. The original programme integrates a Level 3 HSC (Adults) National Vocational Qualification (NVQ) within the OU K 101 ‘An Introduction to Health and Social Care’ module (offering 60 credits at NQF Level 4). Successful completion of the IVR will therefore provide both a ‘Certificate of Health and Social Care’ (60 credits at NQF Level 4) and a full NVQ Level 3 HSC Adults award. HSC employer consultation and briefings in twelve UK towns and cities helped shape the IVR model and four organisations (Newcastle City Council, Northumberland, Tyne & Wear NHS Trust, Salisbury Foundation NHS Trust and Social Work Information & Interpretation Services [SWIIS] Foster Care Scotland) have been particularly influential in determining IVR design and models of delivery. One such model enables both the IVR tutor and assessor roles to be undertaken by staff within a partner organisation and tutorials to be held in the workplace. Most of the IVR learning and support materials are available online and a <b>bespoke,</b> user-friendly electronic <b>portfolio</b> has been created for the integrated NVQ. By simultaneously developing and assessing academic skills, knowledge and competence related to care practice, the IVR offers better preparation for progression to qualifying routes such as nursing and social work and scope for credit transfer. A second IVR integrating a full Level 3 HSC Children and Young People (CYP) NVQ within the K 101 module was offered for the first time in 2009. The IVR is currently being re-developed to accommodate the new vocational Diploma qualifications which replace Level 3 NVQs from 2011...|$|R
