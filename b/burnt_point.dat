5000|$|The Welsh {{name for}} Handbridge is Treboeth, meaning either [...] "the hot town" [...] or [...] "the burnt town". The latter meaning has {{traditionally}} been thought {{to suggest that the}} town was <b>burnt</b> at some <b>point</b> in its medieval history. However, research in the 21st century suggests that the settlement may have been referred to as [...] "the hot town" [...] because of its long history of metal working.|$|R

50|$|In July and August 1929 the Widgeon II {{embarked}} on HMAS Albatross for its voyage of the New Guinea area to conduct trials under tropical conditions. After arriving back in Melbourne aboard the Albatross the aircraft was {{handed over to}} the Civil Air Board. In October No. 1 Flight Training School at Point Cook was requested to determine the suitability of the Widgeon II for seaplane training. The Widgeon I had been used intermittently for flying training, however in October the Minister for Defence recommended that the Widgeon I be struck off strength since the cost of extensive overhaul and repairs could not be justified. Around 17 February the airframe of the Widgeon I was <b>burnt</b> at <b>Point</b> Cook, after logging 99 hours of flying time.|$|R
50|$|Eventually {{the trail}} tops out on 3420 ft Stoppel Point near an old wrecked plane, then drops down into Dutcher Notch {{and then back}} up to a ridge {{culminating}} in a steep ascent up Blackhead Mountain and its 3940 ft summit, then down again to Acra <b>Point,</b> <b>Burnt</b> Knob and finally Windham High Peak, the northernmost of the Catskill High Peaks. Descending leisurely to NY 23, it leaves the Catskill Park but not the Catskills, as it immediately goes over several ranges of 3000 ft peaks to Huntersfield Mountain, where NYSDEC has cut some views near the summit.|$|R
50|$|The {{area near}} the head of Austfjord (today called Sondre Igaliku) further north was also an {{important}} hub in Vatnahverfi, presumably due to its close proximity and easy access by foot or boat to Gardar about 15 km to the northwest, where the colony's bishopric and Althing parliament were located. As with Hafgrimsfjord {{there was a small}} church in Austfjord, called Undir Hofdi. A lump of heat-fused clay and glass found in the ruins of the church suggests that it was <b>burnt</b> at some <b>point,</b> as was possibly the case with larger churches in Brattahlid, Gardar, and Herjolfsnes.|$|R
50|$|Division No. 1, Subdivision G is an unorganized {{subdivision}} on the Avalon Peninsula in Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada.

50|$|Haootia quadriformis fossil was {{discovered}} from lower Fermeuse Formation of Back Cove, Bonavista Peninsula in Newfoundland. It was originally unearthed by Martin D. Brasier of the University of Oxford in 2008. However, the specimen {{was not allowed}} to be removed according to provincial law in Newfoundland, so that only a plaster cast was made. The cast (plastotype) is maintained in the collections of the Oxford University Museum of Natural History. The actual fossil specimen, or holotype, remains on the north shore of Back Cove, roughly 1.8 km NNW of Melrose town. A second, incomplete specimen was also discovered in the Trepassey Formation of <b>Burnt</b> <b>Point,</b> Bonavista Peninsula.|$|E
50|$|Fearing for Carlo's safety, Giulia burns all his {{pictures}} so that Novak {{will not be}} able to recognize him, and gives Carlo to Don Bruno, the local priest, who takes him into his orphanage. Meanwhile, the Germans leave the village, which is taken shortly afterwards by the partisans. Novak enters a school, interrupting a music lesson of Francesco's mother, and orders all Italian books to be <b>burnt.</b> From this <b>point,</b> Novak will usually whistle the song the children were singing at various parts in the movie, making it his leitmotiv. At the same time, Francesco's father is threatened by Bostjan, Novak's henchman, and is forced to leave his clinic because he is Italian.|$|R
5000|$|Kundi Paiama, Angola's Minister of State Security was demoted {{after the}} raid {{because of the}} {{security}} lapses. [...] Several infantry units were called in to guard the complex while security infrastructure within the refinery was upgraded. The Belgium operator of the refinery reckoned {{the damage to the}} refinery would be repaired in two months. [...] It was close to three months before partial production began again. Seventeen tanks had been destroyed, but the gas spheres had not exploded even though their contents <b>burnt</b> close the <b>point</b> of the explosion. The South African intelligence reckoned that $60 million of various fuel products had been lost and that the damage was worth $36.5 million.|$|R
60|$|The public, or {{as it was}} called, the “bar-room,” of the Bold Dragoon,” was {{a spacious}} apartment, lined on three sides with benches and on the fourth by fireplaces. Of the latter there were two of such size as to occupy, with their {{enormous}} jambs, the whole of {{that side of the}} apartment where they were placed, excepting room enough for a door or two, and a little apartment in one corner, which was protected by miniature palisades, and profusely garnished with bottles and glasses. In the entrance to this sanctuary Mrs. Hollister was seated, with great gravity in her air, while her husband occupied himself with stirring the fires, moving the logs with a large stake <b>burnt</b> to a <b>point</b> at one end.|$|R
5000|$|The {{origin of}} the name [...] "Burntcoat" [...] or [...] "Burncoat", as the {{community}} is sometimes named, is unknown. The derivation of the spelling of the name is also unclear. Today the village {{on the west side}} of the Noel Bay is named Burntcoat, however, the Acadians named the village on the east side of the Noel Bay [...] "Pointe Brull" [...] (i.e., <b>Burnt</b> <b>Point</b> or Burnt Coast). Perhaps the Protestant settlers who came after the exodus of the Acadians from the community confused the names for the east and west side of the Noel Bay and thought the west side of the Bay was [...] "Pointe Brull".|$|E
50|$|At Ferry Reach, on {{the north}} of Castle Harbour (an area now {{separated}} by the Causeway), <b>Burnt</b> <b>Point</b> Fort, or Ferry Point Battery (1688), and Ferry Island Fort (1790s) were built, and, much later, in 1822, a Martello Tower. The island chain across the south of Castle Harbour {{is often referred to}} as the Castle Islands. Their fortifications are the oldest surviving English New World fortifications (due primarily to their having been constructed of stone, whereas contemporary English fortifications on the North American continent were built from timber and earth). They were also the first English coastal fortifications in the New World. As a result of their historical significance, they have been made a UNESCO World Heritage Site, together with St. George's Town.|$|E
50|$|Initially, {{the strait}} was crossed by ferries. The first swing bridge {{crossing}} Lennox Passage {{to connect with}} Isle Madame was constructed beginning in 1916, and opened in 1919. The Grandique Ferry service also crossed the passage between Martinique and Louisdale. In 1970, following the grounding and subsequent breakup of the Liberian tanker Arrow in Chedabucto Bay spilling her cargo of heavy bunker C oil, the Government of Nova Scotia built a causeway between <b>Burnt</b> <b>Point</b> and Burnt Island to prevent the spilled oil from further damaging the fishing area of the Passage. Following the oil spill cleanup in the early 1970s, the old bridge was demolished and the ferry service was terminated after a new combined causeway and single-leaf bascule bridge (the Burnt Island Bridge) was built across Lennox Passage.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to explore the variability on the soil thermal conductivity -?- after a prescribe fire, and to assess the effects of the ashes on the heat transfer once it’s were incorporated into the soil matrix. Sampling plot was located in the Montgrí Massif (NE of Spain). A set of 42 soil samples between surface and 5 cm depth was collected before and after the fire. To characterize the soil chemical and physical variables were analyzed. To determine the variability on the soil λ a dry-out curve per scenario (before and after fire) was determined. SoilRho ® method based on ASTM D- 5334 - 08 which was validated by LabFerrer was used. Soil thermal conductivity has shown changes in their values. Indeed, in all moisture scenarios the values of soil λ decreased after soil was <b>burnt.</b> The critical <b>point</b> in the relationshipθ(λ) for the soil after fire which always was stronger than soil before to be burnt. Soil with “white” ashes showed a high thermal conductivity. An X-Ray diffractometry analysis allowed to clarify and to verify these results. To sum up, we could say that thermal conductivity presents changes when the scenario changes, i. e. before and after to be burnt. On the other hand, the volume of ashes incorporated on the soil increased the differences between no burnt and burnt soil, showing even some improvements on the heat transfer when water content started to govern the process...|$|R
40|$|The {{boreal forest}} {{contains}} {{almost half the}} total carbon pool of world forest ecosystems, and so has a very significant role in global biogeochemical cycles. The flux of greenhouse gases {{in and out of}} these forests is influenced strongly by disturbances such as diseases, logging and predominantly fire. It is important to quantify these disturbances to enable the modelling of major greenhouse gases. However, because of the remoteness and vastness of the boreal forest, little data is available on the type, extent, frequency and severity of these disturbances in Siberia. For burnt areas, two of the more responsive wavelengths are the short wave infra-red (SWIR) and the near infra-red (NIR). These produce a vegetation index, the normalised difference SWIR (NDSWIR) capable of detecting retrospective disturbances. Here we combine the NDSWIR from MODIS imagery acquired in the summer of 2003 with thermal anomaly data from 1992 to 2003 to detect and date areas which <b>burnt</b> at some <b>point</b> between 1992 and 2003. The semi-automated method is called SWIR and Thermal ANomalies for Detecting Disturbances (STANDD) and is complemented by an Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) differencing method using MODIS 2002 and 2003 imagery to ensure reliable detection of area burnt in the year of image acquisition (i. e. 2003). The area of this study covers approximately 3 million km 2 stretching from Lake Baikal in the south to the Laptev Sea in the north, above the Arctic Circle. Landsat ETM+ images were used to validate the shape and areal extent of the burnt areas resulting in an 81 % overall accuracy with a kappa coefficient of agreement of 0. 63...|$|R
50|$|At Ferry Reach, on {{the north}} of Castle Harbour (an area now {{separated}} by the Causeway), <b>Burnt</b> <b>Point</b> Fort, or Ferry Point Battery (in 1688), and Ferry Island Fort (in the 1790s) were built, and in 1822 a Martello Tower. Ferry Island Fort and the Martello tower were both built by the regular British Army, which had established a permanent Bermuda Garrison following US Independence (although detachments had been posted in Bermuda almost continuously since 1701). The island chain across the South of Castle Harbour (which includes Castle Island) {{is often referred to}} as the Castle Islands. Their fortifications are the oldest surviving English New World fortifications (due primarily to their being constructed of stone, whereas contemporary English fortifications on the North American continent were built from timber and earth). They were also the first English coastal fortifications in the New World. Those then existing were depicted and described in the 1624 book, The Generall Historie of Virginia, New-England, and the Summer Isles, by Captain John Smith. As a result of their historical significance, they have been made a UNESCO World Heritage Site, together with St. George's Town and other nearby fortifications, like Fort St. Catherine (UNESCO World Heritage Site: Historic Town of St George and Related Fortifications, Bermuda).|$|E
