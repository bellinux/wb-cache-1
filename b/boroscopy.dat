40|$|Optical fibers {{have been}} {{successfully}} utilized for point sensors targeting physical quantities (stress, strain, rotation, acceleration), chemical compounds (humidity, oil, nitrates, alcohols, DNA) or radiation fields (X-rays, β particles, γ-rays). Similarly, bundles of fibers have been extremely successful in imaging visible wavelengths for medical endoscopy and industrial <b>boroscopy.</b> This work presents the progress in the fabrication and experimental evaluation of multicore fiber as neutron scattering instrumentation designed to detect and image neutrons with micron level spatial resolutio...|$|E
40|$|This article {{summarizes}} {{the results obtained}} from the application of two investigation techniques, namely radar and <b>boroscopy,</b> in the masonry of the Katholikon of Dafni Monastery (Attica, Greece). The two techniques were applied with the aim to investigate the type of construction of the monument's perimeter masonry. The application of these two techniques proved to be quite efficient because their results offered reliable information regarding the thickness of stones and thus {{the thickness of the}} internal filling material in the monument's three-leaf stone masonry. This article presents and comments on difficulties encountered during the application of these techniques, as well as problems that arose during the interpretation of measurements and observations...|$|E
40|$|After an earthquake, which {{struck the}} Eastern part of Sicily in 1990, some {{structural}} {{elements of the}} Church of S. Nicolò l'Arena in Catania, as the dome and the vaults, were damaged; vertical cracks on the two pillars were detected. It {{is not clear whether}} those cracks were already visible and were simply propagating during the earthquake. It is known that the two pillars probably belong to the original construction of the church. An investigation programme (including historical research and experimental investigation with sonic, radar, flat-jack, coring, <b>boroscopy,</b> etc.) has been recently planned to design the preservation and restoration actions. The results obtained from sonic tests were compared to the results of the other type of tests in order to set up an investigation procedure useful for these cases. The paper presents and discusses the preliminary results of the research carried out by the authors...|$|E
40|$|Four hollow cathodes {{have been}} {{examined}} using <b>boroscopy,</b> scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray analysis, and X-ray diffraction analysis to characterize the life-limiting phenomena that resulted from their extended operation. The first pair of cathodes was operated for approximately 500 h in an ion thruster simulator at a 5. 0 kW-equivalent power level using different cathode activation and propellant feed-system procedures. The second pair of cathodes was the main discharge cathode and neutralizer cathode from an ion thruster which have completed an 89 -hour life-test at a 5. 5 kW power level. The greatest change to the cathode condition {{was found to be}} removal of refractory metals, primarily tungsten, and their subsequent deposition on other cathode surfaces. Barium tungstate and barium molybdate were also found in all four cathodes. Criteria for improved cathode longevity and discharge operation are proposed for use in hollow cathode and full thruster testing facilities...|$|E
40|$|This report {{presents}} the technical results, including lessons learned and recommendations, of the ESA-EUMETSAT workshop on Volcanic Ash Monitoring, {{which took place}} on 26 – 27 May 2010 at ESA/ESRIN in Frascati (Italy). 53 invited scientists from Universities, Meteorological Offices, Research Laboratories, national and international Agencies (e. g. DLR, EC, ECMWF, NASA, USGS) from Europe and the United States participated. Appenidx: A successful Falcon measurement flight was performed on 19 April 2010 for probing plumes over Germany from the Iceland Eyjafjoll volcano eruption. Layers of volcanic ash were detected by Lidar and probed in-situ with aerosol instruments. Under suitable viewing conditions, the ash layer was visible as a brownish layer to the observer. The horizontal and vertical distributions of the volcano layers were variable. In the plume layers particles larger than 3 μm were detected at concentrations, not present in the free troposphere during unpolluted conditions. The concentrations of large particles measured in the volcano layers are comparable to concentrations measured typically in Saharan dust plumes but smaller compared to particle concentrations in the polluted boundary layer. An estimation of the particle mass concentration in the volcanic ash plume probed {{as part of a}} vertical profile over Leipzig at about 4 km altitude yield 60 μg/m 3. After the flight the Falcon was inspected. So far no damages were observed including engines (after <b>boroscopy)</b> and windows. Further engine inspection is ongoing. Silver foils attached to under-wing stations showed no visible impact from volcanic ash...|$|E
