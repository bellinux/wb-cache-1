40|$|Purpose Assessing the {{recovery}} of dynamic balance after intravenous sedation in the elderly is important for ensuring their safe discharge, especially when they are walking. A reliable, simple dynamic <b>balance</b> <b>test</b> would be useful in daily clinical practice. We observed {{the recovery}} of balance after intravenous sedation with midazolam, using computerized dynamic posturography (CDP), and we evaluated {{the correlation between the}} CDP result and the results of simple dynamic <b>balance</b> <b>tests.</b> Methods Midazolam was administered in divided doses, until the Wilson sedation score reached 3, in 18 elderly male volunteers. The dynamic <b>balance</b> <b>test</b> using CDP with perturbation stimuli was performed before and after sedation. As simple dynamic <b>balance</b> <b>tests,</b> the usual-speed walking (USW) and maximum-speed walking (MSW) tests and a modified timed “up and go” (TUG) test (subjects stand up from a chair, walk 5 [*]m forward and return to the chair with MSW, and sit down again) were performed. Results The recovery times (defined as the time until the significant difference between the value at each time point and the baseline value disappeared) in the dynamic <b>balance</b> <b>test</b> (CDP), USW test, MSW test, and TUG test, were 80, 40, 80, 80 [*]min, respectively.

25|$|It is {{not clear}} whether Douds remains good case law. The Supreme Court {{distinguished}} the case but declined to overrule Douds in Dennis v. United States, 341 U.S. 494 (1951). In 1965, in United States v. Brown, 381 U.S. 437 (1965), the Supreme Court essentially overturned Douds by holding that the Taft-Hartley Act's oath constituted a bill of attainder, but did not formally do so. Two years later, in United States v. Robel, 389 U.S. 258 (1967), the Court specifically declined to apply a <b>balancing</b> <b>test</b> to a law prohibiting members of the Communist Party from holding jobs in the defense industry. Although the law was based on the same rationale as Taft-Hartley (that membership in the Communist Party was a sure indication of future action), the Supreme Court said this was too heavy an infringement on the individual's First Amendment rights. Instead, the Court seemed to suggest a new, two-part test: Whether the governmental interests advanced are valid, and whether the statute is narrowly drawn to infringe on First Amendment rights in the most narrow way. The Court returned to the <b>balancing</b> <b>test</b> in Brandenberg v. Ohio, 395 U.S. 444 (1969), but this time concluded that prohibiting mere advocacy of violence was too heavy a burden on the First Amendment. Such advocacy must produce imminent action for the speech to be punishable, the Court held.|$|E

40|$|Background: For allied health {{professionals}} wishing {{to assess the}} functional balance of older adults living in the community, the vast number of functional <b>balance</b> <b>tests</b> available {{makes it difficult to}} decide which assessment is most appropriate. Objective: To identify the reliability, concurrent validity and clinical practicality of functional <b>balance</b> <b>tests</b> with community dwelling older adults. Methods: A systematic review of published literature relevant to 17 functional <b>balance</b> <b>tests</b> was undertaken. The 17 functional <b>balance</b> <b>tests</b> were identified by a preliminary literature search and through consultation with an expert in the field of functional balance assessment. Studies published in English before January 2007, assessing the use of these functional <b>balance</b> <b>tests</b> with community dwelling adults aged 65 years or above were included. The CINAHL, MEDLINE, Ageline, Amed, PubMed, Cochrane library, PEDro and Joanna Briggs Institute databases were searched. The methodological quality of studies was assessed using a checklist criteria adapted from the Cochrane Working Group for Screening and Diagnostic Tests. Results: Eight databases were searched and 21 studies were included. The majority of studies demonstrated low to moderate methodological quality scores. Despite limitations reported for clinical application with community dwelling older adults, the Berg Balance Scale and the Timed Up and Go Test have been most rigorously tested. Reliability and concurrent validity of the Balance Screening Tool and the Fullerton Advanced Balance Scale had also been established in this population, however only one study was retrieved for each.
