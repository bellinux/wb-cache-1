40|$|A scheme {{with two}} superconducting RF {{cavities}} (sc-cavities) {{is designed to}} upgrade electron storage rings with odd buckets into multi-length bunches. In this paper, Hefei Light Source II (HLS II) is given as an example for odd buckets. In accordance with 45 buckets, which is multiples of 3, three different length <b>of</b> <b>bunches</b> generated simultaneously is proposed in the presently applied user optics. The final result is to, without low-alpha optics, fill HLS II with long <b>bunches</b> <b>of</b> 50 ps length, medium <b>bunches</b> <b>of</b> 23 ps and short <b>bunches</b> <b>of</b> 6 ps. Each third buckets can be filled with short <b>bunches,</b> <b>of</b> which the current limit is up to 6. 6 mA, more than 60 times the value of low-alpha mode. Moreover, particles tracking about beam dynamics performed by ELEGANT and calculations about beam instabilities are presented in this paper...|$|R
