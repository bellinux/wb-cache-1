5|$|There was a {{movement}} {{in the late nineteenth}} century to interpret all the Boeotian heroes as merely personifications of the constellations; there has since come to be wide agreement that the myth of Orion existed <b>before</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> constellation named for him. Homer, for example, mentions Orion, the Hunter, and Orion, the constellation, but never confuses the two. Once Orion was recognized as a constellation, astronomy in turn affected the myth. The story of Side may well be a piece of astronomical mythology. The Greek word side means pomegranate, which bears fruit while Orion, the constellation, can be seen in the night sky. Rose suggests she is connected with Sidae in Boeotia, and that the pomegranate, as a sign of the Underworld, is connected with her descent there.|$|E

25|$|While longshoremen in the United States had {{organized}} and conducted strikes <b>before</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> United States, the ILA traces its origins to {{a union of}} longshoremen on the Great Lakes: the Association of Lumber Handlers founded in 1877, then renamed the National Longshoremen's Association of the United States, in 1892. It joined the American Federation of Labor in 1895 and renamed itself the International Longshoremen's Association several years later, when it admitted Canadian longshoremen to membership.|$|E
25|$|Wild men {{stories are}} {{found among the}} Pacific Northwest coastal Indian tribes. Anthropologist and cryptozoologist Grover Krantz has written that stories of the Indians which can be {{confidently}} related to the Sasquatch correspond to the areas where white Americans have reported similar sightings. According to David Daegling, the legends existed <b>before</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> single name for the creature. They differed in their details both regionally and between families in the same community. Similar accounts and legends of wild men are found on every continent except Antarctica.|$|E
25|$|The {{hypothesis}} was proposed <b>before</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> {{clear distinction between}} {{the different types of}} diabetes. Neel later stated that the hypothesis applied to non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. In its original form the theory more specifically stated that diabetes may be due to a rapid insulin response which would prevent loss of glucose from the urine. Furthermore, it made use of a then popular theory which was later disproven. This argued that specific insulin antagonists were released in response to insulin with this causing diabetes.|$|E

There she met Frank Newburg, who was, at the time, leading man to Ruth Roland at the Kalem and American Mutoscope and Biograph companies. Newburg {{took her to a}} studio in Santa Monica, California, where her aunt, Anne Schafer, was a popular star. Newburg and Novak later married in 1915 and had one daughter. However, the marriage was short lived and the couple divorced in 1918.|$|E
25|$|Building on success, on 20 August Vang Pao {{expanded}} his offensive. He continued to plan on a two-pronged operation. As <b>before,</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> northern column. Two battalions of Royalist regular volunteers—Bataillon Volontaires 21 and Bataillon Volontaires 24—were stiffened with the 101 Bataillon Parachutistes (101st Paratroop Battalion). This probe moved northeastward from Ban Na; their immediate objective was Moung Phanh. The second column, moving {{in from the}} south, consisted of two regimental-size units of guerrillas, Groupe Mobile 22 and Groupe Mobile 23. Most of the Kou Kiet troops were armed with M16s.|$|E

25|$|The Partition was {{a highly}} {{controversial}} arrangement, and remains a cause of much tension on the Indian subcontinent today. According to Allen McGrath many British leaders including the British Viceroy, Mountbatten, were unhappy over the partition of India. Lord Mountbatten of Burma had not only been accused of rushing the process through, but also {{is alleged to have}} influenced the Radcliffe Line in India's favour. The commission took longer to decide on a final boundary than on the partition itself. Thus the two nations were granted their independence even <b>before</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> defined boundary between them.|$|E
25|$|In these years, {{more workers}} in the city were {{organized}} in unions than ever <b>before.</b> <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> 400 percent increase in union membership from 1915 to 1918. At the time, {{workers in the}} United States, particularly in the Pacific Northwest, were becoming increasingly radicalized, with many in {{the rank and file}} supportive of the recent revolution in Russia and working toward a similar revolution in the United States. In the fall of 1919, for instance, Seattle longshoremen refused to load arms destined for the anti-Bolshevik White Army in Russia and attacked those who attempted to load them.|$|E
25|$|After a solid {{start on}} a rain-shortened first day, {{when they reached}} 152/2, England fell away on the second. Only 55 from Allen enabled them to make as many as 295 {{in the face of}} Hall's fast bowling. Alexander took four catches. Though West Indies {{achieved}} a substantial first innings lead, thanks largely to Sobers, they scored at not much over two runs an over. Between them, the two English off-spinners, Allen and Illingworth, bowled 85 overs for only 147 runs. Thanks to centuries by Dexter and Subba Row (his first in Tests), England had no difficulty in saving the game, reaching 320/3 at one point <b>before</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> flurry of wickets when {{it was too late to}} matter.|$|E

25|$|Generally, {{a central}} bank or {{treasury}} is solely responsible within a state or currency union for the issue of banknotes. However, {{this is not always}} the case, and historically the paper currency of countries was often handled entirely by private banks. Thus, many different banks or institutions may have issued banknotes in a given country. Commercial banks in the United States had legally issued banknotes <b>before</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> national currency; however, these became subject to government authorization from 1863 to 1932. In the last of these series, the issuing bank would stamp its name and promise to pay, along with the signatures of its president and cashier on a preprinted note. By this time, the notes were standardized in appearance and not too different from Federal Reserve Notes.|$|E
25|$|Hinduism is a {{religious}} category including many beliefs and traditions. Since Hinduism was the way of expressing meaningful living for a long time, <b>before</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> need for naming it as a separate religion, Hindu doctrines are supplementary and complementary in nature, generally non-exclusive, suggestive and tolerant in content. Most believe that the ātman (spirit, soul)—the person's true self—is eternal. In part, this stems from Hindu beliefs that spiritual development occurs across many lifetimes, and goals should match the state of development of the individual. There are four possible aims to human life, known as the purusharthas (ordered from least to greatest): (i)Kāma (wish, desire, love and sensual pleasure), (ii)Artha (wealth, prosperity, glory), (iii)Dharma (righteousness, duty, morality, virtue, ethics), encompassing notions such as ahimsa (non-violence) and satya (truth) and (iv)Moksha (liberation, i.e. liberation from Saṃsāra, the cycle of reincarnation).|$|E
25|$|Up to and {{including}} the 1894 Steinitz–Lasker match, both players, with their backers, generally contributed equally to the purse, following the custom of important matches in the 19th century <b>before</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> generally recognized world champion. For example: the stakes were £100 a side in both the second Staunton vs Saint-Amant match (Paris, 1843) and the Anderssen vs Steinitz match (London, 1866); Steinitz and Zukertort played their 1886 match for £400 a side. Lasker introduced the practise of demanding that the challenger should provide {{the whole of the}} purse, and his successors followed his example up to World War II. This requirement makes arranging world championship matches more difficult, for example: Marshall challenged Lasker in 1904 but could not raise the money until 1907; in 1911 Lasker and Rubinstein agreed in principle to a world championship match, but this was never played as Rubinstein could not raise the money. In the early 1920s, Alekhine, Rubinstein and Nimzowitsch all challenged Capablanca, but only Alekhine was able to raise the US $10,000 that Capablanca demanded, and not until 1927.|$|E
