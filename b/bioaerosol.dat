50|$|Certain {{limitations}} {{exist for}} commonly used <b>bioaerosol</b> samplers. For {{most of the}} samplers, nonbiological environmental particles such as dust must be separated from bioaerosols prior to detection. The diluted nature of <b>bioaerosol</b> in the air also poses challenges to samplers. While total microorganism concentrations are {{on the order of}} 106/cm3 or greater, <b>bioaerosol</b> concentrations are commonly less than 1/cm3, and often less than 1/m3 in the case of infectious aerosols. Moreover, many commercially available <b>bioaerosol</b> samplers haven not been investigated on their collection efficiencies for particles with different aerodynamic diameters, which makes it impossible to get the size-resolved <b>bioaerosol</b> information.|$|E

This study was developed to begin filling the current knowledge gap between theoretical researches in laboratory and field application. The primary objective {{is to develop a}} constructional protocol for evaluating the effect of upper-room UVGI on polydisperse <b>bioaerosols</b> in classroom settings and find the key factors that influence the concentration of <b>bioaerosols</b> in classrooms at the field. ^ A literature review was first summarized about laboratory and field evaluations of upper-room UVGI. The review explored currently available ways of measuring <b>bioaerosols.</b> Cultural method by impactors and continuous monitoring of <b>bioaerosols</b> by fluorescent signals were chose. Each sampling method operated with designed sampling procedures. ^ <b>Bioaerosols</b> samples by two sampling methods have shown fine size (0. 5 µm- 3 µm) and total <b>bioaerosols</b> in the UVGI classroom were statistically significant lower than the non-UVGI classroom in 12 of the 20 visiting days. A significantly higher level of <b>bioaerosols</b> during the occupied periods than unoccupied ones was found in every visiting day. A new parameter, fraction of fluorescent <b>bioaerosols</b> to total aerosols, {{has proven to be a}} good indication in reflecting the occupancy status for indoor environments. More than 60 % of the visiting days had lower concentrations of 0. 5 µm <b>bioaerosols</b> in the UVGI classroom during the following crossover measurement. This number dropped to or less than 50 % when grouped with larger channels of <b>bioaerosols.</b> ^ An analytical model was developed to simulate decay process of polydisperse <b>bioaerosols</b> in classroom. The results from both the model and measurement indicated that total and small size of fluorescent <b>bioaerosols</b> decayed faster comparing to same size aerosols. The decay rate by UVGI played a significant role for <b>bioaerosols</b> at 0. 5 µm. When the susceptibility of airborne microorganisms to UVGI is higher, the decay rate by UVGI improves from 0. 3 /hour to 34 /hour. The simulation of decay rates in classrooms helps to interpret the potential effects of ventilation, UVGI, and other factors on <b>bioaerosols.</b> The results indicate that upper-room UVGI could be an effective method to disinfect airborne microorganisms - especially when the size of the <b>bioaerosols</b> is 0. 5 µm. ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Bioaerosols</b> {{can range}} in size from 10 {{nanometer}} virus particles to 100 micrometers pollen grains. Pollen grains are the largest <b>bioaerosols</b> and are less likely to remain suspended in the air {{over a long period of}} time due to their weight. Consequently, pollen particle concentration decreases more rapidly with height than smaller <b>bioaerosols</b> such as bacteria, fungi and possibly viruses, which may be able to survive in the upper troposphere. At present, there is little research on the specific altitude tolerance of different <b>bioaerosols.</b> However, scientists believe that atmospheric turbulence impacts where different <b>bioaerosols</b> may be found.|$|R
50|$|Indoor <b>bioaerosol</b> is <b>bioaerosol</b> in {{an indoor}} environment. Bioaerosols are natural or {{artificial}} particles of biological (microbial, plant, or animal) origin {{suspended in the}} air. These particles are {{also referred to as}} organic dust. Bioaerosols may consist of bacteria, fungi (and spores and cell fragments of fungi), viruses, microbial toxins, pollen, plant fibers, etc. Size of <b>bioaerosol</b> particles varies from below 1 µm to 100 µm in aerodynamic diameter; viable <b>bioaerosol</b> particles can be suspended in air as single cells or aggregates of microorganism as small as 1-10 µm in size. Since bioaerosols are potentially related to various human health effects and the indoor environment provides a unique exposure situation, concerns about indoor bioaerosols have increased over the last decade.|$|E

50|$|<b>Bioaerosols</b> impact {{a variety}} of {{biogeochemical}} systems on earth including, {{but not limited to}} atmospheric, terrestrial, and marine ecosystems. As long-standing as these relationships are, the topic of <b>bioaerosols</b> is not very well-known. <b>Bioaerosols</b> can affect organisms in a multitude of ways including influencing the health of living organisms through allergies, disorders, and disease. Additionally, the distribution of pollen and spore <b>bioaerosols</b> contribute to the genetic diversity of organisms across multiple habitats.|$|R
50|$|The highest {{concentration}} of <b>bioaerosols</b> {{is near the}} Earth’s surface in the PBL. Here wind turbulence causes vertical mixing, bringing particles from the ground into the atmosphere. <b>Bioaerosols</b> introduced to the atmosphere can form clouds, which are then blown to other geographic locations and precipitate out as rain, hail, or snow. Increased levels of <b>bioaerosols</b> have been observed in rain forests during and after rain events. Bacteria and phytoplankton from marine environments {{have been linked to}} cloud formation. However, for this same reason, <b>bioaerosols</b> cannot be transported long distances in the PBL since the clouds will eventually precipitate them out. Furthermore, it would take additional turbulence or convection at the upper limits of the PBL to inject <b>bioaerosols</b> into the troposphere where they may transported larger distances as part of tropospheric flow.

50|$|Adverse health effects/diseases {{related to}} indoor <b>bioaerosol</b> {{exposure}} {{can be divided}} into two categories: those confirmed to be associated with <b>bioaerosol</b> and those suspected but not confirmed to be associated with <b>bioaerosol.</b> Bioaerosols have been revealed to cause certain human diseases, such as tuberculosis, Legionnaires' disease and different forms of bacterial pneumonia, coccidioidomycosis, influenza, measles, and gastrointestinal illness. Bioaerosols are also associated with some noninfectious airway diseases, such as allergies and asthma. As a known component of indoor <b>bioaerosol,</b> β(1→3)-glucan (cell wall components of most fungi) is proposed to be the causative agent of mold-induced nonallergic inflammatory reactions. It is reported that 25%-30% of allergenic asthma cases in industrialized countries are induced by fungi, which {{has been the focus of}} concerns about human exposure to airborne microorganisms in recent years.|$|E
50|$|Major culture-independent identification/quantification methods {{adopted in}} {{previous}} <b>bioaerosol</b> studies include {{polymerase chain reaction}} (PCR), quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), microarray (PhyloChip), fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), flow cytometry and solid-phase cytometry, immunoassay (i.e., enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)). The well-known PCR is a powerful tool in identifying and even quantifying the biological origin of bioaerosols. PCR alone cannot accomplish all the tasks related to <b>bioaerosol</b> detection; instead it usually serves as the preparation tool for subsequent processes like DNA sequencing, microarray, and community fingerprinting techniques. A typical procedure for PCR-based <b>bioaerosol</b> analysis is shown in Figure 1.|$|E
50|$|Some {{other human}} {{diseases}} and symptoms {{have been proposed}} {{to be associated with}} indoor <b>bioaerosol,</b> but no deterministic conclusions could be drawn due to the insufficiency of evidence. One example is the well-known sick building syndrome (SBS). SBS refers to non-specific complaints, such as upper-respiratory irritative symptoms, headaches, fatigue, and rash, which cannot be related to an identifiable cause but are building related. Over the last two decades, there have been many studies indicating association of indoor <b>bioaerosol</b> with sick building syndrome. However, most of the related studies based their conclusions on statistical correlation between concentrations of certain types of bioaerosols and incidence of complaints, which has various drawbacks methodologically. For example, some studies have a small sample size, which critically undermines the validity of speculations based on the statistical results. Also, many studies were not able to exclude the influences of other factors beside <b>bioaerosol</b> in their analysis, which makes the statistical correlation theoretically inappropriate to support association of SBS with bioaerosols. Additional studies revealed that <b>bioaerosol</b> is unlikely to be the cause of SBS. Recent epidemiological and toxicological studies continued to suggest a possible link between <b>bioaerosol</b> exposure and sick building syndrome, but methodological limitations remained in these studies.|$|E
40|$|Airborne fungi, termed fungal <b>bioaerosols,</b> have {{received}} attention {{due to the}} association with public health problems and the effects on living organisms in nature. There are growing concerns that fungal <b>bioaerosols</b> {{are relevant to the}} occurrence of allergies, opportunistic diseases in hospitals, and outbreaks of plant diseases. The search for ways of preventing and curing the harmful effects of fungal <b>bioaerosols</b> has created a high demand for the study and development of an efficient method of controlling <b>bioaerosols.</b> However, almost all modern microbiological studies and theories have focused on microorganisms in liquid and solid phases. We investigated the thermal heating effects on fungal <b>bioaerosols</b> in a continuous-flow environment. Although the thermal heating process has long been a traditional method of controlling microorganisms, the effect of a continuous high-temperature, short-time (HTST) process on airborne microorganisms has not been quantitatively investigated in terms of various aerosol properties. Our experimental results show that the geometric mean diameter of the tested fungal <b>bioaerosols</b> decreased when they were exposed to increases in the surrounding temperature. The HTST process produced a significant decline in the (1 → 3) -β-d-glucan concentration of fungal <b>bioaerosols.</b> More than 99 % of the Aspergillus versicolor and Cladosporium cladosporioides <b>bioaerosols</b> lost their culturability in about 0. 2 s when the surrounding temperature exceeded 350 °C and 400 °C, respectively.

40|$|Background. Dust and {{endotoxin}} {{levels are}} higher in <b>bioaerosols</b> from floor-housed (FH) poultry operations than cage-housed (CH) poultry facilities. Workers from CH operations have reported a greater prevalence of respiratory symptoms than FH workers. The negative respiratory symptoms observed in workers are typically attributed to endotoxin. However, other components of poultry <b>bioaerosols</b> {{and their effects}} on human health, such as bacteria, antibiotics and archaea, are poorly understood. Bacteria have been detected in intestinal, fecal, litter, and air samples from poultry operations. Chicken fecal bacteria differ depending on bird age and antibiotic use, which differ between CH and FH facilities. Antibiotics are used in CH and FH poultry operations to lower the likeliness of disease transmission. In FH facilities, antibiotics may also be used at sub-therapeutic levels for growth promotion. Low levels of antibiotic create a selective pressure towards antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in chicken fecal bacteria. Archaea have been detected in ceca, fecal, litter and house fly samples from poultry facilities but have not been investigated in <b>bioaerosols.</b> However, archaea have been detected in swine and dairy <b>bioaerosols</b> and can induce airway inflammation. Further understanding of poultry <b>bioaerosols,</b> with a comparison of those from CH and FH operations, will aid {{in the development of}} management practices to reduce worker exposure and response. Objective. The objective of these studies was to compare <b>bioaerosols</b> from CH and FH poultry facilities. Specifically, levels of dust, endotoxin, total bacteria, bacterial species, antimicrobial resistance genes and methanogenic archaea were examined. Methods. <b>Bioaerosols</b> were collected from fifteen CH and fifteen FH poultry operations using stationary area samplers as well as personal sampling devices. Dust was measured by gravimetric analyses. Limulus Amoebocyte Lysate (LAL) assays were used to quantify endotoxin. Bacteria and archaea concentrations were measured by quantitative PCR. Bacterial and archaeal diversity was investigated using PCR followed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and sequencing. AMR genes were detected using end-point PCR. Results. Dust (p< 0. 001), endotoxin (p< 0. 05), total bacteria (p< 0. 05), Enterococcus (p< 0. 001), E. coli (p< 0. 001) and Staphylococcus (p< 0. 001) were more concentrated in <b>bioaerosols</b> from FH poultry operations than CH <b>bioaerosols.</b> Methanogenic archaea (p< 0. 001) and C. perfringens (p< 0. 05) were significantly higher in <b>bioaerosols</b> from CH facilities than FH <b>bioaerosols.</b> Zinc bacitracin resistance gene (bcrR), erythromycin resistance gene (ermA), and tetracycline resistance gene (tetA/C), were more prevalent in <b>bioaerosols</b> from FH facilities than CH <b>bioaerosols</b> (p< 0. 01, p< 0. 01 and p< 0. 05, respectively). Conclusions. <b>Bioaerosols</b> from CH and FH poultry operations are significantly different, suggesting that CH and FH workers are exposed to significantly different environments. Bacterial diversity, C. perfringens, archaea, and/or unmeasured components of <b>bioaerosols</b> may be contributing to the greater prevalence of respiratory symptoms observed in CH workers. Each barn type may require specific remediation methods. Future directions.

Here, the OP of selected <b>bioaerosols</b> (bacteria cells vs fungal spores) was assessed through the cell-free DTT assay. Results show that <b>bioaerosols</b> induce Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) production, varying along the microorganism type, species, and concentration. Fungal spores show up to 10 times more ROS generation than bacterial cells. At the highest concentrations, fungal spores present as much oxidative reactivity as the most redox-active airborne chemicals (Copper, Naphtoquinone). Moreover, <b>bioaerosols</b> substantially influence OP of ambient PM and that of its chemical constituents: in presence of A. fumigatus spores, the OP of Cu/NQ is increased {{by a factor of}} 2 to 5, whereas, 10 (4) and 10 (5) S. epidermidis bacterial cells. mL(- 1) halves the OP of Cu/NQ. Finally, viable and gamma-rays-killed model <b>bioaerosols</b> present similar oxidative reactivity, suggesting a metabolism-independent cellular mechanism.

50|$|In {{previous}} research on indoor <b>bioaerosol</b> in residential environments, microorganisms have been quantified by conventional culture-based techniques, in which colony forming units (CFU) on selective media are counted. Cultivating methods have several disadvantages. Culture-based methods are known to underestimate environmental microbial diversity, {{based on the fact}} that only a small percentage of microbes can be cultivated in the laboratory. This underestimation is likely to be signified for the quantification of <b>bioaerosol,</b> since colony counts of airborne microbes are typically quite different from direct counts. Culture-based methods also need relatively long incubation times (over 24 hours) and are labor-intensive. Consequently, culture-based methods are no longer suitable for effective and rapid identification and quantification of <b>bioaerosol,</b> and non-culture based methods, such as immunoassays, molecular biological tests, and optical, and electrical methods, have been developing over the past few decades.|$|E
