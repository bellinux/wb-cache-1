5|$|Sister Peak (Comfortless Cove Hydrothermal Field, , {{elevation}} −2996m), Shrimp Farm and Mephisto (Red Lion Hydrothermal Field, , elevation −3047m), {{are three}} hydrothermal vents of the <b>black</b> <b>smoker</b> category, on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge near Ascension Island. They are presumed {{to have been}} active since an earthquake shook the region in 2002. These vents have been observed to vent phase-separated, vapor-type fluids. In 2008, sustained exit temperatures of up to 407°C were recorded {{at one of these}} vents, with a peak recorded temperature of up to 464°C. These thermodynamic conditions exceed the critical point of seawater, and are the highest temperatures recorded to date from the seafloor. This is the first reported evidence for direct magmatic-hydrothermal interaction on a slow-spreading mid-ocean ridge.|$|E
25|$|The ore {{materials}} are trapped within a fumarole field or a <b>black</b> <b>smoker</b> field {{when they are}} expelled into the ocean, cool, and precipitate sulfide minerals as stratiform sulfide ore. Some deposits show evidence of formation via deposition of sulfide via replacement of altered volcanosedimentary rocks and may also form by invasion of sulfur-rich brines into unconsolidated sediments.|$|E
25|$|VMS {{deposits}} have a {{wide variety}} of morphologies, with mound shaped and bowl shaped deposits most typical. The bowl-shaped formations formed due to venting of hydrothermal solutions into submarine depressions - in many cases, this type of deposit can be confused with sedimentary exhalative deposits. The mound-shaped deposits formed in a way similar to that of modern massive sulfide deposits - via production of a hydrothermal mound formed by successive <b>black</b> <b>smoker</b> chimneys. Deposits that have formed in environments dominated by sedimentary rocks or highly permeable volcanic rocks can show a tabular morphology that mimics the geometry of the surrounding rocks.|$|E

They were observed using the deep submergence vehicle ALVIN from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. Now, <b>black</b> <b>smokers</b> {{are known to}} exist in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, at an average depth of 2100 metres. The most northerly <b>black</b> <b>smokers</b> are a cluster of five named Loki's Castle, discovered in 2008 by scientists from the University of Bergen at 73°N, on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge between Greenland and Norway. These <b>black</b> <b>smokers</b> are of interest as they are in a more stable area of the Earth's crust, where tectonic forces are less and consequently fields of hydrothermal vents are less common. The world's deepest known <b>black</b> <b>smokers</b> are located in the Cayman Trough, 5,000 m (3.1 miles) below the ocean's surface.|$|R

500|$|The first {{bathymetry}} of the seamount {{was compiled}} by the [...] in 1981, as part of SeaBeam trials in the North Pacific. The survey was specifically meant to find and link seafloor hydrothermal activity to geomorphic features. Four areas of increased temperature concentration, indicative of hydrothermal activity were found, and the then-unnamed Axial Seamount was among them. Submersible dives with Pisces IV and DSV Alvin in 1983 and 1984 discovered the first active <b>black</b> <b>smoker</b> vents in the north Pacific. Soon after Axial Seamount was named for its central position on {{the intersection of the}} Cobb–Eickelberg Seamount chain and Juan de Fuca Ridge. That same year, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) founded its VENTS program, providing impetus for studying the volcano more closely.|$|E
500|$|In 1983, a Canadian–American {{collaborative}} expedition, {{named the}} Canadian American Seamount Expedition (CASM), visited the northwestern edge of Axial Seamount's summit caldera {{to investigate a}} persistent temperature anomaly in the region.

Camera tows and submersible dives through the 1980s and 1990s revealed Axial Seamount's active state, including the only known <b>black</b> <b>smoker</b> in the northwest Pacific. Three venting centers have been recognized: the original site, named CHASM; a southwestern caldera field discovered in the late 1980s, named ASHES; and a site located on its southeastern rift zone, named CASTLE.

40|$|OBJECTIVES. Higher {{levels of}} serum {{cotinine}} (a metabolite of nicotine) {{have been found}} in <b>Black</b> <b>smokers</b> than in White smokers even after self-reported cigarette dose was controlled. It is unknown whether higher cotinine levels in <b>Black</b> pregnant <b>smokers</b> may increase the risk of delivering an infant of reduced birthweight. METHODS. We analyzed serum cotinine levels of 374 Black and 829 White women who smoked during pregnancy and who delivered between April 1964 and April 1967. Racial differences in the relationship between cotinine and birthweight were examined. RESULTS. Cotinine levels were 27. 4 ng/mL higher in <b>Black</b> <b>smokers</b> after cigarette dose and confounding variables were controlled. Blacks had higher cotinine levels than Whites at each dose. No significant racial differences in the rate of decrease in birthweight per nanogram of cotinine per milliliter were found. CONCLUSIONS. Our results confirm previous research showing higher cotinine levels at each smoking dose in <b>Black</b> <b>smokers</b> than in White smokers. Because {{there was no difference in}} the rate of decrease in birthweight due to cotinine, our results suggest that cigarette smoking among Blacks may have a greater effect on birthweight than it does among Whites...|$|R

40|$|Anecdotal {{evidence}} indicates that the cigarette industry is targeting the sale of specific brands, notably menthol cigarettes, to black consumers. This paper presents data on the types of cigarettes smoked by white and <b>black</b> <b>smokers.</b> The cigarette brand preferences of two populations of smokers were examined. The first comprised 70 white and 365 <b>black</b> adult <b>smokers</b> seen at the Deaconness Family Medicine Center located in Buffalo, NY. The second population included 1, 070 white and 92 <b>black</b> <b>smokers</b> who called a Stop Smoking Hotline in Buffalo. The results showed that, in both populations, blacks were {{twice as likely to}} smoke mentholated cigarettes compared with whites. In an attempt to evaluate the targeting of cigarette ads to <b>black</b> <b>smokers</b> as a possible explanation for black-white differences in brand preferences, cigarette ads appearing in magazines targeted to predominantly white or black readers were compared. Cigarette ads appearing in seven magazines were reviewed, four directed to predominantly white readers (Newsweek, Time, People, Mademoiselle) and three with wide circulation among black audiences (Jet, Ebony, Essence). The results showed that the magazines targeted to black readers contained significantly more cigarette ads and more ads for menthol brand cigarettes than magazines similar in content but targeted to white readers. The observation that a higher percentage of blacks smoke menthol cigarettes than do whites is consistent with the findings regarding differences in the type of cigarette ads appearing in magazines intended for black or white readers. However, {{it is not possible to}} determine from this study whether cigarette advertising is the cause of the differences in preference of cigarette brands between white and <b>black</b> <b>smokers.</b> (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: The {{prevalence}} of smoking across racial/ethnic groups has declined over the years, yet racial health disparities for smoking persist. Studies indicate that non-Hispanic <b>Black</b> <b>smokers</b> attempt {{to quit smoking}} more often compared to non-Hispanic White smokers but are less successful at doing so. Research suggests that motives to quit smoking differ by race, however, less {{is known about the}} role of motives to smoke in explaining racial differences in attempts to quit smoking. Methods: This study examined whether smoking motives accounted for the differential rates in quit attempts between non-Hispanic Black (n= 155) and non-Hispanic White (n= 159) smokers. Data were culled from a larger study of heavy-drinking smokers. The Wisconsin Index of Smoking Dependence Motives (WISDM) assessed motives to smoke. Results: As expected, <b>Black</b> and White <b>smokers</b> reported similar smoking patterns, yet <b>Black</b> <b>smokers</b> reported higher rates of failed attempts to quit smoking than White smokers. Findings indicated that Black, compared to White, smokers endorsed lower scores in the negative reinforcement, positive reinforcement, and taste WISDM subscales and scores in these subscales mediated the relationship between race and quit attempts. Conclusions: In this study, Blacks, compared to Whites, endorsed lower motives to smoke, which are generally associated with successful quit attempts, yet they experienced more failed attempts to quit smoking. This study demonstrates racial health disparities at the level of smoking motives and suggests that <b>Black</b> <b>smokers</b> remain vulnerable to failed quit attempts despite reporting lower motives to smoke. © 2014...|$|R
