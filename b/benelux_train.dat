50|$|The <b>Benelux</b> <b>train</b> running between Amsterdam Centraal and Brussels-South {{consists}} of a Belgian electric locomotive and six carriages similar to the ICR, except that the last one is a driving trailer which has a drivers cabin for controlling the locomotive when it pushes the train (it is a push-pull train). It is best described as an international Intercity Service and does not rival other international services such as the high-speed Thalys and ICE services. Contrary to Thalys and ICE, the <b>Benelux</b> <b>train</b> is a traditional train divided into first and second class carriages similar in luxury to other IC trains {{in the region and}} it travels at the same speeds. Ticket prices are, as a result, much lower for the <b>Benelux</b> <b>train</b> than they are for Thalys and ICE.

50|$|The SNCB Class 11 {{locomotives}} {{were built}} in the 1980s for hauling the <b>Benelux</b> <b>trains</b> between Brussels, Belgium, and Amsterdam, The Netherlands. They operated in the push pull mode - remotely controlled from a leading driving trailer when {{at the rear of the}} train. They are numbered 1181-1192 to avoid clashing with NS Class 1100 locos that were still in use at that time. The Dutch Class 11 was originally numbered from 1101 to 1160. In 2009 they were replaced on the <b>Benelux</b> <b>trains</b> by Bombardier TRAXX locomotives which had been leased from Angel (now Alpha) Trains. When Class 11 locomotives were replaced on international services they were moved to peak hour services within Belgium for the rest of their working lives before retirement. They are painted to match the Nederlandse Spoorwegen (Dutch Railways) coaching stock they used to work with.|$|R
