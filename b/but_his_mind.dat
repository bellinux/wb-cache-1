5|$|The Forerunner Saga reveals Guilty Spark to {{have barely}} survived {{the events of}} Halo 3. His body barely {{functioning}} and his memory {{of the last few}} years erased from his fight with Chief, he was recovered by the UNSC ship Rubicon and interrogated by ONI for information about the Forerunners. During the interrogation, the barely functioning Spark had breached the Rubicon's firewalls and overpowered the onboard A.I. When the interrogation was over, his monitor body shut down and was launched into space, <b>but</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> remained in the ship, informing the crew {{that he was going to}} search for the Librarian and restore his friends Riser and Vinnerva from his life as Chakas before placing the crew in cryostasis and taking the ship for his own to search for the Forerunner.|$|E
500|$|Following the Wall Street Crash of 1929, the once-booming music {{industry}} contracted and work became {{more difficult to}} find. For a while, Beiderbecke's only income came from a radio show booked by Whiteman, The Camel Pleasure Hour. However, during a live broadcast on October 8, 1930, Beiderbecke's seemingly limitless gift for improvisation finally failed him: [...] "He stood up to take his solo, <b>but</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> went blank and nothing happened," [...] recalled a fellow musician, Frankie Cush. Whiteman finally let Beiderbecke go. The cornetist {{spent the rest of}} the year at home in Davenport and then, in February 1931, he returned to New York one last time.|$|E
500|$|Because of his father's career, Hextall's {{education}} {{was far from}} stable; each year began at Brandon, and once the hockey season commenced in October, he moved to a school nearer to where his father was playing. At school, he achieved B and C grades, putting in the minimum amount of effort, <b>but</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> remained on hockey, and specifically goaltending. [...] "Everybody else would be working and I'd be drawing pictures of Tony Esposito and Jimmy Rutherford," [...] he recalled. Hextall came to mostly enjoy the constant moving, later saying [...] "I got to hang around NHL rinks. What more would I have wanted?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Macassar merely sighed gently--perhaps {{he had no}} fitting answer; {{perhaps his}} heart was too full for him to answer. He sat with his eye fixed on his hat, which still dangled in <b>his</b> hand; <b>but</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind's</b> eye was far away.|$|R

500|$|Ramsey's {{opinion that}} Dodgin had treated him unfairly was {{not shared by}} the other Southampton players, who {{respected}} Ellerington as a player of comparable ability. According to the wing-half Joe Mallett, Ramsey was also motivated to leave by a dressing-room row with his captain Bill Rochford at half-time during that final League match against Sheffield Wednesday: one of the Sheffield Wednesday goals was blamed on Ramsey's failure to play an opposing winger offside. The Southampton chairman and board tried to persuade Ramsey to stay, <b>but</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> was made up—he told them that if {{he played in the}} reserve team it would hinder his chances of playing internationally. Liverpool, Luton Town and Burnley were among the clubs who expressed interest in buying him but {{by the time of the}} transfer deadline on 16 March only Sheffield Wednesday had made a concrete bid. Tottenham Hotspur came in with a last-minute offer, but there was no time for the transfer to go through, and Ramsey was forced to stay at Southampton for the rest of the season. [...] On 15 May 1949 the new Tottenham manager Arthur Rowe revived the offer, and signed Ramsey in a part-exchange deal for £4,500 and Wales international winger Ernie Jones—the transfer was widely reported as being worth £21,000, then a record for Tottenham.|$|E
2500|$|Hoover was {{the only}} living former Republican {{president}} between his last day in office in 1933 and Eisenhower's last day in office in 1961. Starting with the 1948 convention, Hoover was feted as the guest of [...] "farewell" [...] ceremonies, with the unspoken assumption that the aging former President might not survive until the next convention. In 1960, Hoover appeared at his final Republican National Convention. Joking to the delegates, he said, [...] "Apparently, my last three good-byes didn't take." [...] Although he lived to see the 1964 convention, ill health prevented him from attending, and his absence was acknowledged in presidential nominee Barry Goldwater's acceptance speech. In 1962, Hoover had a malignant intestinal tumor removed. Ten months later he had severe gastrointestinal bleeding and seemed terminally ill and frail, <b>but</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> was clear and he maintained {{a great deal of}} correspondence. Although the illness would get worse over time, he refused to be hospitalized.|$|E
2500|$|For many years, Batchelor {{resided in}} Grosse Pointe, Michigan. In his final months, Batchelor {{lived in a}} nursing home in Detroit. Sportswriter Joe Falls {{remained}} close to Batchelor in his later years. After Batchelor died, Falls described a visit to Batchelor at the nursing home:"Batch couldn't have weighed more than 60 pounds at the end, <b>but</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> was nimble. He'd drift between fantasy and fact. ... But before you could feel pangs of sadness at his deterioration, he'd pull you close to the bed and whisper: 'I think it's great the Lions got Munson from the Rams. They couldn't win with Plum and Munson has the poise to be a good quarterback. Pour me a drink' Batch went out the way he would have wanted, with his lifelong friend and companion, Jack Daniels, at his side. He couldn't eat at the end, and water repulsed him, so they let him sip his favorite liquid." ...|$|E
