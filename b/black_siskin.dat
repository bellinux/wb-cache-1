50|$|The <b>black</b> <b>siskin</b> (Spinus atratus) is {{a species}} of finch in the family Fringillidae.It is found in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, and Peru.Its natural {{habitats}} are subtropical or tropical high-altitude shrubland and subtropical or tropical high-altitude grassland.|$|E
50|$|The <b>black</b> <b>siskin</b> {{grows to}} {{a length of}} about 13 cm. The male is mostly a glossy black colour with the {{exception}} of a band of yellow at the base of the primaries, and the base of the tail and the lower belly which are yellow. The female is similar but the black part of the plumage is less glossy and more brownish. The only other bird within its range with which it might be confused is the yellow-rumped siskin (Spinus uropygialis). When stationary they are easily distinguished, but in flight the <b>black</b> <b>siskin</b> displays various patches of yellow plumage on its rump and on the wings which enhances the similarity.|$|E
40|$|Ninety-five (97 %) of 98 <b>black</b> <b>siskins</b> (Carduelis atrata) {{died within}} 2 months of arrival in Italy from South America with the {{following}} clinical sings: rapid weight loss, breast muscle atrophy, congested and distended abdomen, diarrhea, and lethargy. Macroscopically we observed hepato-splenomegaly, pulmonary congestion, and thickening of the interstinal wall. Histologically, lymphomonocytic transmural enteritis, interstitial mononuclear cell infiltrates in the lungs and in the liver, as well as activation of splenic follicles were common features. Large numbers of protozoa belonging to Isospora sp. were observed {{in various stages of}} their life-cycle in the intestinal epithelium, and some zoites were found in the extra-intestinal cellular infiltrate as well. No viral or bacterial pathogens were found...|$|R
40|$|Because dominants usually exploit {{others and}} take {{a disproportionate share of}} the {{available}} resources, we should expect foragers to be choosy as to which individuals they join. Here we show that siskins (Carduelis spinus) discriminate between dominant and subordinate individuals on the first encounter without requiring cues such as overt aggression, and prefer to join subordinate individuals. Experimental enlargement or removal of the <b>siskin</b> <b>black</b> bib, which has been shown previously to be a reliable predictor of dominance, strongly suggests that dominance discrimination is based on the use of badges of status...|$|R
