5|$|Hitler did {{not seem}} overly <b>bothered</b> <b>with</b> {{the outcome of the}} air battle. For him, Sea Lion had also been a huge risk, even with air superiority, and he had been {{convinced}} since the end of August the Luftwaffe would not achieve it anyway. The war with Britain would have to go on. He would maintain the threat of invasion until 1941 through the use of strategic bombing. Then, he would turn against the Soviet Union and eliminate Britain's last possible ally in Europe. With the Soviets defeated, he believed the British would negotiate. On 17 September, he sent out a directive to the three armed services informing them of Sea Lion delay. On this date, the date for S-Day had been 21 September. It was now postponed until further notice. It is likely that Hitler did not want to gamble his new-found military prestige by launching a hazardous venture across the Channel unless the Luftwaffe had crushed all opposition. At the beginning of December 1940, Hitler told the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (OKW) that they could forget Sea Lion, although he did not formally cancel the operation until 3 March 1942.|$|E

25|$|The {{development}} for Sin and Punishment took a relatively long time {{compared with other}} games of the era. Although development began in 1997, {{a year after the}} release of the Nintendo 64, the game was was not released until {{near the end of the}} Nintendo 64's lifecycle in 2000. In retrospect, Satoru Iwata commented that Treasure was able to accomplish a large amount despite the small size of their team.

25|$|Folklorists today {{consider}} the 1920s the Soviet Union's {{golden age of}} folklore. The struggling new government, which had to focus its efforts on establishing a new administrative system and building up the nation's backwards economy, could not be <b>bothered</b> <b>with</b> attempting to control literature, so studies of folklore thrived. There were two primary trends of folklore study during the decade: the formalist and Finnish schools. Formalism focused on the artistic form of ancient byliny and faerie tales, specifically their use of distinctive structures and poetic devices. The Finnish school was concerned with connections amongst related legends of various Eastern European regions. Finnish scholars collected comparable tales from multiple locales and analyzed their similarities and differences, hoping to trace these epic stories’ migration paths.|$|E
500|$|Bosley Crowther {{was not so}} kind to Dangerous to Know (1938), {{which he}} called a [...] "second-rate melodrama, hardly worthy of the talents of its {{generally}} capable cast". In King of Chinatown Wong played a surgeon who sacrifices a high-paying promotion in order to devote her energies to helping the Chinese fight the Japanese invasion. The New York Times Frank Nugent gave the film a negative review.

500|$|In February 1992, Al Rendon {{was hired}} by EMI Latin to take {{photographs}} for Entre a Mi Mundo. A previous photographer had taken some photos of the singer, which were not well received by the company, and Rendon was asked to do a [...] "quick session". Rendon rented a studio and hired John MacBurney—whom Abraham constany argued with—to do the makeup. MacBurney [...] "privately complained" [...] to EMI Latin that Abraham was difficult to deal with. Rendon and MacBurney, however, found Selena [...] "real easy to work with". Selena picked out the outfit for herself to wear in the cover picture; this outfit included a black top with a mesh see-through midriff, a long-sleeve black jacket with black-and-white striped long sleeves, a wide black leather belt, and tight black pants. She chose a pose where she runs her fingers through her hair, a pose that Abraham was noticeably <b>bothered</b> <b>with.</b> In 1998, the outfit that she wore for the album cover was added to a museum that her family operates in Corpus Christi, Texas.|$|E

500|$|Li Xianhui was a {{daughter}} of the Emperor Zhongzong of Tang and Empress Wei. She was probably killed {{at the age of}} 19 by her grandmother Wu Zetian, along with her husband. [...] After Wu Zetian's death, when her father again came to the throne, she was reburied in a grand tomb in the Qianling Mausoleum in 705. [...] Her tomb was discovered in 1960, and excavated from 1964. [...] It had been robbed in the past, probably soon after the burial, and items in precious materials taken, but the thieves had not <b>bothered</b> <b>with</b> the over 800 pottery tomb figures, and the extensive frescos were untouched. [...] The robbers had left in a hurry, leaving silver items scattered around, and the corpse of one of their number. [...] The tomb had a flattened pyramid rising 12 metres above ground, and a long sloping entrance tunnel lined with frescos, leading to an ante-chamber and the tomb chamber itself, 12 metres below ground level with a high domed roof. [...] Most of the contents, including the frescos, are now in the Shaanxi History Museum.|$|E

He {{added that the}} [...] "level of quality from the special effects to the script is amazing for a fan made show, and the show manages to capture what made the original Star Trek great." [...] Anthony Pascale, in his review for TrekMovie.com, said that the production design in the episode was the best yet for New Voyages. He credited this to the direction and improvements in the lighting, {{as well as the}} improved special effects. Pascale said that the guest appearances of Moses and Takei [...] "fits in the fine tradition of memorable Trek guest characters", saying that the [...] "alluring" [...] Moses played Alana with a [...] "subtle charm". Overall, he said that [...] "fans of fan films and Star Trek: New Voyages are sure to be pleased.

500|$|He left CAI {{at the age}} of 18 {{and began}} a degree in French at the University of Ulster, (formally Ulster Polytechnic) in Jordanstown. He stayed at {{university}} for a year before dropping out. In a 1999 interview, Nesbitt said, [...] "I had the necessary in my head, but I just couldn't be bothered. Being 18 is the worst age to expect people to learn things. There are other things to be <b>bothered</b> <b>with,</b> like girls and football." [...] He made the decision to quit when he was trying to write an overdue essay on existentialism in Les Mains Sales at 4am one day. His father suggested that he should move to England if he wanted to continue acting, so Nesbitt enrolled at the Central School of Speech and Drama (CSSD), part of University of London. Nesbitt felt lost and misrepresented when he first arrived in London, on account of his Northern Irish background; [...] "When I first came to drama school I was a Paddy the minute I walked in. And I remember going to drama school and them all saying to me, 'Aww, yeah, Brits out', and I was like 'It's a wee bit more complicated than that, you know.'"

500|$|Critical {{response}} to the first episode was not favourable; in The Independent, Nicholas Barber called it the most depressing TV programme he had ever seen. He wrote of the six main characters, [...] "Are we supposed to care about these people? The theory, I think, {{is that we should}} relate to them, because their lives are as prosaic as our own, and because Cold Feet is a portrait of urban life as it really is in the Nineties. This is another way of saying the writer hasn't <b>bothered</b> <b>with</b> research or imagination." [...] He criticised the conclusion of Episode 1 but praised the other five, which he had seen on preview tapes. On The Late Review, Germaine Greer and Tony Parsons singled out Nesbitt's acting; Greer called him [...] "especially awful" [...] and Parsons wished that he had plunged to his death from the scissor lift Adam appears on {{at the beginning of the}} episode. General reaction improved as the first year went on. At the conclusion of the first series, Andrew Billen compared it with Vanity Fair in the Evening Standard and was pleased that it offered a televisual outlet for the [...] "forgotten" [...] twentysomethings. Paul Hoggart for The Times wrote positively of the writing, directing, acting, and editing and looked forward to how Rachel's pregnancy plot would be resolved in the second series.|$|E

2500|$|When the {{development}} for the Telefunken main frame [...] began in 1965, Mallebrein and his team {{came up with the}} idea of [...] "reversing" [...] the existing [...] into a moveable mouse-like device, so that customers did not have to be <b>bothered</b> <b>with</b> mounting holes for the earlier trackball device.

2500|$|Penn faced serious {{problems}} in the colonies due to his sloppy business practices.

2500|$|Jyotirao Phule (1827–1890) vehemently criticised any {{explanations}} {{that the}} caste system was natural and ordained by the Creator in Hindu texts.

In his criticism Phule added, [...] "Brahmins cannot claim superior status because of caste, because they hardly <b>bothered</b> <b>with</b> these when wining and dining with Europeans." [...] Professions did not make castes, and castes did not decide one's profession.

2500|$|Adjacent to Studio B was a {{reverberation}} room containing a plate reverb device made by EMT, German makers of similar effects units installed in other recording studios around the world. The EMT reverb was an electro-mechanical echo chamber used to add artificial reverberation effects to recordings. Porter {{arranged to have}} the dedicated echo room cooled down {{as much as possible}} with an air conditioner, and he adjusted the ten springs on the EMT plate to be tighter than usual, in order to feed the plate more audio signal and get a cleaner sound returning from the device. So much signal was being sent to the plate that Porter disconnected the associated VU meter so {{that he would not be}} <b>bothered</b> <b>with</b> its needle slamming against its peg. Porter related that the EMT's springs frequently broke under the increased tension, and he would have to replace them, but that the trouble was worth achieving a [...] "brighter and fuller" [...] echo effect.|$|E
