5|$|It was {{the second}} <b>battle</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> French Army of the Danube, {{commanded}} by Jean-Baptiste Jourdan, and the Habsburg Army under Archduke Charles; the armies had met a few days earlier, 20–22March, on the marshy fields southeast of Ostrach and the Pfullendorf heights.

5|$|The city, {{which began}} as a {{frontier}} town, has several historical attractions. The Lethbridge Viaduct, {{commonly known as the}} High Level Bridge, is the longest and highest steel trestle bridge in North America. It was completed in 1909 on what was then the city's western edge. Indian Battle Park, in the coulees of the Oldman River, commemorates the last <b>battle</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> Cree and the Blackfoot First Nations in 1870.|$|E
5|$|The first fleet battle, and {{the first}} ocean battle, {{involving}} ironclad warships was the Battle of Lissa in 1866. Waged between the Austrian and Italian navies, the battle pitted combined fleets of wooden frigates and corvettes and ironclad warships on {{both sides in the}} largest naval <b>battle</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> battles of Navarino and Tsushima.|$|E
5|$|The {{last big}} <b>battle</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> Colorado-Gila River alliances {{took place in}} August 1857, when about 100 Yavapai, Quechan, and Mohave warriors {{attacked}} a settlement of Maricopa near Pima Butte.

5|$|Additionally {{there are}} often {{transient}} phenomena, events which do not happen on an annual cycle. Most predictable are events like eclipses. In the case of solar eclipses these {{can be used to}} date events in the past. A solar eclipse mentioned by Herodotus enables us to date a <b>battle</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> Medes and the Lydians, which following the eclipse failed to happen, to 28 May, 585 BC. Other easily calculated events are supernovae whose remains are visible to astronomers and therefore their positions and magnitude can be accurately calculated.|$|E
5|$|Also {{frequently}} performed is the Fifth Symphony (Op. 50, 1921–22) presenting another <b>battle</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> {{forces of}} order and chaos. A snare drummer is given the task of interrupting the orchestra, playing ad libitum and out of time, as if to destroy the music. Performed by the Danish Radio Symphony Orchestra conducted by Erik Tuxen at the 1950 Edinburgh International Festival, it caused a sensation, sparking interest in Nielsen's music outside Scandinavia. In the Sixth Symphony (without opus number), written 1924–25, and subtitled Sinfonia Semplice (Simple Symphony), the tonal language seems {{similar to that in}} Nielsen's other symphonies, but the symphony develops into a sequence of cameos, some sad, some grotesque, some humorous.|$|E
5|$|By {{the winter}} of 1894–1895, {{the last of the}} four s had been commissioned; these ships were {{assigned}} to the I Division, which displaced Baden and her three sisters to the II Division. The eight ships conducted training cruises over the winter and spring before conducting the annual autumn fleet exercises. On 21 June 1895, the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal was opened for traffic, eight years after work had begun. Baden and her three sisters, along with dozens of other warships, attended the ceremonies. The major naval powers sent fleets to join the fleet review. The Autumn 1895 maneuvers simulated a high-seas <b>battle</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> I and II Divisions in the North Sea, followed by combined maneuvers {{with the rest of the}} fleet in the Baltic.|$|E

5|$|Claus and Lavie are {{initially}} {{treated as}} intruders but eventually befriend {{the crew of}} the Silvana. They learn that the Guild intends to capture Alvis for reasons unknown to them. In the first <b>battle</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> Silvana and Guild forces, Guild member Dio Eraclea takes an interest in Claus's flying skills and his signature move, the Immelmann turn. Wanting to learn more about Claus, Dio willingly allows himself to be captured. He reveals to the Silvana's captain, Alex Row, the existence of one of four Mysteria which act as a key to something known as Exile.|$|E
5|$|Etal Castle is {{a ruined}} medieval {{fortification}} {{in the village}} of Etal, Northumberland, England. It was built around 1341 by Robert Manners, and comprised a residential tower, a gatehouse and a corner tower, protected by a curtain wall. The castle was involved both in local feuding and the border wars between England and Scotland. There was a <b>battle</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> rival Manners and Heron families outside the walls in 1428, and in 1513 it was briefly captured by King James IV of Scotland during his invasion of England.|$|E
5|$|In Norse mythology, Vígríðr or Óskópnir {{is a large}} field foretold to host a <b>battle</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> {{forces of}} the gods and the forces of Surtr {{as part of the}} events of Ragnarök. The field is attested in the Poetic Edda, {{compiled}} in the 13th century from earlier traditional material, and in the Prose Edda, written by Snorri Sturluson in the 13th century. The Poetic Edda briefly mentions the field as where the two forces will battle, whereas the Prose Edda features a fuller account, foretelling that it is the location of the future death of several deities (and their enemies) before the world is engulfed in flames and reborn.|$|E

5|$|It is {{possible}} that Fordun's account of the Battle of Mortlach {{is due to a}} distortion of local tradition. Mortlach is nearby the site of the battle in which Máel Coluim mac Donnchada (Malcolm III) wrested power from Lulach. Máel Coluim's first wife, Ingibiorg Finnsdottir, was the niece of Harald III of Norway, and it has been argued by Alex Woolf that the tradition of a <b>battle</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> Scots and Norwegians is due to a Scandinavian involvement on the side of Máel Coluim.|$|E
5|$|Legends of Khandoba {{generally}} {{tell about}} the <b>battle</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> deity and demons Malla and Mani. The principle written source of the legend is Malhari Mahatmya (Mallari Mahatmya), which claims {{to be from the}} chapter Kshetra-kanda of the Sanskrit text Brahmanda Purana, but is not included in standard editions of the Purana. R.C. Dhere and Sontheimer suggests that the Sanskrit Mahatmya was composed around 1460-1510 AD, mostly by a Deshastha Brahmin, to whom Khandoba is the family deity. A version is also available in Marathi by Siddhapal Kesasri (1585). Other sources include the later texts of Jayadri Mahatmya and Martanda Vijaya by Gangadhara (1821) and the oral stories of the Vaghyas, bards of the god.|$|E
5|$|On 21 June 1895, the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal {{was opened}} for traffic, {{eight years after}} work had begun.

The Autumn 1895 maneuvers simulated a high-seas <b>battle</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> I and II Divisions in the North Sea, followed by combined maneuvers {{with the rest of}} the fleet in the Baltic. Württemberg again served during the 1896 and 1897 maneuvers, though Sachsen was her only sister to join the exercises. Baden and Bayern were out of service for extensive modernization.|$|E
