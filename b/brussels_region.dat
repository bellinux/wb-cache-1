5|$|Van Roey {{made many}} of the church's {{resources}} available for hiding Jews, but was prevented from publicly condemning {{the treatment of the}} Jews by his peers, who feared a Nazi repression of the Church. German attempts to involve the Belgian authorities and local government in its implementation began to arouse protest from 1942. The Committee of Secretary-Generals, a panel of Belgian senior civil servants tasked with implementing German demands, refused from the outset to enforce anti-Jewish legislation. In June 1942, a conference of the 19 mayors of the Greater <b>Brussels</b> <b>region</b> refused to allow its officials to distribute yellow badges to Jews in their districts. At great personal risk, the mayors, led by Joseph Van De Meulebroeck, sent a letter protesting the decree to the German authorities on 5 June. The refusal of Brussels' council, and later that of the city of Liège, to distribute badges allowed many Jews to go into hiding before the deportations began.|$|E

25|$|The Brussels-Capital Region {{was formed}} on 18 June 1989, after a {{constitutional}} reform in 1988.

The <b>Brussels</b> <b>region</b> supported the proposal, but the municipality of Ixelles/Elsene was against, supported by traders on the Chaussée dÍxelles/Elsensesteenweg who feared the disruption the tracklaying would cause. The proposal was dropped and instead the section as far as Place Fernand Coq/Fernand Coqplein is to be made largely car-free.|$|E
25|$|The {{area of the}} Flemish Region is {{represented}} on the maps above. It {{has a population of}} more than 6 million (excluding the Dutch-speaking community in the <b>Brussels</b> <b>Region,</b> grey on the map for it is {{not a part of the}} Flemish Region). Roughly, the Flemish Region is responsible for territorial issues in a broad sense, including economy, employment, agriculture, water policy, housing, public works, energy, transport, the environment, town and country planning, nature conservation, credit, and foreign trade. It supervises the provinces, municipalities, and intercommunal utility companies.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} Dutch-speaking Flemish {{people in the}} Capital Region is {{estimated}} to be between 11% and 15% (official figures do not exist as there is no language census and no official subnationality). According to a survey conducted by the Université catholique de Louvain in Louvain-la-Neuve and published in June 2006, 51% of respondents from Brussels claimed to be bilingual, even if they do not have Dutch as their first language. They are governed by the <b>Brussels</b> <b>Region</b> for economics affairs and by the Flemish Community for educational and cultural issues.|$|E
50|$|An {{interesting}} {{aspect of}} the Belgian water and sanitation sector is the recognition of a basic right to water.

25|$|As {{mentioned}} above, Flemish {{institutions such}} as the Flemish Parliament and Government, represent the Flemish Community and the Flemish Region. The region and the community thus de facto share the same parliament and the same government. All these institutions are based in Brussels. Nevertheless, both types of subdivisions (the Community and the Region) still exist legally and the distinction between both is important for the people living in Brussels. Members of the Flemish Parliament who were elected in the <b>Brussels</b> <b>Region</b> cannot vote on affairs belonging to the competences of the Flemish Region.|$|E
25|$|Given its Dutch-speaking {{origins and}} the role that Brussels plays as the capital city in a bilingual country, the {{administration}} of the entire Brussels-Capital Region is fully bilingual, including its subdivisions and public services. Nevertheless, some communautarian issues remain. Flemish political parties demanded, for decades, that the Flemish part of Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde arrondissement be separated from the <b>Brussels</b> <b>Region</b> (which made Halle-Vilvoorde a monolingual Flemish arrondissement). BHV was divided mid 2012. The French-speaking population regards the language border as artificial and demands the extension of the bilingual region to at least all six municipalities with language facilities in the surroundings of Brussels. Flemish politicians have strongly rejected these proposals.|$|E
25|$|Initially, Flemish {{political}} parties demanded Flanders be given jurisdiction over cultural matters, {{concerned with the}} dominance of the French language in the federal government. Likewise, as Wallonia was in economic decline, Francophone {{political parties}} were concerned with getting economic autonomy for the French-speaking regions to address the situation. The Flemings also feared being in the minority, faced with two other French-speaking regions. They viewed the creation of a separate <b>Brussels</b> <b>region</b> as definitively cutting Brussels off from Flanders, an admission of the loss of Brussels to Francization. Essentially, the Flemings had a vision of Belgium with two parts: a Dutch-speaking part and a French-speaking part, whereas Francophones had a vision with three parts: Flanders, Brussels and Wallonia.|$|E

25|$|The second state reform {{took place}} in 1980, when the {{cultural}} communities became Communities. The Communities assumed the competencies of the cultural communities with regard to cultural matters, and became responsible for the 'matters relating to the person', such as health and youth policy. From then on, these three Communities were known as the Flemish Community, the French Community and the German-speaking Community. Two Regions were established as well in 1980: the Flemish Region and the Walloon Region. However, in Flanders it was decided in 1980 to immediately merge {{the institutions of the}} Community and the Region. Although the creation of a <b>Brussels</b> <b>Region</b> was provided for in 1970, the Brussels-Capital Region was not established until the third state reform.|$|E

2500|$|The Belçika Türk Federasyonu (BTF) is {{considered}} to be [...] "affiliated with or sympathetic" [...] to the Grey Wolves. According to a study, its aim is [...] "to foster loyalty among young people of Turkish origin to their ancestral culture, religion and history and to keep alive the Turkish identity in Europe. BTF claims to oppose not the integration of Belgian-Turks into their host society but rather their assimilation by it." [...] Its activities mostly focus on [...] "issues relevant to Turkish national sensitivities". For instance, it has demonstrated against the erection of an Armenian Genocide memorial in Brussels. During the municipal elections of 2006 two member of the BTF {{came to the attention of}} the media: Fuat Korkmazer on the Flemish Christian Democrats (CD) list in Ghent and Murat Denizli on the Francophone Socialist Party (PS) list in Schaerbeek, a commune in the <b>Brussels</b> <b>Region.</b> In both cases, political observers saw it as an attempt by Belgian parties to attract far-right Turkish voters in communes where there are numerous Turks, with or without Belgian citizenship. Korkmazer got a very low number of votes, while Denizli was elected but had to resign because it was discovered he had a false address and lived in another commune.|$|E
