5|$|Lewis died in 1893, and in {{the next}} decade the DL built no new lines. However, a group of investors bought the company, {{including}} the Dayton terminal property, in 1901 for $250,000 from Lewis's heirs. The first segment of the line into downtown Dayton was completed in late 1902, branching off the main line at Hempstead and ending at Lambeth, site of the Dayton State Hospital. Unable to obtain a franchise from Dayton, and still unprofitable, the DL entered receivership in January 1905, and was sold at foreclosure in April 1907 and reorganized in May as the Dayton, Lebanon and Cincinnati Railroad and Terminal Company. The bondholders who had organized the new company succeeded in obtaining the franchise, and sold the stock to a new group of investors in January 1909. Construction was restarted in April, and in November the branch reached the intersection of Brown and Caldwell Streets and the National Cash Register plant. Finally, after completing the cuts and fills required along the east bank of the Great Miami River, the DL opened its new main line in 1912, to a passenger depot {{on the north side of}} Washington Street, several blocks south and west of the city's main Union Station. A freight depot was located just to the north, at Eaker Street, and just beyond was an interchange track (not part of the original line) connecting to the Cincinnati, Hamilton and Dayton Railway (<b>B</b> <b>system)</b> and, via that line, the Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railway (Panhandle Route, part of the Pennsylvania system).|$|E

25|$|Connecting the new Philadelphia Branch to {{the rest}} of the <b>B</b> <b>system</b> was a {{considerable}} engineering challenge. A new surface line across the center of town was politically impossible and prohibitively expensive. Building around the outskirts of town would have required massive regrading and bridging, as the terrain is extremely hilly and the line would cut across every watershed flowing into the harbor. As a temporary expedient, traffic was handled through Baltimore on carfloats, but it was clear that a direct connection would have to be built.|$|E

40|$|There are two neutral <b>B</b> meson <b>systems</b> {{which are}} like the neutral kaon system, in that two CP-conjugate states exist: the states B 0 = bd, andB 0 =db, which we will call the Bd system; and the states B 0 s = bs,andB 0 s =sb, whichwecallthe <b>Bs</b> <b>system.</b> For early work on CP {{violation}} in the <b>B</b> <b>systems,</b> chiefly the <b>Bd</b> <b>system,</b> see Ref. 1. In both these systems the mass eigenstates are not CP eigenstates, but are mixtures of the two CP-conjugate quark states. The fact that the mixing, due to box diagrams, shown in Fig. 1, produces non-CP eigenstates {{means that there is}} a CP-violating phase that enters in the amplitude for these diagrams. The two mass eigenstates can be written, for example for the <b>Bd</b> <b>system,</b> |BL 〉 = p|B 0 〉 + q|B 0 〉, |BH 〉 = p|B 0 〉−q|B 0 〉. (1) Here H and L stand for Heavy and Light, respectively.

50|$|While {{there are}} dozens of {{different}} kinds of noise reduction, the first widely used audio noise reduction technique was developed by Ray Dolby in 1966. Intended for professional use, Dolby Type A was an encode/decode system in which the amplitude of frequencies in four bands was increased during recording (encoding), then decreased proportionately during playback (decoding). The Dolby <b>B</b> <b>system</b> (developed in conjunction with Henry Kloss) was a single band system designed for consumer products. In particular, when recording quiet parts of an audio signal, the frequencies above 1 kHz would be boosted. This had the effect of increasing the signal to noise ratio on tape up to 10 dB depending on the initial signal volume. When it was played back, the decoder reversed the process, in effect reducing the noise level by up to 10 dB. The Dolby <b>B</b> <b>system,</b> while not as effective as Dolby A, had the advantage of remaining listenable on playback systems without a decoder.|$|E
