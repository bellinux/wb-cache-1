5|$|Starfish {{sometimes}} have {{negative effects on}} ecosystems. Outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish have caused damage to coral reefs in Northeast Australia and French Polynesia. A study in Polynesia found that coral cover declined drastically {{with the arrival of}} migratory starfish in 2006, dropping from 50% to under 5% in three years. This had an unintended effect on reef-feeding fish and the whole <b>benthic</b> <b>community.</b> Asterias amurensis is one of a few echinoderm invasive species. Its larvae likely arrived in Tasmania from central Japan via water discharged from ships in the 1980s.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is a {{study of}} <b>benthic</b> <b>communities</b> to infer the impacts of various wave energy conversion (WEC) anchoring systems. This is achieved through participating in an existing method previous applied in on-going studies at Wave Hub off the North coast of Cornwall, UK. International incentives are helping to establish marine renewable energy growth and technological advances {{in an attempt to}} reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This project identifies broad benthic assemblages at Wave Hub by analysing six-hundred images and twenty video transects of benthic environments were obtained by remote sensing equipment. Identified <b>benthic</b> <b>communities</b> by were illustrated by a hierarchical clustering analysis and examined with a basic SIMPER analysis in Primer v. 6 to indicate four simple benthic assemblages. These were identifiable by abundance, characterising species, depth, temperature and substrate. Assemblage properties were used to prediction the scale of impacts on <b>benthic</b> <b>communities</b> from differing anchoring systems. Though gravity anchors do less damage to benthos than pilling techniques it is completely dependent benthos inhabiting the substrate. Mutating or damaging <b>benthic</b> <b>communities</b> can be mitigated by this and similar research post project installation...|$|R
40|$|Early {{ecological}} {{research in}} McMurdo Sound revealed local spatial gradients in community structure associated with variations in anchor ice disturbance, fast {{ice and snow}} cover, {{and the effects of}} predators. Research contrasting the east and west sides of McMurdo Sound has shown major differences in <b>benthic</b> <b>communities,</b> which have been attributed to oceanographic influences on the advection of water-column productivity and the frequency of fast ice break-out. Despite these regional and local differences, coastal <b>benthic</b> <b>communities</b> in McMurdo Sound show a high level of stability, and contain a variety of large and potentially very long-lived species. In Terra Nova Bay, about half way along the Victoria Land Coast of the western Ross Sea, the coastal <b>benthic</b> <b>communities</b> provide some insightful contrasts with those in McMurdo Sound. For example, the abundance and depth distribution of dominant species such as Sterechinus neumayeri and Adamussium colbecki are markedly different from McMurdo Sound. In both locations communities dominated by large sponges are most prolific in regions that are free from iceberg disturbance of the seabed. A recent assessment of northern Victoria Land coastal <b>benthic</b> <b>communities,</b> in conjunction with multibeam imagery of the seafloor, further highlights the importance of iceberg disturbance in structuring Antarctic <b>benthic</b> <b>communities.</b> A comparative synthesis of these coastal ecological studies enables us to generate hypotheses concerning the relative importance of different environmental drivers in structuring <b>benthic</b> <b>communities.</b> Overlain on the regular latitudinal shifts in physical factors such as light regime, are regional fluctuations that are controlled by atmospheric and oceanographic circulation patterns and coastal topography/bathymetry. Change in diversity along the western coast of the Ross Sea is predicted to be influenced by three main factors (1) ice disturbance (e. g., via anchor ice and advection of supercooled water or icebergs), (2) photosynthetically available radiation (affected by ice and snow cover and water clarity), (3) the locations of polynyas and advection of planktonic production and larvae. Interactions between these factors are expected to result in non-linear changes along the latitudinal gradient. While predictions generated from these hypotheses remain to be rigorously tested,they provide indications of how <b>benthic</b> <b>communities</b> may respond to changes in production, disturbance and the stability of coastal sea ice...|$|R

25|$|The <b>benthic</b> <b>community</b> {{has taken}} on a disproportionately large role in the food web ecology of the estuary due to key invasions by bivalves. The use of these clams, the Amur River clam (Corbula amurensis) has a wide {{salinity}} tolerance that extends into the low salinity zone, but not into freshwater. It filter feeds on phytoplankton and small zooplankton, such as calanoid copepod nauplii. The clam has few predators in the San Francisco Estuary and this allows it to grow to high densities (on the order of tens of thousands/m2). Because of its high clearance rates, it is capable of clearing the entire water column of portions of the estuary in a few days, leading to drastically depleted plankton populations. This is thought to be the main cause of a decline in ecosystem productivity after the invasion of the clams in the mid-1980s.|$|E

40|$|Ice in its {{different}} forms affects <b>benthic</b> <b>communities</b> in polar regions directly and indirectly. In order to recognize effects of ice on <b>benthic</b> <b>communities</b> this thesis analyses benthos {{on the high}} Antarctic shelf of the southeastern Weddell Sea, a typical high Antarctic habitat, influenced by seasonal sea ice coverage, <b>benthic</b> <b>communities</b> in the Larsen A/B embayments, being covered {{for hundreds of years}} by thick ice shelves, which in 1995 and 2002 disintegrated, thus providing large areas to be colonized newly by benthos, and benthos communities form the shelf {{at the tip of the}} Antarctic Peninsula, an habitat that can be considered as being unaffected by ice. The benthos in these three subregions revealed distinct differences in densities, biomasses, production, with lowest values in Larsen (680 Ind m- 2, 78 g wet weight m- 2, and 1. 7 g C m- 2 y- 1, respectively). Organism densities at the tip of the Peninsula were slightly higher as compared to the southeastern Weddell Sea Shelf (2767 Ind m- 2 vs. 2534 Ind m- 2), whereas biomass and production were higher on the southeastern Weddell Sea Shelf than at the tip of the Peninsula due to the dominance of large growing suspension feeders. The normalized biomass size spectra (NBSS) of the <b>benthic</b> <b>communities</b> in the three subregions thus exhibited significant differences in their size structure which could be associated with the different ice regimes and input of organic carbon. The slopes of the NBSS ranged from - 0. 22 on the southeastern Weddell Sea Shelf to - 0. 34 in Larsen and - 0. 50 at the tip of the Peninsula, indicating that macrobenthic communities in the SEWSS are dominated by large-bodied organisms such as suspension feeders (i. e. sponges, tunicates and bryozoans). Contrasting the <b>benthic</b> <b>communities</b> in Larsen and the tip of the Peninsula were dominated by small-bodied organisms such deposit feeders. This study clearly shows pronounced differences in structures, composition and densities/biomasses in the <b>benthic</b> <b>communities</b> in the three subregions which can be associated directly or indirectly to the prevailing different ice regimes in the three regions...|$|R

The magnitude of sediment toxicity is determined by multiple toxicity tests conducted in the lab to complement chemistry component. Toxicity LOE are determined by the mean of toxicity category score from all relevant tests. Development of LOE for benthic component is based on community metrics and abundance. Several indices such as benthic response index (BRI), benthic biotic integrity (IBI), and relative biotic index (RBI) are utilized to assess biological response of the benthic community.The median score of all individual indices will establish benthic LOE.|$|E

The main premise of this project is that relatively well preserved <b>benthic</b> <b>communities</b> can still be found in areas not affected {{by the use of}} commercialfishing gears. Moreover, a good management of the local artisanal fishery is also a key aspect to preserve these habitats and the related economic activities.
