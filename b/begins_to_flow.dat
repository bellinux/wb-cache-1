5|$|Finn {{manages to}} steal the crown, hoping to sell it instead of Bartram. In town, however, the Destiny Gang steal the crown as well as Bartram. Finn, furious, riles up the town, who begin to riot, as they are sick of being abused by the Destiny Gang. Finn goes to the Destiny Gang's mansion to confront their leader, Big Destiny. Once there, Big Destiny returns the crown, noting {{that it is the}} last {{possession}} that he will ever own. Finn looks out the window and sees that the gang is burning the city. Finn races to his home, taking Marceline with him. When he arrives at his house, the gang has already set it on fire with his parents and infant sibling trapped upstairs. Finn asks Marceline if the crown is magic and she tells him it is very dangerous magic. He then puts the crown on his head, and the power <b>begins</b> <b>to</b> <b>flow</b> through him.|$|E
5|$|Muncy Creek {{begins in}} southeastern Laporte Township, Sullivan County, near its border with Davidson Township, Sullivan County. The creek flows {{southwest}} and then west {{for a short}} distance before reaching the border between Laporte Township and Davidson Township. It then turns southwest as it begins to follow this border. Shortly afterwards it turns northwest and <b>begins</b> <b>to</b> <b>flow</b> into a valley, then turns west and begins receiving very short tributaries from both sides. Examples of these include Rock Run and Lopez Pond Branch. After picking up Peters Creek, one such tributary, Muncy Creek turns southwest and passes the community of Nordmont, where the tributary Elklick Run flows into it. The creek then turns southwest and later west. Deep Hollow Run then enters the creek, which heads south away from the Laporte Township/Davidson Township border. Upon leaving behind the Laporte Township/Davidson Township border, the creek enters Davidson Township and heads west-southwest, passing a gauging station. After several miles, it reaches the community of Sonestown, where the tributary Big Run flows into it from the north. Muncy Creek then makes a sharp bend south and begins flowing parallel to U.S. Route 220. After a few miles, it passes the community of Muncy Valley and makes a sharp turn south, exiting Davidson Township.|$|E

25|$|The {{main cause}} of flow within glaciers can be {{attributed}} to an increase in the surface slope, brought upon by an imbalance between the amounts of accumulation vs. ablation. This imbalance increases the shear stress on a glacier until it <b>begins</b> <b>to</b> <b>flow.</b> The flow velocity and deformation will increase as the equilibrium line between these two processes is approached, but are also affected by the slope of the ice, the ice thickness and temperature.|$|E
25|$|The video {{features}} the band {{in a dark}} room, where the appearance of falling water {{in front of the}} band distorts and blurs the band members' faces (an idea suggested by Cobain). Throughout the video, clips such as cells multiplying at an incredible rate, to a living organism in its embryotic stages are shown. The video clip also features Kurt Cobain swinging away on a chandelier throughout the room, and water <b>begins</b> <b>to</b> <b>flow</b> into the room. In addition, the video shows parts involving a dog wearing a cone collar. Images of a baby swimming underwater (a reference to the cover of Nevermind) and a pistol floating appear. Towards the end, a clip of the band appears, with Cobain in the front, lying on the ground and kissing the camera.|$|E
25|$|Another large {{component}} of the remodelling process is the disconnection of branched vessels, which then migrate to distal areas in order to supply blood homogeneously. Branching morphogenesis {{has been found to}} follow the dielectric breakdown model, in that only the vessels with sufficient flow will enlarge, while others will close off. At locations inside the vessel where two tube split off from one, one arm of the split is likely to close, detach, and migrate towards the venous line, where it will re-attach. The result of the closure of a branch is that flow increases and becomes less turbulent in the main line, while blood also <b>begins</b> <b>to</b> <b>flow</b> towards areas which are lacking. Which branch will close depends on the flow rate, direction, and branching angle; in general, a branching angle of 75° or more will necessitate the closing of the smaller branch.|$|E

The creek then turns southeast for a few miles, passing through Newtown Township, Delaware County and entering Radnor Township, where it receives its first two named tributaries, Thomas Run and Little Darby Creek, from the [...] and , respectively. The creek then turns south-southeast for several tenths of a mile before turning southeast for several more miles. In this reach, it receives the tributary Miles Run from the left and the tributary Camp Run from the right. The creek eventually turns east briefly before receiving the tributary Ithan Creek from the left and turning south-southeast for several miles along the border between Marple Township and Haverford Township. In this reach, the creek flows alongside Interstate 476 and crosses it once. As it continues downstream alongside the highway, it crosses Pennsylvania Route 3 and receives the tributary Longford Run from the left. Near Pilgrim Gardens, it turns southeast again and <b>begins</b> <b>to</b> <b>flow</b> along the border between Upper Darby Township and Springfield Township, crossing US Route 1 and receiving the tributaries Colleen Brook and Lewis Run from the left and right, respectively. Further downstream, the creek's valley becomes much steeper and narrower and it makes several meanders as it passes by Clifton Heights and Landsowne before flowing along the border between Aldan and Yeadon. The creek then flows south-southeast for a few miles, leaving its valley and passing Darby, Collingdale, Sharon Hill, and Colwyn as it crosses US Route 13. It then receives the tributary Cobbs Creek from the left.|$|E

2500|$|An orogeny is {{underway}} when mountains begin {{to grow in}} the collision zone. There are other modes of mountain formation and orogeny but certainly continental collision {{is one of the most}} important. Rainfall and snowfall increase on the mountains as these rise, perhaps at a rate of a few millimeters per year (at a growth rate of 1mm/year, a 5,000m tall mountain can form in 5million years, a time period that is less than 10% of the life of a typical collision zone). River systems form, and glaciers may grow on the highest peaks. Erosion accelerates as the mountains rise, and great volumes of sediment are shed into the rivers, which carry sediment away from the mountains to be deposited in sedimentary basins in the surrounding lowlands. Crustal rocks are thrust faulted over the sediments and the mountain belt broadens as it rises in height. A crustal root also develops, as required by isostasy; mountains can be high if underlain by thicker crust. Crustal thickening may happen as a result of crustal shortening or when one crust overthrusts the other. Thickening is accompanied by heating, so the crust becomes weaker as it thickens. The lower crust <b>begins</b> <b>to</b> <b>flow</b> and collapse under the growing mountain mass, forming rifts near the crest of the mountain range. The lower crust may partially melt, forming anatectic granites which then rise into the overlying units, forming granite intrusions. Crustal thickening provides one of two negative feedbacks on mountain growth in collision zones, the other being erosion. The popular notion that erosion is responsible for destroying mountains is only half correct - viscous flow of weak lower mantle also reduces relief with time, especially once the collision is complete and [...] the two continents are completely sutured. [...] Convergence between the continents continues because the crust is still being pulled down by oceanic lithosphere sinking in the subduction zone to either side of the collision as well as beneath the impinging continent.|$|E
