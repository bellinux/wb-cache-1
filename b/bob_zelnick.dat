50|$|On March 31, 2007, {{the play}} began previews on Broadway. It officially opened as a limited {{engagement}} at the Bernard B.

50|$|Frost {{recruited}} James Reston, Jr. and ABC News producer <b>Bob</b> <b>Zelnick</b> {{to evaluate}} the Watergate minutiae prior to the interview. Their research allowed Frost {{to take control of}} the interview at a key moment, when he revealed details of a previously unknown conversation between Nixon and Charles Colson. Nixon's resulting admissions would support the widespread conclusion that he had obstructed justice. Nixon continued to deny the allegations until his death in 1994, and it was never tested in a court of law because his successor, Gerald Ford, issued a pardon to Nixon one month after his resignation. Nixon's negotiated fee was $600,000 and a 20% share of any profits.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{observers}} {{have said that}} Peretz's charge of anti-Semitism {{on the part of}} Marius—who castigated figures such as Martin Luther for their anti-Semitic writings in his scholarly work—was false. Marius claimed that Peretz had seen Marius as a rival ever since 1993, when Gore largely chose to use Marius' image-rich Holocaust speech for the Warsaw Uprising event, keeping only a paragraph from an alternate, statistics-laden speech Peretz had submitted to Gore. University of Tennessee historian Milton Klein, whose European relatives were murdered during the Holocaust in Hungary, said that he and Marius had often argued about the Israel-Palestine issue during their 26 years of friendship, but Marius had never said a single thing that indicated any anti-Semitic feelings. In Gore: A Political Life, ABC News correspondent <b>Bob</b> <b>Zelnick</b> wrote that Marius had no history of anti-Semitism and that [...] "most Gore's staff felt that Marius had been wronged and that the vice president had acted to keep Peretz happy rather than to protect his office." ...|$|E
