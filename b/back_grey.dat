500|$|This long-winged petrel is [...] {{long with}} an [...] wingspan, {{and an average}} weight of 290g (10.3in). It has a grey <b>back,</b> <b>grey</b> wings with a dark [...] "W" [...] marking across them, and a grey upper tail. The undersides of the wings are blackish apart from a {{triangle}} of white at the front edge near the body, and the belly is white with grey flanks. The head has a mottled whitish-brown forehead, a dark cap, and a dark spot below and behind the brown eye. The bill is black and the legs are flesh pink, the colour continuing onto the first third of the feet, {{the rest of the}} toes and webs being black-brown. It gives the general impression of a small Cory's or great shearwater, with a fast flight; in strong winds it shears high above the surface with angled wings. Nothing is known of the fresh juvenile plumage or the moult sequence, and ageing birds is currently not feasible.|$|E
2500|$|The {{species was}} first scientifically {{described}} by Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 edition of Systema Naturae {{under the current}} binomial name. His description is L cauda cuneiformi lateribus alba, dorso cano, alis nigris macula alba – [...] "a shrike with a wedge-shaped white-bordered tail, <b>back</b> <b>grey,</b> wings black with white spot". At that time, {{none of the other}} grey shrikes – including the lesser grey shrike (L. minor), for which the description of the tail pattern is incorrect and which some authors already recognized as distinct – were considered separate species by Linnaeus, but that was to change soon.|$|E

50|$|P. pilligaensis is a {{small brown}} mouse with grey-brown upper parts, the head and <b>back</b> <b>greyer,</b> grading through russet flanks to white underparts.

5000|$|It is {{a typical}} [...] "sylvia" [...] warbler, similar in size but slimmer than Sardinian warbler. The adults have a plain <b>grey</b> <b>back</b> and paler <b>grey</b> underparts. The bill is fine and pointed, with brown legs and red eyes. The {{striking}} male has a black head and, usually, a black throat, separated by a white malar streak ("moustache"). Females have a pale throat, and the head is grey rather than black. Their <b>grey</b> <b>back</b> has a brownish tinge. The song is a slower, deeper rattle than that of Sardinian warbler.|$|R
5000|$|The {{adult is}} 37 - 41 cm in length with a {{wingspan}} of 91 - 105 cm {{and a body}} mass of 305 - 525 g. It has a white head and body, grey <b>back,</b> <b>grey</b> wings tipped solid black, black legs and a yellow bill. Occasional individuals have pinky-grey to reddish legs, inviting confusion with red-legged kittiwake. In winter, this species acquires a dark grey smudge behind the eye and a grey hind-neck collar.|$|E
50|$|The chukar is a rotund 32 - 35 cm long partridge, with a {{light brown}} <b>back,</b> <b>grey</b> breast, and buff belly. The shades vary across the various populations. The face is white with a black gorget. It has -streaked flanks, red legs and coral red bill. Sexes are similar, the female {{slightly}} smaller in size and lacking the spur. The tail has 14 feathers, the third primary is the longest while the first is level with the fifth and sixth primaries.|$|E
50|$|The Calabar angwantibo weighs between 266 and 465 grams. It has orangish-yellow fur on its <b>back,</b> <b>grey</b> {{or white}} fur on its belly, and a {{distinctive}} white line on its forehead and nose. Like other lorids, this angwantibo {{has a very}} short index finger, which allows it to get a strong grip on tree branches. The second toe on each foot has a specialised claw that the angwantibo uses for grooming. The Calabar angwantibo is the only primate to have a functioning nictitating membrane (third eyelid).|$|E
50|$|The plumage of juveniles {{is white}} on the belly, foreneck, forehead, and breast. The <b>back</b> is <b>grey</b> and the bill is black. Immature birds have plumage similar to adult terns.|$|R

The CD player also required use of a separate amplifier mounted under the CD player. The door and glove box trim was a suede like pale blue/grey Alcantara. The last European spec 200SX was made in Dec '93. Sales in the UK continued throughout '94.|$|E
50|$|The {{two species}} are {{physically}} very similar. They have a white head and body, grey <b>back,</b> <b>grey</b> wings tipped solid black {{and a yellow}} bill. Black-legged kittiwake adults are somewhat larger (roughly 40 cm in length with a wingspan of 90 - 100 cm) than red-legged kittiwakes (35 - 40 cm in length with a wingspan around 84 - 90 cm). Other differences include a shorter bill, larger eyes, a larger, rounder head and darker grey wings in the red-legged kittiwake. While most black-legged kittiwakes do, indeed, have dark-grey legs, some have pinkish-grey to reddish legs, making colouration a somewhat unreliable identifying marker.|$|E
5000|$|Grey Wolfs Zeta Gundam (nicknamed [...] "Buster Zeta") unit is {{a yellow}} colour with two {{additional}} fins/airfoils on its upper <b>back.</b> <b>Grey</b> Wolf is unhappy with his machines colors {{and would have}} preferred it to be grey. This, coupled with his nickname, his [...] "Grey Wolf" [...] logo {{and the fact that}} he is a former Zeon pilot, seems to imply that Grey Wolf is actually Zeon ace pilot Shin Matsunaga, the infamous [...] "White Wolf of Solomon". Similarly, the original pilot of Red Snakes Zeta is implied to be Johnny Ridden, who was reassigned since Red Zeta is a Newtype-use machine.|$|E

5000|$|These are superficially [...] birds, {{typically}} with a {{light brown}} or grey <b>back,</b> <b>grey</b> breast and buff belly. The face is white or whitish with a dark gorget. Their specialized flank coverts give them the appearance of being more rotund than they actually are. Alectoris exhibit rufous-streaked flanks and red legs armed with well-developed, ball hammer like spurs. When disturbed they run very rapidly, often uphill. When pressed, rock partridges take to the wing. Their wings are long and fairly sharp, shaped rather {{like those of the}} ptarmigan and spruce grouse, suggesting that the birds sustain themselves in flight over substantial distances to find food. This probably occurs most often during winter.|$|E
