25|$|A baler is a {{piece of}} farm {{machinery}} used to compress a cut and raked crop (such as hay, straw, or silage) into compact bales that are easy to handle, transport and store. Several different types of <b>balers</b> are commonly used, each producing a different type of bales – rectangular or cylindrical (round), of various sizes, bound with twine, netting, or wire. The round hay baler was invented by Ummo F. Luebben of Sutton, Nebraska, which he conceived with his brother Melchior in 1903, and then patented in 1910. The invention of the round hay baler revolutionized the laborious task of haying into a one-man, low-cost operation with a machine that automatically gathered the hay, rolled into a round bale, and ejected it.|$|E

2500|$|Farming {{activities}} were very labour-intensive before {{the industrial revolution}} {{and the advent of}} tractors, combines, <b>balers,</b> etc. From the late 19th century to the mid-20th century, a great percentage of the Canadian labour force was engaged in high labour, smaller farming practices. After mechanization, scientific advancement, improved marketing practices farms became more efficient, larger and less labour-intensive. The labour population was freed up and went to industry, government, transportation, trade and finance. [...] Agriculture, stock raising and horticulture employed one-fourth of the Canadian population according to the 1951 census as well as providing products for exports and Canadian manufacturing concerns.|$|E
60|$|She {{had settled}} {{lower and lower}} in the water, and {{suddenly}} with a sound of rending planks she thrust down her bows like a diving water-fowl, her stern flew up into the air, and with a long sucking noise she shot down swifter and swifter until the leaping waves closed over her high poop lantern. With one impulse the boat swept round again and made backwards as fast as willing arms could pull it. But all was quiet {{at the scene of}} the disaster. Not even a fragment of wreckage was left upon the surface to show where the Golden Rod had found her last harbour. For a long quarter of an hour they pulled round and round in the moonlight, but not a glimpse could they see of the Puritan seaman, and at last, when in spite of the <b>balers</b> the water was washing round their ankles, they put her head about once more, and made their way in silence and with heavy hearts to their dreary island of refuge.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} fuel efficiency of tractor using working cycle. First, <b>baler</b> operation was conducted in Italian ryegrass farmlands and engine torque and fuel consumption were measured as field data. Second, <b>baler</b> operation cycle was developed using the field data. The arbitrary working cycles were generated by randomly selected micro–trips, minimum working patterns. Some of the arbitrary working cycles were selected and <b>baler</b> operation cycle was determined considering sum of squared difference (SSD). The <b>baler</b> operation cycle was evaluated using performance value (PV) comparing with driving cycles. The results showed that PVs of the driving cycles were 67 ～ 109 % of the <b>baler</b> operation cycle. Third, fuel efficiency of the <b>baler</b> operation was evaluated by dynamometer test using dynamometer system and the <b>baler</b> operation cycle. The fuel consumption and engine power were measured while the engine acted on the <b>baler</b> operation cycle and fuel efficiency was evaluated. The results of t–test showed no significant difference between fuel efficiency by the dynamometer test and fuel efficiency of each farmland by the field test. Considering all results of this study, the <b>baler</b> operation cycle is feasible to apply to evaluate fuel efficiency of tractor with dynamometer system...|$|R

The men helped me to do that job the last thing before they started. Then I blocked up the entrance, leaving only just room for me to crawl in and out. The snow began to fall steadily three days after the others had gone, and very soon covered my hut two feet deep. I melted the blubber of the whale in the boat's baler, for we had towed the fish ashore. The first potful or two I boiled over a few bits of drift-wood. After that it was easy enough, as I unravelled some of the boat's rope, dipped it in the hot blubber, and made a store of big candles. There was a lot of meat left on the sea-cows, so I cut that up, froze it, and stowed as much as I could in the hut. I was bothered about the rest, as I knew the bears were likely to come down; but I found a ledge {{on the face of the}} perpendicular rock, and by putting the boat's mast against it I was able to get up to it. Here I piled, I should say, a ton of meat and blubber. Then I set to work and collected some dried grass, and soon I had enough to serve as bed and covers. It took me a month to do all this, and by that time winter was down on me in earnest. I had spent my evenings in making myself, out of the skins of the three cows, breeches, high boots, and a coat with a hood over the head, and in order to make these soft I rubbed them with hot oil. They were rough things, but I hoped that I might get a bear later on. Fortunately the boat had two <b>balers,</b> for I required one in which to melt the snow over the lamp.|$|E

5|$|In 1897, {{before the}} onset of {{fighting}} in Puerto Rico, Juan Alonso Zayas, born in San Juan, was a second lieutenant in the Spanish Army when he received orders to head for the Philippines to take command of the 2nd Expeditionary Battalion stationed in <b>Baler.</b> He arrived in Manila, the capital, in May 1897. There he took a vessel and headed for <b>Baler,</b> on the island of Luzon. The distance between Manila and <b>Baler</b> is 62 miles (100km); if traveled through the jungles and badly built roads, the actual distance was 144 miles (230km). At that time a system of communication between Manila and <b>Baler</b> was almost non-existent. The only way <b>Baler</b> received news from Manila was by way of vessels. The Spanish colonial government was under constant attack from local Filipino groups who wanted independence. Zayas's mission was to fortify <b>Baler</b> against any possible attack. Among his plans for the defense of <b>Baler</b> was to convert the local church of San Luis de Tolosa into a fort.|$|R

5000|$|Not all {{stationary}} {{wire tying}} <b>balers</b> used 2 wires. It {{was not uncommon}} for the larger bale size (usually 17" [...] x 22") machines to use 'boards' that had three slots for wires and hence tied three wires per bale. Most North American manufacturers produced these machines as either regular models or as size options. 'Small square' three wire tying pick-up <b>balers</b> were available from the early 1930s, principally from J. I. Case & Co. and Ann Arbor. These machines were hand tying and hand threading machines. Although New Holland credits itself with inventing the 'successful small square twine tying baler', it produced such machines {{for the first time}} in 1940 after acquiring Ed Nolte and his baler. This baler baled successfully from 1937 onwards. Certainly the quality of the New Holland machines, popularised twine tying hay <b>balers.</b> In Europe, in as early as 1939, both Claas of Germany and Rousseau SA of France had automatic twine tying pick-up <b>balers.</b> Most of these produced low density bales though. The first successful pick-up <b>balers</b> were made by the Ann Arbor Company in 1929. Ann Arbor were acquired by the Oliver Farm Equipment Company in 1943. Despite their head start on the rest of the field, no Ann Arbor <b>balers</b> carried automatic knotters or twisters. Oliver introduced these in 1949.|$|E

50|$|Mobile <b>balers,</b> {{machines}} which {{gather and}} bale hay in one process, were first developed around 1940. The first <b>balers</b> produced rectangular bales small {{enough for a}} person to lift, usually between 70 and 100 lb each. The size and shape made it possible for people to pick bales up, stack them on a vehicle for transport to a storage area, then build a haystack by hand. However, to save labor and increase safety, loaders and stackers were also developed to mechanise the transport of small bales from the field to the haystack. Later in the 20th century, <b>balers</b> were developed capable of producing large bales that weigh up to 3000 lb.|$|E
