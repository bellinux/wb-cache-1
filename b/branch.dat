The rails and sleepers of the <b>branch</b> were removed in around 1947, and the trackbed became a dirt road and footpath.

5|$|An {{extension}} {{of a proposed}} Madison Avenue Line and the IND Sixth Avenue Line operating via 59th Street, with two branches. One <b>branch</b> would have operated along Second Avenue with a <b>branch</b> connecting to the IRT Pelham Line, which {{would have had to}} be modified to fit B Division subway cars, and a <b>branch</b> connecting to the IND Concourse Line. The other <b>branch</b> would have continued under the East River, and would have been connected to the Long Island Rail Road main line in the Sunnyside area. Subway trains would have continued via the Port Washington <b>Branch</b> to Little Neck, and via the LIRR Main Line to Rego Park, where it would have turned via the former Rockaway Beach <b>Branch</b> and then would have turned onto the Lower Montauk <b>Branch,</b> and would have continued on the <b>branch</b> through Jamaica, where it would continue via the Atlantic <b>Branch</b> until Rosedale, staying within city limits.

40|$|Highly {{purified}} {{fractions of}} three starch <b>branching</b> enzymes from developing maize (Zea mays L.) endosperm {{were used to}} prepare antisera in rabbits. In double diffusion experiments, no immunoprecipitate was observed when <b>branching</b> enzyme IIa or IIb was tested against <b>branching</b> enzyme I antiserum. No immunoprecipitate was formed when <b>branching</b> enzyme I was tested against <b>branching</b> enzyme IIa or IIb antiserum. Increasing amounts of antisera in the above combinations also failed to inhibit enzyme activity. <b>Branching</b> enzyme IIa antiserum cross-reacted and formed spurs with <b>branching</b> enzyme IIb when compared with <b>branching</b> enzyme IIa antigen. Comparison of <b>branching</b> enzyme IIb antiserum with <b>branching</b> enzyme IIa also resulted in an immunoprecipitate. Increasing levels of <b>branching</b> enzyme IIa antiserum inhibited <b>branching</b> enzyme IIb as did the reciprocal combination. The data indicated that <b>branching</b> enzymes IIa and IIb are immunologically similar while <b>branching</b> enzyme I is distinct. The data supports the classification of starch <b>branching</b> enzymes based on genetic, kinetic, and chromatographic properties...|$|R

5|$|In March 1908, the {{off-peak}} {{shuttle service}} {{began to use}} the western tunnel on the <b>branch,</b> crossing between the two <b>branch</b> tunnels south of Holborn. Low usage led to {{the withdrawal of the}} second peak-hour shuttle and the eastern tunnel was taken out of use in 1914. Sunday services ended in April 1917 and, in August of the same year, the eastern tunnel and the bay platform at Holborn were formally closed. Passenger numbers on the <b>branch</b> remained low: when the <b>branch</b> was considered for closure in 1929, its annual usage was 1,069,650 and takings were Â£4,500.

40|$|The {{mammalian}} lung develops through <b>branching</b> morphogenesis. Two primary {{forms of}} <b>branching,</b> which occur in order, in the lung have been identified: tip bifurcation and side <b>branching.</b> However, {{the mechanisms of}} lung <b>branching</b> morphogenesis remain to be explored. In our previous study, a biological mechanism was presented for lung <b>branching</b> pattern formation through a <b>branching</b> model. Here, we provide a mathematical mechanism underlying the <b>branching</b> patterns. By decoupling the <b>branching</b> model, we demonstrated the existence of Turing instability. We performed Turing instability analysis to reveal the mathematical mechanism of the <b>branching</b> patterns. Our simulation {{results show that the}} Turing patterns underlying the <b>branching</b> patterns are spot patterns that exhibit high local morphogen concentration. The high local morphogen concentration induces the growth of <b>branching.</b> Furthermore, we found that the sparse spot patterns underlie the tip bifurcation patterns, while the dense spot patterns underlies the side <b>branching</b> patterns. The dispersion relation analysis shows that the Turing wavelength affects the <b>branching</b> structure. As the wavelength decreases, the spot patterns change from sparse to dense, the rate of tip bifurcation decreases and side <b>branching</b> eventually occurs instead. In the process of transformation, there may exists hybrid <b>branching</b> that mixes tip bifurcation and side <b>branching.</b> Since experimental studies have reported that <b>branching</b> mode switching from side <b>branching</b> to tip bifurcation in the lung is under genetic control, our simulation results suggest that genes control the switch of the <b>branching</b> mode by regulating the Turing wavelength. Our results provide a novel insight into and understanding of the formation of <b>branching</b> patterns in the lung and other biological systems...|$|R

40|$|Starch <b>branching</b> enzyme was {{purified}} from potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) tubers as {{a single}} species of 79 kilodaltons and specific antibodies were prepared against both the native enzyme and against the gel-purified, denatured enzyme. The activity of potato <b>branching</b> enzyme could only be neutralized by antinative potato <b>branching</b> enzyme, whereas both types of antibodies reacted with denatured potato <b>branching</b> enzyme. Starch <b>branching</b> enzymes were also isolated from maize (Zea mays L.) kernels. All of the denatured forms of the maize enzyme reacted with antidenatured potato <b>branching</b> enzyme, whereas recognition by antinative potato <b>branching</b> enzyme was limited to maize <b>branching</b> enzymes I and IIb. Antibodies directed against the denatured potato enzyme were unable to neutralize the activity {{of any of the}} maize <b>branching</b> enzymes. Antinative potato <b>branching</b> enzyme fully inhibited the activity of maize <b>branching</b> enzyme I; the neutralized maize enzyme was identified as a 82 kilodalton protein.
