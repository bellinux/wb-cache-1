Also, it is not just for a specific single group or discipline in a treatment team; it is the entire medical community who benefits from it. Given the importance of this issue, this study examined the viewpoints of the specialist physicians in Qom province on the most common issues in medical ethics, with the hope to take a step forward through identifying common problems and solving them. Methods: This descriptive study used the Delphi Method in which the views of the specialist physicians on the medical ethics were analyzed through two questionnaires. The first questionnaire contained some open questions, and the second one was designed to rank and rate the titles of medical ethics problems in terms of their prevalence. Results: The most common problems in medical ethics derived from the first questionnaire based on the order of priority were: secrecy, doctor-patient relationship, justice, telling the truth, privacy, informed consent, relationship with colleagues, patient's participation in treatment methods, dealing with improper treatment and interaction between the physician and treatment authorities.

40|$|Abstract. Currently used CAM {{systems for}} 5 -axis {{machining}} can determine tool paths with collision-free tool postures. However, the algorithm {{implemented in the}} CAM systems sometimes generates un-optimum tool paths and postures {{from the viewpoint of}} machining processes and machine tool operation. This study proposes two methods to determine tool paths and tool postures for 5 -axis machining <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>viewpoints</b> of “human intuition ” and “minimum cusp height ” for resolving the problems. A method is developed for inputting the positions and postures of a cutting tool when executing virtual machining. In the execution of virtual machining, a virtual cutting tool can be intuitively moved by a haptic device to determine the desired locations and postures of the cutting tool. By using the system, the tool locations and tool postures to machine complicated shapes with overhang can be easily determined based on the operator’s intuition. Another method is for determining tool postures for making minimum cusp height by matching the cutting edge of a flat end-mill to the cross-section shape at a point on surfaces to be machined. A basic system to determine the tool postures based on making minimum cusp height was developed. The cusp height on the surfaces generated by the basic system was smaller than the height generated by 3 -axis ball-end milling...|$|E

Because of these threats, farmers keep using conventional tillage method (with the value of 47 percent) in spite of their awareness about the benefits of conservation tillage and no-tillage methods. In this situation, the recommended measures are; making new policies for the land integration, performing qualitative research specially on new machinery, clarifying the government's policies on exporting and importing agricultural products and on the amount of guaranteed prices of products before starting the growing season.
