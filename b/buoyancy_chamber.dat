50|$|The Handyman {{lifebuoy}} {{light had}} a <b>buoyancy</b> <b>chamber</b> filled with air {{to keep it}} afloat. It {{was attached to the}} lifebuoy with a long cord, and to the boat with a shorter cord. When the lifebuoy was thrown overboard, the short cord pulled away two plugs, one to let sea water in and one to let gas out. For the mast-head distress signal light and the Deck Flare the two plugs were removed by hand and the units placed in a bucket of water.|$|E
50|$|At {{the same}} time as {{developing}} the Beardmore W.B.IV, G. Tilghman Richards, the chief designer of Beardmore, designed a second aircraft to meet an Admiralty requirement for a ship-borne fighter aircraft to be armed with a 37 mm Le-Puteaux quick firing gun in order to destroy airships. The resulting aircraft, the W.B.V, was a single seater two-bay tractor biplane powered by a 200 hp (149 kW) Hispano-Suiza engine. The wings folded for storage onboard ship. The manually loaded Le-Puteaux gun was mounted between the cylinder banks of the V-8 engine, firing through a hollow propeller shaft. Unlike the W.B.V, the W.B.IV was not fitted with a <b>buoyancy</b> <b>chamber,</b> being instead fitted with inflatable flotation bags.|$|E
5000|$|The Mk 6 {{mine was}} a 34 in {{diameter}} steel sphere containing a <b>buoyancy</b> <b>chamber</b> and 300 lb of TNT. [...] Each mine was constructed of two steel hemispheres welded together. A Toxyl bursting charge was cast {{into the lower}} hemisphere. Toxyl {{was a mixture of}} 60% trinitroxylene (TNX) with 40% TNT used because the United States Army controlled United States TNT production and would not release sufficient quantities for the naval mine barrage. [...] For transport, the mine rested atop a box-shaped steel anchor approximately 30 in square. The anchor box had wheels allowing the mine assembly to be moved along a system of rails aboard the minelayer. The mine was connected to its 800 lb anchor box by a wire rope mooring cable stored on a reel. [...] The depth of the mine below the water surface was controlled by allowing the steel mooring cable to unwind from its reel as the mine was dropped from the minelayer until a sensor suspended beneath the anchor reached the bottom. The sensor locked the cable reel so the falling anchor would pull the buoyant mine below the surface; and the float extended the antenna above the mine. [...] Each mine had two hydrostatic safety features intended to render the mine safe if it detached from its mooring cable and floated to the surface. The first was an open switch in the detonation circuit closed by hydrostatic pressure. The second was a spring pushing the detonator away from the explosive charge into the <b>buoyancy</b> <b>chamber</b> unless compressed by hydrostatic pressure. The mines were intended to be safe at depths less than 25 ft.|$|E

50|$|Triumph {{was lost}} {{off the coast}} of Oregon in 1961. Five of the six sailors aboard her lost their lives. More modern motor {{lifeboats}} are designed to be self-righting -- they mount <b>buoyancy</b> <b>chambers</b> which will rapidly force the boats right-side-up, if they overturned.|$|R
5000|$|As {{a result}} of {{competition}} from the Collins Line, Cunard ordered [...] of 1856, the first iron Blue Riband winner. Scotia was originally planned as a sister for Persia. However, the project was delayed after {{the loss of the}} Collins [...] and [...] left Cunard without effective competition on the express service. [...] When Scotia was finally built, she was a larger edition of Persia with an extra deck. [...] Safety improvements included seven watertight compartments, a reinforced forward bulkhead and <b>buoyancy</b> <b>chambers.</b>|$|R
50|$|In the 1850s the Briton Ferry Floating Dock Company was incorporated, {{and bought}} {{land from the}} Earl of Jersey to build the Briton Ferry Docks. When it opened in 1861, the dock {{consisted}} of an outer tidal basin, and an inner floating dock, where the water level was maintained by a single gate, which included a <b>buoyancy</b> <b>chamber.</b> It covered an area of 23.7 acre. The gate was 56 ft wide, and the unique structure with its floating caisson was designed by Brunel's father, Sir Marc Brunel. Following Brunel's death in 1859, Robert Brereton took over as engineer, and also acted as engineer for improvements made in 1872 and 1873.The company later went bankrupt and the Great Western Railway took over the docks as a going concern. After World War II many warships were scrapped there, until the dock was closed in 1959. As part of a regeneration programme, a tower, which formed part of the complex, has been refurbished. It was an accumulator tower for the hydraulic system which operated the dock gate and cranes. The system was designed by William Armstrong, and in 2010, the Institute of Civil Engineers unveiled a plaque at the site to commemorate the 200th anniversary of his birth.|$|E
40|$|The {{concept design}} of a {{lightweight}} cryogenic marine heavy lift buoyancy system has been investigated. The approach makes use of a novel cryogenic system for provision of buoyancy within the ocean environment. The objective {{is to be able}} to lift or lower large displacement objects under full remote control. The nature of subsea lifting and lowering operations requires a high degree of precise control for operational safety, reasons and to preserve the structural integrity of the load. The lift operation occurs in two phases: Development of lift to overcome seabed suction, and then rapid reduction of buoyancy to maintain a controlled ascent. Descent involves controlled release of the buoyancy. The proposed buoyancy system consists of a <b>buoyancy</b> <b>chamber</b> and an integral cryogenic gas generation unit. The application of an on-board gas generation unit allows the removal of the engineering challenges associated with use of compressors and the concomitant complex manifold of connecting umbilical pipe work. It provides for a fully remote system completely eliminating all risk associated with extensive physical surface to subsea connection throughout the entire lift operation. The opening stages of the project work include the development of a system that will operate efficiently and effectively to a depth of 350 m. An initial general arrangement for the buoyancy system has been developed. A number of these systems involve considerable design and development, these include: structural design of the <b>buoyancy</b> <b>chamber,</b> mechanical systems to control and connection to the lift device, the cryogenic system itself and overall process control systems. As part of the design process for such an arrangement, numerical simulation of the complete system has been undertaken in order to develop mechanical, cryogenic and process control systems efficiently and effectively. This system simulation has been developed using Matlab Simulink. This paper considers the overall design concept and associated system development issues. These are illustrated through use of the time accurate simulation of alternative design configurations that confirm the viability of the concept. A main conclusion is that minimisation of the dry weight of the system is critical to cost-effective operation of the project...|$|E
40|$|New {{methods for}} marine salvage and {{decommissioning}} of {{structures in the}} open sea are continually being sought {{in order to improve}} control and lower operational costs [1]. The concept design of a lightweight, cryogenic, marine, heavy lift, buoyancy system has been investigated [2]. The objective {{is to be able to}} raise or lower high mass objects controlled solely from a surface support vessel. The overall design concept and associated system development issues have been discussed previously. A number of the sub-systems in one complete buoyancy system involve considerable design and development, these include: structural design of the <b>buoyancy</b> <b>chamber,</b> mechanical systems to control and connection to the lift device, the cryogenic system itself and overall process control systems. The main area of concern in the design process is the composite cryogenic Dewar. This is required to operate not only at temperatures as low as - 196 oC but also to withstand pressure differences exceeding 35 bar. As such the composite materials have to perform in a very aggressive environment. This work details a method for fully submersed composite cryogenic testing in order to qualify the materials for use in the Dewar of the buoyancy system...|$|E
5000|$|A {{floating}} {{dry dock}} {{is a type}} of pontoon for dry docking ships, possessing floodable <b>buoyancy</b> <b>chambers</b> and a [...] "U"-shaped cross-section. The walls are used to give the dry dock stability when the floor or deck is {{below the surface of the}} water. When valves are opened, the chambers fill with water, causing the dry dock to float lower in the water. The deck becomes submerged and this allows a ship to be moved into position inside. When the water is pumped out of the chambers, the dry dock rises and the ship is lifted out of the water on the rising deck, allowing work to proceed on the ship's hull.|$|R
5000|$|Aluminum: Before the {{invention}} of fiberglass, this was the standard choice for whitewater canoeing. It is good value and very strong by weight. This material was once more popular but is being replaced by modern lighter materials. [...] "It is tough, durable, and will take being dragged over the bottom very well", as it has no gel or polymer outer coating {{which would make it}} subject to abrasion. The hull does not degrade from long term exposure to sunlight, and [...] "extremes of hot and cold do not affect the material". It can dent, is difficult to repair, is noisy, can get stuck on underwater objects, and requires <b>buoyancy</b> <b>chambers</b> to assist in keeping the canoe afloat in a capsize.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} hull collapsed {{during the}} final construction because of a design flaw. [...] It was towed into Gandsfjord where {{it was to be}} lowered in the water in a controlled ballasting operation at a rate of 1 meter per 20 minutes. This was necessary for the fitment of the deck platform to the hull. As the hull was lowered to the 65 m mark, rumbling noises were heard followed by the sound of water pouring into the unit. A cell wall had failed and a serious crack had developed, and sea water poured in at a rate that was too great for the deballasting pumps to deal with. Within a few minutes the hull began sinking at a rate of 1 meter per minute. As the structure sank deeper into the 210 m fjord, the <b>buoyancy</b> <b>chambers</b> imploded and the rubble struck the floor of the fjord, creating a Richter magnitude scale 3 earthquake.|$|R
40|$|A {{next-generation}} in-water profiler {{designed to}} measure the apparent optical properties (AOPs) of seawater was developed and validated across a wide dynamic range of in-water properties. The new free-falling instrument, the Compact-Optical Profiling System (C-OPS), {{was based on a}} cluster of 19 state-of-the-art microradiometers spanning 320 – 780 nm and a new kite-shaped backplane design. The kite-shaped backplane includes tunable ballast, a hydrobaric <b>buoyancy</b> <b>chamber,</b> plus pitch and roll adjustments, to provide unprecedented stability and vertical resolution in near-surface waters. A unique data set was collected as part of the development activity and the first major field campaign that used the new instrument, the Malina expedition to the Beaufort Sea {{in the vicinity of the}} Mackenzie River outflow. The data were of sufficient resolution and quality to show that errors &ndash; more correctly, uncertainties &ndash; in the execution of data sampling protocols were measurable at the 1 % and 1 cm level with C-OPS. A sensitivity analysis as a function of three water types established by the peak in the remote sensing reflectance spectrum, Rrs(&lambda;), revealed which water types and which parts of the spectrum were the most sensitive to data acquisition uncertainties. Shallow riverine waters were the most sensitive water type, and the ultraviolet and near-infrared were the most sensitive parts of the spectrum. The sensitivity analysis also showed how the use of data products based on band ratios significantly mitigated the influence of data acquisition uncertainties. The unprecedented vertical resolution provided high quality data products at the spectral end members, which subsequently supported an alternative classification capability based on the spectral diffuse attenuation coefficient, Kd(λ). The Kd(320) and Kd(780) data showed how complex coastal systems can be distinguished two-dimensionally and how near-ice water masses are different from the open ocean. Finally, an algorithm for predicting the spectral absorption due to colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), denoted aCDOM(&lambda;), was developed using the Kd(320) /Kd(780) ratio, which was based on a linear relationship with respect to aCDOM(440), with over 99 % of the variance explained. The robustness of the approach was established by expanding the use of the algorithm to include a geographically different coastal environment, the Southern Mid-Atlantic Bight, with no significant change in accuracy (approximately 98 % of the variance explained). Alternative spectral end members reminiscent of next-generation (340 and 710 nm) as well as legacy satellite missions (412 and 670 nm) were also used to accurately derive aCDOM(440) from Kd(λ) ratios (94 % or more of the variance explained) ...|$|E
40|$|A {{floating}} {{wind turbine}} system with a tower structure that includes at least one stability arm extending therefrom and that is anchored to the sea floor with a rotatable position retention device that facilitates deep water installations. Variable buoyancy for the wind turbine system is provided by <b>buoyancy</b> <b>chambers</b> that are integral to the tower itself {{as well as the}} stability arm. Pumps are included for adjusting the buoyancy as an aid in system transport, installation, repair and removal. The wind turbine rotor is located downwind of the tower structure to allow the wind turbine to follow the wind direction without an active yaw drive system. The support tower and stability arm structure is designed to balance tension in the tether with buoyancy, gravity and wind forces {{in such a way that}} the top of the support tower leans downwind, providing a large clearance between the support tower and the rotor blade tips. This large clearance facilitates the use of articulated rotor hubs to reduced damaging structural dynamic loads. Major components of the turbine can be assembled at the shore and transported to an offshore installation site...|$|R
5000|$|The rigid buoyant boat (RBB) is a {{light-weight}} {{but high}} performance and high capacity boat. Based {{on the concept}} of a Rigid-hulled inflatable boat (RHIB), it has a tube/sponson manufactured from a solid material such as moulded polyethylene or aluminium and therefore being much more robust than the fabrics commonly used. Boats with foam filled collars such as the secure all-around flotation equipped (SAFE) boats employed by the US Coast Guard can also be classified as Rigid Buoyant Boats rather than [...] "true" [...] RHIBs as the collar is solid foam rather than inflated. The handling tends to be very similar to a RHIB; likewise they will remain afloat (buoyant) even if completely flooded. Aluminium RBBs tend to be bespoke (custom-made to specification) or low-volume products whilst the tooling cost of rotomolded polyethylene boats tends to require these to be higher volume products. At least three manufacturers are producing rotomolded boats of this type. One supplier has demonstrated the robustness of the boats by dropping one from a crane onto a concrete car park. The U.S. Navy’s small unit riverine craft and the Coast Guard’s Defender class 25 ft boats are examples of RBBs. Some boat builders make RBB's as workboat from HDPE sheets welded together. Similar deep V-hull can be made for good seakeeping. If <b>buoyancy</b> <b>chambers</b> are filled the hull becomes truly unsinkable and extremely indestructible making the RBB very suitable for rough conditions. The RBB serie of Tideman Boats is a good example.|$|R
40|$|The world's first extravehicular {{activity}} (EVA) {{was performed by}} A. A. Leonov on March 18, 1965 during the Russian Voskhod- 2 mission. The first US EVA was executed by Gemini IV astronaut Ed White on June 3, 1965, with an umbilical tether that included communications and an oxygen supply. A hand-held maneuvering unit (HHMU) also {{was used to test}} maneuverability during the brief EVA; however the somewhat stiff umbilical limited controlled movement. That constraint, plus difficulty returning through the vehicle hatch, highlighted the need for increased thermal control and improved EVA ergonomics. Clearly, requirements for a useful EVA were interrelated with the vehicle design. The early Gemini EVAs generated requirements for suits providing micro-meteor protection, adequate visual field and eye protection from solar visual and infrared radiation, gloves optimized for dexterity while pressurized, and thermal systems capable of protecting the astronaut while rejecting metabolic heat during high workloads. Subsequent Gemini EVAs built upon this early experience and included development of a portable environmental control and life support systems (ECLSS) and an astronaut maneuvering unit. The ECLSS provided a pressure vessel and controller with functional control over suit pressure, oxygen flow, carbon dioxide removal, humidity, and temperature control. Gemini EVA experience also identified the usefulness of underwater neutral <b>buoyancy</b> and altitude <b>chamber</b> task training, and the importance of developing reliable task timelines. Improved thermal management and carbon dioxide control also were required for high workload tasks. With the Apollo project, EVA activity was primarily on the lunar surface; and suit durability, integrated liquid cooling garments, and low suit operating pressures (3. 75 pounds per square inch absolute [psia] or 25. 8 kilopascal [kPa],) were required to facilitate longer EVAs with ambulation and significant physical workloads with average metabolic rates of 1000 BTU/hr and peaks of up to 2200 BTU/hr. Mobility was further augmented with the Lunar Roving Vehicle. The Apollo extravehicular mobility unit (EMU) was made up of over 15 components, ranging from a biomedical belt for capturing and transmitting biomedical data, urine and fecal containment systems, a liquid cooling garment, communications cap, a modular portable life support system (PLSS), a boot system, thermal overgloves, and a bubble helmet with eye protection. Apollo lunar astronauts performed successful EVAs on the lunar surface from a 5 psia (34. 4 kPa) 100 % oxygen environment in the Lunar Lander. A maximum of three EVAs were performed on any mission. For Skylab a modified A 7 LB suit, used for Apollo 15, was selected. The Skylab astronaut life support assembly (ALSA) provided umbilical support through the life support umbilical (LSU) and used open loop oxygen flow, rather than closed-loop as in Apollo missions. Thermal control was provided by liquid water circulated by spacecraft pumps and electrical power also was provided from the spacecraft via the umbilical. The cabin atmosphere of 5 psia (34. 4 kPa), 70 % oxygen, provided a normoxic atmosphere and because of the very low nitrogen partial pressures, no special protocols were required to protect against decompression sickness (DCS) {{as was the case with}} the Apollo spacecraft with a 5 psi, 100 % oxygen environment...|$|R
