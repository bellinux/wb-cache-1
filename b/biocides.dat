5|$|During {{trials of}} the first submarines, the {{propulsion}} system {{was found to be}} prone to failure for a variety of reasons. Most failures were attributed to the fifteen-tank diesel fuel system: the tanks were designed to fill with salt water as they were emptied to maintain neutral buoyancy, but water would regularly enter the engines due to a combination of poor design, gravity separation of the fuel and water being insufficient, and operator error resulting from poor training. Problems were also caused by bacterial contamination of the diesel fuel, which, along with the salt water, would cause the fuel pumps to rust and other components to seize. The fuel-related issues were solved by installing coalescers, improving training and operational procedures, and adding <b>biocides</b> to the fuel.|$|E
5|$|The {{biocidal}} {{effects of}} some heavy metals {{have been known}} since antiquity. Platinum, osmium, copper, ruthenium, and other heavy metals, including arsenic, are used in anti-cancer treatments, or have shown potential. Antimony (anti-protozoal), bismuth (anti-ulcer), gold (anti-arthritic), and iron (anti-malarial) are also important in medicine. Copper, zinc, silver, gold, or mercury are used in antiseptic formulations; small amounts of some heavy metals are used to control algal growth in, for example, cooling towers. Depending on their intended use as fertilisers or <b>biocides,</b> agrochemicals may contain heavy metals such as chromium, cobalt, nickel, copper, zinc, arsenic, cadmium, mercury, or lead.|$|E
25|$|<b>Biocides</b> are {{chemical}} substances that deter the microorganisms responsible for biofouling. The {{chemical substances}} {{are incorporated into}} an anti-fouling surface coating, typically through physical adsorption or through chemical modification of the surface. Biofouling occurs on surfaces after formation of a biofilm. The biofilm creates a surface onto which successively larger microorganisms can attach. In marine environments this buildup usually concludes with barnacle attachment. The <b>biocides</b> often target the microorganisms that create the initial biofilm, typically bacteria. Once dead, {{they are unable to}} spread and can detach. Other <b>biocides</b> are toxic to larger organisms in biofouling, such as the fungi and algae. The most commonly used biocide, and anti-fouling agent, is the tributyltin moiety (TBT). It is toxic to both microorganisms and larger aquatic organisms. <b>Biocides</b> are also added to pool water, drinking water, and liquid lines for cooling electronics to control biological growth.|$|E

25|$|Besides {{treating}} the circulating cooling water in large industrial cooling tower systems to minimize scaling and fouling, the water should be filtered to remove particulates, and also be dosed with <b>biocides</b> and algaecides to prevent growths that could {{interfere with the}} continuous flow of the water. Under certain conditions, a biofilm of micro-organisms such as bacteria, fungi and algae can grow very rapidly in the cooling water, and can reduce the heat transfer efficiency of the cooling tower. Biofilm can be reduced or prevented by using chlorine or other chemicals. A normal industrial practice is to use two <b>biocides,</b> such as oxidizing and non-oxidizing types to complement each other's strengths and weaknesses, and to ensure a broader spectrum of attack. In most cases, a continual low level oxidizing biocide is used, then alternating to a periodic shock dose of non-oxidizing <b>biocides.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} glutaraldehyde, a {{commercial}} <b>biocide</b> {{widely used in}} paper and pulp industry, {{on the performance of}} laboratory-scale rotating biological contactors (RBCs) as well as <b>biocide</b> efficacy was studied. Biofilms were established on the RBCs and then exposed to 0 - 180 ppm glutaraldehyde at a dilution rate of 1. 60 h- 1. The results showed that the biofilms became acclimated to glutaraldehyde and eventually could degrade it. Acclimation to the <b>biocide</b> took longer at the higher <b>biocide</b> concentrations. The degree of <b>biocide</b> degradation and chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal depended on acclimation period, the presence of other organic matters and the amount of mineral salts available. Glutaraldehyde at up to 80 ppm had no effect on treatment efficiency and populations of biofilms and planktonic phase of the system whereas glutaraldehyde at 180 ppm caused a progressive decline in all measured values. However, no glutaraldehyde concentration used in the study was sufficiently high to kill microorganisms in the RBC system. The presence of biofilm provided additional resistance to glutaraldehyde to bacteria because the <b>biocide</b> had to penetrate through biofilm to reach bacteria. The increased resistance of bacteria to glutaraldehyde due to acclimation should be considered in <b>biocide</b> applications...|$|R

25|$|<b>Biocides</b> {{need not}} be {{poisonous}} to humans, because they can target metabolic pathways absent in humans, leaving only incidental toxicity. For instance, the herbicide 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid is a mimic of a plant growth hormone, which causes uncontrollable growth leading {{to the death of}} the plant. Humans and animals, lacking this hormone and its receptor, are unaffected by this, and need to ingest relatively large doses before any toxicity appears. Human toxicity is, however, hard to avoid with pesticides targeting mammals, such as rodenticides.|$|E
25|$|Anti-fouling is {{the process}} of {{preventing}} accumulations from forming. In industrial processes, bio-dispersants can be used to control biofouling. In less controlled environments, organisms are killed or repelled with coatings using <b>biocides,</b> thermal treatments, or pulses of energy. Nontoxic mechanical strategies that prevent organisms from attaching include choosing a material or coating with a slippery surface, creation of an ultra-low fouling surface with the use of zwitterions, or creation of nanoscale surface topologies similar to the skin of sharks and dolphins which only offer poor anchor points.|$|E
40|$|Estimation of <b>biocide</b> {{lifetime}} {{in marine}} antifouling coatings {{is of great}} use to improve and develop technologies. An existing model simulating the diffusion of molecules in polymer networks below glass transition temperature was employed to estimate leaching. This model was modified to allow for swelling due to water uptake and to permit evaluation of copolymer binders as well as homopolymers. This enabled prediction of <b>biocide</b> diffusion coefficients in polymeric coatings of various binder types, including pMMA, a pMMA/butylacrylate binder containing rosin, and a trityl copolymer, using usnic acid as a ‘model’ <b>biocide.</b> For comparison with modelling results, coatings fomulated using each binder type were also submitted to static and dynamic seawater immersion. Fluorescence microscopy techniques were used to quantify <b>biocide</b> leaching from these coatings relative to unimmersed coatings. Agreement of the modified diffusion model with experimental data was good for pMMA, reasonable for the rosin-based binder, and poor for the trityl binder. Comparison of predicted and experimental <b>biocide</b> profiles in the binder demonstrated deviation from the expected Fickian mechanism for the pMMA binder, despite the accurate rate prediction.

25|$|This problem however was {{resolved}} {{with the use}} of so-called self-polishing paints, in which the biocide was released at a slower rate as the seawater reacted with the surface layer of the paint. More recently, copper-based anti-fouling paints have been used because they are less toxic than TBT in aquatic environment, but are only effective against marine animal life, and not so much weed growth. Non-stick coatings contain no biocide, but have extremely slippery surfaces which prevents most fouling and makes it easier to clean the little fouling that does occur. Natural <b>biocides</b> are found on marine organisms such as coral and sponges and also prevent fouling if applied to a vessel. Creating a difference in electrical charge between the hull and sea water is a common practice in the prevention of fouling. This technology has proven to be effective, but is easily damaged and can be expensive. Finally, microscopic prickles can be added to a coating, and depending on length and distribution have shown the ability to prevent the attachment of most biofouling.|$|E
