5|$|<b>Benzoyl</b> <b>peroxide</b> (BPO) is a {{first-line}} {{treatment for}} mild and moderate acne {{due to its}} effectiveness and mild side-effects (mainly skin irritation). In the skin follicle, <b>benzoyl</b> <b>peroxide</b> kills P. acnes by oxidizing its proteins through the formation of oxygen free radicals and benzoic acid. These free radicals are thought {{to interfere with the}} bacterium's metabolism and ability to make proteins. Additionally, <b>benzoyl</b> <b>peroxide</b> is mildly effective at breaking down comedones and inhibiting inflammation. <b>Benzoyl</b> <b>peroxide</b> may be paired with a topical antibiotic or retinoid such as benzoyl peroxide/clindamycin and benzoyl peroxide/adapalene, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Combination therapy—using {{medications}} {{of different}} classes together, {{each with a}} different mechanism of action—has been demonstrated {{to be a more}} efficacious approach to acne treatment than monotherapy. The use of topical <b>benzoyl</b> <b>peroxide</b> and antibiotics together {{has been shown to be}} more effective than antibiotics alone. Similarly, using a topical retinoid with an antibiotic clears acne lesions faster than the use of antibiotics alone. Frequently used combinations include the following: antibiotic and <b>benzoyl</b> <b>peroxide,</b> antibiotic and topical retinoid, or topical retinoid and <b>benzoyl</b> <b>peroxide.</b> The pairing of <b>benzoyl</b> <b>peroxide</b> with a retinoid is preferred over the combination of a topical antibiotic with a retinoid since both regimens are effective but <b>benzoyl</b> <b>peroxide</b> does not lead to antibiotic resistance.|$|E
5|$|In 2011 Consumer Reports {{compared}} Proactiv (2.5 percent <b>benzoyl</b> <b>peroxide)</b> {{with two}} less expensive products, AcneFree (2.5 percent <b>benzoyl</b> <b>peroxide)</b> and OXY Maximum (10 percent <b>benzoyl</b> <b>peroxide).</b> At {{the time a}} two-month supply of Proactiv cost around $40 in the US, AcneFree $20 and OXY Maximum $5. Eighty-three subjects, aged 14 to 40, used one of the products twice a day for eight weeks. The magazine reported that, no matter which product was used, after two weeks around 75 percent of subjects saw a 35 percent reduction in blemishes on average. After eight weeks around 50–66 percent saw a 40 percent reduction on average.|$|E
5|$|Side effects include {{increased}} skin photosensitivity, dryness, redness {{and occasional}} peeling. Sunscreen use is often advised during treatment, to prevent sunburn. Lower concentrations of <b>benzoyl</b> <b>peroxide</b> {{are just as}} effective as higher concentrations in treating acne but are associated with fewer side effects. Unlike antibiotics, <b>benzoyl</b> <b>peroxide</b> {{does not appear to}} generate bacterial antibiotic resistance.|$|E
5|$|The toner {{contains}} glycolic acid, an exfoliant, and witch hazel, an astringent. The {{active ingredient}} in the cleanser and lotion, outside Europe, is a 2.5 percent concentration of <b>benzoyl</b> <b>peroxide,</b> lower than in most prescription-strength acne treatments. <b>Benzoyl</b> <b>peroxide</b> has been used since 1934 to kill Propionibacterium acnes, the bacterium that causes acne. Several over-the-counter acne treatments contain it, including Clean & Clear, Clearasil, Doctor's Dermatologic Formula, Neutrogena Advanced Systems, PanOxyl and Stridex.|$|E
5|$|Many {{different}} treatments {{exist for}} acne. These include alpha hydroxy acid, anti-androgen medications, antibiotics, antiseborrheic medications, azelaic acid, <b>benzoyl</b> <b>peroxide,</b> hormonal treatments, keratolytic soaps, nicotinamide, retinoids, and salicylic acid. They {{are believed to}} work in at least four different ways, including the following: reducing inflammation, hormonal manipulation, killing P. acnes, and normalizing skin cell shedding and sebum production in the pore to prevent blockage. Common treatments include topical therapies such as antibiotics, <b>benzoyl</b> <b>peroxide,</b> and retinoids, and systemic therapies including antibiotics, hormonal agents, and oral retinoids.|$|E
5|$|Proactiv {{is aimed}} at {{customers}} with mild to moderate acne. According to a 2011 review, {{there have been few}} studies examining its efficacy. A 2007 study saw inflammatory lesions reduced by 39 percent in subjects using a combination of butenafine and <b>benzoyl</b> <b>peroxide,</b> compared with 34 percent in those using Proactiv containing only <b>benzoyl</b> <b>peroxide.</b> A physician suggested in Salon that its three-step system might make it easier for teenagers to comply, but that the key to its success lay with its celebrity endorsements.|$|E
5|$|The use of {{clindamycin}} {{in conjunction}} with <b>benzoyl</b> <b>peroxide</b> is more effective {{in the treatment of}} acne than the use of either product by itself.|$|E
5|$|Clindamycin is {{marketed as}} generic and under trade names {{including}} Cleocin HCl, Dalacin, Lincocin (Bangladesh), Dalacin, and Clindacin. Combination products include Duac, BenzaClin, Clindoxyl and Acanya (in combination with <b>benzoyl</b> <b>peroxide),</b> and Ziana (with tretinoin).|$|E
5|$|Oral {{antibiotics}} {{are recommended}} for {{no longer than}} three months as antibiotic courses exceeding this duration {{are associated with the}} development of antibiotic resistance and show no clear benefit over shorter courses. Furthermore, if long-term oral antibiotics beyond three months are thought to be necessary, it is recommended that <b>benzoyl</b> <b>peroxide</b> and/or a retinoid be used {{at the same time to}} limit the risk of P. acnes developing antibiotic resistance. Dapsone is not a first-line topical antibiotic due to higher cost and lack of clear superiority over other antibiotics. Topical dapsone is not recommended for use with <b>benzoyl</b> <b>peroxide</b> due to yellow-orange skin discoloration with this combination.|$|E
5|$|According to a 2011 review, {{there have}} been few studies on the {{efficacy}} of Proactiv. A 2011 Consumer Reports study compared Proactiv with two less expensive types of <b>benzoyl</b> <b>peroxide,</b> AcneFree and OXY Maximum, and found all three to be equally effective. The US Food and Drug Administration warned in 2014 that over-the-counter acne treatments can cause severe irritation, as well as rare but life-threatening allergic reactions.|$|E
5|$|Guthy-Renker {{introduced}} Proactiv+ in 2013, charging $30 in the United States for a month's supply if {{the customer}} creates a subscription. It is a paraben-free three-step kit comprising a cleanser and toning gel, each with 2.5 percent <b>benzoyl</b> <b>peroxide,</b> and a moisturizer with salicylic acid. It is reportedly more hydrating {{than the original}} program.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} {{treatments}} available for acne from reducing sugars in the diet, to medications that include antibiotics, <b>benzoyl</b> <b>peroxide,</b> retinoids and hormonal treatments. Retinoids {{reduce the amount}} of sebum produced by the sebaceous glands. Should the usual treatments fail, the presence of the Demodex mite could be looked for as the possible cause.|$|E
5|$|There {{is also a}} three-step {{program in}} Extra Strength, with a 7 percent {{concentration}} of <b>benzoyl</b> <b>peroxide,</b> and a Gentle Formula that instead contains a 2 percent concentration of salicylic acid, an exfoliant. The three-step kit in Europe is based on salicylic acid; in the UK it costs £39.99 ($60) for a two-month supply. Other Proactiv products include an oil-free moisturizer that uses octinoxate (7.5 percent) and zinc oxide (3 percent), and an anti-dandruff shampoo with a one percent concentration of zinc pyrithione.|$|E
5|$|Recommended therapies for {{first-line}} use in acne vulgaris treatment include topical retinoids, <b>benzoyl</b> <b>peroxide,</b> and topical or oral antibiotics. Procedures such {{as light}} therapy and laser therapy {{are not considered}} to be first-line treatments and typically have an adjunctive role due to their high cost and limited evidence of efficacy. Medications for acne work by targeting the early stages of comedo formation and are generally ineffective for visible skin lesions; improvement in the appearance of acne is typically expected between six and eight weeks after starting therapy.|$|E
5|$|The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) {{warned in}} 2014 that {{over-the-counter}} acne products containing <b>benzoyl</b> <b>peroxide</b> and/or salicylic acid, including Proactiv, can cause severe irritation, {{as well as}} rare but life-threatening allergic reactions. Consumers were advised to stop using the products if they experience hives or itching, and to seek emergency medical attention if they feel faint, or experience throat tightness, breathing problems, or swelling of the eyes, face, lips or tongue. The FDA noted that it remains unclear whether the reactions are caused by the active ingredients, inactive ingredients or a combination.|$|E
5|$|Complementary therapies {{have been}} {{investigated}} for treating people with acne. Low-quality evidence suggests topical application of tea tree oil or bee venom may reduce {{the total number of}} skin lesions in those with acne. Tea tree oil is thought to be approximately as effective as <b>benzoyl</b> <b>peroxide</b> or salicylic acid, but has been associated with allergic contact dermatitis. Proposed mechanisms for tea tree oil's anti-acne effects include antibacterial action against P. acnes, and anti-inflammatory properties. Numerous other plant-derived therapies have been observed to have positive effects against acne (e.g., basil oil and oligosaccharides from seaweed); however, few studies have been performed, and most have been of lower methodological quality. There is a lack of high-quality evidence for the use of acupuncture, herbal medicine, or cupping therapy for acne.|$|E
5|$|Many {{treatment}} options for acne are available, including lifestyle changes, medications, and medical procedures. Eating fewer simple carbohydrates such as sugar may help. Treatments applied {{directly to the}} affected skin, such as azelaic acid, <b>benzoyl</b> <b>peroxide,</b> and salicylic acid, are commonly used. Antibiotics and retinoids are available in formulations that are applied to the skin and taken by mouth {{for the treatment of}} acne. However, resistance to antibiotics may develop as a result of antibiotic therapy. Several types of birth control pills help against acne in women. Isotretinoin pills are usually reserved for severe acne due to greater potential side effects. Early and aggressive treatment of acne is advocated by some in the medical community to decrease the overall long-term impact to individuals.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the late}} stages of {{pregnancy}} {{are associated with}} an increase in sebaceous gland activity in the skin, pregnancy has not been reliably associated with worsened acne severity. In general, topically applied medications are considered the first-line approach to acne treatment during pregnancy, as they have little systemic absorption and are therefore unlikely to harm a developing fetus. Highly recommended therapies include topically applied <b>benzoyl</b> <b>peroxide</b> (category C) and azelaic acid (category B). Salicylic acid carries a category C safety rating due to higher systemic absorption (9–25%), and an association between the use of anti-inflammatory medications in the third trimester and adverse effects to the developing fetus including too little amniotic fluid in the uterus and early closure of the babies' ductus arteriosus blood vessel. Prolonged use of salicylic acid over significant areas of the skin or under occlusive dressings is not recommended as these methods increase systemic absorption and the potential for fetal harm. Tretinoin (category C) and adapalene (category C) are very poorly absorbed, but certain studies have suggested teratogenic effects in the first trimester. Due to persistent safety concerns, topical retinoids are not recommended for use during pregnancy. In studies examining the effects of topical retinoids during pregnancy, fetal harm has not been seen {{in the second and third}} trimesters. Retinoids contraindicated for use during pregnancy include the topical retinoid tazarotene, and oral retinoids isotretinoin and acitretin (all category X). Spironolactone is relatively contraindicated for use during pregnancy due to its antiandrogen effects. Finasteride is not recommended as it is highly teratogenic.|$|E
25|$|Hydrogen {{peroxide}} {{may be used}} {{to treat}} acne, although <b>benzoyl</b> <b>peroxide</b> is a more common treatment.|$|E
25|$|Medications and topical {{irritants}} {{have also}} been known to trigger rosacea flares. Some acne and wrinkle treatments reported to cause rosacea include microdermabrasion and chemical peels, as well as high dosages of isotretinoin, <b>benzoyl</b> <b>peroxide,</b> and tretinoin.|$|E
25|$|Standard {{conditions}} for using NBS in allylic and/or benzylic bromination involves refluxing {{a solution of}} NBS in anhydrous CCl4 with a radical initiator—usually azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) or <b>benzoyl</b> <b>peroxide,</b> irradiation, or both to effect radical initiation. The allylic and benzylic radical intermediates formed during this reaction are more stable than other carbon radicals and the major products are allylic and benzylic bromides. This is also called the Wohl–Ziegler reaction.|$|E
500|$|<b>Benzoyl</b> <b>peroxide</b> {{can have}} a drying effect on the skin, can cause {{erythema}} (redness) and fine scaling, though these effects are usually mild, and can increase sensitivity to sunlight. One in 500 may experience allergic contact dermatitis. It is categorized as a pregnancy category C agent, [...] "suggesting that its use in pregnancy may not be prudent," [...] according to a literature review in the Journal of Clinical and Aesthetic Dermatology. If <b>benzoyl</b> <b>peroxide</b> comes into contact with clothing {{it is likely to}} bleach it.|$|E
500|$|The {{approach}} to acne treatment underwent significant changes during the twentieth century. Retinoids were introduced {{as a medical}} treatment for acne in 1943. <b>Benzoyl</b> <b>peroxide</b> was first proposed as a treatment in 1958 and has been routinely {{used for this purpose}} since the 1960s. Acne treatment was modified in the 1950s with the introduction of oral tetracycline antibiotics (such as minocycline). These reinforced the idea amongst dermatologists that bacterial growth on the skin {{plays an important role in}} causing acne. Subsequently, in the 1970s tretinoin (original trade name Retin A) was found to be an effective treatment. The [...] development of oral isotretinoin (sold as Accutane and Roaccutane) followed in 1980. After its introduction in the United States it was recognized as a medication highly likely to cause birth defects if taken during pregnancy. In the United States, more than 2,000women became pregnant while taking isotretinoin between 1982 and 2003, with most pregnancies ending in abortion or miscarriage. About 160babies were born with birth defects.|$|E

50|$|In 1966, Stiefel {{introduced}} the first <b>benzoyl</b> <b>peroxide</b> product for acne—Sulfoxyl Lotion (5% <b>benzoyl</b> <b>peroxide,</b> 2% sulfur). The treatment {{was introduced to}} Canadian dermatologists as BenOxyl Lotion.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Benzoyl</b> <b>peroxide</b> {{is used as}} a {{bleaching}} agent in white and whole wheat flour within specific quantities. No major health concerns have been found with <b>benzoyl</b> <b>peroxide</b> use in regulated quantities.|$|E
50|$|<b>Benzoyl</b> <b>peroxide,</b> {{much like}} azobisisobutyronitrile, {{is a white}} powder used as a photoinitiator in various {{commercial}} and industrial processes, including plastics production. Unlike AIBN, however, <b>benzoyl</b> <b>peroxide</b> produces oxygen gas upon decomposing, giving this compound a host of medical uses as well.|$|E
50|$|<b>Benzoyl</b> <b>peroxide</b> for acne {{treatment}} is typically {{applied to the}} affected areas in gel, cream, or liquid, in concentrations of 2.5% increasing through 5.0%, and up to 10%. No strong evidence supports the idea that higher concentrations of <b>benzoyl</b> <b>peroxide</b> are more effective than lower concentrations.|$|E
50|$|In 1991, Stiefel Laboratories founded Glades Pharmaceuticals {{to market}} generic {{dermatology}} products. Glades Pharmaceuticals later matured to market a full line of products including branded-generic and branded products. Brevoxyl/Solugel Creamy Wash is launched {{as the first}} <b>benzoyl</b> <b>peroxide</b> product containing dimethyl isosorbide to dissolve the <b>benzoyl</b> <b>peroxide</b> crystals and reduce irritation.|$|E
50|$|<b>Benzoyl</b> <b>peroxide</b> (BPO) is an {{alternative}} organic peroxide {{that may be used}} to polymerize ADC. Pure <b>benzoyl</b> <b>peroxide</b> is crystalline and less volatile than diisopropyl peroxydicarbonate. Using BPO results in a polymer that has a higher yellowness index, and the peroxide takes longer to dissolve into ADC at room temperature than IPP.|$|E
50|$|Concentrated <b>benzoyl</b> <b>peroxide</b> is {{potentially}} explosive like other organic peroxides, {{and can cause}} fires without external ignition. The hazard is acute for the pure material, so the compound is generally used as a solution or a paste. For example, cosmetics contain only a small percent of <b>benzoyl</b> <b>peroxide</b> and pose no explosion risk.|$|E
