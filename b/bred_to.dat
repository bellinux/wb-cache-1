She also bought a five-year-old mare in foal, Hay Harvest, for 5,500 guineas. When <b>bred</b> <b>to</b> Sayajirao, Carpatica produced the 1950s winner, Cavina.|$|E
5|$|Cocker Spaniels were {{originally}} bred as hunting {{dogs in the}} United Kingdom, with the term cocker deriving from their use to hunt the Eurasian woodcock. When the breed {{was brought to the}} United States, it was <b>bred</b> <b>to</b> a different standard, which enabled it to specialize in hunting the American woodcock. Further physical changes were bred into the cocker in the United States during {{the early part of the}} 20th century.|$|E

Some of these mares were <b>bred</b> <b>to</b> the Thoroughbred racing stallion Lexington, also owned by the HT Ranch.|$|E
5|$|In Roman times, {{parsnips}} {{were believed}} to be an aphrodisiac. However, parsnips do not typically feature in modern Italian cooking. Instead, they are fed to pigs, particularly those <b>bred</b> <b>to</b> make Parma ham. In traditional Chinese medicine, the root of Chinese parsnip is used as an herbal medicine ingredient.|$|E
5|$|In ancient times, Pugs were <b>bred</b> <b>to</b> be companions for ruling {{families}} in China.

In Tibet, Buddhist monks kept Pugs as pets in their monasteries. The breed has retained its affectionate devotion to its owners since ancient times.|$|E
50|$|During {{the reign}} of Darius, Nisean horses were <b>bred</b> from Armenia <b>to</b> Sogdiana. The Nisean horse was so sought after, that the Greeks (mainly, the Spartans) {{imported}} Nisean horses and <b>bred</b> them <b>to</b> their native stock, and many nomadic tribes, (such as the Scythians) {{in and around the}} Persian Empire also imported, captured, or stole Nisean horses.|$|R

5|$|Markings have {{a strict}} standard, with {{detailed}} terminology, for showing in fancy rat pet shows. However, many domestic rats are not closely <b>bred</b> <b>to</b> any color standard; {{many of those}} found in pet shops will have mismarkings from a formal breeding perspective, which are defined as variations in markings that are not recognized as conforming to a breed standard published by a rat fancier organisation.|$|E
5|$|The Boulonnais {{provided}} part of {{the base}} for the Anglo-Norman breed, which was later to play {{a large role in}} the creation of the Selle Francais. It was also used in the creation and refinement of the Italian Heavy Draft, the post-World War II improvement of the Schleswig horse, and the creation of the early 19th-century Ardennes. Some equine scholars theorize that if the smaller Mareyeur had survived, it would have been an ideal horse to cross with the Thoroughbred or Anglo-Arabian to produce a warmblood for competition. In France, a breeding program has been developed by the National Stud to cross Boulonnais and Arabian horses to create a fast, alert driving horse, called the Araboulonnais. This breeding program also brings new blood into the Boulonnais line as, if an Araboulonnais mare is <b>bred</b> <b>to</b> a Boulonnais stallion, and a resulting filly is <b>bred</b> <b>to</b> another Boulonnais stallion, the third generation horse may be inducted into the purebred Boulonnais studbook if it passes an inspection.|$|E
5|$|The Heck {{brothers}} bred together several European small {{horse and}} pony breeds hypothesized to be {{descended from the}} tarpan. They eventually integrated mares of the Konik, Icelandic horse, and Gotland breeds. These mares were <b>bred</b> <b>to</b> stallions of a wild horse type known as Przewalski's horse. The Hecks believed the wild Przewalski blood would help to draw out the wild characteristics they felt lay dormant in the domesticated pony breed mares. The initial crosses were made between Gotland and Icelandic mares (who visually closely resembled the tarpan, especially {{in the shape of}} the head) and Przewalski's horse stallions (who provided the desired dun coloration and upright mane), and the offspring were then <b>bred</b> <b>to</b> each other. The first foal born from the program who had the desired coloration was a colt born on May 22, 1933 at the Tierpark Hellabrunn. The breeding program continued, using only those horses who showed the desired skull shape, bone structure and coloration. Relatively quickly, the breed's conformation and coloration became set, with parents reliably passing their characteristics onto their offspring.|$|E

5|$|All {{registered}} Colorado Ranger Horses trace {{directly to}} one of two foundation sires in their pedigree. The first is Patches #1 and the second is Max #2, a son of another horse named Max born in 1918. Registered Colorado Rangerbreds may be <b>bred</b> <b>to</b> registered Thoroughbreds, American Quarter Horses, Appaloosas, Arabians and AraAppaloosas, and the resulting progeny registered as purebred Colorado Rangerbreds. Horses with draft horse or pony blood may not be registered. Colorado Ranger Horses may be double-registered with the Appaloosa Horse Club, but Appaloosas may not be registered with the CRHA unless they have the proper bloodlines. Approximately 90 percent of Colorado Ranger horses are dual-registered.|$|E
5|$|As {{with dogs}} from other working breeds, the Australian Cattle Dog is {{energetic}} and intelligent with an independent streak. It responds well to structured training, {{particularly if it}} is interesting and challenging. It was originally <b>bred</b> <b>to</b> herd by biting, and is known to nip running children. It forms a strong attachment to its owners, and can be protective of them and their possessions. It is easy to groom and maintain, requiring little more than brushing during the shedding period. The most common health problems are deafness and progressive blindness (both hereditary conditions) and accidental injury; otherwise, it is a robust breed with a lifespan of 12 to 14 years.|$|E

5|$|Dog racing was {{originally}} {{an extension of}} hare coursing. Whippets began to be <b>bred</b> <b>to</b> race in the mid-nineteenth century. The first form of the sport was a rudimentary form of coursing known as 'ragging', and dogs who participated {{were said to be}} 'trained to the rag'. Dogs were kept on a leash by a person known as a slip, who was frequently also the race judge. The slip would release the dogs from their collars at the same time, and they would race towards their owners, who were standing {{at the opposite end of}} the track waving towels.|$|E
5|$|In 1959, Varian and {{her mother}} Wenonah {{purchased}} a two-year-old bay stallion named Bay-Abi (Errabi × Angyl). Trained and shown by Varian, he was the judges' unanimous choice for U.S. National Champion Arabian Stallion in 1962, later won U.S. National Top Ten awards in both Arabian English pleasure and Western pleasure, and thereafter was awarded the Legion of Merit. Even though he was not <b>bred</b> <b>to</b> any mares until after he was fully trained, and thus his first foals did {{not appear in the}} show ring until he was 7, he sired 275registered Arabians, including 65 champions and 24 national winners.|$|E
5|$|In the past, the Newfoundland pony {{was used}} for ploughing, {{assisting}} with gardens, hauling kelp from the beaches, gathering hay, and carrying wood, and they were also used for transportation. They were successfully used and <b>bred</b> <b>to</b> withstand the hard climate, and by 1935 there were over 9,000 ponies on the island. During the mid-20th century, however, increasing mechanization and a ban on free-roaming ponies contributed {{to a decline in}} the population, and increased exports to France for horse meat in the 1970s almost led to the extinction of the breed.|$|E

5|$|Initial {{grouping}} {{of several of}} the highland terriers (including the Scottie) under the generic name Skye Terriers caused some confusion in the breed’s lineage. There is disagreement over whether the Skye Terriers mentioned in early 16th century records actually descended from forerunners of the Scottie or vice versa. It is certain, however, that Scotties and West Highland White Terriers are closely related—both their forefathers originated from the Blackmount region of Perthshire and the Moor of Rannoch. Scotties were originally <b>bred</b> <b>to</b> hunt and kill vermin on farms and to hunt badgers and foxes in the Highlands of Scotland.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the Scottish Terrier can make a good watchdog due to its tendency to bark only when necessary and because it is typically reserved with strangers, although this is not always the case. They have been described as a fearless breed that may be aggressive around other dogs unless introduced at an early age. Scottish Terriers were originally <b>bred</b> <b>to</b> hunt and fight badgers. Therefore, the Scottie is prone to dig as well as chase small vermin, such as squirrels, rats, and mice.|$|E
5|$|Nearly all Finnish horses foaled since 1971 {{have been}} registered. During {{the first decade}} of the 21st century, the breed's numbers in Finland stabilised at roughly 20,000 animals, and {{approximately}} 1,000 foals are born annually. The breed makes up roughly one third of Finland's total horse population. The objective for ensuring the breed's continuity is to have at least 200 stallions and 2,000 mares used for breeding every year, 3,000 horses used for harness racing, and 6,000 horses for riding and other uses. In the 21st century, most Finnhorses are <b>bred</b> <b>to</b> be trotters, but the breed is also popular at riding schools and for recreational riding.|$|E
