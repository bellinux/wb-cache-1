5|$|Forster's {{attitude}} <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> <b>into</b> {{conflict with}} the people of the different nations he encountered and made him welcome nowhere, as he was too revolutionary and antinational for Germans, proud and opposing in his dealings with Englishmen, too unconcerned about Polish science for Poles, and too insignificant politically and ignored while in France.|$|E
5|$|After Baldwin sanctioned the marriage, Constance and Raynald {{married in}} early 1153. Raynald {{took charge of}} the {{administration}} of the principality. However, he was unpopular because his subjects regarded him as an upstart. His frequent attempts to raise funds <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> <b>into</b> conflict with Patriarch Aimery and Emperor ManuelI during the subsequent years. The emperor forced Raynald to pay homage to him in the spring of 1159. Raynald was captured and imprisoned by Majd al-Din, governor of Aleppo, during a plundering raid in November 1160 or 1161.|$|E

His many activities <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> <b>into</b> the highest social and professional circles. Like other turn of the century hunters such as Teddy Roosevelt, he was an active campaigner for animal welfare and succeeded in seeing legal measures introduced for their protection.|$|E
60|$|Doctor Manette {{received}} {{such patients}} here as his old reputation, and its revival in the floating whispers of his story, <b>brought</b> <b>him.</b> His scientific knowledge, and his vigilance and skill in conducting ingenious experiments, <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> otherwise <b>into</b> moderate request, and he earned {{as much as}} he wanted.|$|R
50|$|After Napoleon's abdication in 1814 he {{submitted}} to the new French government, but {{was placed on the}} retired list in September. Flahaut was assiduous in his attendance on Queen Hortense until the Hundred Days <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> back <b>into</b> active service.|$|R

He was a successful tax lawyer, and his real estate investments {{made him one of}} the nation's wealthiest men. His work <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> <b>into</b> contact with National Football League team owners, and his failed purchase of the Los Angeles Rams placed him in line to become the owner of the fledgling Buccaneer franchise. He owned the team from its inception until his death.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to Olga, her eldest son, King Constantine I of Greece, {{was determined to}} follow a policy of neutrality. His maternal relations were Russian, and his wife was the sister of Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany. His policy <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> <b>into</b> conflict with Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos, who favored the Allies. Constantine was soon {{accused of being a}} Germanophile and the Athenian government was regarded with suspicion in London and Paris. In {{what became known as the}} National Schism, Venizelos established a parallel government in Thessaloniki in opposition to Constantine.|$|E
5|$|In early 1919, Churchill was {{appointed}} Secretary of State for War and Secretary of State for Air. While Churchill was preoccupied with implementing post-War defence cuts and the demobilization of the Army, the Chief of the Air Staff, Major-General Frederick Sykes, submitted a paper with what {{were at the}} time unrealistic proposals for a large air force of the future. Being dissatisfied with Sykes, Churchill began to consider reinstating Trenchard whose recent performance at Southampton had once more <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> <b>into</b> favour with Churchill.|$|E

60|$|By dint {{of charity}} from the town's-people in {{aid of the}} load of {{provisions}} he had <b>brought</b> with <b>him</b> <b>into</b> durance, Edie Ochiltree had passed a day or two's confinement without much impatience, regretting his want of freedom the less, as the weather proved broken and rainy.|$|R
5|$|Pope Innocent, who had proclaimed a new crusade in 1213, {{wanted to}} persuade Leo {{to assist the}} crusaders. In that year, Leo renounced all lands that he had seized from the Templars, but {{retained}} Bagras. John of Brienne married Leo's daughter, Stephanie, in 1214. During the same period, Bohemond's position weakened. His attempt to take vengeance on the Assassins {{for the murder of}} his eldest son, Raymond, <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> <b>into</b> conflict with his old ally, Az-Zahir Ghazi of Aleppo.|$|E
5|$|Rajab {{started his}} human rights {{activity}} during the 1990s uprising {{before going on}} {{to become involved in}} campaigning on behalf of migrant workers in GCC countries.He is known for his pioneering use of social networking as an important element in human rights campaigning which has <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> <b>into</b> conflict with the authorities. Front Line Defenders, Human Rights Watch (HRW) and Reporters Without Borders have described him as being targeted by Bahraini authorities for his human rights activities.|$|E
5|$|The Hungarian lords dethroned Peter in 1041 {{and elected}} Samuel king. According to the {{unanimous}} narration of the Hungarian chronicles, Samuel preferred commoners to noblemen, causing discontent among his former partisans. His execution of many opponents <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> <b>into</b> conflict with Bishop Gerard of Csanád. In 1044, Peter the Venetian {{returned with the}} assistance of the German monarch, Henry III, who defeated Samuel's larger army at the battle of Ménfő near Győr. Samuel fled from the battlefield but was captured and killed.|$|E

6000|$|... "Good-morrow, fair maiden," [...] said Septimius, {{with such}} {{courtesy}} {{as he knew}} how to use (which, to say truth, was of a rustic order, his way of life having <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> little <b>into</b> female society). [...] "There is a nice air here on the hill-top, this sultry morning below the hill!" ...|$|R
25|$|Although Harry M. {{was not in}} {{any serious}} danger of being fired, as Lewis <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> back <b>into</b> the {{boardroom}} for solely personal reasons (for which Lewis was chided for during the final boardroom), Lord Sugar warned Harry M. if he couldn't get {{along with the other}} candidates, he too would be fired.|$|R
5|$|A {{group in}} Cambridge, which {{met at the}} White Horse tavern from the mid-1520s and became known as Little Germany, soon became influential. Its members {{included}} Robert Barnes, Hugh Latimer, John Frith and Thomas Bilney—all eventually burned as heretics. Cranmer's change of mind, borne partly by his membership of the team negotiating for the annulment, finally came through his stay with Andreas Osiander in Nuremberg in 1532. (Cranmer also secretly married Osiander's niece). Even then the position was {{complicated by the fact}} that Lutherans were not in favour of the annulment. Cranmer (and Henry) felt obliged to seek assistance from Strasbourg and Basel, which <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> <b>into</b> contact with the more radical ideas associated with Zwingli.|$|E
5|$|Brown is {{credited}} {{with a number of}} American football innovations. He was the first coach to use game film to scout opponents, hire a full-time staff of assistants, and test players on their knowledge of a playbook. He invented the modern face mask, the taxi squad and the draw play. He also played a role in breaking professional football's color barrier, bringing some of the first African-Americans to play pro football in the modern era onto his teams. Despite these accomplishments, Brown was not universally liked. He was strict and controlling, which often <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> <b>into</b> conflict with players who wanted a greater say in play-calling. These disputes, combined with Brown's failure to consult Modell on major personnel decisions, led to his firing as the Browns' coach in 1963.|$|E
5|$|Echmarcach {{appears to}} have forged an {{alliance}} with the powerful Uí Briain. A leading member of this kindred, Donnchad mac Briain, King of Munster, was married to Cacht ingen Ragnaill, {{a woman who could}} have been closely related to Echmarcach. Certainly, Echmarcach's daughter, Mór, married one of Donnchad's Uí Briain close kinsmen. Echmarcach's violent career <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> <b>into</b> bitter conflict with a particular branch of the Uí Ímair who had held Dublin periodically from the early eleventh century. This branch was supported by the rising Uí Cheinnselaig, an Irish kindred responsible for Echmarcach's final expulsion from Dublin and apparently Mann as well.|$|E

5|$|Hayes {{took office}} {{determined}} {{to reform the}} system of civil service appointments, which had been based on the spoils system since Andrew Jackson was president. Instead of giving federal jobs to political supporters, Hayes wished to award them by merit according to an examination that all applicants would take. Immediately, Hayes's call for reform <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> <b>into</b> conflict with the Stalwart, or pro-spoils, branch of the Republican party. Senators of both parties were accustomed to being consulted about political appointments and turned against Hayes. Foremost among his enemies was New York Senator Roscoe Conkling, who fought Hayes's reform efforts at every turn.|$|E
5|$|He was {{admitted}} into the Colegio Nacional de La Plata in 1936. After {{graduating from high}} school, he {{was admitted}} to the School of Medicine at the National University of La Plata. During his third year, he began his medical residency at the Hospital Policlínico San Martín, a medical center that received the most complicated cases from much of Buenos Aires province. This residency <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> <b>into</b> contact with patients for the first time. He attended procedures carried out by professors José María Mainetti and Federico E. B. Christmann, from whom he learned the simplicity and standardization that he would later apply to cardiovascular surgery, one of his many great contributions to cardiovascular operating techniques. Favaloro graduated with a medical degree in 1949.|$|E
5|$|In 1561, Swedish forces {{arrived and}} the noble {{corporations}} of Harrien–Wierland and Jerwen (Järva) yielded to Sweden {{to form the}} Duchy of Estonia. Reval, similarly, accepted Swedish rule. Denmark dominated the Baltic, and Sweden wished to challenge this by gaining territory on the Eastern side of the Baltic. Doing so would help Sweden control the West's trade with Russia. This helped to precipitate the Northern Seven Years' War since in 1561, Frederick II had already protested against Swedish presence in Reval, claiming historical rights relating to Danish Estonia. When Erik XIV's forces seized Pernau in June 1562, his diplomats tried to arrange Swedish protection for Riga, which <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> <b>into</b> conflict with Sigismund.|$|E
50|$|Isner {{reached the}} semifinals at the Master's 1000 in Paris, where he held three match points before losing to Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the semifinals.

50|$|With the {{outbreak}} of World War I Ribot's great reputation as an expert in finance and foreign affairs <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> effectively <b>into</b> office.

5|$|In 1921 Fleming {{enrolled}} at Eton College. Although not a high achiever academically, he excelled at athletics {{and held the}} title of Victor Ludorum ("Winner of the Games") for two years between 1925 and 1927. He also edited a school magazine, The Wyvern. His lifestyle at Eton <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> <b>into</b> conflict with his housemaster, E. V. Slater, who disapproved of Fleming's attitude, his hair oil, his ownership of a car and his relations with women. Slater persuaded Fleming's mother to remove him from Eton a term early for a crammer course to gain entry to the Royal Military College at Sandhurst. He spent {{less than a year}} there, leaving in 1927 without gaining a commission, after contracting gonorrhea.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to this emerging threat, Brock moved quickly to bolster Canadian defences. He strengthened the fortifications of Quebec by building walls and an elevated battery. Brock succeeded in creating a formidable defensive position due largely to his military reading, which included several volumes on the science of running and setting up artillery. He also rearranged and strengthened the Provincial Marine (responsible for transport on the lakes and rivers). He ordered warships to be built and developed a naval force capable of holding the Great Lakes. This was to be pivotal during the war. But Brock's appropriation of civilian lands and labour for military use <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> <b>into</b> conflict with the civilian authorities led by Thomas Dunn.|$|E
5|$|In {{return for}} a loan and a {{guarantee}} of Danish protection, Bishop Johann von Münchhausen signed a treaty on 26September 1559 giving Frederick II of Denmark the right to nominate the bishop of Ösel–Wiek, an act which amounted to the sale of these territories for 30,000 thalers. Frederick II nominated his brother, Duke Magnus of Holstein as bishop, who then took possession in April 1560. Lest Danish efforts create more insecurity for Sweden, Denmark made another attempt to mediate a peace in the region. Magnus at once pursued his own interests, purchasing the Bishopric of Courland without Frederick's consent and trying to expand into Harrien–Wierland (Harju and Virumaa). This <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> <b>into</b> direct conflict with Eric.|$|E
60|$|At last, the Danes being {{tired of}} this, and being {{assembled}} at a drunken merry-making, had <b>him</b> <b>brought</b> <b>into</b> the feasting-hall.|$|R
