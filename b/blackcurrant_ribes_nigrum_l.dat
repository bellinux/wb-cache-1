40|$|Abstract: Effect {{of plant}} {{phenolics}} isolated from leaves of <b>blackcurrant</b> (<b>Ribes</b> <b>nigrum</b> <b>L.)</b> and sour cherry (Prunus cerasus L.) as potential biopesticides {{against the grain}} aphid was examined. The extracts from the sour cherry contained a twice higher level of salicylic acid than extract from leaves of the blackcurrant. Moreover, concentration of chlorogenic acid was higher in sour cherry {{and the content of}} tannic acid within both plant tissues was at the same level. Both examined extracts had a negative effect on development of the grain aphid when the aphid fed on wheat plants sprayed with 1. 0 %, 2. 5 % and 5. 0 % solutions. The length of prereproductive period (time from birth to maturity) of the aphids was extended from 5. 9 days on control plants (not sprayed) to 8. 1 days, when the aphids were fed on the treated plants. Apterous females of Sitobion avenae fed on sprayed plants showed lower fecundity and lower values of intrinsic rate of natural increase...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{anti-inflammatory}} {{effects of}} proanthocyanidins (PACs), isolated from <b>blackcurrant</b> (<b>Ribes</b> <b>nigrum</b> <b>L.)</b> leaves, were analysed using carrageenin-induced paw oedema and carrageenin-induced pleurisy in rats. Results Pretreatment {{of the animals}} with PACs (10, 30, 60 and 100 mg/kg, i. p.) reduced paw oedema induced by carrageenin in a dose and time-dependent manner. PACs also inhibited dose-dependently carrageenin-induced pleurisy in rats. They reduced (A) lung injury, (B) pleural exudate formation, (C) polymorphonuclear cell infiltration, (D) pleural exudate levels of TNF-α, IL- 1 β and CINC- 1 but did not affect IL- 6 and IL- 10 levels. They reduced (E) pleural exudate levels of nitrite/nitrate (NOx). In indomethacin treated rats, the volume of pleural exudate was low, its content in leukocytes and its contents in TNF-α, IL- 1 β, IL- 6 and IL- 10 but not in NOx were reduced. These {{data suggest that the}} anti-inflammatory properties of PACs are achieved through a different pattern from those of indomethacin. Conclusion These results suggest that the main mechanism of the anti-inflammatory effect of PACs mainly lies in an interference with the migration of the leukocytes.

40|$|<b>Blackcurrants</b> (<b>Ribes</b> <b>nigrum</b> <b>L.</b> cv.

The emission of volatiles was assessed after 3 and 6 weeks (prolonged storage) and analyzed by GC/MS. Fifty-three volatile compounds were quantified through calibration curves. Fruit that were stored in air, for either 3 or 6 weeks, {{did not differ significantly}} from freshly harvested fruit with respect to total terpene volatiles. However, decreasing O 2 levels and increasing CO 2 levels retarded the capacity of 3 -week stored fruit to synthesize terpenes, although prolonged storage under these conditions led to a partial recovery. Differential changes among the various groups of terpenes were more important, where terpene alcohols reached a peak in 6 -week air-stored fruit, and storing berries under a high CO 2 level (18 kPa) and/or decreasing O 2 level (2 kPa) resulted, in most cases, in lower biosynthesis of these alcohols compared to 6 -week air-stored fruit. Non-terpene compounds, mainly esters and alcohols, were also increased in air-stored fruit. CA storage conditions led to a transitory reduction in the emission of alcohols but a recovery was recorded with prolonged storage. Non-terpene esters differed greatly in storage, in particular the ester ethyl butanoate. Air-stored fruit at both sampling dates synthesized significantly higher amounts of esters than freshly harvested fruit but a significant decline was observed for branched butyl substances (2 -methylbutanoate) after 6 weeks storag...|$|R

The optimum eluent conditions were 5. 0 mL of MeOH/H 2 O (1 : 1, v/v) at pH 2. The extracts were analyzed by HPLC with diode-array detection (DAD) and the extraction efficiency was evaluated by statistical comparison (analysis of variance, ANOVA-single factor) of the compounds peak areas. The extraction efficiency for the MSPD procedure was dependent on the chemical nature of the C 18 material but the optimized procedure yielded results similar to those obtained by the inexpensive sea sand disruption method (SSDM). This procedure also compared favorably to a previously published liquid–liquid extraction method. The optimized sea sand method was then used in the anthocyanin extraction from red grapes (Vitis vinifera L.) and strawberries (Fragaria ananassa D.) yielding chromatographic profiles similar to those {{reported in the literature}} for these products...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis work reports bio-oil {{production}} by hydrothermal liquefaction of <b>blackcurrant</b> pomace (<b>Ribes</b> <b>nigrum</b> <b>L),</b> a fruit residue obtained after berry pressing. The bio-oil {{has a higher}} heating value of 35. 9 MJ kg(- 1) and low ash content, which makes it suitable for energy applications. We report the influence of process parameters on yields and carbon distribution between products: temperature (563 - 608 K), holding time (0 - 240 min), mass fraction of dry biomass in the slurry (0. 05 - 0. 29), and initial pH (3. 1 - 12. 8) by adding sodium hydroxide (NaOH). Depending on the experiments, the bio-oil accounts for at least 24 % mass fraction of the initial dry biomass, while char yields ranges from 24 to 40 %. A temperature of 583 K enhances the bio-oil yield, up to 30 %, while holding time {{does not have a}} significant influence on the results. Increasing biomass concentrations decreases bio-oil yields from 29 % to 24 %. Adding sodium hydroxide decreases the char yield from 35 % at pH = 3. 1 (without NaOH) to 24 % at pH = 12. 8. It also increases the bio-oil yield and carbon transfer to the aqueous phase. Thermogravimetric analysis shows that a 43 % mass fraction of the bio-oil boils in the medium naphtha petroleum fraction range. The bio-oil is highly acidic and unsaturated, and its dynamic viscosity is high (1. 7 Pa sat 298 K), underlining the need for further upgrading before any use for fuel applications...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{detrimental}} effects of mild winter temperatures on {{the consistency of}} cropping of <b>blackcurrant</b> (<b>Ribes</b> <b>nigrum</b> <b>L.)</b> in parts of Europe have led to increasing interest in the genetic control of dormancy release in this species. This study examined patterns of gene expression in leaf buds of blackcurrant to identify key differential changes in these profiles {{around the time of}} budbreak. Results: Using leaf bud tissue of blackcurrant, a cDNA library was generated as a source of blackcurrant ESTs for construction of a custom microarray, which was used to identify differential gene expression during dormancy release. Gene activity was lowest in early stages of dormancy, increasing to reach a maximum around the time of budbreak. Genes with significantly changing expression profiles were clustered and evidence is provided for the transient activity of genes previously associated with dormancy processes in other species. Expression profiling identified candidate genes which were mapped onto a blackcurrant genetic linkage map containing budbreakrelated QTL. Three genes, which putatively encode calmodulin-binding protein, beta tubulin and acetyl CoA carboxylase respectively, were found to co-localise with budbreak QTL. Conclusions: This study provides insight into the genetic control of dormancy transition in blackcurrant, identifying key changes in gene expression around budbreak. Genetic mapping of ESTs enabled the identification of genes which co-localise with previously-characterised blackcurrant QTL, and it is concluded that these genes have probable roles in release of dormancy and can therefore provide a basis for the development of genetic markers for future breeding deployment...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{effects of}} proanthocyanidins (PACs), {{isolated}} from <b>blackcurrant</b> (<b>Ribes</b> <b>nigrum</b> <b>L.)</b> leaves, on neutrophil accumulation during inflammatory processes were investigated in vivo and in vitro. Methods In vivo studies were performed using carrageenin-induced pleurisy in rats pre-treated with PACs. Exudate volume and PMNs accumulation were measured. Leukocyte cell adhesion molecules (LFA- 1, Mac- 1 and VLA- 4) mobilization in circulating granulocytes were analysed by flow cytometry and endothelial cell adhesion molecules (ICAM- 1 and VCAM- 1) were detected by immunohistochemistry on lung sections. In vitro studies {{were conducted on}} endothelial LT 2 cells, stimulated with TNF-α, to evaluate ICAM- 1, IL- 8 and VEGF mRNA expression upon PACs treatment. Data sets were examined by {{one-way analysis of variance}} (ANOVA) followed by a Scheffe post-hoc test. Results Pretreatment of the animals with PACs (10, 30 and 60 mg/kg) inhibited dose-dependently carrageenin-induced pleurisy in rats by reducing pleural exudate formation and PMNs infliltration. Leukocyte cell adhesion molecules mobilization was not down-regulated on granulocytes by PACs. Immunohistochemistry on lung sections showed a decreased production of endothelial cell adhesion molecules. In vitro experiments demonstrated that PACs were able to significantly inhibit ICAM- 1 but not IL- 8 and VEGF 165 mRNA expression. Moreover, VEGF 121 mRNA expression was dose-dependently enhanced. Conclusion This study provides evidence to support the anti-inflammatory activity of proanthocyanidins is related to an inhibition of leukocyte infiltration which can be explained at least in part by a down-regulation of endothelial adhesion molecules, ICAM- 1 and VCAM- 1 and that these compounds are capable of modulating TNF-α-induced VEGF transcription. </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Increasing {{evidence}} suggests that anthocyanins, as natural antioxidants, exert anti-carcinogenic, anti-inflammatory, vaso-protective and anti-obesity effects when tested in vitro or in vivo. <b>Blackcurrant</b> (<b>Ribes</b> <b>nigrum</b> <b>L.)</b> berries are {{a rich source of}} anthocyanins with concentrations up to 4 -fold greater than that of other common fruits. However, there is a paucity of information on how blackcurrant anthocyanins change during ripening on the bush or during postharvest storage, which could lead to better selection of fruits with enhanced health-promoting properties. Accordingly, the present study describes the temporal changes in anthocyanins in different blackcurrant genotypes during the late stages of development or as a result of postharvest storage at different temperatures. In all cases, four major anthocyanins (viz. cyanidin- 3 -glucoside, cyanidin- 3 -rutinoside, delphinidin- 3 -glucoside and delphinidin- 3 -rutinoside) were identified, accounting for over 80 % of the total anthocyanin concentrations. Three different development stages (viz. early ripe (ER), fully ripe (FR) or over ripe (OR)) were chosen when fruit were at commercial maturity but presented different colorations. Anthocyanin concentration was nearly double in OR berries than ER, however the temporal changes during ripening were genotype-dependent, with some cultivars reaching maximum concentrations at the FR stage. During postharvest storage anthocyanin synthesis was observed in both ER and FR berries during storage, but ER berries never reached the concentrations of those harvested at FR stage. Storage temperature crucially affected anthocyanin concentrations in FR but not in ER berries. The results from this study may provide both growers and industry with additional information for maximising anthocyanin concentrations in blackcurrant berries...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Deep-level second {{generation}} sequencing (2 GS) technologies {{are now being}} applied to non-model species as a viable and favourable alternative to Sanger sequencing. Large-scale SNP discovery was undertaken in <b>blackcurrant</b> (<b>Ribes</b> <b>nigrum</b> <b>L.)</b> using transcriptome-based 2 GS 454 sequencing on the parental genotypes of a reference mapping population, to generate large numbers of novel markers {{for the construction of}} a high-density linkage map. Results Over 700, 000 reads were produced, from which a total of 7, 000 SNPs were found. A subset of polymorphic SNPs was selected to develop a 384 -SNP OPA assay using the Illumina BeadXpress platform. Additionally, the data enabled identification of 3, 000 novel EST-SSRs. The selected SNPs and SSRs were validated across diverse Ribes germplasm, including mapping populations and other selected Ribes species. SNP-based maps were developed from two blackcurrant mapping populations, incorporating 48 % and 27 % of assayed SNPs respectively. A relatively high proportion of visually monomorphic SNPs were investigated further by quantitative trait mapping of theta score outputs from BeadStudio analysis, and this enabled additional SNPs to be placed on the two maps. Conclusions The use of 2 GS technology for the development of markers is superior to previously described methods, in both numbers of markers and biological informativeness of those markers. Whilst the numbers of reads and assembled contigs were comparable to similar sized studies of other non-model species, here a high proportion of novel genes were discovered across a wide range of putative function and localisation. The potential utility of markers developed using the 2 GS approach in downstream breeding applications is discussed. </p...|$|E

All professional blackcurrant producers, scientists, and marketers in France were mobilized to propose solutions to this scale insect infestation. Control with chemical products registered in France did not achieve satisfactory results. Populations were always high {{at the end of}} the year, and infestations began again the following year. Control with a beneficial insect has worked since 2013, when the ladybird species Rhyzobius lophantae Blaisdell (Coleoptera, Coccinellidae) was favored for study because it is less specific than microhymenoptera like Aphytis and Encarsia genus. A commercial source of R. lophantae was available in Holland, so releases were made in 2013 with an efficiency recognized over P pentagona when large amounts of ladybirds were released. This first encouraging result had to be refined. A trial was established in 2014 on the same plot with larger area and different amounts of ladybirds released. The results showed a decrease in populations of P pentagona females between the 1 st and 2 nd generations. In addition, 2 nd generation crawlers were not observed in any treatment plot. This suggests an efficiency of R. lophantae; however, this ladybird moved a lot. The experimental design adopted therefore was not suitable because it was not possible to differentiate between treatment plots. It is recommended to conduct research on remote plots in order to avoid R. lophantae contamination between plots. This type of test is set up in 2015 at only one producer farm.

50|$|The <b>blackcurrant</b> (<b>Ribes</b> <b>nigrum)</b> is a woody shrub in {{the family}} Grossulariaceae grown for its piquant berries. It is native to {{temperate}} parts of central and northern Europe and northern Asia where it prefers damp fertile soils and is widely cultivated both commercially and domestically. It is winterhardy, but cold weather at flowering time during the spring reduces {{the size of the}} crop. Bunches of small, glossy black fruit develop along the stems in the summer and can be harvested by hand or by machine. The raw fruit is particularly rich in vitamin C and polyphenol phytochemicals. Blackcurrants can be eaten raw but are usually cooked in a variety of sweet or savoury dishes. They are used to make jams, jellies and syrups and are grown commercially for the juice market. The fruit is also used in the preparation of alcoholic beverages and both fruit and foliage have uses in traditional medicine and the preparation of dyes.|$|R
40|$|Berries contain several {{bioactive}} {{compounds that}} can protect against oxidative stress. In {{this study we}} evaluated the protective effect of different sequential extracts (ethyl acetate, ethanol and water) of seven berry species: bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus), <b>blackcurrant</b> (<b>Ribes</b> <b>nigrum),</b> elderberry (Sambucus nigra), lingonberry (Vaccinium vitis-idaea), rose hips (Rosa sp.), sea buckthorn (Hippohae rhamnoides) and strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa). The protective effect was tested on human erythrocytes and the antioxidant capacity was also evaluated in vitro by the FRAP assay. In the erythrocyte assay all sea buckthorn extracts were superior in antioxidant effect to other berry extracts. The ethyl acetate extract of bilberries, and the ethanol and water extracts of blackcurrants, also protected the erythrocytes from oxidation. In contrast, water extracts of rose hips, bilberries and strawberries had a pro-oxidant effect on erythrocytes. The water extract of rose hips was superior to the other berry extracts in the FRAP assay. Thus, {{the results of the}} erythrocyte assay did not correlate with the results of the FRAP assay, but provided additional insights into the potential protective effects of berry extracts against oxidative stress...|$|R
40|$|<b>Blackcurrant</b> (<b>Ribes</b> <b>nigrum</b> <b>L.)</b> {{fruit is}} used in the food {{industry}} to produce various beverages, jams and other preparations. Waste blackcurrant skins from fruit pressing are obtained in large quantities from this sustainable and food-grade source. The material can be processed and extracted in large scale using acidified water, and subsequently purified using Solid Phase Extraction. The blackcurrant extracts are intensely coloured due to the presence of anthocyanins and have potential to act as natural colorants in consumer products. Blackcurrant extract was analysed using analytical HPLC, LC-MS, 1 H NMR spectroscopy and total monomeric anthocyanin content assay (TMAC). Four major anthocyanins along with eight other polyphenols were identified in the crude extract; these were rutinosides and glucosides of cyanidin and delphinidin. Flavonols namely quercetin and myricetin were found in the aglycon form as well as mono- and di-substituted forms. Caffeic and p-coumaric acid were also present in the extract. Liquid-liquid extraction allows partitioning of specific metabolites based on their physical properties (neutral or charged species, aglycons, glucosides or rutinosides). It was observed that migration of different polyphenols out of the aqueous layer is possible by taking advantage of parameters such as the polarity of the organic solvent employed or pH of the aqueous layer. Use of ethyl acetate facilitates removal of neutral compounds, such as myricetin and quercetin (aglycons and glucosides) along with hydroxycinnamic acids (caffeic and p-coumaric acids), out of the aqueous extract. Isopropyl acetate selectively removes hydroxycinnamic acids and quercetin analogues, with the four blackcurrant anthocyanins (Dp- 3 -glc, Dp- 3 -rut, Cy- 3 -glc, Cy- 3 -rut) and both myricetin and quercetin rutinosides remaining in the aqueous layer. Myricetin and quercetin rutinosides could be subsequently removed by extraction in ethyl acetate at higher pH (6. 29), leaving a purified anthocyanin fraction. Preparative HPLC was utilised to isolate these polyphenols which were then fully characterised...|$|E
40|$|Gamma-linolenic acid (γ-linolenic acid, GLA; C 18 : 3 Δ 6, 9, 12) {{belongs to}} the omega- 6 family and exists {{primarily}} in several plant oils, such as evening primrose oil, blackcurrant oil, and borage oil. Δ 6 -desaturase is a key enzyme involved in the synthesis of GLA. There have been no previous reports on the genes encoding Δ 6 -desaturase in <b>blackcurrant</b> (<b>Ribes</b> <b>nigrum</b> <b>L.).</b> In this research, five nearly identical copies of Δ 6 -desaturase gene-like sequences, named RnD 8 A, RnD 8 B, RnD 6 C, RnD 6 D, and RnD 6 E, were isolated from blackcurrant. Heterologous expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and/or Arabidopsis thaliana confirmed that RnD 6 C/D/E were Δ 6 -desaturases that could use both α-linolenic acids (ALA; C 18 : 3 Δ 9, 12, 15) and linoleic acid (LA; C 18 : 2 Δ 9, 12) precursors in vivo, whereas RnD 8 A/B were Δ 8 -sphlingolipid desaturases. Expression of GFP tagged with RnD 6 C/D/E showed that blackcurrant Δ 6 -desaturases were located in the mitochondrion (MIT) in yeast and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in tobacco. GC-MS results showed that blackcurrant accumulated GLA and octadecatetraenoic acids (OTA; C 18 : 4 Δ 6, 9, 12, 15) mainly in seeds and a little in other organs and tissues. RT-PCR results showed that RnD 6 C and RnD 6 E were expressed in all the tissues at a low level, whereas RnD 6 D was expressed {{at a high level}} only in seeds, leading to the accumulation of GLA and OTA in seeds. This research provides new insights to our understanding of GLA synthesis and accumulation in plants and the evolutionary relationship of this class of desaturases, and new clues as to the amino acid determinants which define precise enzyme activity...|$|E

Researches were {{conducted}} in the Animal Husbandry Department of the Veterinary Academy of Lithuanian Health Sciences University, also in the vivarium of Lithuanian Veterinary Academy and in the Institute of Animal Reproduction and Food Research of the Polish Academy of Sciences. New Zealand rabbits {{were used for the}} researches. All rabbits were calved over one cycle of reproduction (50 percent were male and 50 percent were female). All rabbits were assigned to four groups of five individuals each. The rabbits of the control group (K) were fed a standard diet; the group KP was fed a standard diet with increased fat volume. The rabbits of the group E were subjected to a standard diet with the addition of blackcurrant polyphenolic extract (1, 5 percent), the animals of the group EP were fed a standard diet with increased fat volume + blackcurrant extract (1, 5 percent). Duration of the research was 45 days. Rabbits were stored in the individual flat-bottomed wire cages in closed room. Over the research all rabbits were fed and watered ad libitum. The research included observation of rabbit growth dynamics, level of ammonia in the substance of cecum, activity of microbe ferments, short-chain fatty acids, and research of overall wellness. Thegoalofthepaper: to investigate the effect of <b>blackcurrant</b> (<b>Ribes</b> <b>nigrum</b> <b>L.)</b> products distinguishing for antioxidant features on digestive processes and productivity of rabbits. The goal of the paper has been achieved by solving the following tasks: • Generation of high digestible energy obtained from high-fat feeding regimens by replacing grass meal with blackcurrant pomace; • Establish the interaction of the weight and overweight of the rabbits, feed consumption with blackcurrant; • Investigate the effect of blackcurrant pomace on pH and dry matter of the content of separate segments of the gastrointestinal tract; • Establish the effect of blackcurrant pomace on the viscosity of the content of the ileum and on the concentration of ammonia in the content of the caecum; • Investigate the concentration and composition of CSFA in the caecum; • Establish the effect of blackcurrant pomace on the activities of the proteins, bacterial enzymes (α- and β-galactosidase, glucosidase, α- and β-glucosidase and β-glucuronidase) in the caecal and colonic contents and on the volumes of volatile fatty acids (VFA); • Establish the effect on the indicators of the antioxidant status of the rabbits; • Establish the effect on biochemical parameters of the blood; • Investigate the indicators of atherogenicity and insulin resistance of the rabbits. Results of the research. Consumption of blackcurrant pomace by replacing grass meal has confirmed the hypothesis that it can be considered as an effective and affordable ingredient of feeding regimens for rabbits. Supplementing the feeding regimen with blackcurrant pomace has reliably decreased the total concentration of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) within the digestive content of the caecum of the rabbits, and it has been established the reduced concentration of acetic acid. The used blackcurrant pomace has not any effect on the concentrations of propionic, isobutyric, isovaleric and valeric acids (p < 0, 05). Feeding the rabbits with a high-fat diet with the addition of blackcurrant pomace extract rich in polyphenolic compounds positively modifies lipids in blood serum and body antioxidant activity, and the measurements of the function of the large intestine. It is observed the tendency for ensuring the stability of the parameter of the insulin physiologic norm. Consumption of relatively high amounts of the product obtained during the process of blackcurrant reprocessing (pomace) can also have a positive therapeutic effect for treatment of disorders of the functions related to obesity and their complications. The regiment with blackcurrant pomace has not had any effect on the rapidity of rabbits’ growth and consumption of feed; however, it has reliably reduced the activity of β-glucoronidase in the caecum. Irresective of the feeding regiment type used for the experimental groups, blackcurrant pomace has reduced the activities of α-glucosidase, β-glucosidase, α-galactosidase. The results of the research show the benefit of blackcurrant pomace the physiological outcomes of rabbits’ digestive system due to the interaction between contained fibre and polyphenolic compounds...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Endothelial {{dysfunction}} {{is a major}} {{hallmark of}} most types of cardiovascular diseases. Numerous plant extracts {{have been shown to}} cause endothelium-dependent relaxations by increasing the endothelial formation of the potent vasoprotective factor, nitric oxide (NO). OBJECTIVE: The ability of different <b>Ribes</b> <b>nigrum</b> <b>L.</b> extracts (Grossulariaceae) to induce endothelium-dependent relaxation by stimulating the endothelial formation of NO was assesssed. METHODS: <b>Ribes</b> <b>nigrum</b> extracts were prepared from buds, berries and leaves by extraction (Acetone:H 2 O:Acetic Acid; 70 / 28 / 2 (v/v/v)) and lyophilized after acetone evaporation. The ability of the extracts to stimulate the endothelial formation of NO was assessed using cultured endothelial cells and isolated porcine coronary artery rings. RESULTS: The <b>Ribes</b> <b>nigrum</b> leaf extract increased {{to a greater extent than}} the bud and the berry extracts the formation of NO, and up-regulated eNOS mRNA expression in cultured endothelial cells (the stimulatory effects amounted to 197 ± 9 %, 134 ± 6 % and 118 ± 5 %, respectively). The leaf extract induced greater relaxations of isolated coronary arteries with endothelium than the bud and the berry extracts whereas no such effects were observed in rings without endothelium. Relaxations to the leaf extract were minimally affected by indomethacin and by inhibitors of endothelium-dependent hyperpolarization response, and markedly reduced by NG-nitro-L-arginine. CONCLUSIONS: The present findings indicate that the <b>Ribes</b> <b>nigrum</b> leaf extract is a more potent inducer of the endothelial formation of NO than the bud and the berry extracts.
