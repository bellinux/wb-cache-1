40|$|The common {{assumption}} that Theta- 1 -Ori C {{is the dominant}} ionizing source for the Orion Nebula is critically examined. This assumption underlies much of the existing analysis of the nebula.

Theta- 1 -Ori-C does dominate ionization in the inner part of the Orion Nebula, but outside of the <b>Bright</b> <b>Bar</b> as far as the southeast boundary of the Extended Orion Nebula, Theta- 2 -Ori-A is the dominant source. In addition to identifying the ionizing star in sample regions, we were able to locate those portions of the nebula in 3 -D.

The CO data are analysed in a consistent way, allowing the inter isotopomeric abundance ratios to be studied {{over a wide range}} of extinction values. The 13 CO lines are optically thick; the 13 CO abundance being enhanced because of strong isotopic fractionation near the <b>Bright</b> <b>Bar,</b> but less convincingly in the OMC 1 cloud. The fractionation occurs mostly in the less opaque regions where the 13 CO column density N(13 CO) may be enhanced by up to one order of magnitude, relative to the more shielded parts. No isotope selective enhancement of the other CO isotopomers was seen; C 18 O may in fact show a slight depletion in more exposed material. The C 18 O and C 17 O lines are optically thin, and correlated with the 790 μm dust continuum emission. The CI emission comes from hot optically thin gas; the abundance ratios of CI/CO are typically 0. 05 - 0. 3, with the larger ratios towards the northern section of the Orion ridge.

The N(13 CO) /N(C 18 O) ratio has been plotted against visual extinction (A v) and fits a power law relation. The highest values, as expected, occur for observed positions with the lowest derived extinction, with N(13 CO) /N(C 18 O) exceeding the terrestrial value (5. 5) for A v ≤ 60 magnitudes. In the outermost parts of the cloud (A v ≤ 20 magnitudes) the N(13 CO) /N(C 18 O) ratio is largest, up to 20. Comparison with similar observations of the S 140 and Orion <b>Bright</b> <b>Bar</b> regions implies that higher incident UV field leads to increased fractionation effects. The N(CI) /N(CO) ratio has been plotted against visual extinction, as derived from N(C 18 O), for the range A v = 20 - 100 magnitudes and also fits a power law relation. N(CI) /N(CO) increases with decreasing extinction from ~ 0. 03 - 0. 04 for A v ~ 100 mags. to ≥ 0. 1 for A v ~ 20 mags., corresponding to positions {{near the edge of}} the HII region/molecular cloud interface. Comparison with identical observations of the S 140 and Orion <b>Bright</b> <b>Bar</b> regions implies that, unlike N(13 CO) /N(C 18 O), the behaviour of N(CI) /N(CO) is insensitive to incident UV field over this range of extinction...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Usingextracellular {{recordings}} and computational modeling, we study {{the responses of}} a population of turtle �Pseudemys scripta elegans) retinal ganglion cells to di€erent motion patterns. The onset of motion of a <b>bright</b> <b>bar</b> is signaled by a rise of the population activity that occurs within less than 100 ms. Correspondingly, more complex stimulus movement patterns are re¯ected by rapid variations of the ®ringrate of the retinal ganglion cell population. This behavior is reproduced by a computational model that generates ganglion cell activity from the spatio-temporal stimulus pattern usinga Wiener model complemented by a non-linear contrast gain control feedback loop responsible for the sharp transients in response to motion onset. This study demonstrates that contrast gain control strongly in¯uences the temporal course of retinal population activity, and thereby {{plays a major role}} in the formation of a population code for stimulus movement patterns.

40|$|AbstractContrast {{thresholds}} for sine-wave gratings {{are raised}} when the gratings are compressively sampled into {{a set of}} narrow <b>bright</b> <b>bars</b> on a dark background, even though this method of sampling preserves the mean luminance and contrast of the grating. Burr et al. [(1985). Vision Research, 25, 717 – 727] suggested threshold elevation was due to localized luminance adaptation to the sample bars, whose average peak luminance necessarily increased when fewer bars per cycle were present. Previously, we reported results using decrement-bar compressively sampled gratings (CSGs), which consist of dark sample <b>bars</b> on a <b>bright</b> background, which favoured the local luminance adaptation hypothesis (Kingdom & Rainville, 1995). Here we report experiments that suggest that this hypothesis is untenable. Using increment-bar CSGs (<b>bright</b> sample <b>bars</b> on a dark background) we found that raising background luminance while holding sample bar luminance constant reduced thresholds {{by as much as}} a factor of ten. This suggests that it is the contrast of the bars, rather than their luminance, which determines thresholds. Further experiments showed that CSG detection was facilitated by unsampled grating pedestals, and thresholds were elevated when the fundamental was physically cancelled. This implied that CSGs were detected by the same mechanisms as the unsampled gratings from which they are derived. Finally, we provide evidence for the involvement of a dynamic gain control component for increment-bar CSG detection...|$|R
40|$|We have {{constructed}} a geometric {{model for the}} Orion Nebula exploiting {{the fact that most}} of the radiation arises from a relatively thin layer of ionized material near the ionization front on the near side of the giant molecular cloud OMC- 1. As a first step, an extinction corrected surface brightness map of H alpha emission was combined with point by point determinations of the electron density to determine the thickness of the emitting layer across the nebula. The second step involved calculation of the geometry that would satisfy the derived emitting layer thickness constraint, the surface brightness in H alpha, and the assumption that all of the ionizing radiation comes from a single star, theta(sup 1) Ori C. This was done both for the case of a constant gas density along a line of sight and the more realistic case of an exponentially decreasing density. The resulting models show that M 42 is a highly irregular object, with regions in the ionization front where the local slope in the geometry is steeper producing higher surface brightnesses. This model also explains local ionization variations near the <b>Bright</b> <b>Bar</b> and the brightest region about 40 sec southwest of theta(sup 1) Ori C...|$|E
40|$|A nebular {{analysis}} of the central Orion Nebula and its main structures is presented. We exploit MUSE integral field observations in the wavelength range 4595 - 9366 Å to produce the first O, S and N ionic and total abundance maps of a region spanning 6 ' x 5 ' with a spatial resolution of 0. 2 ". We use the S_ 23 (= ([SII]λ 6717, 31 +[SIII]λ 9068) /Hβ) parameter, together with [OII]/[OIII] {{as an indicator of}} the degree of ionisation, to distinguish between the various small-scale structures. The only Orion Bullet covered by MUSE is HH 201, which shows a double component in the [FeII]λ 8617 line throughout indicating an expansion, and we discuss a scenario in which this object is undergoing a disruptive event. We separate the proplyds located south of the <b>Bright</b> <b>Bar</b> into four categories depending on their S_ 23 values, propose the utility of the S_ 23 parameter as an indicator of the shock-contribution to the excitation of line-emitting atoms, and show that the MUSE data is able to identify the proplyds associated with disks and microjets. We compute the second order structure function for the Hα, [OIII]λ 5007, [SII]λ 6731 and [OI]λ 6300 emission lines to analyse the turbulent velocity field of the region covered with MUSE.

We find that the maps of electron density, O+/H+ and O/H ratios show a rather similar structure. We interpret this as produced by the strong depen-dence on density of the [O ii] lines used to derive the O+ abundance, and that our nominal values of electron density –derived from the [S ii] line ratio – may be slightly higher than the appropriate value for the O+ zone. We measure the faint recombina-tion lines of O ii in the field at the northeast of the Orion South cloud allowing us to explore the so-called abundance discrepancy problem.

40|$|At {{intermediate}} redshifts, many galaxies {{seem to be}} perturbed or {{suffering from}} an interaction. Considering that disk galaxies may have formed and evolved through minor mergers or through major mergers, {{it is important to}} understand the mechanisms at play during each type of merger in order to be able to establish the outcome of such an event. In some cases, only the use of both morphological and kinematical information can disentangle the actual configuration of an encounter at intermediate redshift. In this work, we present the morphological and kinematical analysis of a system at z= 0. 74 in order to understand its configuration, interacting stage and evolution. Using the integral field spectrograph GIRAFFE, long-slit spectroscopy by FORS 2 and direct optical images from the HST-ACS and ISAAC near-infrared images, we disentangle the morphology of this system, its star-formation history and its extended kinematics in order to propose a possible configuration for the system. Numerical simulations are used to test different interacting scenarii. We identify this system as a face-on disk galaxy with a very <b>bright</b> <b>bar</b> in interaction with a smaller companion with a mass ratio of 3 : 1. The relevance of kinematical information and the constraints it imposes on the interpretation of the observations of distant galaxies is particularly strengthened in this case.

40|$|Although inner star-forming {{rings are}} common in optical images of barred spiral galaxies, {{observational}} evidence for the accompanying molecular gas has been scarce. In this paper we present images of molecular inner rings, traced using the CO (1 - 0) emission line, from the Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland-Association Survey of Nearby Galaxies (BIMA SONG). We detect inner ring CO emission from all five SONG barred galaxies classified as inner ring (type (r)). We also examine the seven SONG barred galaxies classified as inner spiral (type (s)); in one of these, NGC 3627, we find morphological and kinematic evidence for a molecular inner ring. Inner ring galaxies have been classified as such based on optical images, which emphasize recent star formation. We {{consider the possibility that}} there may exist inner rings in which star formation efficiency is not enhanced. However, we find that in NGC 3627 the inner ring star formation efficiency is enhanced relative to most other regions in that galaxy. We note that the SONG (r) galaxies have a paucity of CO and H alpha emission interior to the inner ring (except near the nucleus), while NGC 3627 has relatively <b>bright</b> <b>bar</b> CO and H alpha emission; we suggest that galaxies with inner rings such as NGC 3627 may be misclassified if there are significant amounts of gas and star formation in the bar.

40|$|I {{present a}} {{detailed}} study of two Magellanic Irregular galaxies, NGC 4214 and NGC 1156. With relatively high star formation rates and plenty of neutral gas, they are interesting laboratories in which to study the organisational processes that lead to star formation. These galaxies have masses in the ransition region between dwarf irregular and spiral galaxies, and are close analogues of the Large Magellanic Cloud, so it is of interest make detailed observations for later comparative studies. The neutral Hydrogen observations are the highest angular resolution available to date for these galaxies (800 FWHM), with fine velocity resolution (1. 3 km. s‾¹). These show remarkable structure in both objects, including large holes and small clouds of gas (107 Mסּ) with moderate velocity offsets from the general rotation. An large, incompletely evacuated hole (2. 2 kpc diameter) dominates the western half of NGC 1156. Its origin is unclear. The velocity fields of both galaxies show most of the disk is rotating smoothly, but near the centre appear to have significant noncircular motions, probably induced by a stellar bar. Échelle spectroscopy at Hα shows the HII regions are following the same orbits as the neutral gas. The galaxies 2 ̆ 7 optical structure and stellar populations are characterised through multicolour imaging, Hα emission-line imaging and densely-spaced longslit spectra. NGC 4214 exhibits two exponential components in its surface brightness profile, while NGC 1156 {{is consistent with a}} single exponential. In both objects the major axis of the <b>bright</b> <b>bar</b> lies along quite a dfferent position angle to the kinematic major axis. Colour maps reveal varied populations in the bright bars of both galaxies, and the outer disk of NGC 4214. I make detailed comparisons of the galaxies 2 ̆ 7 colour-colour distribution with stellar population models, and employ absorption-line indices from the longslit spectra as cross-checks in a few locations. Taken together the data suggest that over a large fraction of the galaxies there is a young population some tens of Myr old that contributes a few percent of the total stellar mass, though the particular combination of mass fraction and age cannot be uniquely determined. Neither galaxy exhibits strong O/H abundance variations within the <b>bright</b> <b>bar</b> region. Both galaxies are consistent with a model in which a minimum HI surface density (10 ²¹atom. cm‾²) is a necessary criterion for star formation. In NGC 1156 the radial distribution of star-forming regions is well predicted by the disk instability criterion discussed by Kennicutt (1989), while the criterion is less successful in NGC 4214. In a systematic survey of NGC 4214 I identifed 13 holes likely to be expanding or burst shells, roughly in accord with the number expected given the linear resolution and the HII-region population. In a majority of the holes, a star cluster capable of powering the expansion is visible within the hole boundary. However the holes are so young and that I expected all would contain a detectable cluster. In a few regions new star formation appears to have occurred in the walls of the identified holes, but the total number of HII regions near HI holes is consistent with that expected by chance...|$|E
